<DIV3>
<HEAD>RICHARD I. A. D. 1189</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD succeeded to his father's throne without opposition, and in the first assembly of his prelates and nobility, after his coro∣nation, he filled up the vacant sees of London, Winchester, Sarum, and Ely; and deliberated upon measures for enabling him to equip a powerful ar∣mament against the infidels, who had over-run the Holy Land. The King seized the effects of the late bishop of Ely, to a considerable value; which he had found in his father's treasury, at Winchester, gold, and silver, and jewels, to the amount of nine hundred thousand pounds. But even this vast sum was insufficient for his intended expedition to the Holy Land. He therefore sold the earldom of Northumber∣land,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>and the honour of Sudberg. He set up for sale the offices of high-sheriff, keepers of forests, and many other lucrative posts and dignities; liberties, charters, castles, and manors of the crown, were given to the highest bidders; and when some of his friends remonstrated to him the ill consequence of such aliena∣tion, he told them he would sell the city of London if he could find a purchaser.</P>
<P>When the King had prepared for his expedition, he received the scrip and staff from the archbishop of Tours, and marched to Vazelay, where he was joined by the King of France, and they proceeded to Messi∣na, and from thence for the Holy Land. But he was not so successful in his expedition as his flattery had suggested; and he was taken prisoner, and obliged to purchase his ransom. Nevertheless, upon his return to London, such was the infatuation of the people, that they received him with great marks of esteem, which soon after he ungratefully requited by the impo∣sitions of taxes too grievous to be borne.</P>
<P>But as the reign of this prince was apparently taken up in his infatuated attachment to the superstitious doc∣trines and practices of the see of Rome, he had little leisure or inclination to consult the happiness of his sub∣jects, or pursue measures conducive to liberty and true religion; and therefore gave room for the introduction of a variety of impositions on the rights of Britain, as the Pope and his legates thought fit.</P>
<P>As Richard was the first of the English Kings who bore arms on his seals, so he was the first who carried in his shield three lions passant, borne ever after for the regal arms of England.</P>
<P>As to his character, his strict attention to public worship, and his alms to the poor, and his gifts to those churches and monasteries which he had before robbed for his purposes, are the most shining parts of his reign. For his ingratitude, and want of filial affection, are unpardonable: he was proud,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>haughty, ambitious, choleric, cruel, vindictive, and licentious: a tyrant to his wife, as well as to his sub∣jects, who groaned under his taxations to such a high degree, that his few virtues could not preserve him from contempt.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>JOHN, A. D. 1199.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN, surnamed Sans-Terre or Lackland, upon the demise of Richard I. succeeded to the crown of England, though in prejudice to Arthur, who had an hereditary right; but as hereditary right had been so often set aside, both under the Saxon and Norman governments, it made no great disturbance in Eng∣land; and John who was at that time abroad on the continent, upon receiving intelligence of his designa∣tion to the crown, returned to England, and landing at New Shoreham proceeded directly to London; next day, June 9, he was crowned at Westminster by Hubert archbishop of Canterbury, in a full assembly of the pre∣lates, earls and barons, after the King had taken the oaths to maintain the peace of the church, and the people, to restrain rapine and other iniquities, and to be governed by equity and mercy in all his decisions. The Pope's legate, who then resided in England, brought about a peace between the Kings of France and England, which had commenced in the reign of King Richard. In consequence of this treaty, by which John reaped no advantage, but Philip's promise of abandoning the interest of Arthur; whereupon Arthur, to adjust matters with his brother, did him homage for Brittany.</P>
<P>During the expedition of King John, he was cap∣tivated with the beauty of Isabel, daughter of the King of Portugal, who, from the sudden impulse of his own unruly passion, thereupon resolved to de∣mand her in marriage; notwithstanding it was an act of injustice, as she was then affianced to Hugh le Brun, Count of la Marche; accordingly he premeditated a
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>divorce from his wife, and in spight of all his obstruc∣tions was immediately divorced by his own absolute command, this reason only being assigned, that she proved barren; his marriage with Isabel was then con∣summated, and she was afterwards crowned. The disappointed lover then became his most inveterate enemy, and the Pope was highly disgusted with a match founded upon a divorce which he had not been solicited to confirm, and John had much diffi∣culty to avoid annoyances as the consequence thereof.</P>
<P>During the King's absence on this expedition, Hu∣bert archbishop of Canterbury held a synod there, A. D. 1200, for the purposes of shewing a great ve∣neration for the Roman see. In this synod he made several alterations in the administration of ecclesiastical affairs, which the King approved, tho' contrary to the orders of the justiciary. Each of those new regulations concluded with a salvo of the honour and privileges of the church of Rome, a form that Hubert seems to have adopted to ingratiate himself with Pope Innocent, who was a pontiff of great resolution and abilities, calculated for extending the papal authority. After having kindled the enthusiasim of the people, by the sermons of his emissaries, he on pretence of relieving the Christians of the Holy Land, laid a tax of the fortieth part of all ecclesiastical revenues in Italy, Sclavonia, Germany, France and the British isles, for the maintainance of a new crusade, to be undertaken against the Saracens, and sent Philip a Roman notary to collect this imposition in England. While the Pope thus exercised his power over the clergy, he did not fail to exhort the laity to make a voluntary contribu∣tion for the same purpose; the King of France raised the same proportion in his territories, and John not only granted the fortieth part of his revenue for one year, but also authorised the same collections from all the barons, military tenants and freeholders through∣out the kingdom.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<P>Soon after this,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1002.</NOTE> the reign of John was at∣tended with many precipitant measures and unsuccessful attempts, pleasure and indulgence were the principal springs of his actions, and often∣times capricious and resolute, without wisdom to pro∣cure any favourable consequences to his measures; so that when he had homage done him by William King of Scotland, it was an homage only, without any honour accruing from it. When he quarrelled with the King of France, and had made preparation for vindicating the honour of his crown, he submitted in a pusilani∣mous manner to an insignificant treaty; and suffered his mind to be diverted from his own, and the nation's interest, by indulging to feasting and public enter∣tainment in the enemies country. However, to shew that he was able to do something, he took his elder brother's son Arthur prisoner, and he was cruelly murdered in the castle of Rouen: this act of inhu∣manity rendered the tyrant detestable in the eyes of all mankind; however it proved the cause of Brittany being for ever dismembered from the English crown. John was likewise summoned by the peers of France, to vindicate himself from the charge of murder; which he failling to do, was condemned by the una∣nimous sentence of the peers, couched in these terms, "Whereas John Duke of Normandy, forgetting his oath to King Philip his lord, has murdered his elder brother's son, an homager of the crown of France, and the King's kinsman; and perpetrated the crime within the signiority of France: he is found guilty of felony and treason, and adjudged to forfeit all the territories which he holds by homage."</P>
<P>Philip was extremely incensed against the author of that cruel tragedy, which he determined in earnest to revenge, and assembled a body of troops, and march∣ing towards Anjou, almost all the barons of that pro∣vince and Poitou revolted from John, and many of
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>the English noblemen of approved fidelity deserted him, and put themselves under Philip's protection.</P>
<P>John however found means to make some depreda∣tions in Normandy, and about the middle of August, A. D. 1023, he undertook the siege of Chateau Gail∣lard, on the banks of the Seine, built by Richard, and supposed impregnable. John, though at the head of an army equal in number to the French, was afraid of hazarding a battle, partly from cowardice, the consequence of his guilt, and partly from a sus∣picion of his soldiers: he therefore solicited the Pope's mediation, and his holiness sent two abbots to nego∣tiate a peace. Upon this the King of France dispatched some of his prelates to the Pope, who represented the conduct of John so notorious, that the Pope declined his mediation; and soon after the King relinquished his Norman dominions, and left them to the possession of the French, while Philip blocked up the castle of Gaillard, took Audely, and even reduced Radepont, an impor∣tant place in the neighbourhood of Rouen. The King of England indulged himself in riot and sloth, saying, when he was reminded of Philip's progress, "Let him proceed; I shall recover more in one day than he can conquer in a whole twelvemonth." But though John had not spirit enough to oppose the French King, he was soon after so alarmed at the conquest he had made, that he raised an army and invaded Britain, took several towns, and pillaged the country, but then reimbarked without doing any thing considerable for his own honour, or the nation's advantage. The whole duchy of Normandy was now subdued, except Ver∣nueil, Arques and Rouen, which engaged in a league for their mutual defence; but were at length over∣powered, and Normandy was reunited to the kingdom of France, after a separation of two hundred and ninety two years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet's History of England, vol. II. pag. 305.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<P>King John affected to complain loudly of the noblemen, who had left him at Rouen,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1204.</NOTE> as if their retreat had occasioned the loss of Normandy; and, on this pretence, extorted from them a seventh part of their moveables: he likewise contrived means for lay∣ing imposts upon the convents and parish-churches; and assembled a great council at Oxford, in order to delibe∣rate upon measures for retrieving his dominions on the continent. To defray the expence of this expedition, a scutage was charged upon the nobles and military te∣nants; nor were the prelates and clergy exempted from this burthen. But these aids were employed in sup∣plying his own extravagance.</P>
<P>John's character was so irregular and unsettled, that his conduct could not be consistent or uniform. He was by turns frightened into compliance, and pro∣voked into the most obstinate opposition. This period gave birth to his quarrel with the Pope, which invol∣ved himself and the nation in great calamities. Hu∣bert archbishop of Canterbury dying at his palace, the younger monks of Christ-church, assembled that very night, chose Reginald, their sub-prior, for his successor, sung <HI>Te Deum,</HI> and placed him upon the archiepiscopal throne. This new elect set out before morning, with some of the monks for Rome, where he hoped to be confirmed; and all concerned in the clan∣destine election took an oath of secrecy, on which their success was supposed to depend. Reginald, with∣out regarding this obligation, no sooner arrived on the continent than, giving way to the dictates of vanity, he promulgated his elevation, as well as the intent of the journey; and, when he arrived at Rome, Innocent refused to confirm him, until he should be better in∣formed of the affair.</P>
<P>This pontiff had already, on pretence of reliev∣ing the Christians in the Holy Land,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1207.</NOTE> laid a tax upon the English church, which being levied with∣out murmurs, he was encouraged to exert the same power
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>for his own private advantage. With this view he had, during the vacancy of the metropolitan see, sent John Ferentino as his legate into England; and a national synod was called at St. Alban's, though a royal mandate put a stop to their proceedings: but while John was abroad in Guienne, the legate convoked another at Reading, where he laid an imposition on the clergy, amounting to a considerable sum, with which he made his retreat before the King's return. This was such an agreeable sample of what might be drawn from Eng∣land, that Innocent resolved to fill the vacant arch∣bishopric with one of his creatures, who would sup∣port his authority. He therefore recommended to the deputies of the convent, Stephen Langton, a Roman cardinal of English descent, though bred in Paris; and when the monks observed that their commission did not extend to an election, which indeed they durst not undertake without the King's consent, and express powers from their convent; the Pope over-ruled all their objections, and commanded them to chuse Lang∣ton, on pain of excommunication. Thus threatened, eleven of the number complied: and Stephen was consecrated by Innocent at Viterbo.</P>
<P>The ceremony being performed, the Pope wrote a courtly letter of recommendation in his favour to the King, whom he presented with a few baubles to avert his indignation: at the same time, the monks of Christ-church were enjoined upon their obedience to receive Langton as their archbishop; and other letters were written to the chief nobility, soliciting their good offices with the King, in behalf of that prelate. All these precautions were insufficient to appease the wrath of John, who forthwith sent a body of troops to expel the monks of Canterbury, and hang them, should they refuse to quit the kingdom immediately. They were obliged to embark for Flanders without delay; their effects were seized, their tenants ejected, and their places supplied with some monks belonging
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>to the abbey of St. Augustin. In answer to the Pope's letter, John gave him to understand, that he was de∣termined to maintain the honour of his crown, and support the election of the bishop of Norwich; and that if his holiness should thwart him in this particular, he would suffer no appeals in ecclesiastical disputes to be carried before any foreign court of judicature. Innocent, far from being intimidated by these menaces, sent orders for the bishops of London, Worcester, and Ely, to exhort the King in his name to receive arch∣bishop Langton, and recal the monks of Christ church; and, in case of his refusal, to lay the kingdom under an interdict. John was terrified by the declaration of these prelates, and offered to obey the Pope's orders, with a salvo of his rights, dignity, and prerogative: but Innocent would hear of no salvo, or other terms, than his delivery of the regalia with his own hand to archbishop Langton, and his making immediate and full restitution to the convent. The King rejected his proposal; and the three prelates having laid the king∣dom under an interdict, retired to the continent, whi∣ther they were followed by the bishops of Bath and Hereford. A stop was immediately put to divine ser∣vice, and the administration of all the sacraments but baptism: church-doors were shut, and the dead buried in ditches and highways, without the usual rites, or any funeral solemnity. Notwithstanding this interdict, the Cistercian order continued to perform divine service publicly: the censures was slighted by the bishops of Winchester and Norwich: some of the parochial clergy still officiated, and several learned divines preached against the injustice of the Pope's proceedings.</P>
<P>John was equally enraged and terrified at the prospect of being excommunicated by name,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A D. 1208.</NOTE> and seeing his subjects absolved of their alle∣giance. He ordered all the prelates, clergy and their abettors, who observed the interdict, to leave the
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>kingdom, and seized their lands and revenues; though this order was soon revoked.</P>
<P>John convoking an assembly of all the abbots and chiefs of religious orders through the king∣dom,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1210.</NOTE> extorted from the above an hundred thousand pounds sterling. The Cistercians pleading their privilege, and refusing to pay their proportion, he fleeced them to such a degree, that almost all their houses were reduced to beggary, except the convent of Beaulieu in Hampshire, which he himself had founded, as an act of penance for the murther of Arthur, and that of Margam in Glamorganshire, where he had been sumptuously entertained in his way to Ireland, and at his return: these were exempted from the im∣positions; but all the other Cistercians were not only impoverished, but debarred all correspondence with their order abroad. Indeed an embargo was laid upon the shipping in all the ports of England, to prevent an intercourse of persons between this kingdom and the continent, without an immediate licence: and a pro∣clamation was published, requiring all English bishops and ecclesiastics, residing in foreign parts, to return at a certain time, otherwise their benefices would be seized for the King's use; the prohibition was like∣wise renewed, against all exercise of the papal autho∣rity in England, on pain of corporal punishment. Not contented with setting the Pope at defiance, and the contributions he had already received, he laid another talliage on the clergy, to defray the expence of an expedition against the Welsh, who had made some incursions over the English borders. He accord∣ingly assembled a numerous army at Oswestre, and ad∣vancing along the sea-coast as far as Conway, burned Bangor, and committed such ravages in the country, that Llewellyn prince of North-Wales, who had reti∣red with his people, cattle, and effects, into the moun∣tains of Snowdun in Caernarvonshire, seeing his country desolate, sent his wife Jane, the King's own natural
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>daughter, to sue for peace, which was granted,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1211.</NOTE> on condition of his paying twenty thousand head of cattle, forty horses. delivering hostages, and doing homage; so that John returned in triumph to Whitchurch; and levied a scutage upon all knights who had not attended him in the expedition.</P>
<P>The Pope, at his request, had sent Pandulf, a Ro∣man subdeacon, and Durand, a knight templar, into England, to accommodate all differences between the regal and pontifical powers; and John now assembled a general council of his lay nobility at Northampton, to treat with these deputies: but, as he still refused to make full restitution to the clergy, they returned to France, after having published his excommunication. Nevertheless, he did not despair of being recon∣ciled to the Pope upon easier terms,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1212.</NOTE> and ordered some of his chaplains to accompany the nun∣cios to Rome, with powers and instructions for ef∣fecting a solid peace. Mean while, in a conference at Durham, he renewed the alliance with William King of Scotland, whose son Alexander, now fourteen years of age, attended him to London, where the King knighted him at Clerkenwell; and, at the same time, received the homage of Alan lord of Galloway, for a large tract of country, given to that nobleman in the north of Ireland.</P>
<P>The King had no reason to expect extraordinary proofs of attachment from his nobility, who generally despised his character, and abhorred his administration. He had made too free with their wives and daugh∣ters, impoverished them by taxes, seized their estates, and insulted their persons: he had even ventured to make a general inquisition into the demesnes of the crown, as possessed by his predecessors: an odious measure at all times; but extremely alarming in the reign of such a tyrant as John, who they knew would seize the least flaw or defect in their titles, as a pretence for depriving them of their fortunes; so that he was
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>at once the object of their terror and contempt. Want∣ing nothing but an opportunity to shake off his yoke, they were rejoiced at the censures passed against him by the Pope, who they imagined would pursue his blow, and send an army to their relief, in imitation of the crusade, which he had raised against the Albi∣genses. Had Simon de Monfort compleated the re∣duction, of this people, in all probability the Pope would have sent that renowned general, with his vic∣torious forces, into England; but, as the war in Lan∣guedoc was still unfinished, the English nobility, im∣patient of delay, entered into an association against John; and by an authentic deed, signed and sealed by every individual of the confederacy, invited Philip King of France to come over, and receive the crown of England, which they would assist him in wresting from the usurper.</P>
<P>While John shielded himself against the ma∣chinations of his enemies,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1213.</NOTE> cardinal Langton, with the exiled bishops of London and Ely, repaired to Rome, and earnestly intreated the Pope to proceed to the deposition of John, whom they represented as a mon∣ster and tyrant, the object of universal hate and abhor∣rence. Innocent, in compliance with their request, as∣sembled a council of cardinals and prelates, in which he solemnly deposed John, and declared the throne of Eng∣land vacant: then he wrote to Philip King of France, enjoining him to execute the sentence, and unite Eng∣land to his dominions for ever. He at the same time published a crusade against the deposed monarch all over Europe, exhorting the nobility, knights, and all men whatsoever, to take up arms against that persecu∣tor of the church, and enlist under the banners of Philip, bestowing upon them the same indulgences that were granted to those who engaged against the in∣fidels in the Holy-Land: and, lastly, he appointed Pandulf, his legate a latere, to see the sentence put in execution. Not but that he supplied him at the
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>same time with instructions and powers to make peace with John upon certain conditions, which if he should delay accepting, till a certain day fixed for his final resolve, the legate was ordered to return immedi∣ately.</P>
<P>Soon after Pandulf, who then resided at Rome, wrote to his majesty, to assure him of his hearty desire to employ his good offices in his behalf, and proposing a conference to settle the terms of his reconciliation with the church. John immediately embraced the propo∣sal, and met the legate at Dover, where in a conference Pandulf expatiated upon the prodigious armament of Philip, the influence of the exiled prelates and nobility, who would accompany that monarch in his expedition, and the dissatisfaction of the English, who had invited him to engage in such an undertaking. John, con∣scious of his own guilt and unpopular character, was frightened at the picture he drew, and was so terrified by these concurring considerations, that he agreed to the legate's proposals of peace; and swore to the ob∣servance of them, in presence of the count of Boulogne, the earls of Salisbury, Warrenne, and Ferrers, who likewise promised, upon oath, to concur in the execu∣tion of the articles, to the following effect: King John shall admit into his favour archbishop Langton, and be reconciled to the exiled prelates, who shall resume their functions, and exercise their authority without in∣terruption: Robert Fitzwalter, Eustace de Vesci, and all others both of the clergy and laity, concerned in the association, shall be pardoned, and restored to their honours and estates; full restitution shall be made of all liberty and property which has been taken away in the course of this dispute; eight thousand pounds shall be immediately remitted in part of restitution to the ex∣iled prelates, for the payment of their debts and the expence of their return; and their agents shall be put into immediate possession of their effects and temporali∣ties; John shall release all homage exacted from the
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>vassals since the interdict; reverse all sentences pro∣nounced against clergymen or laymen on account of this dispute; and oblige himself to refrain from issuing writs of outlawry against churchmen for the future; all disputes about damages shall be determined by the legate, or be referred to the Pope's decision.</P>
<P>Though this reconciliation with the Pope removed all ecclesiastical censures from the King and kingdom, and freed John from all the odium and danger which attended the resentment of the clergy, it could not pre∣vent the invasion of Philip, nor appease the discontents of the nobility, who had engaged to assist that monarch in his endeavours to ascend the English throne. These alarming circumstances still remained; and it required a very extraordinary expedient to prevent the mischief that might ensue. No scheme occurred so feasible as that of putting his kingdom under the protection of the Roman see, by which it would be screened from all attempts of christian invaders; at least it would trans∣late the odium from John to his enemies; and perhaps the artillery of the church might become as terrible to the monarch of France, as it had been to the King of England. John, finding himself reduced to the alter∣native of reigning as a vassal to the Pope, or of being deposed altogether, and treated as a murderer, usurper, and tyrant, had no room for hesitation. He resolved to do homage to Innocent; and the ceremony was per∣formed in the house of the Templars at Dover. He resigned his crown to the Pope's legate, and received it again as a present from the see of Rome, to which he swore fealty as a vassal and feudatory. He obliged him∣self and his heirs to pay an acknowledgment of the pope's superiority; and, in lieu of service, an annual tribute of seven hundred marks for the kingdom of England, and three hundred for Ireland: but, even in this act of submission, he reserved to himself and his heirs the power of administering justice, and all his rights and regalities. This shameful ceremony was performed on
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>ascension-day, in the midst of a great concourse of peo∣ple, who beheld it with shame and indignation. John, in doing homage to the Pope, presented a sum of money to his representative, which the proud legate trampled under his feet as a mark of the King's de∣pendence. Every spectator glowed with resentment; and the archbishop of Dublin exclaimed aloud against such intolerable insolence. Pandulf, not satisfied with this mortifying act of superiority, kept the crown and scepter five whole days, and then restored them as the special favour of the holy see. John was despised be∣fore this extraordinary resignation; but now he was looked upon as a contemptible wretch, unworthy to sit upon the throne; while he himself seemed altoge∣ther insensible of his disgrace; nor did his pride and cruelty abate in consequence of this humiliation: he seemed to triumph in his having preserved his crown in spite of the prediction of the hermit, who had been imprisoned with a view to punish him, in case he should be found to have deceived the people with a false pro∣phecy; and now, though it was plainly verified, he ordered him to be hanged as an impostor.</P>
<P>The nobles and barons of the kingdom reviled him as a scandalous vassal of the Pope, to whom he had given up the independence of the kingdom. They employed all their arts and emissaries to kindle a spirit of revolt in the nation; and as every baron saw his own advantage connected with the success of their scheme, there was not a nobleman of any consequence in the king∣dom, who did not either personally engage in the de∣sign, or at least wish well to the undertaking. Their guards and stations being properly disposed, and all suspicious persons secured, they wrote circular letters to all the nobility and gentlemen, who had not yet declared in their favour, inviting them to espouse their cause, and fight for their liberties; and threatening, in case of refusal, to destroy their castles and estates; an alternative which had such an effect upon those to
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>whom it was proposed, that the majority of them re∣paired forthwith to London to engage in the asso∣ciation.</P>
<P>When they rejected John's offers to abolish any evil customs which might have been introduced in his reign, or in that of his brother Richard, and to re∣dress their grievances by the advice of his council, he appealed to Langton and his suffragans, desiring them to fulminate the thunder of the church upon those who had taken arms against a prince engaged in the crusade, whose person and dominions were accounted sacred. Pandulf thought his request was reasonable: but the archbishop declared, he would not pass any censure upon the barons, while John expressed a suspicion of the fidelity of his own subjects, in sending for a body of mercenary auxiliaries from the continent; though if he would dismiss those foreigners, he would not only excommunicate his enemies, but even join him per∣sonally in opposing them. Langton himself was at the head of the confederacy, and made this proposal on purpose to deprive John of all foreign assistance. The scheme succeeded. The King disbanded a great body of Germans and Flemings, whom he had retained in his service: but still the archbishop refused to excom∣municate the revolting barons. Finding himself thus outwitted and betrayed, and the defection almost uni∣versal, he thought it was better to reign as a limited prince, than sacrifice his crown, and perhaps his life, to the prerogative. He offered to refer the dispute to four noblemen chosen from each party, under the ar∣bitration of the Pope; and this proposal being reject∣ed, he submitted at discretion, promising to grant their demands, and desiring they would meet his com∣missioners to conclude the treaty on Runamede, be∣tween Staines and Windsor. There the barons ap∣peared with a vast number of knights and warriors, on the fifteenth day of June; and commissioners on both sides being appointed, the conferences began: but as
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>the King's agents were generally in the interest of the barons, no debates ensued; and, in a few days, by the mediation of Langton, they adjusted the articles of the tow famous charters, called Magna Charta, and Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a de Foresta, which are the foundation of the English liberty and constitution; or rather the confirmation and augmentation of those rights and privileges, which the prelates and barons had enjoyed under the Saxon monarchs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were, a right to dispose of their personal estates, and of their daughters, sisters, and nieces, in marriage, without paying a fine for a licence; the liberty of widows to marry; exemption of the ploughs on their demesnes from talliage; reduction of reliefs to a reasonable sum; vesting the custody of minors in their nearest re∣lations; and quitting claim to the profits of the vacancy of churches. Mat. Paris.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The great charter confirmed that which was lately granted to the clergy, touching the freedom of elec∣tions; allowed persons to leave the kingdom without a special licence, except in time of war; ordained that no clergyman should be amerced in proportion to his ecclesiastical benefice, but only according to his lay tenement; secured to the lay nobility the custody of vacant abbies and convents, which were under their patronage; fixed the reliefs for earldoms, baronies, and knights fees, which before were arbitrary; decreed that barons should recover the lands of their vassals forfeited for felony, after they should have been a year and a day in possession of the crown; that they should enjoy the wardships of their military tenants, who held other lands of the crown by a different tenure; that a person knighted by the King, though a minor, should enjoy the privileges of a full-grown man, provided he was a ward of the crown; but such knighthood con∣ferred upon the ward of a baron, should not deprive that baron of the benefit of his wardship; that widows should not be forced to marry against their inclinations, or pay any fine for their dowers; that the wardships of
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>minors should not be sold; that the guardians should not take unreasonable profits from the lands of his ward, or commit waste, but keep the houses in good repair, leave the farms well stocked, and give away the ward in marriage without disparagement; that no scutage or aid should be levied in the kingdom, with∣out the consent of the common council of the realm, except in case of ransoming the King's person, knight∣ing his eldest son, and marrying his daughter; that no freeman should be taken, imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or free customs, but by the law∣ful judgment of his peers, or by legal process; that sheriffs should not hold county-courts above once a month; and that they, as well as castellans, coroners, and king's bailiffs, should be restrained from holding pleas of the crown: that the sheriffs having the management of the crown-revenue within their several districts, should not raise the farms of counties, hun∣dreds, and tythings, according to their pleasure, ex∣cept in the King's demesne manors; that the people should not be maliciously prosecuted and put to cano∣nical purgations without legal proof, in regard to car∣riages, purveyance of victuals, and other services; that amerciaments should be proportioned to the offence and circumstances of the offender, so as not to affect his landed estate, or disable him from following his vocation, but be rated by a verdict of twelve creditable men in the neightbourhood. The Charta de Foresta was intended to prevent the extortion of foresters; to allow freeholders to improve their lands and woods within the limits of the forest; to disforest all lands taken in since the coronation of Henry I. except the crown demesnes; to regulate the forest courts; to exempt those that lived without the forests from the trouble of attending those courts, except when sum∣moned for some transgression; to annul all outlawries for such transgressions; and to convert the penalty for
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>killing venison, from a capital punishment to a fine, or in case of insolvency to a year's imprisonment.</P>
<P>These articles being established, a number of the nobility applied to John for the restitution of lands, and the government of castles which belonged to them by hereditary right; and he appointed an inquisition to examine their pretensions; but, in the mean time, he gave up the castle of Rochester to archbishop Lang∣ton, as a government which of old belonged to the see of Canterbury. Orders were now issued for the ob∣servance of the peace, and the charters over all Eng∣land; John remitted all crimes and transgressions com∣mitted from the foregoing Easter to the conclusion of the treaty; and the barons renewed their homage, which they had publickly renounced at the beginning of their revolt. Nevertheless, they would not comply with his desire, of having a certificate of this homage under their hands and seals; and he was not a little alarmed at their refusal.</P>
<P>In the history of John's reign we have been so cir∣cumstantial in relating his disputes with the Pope, that very few ecclesiastical affairs, of any consequence, re∣main to be recorded. The Pope being desirous of levying an extraordinary Romescot, or St. Peter's Penny,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1206.</NOTE> the Bishops assembled a Synod to deli∣berate upon his demand; but the King forbid∣ding them to proceed, they separated, without coming to any resolution. Nevertheless, a legate, named Florentine, convoked another council at Reading, upon the same subject; and, as if the clergy had in∣fluenced the King's refusal, he extorted from them a subsidy in lieu of the extraordinary Romescot, which would have affected the whole kingdom. We have already mentioned the councils that were assembled, to regulate the restitution to the exiled bishops after John's reconciliation with his holiness; but we shall take notice of the twelfth council of the Lateran, held, during this, by Pope Innocent III. at which four
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>hundred and twelve bishops assisted. This assembly enacted fourscore canons; one of which, in formal terms, establishes the doctrine of Transubstantiation; but the third seems to have been calculated for raising the ecclesiastical power on the ruins of all civil right and authority. By this the Council decreed, that all sovereigns should be required and solicited, and, if need were, constrained by ecclesiastical censures, to promise upon oath, that they would exert their en∣deavours to exterminate heretics from their domi∣nions: That the same oath should be exacted from all persons promoted to any dignity, spiritual or tempo∣ral: That if any temporal lord refused to purge his country, or demesnes, of heretics, after having been sum∣moned for that purpose, he should be excommunicated by the metropolitan, assisted by his suffragans; in case of contempt, or refusal of satisfaction within one year, that the Pope should declare his subjects and vassals absolved from their oath of allegiance, and at the same time exhort the catholic princes to fall upon his terri∣tories, saving the right of paramount to the sovereign of the fief, provided there should be such right; on condition, however, that the sovereign should do no∣thing to the prejudice of this canon. In the fourteenth it was decreed, that priests who abandoned themselves to debauchery, in those places where marriage was per∣mitted, should be more severely punished than those who lived in countries where they were obliged to pro∣fess celibacy. From which article we learn, that the celibacy of the priests was not universally established.</P>
<P>John was, in his person, taller than the middle size, of a good shape, and agreeable countenance. With respect to his disposition, it is strongly delineated in the transactions of his reign. If his understanding was contemptible, his heart was the object of detestation: we find him slothful, shallow, proud, imperious, sud∣den, rash, cruel, vindictive, perfidious, cowardly, libidinous, and inconstant: abject in adversity, and
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>overbearing in success; condemned and hated by his subjects, over whom he tyrannized to the utmost of his power; abhorred by the clergy, whom he oppressed with exactions; and despised by all the neighbouring princes of Europe. Tho' he might have passed thro' life without incurring such a load of odium and con∣tempt, had not his reign been perplexed by the tur∣bulence of his barons, the rapaciousness of the Pope, and the ambition of such a monarch as Philip Au∣gustus, his character could never have afforded one quality that would have exempted him from the dis∣gust and scorn of his people. Nevertheless it must be owned, that his reign is not altogether barren of lauda∣ble transactions. He regulated the form of the civil government in the city of London, and several other places in the kingdom: he was the first who coined sterling money, introduced the laws of England into Ireland, and granted to the Cinque-ports those privi∣leges of which they are still possessed.</P>

<HEAD>HENRY III. A. D. 1215.</HEAD>
<P>I have been more large in the history of the preceding reign, as it was attended with many remarkable cir∣cumstances prejudicial to the prerogatives of the British crown, and the rights and liberties of the sub∣jects. This kingdom would probably, nay, must in∣evitably been made a province of France, either by the cowardice and imprudent measures of King John, or the precipitant, impolitic resentment of the barons, were it not for the interposition of the Pope; who plainly saw, it would give the balance of power in Europe into the hands of the French, which must con∣sequently be prejudicial to the power and secular inte∣rests of his holiness, and, therefore, very politicly op∣posed the King of France's accepting the invitation of the barons to the crown of England: but, as the se∣cular interest of the Pope was a point always connected
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>with, and pursued in conjunction with his ecclesiastical authority; so we find he had, by much artifice, pretty well carried his point in that reign; and, in the reign of Henry III. carried his design to greater perfection, insomuch that the nation complained, with the highest reason, of their great oppression, and impositions of the papal see.</P>
<P>A variety of circumstances made way for the acces∣sion of Henry III. to the crown, though but ten years of age; but principally thro' the interest and persua∣sion of William earl Marshall earl of Pembroke: a person of great understanding, well versed in the civil affairs of the nation, the particular interests of parties, and well affected to the interests of Great Britain; so that in a little more than twelve months, he reduced the disaffected, and brought the nation in general to approve of the choice of their King, and of his regen∣cy; the citizens of London acting in harmony and concurrence with him. For several years nothing re∣markable occurred relating to ecclesiastical affairs; former disputes, and the difficulty of adjusting them, having pretty much engrossed the attention of the re∣gent and ministry.</P>
<P>About the year A. D. 1228, Gregory IX. succeeded to the papacy, at the death of Honorius III. who was survived but a few months by Stephen Langton arch∣bishop of Canterbury. This prelate's eyes were no sooner closed than the monks of St. Augustin, in order to preserve their privilege, elected one of their brothers, called Walter de Hemisham, without even demanding the King's permission. Henry therefore refused to confirm his election, on pretence of his fa∣ther's having been hanged for felony; and the suffra∣gans of Canterbury, who likewise pretended to the right of electon, found a pretext for refusing to own this new archbishop, who it seems had debauched a nun, by whom he had several children. Agents were sent with appeals to Rome; but the Pope declined de∣ciding
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>the dispute, until he should be better informed of the particulars; and in the mean time the see re∣mained vacant. His holiness at that time could not attend to such petty contests, so much was he engrossed by his quarrel with Frederic II. emperor of Germany, whom he now excommunicated for having deferred his voyage to the Holy-Land, according to the oath he had taken. This sentence excited such commotions in Germany and Italy, that Frederic was obliged to per∣form his vow. France was at the same time embroiled by the regency of Blanche; and had Henry been an enterprizing prince, he might have taken the advantage of this conjuncture, to retrieve his paternal possessions on the continent. The Normans, who had engaged in the interest of the French barons, against the re∣gency, assured the King of England, that if he would cross the seas, they would receive him with open arms. The Poitevens pressed him to take possession of their country; in which case they would assist him in ex∣pelling the French garrisons; and the Gascons depu∣ted the archbishop of Bourdeaux to invite him to come and recover the inheritance of Guienne. Such pressing invitations one would imagine should have been very acceptable to any prince of common cou∣rage and discretion; especially to one who had no do∣mestic troubles to fear: for Henry had just concluded a peace with Llewellyn, a prince of Wales, who had made some incursions upon the English borders. Nevertheless, he declined their proposals, declaring that he would chuse a more proper opportunity; whereas, such another could not be expected during the whole course of his reign; and he afterwards rashly undertook the expedition, without the least pro∣bability of success.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Pope still delayed giving judg∣ment in the dispute concerning the archbishopric of Canterbury, until the King's envoys made an offer to the Pope of the tenth of all moveables in England
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>and Ireland. This proposition threw a new light upon the contest, and his holiness immediately annulled the election of the monks; but at the same time he ar∣rogated to himself the power of filling up the vacancy, appointing by his own authority Richard le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ant chancellor of the church of Lincoln, to the archie∣piscopal dignity; and this prelate was recognized by the King and suffragans, who on this occasion betrayed the rights of the Anglican church. In a little time after this transaction, the Pope sent over one of his chaplains to collect the promised tythe, in order to support a war against the emperor; and he presented the Pontiff's letter to the great council of the kingdom, desiring that this aid might be levied without delay. All the members were astonished at the proposal, and turned their eyes upon the King, expecting that he would disclaim the conduct of his envoys, who had made such an extravagant promise: but they soon per∣ceived by his silence, that the offer had been made by his direction; and in the first transports of their indig∣nation, resolved that their vassals should not be exposed to any such exaction. Nevertheless, as a mark of their respect to his holiness, they agreed to grant him a donation, without proceeding to any inquiry into the effects of individuals. They were, however, diverted from executing this resolution, by the behaviour of Stephen Seagrave, one of the richest and most popular members of the assembly, who voluntarily submitted to the tax; and a great number was influenced by his example, till at last the whole council, including ec∣clesiastics as well as laymen, acquiesced in the de∣mand, rather than incur the wrath of the King, and censures of Gregory. This point being settled, the nuncio produced a commission, investing him with full power to levy the tax upon all moveables what∣soever. He forthwith proceeded to the execution of his orders, and exacted the tythe with such rigour, that the people were obliged to pay ready money for
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>the fruits of the earth even while growing: the pre∣lates and abbots were compelled to advance the tax for their inferior clergy; and, as they could not con∣veniently raise the sums demanded, they were supplied by Italian usurers, whom the nuncio had brought along with him for this purpose. The earl of Chester, however, insisted upon his prerogative of palatine, and would not suffer the nuncio, or any of his agents, to set foot within his territories. The King and the Pope seemed to have a fellow-feeling in this collection; and in all probability shared the money that was levied, according to a previous resolution to fleece the people in concert; for they afterwards supported each other reciprocally, in all their mutual schemes of extortion.</P>
<P>This with some former efforts of this young prince, were very unfavourable and dissatisfactory to the people.</P>
<P>In A. D. 1231, the court of Rome having used its influence in a very unpopular manner, that a general clamour arose all over England, against the practice of bestowing benefices upon Italian priests, and inhibi∣ting English bishops, and lay-patrons to present na∣tives, until those foreigners should be preferred. This was considered as a national insult and grievance, and a number of associations were formed for delivering the kingdom from such shameful oppression. Circular letters were sent to bishops and chapters, warning them against favouring such encroachments, on pain of having their houses burned, and their farms destroyed.</P>
<P>While the pope's representations squeezed money from the ecclesiastics of England, the laity were plun∣dered by the king's exactions. The pope, and his vassal Henry, seemed to vie with each other in pil∣laging the people; and nothing could have induced the English to suffer such oppression under a king of Henry's contemptible character, but the dread of pa∣pal resentment, and the remembrance of those miseries in which civil war had so lately involved the kingdom.
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>The bishops held another convocation at London, where they presented a remonstrance to the king, com∣plaining that he converted the vacant bishoprics to his own use, and retarded the elections by raising unjust obstacles, until his own choice was approved by the chapters; nay, they even proceeded so far as to excom∣municate those who gave him this pernicious counsel: but he placed such confidence in the protection of the pope, that very little regard was paid to their repre∣sentations: he was even so base and degenerate as to glory in his dependance on the Roman see; and when the emperor sent an embassy to expostulate with him about his having published the sentence of excommu∣nication, he replied that he was vassal to the pope, whose injunctions he durst not disobey. Mean while the legate, on his return from Scotland, renewed his arbitrary exactions, levying considerable sums from churches and monasteries, under the title of Procura∣tions; and at length published a mandate, importing, that he had a power not only to absolve from their vow such as had taken the cross intending to visit the Holy-Land, but also of compelling them to redeem them∣selves with money, on pain of excommunication. These extortions were countenanced and seconded by the pope's own immediate directions. He granted to the abbot and monks of Clugny a tenth of the profits arising from all benefices in England, for the term of three years. But even Henry was ashamed of this im∣position, and forbade the agents to collect it, on pain of incurring severe penalties. His holiness, far from being repulsed by this prohibition, attempted to raise a fifth of all ecclesiastical revenues, as an aid against the emperor, and accordingly exacted it from the Roman clergy settled in England, who durst not refuse it to a power on which they altogether depended: it was af∣terwards proposed to the prelates in a council at Read∣ing, and granted by the advice and example of Ed∣mund archbishop of Canterbury. But immediately
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>after this transaction, Gregory bargained with the peo∣ple of Rome for their assistance against the emperor, on condition of his providing their children and rela∣tions with English benefices; and he sent orders to Ed∣mund, and the bishops of London and Sarum, to re∣serve for the Roman clergy three hundred of the first livings that should fall vacant in England, on pain of being suspended from the power of collating. Ed∣mund was extremely chagrined at this flagrant instance of insolent imposition, of which he bitterly complained to Henry, from whom receiving no redress, he grew weary of his life, retired to Burgundy, where he died, and was buried in the abbey of Pontigny.</P>
<P>The king resolved to solicit a supply from parliament, which,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1244.</NOTE> though always averse to him in the beginning of every session, he generally found means to convert to his purpose by promises of reformation. At present he was furnished with a pre∣tence by the king of Navarre, who had invaded Gas∣cony, and some incursions of the Welsh. The barons being assembled at Westminster, he himself made the motion for a subsidy, which was heard with manifest signs of discontent. The prelates and the laity retiring separately, resolved that no grant should be made with∣out their common consent; and that a committee of twelve persons should be chosen to consider of proper measures to prevent all encroachments on the two char∣ters. They complained that writs had been issued out of chancery to the prejudice of their liberties; desired that they might have the nomination of the chancellor and justiciary; proposed that four noblemen of the king's council should be appointed conservators of the liberty of the kingdom, with power to inspect the trea∣sury, and the application of the public money; to sum∣mon a parliament as often as necessity should require; and arbitrate in all differences between the king and his subjects. They demanded that all writs contrary to the custom of the realm should be revoked; that
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>censures should be published against all that opposed these regulations; that the chancellor and justiciary, chosen by consent of parliament, should always be two of the four conservators; that in case the king should deprive the chancellor of the seals, all writs signed by his successor should be null; that besides the chancel∣lor and justiciary, the parliament should nominate two judges in the common pleas, two barons in the exche∣quer, and a justice of the Jews; and that all suspected persons should be removed from about the king's per∣son. Henry was extremely alarmed at the nature of these demands, which did not at all suit with his high notions of the prerogative. He was incensed at the presumption of his vassals; but such was his character and situation, that he durst not avow his resentment. He therefore evaded their proposals with general pro∣mises of amendment, which he had no intention to perform; and after having tampered in vain with the members, thought proper to prorogue the parliament.</P>
<P>About the year A. D. 1250, the fashion of taking the cross was so prevalent at this juncture, that Henry himself, in the midst of all his necessities, professed himself a soldier of Christ: though, in all probability, this step was the effect of some other motive more cogent than his religion. Perhaps he saw no other prospect of paying his debts, which were by this time become very burthensome and disgraceful, than that of obtaining a subsidy on pretence of equipping an arma∣ment for Palestine; or else he was desirous of putting himself under the Pope's protection, which he thought would screen him from the designs that might be hatched to his prejudice. He seemed to suspect some∣thing of this kind, from the ambition of his brother Richard, who had made a mysterious journey to Rome, accompanied by the earl of Gloucester, and several no∣blemen and prelates. He had been caressed by the Pope at Lyons, who admitted him to several private conferences, the subject of which afforded great specu∣lation;
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>and, as he had always been the chief of the malcontents, Henry might very naturally suspect him of some design to his prejudice. When Henry took the cross, his example was followed by five hundred knights, some of whom had sold their estates to desray the expence of their voyage; and they expressed the utmost impatience to set out upon the expedition: but as the King was not yet in a condition to perform his vow, he forbad them to cross the sea, until he him∣self should depart; and this prohibition was, at his desire, confirmed by the Pope. At the same time, his holiness indulged him with the grant of a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues in England and Ireland for three years, to be levied and deposited until the King should set out upon his voyage.</P>
<P>Honorius II. sent cardinal John de Crema into Eng∣land, with the title of legate; but it was not without great difficulty that he was received, after having stay∣ed a long time in Normandy. He assembled a synod at London, touching the marriage of priests; but in the writs of summons it was expressly declared, that the council was convoked by the order and with the concurrence of the archbishop of Canterbury. Al∣though this legate knew his arrival was not at all agree∣able to the English, he affected, in the exercise of his legation, an insolence of deportment which not a little increased their disgust. He insisted upon officiating in the church of Canterbury, altho' he was not a bishop; and in the council of London he ordered his seat to be raised like a throne, above the two archbishops and all the nobility of the kingdom. In the reign of Stephen, Alberic bishop of Ostia was received as the Pope's le∣gate in England without opposition, because the King was so precariously situated that he durst not oppose the innovations of Rome. While this prince sat upon the throne, the Pope invested his brother Henry bishop of Winchester with the legatine power, to the preju∣dice of Theobald archbishop of Canterbury This
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>distinction produced a quarrel between the two prelates, from which the court of Rome derived great advan∣tages; for, upon this occasion, both parties appealed to the Roman see, which before that time had been very little troubled with English disputes and refer∣ences. After a long contest, the bishop of Winches∣ter was deprived of his legation by Pope Celestin II who conferred it upon his rival as a free gift of the ho∣ly see. The court of Rome would, in all probability have extended its usurpation still farther, had not the schisms which happened in this age kept its ambition within bounds. After the death of Honorius, there was a double election of Innocent and Anaclet, who divided all Europe with their competition; and both France and England observed for some time a neutra∣lity, during which time they paid no regard to ei∣ther.</P>
<P>But what Rome lost by schisms, she regained by crusades, which never failed to extend her authority▪ The first was preached by Urban II. with such effect, that a vast army of Christians, from all parts of Eu∣rope, took the cross and set out for Palestine. from whence they expelled the Saracens, and founded the kingdom of Jerusalem, which lasted about ninety years: but the country was afterwards reconquered by the infidels; and, in order to regain the footing which the Christians had lost, divers new crusades were insti∣tuted, from which the Popes drew manifold advan∣tages. These expeditions furnished them with pretexts to intermeddle in all the affairs of christendom; to di∣vert princes from other designs, which were incompa∣tible with the papal interest or ambition; to impose taxes on the clergy of different kingdoms; and to de∣stroy those potentates who presumed to oppose their usurpations; for they pretended that it was as necessa∣ry for the glory of God to exterminate heretics as to war against infidels; and as it was their peculiar pre∣rogative to determine what was and what was not he∣resy,
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>they had it always in their power to publish and preach up crusades against such princes as incurred their displeasure.</P>
<P>As the authority of the Popes increased, that of the prelates and national synods visibly diminished; for by an appeal to the see of Rome their canons and ordi∣nances were frequently annulled and reversed. The bishop of Winchester exercised the legatine authority; by virtue of which he convoked a council at London, in presence of his brother Stephen, when it was decreed, among other canons for church-discipline, that a per∣son, who violated a church or church-yard, or laid vio∣lent hands on a clerk, should not be absolved by any prelate but the Pope himself; and that husbandmen should enjoy the same peace in the fields to which they were intitled in the church-yard.</P>
<P>The Popes had no sooner rendered themselves absolute masters of the church, than it was deluged with an inundation of religious orders, which might be com∣pared to different bands of an army, raised to support the power and grandeur of the Roman pontiffs. The council of the Lateran had endeavoured to prevent, or reform this abuse, by expressly forbidding the in∣stitution of any new order of monks. Nevertheless, Dominic Gusman, a Spaniard, who had long preached against the Albigenses, formed the scheme of a new order, under the name of the Preaching Friars, for which he demanded the confirmation of Pope Innocent III. That pontiff at first made some difficulty, on ac∣count of the prohibition; but he afterwards pretended to have had a celestial vision, by which he was given to understand, that he could not take any step that would be more advantageous to the church: neverthe∣less, the order was not confirmed till the pontificate of his successor Honorius, when it was instituted under the name of the Friars Preachers, or preaching Bro∣thers: because the individuals were destined to preach against the heretics. They were likewise distinguished

<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>by the appellation of Dominicans, from the name of their founder; and in France called Jacobins, from the street of St. Jaques, where they had their first house in Paris. They were intrusted with the care of the inquisition, and rendered themselves famous by the barbarities they committed against the pretended heretics: and they settled in England in a very little time after their institution. The order founded by Francis d'Assisi was confirmed by the some pontiff; and, in the course of the year that succeeded their confirmation, they were settled in England. The monks, out of modesty, assumed the name of Minor Brothers; and though, in the sequel, they were di∣vided into different societies, all of them owned St. Francis d'Assisi for their chief and founder. They were restricted, by their rules, from preaching or confessing in any diocese, without the permission of the bishop. This restriction, however, did not long con∣tinue: they represented to the Pope, that many Chris∣tians were ashamed to confess their sins to their own pastors; that several persons scrupled to perform their duty, because they knew the curates themselves guilty of the same transgressions; and that those priests had not discretion to keep the secrets with which they were entrusted. On these considerations, they desired and obtained a dispensation for that rule of their order. The Dominicans and Franciscans acquired such reputa∣tion for sanctity, that almost every person chose a di∣rector from one of those orders; consequently the churches they received were very considerable: for a long time the Popes were elected from one or other of those societies; so that by their credit at the court of Rome, they frequently obtained effects belonging to the other orders, on pretence of the necessity for their being subsisted. They amassed prodigious wealth from benefactions of devout people, by the threats or promises of future misery or salvation. In a council held at Rochester, a new order of monks, called
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>Cross-bearers, demanded permission to settle in Eng∣land; and produced a bull from the Pope, forbidding all persons whatsoever to reproach or molest them, and impowering them to excommunicate those who should violate that privilege. The synod did not think proper to grant their request; but sent them back, on pretence of adhering to the canon passed in the council of the Lateran.</P>
<P>The greatest part of the councils held in the reign of Henry III. were convoked, as we have elsewhere men∣tioned, to authorise and facilitate papal exactions. The Pope's legate convoked a national synod in St. Paul's church in London; and as he expected an opposition to the canon which he intended to pass against plurali∣ties, he obtained of the King a guard of two hundred men. As soon as the prelates had taken their places, he ordered the canons which he had brought from Rome to be read; and when the article prohibiting pluralities was mentioned, Walter de Chantelon, bishop of Win∣chester, and some others, opposed it with great vehe∣mence, and even made protests; so that the legate de∣clared it should remain in force only during the time of his legation: nevertheless, it was no sooner approved on this condition, than an ecclesiastic, in the legate's train, pronounced aloud a decree of the Pope's, ordain∣ing it to be observed for ever. In the other canons it was decreed, that the number of sacraments should be fixed to seven: others fixed the vigils of Easter and Pentecost, regulated the administrations of baptism, and injoined the clergy to reside at their benefices at least one half of the year. At a council held in Lon∣don, the clergy flatly refused to supply the legate with the money which he demanded for the expence of his legation; and when he assembled another synod in the course of the succeeding year, he met with no better success in demanding one-fifth part of their revenues for the use of his holiness. All the ensuing councils for the space of four years were convened on purpose to
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>demand subsidies from the clergy. During the war of the barons, one was held at Reading, in which was confirmed the appeal of the barons from the proceed∣ings of the legate, who resided at Boulogne; and in ano∣ther convened at Northampton, the legate Otho excom∣municated all the members of the clergy, who had en∣gaged in the party of the Earl of Leicester. The same cardinal assembled a national council in St. Paul's church at London, where he published certain consti∣tutions, some of which make now a part of the canon law of the English church. The first allowed laymen to administer baptism, in case of necessity; the second forbad priests to take money for the administration of the sacraments: the ninth ordained ecclesiastics to re∣side at their benefices: the thirteenth confirmed the right of sanctuary to churches: the fourteenth decreed that marriages should be celebrated in public: the twentieth forbad commutation of penance: the twenty-third prohibited the alienation of any part of the tithes due to the parochial curates: the next forbad the prac∣tice of giving benefices <HI>in commendam,</HI> and vacated all those that were bestowed in such a manner: the thirty-second ordained, that, before the consecration of a bi∣shop, inquiry should be made, whether or not he pos∣sessed several benefices without a dispensation, and whe∣ther or not the dispensation was regular and authentic? the thirty third annulled all previous bargains made be∣tween patrons and presentees.</P>
<P>It is well known how both church and common∣wealth groaned under the heavy burden of the abbey drones, whilst they became lords of very little less than one half of the temporalities of the kingdom, and the church, by their ingrossing all the best benefices. Nor was this all; for whilst they were thus munificently provided for, they evidently aimed at betraying the so∣vereignty and wealth of the kingdom, to the usurpa∣tion of a detestable foreign power.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>
<P>The nation began in general to see the corruptions of the Romish church. Enquiry shewed them how dissonant and inconsistent the principles and practices of the first five ages of the Christian church were to what prevailed at that time; that in the last ten ages ignorance had buried all their learning, only a little misguided devotion was retained for six of those ages; and in the last four the restless ambition and usurpation of the Popes were supported by the seeming holiness of the begging-friars, and the false counterfeits of learn∣ing which were among the canonists, schoolmen, and casuists.</P>
<P>The popish guides made use of a variety of artifices, for which their religion was admirably calculated to render men satisfied, in a dull, ignorant, and formal way, knowing that knowledge and learning was their common enemy, as at once discovering and overthrow∣ing all the superstructures reared upon their sandy foun∣dation. But what wealth, what honour, what power do their clergy enjoy? how glorious the Popes, how splendid the Cardinals, how promoted and favoured their kindred and friends, while they can gratify the abused multitude with infinite devices? The gloomy and melancholy they provide cells and nunneries for; the austere may take their fill of discipline and rigour; the impure and voluptuous have their conveniencies at hand, who with the lawless may be eased by dispensa∣tions; the credulous shall never want miracles; the fantastical, visions, nor the superstitious, ceremonies.</P>
<P>But as we have already taken a retrospective view of the church of Rome, we shall now more immediately confine ourselves to the unreasonable, arbitrary, and oppressive exactions of the Popish power on the rights and properties of Great Britain. History will furnish us with a variety of facts, by which it will appear very evident, that England had an extraordinary occasion to deem the papal yoke, a yoke of slavery and oppres∣sion in the most affecting instances. Some of the most
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>considerable of these we shall attempt to present the reader with, by abstracts from an impartial view of the intolerable charge of Popery to this nation.</P>
<P>The first of those gross impositions we shall mention, and have already hinted, was the grant of PETER PENCE by OFFA, King of the Mercians, about the year 790<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiq. of Britain, folio 58, 69.</NOTE>; the charter whereof remains still extant, as Sir Edward Coke affirms, in the Tower. The Peter Pence was a penny for every house in which was twenty penny worth of any kind of goods, to be paid yearly on Lammas-day<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stow's Annals, f. 26.</NOTE>. This grant was first intended as a tribute of alms to such as went on pilgrimage to Rome, and so it was received by Pope Pascal II. in his epistle to K. Henry I. yet the continuance occasioned the pre∣tence of an absolute right. But when the Pope took part with the French, King Edward III. commanded the <HI>Peter pence</HI> should be no longer; which prohibition continued during that King's reign, 'till his successor Richard II. Some offers being made to gather them again, it was referred to parliament, and by the appro∣bation of the weak King was again revived. Yet it was resolved by the casuists of that time, that as an alms it might be lawfully witholden, of which John Wickliffe was one who disapproved the payment of it: never∣theless, being indulged by the Kings, it continued to the reign of King Henry VIII. of which Sleiden takes special notice. An attempt was made again to revive it in Queen Mary's reign; and Pope Paul IV. had such an influence with her ambassador, that had she not died soon after, it is not doubted it would have been collected again<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Antiq. of Britain, p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus Peter-Pence vanished only, whereas some mo∣nasteries anciently collected some proportions of them, and then answered for so much to the Pope's collector. In process of time it became fixed as a rent or duty to
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>the said monasteries, which afterwards devolved to the crown, and from thence continued by sale or grant to others, with as ample profits as the religious houses had enjoyed. It is conceived, that at this day they are in some places paid as appendant to the manors which belonged to some such houses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Roger Twisden's Hist. Vindication, cap. 4.</NOTE>. The annual amount of those Peter-Pence is somewhat uncertain, from the manner in which they were collected. Yet it appears from a rate set upon every diocese by one of Pope Gregory V.'s bulls for that purpose, about the year 1000, that it could amount to no less than 7500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per annum</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Concil. tom. 1. folio 313.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We know also, that King Athelwolph, A. D. 852, gave a yearly pension to Rome of 300 marks; 100 for buying candles for St. Peter, 100 for ditto for St. Paul, and the other 100 as a free gift to the Pope. This was made a demand of as long after as Pope Gregory XIII. A. C. 1573, and it was then opposed as an unreasonable taxation or demand by John of Gaunt, though it had been paid for some centuries, and, for aught we find, during that long interval, more than 700 years<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Matth. Westm. in an. 855.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>First-fruits</HI> and tenths was another oppressive ex∣action of the Pope. First-fruits are the profits of every spiritual living for one year, and these were an∣ciently called annates, because the rates of first-fruits or spiritual livings is after one year's profit of the same. Tenths are the tenth part of the first-fruits or yearly value of all spiritual livings. These were paid, as in England, throughout all western Christendom. By whom these were first imposed, authors somewhat dif∣fer. As to the time, Boniface IX. about the year 1399, reserved the first-fruits of vacant churches<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Theod. à Niem. Secretary to Pope Gregory.</NOTE>. Some refer their original to Pope John XX. 1316.
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>But howsoever, or by whomsoever, they became first imposed, after the Popes had been absolutely seised of them, then they claimed them <HI>jure divino.</HI> But Pol. Virgil mentions it as demanded for support of the Pope's grandeur, and that it was one of the fairest flowers in the triple crown. The payment of these, with other great sums, so strangely impoverished the kingdom, that, notwithstanding the pretence of di∣vine right, the Kings of England were obliged to for∣bid payment, and King Edward III. discharged the Pope's nuncio from collecting it. The Pope finding how justly the English complained of their burdens, receded from the demand for some time; and Pope Urban<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pol. Virgil Hist. lib. 20. fol. 405.</NOTE> gave them to King Richard II. to aid him against Charles, the French King. This project ser∣ved to inure the people to the payment of it, and to win the favour of the King. But the policy of after-parliaments exceeded that of the Pope; for, by statute of Henry VIII. they were made a perpetual addition to the revenues of the crown<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stat. 26. cap. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>What vast sums were anciently paid to the Popes upon these accounts, we may observe at one view, from what the respective dioceses in England are rated in the King's book, and used to pay to the Pope for first-fruits.</P>

<P>Besides these ordinary and known rates, payable as fines or incomes at first entrance, it commonly hap∣pened that vast sums went to Rome before any bishop could be absolutely settled in his see<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Matth. Paris in Henry III. Antiq. of Britain.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The statute of the 25th of Henry VIII. begins with reciting, how the subjects of this realm had for many years been greatly decayed and impoverished by into∣lerable exactions of great sums of money taken and claimed by the bishop of Rome, as well in <HI>pensions, fees, Peter-pence, procurations, first-fruits, suits</HI> for <HI>provi∣sions,</HI> and <HI>expeditions</HI> of <HI>bulls,</HI> for <HI>archbishoprics</HI> and <HI>bi∣shoprics,</HI> and for <HI>delegacies</HI> and <HI>rescripts</HI> in <HI>causes of con∣tentions</HI> and <HI>appeals, jurisdictions, legantine dispensations, licences, faculties, grants, relaxations, writs of per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de valere, rehabiliations, abolitions,</HI> and other infinite sorts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the words of the statute are<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Stat. 25. cap. 21.</NOTE>, of which the most remarkable demand some account to be given of them; their nature and origin, and whatever other circumstances appear peculiar and extraordinary, with∣out
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>the tedious enumeration of facts, with their cir∣cumstances consequent thereto. We shall begin with <HI>Legantine levies.</HI> These were sums of money exacted and levied upon the King's subjects throughout the whole kingdom, by legates and officers appointed by the Pope for that purpose<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, Polychron, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and these were called for as often as the Popes pretended a need of them; for the court of Rome did inculcate, and would have the world to believe, that, being a mother, she ought to be relieved by her children<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hen. de Knighton, coll. 2489.</NOTE>. The first extraordinary contribution raised for the Pope in this kingdom ap∣pears to have been about the year 1183, when Pope Lucius III. having some quarrel with the citizens of Rome, sent to King Henry II. and his clergy, upon consultation held pursuant thereto, it was agreed, that it should be granted as an aid in the King's name only, lest it should introduce a custom that might hereafter prove detrimental to the kingdom; to which council the King adhered, and sent a great aid to the Pope in gold and silver. This regard paid by his Majesty to the sentiments of the clergy was the more necessary, as the Popes had frequently been tampering with them; and in the reign of Edward I. he prohibited the clergy from giving any thing to the King, without leave first obtained from him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, fol. 361.</NOTE>. But, notwithstand∣ing the before-mentioned caution, the Popes afterwards gained much upon the clergy, though the King and parliament disapproved of it; for Pope Gregory IX. A. D. 1229, demanded a tenth of the moveables both of clergy and laity, to which the lords did not con∣sent, but the clergy in general paid it; and eleven years after he demanded a fifth part of the goods of the clergy. This occasioned a demur; and yet, thro' the weakness of the King, and the private views of
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>the archbishop, it was complied with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, an. 1240. fol. 536.</NOTE>, which also oc∣casioned a complaint the year following, that there re∣mained not so much treasure in the kingdom as had in three years been extorted from it, the vessels and orna∣ments of the churches excepted. But notwithstand∣ing that reluctancy, and the notable remonstrance pre∣ferred in the council of Lions, 1245, from the body of the kingdom, and likewise to the Pope himself the year after, Pope Innocent IV. invented a new way of charging every religious house to furnish a number of soldiers for his service, and to fight for the church∣militant. About the same time, the Pope claimed as his right to be heir to every clerk that died intestate. He afterwards demanded 11,000 marks from the cler∣gy as a free gift, as an addition to 6000 he had received the year before, A. D. 1302, from which time the Popes seemed to study methods to impoverish the Eng∣lish clergy. About the same time commenced those grievous exactions in Ireland, demanded as a subsidy to Rome for three years by Pope Boniface VIII<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Annals of Ireland, in Camb. Brit. fol. 163</NOTE>. Neither did our Hyperborean neighbours escape scot-free in this deluge of exactions; nay, no less there would satisfy the Pope than the whole kingdom, Bo∣niface VIII. demanding the whole kingdom as a part of St. Peter's patrimony against King Edward I. and sent his bull of demand to the King for that purpose<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Tho. Walsingham's Hist. fol. 48. and Fox's Hist. of Edw. I. fol. 47. Pol. Virgil, Matt. Paris, &amp;c. and in the Tower records.</NOTE>. All this while the poor clergy were oppressed by the unlimited avarice of the Pope.</P>
<P><HI>King John's Pension</HI> may next deserve notice, in whose troublesome reign the Pope appeared sometimes for, and at other times against: but once taking ad∣vantage of the King's exigence, the King was wrought upon to surrender the crown to Pandulf, the Pope's legate and substitute; laying the same, with his scep∣ter,
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>robe, sword, and ring, the royal ensigns, at his feet; subscribing also to a charter, whereby he sur∣rendered his kingdom to the Pope, and professing, that thenceforward he would hold the crown as feuda∣tory to the Pope, and pay an annual tribute, or pen∣sion of one thousand marks, for both his kingdoms of England and Ireland. With this charter, and ten thousand pounds in hand, Pandulf goes with triumph to Rome. The annual payment was afterwards super∣seded by parliament, as an act contrary to his oath at his coronation, and the assent of his parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speed's Chron.</NOTE>. In the year 1276, Pope John sent another bull or demand to King Edward I. whereby he demanded the arrears of one thousand marks, for seven years then last past, and also for that year; whether paid or not is uncer∣tain, only sometimes a present from an easy prince.</P>
<P><HI>Appeals</HI> to the court of Rome was another way of drawing great sums out of England; and these be∣gan most considerably in the reign of King Stephen. The Pope no sooner tasted the sweets of his gains accruing this way, than all encouragement was given to appellants; so that about this time, scarce any con∣troversy of value, but one party or other would pre∣sently appeal to the Pope and court of Rome; for the management of which appeals, it was necessary to re∣tain proctors, notaries, advocates, agents, solicitors, who must all be paid here in England: and at the court of Rome were continually resident a multitude of officers, judges, clerks, secretaries, advocates, canonists, civilians, referendaries, who must all have their fees for bulls, breves, citations, commissions, sentences, references, expeditions, &amp;c.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. Paris.</NOTE>; by which means, many persons, families, and religious houses were greatly impoverished, whilst the Pope inriched him∣self with the spoils of others.</P>
<P><HI>Dispensations</HI> and <HI>Absolutions</HI> from cases reserved and faculties, were another great means of drawing vast
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>sums of money hence to Rome: and for the managing and dispensing of these, the Popes had their ministers, officers, and courts ready to make out, and grant these dispensations, to such as had occasion for them, or pleased to purchase them, in a multitude of cases; as for dispensing with a prelate holding two bishopricks or plurality of benefices; to make infants capable of benefices and offices; to legitimate bastards; to qua∣lify persons to marry within the degrees prohibited by the canons, or laws of God; to lay aside habits of professions, regular to revert to a secular state; to give liberty to live without rules, order, and discipline, which had been entered into; for liberty not to keep rash or prejudicial oaths; to eat flesh at times ordi∣narily forbidden; to wave the performances of vows; to rescind contracts, marriages, and covenants, of which innumerable instances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Matt. Paris in Hen. III. Walsingham in Edw. III. An. 1353. Camb. Annals of Elizabeth.</NOTE> and complaints against this grievance we find very frequent in our parliament histories and records<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. Paris in Hen. III. A. D. 1246.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Indulgences</HI> and <HI>Pardons</HI> was another successful device to draw money to Rome. This indulgence in the Romish church, is, they say, effected by the applica∣tion of the merits of Jesus Christ, and his saints, by the medium and method of the church, and even ap∣plicable to the souls of the dead, who are in purgatory. This is called <HI>Thesaurus Ecclesiae,</HI> the Treasure of the Church; and, by the authority of the Pope, par∣don is granted for fifty thousand years: and, amongst the articles framed by the council of Trent, this is one, that the power of indulgences was left by Christ in the church, and that the use thereof is most useful for Christ's people. A large account of the liberality and readiness of the Popes in granting these indul∣gences and pardons, are recited in an old book, called, <HI>The Customs of London:</HI> and we shall therefore only add,
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>that the Pope, on receiving a valuable consideration, granted to the several bishops of the respective dioceses in England, authority for the increase and furtherance of this privilege, as it was called, to any who were weak enough to purchase for any number of days or months.</P>
<P><HI>Reliques,</HI> &amp;c. came next in play. Agnus Dei's, crosses, pictures, beads, swords, bracelets, feathers, roses, shoes, boots, parings of nails, drops of milk, drops of blood, hair, medals, ashes, dust, chips, consecrated wax, and innumerable other hallowed knacks, were constantly imported and sold to the devotes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camb. Brit. in Norfolk. W. Somner's Antiq. Cant. f. 247.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Jubilees, pilgrimages,</HI> vows, &amp;c. and confluences to Rome, both at stated and arbitrary times, was another source for enriching Rome. The original of these ju∣bilees in the church of Rome appears to have com∣menced in the time of Boniface VIII. who instituted the first jubilee in 1300, promising the remission of all their sins, to all such as should that year visit the steps ascending to the high altar in St. Peter's church at Rome, and this was to be observed every hundred years; at which solemnity there was such a confluence of people, that the city could scarce hold them. Af∣ter this, Pope Clement VI. put the time shorter, and ordered a jubilee to be celebrated every fiftieth year, A. D. 1350. But Pope Sixtus IV. out of compassion to those weak minds, who might long for a jubilee, ap∣pointed it to be kept every twenty-fifth year, and be∣gan it in the year 1475. Pope Alexander intended to accommodate the grace and favour to all that would purchase it, and accordingly, in 1500, he commissi∣oned and sent over to England Jasper Pons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord Bacon's Hist. of Henry VII. f. 199.</NOTE>, who conducted this farce with such solemnity, as to be ge∣nerally received and purchased on the Pope's terms.
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>The roll<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wever Fun. Mon. Fol. 165.</NOTE> particularly expresseth, that all christian people, which truly confessed, and contrite, should visit such churches as should be assigned by Jasper Pons, the holy father's ambassador, and then put into the chest such sum of money, according to the yearly value of their lands and effects, therein farther speci∣fied, shall have the same indulgence, pardon, and grace, with remission of all sins, as if they had gone personally to Rome in the year of grace, viz. Dukes, Lords, and other persons of dignity, spiritual or tem∣poral, 3<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 7<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> Those that have lands to the value of four hundred pounds per annum, 1<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> Those that have lands to the value of one hundred pounds, 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> And, by gradual reduction, provision was even made for those who were not worth more than twenty pounds in goods and chattles, that they should pay 1 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> Pilgrimages were, when any person, out of devotion, or by way of penance, or in performance of some vow, after recovery from sickness, or danger escaped, or to obtain the favour, merits, or intercession of some saint, or in adoration of some famed image, or preci∣cious relique, or to supererogate to the charitable aug∣mentation of the church's treasury, or other like cause, undertook and performed a journey to some holy place, which was the holy mother-church of Rome, of which Bede tells us there were much greater numbers from England than of any other nation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bede's Hist. Eccles. lib. 4. cap. 23.</NOTE>. Nor would the women be left at home on those chargeable expedi∣tions, some of them to the ruin of their families; for it was even a common saying, they returned with an ill conscience, a bad stomach, and an empty purse.</P>
<P><HI>Offerings, gifts</HI> and <HI>presents, legacies,</HI> &amp;c. to saints, their altars, and at holy places, amounted to large sums, as, being taught, their visits were of little or no avail without them; and hence it is that the shrines
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>and altars of many of the reputed saints, of which Rome could canonize enough, became so excessively rich. What vast sums were conferred on our St. Thomas of Canterbury? lady of Walsingham? but the richest of all is the lady of Lorretto in Italy. It is true in∣deed, some of the Popes made presents out of their generosity, or rather policy, to the kings of England; thus Pope Allex. II. sent to William the Conqueror, a consecrated banner, an <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI> one of the hairs of St. Peter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speed in vit. Harold.</NOTE>; Henry II. obtained of Pope Urban III. that he might make his son lord of Ireland, and presented him with a coronet made of peacocks feathers woven with gold<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Speed's Chron. Hen. II.</NOTE>; and Pope Julius II. sent to King Henry VIII. a consecrated perfumed gold rose. Lastly, in the Irish rebellion in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the Pope sent to Desmond, a principal leader in that rebellion, a gracious <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI> and a hallowed ring from his own finger<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camb. History of Elizabeth.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Collections</HI> were another source of revenue, King John, to gratify the Pope, granted protection and fafe conduct to the friars of the hospital of St. Maries, in Rome to preach, and make collections throughout England; for the maintenance of their house built by the Pope. Sometimes the Cistercian order of abbots made collections for the monasteries and priories; at other time begging friars, by their insinuating impor∣tunities, raised large contributions; sometimes the sup∣port and relief of nunneries and cells; and lastly, Car∣dinal Woolsey; at one time, had raked up twelve barrels full of gold and silver, to serve the Pope in his wars<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Speed in Hen.

<P><HI>Courts</HI> and <HI>jurisdictions</HI> of the Pope, both at Rome and within this kingdom, drew constantly incredible sums of money to the Pope: these courts had a great variety of officers, all supported by large fees. These
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>courts at first were pretended to be instituted for eccle∣siastical persons only; but soon after many laicks were cited to Rome, to make answer concerning business, that did not appertain to these courts; in order to ac∣cumulate gain thereby to these courts; also some Popes have been insolent enough to cite some of our Kings; thus Boniface VIII. cited King Edward to appear by his proctors at the court of Rome, to make out his title to the kingdom of Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. Westminster in An. 1031, Fo. 435.</NOTE>; Pope Innocent III. summoned King Henry III. to appear to answer to one of his vassals, David by name, and answer for some wrongs he had done him; though this was treated with contempt<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In An. 1246. Fo. 317.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Contributions</HI> for the Holy Land, and to carry on the war against the common enemy of Christendom; was another device to drain the English; for this pur∣pose Johannes Ferentinus was sent hither by the Pope A. D. 1206; and succeeded so well, that King John wrote to the Pope, that he had greater profits out of England, than from all other countries in Europe. But King Edward I. after visiting the Holy Land, touched at Rome, and with as little policy as honesty, agreed with Pope Gregory X. to share the money col∣lected on this pretence; but the collectors or special nuncio appointed to come over to England for that purpose, laid hold of the greater part of it; and what the King from necessity of state wanted, he was obliged to give security for the repayment, of securities and counter bonds being still extant in the records of the Tower, the King receiving at one time 10,000 marks of the Pope's collector, on security given as aforesaid.</P>
<P><HI>Croisado</HI>'s, and vowed expeditions to the Holy Land, and infidels dispensed withal or commuted, was another trick of the like nature, to bring money into the Pope's exchequer.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In An. 255. Fo. 917.</NOTE></P>

<P>This was an invitation given by the Pope to under∣take wars and expeditions against infidels, upon full pardon promised for all their sins, upon which multi∣tudes would wow to go, and list themselves for the holy war. These sometimes might change their mind, and chuse to stay at home, and that would be dispensed with for payment of certain sums of money; or when an army was collected, the Pope would turn their arms to other uses, as to subdue the Albigenses, Wal∣denses, and others, whom the Pope deemed heretics; and oftimes when large collections were made for the pretended purposes, the Pope would be the sole trea∣surer, and never give any account of his disbursements<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">William Malmsbury, lib. 4. cap. 2. and Matt. Paris in A. D. 1250. Fol. 803.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Ambassadors Leiger,</HI> and extraordinary proctors and agents, constantly residing at Rome, with their retinue and servants, maintained there by our Kings, drew as constantly great sums of money out of the kingdom; for Rome being the seat of policy, and the Popes making themselves concerned and busy in the affairs of all princes, these took it, as indeed it was their in∣terest to have continually their respective agents and ambassadors, there to be watchful for their masters in∣terest, to give all necessary intelligence, and oppose every injurious factions. By these also it was, that the Popes were often solicited; their nephews, cardinals, patrons and favourites bribed, for the Popes are never without their creatures, and these must be dealt with in order to get to the Pope's ear and favour. By those ambassadors and agents, presents were often made to the Pope. King Henry VIII. A. D. 1526, sent to Pope Clement VII. thirty thousand ducats for a pre∣sent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert History, p. 211. Matt. Paris.</NOTE>; at another time, in the said King's reign, the Pope being under restraint, by the Emperor's means, the cardinal of York carried him out of the King's treasure 240,000 pounds. The last of this kind of
<PB N="49" REF="54"/>ambassadors was Sir Edward Carne, who resided there about three years, and died about the beginning of the reign▪ of Queen Elizabeth, with whom this office terminated.</P>
<P><HI>Benefices bestowed upon foreigners,</HI> commonly Italians, was another artifice of the Pope. These constantly re∣sided at Rome, and had their rents and revenues transmitted thither.<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1253.</NOTE> This abuse was complained of, it appearing upon inquiry, that no less than seventy thousand marks were by this means annually carried to Rome: but the Pope answered the com∣plaint with contempt. At a parliament held 1379, this affair was taken into consideration by the parlia∣ment, and the ill consequences represented, and com∣plained of to the Pope, but without any redress; bi∣shoprics, and the best of benefices, given to those fo∣reign moths. Memorable it is, that, in the reign of King Henry VII. and King Henry VIII. the bishopric of Worcester had four Italian bishops successively, and none of them resided there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts and Monuments, tom. i. f. 389.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Priories-alien</HI> was another source of revenue to the Pope; the original of which was, that, according to the direction of the times, many foreign monasteries were endowed with possessions here in England, and then the monks beyond sea would build a cell or con∣vent, to which they sent over such members as they though fit, and constituted priors over them succes∣sively, and thereupon were called priories-aliens; and as these increased, we find in the reign of Edward III. one hundred and ten of these in England. Instances may be made of the multitude more of the like foun∣dations, all tending to carry money out of the king∣dom, and generally to the enemies of Great Britain; and this was found productive of so much mischief, that there was an act made<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 2 Hen. V. n. 9.</NOTE>, that all the possessions in England belonging to the said <HI>priories-alien</HI> should
<PB N="50" REF="55"/>thenceforth belong to the King, his heirs and succes∣sors, for ever.</P>
<P>The orders of the knights templars and hospitallers were also possessed of large revenues and lands here, a great part of the profit whereof was transported away and spent out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>For the original rule and nature of these orders, we may refer the curious reader to Dugdale's history<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's History of Warwickshire, fol. 704.</NOTE>; it may suffice for our purpose, that in the year 1307, by the King's special command, and bull from the Pope, the templars were generally throughout the kingdom (charged with inciting and stirring up to a rebellion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Walsingham's History, p. 73. A. D. 1311.</NOTE>) seized, their persons and effects, and their posses∣sions, given to the knights hospitallers, who enjoyed the same till the 32d year of King Henry VIII. when an act was made, that whereas divers of the King's subjects, called knights of St. John of Jerusalem, abiding beyond the sea, received large sums annually out of this realm, have unnaturally supported the usurped power of the Bishop of Rome; that the said cor∣poration of knights hospitallers, within his Majesty's dominions, should be utterly dissolved; and so the kingdom was freed of that mischief.</P>
<P>The <HI>election</HI> and making of <HI>Popes</HI> and <HI>Cardinals,</HI> was another means of carrying great sums frequently out of England to Rome; and that upon this account: The Pope being both a spiritual monarch and a tempo∣ral prince, that sway which he bore in the consciences of such as owned his authority, gave him a great in∣fluence in the affairs of Christendom, besides his chal∣lenging a power to depose Kings, absolve subjects of their oaths of allegiance, dispense with vows and oaths, and dispose of kingdoms and states as he pleased. Besides the kings and states of Europe acting accord∣ing to their respective rules of state and policy, there continually happened a reciprocation and recurrence of
<PB N="51" REF="56"/>treaties, leagues, alliances, quarrels and wars amongst them; and the popedom being elective, all those princes and states (amongst whom our Kings had their proper concern) made it their interest and utmost en∣deavour, in a vacancy, to procure the promotion of such a one to that see, as might be favourable to their particular interests and designs; and from hence many suitable contrivances, unravelling interests and func∣tions, canvassing parties, purchasing intelligence, buy∣ing votes, bribing of officers, and any thing else that would carry their point, and could be purchased, the expence was not spared; nor was all the expence con∣fined for election of the Pope only, but for other pro∣motions prior to the obtaining of that dignity. Ambi∣tion is rooted in the nature of all men, and especially in persons of that order. Some instances are too remark∣able to be omitted. H. Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, in the reign of Henry V. amassed 300,000 pounds, of which he lent the King 200,000 pounds, and took his crown to pawn for it, and with a good part of the rest purchased a cardinalship, but did not live to pur∣chase the papacy; and in the reign of Henry VIII. the great and rich Woolsey was never quiet, always bribing one or other to get to the popedom; but the superior advantages of some, as being nearer, to watch all opportunities, or bribing higher, the Cardi∣nal, after great expence, failed of obtaining his point; and it is justly remarked in history, that few of the English were advanced to the dignity, notwithstand∣ing they were generous contributors to its support.</P>
<P><HI>Canonization,</HI> and <HI>sainting</HI> of men, women and boys, was another method of gain to the Popes; and that was when any person lived more austerely or devoutly than ordinary, or was famed for any miracle pretended to have been done by him in his lifetime, or by his reliques, or at his tomb after his death; or that he died for, or in defence of the truth, or the church's cause; then if his surviving friends or relations made
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>application to the Pope, upon payment of good sums, according to the abilities and qualities of the person soliciting for sentences, fees, orders, references, and other things requisite in such cases, the party, by a kind of <HI>apotheosis,</HI> was made a saint, and a place assigned him in the calendar. Of this extraction was the famous St. Cuthbert, St. Dunstan, St. Thomas of Canterbury, St. Winifred, and many others, who for money had their names put into the rolls of glory, and their fames and merits celebrated, and supplicated here on earth. The manner of canonizations, with the ordinary charges, too long to be here inserted, you may find in Sir Henry Spelman, in his second tome of his collection of the English councils.</P>
<P>But besides the Pope's legates, who were the general collectors for the Pope, there was another set of men came over into England, A. D. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>35, who were very assiduous in improving the Pope's revenues, and in transmitting the money; and these were called <HI>Caursins</HI> and <HI>Lombards,</HI> Italians by country, and stiled them∣selves the Pope's merchants. These drove the trade of letting out of money, of which they had what may be called a bank-stock, and were esteemed more severe and merciless than the Jews. <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> gives us the etymology of the word Caursins, <HI>quasi capientes &amp; ur∣sini,</HI> because they worried men like bea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. Now, be∣cause the Pope's legates and collectors were all for ready money, when any sum by levy, first fruits, tenths, dispensations, &amp;c. became due and payable to the Pope, by any prelate, covent, priest or lay person, these Caursins would furnish them with ready cash, upon their entering into a solemn bond and obligation for that purpose, the form of which in English was as follows: To all that see this present writing, Thomas the prior and the convent of Barnwell, greeting, and know ye, that we have borrowed and received at Lon∣don, for ourselves, and profitably to be expended for us and our house, from Francisco and Gregorio, for
<PB N="53" REF="58"/>them and their partners, citizens and merchants of Millain, one hundred and four marks, thirteen shillings and four-pence, of lawful money, sterling; which we promise to repay, at the feast of St. <HI>Peter ad vincula,</HI> at the New Temple at London, A. D. 1235; and if the said money be not fully paid at the said time and place, we bind ourselves to pay to the said merchants, or to any of them, or to their certain attorney, for every ten marks, forborne two months, one mark for damages, by reason of non-payment, with the expence of one merchant, with his horse and man, till the money be all paid; and for payment of principal, in∣terest, damages and expences, we oblige ourselves, our church and successors, and all our goods, moveable and immoveable, ecclesiastical or temporal, which we have, or shall have, wheresoever they may be found, to the said merchants and their heirs; and do recognize and acknowledge, that we possess and hold the said goods, from the said merchants, by way of courtesy only, until the said money be fully paid; and we re∣nounce for ourselves, and successors, all aid of canon and civil law, all privileges and clerkships, all customs, statutes, letters, indulgences, privileges obtained for the King of England from the see apostolic; as also we renounce the benefit of all appeals or injunctions, with all other exceptions, real and personal, which may be excepted against the validity of this instrument: all which we promise faithfully to observe. In witness whereof, we have hereunto set the seal of our convent, dated at London, April 19, on the sestival of St. El∣phegi, in the year of grace 1235<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. Paris in Hen. III. f. 417. The Romish Horseleach, p. 168.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We see by this how sure and firm they made their security; and the severity of these caursins often obliged their debtors to sell even their chalices and church-plate, to discharge these obligations. A street in London, from
<PB N="54" REF="59"/>their meeting and residing therein, is called Lombard-street to this day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow's Survey of London, f. 217.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>What sense the people had of all these burdens, grievances, and extortions, and what pathetic com∣plaints were made in consequence thereof, are very largely recited in our own records, and many English historians. Besides, many Romanists themselves have censured the avarice of the Popes and court of Rome; as Marsilius of Padua, Nic. Clemanges, Aeneas Syl∣vius, and Germanus, Archbishop of Constantinople. Petrarch, in an epistle of his, saith, the grim porter is appeased with gold, that heaven is opened with gold, and Christ himself sold for money; and for the prices and rates, there is a book intitled, <HI>Taxa Camera Aposto∣licae,</HI> specifying what may be had at Rome for money, of which there is a Paris edition, A. D. 1520</P>
<P>Many complaints were made in the reigns of King Henry III. Edward I. Edward III.; and what advice was consequently given by parliaments to our Kings in that case, and in particular that held at Carlisle, are very memorable: but the principal summary of the intolerable exactions of the Pope's legates, nuncios, and collectors, is contained in that excellent abridge∣ment of the Tower Records, from King Edward II. to King Richard II. from 975 to 1377, by Sir Robert Cotton<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See also Matt. Paris in Hen. III. Ann. 1253.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is also a memorable epistle of Petrus Cassiodo∣rus, a noble Italian Knight, written to the English church about the 29th year of King Edward I. exhort∣ing them to cast off the Romish yoke of tyranny, op∣pression, and exaction, contained in the <HI>Acts and Monu∣ments,</HI> vol. i. f. 460.</P>
<P>The Antiquities of Britain contain ample proofs, that the Pope's rents exceeded the crown-revenues<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Matt. Paris, f. 666: Acts and Monuments, tom▪ i.</NOTE>.
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>And in the 23d year of King Henry VIII. it was com∣puted, that the Papacy had received out of England, for the investiture of Bishops only, since the second year of King Henry VII. not much above forty years, 160,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling; an incredible sum, con∣sidering the scarcity and value of money at that time. From the whole, our Kings were continually affronted —the rights of all persons injuriously invaded — the coin and treasure of the nation continually drained out — the secrets of the kingdom discovered — arts and learning discouraged—the nation weakened and re∣duced to a state of dependency and subjection to strangers, and in a manner left defenceless against fo∣reign enemies; of all which the Rolls and Records of parliament, statutes, and historians of these times, as well foreign as those of our own nation, do abundantly tes∣tify: and the necessity of a reformation from these, and other interesting and important considerations, will constitute the subject of our next chapter.</P>
<P>But to return from this digression, we shall draw the history of King Henry's reign to a close by some eccle∣siastical transactions, that furnish us with a further view of the state of religion at that time.</P>
<P>In the year A. D. 1261, there was a provincial council held at Lambeth, wherein the constitutions of that synod were a confirmation, or illustration, of those before made in the assembly of Morton. Both of them carried the privileges of the church too high, and bore too hard upon the common law in sundry in∣stances. This made the King uneasy: however, he did not think it proper to refer the controversy to his own courts, but applied to the Pope for a remedy. In his letter he informed the Pope, that the reverend fathers, Boniface, Archbishop of Canterbury, and his suffragans, had passed some synodical decrees in pre∣judice of his crown and kingdom, and therefore desires his Holiness would revoke these constitutions. This letter was addressed to Pope Urban IV. and dated
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>October 23, 1261. The Pope, as it appears, was silent about two years; after which time he vouch∣safes to send the King an answer to his request. In this letter he takes notice, that the church of England had suffered great hardships by the mal-administration of the King's ministers of justice; and that to provide against these encroachments, the Archbishop, and his suffragans, had passed several canons and able constitu∣tions in defence of their liberties; and that they having since made application to the holy see to confirm their provincial synod, these decrees had, for the most part, been confirmed, and he could not now pretend to make alterations; but desired the King would be tender of the privileges of the church, and forbid his ministers incroaching upon them.</P>
<P>The next thing remarkable in the church, is the na∣tional synod at London, under Cardinal Othobon, in the pontificate of Clement IV.</P>
<P>The canons of this council were of great authority, and looked on as a rule of discipline to the English church, and even were, several of them, of Otho's in∣stitution, and confirmed by the Pope, and continued to this time a part of the canon law of our established church. It consists of thirty-eight canons.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiquities of Britain in Boniface, p. 187. Collier's Eccle∣siastical History, vol. i p. 476.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding many of those canons relate to the good order and discipline of the churches, Mr. Fox relates, that a little before King Henry's death there fell out a grand controversy between the monks and citizens of Norwich, about certain talliages and li∣berties; that, after much altercation and wrangling words, the rage of the city so much increased, that they set upon the abbey and priory, and burned both the church and the Bishop's palace; which King Henry afterwards brought them to trial for, and many of them suffered cruel deaths; others were excommunicated.
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>The city was likewise obliged to find money towards re-edifying the church and the palace. Afterwards he returned to London, where he fell grievously sick, and expired in a few days, after reigning fifty-six years.</P>
<P>King Henry died A. D. 1272, of whom Speed gives this short character, that his devotion was greater than his discretion, as was evident from the injuries he suf∣fered himself, and the depredation of his kingdom by popish sway. Dr. Smollet says, the particulars of his character may be gathered from the detail of his con∣duct. He was certainly a Prince of very mean talents, irresolute, inconstant, and capricious, proud, insolent, and arbitrary, arrogant in prosperity, and abject in adversity, profuse, rapacious, and choleric, though destitute of liberality, oeconomy, and courage: yet his continence was praise-worthy, as well as his aversion to cruelty; for he contented himself with punishing even rebels in their effects only, when he might have glutted his revenge with their blood. He was prodigal even to excess, and therefore always in necessity, notwith∣standing the great sums he levied from his subjects; and tho' his occasions were never so pressing, he could not help squandering away his money upon worthless foreign favourites, without considering the difficulty he always found in obtaining supplies from par∣liament</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EDWARD I. A. D. 1272.</HEAD>
<P>Though Henry's death happened at a seeming un∣favourable conjuncture, when the heir of the crown was absent, and Richard King of the Romans, with his son, were now no more; Walter Gifford, Arch∣bishop of York, and the Lords of the Council, ma∣naged affairs with such discretion, that no bad conse∣quences ensued. On the morning after the King's death, Edward was proclaimed at Westminster, and
<PB N="58" REF="63"/>afterwards in Guildhall; and all persons enjoined to keep the peace towards the Jews, as well as the Christians; for at this time there were great distur∣bances happened, to the annoyance of the public peace. To prevent, as far as possible, any insurrection or matter for rebellion, the nobility of Ireland, together with all the nobility of this land, took the oaths of allegiance to Edward; for the former of which, a spe∣cial commission was appointed and sent over.</P>
<P>A. D. 1273, the King visited Rome, in consequence of an invitation from Gregory X. and this Pontiff now indulged him with the grant of two or three tenths of all ecclesiastical revenues throughout his kingdom, to reimburse him for the expences of his expedition to Palestine, where the King had attended him.</P>
<P>Upon his return to England, that he might take more effectual methods for the honour and tranquillity of his reign, he appointed commissioners to examine into the state of his own revenues; appointed Com∣missioners of Inquest, to make a progress thro' all the counties of the kingdom, and not only take an exact information of every circumstance relating to the crown fiefs, but also punish the malversation of Magistrates and Sheriffs, who had lately abused their authority, and oppressed their fellow subjects.</P>
<P>That he might the better protect his people from such extortion, he summoned a general parliament, in which several excellent laws were enacted for the ease and advantage of the subjects; who were so well pleased with all the regulations, that they granted a fifteenth of all their moveables, to pay the debts which the King had contracted in his expedition to the Holy Land. The merchants, out of gratitude for the great care he had taken of their interests in a treaty with Flanders, desired that a tax might be laid on every sack of wool, and twice as much upon every three hundred skins, and a last of leather, for the King's own use, and his heirs for ever, known by the name of the
<PB N="59" REF="64"/><HI>New Custom,</HI> in contradistinction to that which had been formerly paid; and is said to have been granted by the prelates and nobility, as well as by the mer∣chants of the kingdom. Towards the latter end of the late reign, the Jews had, by bribing the King's Coun∣cil, been admitted to all the privileges of Christian na∣tives: they purchased houses, lands, and manors; sat on juries, enjoyed seisin and wardships of Christian heirs, together with the right of presentation to livings. This indulgence raised a clamour among the clergy, and gave great offence to all sorts of people. The King himself was shocked at the scandalous connivance of his father in this particular, and at his desire a law was made in this parliament, rendering Jews incapable of holding fee or freehold, obliging them to wear a mark on their outward garments, to distinguish them from Christians, and prohibiting them, on severe penalties, from lending money at usury.</P>
<P>The Pope likewise demanded eight thousand marks, as the arrears of the annual tribute,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1276.</NOTE> which were paid accordingly. Though Edward was ashamed of this vile acknowledgment, and af∣terwards proposed to Pope Nicholas III. that, instead of being issued from the exchequer, it might be charged upon some abbeys and priories, which he would endow for that purpose; but the Pope perceiving his drift, would not hearken to the proposal, by which he might invalidate a claim to more important demands, when a proper opportunity should occur.</P>
<P>Great complaints had been made of the exces∣sive wealth of the clergy and convents,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1279.</NOTE> which daily increased, to the prejudice of the laity, and indeed of the nation in general: though care had been taken to insert in the famous charter of King John, a clause, expressly forbidding the subjects to alienate their lands in favour of the church. This ar∣ticle had been entirely neglected; and now the abuse was become so dangerous, that the King plainly saw,
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>the church must in time engross all the lands of the kingdom, unless some remedy could be found for this growing evil. Edward assembled a parliament, to whom he explained his sentiments on this subject; ob∣serving, that as the church neither died nor alienated, all their lands would be swallowed up in that gulph, from which they could never emerge: he therefore desired they would deliberate maturely, and find out some remedy for a grievance of such importance. This proposal was joyfully received by the assembly; and the famous statute of mortmain enacted, forbidding all persons whatever to dispose of their effects, in favour of religious societies, without the express permission of the King or Lord of the fief.</P>
<P>At home he made a progress through the different counties, to hear the complaints, and redress the grie∣vances of his subjects; but, in the course of these re∣gulations, he took one step which might have produced infinite mischief to the kingdom. During the late troubles, several people had usurped lands, to which they had no lawful title, and the crown had suffered by these appropriations: in order to reform this abuse, the parliament, assembled in the course of this year, enacted a statute, called Quo Warranto, obliging all landholders to produce their charters and titles before such judges as should be appointed to examine their validity. This was a very just and necessary regulation, which, however, the King abused for the gratification of his avarice. He knew, that, among the tenants of the crown, there was a good number of landholders who had lost their titles, and he resolved to take ad∣vantage of their misfortune, on pretence of executing this statute of Quo Warranto. He published a pro∣clamation, commanding all those who held lands of the crown, to produce their titles before the judges of the kingdom; an order which was looked upon as the source of infinite mischief and oppression. Accordingly those who were first questioned, and could not produce
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>original titles, although they pleaded long possession, found themselves obliged to pay large sums to the King for the preservation of their estates. But the progress of this evil was stopped by the resolution of the Earl of Warrene, who being required by the judges to produce his charter, unsheathed an old rusty sword, as the instrument by which his ancestors had acquired their land, and with which he resolved to preserve them to the last drop of his blood. This bold answer gave Edward to understand, that his inquisition would be attended with very dangerous consequences; and, that the spirit of independence which breathed defiance to his father, was not yet extinguished in the nation. Moved by these considerations, he revoked his pro∣clamation; and the joy manifested on this occasion plainly denoted how deeply they had felt the injustice of the inquiry.</P>
<P>Edward was so much engrossed by his schemes on the continent,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1288.</NOTE> that he seemed to look upon England as a secondary consideration: he had now resided in Guienne about three years, during which he had expended considerable sums of English money upon the continent. At length his finances being exhausted, he ordered the Bishop of Ely his treasurer to demand a subsidy; and a parliament and a great council of the nobility being assembled at Westminster, he signified the King's pleasure; but the Earl of Gloucester, in the name of the rest, declared they would not grant a subsidy while the King con∣tinued abroad; so that he was obliged to raise money, in the present exigency, by laying a talliage on all the cities, towns and manors, of the crown demesnes.</P>
<P>Edward, who had just consummated his nup∣tials with Margaret of France,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1299.</NOTE> in consequence of the treaty, no sooner heard of these commotions, than he issued orders for assembling the troops of the northern counties, and summoned a parliament at York, to meet in November, where he understood that the castle
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>of Stirling was reduced to extremity. He resolved forthwith to march to the relief of that fortress; but, when he had proceeded as far as Berwick, the nobility refused to serve on the expedition, alledging that the roads of Scotland were unpassable in that season of the year. Thus hampered, he was obliged to desist from the enterprize, and allow the garrison the best capitulation they could obtain. He resolved, how∣ever, to make such an enterprize for invading Scotland in the summer, as would save him the trouble of a winter-campaign for the future. Mean while, he in this parliament confirmed the two charters, and the sheriffs over all England were ordered to publish them in the county-courts every quarter. It was enacted, that three knights should be chosen by the freeholders in every county-court, to enforce the execution of these charters, and punish transgressors in a summary way, without the tedious forms of the common law. The statute of Winton was likewise confirmed; and a new law made, under the title of <HI>Articuli super Chartas,</HI> enact∣ing, that no goods or merchandize should be taken without payment, by the King's order, except such as might be necessary for his houshold or wardrobe. This statute likewise contained some regulations with regard to trespasses, contracts, debts of pleas within the verge of the court; and provided redress against false entries, seizures, and waste, committed by eschea∣tors. Writs were issued for finishing the preambula∣tions of the forests, that their bounds might be as∣certained for ever; and all the adulterated pennies, of which a vast number had been imported into the kingdom, was cried down by proclamation.</P>
<P>The King having taken these measures for the be∣nefit of his subjects, began to prepare for the final destruction of Scotland; and, assembling a numerous army, took the field about Midsummer. As soon as he entered Galloway, he received a proposal from the Scottish nobility, importing that they would lay down
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>their arms, and submit, on condition that he would set their King at liberty, and allow them to ransom their estates, which he had given away; otherwise they would defend themselves to the last extremity. Their requests being rejected with disdain,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1300.</NOTE> they assembled a great number of men, without arms or discipline, in hope of finding some opportu∣nity to surprise him in his march; but he proceeded with such circumspection as baffled all their endea∣vours; and pursued them so closely, that they were at last obliged to stand a battle, in which they were immediately routed, though not with great slaughter; for they fled into fastnesses, through which they could not be pursued by heavy-armed troops, unacquainted with the situation of the country. The hopes they had reposed in their own valour being utterly blasted by this overthrow, they sent ambassadors to implore the protection of Pope Boniface, and offer him the so∣vereignty of the kingdom. That ambitious pontiff embraced the proposal without hesitation, and order∣ing a bull to be expedited on the subject, sent it im∣mediately with a letter to Archbishop Winchelsey, directing him to deliver it into the hands of Edward without delay. The prelate no sooner received this mandate of his Holiness, than he set out in person for Galloway, and found his Majesty in the abbey of Dusques, where he received the papal claim with equal surprise and indignation. The bull contained a great number of arguments to invalidate the preten∣sions of Edward to the sovereignty of Scotland; re∣proached him with the cruelties he had committed in the prosecution of the war against that unfortunate country; and, in particular, with his having imprisoned divers bishops still in confinement: it constituted the Pope as the proper judge of the difference between the English and Scottish nations; and ordered the King to send ambassadors to Rome with proper instructions, within the term of six months; at the expiration of
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>which he would pronounce a definitive sentence. Shocked, as a prince of Edward's haughty disposition must have been at this insolent address, he knew his interest too well to engage in a quarrel with the Pope, at a time when Guienne was sequestered in the hands of that pontiff. Indeed, when he first perused the con∣tents, he swore, in a transport of anger, that if the Pope persisted in such pretensions, he would destroy Scotland from sea to sea; and the Scottish deputies who were present, could not hear such a menace without emotion. They told him he would find that work more difficult than he imagined; for there was not a Scot in the kingdom who would not spend the last drop of his blood in defence of his country. This declara∣tion was not a little extraordinary, considering the per∣fidy with which they had betrayed one another since the beginning of the war. The King's indignation gave way to his policy. He amused the Archbishop with a general answer, implying, that as it was an affair which concerned the rights of the English crown, he could not make a proper reply until he should have consulted his parliament; but, as a proof of his regard for his Holiness, he ordered the Bishop of Glas∣gow to be set at liberty; returned to England, where he disbanded his forces; and, at the request of the French King, consented to a truce with the Scots until Whitsuntide of the ensuing year.</P>
<P>That Edward was extremely alarmed by this ex∣travagant demand of Boniface, appears from the pains he took to invalidate his pretensions. He convoked a parliament at Lincoln in the beginning of the year, to consult with them upon this extraordinary affair, and deliberate upon a proper answer to his Holiness. After some debates,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A D. 1301.</NOTE> it was resolved that a letter should be written to the Pope, in the name of the barons of England, to this effect: That the crown of England had always enjoyed the right of so∣vereignty over Scotland; and it was notoriously known,
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>that Scotland had never depended, with respect to temporals, on the see of Rome: that the parliament would never suffer the King to put his right in litiga∣tion, or to send ambassadors to Rome on this subject, even if he should be inclined to exhibit such proofs of complaisance to his Holiness; they therefore desired he would not attempt to disturb the King or kingdom, in the enjoyment of their prerogatives. This letter, subscribed by one hundred barons, was followed by another from the King himself, accompanied with an abstract, like that which had been read in the assembly at Norham, to prove that the kingdom of Scotland had always been dependent upon the English crown. But with this difference; that whereas the first deduced the pretended right from Edward the Ancient, this writing traced it back to Brutus, the first fabulous King of Albion; and brought it down through all the fictitious reigns recorded in the romance composed by Geoffrey of Monmouth. Though these antique fables could have no effect upon the natives of Scotland, he hoped they might make a favourable impression upon the Pope and his Italians, who were not so well versed in the history of Britain. Edward's letter was couched in very respectful terms; so that his Holiness could not take exceptions to one expression: an in∣stance of moderation which could hardly have ap∣peared upon such an occasion, had not the King of England been at the mercy of the Pope, with regard to the restitution of Guienne. Nevertheless, he took care to protest that he did not mean this as an appeal in a judicial form, but wrote the detail merely with a view to inform the Pope's conscience.</P>
<P>King Edward assembled his first parliament after his coronation at Westminster, on Easter Monday, in the third year of his reign, and made many excellent sta∣tutes, some of them relating to the privileges and ju∣risdictions of the clergy, controlling some canons of
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>the Pope, formerly made use of to the obstruction of public justice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Coke's 2d Instit. p. 156. History of the Church of Great Britain, p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Soon after the council of Lyons, in concurrence with the Pope, sent the Pope's nuncio into England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, upon sundry affairs of the church, especially to demand and receive from the King, eight years arrears of the annual tribute and Peter-pence, then due to the church of Rome, which the King de∣clined paying.</P>
<P>The abbot and convent of Feversham being greatly indebted to merchants and others, by their expences at Rome and papal exactions, the King, to preserve them and their house from ruin, took them and all their lands, money and goods, under his protection, and committed them to the management of proper persons to protect, support and assist them, to super∣sede their difficulties: he likewise granted such privileges to the abbots and priories of Bordesly, Bindon and Thernholm, and in a few years after did the same for the abbey of Reading.</P>
<P>The Chancellor and University of Oxford, having at their proper costs founded a chapelry in the church of St. Mary, to pray for the safety of the King, his Queen and children, ancestors, and all their benefac∣tors; the King, highly commending their piety therein, and endeavouring to promote it, wrote to all the Arch∣bishops and Bishops of England and Ireland, to grant some special indulgences to all who should resort to this chapelry to hear mass or prayers.</P>
<P>He gave a licence, upon the petition of the dean and chapter of Hereford, to elect a new Bishop of that diocese, and to restore the temporalities to him, after confirmation by the Archbishop of Canterbury, without the consent or knowledge of the Pope.</P>
<P>He particularly issued a commission to inquire into and suppress usury amongst all Christians.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
<P>About the same time Walter Brenescomb, Bishop of Exeter, and his officers, cited sundry of the King's subjects into his ecclesiastical courts, for debts and chat∣tels, that concerned not matrimony, and for trespasses and other things, of which they had no legal juris∣diction, excommunicating them, and putting them to pecuniary redemptions and grievous penalties, and withal enacting illegal oaths<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Godwin's Catalogue of Bishops.</NOTE>. The King, upon the complaint of Edmund Earl of Cornwall, issued a speedy commission, in the sixth year of his reign, to some judges, to inquire of, hear and determine these his exhorbitancies and usurpations, before whom he was prosecuted at the King's suit, to the damage of 10,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which the Bishop denying in some sort, he applied to the King, the Pope and court of Rome; which the King highly resented. He was ad∣judged and ordered to satisfy the King for the 10,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and likewise to answer his contempt of the crown and dignity before the King and Council.</P>
<P>The King, to advance learning, and for the good of the church, priesthood and commonwealth, gave his royal assent for translating the friers of the hospital of St. John in Cambridge, into a college of scholars, after the pattern and rules of Merton college.</P>
<P>Pope Nicholas dying 1280, Pope Martin succeeded. In the first year of his papacy he sent two friers, in∣tended by his agents and foreign merchants to export or return out of England the six years dismes, which had been collected and retained for the aid of the Holp Land. King Edward thereupon issued out a writ, to prohibit the exportation of it, intending to reserve the money for his brother's expedition.</P>
<P>The Archbishop of Canterbury having interdicted some of the tenants belonging to the abbey of Friscan in England, the abbot thereupon appealed to Rome against him, and likewise to the King, to redress this oppression. The King, for that and other such like pur∣poses,
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>constituted a special proctor for three years, by patent, to defend the rights and liberties of his free chapels and crown, against all papal and episcopal invaders of them.</P>
<P>The King seized the advowsons of several churches in Wales, forfeited by their patrons rebellions, and gave them to the Bishop of St. David's, with power to appro∣priate them to his church, and for erecting a new colle∣giate church of canons in Lan-Canden in Wales, con∣stituted several canons and prebendaries therein, annex∣ing and appropriating the aforecited churches thereto, the patronages whereof were granted him by the King, who set his seal to the Bishop's charter, and ratified it with his own charter, to make it valid in law.</P>
<P>A. D. 1285, a parliament at Westminster laid down the limits, and fixed the boundaries between the tem∣poral and spiritual jurisdictions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">History of the Church.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Pope Nicholas IV. being settled in his pontifical chair, sent a bull to King Edward I. to demand the arrears of the annual pension of 1000 marks granted by King John. This the King complied with, from politic motives, one of which was to obtain a dispensation for the King's son, Prince Edward, to marry with the heir of the crown of Scotland. The Pope took occasion, as Walsingham saith, about this time to require that the churches of England should be taxed according to the full value, to raise his dismes and exactions higher.</P>
<P>In the same year 1290, the King, out of his zeal to the Christian religion, banished all the Jews out of England, by a public act of parliament, and confis∣cated all their houses and lands, for their infidelity, blasphemy, crucifying of children, in contempt of Christ crucified; and clipping of his coin. In August they were commanded to depart the land, with their wives and children, between that time and the feast of All Saints, with their moveable goods.</P>
<P>King Edward, in the twentieth year of his reign, out of his blind devotion, and love to his late deceased
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>consort Queen Eleanor, instituted a solemn anniversa∣ry, to be kept for her every year, issuing sums of money, and granting several manors and lands to the abbot and convent of Westminster for that purpose; wherein he prescribed how many tapers, and of what weight, they should find; how many and what Masses, Dirges, Pater Nosters, Ave Maries, they should sing, and what alms they should distribute to the poor for her soul, obliging the abbot, prior, and monks, by a solemn oath, duly to perform the same, under pain of forfeit∣ing all their goods, chattels and lands, thus given to them for this end.</P>
<P>King Edward strenuously opposed Pope Boniface's anti-monarchical constitution, against demanding or imposing subsidies on the clergy. Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, was stout in the prosecu∣tion of the Pope's bull, which he had procured for it, and for which all his temporalities were seized; and he being forced to hide his head, and reduced to great extremities, was restored to the King's favour, by the earnest mediation of his suffragan Bishops on his be∣half. Whereupon the King issued out writs to restore his temporalities, with all his oxen, goods and chattels, formerly seized, in the state they now were<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smollet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ecclesiastical history of this period turns chiefly upon the disputes between the crown of England and the Popes, who, since the shameful resignation of King John, had always looked upon this country as a tri∣butary kingdom and conquered province, which they had a right to rule and impoverish. The English people, under the reign of Edward the First, found the Roman yoke so intolerable, that they began to concert mea∣sures for redeeming themselves from such infamous slavery, though not before they had, by repeated com∣plaints, represented their grievances to the court of Rome, and solicited in vain for redress. They com∣plained of their frequent appeals, that obliged indivi∣duals to go and exhaust their time and money in soli∣citing
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>causes at the court of Rome; and that the Pope had usurped the collation of almost all the benefices of the kingdom, contrary to the rights of the King, the chapters and patrons. Sometimes his Holiness, from the plenitude of his apostolic power, reserved to himself the right of filling all the vacancies, which arose from translation, death of the incumbent, or any other cause whatsoever; by which means those pontiffs eluded all the canonical elections in England, with∣out advancing any other reason, but that they had re∣served to themselves before-hand the right of filling up the benefice. They had certainly formed the design of engrossing, by little and little, the collation to all the ecclesiastical livings in the kingdom; for, when they could not decently pretend to have made such a reservation of a right to nominate, they generally found some objections to the elect, and appointed another in his room: but as those who had been canonically elected were always supported by the Kings of England, the Popes found means to evade this opposition, in conferring bishoprics and benefices before they were vacant, by provision, which the English people con∣sidered as an unsufferable grievance. This was the more provoking, as the benefices bestowed by the Popes plenitude of power, were generally granted to fo∣reigners, cardinals, or their kinsmen, who, by virtue of a dispensation, enjoyed the revenues without residing in the kingdom. These benefices were generally farmed by people who employed curates at very small sala∣ries; the service was neglected, the churches went to ruin, all hospitality was banished, and the practice of instructing of people in the duties of the Christian religion was entirely neglected: besides these incon∣veniencies, the money was carried out of the king∣dom, to the infinite prejudice of the natives; an hardship that will appear to be the more severe, if we consider, that in the reign of Henry III. the income which foreign ecclesiastics drew from England exceeded
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>the royal revenue. The Pope frequently imposed taxes on the English clergy; sometimes on pretence of cru∣sades; sometimes to relieve the necessities of the holy see; and often by granting tithes to the King, who gratified his Holiness with a share of the plunder. The clergy of England were obliged to maintain legates and nuncio's at a great expence, over and above pre∣sents and procurations, which they extorted by virtue of the Pope's authority; the annates or first-fruits of all benefices were paid to the Roman pontiff; St. Peter's penny was levied with great rigour, and the tribute incurred by King John was considered as a most scandalous oppression; at the same time the clergy industriously encroached upon the civil power and pre∣rogatives of the Sovereign; they extended their juris∣dicton over all matrimonial causes, they took congni∣zance of every dispute, in which religion could any way be interested; and instead of supporting the rights and prerogatives of the crown, they always espoused the rights of the Pope, whom they affected to consider as their only sovereign. These are the principal grievan∣ces which the Kings and parliament of England en∣deavoured from time to time to redress, by occasional statutes and ordinances, which furnished the Popes with a pretext to complain in their turn, that the church was in danger, and the cause of God neglected and betrayed. Pope Clement V. in a bull, inserted among the public acts, enumerates the following causes of complaint against the conduct of the English go∣vernment. The Cardinals were not allowed to enjoy the prebendaries bestowed upon them, as persons or∣dained by God, to bear a share in the fatigue of the government of the church; though the Pope had in∣contestably the right to confer benefices in England, as well as in other dominions; those for whom he pro∣vided were not allowed to take possession, nor to ex∣communicate such as had the presumption to avail themselves of their right; the citation issued from
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>Rome on this subject were disregarded; notaries were forbid to publish them, and the natives to an∣swer any appeals out of the kingdom; the Pope's nuncio's were prohibited from exercising their functions, until they should have received the King's licence; and some of them had been confined in public prisons, from whence they had been obliged to purchase their release, with considerable sums of money; the magis∣trates would not suffer excommunicated persons to be imprisoned, even after forty days allowed them to give satisfaction to the church; the King frequently inhibited ecclesiastical courts from taking cognizance of causes that properly belonged to their province, and even de∣prived them of their jurisdiction over the members of the clergy, without considering that ecclesiastics are altogether independent of lay-tribunals; clerks were condemned in lay-courts, even without the consent of their superiors; they were obliged to appear in their shirts before their civil tribunals, in defiance of their immunities; and though they were remitted to the ecclesiastical courts, when reclaimed, they were fre∣quently acquitted and released by lay-judges, before the ecclesiastical court had taken cognizance of the affair; clerks were acquitted or condemned by juries of lay-men; the nobility of the kingdom frequently oppressed the abbeys, by lodging in them, at a great expence, under the frivolous pretext, that the monas∣teries had been founded by their ancestors; during the vacancy of abbeys, those whom the King appointed to take charge of them, damaged the premisses, and wasted the income; and, finally, the tribute of a thou∣sand marks, due to the holy see, was not paid to the Pope, but converted to other uses.</P>
<P>King Edward I. during his long reign, distin∣guished himself by many martial atchievements, in which it must be acknowledged he gained great honour; yet, at the same time, they turned to so little real advan∣tage,
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>either to himself or his subjects, that they seem rather to eclipse than add a lustre to his character.</P>
<P>When he was drawing near the close of his life, there were three points which he had in view to enjoin upon his son. The first point he aimed at, was to pro∣secute the war against the Scots with unremitted vigour, until he should have reduced them to an entire subjec∣tion; for which purpose he advised him to carry his bones into Scotland, at the head of the army, not doubting but the presence even of his lifeless corpse would daunt the courage of a people whom he had so often vanquished.</P>
<P>The second was, that he would send his heart to Jerusalem, with thirty-two thousand pounds sterling, which he had destined for the support of the holy se∣pulchre. And the third, that he would never recall his favourite Gaveston, whom he considered as the cause of all the misdemeanours of which the young prince had been guilty, and who, he foresaw, would be the occasion of far greater mischiefs, if he should ever return to England. The Prince having promised to obey these injunctions, Edward resigned to his fate, with a pious, but manly composure, and expired in the arms of his servants.</P>
<P>Thus died Edward I. King of England, on the seventh day of July, after having reigned thirty-four years with great reputation and success. He was a Prince of a very dignified appearance; tall in stature, regular and comely in his features, with keen piercing black eyes, and of an aspect that commanded reve∣rence and esteem. His constitution was robust; his strength and dexterity perhaps unequalled in his king∣dom; and his shape was unblemished, in all other respects but that of his legs, which are said to have been too long in proportion to his body, whence he derived the epithet of Long-shanks. In the qualities of the head, he equalled the greatest Monarchs who have sat on the English throne: he was cool, pene∣trating,
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>sagacious, and circumspect: the remotest corners of the earth resounded with the fame of his courage; and all over Europe he was considered as the flower of chivalry. Nor was he less consummate in his legislative capacity, than eminent for his military prowess. He may be stiled the English Justinian; for besides the excellent statutes that were enacted in his reign, he new-modelled the administration of justice, so as to render it more sure and summary; he fixed proper bounds to the different courts of jurisdiction, settled a new and easy method of collecting the revenue, and established wise and effectual regulations for pre∣serving peace and order among his subjects. Yet, with all these good qualities, he cherished a dangerous ambition, to which he did not scruple to sacrifice the good of his country; witness his ruinous war with Scotland, which drained the kingdom of men and money, and gave rise to rancorous enmity, which in the sequel proved so prejudicial to both nations. That he was arbitrary in his disposition, appears in many in∣stances, particularly that of seizing, for his own use, the merchandize of his subjects; a stretch of prerogative more suitable to the conduct of an eastern Emperor, than to that of an English Monarch. The cruelty of his nature was manifest in every expedition he under∣took, either in Wales or Scotland. His integrity may be questioned from the nature of his transactions with the competitors of the Scottish crown, and the renun∣ciation of the oath he had taken to his subjects. Tho' he is celebrated for his chastity and regular deportment, there is not, in the whole course of his reign, one in∣stance of liberality or munificence. He had great abi∣lities, but no genius; and was an accomplished war∣tior, without the least spark of heroism<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smollett.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD II. <HI>surnamed of</HI> Caernarvon, A. D. 1307.</HEAD>
<P>The reign of the late King had been productive of great advantage, and greater glory, to the English na∣tion. The principality of Wales was united to the crown. Scotland, thrice subdued, was upon the point of being conquered for a fourth time, the English forces having already advanced to the borders. The spirit of faction and discord was entirely extinguished in the kingdom. A good understanding was established between the Sovereign and the people. And all these circumstances seemed to make ample amends for the losses sustained by the crown in foreign parts, during the reign of John and Henry III. not so much through the weakness of the English, as the pusillanimity and misconduct of these two Princes.</P>
<P>In the year A. D. 1312, was held the first session of the council of Vienne, where Philip the Fair appeared in person, with three of his sons, and his brother Charles de Valois. Pope Clement gave the assembly to understand, that he had convened them to consult about the recovery of the holy-land, and the fate of the Templars, who had been seized and imprisoned all over Europe, in consequence of being charged with crimes of the most atrocious nature. In all probability, their great power and immense wealth excited the jea∣lousy and envy of the European Princes; for by this time they enjoyed sixteen thousand lordships in Christen∣dom. Such a society, independent of all govern∣ments, though their influence extended through every kingdom of Europe, could not but alarm every Prince of sound policy, especially as the order gained ground every day, and they increased their possessions either by purchase or benefaction. Philip the Fair, dreading the progress of their power, and allured by the hope of sharing their acquisitions, sound means to trump up an accusation against the whole order, containing such
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>articles as intailed upon them the detestation and ab∣horrence of mankind.</P>
<P>As soon as the King began to act upon the public stage of government, he discovered an unreasonable sondness for peculiar favourites, particularly Piers Ga∣veston, a native of Guienne, which incurred the censure of his friends, and the resentment of his enemies.</P>
<P>At the parliament, which met on the 28th day of April, the Barons appeared in arms, and insisted on the banishment of Gaveston. Some persons, apprehen∣sive of the fatal consequences that might ensue from such a misunderstanding between the King and the no∣bility, interposed their good offices, and endeavoured to effect an accommodation: but the Barons would listen to no terms; they still demanded that Gaveston should abjure the realm before Midsummer, though they consented to his enjoying his whole estate; and the Bishops issued a provincial sentence of excommuni∣cation against him, should he remain any longer in the island.</P>
<P>The general voice of the people obliged him to dis∣miss his favourite; but it was with such marks of esteem, titles of honour, and grants of certain lands, as plainly intimated, that he slighted the affection and regard of his subjects, and preferred his own pleasure.</P>
<P>In the month of January 1314, a parliament was assembled, in order to examine the ordinances; but the King's council declaimed against them with so much warmth and vehemence, as articles injurious to the crown, and subversive of the constitution, that they were rejected by a majority: and for this reason the Earl of Lancaster, and the other associated Barons, refused to serve in the Scottish expedition.</P>
<P>The session was scarce finished, when Edward re∣ceived advice that the Scots had invaded England, where they committed great depredations. In conse∣quence of this information, he sent orders to the
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>Cinque-ports, and other maritime towns, to fit out a fleet, and be at Berwick by the day of rendezvous. Mean while he detached the Earl of Pembroke, whom he appointed guardian of Scotland, to oppose the pro∣gress of the enemy in the north. He wrote to the Earl of Ulster, and to all the Irish chieftains, to assem∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their followers, and come to his assistance. He or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d new levies to be made in Yorkshire, and other pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the realm, and collected a more numerous an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able army, than that with which the late K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad accomplished the conquest of Scotland.</P>
<P>Having passed the Easter holidays at Ely, he repair∣ed to York, from whence he proceeded to Berwick, where he arrived in the beginning of June. As the time for the surrender of Stirling was now approaching, he resolved to advance to the relief of that place; and accordingly began his march, at the head of one hun∣dred thousand men, attended by a prodigious number of waggons and other carriages, loaded with baggage and provisions. The English trusting to the superio∣rity of their numbers, proceeded with the most care∣less security, as if they had been going not to fight but to triumph.</P>
<P>They were permitted to advance without interrup∣tion from Bruce, who was determined to venture a battle, and with that view had encamped in the neigh∣bourhood of Stirling, where he waited the approach of the English. His army amounted to about 30,000 men, brave, hardy, and experienced, and firmly resolved to die or conquer, in maintaining the liberty and inde∣pendance of their country; both armies were warmly engaged, and they had many desperate rencounters, but it terminated without any decisive victory.</P>
<P>Edward's finances being almost exhausted, he con∣voked another parliament at Westminster, on the twentieth day of January, in order to obtain a subsidy, and deliberate about the state of the realm, which was now in a wretched condition. The country was not
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>only wasted by the enemy, but oppressed by famine and the parliament persuaded the King to issue and edict against the monopolizers of provisions. This ordinance was accordingly published, but was repealed in the following year, because it was found, that instead of answering the intended purpose, it only increased the scarcity, and heightened the price of victuals.</P>
<P>To render the Barons the more complaisant, the King confirmed the two charters, and even the late ordinances; and appointed commissioners to finish the perambulation of the forests. This expedient had the desired effect. The parliament, pleased with these con∣cessions, voted a twentieth of moveables; but as thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aid was not sufficient to answer the King's necessities he required a loan from all the religious societies in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kingdom, and issued writs, ascertaining the sum which each establishment should pay, according to their abi∣lities.</P>
<P>In order to prevent commotions for the future, Ed¦ward endeavoured to conciliate the affection of the Welch, by granting them some new privileges and im¦munities. The fines commonly paid by the tenants to their Lords for the marriage of their daughters were moderated: freeholders were allowed to put their sons if they had more than one, into holy orders, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King's licence; and alienate their lands, for thre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> years, to any of their own countrymen, except monk<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and other religious houses; and orders were given fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> observing the ordinances of Hennington all over th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> principality.</P>
<P>Nor was Edward less careful in providing for the se¦curity of Ireland. He sent a commission to John d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hotham, empowering him to raise money by the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of wardships, marriages, and other duties belonging <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the crown in that country, in order to enable him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> levy an army against the Scottish invaders. He pro¦mised rewards and encouragement to all those wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should maintain their allegiance to the English go¦vernment
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>and give their assistance in opposing the enemy; and commanded the justiciary to remove all officers that seemed unqualified for their respective posts.</P>
<P>In the month of September, Edward published a writ for expelling all the Flemings out of England; and directed letters to the magistrates of his dominions, enjoining them to break off all correspondence with that people, because they were considered as rebels to the King of France.</P>
<P>This was done in consequence of an article in the treaty between Edward I. of England and Philip the Fair of France, who had died in the course of the pre∣ceding year, by which the two parties were bound to afford no shelter or protection to the enemies of each other.</P>
<P>A parliament being assembled at Lincoln on the twenty-seventh day of January, the King declared that he had called them together, in order to concert the proper measures for reducing the rebels of Scotland; but finding them unwilling to embark in such an ex∣pedition, he issued writs, enjoining the strict obser∣vance of all the ordinances and perambulations: and the Barons were so well pleased with this concession, that they voted a very extraordinary supply for the maintainance of the Scottish war.</P>
<P>Edward, considering that nothing could contribute more to the success of the undertaking than a perfect harmony and agreement between him and his Barons, resolved to compromise all differences with the Earl of Lancaster, whom he now desired to come and preside in his councils. That nobleman accepted the invitation, and was declared general of the forces destined for the Scottish expedition: and writs were issued, requiring all persons, who held a knight's fee, or fifty pounds a-year in land, to come and receive the honour of knight∣hood before the Trinity Sunday following.</P>

<P>The clergy, at this parliament, excused themselves from giving any aid, on account of the famine, which now raged with uncommon violence, and rendered the country one mournful scene of horror, death, and de∣solation. The wealthiest noblemen were obliged to lay aside their equipages, and dismiss their servants; the highways were filled with robbery and murder; the streets were covered with spectacles of misery and distress; crouds of wretched and forlorn creatures were seen to die for want of food; and the helpless parents lay expiring in the midst of their tender offspring, who soon shared the same unhappy fate. The prisons were burst open, and the criminals devoured by the furious populace; the dead were consumed by the living; the graves were dug up, and robbed of their inhabitants, to appease the rage of hunger; nay, to such a terrible degree did this calamity prevail, that even the mother was known to destroy, and feed upon the fruit of her own womb.</P>
<P>Edward had taken the cross a little before the death of his father; and the Pope, who was bent upon a crusade for the recovery of Palestine, had granted a year's tenth of all the ecclesiastical revenues in the kingdom, for defraying the expence of that expedition; but as the war with Scotland prevented him from per∣forming his vow, Clement commanded both Princes to agree to a truce for two years, on pain of excom∣munication; and sent over two Cardinals to settle the terms of the treaty.</P>
<P>In a parliament which was assembled at York, about a month after Easter, A. D. 1319, the Earls and Ba∣rons gave an eighteenth of their rents; the cities and boroughs granted a twelfth of their effects; and the clergy agreed to a tenth of their revenues, having, by this time, obtained the Pope's permission.</P>
<P>The troops were ordered to rendezvous at New∣castle, by the tenth day of June; and all the military tenants of the crown were summoned to repair thither,
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>with horse and arms: the Earls of Lancaster, War∣renne, Pembroke, Arundel, and Hereford, with the coheirs of the late Earl of Gloucester, and a great num∣ber of Barons, attended with their followers; and as the King had promised to every soldier all the booty he should take, to the amount of one hundred pounds, an incredible number of infantry convened at the time and place appointed.</P>
<P>The common people had formed unlawful confede∣racies and associations, overawing juries, extorting verdicts, obstructing the administration of justice, rob∣bing parks, burning houses, and murdering individuals, with equal wantonness and impunity; and a law was now made, for inflicting condign punishment upon all who committed or encouraged these enormities.</P>
<P>There was another resolution taken in this parliament, which is no less worthy of commendation. The Flem∣ings had hitherto supplied the Scots with arms and pro∣visions, notwithstanding their being in alliance with the English nation, and in contempt of the repeated remonstances against that unfair practice. They had even attacked and plundered some English ships; and the steps taken to procure redress of these grievances had hitherto proved abortive.</P>
<P>This affair being brought before the parliament, it was unanimously resolved, that the King of England was Lord of the British seas; that all goods and mer∣chandize taken from the English within these seas, ought to be considered as taken within the realm, and the captors tried by the King's justices: that suits about these depredations should be determined accord∣ing to law and reason; and that all persons concerned in such depredations, and knowingly receiving the prize-goods, either in whole or in part, should be charged and punished accordingly.</P>
<P>The Scots had writ a sensible and pathetic letter to the Pope, explaining the nature of the quarrel between them and the English, and beseeching him not only to
<PB N="82" REF="89"/>remove the censure denounced against them, but also to use his influence with Edward, in putting an end to that bloody and destructive war, which had raged so long to the ruin of both nations.</P>
<P>Though the Pope did not think proper to grant the former part of their petition, he sent a bull to the King of England, advising him to restore peace to the island. In compliance with this advice, Edward appointed the Archbishop of York, the Bishop of Carlisle, Robert Baldock, archdeacon of Middlesex, and Geoffrey Scroop, as his commissioners, to treat with the Scottish depu∣ties about an accommodation. The King of France demanded, that his ambassadors might be present at the conferences; but Edward, who suspected Philip to be a secret friend of Robert de Bruce, refused to comply with his request, and the negotiation proved abortive.</P>
<P>In a council held at Oxford, A. D. 1322, several useful constitutions were enacted, touching the quali∣fications of candidates for holy orders, the ordination of priests, and the confirmation of children. Edward's opposition to the Pope intailed upon him the resent∣ment of the clergy, especially the foreign ecclesiastics, who sided with the Barons, and pretended that mira∣cles were wrought at the tomb of the Earl of Lancaster, who suffered for high treason. These stories being in∣dustriously circulated by the monks of Pontefract, where that nobleman's body was interred, and coun∣tenanced by the clergy of St. Paul's in London; the King ordered the church and priory of Pontefract to be shut up, and severely reprimanded the ecclesiastics of St. Paul's cathedral. Towards the end of his reign, he solicited the Pope's consent to the dissolution of some small sees in Ireland, that they might be annexed to those that were of more consequence, to be filled with English prelates, as the most natural expedient to keep the natives in order. He likewise desired his Holiness would confirm the bull of Pope Honorius IV. subject∣ing
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>the conventical church at Westminster to the im∣mediate jurisdiction of the Roman see, independent of any English metropolitan.</P>
<P>Edward endowed the Dominican convent at Langley in Herefordshire with five hundred marks a year, to pray for the soul of Piers Gaveston; and he founded Oriel college, and St. Mary's hall, in Oxford.</P>
<P>But his conduct in civil affairs was such, as exposed him to the censure of his subjects, and even incurred the resentment of his Barons; and, in A. D. 1327, the house were violent against the King and his adhe∣rents; and the Bishop of Winchester drew up six arti∣cles of impeachment against the King, importing, that he wanted capacity to govern the realm, inasmuch as he had been, during the whole course of his reign, misled by evil counsellors, to his own dishonour, and to the prejudice of the church and people, without giving ear to the advice of the greatest and wisest men of the kingdom: that he employed his time in pursuits un∣worthy of his character, and neglected the affairs of the administration: that by his misconduct he lost the kingdom of Scotland, together with lands and terri∣tories in Gascony and Ireland: that he distressed the holy church, by prosecuting and imprisoning church∣men; and that he caused many noblemen of the land to be imprisoned, banished, disinherited, and put to ignominious deaths: that, instigated by evil counsel, and his own avarice, he had broke his coronation-oath: that he abandoned his people, and did as much as in him lay to ruin the kingdom: and that these truths being notorious, he was altogether incorrigible, and ought therefore to be deposed. These articles being read in presence of the Prince seated on the throne, it was resolved that young Edward should assume the regal power; and that the old King should be no longer stiled King of England, but called Edward of Caernarvon, the King's father.</P>
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
<P>In this unhappy situation, deserted by his Queen, and son advanced to the regal dignity or power, he had little favour to expect from those few friends, who had it in their power or inclination to serve him, and an impending trial to expect, in which his conduct would be scrutinized, and he would feel the dreadful effects of a public tribunal. He therefore fled from his country, retired to Wales, and from thence to Ireland, where he endeavoured in vain to secrete him∣self; for through bribery and treachery he was be∣trayed, and murdered by assassins, A. D 1327.</P>
<P>Thus perished Edward II. after having atoned by his sufferings for all the errors of his conduct. He is said to have resembled his father in the accomplish∣ments of his person, as well as in his countenance: but in other respects he seems to have inherited only the defects of his character; for he was cruel and illiberal, without his valour or capacity. He had levity, indo∣lence, and irresolution, in common with other weak Princes; but the distinguishing foible of his character, was that unaccountable passion for the reigning favou∣rite, to which he sacrificed every other consideration of policy and convenience, and at last fell a miserable victim. Yet his bitterest enemy never alledged that any thing unnatural entered into the composition of that singular attachment which he expressed for Ga∣veston and the younger D'Espenser.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD III. <HI>surnamed of</HI> Windsor, A. D. 1327.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament, by which young Edward had been raised to the throne during the life of his father, ap∣pointed twelve persons as his privy council, to direct the affairs of the realm; and Henry Earl of Lancaster, being restored to the dignity of High Steward of England, was intrusted with the guardianship of the young Prince. Edward, even at this early age, disco∣vered that martial disposition for which he was after∣wards
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>so renowned, particularly in his engagements with the French and Scotch.</P>
<P>Edward King of England had summoned a parlia∣ment at London, to deliberate on the subject of an expedition he proposed to undertake for the relief of the Holy Land, in conjunction with other European Princes; but, when he heard of the turn of affairs in Scotland, that design was postponed; their delibera∣tions adopted a more interesting object. They im∣mediately granted extraordinary subsidies for the reduc∣tion of the insurgents of Scotland; the King forth∣with summoned the military tenants, and resolved to pass the winter in the North, that he might be at hand in the spring to invade that country with a powerful army: mean while he sent a body of forces to the assistance of Edward Baliol, who, thus reinforced, ove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ran all the western parts of Scotland, and had well nigh taken Robert, the steward of that kingdom, a youth about fifteen years of age, the nephew and heir of David de Bruce, whom he succeeded on the Scottish throne. He was Lord of Bute and Arran, two islands which Baliol reduced; but young Robert esca∣ped his search, and took refuge in the castle of Dun∣britton. During these transactions in the West, King Edward entered into Scotland, by Berwick, marched into the heart of the kingdom without seeing the face of an enemy; and in his return received a letter from Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March, containing a formal renunciation of his homage. In all probability the siege of his castle would have been the immediate consequence of this defection, had not the operations of war been suspended by the arrival of ambassadors from France, sent to mediate an accommodation be∣tween the Scots and the King of England. A treaty was immediately begun at Gedeling, near Nottingham, whither the Scottish commissioners repaired, under the security of a safe-conduct; and in the mean time both
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>parties agreed to a cessation of arms, to continue to the following Midsummer.</P>
<P>The plan of pacification drawn up by the French ambassadors, who were in the interest of the Scots, was utterly rejected by Edward, who resolved to treat with them in another manner. All the Bishops, Ba∣rons, and freeholders in Ireland, were ordered to con∣tribute a certain proportion of men and money for the reduction of Scotland; the Earls of Namure, Juliers and Montbeliard, were engaged in the service of Eng∣land, and directions given for equipping large fleets in Gascony and England. The Lord Justice d'Arcy brought a body of forces from Ireland, in six and fifty vessels, with which he ravaged the isles of Bute and Arran; though he did not succeed in his attempts.</P>
<P>In a parliament which met in the beginning of February, A. D. 1338, Edward represented the ex∣traordinary occasions he had for large sums of money, to pay the subsidies which he had granted to his fo∣reign allies; and the prelates, nobility, and freeholders, indulged him with a moiety of their wool, which sold for four hundred thousand pounds sterling, be∣sides a duty of two shillings a ton upon wine, added to the usual custom paid by all foreign merchants. Over and above this enormous imposition, the inferior clergy, assembled in convocation at St. Bride's in Lon∣don, granted a tenth of their revenues, exclusive of a tax of a triennial tenth, to which they had before con∣sented. This was the heaviest burden that ever had been laid upon the nation; to which it was so grievous, that the King desired the two Archbishops, and their suf∣fragans, to represent his necessities to the people, in such a manner that they should bear the load with pa∣tience. Vast as all the subsidy may seem to have been, considering the value of money in those days, it was unequal to the expence of his armament, and treaties of alliance; for the German Princes were ever as in∣satiable
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>in their demands, as dilatory in the performance of their contracts. Though he embarked in various wars, he was at length deserted by the Germans, and gained by his conduct more applause than advantage.</P>
<P>A. D. 1349.] The plague, which at the latter end of the summer broke out in the West of England, had by this time reached London; and therefore the parliament, which had been summoned to meet in January, was prorogued until that calamity should abate, though it raged two years, during which no session was held, nor any court of justice kept open. In the first six months of this year, seven and fifty thousand persons are said to have died of the plague, in Norwich and London; and the church-yards being found too small for the burial of the dead, Sir Walter de Marsny purchased a piece of ground, belonging to St. Bartholomew's hospital in Smithfield, to serve for the interment of those who were carried off by the pestilence, which no sooner ceased, than he founded on the spot a convent of Carthusians. This dreadful vi∣sitation spread into Wales and Ireland, and raged chiefly among the common people, and of these, the old men, women and children; none of the better sort died of the infection, except three or f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur of the nobility, and Jane the King's second daughter, who was infected at Bourdeaux in her way to Castile, where she was to have been married to the Infant Don Pe∣dro, son of Alphonso XI. sovereign of that kingdom, When the contagion among the human species abated, the sheep and cattle perished in vast numbers; and no bird or beast of prey would touch their carcasses, which lay putrifying upon the surface of the ground. The harvest was lost for want of hands to gather it, and hence followed a dreadful dearth of labour and provision. The Scots, tempted by the hope of an easy prey, in such a season of calamity and desolation, invaded the northern counties, and, together with a
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>large booty, carried back the contagion to their own country, where it made terrible havock<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. III. pag. 429.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1351.] The plague being by this time quite extinguished, the King, by the advice of his council, published some ordinances to prevent the exorbitant demand of servants and labourers; and at the same time increased the salaries of judges, that they might not be subject to temptation in the exercise of their func∣tions. The Lord Chief Justice Thorn being accused of corruption, threw himself upon the King's mercy, and sentence of death was passed against him accord∣ing to law; but his life was spared, and he afterwards obtained a full pardon. A parliament being assembled, confirmed the King's ordinances, by erecting them into statutes; and enacting other laws, touching per∣sons born beyond sea, besides the statutes of cloths and of provisors of benefices; but that of purveyors did not pass till next parliament.</P>
<P>During these transactions, the King convoked a parliament at Westminster, which granted a subsidy for three years on wool and leather, and enacted a statute against provisors, reservations, citations to Rome, and other papal usurpations. Urban V. re∣senting this law, demanded the arrears of the tribute granted by King John to the church of Rome; and threatened to prosecute the King and kingdom, should they refuse to comply with his demand. This affair being considered in the subsequent session, which met in May, the parliament resolved that King John could not subject himself or his kingdom in such a manner, without the concurrence and consent of his people; and that if the Pope should proceed to violent mea∣sures, they would oppose him to the utmost of their power *.</P>
<P>The King of England understanding that Guienne was also invaded, Scotland solicited to fall upon the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. III. pag. 476.</NOTE>
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>northern countries, and a fleet preparing for a descent upon the southern coast of England, assembled a par∣liament in June; and after having explained the un∣justifiable conduct of Charles, desired the Archbishops and prelates to consider whether he might not reassume the title and arms of France, resigned in consequence of a treaty, which his enemies had so shamefully violated. They deliberated upon this subject, and answered in the affirmative; and the Lords and Commons adopting the same opinion, he resumed them accordingly, and ordered his great seal to be altered. An extraordinary subsidy was granted upon skins and wool, and every thing prepared for the war, which France had so un∣justly kindled. The Prince now enters upon several engagements with the troops of Charles of France, in which some of his generals rather betrayed their ho∣nour and trust, than vindicated the authority of his crown, insomuch there was no success attended their engagements, and there was soon after a truce between France and England.</P>
<P>A. D. 1376.] There was a new parliament called, who granted a considerable subsidy by way of poll-tax, which was even extended to all the clergy, except the Mendicant friers; but, as the necessities of the court would not admit of a delay, until this aid could be collected, the ministers demanded a loan of 4000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> from the city of London, which refused to advance the money. This refusal was resented in such a manner by the court, that Adam Staple was removed from the mayoralty by a special mandamus, and Sir Richard Whittington appointed as his successor in that office. The Commons manifested their complaisance to the ministry, not only in the supplies which they readily granted, but also in reserving a great many uncourtly resolutions, which had been taken in the preceedng parliament. This may suffice for the civil history of this reign.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>
<P>A. D. 1328.] In the beginning of King Edward's reign, he held a provincial council at St. Paul's in London, where the anniversary of the Conception was appointed as a festival; several constitutions were enacted against violators of ecclesiastical immunities, and those who obstructed the testament of villains appertinent to lands, or of any other of a servile condition.</P>
<P>And in a subsequent provincial synod, held by the same Archbishop, other canons were established; the first of which, enacted at the King's request, pronoun∣ces the sentence of the greater excommunication against all rebels and disturbers of the King's peace; the second, was levelled against the extravagance of churchmen; the third, prohibits the practice of farming church-livings to lay-men and women; the fourth, denounced censures upon those who defrauded or interrupted priests in the collection of tithes; the fifth, exacted tithes of the lopping of trees; the sixth, prohibited laymen from touching the offerings made in churches; the seventh, regulated the administration of wills and inventories; the eighth, inhibited the Bishops and their officers, within the province of Canterbury, from intermeddling with the goods of beneficed clergymen, deceased, whose estates ought to be at the disposal of their executors; the ninth, provided against all fraudulent conveyances during a person's life, by which the King may be de∣prived of his dues, and the wives and their children of their portions; the tenth, forbad all buffoonery, re∣velling and riots, at the night-watches in behalf of the dead, which ought to be spent in psalms and prayers for the soul of the deceased: the rest were cal∣culated for clandestine marriages, as well as the en∣croachment of lay-noblemen, who frequently interfered with the ecclesiastical officer, in the article of testaments made by villains, whom the lord of the manor wanted to exclude from that privilege; for providing against the contempt of church-censures; the practice of cut∣ting
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>down trees in church-yards for lay uses; for de∣terring all persons from violating such effects as were sequestered by the Bishop, his vicar-general, and prin∣cipal official; and for restoring the abuse of taking out writs against people, who were at a distance, and entirely ignorant of the prosecution.</P>
<P>Edward III.<NOTE PLACE="inter">His cha∣racter.</NOTE> was undoubtedly one of the greatest Princes that ever swayed the scepter of England, whether we respect him as a warrior or lawgiver, a Monarch or a man. He possessed the courage and ro∣mantic spirit of Alexander; the penetration, the for∣tude, the polished manners of Julius; the munificence, the liberality, and the wisdom of Augustus Caesar. He was tall, majestic, finely shaped, with a piercing eye, and aquiline visage. He excelled all his cotem∣poraries in feats of arms and personal address. He was courteous, affable and eloquent; of a free deport∣ment, and agreeable conversation; and had the art of commanding the affection of his subjects, without seeming to solicit popularity. He was a constitutional knight-errant; and his example diffused the spirit of chivalry through the whole nation. In imitation of the youthful Monarch, who delighted in tilts and tournaments, every individual betook himself to the exercise of arms, every breast glowed with emulation, every heart panted with the thirst of glory; and when he took the field, there was not a soldier in his army, who did not serve from sentiment, and fight for repu∣tion. The love of glory was certainly the predo∣minant passion of Edward, to the gratification of which he did not scruple to sacrifice the feelings of humanity, the lives of his subjects, and the interest of his country; and nothing could have induced or enabled his people to bear the load of taxes, with which they were incum∣bered in this reign, but the love and admiration of his person, the fame of his victories, and the excellent laws and regulations which the parliament enacted with his advice and concurrence.</P>

<P>A. D. 1377.] By this time Wickliffe began to distin∣guish himself by his doctrines, under the protection of the Duke of Lancaster, who had provided for him in the rectory of Lutterworth, in the diocese of Lin∣coln. He maintained that the bread and wine, in the Eucharist, was not the real substance, but only a type of Christ's body; that the church of Rome is not the supreme over all other churches; and that Christ did not give greater power to Peter, than to the rest of his Apostles; that a lay-patron may lawfully and me∣ritoriously divest a degenerate church of her tempo∣ralities; that the gospel is sufficient for regulating the life and morals of every Christian; and that all other rules of sanctity, add no more perfection to the gospel, than whiteness adds to a wall; that neither the Pope, nor any Christian prelate, ought to punish or confine delinquents, but that every individual should do what seemeth good in his own eyes, until he is apprehended by the civil magistrate. Wickliffe, and his followers, affected a remarkable austerity in their way of living, which impressed the vulgar with a high opinion of their sanctity; and the doctrine in favour of lay-patrons was so agreeable to the nobility in general, who wanted to humble the clergy, that he soon numbered a vast multitude of common people, and some of the most powerful Lords of the kingdom, among his converts. The Pope being informed of his success, sent a bull directed to the metropolitan of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, requiring them to seize and secure the person of this arch-heretic; and they unwilling to proceed at once to extremities, contented themselves with summoning him to a synod convened at St. Paul's in London. Thither he went, though the synod inflicted no other punishment but that of imposing silence upon this new apostle.</P>

<P>WHEN gross error and superstition had in a great measure corrupted the whole Christian church, when even idolatry, cruelty, and many other enormities, had so generally prevailed, a reformation in the very nature of things became highly necessary; and the histories of the Romish church not only furnish us with a variety of instances in confirmation of this truth, but we find many of the Popes themselves com∣plained of the great abuses of many of their sacred rites, and general corruption of manners, and professed to make it their principal care to produce a reformation. Thus Paul III. appointed a select council of prelates, to collect those abuses, which were most notorious and pernicious, and present them to him, that he might correct them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Richer's Hist. of the Council General, lib. iv. part ii. p. 136.</NOTE>.

To this we may add, the con∣current voice of the church's representatives in a gene∣ral council. The first Pisan council (as it is common∣ly reckoned, tho' it was indeed the second) were re∣solved to reform the church<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Council of Pisan, Sess. 17.</NOTE>. The council of Con∣stance, which followed five years after, decreed, that the Pope, which was then to be chosen, should, to∣gether with the council, or those deputed by the se∣veral nations for that purpose, reform the church be∣fore that be dissolved; and the matters, about which the reformation was to be made, were reduced to eighteen heads<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Council of Constant.

<P>To add one instance more, the second council of Pisa decreed, that the reformation of the church was most necessary, and passed this decree upon it, that the holy synod would not, nor could dissolve itself, till the universal church should be reformed, both in faith and manners, as well in the head as the members. Where it is observable, that the reformation decreed in this council, as so highly necessary, did extend to faith as well as manners; and so did that of many others, as might be shewn if necessary<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Richer's History of Councils Gen. lib. iii.

</LIST>
<P>The gross corruptions in doctrine may be reckoned some of the following, viz. The infallibility of the Bishop or church of Rome—the Pope's sovereign power over the universal church—the doctrine of the Pope's dominion over temporal Princes—the doc∣trine of transubstantiation—that the marriage of priests is unlawful—the doctrine of seven sacraments—the doctrine of merits—the distinction of sins into mortal and venial—the doctrine of auricular confession and penance—of purgatory—of indulgences—that unwritten traditions ought to be regarded as of equal authority with the holy scripture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Stratford's, late Bishop of Chester, Discourse concerning the necessity of a reformation.</NOTE>—and the doctrine of deposing Kings in case of heresy, and dispensing with oaths of allegiance.</P>
<P>In Worship. First, in having their public worship in an unknown tongue—the propitiatory sacrifice of the mass—the solitary mass, in which the priest alone who consecrates, communicates—the half commu∣nion, the lay-people receiving only in one kind, viz. bread—giving divine worship to the consecrated bread —worshipping of images—representing God by a picture, and worshipping him under that representation —their solemn prayers to saints departed—preser∣ving reliques of saints, and worshipping them.</P>
<P>The corruption of manners which was so prevalent in the church of Rome, and cried aloud for reforma∣tion—this was universal in all states and degrees of men —more especially in the clergy—and most especially in the Pope and Cardinals.</P>
<P>And with respect to discipline. Their selling par∣dons and indulgences for sins is a palpable method of
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>evading it—the doctrine of probability and good in∣tention, by which a person may act any sin, if he can pretend some good design or motive—the doctrine of venial and mortal sins, and thereby paving a way for commuting for the commission of the grossest ini∣quities.</P>
<P>It is observed by Hegesippus, that the church re∣mained a chaste virgin, and the spouse of Christ, till the sacred quire of the apostles, and their immediate successors, who had the honour to be their auditors, were extinct, and then there began a plain conspiracy of impious, absurd errors, by the fraud of teachers, who taught other doctrines for the doctrines of Christ.</P>

<P>From these premisses it appears, that the errors of that church were not slight, and in matters of small moment; but so gross and erroneous, when the refor∣mation was set on foot, that there was a necessity of reforming them; and that no hope was left that the church of Rome would reform these errors in herself,

<P>Indeed some attempts were made toward a refor∣mation from the sixth to the ninth century. The Greek or Eastern churches protested against some of the errors, and corruptions, of the church of Rome, par∣ticularly the worshipping of images—they objected to the doctrine of the Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father and the Son, and not from the Father only— they censured their fasting on Saturdays—found fault with the Latin priests for shaving their beards—with their being obliged to celibacy—with their forbidding to anoint the baptized with chrism—with their making Bishops of Deacons without first conferring the order of priesthood—with their offering a lamb at Easter, &amp;c.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dupin's Ecclesiastical History, vol. iii. c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt. ix. p. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>And on account of these, and some other peculiari∣ties, about the close of the ninth century, they began to separate from their communion.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the few points in which their dissention, and consequent separation from the Romish church might be justified, it appears they were but little behind them in superstitious rites and ceremonies, arising from their gross ignorance, prepossession, and prejudices, promoted by their designing, avaricious and bigotted priests.</P>
<P>And, indeed, wherever the gospel had spread itself, its original simplicity was obscured by human inven∣tions; its native beauty defaced by superstition, and its genuine design, and beneficent purposes, obstructed by tyranny and persecution: yet, as absurd as many of their inventions were, ridiculous as some of their ceremonies must appear to rational unprejudiced minds, and their oppression and persecution contradictory to
<PB N="99" REF="108"/>the natural principles of humanity, and a truly Christian spirit: yet these, I say, with a variety of tricks, pretended miracles, &amp;c. were industriously and successfully maintained and promoted for near fif∣teen centuries; and, what may seem more strange, the church gained the ascendant of the state, and their ini∣quities were established by laws, the observance of which were inforced by the severest penalties.</P>
<P>And tho', in process of time, that undue usurpation of power over the consciences and the rights of man∣kind, which is the bane of religion, became the means, under divine providence, for introducing a reforma∣tion from the grosser errors of papistry, in several parts of the Christian world; the attempts made by the Bishops, or Popes, and other dignified clergy, have been at best but partial, superficial, limited, and re∣strained, by peculiarly strong attachments to party-interest and popular prejudices, or deterred by the dif∣ficulty attending it; so that, notwithstanding the fullest conviction of the dissoluteness of the clergy, the errors and superstitious ceremonies that were continually creeping into the church, and notwithstanding many professions made to reform the clergy, and to restore greater purity of discipline and worship, nothing very considerable was effected, nor could reasonably be ex∣pected of this kind, from those who stood in the first rank, with respect to power and dignity, in the church of Rome: and when this necessary and important work was scarcely undertaken in earnest, or promising suc∣cess from that quarter, it became in an high degree necessary for persons in a civil capacity, laymen as well as ecclesiastical persons, to engage therein, notwith∣standing the task was exceeding laborious, the attempt hazardous, and, as it proved, by a variety of efforts, too often ineffectual to encounter the opposition it gene∣rally met with.</P>
<P>The reasons for a reformation are variously consi∣dered by different authors. Mr. Leavesly reduces them
<PB N="100" REF="109"/>to the following: first, That there are some things ab∣horrent to nature; innocent and uncorrupted nature has some strong antipathies, that arise to an indigna∣tion, that cannot bear some objects, falshood and for∣gery, tyranny and oppression, injustice and cruelty, and hypocrisy in religion: the mind of man is suscep∣tible of noble passions and affections, and there is a secret universal pleasure where actions comport there∣with. Secondly, The necessity from interest, self-pre∣servation, and defence of liberty, civil and religious, calls for, a reformation. Popery is calculated to de∣prive us of our liberties, challenge our properties, lay us under terrible censures, and by acts of excommu∣nication, with all the appendages to it, deprive us of every thing that is dear and valuable. But, thirdly, The main spring and force of this is conscience, the sense of our duty to God. This appeared in all the steps of the reformation; and nothing else could have engaged the reformers to disturb the course of error, and the reign of popery, at so great a hazard, and with so unequal forces: but the firm persuasion of the mind, and the more powerful influence of conscience, are incitements almost irresistible; and this increases in proportion to the mischiefs and evil consequences at∣tending a supine indifference; whatever peace and emo∣lument we might have secured by silence and submis∣sion to long continued usurpations, the call of God would have disturbed our tranquillity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leavesly's Sermon at Salter's Hall.</NOTE>. Notwithstand∣ing their boasted claim of being the only true catholic church, and lawful ministry and pastors, we can see clearly their impostures and corruptions, their super∣stition and idolatry, their anti-christian doctrines and opposition to the truths of the gospel. Many of their doctrines are false and absurd, their worship idolatrous. Papistry recommends many impious and wicked practices; the spirit of it is tyrannical, domineering, and cruel, and a gross corruption of the simplicity of the
<PB N="101" REF="110"/>gospel, both in faith and practice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barker.</NOTE>. And we are as absolutely sure as the words of Christ and his Apostles can make it, that we as Christians are required to ad∣here to the truth as it is in Jesus.</P>
<P>The ministry they instituted we are bound to set up; the assemblies of Christians, which are founded on their authority, we are bound to frequent; the sacraments they instituted, we are bound to observe; and should we neglect the call and authority of Christ, and cor∣rupt his institution, we might justly tremble at the anathema<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Abstract from Leavesly's Sermon at Salter's Hall, p. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The dangerous delusions of a multitude of poor souls move our compassion; and we cannot but think our separation from the Roman commu∣nion necessary, to hold out a light of warning and direction to them. 'Tis conscience, therefore, of our duty to God and man, and that fidelity we owe to Jesus Christ, our only Lord and supreme head of his church, that lays us under this obligation.</P>
<P>We don't erect a Protestant supremacy and infalli∣bility upon the ruins of the Papal, nor undertake to maintain all the doctrines of Luther and Zuinglius, or Calvin, or the churches of France, or England, or Scotland. This would be to build up again what we have destroyed, and to ruin that liberty of examining and proving all things, that we may hold fast that which is good.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Reformation</HI> looks back to an original rectitude established by God in the very nature of things, and declared and settled by the only supreme authority of God himself, by those whom we are sure he em∣powered and qualified; and where these are contradict∣ed, we may reject all pretenders to a divine authority, <HI>to the law and to the testimony.</HI></P>
<P>God has given man his understanding to this purpose, which has an original liberty and power to observe
<PB N="102" REF="111"/>things, and enquire and judge with due care and circum∣spection, to discern between right and wrong, good and evil, that we might try things which differ, and <HI>approve things that are excellent.</HI> And whoever would engage our submission, must do it by <HI>commending themselves to our con∣science in the sight of God, by the manifestation of the truth.</HI></P>
<P>We therefore rejoice in the rise and progress of the reformation in Germany, Switzerland, Geneva, France (as it once was, oh! that it were such now) and the churches of England and Scotland. But our reforma∣tion must be according to our light, and in proportion to our advantages. We must so worship God as we think will be most acceptable to him; unite with those societies wherein we can receive the greatest edification and profit, and yet leave others without any uncha∣ritable censures, or so much as wishing to deprive them of that liberty we claim, and with the utmost reason for ourselves.</P>
<P>Therefore let us continue Protestants indeed, and we shall not in the end repent of any labour, hazards, or expences, that it may cost us. Let us adhere to our Bible; let us be humble and cautious, look to God by daily fervent prayer, that he that has called us to go out of Babylon, would conduct us to the end.</P>
<P>Let us be humble and cautious, not too severe upon imperfect, differing, or erring Protestants: let us keep our own conscience void of offence, and leave others to their great Master. Let us not seek the praise of men, or be discouraged at their censures. Judge nothing before its time, but wait for that time, when every one shall receive their praise of God.</P>
<P>I shall leave the reader to make a farther application of facts, relative to the necessity of a reformation, which have, or will occur in the sequel of the history<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The judicious reader may consult the three volumes of Tracts against Popery, collected and published in 1738.

<P>INtroductory to this part of the history, it is observ∣able the Christian religion was in the first ages ve∣nerable for its simplicity; but soon after, when the teachers of divers sorts of philosophy became Chris∣tians, they endeavoured to adorn it with the rules and doctrines of their several sects; to which the Jews, Greeks and others, added the ceremonies of their respective countries, to the end that the outward splen∣dor of such institutions, which was found to have no ill effect, might be converted to a better use: but these things, which for a long time were left to every man's liberty, and were only received by the private approbation of some particular persons, or churches, prevailed gradually by practice, and at length by the persuasion of their introducers and favourers, and the consent of councils, being turned into laws, were made necessary, and easily justified in the following ages of ignorance and barbarism. In the mean while the Bishops of Rome, who had always possessed a great share of authority in church-affairs, being disen∣gaged from the rivalship of the cities of Asia and Egypt, as also of Constantinople, which had aspired to the same supremacy, erected a certain spiritual king∣dom, usurped the supreme power, appointed Cardi∣nals as their assertors or counsellors; and so laid the foundation of a long series of successors in that domi∣nion;
<PB N="104" REF="113"/>none at first opposing their pretensions, because many of the European nations had received the Chris∣tian religion, by the instruction of such as were sent to them from Rome. This is the reason why the Latin or Romish church has introduced its customs and languages into the churches of so many other countries.</P>
<P>These Bishops, now called Popes, having once usurped authority in divine matters, soon proceeded to pub∣blish new decrees, to interpret the old, and to debar the common people from the use of the scriptures, pretending that it would be of very dangerous conse∣quences, if religion, the most important thing in the world, should be subjected to the senseless curiosity of the vulgar.</P>
<P>By these methods they so ordered matters that every thing was calculated for their own honour and profit. Then it was that the clergy fell into such li∣centiousness, both of life and manners, that even they themselves were obliged to own, that some remedy was wanting; and this necessarily tended to reforma∣tion, or to the amending and restoring of doctrine and manners, according to the primitive model. But they that could and ought to have done most in it, I mean the higher powers, both temporal and spiritual, took it least to heart, and the ecclesiastical or papal court, especially, was the most remiss of all; wherefore there arose from time to time meaner people in the church, who, observing its defects and abuses, began here and there to cry out against them, and to set their hands to the work of reformation. But the power of the Pope was now grown so great, that such as had at∣tempted, but in the least degree, to remove the scandal without him (not to say in spite of him) were im∣mediately crushed, since the temporal sword was always ready at his service, for the extirpation of whatever opposed him, and whatever he called the church.</P>
<PB N="105" REF="114"/>
<P>But the blood of the martyrs proved the seed of the true church, though it was maliciously attended with the loss of many valuable lives, whose zeal for the service of God, and their own salvation, and that of others, had led them to contend for the truth. It excited however a love to the sufferers, and in many a zeal mixed with humility for the promotion of truth; though in others it became intemperate against the persecuters, and was attended with some mischief. However, it pleased God to give success to these attempts, and by the reformation, such as it was, to enervate and drive out Popery from several churches and countries, and on the contrary to establish the unity of faith; at least with regard to necessary truths in many places, and even to cause a mutual for∣bearance with respect to such truths as are less neces∣sary, and a liberty of conscience, without which no religion can subsist, to appear and be countenanced in some churches, and effectually to heal many divi∣sions, that tend to banish truth itself, as well as charity, out of the church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An abstract from Mr. Brandt's Introduction to his History of the Reformation in the Low Countries, who quotes Grotius's Apology, chap. 3. Vitemb. Church History, and Hoof's History of the Netherlands.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The reformation succeeded first in the Netherlands; and this is properly said to commence, not at the re∣puted aera of the reformation, when truth in a good measure prevailed, but even from those early times, when the first opposition was made in most parts of Christendom, against the introduction of scanda∣lous errors and immoralities, and against the excessive growth of ecclesiastical pride, i. e. some hundred of years before Luther was raised up. For even the first discovery and resistance of those evils, though at that time cautiously and sparingly taken notice of, and likewise but little attended to, has since contributed to reform posterity, to whom the truth, that at first
<PB N="106" REF="115"/>was only presented at that distance of time, progres∣sively shined forth more entire, and with greater brightness and lustre. Hence we find that Mr. Gerrard Brandt, in his history, have taken notice of some re∣markable occurrences from the reformation of the clergy, which was attended with some success, at Gant, A. D. 712<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introduction to Brandt's History of the Reformation in the Low Countries, from the eighth century.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The putting heretics to death was scarcely heard of in the Netherlands till the year 1135, when some persons was accused of heresy at Utrecht, and burnt alive by command of the Emperor Lotharius<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Usser de Succes. Eccl. accid. chap. vii. Brandt. p. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Soon after the Waldenses became very numerous in France, when, being persecuted by the clergy, they flew to the Low Countries, where they were violently persecuted in 1163. Afterwards the office of the inquisition, the holy tribunal, as it is called, commenced against them 1199.</P>
<P>About the year 1290, Henry of Gant wrote against the papacy, particularly against the terrible curses, published by the clergy, and frequent persecutions, under the title <HI>of the abuses of papal power.</HI></P>
<P>One very considerable furtherance of the reforma∣tion, was the invention of printing, about the year 1400, or somewhat later, when Laurence Johnson Koster found out the art of composing letters or printing, which soon filled the world with great num∣ber of books; and the Bible, but tolerably written in vellum, which cost no less than four or five hundred crowns, might now be bought for sixty, and in a very few years for four or five; thus the vulgar, who could not reach the price of manuscript Bibles, found it easy to read the holy scriptures in print; and hither was the resource of the first reformers, to find out those necessary truths and duties, on which salvation de∣pends,
<PB N="107" REF="116"/>and for avoiding those errors and superstitions, which have been the bane of truth, religion and liberty, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abstract from Brandt's History, pag. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1412.] About this time John Laillier, a licen∣tiate in divinity, shewed himself a warm advocate against the Pope; and Jerom Savenarola preached and wrote against the prevailing errors and immoralities of that church, and the necessity of a reformation, both in the head as well as the members; and though his adversa∣ries procured him to be burnt, this tended to clip the wings of papal power, but in a few years there were other circumstances, which produced much greater consequences<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Picart's View of Religious Ceremonies, vol. v. p. 326.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1414.] Dr. John Huss, a minister in the city of Prague, a man of great learning, excellent wit, but more especially reverenced for his holy life and conversation, espoused the opinions of Wickliffe, and publickly dared to oppose the corruptions of the church of Rome, declaring against its arbitrary and unlimited power, and the licentiousness of her partizans, exploding many of her superstitions, which through ignorance or lust of power had been held in the highest venera∣tion, for which he with Jerom of Prague were cited be∣fore the council of Constance, and, upon their refusing to renounce their errors, were condemned to be burnt alive. Their answer, which incurred this most severe sentence, was, "We are lovers of the gospel, and true disciples of Jesus Christ; but that the church of Rome, and all other churches, have widely departed from the apostolical traditions." He was accordingly executed at Constance, though he came there to the synod with the passport of the Emperor Sigismund, whose word and troth were violated by the synod, which made
<PB N="108" REF="117"/>that remarkable declaration, "That the church was not obliged to keep faith with heretics<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brandt's History of the Reformation, vol. i. p. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> JEROM <HI>of</HI> PRAGUE.</HEAD>
<P>A. D. 1415.] Jerom of Prague is very justly ranked amongst the promoters of the reformation.</P>
<P>At the close of the last century, there arose a reli∣gious controversy in England, concerning sundry errors of Popery, by that great reformer John Wickliffe, and was from thence conveyed from England into Germany, where it kindled great commotions, both in church and state, but was nevertheless attended with these two happy effects; it put men upon the study of useful learning, and chiefly upon searching into the holy scripture and tradition; and it obliged the prelates to labour after the reformation of the manners of Christians, and of the ecclesiastical discipline.</P>
<P>Jerom of Prague was the companion and co mar∣tyr of Dr. Huss. He was educated in that university, where he was admitted Master of Arts, having ac∣quired great proficiency in all liberal endowments, and from a thorough conviction of the necessity of a reformation in the Romish church, and that he might promote this, with greater success, as well as being at that time accused of making disturbances at Hail∣delberg, he went over to England, were he copied great part of the writings of Wickliffe, on the most material points in dispute, and returned with them to Prague. Jerom was cited before the council of Con∣stance, the seventeenth of April 1415, when his friend Dr. Huss was confined in a castle near that city. He arrived at Constance the same month, when he was informed how his friend had been treated, and that he also would be seized: he went to Iberlingen, an imperial city, from whence he wrote to the Em∣peror and council, to desire a safe conduct, and one was presented him: after this he began his journey into Bohemia; but as he was returning to Bohemia,
<PB N="109" REF="118"/>he was stopt at Hirschru, and brought back to Con∣stance, and the next day carried as a prisoner before the council, when, by the strong importunity of friends, he was prevailed on to sign a public abjuration. This, as <HI>Guthrie</HI> informs us, was precipitately complied with, of which he sincerely repented, and upon re∣collection he reassumed a magnanimity and fortitude equal to the exigence of his case.—Poggius asserts, that he spoke with a quickness of sentiment, such a dignity of expression, and such strength of argument, that he seemed to equal the noblest of the ancient compositions. When some members of the council called out for him to put in his answers, he told the assembly that the ob∣jections against him were the effects of prepossession and prejudice; that therefore, in justice, they should permit him to lay open the whole tenor of his doctrine, life, and conversation, whereby he could indubitably wea∣ken and invalidate all the prepossessions, which ignorant zeal and open malice had rendered too strong against him, in his unhappy condition. He was told he could not expect such indulgence. This exhausted his pa∣tience, and he exclaimed to the whole assembly in these terms: "What barbarity is this! For three hundred and forty days have I been through all the variety of prisons: there is not a misery, there is not a want, that I have not experienced; to my enemies you have allowed the fullest scope of accusation; to me you deny the least opportunity of defence; not an hour will you indulge me in preparing for my trial; you have swallowed the blackest calumnies against me; you have represented me as a heretic, without knowing what is my doctrine; as an enemy to the faith, before you know what faith I professed; and as a persecutor of priests, before you could have any opportunity of understanding my sentiments on that head. You are a general council, in you center all this world can com∣municate of gravity, wisdom, and sanctity; but still you are men, and men are seduceable by appearance.
<PB N="110" REF="119"/>The higher your character is for wisdom, the greater ought your care to be not to deviate into folly; the cause I now plead is not my cause only, it is the cause of men, it is the cause of Christians, it is a cause which is to affect the rights of posterity: however, the ex∣periment is to be made in my person." He was never∣theless stigmatized as a heretic, and in his charge, which was read to him, called a derider of papal dignity, an enemy of the Christian religion, sentenced to be burnt, which he endured with great constancy, sing∣ing a hymn in the midst of encircling flames<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rolt's Lives of the principal Reformers, p. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> ULRICUS ZUINGLIUS.</HEAD>
<P>Ulricus Zuinglius, stiled the reformer of Switzer∣land, was born the first of January 1487, at Wilder∣hausen. He received the first rudiments of learn∣ing at Basil, and afterwards acquired much greater proficiency in the Greek and Hebrew at Bern, studied philosophy at Vienna, and then returned to Basil, and studied divinity, where he commenced Doctor in that science in 1505. He was soon after invited to Glaris, where he continued till 1516, and acquired great re∣putation as a preacher: he was soon after invited to Zurich, where with great assiduity he endeavoured to explain the scriptures, opposing the errors of the church of Rome, spoke in favour of many of the tenets of Luther, which he stiled evangelical truths; and con∣ducted the reformation in Switzerland, with as much progress as Luther had done in Saxony, though he carried himself with more moderation and pru∣dence. He propounded his doctrine in his sermons, which he preached four years successively in Zurich, and thereby prepared the minds of the people for its reception; but he would not attempt to make any al∣teration in the divine worship without the concurrence of the magistrates, and he caused an assembly to be
<PB N="111" REF="120"/>called for that purpose by the senate of Zurich, on the 29th of January 1523, that the differences among preachers, in matters of religion, might be composed. The assembly met upon the day appointed, when a great number of the clergy appeared; and the Bishop of Constance sent three deputies, among whom was John Fabir, his chief vicar. The Consul opened the conference, by declaring, that the sermons of Zuinglius had raised so many disputes in their city, that the se∣nate thought it the best way to allay these differences, by appointing a conference before the council of two hundred, to which all the clergy, both of the city and country, had been summoned. Zuinglius replied, "That the light of the gospel had been obscured, and almost extinguished, by human traditions; but that several eminent men had lately endeavoured to re∣store it, by preaching the word of God to the people in its purity: that he was one of that number, and, like them, had been treated as an heretic and seducer; tho' he had, for five years past, taught only what was contained in the holy scripture: that it was for this reason he had desired to give an account of his doc∣trine before the senate of Zurich, and the Bishop of Constance: that he thanked the senate for granting him this favour, and that he had drawn his doctrine into sixty-seven propositions, which, he was fully per∣suaded, were agreeable to the gospel; and he was ready to answer for himself, if any person would accuse him of error or heresy." The doctrine contained in these sixty-seven propositions may be reduced to the fol∣lowing articles. That the gospel is the only rule of faith: the church is the communion of saints; we ought to acknowledge no other head of the church but Jesus Christ: all traditions should be rejected: there is no other sacrifice but that of Jesus Christ: we have no need of any other intercessor with God than Jesus Christ: all sorts of meats may be eaten at all times: the habits of the monks smell of hypocrisy: marriage
<PB N="112" REF="121"/>is allowable to all men; and no man is obliged to make a vow of chastity, nor are priests at all obliged to live unmarried: excommunication ought not to be in∣flicted by the Bishop alone, but by the whole church, and notorious offenders only ought to be excommuni∣cated: the power which the Pope and Bishops assumes to themselves, is a piece of pride, that has no founda∣tion in the scripture: God alone can forgive sins; for confession of sin to a preist, is only to beg his ghostly advice: and works of satisfaction proceed from human tradition; and that the scripture does not teach us, that there is such a place as purgatory."</P>
<P>Zuinglius offered publickly to debate these points, which was accepted by Fabir; when he opposed such arguments in favour of the holy scriptures, as the rule of faith and practice, shewing, that there was no men∣tion made of the intercession of saints; and that if coun∣cils were fallible, whether their traditions and customs ought not to be rejected, when they are not grounded upon the authority of holy scripture? Fabir rested his answers upon the authority of the church and councils; but Zuinglius would abide only by the scriptures. The debates however ended, and the senate of Zurich published an edict, whereby it was ordained, that Zunglius should continue to teach and preach the gos∣pel, and the word of God, in his usual manner; and all pastors and teachers were enjoined not to preach any thing that could not be proved by the gospel and holy scripture. Thus his endeavours proved, in great measure, effectual, for the extirpation of Popish errors. He died in the year 1531.</P>
<P>The reformers at this time censured other gross cor∣ruptions. Simony had been an ancient and frequent complaint against the church of Rome. Exorbitant de∣mands were early made for the advancement of a Bishop to that dignity. Athanasius, Bishop of Thessalonica, deposited 60,000 crowns for his promotion to that see; besides which, the ministers of state demanded exorbitant fees; so that the Patriarchs have been long since kept
<PB N="113" REF="122"/>in a tributary, dependent, and even precarious state, liable, on the least failure in their payments, to be de∣posed. Such, we may add, are the genuine causes of that simony which is so general amongst their eccle∣siastics. The Patriarchs sell the mitre to the Bishop; the Bishop, his ordinations; the priest, the sacraments, mass, confessions, absolutions, &amp;c. and many other pious frauds are continually practised in that church, to the disgrace of ecclesiastical dignities, the source of contentions, and of many revolutions, which have taken place amongst the prelates of that ancient Papal church.</P>
<P>A. D. 1445.] The clergy having it now in their power, carry on a spiritual trade, that of indul∣gences, and masses for the soul, both of them inexhausti∣ble golden mines. The greatest crimes were set at a price, and made pardonable, as well as the smallest. The book of rates, which the confessors were to go∣vern themselves by in the sale of sins, and other mat∣ters, that was only so far lawful as the Pope pleased, were adjusted by the Papal court, where no bulls were writ for nothing. In this book of rates, which Wool∣fang Musculus afterwards published, we read of things very astonishing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Loc corum de ministris verbi, p. 40.

<P>A. D. 1462.] About this time, in order to obviate the scandal which both secular and regular clergy occasioned by the irregularity of their lives, the Romish church made use in particular of the order of the Franciscan Mendicants, who deceived the people by an affected humility, sobriety, and poverty; but it was still the same monk in another hood, and this was discovered and complained of at Amsterdam this same year.</P>
<P>A. D. 1500.] In every part of Christendom there now arose men of knowledge and judgment, who with their tongues and pens made war against Papal cor∣ruptions, and prepared the way for a farther reforma∣tion; and, among others, Erasmus, the Bishop of Cam∣bray, in his Latin translation of the Bible, with notes, lays open, and censures the lives of the monks, their ignorance, superstition, luxury, and intemperance; their ambition, their bloody persecutions, their com∣pulsion of conscience, and their massacring of heretics. He, nevertheless, adhered to the church of Rome, which he thought might and ought to reform herself, when admonished by him, and others, without schism or separation.</P>
<P>A. D. 1517.] Pope Leo X. by his generous and enterprising temper, had very much exhausted the treasury, and was obliged to make use of every inven∣tion, which might produce money, to support his pro∣jects, pleasures, and liberalities. Among others, the scheme of selling indulgences was suggested to him, as an expedient which had often served in former times to draw money from the Christian world, and make devout people willing contributors to the grandeur and riches of the church. The church was supposed to be possessed of a great stock of merit, as being entitled to all the good works of the saints, beyond what was necessary for their own
<PB N="115" REF="124"/>justification; and even to the merits of Christ himself, which were infinite and unbounded. From this unex∣hausted treasure the Pope might retail particular por∣tions, and by that traffic acquire money under the false pretence of resisting the Turks, subduing heretics, and, when obtained, diverting it to other purposes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's History.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is commonly believed that Leo, from the pene∣tration of his genius, and his acquaintance with lite∣rature, saw through the fallacy of those doctrines; which, as supreme Pontiff, he was obliged by his in∣terest to promote. He published a sale of a general indulgence, in the year 1517. Several branches of it were openly given away; the produce of Saxony, and the adjacent country, to his sister Magdalen, mar∣ried to Cibo, and she had farmed out the revenue to Arcemboldi, a Genoese, then a Bishop, formerly a merchant, who understood the lucrative arts of his former profession. Monks were employed to exagge∣rate the benefit of indulgences, by the most unbounded panegyrics: notwithstanding it must be acknowledged, that the licentious lives of the collectors of this revenue were no small scandal to the cause; and it was very natural for persons, so disposed, to take advantage of such an incident.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> MARTIN LUTHER.</HEAD>
<P>Martin Luther, an Augustine friar, professor in the university of Wirtemberg, being naturally of a warm temper, and very sensible of the great abuse of indul∣gences, and qualified to expose them, began publickly to declaim against all indulgences, and was at length led to call in question, and to deny the long acknow∣ledged authority of the Pope. Still as he enlarged his reading and study, his penetration increased, and he discovered other errors, which he publickly preached
<PB N="116" REF="125"/>against; and finding his opinions greedily hearkened to, he promulgated them by writing, discourses, con∣ferences, &amp;c. and daily increased the number of his disciples. All Saxony, all Germany, all Europe, were in a very little time filled with the voice of this daring innovator; and men, roused from that lethargy in which they had so long slept, began to enquire into, and consequently to reject, some long received opinions. The Elector of Saxony, favourable to Luther's doc∣trine, protected him from the violence of the Papal jurisdiction. The republic of Zurich even reformed their churches, according to the new model: many Sovereigns of the empire, and the imperial diet itself, shewed a favourable disposition towards it: and Luther, a man naturally inflexible and vehement, was incapa∣ble of being allured by promises, or terrified by threats, to relinquish the cause he had espoused.</P>
<P>The rumour of this attempt to reform the church soon reached England; and as there still subsisted in this kingdom great numbers of the Lollards, whose principles resembled those of Luther, these prin∣ples, and the parties, greatly increased among all ranks and denominations. Henry had been educated in a strict attachment to the church of Rome, and he bore no small prejudice against Luther, who, in his writings, had spoke with contempt of Thomas Aquinas, the King's favourite author. He opposed himself, therefore, to the progress of the Lutherian tenets, by all the influence which his extensive and almost abso∣lute authority conferred upon him. He wrote a book in Latin, against the principles of Luther, of which he sent a copy to Leo, who received so magnificent a present with great testimony of regard, and conferred on him the title of <HI>Defender of the Faith,</HI> an appella∣tion still retained by the Kings of England. Luther soon wrote an answer to Henry, and, without any re∣gard to the dignity of his antagonist, treated him with some degree of acrimony in his stile. The King wrote a farther answer to him; but the public greatly in∣clined
<PB N="117" REF="126"/>to favour the opinions of Luther, attributed to him the victory in the dispute; and new converts were daily acquired in every part of Europe.</P>
<P>The surprising progress of this sect may, in some mea∣sure, be attributed to the late invention of printing, and revival of learning; and as copies of the scriptures, and other antient monuments of the Christian faith, became more common, men perceived the innovations that were introduced after the first three centuries. Many of the powers assumed indeed by the church of Rome were very antient, and were prior to almost every political government established in Europe. But as the ecclesiasticks would not submit to possess their privileges as matters of civil right, which time would render valid, but appealed still to a divine origin, men were tempted to look into their primitive charter, and they could, without much difficulty, perceive its defect, in truth and authenticity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Hume's history, vol. i.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Luther particularly inveighed against the abuses of the court of Rome, with which men were at that time in general discontented, and exhorted Princes to rein∣state themselves in those powers, of which the incroach∣ing spirit of the ecclesiastics, and especially of the Sove∣reign Pontiff, had so long bereaved them. He con∣demned celibacy and monastic vows; blamed the ex∣cessive riches, the idleness, the libertinism of the clergy; and as the ecclesiastics had hitherto conducted a willing and stupid audience, and were totally unacquainted with controversy, and every species of literature, they were unable to defend themselves against men armed with authorities, and proper citations on popular topics.</P>
<P>In the mean time the progress against Luther being carried on at Rome, the Pope summoned him to ap∣pear there in sixty days; but fearing he should be condemned at Rome, he published a protestation in form of law, and appealed to a general council.</P>
<PB N="118" REF="127"/>
<P>In 1520, Luther sent his book <HI>De Libertate Christi∣ana</HI> to the Pope, wherein he grounds justification upon faith, and asserts his Christian liberty, rescued from the bondage of human traditions, and particularly the slavery of popish impositions, and afterwards denies the authority of the church of Rome.</P>
<P>The Pope, irritated at this, began to apply his last remedies, condemned his book, and had it burnt, ex∣communicated him, and sent the bull to the Elector of Saxony, and the university of Wirtemberg, who a∣greed to defer the publication of it. In the mean time Luther wrote against the bull, with great warmth and freedom, and appealed once more from the Pope to a general council, and publickly burnt the bull with his own hands at Wirtemberg.</P>
<P>The Emperor Charles V. declared against Luther, and ordered his books to be burnt. Upon opening the diet of Worms, Luther appeared there, and made a speech in defence of himself. This was by the Em∣peror's leave; but when the Emperor found he was not to be influenced by the decision of councils, Luther was put under the ban of the empire, as a schismatic: but the Duke of Saxony gave private orders to convey him to the castle of Wesberg, where he remained con∣cealed for three quarters of a year. This he calls his isle of Patmos, and here he wrote several books, par∣ticularly against <HI>Auricular Confession, Private Masses, Monastic Vows,</HI> and the <HI>Celibacy of the Clergy.</HI> About this time the university of Paris condemned one hun∣dred propositions taken out of his books; and King Henry VIII. of England wrote against him, in defence of the seven sacraments: to which he replied, both to the Sorbonne and the King of England.</P>
<P>Soon after Luther broke from his retirement, and ventured to publish a bull against the Pope's bull, and published part of his translation of the Bible, in which he departed from the <HI>Vulgate,</HI> so long authorised and received by the church.</P>
<PB N="119" REF="128"/>
<P>In 1521, the Elector of Saxony, who had all along fa∣voured and protected Luther, now gave him leave to re∣form the churches of Wirtemberg as he thought fit: and the same year had the satisfaction to see a league con∣tracted between Gustavus, King of Sweden, and Fre∣deric King of Denmark; who both agreed to establish Lutheranism in their dominions; and now Luther's persuasion, which from the Upper Saxony had spread itself into the northern provinces, began to be perfectly settled in the duchies of Lunenburg, Brunswick, Mecklenburgh, and Pomerania, and in the Arch∣bishopricks of Magdeburgh and Bremen, and in the towns of Hamburgh, Wismar, Rostock, and all along the Baltic, as far as Livonia and Prussia.</P>
<P>Luther now left off the habit of a monk, and refused the title of Reverend Father, and married a nun; ex∣horting all ecclesiastics and monks to follow his ex∣ample.</P>
<P>In 1526, Philip, Landgrave of Hesse, turned Lu∣theran, which gave great life and vigour to this party.</P>
<P>In March 1529, the diet of Spire decreed, that Ca∣tholicks should not have liberty to change their reli∣gion, and that the Lutherans should deliver nothing in their sermons contrary to the received doctrines of the church. The Lutheran Princes entered a solemn pro∣testation against this decree, from whence came the name of Protestants, taken up first by the Lutherans, and afterwards received among the Calvinists.</P>
<P>Mr. Chambers has given us the following account of the progress of the doctrines of Luther, with some other remarkable particulars, viz. The first who re∣ceived Lutheranism were the people of Mansfeld and the Saxons; it was preached at Kreichsaw in 1521; it was received at Goslar, Rostock, Riga in Livonia, Rent∣ling, and at Hall in Suabia, at Augsburg, Hamburg, Treptow, and in Pomerania, in 1522; in Prussia in 1523; at Einbech in the duchy of Lunenburg, at Nuremberg and Breslaw, in 1525; in Hesse 1526, at
<PB N="120" REF="129"/>Aldenburg, Strasburg, and Brunswick, in 1528; at Gottingen, Lemgou, and Lunenburg, in 1530; at Munster, and Paderborn, in Westphalia, in 1532; at Ethlingen, and Ulm, in 1533; in the duchy of Grubenhagen, at Hanover, and in Pomerania, in 1534; in the Duchy of Wirtemburg in 1535; at Cothus, in the Lower Lusace, in 1537; in the county of Lippe in 1538; in the electorate of Brandenburg, in Bremen, Hall in Saxony, Leipsic in Misnia, and at Quedlenburg, in 1539; at Embden in East Friseland, Hailbron, Halberstadt, and Magdeburg, in 1540; in the Palatinate of the Duchy of Newburg, at Regens∣burg and Wissmar, in 1542; at Buxtende, Hildesheim, and at Osnaburg, in 1543; at the Lower Palatinate in 1546; in Mecklenburg, in 1552; in the Marquisate of Durlach, and that of Hochburg, in 1556; in the county of Bentheim in 1564; at Haguenaw, and in the Lower Marquisate of Baden, in 1568; and in the Duchy of Magdeburg in 1570.</P>
<P>Lutheranism has undergone some alterations since the time of its founder. Luther rejected the epistle of St. James, as inconsistent with the doctrine of St. Paul, in relation to justification; he also set aside the apoca∣lypse: both which are now received as canonical in the Lutheran church. Luther reduced the sacraments to two, viz. baptism and the eucharist; but he be∣lieved the impanation, or consubstantiation, that is, the matter of the bread and wine, remain with the body and blood of Christ; and it is in this article that the main difference between the Lutheran and English churches consists. Luther maintained the mass to be no sacrifice, exploded the adoration of the host, au∣ricular confession, meritorious works, indulgences, pur∣gatory, the worship of images, &amp;c. which had been introduced in the corrupt times of the Romish church. He also espoused the doctrine of free-will, denied predestination, asserted that we are not necessitated in all that we do, that all our actions done in a state of
<PB N="121" REF="130"/>sin, and involuntary, are pardonable on repentance; but some of his adherents asserted that we are only justified by the imputation of the merits and sanctifi∣cation of Christ: Some authors reckon thirty-nine different sects which at different times have sprung up among the Lutherans.</P>
<P>The chief difference between the Lutherans and Calvinists is, that the Lutherans have Bishops and Superintendants for the government of the church,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Calvin and Lu∣ther com∣pared.</NOTE> whereas the Calvinist clergy are all equal, and govern their churches by a Presby∣tery. They also differ about the corporal pre∣sence, in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper: the Lutherans hold consubstantiation; but the Calvinists esteem this sacrament only a commemoration of our Saviour's death. The Lutherans likewise look upon man as a free agent; but the Calvinists maintain, that all his actions are decreed, and that he has no freedom of choice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salmon, p. 171.</NOTE>. Calvin differed not much as to other points of faith; he held the same principles as to imputative justice, and the certainty of our justification by faith, which he extended even to an assurance of eternal salvation. He also added an impossibility of falling finally from grace, and the salvation of the children of believers, who die before they have been baptised. He likewise condemned, with more severity than the Lutherans, the invocation of saints, the worship and use of images, vows, celibacy of priests, fasting, holy days, sacrifice of the mass, adoration of the eu∣charist, indulgences, and all the sacraments, except baptism and the Lord's Supper<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dupin, p. 184.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To stop the progress of Luther's doctrine, the universities of Louvain and Cologne, which had already condemned him, burnt his book. He, on the contrary, burnt the Pope's bull of excommunication, together with the papal decretal: after this he was
<PB N="122" REF="131"/>cited to the diet of Worms, where he went very much against his friends consent, setting before him the fate of John Huss; but nothing of that kind dismayed him. When he came there, he bravely defended himself, refusing to retract any thing he had said, unless he could be confuted by scripture. The Bishop of Triers asking him, what were the properest means to heal these evils, he answered, Thos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which Gamaliel proposed to the Jews. But the Emp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Charles V. being set on by the creatures of the Pope, put Luther under the ban of the empire; but Frederic the Elector of Saxony se∣creted him a long while in a certain castle, and after∣wards publickly defended him. Placarts were now put in use. The first, published in these provinces against Luther, his doctrine, books and followers, was in the year 1521.</P>
<P>Another placart was published at Mecklin against Lutheranism, March 14, 1526.</P>
<P>Another in 1529.</P>
<P>Another, still more severe, and made perpetual, in 1540; upon which a dreadful persecution ensued at Louvain.</P>
<P>The persecution now spread itself far and near through the Low Countries, and reached also, in the year 1536, a foreigner of good name and learning, William Tindall, an Englishman, who having translated the New Testament into his mother tongue, and dis∣persed it in his country, was apprehended for it at Antwerp, carried to Vilvorde, and there strangled, and afterwards burnt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Martyrs, p. 109. Brandt, vol. i. p. 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Erasmus now writes in favour of toleration zea∣lously, for uniting and agreeing on terms of accommo∣dation, whereby the persecution that then prevailed might have a speedy and effectual stop. But Martin <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucer relates, that there were three things which pre∣vented his joining in Luther's reformation; first, that his conscience was not sufficiently convinced; secondly,
<PB N="123" REF="132"/>that he thought many of the Lutherans strangers to gospel-sincerity; thirdly, the great discord between the chief instruments in the work; and censured this point in particular, that most of them denied free-will. Soon after, about the close of this year, this great man died<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Corpet's Divine Tribunal, in Dutch, p. 521. Brandt's Hist. vol. i. 74.</NOTE>.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> ERASMUS.</HEAD>
<P>Erasmus is generally ranked amongst the reformers. He was born on the twenty-eighth of October 1467, at Rotterdam; he prosecuted his studies both in Eng∣land and elsewhere, so that he became a person of great repute in the scripture, and was created Doctor of Divinity in Bononia. Notwithstanding, though he saw through the errors of the church of Rome, he conti∣nued a member of that church, and rather contented himself with some efforts, for the promotion of peace and charity, among Christians of different sentiments, than attempt the laborious task of reformation.</P>
<P>Having been asked, says Dr. Jortin, whether I would decide the question, what was the religion of Eras∣mus? I shall only observe, that Erasmus, if he had had an absolute power to establish a form of religion in any country, would have been a moderate man, and a latitudinarian. As to the Credenda, he would have proposed few articles of faith, and those with a primitive simplicity. Erasmus said, that Arianism was rather a faction and a schism, than a heresy; and that Arius was ill used by the consubstantialists. He also defended the doctrine of subordination, and there∣fore hath been falsely accused of Arianism by many ec∣clesiasticks. But a man may act like Erasmus, with∣out being a perfidious person, and an apostate, with∣out sinning against the Holy Ghost, and without doing violence to his conscience. This worthy man spent a
<PB N="124" REF="133"/>long and laborious life, in an uniform pursuit of two points; in opposing barbarous ignorance, and blind superstition, and in promoting useful literature and true piety. These glorious prospects he endeavoured to accomplish in a mild and gentle manner, never attacking the persons of men, but only the faults of the age, until hard necessity constrained him to reply to those who assaulted him with the utmost malice and disingenuity. It cannot be denied, that, taking all things together, Erasmus was what they call a Catholic; but he did not see, without joy, the first steps of Luther, and was greatly concerned when he thought Lutherism near its ruin. There is no ne∣cessity to suppose, that Erasmus acted against his con∣science in adhering to the church of Rome; he declares his hatred of discord to such, that he disliked even truth itself, if it was seditious; he acknowledges he had no inclination to die for the sake of truth. He flourished about the year 1520, and died about the year 1536<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jortin's Life of Erasmus, p. 1. &amp; seq.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> JOHN OECOLAMPADIUS.</HEAD>
<P>John Oecolampadius, stiled the German reformer, born in Franconia in 1482, was educated at the uni∣versity of Heidelburg, where he received the degree of bachelor, at fourteen years of age; after he had acquired much skill of the learned languages, and was held in great esteem for preaching in 1522<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dupin, p. 105.</NOTE>. He reti∣red to Basil in Switzerland, and was preacher at the church of Saint Martin, where he soon introduced the doctrines of Luther, administered baptism, cele∣brated divine service in the vulgar tongue, gave the people the communion under both kinds, and rejected many of the ceremonies of the Romish church, and wrote many pieces in defence of Protestant principles.
<PB N="125" REF="134"/>He spent great part of his life in reconciling the differ∣ences that subsisted amongst different parties of the reformed; he wrote to Servetus in relation to some errors he had espoused on the subject of the Trinity; but, as it happens often to persons of the best inten∣tions, he met with great calumny and ill-treatment from his adversaries; though his piety recommended him greatly to the esteem and regard of all. Upon the whole, his learning and doctrine were such, that even Cardinal Sardonit, upon hearing the news of his death, spoke of him in the most friendly terms, and wished that he could lawfully grieve for the loss of him. He died in 1531, and was buried at Basil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dupin, Collier, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In November 1522, a diet being held at Nurem∣burg, Adrian sends to all the Princes in Germany, requiring them passionately to suppress Luther, ac∣cording to the decree at Worms; confessing never∣theless many abuses in ecclesiastical government, which he therefore promised by degrees to redress— But the message pleased neither side; the Cardinals at Rome disliking Adrian's free declaration, and the Princes there as little approving the slow and indirect methods taken, for reforming the many enormities which were then used in the Romish church, as may appear by the <HI>Centum Gravamina.</HI> This consists of an hundred articles, which were drawn up by the Germans, and presented to Pope Adrian; the substance of which are digested in their order, in Lord Herbert's life of King Henry, pag. 125 to 134, and concludes thus: Wherefore, by way of final petition, the said secular estates of the Roman empire, beseech his Holiness to take away, amend or abrogate the said grievances, or otherwise they themselves would take such course as may effect it.</P>
<P>These abuses and grievances being published, Luther became more bold and magnanimous, insomuch that at
<PB N="126" REF="135"/>Wirtemberg he attempted to abolish the old mass, and to frame a new liturgy.</P>
<P>A. D. 1517 to 1523.] About this period, animated by truth, and zealous for a reformation, many pas∣tors and societies jointly and severally attempted it in their respective provinces and countries, and tried, by the best representations of their cause, to influence the Princes of their States, to permit and tolerate a re∣formation. To this purpose was that confession of faith, drawn up by Zuinglius, pastor of Zurich, to explain to Francis I. the grounds of his complaints, and that of others. Therein, he boldly tells that Prince, that he hopes to see, in the assembly of the saints, at the glorious consummation of all things, all the faith∣ful, zealous and courageous in the faith, once deli∣vered to the saints, uniting in one great assembly in the presence of God, and distinguished with peculiar marks of his favour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An abstract from the History of the Variations in Religion, amongst the Protestant Churches, from the French of Mon.

<P>In this confession of faith, which was received by all the Switzers, he explained clearly, that the body of Jesus Christ from his ascension was no more, but in heaven, and was impossible to be elsewhere; that in∣deed it was, as it were, present in the <HI>Bene,</HI> through the contemplation of the faithful, but not really, neither by its essence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 128.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The synod of Czenger, a city of Poland, having rejected the papistical transubstantiation, shewed that the Lutheran consubstantiation is likewise inconsistent; because as the wine, at the nuptials of Cana, could not have been such, without a real alteration from the nature and properties of water, so likewise the bread of the <HI>Bene,</HI> cannot be substantially the body of Christ, unless it be changed into his flesh, losing the form and substance of bread<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bossuet of the Variations, p. 96. lib. 2.

<P>A.

<P>Luther himself, in a council held at Smalcade, ex∣claims against the undue usurpation of power and au∣thority of the Pope; that the Pope is not <HI>jure divino;</HI> that his claim thereto is arrogance, and no less than blasphemy; and that the measures, pursued in conse∣quence of such pretended power, are impious and devi∣lish; that the church can, and ought to subsist without having a visible chief; and that the best means of go∣verning and supporting the Christian church is, that all Bishops, though they are unequal in their talents, should remain equal with respect to their office, as ministers, no one claiming superior power to the rest, acknowledging one head, even Jesus Christ; and, lastly, asserted, that the Pope is the true Antichrist<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bossuet of the Variations, lib. iv. p. 233.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About the year 1522, Anabaptists first became Ana∣remarkable in Switzerland, who opposed <HI>Zuin-baptist. glius</HI> in that opinion, asserting that infant baptism was not agreeable to scripture, which gave rise to the first edict against them at Zurich, in which there was a penalty of a silver mark, or two guilders, Dutch money, to be paid by all that suffered themselves to be rebaptised, or should withhold baptism from their children; and it was also further declared, that those who publickly opposed this order should suffer more severe treatment. Accordingly Felix Mans was drowned at Zurich, upon the sentence pronounced by Zuinglius, He that is rebaptised with water, let him be drowned in the water. The Zuinglians had

<P>Henry Bullinger was born the eighteenth of July 1504, in Switzerland. At fifteen years of age he was sent to Cologne, where he applied himself most earnestly to classical learning, and the nature of his studies soon disposed him to forsake the Romish communion, as soon as occasion offered, and for that reason he de∣clined accepting any of the orders or habits of the pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.—In 1523, he attended the preaching of Zuin∣glius, which occasioned him to renew his study of the Greek language, and he undertook the office of the ministry by a mission from the synod, and in 1528 he accompanied Zuinglius at the famous dispute at Bern. In 1529, he was made pastor of the reformed at Bremgardton, but was soon after by persecution driven from thence; and during his retirement Bullin∣ger wrote a book, to shew that the council of Trent had another design, than to oppress the truth; and for many years afterward employed himself in de∣fending the reformation. His zeal, however, was not confined to matters of importance, the holy doctrine of the ubiquity of God, and other scholastic points, too much engrossed his attention, and he adopted some other sentiments, no ways favourable to the prin∣cipal business of the reformation. He wrote many books on miscellaneous subjects, and died on the seven∣teenth of September 1575, after he had exercised his ministry forty-three years.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> JOHN CALVIN.</HEAD>
<P>John Calvin was born at Soissons, a city of France, June 6, 1509. His father's name was Gerard Calvin, who gave his son a liberal education.</P>
<PB N="132" REF="143"/>
<P>From the grammar-school, he sent him to Paris, and placed him with Maturinus Corderius, a man well esteemed both for probity and learning.</P>
<P>His father, from the beginning, designed him for the study of divinity, which he judged him to be much inclined to, being religiously addicted from his child∣hood. He procured a benefice of the bishop for him, in Soissons, in which place John, before his ordination, preached divers sermons to the people. But this purpose of his was afterwards altered; for his father, seeing the study of the law was the surer step to riches and honour, altered his mind, and his son, growing into acquaintance with a certain kins∣man of his, was by him instructed in the true reli∣gion, whereupon he applied himself to the study of the sacred scriptures, and began to abominate the su∣perstitious services in the Popish church.</P>
<P>Whilst he was employed in these studies, he ne∣glected not that of divinity, so that he preached divers sermons in a neighbouring town. But, whilst he was thus busied, news came to him of his father's death, which called him back into his own country. Having settled his affairs there, he went to Paris, being now about twenty-four years old. After a few months stay at Paris, he grew acquainted with all that professed the reformed religion; and amongst the rest, with Stephen Forgeus, a famous merchant, who after∣wards sealed the truth with his blood.</P>
<P>From henceforward, at the earnest request of all those that held their private meetings in Paris, he laid aside all other studies, and wholly applied himself to that of divinity. At this time Nicholas Cope was rector of the University at Paris; who, being to make an oration on All-saints day, at the instigation of John Calvin, spake of religion more purely and clearly than he used to do. This the parliament of Paris was angry at, insomuch that they cited him before them: but, as he went, some of his friends advised him to
<PB N="133" REF="144"/>take heed of his adversaries; whereupon he returned home, and, immediately after, left France, and went to Basil.</P>
<P>The officers, sent by the parliament, searching for Cope, went into Calvin's house, who, by chance, not being at home, they ransacked his study, and amongst his papers found many of his friends letters, which had like to have endangered the lives of many. But it pleased God to divert that storm, by the prudent and pious diligence of the Queen of Navarre, the only sister of King Francis, a woman of an admirable wit, and exceeding tender of the professors of the reformed religion. She also sent for Mr. Calvin to her court, used him very honourably, and heard him gladly. But, Mr. Calvin finding Paris too hot for his abode, went to Xantonge, where, sojourning with a friend, at his request, he drew up short admonitions, which were dispersed amongst certain priests, to be taught to their people, that so their people might, by little and little, be drawn to searching out the truth.</P>
<P>Mr. Calvin published a form of Christian doctrine, and a catechism, containing the chief heads of reli∣gion; and, a public scribe reading them, the people of Geneva swore together to those heads of religion and discipline.</P>
<P>About the same time, observing that there were many in France that knew, and were convinced of the truth, and yet indulged themselves, as if it were enough that they reserved their hearts for Christ, tho' they were present at the Popish services, he published two elegant epistles: one, to exhort the flying idola∣try: the other, of the Popish priesthood. But whilst he, Calvin, was thus employed, he met with grievous seditions at home.</P>
<P>The gospel indeed was entertained, and Popery ab∣jured in Geneva; but many were not reformed from the profane and scandalous courses which they had
<PB N="134" REF="145"/>learned of the Popish clergy; and the antient fends amongst the chief families were not yet laid aside. These, at first, were gently admonished, and, when that prevailed not, more sharply reprehended; and, when yet they continued stubborn, and the city, by the factions of private persons, was divided into par∣ties, Farrel, Calvin, and Caroldus, did openly profess, that they could by no means administer the Lord's supper to persons who were at such enmity amongst themselves.</P>
<P>Upon this occasion the Syndies which were chosen for that year at Geneva (who, for the time, are the chief magistrates, assembling, the captains of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di∣tious persons so far prevailed, that these three worthy servants of Christ were commanded, within two days, to depart the city. When this decree was brought to Calvin, he said: "Truly, if I had served men, I should have had but an ill reward; but it is well that I have served him who doth always perform to his servants what he hath once promised."</P>
<P>Calvin went to Basil, and thence to Strasbourg; where, by the desire of the senate, he was made pro∣fessor of divinity, which place he discharged with great applause of learned men; and, by the consent of the senate, planted the French church there, and settled discipline in it. Calvin settled in another place, and a new church erected.</P>
<P>At this time Cardinal Sadolet, a man of great elo∣quence, seeing the flock deprived of such able and vigilant shepherds, thought it a sit time to ensnare them; for which end he wrote letters, directed to his dear friends (as he called them) the senate, council, and people of Geneva, in which he omitted no argu∣ments, whereby he might persuade them to return into the bosom of the Romish church. There was no man in Geneva that would undertake to answer the same; so that probably these letters would have done much mischief, but that they were written in a foreign language. But, when Calvin had read them, forgetting all the wrongs
<PB N="135" REF="146"/>which had been done him, he returned an answer so speedily and eloquently, that the Cardinal, despairing of accomplishing his end, wholly gave over his design.</P>
<P>Mr. Calvin continued at Strasbourg to the year 1541. In which the Emperor Charles V. assembled two diets, the one at Worms, the other at Ratisbon, for composing the differences about religion: at both which Mr. Calvin was present, to the great advan∣tage of the churches, and where he was most lovingly entertained by Philip Melancthon, and Gaspar Cruciger. He also had much private conference with them about the sacrament of the Lord's supper, and they could not but approve of his opinion therein.</P>
<P>The city of Geneva began to call for Farrell and Calvin; but when, by no means, they could recover Farrell, they used all their endeavours to procure Calvin; and, for that end, sent ambassadors to Strasbourg.</P>
<P>The senate of Strasbourg were exceeding unwilling to hearken to it; and Calvin himself, abhorring to enter into new troubles, and finding great success at∣tended his ministry at Strasbourg, did absolutely refuse to return. Besides, Bucer, and the other pastors, did profess their great unwillingness to part with him.</P>
<P>But the Genevians still pressing hard for him, Bu∣cer, at last, thought their requests should be conde∣scended to. This falling out just at the time when Calvin, with Bucer, was going to the diet at Ratisbon, his return was delayed for a time; when they chose Peter Viret: and, indeed, this made Mr Calvin far more willing to return, when he saw that he was to have such a collegue.</P>
<P>Mr. Calvin went to Geneva, September the 13th 1541, being singularly welcomed by the people, and especially by the senate, who acknowledged the won∣derful mercy of God towards them, in restoring him to them. And whereas the senate of Strasbourg had decreed, that, after a time, he should return to them
<PB N="136" REF="147"/>again, that of Geneva would never give over, till they had reversed that decree, which, at last, was yielded to by them of Strasbourg, yet with this proviso, that the pension, which they had settled upon him, should still be continued to him. But Mr. Calvin could never be persuaded to receive it, caring for nothing less than for riches. Mr. Calvin, being thus restored to his church, and perceiving that the city needed such bridles, he professed that he could not comfortably exercise his ministry amongst them, except, together with the doctrine of the gospel, that they would em∣brace the Presbyterian government, for the well re∣gulating of the church. Hereupon elders were chosen, and a model of government was drawn up.</P>
<P>His ordinary labours were these: every other Sabbath he preached twice; Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, he read his divinity-lectures: every Thursday he assisted in the consistory for the ecclesiastical discipline On Fridays he read a lecture for the clearing hard places of the scriptures; answered many adversaries to the truth; wrote many letters to sundry places. So that we have cause to wonder how it was possible for one man to undergo so many businesses.</P>
<P>Besides his fore mentioned labours, he had also the charge and business of a family, and many foreign em∣ployments; for God so blessed his ministry, that, from all parts of the Christian world, he was sought to, partly for advice in matters of religion, and, partly, to hear him preach: so that, at the same time, there was an Italian church, an English church, and a Spa∣nish church, and the city seemed too little to entertain all that came to it for his sake.</P>
<P>In 1542, Mr. Calvin met with many afflictions, some at home, but especially by the fury of the ad∣versaries of the truth abroad in France and Italy, whence they drove away many professors of the gospel, for the comfort of whom he laid himself out exceed∣ingly, writing many encouraging letters every way,
<PB N="137" REF="148"/>both to those that were escaped, and to those that yet remained within the lion's jaws.</P>
<P>In 1545 was that abominable and cruel edict which the parliament of Aquitaine set forth against the poor Waldenses of Merindol, Cabriers, and those parts; whereby unheard-of cruelties were exercised, not against some few, but against all of them, without any distinc∣tion of age or sex.</P>
<P>Some of those that escaped, flying to Geneva, Calvin was the more afflicted for them, and careful of them, because, a little before, he had written con∣solatory letters to them, and sent them faithful pastors, and had also (where they were in danger before) pre∣served them by his intercession to the German princes.</P>
<P>In 1546, one of the senators, in a public assembly of the people, blamed Calvin as one that taught false doctrine, suborned (as was supposed) by two of the college of pastors, both of them being drunkards, and, therefore, fearing the severity of the laws. But Mr. Calvin made little account of this. Yet the man who accused him was called before the senate, and, his cause being heard, was condemned for slander; and those two drunken ministers, who had set him on, were removed out of their places.</P>
<P>The year 1547 proved far worse; indeed that age saw not a more calamitous time than that was: the churches of Germany seemed to be utterly subverted, the Protestant Princes taken, and cities yielding up themselves, after so great labours used, and so great difficulties passed through, in planting the gospel amongst them. With what grief Mr. Calvin was afflicted for the desolations of the churches, is not easy to express, especially, if we consider that great affection which he bore to them, though far remote from him, which indeed was no other than if he had supported them all upon his shoulders. Indeed he was wonderfully grieved when he heard of those holy men, his worthy friends Philip Melancthon, Bucer,
<PB N="138" REF="149"/>Peter Martyr, &amp;c. in so great danger that they seemed nearer death than life.</P>
<P>In the midst of these contentions, the church of Geneva did wonderfully increase, and Mr. Calvin was very solicitous to entertain and provide for such as were banished for the name of Christ.</P>
<P>In the year 1550, the church of Christ enjoyed peace, and then it was decreed in Geneva, that the ministers, not only in their sermons, which many neglected, and others heard with small profit, but, from house to house, should divide the city amongst them, and require of every family an account of their faith; by which means it is scarce credible what profit came to the people.</P>
<P>In the year 1553, Michael Servetus, having pub∣lished a book filled with errors, was, at Vienna, cast into prison for the same. But, making an escape, he came to Geneva, thinking to pass further; but being discovered, and Calvin acquainting the magistrates with it, they cast him into prison. Many means were used to bring him to repentance; but, when he would not be brought to recantation, he was condemned to death, and, upon the 27th of October, burned alive. This was no small reflection on the character of Calvin.</P>
<P>About this time a grievous calamity befel the church of England by the death of King Edward VI. which was a grievous wound to all the reformed churches.</P>
<P>Soon after, the care of the English exiles lay heavy upon him; some of them were come to Embden, and others to Frankfort, all sending to Calvin for advice and counsel. How great pains he took this year for several churches, may appear by the multitude of epistles wrote by him, by which he stirred up many noblemen to embrace the gospel, and strengthened many of the brethren, some of whom were in extreme danger, and others already cast into bonds.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="150"/>
<P>At this time a grievous persecution rising at Paris, it was a great affliction to Mr. Calvin; many being taken when they were assembled in St. James's Street, for the celebration of the Lord's supper, being about eighty in number, the rest escaping by the benefit of the night; who, the next morning, were led to prison, loaden with scorns and reproaches, though some of them were noble women of good account.</P>
<P>There were also some false witnesses suborned against them, which the credulous multitude were too apt to believe; there were, therefore, seven of them brought forth to be burned, amongst whom there was a noble woman, who, with six others, shewed admirable pa∣tience; and whereas they were accused of promiscuous whoredoms at their meetings, a learned man, who had lately been their pastor, easily confuted those lies; and the German Princes, interceding in their behalf (which Mr. Calvin procured with admirable celerity) the tem∣pest was, in a good measure, blown over.</P>
<P>A. D. 1559 was famous for the league entered into between the two most potent kings of Spain and France, strengthened by affinity betwixt them, which was like∣ly to prove fatal to Geneva.</P>
<P>In the mean time Calvin (though sickly) laboured hard, comforting the afflicted churches; as also by his frequent and fervent prayers, craving help of God. Whilst all things were full of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rror, the King of France, in the great marriage-solemnity which was made for the confirmation of the peace, in his running at tilt, received his death's wound, and that by the hand of the captain of his guard, by whom, a little before, he had apprehended and imprisoned several senators.</P>
<P>About this time the Bohemians sent two of their brethren to Calvin, to desire his judgment about some matters of religion, whom he lovingly satisfied, ex∣horting them also that they would enter into a nearer con∣junction with other reformed churches. At the same
<PB N="140" REF="151"/>time also, Queen Mary being dead, and Queen Elizabeth succeeding, many of the French, relying upon her piety and humanity, fled for refuge into England, with the consent of that reverend divine Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London; and craved leave of her, that one might be sent from Geneva, to plant a French church there.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of this year, King Francis, of France, died suddenly, and that in such a juncture of time, when all things seemed desperate. King Charles IX. a child, was scarce entered on his reign, when, by a herald, letters, subscribed with his name, were brought to Geneva, wherein he complained that many were sent from thence, who infected his kingdom, desiring that they might be presently called back; threatening, that otherwise he would revenge that injury.</P>
<P>Calvin, being hereupon sent for by the senate, an∣swered in his own, and in his collegues names, that, at the request of the churches of France, they had ex∣horted certain men who were sound in the faith, and of a holy life, that they should not be wanting to lend their help to their country in so holy a cause; and that this they had done, not to disturb the kingdom, but that the people might be taught the gospel of peace; and, if they were accused for any thing further than this, they were ready to answer their accusers before the King: so this business went no further.</P>
<P>In the year 1562, God gave peace and liberty to the French churches, by a public edict of the Kings: but not long after the King of Navarre, presently after the Duke of Guise had committed that abominable massacre at Vassy, began a civil war, which continued many years after, to the miserable devastation of France. It cannot be spoken how much Calvin was afflicted therewith, which so far increased his disease, that it was easy to divine, that it would not be long before he would be translated to a better life; yet did he not desist from exhorting and comforting every one, nor from preaching and reading his ordinary lectures.</P>
<PB N="141" REF="152"/>
<P>In the year 1563 his disease did much increase; yet, even then, he could not be persuaded to abstain from his public labours: but when, by necessity, he was obliged, he was busy at home, either in giving coun∣sel to those that sought it, or in dictating to his scribes.</P>
<P>In the year 1564, February 6, he preached his last sermon, and from thenceforward spoke little, and would now and then be carried to the congregation. His diseases, contracted by the incredible labours both of his mind and body, were many; for besides that, he was but of a weak body, lean, and inclinable to a con∣sumption, slept little, and spent a great part of the year in preaching, teaching, and dictating. For at least ten years together he abstained from dinners, taking no food at all till supper, was often troubled with the head-a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, which his abstinence only could cure. He was also troubled with the piles, which at length proved ulcerous, and for five years before his death did many times spit blood; when his quartan ague left him, the gout took him, then the cholic, and lastly the stone.</P>
<P>The physicians applied what remedies they could, and though tormented with so many diseases, yet was never heard to utter one word unbecoming a Christian.</P>
<P>May the 27th, he seemed to speak more strongly, and with less difficulty than usual; but this was but a lightening before death. In the evening, about eight o'clock, on a sudden, signs of present death appeared, and soon after yielded up his spirit, without the least struggling, having had his understanding, memory, and voice, even to the last.</P>
<P>Calvinism having began in Geneva in 1536, it prevailed not only in many parts of Germany, but even in France; and tho' Calvin died soon after the per∣secution commenced in France, the Helvetic body strengthened that party, by a new confession of faith. The Calvinist religion prevailed among the Hessians, and in the south of Franconia, the six Protestant can∣tons in Switzerland and their allies. Calvinism is also
<PB N="142" REF="153"/>the religion of the reformed in France, the established religion in the United Provinces, where all religions are tolerated; but the Presbyterians only are admitted into any employment under the government. (Calvin∣ism was introduced into Scotland by Knox, in the reign of Queen Mary; whose son, James VI. establish∣ed Episcopacy, which continued till 1668, when Episcopacy was abolished, and the Presbytery re-esta∣blished in that kingdom, without so much as a tolera∣tion for the members of the church of England, until the reign of Queen Anne.)</P>
<P>The King of Prussia, and his court, are Calvinists; tho' his subjects are, for the most part, Lutherans. The religion of this glorious Monarch is best known from his confession of faith; which he caused to be ad∣dressed to all the Protestant ministers in the diet of the empire at Ratisbon in 1744, as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. I do not believe in the ordinances of the Pope, nor even in the writings of Luther, Beza, or Calvin; but believe in the adorable Trinity, and I make his holy word the foundation of my faith, nor shall I ever believe any thing that clashes with it, even though an angel from heaven should reveal it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. I believe also that I shall be saved, together with all true Christians, by the blood of Christ, his suffer∣ing and dying for us.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. As I profess there is no salvation in any other name, I would not be stiled a Lutheran, a Calvinist, nor a Papist, but a Christian.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. With regard to eternal election, or predestina∣tion, this is my private opinion, that the merciful God hath called all men to salvation; and it is not for want of being called if they are not saved, but thro' their own wickedness and obstinacy in opposing divine grace, and by reason of their corrupt hearts, and their sins, that they are condemned through the just judge∣ment of God.</ITEM>
<PB N="143" REF="154"/>
<ITEM>V. As to good works, it is my opinion, that there must necessarily be good works where there is a true faith; for faith and good works can no more be sepa∣rated, than light from fire: nevertheless it is an error to believe, that man can merit heaven by good works, or that he can be saved but by true faith. How then can the merit of good works save us?</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. With-regard to baptism and the Lord's supper, it is my opinion, that I have been washed from sin in baptism; not by the water, but by the blood of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and have been by it received into the eternal covenant of grace with God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost: so I am nourished in the holy supper at the table of the grace of Jesus Christ; and, in virtue of this sacrament, am rendered partaker of all the benefits which my Saviour hath purchased by his wounds and death, and am be∣come an inheritor of life everlasting; whence I believe, that whoso believed in God, and seeketh his salvation in the blood of Jesus Christ, and leadeth a true Chris∣tian life, may die the death of the righteous, and shall be saved.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. I leave to every one liberty of faith and con∣science; protesting, before the face of God, that I am determined to live and die in this plain confession of faith: nevertheless, I leave to all good people to judge, whether I am cold, hot or lukewarm. I am very far from believing, that the service of Catholic priests promote the salvation of souls; have learned by the experience which I have had, that all their actions tend not to the honour of God, and the salvation of men, but solely to their own honour, and to be respected among men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. It is with reason that I scruple to be called a Papist, a Lutheran, or a Calvinist; because, accord∣ing to the custom and opinion of the world, it is not sufficient to take the name of a Christian, but we must be engaged to some particular church, and make pro∣fession
<PB N="144" REF="155"/>of its faith; and as the pure reformed religion best agrees with my religion, I think it not improper to call myself a Reformed; although I see no cause to say, there is the least difference between my confession of faith and the pure Lutheran religion: I would not, however, be called a Calvinist; but am, and shall always be, a reformed Christian: that is to say, one that is disengaged from all error in the doctrine of faith, and who believes all that I have before mention∣ed; but a Calvinist is one, who makes the doctrine of Calvin the rule of his faith.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. As Calvin was a man, he might be mistaken, since no man is perfect: but I regard Calvin, Luther, and others, as chosen instruments of God, drawn by virtue of the Holy Ghost from the darkness of Popery, and that they shewed the true way to life; but as they were fallible, I do not call them rabbies. I profess, not to believe any doctrine that is not agreeable to the word of God; believing that it is my duty, as St. Paul advises, to try all things, and hold fast that which is good.</ITEM>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> PHILIP MELANCTHON.</HEAD>
<P>Philip Melancthon was born in the year 1497, at Bretten, in the palatinate of the Rhine. He gave very early marks of his great capacity, and was justly esteemed an illustrious youth. After passing through several branches of literature, in 1518, he accepted the Greek professorship in the university of Whiten∣burgh; but we find him principally remarkable, at this period, for his assiduity in promoting truth, in opposition to prevailing error, notwithstanding the ob∣structions he met with from those of the Romish reli∣gion: for having had an acquaintance with Luther, he zealously joined with him in opposing the errors and superstitious practices of the Romish church. We find him likewise a cotemporary of Erasmus, and that
<PB N="145" REF="156"/>there was a very great friendship subsisted betwixt them; yet, from his natural frankness of temper, he censured his paraphrases: but so universally was he ad∣mired for his learning and integrity, that we find Car∣dinal Bembus shewed himself very solicitous to serve him, and offered, if that would have influenced him to continue a Papist, to obtain preferment for him in the church; but Melancthon declined it, and continu∣ed the advocate for Protestantism, and, as far as in him lay, the promoter of peace. In 1541 he assisted at the conferences of Spires and Ratisbon, where the controversies between the Romanists and Protestants were warmly disputed. At the former, the Papists chose Eckius, and the Protestants appointed Melanc∣thon, to confer about the points in controversy, and agreed that they should discourse about original sin. They entered upon it, and continued the conference three days; when Nicholas Granville, who was then prime minister to the Emperor, and his commissioner at the conference, received a letter from his Imperial Majesty, which ordered, that the conference should be discontinued, and all things referred to the diet of Ratisbon, where the Protestants were ordered to meet. This diet was opened in March, in the presence of the Emperor, who appointed Eckius, Pslugius, and Grop∣per, to manage it for the Romanists; and for the Protestants, Melancthon, Bucer, and Pistorius. He commanded them to lay aside all passion, and to re∣spect the glory of God only in that conference. Fre∣deric, the Elector palatine, was appointed president, who opened the conference on the 27th of April, when a writing was produced, which contained twenty-two articles, wherein the whole substance of religion was comprised. It was imagined, that this writing was drawn up by John Gropper; but the Emperor said, it was presented to him by persons of learning and piety, to forward the peace: he therefore desired them to examine it, that they might approve of what was
<PB N="146" REF="157"/>well, correct what was amiss, and terminate all diffe∣rences.</P>
<P>In 1543, Melancthon went to the Elector of Co∣logne, to assist him in introducing a reformation into his diocese, and drew up sundry articles to present to the Elector, in which Bucer and Pistorius assisted. This attempt engaged the Elector to renounce Popery, and to promote, as far as in him lay, a reformation in his electorate; but such was the jealousy, the policy, and diligence of the Romish priests, that it had very little success with the common people, and he continued his studies, as professor of divinity, in the university of Wittingburgh, where he died the 19th of April, 1560<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rolt's History of the Reformers, p. 98.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Herman, Archbishop of Cologne, sent for Melanc∣thon and Bucer, with a design to reform his diocese; which was attended with no small success, till perse∣cution commenced on that account.</P>
<P>The council of Trent was, at this time, convened, and in their second session entered upon the two grand points to be settled therein, viz. matters of faith, and a reformation. Cardinal Poole proposed, that since in all ancient councils, some symbol of faith was pub∣lished, the like should be done in this; but concerning this symbol of faith there was some difficulty, since to recite the old would not convince the Lutherans, in∣sinuating, that they believed it as well as the Catho∣lics, but would not profess it, and urging, that this would imply they durst not handle the controverted points; it was resolved by a majority, that a new form, or creed, should be proposed. In the next session this new creed was barely recited; the court of Rome, understanding what had passed, and being alarmed at the name of reformation, as knowing not how far it might extend, used their interest to oppose
<PB N="147" REF="158"/>it. The Protestants, about this time, appointed a diet, and conference of divines at Ratisbon; at which the point of justification was very early brought upon the carpet, and divers other matters in religion, in which the members could not agree. The Duke of Saxe recalled his divines, and Martin Bucer returned to the Landgrave of Hesse, apprehending that the Emperor's intention was to amuse them with confe∣rences, while himself prepared for war; which, whe∣ther it had existed in his intention, was not fully known; but not long afterwards, expressing his dislike at that diet breaking up, he made preparations for war, which soon became known to the Protestants, so that they likewise armed themselves for defence. King Henry now made propo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als to them, for entering into a solemn league with them, and for concerting such measures with them, as should restore a much greater amity amongst them, and strengthen their hands against their enemies. But the Germans, who knew at what distance the King lived, and having a suspicion of some secret and sinister views, did not much regard the pro∣posals made to them, but trusted to themselves; and our King made peace with the French. The Emperor, at this time, making use of sundry artifices to conceal his intention of suppresling a reformation, and to cast the blame of this war on the Protestants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An abstract of a large account in L. Herbert, p. 613, 614, &amp; seq.</NOTE>; but the Protestants were upon their guard, and exhorted one another to stand firm.</P>
<P>The Cardinal of Trent, at this time, absolutely con∣cluded a league with the Pope and the Emperor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sleidem, lib. vii. L. Herbert, p. 622.</NOTE>. Both sides prepared for war: the Emperor pretending, that for civil causes, acts of disaffection and rebellion, he took up arms against them; and they denying the allegations, professed their designs were solely the sup∣port
<PB N="148" REF="159"/>of their liberty in religion. The Duke of Saxe and Landgrave of Hesse, who commanded the Pro∣testant army, composed of 70,000 foot, and 10,000 horse, sent a kind of defiance to the Emperor. The Emperor, hearing that our King treated with the Pro∣testants, expostulated the matter with him; which his Majesty denied, or that he intended any aid to the Protestants: saying, yet if he sought friendship abroad, he was not to be blamed, since the Emperor, in his new treaty with the Bishop of Rome, had agreed to fall on all those who rejected the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome. In October this same year an en∣gagement happened, in which the Imperialists had the advantage, and the two commanders, the Duke of Saxe and the Landgrave of Hesse, being obliged to return home, for the security of their own provinces, Denawart, and some other towns in Germany, were obliged to submit upon very hard terms. The Pope, upon hearing of what had passed, began to be solicitous for his own interest, and urged, that he had not been properly consulted; that he was not made a partaker in the treaty betwixt the Emperor and some of the Princes in Germany; and that it was much to the prejudice of the Catholic faith in tolerating heresy, which ought absolutely to be exterminated Besides that, he ought to have partook of the profits and spoils of the war; and for farther testimony of his displeasure raised a faction in Genoa against the Dorias, not fear∣ing their being able to undertake any thing against him. In the mean time the council of Trent proceeded to settle, as well as they could, matters of religion: but this did not divert the Emperor from the prosecution of his intended war; and the Protestants were, as far as in their power, careful for their defence. They even sent ambassadors to England and France for suc∣cour, but were refused by both the Kings.</P>
<P>The Emperor appointed a diet of the empire to meet in the end of July, the design of which was to
<PB N="149" REF="160"/>extinguish the light of the gospel, or check the pro∣gress of the reformation; but St. Peter had taught the reformed Christians, that it was better to obey God rather than man, and therefore they were resolved to put all things upon the hazard, rather than to make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, so that great tumults were raised in Strasbourg, and divers other towns. A severe edict was also published in Flanders against all that favoured the new doctrines, as they are called; but this was suppressed, at the intercession of the city of Antwerp, who had represented, that the ruin and loss of their trade from the English was in some measure, and would inevitably be the effect of it.</P>
<P>The famous Osiander having been obliged, from the troubles of those times, to leave his church at Nu∣remberg, fled into the kingdom of Prussia, that was one of the provinces to Brandenburgh, the most affec∣tionate to the reformation by Luther; it belonged to the Teutonic order, but the Prince Albert of Bran∣denburgh, who was the Grand Master thereof, con∣ceived all at once a desire of marrying and reforming, and making himself a sovereign there: and by the care and diligence of this Protestant doctor of Nuremberg, Lutheranism became established, and peace and good order were preserved in the province.</P>
<P>A. D. 1550, a very severe placart was published at Brussels against heresy, which gave unquestionable proof of a design to set on foot the tribunal of the in∣quisition.</P>
<P>The inquisition was now become the tribunal of the Dominican monks, who not only punished,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Inquisition described.</NOTE> with the most infamous, as well as dreadful deaths, and loss of estates, all crimes of which a person was fully convicted, but invented the vilest stratagems to ensnare people, to fathom their souls, and extort the deepest secrets of their hearts, by such threats as were intolerable to be seen or heard, and by such torments as were not to be endured. They have
<PB N="150" REF="161"/>two officers, one of them intitled, <HI>The Promoter of the rights of the Church,</HI> who insists upon the sentence of heresy against the accused person. The other, in the King's name, insists on the forfeiture of the criminal's estate. Whoever hears any criminal heretical expres∣sion is bound to discover it, though it should drop from the mouth of his own father. Two witnesses, tho' of different facts, are sufficient to cast the accused person into a loathsome dungeon, where he is hardly allowed any food or refreshment, and is denied all visits or methods of consolation. In case he owns what he is accused of, and abjures his religion, the penance he is to undergo, is to wear the <HI>Sacco Benito,</HI> and to forfeit all bi estate. If he persevere in denying the accusation, and affirms that he is a pure Romish Christian, they notwithstanding condemn him to be burnt, upon two persons swearing, tho' they differ in some material circumstances The names of the wit∣nesses are concealed, if he guess at them, in case his exceptions are over-ruled; or if there are more wit∣nesses that he cannot guess at them, their evidence re∣mains good. Those who are condemned by the spiritual court, are delivered up to the secular arm to be punished. Grotius says, that it was enough to send any one to prison if he were but suspected of heresy; and that any proof, even of the smallest moment, was sufficient to bring him to the rack<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grot. Annal. lib. i. p. 10. Lemborch's History of the In∣quisition, translated by Dr. Chandle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. He adds, that the Inquisitors had a power of sending for any persons, of what state or condition soever, and of asking them what questions they pleased upon oath; by which means they often penetrated into the secrets of families, and even of conscience; for the more any man dread∣ed perjury, the more readily he betrayed himself: be∣sides, that those who scrupled to kneel before the images of the saints, or the host, when elevated in the church, or carried openly in procession, could hardly avoid being discovered.</P>
<PB N="151" REF="162"/>
<P>At the first, this kind of inquisition was principally used against the Jews and the Moors, but is now prac∣tised against all persons accused of heresy whatsover, and all sorts of tricks made use of to detect people. A man's silence is frequently construed into guilt, and renders him as obnoxious to punishment as plain words: no friendship can be relied on, and a man's accuser was oftimes his bosom friend; insomuch, that it was now plain, that the life, fortune and honour of the most innocent person, were at the mercy of the greatest villains.</P>
<P>That these things are not magnified out of hatred, but related with a most strict regard to truth, cannot be denied, by such as have heard what disturbances have been excited in Spain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Mart. f. 476.</NOTE>, and throughout all Italy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. ii. p. 135.

<P>It was no wonder then if the people of Antwerp, which flourished above all towns in the Low Countries in its commerce (a blessing which commonly attends liberty of conscience) did from this time begin most strenuously to oppose this religious tyranny. The re∣formation was therefore privately preached up, and some of the ministers, who were publickly to read the placart for prohibiting heresy, even dared to omit it: among these were George Sylvanus and Gasper Ven¦der Heiden. This attempt to establish an inquisition, through the rigour of that placart, was taken into general consideration, and application was made to Queen Mary, to apply to her brother the Emperor of Germany, to obtain some mitigation thereof. But
<PB N="152" REF="163"/>though this was obtained in some measure by an alte∣ration of the manner of expression in the new placart published, the main and principal intention was so much the same, that it gave very little satisfaction to the more judicious and penetrating, and they were very doubtful of the consequences that would follow. But</P>
<P>The progress of the persecution in 1551, confirmed them in their sentiments more immediately against the sect of the Anabaptists; and thus it continued with little intermission for three years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's History of the Reformation, vol. i. b. iii. p. 92.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Two confessions of faith were drawn up about this time, viz. that of Saxony, and that of Wittem∣burg: this is not Wittemburg in Saxony, but the capital of the duchy Wittemburg. These were both compiled in order that they might be presented to the council of Trent, where Charles V. called the Victo∣rious, pretended that the Protestants ought to be ad∣mitted, and due regard had to their complaints. The Saxon confession was composed by Melancthon; and we are informed by Sleiden, that it was by the order of the Elector Maurice, whom the Emperor had sub∣stituted in the room of Giovan Frederic. This met with the approbation of the doctors and pastors at Leipsic, and it was likewise received in many of the principal cities in Saxony by that court, and by several other Princes, as well as by the churches of Pomera∣nia and Strasbourg. Bientius was the compiler of the confession of Wittemburg, who was the next to Me∣lancthon, the most illustrious of all the Protestant party<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bossuet, b. viii. p. 467.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1554.] A solemn agreement was concluded between the Protestants of Geneva, and those of Zu∣rich, managed by Calvin, who explains therein the faith and discipline of those two churches.

<P>About the year 1558, the Lutherans, Zuinglians and Bohemians, convened in a synod at Sandomir, and passed an act entitled the Union, and mutual agreement, concluded between the churches of Poland, viz. those of the confession of Augsburg, and those of the confession of the brothers of Bohemia, and those of the confession of the Helvetic churches or Zuinglians<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. b. xi.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among the Polish Protestants, some of them, says Bossuet, were for the figurative sense, with respect to the eucharist, agreeable to the profession of faith by the Switzers, which they had subscribed in the year 1555. But for the better explaining their sentiments in this point, they drew up a fresh one in the year 1559, in a synod held at Crenger (which we meet with in the collection of Geneva.)—In that very year, the Polish Protestants formed upon the Zuinglian confession of faith, joined with those formed upon the Lutheran profession, and the Vaudois united with them, and altogether assembled at Sandomir, where they subscribed to the sense in which they conceived the presence of Christ in the Bene: this is else∣where called the Saxonic confession<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. lib. z.</NOTE>.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> THEODORE BEZA.</HEAD>
<P>Theodore Beza, minister of Geneva, and one of the chief pillars of the reformed church, was born the 24th of June 1519, at Vezelay, a city of Burgundy, in
<PB N="154" REF="165"/>France. He went to Orleans to study under Melchior Wolmar, a German, and professor of the Greek tongue, with whom he resided seven years, and by whom he was instructed in the Protestant religion. Beza went frequently to Geneva to visit Calvin, and shewed him some of his poetical productions. Calvin was delighted with his poetry, but exhorted him to dedicate his ta∣lents to the service of the church, which he in some measure complied with. He wrote a tract on the equality of the pastors; he translated many of the psalms of David; he likewise wrote a Latin transla∣tion of the New Testament, being made professor of Greek at Lausanne, where he taught classics for ten years. Beza then returned to Geneva, where he suc∣ceeded Calvin in 1564, and wrote an apology for his Latin translation of the New Testament, and published the treatise of the sacrament, and some sermons on the passions of Christ The religious war breaking out in France, Beza returned to that kingdom in 1571, to assist at the national synod of Rochelle, of which he was elected moderator: for the peace was broke through, by the massacre at Paris the same year, which was called the massacre of St Bartholomew, in which above thirty thousand Protestants were murdered; and the King of Navarre, with the Prince of Conde, the only two persons saved, were compelled to abjure the reformed religion. This horrid business, commonly called the wedding of Paris, has been scandalously represented, by Gabriel Nawde, as a master-piece in policy. But all the Europeans looked upon this action with the utmost abhorrence, saying, that, in the ac∣counts of the most barbarous nations, there was never an example of such horrid cruelty. The Huguenots, recommenced the war with great animosity; and Beza, in 1572, assisted at the synod of Nismes, where he opposed the faction of John Morel, who designed to introduce a new discipline. The royal army besieged Ro∣chelle, which was so gallantly defended by the Protes∣tants,
<PB N="155" REF="166"/>that peace was granted them in 1573. The fifth civil war began the next year, when Charles IX. died, and was succeeded by his brother Henry III. The Prince of Conde at that time sent for Beza to Strasburg, that he might carry on a negociation with Prince John Casimir, administrator of the Palatinate; which shews it was well known, that Beza understood other things besides lectures and books. He suc∣ceeded so well, that Casimir brought an army from Germany to assist the Huguenots, who obtained a peace upon more advantageous terms than any of the former. Beza returned to Geneva, where James Ar∣minius was sent in 1582, to perfect his studies, at the expence of the magistrates of Amsterdam, and chiefly followed the lectures of Beza, who at that time ex∣pounded the epistle to the Romans. Arminius was afterwards professor of divinity at Leyden, and formed a separate sect, which was condemned in a national synod; for he opposed Beza, as a Supralapsarian, and acknowledged no other election, but that which was grounded on the obedience of sinners, to the call of God by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Beza however persisted in the doctrines of Calvin, and was a very great instrument in conducting the re∣formation, according to the tenets he had espoused; but his piece in defence of persecution was a blemish to his character. He died on the 13th of October 1605, aged 86<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Hist. of the Synod of Dort.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Persecution continued nevertheless greatly to prevail through all the Low Countries, for more than twenty-years: but even at Utrecht, where much persecution had been practised, the reformation made a consider∣ble progress about the year 1566; and the Protes∣tants in Flanders began to hold their meetings more openly in several provinces, and their ministers settled in some of the principal towns and cities. The Prince of Orange, as governor of Antwerp, makes an agree∣ment
<PB N="156" REF="167"/>with the Protestants of that city, with respect to the public exercise of religion. They build churches there for that purpose: the ministers take an oath of fidelity to their government: but there arose a diffe∣rence between the Lutherans and Calvinists concern∣ing the sacrament; and they were tolerated in receiv∣ing the Lord's supper, according to the different ap∣prehensions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Blandt's Hist. of the Reformation, vol. i. p. 266. Bevervick's Description of Dort, p. 347.</NOTE>. But this pleasing prospect did not last long, there was a general persecution commenced again in 1567, at Armentiers, Courtray and Antwerp. The sentence of the Spanish inquisitors was published against the Netherlands, and the decree of the council of Trent imposed on the clergy of Utrecht.</P>
<P>About this time, abundance of books and pamphlets were published against the Spanish cruelty and viola∣tion of conscience, and were dispersed all over the nation, to which Alva opposed a severe placart.</P>
<P>The Prince of Orange declares war, publishes a manifesto, dated August 31, 1568, but was not a match for Alva's numerous army, and was obliged to retire to Germany, and there disbanded this forces.</P>
<P>A. D. 1569.] Pope Pius V. upon this triumphs greatly, and sends Alva the hat and sword, which was usually consecrated at Christmas, and afterwards presented to some or other of the Christian Princes.</P>
<P>Soon after this there followed a dreadful persecution at Valienciennes.</P>
<P>On the 4th of May this year, the town of Ter Veer, in Zealand, declared for the Prince of Orange against Alva; and several other cities followed their example, and the Prince promoted a general toleration, at least gave protection to the Romanists in the exercise of their religion, as well as liberty of conscience to those of other persuasions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brandt's Hist. of the Reformation, p. 296.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="157" REF="168"/>
<P>A. D. 1573.] In process of time the reformed reli∣gion, according to the practice of the church of Geneva, was introduced among the Hollanders, who gave the greatest liberty of conscience, being of opinion, not only that religion ought to be tolerated, but that all restraints in matters of religion was as detestable as the inquisition itself: and accordingly they maintained that nobody erred wilfully, or could believe against his conscience; that none but God could inspire right notions into the minds of men; that no religion was agree∣able to God, but what proceeded from a willing heart. Experience had also taught them, that heterodox opinions could not so effectually be rooted out by hu∣man power or violence, as by length of time. The rest of the sects that endeavoured to promote the reforma∣tion, according to their own sentiments, and among them those of the confession of Augsburg, or the Lu∣therans, and all the kinds of Anabaptists, had likewise their share of liberty of conscience: but at Woerden the public church was granted to the Lutherans. The doctrine of predestination according to Calvin's opi∣nion was greatly opposed at Horn, at Embden, and other places, and these sectaries much increased<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's Hist. vol. i. p. 308. Grot. Apol. cap. iii. p. 31.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This year there was a great persecution of the Anabaptists at Antwerp and Brussels. Soon after, many of this sect retired to London, as a place of safety, and an asylum from persecution; but this was in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. They were scarce settled in England, but they were obliged to fly to Holland, on account of many kinds of oppression and unreasonable impositions set on foot against them. The ministers of the Dutch and French churches, in London, interposed their endeavours to bring the re∣maining part of the baptists, and, together with the then Bishop of London, pressed them very hard, to sign these four articles.

<ITEM>II. To acknowledge that young children ought to be baptised.</ITEM>

<ITEM>IV. That a Christian may take an oath.—But these articles they rejected, and gave their reasons in writing, and petitioned the Queen for the indulgence of Chris∣tian liberty: but so prepossessed and prejudiced was her Majesty against them, that she refused to receive their petition. Nay, so far was she prevailed on to fa∣vour their persecution, that, amongst other positions published by her Majesty's directions, one was, "that a Christian government may punish heretics with death:" and accordingly two of the Anabaptists from the Low Countries were executed at Smithfield<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's History, vol. i. p. 315.</NOTE>.</ITEM>

<P>A. D. 1577.] There was a synod at Frankfort, where the ambassadors of Queen Elizabeth, with the depu∣ties of France, Poland, Hungary, and of the Low Countries, attended, which was procured by Count Pa∣latine Giovan Casimir and others. The design of which assembly was to compose one general confession of faith, in which those churches might unite and de∣clare their assent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bossuet, vol. ii. b. xii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This account is given by Bossuet, which in many respects don't correspond with the history of the esta∣blishment of the English Protestant churches at Frank∣fort: for before the reign of Queen Mary 1553, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many of the English Protestants, and Scotch likewise, fled from the persecutions at home, and fixed them∣selves at Frankfort, the famous Knox, and some others who joined him, established some churches is Frankfort, and became their respective ministers. There appears to be a very great harmony and condescension among them, so far at least as appeared necessary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="159" REF="170"/>the good order and government of the church. But upon the accession of Queen Mary, new liturgies and form of divine service were sent over to them, and im∣posed under severe penalties; requiring their admission of the said form, as they would receive any marks of their protection in case of their return to their native country. This occasioned a general consternation a∣mongst many of the churches, and a dispersion of some of them; but Providence happily changed the scene by the accession of Queen Elizabeth to the throne, which spread joy and comfort in the churches of Frank∣fort, and their numbers greatly increased, and they then attempted to harmonize as to sentiment, of which the history of that state furnishes us with many parti∣culars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The History of the Protestant churches in Frankfort, printed in 1575.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>January 1, 1577, the town of Muyden declared for the Prince of Orange, but upon this express condition, that they should from thenceforward enjoy the free exercise of the Romish religion, but without disturbing or offering violence to the conscience of others. Wesep, Harlim, &amp;c. likewise came in upon the same footing.</P>
<P>But the fire of persecution was soon after kindled at Antwerp, and several were executed, viz. Hans de Ruiter, a preacher, and his wife and daughter. The Anabaptist sect began likewise to be ill treated by the reformed, and their refusing to take an oath as burghers of Middleburg was made a handle of to exclude them from the privileges of the city, and, if possible, expel them from it.</P>
<P>But the Prince granted protection to the Anabaptists of Middleburg, inasmuch as, without taking the oaths, they for many years supported all civil burthens, con∣tributions, and raxes, equally with other citizens and inhabitants of the said place, and were never wanting
<PB N="160" REF="171"/>therein, or in any other circumstance of their duty, re∣specting the community<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this grant at large in Brandt's History.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, some of the clergy did all that lay in their power to exasperate the Prince against them, which occasioned a conference between the Prince and the Heer Van Aldegende, concerning the Anabaptists, which terminated greatly in their favour.</P>
<P>Difference of sentiment on some points created no small disputes amongst themselves. The Flemish Ana∣baptists, and those at Embden, differed upon the points of excommunication, and the separation of a man from his wife. Some disputes likewise arose between the Fries∣land and the German Anabaptists, upon the point of justification; but that terminated in mutual agreement the very next year.</P>
<P>The reformed religion was first introduced at Am∣sterdam, and a religious peace was very much pro∣moted by the representations of the Prince of Orange, and many others of Catholic charitable dispositions; and when the union of Utrecht was made public, a further order was given relative to religion, in which the religious peace is again published, with such ex∣planation as tended to recommend and inforce it.</P>
<P>The reformed of Luther's party had a book of con∣cord; but this was very much objected to by some other protestants, who thought it too great a restraint of Christian liberty: but this dispute the Prince of Orange in great measure conciliated.</P>
<P>In 1580, the King of Spain, at the instance of the Bishop of Ruremond, founded two universities, viz. at Louvain and Douay, for educating pastors and teachers for the propagation of the Romish religion, and to oppose the Protestants.</P>
<P>A. D. 1581.] About this time a ban was published in the King's name against the Prince of Orange, set∣ting a reward of 25,000 gold crowns upon his head;
<PB N="161" REF="172"/>against which the Prince prepared an apology, and laid it before the States General, by whom it was ap∣proved, and afterwards printed. The purport of which was, that the protection or indulgence of Papists was as great in the Low Countries as was consistent with the peace and the happiness of the subjects in ge∣neral, or with what was right and fit upon the whole; and in process of time, this proved a means of the pro∣hibition of the Popish religion in Holland and Harlem: but as some of them petitioned, and some of the ma∣gistrates of Harlem favoured a general liberty, they were again indulged.</P>
<P>A. D. 1582.] In Holland, after various consulta∣tions and treaties with the Prince of Orange, matters were so disposed, that they were ready to receive him, and do him homage, as Count of that province, upon this condition among others, That he should maintain and defend the true reformed religion, and that a new regular plan of government should be established, &amp;c. But before this grand design could be executed, the Prince was shot by an assassin, on the 10th of July; his dying words were, "O my God! be gracious to me and this poor nation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brandt's History of the Reformation, vol. i. p. 396.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>A. D. 1584] This period is remarkable, especially in the history of the States of Holland, when they were so weakened by repeated losses and misfortunes, that they exposed themselves, and their religious as well as civil liberties, to very great hazard, by offering the sovereignty of their country to Henry III. King of France; on condition, however, among other things, to secure, in some measure, their religion, that neither he nor his ministers should make any alterations in religion, nor examine into any man's conscience: but the King rejected that offer, by reason of the artifices of the Spaniards. In the next place, the States offered themselves to Queen Elizabeth, and obtained assistance from her.</P>
<PB N="162" REF="173"/>
<P>In 1588, Prince Maurice summoned several mini∣sters to the Hague, to have their opinion upon the article which the Queen of England was to propose in the treaty with King Philip of Spain, relating to reli∣gion; when they concluded not to be content with the bare liberty of conscience, exclusive of the present public exercise of religious worship; and the minister of Zealand in particular insisted upon a prohibition of all other religions: and we find in the result, they were per∣mitted and directed to unite and agree in one form of church-government, according to the reformation of St. James, &amp;c. similar to it; and this was effected about the 12th day of November 1590.</P>
<P>"That baptism should be administered according to our Lord's institution, without laying any burthen upon the witnesses, only exhorting parents to do their duty.</P>
<P>"That the Lord's supper should be taught, ad∣ministered, and distributed, according to the form of God's word, and the ordinances of reading and sing∣ing practised in the church; and that this should be done according to St. Paul's direction, let a man ex∣amine himself, without any other enquiry into the con∣sciences of men.</P>
<P>"That the consistory might, and should examine any that led disorderly lives, to admonish and reform them; and that if any continued obstinately irreclaima∣ble, they were not to permit their receiving the Lord's supper; but that there should be no act of excommu∣nication, or anathematizing."</P>
<P>The same year the states of Utrecht chose Prince Maurice their Stadtholder; upon condition, that his ex∣cellency should maintain and defend the true Christian and Evangelical religion: and was afterwards elected in other provinces on the same condition.</P>
<P>There was likewise a synod of South Hollanders held at Dort: in this synod it was particularly agreed to exercise great moderation with respect to the point
<PB N="163" REF="174"/>of predestination; and this terminated in a greater mo∣deration, even with respect to Papists themselves, in∣somuch that they obtained a church at Breda.</P>
<P>In 1592, the States of Holland being sensible of the want of learned men to guard against the encroach∣ments or prevalence of Romish error, instituted a se∣minary or nursery of students at Leyden, who were to be instructed and educated in the science of divinity, at the charge of the government.</P>
<P>The same year, Guellius Snecanus, minister in Fries∣land, published a book, in which he treated of predestina∣tion agreeable to the opinion of Melancthon, maintain∣ing that the doctrine of a conditional predestination was consistent with the word of God. This was afterwards opposed by Beza, and by many others, with great warmth. However, persecution gave it the greatest check, and many hazarded their lives for denying pre∣destination according to Calvin, and adhering rather to the moderate exposition and sentiments of Bullinger.</P>
<P>In 1595, the Romanists had now got to too great a height, both of power and influence, insomuch that it was found necessary by the States of Holland to pub∣lish a placart against them.</P>
<P>The States took a more wife and effectual method for promoting a reformation at this time, by a new translation of the holy scriptures, under the care of Heer Van Aldegende, who had shewn wherein the translation by Luther was indeed erroneous and false.</P>
<P>About the year 1598, there were wasted over from England a new set of people, called Brownists, who were for reforming the reformation. The chief reasons of their separation may be seen in ten articles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's History, vol. i. p. 479.</NOTE>, (see Puritans) viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the congregations never united or met to∣gether, rather acting as independent churches.</ITEM>
<PB N="164" REF="175"/>
<ITEM>II. Because they receive and admit as members the seed of those who are not members of any visible <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hurch.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Reading their public prayers out of a book.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Because they do not observe the commands of Christ, Matt. xviii. 15, 16, 17.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. Because they serve God daily in the temples of Antichrist.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. Because their ministers are supported by sub∣scription.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. Because they change their elders yearly.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. Because they confirm marriage in the church, as if it were part of the ecclesiastical ministry; whereas it is only pertaining to the civil government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. Because they made use of suspension, which Christ never required.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. Because they observe days and times, keeping holy certain days, on account of the nativity, resurrec∣tion, and ascension of Christ, which he never com∣manded.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These articles were printed this same year, in justifi∣cation of their non-conformity, with such texts of scrip∣ture as they deemed sufficient vindication of their re∣spective tenets, in points wherein they principally dif∣fered from others of the reformed churches.</P>
<P>Thus ended this century, at which time the churches of the Provinces still found themselves very far from the end they had proposed in casting off the yoke of the Romish papacy; for we were not only obliged to strug∣gle with the remaining Papists, who were careful to try all artifices to preserve their old adherents, and to allure to themselves new followers, but we were like∣wise involved in mutual disputes with different sects, each of which taking contrary paths, and making no advances towards harmony, nor uniting with each other. They foresaw the consequences, and endeavoured to ac∣commodate matters as well as they could; but little, very little, was done this way by collective bodies. A
<PB N="165" REF="176"/>torrent of zeal and animosity seemed to prevail, and those in power pressed upon Christians, with great warmth and earnestness, whatever they pleased to call necessary articles of faith; so that we may justly wish for better days, when mankind, as brethren and relations, may be united in the bands of sincere love and truth, to see their own salvation, and that of others: to which let every Christian say with heart and voice, <HI>Amen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abstract from Gerard Brandt, vol. i. p. 481.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The sixteenth century began with some instances of the great moment the states of the United Provinces thought liberty in religion, whilst they endeavoured by their interposition and recommendation to divert the magistrates of Cologne from persecuting the reformed, and to prevent, by their influence, the persecuting the Anabaptists at Frisian, to which the clergy had excited the magistracy. A synod was called at Harlem, to treat of what things might tend to a more general peace; but there were found some of turbulent dispo∣sitions; and whilst the business of translating the Bible was promoted by the Meer Van Aldegende, Arminius, and Vitenbogart, Beza's defence of persecution was translated and recommended by the Frisian divines<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Acts of the North Holland synod at Amsterdam, 1601.</NOTE>, and the spirit and practice of persecution, more especi∣ally against the Anabaptists, prevailed for some years.</P>
<P>In the year 1601 was that remarkable piece publish∣ed by Junius, professor of divinity at Leyden, called the <HI>Irenicon, or peaceable Christian,</HI> presented to the States, and highly commended by them.</P>
<P>In 1602, Arminius was called to the professorship at Leyden, tho' not without great opposition, on ac∣count of his opposing strenuously the doctrines of Cal∣vin and Beza, on the subject of predestination. Warm disputes now commenced between divers opponents on this point: first, or principally, between Arminius and Gomarus, in which the most celebrated fathers and
<PB N="166" REF="177"/>principal reformers are introduced, as differing on those controverted points. At length, a synod was held at Delft, in South Holland, and the arguments submitted to them. This controversy subsisted for seven years successively, without any apparent advan∣tage, which occasioned several persons of considerable note to interpose by their advice, to put a stop, as much as possible, to any farther disputes on the subject of predestination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's History of the Reformation, vol. ii. p. 43.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1603 a synod was held, in which the Protestants made a decree, for declaring the Pope of Rome An∣tichrist; because he assumed an absolute, and, they said, an oppressive pre-eminence and authority above all other churches and pastors, and called himself GOD.</P>
<P>Among other noble and learned personages, who used their endeavours for the prevention of disputes and restoring peace, was Philip Du Moulin, who, in a letter to Daniel Silenus, professor of divinity at Sedan, thus expresses himself: Would to God that all of us did but contain ourselves within the bounds of scripture, and not proceed any farther, to the end we might join our common strength against the Romish idolatry, superstition and tyranny; and, as to the rest, bear with each other, learn to treat men's doctrines with mode∣ration, and their persons with caution, provided that they on their part do act with piety.</P>
<P>The Lord of Plessis to the Heer Vander Myle thus writes: In general I maintain and advise, that where the fundamentals of salvation are not struck at, nor the outward worship defiled with idolatry or superstition, there is no cause of separation, even tho' people differ in points of some importance.</P>
<P>A. D. 1608.] Several Princes this year laboured to compose the differences of the reformed and Lutherans; but Arminius and Vitenbogart finding that the much<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bossuet, book xiii. vol. ii. p. 364.</NOTE>
<PB N="167" REF="178"/>stronger party espoused the doctrine of predestination, and they were more and more reproached for their different sentiments, found it necessary to wave the matter in dispute as far as consisted with a regard to truth and the support of their characters, seeking no public disputes, but submitting to such as the States for their greater satisfaction should call them to.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the reformed met with great difficul∣ties in provinces where Popery gained the ascendant, they were prohibited preaching. The States of Hol∣land published a decree in 1610, forbidding any person to write or publish any thing about the power of go∣vernors in church-matters, as also about predestina∣tion, and the points relating thereto.</P>
<P>However, this did not prove sufficient to suppress disputes on these subjects; and for near seven years the love of strife and confusion seemed to have diffused it∣self throughout the whole land. The remonstrants and contra-remonstrants, on every occasion, or at every opportunity, warmly contesting the points in dispute, representations was made of it in England; and it was in process of time judged necessary to convene a gene∣ral council or synod, which was held at Dort, and commenced the 13th of November 1618.</P>
<P>A. D. 1616.] In the mean time there were not want∣ing other subjects, which almost necessarily employed the pens of many learned and judicious persons; some in defence of liberty against the undue power assumed and exercised by the magistracy of the States of Hol∣land, who were for suppressing all writings and debates whatsoever, that called in question any part of their creed, and this too in the most arbitrary manner.</P>
<P>A. D. 1617.] In this interval the dispute arose, or rather revived, relative to the equality of the Son with the Father; which we shall no farther enter upon, than as an instance of the authority assumed by the States, in opposition even to that distinguishing tenet of Pro∣testants,
<PB N="168" REF="179"/>that the scriptures are a sufficient rule of faith and practice.</P>
<P>For in the remonstrance of Venator, presented to the States of Holland, he made this open profession: "I declare that the holy scripture does fully contain in itself all that is necessary to salvation, without the ad∣dition of human phrases, or unscriptural expressions; and that it is sufficient for a sincere Christian, in mat∣ters of faith, especially in the most abstruse or nice points, to explain his mind in the very words of the Bible; and, consequently, that no man ought to be censured as a heretic, who at the very first says all that the scriptures itself says of any thing, and afterwards says no more, nor in any other manner, nor wrests it to any other sense or purpose; and when I say in scrip∣ture phrase, that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Saviour, the only mediator between God and man, our prophet, high priest, and King, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation for sin, who is one with the Father, the brightness of his glory, and express image of his person; this ought to suffice." But notwithstandng this book was ordered to be suppressed, and he banished the jurisdiction of Delft.</P>
<P>The synod of Dort therefore convened on the 13th of November 1618, after much ceremony in fixing the credentials of the constituent members, observing a general fast, electing a president, &amp;c. The Eng∣lish translation of the Bible came under their considera∣tion and regulation; the exclusion of the apocryphal books; whether, in addressing God by prayer, the term <HI>thou</HI> or <HI>you</HI> was fittest to be made use of; debates a∣rose about the word Jehovah, whether it should be rendered Lord in the new translation; whether the Hebrew proper names should be retained, or that they should translate them; mention was likewise made of a new division of chapters and verses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's History of the Reformation, vol. iii. book xxxiii. p. 18 to 28.</NOTE>. They proceeded
<PB N="169" REF="180"/>next to the choice of supervisors of this new translation: but there arose a great difficulty in naming them; for the deputies of the province of Utrecht were equally divided, three remonstrants and three contra-remon∣strants: at length different supervisors were appointed for the Old and the New Testaments. These were the transactions of the first thirteen sessions.</P>
<P>A. D. 1618] At the 14th session of the synod of Dort, the Heidelberg catechism, which had been re∣ceived in these provinces, was appointed to be read and expounded in the afternoon service; and, at the opening the 25th session, the president made a very learned discourse, about the necessity of catechising, both for children and adults; urging, that it was the foun∣dation of religion, and the only way to instil the prin∣ciples of Christianity: an ancient practice among the patriarchs, the apostles, used by Origen, approved and recommended by the fathers; the neglect of which had occasioned the ignorance of the vulgar, as well as the many sects of Papists, Anabaptists, and other sec∣taries; and that it was now more necessary, from the industry of the Jesuits to propagate and establish the doctrines of the Romish church by the same method. The manner of doing it, according to the different ages, capacities, and improvements of different per∣sons, and agreeable to the sentiments of the divines that constituted this synod, was the business of the as∣sembly the remaining part of this session<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's History of the Reformation, vol. iii. b. xxxiii. p. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It would be almost endless to enumerate all the trans∣actions of this remarkable synod for 180 sessions; some of which appear as remarkably trifling as others are suitable and important. The 10th and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7th session were employed in new modelling the catechism; 18th and 19th, the baptism of the children of unbelievers de∣bated; 20th, whether students for the ministry should not be baptised before they were admitted; 20th to
<PB N="170" REF="181"/>24th, taken up in settling some punctilios, about right and precedence of some of the deputed members. &amp;c. 24th, the doctrine of predestination revived. Several succeeding sessions the remonstrants attempted their vindication with respect to the five principal points in dispute of predestination; the extent of the merits of Christ's death, conversion, saving faith, final perseve∣rance, grace of God, and wherein their zeal had been censured by the synod; and from the 30th to the 129th session, were spent in debates, pro and con. between the remonstrants, and contra-remonstrants, when the synod declared they had then agreed as to the funda∣mentals of religion, as appears from the conformity of our judgments, tho' it is hardly to be expected we should entirely agree in the manner of expressing things, and in that the canons were read. According to their de∣termination on the five fore-mentioned points, many subscribed of the foreign members, but others there were who refused it. Reasons are offered, petitions are presented, and a wide field is opened to furnish matter for a much longer continuance of the synod: nevertheless in process of time, after several other sessions, the articles of faith agreed to by the synod were read, and therein they condemn the doctrine of the remon∣strants, and passed a decree of censure on their persons, excluding them from the ministry, and from writing in favour of the doctrines they had espoused and pro∣pagated, which were not approved by the synod, and that none of them should be allowed to enjoy any place of profit, or to officiate in any of the public seminaries of learning. But this prohibition was only complied with in part, many regarding their call to the ministry as indispensible, and of consequence to promote the truth in spite of any opposition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt, vol. iii. book xli. p. 309.</NOTE>. This may suffice for an account of the synod of Dort; but it will not be unsuitable to add the judgment of Dr. Heylin, one of
<PB N="171" REF="182"/>the chaplains of King Charles I. concerning this synod.</P>
<P>This synod, says he, was much like that of Trent in the motives to it, as also in the managing and con∣duct of it; for as neither was assembled, till the sword was drawn, the terror thereof was able to effect more than all other arguments, so that neither was so much concerned to confute, as condemn their op∣posites. The council of Trent consisted for the most part of Italian Bishops; some others added for form sake, that it might the better challenge the name of general. That of Dort consisted, for the most part, of the delegates of the Belgic churches, to whom the foreign divines were found inconsiderable; the diffe∣rences were as great at Dort, as they were at Trent; and as much care was taken to soothe the contending parties. The British divines, with some of those from Bremen, maintained the universal redemption of man∣kind by the death of Christ; but this by no means could be granted by the rest of the synod, especially by those of North Holland, for fear of yielding any thing to the Arminians; as Soto in the council of Trent opposed some moderate opinions, teaching the certainty of salvation, because they were too much in favour of Lutheranism. In both, the weakest party was not admitted to a fair hearing; and in the latter, the name of an Arminian carried a condemnation in itself without any conviction.</P>
<P>A. D. 1620] Though it may be very justly main∣tioned as no small commendation of the synod of Dort, that they first declared in what high esteem they held the Christian religion, subjoining as their opinion, that the said religion consisted chiefly in practice, or in the observation of God's commands; and that they were the touchstone, by which all doctrinal points, and all controversies of religion, could be tried with the greatest certainty and advantage; that whatever tended in its own nature to enervate, or to invalidate
<PB N="172" REF="183"/>those commands, ought consequently to be looked upon as false. Whereas all other matters which were not contrary to them, might in their opinion be main∣tained on either side, provided it were done with charity and prudence, and that they wished for no∣thing more sincerely, than to see christianity free from the intricacies and subtilties which had too long ob∣scured its original excellency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's History of the Reformation, vol. iv. p. 108.</NOTE>. But, notwithstanding this, we find by the preceding censure, and several severe placarts that followed, that a far different spirit prevailed amongst them. Witness a severe placart published this same year against the remonstrants, and their cruel proceedings against de Prins, and Gre∣vius, two remonstrant ministers, which indeed proved too heavy for them to support under it</P>
<P>This has led many impartial historians to censure the general prevalency of persecuting principles among Protestants, of which there are too many evident proofs in their writings and conduct.</P>
<P>Dr. Chandler has remarked the conduct of Mr. Calvin, in the following manner:</P>
<P>John Calvin, to whom the Christian world is, on many accounts, under very great obligations, was however well known to be in principle and practice a persecutor. So entirely was he in the persecuting measures, that he wrote a treatise in defence of them, maintaining the lawfulness of putting heretics to death: and that by heretics, he meant such who differed from himself, is evident from his treatment of Castellio and Servetus.</P>
<P>The former, not inferior to Calvin himself in learn∣ing and piety, had the misfortune to differ from him in judgment, in the points of predestination, election, free-will, and faith. This Calvin could not bear, and therefore treated Castellio in so rude and cruel a man∣ner, that his warmest friends, I believe, will be ashamed
<PB N="173" REF="184"/>to justify. In some of his writings, he calls him <HI>blas∣phemer, reviler, malicious barking dog, full of ignorance, bestiality and impudence, impostor, a base corrupter of the sacred writings, a mocker of God, a contemner of all religion, an impudent fellow, a filthy dog, a knave, an impious, lewd, crooked-minded vagabond, beggarly rogue.</HI> At other times, he calls him <HI>a disciple and brother of</HI> Servetus, <HI>and an heretic.</HI> Castellio's reply, to all these flowers, is worthy the patience and moderation of a Christian, and from his slanders he appeals to the righteous judgment of God. But Calvin, not content with his former invectives, further accused him of three crimes, which Castellio particularly answers. The first was of theft, in taking away some wood, that belonged to another person, to make a fire to warm himself. This Calvin calls <HI>cursed gain, at another's expence and damage;</HI> whereas, in truth, the fact was this:—Castellio was thrown into such circumstances of po∣verty by the persecutions of Calvin and his friends, that he was scarce able to maintain himself; and as he dwelt near the banks of the Rhine, he used, at leisure hours, to draw out of the river, with an hook, the wood that was brought down by the waters. This wood was no private property, but every man's that could catch it. Castellio took it in the middle of the day, amongst a great number of fishermen, and se∣veral of his own acquaintance; and was sometimes paid money for it by the decree of the senate. This Calvin magnified into a theft, and published to the world, to point out the character of his Christian brother.</P>
<P>But his accusations ran farther yet; and he calls God to witness, that whilst he maintained Castellio in his house, he never saw any one more proud, or per∣fidious, or void of humanity; and that it was well known, he was an impostor of peculiar impudence, and one that took pleasure in scoffing at piety, and that he d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> gated himself in laughing at the principles of religion. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> answered in such
<PB N="174" REF="185"/>a manner, as was sufficient to silence malice itself; and Calvin, with two of his principal friends, eminent preachers in Savoy, pressed Castellio to take the charge of a school in Strasburg. Castellio, on that occasion, asked Calvin, with what conscience could you make me master, if you knew me to be such a person, when I dwelt in your house? What sort of men must they be, who would commit the education of children to such a wicked wretch as you appeal to God you knew me to be? However, Castellio accepted of the school, and having been master thereof three years, was deemed fit for the pastoral office; Calvin him∣self giving him such a testimonial, as falsified all he had said against him.</P>
<P>To this may be added the treatment of Jerom Bol∣sec, a Carmelite monk, who embraced the reformed religion, but differed from Calvin in the articles of free-will and predestination: and therefore by his means banished from Geneva, under the penalty of being whipped in case of his return.</P>
<P>Before the ministers of the reformed party were en∣gaged in the controversy with Arminius, their zeal was continually exerting itself against the Anabaptists, whom they declared to be excommunicated and cut off from the church, and endeavoured to convert by violence and force, prohibiting them from preaching under fines, and banishing them their country, upon account of their opinions. And the better to colour these proceedings, some of them wrote in defence of persecution; or which is the same thing, against the toleration of any religion or opinions different from their own; and for the better support of orthodoxy, they would have had the synods ordain, that all church-officers should renew their subscriptions to the confes∣sion and catechism every year, that hereby they might the better know who had changed their sentiments, and differed from the received faith. The practice was perfectly agreeable to the Geneva discipline;
<PB N="175" REF="186"/>Calvin himself, as hath been shewn, being in judg∣ment for persecuting hereticks; and Beza having wrote a treatise, A. D. 1600, to prove the lawfulness of punishing them. This book was translated from the Latin, into the Low Dutch language, by Boger∣man, afterwards president of the synod of Dort, and published with a dedication, and recommendation of it to the magistrates. The consequence of this was, that very severe placarts were published against the Anabaptists in Friesland and Groningen, where∣by they were forbidden to preach; and all persons prohibited from letting their houses and grounds to them, under the penalty of a large fine, or confine∣ment to bread and water for fourteen days. If they offended the third time, they were to be banished the city, and the jurisdiction thereof. Whosoever was discovered to rebaptise any person shall forfeit twenty dollars; and upon a second conviction be put to bread and water, and then be banished. Unbaptised chil∣dren were made incapable of inheriting; and if any married out of the reformed church, he was declared incapable of inheriting any estate, and the children made illegitimate.</P>
<P>But the controversy that made the greatest noise, and produced the most remarkable effects, was that carried on between the Calvinists and Arminians. Ja∣cobus Arminius, one of the professors of divinity at Leyden, disputing in his turn about the doctrine of predestination, advanced several things differing from the opinions of Calvin on this article, and was in a few months after warmly opposed by Gomarus his collegue, who held, "that it was appointed by an eternal decree of God, who amongst mankind shall be saved, and who shall be damned." This was indeed the sentiment of most of the clergy of the United Provinces, who therefore endeavoured to run down Arminius and his doctrine with the greatest zeal, in their private conversations, public disputes, and in
<PB N="176" REF="187"/>their very sermons to their congregations, charging him with innovations, and of being a follower of the antient heretical monk Pelagius; whereas the govern∣ment was more inclinable to Arminius's scheme, as being less intelligible by the people, and endeavoured all they could to prevent these differences of the clergy from breaking out into an open quarrel, to the dis∣turbance of the public peace. But the ministers of the predestinarian party would enter into no treaty for peace: the remonstrants were the objects of their fu∣rious zeal, whom they called Mamalukes, Devils, and Plagues, animating the magistrates to extirpate and destroy them, and crying out from the pulpits, "We must go through thick and thin, without fearing to stick in the mire: we know what Elijah did to Baal's priests." And when the time drew near for the elec∣tion of new magistrates, they prayed to God for such men, "as would be zealous even to blood, though it were to cost the whole trade of their cities." They also accused them of keeping up a correspondence with the Jesuits and Spaniards, and of a design to betray their country to them.</P>
<P>These proceedings gave great disturbance to the magistrates, especially as many of the clergy took great liberties with them, furiously inveighing against them in their sermons as enemies to the church, and perse∣cutors; as libertines and free-thinkers, who hated the sincere ministers of God, and endeavoured to turn them out of their office. This conduct, together with their obstinate refusal of all measures of accommoda∣tion, and peace with the remonstrants, so incensed the magistrates, that in several cities they suspended some of the warmest and most seditious of them, and pro∣hibited them from the public exercises of their minis∣terial function; particularly Gezelius of Roterdam, and afterwards Rosaeus, minister at the Hague, for endeavouring to make a schism in the church, and ex∣horting the people to break off communion with their
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>brethren. Being thus discarded, they assumed to themselves the name of the persecuted church, and met together in private houses, absolutely refusing all communion with the remonstrant ministers and party, in spite of all the attempts made use of to reconcile and unite them.</P>
<P>What the ministers of the contra-remonstrant party aimed at, was the holding a national council, which at length, after a long opposition, was agreed to in the assembly of the States General, who appointed Dort for the place of the meeting. Prince Maurice of Orange, the Stadtholder, effectually prepared matters for holding the said assembly; and as he declared himself openly for the contra-remonstrant party, not for that he was of their opinions in religion, being rather inclined to those of Arminius, but because he thought them the best friends to his family, he took care that the council should consist of such persons as were well affected to them. In order to this his ex∣cellency changed the government of most of the towns of Holland, deposed those magistrates who were of the remonstrant persuasion, or that favoured them in the business of toleration, and filled up their places with contra remonstrants, or such as promoted their interests, making use of the troops of the States to obviate all opposition. The consequence of this was the imprisonment of several great men of the re∣monstrant persuasion, such as the Advocate Olden∣barnevelt, Grotius, and others; and the suspension, or total deprivation of a considerable number of the re∣monstrant clergy, such as Vitenbogart of the Hague, Grovinckhovius of Roterdam, Grevius, and others, by particular synods met together for that purpose, and to prepare things, and appoint persons for the ensuing national one at Dort. The persons fixed on were ge∣nerally the most violent of the contra-remonstrant party, and who had publickly declared, that they would not enter into communion with those that differed from them, nor agree to any terms of moderation and

<PB N="178" REF="191"/>peace. There were also several foreign divines sum∣moned to this council, who were most of them in the Calvinistic scheme, and professed enemies to the Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nians. The lay commissioners also, who were chosen by the States, were most of them very partial contra-remonstrants, and two or three of them, who seemed more impartial than the others, were hardly suffered to speak; and if they did, were presently sus∣pected, and represented by letters sent to the States, and Prince Maurice at the Hague, as persons that fa∣voured the remonstrants, which was then considered as a crime against the government, insomuch that by these insinuations they were in danger of being strip∣ped of all their employments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Council of Dort, A. D. 1618.</NOTE>. The first session and opening of this venerable assembly, was Nov. 13, 1618. John Bogerman was chosen president of it; the same worthy and moderate divine, who had be∣fore translated into Low Dutch Beza's treatise, to prove the lawfulness of punishing heretics, with a preface recommendatory to the civil magistrate; chosen, not by the whole synod, but by the Low Country divines only, the foreigners not being allowed any share in the election.</P>
<P>At the fifth session the remonstrants petitioned the synod, that a competent number of their friends might have leave to appear before them, and that the citation might be sent to the whole body, and not to any single person, to the end that they might be at liberty to send such as they should judge best qualified to de∣fend their cause; and particularly insisted, that Gro∣vinckhovius and Goulart might be of the number. One would have thought that so equitable a request should have been readily granted. But they were told, that it could not be allowed that the remonstrants should pass for a distinct body, or make any deputa∣tion of persons in their common name to treat of their
<PB N="179" REF="192"/>affairs; and agreeably to this declaration the summons that were given out, were not sent to the remonstrants as a body or part of the synod, but to such particular persons as the synod thought fit to chuse out of them; which was little less than citing them as criminals before a body of men, which chiefly consisted of their professed adversaries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act. Syn. Dord. Sess. 22.</NOTE>. When they first appeared in the synod, and Episcopius, in the name of the rest of them, talked of entering into a regular conference about the points in difference, they were immediately given to understand, that no conference was intended, but that their only business was to deliver their sentiments, and humbly to wait for the judgment of the council con∣cerning them. Episcopius, in the name of his bre∣thren, declared, that they did not own the synod for their lawful judges, because most of that body were their avowed enemies, and fomenters and promoters of the unhappy schism amongst them; upon which they were immediately reprimanded by the president, for im∣peaching and arraigning their authority, and presum∣ing to prescribe laws to these whom the States General had appointed for their judges. The divines of Geneva added upon this head, "That if people obstinately refused to submit to the lawful determinations of the church, there then remained two methods to be used against them; the one, that the civil magistrate might stretch out his arm of compulsion; the other, that the church might exert her power, in order to separate and cut off by a public sentence, those who violated the laws of God." After many debates on this head, be∣tween the synod and the remonstrants, who adhered to their resolution, of not owning the synod for their judges, they were turned out of it by Bogerman the president with great insolence and fury; to the high dissatisfaction of many of the foreign divines.</P>
<P>After the holy synod had thus rid themselves of the remonstrants, whose learning and good sense would
<PB N="180" REF="193"/>have rendered them exceeding troublesome to this as∣sembly, they proceeded to fix the faith; and as they had no opposition to fear, and were almost all of one side, at least in the main points, they agreed in their articles and canons; and in their sentence against the remonstrant clergy who had been cited to appear be∣fore them; which was to this effect: "They beseeched and charged, in the name of Christ, all and singular the ministers of the churches throughout the United Netherlands, &amp;c. that they forsake and abandon the well known five articles of the remonstrants, as being false, and no other than secret magazines of errors— And whereas some, who are gone out from amongst us, calling themselves remonstrants, have out of pri∣vate views and ends, unlawfully violated the discipline and government of the church — have not only trumped up old errors, but hammered out new ones too—have blackened and rendered odious the esta∣blished doctrine of the church with impudent sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nders and calumnies, without end or measure, have filled all places with scandal, discord, scruples, troubles of conscience—all which heinous offences ought to be restrained and punished in clergymen with the severest censures: therefore this national synod—being assured of its own authority—doth hereby declare and deter∣mine, that those ministers, who have acted in the churches as heads of factions, and teachers of errors, are guilty, and convicted of having violated our holy religion, having made a rent in the unity of the church, and given very great scandal: And as for those who were cited before this synod, that they are besides guilty of intolerable disobedience — to the commands of the venerable synod: for all which rea∣sons the synod doth, in the first place, discharge the aforesaid cited persons from all ecclesiastical administra∣tions, and deprive them of their offices, judging them likewise unworthy of any academical employment— And as for the rest of the remonstrant clergy, they
<PB N="181" REF="194"/>are hereby recommended to the provincial synods, classes and consistories—who are to take the utmost care—that the patrons of errors be prudently dis∣covered; that all obstinate, clamorous, and factious disturbers of the church, under their jurisdiction, be forthwith deprived of their ecclesiastical and academi∣cal office—And they the said provincial synods are therefore exhorted—to take a particular care, that they admit none into the ministry, who shall refuse to subscribe, or promise to preach the doctrine asserted in these synodical decrees; and that they suffer none to continue in the ministry, by whose public dissent the doctrine which hath been so unanimously approved by all the members of this synod, the harmony of the clergy, and the peace of the church, may be again disturbed — And they most earnestly and humbly beseech their gracious God, that their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligh Mighti∣nesses may suffer and ordain this wholesome doctrine, which the synod hath faithfully expressed—to be maintained alone, and in its purity within their pro∣vinces—and restrain turbulent and unruly spirits— and may likewise put in execution the sentence pro∣nounced against the above-mentioned persons—and ratify and confirm the decrees of the synod by their authority."</P>
<P>The States readily obliged them in this Christian and charitable request; for as soon as the synod was concluded, the old advocate Barnevelt was beheaded, who had been a zealous and hearty friend to the re∣monstrants and their principles; and Grotius con∣demned to perpetual imprisonment; and because the cited ministers would not promise wholly, and always, to abstain from the exercise of their ministerial func∣tions, the States passed a resolution for the banishing of them, on pain, if they did not submit to it, of being treated as disturbers of the public peace. And though they only begged a respite of the sentence for a few days, to put their affairs in order, and to pro∣vide
<PB N="182" REF="195"/>themselves with a little money to support them∣selves and families in their banishment, even this was unmercifully denied them, and they were hurried away next morning by four o'clock, as though they had been enemies to the religion and liberties of their country.</P>
<P>Such was the effect of this famous Presbyterian sy∣nod, who behaved themselves as tyrannically towards their brethren, as any prelatical council whatsoever could do▪ and to the dishonour of the church of Eng∣land it must be said, that they owned their synodical power, and concurred by their deputies, Carleton Bi∣shop of Landaff, Hall, Davenant and Ward, in con∣demning the remonstrants, in excommunicating and depriving them, and turning them out of their churches, and in establishing both the discipline and doctrines of Geneva, in the Netherlands. For after the council was ended, the remonstrants were every where driven out of their churches, and prohibited from holding any private meeting, and many of them banished on this very account. The reader will find a very parti∣cular relation of these transactions, in the learned Ge∣rard Brandt's history of the reformation of the Low Countries, to which I must refer him.</P>
<P>If we look into our own country we shall find numerous proofs of the same antichristian spirit and practice. Even our first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>formers, who had seen the flames which the Papists had kindled against their brethren, yet lighted fires themselves to consume those who dif∣fered from them. Cranmer's hands were stained with the blood of several. He had a share in the prose∣cution and condemnation of that pious and excellent martyr John Lambert, and consented to the death of Ann Askew; who were burnt for denying the corpo∣ral presence, which, though Cranmer then believed, he saw afterwards reason to deny. In the year 1549, Joan Bocher was condemned for some enthusiastical opinions about Christ, and delivered over to the secular
<PB N="183" REF="196"/>power. The sentence being returned to the council, King Edward VI. was moved to sign a warrant for her being burnt, but could not be prevailed with to do it. Cranmer endeavoured to persuade him by such arguments as rather silenced than satisfied the young King. So he set his hand to the warrant with tears in his eyes, saying to the Archbishop, that if he did wrong, since it was in submission to his authority, he should answer for it to God. Though this struck Cranmer with horror, yet he at last put the sentence in execution against her. About two years alter, one George Van Pare, a Dutchman, was accused before them, for saying, that God the Father was only God, and that Christ was not very God. And though he was a person of a very holy life, yet because he would not abjure, he was condemned for heresy, and burnt in Smithfield. The Archbishop himself was afterwards burnt for heresy, which, as Fox observed, many looked on as a just retaliation from the providence of God, for the cruel severities he had used towards others.</P>
<P>In 1621, there was a warm dispute between the re∣monstrants and contra-remonstrants, when Grotius en∣deavoured to do the remonstrants some service with his pen, by publishing a Latin treatise, wherein he shews what was the opinion of the primitive Chris∣tians, touching the five famous points of the remon∣strants; but he was so very cautious of giving offence, that he would not disclose his name; but chose rather to lie concealed, and to use arguments in favour of moderation, which might have the most salutary ten∣dency.</P>
<P>In July 1621, he published his Latin poem, inti∣tled Sylva, wherein he shews his regard to the sacred scriptures, and that notwithstanding his long imprison∣ment he had not lost his poetical talent. It is inscri∣bed Thuanus, junior; and as it so well comports with the design of this work, we shall give an extract
<PB N="184" REF="197"/>from it, not doubting it will be acceptable to the reader<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's Hist. of the Reformation, vol. iv. p. 346, 347.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Indeed almost the whole of the transactions of the year 1622 are no other than scenes of persecution, by fines, imprisonment, confiscation and death itself, nay, even employing persons as scouts to find out causes of accusation or suspicion, examining them by sundry questions, sometimes of a negative nature, at other times by promises or threats, trying to extort confessions of themselves, or accusation of others by promises or threats; and when they had by these artful and popish methods, like those of the inquisition, obtained the least room whereon to ground their proceedings, we find they were dealt with as if they had been enemies to the state and good of mankind. I would not presume to say there were no exceptions to this general persecution. Some few magistrates, whose consciences were not so hardened, and quite insensible, permitted, in contempt of the laws and placarts, the remonstrants to meet, and to worship God according to their own con∣sciences<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Brandt's History, vol. iv. from page 349 to page 369.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The conclusion of Dr. Gerard Brandt's history of the reformation, which is in the year 1623, amongst other remarkable transactions, informs us, that, through other instances of persecution, the re∣monstrants were even obliged to seek for shelter in Popish countries. Grotius and many others fled to France, and were in some measure protected from that unchristian persecution which they so severely felt in their native provinces. Application was likewise made to his most Christian Majesty, to interpose his good offices in their favour; and the remonstrants joined in a petition to the Prince of Orange, partly on account of the hardships they had sustained, and particularly with respect to a groundless and malicious charge of conspiracy against his sacred person. What effects how∣ever arose from these efforts of the remonstrants, we may refer the reader to Brandt's history of the refor∣mation.</P>

<P>We may here mention what Charles Lewis, the Elector Palatine, declared with relation to the reli∣gion of some Princes in Germany. He said, Fre∣derick II. who first reformed the palatinate, resolved to shake off Popery, and to set up Lutheranism in his country; but a counsellor of his said to him, that the Lutherans would always depend upon Saxony, so it would not become him, who was the first Elector, to be only second in that party; it was more for his dig∣nity to become a Calvinist; he would be the head of that party; it would give him great interest in Swit∣zerland, and make the Huguenots in France and in the Netherlands depend on him. He was by that de∣termined to the Helvetian confession. But upon the ruin of his family, the Duke of Newburg had an in∣terview with the Elector of Brandenburgh, about their concerns in Juliers and Cleves; and he persuaded that Elector to turn Calvinist, for since their family was fallen, nothing would more contribute to raise the other, than the espousing that side, which would natu∣rally come under his protection; but he added, that, for himself, he had turned Papist, since his little prin∣cipality lay so near both Austria and Bavaria. This that Elector told him with a sort of pleasure, when he made it appear that other Princes had no more sense of religion than himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Burnet's History of his own Times, p. 14.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>INtroductory to the history of the Reformation in France, we shall observe, that notwithstanding the gross and almost universal corruption of christianity, by the inventions of the church of Rome, and not∣withstanding the necessity of a reformation, from the more flagrant errors and unchristian practices of that church, their emissaries have always represented the reformation as criminal in its motives; that libertinism was the soul, and rebellion the strongest bulwark thereof; and perhaps in no nation whatever have per∣secution and cruelty against Protestants been more violent than in France.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, that all those, of what country soever, who have shook off the papal yoke, are indis∣criminately, and without exception, stiled heretics, on account of their refusing to profess errors shocking to reason and common sense.</P>
<P>Again, it is certain they charge the reformation with being a new doctrine, quite unknown to, or uni∣versally rejected by, the churches through all countries, preceding the ages of the reformers; though it is easy to give an historical demonstration, that, without re∣gard to the points debated between us and the church of Rome (especially those essential articles that have occasioned our separation) we teach nor practise no∣thing but what was believed and practised by the church in the most pure ages of christianity.

<PB N="188" REF="203"/>adversaries of the first promoters of the reformation are forced indeed to acknowledge, that the increase and spread of it has been very extraordinary, though they do not believe or confess with us, that it has been, under God, owing to the justness of the Protestant cause. Thus father Daniel says, that the fatal contagion had its source from men of no birth or learning, dignity and eminence in the world; and how, opinions asserted by obscure and illiterate people, who in maintaining them could expect nothing but opposition and persecu∣tion, yet were soon after embraced by the most learned, by Princes and Princesses, by the Nobility and Ple∣beians, by Bishops and Abbots, who receive, as well as the meanest people, and persist in the same in spite of all obstacles. Had the Romish missionaries met with the success in China, in proportion to the powerful prevalence of the reformation in England or France, how would they have canonized the missionaries, and thought it as incontestable a proof, that God was with them, as if they had the evidence of miracles to attest it?</P>
<P>Father Daniel acknowledges indeed, that the Lu∣therans had already urged, for a long while, and laid great stress on, the ignorance and corruption among the clergy; which the people were very apt to give credit to. As to the doctrines, nothing seemed to be more plausible than what the innovators proposed to the Ro∣manists, viz. to take the scriptures for the sole stand∣ard of the belief of the faithful. The reformers were never weary of challenging them to shew, in the gos∣pel, purgatory, the worship of images and relics, monastic vows, the celibacy of the clergy, the several hierarchical orders, and other the like, that are well grounded on tradition, and which it is very difficult to demonstrate, with evidence, from the scripture.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, he pretends that our religion inspires men with a furious hatred against all lawful powers. They could say nothing worse; with this pretence also,
<PB N="189" REF="204"/>that all the civil wars in France were, for so many years together, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid to our charge. These calumnies against our religion, says my author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stephen Abel Laval, author of this History, from whence we have principally given this abstract.</NOTE>, have moved me to write the present history of the beginnings, progress, and establishment of the reformed religion in France, as well as of its declining and downfall, and of the entire ruin of our churches in that kingdom; which we think will fully satisfy the unprejudiced reader, that the progress of the reformation in France is neither owing to the credit or power, and much less to the vi∣olence of Protestants; but only to the piety, upright∣ness, and purity of manners of those who embraced Protestantism. The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will be convinced, that the pro∣gress of it was owing to the resolution and heroic con∣stancy of our glorious martyrs for forty years together; who, with wonderful courage, have stood the hardest trials, and lost their lives in opposing error and impo∣sitions on the rights of conscience. This is even by our adversaries confession the glory of our reforma∣tion: this is the golden age of our churches; their piety never shone more bright, than when their safety obliged them to seek places of retirement to pay their religious worship. How great was the fervour of their zeal, the simplicity and purity of their manners, the humility of their whole conduct, and their charity to∣wards one another, and with all mankind?</P>
<P>But these valuable dispositions did not always last: many Protestants, and even whole synods, have sell into more sins, and conduct most uncharitable to others; and some of the ministers of Christ have degenerated from that humility and goodness, the true character of the primitive Christians, into that covetousness and love of power, as even to anathematize, and put off from the communion of the church, their brethren, for whom Christ died; and that for the sake of opinions,
<PB N="190" REF="205"/>wherein the most sophistical genius could never find any thing contrary to the chief design and tendency of the Christian religion, which was to make men truly vir∣tuous in heart and life.</P>
<P>Such dispositions among Protestants have greatly retarded the progress of reformation; the great prin∣ciple of which is, the liberty of examining all things, and of retaining what is good. Forcing consciences, inflicting penalties, to oblige people to believe, is pro∣fessing Popery again, and renouncing the reformation, and consequently the spirit of the gospel. Papists took advantage of this; and the Jesuits neglected no oppor∣tunity of inspiring the minds of people with a fondness for orthodoxy, and infusing doubts with respect to the authority and validity of our sacred books, and have endeavoured to substitute a veneration for tradition, and the opinions of the fathers, which have tended to render the minds of some persons quite indifferent as to religion; have led many others not only to renounce the reformation, but Christianity itself, and have contributed to that vast increase of Deism that have prevailed in many parts of Europe. But, amidst all the confusions that have been introduced into the world thro' an intemperate zeal, and fondness for particular tenets, to the destruction of liberty and virtue, and in∣difference with respect to revealed religion, happy that nation, under the government of Christian Princes, who are animated with a Christian zeal for virtue as well as for truth; with a zeal guided by knowledge, inspired by charity, void of all human considerations; who have nothing but the glory of God, and the happiness of men in view; with a zeal entirely free from a base compliance with error, and yet no less full of con∣descension and indulgence to such whom they con∣ceive have fallen into them, and make no other distinc∣tion in regard to their present condition, their natural rights and privileges, between the Jew or the Christian, than what even discretion requires. And whilst the
<PB N="191" REF="206"/>ensuing history will probably lay open many tragical scenes, in the attempt for, and in the progress of the reformation of France, especially of the unparalleled persecutions that attended the suppression of it: we may joyfully congratulate the subjects of our own na∣tion, as well as some foreign states, where the establish∣ed religion is preserved inviolably, and have not, espe∣cially since the revolution, suffered any infringement nor alteration, with respect to her constitution, doctrine, or worship, whilst toleration continues to be exercised with lenity to every differing sect of Christians, for the peaceable and quiet exercise of their religion and wor∣ship, agreeable to the dictates of their conscience: so that applied to spirituals, every one can sit under his own vine, and under his own fig tree, and none dare to make him afraid.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> REFORMATION <HI>in</HI> FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>The Reformation of France furnishes us with so many surprising events, that some account of its rise, progress, and suppression, seems to merit the attention of every sensible man; and will, I presume, at this distance of time, not be unacceptable to my readers.</P>
<P>Among the many causes which concurred to pro∣mote a reformation, were, the Popes usurpations and tyranny, the clergy's ignorance and dissoluteness, the dispersion of the Waldenses, the restoration of learning, Leo's bull of indulgences; and the disputes occasioned by it may be reckoned considerable.</P>
<P>It is well known, that, since the 13th century, the church's authority was become the capital point of religion, and that by the church the Pope was meant; in him every thing centered, privileges of churches, and prerogatives of Sovereigns, were in great measure dependent on him.</P>
<P>Pope Alexander VI. in the 15th century, under pretence of religion, declared war, and enjoined peace;
<PB N="192" REF="207"/>he married and divorced, he condemned and absolved, he tied and untied, just as he pleased; and had it not been for the schism that prevailed in that century, they would wholly have engaged to themselves the tem∣poral power as well as the spiritual: however, the Popes were become real Sovereigns, not only with respect to the power they had usurped, but with re∣spect to the immense riches, which thro' numberless channels they had caused to flow into the apostolic chamber.</P>
<P>So far were their lives from answering the charac∣ter of Holiness, which they claimed, that Rome and Avignon were the center of pride and luxury; and Alexander IV. before mentioned, Mezeray tells us, intruded himself into the chair by corruption and bribery, then sold and disposed of every thing after his own will, that no Mahomedan Prince was ever so imperious, vicious, and unfaithful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mezeray, ubi supra, p. 378.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Julius II. who succeeded him in 1503, distinguished himself by the persecution of Christians. This Vicar of Christ went himself to engage in a war, kindled by him against Christian Princes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. ix. p. 324.</NOTE>. He forsook the chair of St. Peter, to take upon him the title of Mars, god of battle, to display in the field the three crowns; and indeed he gave sufficient proof that he was more devoted to Mars than to Christ, if swearing, lewdness, and cruelty, are sufficient proofs of it.</P>
<P>The Germans, provoked at the exactions and tyranny of the church of Rome, tendered a petition to the Emperor Maximilian: upon which he, in concert with the King of France, called a council, proclaimed to be held at Pisa, May 15, 1511, to find ways and means, as it was pretended, to reform the church in its head, and in its members; tho', as Guicciardine affirms, those pretended reformers were little better than Julius
<PB N="193" REF="208"/>himself. From Pisa the council was transferred to Milan, where the fathers being assembled, they sum∣moned, at several times, the Pope to appear before them in person: at length, upon his refusing, suspend∣ed him from his office, and forbid his subjects paying obedience to him. From Milan the council was re∣moved to Lyons; and at last all this bustle came to nothing.</P>
<P>Julius, to frustrate their designs, calls another coun∣cil at Lateran, or Latran, in 1512, wherein that of Pisa, Milan, and Lyons, were condemned, and all its decrees declared void: nay, Lewis XII. was ex∣communicated by Julius, and his kingdom suspended from divine service. However, Pope Julius died Fe∣bruary 21, 1513, during the sessions of the Lateran coun∣cil, and Pope Leo X. succeeded him. A change indeed, but very little for the better, as his luxury, his injustice, dissimulation, and ingratitude, stand upon record; but above all, his exorbitant exactions and cruelties render him notorious. The council of Lateran was con∣tinued, and the holy fathers, as they are called, ap∣plied themselves rather to plunge the church into gros∣ser corruption, than to find ways to reform it. Lewis XII. was brought in to undo what he had done; and Francis I. who succeeded him, acceded to the Pope's measures; and, in January 1515, came to an agreement to receive into his kingdom certain new constitutions, called the Concordate, which had been drawn up by Mons. Du Prat, to serve instead of the pragmatic sanc∣tion. This Concordate opposed the rights and liber∣ties of the Gallican church, and threw the nation of France into great tumults and warm debates. Such were the pretended Vicars of Jesus Christ, and supreme heads of his church, at the beginning of the 16th cen∣tury; and we may easily conceive, that such Popes took no care, to fill up what is called the sacred college, with persons truly pious and devout, but with those
<PB N="194" REF="209"/>who were most likely to subserve their mercenary views, or rather base purposes.</P>
<P>Leo, knowing not how or where to find money to answer the purpose of his luxury, created thirty Cardi∣nals in one morning at 50,000 ducats each. The le∣gates sent to the different courts of Europe, were em∣ployed as so many incendiaries, to stir up to war and bloodshed against every one who should dare to question this divine right of the Pope, to approve or oppose whatever he thought proper. The rest of the clergy were no better in general: Bishops were promoted purely from their attachment and eminent services to the church of Rome; and especially if they discovered a disposition to persecute those whom the church deem∣ed heretics.</P>
<P>Such was, in general, the deplorable state of the church, and it was the object of every good man's wish to see a reformation; and it had been the outward and professed intention of the councils of Pisa, Milan, &amp;c. but the events give us but little proof of their sincerity.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this general corruption of the doc∣trine and depravation of manners, there were still some who had not bowed the knee to Baal; some of the Waldenses, who being forced out of their native coun∣tries by cruel persecutions, had sheltered themselves in France, Flanders, Germany, England, and Bohemia, and persevered in the doctrine of Christ, without any mixture, at least, in the most essential points; so that their dispersion helped, not a little, to the information and reformation of many from those superstitions.</P>
<P>Another thing that contributed much towards the restoration of truth, was the restoration of learning. The subversion of the Constantinopolitan empire in 1453, had occasioned many learned men to fly into Italy, France, Germany, and other parts, whereby the knowledge of several branches of learning, and particularly of the Greek tongue, spread itself in greater
<PB N="195" REF="210"/>perfection. The benevolence and liberality of Francis I. incited by the great Budeus's solicitations, enticed a great number into his dominions; by which, not only the original languages, but most of the sciences, ob∣tained repute.</P>
<P>It was not long before the good effects thereof were visible in that kingdom, and was preparatory to that happy change which happened to the church in the 16th century, when, enlightened by the restoration of learning, they were ashamed of the errors and super∣stitions which had been imposed upon them; and it is no wonder then, if truth found so free access to their hearts, if it was greedily received by a vast number of every rank and sex in so many countries of Europe, since they waited only, as it were, for a proper oppor∣tunity to declare themselves openly. Pope Leo, in 1520, afforded them that opportunity, by his insatiable greediness, and intolerable extortions, exemplified in his bull of indulgences; whereupon Luther published his book, intitled <HI>The Babylonian Captivity.</HI> Such were the first beginnings of the reformation in Germany, which spread itself in a few years in several large pro∣vinces of the empire, in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, England, Scotland, Switzerland, and was there ad∣mitted, and became the national religion, though not under the same denomination.</P>
<P>But tho' it has never been the happiness of France to have the reformation admitted and settled in it, in like manner, as to be the national religion; neverthe∣less, all the malice, hatred, and persecutions of men, hindered not the truth from penetrating into it, and taking root in the hearts of a prodigious number of its subjects, and even among some of the clergy, particu∣larly William Brissonnet, Bishop of Meaux, who coun∣tenanced the reformation; but not being able to endure the persecution in 1522, recanted.</P>
<P>John Le Clerc, tho' a mean mechanic, was the first martyr in France. After a severe whipping in 1523,
<PB N="196" REF="211"/>he had the courage to establish a reformed church at Lorrain, and sealed the truth with his blood in 1524.</P>
<P>Francis I. persecuted the reformed, from the persua∣sion and insinuation of Du<SUP>c</SUP> Pratz, and other priests, and many cruel executions ensued.</P>
<P>A. D. 1532.] But Calvin comes about this time to Orleans, where, by his public preaching, he gained many proselytes. The reformation was likewise en∣couraged at Thoulouse: learning in general had been promoted, to which the illustrious Scaliger not a little contributed. Persons of sober minds began to em∣brace the principles of the reformation; and several were imprisoned, and some burnt this year.</P>
<P>In 1533, Margaret, Queen of Navarre, countenanced the reformation, and solicited the King of France not to proceed to rigorous measures against them, and made no small impression on him; but the indiscreet zeal of some quite altered his good intentions, and made him publish a severe placart against them in 1534, and another against the Lutherans, by which even those who harboured or concealed them were made liable to the same punishment, and the informer to be intitled to the fourth part of their goods; in con∣sequence of which, the persecution raged furiously throughout all the provinces of that kingdom. Bran∣tome gives us an account, that the King was advised to begin at his own family, pointing to the Queen of Navarre, if he would extirpate heretics out of his king∣dom; and though that advice was not taken, the King had such abettors, that she found it necessary for her own safety not to interpose.</P>
<P>This year, 1535, a vast number of martyrs sealed the truth with their blood in France, in the Nether∣lands, and in England; where Henry VIII. who had renounced the Pope's authority, rather from ambition and resentment, than out of any principle of religion, persecuted with the utmost rigour those who adhered to Luther's or Zuinglius's opinions.</P>

<P>The Sorbonne, this year, usurped the authority of making new articles of faith. The Bishops to whom the cognizance and direction of these things properly belonged, as it were, winked at it; while the Sorbonne compiled and imposed twenty-six articles as absolutely necessary to be believed. These articles were publish∣ed, in Paris, by the common crier; and they were afterwards printed by the King's command<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Laval's History, vol. i. p. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Calvin published an answer to them, and wrote with much wit perspicuity, and strength of argument: nevertheless, there was a great persecution this year at A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>higny, and afterwards at Sens; and at Rouen, one Mr. Husson was condemned by the parliament to be burnt, for having dispersed some pamphlets against the articles of the Sorbonne, which he suffered with an un∣common constancy, and upon which great numbers embraced Protestantism, in spite of the persecution that threatened them.</P>
<P>We come now to that most cruel and inhuman slaughter made of the poor Merindolans, and those of Cabrieres, who were the immediate offspring of the Waldenses, whose predecessors had been cruelly per∣secuted in the reign of Lewis XII. about the year 1506.</P>
<P>Of this persecution Father Paola gives the following account. While, says he, they held assemblies at Trent to confute their heresy by the council's means, the same thing was done in France by the force of arms, against a part of the Waldenses dwelling in the mountains of Provence, and who had kept themselves separated from the Roman see, following other tenets and ceremonies,
<PB N="199" REF="216"/>tho' gross and imperfect; but after the alterations that Zuinglius had made in his doctrine, they had supplied by it the defects of their own, and had given some form to their ceremonies. This happened when Ge∣neva received the reformation: for some years ago the parliament had issued a decree against them, which had not as yet been put in execution; but now with a power∣ful army, headed by the president of the parliament, against those poor people, who having no thoughts of making defence, they put to the sword, in a cruel mer∣ciless manner, above 4000 in the town of Cabrieres in Provence, and Merindo, in the county of Vennaissin, and afterwards pillaged and burnt the houses. Nay, so many and great were their cruelties, that when it was related to the King, tho' he had approved of the suppressing of those he called heretics, he was struck with horror, and would have brought some of the prin∣cipal promoters of it to condign punishment; but they found means to escape, except Gueren, who was be∣headed by order of the parliament at Paris.</P>
<P>This year it was much disputed, whether it is lawful to dissemble one's religion. The divines of Switzer∣land, Geneva, and Germany, were consulted upon it; and tho' some were more rigid than others, yet they all agreed upon this point, that nobody can serve two dif∣ferent masters of contrary interests. Their respective answers were printed and published, which contributed not a little to the establishment and encouragement of Protestants.</P>
<P>A. D. 1546.] This year is famous for the war kindled between the Emperor and the Protestants of Germany, and no less remarkable for the cruel persecution against the reformed at Meaux. The assembly had been dis∣persed by a persecution in the year 1523; howbeit, they sprung up again, and became the envy of the Romish bigots, so that a sudden and violent persecution com∣menced against them. Fourteen were sentenced to be burnt alive, and their goods forfeited; others to be
<PB N="200" REF="217"/>publickly whipped, others imprisoned, and others banished; and the minister, Mr. Mangin, was ordered to have his tongue cut out before his execution. Other instances of persecution were frequent, as at Senlis, at Nonnay; and at Sens, one Mr. L'Anglois was burnt at the instance of his own uncle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. i. p. 63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All this was effected by courts of justice, established in several places of the kingdom, to receive informa∣tions against the reformed, and to try, condemn, and execute, without any appeal.</P>
<P>A. D. 1547.] This year died Henry VIII. King of England, also Francis I. King of France; both of them persecutors of Protestants: with this difference, that the former did it from principles of what he called religion; the latter was a persecutor rather out of policy than inclination, and, in submission to the dictates of the Popes, was almost always engaged in a war with the Emperor.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all the cruel persecutions against the reformed, they every where increased; and there were few towns in France, in which there were not Protes∣tants, tho' no regular churches or divine service, but praying and singing in places of retirement: for Henry II. who then succeeded to the throne, was a magna∣nimous Prince, and of an easy temper; and would pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bly have connived at the increase of the Hugue∣nots, as the reformed were then called, but there were some who gained an ascendance over him, particularly the Cardinals Diana and St. Andrew. They gave the King to understand, that the reformed religion was no friend to the monarchical government, and the spring of all confusion and disorders; that the best way to hide, before God and man, the manifold sins he was guilty of, was to destroy utterly all the enemies of the ancient religion; and they prevailed so far upon him, that executions became more frequent than in the former
<PB N="201" REF="218"/>reign, and particularly at Paris, where the burning chamber exerted itself with all that zeal which super∣stition doth commonly inspire.</P>
<P>A. D. 1552.] The gag was put in use this year for the first time, invented purposely to hinder the poor martyrs from speaking to the people, or singing psalms to comfort themselves, as they were led to execution, or upon the pile. The first, who suffered it, was one Nicholas Nail, a book-hawker, who was executed at Paris in the most barbarous manner.</P>
<P>The death of King Edward VI. that happened in July, proved to be a fatal blow in the reformed reli∣gion in this kingdom; for Mary his sister, who suc∣ceeded him, notwithstanding the opposition of the Duke of Northumberland, who endeavoured to fix Jane Gray, his daughter-in law, upon the throne; Mary, I say, was a very cruel and bloody persecutrix of her reformed subjects; insomuch that their condition was in no wise better here during her reign than in France.</P>
<P>A. D. 1555.] The insatiable avidity of Diana of Poitiers, after the many confiscations of the effects of the reformed, more than a zeal of religion, occasioned every day new executions of these poor people: which however hindered not truth from taking a firmer root; insomuch that, in the year 1555, several churches were settled with their own pastors, and governed by a re∣gular discipline.</P>
<P>The first of them was at Paris, in which many were so exemplary for purity of manners, that many became proselytes to protestantism. This, however, was followed with new regulations for the trial and punishment of heretics. The Cardinal of Lorrain endeavours to have a tribunal of inquisition settled in France, like that of Spain.—The Cardinal, in order to gratify the Pope, and to render the persecution per∣petual in France, after the pattern of the inquisition of Spain, insinuated with the King, and obtained leave
<PB N="202" REF="219"/>to petition the Pope, to have such a settlement in his dominion; and lest it should be thought the Cardinal required such an authority for himself, he desired the Pope to name the Cardinals of Bourbon and Chatil∣lon, and join them with him in the office of inquisi∣tors general; and at the same time took care to have his emissaries to declare against the Protestants, tho' it was by the most glaring falsehoods.</P>
<P>In this situation, there were several apologies wrote for the reformers. One was very short, but framed after such a manner, that the ancient doctors of the church were introduced, upholding the same cause with those who were then stiled heretics.</P>
<P>A. D. 1557.] Some of the Sorbonists undertook an answer to it. One was a doctor and inquisitor, who, without pretending to any proof, asserted that the re∣formed were heretics, and as such ought to be burnt; and left no stone unturned to accomplish his wish.</P>
<P>At length the King, being informed that a great number of reformers were imprisoned, and their cause ready to be heard, sent his warrant to the court of parliament, to supersede all other affairs, and to proceed extraordinarily upon this. In pursuance of which nine were sentenced to be burnt, and were executed; among whom was a widow lady of twenty-three years of age, and an exquisite beauty, who was put to the torture, had her tongue cut out, her feet and face parched, was then strangled, and burnt to ashes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. i. p. 93.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Till this time there had been but few of the nobi∣lity and gentry, who had embraced the reformation; but now three of the greatest lords of the court de∣clared themselves for it; some Princesses, as also An∣thony King of Navarre, first Prince of the blood, Lewis of Bourbon, his brother Prince of Conde, and Francis Dandelot, brother to the Admiral Coligny.</P>
<P>The King of Navarre had countenanced the refor∣mation in his own dominions. He was present at
<PB N="203" REF="220"/>some of their religious assemblies: nay, he went far∣ther, for he went to the prison where some of them were confined, and procured their release. The Prince of Conde, his mother-in-law, and his consort, followed the reformed doctrine, and made a public and sincere profession of it to the end of their lives.</P>
<P>The bloody designs of the Cardinal of Lorrain, against the reformed, were in a great measure frus∣trated by these discoveries: but what contributed more to his disappointment, was the solemn embassy of the Electors of Saxony, Brandenbourg, and Palatine of the Duke of Deux Ponts and Wittemburg. The King was pleased to answer to these Princes very graciously, because their friendship was necessary to him at that time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. i. p. 98.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By these means the reformed church of Paris in∣creased daily; but it happened, that the reformed took a fancy to meet sometimes in the Clerk's Meadow, a place where the Parisians used to resort for the plea∣sure of walking;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Singing psalms.</NOTE> and there they sung Mariot's psalms in metre, set to very fine musical tunes; which novelty was so pleasing, that vast mul∣titudes joined them, and sung with them. Among others, the King and Queen of Navarre went thither, with several lords and gentlemen, both natives and foreigners, and walked singing with the people.</P>
<P>But the clergy were terribly alarmed at this, and made use of all their influence to have those assem∣blies suppressed: for which reason, they sent to the King, who was then at his camp at Amiens, and in∣formed him that the Lutherans had raised a sedition in the city of Paris, and that they had assembled together with pistols and other arms. When his Majesty heard this, he issued a proclamation, forbidding all such meet∣ings, under pain of being punished as seditious, and disturbers of the public peace. Cardinal Bertrandi, Lord Keeper, was sent to inform against them; some of them were arrested, and committed to prison;
<PB N="204" REF="221"/>but it was found, that the cause of their commit∣ment was not sufficient.</P>
<P>There was soon after a secret conference, held be∣tween the Cardinal of Lorrain and the Cardinal Gran∣ville, wherein that cunning minister of Philip, in a very artificial speech, gave Cardinal Lorrain to under∣stand, that the King his master was highly displeased to see persons, tainted with heresy, so much in favour at the court of France; and named Dandelot.</P>
<P>A. D. 1558.] The Cardinal, being a vain and busy man, thinking to find his account in the new discovery he had made, because he knew that the base suspicion of heresy was enough to incite King Henry to ruin his greatest favourite, came to the King, and told him what he had learnt in a conference with the Bishop of Arras. The King thereupon ordered the Cardinal of Chatillon, and the Duke of Montmorency, to wait upon that Lord, and dispose him to give some satis∣factory account of his religion; for he heartily wished, that he should not be found guilty of the crime of heresy, with which he stood charged.</P>
<P>Dandelot, being summoned, came to Monceaux, where the King was. He was admitted to his au∣dience, while the King sat at dinner; his Majesty talk∣ed to him of the many favours he had bestowed upon him, and that he heard, with much concern, that he entertained very bad notions about religion. He charged him with having caused the new doctrine to be preached in his house, with having been in the Clerk's Meadow, with his forbearing to hear mass, and also with his having sent some books of Lutheranism to the Admiral his brother.</P>
<P>Dandelot answered with great firmness of mind, and declared his opinion about the tenets of the church of Rome in very strong terms. The King exhorted him, in a friendly manner, to take care of himself, to provide for his own security, and avert the danger
<PB N="205" REF="222"/>while it was time. Dandelot not being moved, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣swered to this purpose.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I stand so far indebted to your Majesty's good∣ness for the many favours and honours conferred upon me, that as I never spared, so in duty bound I will never spare my fortune nor life for your Ma∣jesty's service. But after having done my duty to∣wards your Majesty, don't take it amiss, I beseech you, if I spend the rest of my time to work out my salvation. The doctrine, which as I confess I have caused to be preached, is pure and holy, taken out of the Old and New Testament, approved of by the antient councils and the divines of the primitive church; and is the same which our forefathers have held and believed. I have not been in the Clerk's Meadow, as has been reported to your Majesty; but if I had been there, I should not think I had done any thing against God or your Majesty's service; for after an exact inquiry of what has been done in that place, I find that nothing has been done, but to sing the psalms of David, and to pray to God for the preservation and welfare of your Majesty and of your dominions. I confess that I have not heard mass for a long time; but I did not absent myself from churches or chapels, but for good reasons, which your Majesty would approve of, if you would be at the trouble of considering and weighing them. It is likewise true, that I have sent to my brother, the Admiral, a book very proper to comfort him in his long captivity, which he has suffered for your Majesty's service. So I beseech your Majesty to leave my conscience at liberty, and to dispose of my fortune and life, which are entirely your's, just as ”you shall think fit.</P>
</LETTER>
<PB N="206" REF="223"/>
<P>The King was extremely surprised at this answer; and the Cardinal, who waited only for an opportu∣nity to ruin that Lord, told him to think of what he had said, for he was in a very bad way. To which Dandelot replied, "My Lord Cardinal, I am very well satisfied as to my doctrine, and you know better than you talk. I appeal to your conscience, if you have not been a favourer of that holy doctrine: but the honours and dignities of this world have quite al∣tered your mind, and you are become a persecutor of the true members of Christ's body."</P>
<P>At this the King was greatly enraged, and was so far exasperated, that he fell into very indecent actions, and would have killed him. In this attempt he wounded the Dauphin his son, who stood near him. Dandelot was sent to prison, and deprived of all his places; but the constable found means to have him set at liberty, on condition of his hearing mass in his prison; to which he consented by the solicitations of his lady, though he paid no regard to the performance. He was afterwards very sensible of his own weakness, and penitent for his fault all the days of his life.</P>
<P>Mary Queen of England died the 17th of Novem∣ber. By her death England was delivered of a cruel persecution, which had lasted her whole reign. Cardinal Pool died about seventeen hours after. Queen Eliza∣beth ascends the throne, and the restoration of the re∣formed religion followed of course.</P>
<P>A. D. 1559.] There was likewise a great increase of the reformed churches in France. Mezeray says, there was no town, no province, where the new opinions had not taken root; the lawyers, the learned, and even ecclesiastics, against their own interest, embraced them. The executions proved a means to spread them, and give them new life, insomuch that several members of the parliament, some out of a meek and merciful nature, others from conviction of the truth, thought
<PB N="207" REF="224"/>and intimated that those too rigorous penalties ought to be mitigated.</P>
<P>The King, however, pressed the execution of his edict of Chateau-Briant. He sent orders to the par∣liament of Paris to that effect; but, as it happened, four of the principal reformed, that had been impri∣soned, were just discharged: some, however, whose bigotry and inveteracy against the Protestants run very high, were not wanting to insinuate in his Ma∣jesty's ears, that heresy prevailed; and inferring, that wherever the divine rights of Kings were infringed, it tended to subversion and ruin; and for this purpose several artful counsels were employed to incite his Ma∣jesty, by the most fallacious representations, to the ut∣most cruelties and persecutions, such as had been used against the Albigenses.</P>
<P>A. D. 1559.] The edict, before referred to, was first published in 1539, but put in force five years after∣wards by Lewis XII. by which the solicitor or attorney general was not only to receive any informations brought against the promoters of the new religion, but also to take cognizance of all such as had been informed concerning them, and who, through tenderness or want of resolu∣tion, had not put the laws in execution against them.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the severe measures that seemed to be pursuing▪ some persons of great wisdom, repu∣tation and influence, presumed to discover their un∣willingness to act as their office obliged them, and chose to resign their places. Monsieur de Thou, with his usual freedom and integrity, opposed with all his might that design, which he foresaw would be so fatal to his Majesty and to the kingdom.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these remonstrances, the King went to the parliament on the 10th of June; and when he was seated on his throne, he spoke about religion and the public tranquillity in a manner which plainly dis∣covered, that he was come thither with a bitter ra∣ther than a sedate heart. Then he told them, that he
<PB N="208" REF="225"/>had procured peace to the Christian world, by the marriage of his daughter and of his sister, and was in hopes, that it would be advantageous to his people, and a lasting one; but that he was vexed to his heart, understanding that some, taking advantage of his wars, had handled the matters of religion in such a tumultuary and seditious manner, as they had done. Wherefore he desired for the future, to apply himself entirely to the healing of those evils which the disputes about religion had occasioned in the Christian world; and understanding, that they were assembled for that purpose, he exhorted them to judge of that matter with a perfect integrity; for that it was the cause of God, to which there was no doubt but he was pre∣sent himself, and knew perfectly well all their thoughts and designs.</P>
<P>Then the Cardinal Keeper of the seals commanded them to go on with their votes; and though it was obvious enough to every one, that the King was come only on purpose to dive into their thoughts, and to restrain the freedom of votes; yet many of them, at the peril of their lives, agreeable to their dignity, in∣veighed against the Roman court's manners, and bad usages, which had degenerated into most pernicious errors, which had been the occasion of so many sects, which multiplied themselves every where. They were of opinion to mitigate the punishments, and to put a stop to the severity of the judgments, till the diffe∣rences in religion should be composed, and the disci∣pline of the church restored by the authority of an oecumenical council.</P>
<P>The confession of faith was drawn up in forty arti∣cles, which has been constantly followed by the re∣formed churches in France, and is still by all who go by the name of Calvinists, and which agree in all essential points with that of the church of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Laval, p. 117—139.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="209" REF="226"/>
<P>The ecclesiastical discipline was drawn out into forty articles, which were adapted to the circumstances of the times, and are as many proofs of their prudence, sagacity and sincerity in the government of the church, as well as of their integrity and the purity of their lives.</P>
<P>As to religion, even in the year 1559, in the midst of the cruel persecutions which Henry II. excited against them, the ministers of the reformed churches, of all the provinces of France; assembled in a synod at Paris for the first time, where they drew up that excellent discipline in forty articles, which are the foundation of all the others which have been added since, according to the circumstances of time, to serve as a law to those churches, by which they should con∣duct themselves in such things as concerned religion and good manners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to Laval, vol. iv. p. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1559.] There was an embassy sent from the Protestant Princes of Germany, the contents of which were to this purpose:</P>
<P>That they had heard with great sorrow, that sundry good men, lovers of peace, who professed the same re∣ligion as they, were dealt with in France as if they were seditious persons, and disturbers of the public tranquillity, being clapt in prison, deprived of their goods, sent into exile, nay, put to death for their re∣ligion. For which reason they had sent to the King, being moved by a Christian love and charity, and by that friendship which was settled between them, the King and the kingdom of France, desiring him that he would be pleased to decree nothing in a matter of that moment, wherein the glory of God, and the sal∣vation of so many souls, were concerned, without hav∣ing weighed the reasons of each side; and not to suffer himself to be biassed by any prejudicate opinion; that being solicitous, as it behoves good Princes, no less
<PB N="210" REF="227"/>than the King himself, for the glory of God, their own and their people's salvation, they had searched to find means how to compose these troubles raised on account of religion; that they had found many things introduced into the church, through the avarice and ambition of men, which redounded to the dishonour of God, and afforded a just occasion of scandal, which therefore ought to be reformed according to the word of God, the decrees of the antient councils, and the authority of the fathers of the first centuries; that the complaints against the corruption and depravation of the Roman court were not new; that it was well known that great many divines had written about these things; that Francis I. his father knew very well what was to be done, and had once very wisely undertook to compose the differences of religion, and to reform the ecclesiastical discipline; that such a work was worth the care of a King born of such a father: therefore they intreated him to take it upon him; and since the kingdom of France was in peace with its neighbours abroad, to endeavour to terminate the dif∣ferences of religion in a peaceable and friendly way under his own authority. That the best way for that purpose would be, to chuse some learned men, lovers of peace, to debate the controverted points without bitterness or hatred, and to draw a confession of faith, grounded upon the scriptures and the ancient fathers, to be presented to him. In the mean while, to cause the persecution to cease; to set the prisoners for reli∣gion's sake at liberty; to recall those who had been banished; to restore to their goods and estates those who had been deprived of them. That in doing so, the King would do a thing very acceptable to God, very honourable to himself, useful to his kingdom, and ex∣tremely agreeable to them, who had sent those envoys to intreat him in behalf of those poor wretches; their cause being as it were a common cause with them,
<PB N="211" REF="228"/>and they should stand much obliged to him for the regard he should pay to their recommendation.</P>
<P>The King received the ambassadors very graciously; and told them that he would give them a satisfactory answer; but they were no sooner upon the frontiers, than the fires, which had been thought extinguished by the coming of these envoys, were kindled again, and burnt with greater fury than ever.</P>
<P>The following relation being not only adapted to our purpose, but may likewise entertain and gratify the reader, we give it a place as follows:</P>
<P>A company of comedians arrived at Navarre; one day they gave notice by the public crier, that they had a piece of importance to act that day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 151, and ends p. 153.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The King and Queen, with all their court, came, and there was a crowded audience of all sorts of people. They represented a sick woman at the point of death, shrieking, and begging earnestly to be confessed.</P>
<P>The parish-priest was sent for; he came, in all his apparels, and did what he could; but the sick woman was always in a toss, crying, that she was not well confessed.</P>
<P>Some other ecclesiastics came, who succeeded no better than the parish-priest. After them came some friars of different orders, and spared nothing to relieve her; beads, reliques, indulgences, of which they had their bags full, and which they did read one after another to the sick; all was put in use, but to no purpose. At last they put on her St. Francis's habit, as their last remedy; but the woman found no relief nor rest in her conscience, and said, bemoaning her sad condition, that these people understood not how to confess aright. At which somebody of her acquain∣tance came to her upon the stage, and, lurking every where, as if he was afraid to be heard, whispered to her, that he knew a man who would confess her right, and put her conscience in a state of peace and
<PB N="212" REF="229"/>tranquillity, but that that man went abroad only in the night-time, because the day-light was noxious to him. The woman earnestly desired her friend to call for that man; he came in a lay-dress, and drawing near the bolster, he spoke to the woman without being heard by the company; but they observed by her ges∣tures that she was mighty well pleased. At last he took a small book out of his pocket, and said aloud unto her, This book contains the most infallible receipts for the cure of your disease; if you will make use of them, you shall recover your health perfectly well in a few days. Then he went off the stage, and the sick woman got out of her bed chearful, being perfectly cured; and having walked two or three times upon the stage, she told the audience, that that man un∣known, had wrought what had been impossible to the former, who had visited her; and that she was obliged to confess, that his book was full of receipts, as they might see by that happy change that happened in her; that if any of them was afflicted with the same disease, she advised them to consult the book, which she would readily lend them; forewarning them, however, that they would find it something hot in handling, and that a noisomescent would come out of it, like that of a faggot; that for the rest, if the audience desired to know her name, and the book's name, they were two riddles which they might guess at.</P>
<P>The King and Queen were pleased to express their satisfaction; the whole court followed their example, and a great number of auditors did the same; many of whom already disliked the Roman religion.</P>
<P>They understood perfectly well, that the sick woman was truth; that the first who could not confess her right, were those who took upon them the character of doctors and pastors, and who, instead of wholesome directions, administered nothing but what can serve only for an amusement to babies: that the last-comer was one of those pretended heretics, whom the seve∣rity
<PB N="213" REF="230"/>of the times obliged to conceal themselves, and who alone did rightly confess, when they were called for. Lastly, that the hot book, which smelt of the faggot, was the Holy Bible, forbdiden to be kept at home, and to be read in the vulgar tongue, under pain of fire.</P>
<P>But what pleased much to some, displeased as much to others; particularly, the eccleasiastics were greatly offended at it. They made their complaints to the King, then to the magistrates, and made such a noise, that the comedians were obliged to leave the city sud∣denly and secretly. They would have been dealt with in a much severer manner, had it not been for the King and Queen, to whom that company belonged.</P>
<P>I hope this digression will not be unpleasing to the reader, since it is a subject, the consequence of which was the conversion of many inhabitants, and the in∣crease of the reformed church of that city; which was such, that they elected twelve persons, who, with the minister, made up the vestry: they had no fixed place for their assembly, but they met together sometimes in one, sometimes in another place, and that in the night-time, for fear of being discovered, which was likewise observed by all the churches throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P>A D. 1559.] We are to enter into a new scene of the most tragic events, which scarce can be paralleled in any history, ancient or modern, whether considered in their nature, in their cause, or the springs and the means put in use to bring them forth, or in their long duration. We shall see one of the most flourishing kingdoms made a prey to the avarice and ambition of a foreign family; which, for compassing their ends, gratifying their criminal passions, and paving their way to the throne, by depriving the lawful heirs of their just rights, spared none of those methods, which the most unjust usurpers are wont to put in practice to attain their ends, kna∣very, perfidiousness, perjury, lies, calumnies, mur∣der,

<P>To close this year<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 206.</NOTE>, we shall observe, that the Sor∣bonists, and other preachers, incensed so much the people by their sermons, representing the reformed as men without God, as enemies to the King, that they ran to that degree of madness and cruelty, as to pull them out of the hands of the common hangman, when they were led to be executed, and to torment them in a thousand ways; and for the better discovery of them, being moved thereto, either by their own superstition, or by zealots, they took a freak to set up images at the corners of the streets, and to force all that went by to salute them; and they that refused it, were ac∣counted to be favourably dealt with, if they were only put in prison, after having been mangled and dragged in the dirt, because such a refusal was reckoned a mark of heresy. They had also some boxes like those of the churches for the poor, which they presented to the passers-by, asking money to buy wax-tapers and lights, and other such things; they who refused being in dan∣ger of being killed. Nay, there were amongst them some rakes unwilling to pay their debts, who followed their creditors till they came into some bye-streets, then they began to cry after them, A Lutheran! a Luthe∣ran! or a Christandin! a Christandin! (for the word Huguenot was not yet in use) at which the mob ran in fury upon the poor men, and often dispatched them out of the way.</P>
<P>Whilst the reformed were thus outrageously handled, the threats against the greatest Lords of the kingdom, the wrong done to the Princess of the blood, and other great Lords, the corruption of the chief Ma∣gistrates who were devoted to the Guises, the King's ex∣chequer, that was at their disposal, as well as all the
<PB N="215" REF="234"/>offices and benefices of the kingdom; in a word, their government violent and unlawful in itself: these things, put all together, drew upon them the odium of all, and roused many great Lords, as it were, out of a deep slumber; many combined together for their own de∣fence, and to draw a scheme for settling the govern∣ment on the antient footing, as the laws ordered it.</P>
<P>The reformed performed publickly divine worship at Valence, &amp;c.</P>
<P>These broils, however, hindered not the number of the reformed from increasing daily in all the provinces of France; they held public assemblies every where, their boldness increasing with their number; for, at Valence, in Dauphine, Peter Brule had already preached, to whom succeeded Gilles Santal of Montpelier, under whose management the reformation made a very great progress; for he used to preach every night in the public schools. He was succeeded by Lancelot, of a noble family in Anjou, who had as good success in his ministry as his predecessors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. i. p. 283.</NOTE></P>
<P>While these things were doing, Buriac received a proclamation from court, after the tumult of Amboise was over, by which the King offered his pardon for all that was past, provided they returned to the re∣ligion of their ancestors. To this proclamation John de Monluc, Bishop of Valence, joined a letter to the people of his diocese. The proclamation was read at Valence in the assembly of the Magistrates and Bur∣gesses of the city. Buriac affected, in a set speech, to extol the King's clemency; and having exhorted them to obey, and to pray to God for his Majesty's pre∣servation, he asked the assembly, whether they had a mind to make use of the benefit of the proclamation? Mirabel answered, that his associates were not used to begin any thing, without having first called upon God; and made, with Buriac's consent, a sign to one De Saillant, deacon among the reformed of that place,
<PB N="216" REF="235"/>who kneeling down immediately, as well as the rest of the assembly, made a prayer that was repeated by all except the ecclesiastics; who seeing themselves expo∣sed to the scorn of the people, stood up, not without fear.</P>
<P>The prayer being ended, the reformed answered, that they would most willingly obey the King. As to the grace tendered to them by the proclamation, they stood in no use of it, since they had never conspired against the King, n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r plotted against the state; that they had only sought after liberty of conscience, and, in order to maintain it, had settled lawful assemblies; concern∣ing the rest, they had always studied the public peace, and prayed for the King in their meetings: having taken up arms only for their private security, and not to disturb the public tranquillity, they had no need of pardon, since they had not offended:—which greatly exasperated the Duke of Guise<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. i. p. 282.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>A. D. 1560, <HI>Commotions in</HI> Normandy.</HEAD>
<P>The number of the reformed was so great in Britanny, and in Normandy, that they preached in public, par∣ticularly at Caen, St. Lo, and Dieppe. At their ex∣ample, those of Rouen, by the inconsiderate zeal of the younger sort, which prevailed against the prudent counsels of the old, undertook to preach in public. Some of the members of the parliament, who ad∣hered, advised them to avoid shewing themselves in such public manner.</P>
<P>A schoolmaster who had embraced the tenets of the Anabaptists, having been banished from Geneva, and interdicted from all office in the church, opened a public school at Rouen, pretending to teach three tongues together in a short time, after a very easy method. He began to preach in an open field to a numerous au∣dience, even of those that condemned his opinion. He
<PB N="217" REF="236"/>said, that God had revealed very marvellous things unto him, and especially, that the Antichrist was to be cast down from his throne by force of arms; that he was the man God had elected to be general of his army to destroy all the sinners upon earth; and that he was commanded to kill all the bad Princes and Magistrates; and that he had received this rare gift from God, and should not die before he had created a new world, free from all manner of sin. Then he exhorted his hearers to take up arms with him, and said it was not strange that the enterprise of Amboise had miscarried, since he had not been called to it: as he held forth he made such contorsions of his mouth, at every word shut his eyes, hanged his head down, drew his tongue, and made such figures, as a man possessed, so that some laughed at him; but he imposed upon several, amongst whom were two of his kinsmen, who had harboured him in their house, and countenanced his doctrine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. i. p. 310.</NOTE></P>
<P>Notwithstanding the opposition and the severities exercised towards the reformed, the churches prevailed and increased in many places, at Blois, at Tours, at Angers, at Rouen, at Luneray, at Poitiers and Cha∣telleraud.</P>
<P>At this time the tumults already mentioned arose in Dauphine. This obliged the Guises and others, enemies to the reformed, to dissemble, and be more cir∣cumspect in their behaviour towards them, than they would have been otherwise. The Bishop of Montepelier feigned to be in a great fright, and affecting to give out that he was not safe enough in his episcopal palace, he retired into the castle of St. Peter, where he was fol∣lowed by the Chief Justice and some others; and it was found afterwards that they had melted in it several relicks, among the rest a large silver head of St. Blaise, of which they made money, to play at dice and cards with.</P>
<PB N="218" REF="237"/>
<P>Now Mons. la Chasse, alias Maupeau, minister at Montpelier, by the advice of the elders and deacons, began to preach in the day-time, at seven o'clock in the morning, in the great school of Montpelier; of which the Magistrates having taken notice, they sent on the 24th of September the Judge-criminal to the assembly, with the consuls and some of the most substantial citizens, who being come before the sermon was begun, every one strove to pay them the greatest respect. Then in a set speech he shewed forth the great evils arising from unlawful assemblies; he expatiated much upon the sects of the Libertines and Nicolaits, who refused to acknowledge any King, Prince or Magis∣trate, and from thence took occasion to charge that assembly with a breach of the King's edicts, by which they were forbidden to meet together, or to bear arms. To conclude, he asked them three questions!
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If they did not acknowledge Francis II. for their only true, natural and sovereign Prince?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If they were not resolved to keep his laws, ordinances and edicts?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If they did not acknowledge him as well as the other Magistrates of Montpelier, for the Magistrates and Superiors established by the King?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To this Mons. la Chasse, minister, answered for all, That, thanks to God, the errors of the Nicolaits and Libertines did not concern them; and that if any of their assembly was guilty of sedition or rebellion, they consented that he should be taken and punished according to law, so far were they from countenancing men of such principles; only it was the Magistrates duty to consider, lest they should be imposed upon by slight appearances. And in answer to the three ques∣tions, he said that he acknowledged Francis II. for their only true, lawful King, and their sovereign Prince under God, and the Magistrates of Montpelier for their lawful superiors; and they always thought them∣selves in duty bound to submit their fortunes and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es to the King.</P>
<PB N="219" REF="238"/>
<P>As to their assembly, they did not think that his Majesty had any intention to hinder his subjects to live in a Christian way, according to the pure word of God, nor to rule over their consciences, that right belonging to God only. As to the bearing of arms, he might certify, that, since his return to Montpelier, none of the assembly was guilty of it; and he thought that no body could make with justice any complaint against any of them, of which they would be always very careful.</P>
<P>This answer was followed with the applause of all the congregation, who lifted up their hands, affirm∣ing that they would be always faithful and obedient to God, to the King and the Magistrates. Then one of the deacons desired the Judge, that, to avoid for the future all manner of offence, and not be obnoxious to the calumnies of their enemies, he would be pleased to grant them a church, where he should think proper, that they might meet together at settled times, and where they themselves might come, and be witnesses of all that should be said or done.</P>
<P>To this the Judge answered, that he was mighty well pleased with the respect and submission they did show for his Majesty and his officers; but as to their last petition, far from granting them a church, he forbad them, in the King's name, to assemble any more, since that was contrary to the King's will, as they knew themselves; and if they did not like such a prohibition, they ought to make their address to the King, in order to have their grievances redressed.</P>
<P>While the prelates were disputing concerning the points abovesaid, the ministers deputed by the reformed churches arrived at St. Germain, amongst whom were Augustin Marlorat, Francis de St. Pol. John Raimond Merlin, John Malot, Francis de Morel, Nicholas Folion, Claude de la Boissier, John Virol, Nicholas des Galars, John Bouqui, to whom afterwards was<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 474.</NOTE>
<PB N="220" REF="239"/>adjoined, John de L'Espine, a very learned Domini∣can friar, who had abjured of late the errors of the church of Rome, and made an open profession of the reformed religion. Few days after arrived also Peter Martyr▪ Vermilio, an eminent divine of Zurich, and John de la Tour, who attended the Queen of Navarre. They were lodged together at St. Germain en Laye, near the castle, for their safety, in a house belonging to the Cardinal of Chatillon, and afterwards in that of the Duchess of Ferrara.</P>
<P>The first on their arrival presented a petition to the King, the seventeenth of August, by which they re∣quired four conditions.
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the Bishop should be considered as parties, and not as judges, in the con∣ferences.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That the King should be present with the Privy-Council.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That all the points contro∣verted, should be decided by the word of God.</ITEM>
</LIST> Lastly, that every thing agreeed upon, should be set down in writing by four secretaries, two of each side, who should collate their writings together every day, and these writings should not be reckoned authentical, till they had been signed by the two contending parties. They subjoined to this petition their confession of faith, and both were presented to his Majesty by Augustin Marlorat and Francis de St. Pol.</P>
<P>Theodorus de Beze, minister at Geneva, having been required by the King of Navarre, and the Prince of Conle, to come to the conferences, arrived at St. Germain the twenty-third of August. The next day he preached publickly in the castle, in the Prince's hall, before a numerous audience, without any tumult or scandal.</P>
<P>On the evening of the same day, he was called into the King of Navarre's appartment, where he found the Queen's mother, the King of Navarre, the Prince of Conde, the Cardinals of Bourbon and Lorrain, the Duke of Estampes and the Countess of Crussol; and having paid his respects to the Queen, he ac∣quainted
<PB N="221" REF="240"/>her Majesty with the reasons of his coming, and the desire he had, with all his companions, of serving God and her Majesty, in such an holy and necessary undertaking. The Queen received him very graciously; and answered, that she should be very glad, if the result of their conferences tended to settle a solid peace and quietness in the kingdom. Then the Cardinal of Lorrain said, that he knew M. de Beze by his writings, and exhorted him to seek for peace and concord; adding expressly, that as he had disturbed the kingdom, though absent from it, now his coming might serve to pacify it. To which De Beze replied, that he was too inconsiderable in all re∣spects for being able to disturb the peace of so great a kingdom; beside which, he had never been so wicked as to attempt any such thing, as he had made it ap∣pear sufficiently by his writings, and as he would, with God's help, evince it in the conferences.</P>
<P>De Beze was then examined by the Queen, touching two books he had wrote, and some supposed heretical tenets, advanced in them in relation to the eucharist; but the charges were so gross, and nothing to support them, that the Queen soon dropt her allegations.</P>
<P>De Beze asked him modestly, whether there had not been always a church since the beginning of the world? He answered, Yes. Whether the church had not been always a church under the mediator between God and man? He owned it. Whether Jesus Christ, true God and true man, was not that mediator? To which he agreed. From thence Beze inferred, that the faithful communication of Jesus Christ could not be restrained to the time in which he had really united his godhead with our nature, since what was not existent according to the order of nature, had been always present to the eyes of faith, as to its virtue and efficaciousness; quoting upon this what is said, that Abraham had seen the day of Jesus Christ, and was glad; and St. Paul to the Corinthians, that the ancients did all eat
<PB N="222" REF="241"/>the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink, that is, Jesus Christ; which the Cardi∣nal granted, adding farther what is said in the revela∣tion, of the lamb that has been slain since the founda∣tion of the world.</P>
<P>This gave occasion to De Beze to declare more fully in what consists the difference between the old and new covenant; which failed not to breed another ques∣tion, viz. How these words, <HI>this is my body,</HI> were then to be understood? We cannat agree, says the Cardinal, upon that point, which is nevertheless of great moment. I own it, says De Beze; but though I am sorry that there is no better agreement between us who call ourselves Christians, yet I had rather hear that, than if we were made to believe, that we agree perfectly well on a point on which we disagree so much. Then, says the Cardinal, I teach the children of my diocese to answer, when they are asked, what is the bread of eucharist? that it is the body of Christ. Do you disapprove my method? No, quoth De Beze; for it is the very language of Jesus Christ. But the query is, in what sense must these words be taken, and how the bread is Christ's body? For whatever is some∣thing, it is not always in the same sort what it is. This afforded them occasion of talking of the sacramental locutions. At last De Beze said, that this argument could be reduced under four heads: the first, concern∣ing the signs; the second, concerning the thing signi∣fied; the third, concerning the conjunction of the signs, with the thing signified? the fourth, concerning the par∣ticipation of the signs with the thing signified by them. As to the sign, we do not agree together, because you do not acknowledge any other sign in the Lord's supper, but some accidents; while we keep the substance of bread and wine, according to the nature of the sacraments, and the declarations of the scriptures. No, no, says the Cardinal, and I hope I shall be able to defend transubstantiation: but it would have been better if the divines had not
<PB N="223" REF="242"/>moved that question; and for my part, I am not of opinion that the church should be divided on that account.</P>
<P>As to the second point, says De Beze, we do not say that the merits of the death and passion of Jesus Christ is the only thing signified by the bread and wine, but the true body that has been crucified by us, and the true blood that has been shed for us; in a word, that Jesus Christ himself, true God and true man, is signified by those visible signs to lift our hearts and thoughts to heaven, and behold him there by faith, and be partakers of his riches and treasures in the everlasting life, as truly and certainly as we see with our eyes, take with our hands, eat and drink with our mouths, the visible and corporal signs. To this the Cardinal agreed, and said that he was very glad of hearing such an exposition; for he had been told, that they held other tenets upon the matter.</P>
<P>As to the third point, we own, said De Beze, that there is a vast difference between the common bread and wine, and the bread and wine of the communion; for the common water, the common bread and wine, are but common and natural creatures, such as it has pleased God to create them; but the bread and wine of the Lord's supper are sacraments, that is, visible signs of the precious body and blood of our Lord. But we say, that this mutation, by which natural things become sacraments, does not happen in the substance of things which remain integral, but only in the use, which is quite different from that to which they are naturally destined, for they are naturally created for the body's food; but being made sacraments, they represent our spiritual food. Furthermore, we do not ascribe that sacramental mutation, either to the virtue of some words uttered, or to the intent of him who utters them; but to the virtue and power of Almighty God, whose will and ordinance is testified unto us by his word. Therefore, as the thing signified is offered, and given
<PB N="224" REF="243"/>unto us by our Lord, as truly as the signs of it, we must necessarily acknowledge, that in that respect, and no otherwise, the signs are conjoined with the things signified; and that the body and blood of Jesus Christ, which in that respect are truly given and communi∣cated unto us, are truly present in the eucharist: not that they can be found either under or with, or in the bread and wine, or in any other place besides heaven, into which Jesus Christ is ascended, to be there con∣tained as to his humanity, till he comes to judge the quick and the dead. Upon this the Cardinal having declared, that he insisted not upon the transubstantiation, said, that in truth we ought to seek Jesus Christ in heaven: but all that he said shewed forth, that he un∣derstood not the matter; and he himself owned, that he had spent the greatest part of his time upon other business. De Beze told him, that for certain we do not agree with the Germans upon this third point; but we do agree together, thanks to God, as to the re∣jecting of transubstantiation, and all its consequences; and likewise, in that we own the true communion of the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Do you own then, says the Cardinal, that really and substantially we do partake of the true body and blood of Jesus Christ? That is, answered De Beze, the fourth point I am to speak of. In a word, he said, that naturally we receive with our hands, we eat and drink, the visible signs; and as to the thing signified (the body and blood of Jesus Christ) it is truly and without fraud offered to every one; but it is, and can be received only spiritually, and by faith, not by the hand, or mouth; and nevertheless, this commu∣nication is as certain as what we see with our eyes, and handle with our hands: tho' the mystery of that com∣munication, and virtue of the Holy Ghost, and of faith, be incomprehensible to our understanding.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 480.</NOTE></P>
<P>At this the Cardinal told the Queen, that he took a great delight in hearing what he heard, and was in great
<PB N="225" REF="244"/>hopes that the conference would end happily, if it was managed with such meekness and strength of reason.</P>
<P>Then the Queen and the company withdrew, and the Cardinal said very kindly to De Beze, I am very glad that I have seen you and talked with you; I ad∣jure you in the name of God, that you would confer with me, that I may hear your arguments, and you mine, and you will find that I am not so black as I am represented. De Beze thanked him for his civility, besought him to continue in the same temper, and of∣fered all that was in his power to contribute to such a holy work. After these compliments, the Countess of Crussol, who was very free, said, that paper and ink were requisite, that the Cardinal might sign what he had said and owned; for, says she, to-morrow he will say all the contrary: and she guessed rightly; for the next day the rumour was spread about the court, that the Cardinal had entirely defeated De Beze; which the Constable having told the Queen, while she sat at din∣ner, she answered, that he was ill-informed. However, the sermons began to be more frequent and public in the castle of St. Germain, without any tumult, and there was always a great audience of people of all ranks and quality; which was much inereased by the Queen of Navarre's arrival, who warmly adhered at that time to the reformed religion.</P>
<P>On the 8th of September the ministers presented a second petition to the King, the first not having been answered, desiring the same things they had petitioned for in their former. That petition was tendered to the Queen by De Beze, who spoke for the rest. She granted the ministers, that a deed should be delivered to them of their petition, whenever occasion should re∣quire it; but she told them, that for the present such things were not expedient: besides which they might take her word, that the prelates should not be judges in this case. When the ministers were gone out of the Queen's apartment, twelve divines, Sorbonists, came
<PB N="226" REF="245"/>in to beseech her Majesty, that since the hereties would not acknowledge the prelates for their judges, not to allow them the liberty of disputing; or at least, that the dispute should be only amongst themselves, and not before the King and the Princes: because, said they, it would not redound to their edification. In short, they tried all their endeavours, and left no stone unturned to avoid that conference. But the Queen answered them, that she did nothing in that re∣spect but what had been resolved in the council, after a mature deliberation: so they retired much discontent∣ed. Very likely they dreaded a success like that of the disputation at Berna, in the year 1528, and felt them∣selves too unequal for arguing with the ministers by the scriptures, which they had little studied.</P>
<P>However, the next day being the 9th of September, at the instances of Monluc Bishop of Valence, and Du Val Bishop of Seez, who very cunningly made use of the Cardinal of Lorrain to forward that work, the King, with the Queen-mother, the Duke of Orleans, the Princess Margaret, the Princes of the blood, and the Privy Counsellors, came to Poissy, and at twelve at noon entered a great hall, dressed for that purpose, where he sat upon a throne. There were about forty Bishops and Archbishops, with their divines, and six Cardinals, viz. Bourbon, Tourmon, Chatillon, Lor∣rain, Armagnac, and Guise, besides a great number of nobility, clergy, and gentry.</P>
<P>When the company was sat, every one according to his rank and degree, silence having been commanded, the King opened the conference with the following speech.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I have convened you from different places of my kingdom, to receive your advice upon what my Chancellor shall propound to you. I desire you to put off all passion and partiality, that we may reap from this assembly some good effect, to the quiet of my subjects,
<PB N="227" REF="246"/>the glory of God, and the discharge of your consciences. He told them farther, that they should not stir out from Poissy, till they had settled such good order, by which his subjects might for the future live together in peace and concord; by doing which, they would en∣courage him to keep them under the same protection as the Kings his predecessors."</P>
<P>Then the Chancellor, by the King's command, spoke to this purpose:</P>
<P>"That the King would have spoke more at large, and shewn forth his great affection for religion and govern∣ment, and be more often present to their deliberation, after the example of Constantine the Great, who pre∣sided in the Nicene council, if his tender years could allow it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 483.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>All this while the reformed increased to such a num∣ber all over the kingdom, that tho' the public exercise of their religion was forbidden by the edict of July, nevertheless they could not be restrained from it, and in many places they seized upon temples for that purpose; which gave an occasion to an edict of the 3d of Novem∣ber, by which they were ordered, not only to desist, but to restore those temples, under pain of death: which edict the reformed obeyed every where at the ministers instances.</P>
<P>A few days before that insurrection, a rumour was spread, that the King of Spain, the Pope, and the Catholicks of Germany, had great cor∣respondences in France, and put themselves in a condition to stop the progress of the reformation. The Queen enquired of the Admiral, what forces the re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed of France could raise, and what assistance they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould afford in such a case; and gave him orders un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er-hand to make such an inquest as strict as possible. The Admiral desired the ministers and deputies of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hurches, who were still at Poissy, to write circular <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tters to all the provinces of the kingdom, to require

<PB N="228" REF="251"/>them to send in a roll of all the reformed churches in each province; which having been performed, it was found that their number amounted to above 2150 congregations; in whose name the deputies presented a new petition to the King, beseeching earnestly his Majesty to grant them temples, and offering to serve him at their own charge, if it was requisite.</P>
<P>The edict of Charles IX. about the most effectual means to appease the troubles and seditions, in point of religion, of the month of January 1562, published in the parliament of Paris, on the 6th of March of the said year, was as follows:</P>
<P>"Charles, by the Grace of God, King of France, to all those who these presents shall see, greeting: It is sufficiently known what troubles and seditions have been, and are daily kindled, multiplied, and aug∣mented, in this kingdom, by the malignancy of the times, and the diversity of opinions, which reign in religion; and that whatever remedies our predecessors have tried to put a stop thereunto, either by the rigour and severity of punishments, or by mildness, accord∣ing to their usual and natural benignity and clemency, the thing has penetrated so far into our said kingdom, and in the minds of our subjects of all sexes, estates, qualities, and conditions, that we have found ourselves in a great perplexity at our accession to this crown, to advise and resolve what means we should use to apply good and wholesome remedies thereunto. After long and mature consultation about the same with the Queen, our most honoured and most beloved lady and mother, our most dear and most beloved uncle the King of Navarre, our Lieutenant, representing our person throughout all our kingdoms and territories, and other Princes of our blood, together with our privy council; we caused our said uncle to assemble in our court of parliament, together with the Princes of our blood, the Peers of France, and other Princes and Lords of our said privy council.</P>
<PB N="229" REF="252"/>
<P>"All which, with the members of our said court, after several conferences and deliberations, did resolve on the edict of the month of July last past; whereby we did forbid, among other things, on pain of confis∣cation of body and goods, all public conventicles and assemblies with arms, as well as all private ones, in which any body should preach, or administer the sa∣craments, in any form contrary to the practice observed in the Catholic church, from the first beginning, and ever since the propagation of the Christian faith, re∣ceived by the Kings of France our predecessors, by the Bishops and Prelates, curates, their vicars and deputies; being persuaded at that time, that the pro∣hibition of the said assemblies was the best way, until we could have the determination of a general council, to put a stop to the diversity of the said opinions; and by keeping our subjects by that means in union and concord, to put an end to the troubles and seditions: the which, on the contrary, through the disobedience, obstinacy, and evil intentions of people, the execution of the said edict proving difficult and dangerous, have been much more increased, and cruelly practised, to our great grief and trouble, than they had been before. Therefore, in order to remedy the same, and in con∣sideration that our said edict was only provisional, we have been advised to summon another assembly in this place, composed of our said uncle, the Princes of our blood, and the members of our privy-council; there to advice with a considerable number of our presidents and chief counsellors of our sovereign courts, by us summoned to that end, who are able to give us a faith∣ful account of the state and necessities of their provinces, in relation to the said religion, tumults, and seditions; about such means as may be most proper, useful, and convenient, to appease and put an end to the said seditions.</P>
<P>"Which has been done; and all things having been duly and maturely digested and deliberated in our pre∣sence,
<PB N="230" REF="253"/>and in that of our said lady and mother, by so great and so notable an assembly, we have, by their ad∣vice and mature deliberation, said and ordained, do say and ordain what followeth.</P>

That all those of the new religion, or others, that have taken possession of temples, shall be obliged, after the publication of these presents, to quit and de∣part from the same, as well as from all houses, estates, and revenues, belonging to ecclesiastics, wherever they are situated or seated, leaving them the full and entire possession and enjoyment of the same, to enjoy them with the same liberty and safety they did before their being dispossessed thereof: that they shall return and restore what they have taken off the shrines and orna∣ments of the said temples and churches; and that it shall not be lawful, for those of the said new religion, to take or build any other temples, either within or without the cities, towns, &amp;c. nor to occasion the least trouble, let, or molestation to the said ecclesiasticks, in the enjoyment or gathering of their tythes and re∣venues, and other rights and estates whatever, at pre∣sent, or for the future, which we have inhibited and forbidden them to do, and do by these presents inhibit and forbid; as also to beat down and demolish crosses, images, or the committing other scandalous and sedi∣tious acts, on pain of death, and without the least hope of pardon or remission.</P>
<P N="2">"II. Likewise not to assemble in the said cities, there to preach, either publickly or privately, by day or night.</P>
<P N="3">"III. However, in order to keep our subjects in peace and quietness, until it be God Almighty's plea∣sure to enable us to reunite them, and put them all in the same fold again, which is our earnest desire and chief intention, we have by provision, until the de∣termination of the said general council, or new orders from us, surceased, suspended, and superseded; do surcease, suspend, and supersede the inhibitions and
<PB N="231" REF="254"/>punishments appointed, both in the edict of July, and others that have preceded it, in relation to the assem∣blies that shall be made in the day time, without the said cities, in order to their preaching, praying, and performing other exercises of their religion.</P>
<P N="4">"IV. Forbidding, on the same penalties and pun∣ishments, all judges, magistrates, and other persons, however qualified or distinguished, to hinder, disturb, molest, or fall upon those of the said new religion, in any wise, whenever they shall go, come, and assemble, without the said cities, to exercise their said religion: but on the contrary, in case any persons should at∣tempt to abuse them, we do command our said ma∣gistrates and officers, in order to prevent all troubles and seditions, to hinder the same, and summarily and severely to punish all the seditious, whatever religion professed by them, according to the contents of our said precedent edicts and ordinances, even in that which is made against the said seditious persons, or for the bearing of arms; we will, and expect to have ful∣filled in all points, and to remain in full force and virtue.</P>
<P N="5">"V. Enjoining anew, according to the same, all our said subjects, of what religion, estate, quality, and condition soever, not to make any assemblies what∣ever in arms, or to abuse, reproach, or provoke each other upon the account of religion, or to make, stir, procure, or favour the least sedition; but, on the con∣trary, to live and behave themselves, one towards an∣other, gently and quietly, without making use of pis∣tols, or other fire-arms, either in going to the said as∣semblies, or elsewhere, or any other prohibited or for∣bidden weapons, excepting only swords and daggers for gentlemen, which are the arms they commonly wear.</P>
<P N="6">"VI. Moreover, forbidding the ministers and chiefs of those of the said religion, to receive any persons in their said assemblies, without being first informed of
<PB N="232" REF="255"/>their qualities, lives, and conversation; to the end, that in case they should be condemned for non-appear∣ance, or contempt, upon the account of crimes deser∣ving punishment, they should deliver them into the hands of our officers, to receive a condign punish∣ment.</P>
<P>"N. B. That whenever our said officers shall be wil∣ling to go into the said assemblies, to assist at their sermons, and to hear what doctrine they teach there, they shall be received and respected according to the dignity of their places and offices: and in case it be to take or apprehend any malefactor, that they shall obey, favour, and assist them in the same, as need shall require.</P>
<P N="7">"VII. That they shall make no synods or consisto∣ries, unless with leave, and in presence of one of our said officers; nor likewise any creation of magistrates among themselves, laws, statutes, and ordinances, that belong to us only: but that in case they shall think it necessary to make some regulations among them, for the exercise of their said religion, they shall shew them to our said officers, to have their approba∣tion, provided they be things they ought and can rea∣sonably do; otherwise to give us notice of the same, to obtain our leave, or to know our intentions therein.</P>
<P N="8">"VIII. That they shall list no men, either to strengthen and assist one another, or to offend others; nor make any impositions, gatherings, and raising of money among themselves.</P>
<P>"N. B. And that as to their charities and alms, they shall neither be made by assessments or impositions, but voluntarily.</P>
<P N="9">"IX. Those of the said new religion shall be obliged to keep our political laws, even those that are received in our Catholic church, as to holy-days, days of rest and marriage, for degrees of consanguinity and affinity; in order to avoid all debates and law-suits that might insue, to the ruin of several of the best
<PB N="233" REF="256"/>families of our kingdom, and the dissolving of the bonds of friendship, which are acquired by marriage and alliance among our subjects.</P>
<P N="10">"X. The minister shall be obliged to repair before our officers, to swear to the observance of these pre∣sents, and to promise to preach no doctrine contrary to the pure word of God, according as it is contained in the Nicene creed, and in the canonical books of the Old and New Testament, lest they should fill our sub∣jects with new heresies: forbidding them most express∣ly, and on penalties abovementioned, not to use re∣proachful or scoffing expressions, in their sermons, a∣gainst the mass, and ceremonies received and kept in our said Catholick church; or to go from place to place, there to preach by force, against the will and consent of the lords or curates, vicars, and church∣wardens of parishes.</P>
<P N="11">"XI. In the same manner forbidding all preachers to use, in their sermons or predications, injurious or reproachful expressions against the said ministers or their sectators; by reason that such proceedings have hitherto contributed much more to provoke the people to sedition, than to excite them to devotion.</P>
<P N="12">"XII. And all persons, of what estate, quality, and condition soever, from receiving, concealing, or har∣bouring in their houses, any person accused, prosecuted, or condemned for sedition, under the penalty of 1000 crowns, applicable to the poor; and in case of not be∣ing solvable, on pain of being whipt and banished.</P>
<P N="13">"XIII. Furthermore it is our will and pleasure, that all printers, hawkers, and such as sell defamatory libels and satires, shall be whipt for the first fault of that kind, and lose their lives for the second.</P>
<P N="14">"XIV. And whereas all the effect and observance of this present ordination, which is made for the pre∣servation of the general and universal quiet of our king∣dom, and to prevent all trouble and seditions, depends on the duty, care, and diligence of our officers, we
<PB N="234" REF="257"/>have ordained, and do ordain, that the edicts by us about residence shall be inviolably observed, and the offices of such as shall be wanting therein, declared vacant and forfeited; and they shall neither be restored or kept in the same, either by letters patent or other∣wise.</P>
<P N="15">"XV. That all bailiffs, seneschals, provosts, and other our magistrates and officers, shall be obliged, without bidding or requiring, to repair forthwith to the place where they shall be informed that any mis∣demeanor has been committed; in order to inform, or cause to be informed, any delinquents and malefac∣tors, and to secure their persons, in order to their trial, on pain of forfeiting their places, without hopes of restitution, and of all cost and damages towards the parties; and in the case of sedition, shall punish the seditious, without deferring to an appeal (calling to their assistance such a number of our officers, or famous advocates) according as it is ordered by our edict of July, and in the same manner as if it were by a de∣cree from one of our sovereign courts.</P>
<P N="16">"XVI. Forbidding our dearly beloved and trusty Chancellor, and our beloved and trusty the Masters of Request in ordinary of our palace, keeping the seals of our chanceries, to grant any relief of appeal, and our courts of parliament to relieve them, or otherwise to hinder our said inferior officer from taking cognizance of the same, in case of sedition, by reason of the dan∣gerous consequences thereof; and that it is necessary to proceed with speed against the same, by exemplary punishments.</P>
<P>"Therefore we will and require, by these presents, our beloved and trusty the persons holding our said courts of parliament, bailiffs, seneschals, provosts, or their lieutenants, and all our other justices and officers, and every one of them, as unto them shall appertain, to cause our present ordinance, will, and intention, to be read, published, and registered, kept, preserved,

<P>The reformed were so prodigiously increased in the kingdom since Francis II's death, that they reckoned at this time, as abovesaid, 2150 congregations and up∣wards; amongst which, several there were composed of four, nay eight thousand communicants, especially in the greatest cities; there were no less than twenty thou∣sand at Paris. Nay, Monsieur Languet, in a letter of the 23d day of January 1562, N. S. says possitively, that there were assemblies in that city of forty thousand people, wherein three ministers were obliged to preach at the same time, and upon the same place.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 623.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These churches had been settled in the provinces with more or less difficulties and troubles, according to the genius of the inhabitants, more or less super∣stitious, and their temper more or less stubborn and

<PB N="236" REF="261"/>violent; and as the governors, or their deputies, were more or less meek and peaceable, and more or less de∣pendants of the Guises<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 624.</NOTE></P>
<P>This progress of the reformation would have been much greater, had the King of Navarre better under∣stood his true concerns, and shewn more steadiness in maintaining them: master of all the forces of the king∣dom, as the King's Lieutenant-General, he was able not only to subdue the Lorrain Princes, and frustrate their factious designs, but likewise to right himself of the King of Spain, and oblige him to restore to him the kingdom of Navarre. The courts of Madrid and Rome were very sensible of it, therefore they neglected nothing to dazzle that Prince's eyes, and to break the ties which united him to a party which was his only strength, and on which, after God, he might depend entirely: and I do not know what is more to be won∣dered at, either his connsellors and favourites impu∣dence, in setting forth Sardinia as one of the fortunate islands; or that Prince's ignorance and credulity, in believing whatever these traytors said unto him? How∣ever, that was the sole reason of the Prince's change, and that was precisely the reason why the reformed got not the upper-hand. This is not an invention, but plain matter of fact, grounded upon the testimony of many grave and not suspected historians.</P>
<P>And what is more wonderful, the reformation made those progresses in less than forty-two years, without spilling any other blood but that of its professors, who were courageous enough to defend the truth at the peril of their own lives. We have seen to what degree of fury the persecution was carried against them under Francis I. Henry II. and Francis II. in all the pro∣vinces of the kingdom, without their having ever thought of freeing themselves from that cruel tyranny by any unlawful means, till the plot of Amboise, of which they have been charged, nay, which some Jesuits have
<PB N="237" REF="262"/>endeavoured to render our religion answerable for. But we think we have sufficiently cleared it of that calumnious imputation; shewing forth, first, that the plot was not laid against the King or royal family, but against the usurper of the government: secondly, that the Catholics, as well as the reformed, were engaged in that plot, which is a convincing proof that religion was not concerned in it: thirdly, that though the re∣formed alone should have been concerned, nay, though it should be demonstrated that the plot was laid against the King, the reformed religion could be no more charged with it, than the gospel's doctrine can be charged with the vices and crimes which the Chris∣tians are addicted to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 628.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The edict of January last, which had been thought by the wiser sort of people to be a remedy for healing the diseases of the kingdom, had an effect quite con∣trary, and through the malignant humours, which eat up that political body, it occasioned greater mischiefs.</P>
<P>The execution of this edict moved great difficulties, especially on the part of the Roman Catholics. As to the reformed, though many of them complained of being hard dealt with, because they were ordered to go out of the cities for the performance of their religious worship; nevertheless, their ministers and deputies at Paris, having cleared their doubt as to this and some other points, and wrote to their respective provinces upon that account, they submitted themselves to the King's will<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Laval vol. ii. p. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During these debates, the Queen-mother held some conferences, between Monluc, Bishop of Valence, Duval, Bishop of Seez, Des Despence, Bouthelier, and Picherel, and those of our ministers who are still at court, at the head of whom was Beza.</P>
<P>The following propositions were agreed upon by the Bishops and the divines, that whereas (according to St.
<PB N="238" REF="263"/>Austin) errors were to be plucked out of the minds of men, rather than out of the churches and other places, the Bishops should labour by the means of priests to instruct the people about the right use of images, so as to take off all occasion of offence, the King grant∣ing an edict for that purpose, supported by the church's authority; which, whoever should oppose, would be treated as a disturber of the public peace, and disobe∣dient to his sacred Majesty's laws.</P>
<P>That the images of the most holy Trinity should be taken away, from the churches and other public places, as forbidden by the holy scripture, the councils and the antient fathers; they having been tolerated only by the connivance, or rather carelessness of the Bishops and other pastors. The same was agreed upon with respect to the images of those saints, whose names are not recorded in the martyrologies received by the catholic church, and the images drawn in a lascivious attire, or representing brutes. That no crowns, gar∣lands or garments should be put on them; that no frankincense should be burnt, no tapers lighted before them; that they should not be carried in procession; that no vows or offerings should be made unto them. That they should not be worshipped by bowing to, or kneeling before them, because all these things are parts of adoration. That images ought to be removed from the altars, where the cross only should remain, and to be affixed in the walls of the churches, insomuch, that for the future, they should be out of the people's reach, and not be saluted by them, or otherwise wor∣shipped, either by kneeling or kissing, by vows or of∣ferings. That according to a decree of the provincial council of Sens, their shrines should not be carried about the streets, nor in the churches, as it had been usual heretofore.</P>
<P>Beza, in his own and his colleague's name, shewed himself ready to subscribe to those articles, that about the cross excepted: for, says he, that custom is not of
<PB N="239" REF="264"/>an older date than Constantine the Great, whereas the church had no such use before; and whereas it might prove of a pernicious consequence (as experience sheweth-forth) therefore he could not consent to it.</P>
<P>But Nicholas Maillard, Dean of the college of Di∣vinity, put an end to all manner of conferences upon that point, vigorously opposing what had been con∣cluded concerning the use of images, and strenuously maintaining, that they ought not to abate a title of what the Roman church had once authorized, though he owned many things to have been introduced by evil custom. And so the clergy in Lewis XIV's time, have obstinately adhered to the maxim, that they would never consent to purchase the return of the re∣formed to their communion, at the price of any of the least abuses, tolerated by the Roman church. So the conferences ended the 14th of February, without de∣ciding the matter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. ii. p. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before we proceed any further, let us make some particular remarks on the transactions of the three last months, since the edict was granted on the seventeenth of January, till the coming of the Prince into Orleans, by which we may be able to judge who was the first author of the civil war, either the Prince, or the triumvirate.</P>
<P>I. It cannot be denied that, before the Cardinal of Richelieu's ministry, whenever the crown of France was devolved to a Prince, who was not of age for go∣verning by himself, the general states were convocated for settling the administration of the government du∣ring the King's minority, and that such a settlement ordered by the general states, was looked upon as a standing law, to be in force, and inviolably kept du∣ring the said minority, and till the King was pro∣claimed to be of age, with the usual ceremonies; that is matter of fact, which does not require any further proof. Now because the general states which had been summoned at Orleans by Francis II. had not as yet
<PB N="240" REF="265"/>begun their sessions when he died, after some debates, it was agreed they should open their sessions; but the circumstances of the times obliged the court to adjourn them till May next at Pointoise, so they separated without having done scarce any thing else of moment, besides the ascribing of the regency to the Queen-mother, and the general-lieutenancy of the kingdom to the King of Navarre. But being assembled again according to their adjournment, they agreed upon these four articles.</P>
<P>First, They confirmed the regency to the Queen-mother, and the general-lieutenancy of the kingdom to the King of Navarre.</P>
<P>Secondly, They excluded from the King's council, all Cardinals, Bishops, Abbots, and generally all eccle∣siastical persons, because of their oath to the Pope; two brothers could not be admitted into it; and they excluded likewise those who had enjoyed the superin∣tendency of the finances under the former reign, till they had given an account of their adminstration; and those who received large donations contrary to the ordinances, till they had made restitution of the same. This concerned especially the Cardinal of Lorrain, the Duke of Guise, the Marshal of St. Andrew, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The said estates did reserve to themseves, the power of making war, and arming the King's subjects, during his minority, because to them be∣longed the cognizance of reasons for declaring war, whether they were just or unjust, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As to religion, they ordered that none for his religion's sake should be condemned as sedi∣tious, and a rebel, but it should be lawful for his Majesty's subjects to chuse what of the two religions, the Catholic or the Reformed, they should like the better; all manner of violence, public or private, was strictly forbidden both to the Catholics and the Re∣formed, one against another. And the Governors and
<PB N="241" REF="266"/>Magistrates in the several provinces of the kingdom, were ordered to allow temples to the reformed for their religious worship, whither they might resort freely, and from whence they might come back without any molestation, all edicts heretofore given to the contrary being made void.</P>
<P>That resolution taken at the general states served as a basis to the edict of January, granted by the Notables, that is, by a select number of presidents and counsellors of all the parliaments of the kingdom, besides the King's counsel, and several of the nobility.</P>
<P>But though that very assembly had been summoned by the Guises' advice; nevertheless, as the second and the fourth articles agreed to by the general states (which lieth heavy upon their hearts, more especially the second) could not be repealed, they resolved to revenge them∣selves at any rate, of those whom they looked upon as their enemies, we mean the reformed.</P>
<P>II. It must be acknowledged, that Princes and Ma∣gistrates have a natural right of granting to their sub∣jects, what privileges they think proper for settling peace and tranquillity amongst them (provided those grants be not of such a nature, that they subvert the very fundamental constitution of the government) where it is evident that it cannot be settled by any other method. This being granted, it follows of course, that Charles IX. or his tutors, had a right of granting to his subjects of the reformed religion, the edict of January, unless it should be proved, that such edict subverted the very constitution of the kingdom. But in order to prove, that the said edict was contrary to the fundamental constitution of the government, it is requisite to prove, that the state of religion was the same in France, as to doctrine and worship, in the times of Clovis, as in the times of Francis II. and Charles IX. That the worshipping of images, tran∣substantiation, the communion under one species only, the service in an unknown tongue, Corpus Christi day,
<PB N="242" REF="267"/>purgatory (such as it is believed now in the Roman church) and other such like stuff, that have been im∣posed upon the people, and were as they are now re∣ceived, believed, and practised in France in the six∣teenth century, were likewise received, believed, and practised in France in the fifth century; and made any part of the fundamental constitution of the govern∣ment, insomuch that the Kings of France were bound by their coronation-oath to keep them inviolable. No such thing can be made out. It is true, the Kings of France are obliged to protect the church, and main∣tain the religion which had been derived unto them from Clovis; and we desire no better, than that it please his most Christian Majesty to perform such an engagement: for that end, he is obliged to restore the religion upon the same footing as it was in Clovis's days, and protect those who undertake to restore the church of God into the lustre and splendor which she enjoyed in those days. Now, if any sincere man will be at the trouble of comparing the doctrine, worship and discipline of the reformed, with the doctrine, worship and discipline of the first century, he shall find that they are infinitely more agreeable one with another, especially in the most essential points, than is the doc∣trine, worship and discipline of the Roman church of those days. Therefore, the granting the edict of Ja∣nuary was very agreeable to the fundamental con∣stitution of the realm: it was nothing else but to ap∣prove the Christian religion, as it was taught and pro∣fessed in France, in Clovis's time.</P>
<P>III. Whereas, that edict had been granted by the free consent of the great lords, and most notable men in the kingdom, after full and mature consideration, and without being constrained to do it by any superior force, except that of <HI>salus populi;</HI> it ought to be kept religiously, at least till the King should have been at age, and had maturely and freely debated in his
<PB N="243" REF="268"/>council, whether it was proper to keep it any longer, or to repeal it.</P>
<P>IV. Is not a subject bound to submit himself to the King's edicts, though he has not consented to the framing and publishing of them; nay, though they have been framed and published against his private in∣clination and opinion? Can he infringe them under any pretence soever, without rendering himself guilty of high tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son, and incurring the deserved punishment? Now the Duke of Guife, and the Cardinal of Lorrain his brother, had consented, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, they had advised the Queen to hold the said assembly of the Notables, in hopes that their resolution would turn to their ac∣count, and over-rule that of the general states; but having not a full certainty of succeeding when they left the court, they thought it was prudent to have more than one string for their bow: for tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> end, they en∣tered into a confederacy with foreign Princes, some of them mortal enemies to the kingdom; and having made themselves sure of the King of Navarre, they undertook to deprive the reformed of the benefit of the King's edicts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pag. 56.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On Friday the sixth of February 1562, the Janu∣arian edict was published and registered in the parlia∣ment of Thoulouse, without any great relunctancy; and accordingly the minister Du Nort qualified him∣self, and took the oath before the Magistrate, as pre∣scribed by the edict, and preached without the city; the capitouls and viguier of Thoulouse (they are Ma∣gistrates, whose office answers to that of Alderman and Sheriff, are eight in number, and elected every year) being present. These beginnings were very quiet; then, by the parliament's orders, the assembly was re∣moved to another place, and for teazing the reformed, it was again removed.</P>
<P>But to put a stop to these changes, they built a church at their own charge, large enough to hold eight
<PB N="244" REF="269"/>thousand people; which even was not sufficient, for more than that number were obliged to stand without doors in the church-yard. Whereat the priests, and others concerned in the preservation of the Romish superstitions, were much displeased, and began to tam∣per with the people. They prevailed so far, that the reformed were abused, as they went to, or come back from, their assemblies, and at last they came to blows. To avoid which, the capitouls and viguier thought proper to accompany the ministers with their serjeants and archers to hear the sermons; and there is no doubt, but had the parliament been as well-intentioned as the Magistrates, the tranquillity of the city would have been preserved. But several members of it post∣poning the public good to their private interest, and understanding how the court stood affected, and the practices of the constable, governor of Languedoc, and of the Guises, for bringing the King of Navarre over to their party, instead of providing for the public welfare, used all their endeavours for obstructing the observation of the edict, even so far as to release some seditious, who had been put in prison by the capitouls; and every day those Magistrates were summoned to ap∣pear, either at the parliament house, or at some of the counsellors houses, there to be censured and frightened out of their duty.</P>
<P>The priests, supported by such an authority, waited only for an opportunity of raising a tumult in the city: at last they met with it at the funeral of a reformed woman, who being carried to the grave with a very small attendance, according to her desire, the priests took the corpse in order to bury it after the Roman church's way, and caused the bells to ring in order to raise the people in arms. They were so well obeyed, that the Catholics came from all quarters, and fell upon the reformed wherever they met with them, with stones and swords, wounded many, and killed some of them. The news of this insurrection having been brought
<PB N="245" REF="270"/>before the parliament, they sent two counsellors to in∣quire about the matter, and endeavour by all means to pacify every thing: instead of which, as they were of the seditious party, they kindled anew the fire, which was almost quenched, exhorting that frantic multitude of priests, and rude mob, to kill all the Huguenots, and giving them licence for plundering their houses; telling them further, that the parliament ordered it so. The rabble, incited by those grave senators exhortations, rushed into the houses of the re∣formed, and plundered whatever they could find; whereupon the reformed, frightened, ran in arms to the town-house, imploring the protection and assistance of the capitouls against the violence offered to them. The capitouls sent for the captain of the watch, and ordered him to suppress that fury of the rabble, lest something worse should happen. He being accom∣panied by his satellites, and some students of the uni∣versity, who joined with them, rushed in upon the said rabble, and put them to flight: nevertheless the peo∣ple flocking again from every part of the city, the tumult was renewed, and lasted till night.</P>
<P>The next day, some of the senators met with the capitouls and some counsellors, advocates, and the most considerable amongst the citizens, and consulted together about the properest means of appeasing the tumult, lest it should break out in an open sedition. After some debates they agreed, that the reformed should have the free exercise of their religion in the suburbs, according to the edict; and that the capitouls should be present in their church, with a guard of one hundred men, armed with all sorts of arms, arquebusses and pistols excepted; and for the good behaviour of these men, the reformed should enter caution: that the Catholics should keep likewise two hundred men at their own charge for the city guard, and should enter caution for them: that the priests should be forbidden to ring the alarm-bell for exciting the people to take
<PB N="246" REF="271"/>up arms, and if they did it, and were apprehended, they should be burnt alive: that all soldiers and va∣grants, who had neither domicil or master in the city, should leave it in twenty-four hours: that the capi∣touls, together with the seneschal, should judge, with∣out appeal, of all mann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of sedi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on: that the citizens, war<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by ward, should guard the city-gates.</P>
<P>These articles were wisely agreed upon, and publish∣ed in all the streets, but without effect; for the priests filled up the churches and cloisters with arms and sol∣diers, the Catholic citizens: some presidents and coun∣sellors of the parliament caused gun powder and other ammunition to be brought into the city. On the other hand, the reformed seeing all these military prepara∣tions, and frightened by the massacre lately perpetrated at Cahors, and by the insurrection of the Catholics against them at Castelnau d'Arry, thought proper to put themselves in a posture of defence: b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Catho∣lics (fearing lest the reformed, being once <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sters of the city, would not spare their old superstitious stocks) were grown very audacious aga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nst them, encouraged to it by the example of other cities, especially those two just mentioned; and it happened that the reformed, thro' the imprudence and over hastiness of some a∣mongst them, especially of Barrelles, one of the mini∣sters, hurried themselves along to the greatest cala∣mities.</P>
<P>A few days before, Peter Hunault, Lord of Lanta, one of the capitouls, coming from court, had had a conference with the Prince at Orleans, to whom he had promised to deliver the city at least he was charged with the fact, by letters sent to Montluc, at Faudouas, from Monsieur la Roque des Arts). Mont∣luc, understanding this, sent these letters by an express to Maseural, First President of Thoulouse, with one of his own, whereby he let him know, what orders he had given for the relief of the city, and what they
<PB N="247" REF="272"/>were to do for receiving that relief, and for enabling themselves to withstand their enemies.</P>
<P>The President thought proper to read these letters in full parliament; the contents whereof having been ex∣amined, they decreed to arrest the said Lord of Lanta, who retired to a country-house.</P>
<P>Now the reformed having published, on the 10th of May, a sacrament day for the next Sunday, and Bar∣relles having preached a seditious sermon, the next day three of the capitouls were sent for by the parliament, and ordered to receive in the town-house four compa∣nies of foot; furthermore, to cause all the foreigners of the reformed religion to avoid the city, and to in∣hibit the celebration of the Lord's supper. These things being come to the notice of the reformed, they met to consult together on their present circumstances: but the opinions were divided; the wisest were for re∣maining still and quiet; but others, not considering the consequences, were for making use of violent means: so they parted, without taking unanimously any reso∣lution. But after supper, Barrelles, a courageous and zealous man, but very inconsiderate and hot-headed, and who was not always directed in his doings by the spirit of God, persuaded those of his faction to seize upon the town-house that very night, because their ad∣versaries were to take possession of it next morning. Therefore Captain Saux, having taken upon him the exe∣cution of that enterprise, went thither with several sol∣diers, Gascoons, well armed, and, without any noise, he knocked at the door, which was opened by the capi∣touls, and entered with his men, and taken possession of the same, wherein they found a vast quantity of arms, and several canons: he seized likewise upon three col∣leges in the neighbourhood, without any shedding of blood: then he caused several tons full of earth to be laid down cross the adjacent streets.</P>
<P>The parliament, exasperated at this audaciousness, sent notice of it to Montluc, and to all the nobility of
<PB N="248" REF="273"/>the country, intreating them to send with all speed what troops they could afford; that the town-house, and other strong places in the city, had been seized upon by the Huguenots; that they intended to pro∣claim the Prince of Conde King of France, and to murder all the Catholics, even children of seven years old; that it was full time to oppose their perfidious∣ness, and their barbarous cruelty. They wrote like∣wise to the neighbouring towns, and incited the pea∣sants of the adjacent country, bidding them, in the King's name, to rise in arms, and fall upon all the re∣formed they could meet with, and kill them; then come to Thoulouse to have their share of the spoils. The presidents and counsellors of the parliament, habited in their scarlet gowns, with their arms over, were running thro' the streets like madmen, proclaiming by a trumpet, that they deemed the Huguenots to be enemies to God, and traitors to the King; therefore it was allowed to every one to treat them as such: or∣dering the Catholics to wear a white cross over their coats, that they might be distinguished from the others, and to put the same mark upon the posts of their doors, without which their houses might be exposed to plunder. Mean while the reformed, who had seiz∣ed upon the town-house, stirred not for all these awful proclamations, endeavouring to appease the tumult, and to come to an agreement with their enemies upon some reasonable terms, by the capitoul's means; but no such thing could be done: those of the parliament, who desired no better than to see the utter destruction of the reformed, opposing all ways and means of a reconciliation.</P>
<P>Now, whereas they had proclaimed in the streets, that whoever should kill the Huguenots, or plunder their houses, should not be accountable for it: upon such an encouragement, the furious mob rushed into the houses of the reformed, or those whom they sus∣pected to countenance them, and plundered them;
<PB N="249" REF="274"/>they fell upon them, and murdered, drowned, or otherwise put to death, a great number; and it was deemed a piece of clemency in them, when they were satisfied with casting them into dark dungeons, loaded with irons, after they had been unmercifully beaten.</P>
<P>Those of the reformed, who were in arms, seeing that there was no hopes left of coming to an agree∣ment, raised in haste some works in nine different places of the city, for the guard of the streets, where∣by the enemy must pass to come to the town-house. On the other hand, the Catholics fortified the towers of the churches, and the loftiest houses of the citizens; and whereas they had the greatest number of troops, and several captains of note to command them (they were no less than 8000, reckoning the auxiliaries sent by Montluc) they assaulted frequently the re∣formed at those places wherein they had fortified them∣selves, but they were always worsted. This conflict lasted four days, the reformed never giving place, tho' they were far inferior in number to their enemies; but when they heard of Montluc's coming with more troops, as they were in great want of gun-powder, and other ammunition, and that they expected no assistance, having accepted of the terms proposed to them by their enemies, they resolved to depart the city: accordingly, having left the arms they had found in the town-house, most part of them went out upon a Sunday, the 17th of May, being Whitsuntide, after having received the sacrament. But many were slain upon the roads by the peasants and the gentry, who guarded the passages, and their bodies left to be de∣voured by wolves and dogs: those, who could escape, were received at Montauban, Castres, Lavaur, and Puy-Laurens. It is reckoned by Beza and Dinoth, that four thousand, of both sides, lost their lives in the several skirmishes during these four days; tho' Thuanus
<PB N="250" REF="275"/>reckons but three thousand, besides above two hundred houses burnt to the ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 333.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The famous colloquium of Poissy was held during the minority of Charles IX. by order of Catherine de Medicis, his mother, and regent of the kingdom. Calvin was not present at the colloquium: but Theo∣dorus Beza, who was always much esteemed for his learning, and was a principal disciple of Calvin, well skilled in the tenets embraced by him, and the ar∣guments on which they were best supported, was therefore looked upon as a very proper person to ap∣pear there in behalf of the Protestants, especially as he had before opposed the Cardinal, Charles of Lorrain, Archbishop of Reims.</P>
<P>Beza presented<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bossuet, vol. ii. p. 60.</NOTE>, at this very august assembly, in the name of all the churches, the common confession of faith, which he then likewise undertook the defence of: and having wrote in one of his books, that Jesus Christ was not more in the <HI>Bene</HI> than in the dirt, he explained himself with more decency and propriety; urging, that in respect to the place of residence or pre∣sence of Jesus Christ, considered after his ascension, his body was as far removed from the <HI>Bene,</HI> as heaven is above the earth, which was all intended by his phrase <HI>Caena quam in Coeno.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth national synod of the reformed churches was held at Lyons, in 1563; the first sessions where∣of begun on the 10th of August, Peter Viret, then minister of Lyons, being moderator, wherein nothing material was transacted, besides what concerned the discipline. Censures were decreed against ministers contracting unfitting marriages, either as to the age, or as to the condition, or the morals of the bride: it was ordered, that marriages should be celebrated in the church; and in case one of the parties should be disabled, either by sickness or otherwise, to walk to
<PB N="251" REF="276"/>the church, it was said, that he or she should be car∣ried thither.</P>
<P>Several regulations were made, several cases of con∣science were decided, and several queries about that answered; and whether they were not too severe, or whether they stretched not their authority too far, that I do not take upon me to determine. For example, a man who forsakes his wife afflicted with the leprosy, and marries another, this second marriage is declared void, and the man is excommunicated till he comes again with his first wife, and has done public penance. All promises of marriage, made between parties of a competent age, and with the consent of their parents, are declared indissoluble, tho' the marriage has not been solemnized, nor even the banns published, nay, tho' both parties should unanimously consent to their separation.</P>
<P>The ministers of Geneva, consulted upon that point, were of opinion, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>he promise is sacred and irrevocable; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, even tho' the parents should oppose, the parties con∣cerned are in conscience, and by the laws of God, obliged to go on, notwithstanding these oppositions, &amp;c.</P>

<P>In 1566 great oppositions were made to the establish∣ment of the Inquisition; and the pride, haughtiness, and exceeding cruelties of the Inquisitors, brought matters to almost a general confusion. The cities of Flanders in∣sisted, two or three times, with the Governess, and shewed forth, that what was required of them was quite con∣trary to their privileges and liberties; that the Inquisition had never been admitted, either by the general states, or by the four members; and that they desired that it should be abolished, at least as to the authority which it had usurped over the laymen. Their remonstrances having not the desired effect, they presented another petition; but no greater regard was paid to it, only orders were sent to the Inquisitor at Bruges, not to proceed in his pursuits against the reformed in that city till new orders from the King.</P>
<P>And in this year the reformed of the Low Countries printed again their confession of faith, which they de∣dicated to the King, and made their apology as to the crimes laid to their charge.</P>
<P>The dread of the Inquisition had so much seized upon every one, that the chief nobility made a league between themselves for hindering its establishment. The more zealous Catholics were admitted into it as well as others. That could not be done so secretly, but the Governess had some hint of it; and whereas
<PB N="253" REF="278"/>fame magnifies ordinarily the objects, that Princess was told that the league was already more than fifteen thousand men strong, who were all ready to revenge themselves upon the provinces, if liberty of conscience was not allowed. At this news, the Governess being frightened, she summoned the Knights of the Golden Fleece, and the Stadtholders of the Provinces; and above all she invited, in a very obliging manner, the Prince of Orange and Count of Horn, who had retired from court, to be present at that assembly. Every member voted for <HI>mildness</HI> and for <HI>liberty.</HI> The Go∣verness, who was better acquainted than any body else with her brother Philip's intentions, knew very well that the only way to please him, was to make use of the most violent methods. But what could she do? She was obliged by her circumstances either to yield, or to take up arms; but, in the last case, to whom could she give the command of the army? She mistrust∣ed the Prince of Orange; and the Count of Egmont, being solicited to take that charge upon him, answered, "That he would never fight for the penal laws and the Inquisition."</P>
<P>It was while that assembly was upon deliberating what to do, that the confederates arrived in numbers at Brussels, and presented their petition to the Gover∣ness, whereby they required chiefly, that the Inquisi∣tion's proceedings should be superseded, till the King had answered their petition.</P>
<P>At first the Governess answered in a way too general, wherewith they were not at all satisfied; and at last she was obliged to promise, that the Inquisitors would pro∣ceed for the future with all possible lenity in religious affairs, the cases of tumult and sedition being excepted, and that even in such cases nothing could be done with∣out the court's advice. She promised further, to send their petition to the King, backed with proper repre∣sentations from her, upon the matter.</P>
<PB N="254" REF="279"/>
<P>Whereupon the nobility were more easy, and resol∣ved to separate themselves; but they took proper mea∣sures for securing to themselves the advantages they had procured. They named for that purpose four persons of their body, to whom they trusted the general direc∣tion of their affairs. They named three or four more in each province, who were to give notice of every thing to the Director General, and to execute the orders they should receive from them; and they charged them all with the care of preventing all popular insur∣rections, and of pressing the performance of what had been promised unto them. Lastly, they engaged them∣selves to alter nothing in the government, civil or ec∣clesiastical, till the King had ordered it in the assembly of the states.</P>
<P>Tho' many of the first nobility were in the confede∣rates company, when they presented the said petition to the Governess, that hindered not the Count of Barle∣mont to call them beggars, when, willing to remove the fears which the Governess had of them, he told her, "What do you fear, Madam, from these beg∣gars?" The confederated nobility gloried in that title: it served as a mark of distinction, for animating the party by the resentment of the injury. They caused several medals to be stampt, which they hung on their necks: on one side whereof the King's effigy was to be seen; and on the reverse, was a bag with this motto, "Faithful to the King, even to beggary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. iii. p. 139.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>A new edict against the Lutherans was published at this time, confirming that of the fourteenth of October 1529, with this further clause: That no body should attempt to write or print, or cause to write or print, any new book, upon whatever subject soever, without having obtained letters of licence, upon pain of being pilloried; and besides that of being branded in the forehead with a hot iron, or of having one of his eyes plucked out, or one of his hands cut off, at the dis∣cretion
<PB N="255" REF="280"/>of the judge, who ought to execute that sen∣tence without any delay, and without any mercy.</P>
<P>About the same time nine were taken out of their beds at Amsterdam, and brought to the Hague, where they were beheaded by the Emperor's command, be∣ing suspected of Anabaptism.</P>
<P>What has been before narrated is sufficient to shew the rise and progress of the reformation in France till the year 1566; and as there will be an account of Eng∣land's interesting itself in the cause of the Huguenots, as well before Henry IV. granted the edict of Nantz, on April 30, 1598, as after the revocation thereof on October 22, 1685, frequent opportunities of men∣tioning the most material incidents relating to them, we shall conclude this chapter with an account of the re∣peal of that famous decree.</P>
<P>Lewis XIV. King of France, animated by bigotted and cruel priests and confessors, notwithstanding the most ardent and moving remonstrances that could be made by the friends of Protestantism, repealed the edict of Nantz, and cruelly persecuted the Protestants.</P>
<P>The relation of this matter is briefly cited in Bishop Burnet's history of his own times, and from his own knowledge and observation.</P>
<P>He says, M. de Louvoy, seeing the King resolutely bent upon the suppression of the Protestants, proposed to him a method, which he believed would shorten the work, and do it effectually; which was, to let loose some bodies of dragoons to live upon the Protestants at discretion, and they were put under no other re∣straints but only to avoid rapes, and the killing of them. This was begun in Bearn; and the people were so struck with it, that seeing they were to be eat up first, and if that prevailed not, to be cast into prison till they should change, and being required only to promise that they would reunite themselves to the church, they, overcome with fear, and having no time for consulting together, did universally comply. This did so animate

<PB N="256" REF="283"/>the court, that upon it the same methods were taken in most places of Guienne, Languedoc, and Dauphine, where the greatest number of the Protestants were. A dismal consternation and feebleness ran thro' most of them, so that great numbers yielded; upon which the King published the edict repealing the edict of Nantz, with a kind of manifesto, in which, tho' that edict was declared to be a perpetual irrevocable law, he set forth, that it was only intended to quiet matters, till more effectual ways could be taken for the conversion of heretics. He also promised, that tho' all the public exercises of that religion were now suppressed, yet those of that persuasion, who lived quietly, should not be disturbed on that account. Not only the dragoons, but even all the clergy and bigots of France, were permitted to break out into all the instances of rage and cruelty against them who were not immediately, as the phrase was, of the King's religion.</P>
<P>Men and women, who would not yield, were most cruelly used, stripped of all they had, driven from their habitations, and hunted from place to place. Some of the women were forcibly carried into nunneries; in many of which they were almost starved, and, if not compliable with the rigorous demands of the bigotted priests, were cruelly whipped, and barbarously treated. Some few of the Bishops, and of the secular clergy, drew formularies, importing, that they were resolved to reunite themselves to the Catholic church, and that they renounced the errors of Luther and Calvin. People, in such extremities, are easily induced to put a stretched sense on any words that might give them present re∣lief; so it was said, what harm is it to promise to be united to the Catholic, and the renouncing those mens errors was not renouncing their good and sound doc∣trines? But it was very visible with what intent those subscriptions or promises were asked of them, so their compliance in that matter was a plain equivocation. But how weak and faulty soever they might be in this,
<PB N="257" REF="284"/>it must be acknowledged their trials were very great; and that this was one of the most violent persecutions that can be found in history: in many respects it exceed∣ed all former ones, both respecting the inventions of cruelties, and the continuance of it.</P>
<P>I, says our author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Burnet's History of his own Times, vol. i. p. 658, 659, 660.</NOTE> went over the greatest part of France, while it was in the hottest rage, from Marseilles to Montpelier, and from thence to Lyons, and so to Geneva. I saw and knew so many instances of their injustice and violence, that it exceeded even what could have been well imag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red; for many set their heads to work to invent new methods of cruelty. In all the towns thro' which I passed, I heard the most melan∣choly and affecting relation of those things; but chief∣ly at Valence, where one method of punishment seemed to exceed the cruelties of the Inquisation. One in the streets could discern the new converts, as he passed by them, by a cloudy melancholy dejection that appeared in their looks and deportment: and such that attempt∣ed to make their escape, and were seized (for there were guards and secret agents spread all about the frontier towns, and in the great roads) were, if men, sent to the gallies, and, if women, to monasteries. To compleat this cruelty, orders were given, that such of the new converts, who did not at their death receive the sacraments, should be denied burial, and that their bo∣dies should be exposed to be eaten by dogs or wolves. This was executed with great barbarity, and it gave all people much more horror, than the sufferings that were felt, to the parties. Nevertheless, this cruelty spread like a contagion, and the intendants, and other officers, laying aside the compassion of a Christian, or the com∣mon impressions of humanity, acted as if they seemed to glory in the execution of this severe law.</P>

<HEAD>RICHARD II. <HI>surnamed of</HI> Bourdeaux, A.D. 1377.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Richard II. upon the demise of his grandfather, Edward III. June 21, 1377, succeeded to the throne, he found himself involved in a war with France, and on a precarious footing with Scotland. Nevertheless, the internal peace of the kingdom was uninterrupted till the year 1381<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 93.</NOTE>, when a poll-tax of three groats upon every person above fifteen years of age, imposed by parliament, occasioned an insurrection of upwards of 100,000 plebeians, headed by Wat Tyler, Jack Straw, and others; which however was soon quelled, but not till the insurgents had committed horrid outrages.</P>
<P>A. D. 1382.] His Majesty, having the preceding year contracted marriage with Anne, sister of the Emperor Winceslaus, was induced by his brother in∣law to adopt the cause of Pope Urban VI. against his rival Pope Clement VII. who therefore preached up a crusade against the King of England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 107.</NOTE>, while Urban authorised Henry Spencer, Bishop of Norwich, to un∣dertake a like attempt against Charles VI. of France. That prelate, accordingly, made an expedition into Flanders; but the success was not equal to his martial
<PB N="259" REF="286"/>genius. By that time the King was governed by sy∣cophant ministers: and besides the miscarriage in Flanders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 122—128.</NOTE>, the English lost ground in France, and their arms were unfortunate against Scotland, and in Castile in behalf of the Duke of Lancaster, during whose residence in that country, the French equipped a mighty armament for the invasion of England, but a violent tempest frustrated their intention, in 1386. The King, when that danger was over, still continu∣ing to be guided by his minions, who employed judges to give sanction to their arbitrary proceedings<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 140.</NOTE>, se∣veral noblemen represented the bad tendency of such measures, and perceiving the remonstrances ineffectual, had recourse to arms<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 142.</NOTE>, and defeated Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland, at Radcot-bridge.</P>
<P>A. D. 1388]. After that disaster, Richard complied, in parliament, with the demands of the confederate lords<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 145.</NOTE>; impeachments were exhibited against his mi∣nisters; the judges were banished to Ireland; divers persons of distinction put to death; and Alexander Nevil, Archbishop of York, being one of the obnoxious courtiers, was deprived of his see, but by Pope Urban nominated to that of St. Andrew's; which transla∣tion<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 152.</NOTE>, however, did not take place, as the Scots ac∣knowledged Pope Clement, and Nevil retiring to Flan∣ders, served there a small cure the remainder of his life. Before this parliament (denominated the <HI>merci∣less</HI>) broke up, the King renewed his coronation-oath, and the two houses their homage and fealty. In another parliament convened in October, at Cambridge, there were some regulations made to redress the grievance of going to Rome for benefices. The other remarkable occurrences of this year were<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 157.</NOTE>, the Earl of Arundel's expedition to Brittany, the descent of the Scots upon Ireland and the Isle of Man; and the battle of Otter∣burn,
<PB N="260" REF="287"/>between Henry Piercy, called Hotspur, and the Earl of Douglas.</P>
<P>A. D. 139<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.] The schism of the church still con∣tinuing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 164.</NOTE>, Boniface IX. who had been elected on the death of Urban, sent a nuncio to England to solicit a repeal of the stature of provisors, and other laws against the papal encroachments, as well as for preventing a peace between Richard and Charles of France, who supported Pope Benedict XIII. the successor of Cle∣ment: but the parliament rejected his proposals; and in that which met in January 1393, the famous sta∣tute of <HI>praemunire</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 166.</NOTE> was enacted against all who pur∣chased or solicited in the court of Rome, or else∣where, any translation of Bishops, processes and sen∣tences of excommunication, bulls, instruments, or any thing else to the prejudice of the King, his crown, royalty, or kingdom.</P>
<P>A parliament meeting in the beginning of the year 1395, the Pope's nuncio made another application for a repeal for the statute against provisors, and with the like bad success<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 176.</NOTE>. The Wickliffites also presented a re∣monstrance to that assembly, impeaching the morals and doctrines of the clergy: but the Abp of York, and the Bishop of London, represented them to Richard (then in Ireland) in such a light, that, upon his return, they were exposed to great hardships. Richard, though he had reformed some errors in government, since he assumed the reins into his own hands in 1389, yet his levity and extravagance still afforded cause of murmur; and one Haxey, a clergyman, upon a motion for a subsidy, in the parliament which met in January 1397<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 184.</NOTE>, brought a bill into the house of commons, complaining of the excessive number of prelates, ladies, and idle dependants, maintained at court, and petition∣ing that the charges of the houshold might be re∣trenched. Haxey was tried and condemned by the
<PB N="261" REF="288"/>Lords; but at the intercession of the Bishops his life was spared. In a subsequent parliament, which met in September this year, the clergy were indulged with having a Proctor at such trials where they did not chuse to sit personally<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 191.</NOTE>: and Thomas Arundel, who had been translated from the archi-episcopal chair of York to Canterbury, was convicted of high treason, and condemned to perpetual exile. Richard Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, suffered decapitation for the same crime; of which Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, was also found guilty, but his sen∣tence was changed into confinement in the Isle of Man; and the King's uncle, Thomas Duke of Glou∣cester, who had been lately murdered at Calais, was declared a traitor by this complaisant parliament; which meeting again by adjournment in January 1398, at Shrewsbury<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 197.</NOTE>, reversed the proceedings of the parliament of 1382, annulled some forfeitures made in the two preceding reigns, and delegated the power of transacting business, during their recess, to a committee of eighteen of their own members.</P>
<P>A. D. 1399.] Richard's administration gave such general discontent, that the nation was ripe for revolt; and the King being then in Ireland, Henry of Lan∣caster, Duke of Hereford, who had been arbitrarily banished to France, was invited to head the opposi∣tion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 204—222.</NOTE>. Henry landing, with the deposed Archbishop of Canterbury, and a few others, was in a short time at the head of a numerous army, while the King's troops diminished daily; and having made that Prince captive soon after his arrival from Ireland, convened, in September, a parliament, which dethroned Richard, and acknowledged Lancaster sovereign, by the name of Henry IV.</P>
<PB N="262" REF="289"/>
<P>In the year 1377, King Richard II. called a par∣liament at Westminster, where the laity moved that no officer of the holy church should take pecuniary sums, more or less, of the people for the correction of sins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Church History, p. 115.</NOTE>; but only enjoin them spiritual penance, which would be more pleasing to God, and prositable to the soul of the offender. The clergy stickled hereat; for by this craft they got their gain: but here the King interposed, that prelates should proceed herein as for∣merly, according to the laws of the holy church, and not otherwise.</P>
<P>In this parliament a statute was enacted in favour of the clergy, empowering them to bring actions of trespass against purveyors who should give them dis∣turbance, and entitling them to treble damages; ex∣empting them from indictments and imprisonment, for holding pleas in the spiritual court<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smollet's History of the Church, vol. v. p. 202.</NOTE>; and subjecting to imprisonment, and payment of damages, any mi∣nister of the King, or other person, who should arrest or interrupt a clergyman in the exercise of his function.</P>
<P>In the parliament held at Gloucester in 1378, the Commons complained that many clergymen<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Church History, p. 115.</NOTE>, under the notion of <HI>sylva caedua</HI> (lopwood) took tithes even of timber itself; requesting, that, in such cases, pro∣hibition might be granted to the proceedings of court Christian; but this took no effect. Then the Arch∣bishop of Canterbury inveighed, as bitterly, of the franchises infringed of the abbey-church of Westmin∣ster; wherein Robert de Hanley, Esquire, with a ser∣vant of that church, were both horribly slain therein, at the high altar, even when the priest was singing of mass; and pathetically desired reparation for the same. Complaints were also made against the extortion of Bishops clerks; to which (as to other abuses) some general reformation was promised.</P>

<P>In the next parliament called at Westminster, one of the greatest grievances of the land was redressed, namely, foreigners holding of ecclesiastical benefices; for many Italians had the best livings in England collated on them by the Pope; yea, many great Cardi∣nals, resident at Rome, were possessed of the best pre∣bends and parsonages in the land, who generally farmed out their places to Proctors, their own coun∣trymen; and by this means the wealth of the land leaked out into foreign countries, to the great impo∣verishing of this land. Therefore the King and par∣liament now enacted, that no aliens should hereafter hold any such preferments, nor any send over unto them the revenues of such benefices. About this time, William Courteney succeeded to the see of Can∣terbury, and celebrated the King's marriage, without having the pall from Rome, which he looked upon as a ceremony, that did not at all effect the rights of his metropolitan function.</P>
<P>In 1381, burst forth the dangerous rebellion of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, with thousands of their wicked company, who burnt the Savoy, the Duke of Lancaster's house; from the Savoy they went to the Temple, where they burnt the lawyers lodgings, with their books and writings: also the house of St. John's by Smithfield, they set on fire, which burnt for seven days together. Then came they to the Tower (where the King was lodged) which they entered, and hading there Simon Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lord Chancellor, and Sir Robert Hales, Lord Treasurer, they led th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to the Tower Hill, and there in a most cruel manner struck off their heads, as also of divers others. Neither sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red they the sacred places; for breaking into the church of the Augustin friars, they drew forth thirteen Flemings, and be∣headed them in the open streets, as allo seventeen others out of other churches. They committed outrages afterwards at St. Alban's, cancelling the antient
<PB N="264" REF="291"/>charters of the abbots and monks there. At the same time they were gathered together in Suffolk, to the number of fifty thousand, by the instigation of one John Wraw, a low priest. These destroyed the houses of the lawyers; they beheaded Sir John Ca∣vendish, the Lord Chief Justice of England, and set his head upon the pillory in St. Edmund's Bury. Then Henry Spencer, the valiant Bishop of Norwich, gathered together a great number of armed men, with whom he set upon the rebels, discomfited them, and took John Littester, and their other chieftains, whom he caused also to be executed; and by this means the country was quieted. Jack Straw, John Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by, Alane Tredder, and John Sterling, lost their heads. Wat Tyler, while lifting up his dagger, as if he intended to plunge it in the bosom of his sovereign, was stunned by Sir William Walworth, Lord Mayor of London, by a blow of his mace, and then Sir John Philpot made him tumble from his horse, by thrusting his sword through his body. These had to their chaplain a wicked priest, called John Ball, who counselled them to destroy all the nobility and clergy, so that there should be no Bishop in England but one Archbishop, which should be himself; and that there should not be above two religious persons in one house, and their possessions should be divided among the lay-men; for the which doctrine they held him a prophet; but he was executed at St. Alban's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 97.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On July 13, 1382, the King issued a writ to the Chancellor and Proctors of the University of Oxford, to expel all graduates suspected of favouring Wickliffe's tenets, unless they would purge themselves before the Archbishop of Canterbury. They were likewise or∣dered to search for all books written by Wickliffe or Hereford, and transmit them to the Archbishop with∣out alteration. This order was executed by Doctor Rigge, who was by this time Chancellor, although
<PB N="265" REF="292"/>he himself was supposed to favour Wickliffe: yet no violence was offered to the person of this reformer, who lived unmolested at his living of Lutterworth in Leicestershire, where be soon after this period died of the palsy; nor were the Lollards much troubled in the sequel of this reign, except by some writs for seizing their books, dispersing their conventicles, and impri∣soning their teachers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet's History of the Church, vol. v. p. 204.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1388.] The government seemed now to be more upon its guard against the encroachments of Rome; for the King obliged the Pope's collector to take an oath that he would be true to the King and crown; that he would do nothing detrimental to the royal pre∣rogative or laws of the kingdom; that he would not publish any letters from the Pope, without the per∣mission of the King's council; that he would not ex∣port money or plate from the kingdom, nor introduce any new customs, without the King's knowledge and particular licence. At the same time a writ was directed by the King to the Archbishop of Canterbury, re∣minding him of his duty, to prevent all illegal impo∣sitions on the subjects; informing him of the exactions of Rome; the resolution of the Commons to hold those persons guilty of high treason, who should bring in papal bulls, or levy impositions in favour of the Pope. Writs of the same nature were directed to the other prelates, forbidding them to allow the levy of a tenth, which the Pope imposed upon the clergy; and D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣den the Pope's nuncio was prohibited from collecting it, on pain of forfeiting life and limb. Notwithstand∣ing these precautions, a great number of clergymen ventured to disregard the King's injunctions, and re∣paired to Rome, where they persuaded Pope Boniface IX. who succeeded Urban, to declare against the sta∣tutes of provisors, <HI>quare impedit,</HI> and <HI>premunire:</HI> but the government was so far from repealing those
<PB N="266" REF="293"/>laws, that they were confirmed in parliament; which likewise enacted, that any person within the realm, bringing or sending summons, censure or sentence of excommunication, against any person whatsoever for his assent to or execution of the said statute of provisors, shall be arrested, imprisoned, and forfeit all his lands, tenements, goods and chattels, and incur the penalty of life and member; and any prelate executing such sum∣mons, censure, or sentence of excommunication, shall be deprived of his temporalities; and they shall remain in the King's hands for due redress and correction.</P>
<P>The Archbishops, suffragans, and clergy, protested in general terms against this bill; and this protest brought an impeachment by the Commons on the Archbishop of Canterbury, for obeying the Pope in publishing such censures, as tended to the open dishe∣rison of the crown, the subversion of the royal prero∣gative of the King's laws, and his whole realm; and for aiding and abetting his holiness in a scheme for translating English prelates to foreign sees, to the pre∣judice of the King, the impoverishing of the nation, and contrary to the statutes of the realm. The Arch∣bishop in his defence acquitted himself entirely of the charge, protesting that he would adhere loyally to the King; and endeavour, as in his duty bound, to sup∣port his Majesty in these and all other instances, in which the rights of the crown might be concerned. His answers were extremely agreeable to the Com∣mons; the parliament enacted a new statute of <HI>premu∣nire,</HI> more comprehensive than the former, as it affected not only the procurers, abettors, maintainers and counsellors, but even the favourers of the papal usur∣pation; so that all application to a foreign jurisdiction, either in the court of Rome or elsewhere, in prejudice of the King's crown and royalty, falls within the penalty of this statute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet's History of the Church, vol. v. p. 206.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="267" REF="294"/>
<P>A. D. 1391.] There was a synod in England, which (because many were vexed for causes, which could not be known, at Rome) ordained, that the authority of the Pope should stretch no farther than to the ocean sea; and who so appealed to Rome, besides excom∣munication, should be punished with the loss of all their goods, and with perpetual imprisonment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Church History, p. 117.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Then came the parliament, wherein was enacted the statute, called the statute of <HI>premunire,</HI> which gave such a blow to the church of Rome, that it never re∣covered itself in this land. The statute of Mortmain put the Pope into a sweat, but this put him into a fever: that concerned him only in the abbeys, his dar∣lings; this touched him in his person.</P>
<P>Then were there two bulls sent out by Pope Boni∣face IX. one against the Lollards, another to King Richard II. Queen Anne, wife to King Richard, at the same time had the gospels in English, with four com∣mentators upon the same.</P>
<P>King Richard (on Pope Boniface's translating Eng∣lish Bishops, 1397) wrote a notable letter to that pon∣tiff, wherein he sheweth, that the election of the Pope was not as before, comparing the Popes to the soldiers that crucified Christ; that secular Princes are to bridle the outrages of the Pope; and seemeth to prophecy of the desolation of the Roman Pope.</P>
<P>King Richard was not long after deposed, and bar∣barously murdered at Pomfret castle. In the mean time of the conspiracy against Richard, among all the Bishops, only Thomas Merks Bishop of Carlisle was for him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 118.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus ended the inglorious reign of Richard II. a weak, vain, frivolous, and inconstant Prince; with∣out weight to balance the scales of government; without discernment to chuse a good ministry; without virtue to oppose the measures of evil counsellors, even
<PB N="268" REF="295"/>when they clashed with his own principles and opinion. He was a dupe to flattery, a slave to ostentation, and not more apt to give up his reason to the suggestion of sycophants and vitious ministers, than to sacrifice those ministers to his own safety. He was idle, profuse, and profligate; and though brave by starts, naturally pusillanimous and irresolute. His pride and resent∣ment prompted him to cruelty and breach of faith; while his necessities obliged him to fleece his people, and degrade the dignity of his character and station. Though we find none of his charities on record, all historians agree that he excelled all his predecessors in state and hospitality, and fed a thousand mouths every day from his kitchen. Notwithstanding his dissolute life, he was never accused of incontinence, though he was left a widower in the prime of his youth, and his second wife too young to have her marriage consum∣mated, being but ten years of age, when he was trea∣cherously murdered.</P>

<HEAD>HENRY IV. <HI>surnamed of</HI> Bolingbroke, A. D. 1399.</HEAD>
<P>Amongst the first acts of Henry IV. after his ac∣cession, was the convening of a parliament on October 14, 1399, which enacted several statutes in favour of his own partizans, and repealed divers acts and attain∣ders in the preceding reign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 229.</NOTE>. They made a law against the Pope's bull, which had been obtained to confirm the procedings of the parliament at Shrews∣bury, in 1398: and in that act the Commons de∣clared, that England was independent of all foreign power, and that the Pope had no right to intermeddle in the civil government of the kingdom ‡.</P>
<P>A. D. 1400.] Several noblemen of the first rank, who deemed themselves injured by Lancaster's acces∣sion, formed a scheme, which would have re-established<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 227.</NOTE><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 227.</NOTE>
<PB N="269" REF="296"/>Richard on the throne, and deprived Henry of his royalty: but an accidental discovery, and the activity of the Mayor of Cirencester, rendered it abortive, and the chiefs of the insurgents suffered the death of traitors. The Bishop of Carlisle was tried and con∣victed; but at length obtained a pardon, and died rector of Todenham in Gloucester. This insurrection, in all probability, hastened the tragical end of the de∣posed monarch, as his successor thought his own sway precarious during the life of that Prince.</P>
<P>A new misunderstanding happening with Scotland, Henry marched to Edinburgh, and laid siege to the castle: but abandoned the enterprize, upon advice of a commotion in Wales, headed by Owen Glendourd∣wy (commonly called Glendower) who was maternally descended from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lewellyn ap Griffith, the last Prince of that country; and conceiving himself injured in the issue of a law-suit with Reginald Lord Grey of Ruthyn, had recourse to arms for justice, and gaining some advantages over his antagonist, though that no∣bleman's cause was supported by the English monarch, induced his countrymen to declare him their Prince and Sovereign. Henry, alarmed at the progress of that bold Briton, convened a parliament in the beginning of 1401, which granted him a large subsidy; enacted sanguinary laws against the Lollards; and extended the penalties of the statute of provisors against such bulls from Rome, as dispensed with obedience to the ordinary, pluralities, and non-residence; but with a clause, as to the last article, in favour of chaplains belonging to the court, the universities, or peers. In summer the King entered Wales at the head of a nu∣merous army: but being distressed for provisions, and several of his parties cut off by the Welsh, he was obliged to retreat, after ravaging the country; which Owen retaliated upon the territories of his country∣men who favoured the English interest. His reputation
<PB N="270" REF="297"/>and number of followers increasing with his success, Henry made another expedition against him; and re∣turned with as little effect.</P>
<P>A. D. 1402.] The King had an account of Glen∣dourdwy's having taken and defeated Lord Grey, and Edmund Mottimer Earl of Marche, the lineal heir of the crown. Henry rejoiced at Mortimer's captivity, but interested himself for his favourite Grey; and dreading the progress of the victor, raised a considerable number of forces, which he divided into three bodies, giving the command of one to his eldest son. These divisions entered Wales at three different places, in order to surround Owen: but that brave Welshman baffled not only Henry's military operations, but also the base means he employed to take away his life, and mortified him with a third repulse. This disaster was, however, somewhat alleviated by the success of the English troops under the Earl of Northumberland, his son Henry Hotspur, and other nobles, against the Scots commanded by Archibald Earl of Douglas, who was defeated and taken with several persons of distinction at Holmedon. Henry having demanded the disposal of the prisoners, the Piercies were so provoked at the injustice, that they consulted measures with the Earl of Marche, Glen∣dourdwy, and their captives, to expel their new mo∣narch, and place Mortimer on the throne: but were routed at Shrewsbury, in July 1403, before they could be reinforced by Marche and Glendourdwy, or the Earl of Northumberland, who, though deeply enga∣ged in the conspiracy, got himself acquitted in parlia∣ment, which met in January 1404, and addressed the King to dismiss certain foreigners, revoke grants of the crown-lands, and to retrench the expences of his houshold. Henry dreading a rupture with the French, who connived at the Bretons infesting the English coast, the Duke of Orlean's invasion of Guienne, and favoured the cause of Owen Glendourdwy, convened
<PB N="271" REF="298"/>another parliament (called the <HI>illiterate</HI>) in October, which after a fruitless attempt to seize the revenues of the clergy, granted him a large subsidy, and made wholesome resolutions against alienations of the royal demesnes.</P>
<P>A. D. 1405.] His Majesty, having raised the sup∣plies, sent a powerful army into Wales under his eldest son, who obtained great advantages over Owen: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut by that time a dangerous party was formed against Henry, in favour of Marche, by R. Scrope Arch∣bishop of York, T. Mowbray Earl Marshal, the Earl of Northumberland, and others. The two first, having taken the field, were outwitted and seized by the Earl of Westmoreland, and paid for their temerity with their heads. Upon this disaster, Northumberland and Lord Bardolfe fled to Scotland, and making a fresh at∣tempt about three years afterwards, were routed and slain, at Braham-moor, by Sir T. Rokeby, Sheriff of Yorkshire.</P>
<P>The year 1406 was distinguished by making James Prince of Scotland prisoner, in his passage to France, and for King Henry's narrowly escaping the same fate from the French cruizers, as he was sailing from Kent to Norfolk. In 1407, the King of England, having got rid of a turbulent adversary by the death of the Duke of Orleans, which was effected by the emissaries of the Duke of Burgundy, concluded a treaty with the Bur∣gundians, and a truce with the Bretons. The reduction of Wales was completed, in 1408, by Prince Henry, notwithstanding the brave efforts of Glendourdwy, who preferred the habit of a shepherd to a submission to the English government. In 1409, Henry was successful against the Bretons; and concurred with the council of Pisa in endeavouring to heal the schism of the church. The year 1410 produced a difference between the King and Commons concerning the Lollards; and was memorable for the naval success of the English against the Scots and French. Next year Henry ac∣commodated
<PB N="272" REF="299"/>the Duke of Burgundy with some troops, which were very instrumental in making the Duke master of Paris: but that Prince, upon his ascendancy in the French court, having treated the English auxi∣liaries with indifference, and evading the consumma∣tion of the march stipulated between his daughter and the Prince of Wales, the English Monarch concluded an alliance with the Armagnac faction; which, how∣ever, was rendered abortive by an accommodation be∣tween the Dukes of Burgundy and Orleans, in 14<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.</P>
<P>The situation of affairs then became such, that Eng∣land enjoyed profound tranquillity: but the King was very much disquieted at the profligate courses of the Prince of Wales, his heir apparent; who, however, gave such assurance of amendment, that his father died on March 20, 1413, in the 46th year of his age, easy on that head.</P>
<P>In the second year of his reigh, King Henry IV. ordained, that if any person should obtain, from the Bishop of Rome, any provision to be exempt from obedience, regular or ordinary, or to have any office perpetual in any house of religion, he should incur the points of premunire. He also gave authority unto Bishops and their ordinaries, to imprison and fine all subjects who refuse the oath <HI>cx officio.</HI> In the same par∣liament it was ordained, that all Lollards (that is, those who professed the doctrine which Wickliffe had taught) should be apprehended; and if they should re∣main obstinate, they should be delivered to the Bishop of the diocese, and by him unto the secular magistrate to be burnt. This act was the first in this island for burning in case of religion, and began to be put in execution anno 1401<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Church History, p. 119.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The first on whom this cruel law was hanselled was William Santre, formerly parish priest of St. Marga∣ret in the town of Lyn, but afterwards of St. Osyth in the city of London. It seemeth he had formerly

<P>In the ninth year of the King's reign, the Commons desired of the King, that none presented be received by any ordinary, to have any benefice of any incum∣bent, for any cause of privation, or inhibition, where∣of the process is not founded upon citation made within the realms; and also that such incumbents may remain in all their benefices, until it be proved by due inquest in the court of the King, that the citations, where∣upon such privations and inhibitions are granted, were made within the realm; and if such ordinaries do, or have presented, or others do present, to the contrary, that then they and their procurators, &amp;c. incur the pain contained in the statute against provisors, anno 13 Rich.

Archbishop Arundel, who had before his exile claimed a right of visitation in that illustrious seminary, now renewed his pretensions: but was op∣posed by Richard Courteney, then Chancellor, and other members, as they enjoyed an immunity by a papal bull from all archiepiscopal visitation. At length both parties referred their cause to the arbitration of the King, who decided in favour of the Archbishop: the consequence of which was not favourable to the opinions or persons of the Wickliffites, against whom the parliament also enacted a severe statute, in 1412. This was the last act of persecution in the reign of that Monarch, who was the first Christian King of England<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Church History, p. 122.</NOTE>, that neither erected or endowed any one entire religious house; though he was a great benefac∣tor

<P>Henry V. succeeded to the throne, with all the ad∣vantages, except an undisputed title, that could en∣dear him to the English nation. He totally relinquished those excesses, which had stained the former part of his life; and discarded his profligate companions, but not without admonishing them to amend their conduct, and providing for their future subsistence.

<P>Nevertheless, one Wightlock endeavoured to fo∣ment a rebellion, under pretence that King Richard was still alive; but an early discovery prevented the intended consequences. The next attempt against the public peace was on a religious account. Sir John
<PB N="276" REF="305"/>Oldcastle, Baron of Cobham, had been condemned for heresy by the convocation, but made his escape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 296.</NOTE>; and finding his partisans, the Lollards, exasperated at the proceedings against them, concerted a general in∣surrection; which, however, was suppressed by the vigilance of the King, at the expence of several of the conspirators, who suffered either by the sword or the hands of the common executioner; among which last were Sir Roger Acton, John Browne, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Sir John Beverly, a preacher, with six and thirty others, besides that several were put death in different parts of the kingdom: and Oldcastle, who had not appeared on this occasion, was outlawed and proscribed, and took refuge in Wales.</P>
<P>A. D. 1414.] The King of England, extending his views to the French Monarchy, convened a parliament at Leicester<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 306.</NOTE>, which heartily concurred with him in his designs against France. In that assembly, which enacted a severe statute against the Lollards, and made a motion for seizing the revenues of the clergy, the Commons obtained a confirmation of their privi∣leges: in former times, the rolls of parliament had been frequently vitiated, by inserting the petitions of the Commons in terms quite different from their in∣tended meaning; but upon the humble representation of that body, at this juncture, they were allowed to be a constituent part of the legislature, having been formerly only considered by the King and Lords as petitioners.</P>
<P>A. D. 1415.] During these transactions, the courts of England and France amused each other with nego∣tiations, until the English Monarch, having made the necessary preparations<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 311.</NOTE>, declared his resolution to assert his claim, with sword-in hand, to the crown of France: but when he was ready to embark<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 313.</NOTE>, he re∣ceived notice of a conspiracy formed against him by
<PB N="277" REF="306"/>his cousin Richard Earl of Cambridge (who had mar∣ried Anne, sister of Edmund Mortimer, Earl of Marche) Henry Lord Scrope of Masham, and Sir Thomas Grey of Heton in Northumberland; who being con∣victed, the Earl and Knight were beheaded, but Lord Scrope was drawn, hanged, and quartered. After that, his Majesty landed in August, with about 50,000<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 315.</NOTE> land-forces, near Harfleur, which surrendered in October. Here he had the mortification to find his army much weakened by the dysentery; the enemy convening from all quarters; and the place untenable without a fresh supply of provisions, of which he could have no immediate prospect from England, as he had dismissed part of his transports at his debarking, and the remainder had been d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spersed by tempest. In this situation he resolved to march to Calais; and having left a garrison of 3000 men in Harfleur, began his route towards the Somme, at the head of 20,000 soldiers. When he reached the ford of Blanquetaque, he found the passage obstructed there, and at other places up the river, till he arrived at that between St. Quintin and Peronne, from which the French had withdrawn their detachments, that, after Henry passed, they might engage him in a country, where his retreat was judged impracticable.</P>
<P>The English Monarch, having forded the river, perceived, as he was advancing to Blagney, the whole French army, consisting of 100,000 effective men, in motion, to intercept his route to Calais, the only place where he could expect relief and shelter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid, page 318.</NOTE>. He then began to repent the temerity of his enterprise, and sent a message to the French, offering to restore Harfleur, repair all the damage he had done, and to give security that he should never again invade France, if they would allow him to proceed unmolested to Calais. D'Albret, the Constable, rejected the over∣ture,
<PB N="278" REF="307"/>and haughtily insisted, that Henry and his fol∣lowers should surrender at discretion: and understand∣ing that the King treated the proposal with disdain, sent three heralds to defy him to battle, leaving the time and place to his own choice. Henry replied, that in his then situation he would not seek an en∣gagement; but as he intended to prosecute his march to Calais, they might attack him when and where they thought proper. The enemy then took post between Rousseauville and Agincourt, and nominated the 25th of that month (October) for the day of encounter. As an action was unavoidable, the King of England ac∣cepted the challenge, and during the three days inter∣val, exerted the duties of an able and diligent com∣mander; while the enemy, trusting to their superiority of number, were employed in riot and exultation, and besides playing at dice for their imaginary captives, had the insolence to send a herald to Henry, to know what he proposed to give for his ransom. Early in the morning of the decisive day, the two armies pre∣pared for battle. The French were drawn up in three lines, but were so hampered in their position, that they could not extend their front, and their superiority was an incumbrance instead of an advantage. The Eng∣lish Monarch, that the front of his troops might equal that of the first division of the enemy, formed his army in one line, having placed a small detachment in am∣bush on each wing. The English made the attack with such ardour, that the first line of the enemy was soon discomfited, as was also their second at the next charge. Their third division was still entire, and more numerous than the whole English army: but were so intimidated with the disaster of the other two lines, that they refused to obey their officers, and immediately dispersed, when Henry acquainted them by a herald, that he would massacre them without mercy, if they did not forthwith retire. A false report having spread, that those troops were re-assembled, the King gave
<PB N="279" REF="308"/>orders that all the prisoners, except those of the great∣est distinction, should be immediately slaughtered; and that command was punctually obeyed. In this battle of Agincourt, which lasted from ten in the morning till three in the afternoon, the King of England was several times in imminent danger of his life; in one of which he was rescued by Sir David Gam, and two other Welshmen. The French lost 10,000 men, and the English not above 400.</P>
<P>The year 1416 was distinguished with several nego∣tiations, particularly that with the Duke of Burgundy, the first and most potent peer in France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 330.</NOTE>, and a naval victory over the united fleets of France and Genoa by the King's brother, John Duke of Bedford; who there∣upon obliged the French to abandon the siege of Har∣fleur. The parliament voted the King large supplies; but these, together with the grants from the clergy, not being adequate to his mighty views, he pawned his jewels, crown of state, and valuable effects. Being thus accommodated with money, he equipped a pow∣erful navy, and raised a choice body of forces.</P>
<P>A. D. 1417.] Before the King embarked, he sent the Earl of Huntingdon with a squadron to scour the Channel, where he fell in with nine Genoese ships, in the service of France, of which he sunk three, and brought the like number into Southampton, having on board the French Admiral, and half a year's pay for the whole fleet of France<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 341.</NOTE>. After that, his Majesty took shipping at Portsmouth, and landed, on August, at Beville in Normandy, with 28,000 brave troops; his ally, the Duke of Burgundy, being at that time in the heart of France, at the head of a considerable force. Henry, in the beginning of the year 1419, became master of all Normandy, after it had been 215 years in the possession of France; and received the sub∣mission of the neighbour <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> country as far as the gates
<PB N="280" REF="309"/>of Pontoise, about sixteen miles from Paris.' The Duke of Burgundy had been some time wavering be∣tween motives of self-interest and affection to his coun∣try; but the rapidity of the English arms determined him in favour of his duty, and he proposed an accom∣modation between England and France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 352.</NOTE>. He suc∣ceeded so far, that the two courts agreed to an inter∣view in the neighbourhood of Meulant, in summer 1419: but the conferences terminated abruptly by the intrigues of Burgundy, who had accommodated matters with Charles the Dauphin, whom all the ad∣versaries of the English interest acknowledged Regent of France, during the disorder of Charles VI. his father.</P>
<P>The English Monarch, enraged at being made a dupe to the same policy, which he had before used with the Dauphin and Duke of Burgundy, sent a de∣tachment, on July 28, to surprise Pontoise, and re∣duce some other fortresses in the neighbourhood of Paris<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 358.</NOTE> His affairs, however, had but a very unfa∣vourable aspect: the distractions of France had pre∣vented any opposition against him in the field, since his last descent; but the agreement between the Dau∣phin and Duke of Burgundy united the whole king∣dom against him; his subjects were tired of a war, from which they could reap no benefit; the Dauphin had secured the interest of the Kings of Castile and Ar∣ragon; and a Castilian fleet had orders to transport a body of Scottish troops for the service of the Dauphin. But the gloom which hung over Henry's affairs was dispelled, by the Dauphin's procuring the murder of the Duke of Burgundy, on September 10, at Monte∣reau, whither he had invited him to an interview.</P>
<P>A. D. 1420.] The young Duke, glowing with re∣venge, readily joined with the French Queen in every measure that could distress her son the Dauphin; and
<PB N="281" REF="310"/>concurred with her in mediating the peace, concluded in March at Troye, in which it was stipulated, the King of England should marry Catherine, daughter of Charles the French Monarch; govern the kingdom during the life of that Prince, and at his death succeed to the crown. The nuptials were solemnized in June; and divers places submitted to the English and Bur∣gundian arms: after which Henry, with his father-in-law, made a magnificent entry into Paris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 365.</NOTE>; but had, by that time, lost the affection of the Duke of Burgun∣dy, besides other peers and officers of France, by his own haughty carriage, and the licentiousness of his troops.</P>
<P>In January 1421, he brought his Queen to Eng∣land, where he was crowned next month. During his absence, the Duke of Clarence was defeated and slain at Beaugé, on April 3<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 368.</NOTE>, by the Scottish troops in the service of the Dauphin, who also obtained several other advantages. The English parliament, meeting in May, ratified the treaty of Troye, which had been also confirmed by the states of France; gratified their So∣vereign with a large subsidy for the prosecution of the war, though they remonstrated, that the conquest of France would be the ruin of England; and among other laws, enacted, that no ecclesiastic, appointed to any benefice by the Pope, should be admitted with∣out consent of the patron. The King returning to France, in June, with a fresh army of 30,000 men, obliged the Dauphin to relinquish the sieges he had un∣dertaken, and reduced several places, which acknow∣ledged that Prince's authority.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1422, he became en∣tire master of the strong city of Meaux; and receiving a visit from his Queen, they dined in public at Paris, with the King and Queen of France, on Whitsunday,
<PB N="281" REF="312"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="282" REF="313"/>
with their crowns on their heads<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 373.</NOTE>. In the mean time, the Dauphin took La Charité, opened the passage of the Loire, and afterwards invested Cosne on the same river. As Henry was marching to the relief of that place, he was seized with a dysentery, which put an end to his life, on August 31, in the 34th year of his age, at Bois de Vincennes; from whence his corpse was brought to England, and interred in Westminster-Abbey, where his Queen caused his statue of silver, as big as the life, to be placed upon the monument.</P>
<P>When Henry V ascended the throne, the Lollards expected, at least, a relaxation of the grievances they had suffered under his father. They were miserably mistaken; for though Henry had been a libertine in his youth, yet he was a bigot to the religion in which he had been educated; and relying upon the clergy for their assistance in his designs against France, in∣dulged them in the full possession of their jurisdiction against all deemed heretics. The principal object of the resentment of the ecclesiastics was Sir John Oldcastle,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings against Sir J. Oldcastle.</NOTE> Baron of Cobham, in right of his wife Joan de la Pole: but as he was a person of great esteem with the King, on ac∣count of his bravery and military experience, they would not proceed against him without his Majesty's permission; which was not granted till after he had expostulated with Sir John, and found him inflexible in his sentiments. He was summoned to the ecclesi∣astical-court by repeated citations, and paying no re∣gard to the summons, was excommunicated. He was soon afterwards apprehended, and brought before the Archbishop, who offered to absolve him, if he would recant and move for absolution. Sir John delivered a paper, containing his principles, to the Prelate, who allowed them to be good in the main, but insisted on an explanation of the articles of auricular confession,
<PB N="283" REF="314"/>transubstantiation, &amp;c. which Oldcastle declined<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 296. vol. v. p. 214. Church Hist. p. 124.</NOTE>. He presented also a copy of his tenets to the King, and de∣sired to be tried by the law of arms: but that proposal being rejected, he was committed to the Tower, and advised to prepare his answers to certain queries he had received from the Archbishop by September 27, when the Convocation would sit at the Black-friars. When brought thither, Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, admonished him to crave the benediction of the court: to which he answered, "Curse on your benediction." Even after this indecent reply, the Primate told him, that if he would desire absolution in the common form, he should have it without he∣sitation. To this he made answer, that he would de∣mand no forgiveness where he had given no offence. So saying, he fell upon his knees, and, in an enthusi∣astic rhapsody, confessed all his sins to God, in the hearing of the whole assembly. Being questioned con∣cerning the eucharist, he professed his belief, that, after the consecration, Christ's very body was present in form of bread, the very same individual body that was born of the Virgin Mary. Then he was asked, whe∣ther or not it was the material bread after consecration? and turning to the Archbishop, said, "I believe it is Christ's body in the form of bread. Sir, believe you this?" "Yes, marry, do I" replied the Primate. He was next interrogated, If he thought any part of the bread remained after consecration? To which he replied, It is b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Christ's body and bread. This was the rock upon which he split: for, notwithstanding his explanation supported by texts of scripture, his opinion was declared heretical: and when he challenged the court to prove it so, they appealed to the determina∣tion of the holy church. Sir John, being warmed in his own defence, treated the Doctors with contempt, and would not even allow the church to be holy, since
<PB N="285" REF="316"/><GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/> thereupon passed the decree, importing, that this coun∣cil, representing the Catholic church militant, had re∣ceived, immediately from Jesus Christ, a power, which persons of all conditions, even Popes themselves, were bound to obey in every thing concerning the faith, the extirpation of schism, and reformation of the church. John protested against their proceedings; and they sent ambassadors, inviting him to return: but he insisted on such high terms, that they altered their strain, and summoned him to appear in nine days, on pain of being proceeded against as a fugitive and delinquent. John neglecting the citation, the council suspended him from the exercise of all Papal power, spiritual and temporal; having first convicted him of simony, alienating the goods and possessions of churches and monasteries, of debauching nuns, and incest with his brother's wife, of denying the resurrec∣tion and a future state, and other gross crimes and im∣pious opinions. He was then prisoner to the Emperor, to whom the Duke of Austria had been compelled to deliver him; and when the sentence of suspension was notified to him, he expressed the utmost resignation: but notwithstanding all his submission and intreaties, the council proceeded to the sentence of deposition, and decreed, that neither he, Gregory, nor Benedict, should be mentioned at the ensuing election; which fell upon Otho de Colonna, who assumed the name of Martin V. This council is allo memorable for their proceedings against John Huss<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 107 and 108 of this volume.</NOTE>, Jerome of Prague, and the remains and doctrines of Wickliffe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See. p. 92.</NOTE>; but in matters that merely concerned opinion, and did not af∣fect the power of the clergy, they acted with great in∣difference and carelessness; for upon complaint of a tenet, maintained by John Petit, a Burgundian lawyer, "That each individual had a right to slay a tyrant,
<PB N="286" REF="317"/>even by treachery," the council, after much solicita∣tion, declared it erroneous, without punishing, or even naming the author.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the persecution raged in Eng∣land against the Lollards; of whom, besides those ex∣ecuted for Lord Cobham's conspiracy, mentioned al∣ready, several were burnt, some imprisoned, others recanted (of which three classes, there were divers priests); and many, who for safety quitted their habi∣tations, were subjected to the penalties of excommu∣nication. All this was done after Henry Chicheley succeeded Thomas Arundel in the archbishopric of Canterbury: but though that Prelate was a rigid ene∣my of the Wickliffites, he strenuously opposed the Papal encroachments, which Martin V. strove to ex∣tend as far as any of his predecessors.</P>
<P>In this reign it was determined, in a synod at Lon∣don, that the anniversaries of St. George and St. Dun∣stan should be double feasts in the holy church<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Church History, p. 123.</NOTE>: and at the petition of the Commons, in parliament, to the King, all Irish begging priests, called <HI>Chamberdakyns,</HI> were ordered to depart the kingdom, upon pain of loss of goods, and imprisonment during the royal pleasure.</P>
<P>This King founded the monastery of Shene in Surry, for the Carthusians; and the monastery of Sion in Middlesex, of the order of St. Bridget<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 125 and 127.</NOTE>: and having suppressed the French religious houses in Eng∣land, their revenues were bestowed, by him and his son, upon other monasteries and colleges of learned men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">His Cha∣racter.</NOTE> Henry was tall and slender, with a long neck, an engaging aspect, and limbs of the most elegant turn. He excelled all the youth of that
<PB N="287" REF="318"/>age in agility, and the exercise of arms; was hardy, patient, laborious, and more capable of enduring cold, hunger, and fatigue, than any individual of his army. His valour was such as no danger could startle, and no difficulty oppose: nor was his policy inferior to his courage. He managed the dissensions among his ad∣versaries with such address as spoke him consummate in the arts of the cabinet. He fomented their jealou∣sies, and converted their mutual resentment to his own advantages. He possessed a self-taught genius, that blazed out at once without the aid of instruction or experience; and a fund of natural sagacity that made ample amends for these defects. He was chaste, tem∣perate, modest, and devout, scrupulously just in his administration, and severely exact in the discipline of his army, upon which he knew his glory and success in a great measure depended. But we cannot be so far dazzled with his great qualities, as to overlook the defects in his character. His pride and imperious temper lost him the hearts of the French nobility, and frequently broke out in outrage and abuse. That his disposition was cruel, appears too evident from the massacre of the prisoners at Agincourt; from his be∣haviour to the garrisons of Rouen, Milan, Meaux, and other places, which he found difficult in reducing, as well as from the persecution of the Lollards, who may be considered as so many sacrifices to his interest as well as to his religious bigotry, for thereby he ren∣dered the clergy favourable to his views. All his re∣nown was founded upon the most pernicious ambi∣tion, which swallowed up every principle of justice, and every consideration of humanity. He attacked the kingdom of France without the least provocation; encouraged and bribed the first noblemen there to re∣nounce their allegiance and betray their country; he filled it with widows and orphans, after shedding the blood of 20,000 men, and ruining a still greater num∣ber of families. Yet he died in full conviction of
<PB N="288" REF="319"/>having acted according to the dictates of equity: and those, who are acquainted with the human mind, will conceive how easily conscience is brought over to es∣pouse the cause of any ruling passion.</P>

<HEAD>HENRY VI. <HI>surnamed of</HI> Windsor, A. D. 1422.</HEAD>
<P>Henry VI. was not full nine months old at his ac∣cession to the crown of England, and by the death of his grandfather, on October 21 ensuing, succeeded to the title of King of France: but that event produced a revolution unpropitious to his claim. Many French noblemen, who thought it their duty to obey their late Monarch, without examining narrowly whether or not his conduct was for the advantage of their country, conceived themselves obliged, notwithstanding the treaty of Troye, which was the effect of compulsion, to pay the same obedience to his son the Dauphin, who got himself proclaimed Sovereign of France, by the name of Charles VII. and was crowned at Poitiers in the beginning of November.</P>
<P>The year 1423 began favourably to the English and Burgundians, who reduced several places in the possession of King Charles, routed his forces at Crevent, and finished the conquest of Champagne; but were worsted at Graville. The English ministry had hi∣therto detained James I. of Scotland, supposing, that, while he remained in their custody, his subjects would take no material steps to the prejudice of Eng∣land; but finding that the Scots, in resentment of their Sovereign's captivity, supported Charles with considerable reinforcements, when his fortune was at the lowest ebb, now agreed to set him at liberty, in terms of friendship.</P>
<P>A. D. 1424.] The English arms were attended with various success, until the battle of Verneuil, in August, when they obtained a complete victory over the troops
<PB N="289" REF="320"/>of Charles; whose affairs, in all probability, would have been ruined thereby, if there had not happened a quarrel between the King's uncle, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, and the Duke of Brabant, whose wife Gloucester had married. That dispute, together with the dissensions in the court of England, prevented any military transactions of importance during the year 1425, and gave Charles an opportunity of detaching some of his most considerable adversaries from the English interest.</P>
<P>A. D. 1426.] The war was carried on with various success, nether side having men to undertake any en∣terprise of consequence: but Henry's army being re∣cruited next year with fresh levies from England, and discord reigning among the adherents of Charles, the English subdued a number of places in 1428, and in∣vested Orleans, near which they routed a body of French in an encounter, commonly called "The bat∣tle of Herrings."</P>
<P>In the year 1429, the affairs of Charles took a dif∣ferent turn under the auspices of the famous Joan of Arc<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 412.</NOTE>, a native of Lorrain, but generally stiled "The Maid of Orleans," on account of her surprising ex∣ploits for the relief of that city, which she accomplish∣ed after a siege of seven months. She then charged and routed the English at Patay, recovered many for∣tresses held by them, and witnessed Charles's coronation at Rheims. After that, divers others submitted to him, but he failed in an attempt on Paris; and, in May 1430, lost his friend the Maid of Orleans<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 422.</NOTE>, who was taken in a sally at Compeigne. On December 17, this year, King Henry was crowned at Paris: the Duke of Bedford ordered the Maid of Orleans to be tried for witchcraft; and the court condemning her for heresy, she was burnt at Rouen on May 30, 1431 during which year, the war was carried on in petty ex∣cursions,
<PB N="290" REF="321"/>and stratagems for the surprisal of towns and fortresses.</P>
<P>The year 1432 was distinguished by a continuance of the broils in the court of England, and the renewal of the factions in that of King Charles; but by nothing memorable in the field. In 1433, the peasants in Normandy made an insurrection, which was easily sup∣pressed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 429.</NOTE>. A quarrel happened between the Dukes of Bedford and Burgundy; which, however, did not hinder the latter from assisting in the reduction of some places which submitted to the English. Next year the war degenerated into petty excursions; and the con∣ferences, at Arras, for an accommodation between the Kings of England and France, terminated abruptly. In 1435 the English interest got a severe blow, by an accommodation between King Charles and the Duke of Burgundy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 433.</NOTE>; especially as John Duke of Bedford, Regent of France for his nephew King Henry, died about the same time.</P>
<P>In 1436, Paris submitted to King Charles; the Duke of Burgundy was compelled to relinquish the siege of Calais; the French alliance with Scotland was strengthened by a match between Lewis the Dauphin, and King James's daughter Margaret<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 439.</NOTE>; and the Earl of Northumberland, making an irruption into Scot∣land, was defeated at Poperden. Charles, next year, entered Paris in triumph, amidst the acclamations of the people, who rejoiced to see their native Prince re∣stored to his capital, and fully disposed to forget all the unkindness he had suffered at their hands<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 443.</NOTE>: but their joy was interrupted by a dearth and dreadful in∣fection, which raged to such a degree, that the royal family were obliged to leave the city, which in a little time became so desolate, that the wolves and beasts of prey prowled along the streets, and fed upon the dying

<P>As the English had formerly taken advantage of the divisions in France, Charles VII. resolving to follow the same maxims of policy, and to profit by the quar∣rels that began to divide England, equipped two squadrons, which infested the English coasts, but with∣out attempting any enterprize of moment: and the Scots invaded the northern counties.</P>
<P>A. D. 1457.] A reconciliation was effected between the Queen and the Duke, together with his confede∣rates: but as it was concluded without sincerity on either side, and an indignity being offered to the Earl of Warwick at court in 1458, an open rupture ensued, and the Earl of Salisbury vanquished Henry's forces under Lord Audley, at Bloreheath, on September 23, 1459<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 39.</NOTE>. Then Salisbury joined the Duke of York, who was raising troops in Wales, though without a∣vowing his design upon the crown: but their followers dispersing upon an offer of pardon, they severally shift∣ed for themselves, and were attainted in the parliament, which met in December.</P>
<P>Next year, 1460, the Earl of Marche (son to the Duke of York) landing in Kent, with Salisbury and Warwick, from Calais, entered London in triumph at the head of 40,000 men<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 44.</NOTE>: and understanding that Queen Margaret was advancing from Coventry, to∣wards the capital, Marche and Warwick evacuated the city with 25,000 troops, with which they routed the Queen's army near Northampton, on July 19, and made Henry prisoner. That Monarch was immediately conducted to Northampton, with all the marks of honour and respect, and, after a short stay
<PB N="293" REF="326"/>there, repaired to London, surrounded by a croud of noblemen and others, who had so lately appeared against him in the field of battle. The parliament convening in October 7, the acts of the former against the Duke of York and his adherents were repealed. That Prince, arriving from Ireland, went directly to the house of Lords, and stood for some time under the canopy, expect∣ing to be desired to ascend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 47.</NOTE>: but the whole assembly maintained a profound silence, until Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, asked him, If he had wait∣ed upon the King since his arrival? York replied, That he did not know any person to whom he owed that respect; and retiring to his own house, next day sent a writing to the parliament, containing the grounds of his claim to the crown: which, after some difficulty, was allowed to be read, and the Serjeants and Attorney were ordered to defend their master's title.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Arguments concerning the right of succession to the throne.</NOTE> The three chief arguments in behalf of the possessor were, the resignation of Richard II.; the crown having been sixty years in the house of Lancaster; and that it would be cruel to deprive Henry of royalty after an inoffensive life and reign of near forty years<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 48.</NOTE> The advocates for the lineal succession replied, that the resignation of Richard did not regard the house of Lancaster in par∣ticular, or even the person of Henry IV. but even al∣lowing that to have been the case, a King, who was actually in confinement, and on the point of being de∣posed, had no power to establish a successor; that na∣tural rights were indefeasible, and that no positive law could bring them into proscription; that, as Henry was incapable of governing by himself, any indulgence would only operate in favour of his confort and her ministers, who abused his name and authority, and that, out of tendernerss to him, they ought not to prejudice the whole kingdom, nor commit a flagrant
<PB N="994" REF="327"/>piece of injustice from a motive of charity. These ar∣guments were maintained with great spirit and capacity by each party, until the following compromise was agreed on and reduced to an act of parliament, viz. That although the Duke of York had an uncontestible right to the crown, Henry should enjoy it for life, and that then the sovereignty should devolve on the Duke; but in case Henry should in any shape violate this agreement, the crown should from that moment belong to the said Duke, or his lawful hei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>In the mean time Queen Margaret, who after the battle of Northampton had fied with her son to Dur∣ham, and afterwards retired into Wales, and from thence to Scotland, returned to the north of England, where she raised an army of 18,000 men. The Duke of York marched from London, with about 5000 troops, and engaging her at Wakefield, was there routed and slain on December 30.</P>
<P>A. D. 1461.] The Earl of Marche, far from being dispirited by the defeat and death of his father, resolved to hazard his all in support of his title. He was then in Wales, at the head of 23,000 men, and coming up with a detachment of the Queen's army, on Candlemas∣eve, at Mortimer's cross, totally routed them. This disaster was compensated by a victory obtained by Queen Margaret over the Earl of Warwick at Bar∣nard's-heath, on February 17, when she released her husband, and repaired with him to the north, upon advice, that Marche and Warwick having joined their forces, were on their march to London. The Earl of Marche entered that capital in the beginning of March<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 56.</NOTE>, and on the 5th was proclaimed King by the name of Edward IV. This may be reckoned the end of the reign of the unfortunate Henry VI. though he afterwards, for a short space, re-ascended the throne; of which, and his death, there will be mention in the subsequent part of this work.</P>
<PB N="295" REF="328"/>
<P>Archbishop Chicheley, as already observed, was a strenuous opposer of the encroachments of the Roman pontiff in England. He endeavoured to annul papal exemptions from taxes, and particularly that which Cardinal Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, had obtained in savour of his diocese: and opposed the great power with which the Pope had invested that prelate. He presented to the King a full extract of the nature, extent and mischievous consequences of the legatine office; and as the Cardinal held his bishopric in commendam, remonstrated against the practi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as unprecedented in this kingdom. He repre∣sented that the English church needed no such supple∣mental butresses as the power of legates <HI>a latere;</HI> that the office had been always dangerous to the crown of England, even when limited to one year; and that the danger must be much greater from the Cardinal's commission, which was for life. Henry V. protected Chicheley against the Pope's resentment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 225.</NOTE>: but upon the death of that Monarch, Martin V. poured forth his indignation against the Archbishop in a letter, wherein he accused him of having neglected his pas∣toral care, and minding nothing but the means of amassing wealth. He said that the primate sussered his flock to brouze on poisonous herbs; and that when wolves came to devour them, he stood like a dumb dog without so much as barking. Then he inveighed against the statute of <HI>premunire,</HI> as an act that repealed the laws of God and the church, and destroyed the ancient usages of the kingdom. He complained that Jews, Turks, and infidels of all sorts, were allowed to land in England; whereas any person, commissioned by the holy see, was treated as a common enemy: and he concluded with an order to the Archbishop to repair to the council, and use his interest there, and in the parliament, for the reversal of that statute;
<PB N="296" REF="329"/>otherwise he should incur the penalty of excommuni∣cation. Chicheley sent an apology for his conduct to Rome; notwithstanding which, he was severely re∣primanded, and his legatine power suspended. From this sentence he appealed to a future council; or, if that should not sit, to the tribunal of God. Martin wrote monitory letters to all the clergy in England, expatiating upon the illegality of the acts of provisors and <HI>premunire.</HI> He sent a letter to the two Archbishops, annulling all those statutes, and forbidding the metro∣politans to act upon the authority of such laws, on pain of excommunication; and at the same time wrote a monitory letter to the people of England, which he charged the primate to publish and affix in all public places. The Archbishop of York, with the prelates of London, Durham, and Lincoln, wrote to the Pope in favour of Chicheley: and their example was followed by the University of Oxford, which gave testimony greatly to the honour of the primate's character, and termed him <HI>the golden candlestick of the church of England.</HI> These recommendations were ac∣companied with a submissive epistle of the Archbishop's own writing: but Martin remained implacable, and summoned Chicheley to Rome, as an enemy to the Roman interest in England. The Pope was the more exasperated, as the nuncio, who delivered his letters and bulls, had been imprisoned by the government. This outrage produced letters from Martin to the King, the Duke of Bedford, and the parliament, com∣plaining of such barbarous treatment, and exhorting them to concur in repealing the statutes. When the parliament met, Chicheley, attended by the metropolitan of York, and the prelates of London, St. David's, Fly, Norwich, together with the abbots of Westmin∣ster and Reading, repaired to the house of Commons; and, in an elaborate speech, advised them to repeal the statutes which had given such offence: but the members, supposing his harangue to be the effect of
<PB N="297" REF="330"/>compulsion, paid no regard to his arguments; and joined in an address to the King, desiring his Majesty would write to the Pope for the purgation of the Arch∣bishop. The before-mentioned transactions happened at distant periods; but are here narrated conjunctly to preserve the historical connexion. For the same rea∣son, it must be mentioned that Archbishop Chicheley was famous for a great number of constitutions which he enacted; enjoining the celebration of festivals; regulating the probates of wills by administration; instituting a kind of inquisition against Lollardism; providing against false weights; reviving the constitu∣tion of John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, who decreed that those cases and articles, in which the sentence of the greater excommunication was in∣curred, should be publickly declared in every parish-church for the information of the people; and aug∣menting the stipends of vicars, who were allowed to sue for such augmentations <HI>in forma pauperum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Archbishop, in 1347, founded <HI>All Souls college,</HI> in the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> for a warden and forty fellows: which num∣ber, by statute, was never to be augmented or impaired; and all void places, by death or otherwise, once in a year to be supplied. He also founded another college, in the same University, called <HI>Barnard college,</HI> which was suppressed by Henry VIII. but renewed in 1557, by Sir Thomas White, citizen of London, who gave it the name of <HI>St. John's college.</HI> He bestowed much money in re∣pairing the library of Canterbury, and then replenished it with a choice collection of books. Archbishop Chicheley gave unto his metropolitan church many rich ornaments and valuable jewels; and built a great part of that edifice, denominated <HI>Oxford tower,</HI> belonging to the said church. He founded a goodly college, and an hospital, at Higham Ferrers, in Northamptonshire, the place of his nativity, for eight secular priests, fellows, four clerks, and six choristers. The revenues of this college, at the suppression by Henry VIII. amounted to one hundred and fifty-six pounds. The hospital was for poor people, and likewise liberally endowed. This prelate died about the year 1443.</NOTE></P>
<P>The papal power in England received a mortifying check on the following occasion.—When the crusade against the Hussites in Bohemia was preached up, and

<PB N="300" REF="333"/><GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages" DISP="〈2 pages missing〉"/> this dispute produced a great schism; some acknow∣ledging the authority of the council, and others ad∣hering to the Pope. Several decrees were made to exalt the authority of the council above that of the pontiff: and these, as fast as they were enacted, did Eugenius cancel and annul; affirming that the mem∣bers could not act without the direction of the head. As the Emperor, the King of France, and almost all the Princes of Europe, declared for the council, the Pope was fain to conform, and allow it to proceed: but, when he sent other legates to preside in his name, they refused to receive him in that quality; and this refusal was a new cause of dissension. Eugenius threatened again to dissolve the council; and they, on the other hand, menaced him with a sentence of sus∣pension. At length, however, the pontiff, finding himself unequal to the contest, dropped all opposi∣tion, and confirmed the council. These advances were deemed satisfactory, and the council admitted his le∣gates: but the Emperor Sigismund dying in 1437, and the Greeks declaring for Eugenius, he retracted his condescension, and translated the council to Ferrara. The fathers at Basil, exasperated at this step, filled all Europe with their remonstrances touching the Pope's perfidy: they protested against the assembly at Ferrara, summoned all the prelates to repair to Basil in thirty days, and denounced excommunication against all those who should obstruct their coming. The council was supported by the Germans, Spaniards, and the majority of the Italians. Charles VII. of France con∣voked an assembly of his prelates, in which it was resolved that France should own the authority of the council at Basil, but, at the same time, yield obe∣dience to Eugenius. The English favoured that pon∣tiff, because the council had refused to ratify the treaty of Troye<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 281 of this volume.</NOTE>; and King Henry promised to send de∣legates
<PB N="301" REF="334"/>to the council of Ferrara. Cardinal Julian, the president of the council, and all the other Cardi∣nals, except one, abandoned Basil, and carried along with them a considerable number of Bishops to the Pope's council, which acquired still more reputation and authority from the arrival of the Greek Emperor, with a numerous train of his prelates, at Ferrara; from which Eugenius removed the council to Florence, when it formed a sort of union between the Greek and Latin churches; though this was of very short duration.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the fathers at Basil continued to proceed against Eugenius, whom at length they de∣posed, and chose in his room Amadeus Duke of Savoy, who had resigned the administration of his dominions, and retired to a life of solitude at Ripale. This new pontiff assumed the name of Felix V. and now a double schism was formed between two general coun∣cil and two Popes, who mutually condemned and ex∣communicated one another, and all their adherents. In order to terminate this scandalous contention, an assembly was held in Germany by the Princes and pre∣lates of the Empire, who could find no other expe∣dient for that purpose than the convocation of a new council, till the meeting of which they should remain neuter. This proposal was confirmed by the diet of Frankfort, in 1442; and the council of Basil assented to it, though with great reluctance. Mean while Pope Felix, being discontented at the proceedings of the fathers at Basil, who he thought acted with too high a hand, retired to Lausanne, on pretence that the air of that place was more healthy than that of Basil; and Eugenius translated his council from Florence to Rome, where the session was held in the church of St. John of Lateran. The assembly at Frankfort unanimously resolved, that, if Eugenius should refuse to give them satisfaction with respect to certain grie∣vances, they would acknowledge the election and au∣thority
<PB N="302" REF="335"/>of Felix. Eugenius scrupled at first to com∣ply with their demands: but, the Emperor insinuating that he would lose all the Empire by his non com∣pliance, he condescended to grant all that the Germans desired; and a concordat was ratified accordingly. This was a terrible stroke to the council of Basil, which had been already disowned by Italy, Arragon, and several other countries, besides England and France; though it conceived fresh hopes from the death of its antagonist Eugenius, in 1447, who was succeeded by Nicholas V. Its authority, nevertheless, diminished daily; and Felix retained but a very small number of partisans. The King of France assembling an eccle∣siastical council at Lyons, to deliberate upon measures for terminating the schism, Felix sent thither his lega∣tes, and consented to resign the pontificate on certain conditions. This affair was the subject of a negotiation with Nicholas, who having granted all the demands of his competitor, Felix resigned his dignity with the approbation of his council, which had by that time removed to Lausanne, where, in its last decree (after having continued seventeen years from its first meeting in 1434) it approved the cession of Felix, created him Cardinal and legate <HI>a latere</HI> in Savoy and the Taren∣raise, and allowed him to wear the pontifical habit for life. Nicholas ratified this decree: and thus ended the dispute, which had produced a complication of three schisms; first, between Eugenius and the council of Basil, then between the two general councils, and lastly between the two Popes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During these transactions abroad, John Stafford, successor to Henry Chicheley in the archiepiscopal chair of Canterbury, soon after his elevation having called a convocation, the clergy complained that the act of <HI>premunire</HI> was<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 231.</NOTE>, by the chicanery of the com∣mon lawyers, turned into an engine of oppression,
<PB N="333" REF="336"/>which subjected them to vexatious suits. They there∣fore moved, that either application might be made to parliament for repealing the statutes of <HI>provisor</HI> and <HI>premunire,</HI> or for settling the true sense and mean∣ing so as the clergy might not suffer by the arts of quibbling lawyers. These, however, were deemed, by the majority, points of too delicate a nature for them to discuss, and the motion was laid aside: but the grievance becoming more and more intolerable, the Bishops afterwards took it into consideration; and, after various debates, both houses of convocation re∣solved to address his Majesty, and petition that the clause "or elsewhere"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 260 and 266 of this volume.</NOTE>, in the statute of <HI>premunire</HI> should be expunged. Lawyers, who had a mind to harrass the clergy, used to put such construction upon the words "or elsewhere", as brought them within the statute, even when they prosecuted any matter of ecclesiastical right before the ecclesiastical courts with∣in the kingdom. They therefore observed, that these words "or elsewhere" referred only to the place in which the Pope might chance to preside, and praved that some remedy might be applied to this evil: but the times were too unsettled for them to expect imme∣diate satisfaction.</P>
<P>The zeal of the English clergy, in supporting the Pope against the council, encouraged Nicholas V. to renew the papal encroachments in England. He sent a pompous epistle to the King, together with a con∣secrated rose; and at the same time demanded a tenth of the clergy. His request, however, was denied; and the Archbishop of Canterbury prohibited from executing the Pope's bull, or suffering any money to be collected. In a subsequent convocation, held at London, Nicholas's agent solicited a supply. He expatiated upon the Pope's narrow escape from the wicked attempt of Stephen Porchard; inveighed
<PB N="304" REF="337"/>against the degeneracy of the Roman people; and de∣clared, that, if the English would grant a proper supply, the pontiff would immediately quit Rome and Italy, and reside in some place near England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 233.</NOTE>. All that the English clergy would grant, in consequence of this remonstrance, was a form of prayer for the personal safety of Nicholas. It was about this period that Archbishop Stafford died, and had for his succes∣sor Cardinal John Kemp, metropolitan for York, who dying soon after his translation, was succeeded by Car∣dinal Thomas Bourchier, celebrated for a set of articles of reformation which he composed for his province.</P>
<P>But the most remarkable churchman of that age, was Reginald Peacock Bishop of Chichester, a person of great learning and reputation, who publickly asserted, that the Latin fathers St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, St. Augustin, and St. Gregory, ought to have no greater authority, than the strength of their reasoning, and the merit of their doctrine, acquired<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. v. p. 234, Church History, p. 132.</NOTE>; that matter of faith could be judged by reason alone, to which he likewise referred all controversy; that the Apostles were not the authors of the creed which goes by their name; that the meaning of the holy scriptures was to be learned from natural reason only; that Christ never descended into hell; and that Christians were not obliged to observe the canons, any farther than they should appear agreeable to reason and common sense. He inveighed against the ostentation and mag∣nificence of churchmen; and reproached them for their neglect of parochial duties. He said, they themselves might sit as originals of the deformity they lashed; and that they recommended those qualifications of which they found themselves destitute. His satire against the pride and luxury of the prelates inflamed the populace to such a degree, that they raised violent commotions in different parts of the kingdom. The
<PB N="305" REF="338"/>prelates of Chichester and Salisbury were murdered, and their houses pillaged; those of Litchfield and Norwich were expelled from their habitations; and several other ecclesiastics lost their lives. Bishop Peacock was patronized by William de la Pole Duke of Suffolk, after whose disgrace and death, his books were examined in a synod at Lambeth, and he himself obliged to recant great part of his doctrine. Then he was sent to do penance at Canterbury, where he began to broach the same tenets anew, declaring publickly that the test of the scriptures was reason; that the practice of purchasing preferments from the Pope was unwarrantable; that no person was bound to obey the determination of the Roman church; that the belief of Christ's presence in the eucharist was not necessary to salvation; and that the church may err in points of faith. His relapse was no sooner known, than he was brought from Canterbury to London, that he might undergo a trial, which he prevented by a second recan∣tation. By this submission he saved his life: but lost his bishopric, in lieu of which he was allowed an annual pension, and died soon after in a monastery at Maidstone.</P>
<P>In the first part of this reign divers persons were brought to trouble for their attachment to Lollardism; and mention is made of five priests, and one laymen, being committed to the flames on that account<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Church History, p. 127 &amp; 128.</NOTE>. At that time there was great want of grammar-schools, and great abuse of such as were in London; it being penal for any (to prevent the growth of Wickliffism) to put their children to private teachers. Hence it was, that some others were compelled to go to the same school, where (to use the words of the records) <HI>The masters were waxen rich in money, and the learners poor in learning.</HI> Whereupon the grievance was com∣plained of by four eminent ministers in London, viz. Mess. William Lichfield, parson of All-Hallow's

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="306" REF="340"/>the Great, Gilbert, parson of St. Andrew's in Hol born, John Cote, parson of St. Peter's in Cornhill, and John Neele, master of St. Thomas Acre's (now called Mercers-chapel) and parson of Colechirch. To these it was granted, by the advice of the ordinary or Archbishop of Canterbury, to erect five schools (Mr. Neele having a licence for two) in their respective parishes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Church History, p. 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In this reign, the clergy complained to the King in parliament, that their servants, who came with them to the convocation, were often arrested; and prayed that they might have the same privilege, in that point, as the peers and commons had, when called to parlia∣ment; which was granted accordingly<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Henry VI. in 1441, sounded <HI>King's college,</HI> in the University of Cambridge, for a provost, seventy-fel∣lows and scholars; and erected, in 1446, <HI>Eaton</HI> school or college near Windsor, which he endowed for a provost, eight fellows, and sixty scholars, besides cho∣risters.

<P>There will be frequent occasion to mention Henry in the subsequent part of this work:<NOTE PLACE="inter">His cha∣racter.</NOTE> but in order to preserve the historical thread, and the method hitherto observed, we shall here sub∣join his character, before we proceed to the reign of his successor.—Henry VI. without any princely virtue or qualification, was totally free from cruelty and re∣venge: on the contrary, he could not without reluc∣tance consent to the punishment of those malefactors who were sacrificed to the public safety; and frequently suffered personal indignities of the grossest nature, without discovering the least mark of resentment. He was chaste, pious, compassionate, and charitable, and so inoffensive, that the Bishop, who was his confessor for ten years, declared, in all that time, he had never
<PB N="307" REF="341"/>committed any sin that required penance or rebuke. In a word, he would have adorned a cloister, though he disgraced a crown; and was rather respectable for the want of vice, than for the virtues he possessed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet vol. v. p. 116.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD IV. A. D. 1461.</HEAD>
<P>Edward had not enjoyed his royalty above eight days, when he found himself obliged to march against the indefatigable Queen Margaret, who was at the head of 60,000 men in the north; and though he had not above 49,000 in his own army, he attacked and routed the Lancastrians, at Towton in Yorkshire, on March 29, being Palm-Sunday, when upwards of 36,000 persons fell in the action and pursuit, or were drowned in the river Coc<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 60.</NOTE>. Having made proper regulations for preserving the peace of the northern counties, and leaving a body of troops sufficient to repel any incursions that might be made from some castles in Northumberland, whose owners did not ac∣knowledge his sovereignty, he returned to Westminster; where he was crowned on June 20. He then sum∣moned a parliament, which, meeting on November 4, recognised his title; repealed all the statutes made against the house of York; declared Henry VI. an usurper; rescinded all his acts of royalty as illegal, and attainted that Prince, his Queen, and all their adherents.</P>
<P>After the battle of Towton, Henry and his Queen took refuge in Scotland, and delivered up Berwick to the Scots. After they had been some months there, Margaret, leaving her husband at Edinburgh, made a voyage to France, whence she returned with a few troops, most of whom were cut off or taken in Holy-island; and she herself with difficulty reached Berwick. Nevertheless, she entered Northumberland with a con∣siderable
<PB N="307" REF="342"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="308" REF="343"/>force, and her army was daily increasing, till it was totally routed at Hexham, in April 1463. After this disaster, which rendered the Lancastrian cause despe∣rate, Henry and his consort, with much ado, got safe∣ly back to Scotland: and after residing some time at Edinburgh, Henry set out from thence in disguise for England, in hopes that the northern counties would rise again in his favour; but was taken at Waddington-hall, in Lancashire, where he had lain sometime con∣cealed, and carried to London on horse-back, with his legs tied under the horse's belly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 69.</NOTE>. After the capture of Henry, his Queen and son, afraid of trusting to any person's fidelity, fled for refuge into woods and desarts, where they suffered the extremity of distress, till at length they were rifled by robbers, who would, in all probability, have deprived them of their lives, had they not quarrelled about the booty, and attacking one another, afforded an opportunity for the royal prisoners to make their escape. They had not proceeded far, when they were met by another ruffian, who approach∣ed them with a drawn sword in his hand, and fury in his aspect. On this occasion, Margaret exhibited a remarkable proof of presence of mind and resolution. Taking her son by the hand, and assuming an air of confidence and majesty, "Here, friend," said she, "save my son, the son of the good King Henry." The robber was struck with the dignity and beauty of her person, as well as the nature of her address. He happened to be one of those who had been out-lawed for adhering to her husband. His savage heart was melted with compassion, at the sight of his Queen and Prince in such deplorable distress. He comforted them with the assurances of fidelity and protection, and carefully conducted them to a village near the sea-side, where they embarked for Flanders.</P>
<PB N="309" REF="344"/>
<P>A. D. 1464.] Edward, being thus freed from ap∣prehension of disturbance, exerted all his talents to render himself popular, and acquire the affections of his subjects, who had been alarmed and disgusted by his former acts of severity. He published a general indemnity in favour of all the Lancastrians, who, within a certain specified time, should submit to his government, and take the oath of allegiance. By this astable deportment, he ingratiated himself with all de∣grees of people; the meanest suppliant was admitted to his presence, and every day was distinguished by his acts of compassion and generosity. During this season of peace and good humour, his chief counsellors advised him to convert his thoughts to matrimony: Ed∣ward relished the proposal, and of the three matches named, preferred Bona of Savoy, sister to the Queen of France.</P>
<P>A. D. 1465.] Richard Nevil, Earl of Warwick, who had contribued chiefly to place Edward on the throne, was commissioned to settle the marriage-arti∣cles with Lewis XI. the French Monarch, which he effected: but in the mean time, the King happening to see Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Richard Wideville, and widow of Sir John Grey of Groby, who had been slain in the Lancastrian service, was so captivated with her beauty, and virtue (which he unsuccessfully assailed) that he wedded her, but so privately, that the marriage was not divulged until he thought proper to issue orders for her coronation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 73.</NOTE>. The first families of the kingdom were extremely chagrined at the eleva∣tion of Elizabeth, and the promotion of her kindred: but that, and the disgu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the nation in general, were but trivial circumstances, when compared to the resent∣ment of the Earl of Warwick, who looked upon this clandestine match as the greatest insult and affront that could be offered to his honour, and communicated his
<PB N="310" REF="345"/>sentiments to Lewis; who being equally incensed, did not fail to foment his indignation. Warwick, one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proudest men that ever lived, returned to England in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disposition; which, however, he carefully con∣cealed; and from this very dissimulation Edward di∣vined his thoughts: but, as it was then the interest of both to disguise their real sentiments, the King con∣tinued to treat him with exterior marks of respect; and the Earl maintained his place in the council, un∣til his credit and influence were superseded by the Queen's father, created Earl Rivers, and her other relations. The family of the Widevilles used all their endeavours to render his Lordship unacceptable to the King, who had, indeed, very little reason to confide in his attachment, considering the ingratitude with which his eminent services had been repaid, and had even attempted to debauch his daughter; an insult for which he could never expect forgiveness from a man of Warwick's character.</P>
<P>A. D. 1469.] The Widevilles were become so odi∣ous to the nobility and people, that, for their own safe∣ty, they desired an accommodation with the family of Warwick, which was effected by the mediation of the King: but the reconciliation was so far from being sincere, that soon after the ceremony was over, the Earl repaired to his government at Calais, in order to execute a scheme of revenge he had projected. He knew that George Duke of Clarence, next brother to the King, was incensed against Edward and his ministry, who had excluded him from all advantageous offices, and all share in the administration. In order to en∣gage that Prince in his interest, he offered to him his daughter Isabel in marriage; and Clarence readily em∣bracing an alliance that would put him in possession of one of the richest and most beautiful young ladies in England, the marriage, notwithstanding the endea∣vours of the King to hinder it, was celebrated at Ca∣lais. While Warwick resided there, he seems to have
<PB N="311" REF="346"/>felt the pulse of the English nation, by exciting an insur∣rection in Yorkshire, which was successively headed by Robert Hilyard (commonly called Robin of Reddis∣dale) Sir Henry Nevil, and Sir John Conyers. The insurgents defeated the royal army at Danesmore in Northamptonshire: after which Sir John Conyers, their leader, retired towards Warwick, to wait for the return of the Earl from Calais, by whose direction he had hitherto proceeded. Whether Edward was igno∣rant of this connexion, or thought proper to tempo∣rize, certain it is, that when Warwick, and his son-in-law Clarence, arrived in England, and offered their assistance towards re-establishing the tranquillity of the kingdom, he received them with an appearance of sa∣tisfaction, conferring several offices on Warwick. The King was likewise pleased to grant a general pardon to Conyers and his followers, by that time increased to 60,000.</P>
<P>A. D. 1470.] Whatever were his Majesty's senti∣ments towards Warwick, he seems to have been de∣termined upon making a friend of his brother, John Lord Montague; probably with a view to lessen the Earl's formidable power. He proposed a match be∣tween his own daughter Elizabeth, and Montague's son George, whom he created Duke of Bedford on January 5. Such a testimony of the royal favour could not but be agreeable to the Nevils, who began again to live in a friendly correspondence with Edward, un∣til it was interrupted by an artifice of the ministry, who dreaded the revival of that family's interest. The King, while he resided at Langley in Hertfordshire, was in∣vited by George, Archbishop of York, Warwick's brother, to an entertainment, at his seat of Morepark, in that neighbourhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 91.</NOTE>; and while the guests were employed, according to the custom of the time, in washing hands before supper, John Ratcliffe, after∣wards
<PB N="312" REF="347"/>Lord Fitzwalter, told the King privately, that the Archbishop had assembled an hundred men at arms, to seize and convey his Majesty to the castle of Middle∣ham in Yorkshire. Edward, alarmed at the intelli∣gence, which was feigned for the purpose, made a pretence to go out, and mounting his horse, rode at full speed to Windsor. Such an abrupt retreat was construed into a gross affront by the Archbishop, as well as by Warwick and Clarence, who imagined it was a concerted scheme, to tax them and their adhe∣rents with perfidy; and both sides reproached each other with great acrimony.</P>
<P>An accommodation was attempted by the Duchess of York, the King's mother; but their mutual jea∣lousy was too deeply fixed to be easily eradicated. Nevertheless, Edward impowered Clarence and War∣wick to array men in Warwickshire and Gloucester∣shire, in order to suppress an insurrection in the county of Lincoln, headed by Robert Willes, Sir Thomas Dymock, and Sir Thomas de la Launde; though it afterwards appeared, that they had instigated the leaders to raise that commotion: after the suppres∣sion of which, by a decisive victory which the King obtained at Stamford, on March 14, his Majesty summoned Clarence and Warwick to appear before him by the 28th, on pain of being denounced rebels and traitors. The two chiefs paid no regard to this citation: they had endeavoured to excite a rebellion in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Devonshire; but their in∣tention being frustrated by the vigilance of the King, they embarked at Dartmouth for France.</P>
<P>Lewis XI. who was inflamed against Edward for the affair of the marriage, and a league lately concluded with the Duke of Burgundy, animated Warwick in his design of restoring Henry VI. to the throne of Eng∣land. For that end, he effected a reconciliation be∣tween Queen Margaret and the Earl, notwithstanding
<PB N="313" REF="348"/>their former inveteracy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 96.</NOTE>; and one article of the agree∣ment being a marriage between Anne, his younger daughter, and the Queen's son, Prince Edward, War∣wick became equally allied to the houses of York and Lancaster.</P>
<P>Clarence and Warwick, having received a small supply of money and troops from Lewis, set sail from Havre de Grace, under a French convoy, and landed at Dartmouth, in September: but Clarence had been, during his residence in France, brought over to his brother's interest. They found themselves, in a few days, at the head of 60,000 fighting men, with whom they began their march against Edward, who had made a progress into Yorkshire, to quell an insurrec∣tion raised there by the Lord Fitzhugh, married to Alice, Warwick's sister. The King, upon the infor∣mation of the landing of Warwick, returned to Not∣tingham, in his way to London; but the Earl, being resolved to engage him before he should reach that capital, came in sight of him within three miles of Nottingham: and Edward, discouraged by the defec∣tion of Montague, with 6000 troops, to the Lancas∣trians, set out at midnight for Lynne, where he em∣barked with his brother, Richard Duke of Gloucester, for Holland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 100.</NOTE>. Next morning his army submitted to Warwick, who forthwith directed his march for Lon∣don, which he entered-in triumph, on October 6, and set at liberty Henry VI. whom he had insulted in the most opprobious terms, and even instigated the mob to deride, when leading captive from Lancashire, 1463.</P>
<P>In consequence of this surprising revolution, a thorough change ensued in every branch of the admi∣nistration: and a parliament meeting on November 26, Edward was declared a traitor and usurper; all statutes made by his authority repealed, and all his ad∣herents
<PB N="314" REF="349"/>attainted. The crown was settled upon Henry and the male issue of his body; and in default thereof, on the Duke of Clarence and his descendants: and that Duke, and the Earl of Warwick, were constituted Regents, during the minority of Prince Edward, Henry's son.</P>
<P>A. D. 1471.] During these transactions in England, the fugitive King Edward, after some stay at the Hague, repaired to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Burgundy; who, after much sollicitation, was prevail∣ed upon to accommodate him underhand with ships and money. Thus supplied, he embarked with about 1500 followers, and attemted to land in Essex. Be∣ing repulsed there, he sailed to the north, and made a descent at Ravenspur in Yorkshire, about the latter end of March; hoping to be joined by the people of those parts, as soon as he should produce the Earl of Northumberland's invitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 105.</NOTE>. However, he met with a very cold reception; and the inhabitants of Holderness took up arms to stop his progress. He likewise understood by his emissaries, that the citizens of York were not at all disposed to receive him as So∣vereign of England. He therefore professed himself a liegeman to King Henry; and declared, that all he demanded was the duchy of his father. Trusting to the effect of these professions, and the affection of the people of York, he marched towards that city, and was visited by a deputation of the aldermen, who de∣sired that he would chuse another road, that they might not be under the necessity of refusing him ad∣mittance. He again repeated his former declaration touching his demand; and expostulated with them, in a modest manner, upon the cruelty of denying him access to the city from which he derived his title, and on which he had conferred so many benefits: but he depended more on the attachment of the inhabitants
<PB N="315" REF="350"/>than the power of his eloquence; and was not disap∣pointed in his expectation. His partisans excited a commotion in the city; and the magistrates went forth to offer him the keys, and stipulate for their being ex∣empted from pillage. Edward agreed to all their pro∣posals; and being admitted into York, he alighted at the cathedral, where, by a solemn oath, he confirmed his former protestations, that he would remain a loyal subject to Henry; and with respect to his demand, concerning his private inheritance, leave it entirely to the decision of parliament. He saw his forces encrease daily, and borrowed money from the citizens for their subsistence; till at length, when he had assembled a body of troops, he left a strong garrison in the place, and began his march for London.</P>
<P>When he arrived at Nottingham, his numbers en∣creased to such a degree, as encouraged him to publish his claim to the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 106.</NOTE>. Mean while Warwick, having levied a body of troops, advanced to Leicester, in or∣der to join his brother Montague, who was at the head of a considerable force, but had allowed Edward to pass by him unmolested; and receiving intelligence that Edward had taken the route to Coventry, march∣ed thither, with a view to hazard an engagement. When the two armies were in sight of each other, the Earl received a letter from Clarence, advising him that he was on his march to join him, and desiring him to decline battle till their junction; and in compliance therewith allowed his antagonist to proceed to Lon∣don, believing that city would hold out until he should advance to its relief. This was a flagrant piece of mis∣conduct; for the rich merchants there, who had lent Edward great sums, had no other prospect of payment than by his restoration; the interest of the ladies was in favour of that Prince; the Archbishop of Canter∣bury, with several noblemen and other prelates, were
<PB N="316" REF="351"/>well-wishers to his cause; and the sanctuaries and franchises of London and Westminster contained above 2000 partisans of the house of York. Besides, War∣wick's brother, the Primate of York, to whose care the person of Henry and the city of London were com∣mitted, had made his peace with Edward, who, by his connivance, was admitted into the city, and seized Henry in the palace of the Bishop of London.</P>
<P>In the mean time Warwick, being reinforced by Clarence his son-in-law, and his own brother Monta∣gue, advanced towards the capital, and, on April 13, encamped on Barnet heath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 108.</NOTE>, that town being possessed by the troops of Edward, who had marched thither from London, to give him battle, in consequence of a message sent him by Clarence, who promised to join him with all his forces, and that very night, receiving a visit from Gloucester, went off with about 12,000 troops to the Yorkists quarters, from whence he sent a message to Warwick, excusing his own conduct, and acquainting him that he had made his peace with Edward. The Earl received the message with disdain; and early in the morning of the 14th, being Easter-day, both armies came to action. Victory seemed at first to incline to the Lancastrians: but when the Earl of Ox∣ford was returning from the pursuit of the first line of the Yorkists, Warwick's followers, mistaking, thro' the medium of a thick fog, the radiant star on Oxford's standard for the cognizance of Edward, which was a sun, fell upon their friends with such fury, that they were broken and dispersed before their leaders could rectify the fatal error. Other parts of the Lancastrian army, seeing them fly, were seized with consternation, and universal confusion ensued. Edward, taking ad∣vantage of their disorder, charged them with redoubled vigour; and Warwick endeavoured to rally and reani∣mate them by his own example. This Earl (usually
<PB N="317" REF="352"/>stiled <HI>the King-maker</HI>) after having exerted all his ca∣pacity as an officer and hero, in fruitless attempts, rushed into the hottest part of the action, and fell covered with wounds, as did his brother Montague endeavouring to disengage him. All opposition ended with the lives of these two noblemen: and about noon the Yorkists, with the loss of about 1500 of their friends, obtained a complete victory over their enemies, of whom 5000 were left dead upon the field.</P>
<P>Edward had not long time to enjoy the fruits of his advantage, before he was alarmed with the tidings of Queen Margaret's having landed at Weymouth, on Easter-day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v, p. III.</NOTE>. The news of Warwick's death, and the imprisonment of her husband, so dejected her, that she took refuge with her son in Beaulieu-abbey in Hampshire. Her spirits, however, revived, when she saw herself joined by a considerable number of nobi∣lity and gentlemen, with their vassals and adherents; and with them advanced to Tewkesbury. Edward came up with them so suddenly, that on May 4, be∣fore she could pass the Severn in order to march into Wales, where there was a large body in arms for Henry, he attacked and routed her army intrenched in a park adjoining to the town. Prince Edward was basely assassinated after the battle; and his mother, Queen Margaret, being found on the field in a waggon, more dead than alive, was sent prisoner to the Tower, where she remained about four years, until the King of France paid 50,000 crowns for her ransom.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Henry VI. survived these commo∣tions but a short time, being found dead in the Tower on May 21, in the 51st year of his age; and his death is generally ascribed to Richard Duke of Gloucester.</P>
<P>A. D. 1475.] The tranquillity of England being re-established, Edward revived the old pretensions to the French monarchy; and having concluded divers
<PB N="318" REF="353"/>treaties with the Dukes of Burgundy and Brittany, landed with an army at Calais about the end of June<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 122 &amp; 125.</NOTE>. On his arrival there, he sent an herald to summon Lewis XI. to deliver up the crown and kingdom of France; and, in case of a refusal, to denounce war and vengeance. The French King, having heard the herald's message without emotion, replied, that Edward had taken this violent step at the instigation of the Duke of Burgundy and the Constable de St. Pol, and would be deceived by both these allies. The event verified the prediction, for the allies performed no part of their engagements; and the King of England, perceiving himself a dupe to their interests, made a separate peace with Lewis; after which the two Monarchs had an interview on the bridge of Pequigny.</P>
<P>A. D. 1478.] Edward, being at peace with all his neighbours, had become indolent and avaricious; and the administration was wholly engrossed by the Queen and her relations, who rendered themselves odious to the nation, not only by their insatiable thirst of power, but also by their insolent demeanor, and the pride they seemed to take in slighting and thwarting the schemes of the King's brothers, George Duke of Clarence and Richard Duke of Gloucester. The latter, who was naturally close and considerate, dissembled his resentment so as to prevent an open rupture: but Clarence could not suppress his discontent, which was fomented by the cunning insinuations of Gloucester, who had already formed a design upon the crown, which he could not well accomplish so long as Clarence stood between him and the succession. Richard there∣fore resolved to effect his ruin, and artfully exasperating the resentment of Clarence against the King, until he uttered some rash menaces and imprecations, repeated them to Edward with exaggerations, on pretence of cautioning him against the other's treasonable designs.
<PB N="319" REF="354"/>The Queen and her kindred reinforced the suggestions of Gloucester in such a manner, that his Majesty con∣ceived a real suspicion and disgust against Clarence: and this Prince, incensed at his treatment, became louder in his complaints against the ministry, who resolved to accomplish his destruction. A parliament meeting on January 16, Clarence was brought to his trial on an indictment for high treason, which he de∣nied, and offered to prove his innocence in single combat: but the King being his accuser, and declaring himself well satisfied and convinced of the truth of the impeachment, no evidence was examined, and no member presumed to speak in behalf of the unfortu∣nate Prince, who was therefore convicted, and con∣demned to die the death of a traitor. The sentence, however, was respited; and probably his life would have been spared, had not Edward's indignation been kept up by the intrigues of the Queen and Gloucester, and his apprehension aroused by a ridiculous prophecy, implying that the name of his successor should begin with a G. The ministry would not even venture the popular resentment by a public execution, although the parliament had petitioned that it might be done with∣out delay; and Clarence was found dead in the Tower on March 21, being generally supposed to have been drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine.</P>
<P>The following part of this reign was employed in unavailing treaties on the continent, without any inte∣resting exploit at home, until the year 1482, when the Duke of Gloucester, in an expedition to Scotland, re∣covered Berwick, and concluded a peace with that nation.</P>
<P>A. D. 1483.] The King of England, apprehensive of no disturbance from his northern neighbours, turned all his attention towards prosecuting his revenge against Lewis XI. of France, for betrothing his son Charles the Dauphin, with Margaret heiress of Burgundy, al∣though that Prince had formerly been affianced to
<PB N="320" REF="355"/>Edward's daughter Elizabeth: but in the midst of his mighty preparations for the invasion of France, he was seized with a violent fever, produced by some ex∣cess, of which he died on April 9, in the 42d year of his age; and was buried in the New-chapel at Wind∣for, of which himself was founder.</P>
<P>Edward IV. found the friendship of the clergy so necessary, that he granted a charter exempting them from the jurisdiction of the civil power in criminal causes, remitting all such to the judgment of their or∣dinaries. He likewise established the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts with regard to tythes, and allowed them to issue spiritual censures against such as should invade their prerogatives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 64 &amp; 236.</NOTE>. These favours, while they served to establish Edward's throne, at the same time excited the pride of the clergy and the envy of the lay subjects, which co-operated in paving the way for the reformation. However, we find instances of his severity to individuals among them. We have already taken notice that George Nevil, Archbishop of York, procured him an easy admittance into London, and by that means was in a great measure the cause of his restoration. Nevertheless, when Edward granted a pardon to William Wainfleet Bishop of Winchester (founder of Magdalen-college and Magdalen-hall, in the University of Oxford) and seven other prelates who had been partisans of the house of Lancaster, he sent Nevil into exile, and imprisoned him for several years in the castle of Guisnes, during which time the King enjoyed the revenues of his sees, after having seized all his other effects, among which was a mitre so rich, that he made himself a crown thereof. This prelate was, in the sequel, restored to his liberty and diocese, but went drooping till the day of his death; and it added much to his sorrow, that Pope Sixtus IV. erected St. Andrew's into an archbishopric, independent of
<PB N="321" REF="356"/>his see, which claimed a jurisdiction over the church of Scotland. Sixtus, however, to make an atonement, issued several bulls to screen the clergy from the in∣croachments of the laity, as well as sor confirming, renewing, and increasing, the privileges of the Univer∣sity of Oxford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 117 &amp; 236. Church History p. 133.</NOTE>. John Stacy, another clergyman, fell a sacrifice to the King's resentment. He was a learned and famous astronomer: but being a favourite of the Duke of Clarence, was charged with the exer∣cise of necromancy, for which being condemned, he was executed at Tyburn, where he protested his inno∣cence with great spirit and Constancy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 138.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About the year 1465, one Thomas Holden, a Car∣melite or White friar, preached in Michaelmas term, at St. Paul's cross in London, "That our Lord Jesus Christ was in poverty, and did beg in the world." This occasioned a violent dispute, in which the opponents of the friars maintained, that there was a great difference between begging and taking what the bounty of others doth freely confer, as our Saviour did from such who did minister unto him of their substance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Church History, p. 132.</NOTE>. The principal champions for the mendi∣cants were,</P>
<P>Henry Parker, a Carmelite, bred in Cambridge, living afterwards in Doncaster-convent, imprisoned for preaching:—and John Milverton, bred in Oxford, a Carmelite of Bristol, who being excommunicated by the Bishop of London, appealed to the Pope, but found no favour, and was kept three years prisoner in the castle of St. Angelo.</P>
<P>Against the mendicants appeared Thomas Wilson, LL. D. and, according to some, Dean of St. Paul's, a zealous preacher and disputant:—and William Ivy, canon of St. Paul's, who afterwards wrote in
<PB N="322" REF="357"/>defence of Richard Hill, Bishop of London, who had imprisoned two mendicants for their preaching.</P>
<P>Pope Paul II. put an end to the controversy, by de∣claring the doctrine dangerous, and worthy to be trod∣den down under all mens feet.</P>
<P>There was but one person who suffered for religion in this reign, viz John Goose, who was burned on Tower-hill, in 1473. This man, before his execu∣tion, desired some meat from the Sheriff; which being granted, he said, "I will eat a good competent dineer, for I shall pass a sharp shower, ere I come to sup∣per<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 133.</NOTE></P>
<P>This reign is famous for the introduction of the art of printing by William Caxton, citizen and mercer of London, who set up the first press in England at West∣minster.</P>
<P>Edward IV. was a Prince of the most elegant per∣son, and insinuating address; endowed with the utmost fortitude and intrepidity;<NOTE PLACE="inter">His character.</NOTE> possessed of uncommon sagacity and penetration: but, like all his ancestors, was brutally cruel and vindictive, perfidious, lewd, perjured, and rapacious; without one liberal thought, without one sentiment of huma∣nity.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD V. A. D. 1483.</HEAD>
<P>Edward V. was proclaimed King of England im∣mediately upon the death of his father, being then in the 13th year of his age: but the space of two months and thirteen days, during which he enjoyed that title, was too short to produce any thing affecting the church, farther than it was interested in the consequence of the iniquitious measures taken to deprive Edward of his royal dignity.</P>

<DIV3>
<PB N="323" REF="358"/>
<HEAD>RICHARD III. <HI>surnamed</HI> Crook-back, A. D. 1483.</HEAD>
<P>The Duke of Gloucester, having paved his way to the throne by perfidy and murder, was proclaimed King by the name of Richard III. on June 22; and on July 6, was crowned, together with Anne his Queen, daughter of the renowned Earl of Warwick, and widow of Prince Edward, whom he assassinated at Tewkesbury. Soon afterwards he made a cricuit through several counties, under pretence of reforming abuses. It was during this progress that his two nephews, King Edward and Richard Duke of York, were said to be murdered in the Tower, as at this time they certainly disappeared: but some writers are of opinion, that Edward died of grief, and that his bro∣ther made his escape, and in the sequel was distinguish∣ed by the name of Perkin Warbeck.</P>
<P>Before Richard returned to London, he visited the city of York, and was crowned there a second time. But in the mean time, Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, having been affronted by Richard, whom he was very instrumental in raising to the throne, re∣tired in disgust to his castle of Brecknock; and there, in conjunction with John Morton, Bishop of Ely (com∣mitted to his custody for opposing the tyrant's eleva∣tion) concerted a plan for deposing the usurper, and giving the crown to Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, provided he would marry Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Edward IV. This being approved by all the parties, and the Duke of Brittany inclined to favour the enter∣prize, associations were formed in different counties for a general insurrection: but Richard, being ap∣prised of the conspiracy, assembled an army, and Buckingham being stopped from joining his confede∣rates by the overflowing of the Severn, which lasted six days, his Welch followers, dispirited with fatigue and famine, dispersed; and the Duke, being soon af∣terwards
<PB N="324" REF="359"/>taken, lost his head. His friends, who wait∣ed his passing the Severn, hearing of the desertion of the Welch, severally shifted for themselves: and Richmond, arriving on the coast of Dorset, was obliged to return to the continent for want of adherents.</P>
<P>A. D. 1484.] Richard, having sacrisiced a great number of the insurgents to his vengeance, and being disappointed in his views of getting the Earl of Rich∣mond into his hands, employed his invention to pre∣vent that nobleman's intended marriage with Eliza∣beth, whom he resolved to make his own wife: but there was a necessity to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve his present confort, and obtain the consent of the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> dowager, whose brothers he had butchered. Le cajol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d her in such a manner, that she left the sanctuary, with her five daughters, and appeared with them at court, where they were most graciously received: and Anne, his Queen, did not long survive; being supposed to be killed either with unkindness or poison. His addresses to his niece were received with horror: but he did not doubt of being able to vanquish her reluctance, tho' he delayed the design till a more favourable opportunity should occur, as he did not think it would be politic to force her inclinations.</P>
<P>A. D. 1485.] In the mean time the Earl of Rich∣mond was soliciting succours from the court of France, which having at last procured, he set sail from Har∣fleur, and landed in Milford-haven in Wales, on Au∣gust 6. Richard, being informed of his arrival, col∣lected 12,000 forces, 5000 of which were under the command of Lord Stanley (married to the Earl's mother) and his brother Sir William; and took post between Leicester and Coventry, in order to stop the progress of his antagonist, whose troops did not exceed 5000. On Saturday, August 22, the two armies met at Bosworth, and attacked one another most furiously; but the event remained doubtful, till the two Stanleys went over with their followers to the Lancastrians:
<PB N="325" REF="360"/>who being thus reinforced, obtained a complete vic∣tory, with the loss of about 100 men, over their foes, of whom 1000, besides the leader, fell in the action and pursuit. Richard's crown, being found in the spoils of the field, was by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Stanley placed upon the head of the Earl of Richmond, who was there∣upon saluted as King by the name of Henry VII<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 171—198.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The clergy in general acquiesced in the government of Richard III. but we only find two of them, who prostituted their function in raising that tyrant to the throne, Dr. Ralf Shaw, brother to the Lord Mayor of London, and Pynkney, provincial of the Augustin friars, who were both employed to conciliate the minds of the people to the intended revolution by their bar∣rangues at St. Paul's cross. Shaw forscitea all his po∣pularity by the venal exertion of his talents, and con∣cealed himself in re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irement, where he soon died of sorrow and remorse: and Pynkney lost his credit, con∣science, and voice, altogether<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 167. Church History, p. 134, 135.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such was the end of Richard III. the most cruel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha∣racter.</NOTE> unrelenting tyrant that ever sat on the throne of England. He seems to have been an utter stranger to the softer emotions of the human heart, and entirely destitute of every social sentiment. His ruling passion was ambition, for the gratification of which he trampled upon every law, both human and divine: but this thirst of ambition was unattended with the least mark of generosity, or any desire of rendering himself agreeable to his fellow creat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es: it was the ambition of a savage, not of a Prince; for he was a solitary being, altogether deta hed from the rest of mankind, and incapable of that satisfaction which results from private friendship and disin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rested society. We must acknowledge, however, that, after his accession to the throne, his administration in ge∣neral was conducted by the rules of justice; that he
<PB N="326" REF="361"/>enacted salutary laws, and established wise regulations; and that, if his reign had been protracted, he might have proved an excellent King to the English nation. He possessed an uncommon solidity of judgment, a natural fund of eloquence, the most acute penetration, and such courage as no danger could dismay. He was dark, silent, and reserved, and so much master of dissimulation that it was almost impossible to dive into his real sentiments, when he wanted to conceal his designs. His stature was small, his aspect cloudy, severe and forbidding; one of his arms withered, and one shoulder higher than the other, from which cir∣cumstances of deformity he acquired the epithet of Crook-back. Richard III. was the last of the Anje∣vin race, surnamed Plantagenet, which had possessed the crown of England for the space of three hundred and thirty years: but he was not the last male of that family in England; for the Earl of Warwick, son to George Duke of Clarence, was still alive, and the only remaining branch of all the numerous posterity of the third Edward, which had been almost totally extinguished in the civil war; a war which had raged for thirty years, and was terminated by the battle of Bosworth, after having cost the lives of above one hundred thousand Englishmen, including a great num∣ber of princes of the houses of York and Lancaster.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>HENRY VII A. D. 1485.</HEAD>
<P>Henry, in a few days after his arrival at London, solemnly renewed the oath he had formerly taken to wed the Princess Elizabeth, though he resolved to de∣fer the performance till after his coronation, which was solemnized on October 30, when he instituted the yeomen of the guard. In November the parliament entailed the crown upon him and the heirs of his body.</P>
<P>A. D. 1486.] Although Henry hated the family of York, he found it necessary to fulfil his engagement
<PB N="327" REF="362"/>to marry the Princess Elizabeth; and the nuptials were solemnized on January 18, to the inexpressible joy of the nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 243.</NOTE>: but the demonstrations of popular satisfaction were extremely mortifying to the King, who considered them as so many marks of affection to the house of York, for which he had conceived such an aver∣sion, that he always treated his Queen with the utmost coldness and ind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fference, and never let slip an oppor∣tunity to humble the partisans of her house, towards whom he acted rather as the chief of a party, than as an equitable Sovereign. Whilst Henry was on a tour through the northern counties, he received information that Lord Lovel, with Humphrey and Thomas Staf∣ford, were actually in arms; at which he was not a little startled: but his apprehensions were soon removed by the insurgents dispersing on offer of pardon.</P>
<P>The birth of his eldest s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, Prince Arthur, on Sep∣tember 20, gave hopes to the nation, that this event would warm Henry's indifference into a real affection for the mother<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 247.</NOTE>; but when they saw that it had no such effect, that he delayed her coronation; that his disposition was fordid and illiberal, and his temper sullen and reserved, they looked upon him with detestation, and began to think they had made a bad exchange for the tyrant Richard. His enemies took this oppor∣tunity to insinuate, that he intended to murder the Earl of Warwick in the Tower; and it was whispered that the Duke of York had made his escape from the cruelty of his uncle, and was still alive on the conti∣nent.</P>
<P>The universal joy expressed by the English people at this report, encouraged Richard Simon, a priest of Oxford, to project the affair of Lambert Simnel, a youth of uncommon vivacity and extraordinary per∣sonal accomplishments, whom he resolved to pass upon the world as that Duke: but upon a surmise that the
<PB N="328" REF="363"/>Earl of Warwick had escaped from the Tower, he de∣termined that Simnel should personate this nobleman. Having properly tutored his pupil, he carried him to Ireland, where the imposture succeeded so far that he was, without opposition, proclaimed King, by the name of Edward VI.</P>
<P>A. D. 1487.] By this time the spirit of disaffection, which had become general in England, was very much inflamed by the King's confining the Queen Dowager in the monastery of Bermondsey, and depriving her of her whole estate, without any form or trial. The tutors of Simnel (who had been crowned King of Ire∣land, and reinforced with 2000 German troops) hoping to benefit themselves of the disposition in England, landed with about 8000 men in Lancashire, where they were joined by very few. Henry had made the necessary preparations for their reception, and under∣standing that their route was towards Newark; he attacked them on June 6, at the head of 12,000 troops, at the village of Stoke, and, after an obstinate resistance of three hours, obtained a complete victory. Lambert Simnel and Simon the priest were made pri∣soners; and Henry affected to despise his rival so much, that he would not take his life, but retained him at first as a scullion in his kitchen, and afterwards as a falconer.</P>
<P>Henry, after the battle, having made a journey to the north, observed that the discontents of the people proceeded in a great measure from his severity to the partisans of the house of York, and in particular for his having delayed so long the Queen's coronation: there∣fore, upon his return to London, he ordered it to be so∣lemnized on November 25. The parliament meeting the same month, voted the King a large supply for the support of the Duke of Brittany against Charles VIII. of France; and confirmed the authority of the star-chamber, a court which had hitherto subsisted by
<PB N="329" REF="364"/>the ancient common laws of the realm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 263.</NOTE>. They like∣wise enacted a statute, by which any servant of the King, under the degree of a nobleman, conspiring the death of any member of the council, or Lord of the realm, should be deemed guilty of a capital crime. The same penalty was extended to those who should obtain possession of women by force, howsoever they might afterwards be reconciled to their ravishers.</P>
<P>A. D. 1488.] The levying of the subsidy, granted by the parliament, occasioned an insurrection in York∣shire and the bishopric of Durham, headed by John à Chamber, in which the Earl of Northumberland lost his life: but the commotion was soon quelled by the Earl of Surry.</P>
<P>A. D. 1492.] The King of England conceiving himself ill used in divers negotiations by the French Monarch, during the three preceding years, convoked a parliament in the beginning of this year, and ac∣quainted them with his resolution to recover the kingdom of France, as the inheritance of his ancestors, demand∣ing, at the same time, a supply suitable to the great∣ness of the occasion. The parliament complying with his request, he made some preparations, and after divers delays landed in October at Calais; from which he marched to invest Boulogne. Charles the French King, though he was not ignorant of Henry's pro∣ceedings, had not even assembled an army to oppose him: and, in eight days after the siege of Boulogne was undertaken, peace was concluded between the two kingdoms at Estaples, without so much as men∣tioning the restitution of any of the French dominions. He was reimbursed all the expences of his armament, and allowed a yearly pension, by Charles: but the no∣bility and officers, who sold or mortgaged their estates, in hopes of preferment, murmured very much.</P>
<PB N="330" REF="365"/>
<P>A. D. 1493.] Henry was by this time become extre∣mely odious to the English, who accused him of tre∣panning the commons into a grant of exorbitant taxes; of having extorted immense sums illegally, under the term of benevolence; of having concluded an inglo∣rious peace with France; of treating the Queen harshly; and of depressing all those who had been well-wishers to the house of York. He was not igno∣rant of the people's discontent, and foresaw the storm to which he was afterwards exposed.</P>
<P>A new pretender to the crown of England,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Account of Perkin Warbeck.</NOTE> much more dangerous than Lambert Simnel, had appeared on the continent, under the name of Richard Plantagenet Duke of York, second son of Edward IV. supposed to have escaped from the Tower, after the death of his elder brother, Edward V. This claimant (whom the adherents of Henry alledged to be the son of a converted Jew in Tourney, and distinguished by the name of Perkin Warbeck) was a youth of very engaging aspect, courteous address, and of great accomplishments both of body and un∣derstanding. He was patronized by Edward VI.'s sister, Margaret Duchess of Burgundy, who, when Henry VII. declared war against France, desired him to take shipping for Ireland, which was devoted to the house of York. He followed her directions, and land∣ing at Cork, was joined by a great number of parti∣sans. Charles VIII. was no sooner informed of his being there, than he sent ambassadors to assure him of his protection, and invite him to his court. On his arrival at Paris he was honourably received, acknow∣ledged Duke of York, accommodated in a princely manner, till the peace of Estaples, when Henry tried to persuade the French King to deliver him up: but that Monarch would not violate the laws of hospi∣tality, though he promised that the youth should have no assistance from France in support of his claim to the English throne. The adventurer then repaired
<PB N="331" REF="366"/>to the court of the Duchess of Burgundy, where he gave such pertinent answers to the minutest questions proposed to him, and demeaned himself with such dig∣nity of deportment, that she, and all the spectators, seemed fully convinced of his being the real Duke of York. She forthwith owned him as her nephew, distinguished him by the title of <HI>The white Rose of England,</HI> appointed a guard for his person, and treated him in all respects as the true heir of the English mo∣narchy. When these circumstances were known in England, Sir William Stanley, and several persons of distinction, sent over Sir Robert Clifford, and W. Baily, of Aldeburg, in Hertfordshire, to learn the truth of what was transacted at Margaret's court; and Sir Robert, after frequent conversations with the young man, assured his constituents, that he was the identical Richard Plantagenet.</P>
<P>In the mean time Henry was not idle: he employed emissaries abroad to insinuate themselves into the con∣duct of the pretender and his protectress, that they might discover the particulars of his birth and education, as well as the names of those who favoured him in Eng∣land. That those spies might be the less suspected, he caused them to be excommunicated at St. Paul's by name, in the bead-roll of his enemies, according to the custom of the times: nay, he even tampered with the chaplains and confessors of the nobility, in order to know their secret inclinations. He was no less indus∣trious in endeavouring to find out proofs of the Duke of York's having been murdered in the Tower. Sir James Tyrrel, and his servant Dighton, were examin∣ed, and confessed themselves the perpetrators of that alledged tragedy; but, however, their account left the matter in such perplexity, that Henry never made use of it in any of his declarations. Dighton was set at li∣berty, and earned his pardon by divulging this tradi∣tion, which in all probability was invented for Henry's purpose: and very little dependance ought to be laid
<PB N="332" REF="367"/>on extorted confessions, as well as on the writers of this reign, who had their information, concerning this dark affair, in such incoherent scraps as the King was pleased to give them; and generally made their court, by blackening his predecessor, who was otherwise cri∣minal enough. All the intelligence that Henry could get from abroad, was so defective, and ill attested, that, instead of convincing the world of an imposture, it confirmed the opinion of many in favour of the youth called Perkin Warbeck. They concluded, from Henry's known sagacity, that if the young man had really been an impostor, he would have traced him from his cradle to his appearance in the character of Richard Plantagenet, in such a manner, as would have plainly detected the deceit. They could hardly believe, that Charles VIII. King of France, and the Duchess of Burgundy, would have prostituted the dignity of Princes so far, as to bestow it upon a com∣mon adventurer; and they took it for granted, that if the Duke of York had been actually murdered in the Tower, King Henry would have been able to prove the fact so clearly, as to confute the pretensions of any counterfeit. There was something very mysterious in Henry's conduct upon this occasion: for the informa∣tion, which he alledged to have received from his spies abroad, touching the life and adventures of Perkin, was not published by proclamation, or in any other authentic manner; but circulated in vague and con∣tradictory reports by the courtiers and their adherents. His ambassador at the court of the Archduke, when desired to produce the evidence of the Duke of York's death, said, his master declined that fort of proof, be∣cause it might be alledged that he had tutored the wit∣nesses. These circumstances, added to the uncommon jealousy he manifested towards the pretender, the great pains he took, and the sums, which, contrary to his nature, he expended, in countermining the efforts of the claimant, persuaded many people, that the youth was

The King affected great surprise, threatening the informer with death, if his accusations were false. Clifford persisted in the im∣peachment, and Sir William was immediately put un∣der arrest. Next day, being examined before the council, he owned what was laid to his charge, and was condemned on his own confession; though all that he had said, amounted to no more than, that he would never bear arms against Perkin Warbeck, were he certain that the youth was the real son of Edward IV. Perhaps he thought himself secure in the service he had done the King, and the great credit of his brother; but all the favour he could obtain, was the respite of a few weeks, that he might prepare himself for death<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. p. 292.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1495.] The whole kingdom was over∣whelmed with consternation at the fate of Sir William Stanley, who suffered for that which few English sub∣jects were innocent; namely, for preferring the right of the house of York to that of the reigning King. What augmented their fear, was their perceiving that Henry had maintained spies to watch the conduct of the Lord Chamberlain; and, in all probability, followed the same practice with other noblemen, who durst no longer communicate their sentiments, lest those, whom they trusted as friends, should prove informers.—In summer, King Henry, in order to convince the na∣tion, that the proceedings against Sir William Stanley had not diminished his regard for his brother the Earl of Derby, or his affection for his own mother the wife of that nobleman, made an excursion to the Earl's house at Latham in Lancashire, where he staid three days, and seemed well pleased with his entertainment. From thence he made a progress through Yorkshire: and while he was at this distance from the capital,
<PB N="336" REF="371"/>his rival resolved to try his fortune in England. Being supplied with some troops and vessels by the Duchess of Burgundy, he se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l in July, and arriving on the coast of Kent, near Sandwich, landed some of his people, to sound the inclinations of the natives, whom they endeavoured to cajole, by assuring them that there was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strong armament fitted out in Flanders for supporting the title of the Duke of York: but the Kentishmen observing they were all foreigners and freebooters, instead of joining them, consulted the gentlemen of the county, who advised them to allure the adventurer ashore, and then secure his person. They accordingly took to their arms, and marching to the sea-side, invited him to land; which he was inclined to comply with, till dissuaded by his secretary Frion, who concluded they were part of Henry's forces; and these, finding themselves disappointed, put all those to the sword, except about 160, who were afterwards hanged in different parts of the coast by the King's order. Mean while, the pretender, having seen the attack of his people, hoisted sail, and steered his course back to Flanders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 295.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Henry, upon his return from his northern tour, assembled a parliament in October; which, among other laws, enacted that famous stature, ordaining, That no person assisting, in arms or otherwise, the King for the time being, should be afterwards called to account, or attainted on that accusation. This statute appears at first sight to have been enacted in favour of the people<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 296.</NOTE>: but was, in reality, calcu∣lated to hinder individuals from prying too narrowly into Henry's title, which they would have the less oc∣casion to examine strictly, as this provision was seem∣ingly made for their safety.</P>
<P>During the session of this parliament, Henry was informed, that Perkin had landed in Ireland; but
<PB N="337" REF="372"/>such measures had been taken, that no person of con∣sequence declared for him; and therefore he was ad∣vised to sail for Scotland, and solicit succour from James IV. King of that country, who was upon very indifferent terms with Henry, and had probably agreed to assist him at the mediation of the Duchess of Bur∣gundy, before he sailed from Flanders. The youth is also said to have been recommended to his protection by the Emperor Maximilian, the Archduke Philip, and Charles of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 297.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1496.] The Scottish Monarch received the adventurer with great hospitality; acknowledged him as son of Edward IV. gave him in marriage his own kinswoman Lady Catherine Gordon, daughter to the Earl of Huntley; and promised to support his preten∣sions to the crown of England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. v. p. 298.</NOTE>. James being assured that the English would declare for the claimant in great numbers, as soon as he should appear in that kingdom properly attended, raised a numerous army, which he conducted into Northumberland, accompa∣nied by the pretender. There he published a mani∣festo, inveighing against Henry as an usurper, tyrant, and murderer; and promised honours and advantages to those who should join their lawful Prince, and help to destroy the robber who had deprived him of his throne. This spirited remonstrance had very little effect upon the English, who were nationally averse to the Scots, and by this time so intimidated by the suc∣cess and severity of the reigning King, that they would no longer risque their lives and fortunes in behalf of a stranger, even though they believed him to be the son of Edward: and James, seeing no hopes of being join∣ed by the English, returned to his own country<NOTE PLACE="‡">Ibid. vol. v. p. 301.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>King Henry was not a little disgusted at the Scottish expedition, though it had produced no important con∣sequence.

<PB N="338" REF="375"/>However, as he knew his subjects to be generally disaffected, measures were concerted to se∣cure him on all hands. He granted an amnesty to the Irish, who had declared for Perkin: he employed the Bishop of Durham to enter into a negotiation with the Scottish King, as of his own accord, and treat of a marriage between that Prince and his daughter Mar∣garet, and strengthened himself by foreign alliances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 302.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1497.] Notwithstanding this plan of pacifi∣cation with Scotland, Henry, having convened a par∣liament in January, expatiated upon the insult re∣ceived from King James, and declared, that he would take signal vengeance on the invader. He obtained an ample supply, and then dissolved the assembly.</P>
<P>He did not at all doubt of the success of his nego∣tiation with Scotland; and therefore, that he might have the subsidy in his coffers before the peace should be concluded, he ordered it to be collected with all possible dispatch. This taxation occasioned a commo∣tion in Cornwall, fomented at first in Bodmin, by Michael Joseph, a popular blacksmith, and Thomas Flammock, a turbulent lawyer; and at last headed by Lord Audeley, who conducted 16,000 insurgents to Blackheath, in Kent, where they were totally routed on June 22<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 303.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While Henry was employed in quelling this rebel∣lion, the Scottish King made a second irruption into England; but not being joined by the partizans of the house of York, and a numerous army advancing against him under the Earl of Surry, he retired into his own kingdom, whither he was pursued by the English ge∣neral, who took the castle of Ayton, a sew miles from Berwick.</P>
<P>Several considerations induced Henry to desire a peace with James; but was afraid to make the first overtures, lest he should meet with a repulse. He,
<PB N="339" REF="376"/>therefore, prevailed on the Spanish ambassador to visit the court of Scotland, and as from himself propose an accommodation. That minister executed his commis∣sion with such address, that a congress was opened at Ayton, under his mediation. The greatest difficulty was about Perkin, whom Henry demanded, and whom James positively refused to deliver. At length it was agreed, that James should dismiss the claimant, and then proceed with the negotiation, as if he had never been in Scotland. In pursuance of this convention, the Scottish Monarch told the adventurer, that he had done every thing in his power to support him in his pretensions; that he had twice entered England at the head of an army; but that, as the English had de∣clined espousing his cause, he could not expect that the Scots would, without their concurrence, be able to establish him on the throne of England. He therefore advised him to form some more seasible plan, and chuse some other country for his place of residence: at the same time he assured him, that he would punctually ful∣fil his promise; that he should not repent of having put himself into his hands; for he should be honoura∣bly accommodated with ships and necessaries for his voyage. The youth bore his misfortune with a good grace; thanked the King of Scotland for the protec∣tion and other favours he had enjoyed from his bounty; and desired that he and his wife might be conveyed to Ireland. James complied with his request; and he arrived at Cork, where he still found friends and adhe∣rents. After his departure, the plenipotentiaries at Ayton signed a treaty of truce for seven years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 306.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1498.] Although the King of England had nothing to fear from foreign enemies, he was once more exposed to the danger of a domestic insurrection. His clemency to the Cornish insurgents, who had paid two or three shillings each for their ransom, was re∣presented
<PB N="340" REF="377"/>by them at their return, as not owing to his mercy, but his apprehension of his own subjects, three-fourths of whom were of the same sentiments with the Cornishmen. These insinuations persuading their friends and neighbours that the whole kingdom was ripe for revolt, some of the most zealous against the government concerted measures for a fresh commotion; and as they proposed that Perkin should be their leader, they sent a deputation to tell him, that if he would re∣pair to Cornwall, he would find considerable succours, which, with the assistance of his other well-wishers, would, in all probability, place him on the throne of England. As he was without resource, he accepted the invitation, and forthwith embarking with about seventy followers, in four small vessels, arrived at Whitsand-bay, whence he proceeded to Bodmin. Be∣ing joined there by about 3000 men, he assumed the title of Richard IV. King of England; and published a proclamation, exhorting the people to take up arms, in order to depose Henry Tudor, the usurper. He then made an unsuccessful attempt upon Exeter, with the loss of 200 of his followers: and relinquishing the enterprise, upon notice that his antagonist was ad∣vancing against him with numerous forces, marched to Taunton, where he declared he would hazard an engagement; but dreading to fall into Henry's hands, he withdrew in the night, with some of his confidents, to the sanctuary of Beaulieu, in the New Forest, which was soon beset by a party of the King's army. In the mean time the insurgents, to the number of 6000, finding themselves without a leader, submitted to their adversaries. A detachment of cavalry was sent to St. Michael's Mount, to secure Perkin's wife; Henry foreseeing that if she was pregnant, the contest might be continued to another generation. When that Lady was brought into the King's presence, he was so struck with her beauty and modest deportment, that he con∣soled her in very affectionate terms, with promise of
<PB N="341" REF="378"/>protection, sent her under a strong guard to attend upon the Queen, and bestowed upon her a considerable pension, which she enjoyed during his life, and many years afterwards. It was in this expedition that Henry presented his sword to the Mayor of Exeter, to be carried before that Magistrate, for the defence the citizens had made in behalf of his government *.</P>
<P>The disturbance being effectually quelled, the fate of Perkin came under consideration, and it was deter∣mined that the King should pardon him, on condition of his confessing and explaining every circumstance of his long assumed character. His affairs being then desperate, he embraced the offer without hesitation, and quitted the sanctuary. Henry being desirous of seeing him, he was brought to court, where the King viewed him from a window, but would never admit him into his presence. He was afterwards conducted to London, and by Henry's order rode in public thro' the streets from Westminster to the Tower, and back again, amidst the insults of the populace, which he bore with the most dignified resignation. Then he was confined in the Tower, and signed a confession, which was printed and dispersed through the nation: but this was so lame, defective, and contradictory, that, instead of explaining the pretended imposture, it left it more doubtful than before, and induced many people to be∣lieve that Perkin Warbeck was really the son of Ed∣ward IV<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 312.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1499.] Henry had now triumphed over op∣position, and the Pope had granted a dispensation for the marriage of Prince Arthur with Catherine of Spain: but Ferdinand, that Princess's father, was not satisfied that Perkin Warbeck was an impostor; and even hint∣ed, that Henry's throne could not be firmly established while any Prince of the house of York remained alive. The King of England was so intent upon the Spanish<NOTE PLACE="foot">Smol let, vol. v. p. 309.</NOTE>
<PB N="342" REF="379"/>match, and so tired of the successive insurrections by which his reign had been disturbed, that he resolved to sacrifice the youth called Perkin Warbeck, as well as Edward Plantagenet Earl of Warwick, to his interest and safety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 313.</NOTE>; and he soon got rid of them both under form of law<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The unfortunate Warwick, who was the son of George Duke of Clarence, had been, since the death of his uncle Richard III. con∣fined in the Tower, without any other cause than his being of the house of York, debarred of the benefit of air, exercise, and conver∣sation; and kept in such ignorance, that he could scarce call the domestic animals by name. Perkin, who doubtless felt that desire of liberty which is so natural to the mind of man, and had reason to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d the worst from Henry's disposition, was permitted to converse wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the hapless Warwick, as well as the domestics of Lord Digby, Lieutenant of the Tower: and in all probab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity he was indulged with this permission by the connivance of the King, in hopes that his enterprising genius, and insinuating address, would engage the undesigning Warwick in some project that would furnish a pretext for taking away their lives under colour of justice. Perkin fell into the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are, according to Henry's expectation: he tampered with War∣wick, and gained over four servants of Digby, who are said to have undertaken the murder of their master, that they might secure the keys of the Tower, and escape with the two prisoners to some part of the kingdom where a new insurrection might be raised in favour of the Pretender. That the danger might appear the more imminent and pressing, so as to justify the steps which Henry intended to take, another disturbance was raised at the same time in Kent, where a young man called Ralph Wilford, the son of a cordwainer, personated the Earl of Warwick, under the conduct and direction of one Patrick, an Augustine monk, who in public serm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns exhorted the people to take arms in his favour. This Patrick, who had been used as a tool by the King's emissaries, was arrested, together with his pupil; and Wilford was hanged without ceremony, but the tutor obtained his pardon. This was the prelude to the fate of Perkin and the Earl of Warwick, whose pretended plot being now discovered, Perkin was tried at Westminster, and being convicted on the evidence of Lord Digby's servants, was, on November 16, hanged at Tyburn, with John Walter, Mayor of Cork, who had constantly adhered to him in all the vicissitudes of his fortune. Blewet and Astwood, two of Digby's servants, underwent the same fate; but six other persons, condemned as accomplices in the same conspiracy, were pard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned. In a few days after Perkin's execution, the simple Earl of Warwick was tried by his p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and being convicted, in conse∣quence of his pleading guilty to the arraignment, was beheaded on Tower-hill, on the 28th. The deplorable end of this innocent nobleman, the last male branch of the royal Plantagenets, and the fate of Perkin Warbeck, who, notwithstanding all that appeared against him, was by the unprejudiced part of the nation deemed the real son of King Edward IV. filled the whole kingdom with such horror and aversion to the government of Henry, that he was fain to translate the odium upon his ally Ferdinand, by divulging that Prince's scruples.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The year 1500 produced a great plague in England, and an interview between King Henry and the Archduke Philip at Calais. It is also memorable for the conti∣nuation of Henry's rapacious methods of gratifying his avarice. As he had no pretence for demanding subsidies from parliament, he resolved to drain the party of Warbeck, until they should be quite ex∣hausted. On the supposition that the adherents of this pretender were still liable to the rigour of the law, notwithstanding they had been all forgiven, except a few of the ringleaders who were hanged, he insisted upon their being indulged with separate pardons, which they did not at all solicit; and compelled them to pay largely for this indulgence. He appointed commis∣sioners to set on foot a new enquiry about those who had in any manner assisted or favoured the revolt of the Lord Audeley (all whose surviving followers, ex∣cept Joseph and Flammock, were pardoned by pro∣clamation) and the cause of Perkin. Thesen quisi∣tors were impowered to amerce, at discretion, every individual who should have the benefit of the pardon; and even seize the effects of the deceased, should their heirs refuse to make a composition. Such oppression augmented the popular clamour against Henry to such a degree, that never was a King of England more hated by his subjects; though this hatred was mingled with fear, produced by his uninterrupted success, and the conceived opinion of his great ability both as a Monarch and a politician. All the powers upon the

<P>On February 11, 1503, the royal family suffered another loss by the decease of the Queen in childbed: but her death was so little regretted by her husband, from whom she had never received any marks of ten∣derness or affection, that he even rejoiced at it, as an event that freed him from a hateful rival in his title to the throne. He was now raised to the summit of felicity: but he was resolved that his subjects should not share in his happiness; for his avarice becoming every day more and more insatiable, he employed all his invention in devising new methods of extortion. For these fordid purposes, he retained two infamous ministers called Empsom and Dudley, who followed the proses∣sion of the law, and practised it in all its subterfuges and chicanery, in oppressing the subjects with false ac∣cusations and imprisonment, until they were fain to
<PB N="345" REF="382"/>purchase what was called a mitigation, with the best part of their substance. Such was their insolence, that they did not even observe the common forms of justice; but proceeded, with the most arbitrary licence, to attack pretended delinquents, and try them, in private, without fair examination or verdict of jury: and these acts of violence they exercised under the authority of the King, who shared the fruits of their oppression. He even insisted upon their keeping regu∣lar accompts of this scandalous commerce, and main∣tained a kind of distributive justice, even in the prac∣tice of corruption<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 321.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He let slip no opportunity of amassing money, howsoever mean or ungrateful it might be. One day, when he was magnificently entertained by the Earl of Oxford, to whose services he was in a great measure in∣debted for the crown, he perceived a greater number of do∣mestics in livery than the law allowed him to maintain; and turning to the Earl, "My Lord (said he) I have heard much of your hospitality; but it exceeds report. Are all these gentlemen and yeomen your menial ser∣vants?" Oxford answering that they were retained upon such extraordinary occasions only, Henry affected surprise, and replied with some warmth, "By my faith! my Lord, I thank you for my good cheer; but I may not endure to have my laws broken in my sight: my attorney must speak with you." The Earl was obliged to compound for this misdemeanor by the payment of 15,000 marks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such conduct in the King and his ministers could not fail to render them extremely odious to the people, who murmured incessantly against the government; and this discontent encouraged Edmond de la Pole Earl of Suffolk, whose fortune was greatly reduced by his own extravagance, to prosecute his projects against the government. He was nephew to Edward IV. and about two years before having been affronted by
<PB N="346" REF="383"/>the King, retired in disgust to the court of his aunt the Duchess of Burgundy; but was persuaded to re∣turn and be reconciled to Henry. He had acquired a degree of popularity as being a branch of the house of York: he privately engaged some persons of con∣sideration in his interest; and then made another visit to Flanders, in hopes of receiving countenance and succour from his aunt. The King, alarmed at his re∣treat, and eager to know his scheme, with the names of his associates, repeated the expedient he had used in the case of the youth, commonly called Perkin Warbeck. Sir Robert Curson, governor of the castle of Hammes, being properly instructed, abandoned his charge on pretence of having been injured by Henry. He acted his part with such dexterity, that in a short time he insinuated himself into the Earl's confidence, and discovered all his associates. The in∣telligence was forthwith communicated to the King, who immediately issued warrants for apprehending the principal conspirators, some of whom were executed. Henry, willing to be more fully informed touching the particulars of the designs of the Earl of Suffolk, took a very extraordinary method to maintain Curson in the confidence of that nobleman. He caused the bull of Pope Innocent VIII. denouncing the censures of the church against all those who should disturb his government, to be published in St. Paul's church; and got the Earl of Suffolk and Sir Robert Curson to be excommunicated by name. When this emissary had discovered all the Earl's secrets, he returned to England, and was readmitted publickly into the King's favour, which, however, he did not enjoy without the curses of the people, who detested his perfidy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>A. D. 1506.] Philip I. King of Castile, with his consort Johanna, eldest sister of the Princess Catherine, being driven in January by stress of weather into the harbour of Weymouth, Henry received them with
<PB N="348" REF="385"/>all the marks of the most cordial friendship; though he was resolved to derive some advantage from the accident that brought them into his territories. He renewed a commercial treaty subsisting between the English and Flemings, with some alterations in favour of England. Henry, nevertheless, resolved to detain his guest until he should deliver up the Earl of Suffolk, from whose machinations he still dreaded some trouble and disquiet. He, therefore, told the Castilian Mo∣narch, with some emotion, "Sir, you have been saved upon my coast, I hope you will not suffer me to be wrecked on your's." When Philip desired to know the purport of that address, Henry replied, "I mean that same hair-brained wild-fellow, my subject, the Earl of Suffolk, who is protected in your country, and begins to play the fool, when others are tired of the game." To this explanation the Castilian an∣swered, "I thought your felicity had raised you above all such apprehensions; but since you are uneasy at his residing in Flanders, I will banish him from my do∣minions." The English Monarch expressing a desire of having him in his power, Philip told him in some confusion, that he could not deliver him up with any regard to his own honour; and that such a step would be still less for the reputation of Henry, as the world would imagine he had treated his guest as a prisoner. "I will take that disgrace upon myself (said the King) and so your honour will be saved." The other, seeing that he would not be denied, composed his counte∣nance, saying, "Sir, you give law to me, and I will dictate to you in my turn: Suffolk shall be delivered up; but you will give me your honour that his life shall be safe." Henry agreeing to the proposal, Philip wrote a letter to Suffolk, assuring him that he had ob∣tained his pardon; and the King confirming this asser∣tion by another message, that nobleman returned to his own country, and was committed close prisoner to the Tower: but Henry VIII, without regard to his

<P>The Wickliffites, or Lollards, were affected by Henry VII.'s avarice in common with his other sub∣jects; but their religious tenets subjected them besides to the severity of his disposition. He not only con∣nived at the persecution carried on against them by John Hales, Bishop of Coventry and Litchfield, in the beginning of his reign, but afterwards actually countenanced the cruelties exercised towards them; of which the following may serve for instances.—An old man was burnt in Smithfield; and one Joan Bough∣ton, a widow of eighty years of age, and mother of Lady Young (who was afterwards martyred) was like∣wise committed to the flames. When the King was at Canterbury in 1498, there was an old priest so tena∣cious of his opinions, that none of the clergy could convince him to the contrary. His Majesty is said to have converted this priest, and then to have ordered him to be burnt. Next year, one Babram was brought to the stake in Norfolk; and afterwards one Thomas Novice suffered the same fate at Norwich, in that county; as did Laurence Glest at Salisbury. A de∣vout woman was burnt at Sudbury by order of the Chancellor of Gloucester, Dr. Whittingdon; and af∣ter her execution, the Chancellor was gored to death

<P>Several persons recanted, and bore faggots, by way of penance, at the public processions, or during the time of sermon.</P>
<P>Buckinghamshire produced more martyrs and con∣fessors, of clergy as well as laity, than all the kingdom besides, before the time of Martin Luther. Among others, mention is made of William Tylsworth, who was burnt at Amersham (a great rendezvous of the Wickliffites in those days) and Joan, his only daugh∣ter, was compelled to set fire to the faggots that con∣sumed him. At the same time, more than sixty per∣sons did penance as before mentioned; and were fur∣ther enjoined to wear a square piece of cloth on their right sleeves for some years, as a badge of disgrace to themselves, and a difference from others.—A new punishment of branding the professors of Wickliffism on the cheek was afterwards made use of.

<P>Henry VII. erected the <HI>Savoy</HI> into an hospital for one master and four secular chaplains; and built that elegant Gothic chapel adjoining to Westminster abbey, where he had sepulture, and which still retains his name.</P>

<P>Among the remarkable persons of this reign,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Some account of Dean Colet.</NOTE> was Dr. John Colet, the eldest and only surviving child of Sir Henry Colet, mercer, twice Lord Mayor of London, who, with his ten sons, and as many daughters, was depicted on a glass-window in the church of St. Antolin, in Lon∣don, to which he was a benefactor. Dr. Colet was educated in the university of Oxford; and afterwards, for his further improvement, travelled into France and Italy. Upon his return he studied the scriptures, and expounded St. Paul's epistles publickly at Oxford. He was presented by Henry VII. to the deanery of St. Paul's cathedral; and as he had early imbibed a liking to the doctrines of Wickliffe, he was always a protec∣tor of those called Lollards, and saved the life of one by his interposition with the King. In his sermons he maintained, <HI>That images should not be worshipped, and that clerks should not be covetous.</HI> Two friars, named Bricot and Standish, accused him of heresy unto Ri∣chard Fitz-James, Bishop of London, who charged him with the same crime to William Warham, Arch∣bishop of Canterbury. But that Primate, well know∣ing the Dean's worth and integrity, from a judge be∣came his advocate; defended and patronized him, and would not give him the trouble of putting in any for∣mal answer. It is also said, that the Bishop endeavour∣ed to represent Dr. Colet as an heretic, for translating the <HI>paier-noster</HI> into English; but the Archbishop in∣terposed. The Dean's troubles, on account of his re∣ligious sentiments, increased his charity and devotion. He had a plentiful fortune, and resolved to dedicate it to some permanent benefaction in his own time. Churches, monasteries, religious houses, and chaun∣tries, had long been in England the objects of public charity, which then began to be rather applied to the
<PB N="355" REF="392"/>erecting of colleges, and providing for students at the universities. Learning was brought out of Italy, and greatly diffused by the art of printing. Dr. Colet rightly judged that the restoration of learning would be much promoted by the endowment of a grammar-school for the instruction of youth in the Latin and Greek languages, the basis of classical literature, as well as of the study of divinity; and conceived, that, by being the founder of such a school, he should pro∣vide an excellent nursery for the two universities. For that end he erected a noble structure at the east-end of St. Paul's church-yard in the city of London, at the expence of 4500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> besides what he allotted for the free education of one hundred and fifty-three youths, poor mens children, and for handsome salaries to the masters; the two first of whom were William Lily, the noted grammarian, and John Wrighthouse, both men of capacity and diligence. He likewise establish∣ed rules for the conduct of the masters, as well as the students, and committed the charge of the whole to the mercers company. Erasmus says, Dean Colet laid out a great part of his inheritance in building St. Paul's school, which was a magnificent fabric, dedicated to the child Jesus. Two dwelling-houses were added for the accommodation of the two masters, for whom ample provision was made. The school was divided into four apartments: the boys had their distinct forms, one above the other, and every form held sixteen. The pious founder would admit no partner in the expence: and after he had finished his foundation, he granted the perpetual care, government, and superintendency of the estate, not to the clergy, Bishop, the chapter, or any great minister at court, but to married citizens of probity and reputation. When he was asked the cause of so doing, he answered, there was no certainty in human affairs, but he found less corruption in such a body of citizens than in any other body of men.

<P>About the same time lived Thomas Scroop, who, after entering into divers religious orders, withdrew himself to his house, where he spent twenty years in the life of an hermit.

The nobility he excluded entirely from the administration of public affairs, and employed clergymen and law∣yers, who, as they had no interest in the nation, and depended entirely upon his favour, were more obse∣quious to his will, and ready to concur in all his arbi∣trary measures.

D. 1230, and had given great inquietude to the Chancellor and scholars, by infringing their statutes and privileges, and setting up an exempt jurisdiction<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bale.</NOTE>. Wickliffe soon distinguished himself by his bold and zealous opposition to the usurpations and errors of the friars, who justified their begging trade, by asserting, that the poverty of Christ and his apostles made them possess all things in common, and beg for a livelihood. This was first op∣posed by Richard Kilmyngton, Dean of St. Paul's, and afterwards by Fitz-Ralph, Archbishop of Armagh. Wickliffe wrote and published several tracts against the beggary of the friars, with an elegance uncommon to that age; and publickly disputed with a friar on <HI>Able beggary,</HI> before the Duke of Gloucester<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See an account of a subsequent disputation on this subject in page 321 of this volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These controversies gave Wickliffe such reputation in the university<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Tindal.</NOTE>, that in 1361 he was advanced to be Master of Baliol college, and in 1365 made War∣den of Canterbury-hall. Wickliffe behaved with uni∣versal approbation; but Archbishop Islip dying, April 1366, the monks soon after made application to Simon Langham, his successor, to get Wickliffe and three other seculars silenced, which the Primate complied with, having received the Pope's Bull, enjoining silence on Wickliffe and his associates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has given occasion to some persons to represent Wickliffe's future actions as proceeding from resentment: but that seems to be no more than a malicious imputation, for he had avowed his tenets in writing, and even made some converts from the church of Rome, some years before this event.</NOTE>. In this arbitary man∣ner was Wickliffe deposed from the wardenship confer∣red on him by the founder, who had been authorised thereto by the licence of Mortmain. It was there∣fore
<PB N="359" REF="397"/>questioned whether the hall and endowment were not forfeited to the crown; but the monks procured the royal pardon, and confirmation of the Papal sen∣tence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lewis, p. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About the same time King Edward had notice from Pope Urban V. that he intended to cite him to his court, at Avignon, to answer for his default in not performing the homage which King John had acknow∣ledged to the see of Rome, and for refusing to pay the tribute of 700 marks a year, granted by that Prince, to the Pope. The King laid this before his parliament, who determined to assist him to the utmost of their power against such arbitary attempts<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See page 88 of this volume.</NOTE>; and the firm∣ness of their resolution put an effectual stop to the Pon∣tiff's claim, and prevented any such for the future. Nevertheless, one of the monks ventured to defend the Pope's demand, but was forthwith answered with much argument and spirit by Wickliffe, who thereby farther in∣curred the Pope's resentment, but recommended him∣self to the favour of several of the courtiers, and par∣ticularly John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, who took him under his patronage<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Collins's Abridgment.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This ejectment of Wickliffe from his wardenship was no injury to his reputation, and he was soon after presented by the said Duke to the rectory of Lutterworth, in the county of Leicester, and diocese of Lincoln.</P>
<P>The Roman Pontiff still persisted in disposing of ec∣clesiastical benefices to Italians, Frenchmen, and other aliens. The parliament frequently complained to the King, and the Pope, of this intolerable grievance, concerning which an embassy was sent to Avignon, but obtained no redress.</P>
<P>In 1374 the King apointed a commission for taking a survey of all the ecclesiastical benefices throughout

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="360" REF="399"/>the kingdom, that were in the hands of foreigners; the number and value of which greatly astonished him. Seven ambassadors were thereupon appointed (and one of them was Wickliffe) to treat with Pope Urban. These obtained his promise, that he would desist from the reservation of benefices; but that treaty the very next year was infracted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collins's Abridgment.</NOTE>. A long bill was brought into parliament against the Papal usurpations, remon∣strating that five times as much was paid to the Pope as to the King: and Dr. Wickliffe, now more sensi∣ble of the pride, avarice, ambition, and tyranny of the Pope than ever, made them the subject of his pub∣lic lectures; shewing, that God had given his sheep to the Pope to be pastured, but not fleeced; and even called him Antichrist.</P>
<P>But Wickliffe sufficiently felt the hatred and perse∣cution of those whom he endeavoured to reform. The monks complained to the Pope, that Wickliffe opposed his powers, and defended the royal supremacy.</P>
<P>This accusation highly incensed the Pope, and great∣ly alarmed the court of Rome; and Pope Gregory XI. sent forth several bulls against Wickliffe, dated May 22, 1377. One was directed to Simon Sudbury, Arch∣bishop of Canterbury, and William Courteney, Bishop of London, whom he delegated to examine into the matter of complaint; acquainting them, that Wick∣liffe had rashly asserted, and publickly preached, such detestable erroneous propositions as were contrary to the faith, and threatened to subvert and weaken the cause of the whole church. Another bull was directed to the Chancellor, Vice-chancellor, &amp;c. of the univer∣sity of Oxford. He thereby required them to cause Wickliffe to be apprehended and imprisoned by his authority. A third bull was sent to the King himself, requesting his patronage and assistance to the Bishops in the prosecution of Wickliffe.</P>
<PB N="361" REF="400"/>
<P>King Edward died before the said bull reached Eng∣land. The university treated their bull with contempt. The Duke of Lancaster, and Henry Piercy, Lord Mar∣shal, declared they would not suffer him to be impri∣soned, without the royal consent: however, the dele∣gated prelates issued forth their mandate to cite Wick∣liffe before them, within thirty days, at St. Paul's in London.</P>
<P>Before that day came, the first parliament of King Richard II. met at Westminster, where it was debated, whether they might lawfully refuse sending the trea∣sure out of the kingdom, which the Pope had demand∣ed on pain of censure. The matter was referred to Dr. Wickliffe, who answered, that it was lawful, and that he would prove it by the laws of Christ.</P>
<P>Wickliffe appeared to the summons of the delegated Bishops at St. Paul's, where a vast concourse of peo∣ple assembled to hear the examination. The Doctor was attended by the Duke of Lancaster, and the Lord Marshal, whose countenance contributed to his for∣titude; for the manner of their introducing him was rather like to a triumph than a trial. This piqued the Bishop of London, who told the Lord Marshal, if he had known what masteries they would have kept in the church, he would have stopped them from coming there.</P>
<P>When Wickliffe was ordered to attend to his charge, he stood up before the Commissioners, according to custom; but the Lord Marshal, then Earl of Northum∣berland, bid him sit down, as he had many things to answer, and had need of a soft seat to rest himself upon. The Bishop of London objected to it; but the Duke of Lancaster immediately replied, that he hoped shortly to bring down the pride of all the pre∣lates of the kingdom; and other irritating expressions were interchanged, which occasioned some commotion in the court. The Londoners declating they would resent any insults to their Bishop, the nobility, some∣what
<PB N="362" REF="401"/>intimidated by their menaces, thought proper to retire with Wickliffe; and the court broke up, with∣out proceeding any farther than enjoining silence to the Doctor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 92 of this volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Duke of Lancaster being at this time President of the Council, the Bishops were afraid to offend the avowed protector of Wickliffe. However, the pre∣lates summoned the Doctor before them a second time at Lambeth; where he attended, and professing a de∣sire to give them any reasonable satisfaction, delivered a paper, explaining the several articles with which he was charged<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The three capital positions which gave the greatest offence, were, That dominion was founded on grace; that the temporal power might seize on the patrimony of the church; and that no ecclesiastic ought to be vested with a coercive power.</NOTE>: but this was not so ample and clear as they expected or required. In the midst of their deli∣berations, the Princess Dowager of Wales, Joan, the King's mother, sent Sir Lewis Clifford to them, to forbid their proceedings against Wickliffe, which great∣ly staggered the Bishops, who thereupon dismissed the Doctor, after imposing silence upon him. To this in∣junction, however, he paid no regard, and maintained his opinions with the utmost steadiness.</P>
<P>The King was crowned on July, 13, 1377, and the parliament joined several Noblemen and Bishops with the Duke of Lancaster in the regency, during the King's minority. This in some measure gave a check to the Wickliffites and Lollards.</P>
<P>But the death of Pope Gregory XI. (the successor of Urban V.) which happened on the 27th of March 1378, was a great advantage to Dr. Wickliffe, as the commission of delegates then terminated. A schism then ensued by an election of two Popes, viz. Urban VI. and Clement VII. since Urban was not acknow∣ledged by the kingdom to be lawful Pope for the space of a year. On this occasion Wickliffe wrote a tract on

<P>Many of the nobility and clergy adhered to the opi∣nions of Wickliffe, and some of the latter defended him in the convocation. Dr. Hereford took a jour∣ney to Rome, and offered, in a consistory before the Pope, to defend the conclusions lately condemned by the Archbishop, who committed him to prison on his return to England. That primate ordered the con∣demnation of Dr. Wickliffe's opinions to be published in the university; whereupon the Doctor declined, or was excluded from his professorship, and retired to Lutterworth, where he still vindicated his doctrine, and justified his followers.</P>
<P>The next year, 1383, the Pope summoned him to appear at Rome<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Knighton.</NOTE>, and answer for his heresies. Wick∣liffe returned a letter of excuse to the citation, wherein he told the Pope, <Q>Christ taught him more obeishe “”to God than to man.</Q> The Doctor about this time was seized with the palsy, and many of his friends thought this would ere long terminate in his death. Proceedings against him for the present dropt, and he was even permitted to spend the remainder of his days in tranquillity at Lutterworth: but these were but few; for, in 1384, on Innocents day, he was seized with another sit of the palsy, as he was hearing mass in his church, and he fell down and expired in the sixtieth year of his age. He was buried there; but the coun∣cil of Constance having, on May 5, 1415, condemned his doctrines as heretical and erroneous, pronounced him and his memory accursed, and decreed that his bones should be dug up and burnt, and then scattered
<PB N="367" REF="406"/>about with infamy, Pope Martin V. in 1428, sent or∣ders to Richard Fleming, Bishop of Lincoln, to cause the sentence be executed; and that prelate's officers having taken up the body, burnt it to ashes, which they threw into the rivulet Swift.</P>
<P>Such was the fate of the greatest reformer that this age can boast of, who seems to have been placed as much above praise as he is justly above calumny. He had carefully studied all the parts of theological learn∣ing, and was endued with an uncommon gravity and sanctity of manners; from whence arose that vehement endeavour of restoring the primitive purity in doctrine and manners in that ignorant and degenerate age. But as some authors have depreciated the character of this great man, we shall subjoin the following testimonial given of him by the university of Oxford in 1406<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wood's Hist. Univ. Oxford, p. 460.</NOTE>, signed with the common seal, wherein it is said, that "his conversation, from his youth to his death, was so praise-worthy and honest in the university, that he never gave any offence, or was he aspersed with any mark of infamy or sinister suspicion; but that in an∣swering, reading, preaching, and determining, he be∣haved himself laudably, as a valiant champion of the truth, and catholickly vanquished, by sentences of holy scripture, all such as by their <HI>wilful beggary</HI> blasphemed the religion of Christ: that Dr. Wickliffe was never convicted of heretical pravity, nor by our prelates de∣livered to be burnt after his burial; for God forbid that our prelates should have condemned a man of so great probity for an heretic, who had not his equal in all the university, in his writings of logic, philosophy, divinity, morality, and the speculative sciences."</P>
<P>His writings were indeed very many, an instance of his assiduity in studies, of which Bishop Bale has given a particular account, in all 255 tracts, some of which are still to be seen in the Bodleian and Cottonian libra∣ries,
<PB N="368" REF="407"/>as well as in the libraries of the two universities, where is also preserved his translation of the Bible into English, according to the purity of the language at that time, which may seem very uncouth to modern ears, the word <HI>knave</HI> being there used for servant, and <HI>gelding</HI> for eunuch.</P>

<P>ENGLAND had long felt the impositions and tyranny of the church of Rome; and many, both in church and state, saw it was high time that such exorbitant power should be lessened or abolished, tho' such were the occurring difficulties, that it was hard to effect it.</P>
<P>The indolence and devotion of Henry VI. had been, in a considerable degree, prejudicial to the independen∣cy of the state, and the true interest of the church of England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rolt's History of the first Reformers. Introduction to Burnet's History of the Reformation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Edward IV. paid a slavish complaisance to the court of Rome and the clergy, as he had found their friend∣ship necessary to support his disputed title to the crown.</P>
<P>Richard III. also was served by the clergy, to whom he subjected himself beneath royal dignity.</P>
<PB N="369" REF="408"/>
<P>Henry VII. from false principles, or private views, favoured, or at least connived at, several extraordi∣nary methods practised by the Pope to draw money out of the kingdom; and friendship, interest, fear, or careless indifference, had rivetted Popish fetters upon the English, till the more penetrating and judicious, or the more oppressed and conscientious, roused in a great degree the English nation from their lethargy; and those of high, as well as the lower rank, saw it was high time to attempt a reformation in earnest.</P>
<P>Indeed the Kings and parliaments had, at certain opportunities, given many successful blows to the Pa∣pal power in England: and the doctrines of Wickliffe, Colet, and other reformers, even before a general re∣formation was practicable, had disposed the minds of the people for it.</P>
<P>The grand and most successful attempt for comple∣ting this important work is generally attributed to King Henry VIII. how justly, every judicious reader will in some measure judge.</P>
<P>Indeed there were many transactions in this King's reign that were eminently subservient to a <HI>reformation;</HI> but none gave so effectual a blow to Papal power as his erecting himself into the head of the English church: but even this is said to owe its rise entirely to political views, and not to any previous design or good plea∣sure of the King towards a reformation. This signal act is therefore spoken of in very different terms by many historians.</P>
<P>Mons. Peter Jurieu, in his history of the council of Trent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 41.</NOTE>, says, when the Pope by his sentence declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine good and valid, March 24, 1535, the King took the alarm, and said, "Let the Pope be Bishop of Rome; for my part, I'll be master within my own kingdom;" and issued a pro∣clamation, wherein he declared himself <HI>head of the

<P>M. Bossuet, in his History of the Variation of Pro∣testant churches, says, that King Henry VIII. was a Prince endued with rare qualities of body and mind; but that he seemed so sensible of his great abilities, that he thought himself qualified for a superior under∣taking than the mere regal government on the civil establishment; and therefore declared himself head of the church, which began the Reformation in Eng∣land<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bossuet's Variations, vol. i. b. vii. p. 354.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And it is usual amongst the generality of our Eng∣lish historians and biographers, to characterise him as a principal reformer; of which the following memoirs, or most remarkable transactions of his life, will afford the reader the best rule of judgment. But it is an observation of Lord Herbert, that it is not easy to write that Prince's history, of whom no one thing can constantly be affirmed but a change of manners; and that it is impossible to draw his picture well, who hath several countenances<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Preface to King Henry's Life.</NOTE>. But I would not farther anti∣cipate the subject, much less prepossess the mind of the reader.</P>
<P>King Henry VIII. was born at Greenwich on June 28, 1491. He very early appeared to be of an active, warm spirit; and the advantage of an academical education, in many of the abstruse parts of learning, gave him such an opinion of himself, that it had too much influence on the actions of his life. He suc∣ceeded to the crown as the indisputably lawful and rightful heir at the age of eighteen. King Henry VII. in 1503, had affianced him to the Princess Catherine of Arragon<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See before, p. 346.</NOTE>, his brother's widow. When the coun∣cil
<PB N="371" REF="410"/>deliberated about the consummation, William War∣ham, Archbishop of Canterbury, objected to it as in∣cestuous; but the King being inclined for the match, the nuptial ceremony was performed on June 3, 1500, within two months after his accession. He continued to live with Catherine till 1525, and had three chil∣dren by her, without declaring any scruple about his marriage: but the appearance of Ann Bulleyn at court gave a sudden turn to his mind; and he began to think of a divorce from his Queen, and of being married to this admired favourite.</P>
<P>But to return: King Henry began his reign like a wise Prince, by acquainting himself with the state and connection in which England stood with other powers in Europe, that he might the better judge of his in∣terest, and the proper measures by which to pursue it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert's Life of King Henry VIII. p. 10.</NOTE>.<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>A. D. 1510.] Sometime being spent this way, it was thought fit for many reasons, but especially for the sa∣tisfaction of his subjects, to call a parliament; which accordingly convened on January 21. In the beginning of the session, Empsom and Dudley were condemned by attainder, for their oppressive methods of extorting money from the people during the preceding reign of Henry VII. and the King not only gave his royal assent to that act, but likewise to divers laws to se∣cure the properties of his subjects. His Majesty, to avoid his being suspected of the covetous disposition to amass wealth, with which his father was so much charged, became the most magnificent in his expence of any Prince in Christendom, and bountiful to all about him: but in order to avoid one extreme, he fell into another<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet's History of the Reformation, vol. i. p. 2.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The indulgences granted by Pope Leo became now a subject of serious consideration to many<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See page 114 of this volume.</NOTE>, who saw, with concern, to what excess it was carried; for as learning became more general through the benesit of printing, there were sundry persons who began to en∣quire into the principles of religion; of whom Mar∣tin Luther, at Wittenberg upon the Elbe, seems to have most distinguished himself. Neither did there want such as opposed those indulgences in England; urging, that not only sins against God, but against the laws, were compounded for at easy rates; and ob∣served to some of the principal clergy, that punish∣ments were the prerogative of the King; that it was, therefore, invading his sovereign authority; opening a door to licentiousness; as none would be afraid of transgressing a law, the guilt and punishment of which they could clear themselves of on paying a small sti∣pend; and that consequently it was dissolving those bonds which knit and hold societies together, both civil and religious. They advised them not to make the terms of salvation mercenary, by deceitfully pretend∣ing to remit the guilt and punishment of sin, which is attended with such fatal mischief.</P>
<PB N="376" REF="415"/>
<P>Luther, with great zeal and assiduity, censured and exploded not only the indulgences granted by the Pope, but publickly in his lectures and writings exposed pur∣gatory, penance, and many other of the errors of the Romish church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 115 of this volume.</NOTE>. On the 18th of August, he was summoned to appear at Rome before Pope Leo, who dispersed letters, at the same time, to many of the Princes of Europe, exhorting them to discountenance those heresies and their abettors.</P>
<P>A.D. 1519. Ulricus Zuinglius appeared about this time at Zurich, and favoured Luther in many things<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 110 of ditto.</NOTE>. A letter likewise from Erasmus<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See page 123.</NOTE> did much encourage him; assuring him he had many favourers in the LOW Countries, but many more in England, and that too among the principal persons; but advising him to pro∣ceed with modesty and circumspection. Philip Me∣lancthon<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See page 144.</NOTE> also, a pious and learned man, did many ways second Luther, who took courage to inveigh against the papal authority, images in churches, celi∣bacy of the priests, &amp;c. This, while it obtained him fame among some, gained him many enemies; and he was cited again to appear before the Pope; which he had wifely and cautiously avoided hitherto, by appeal∣ing to a general council; but nevertheless wrote a let∣ter to the Pope.</P>
<P>Maximilian I. dying on January 22, this year, Luther had some respite till the election of his suc∣cessor.</P>
<P>On April 4, in Passion week, this year, six men and a woman were burnt at Coventry. The Bishop of Lincoln was also a cruel persecutor of many who were suspected of heresy in his diocese: several of them ab∣jured, and some were burnt.</P>
<P>Upon the death of the Emperor Maximilian, the Sovereigns of France and Spain openly declared them∣selves
<PB N="377" REF="416"/>competitors for the imperial throne; and the King of England, who had been flattered, in 1517, with the hopes of attaining that dignity, also tried his interest among the electors; but his application was ineffectual, and the Spanish Monarch was elected, in the room of his grandfather, by the name of Charles V. This produced a variance between the new Em∣peror and his rival Francis I. who both deemed the friendship of Henry necessary to the success of their respective designs; and as they knew that he was ab∣solutely ruled by the passions and caprice of his mini∣ster, they courted the good graces of Wolsey with the utmost assiduity. Besides presents and pensions offered to this minion, they vied with each other in caressing him with the grossest adulation, calling him, in their letters, their Friend, their Patron, and their Father; and extolling his virtue, prudence, and capacity, in the most hyperbolical expressions. The Cardinal cun∣ningly made use of these testimonies, not only to flat∣ter his master's vanity, by representing how formidable he must be to those two potentates, who stooped so low as to court the favour of his servant, but likewise to enhance his own merit in the opinion of his Sovereign, who could not help observing, that Wolsey's parts must be greatly superior to those of all the other cour∣tiers, when thus acknowledged by the greatest Princes of Christendom. Henry actually looked upon himself as the arbiter of Europe; and remained so fully con∣vinced of the Cardinal's capacity, that he saw nothing but with his eyes, and was in every thing directed solely by his advice. Wolsey had now attained the highest summit of fortune: he was Favourite, Prime∣minister, Lord High Chancellor, Administrator of the See of Bath and Wells, Archbishop of York, Car∣dinal, and Legate <HI>à latere.</HI> He received annual pen∣sions from the Emperor and the King of France; drew immense profits from the office of chancellor, by means of privileges lately annexed to it: and the King
<PB N="378" REF="417"/>not only loaded him with rich presents, but also fur∣nished him with a great number of opportunities to in∣crease his revenues. The Pope, the Emperor, the King of France, and the republic of Venice, courted his good graces with the utmost emulation: and the French Monarch in particular sent him letters-patent, consenting, that he should regulate the ceremonial of the interview agreed on between him and the King of England, in a late treaty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 394.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Wolsey was so intoxicated with this flow of prospe∣rity, that his pride and arrogance surmounted all bounds. He could no longer bear equality in his le∣gation; and therefore prevailed upon the Pope to recal Cardinal Laurentius Campejus, who had been some time before joined in that office with him, and leave him invested with the sole legatine power. He then cele∣brated mass as if he had been Pope in reality, attended by Bishops and Dukes, and Earls presented him with the water and towel. He ordered the cross of York, and another for his legatine function, to be carried before him by two of the tallest priests that could be found. He erected a new court of judicature, called <HI>The Legate's court;</HI> in effect a court of conscience, that almost took cognizance of all the actions of life: and one John Allen, who was appointed judge of this tri∣bunal, acted with intolerable rapacity and extortion, on pretence of reforming the morals of the people. He pretended that his jurisdiction extended to all suits arising from wills, and contracts of marriage; and tried an infinite number of causes, whilst the King's judges durst not oppose this innovation. At the same time, the Cardinal Legate disposed of all the benefices of the kingdom in favour of his own creatures, without pay∣ing the least regard to the rights of churches, monaste∣ries, or patrons. Archbishop Warham, at length, from a motive of conscience, informed the King of
<PB N="379" REF="418"/>this oppression: and Henry, not only seemed surprised at the Cardinal's insolence, but desired the old Pri∣mate to tell him, that he expected he would reform all those abuses. This remonstrance produced no other effect, than that of augmenting Wolsey's hatred to the Archbishop. However, Allen, his agent, being af∣terwards accused by one John London, a simple priest, the complaint reached the ears of the King, who re∣primanded the Cardinal with such severity, that he was more circumspect in the sequel *.</P>
<P>The great wealth, power, and authority which he enjoyed in England, could not satisfy his ambition, while there was one degree of ecclesiastical dignity which he had not yet attained. He had already begun to take measures for obtaining the papacy, upon the first vacancy; and the King of France had assured him of the votes of fourteen Cardinals: but since Charles V. was chosen Emperor, Wolsey seemed to think that Prince more capable of raising him to the pontifical chair (though he was disappointed on the death of Leo X. in 1521, when the Emperor's tutor, Adrian VI. was elected) and began gradually to wean his master from the interest of France, and engage him in behalf of the house of Austria. Nevertheless, he would not declare himself so far as to prevent the intended in∣terview between Henry and Francis; because he could not prevail upon himself to resign the pleasure of ap∣pearing at the French court, with all the pomp of ec∣clesiastical magnificence, and of making his country∣men witnesses, of the honours and caresses with which he expected to be treated, on that occasion, by the Gallic Monarch. However, he was resolved to take such measures as would hinder Francis from turning the interview to the prejudice of the Emperor, who at this period gained an incredible accession of wealth,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 396.</NOTE> by the
<PB N="380" REF="419"/>prowess of Fernando Cortez, in his conquest of the Mexican empire<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 397.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1520.] The ceremonial of the interview being regulated by Wolsey, the King repaired, about the end of May, to Canterbury, in order to pass his Whit∣suntide there, and from thence proceed to Calais: but next day he was informed, that his Imperial Majesty was landed at Dover. The King was surprised at Charles's arrival, which had been preconcerted between that Prince and the Cardinal, to whom he had pro∣mised his influence with the Pope towards procuring him the bishopric of Badajox. Wolsey was sent to compliment the Emperor at Dover, where the King waited on him next day, and conducted him to Can∣terbury; whither also the Queen came to visit her nephew, whom she had never seen. Charles's inten∣tion, in this excursion, was to divert Henry from his purposed interview with Francis: in which, however, he did not succeed, as the King of England thought he could not recede with honour; but, in all proba∣bility, he gained the Cardinal entirely over to his in∣terest, by promising to support his designs upon the Papacy; and Henry assured him, that he would never engage with the French King in any measure that should be prejudicial to his Imperial Majesty. After having been splendidly entertained during the holidays, he embarked at Sandwich for Flanders, very well satisfied with the success of his visit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. v. p. 398.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The same day the King of England sailed from Dover to Calais;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Magnificent in∣terview between Henry <HI>VIII.</HI> and Francis.</NOTE> and, on June 4, removed with his own Queen, his sister Mary, Queen Dowager of France, and all his retinue, to a superb wooden house, erected near the place of interview. It was furnished in the most ostentatious manner; and

<P>On July 10, the King of England returned the Emperor's compliment by visiting him and his aunt Margaret, the Archduchess, at Gravelines; and next day they accompanied him back to Calais, where, af∣ter being royally entertained, both courts set out for their respective dominions.</P>
<P>A. D. 1521.] Luther's doctrine prevailing almost in every district of Germany, the Emperor assembled a diet at Worms, to which that reformer was summon∣ed, and appeared; but refusing to retract his tenets, was, with his favourers, proscribed by public edict. It then became fashionable for every zealous Papist to draw the pen against him: and the King of England imagined he could give no better proof of his zeal and learning, than by joining in the number; to which he conceived himself not a little provoked by Luther's having spoken contemptuously of Thomas Aquinas, an author of great repute both with the King and Car∣dinal. Henry, therefore, compiled a book, intitled, <HI>De Septem Sacramentis,</HI> wherein he strenuously opposes Luther in point of indulgences, number of sacraments, papal authority, and other particulars, in which that reformer had opposed the church of Rome; a copy of which performance, richly bound, was sent to Leo. Lord Herbert says, the manner of delivery was upon record, and which he himself had seen in the Vatican library; and therefore relates as follows: "Dr. John Clarke, Dean of Windsor, our King's Ambassador, appearing in full consistory, the Pope, knowing the glorious present he brought, first gave him his foot and then his cheeks to kiss: then receiving the book, he promised to do as much for the approbation thereof to all Christian Princes, as was ever done for St. Augus∣tin's
<PB N="383" REF="422"/>or St. Jerom's works; assuring him withal, that in the next consistory he would bestow a public title on the King, expressive of his applause of such distin∣guishing merit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Transcript of the bull granted on this occasion, with the title of <HI>Defender of the Faith,</HI> is to be seen at large in Lord Hei∣bert's History, p. 95.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the other hand, many of the books wrote by Luther, and others in Germany, were translated into the English tongue; which many in England were dis∣posed to read, and of consequence saw the justice of many of the objections made to the principles and practices of the Roman church.</P>
<P>This quickened the proceedings against the Lollards; and the enquiry became so severe, that great numbers were entangled in the toils of the Bishops and Com∣missaries. If a man spoke against the constitution of the church, or taught his children the Lord's prayer in English, with the creed, &amp;c. it was thought crime enough to bring them to the stake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox.

<P>A. D. 1523.] The King having been, in the prece∣ding year, involved in a needless war against France, in favour of the Emperor, by the intrigues of Wol∣sey, had attempted to raise money by oppressive means; and finding these disagreeable to the people, and unsuccessful, convened a parliament on April 15, when the Cardinal took care that the spiritual should have the lead. The business of subsidy was brought into the convocation first, where it was opposed by Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester, John Fisher, Bi∣shop of Rochester, and one Philips: but Wolsey silen∣cing some, and dismissing others, the rest, intimidated by his great power and vindictive disposition, agreed that one half of all ecclesiastical revenues should be granted, payable in five years. From thence the Car∣dinal went to the house of Commons, where, in an

<PB N="383" REF="424"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="384" REF="425"/>elegant oration, he harangued the members upon the injuries which he alledged the King had received from the French monarch, and the necessity of engaging in a war against that Prince; and concluded with asking one fifth of all lay effects, payable in four years. This extraordinary demand, though inforced by Sir Tho∣mas More, the Speaker, met with great opposition: yet at last the Commons resolved, that every man pos∣sessed of 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and upwards of yearly rent should pay 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> in the pound; the rest, possessing above 2 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> should give 1 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> in the pound; and all under that sum, and above the age of sixteen, should be taxed at 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> a head, to be paid in two years. Wolsey, incensed at their rejecting his proposal, repaired to the house, and desired to hear their reasons for refusing his demands: but they answered, that they never argued in presence of strangers; and he retired, extremely chagrined at his repulse. However, the Commons, to manifest their zeal for his Majesty's service, voted a considerable addition to the subsidy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, 136. Smollet, vol. v. p. 415.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Wolsey was not so much mortified at this check from the Commons, as at his second disappointment with respect to the Papacy at the death of Adrian VI. who, to soothe the Cardinal for his being put by the Papal chair, prolonged his legation for five years, and bestowed upon him the rich bishopric of Durham, in lieu of the see of Bath and Wells, which he resigned. When Wolsey had notice of Adrian's decease, he de∣sired the King to write a letter with his own hand to the Emperor, recommending him in the strongest manner to the Papal dignity; but Charles had before taken his measures in favour of Julius de Medicis, who was elected Pope, and assumed the name of Clement VII.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See page 351 of this volume.</NOTE>. Though the English Cardinal affected to bear his disappointment with a good grace, his heart pro∣bably
<PB N="385" REF="426"/>glowed with revenge against the Emperor, which he then thought proper to dissemble. However, he was somewhat consoled by Clement's conferring on him a perpetual grant of the legatine power, which had never been given for life upon any other occa∣sion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In this year, the college of Physiciars in London was instituted, and endowed with divers privileges, by Henry VIII.; and Christian II. King of Sweden and Denmark, who had been expelled for his cruelty and oppression, visited the court of England, whence he was dismissed with some valuable presents. About the same time, Luther published an answer to the King of England's performance, and gave such offence to that Prince by his acrimonious stile, that Henry com∣plained to the Saxon Princes of Luther's insolence, and desired them to prohibit him from publishing a translation of the Bible in the High Dutch language: but his remonstrance produced very little effect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1524.] Wolsey having thus, by the favour of the King and the Pope, obtained a kind of papal authority in England, he exerted it to the full, both with respect to civil and ecclesiastical affairs; presum∣ing himself safe, while he was pursuing every method to supply the King with money to serve the purposes of his pleasure and grandeur. Something of this ap∣peared in his design to build and endow two colleges, one at Oxford, and the other at Ipswich, the place of his nativity, and have them put under such regulations as his Majesty and he should think proper. To facilitate this design, letters were sent to the Pope, intimating, that the invention of printing had been the means of introducing many heretical books, and of the great increase of heresy; and that common people could now read the scriptures, and understand prayers, in their native language, which tended to a disparage∣ment of the clergy. To prevent these and such like consequences, it was humbly proposed to the pontiff, that the erecting of colleges, and placing persons of letters as public prosessors therein, would be the best expedient. This was highly approved by the Pope, and permission given to suppress some of the mona∣steries,
<PB N="386" REF="427"/>as there was great want of learned persons in them, and apply their revenues to the building of the two colleges. Little more was necessary for the Cardi∣nal, than to represent to the King how fit it was that so learned a Prince should promote literature, and maintain that faith whereof the Pope had made him defender. Yet, because the wars had so much ex∣hausted his treasures, he would ask no more than li∣berty to dissolve some few unnecessary religious houses, and bestow the revenues to this use. King Henry, it is said, very cordially acceded thereto, as he should be able to make some farther incroachments of that kind, to gratify his own lust of power and authority<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An abstract from Lord Herbert, p. 146, 147, 148.</NOTE>. The King thus concurred with the Pope, who in favour of the Cardinal gave way to this suppression, which was afterwards pursued by the King's sole authority, and became the final ruin of the other monasteries.</P>
<P>A. D. 1525.] Cardinal Wolsey, who, by a con∣currence of papal and regal authority, had suppressed about forty monasteries, struck the rest with so great terror, that he drew from them several large sums of money; and between visitations, making of abbots, licences, dispensations, and many other ways, besides pensions from foreign princes, &amp;c. &amp;c. his treasury was thought equal to the King's. But this at last be∣came a public grievance; and his Majesty not approv∣ing all the Cardinal's measures, reproved him with such severity, that he was obliged to appease the King's in∣dignation with the most abject submission. Wolsey, having soon after furnished his fine palace at Hampton∣court, presented it to his Majesty, who gave him Richmond in exchange, together with the warmest as∣surances of uninterrupted affection.—This proud pre∣late, in revenge of the Emperor Charles V. having twice frustrated him of the triple crown, began to alienate his master from the interest of that Prince,
<PB N="387" REF="428"/>and when Francis I. King of France, was defeated and taken prisoner at the battle of Pavia, this year, by the Imperialists, he persuaded Henry to espouse the cause of Francis, who by that means, in a great measure, obtained his enlargement.</P>
<P>A. D. 1526.] Though hitherto little had been done, by public authority, to countenance and encourage a reformation, yet many privately favoured Luther's opinions; and several books of that new doctrine, as it was called, were brought over, translated into the English tongue, and read with great applause.—The memorable Mr. Tindal had the courage at this time to undertake a new translation of the New Testament into English, in which there are several valuable and pertinent notes interspersed. "This (says Bishop Burnet) was printed in the year 1526, against which there was a prohibition published by every Bishop in his diocese, asserting that some of Luther's followers had erroneously translated the New Testament, and had corrupted the word of God, both by a false trans∣lation and by heretical glosses; and therefore all were charged, that had any of these, to bring them in with∣in thirty days, under the pain of excommunication, and incurring the suspicion of heresy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">History of the Reformation, Part I. p. 32.</NOTE>. "</P>
<P>But this, and such like terrors, did not wholly ex∣tinguish the light that was breaking in upon this land: many kept their Testaments, and had other books of Tindal's writing; and even divers in the universities favoured the reformation, as Bilney, Lati∣mer, &amp;c. as also some societies in London, though they were not only branded with the infamous name of Lollards, but persecuted even unto death<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bennet's Memorial, p. 55.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With respect to the state of religion in Germany, it was much under the government of Luther, who, that he might in some greater degree extend his tenets in England, very artfully wrote an apology to our

This Luther took ex∣tremely ill, and was no small disappointment to him, especially as he had been encouraged, by Christian II. King of Sweden and Denmark, to think, that if King Henry was treated gently and with candour, he would become of the reformed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, p. 237.</NOTE>. Luther was then sorry that he had made any such flattering concessions, since they had no effect with his Majesty.</P>
<P>A. D. 1527.] About this time commenced that singu∣larly remarkable and interesting affair of the King's af∣fection for Anne Boleyn, and his resolution to solicit a divorce from his present Queen. We shall omit the his∣tory of her birth, her education, and her being introduced at court. It may suffice that she was of noble descent, and that her education, fortune, and beauty, introdu∣ced her to the regard of noblemen of the first rank. It is said she was contracted to Lord Piercy, which Cardinal Wolsey hearing of, and probably sensible of the King's secret passion for her, sought artfully and assiduously to put a check to<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Cavendish's Life of Wolsey.</NOTE>; in which he succeeded, upon assuring Piercy of the King's favour.</P>
<P>Some writers, in order to blacken the character of Henry, and tarnish the merit of the reformation in England, have represented the King's desire of sepa∣rating from Queen Catherine as proceeding rather from his passion for Anne Boleyn, than from any real scruples of conscience. They have likewise, with great virulence, endeavoured to depreciate her person and morals; have fallen into divers inconsistencies, which have been detected and exposed by Lord Herbert, and other authors of credit, who have proved that Henry was
<PB N="389" REF="432"/>determined to sue for a divorce, before Anne Boleyn returned to England from France, where she had been educated. The King had an ingredient of superstition in his character, and he imputed the death of his two sons to the divine vengeance for marrying his brother's widow: and was extremely desirous of male issue, to prevent all disputes about the succession. He was startled at a doubt made by the Bishop of Tarbes, in France, about the legitimacy of his daughter Mary: and being a Prince of impetuous passions, longed to be united with a lady of more endearing qualifications, than his present Queen, who was not mistress of many personal attractions. His scruples, which are ascribed to the writings of Thomas Aquinas, were encouraged by Wolsey, who hated Catherine, on account of her disapproving his licentious manner of life, and was equally incensed against her nephew, the Emperor, for having twice baffled him in his views upon the papacy. The Emperor's power was then formidable to all Europe; and Henry thought that he could not find a more favourable conjuncture to sue for a di∣vorce; for which, very probably, Anne Boleyn's charms made him the more impatient.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, the King got a declaration under the hands of all the English prelates, except John Fisher Bishop of Rochester, declaring his marriage with Catherine unlawful: and having concerted the plea upon which his divorce was to be solicited, sent Dr. Knight, secretary of state, to negotiate it with Pope Clement VII. then prisoner to the Emperor. Gregorio Casali, the English ambassador extraordinary at Rome, had instructions from Wolsey, dated De∣cember 28, to second the endeavours of Dr. Knight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an abstract of them in Bishop Burnet's History, p. 45.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1528.] The Cardinal also wrote to the Pope, urging that the affair might be dispatched, as it was so necessary to the safety and quiet of this nation, which was so zealously devoted to the apostolic see. Our

<P>The divorce of the King was now a political af∣fair; and much anxiety attended the success of it. The common people, in general, pitied Queen Ca∣therine, and envied Anne Boleyn: the King, how∣ever, to prevent any murmurings among the people, protested in an assembly of Lords, "that nothing but the desire of giving satisfaction to his conscience, and care of establishing the succession to the crown in a right line, had induced him to controvert his marriage."</P>
<P>However, about the middle of May this year, the King understanding a strict league was preserved be∣tween the Pope and the Emperor, determined, with∣out relying any longer on either of their promises, to take the best course he could for the conclusion of his own business, as he found that things grew rather more unpromising from the evasions of the Pope and the Emperor. Henry also, being informed of it by several letters from Rome, gave orders to recall his envoys; though he sent William Bennet, Doctor of Law, thither, to hinder the advocation of the cause; using, at the same time, ways and means to intercept all dispatches from Campejus to Rome, and from Rome to him, or any other principal party. The King charged the two Cardinals to proceed; whereof public notice was given; the place appointed, viz. Black Friers, commonly called the parliament chamber, and May 31 fixed for hearing and determining the cause: when that day came, the Cardinals summoned the King and Queen to appear on the 18th of June; but at the meeting of the court then, the Queen's agents made exceptions to the authority of the le∣gates, which however were over-ruled. On the 21st the King and Queen appeared personally. Henry, when called upon, answered, Here: but the Queen, being cited, arose, and falling on her knees before the King, made a very pathetic speech to him; after
<PB N="392" REF="435"/>which rising up, she made a low reverence, and retired from the court, although the crier required her to stay. Her Majesty, being again summoned, appealed to the Pope, notwithstanding she had Archbishop Warham, Nicholas West Bishop of Ely, John Fisher Bishop of Winchester, and Henry Standish Bishop of St. Asaph, for her council. The Cardinals, with John Langland Bishop of Lincoln, John Clarke Bi∣shop of Bath, and John Islip Abbot of Westminster, proceeded according to their commission; and, upon the Queen's refusing to appear, pronounced her con∣tumacious. Then the legates drew up twelve articles, to be discussed by the examination of evidence. The King's council insisted chiefly on the consummation of Prince Arthur's marriage with Catherine; and in the course of their pleadings spoke so indecently, that the Bishop of Rochester signified his disapproba∣tion and disgust; for which he was checked by Wol∣sey, as presuming to interpose; and some severe alter∣cation passed between these two prelates. The evidence, however, produced many strong presumptions that Arthur had carnally known the Queen; though she herself declared, and swore, to the contrary. During this time, the Emperor's agents pressed the Pope to evoke the cause to Rome: and Campejus, on pretence of certain holidays there, adjourned the court to the 21st of October; from whence it is plain that this Cardinal improved all opportunities to do his master good service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, Hollinshed, Stow, Herbert, Smollet,</NOTE>. Wolsey's conduct, on this occasion, seems vastly strange, by yielding so far to the artifices of his colleague, as to abuse a master, who had heaped so many favours on him.</P>
<P>While the Emperor's suit for an evocation was in agitation, the Pope received the news that his treaty with that Prince had been concluded at Barcelona: and immediately, before the same was published, he
<PB N="393" REF="436"/>granted, on July 15, an evocation of the process, and sent away an express, notwithstanding of the English agents assuring him that such a step would certainly divest him of his spiritual dominion in England. In the bull of evocation Henry was cited to appear at Rome in forty days, with a denunciation of divers censures in case of refusal: but afterwards the Pope disowned those censures, and prolonged the citation till Christmas. Thus was Henry amused for two whole years; and, after having entertained hopes, which he thought well-grounded, of succeeding in his design, saw himself farther as it were from his journey's end than when he set out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acta Regia, p. 395.</NOTE>. As for the Pope, the main point of the divorce, I mean the right of the parties in religion and conscience, that was not what troubled his head, because he only had his own private interests in view; so that the reasons alledged on both sides were all to no purpose, and only served to gain time, which it was his interest to protract.</P>
<P>Henry did not think proper to obey the summons: nor was the Pope in great haste to push on the affair, being pleased to find that he had brought it to such a pass, that nothing could be done without him, espe∣cially as the Emperor's sentiments coincided with his own.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Cranmer's expedient con∣cerning the divorce.</NOTE> Sometime after, Henry, in his return from a tour he had made through some coun∣tries to amuse his impatience, and divert his chagrin, lay at Waltham-cross, in the house of Mr. Cressy, whose sons were under the tuition of Thomas Cranmer, a Doctor in Divinity, who had been Professor at Oxford, and lost his office on account of his being married. This clergyman, who favoured the doctrine of Luther, being urged, at supper, by Edward Fox and Stephen Gardiner, to give his sentiments of the divorce, proposed an expedient, with which the King was so pleased, when he was in∣formed
<PB N="394" REF="437"/>of it, that he was resolved to hear it From Cranmer's own mouth. The proposal was, that his Majesty should consult all the universities, theo∣logists, and civilians, in Christendom, concerning the dispensation of Julius II. for his marriage with Cathe∣rine; which, he said, would be attended with great advantage: for if the learned and the universities de∣termined that the dispensation was sufficient, the King's conscience would be thereby quieted; but if on the contrary the opinions of the universities were against the dispensation, the Pope would never ven∣ture to give any decision contrary to opinions so ge∣nerally received and approved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Fox and Gardiner mentioned this expedient to the King, he approved of it, saying, <HI>"Aye, now we have got the right sow by the ear."</HI></NOTE>. Henry was so well pleased with Cranmer's conversation, that he ordered him to follow the court, and made him his counsellor on all emergencies.</P>
<P>However well satisfied the King might be with this expedient of Dr. Cranmer, both he and Anne Bo∣leyn were no less offended at Cardinal Wolsey, as they imputed the miscarriage of the divorce to the back∣wardness with which he had acted in that affair. Henry, upon his return from the aforesaid tour, in October, commanded the Cardinal to resign the great seal, which was offered to Archbishop Warham; but he declining the offer, on account of his great age, it was given to Sir Thomas More, a gentleman of learning and integrity.</P>
<P>Campejus, dreading the consequences of his col∣league's disgrace, desired leave to return to Italy, which was readily granted: but before he embarked, the custom-house officers rummaged all his baggage, on pretence of searching for contraband goods; though it is supposed that they acted by the express directions of the King, who longed to have in his custody the de∣cretal bull, which Campejus had brought from Rome,
<PB N="395" REF="438"/>annulling Catherine's second marriage, but had been committed to the flames by order of the Pope, while he was negotiating with the Emperor. When Cam∣pejus complained of the officers behaviour as an out∣rage against a legate of the holy see, Henry told him, that the officers had done their duty; that he was sur∣prised at his assuming the character of legate, after his power and commission had been revoked; and still more surprised, that, being Bishop of Salisbury, he should be so ignorant of the laws of England, as to assume that quality without the King's permission. Campejus, intimidated by this answer, thought him∣self extremely happy in being allowed to depart with∣out further molestation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 464.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the same month, in which Cardinal Wolsey was deprived of the office of Lord Chancellor, Hales, the attorney-general, exhibited an information against him in the court of King's-Bench, accusing him of having violated the statute of premunire. The Car∣dinal confessed the indictment, pleaded ignorance of the statute, and submitted himself to his Majesty's clemency. He was declared out of the King's pro∣tection; his goods and chattels were forfeited to the crown; and his palace of York-house (afterwards known by the name of Whitehall) was seized for the King's use, together with all his rich furniture and prodigious wealth. This reverse of fortune humbled the imperious Cardinal, who had formerly dictated to his Sovereign: he petitioned the King for a pro∣tection for his person; and that was immediately granted, as well as a free pardon. He was restored to the Archbishopric of York, and see of Winchester; he retrieved of his own effects to the amount of six thousand pounds, in furniture, money, and plate; and received divers kind messages from the King and Anne Boleyn: so that Henry's aim at this juncture

<PB N="396" REF="441"/>was to humble the pride, but not to ruin the fortune, of his old favourite. These favourable sentiments, however, were not of long duration: his enemies now prevailed at court, and brought into the house of Lords an impeachment of high treason, in four and forty articles; importing, that he had abused his le∣gatine power, acted tyrannically in the office of Chan∣cellor, expedited divers orders of the utmost impor∣tance, and executed treaties without the King's know∣ledge and concurrence; that he had behaved despoti∣cally on many occasions, more like an eastern sovereign than an English minister; that he had practised ex∣tortion, bribery, and all manner of corruption; sought to equal, and even preferred, himself to his Majesty, by writing in orders and instructions, <HI>Ego &amp; Rex meus,</HI> I and my King; and that he had endangered his So∣vereign's health by breathing upon him, and whispering in his ear, when he knew himself deeply infected with the veneral distemper. These articles passed in the house of Lords, which was filled with his enemies; but among the Commons, he was so defended by Thomas Cromwell, one of the members, and formerly one of his domestics, with such strength of argument, that no act of treason could be proved against him, and the prosecution dropped. Wolsey manifested very little fortitude under his misfortune: he became ab∣ject and disconsolate, and at length sickened. The King's tenderness seemed to revive when he heard of the Cardinal's illness; he had formerly sent him a torquoise ring, as a testimony of his protection, which Wolsey received on the road to Winchester; and was so affected with that instance of royal goodness, that he alighted from his horse, and fell upon his knees in a transport of joy. His Majesty now sent him another present of a ruby, by his physician Dr. Butts, who assured him that the King was not angry with him in his heart, and that he should soon be convin∣ced of his affection. This kind message contributed,
<PB N="397" REF="442"/>in a great measure, to the recovery of the Cardinal, who obtained Henry's permission to reside, for the benefit of the air, at his former house at Richmond in Surry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 465.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1530.] During these transactions, the King of England was not unmindful of the divorce. The Queen had been for some time removed from court, where Anne Boleyn appeared in great splendor, governing the King by a nod, and having great re∣spect paid her by the nobility. Cranmer wrote a book in favour of the solicited divorce, and afterwards accom∣panied two ambassadors to Bologna, where they had audience of the Pope and the Emperor. Clement expressed a desire to give satisfaction to the English Monarch; but he durst not act without the consent of Charles, who was inflexible in the cause of his aunt Queen Catherine. About the same time, Henry sent learned men to consult the foreign universities; and those of Paris, Angers, Bourges, Orleans, Thoulouse, Bologna, Ferrara, and Padua, unanimously agreed, that the dispensation granted by Pope Julius II. being contrary to the law of God, the marriage of Henry with Catherine could not be valid. The English uni∣versities subscribed to the same opinion, though not without great opposition from the masters of arts, es∣pecially at Oxford, and a warm contest at Cambridge. This opposition arose from those who were averse to the Lutheran doctrine, which they apprehended would be countenanced by Anne Boleyn, in resent∣ment to the Roman pontiff<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. v. p. 469.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Henry, finding his application to Pope Clement ineffectual, prevailed upon divers of his prelates and nobility to send him a sharp remonstrance, by way of letter; in which, after having mentioned the obliga∣tions he owed to the King, the decision of so many l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arned universities, and the little regard that had been paid to them at the court of Rome, they gave
<PB N="398" REF="443"/>him notice, that, should he refuse to do justice in the affair of the divorce, they would conclude themselves abandoned by the see of Rome, and seek for other remedies. To this epistle, which was signed by Car∣dinal Wolsey, the primate of Canterbury, four Bishops, two Dukes, two Marquises, thirteen Earls, two Viscounts, three and twenty Barons, two and twenty Abbots, and eleven Commoners, Clement wrote an answer to justify his conduct. His apology was far from being admitted; and, in order to anticipate any step that might be taken in favour of Catherine, by the court of Rome, or the Cardinal, Henry issued a proclamation, forbidding all persons whatever to pur∣chase any thing from Rome, or elsewhere, that should be contrary to his royal prerogatives, or to divulge any thing of that nature, on pain of incurring his in∣dignation, and the penalties specified in the statutes of provisors and premunire. Then he ordered some learned men in the kingdom to collect, compare, and publish, all that had been or could be alledged in favour of the divorce, including the opinions of the univer∣sities, and a particular answer to a book, which Fisher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When King Henry wrote against Luther, and called in all his books, he granted a privilege for printing a treatise wrote by this prelate against the German reformers.</NOTE>, Bishop of Rochester, had written in defence of the marriage<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol, v. p. 470.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Cardinal Wolsey still continued fluctuating between hope and despair. He had, in the beginning of his disgrace, been reduced to great necessity, from which he was relieved by John Kite Bishop of Carlisle; but afterwards his affairs seemed to take a more favourable turn. He received a full pardon, considerable ap∣pointments, and kind messages from the King; and was permitted to sit in parliament among the Peers, though he had the mortification to see a bill pass con∣firming his own forfeiture to the King; and, among
<PB N="399" REF="444"/>others, his college at Oxford; at the fate of which he was more afflicted than any other circumstance of his misfortune. He wrote to his Majesty in the most humble strain, begging the foundation might continue, and sent a pathetic letter on the same subject to Crom∣well, who, for his fidelity to his late master, was re∣ceived into Henry's special favour: but no regard was paid to the Cardinal's importunity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This noble seminary was at first called <HI>Cardinal's college,</HI> then <HI>King's college,</HI> and last of all got the name <HI>Christ-church college,</HI> which it still retaineth. Wolsey's placing his own, above the royal, arms, on the gate of this structure, gave great umbrage to the King. John Higdon, the first Dean, was a great persecutor of the Wick∣liffites, several of whom he confined in a dungeon, where the salt fish of the college was usually kept. Church History, p. 143.</NOTE>. At length Anne Boleyn, and the rest of his enemies, thinking him too near the King, obtained an order for his removing from Richmond to his archbishopric of York. He obeyed this command, though not without great re∣luctance; and proceeded by slow journeys to Cawood∣castle, attended by a retinue of one hundred and twenty horsemen. Upon the road he distributed his alms and benediction with great liberality; and now for the first time began to be popular, the people crouding to see him, and ask his blessing, as he passed through the country. Not that he had entirely laid aside the thoughts of wordly grandeur. He intended to be installed, according to the ancient custom, with great solemnity; and began to make great prepara∣tions for that ceremony. Whilst he was thus employed, for the gratification of idle vanity, his adversaries exerted themselves so industriously, that, before the day appointed for the installation, he was, together with one Augustine his physician, arrested by the Earl of Northumberland, and Sir Walter Welch, for high treason. Wolsey betrayed marks of fear and disorder, when the Earl signified his errand; but, recovering his spirits a little, he protested that he would not
<PB N="400" REF="445"/>yield until he should see his commission, which his Lordship refused to produce; yet at the sight of Welch, whom he knew to be a gentleman of the King's privy chamber, he submitted. Augustine was im∣mediately hurried off to London in the most ignomi∣nious manner: but the Cardinal was indulged with some time to prepare for his journey, which he then began with an heavy heart. By the way he was deli∣vered by Northumberland to the care of the Earl of Shrewsbury, who told him that he was commanded to use him respectfully, as one whom the King highly favoured; and assured him, that though Henry found himself obliged to bring him to trial for the satisfac∣tion of some particular persons, he did not harbour the least doubt of his integrity. Such was his dejec∣tion, that his spirits and resolution him even failed after these assurances. He moved very slowly, and staid a whole fortnight at Sheffield-castle, where he was seized with a dysentery. There he was joined by Sir William Kingston, captain of the King's guard, and constable of the Tower, who came attended with four and twenty yeomen of the guard, formerly the Cardinal's servants. Sir William saluted Wolsey on the knee with a very gracious message from his Majesty, who desired he would make no more haste than stood con∣sistent with his convenience and health. But whether the Cardinal was conscious of having been engaged in some clandestine transactions with the Emperor and the Pope, or apprehended that his adversaries were bent upon his destruction, he remained disconsolate, notwithstanding all those encouraging addresses; and his distemper gained ground. Nevertheless, he pro∣ceeded on his journey, until he arrived at Leicester-abbey; where feeling his end approaching, he sent for Sir William Kingston, and spoke to this effect, "Had I served God as diligently as I have done the King, he would not have abandoned my grey heirs; but this is my just reward. I pray you commend me most
<PB N="401" REF="446"/>humbly to the King, desiring him to remember all that passed between us about Queen Catherine; and then his Grace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grace and Highness were the highest titles given to Kings at that time.</NOTE> may determine whe her or not I have given just cause of offence. He is a Prince of royal courage; but, than rather be thwarted in his pleasure, will run the risk of losing one half of his realm. I have often kneeled before him three hours successively, to dissuade him from his will and appetite, and could not prevail: therefore, master Kingston, if ever you be of his council, deliberate seriously upon what you in∣tend to advise; for, once he sets his heart upon any thing, he is not to be diverted from the pursuit." Then he discoursed upon the state of religion, wishing that his Majesty might take heed of the Lutherans, from the example of those of Bohemia, lest the secu∣lar power should be subverted by their practices. In the prosecution of this discourse, his speech failed him; and in a little time he expired. He was privately in∣terred in the abbey; and though the King seemed afflicted at his death, he did not fail to make enquiry about 1500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which he had lately borrowed, from different persons, to defray his necessary expences<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 471.</NOTE>. Such was the fate of Cardinal Wolsey, a churchman of some parts, intolerable pride, and unmeasurable ambition, who, though but the son of a butcher at Ipswich, had, by his intrigues, raised himself to such a pitch of power and grandeur, as no other ecclesiastic, under the degree of Pope, had ever possessed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Although Cardinal Wolsey expressed uncommon animosity against the doctrines of the Wickliffites and Lutherans, yet it appears from one of his letters to Fox Bishop of Winchester, that he was so sensible of the necessity of a reformation of the corruptions of the clergy, that he had formed a plan for that purpose: and Pope Adrian VI. is said to have been so well disposed in this particular, that the German princes were encouraged to present him with an hundred</NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="403" REF="448"/>
<P><GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/> them from a persecution with which they had been threatened. Cardinal Wolsey had been con∣victed of exercising the legatine power in England without a special licence from his Majesty, and in giv∣ing away benefices in that capacity, contrary to the statutes of provisors and premunire: consequently those, who acknowledged his authority, were acces∣sary to his transgression. This was the case of the whole body of the clergy, who were accordingly ac∣cused of having violated the laws of the kingdom. Such a prosecution answered the King's purpose in two respects: it not only furnished him with a pretence for extorting a large sum of money, but also hum∣bled the clergy in the eyes of the populace, and ren∣dered them more dependant on his pleasure. In vain they pleaded, that Henry himself had consented to the Cardinal's using the legatine function: they were con∣victed of the crime laid to their charge, and all their effects confiscated, to the inexpressible satisfaction of the subjects in general, who had long groaned under ecclesiastical tyranny. The clergy, seeing how low their credit was among the people, and the little re∣gard which the nation paid to papal authority, resol∣ved to submit, and to implore the King's pardon, for which they agreed to present him with 100,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> ster∣ling. A committee of the convocation of Canter∣bury being appointed to draw up this act and petition, some individuals, in the interest of the court, proposed, that, in this public act, the clergy should own the King as protector and supreme head of the English church. This proposal at first met with great opposition; and the consideration of it was referred till the next meet∣ing, when, by means of Archbishop Warham, Tho∣mas Cromwell, and others of the council, it was agreed, that the King should be stiled <HI>supreme head of the church,</HI> as far as was agreeable to the law of Christ. The convocation of the clergy, in the province of York, resolved also to present his Majesty with 18,800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>
<PB N="404" REF="449"/>for their remission: but, as in the act they did not own the King's supremacy, they were given to un∣derstand, that their gift would not be accepted; and they thought proper to follow the example of the other convocation in acknowledging the King their <HI>supreme head</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 476.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This acquisition of power and wealth satisfied Henry; and he indulged the delinquents with an ample pardon: but the Commons refused to pass the bill, unless the laity, who might be liable to the same prosecution, should be comprehended. His Majesty, being informed of this obstacle, sent a mes∣sage to the Commons, importing, that he was resol∣ved to be master of his own favours, which he would never grant upon compulsion; and the house, dread∣ing his displeasure, passed the bill without further op∣position. Then he favoured the laity with an act of amnesty; which did not, however, include colleges and monasteries; for these were afterwards obliged to pay for a composition. Henry soon after adjourned the parliament, and ordered the decisions and writings in favour of the divorce to be printed and published, that all his subjects might understand the case before the next session. As he passionately desired to obtain Catherine's consent to a separation, he sent several Bi∣shops and lay noblemen to persuade her to wave her appeal: and when they urged her to refer the cause to the decision of four ecclesiastics, and as many secu∣lars, she said "she would pray to God to send the King a quiet conscience, but she was his lawful wife, and would abide by her right, until the court of Rome should declare the contrary."</P>
<P>The humiliation of the Bishops was extremely agree∣able to the English, who then began openly to discuss controverted points of religion, but were often, by
<PB N="405" REF="450"/>their indiscreet zeal, hurried into the dangerous extre∣mities of libertinism or fanaticism. The prelates, in order to lighten the burden of the sum they had grant∣ed to their sovereign, were desirous that a part should be borne by the inferior clergy; and John Stokesley, Bishop of London, assembled some priests of that me∣tropolis in the chapter house of St. Paul's, to propose an assessment; hoping, that if he could obtain the cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of a few at first, the rest would follow their example. But all the London priests, being apprised of his intention, went thither in a tumultuous manner, accompanied by a great number of laymen: and when Stokesley made the proposal, they answered, they had never meddled with any of Cardinal Wolsey's faculties, and consequently had not incurred the premunire; that their livings were already too small for their subsistence; that as the guilt lay entirely among the Bishops and Abbots, they only ought to bear the punishment; that as for themselves, they had not transgressed and there∣fore would not pay for a pardon. They had already burst open the door, and committed divers irregula∣rities; and when the Prelate's officers threatened them with condign punishment, a sharp conflict ensued, in which Stokesley's servants having been very roughly handled, his Lordship dismissed the rioters with his blessing, assuring them that they should not be called in question for the disturbance. Nevertheless, he complained to the Chancellor, by whose order fifteen priests, and five laymen, were committed to prison: but whether the inferior clergy paid any part of the composition, is not ascertained. King Henry, alarm∣ed at this tumult, resolved to convince his people, that, though he had shaken off the Papal yoke, his intention was not to violate the essentials of the established church; and therefore ordered the laws against heretics to be rigorously executed; an or∣der which was attended with the death of two eccle∣siastics,
<PB N="406" REF="451"/>and a lawyer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was James Bainham, a gentleman of the Middle-Temple, who having on a former occasion been taken up, was put in a pri∣son in Sir Thomas More's house, and whipped at a tree in his gar∣den, called <HI>the tree of truth.</HI> Because he would not accuse his ac∣quaintances of the Temple, nor discover where his books were con∣cealed, he was sent to the Tower, and there so racked, that he be∣came lame.

On the succeeding Sunday he went to St. Austin's church, with the <HI>New Testament</HI> in English in his hand, and <HI>The obedience of a Christian man</HI> in his bosom; and there with tears declared before the people, that he had denied God, and prayed them to forgive and beware of his weakness.

<P>A. D. 1532.] Notwithstanding this severity, the King of England, and his ally Francis I. of France, resolved to support the Protestants in Germany, in or∣der to oppose the growing power of the house of Au∣stria. Francis concluded an agreement with the Lu∣theran Princes, who formed the league of Smalcalde, and persuaded the English Monarch to assist them with 50,000 crowns, which were remitted by the hands of the French ambassador, as a sum to be employed for the defence and conservation of the rights and privi∣leges of the empire.</P>
<P>Mean time Henry was attentive to the internal state of his kingdom. He reassembled the parliament in January; when the Commons, having been previously instructed by the court, presented an address, beseech∣ing him to consent to the reformation of sundry abuses which had crept into the immunities enjoyed by the clergy. The King answered, that, before he could a∣ssent to a proposal of such importance, he would hear what the ecclesiastics had to say in their own defence. This step was taken to shew them, as they were odi∣ous to the parliament, how much they needed his royal
<PB N="407" REF="452"/>protection. Several statutes were enacted, which slight∣ly touched upon the privileges of the clergy; though they were abundantly consoled for these mortifications, by an act releasing them from the payment of <HI>annates</HI> to the Pope, which had ever been a heavy burden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This famous statute imported, that since the reign of the late King, above 160,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> had been sent to Rome, on account of an∣nates or first-fruits, palls and bulls for bishoprics: that the annates had been originally intended as a contribution for a war against the infidels; but as they were not employed for that purpose, it was en∣acted, that they should not be paid for the future: that not above five <HI>per cent.</HI> of the actual revenue should be paid for the bulls of bishoprics: that in case of the Pope's refusing to grant them on these conditions, the Bishop elect should be presented by the King to the metropolitan of the province, by whom he should be conse∣crated: but, should the Archbishop refuse consecration, on pre∣tence that he himself had not as yet received his bull or pall, two prelates nominated by the King should perform the ceremony; and then the elect should be deemed lawfully consecrated.</NOTE>. The parliament declared, that it should be in the King's power to annul or confirm this statute within a certain time. If, in that interval, he should make an ac∣commodation with the court of Rome, it should be deemed inviolable: but, should the Pope, on account of such accommodation, pretend to harrass the kingdom with sentences of excommunication and interdict, these censures should be held as null and void; all ecclesi∣astics were forbid to publish them, and ordered to ce∣lebrate divine service, as if they had never been issued<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. vi. p. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About this period, the King received a letter from the Pope, intimating that he had heard of putting a∣way his Queen, and keeping another person, called Anne, as his wife, to the great scandal of his charac∣ter, and contempt of the holy apostolic see, before which the suit of the divorce was still depending: he therefore exhorted him to take back Queen Catherine, and dismiss the said Anne; and in so doing, he would avoid a rupture with the Emperor, who would never otherwise digest such an indignity as he had put upon
<PB N="408" REF="453"/>his aunt, and prevent an interruption in the union of Christendom. It does not appear that Henry sent a particular answer to this epistle: but he dispatched Dr. Bennet to Rome in quality of ambassador, to lay be∣fore Clement the decisions and opinions of universities and learned men touching the divorce. Bennet was also charged with a letter, in which the King taxed the Pontiff with ignorance, partiality, and deceit; de∣clared that he did not intend to impugn his authority further, unless compelled; and desired him to con∣form to the opinion of so many learned casuists, and do his duty according to the dictates of his conscience.</P>
<P>Clement, however, instead of gratifying the King's inclination, issued a citation, requiring him to appear in person, or by proxy, at Rome, to answer to the Queen's appeal; and Sir Edward Karne was sent thi∣ther as Henry's excusator. Sir Edward found the con∣sistory divided in their opinions; the Cardinals in the Emperor's interest urging the Pope to proceed in the cause, while the more moderate advised him to act with caution, as, by adhering to Charles, he would pro∣bably lose England. Clement being informed of the bill concerning the annates, expostulated on that sub∣ject with Karne, and his colleague Edmund Bonner, who answered, that as it was still in the King's power to revoke the act, it would depend upon his Holiness whether it should be annulled or confirmed. The ex∣cusatory plea was argued in the consistory, and, after much debate, neither allowed nor rejected. The va∣cation approaching, the Pope and college of Cardinals wrote a letter to the English Monarch, intreating him to send a proxy in the winter: and Bonner, who was dispatched to England on this occasion, had instruc∣tions from three Cardinals, who were gained over to the King's interest, to assure him that the affair could be judged in no other judicature but in the consistory, and that he had nothing to fear from Clement, who now leaned to the French party.</P>
<PB N="409" REF="454"/>
<P>While these things were acting at Rome, the parlia∣ment of England met again in April; and the most remarkable transaction, before its prorogation on ac∣count of the plague breaking out at London, was a motion by one Tempse, a member of the house of Commons, that an address might be presented to the King, praying him to take back Queen Catherine. Henry was highly incensed at this freedom, for which he chid the Speaker, and appealed to his own consci∣ence for the justification of his conduct.</P>
<P>Immediately after this prorogation, Sir Thomas More, dreading the consequences of a total rupture with the court of Rome, and disliking the person and proceedings of Anne Boleyn, resigned the great seal, which was given to Sir Thomas Audley.</P>
<P>The Pope sent a message to the King, proposing to send a legate, with two auditors of the Rota, to try the cause in some indifferent place, reserving the sentence to himself; and that a truce should be established for four years, before the expiration of which he would call a general council; though he had no design to summon such an assembly, as the last had curtailed the Papal encroachments. Henry dispatched Sir Tho∣mas Elliot with an answer to these proposals, import∣ing, that he could take no resolution concerning a peace, without the concurrence of the French Mo∣narch; that, considering the present state of religion in Germany, he apprehended a general council would be altogether unseasonable; that he could not send a proxy to Rome, or any other place out of his own do∣minions, without giving up the prerogative of his crown, and acting contrary to the laws of his king∣dom; but that his Holiness might remit the discus∣sion of the affair to the clergy of England, and con∣firm the sentence they might pronounce. Dr. Bennet made fresh overtures touching the divorce; but they were rejected as expedients that would retrench the power of the Pope, who ordered the dean of the Rota
<PB N="410" REF="455"/>to summon the King of England to answer to the Queen's appeal. Sir Edward Karne protested against the citation, as his master could not expect justice at Rome, where the Emperor's interest predominated. He demanded that the Pontiff would desist, otherwise Henry would appeal to the decision of learned casuists and universities: he affirmed, that there was a nullity in all their proceedings; that the King his master was a sovereign prince, and the church of England a free church, over which the Pope had no legal authority.</P>
<P>Henry having agreed to an interview with the King of France, embarked for Calais on October 11, at∣tended by Anne Boleyn, lately created Marchioness of Pembroke, and other persons of distinction, and visited Francis at Boulogne, where he was entertained, with equal magnificence and hospitality, for the space of four days; at the expiration of which, the French King ac∣companied him to Calais, and was there splendidly re∣galed with entertainments of various sorts. In the conferences between these two Monarchs, Henry com∣plained loudly of Clement's partiality; and Francis fo∣mented his animosity against that Pontiff, although he was then negotiating a match between his second son the Duke of Orleans, and the Pope's kinswoman, Ma∣ry de Medicis.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Henry's marriage with Anne Boleyn.</NOTE> When the two Kings parted, Henry returned to England, and soon after was privately married to Anne Boleyn.</P>
<P>A. D. 1533.] The English nation resolved to con∣cur heartily with the King in all his measures for abo∣lishing the Papal authority. The parliament assem∣bling in February, enacted a statute, prohibiting all appeals to Rome, under the penalty specified in the statute of premunire.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Henry's marriage with Catherine annulled, and that with Anne Boleyn confirmed.</NOTE> — But the chief thing that engrossed his Majesty's atten∣tion, was the getting his marriage with Catherine formally annulled. Dr. Cran∣mer was a person in whom the King had great confidence; and being in Germany when
<PB N="411" REF="456"/>the archiepiscopal chair of Canterbury became vacant, by the death of Archbishop Warham, was obliged to return, though with reluctance, to supply his place, since Henry looked upon him as the fittest person, on account of his courage and learning, to put the finish∣ing stroke to the divorce. When he had submitted to the will of his Sovereign, he scrupled taking the usual oath to the Pope; until Henry, by way of sal∣vo, proposed a previous protestation against it. Cran∣mer having thus got over his objection, was put in possession of the temporalities of his see. Then the convocation of Canterbury was assembled, and re∣quired to give their opinion on the following que∣stions: Whether or not the dispensation of Pope Ju∣lius II. for the marriage of Catherine and Henry, was sufficient to render the said marriage binding and va∣lid? and whether or not the consummation of Ar∣thur's nuptials with that Princess had been fully pro∣ved? On April 5, the convocation declared, that the Pope had no power to grant dispensations against the law; and that the consummation of the first mar∣riage had been as fully proved as the nature of the case would permit. The same answers were made to those questions by the convocation of York. The Archbishop of Canterbury then demanded his Maje∣sty's permission to proceed against his former marriage with Catherine, whose consent to the divorce the King had attempted by fair means: but Henry's endeavours proving ineffectual, Catherine was summoned to ap∣pear at Dunstable, near the place of her residence. She rejecting the citation, Cranmer pronounced sen∣tence, declaring her marriage null, as being contrary to the law of God; and, by another, confirmed the King's marriage with Anne Boleyn, who was crowned on the 1st of June.</P>
<P>During these transactions, the King of England had desired his ally of France to send over some person of confidence, to whom he might impart some matters
<PB N="412" REF="457"/>of consequence: and Francis pitched upon William du Bellay, Lord of Langeais, who was ordered to tell Henry, that the marriage between the Duke of Orleans and Mary de Medicis was agreed on, and would be celebrated at Marseilles, in the presence of the Pope and King of France; that the presence of Henry, at such a juncture, would probably induce his Holiness to comply with his desires; or that, should he decline coming in person, he might send thither an envoy to solicit his business. When Du Bellay arrived in England, the King acquainted him, that as Cle∣ment had obstinately rejected all his proposals, he was resolved to renounce Clement in his turn; that he had married Anne Boleyn, but that he would keep his marriage secret until the month of May, to see if the King of France could prevail upon the Bishop of Rome to do him justice; but should that Pontiff still con∣tinue obstinate, he would entirely withdraw himself from the Papal power. He likewise told Du Bellay, that he had written a book upon the usurpation of the Roman see, and upon the prerogatives of crowned heads; but would not publish it, until all hopes of accommodation should vanish. It was not in his power, however, to conceal his marriage much longer, for his new wife became pregnant; and, in order to preserve her reputation, it was judged necessary, that her marriage should come under the cognizance of the convocation.</P>
<P>The Pope was so incensed at the proceedings of that assembly, and Cranmer's sentence, together with what had been written against the power of the pontificate in Henry's book (a copy of which had, by that time, been perused at Rome) that he declared the King deserved excommunication, unless he should, before the end of September, renounce all that had been done contrary to the authority of the Holy see; and forth with reversed the Archbishop of Canterbury's decree. Clement still hoped that some expedient might
<PB N="413" REF="458"/>be found to reclaim Henry, who though he had gone too far to retract, yet sent the Duke of Norfolk, as his ambassador, to accompany Francis in his interview with the Pontiff at Marseilles. That nobleman, while he resided in France, being informed of the measures taken at Rome against his master, and acquainting him therewith, was recalled. Nevertheless, Henry, at the desire of the French Monarch, sent Stephen Gardiner, lately created Bishop of Winchester, with Sir Francis Bryan, and Sir John Wallop, to attend him at the interview: and these were accompanied by Edmund Bonner, before-mentioned, who was an ec∣clesiastic of great impudence and resolution. After the celebration of the nuptials at Marseilles, Francis prevailed upon the Pope to satisfy the King of Eng∣land: but Clement, in order to save the honour of the Holy see, insisted upon judging the cause in a consisto∣ry, from which the Cardinals of the Emperor's factions were to be excluded. Bonner, who was ignorant of this resolution, demanded an audience of the Pontiff, and told him, that Henry had appealed to a future council from any Papal sentence, that either was, or might be, given against him. The Pope said, he would take the advice of the Cardinals; and, in a few days, informed him, that the appeal was not receiva∣ble: but Bonner, without being intimidated by this answer, proceeded to notify Archbishop Cranmer's appeal from the reversion of the sentence he had pro∣nounced; and Clement was so exasperated at Bonner's presumption, that he threatened to cause him to be thrown into a cauldron of molten lead. Francis was equally offended at the Englishman's insolence and indiscretion, and promised to assist the Pope in taking vengeance on him for such an outrage: nevertheless, he allowed the delinquent to escape.</P>
<P>That Monarch, notwithstanding Bonner's unseason∣able intervention, did not despair of seeing the dispute terminated in an amicable manner; and, for that end,
<PB N="414" REF="459"/>on his return from Marseilles, sent John du Bellay, Archbishop of Paris, with new proposals to Henry; who consented to the dispute's being decided, at Cam∣bray, by judges who could not be suspected of par∣tiality. The Prelate, having gained this point, set out for Rome in the middle of winter, and found Clement very well disposed to agree to this expedient, provided the King of England would bind himself by a writing, under his hand, to abide by this determi∣nation; and, in order to avoid delays, a certain day was fixed for the return of the courier, who was dis∣patched to England for the instrument. The Empe∣ror's ministers were no sooner informed of this nego∣tiation, than they pressed the Pope to revoke his en∣gagement; and, by dint of importunity, obtained his promise, that if the messenger should not arrive within the limited time, he would hold himself disengaged, and give sentence against Henry. The courier not arriving within the precise time, the Archbishop of Paris solicited a delay of six days only: but Clement was so much affected by the menaces of the Imperialists, that, instead of complying with this request, he preci∣pitated matters so much, that he finished, in one con∣sistory, what, according to the usual forms, ought to have been canvassed in three. He published a sen∣tence, declaring the marriage of Henry with Cathe∣rine good and lawful, and commanded him to take her back, on pain of incurring ecclesiastical censure.</P>
<P>A. D. 1534.] The King of England's sincerity in his proposals of accommodation with the Roman Pon∣tiff, on this occasion, has been called in question: for, even before he could know the issue of the negotiation, he assembled his parliament, which began the session on January 15, with repealing the statute, which passed in the reign of Henry IV. against heretics, and of which William Sautre had hansel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 272 of this volume.</NOTE>. The parlia∣ment
<PB N="415" REF="460"/>did not intend to exempt those accused of heresy from the flames; for, by the new law, the delinquents were still liable to the same punishment: but in order to hinder the ecclesiastics from being sole judges in such cases, it was enacted, that heretics should be tried according to the laws of the kingdom, without any regard to the canon law. By another act it was decreed, that no synod, or convocation of the clergy, should be held without the royal licence: that the Sovereign should appoint two and thirty persons, from the parliament and clergy, to examine the canons and constitutions of the church: that those, which were necessary, should be retained; and all the rest abo∣lished.</P>
<P>The parliament confirmed the statute against <HI>annates.</HI> They likewise enacted, that, for the future, the Pope should have no share in the election or confirmation of Bishops; but that, in cases of vacancy, the King should expedite a <HI>congé d'elire,</HI> or licence, to the Dean and chapter, to elect new Bishops; and, if the elec∣tion should not be made in twelve days after the date of the licence, the power of electing should devolve to the King, who should recommend him to the Arch∣bishop for consecration; and should the elect, or the Archbishop, refuse to conform to this order, he should incur the penalties of the act of premunire. All per∣sons were also forbid to address themselves to the Bishop of Rome for bulls, palls, or any other religious pur∣pose. Another act abolished <HI>Peter-pence,</HI> together will all procurations, delegations, bulls, and dispen∣sations, issued by the court of Rome; impowering the Archbishop of Canterbury to grant such dispensations as should not be contrary to the law of God, on con∣dition that part of the money, thence arising, should be brought into the King's treasury: and all religious houses, whether exempted or not exempted, were subjected to the visitation of the Archbishop.</P>
<PB N="416" REF="461"/>
<P>An act was also passed, declaring the King's marriage with Catherine void,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The succession settled on the King's issue by Anne Bo∣leyn.</NOTE> and settling the suc∣cession of the crown upon his issue by his lawful wife Anne, whether male or fe∣male; for the maintenance of which, and the King's prerogative, as head of the church, an oath was enjoined to be taken by the sub∣jects; and the members having complied with that ceremony, the two houses were prorogued to the 3d day of November.</P>
<P>It was during this session of parliament, that an act of attainder, or conviction, passed against Eli∣zabeth Barton,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Account of the Maid of Kent.</NOTE> known by the appellation of <HI>The Maid of Kent,</HI> a native of the parish of Aldington, who had been tutored-by certain clergymen to excite disturbances all over the kingdom. She had been troubled with hysteric fits, during which she uttered many incoherent and delirious expressions, which induced the ignorant by-standers to believe she was divinely inspired. Richard Master, the parish priest, foreseeing advantages to himself in trumping up an imposture, persuaded this weak fanatic, that she actually spoke from the influence of the Holy Ghost, taught her to counterfeit trances, and utter speeches, which were deemed the oracles of heaven. He was assisted in his knavish design by one Doctor Bocking, a canon of Christ-church, in Canterbury. Elizabeth, thus instructed, became an apt pupil; pro∣phesied with all the marks of holy emotion; writhed her body into strange contortions; inveighed against the favourers of Protestantism as abominable heretics; exclaimed against the King's divorce, and, in order to raise the reputation of a chapel within the parish, declared, that the Blessed Virgin had appeared to her, and assured that she would never recover until she should visit her image in that place of worship. She ac∣cordingly went in pilgrimage to the chapel; where, in the midst of a great concourse of people, she pretend∣ed
<PB N="417" REF="462"/>to fall into a trance, poured forth pious ejaculations, declared that God had called her to a religious life, and appointed Bocking to be her ghostly father. She pre∣tended to be recovered of all her distempers by the inter∣cession of the Virgin; took the veil; saw visions; heard melodious sounds; received from Mary Mag∣dalen a letter from heaven; was conveyed by an an∣gel to Calais, while the King resided in that city; received the sacrament in his presence, though invisi∣ble; and was brought back again, in the same man∣ner, to her own monastery. She prophesied, that if Henry should proceed in the divorce, and mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y another wife, his royalty would not be of a month's duration, but that he should die the death of a villain.</P>
<P>Her pretended revelations were collected, and in∣serted in a book, by a monk called Deering. War∣ham Archbishop of Canterbury, a credulous though pious Prelate, was imposed upon by her delusions. She was countenanced by Fisher Bishop of Rochester▪ and others, who adhered to the interest of Queen Catherine. They held private meetings with this di∣viner; and debauched many persons from their alle∣giance, particularly the religious of Shene, Sion, and the Charter house, and some of the Observants of Richmond, Greenwich, and Canterbury. One Peto; preaching before the King at Greenwich, told him he had been deceived by many lying prophets; but he, as a true Micajah, warned him that the dogs should lick his blood, as they had licked the blood of Ahab. Henry bore this insult with great temper; but, to undeceive the people, appointed Doctor Corren to preach before him, on the ensuing Sunday; when that ecclesiastic justified the King's proceedings, and bran∣ded Peto with the epithets of rebel, slanderer, dog, and traitor. He was interrupted by an Observant friar of the name of Elston; who calling him a lying prophet, that sought to establish the succession to the crown upon adultery, spoke with such virulence, that the King
<PB N="418" REF="463"/>was obliged to interpose, and command him to be silent; and he and Peto were afterwards summoned before the council, and rebuked for their intemperance. The churchmen, engaged in this conspiracy, encou∣raged by the unusual lenity of the government, had resolved to publish the <HI>maid</HI>'s revelations, in their sermons, throughout the kingdom. They had com∣municated them to the Pope's nuncio, to whom they also introduced their prophetess; and exhorted Queen Catherine to persist in her resolution. At length the confederacy began to be considered as a very serious affair; and Henry ordered Elizabeth Barton and her accomplices to be examined in the Star-chamber, where they confessed all the particulars of the imposture, and appeared soon after upon a scaffold in St. Paul's church∣yard, at which place the articles of their confession were publickly read in their hearing. From thence they were conveyed to the Tower, where they remain∣ed till the meeting of the parliament; which, having considered the case, pronounced it a conspiracy against the King's life and crown, and attainted the <HI>maid,</HI> or <HI>nun,</HI> with her accomplices, as guilty of high treason. In the course of the inquiry it was discovered that the letter, said to have come from Mary Magdalen, was written by one Hankherst of Canterbury; and that the door of a dormitory, alledged to have been opened by a miracle, that the <HI>nun</HI> might go into the chapel, and converse with God, was really opened for carnal com∣merce between her and her associates. On April 20, she was, with Bocking, Master, Deering, and two other accomplices called Gold and Risby, executed at Tyburn, when she confessed her imposture, laying the blame upon the confederates, who had imposed upon her ignorance; and craving pardon of God and the King, besought the people to pray for her and her fel∣low sufferers. All persons possessed of the books of her revelations were ordered to send them to the secre∣tary of state, on pain of fine and imprisonment.</P>
<PB N="419" REF="464"/>
<P>When the cheat was at first discovered, Cromwell, then secretary of state, exhorted Fisher Bishop of Rochester to acknowledge his offence, and ask forgive∣ness of the King, who, he knew, would grant it in consideration of his age and infirmities. The prelate rejected this advice with disdain, and threatened to speak his conscience freely, should he be further trou∣bled on that account. The secretary sent him another letter, expostulating with him upon his misconduct, reminding him of having concealed matters that con∣cerned his Majesty's life and dignity; assuring him, that, should he be brought to trial, he would certainly be found guilty; and urging him again to have recourse to the clemency of the King, who would pardon what was past, and take him into favour. Fisher continued still obstinate, refusing to make the least submission; and was, with Thomas Gold, Thomas Laurence, Edward Twaits, John Addison, and Thomas Abell, judged guilty of misprision of treason, to forfeit their goods and chattels to the King, and to be imprisoned during his Majesty's pleasure.</P>
<P>After the prorogation of the parliament, the King sent commissioners through the whole kingdom, to ad∣minister the new oath to all his ecclesiastical subjects, im∣porting, that they would be faithful to the King, Queen, their heirs, and successors; that they held the King to be the supreme head of the English church, and the Pope to be no more than any other Bishop; that they renounced all obedience to that Prelate; that they would preach the pure doctrines of the holy scrip∣tures; and that they would publickly pray for the King, as the head of the English church, for the Queen, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. This oath was voluntarily taken by the majority of all the Abbots, Priors, Monks, and all the Bishops, except Fisher; who, with Sir Thomas More, refused to take it as it was then conceived. Sir Thomas declared him∣self willing to swear to the succession, provided he
<PB N="420" REF="465"/>might be allowed to draw up the oath. Cranmer and Cromwell expressed great tenderness for him. They endeavoured to convince him by argument; and Cran∣mer proposed that his expedient should be accepted: but the King being incensed against him and Fisher, they were both committed to the Tower, debarred the use of pen, ink, and paper, and the Bishop was stripped of every thing in his old age, except a few rags, which could hardly cover his nakedness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Act of supre∣macy.</NOTE> The parliament, reassembling in No∣vember, passed that famous statute, called the act of supremacy, wherein, after reciting, that albeit the King was supreme head of the church in England, and so recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocation, for corroborating which, as also for extirpating all errors, heresies, and abuses, it was enacted, that the King, his heirs, and succes∣sors, should be accepted and reputed <HI>the supreme head,</HI> on earth, of the church of England, called <HI>Ecclesia Anglicana,</HI> and enjoy, united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and stile thereof, as all honours, dignities, pre-eminences, jurisdictions, pri∣vileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commo∣dities, to the said dignity of supreme head of the same church, belonging or appertaining; and that our said Sovereign Lord, his heirs and successors, shall have full power and authority to repress, to reform, order, correct, restrain, and amend, all such errors, heresies, abuses, &amp;c. whatsoever, which by virtue of all man∣ner of spiritual authority belongeth unto him, to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue, the conservation of peace, unity, and tranquillity, any usage, custom, foreign authority, prescription, or any thing else notwithstanding.</P>

By this expedient, he proposed not only to undeceive the public in their opinion of the sanctity of such cha∣racters, but also to wreak his vengeance upon the monks, whom he considered as his implacable ene∣mies, and to augment his revenue with their spoils. Thomas Cromwell being appointed visitor-general, no∣minated substitutes for the examination of the mona∣steries, where they found such irregularities and scenes of vice, debauchery, and imposture, as were disgrace∣ful to religion, and indeed shocking to human nature. However, they were not all criminal; for some socie∣ties were found irreproachable, bestowing their spare time from the exercises of devotion in writing books, painting, carving, graving, and other ingenious amuse∣ments. The visitors, who were no friends to monastic institutions, did not fail to exaggerate those particulars which they found to the prejudice of the monastics. They first threatened the desinquent friars and nuns with all the severity of the law, and then insinuated, that in order to avoid punishment, and conceal the dis∣orders they had committed, they should resign their<NOTE PLACE="foot">desired one of the by-standers to help him to mount the scaffold, saying, he should not be so solicitous about coming down again. When the executioner asked his forgiveness, Sir Thomas told him, be would acquire very little honour by doing his work upon him, because he had a very short neck; and after laying his head upon the block, perceiving his beard was in the way of the axe, he laid is on one side, saying, it did not deserve to suffer, as it never com∣mitted treason.</NOTE>
<PB N="425" REF="470"/>houses to the King, who would take care to provide for the subsistence of every individual. This advice was followed by a great number of priors, with the concurrence of their monks; and Cromwell's delegates published a report of their proceedings. According to that report, it appeared, that many convents were divided into factions, which exercised the most barba∣rous cruelties on one another, as they chanced to pre∣dominate; that they carried on an idolatrous traffic, by imposing upon the superstitious people with relics and images; that in some houses the visitors found the implements of clipping and coining; that the majority of the nuns, in many nunneries, were pregnant; that a great number of abbots and monks were guilty of criminal correspondence with harlots and married wo∣men; and that not a few had been detected in the gra∣tification of their lusts in an unnatural way and brutal commerce. After this publication, the King, as <HI>head of the English church,</HI> absolved from their vows all those who had engaged in a religious life before the age of four and twenty, and permitted all the rest to quit their monasteries, and live as seculars, according to their pleasure. This permission, however, had very little effect; and Henry afterwards had recourse to other measures for the evacuation of the convents.</P>
<P>Pope Paul had expressed an eager desire to find some means of accommodating matters with the King of England, and frequently conferred thereon with Gre∣gorio Casali, who still resided at Rome, though not in a public capacity; but when he understood that Cardinal Fisher and Sir Thomas More, together with several monks, had been executed for refusing to own Henry's supremacy, he concluded that England was for ever lost to the see of Rome; and, in order to sup∣port the dignity of the Papacy, thundered a bull of ex∣communication and deposition against the English Mo∣narch; which however he delayed the publication of, till about three years afterwards, when the cause of
<PB N="426" REF="471"/>publishing it then shall be properly taken notice of: but in the mean time we have subjoined the substance of it in a note<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Pope, after assuming to himself the supreme power over all the Kings in the world, as Christ's vicar on earth, declares, that since King Henry, who had been formerly <HI>a defender of the faith,</HI> had fallen from it, and since all milder methods had proved inef∣fectual to reclaim him, he was obliged to proceed to due correc∣tion and more severe measures; particularly for that the said King Henry had, contrary to an inhibition made, put away his Queen, married Anne Boleyn; had made impious and hurtful laws, deny∣ing the Pope to be the supreme head of the church, and, assuming that title to himself, had required all his subjects, under pain of death, to swear it; and had put the Cardinal of Rochester to death, because he would not consent to these heresies; by which he had rendered himself unworthy of the regal dignity, and had hardened his heart against all the admonitions of Pope Clement VII.: there∣fore, since his crimes were so notorious, he found himself necessi∣tated to proceed to such censures as Henry had deserved; and with the advice of his Cardinals does first exhort him, and all his com∣plices, to return from their errors, to annul the acts lately made; which he requires under the pains of excommunication and rebel∣lion, and of the King's losing his kingdom; whom he required, within ninety days, to appear at Rome, and his complices in sixty, to give an account of their actions, otherwise he would then pro∣ceed to a farther sentence against them; and declares, if the King and his complices do not appear, he has fallen from his right to his crown, and they from the right to their estates; and when they die, were to be denied Christian burial. He puts the whole kingdom under an interdict, and declares all the King's children by the said Anne, and all the children of his complices, to be under the same pain, though they be now under age; incapacitates them for all honours or employments; declares all the subjects or vassals of the King, or his complices, absolved from all oaths or obligations to them, and requires the said subjects to acknowledge them no more; and declares him and them infamous, so that they might neither be witnesses, nor make wills. He further requires all other persons to have no dealings with them, under the pain of excommunication; and that all clergymen should go out of the kingdom (leaving only so many priests as would be necessary for baptizing infants, and giving the sacrament to such as died in penitence) under the pains of excommunication and deprivation. He charges all noblemen and others in his dominions, under the same pains, to rise up in arms against him, and to drive him out of his kingdom; and that none should take arms for him, or any ways assist him. He declares all other Princes absolved from any confederacies made or to be made with him; and earnestly obtests the Emperor, and all Kings, and requires all Princes, under the former pains, to trade no more with him: and in case of their disobedience, he puts their kingdoms un∣der an interdict. He moreover requires all princes and military persons, in the virtue of holy obedience, to make war upon him, and to force him to return to the obedience of the apostolic see, and to seize on all goods or merchandizes belonging to the King or his complices, where-ever they could find them; and that such of his subjects as were seized on should be made slaves. He farther re∣quires all Bishops to intimate this sentence in all their churches, with putting out of candles, and other ceremonies, that ought to be used in the most solemn and public manner that might be; and orders all who should hinder the publication of this sentence to be put un∣der the same pains. He ordained this sentence to be affixed at Rome, Tournay, and Dunkirk, which should stand for a sufficient publica∣tion: and concludes, that if any should endeavour to oppose or enervate any of the premisses, he should incur the indignation of Almighty God, and the holy apostles St. Peter and St. Paul. Dated at Rome, the 30th of August, 1535.</NOTE>. Henry was no sooner informed of
<PB N="427" REF="472"/>this attack, than, in conjunction with his friend Fran∣cis King of France, he sent ambassadors to the Princes of the league of Smalcade in Germany, to propose an union of interests: but those Protestants, whose only aim was to enjoy liberty of conscience, saw no proba∣bility of being able to maintain a sincere union with two Princes, who condemned their doctrine, and even persecuted such of their subjects as professed these doc∣trines. They proposed, in their turn, that Henry should subscribe <HI>the confession of Augsburg</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 128 of this volume.</NOTE>; and he desired them to send some able divines to confer with those of England on that subject: he had no intention to conform to their tenets; for, on the contrary, he pretended to dictate to all the world.</P>
<P>In the course of this year, Cardinal Campejus, and another Italian, Hieronymus de Negutius (otherwise Ghinacer) were deprived of their bishoprics of Salis∣bury and Worcester<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 351 of ditto.</NOTE>, which were bestowed upon Nicholas Shaxton, and Hugh Latimer, who favoured
<PB N="428" REF="473"/>the reformation. John Helsey obtained the see of Rochester upon the death of Cardinal Fisher, and Ed∣ward Fox was promoted to that of Hereford.</P>
<P>Henry, apprehensive that James V. King of Scot∣land, whom he conceived to be disaffected to his measures, would take the first opportunity of invading England, in case of any civil commotion, thought he could not use a more effectual method to secure him∣self from that quarter, than by persuading his nephew to follow his example, in renouncing the Papal autho∣rity. For this purpose he wrote a long letter to that Prince, explaining the motives of his separation from the see of Rome; and then proposed an interview. Although the reformation had gained footing in Scot∣land, James himself had no intention to forsake the established religion; nevertheless, he would not blunt∣ly decline the meeting proposed by his uncle: but having received a brief from the Pope, forbidding him to hold an interview with Henry, he intimated that prohibition to his uncle; who having made prepara∣tions for his journey, was extremely exasperated at the repulse.</P>
<P>A. D. 1536.] This year was ushered in with the death of the unfortunate Queen Catherine, who departed this life at Kimbolton,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Death of Queen Cathe∣rine.</NOTE>, in Huntingdonshire, on January 8, after having sustained a long series of afflic∣tions. She had been harrassed by repeated messages from Henry, importuning her to resign the title of Queen, which she never would lay down, protesting, that as the Pope had declared her marriage valid, she would sooner lose her life than her title; which she continued to exact from all her servants. She became, however, very affable, and acquired great popularity among the country people. When the King proposed that she should reside at Fotheringhay-castle, she de∣clared, that she would never go thither unless as a
<PB N="429" REF="474"/>prisoner. She lived on the pension assigned her as Princess Dowager of Wales; and though she could have no great comfort in England, she never expressed the least inclination to quit the kingdom, when no other motive, than her motherly care of the Princess Mary, could be supposed to make her residence agree∣ble. In her will, she desired her body might be bu∣ried in a convent of <HI>Observant-friars;</HI> that five hundred masses should be said for her soul; and that a person should make a pilgrimage to <HI>Our Lady of Walsingham</HI>'s shrine in Norfolk, and distribute 200 nobles in charity upon the road. She likewise bequeathed some legacies to her servants. Henry had declared, before the Car∣dinal legates at the Black-friars, in 1529, that she had been always a true and obedient wife, and was possessed of many excellent qualities; and when he heard of her last illness, sent her a kind message. She dictated a very tender letter to him; in which she called him her dear lord and husband; forgave him all the trouble in which he had involved her; recommended her daughter Mary to his care and affection; desired he would provide for her three maids, and indulge her servants with a small gratuity; and concluded with these words, "I make this vow, that mine eyes de∣sire you above all things." She was undoubtedly a devout and virtuous Princess, who led a very severe and mortified life; but she was a bigot in religion, and of a fretful temper, which, perhaps, at first ali∣enated the King's affection, as she had no personal charms to fix his wavering disposition. Henry ex∣pressed some regret at her death: whilst Queen Anne rejoiced openly at that event, and seemed to take plea∣sure in communicating her satisfaction to the public. The King would not allow Catherine to be buried ac∣cording to her own directions: and her corpse was in∣terred in the abbey (now cathedral) church of Peter-borough.</P>

<P>The parliament reassembling, his Majesty repre∣sented to them, that the great number of monasteries was an expence to the king∣dom,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Act for sup∣pressing the lesser mona∣steries.</NOTE> and desired them to apply some re∣medy to the evil: in consequence of which remonstrance, they passed an act, suppressing all mo∣nasteries whose revenues did not exceed 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and appro∣priated their income to the King's use. By this statute, 376 religious houses were dissolved, and the crown acquired the yearly value of 32,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> besides a capi∣tal of above 100,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in the plate, ornaments, and effects of churches and convents. Then Henry erect∣ed a new court of justice, called <HI>the court of the augmen∣tation of the King's revenue for taking cognizance of all such sequestrations.</HI> The King having, as usual, obtained all he wished from the parliament, dissolved that assem∣bly, after it had continued sitting six years, a longer term than any parliament had ever subsisted since the beginning of the English monarchy.</P>
<P>About the same time that the parliament met, the clergy assembled in convocation, when a motion was made for a new translation of the Bible into English, more correct than that of Tindal, which the Roman∣ists taxed with being erroneous, and in many places stuffed with misrepresentations. Gardiner, and the violent Papists, opposed the proposal; but Cranmer, and his party, supported and carried the motion. The King was petitioned to employ some able persons to execute this task; the Queen seconded the peti∣tion, with which Henry complied; and the perfor∣mance was completed, and printed about three years afterwards at Paris; tho' the names of the translators are not handed down to posterity.</P>
<P>His Majesty began by this time to be cloyed with the possession of Anne Boleyn, who had been lately delivered of a dead male child,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The trial and death of Anne Boleyn.</NOTE> to the unspeakable disappointment of her husband, who was superstitious
<PB N="431" REF="478"/>enough to believe, that this accident was a judgment from heaven: but Henry was then captivated with the beauty of Jane Seymour, one of the Queen's ladies; and his passions were so strong and impetuous, that he sacrificed every thing to their gratification. These concurring motives, for his alienation from the Queen, were strengthened by her rather too frank and free de∣portment, which could not well screen her from the imputation of levity and indiscretion. The Duke of Norfolk, and all the friends of the Romish religion, were her enemies from the same motives, that she pro∣fessed herself an advocate for the reformation, viz. self∣interest. Her adversaries took every advantage to in∣flame Henry's jealous disposition; the principal fo∣menter of which was the Lady Rochford, Queen Anne's sister-in-law, a woman of infamous character, whose rancour to her mistress was unbounded. The same inveterate Lady Rochford hinted to the caprici∣ous Henry, that his consort carried on a criminal cor∣respondence with her own brother, the Lord Rochford: and the King's mind, already disgusted with Anne, and prepossessed with the charms of Jane Seymour, easily imbibed what was alledged against the virtue of his connubial consort. Queen Anne was not only ac∣cused of incest with her brother, but likewise of living in carnal commerce with Henry Norris, groom of the stole, Weston and Brereton of the King's privy-cham∣ber, and Mark Smeton, a musician. The evidence at first was only presumptive, being no other than an hearsay declaration of Lady Wingfield, who confessed some particulars on her death-bed: but that was suffi∣cient to ruffle such a mind as that of Anne's husband, who is said to have observed her, at a tournament at Greenwich, to drop her handkerchief to one of her minions, that he might wipe his face, after having overheated himself in the exercise. But be that as it may, the King returned abruptly to Whitehall; the Queen was confined to her chamber; and her supposed
<PB N="432" REF="479"/>criminal associates, being apprehended at the same time, were committed to the Tower. Queen Anne smiled at first, thinking the King was in jest: but, when she found it was a serious affair, she received the sacra∣ment in her closet, and prepared for death. This re∣verse of fortune affected her in such a manner, that she was seized with hysteric fits, during which she laughed and wept by turns; and uttered many inconsistencies, according to the nature of that disease. Next day she was conveyed to the Tower, where she fell upon her knees, and appealed to God for the knowledge of her innocence. She begged in vain to be admitted to the presence of her husband. The Lady Boleyn, her uncle's wife, who always hated her, was ordered to be in the same chamber with her; and the same Lady Boleyn made a report of all the incoherent ravings of the afflicted prisoner. Anne was visited by the Duke of Norfolk, and others of the King's council, who endeavoured to draw her into a confession, by saying she was accused by Norris and Smeton: but she still persisted in denying the charge, and told the Lieutenant of the Tower, "She was not more guilty with any man upon earth than himself." She confessed, indeed, that she had, in the gaiety of heart, made use of some indiscreet expressions to Smeton and Weston; and that the familiarity of her behaviour had encouraged them to hint a passion for her. Every person at court abandoned the unhappy Queen in her distress, except Archbishop Cranmer, who, though forbid to come into the King's presence, wrote a letter to him in her behalf; but his intercession had no effect. On May 12, Norris, Weston, Brereton, and Smeton, were tried in Westminster hall; when Smeton confessed he had known the Queen carnally three times. The other three pleaded not guilty; but all four were condemned to die the death of traitors. On the 15th day of the month, the Queen and her brother Lord Rochford, were brought to their trial, before the Duke
<PB N="433" REF="480"/>of Norfolk, as Lord High Steward for the occasion, and twenty-eight other Peers. Anne, appearing at the bar, was charged with criminal conversation with her brother and the other four; as also with having conspired the death of the King. She pleaded not guilty, and answered distinctly all the evidence pro∣duced against her. As she was not confronted by Smeton, it was supposed that he had bore false wit∣ness; for all the others denied the charge. Never∣theless, she was convicted, and condemned to be burned or beheaded, at the King's pleasure. Her brother likewise was found guilty, and sentenced to be beheaded and quartered. Henry, not satisfied with this vengeance, was desirous of seeing her daughter Elizabeth declared illegitimate. He remembered a report of a previous contract between Lord Piercy, then Earl of Northumberland, and Anne Boleyn. The Earl, being questioned on this subject, declared, that no such contract had ever existed. He swore to this declaration on the sacrament, which he wished might be his damnation if he did not speak the truth. How∣ever, the Queen was tampered with in such a manner, either by promise of life, or threats of executing the sentence in all its rigour, that she confessed such a precontract before the afflicted Primate, and some other persons of distinction: and her marriage with the King was declared null and insufficient. This sentence, however, palpably contradicted the other which had been pronounced against her: for, if her marriage with Henry was null from the beginning, she could not be justly attainted for adultery. In two days after this declaration, she was ordered to be ex∣ecuted on the green in the Tower. She is said to have written a letter to the King, when she first understood the cause of her confinement. Such an address was afterwards found among the papers of Thomas Crom∣well, drawn up with such pathetic eloquence and dig∣nity of expression, as to do great honour to the author;
<PB N="434" REF="481"/>but it is generally supposed to have been the production of some other person. On the day that preceded her execution, she desired the wife of the Lieutenant of the Tower to sit down in the chair of state: then kneeling before her, and shedding a flood of tears, she conjured her to go, in her name, and ask pardon of the Princess Mary, for the harshness with which she had been treated. On the morning of her execution, she sent for the Lieutenant, that he might be present at her re∣ceiving the mass, and declaring her own innocence. She said, she was sorry to hear her death was delayed till the afternoon, because, before that time, she had expected to be out of her pain. Then she inquired about the dexterity of the executioner; fixed her hands about her neck, observing that it was very little, and laughed heartily. When she was brought to the scaffold, in presence of the Duke of Rich∣mond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This vas Henry Fitzroy, the King's natural son, by Elizabeth, daughter of Sir—Blount, and widow of Sir Gilbert Taillebois. He married Mary, daughter to the Duke of Norfolk, but died with∣out issue, in the 17th year of his age.</NOTE>, with several other persons of distinction, and the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs of London, she said, she was come to die, as she had been judged by the law. She prayed that God would preserve the King, who had been always to her a most merciful, good, and gentle Sovereign; and wished that people would judge of him with charity. She took leave of all the spectators, desiring they would pray for her; and after she had spent some time in devotion, her head was severed from her body by the executioner of Calais, who was brought over for his dexterity in decapitation. Her corpse was thrown into a common coffin, and buried in the Tower chapel, without any ceremony. Thus fell Anne Boleyn, whose fate has been the subject of much controversy. She is said to have been a lady of unaffected piety, and was certainly

<PB N="436" REF="483"/><GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/> vours to be excused from a submission of this nature; but finding her father inflexible, at length complied, and signed the articles, though contrary to her con∣science and persuasion. His other daughter Elizabeth, then near three years of age, was deprived of the title of Princess of Wales, which she had hitherto enjoyed; but the King carefully superintended her education, and treated her on all occasions with parental affec∣tion.</P>
<P>Henry having convened a new parliament on June 8, that assembly enacted a statute,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The succession to the crown altered a se∣cond time.</NOTE> reversing the former act of succession, declaring the children of the King's two first marriages illegitimate, and excluded for ever from succeeding to the crown; confirming the condemnation of Anne Boleyn, adjudging the crown, after the King's death, to his issue by Queen Jane, or any other wife he might afterwards espouse; impower∣ing Henry to regulate the manner in which they should succeed, either by will, or letters-patent under the great seal; and declaring all those, who should main∣tain the validity of his first marriages, guilty of high treason.</P>
<P>In order to deprive the Pope of all chance for reco∣vering his spiritual jurisdiction in England, this parli∣ament passed an act, subjecting to the penalty of pre∣munire every person who should, in any manner, at∣tempt to re-establish the authority of the Bishop of Rome in England; and likewise all magistrates, who should neglect to put this law in execution. By an∣other statute, they annulled and abolished all dispensa∣tions, exemptions, and privileges, derived from the court of Rome; saving, however, to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the power of confirming what should be judged for the benefit of the church and people. A third act prohibited marriage with any of the King's relations, unless permission should be previously ob∣tained<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This law was passed in consequence of a stolen match between Sir Thomas Howard, brother to the Duke of Norfolk, and Lady Margaret Douglas, the King's niece; she being daughter of Mar∣garet Queen of Scotland, by her second husband Archibald Earl of Angus. Lady Margaret was, with her husband, committed to the Tower; but lived to be grandmother of James I. of England.</NOTE>.
<PB N="437" REF="484"/>A fourth law decreed, that all usurpation of parliament upon the King's prerogative, before he should have attained the age of four and twenty, might be annulled by letters-patent under the great seal of England.</P>
<P>The clergy were as complaisant to the King as this parliament, whose view of meeting seems to have been only for extending the regal power beyond the bounds within which: had been hitherto confined. In short, Henry was determined to be absolute both in church and state. He had formed a religion of his own, and was resolved that his subjects should embrace it. The convocation confirmed the sentence of divorce between the King and Anne Boleyn, upon the supposed precon∣tract subsisting between her and Lord Piercy, though his Lordship had denied it upon oath in the most so∣lemn manner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See p. 433 of this volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The lower house of convocation being averse to Archbishop Cranmer, Thomas Cromwell, and those who favoured the reformation; and supposing that those, whom Queen Anne had protected, would be in∣volved in her ruin, sent to the upper house sixty-seven propositions, which they deemed heretical. In these propositions they had inferred many doctrines adopted by the Lutherans, ancient Lollards, and Anabaptists; insinuating, that the reformers professed them all equally. At the same time their deputies complained loudly against innovations in religion, and those by whom they were introduced, meaning Cranmer and Cromwell; who both, notwithstanding the fate of Anne Boleyn, still maintained their credit with the
<PB N="438" REF="485"/>King, who created Cromwell his Vicegerent in all ec∣elesiastical affairs. By Henry's order, this Vicar de∣clared to the convocation, that the rites and ceremo∣nies of the church should be reformed by the rules of scripture; and, in a few days, he presented to them a set of articles, drawn up by the King himself, touch∣ing the religious doctrines, that they might examine them, and make a faithful report of their deliberations on the subject. On this occasion, the friends and ene∣mies of the reformation declared themselves openly. Archbishop Cranmer was seconded by Thomas Good∣rich Bishop of Ely, Nicholas Shaxton of Salisbury, Hugh Latimer of Worcester, William Barlow of St. David's, Edward Fox of Hereford, and John Hilsey of Rochester. At the head of the other party was Ed∣ward Lee, Archbishop of York, supported by John Stokesley Bishop of London, Cuthbert Tonstal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Durham, Stephen Gardiner of Winchester, John Long∣land of Lincoln, Robert Sherburn of Chichester, Richard Nix of Norwich, and John Kite of Carlisle. These were secret partisans of the Pope, with whom they hoped a reconciliation would one day be effected. Cranmer and Cromwell, however, had the King's ear, and persuaded him, that the abuses of which they de∣manded an abolition, tended to the support of the Papal usurpation. After warm debates, the convocation agreed upon certain articles of faith, of which the reader is here presented with a copy, as well as of the King's preface or proclamation thereto prefixed, with a variation of the spelling to the modern ortho∣graphy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These constitutions were in this year (1536) printed at London by Thomas Berthelet, the King's printer, in a book intitled, "Ar∣ticles devised by the Kynges Highnes Majestie to stably she christen quietnes and unitie amonge us, and to anoyde contentious opinions, which articles he also approued by the consent and determination of the hole clergie of this realme."</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY VIII. by the grace of God, King of England and of France, Defender of the Faith, Lord of Ireland, and on earth supreme head of the church of England, to all and singular our most loving faith∣ful, and obedient subjects, greeting. Among other cares appertaining unto this our princely office, where∣unto it hath pleased Almighty God of his infinite mercy and goodness to call us, we have always esteemed and thought, like as we also yet esteem and think, that it most chiefly belongeth unto our said charge diligently to foresee and cause, that not only the most holy word and commandments of God should most sincerely be believed, and most reverently be observed and kept of our subjects, but also that unity and concord in opi∣nions, namely, in such things as do concern our reli∣gion, merely without any let or hindrance, be of our subjects truly believed, may encrease and go forward, and all occasion of dissent and discord, touching the same, be repressed and utterly extinguished. For the which cause, we being of late, to our great regret, credibly advertised of such diversity in opinions, as have grown and sprung in this our realm, as well con∣cerning certain articles necessary to our salvation, as also touching certain other honest and commendable ceremonies, rites, and usages, now of long time used and accustomed in our churches, for conservation of an honest policy, and decent and seemly order to be had therein, minding to have that unity and agreement established through our said church concerning the premisses; and being very desirous to eschew not only the dangers of souls, but also the outward unquietness which by occasion of the said diversity in opinions (if remedy were not provided) might perchance have en∣sued, have not only in our own person, at many times, taken great pain, study, labours, and travels, but
<PB N="440" REF="487"/>also have caused our Bishops, and others the most dis∣creet and best learned men of our clergy of this our whole realm, to be assembled in our convocation, for the full debatement and quiet determination of the same: where, after long and mature deliberation and disputations, had of and upon the premisses, finally they have concluded and agreed upon the most special points and articles, as well such as be commanded of God, and are necessary to our salvation, as also divers other matters, touching the honest ceremonies and good and politic orders, as is aforesaid: which their deter∣mination, debatement, and agreement, for so much as we think to have proceeded of a good, right, and true judgment, and to be agreeable to the laws and ordinances of God, and much profitable for the esta∣blishment of that charitable concord and unity in our church of England, which we most desire, we have caused the same to be published, willing, requiring, and commanding you to accept, repute, and take them accordingly. And further, we most heartily desire and pray Almighty God, that it may please him so to illu∣mine your hearts, that you, and every of you, may have no less desire, zeal, and love to the said unity and concord, in reading, divulging and following the same, than we have had, and have, in causing them to be thus devised, set forth, and published. And for be∣cause we would the said articles, and every of them, should be taken and understood of you, after such sort, order, and degree, as appertaineth accordingly, we have caused, by the like assent and agreement of our said Bishops, and other learned men, the said articles to be divided into two sorts, whereof the one part con∣taineth such as be commanded expressly by God, and be necessary to our salvation; and the other containeth such things as have been of a long continuance, for a decentorder and honest policy, prudently instituted, and used in the churches of our realm, and be for that same purpose and end to be observed and kept accordingly,
<PB N="441" REF="488"/>although they be not expressly commanded of God, nor necessary to our salvation: wherefore we will and require you to accept of the same, after such sort as we have here prescribed them unto you, and to conform yourselves obediently unto the same; whereby you shall not only attain that most charitable unity and loving concord, whereof shall ensue your incomparable commodity, profit, and lucre, as well spiritual as other, but also, you shall not a little encourage us to take farther travels, pains, and labours for your commodities in all such other matters as in time to come may hap∣pen to occur, and as it shall be most to the honour of God, the profit, tranquillity, and quietness of all you our most loving subjects.</P>

<P><HI>First,</HI> As touching the chief and principal articles of our faith, syth it is thus agreed, as hereafter follows, by the whole clergy of this realm, We will that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our peo∣ple, by us committed to their spiritual charge, that they ought and must most constantly believe and de∣fend all those things to be true, which be comprehended in the whole body and canon of the Bible, and also in the three creeds or symbols, whereof one was made by the apostles, and is the common creed, which every man useth. The second was made by the holy coun∣cil of Nice, and is said daily in the mass: and the third was made by Athanasius, and is comprehended in the psalm <HI>Quincunque vult. &amp;c.</HI> And that they ought and must take, and interpret all the same things, ac∣cording to the self-same sentence and interpretation, which the words of the self-same creeds or symbols do purport, and the holy approved doctors of the church do intreat and defend the same.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That they ought and must repute, hold, and take, all the same things for the most holy, most sure,

<P><HI>Item,</HI> That it is offered unto all men, as well infants as such as have the use of reason, that by baptism they shall have remission of sins, and the grace and favour of God, according to the saying of Christ, <HI>Qui credi∣derit et baptisatus fuerit, salvus erit</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi.</NOTE>: that is to say, Whosoever believeth, and is baptised, shall be saved.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That the promise of grace and everlasting life (which promise is adjoined unto this sacrament of baptism) pertaineth not only unto such as have the use of reason, but also to infants, innocents, and children; and they ought therefore, and must needs be baptised: and that by the sacrament of baptism, they do also obtain remission of their sins, the grace and favour of God, and be made thereby the very sons and chil∣dren of God: insomuch as infants and children dying in their infancy shall undoubtedly be saved thereby, and else not.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That infants must needs be christened, be∣cause they be born in original sin, which sin must needs be remitted, which cannot be done, but by the sacra∣ment of baptism, whereby they receive the Holy Ghost, which exerciseth his grace and efficacy in them, and cleanseth and purifieth them from sin, by his most secret virtue and operation.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That children or men, once baptised, can nor ought ever to be baptised again.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That they ought to repute and take all the Anabaptists and the Pelagians opinions, contrary to the premisses, and every other man's opinion, agree∣able unto the said Anabaptists or the Pelagians opinions in this behalf, for detestable heresies, and utterly to be condemned.</P>
<PB N="444" REF="491"/>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That men or children, having the use of rea∣son, and willing and desiring to be baptised, shall, by the virtue of that holy sacrament, obtain the grace and remission of all their sins, if they shall come thereunto perfectly and truly repentant and contrite of all their sins before committed; and also perfectly and constantly confessing and believing all the articles of our faith, according as it was mentioned in the first article.</P>
<P>And finally, If they shall also have firm credence and trust in the promise of God, adjoined to the said sacrament; that is to say, that in and by this said sacrament, which they shall receive, God the Father giveth unto them, for his son Jesus Christ's sake, re∣mission of all their sins, and the grace of the Holy Ghost, whereby they be newly regenerated, and made the very children of God, according to the saying of St. John, and the Apostle St. Peter, <HI>Delictorum poeni∣tentiam agite, et baptizetur unusquisque vestrum in nomine Jesu Christi, in remissionem peccatorum, et accipietis donum Spiritus Sancti</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. iii. Luke iii. Acts ii.</NOTE>: that is to say, Do penance for your sins, and be each of you baptised in the name of Jesus Christ, and you shall obtain remission of your sins, and shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And according also to the saying of St. Paul, <HI>Non ex operibus justitiae, quae fecimus nos, sed secundum suam misericordiam salvos nos fecit per lavacrum regenerationis et renovationis Spiritus Sancti, quem effudit in nos opulente per Jesum Chris∣tum Servatorem nostrum, ut justificati illius gratia heredes efficiamur juxta spem vitae eternae</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Titus iii.</NOTE>: that is to say, God hath not saved us for the works of justice, which we have done, but of his mercy, by baptism, and reno∣vation of the Holy Ghost, whom he hath poured out upon us most plentifully for the love of Jesus Christ our Saviour, to the intent that we being justified by his grace, should be made the inheritors of everlasting life, according to our hope.</P>

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Concerning the sacrament of penance we will, that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people committed by us unto their spiritual charge, that they ought and must most constantly believe, that that sacrament was instituted of Christ in the New Testament, as a thing so necessary for man's salvation, that no man, which after his baptism is fallen again, and hath committed deadly sin, can without the same be saved, or attain everlasting life.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That like as such men, which after baptism do fall again into sin, if they do not penance in this life, shall undoubtedly be damned; even so whensoever the same men shall convert themselves from their naughty life, and do such penance for the same, as Christ requireth of them, they shall without doubt attain remission of their sins, and shall be saved.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That the sacrament of perfect penance, which Christ requireth of such manner of persons, consisteth of three parts; that is to say, contrition, confession, and the amendment of the former life, and a new obe∣dient reconciliation unto the laws and will of God; that is to say, exterior acts in works of charity, ac∣cording as they be commanded of God, which be called in scripture, <HI>fructus digni poenitentia,</HI> the worthy fruits of penance.</P>
<P>Furthermore, as touching contrition, which is the first part, we will that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people, committed by us unto their spiritual charge, that the said contrition consisteth in two special parts, which must always be conjoined together, and cannot be dissevered, that is to say, the penitent and contrite man must first acknowledge the filthiness and abomination of his own sin (unto which knowledge he is brought by hearing and considering the will of God, declared in his laws); and feeling
<PB N="446" REF="493"/>and perceiving in his own conscience, that God is angry, and displeased with him for the same, he must also conceive not only great sorrow and inward shame, that he hath so grievously offended God, but also great fear of God's displeasure towards him, considering he hath no works or merits of his own, which he may worthily lay before God, as sufficient satisfaction for his sins: which done, then afterward with this fear, shame, and sorrow, must needs succeed and be conjoined the second part, that is to wit, a certain faith, trust, and confidence, of the mercy and goodness of God, whereby the penitent must conceive certain hope and faith, that God will forgive him his sins, and repute him justified, and of the number of his elect children, not for the worthiness of any merit or work done by the penitent, but for the only merits of the blood and passion of our Saviour Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That this certain faith and hope is gotten and also confirmed and made more strong by the applying of Christ's words and promises of his grace and favour, contained in his gospel and the sacrament instituted by him in the New Testament: and therefore to attain this certain faith, the second part of penance is neces∣sary, that is to say, confession to a priest, if it may be had; for the absolution given by the priest was instituted of Christ, to apply the promises of God's grace and favour to the penitent.</P>
<P>Wherefore as touching confession, we will that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people committed by us to their spiritual charge, that they ought and must certainly believe, that the words of absolution, pronounced by the priest, be spoken by the authority given to him by Christ in the gospel.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That they ought and must give no less faith and credence to the same words of absolution, so pronounced by the ministers of the church, than they would give unto the very words and voice of God himself, if he should speak unto us out of heaven,
<PB N="447" REF="494"/>according to the saying of Christ, <HI>Quorumcunque remise∣ritis peccata, remittuntur eis: quorumcunque retinueritis, re∣tenta sunt</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xx. Luke x.</NOTE>: that is to say, Whose sins soever ye do for∣give, shall be forgiven: whose sins soever ye do retain, shall be retained. And again, in another place, Christ saith, <HI>Qui vos audit, me audit</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke x.</NOTE>, &amp;c. that is to say, Whosoever heareth you, heareth me, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That in no wise they do contemn this auri∣cular confession, which is made unto the ministers of the church; but that they ought to repute the same as a very expedient and necessary mean. Whereby they may require and ask this absolution at the priests hands, at such time as they shall find their consciences grieved with mortal sin, and have occasion so to do; to the intent they may thereby attain certain comfort and consolation of their consciences.</P>
<P>As touching the third part of penance, we will, that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people, committed by us to their spiritual charge, that although Christ and his death be the sufficient ob∣lation, sacrifice, satisfaction, and recompence, for the which God the Father forgiveth and remitteth to all sinners not only their sin, but also eternal pain due for the same: yet all men truly penitent, contrite, and confessed, must needs also bring forth the fruits of penance, that is to say, prayer, fasting, alms deeds, and must make restitution or satisfaction in will and deed to their neighbours, in such things as they have done them wrong and injury in, and also must do all other good works of mercy and charity, and express their obedient will in the executing and fulfilling of God's commandment outwardly, when time, power, and occasion, shall be ministered unto them, or else they shall never be saved. For this is the express precept and commandment of God, <HI>Agite fructus dignos poenitentiae</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke iii.</NOTE>: that is to say, Do you the worthy fruits of penance.
<PB N="448" REF="495"/>And St. Paul saith, <HI>Quemadmodum praebuistis membra vestra serva immunditiae, et iniquitati, ad aliam atque aliam iniquitatem: sic et nunc praebete membra vestra serva jus∣titiae ad sanctificationem,</HI> &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii.</NOTE>: that is to say, Like as times past you have given and applied yourselves, and all the members of your body, to all filthy living and wickedness, continually increasing the same: in like manner now you must give and apply yourselves wholly to justice, increasing continually in purity and cleanness of life. And in another place he saith, <HI>Castigo corpus meum, et in servitutem redigo</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ix.</NOTE>: that is to say, I chastise and subdue my carnal body, and the affections of the same, and make them obedient unto the spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That these precepts and works of charity be necessary works to our salvation, and God necessarily requireth, that every penitent man shall perform the same, whensoever time, power, and occasion, shall be ministered unto him so to do.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That by penance and such good works of the same, we shall not only obtain everlasting life, but also we shall deserve remission or mitigation of these present pains and afflictions in this world, according to the saying of St. Paul, <HI>Si nos ipsi judicaremus, non judicaremur a Domino</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi.</NOTE>: that is to say, If we would correct and take punishment of ourselves, we should not be so grievously corrected of God. And Zacha∣rias, the prophet, saith, <HI>Convertimini ad me, et ego con∣vertar ad vos</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Zach. i.</NOTE>: that is to say, Turn yourselves unto me, and I will turn again unto you.—And the pro∣phet Esai saith, <HI>Frange essurienti panem tuum, et egenos vagosque induc in domum tuam.

<PB N="449" REF="496"/>adsum. Tunc orietur in tenebris lux tua, et tenebrae tuae erunt sicut meridies, et requiem tibi dabit Dominus semper, et implebit splendoribus animam tuam, et ossa tua liberabit, et eris quasi hortus irriguus, et sicut fons aquarum, cujus non deficient aquae,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah lviii.</NOTE>: that is to say, Break and deal thy bread unto the hungry, bring into thy house the poor man and such as want harbour. When thou seest a naked man, give him cloaths to cover him with, and refuse not to succour and help the poor and needy, for he is thine own flesh: and if thou wilt thus do, then shall thy light glister out as bright as the sun in the morning, and thy health shall sooner arise unto thee, and thy justice shall go before thy face, and the glory of God shall gather thee up that thou shalt not fall: and whensoever thou shalt call upon God, God shall hear thee: and whensoever thou shalt cry unto God, God shall say, Lo, here I am, ready to help thee. Then shall thy light overcome all dark∣ness, and thy darkness shall be as bright as the sun at noon-day, and then God shall give unto thee continual rest, and shall fulfil thy soul with brightness, and shall deliver thy body from adversity, and then thou shalt be like a garden that most plentifully bringeth forth all kind of fruits, and like the well-spring that never shall want water, &amp;c.</P>
<P>These things and such other should be continually taught and inculked into the ears of our people, to the intent to stir and provoke them unto good works, and by the self-same good works to exercise and confirm their faith, and hope and look for to receive at God's hand mitigation and remission of the miseries, cala∣mities, and grievous punishments, which God sendeth to men in this world for their sins.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>SACRAMENT</HI> of the <HI>ALTAR.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As touching the sacrament of the altar, we will, that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people, committed by us unto their spi∣ritual charge, that they ought and must constantly be∣lieve, that under the form and figure of bread and wine, which we there presently do see and perceive by outward senses, is verily, substantially, and really contained and comprehended the very self-same body and blood of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which was born of the Virgin Mary, and suffered upon the cross for our redemption: and that, under the same form and figure of bread and wine, the very self-same body and blood of Christ is corporally, really, and in the very substance, exhibited, distributed, and received, unto, and of, all them which receive the said sacrament: and that therefore the said sacrament is to be used with all due reverence and honour: and that every man ought first to prove and examine himself, and religiously to try and search his own conscience, before he shall receive the same, according to the say∣ing of St. Paul, <HI>Quisquis ederit panem hunc, aut biberit de poculo Domini indigne, reus erit corporis et sanguinis Domini. Probet igitur seipsum homo, et sic de pane illo edat et de poculo illo bibat: nam qui edit aut bibit indigne, judicium sibi manducat et bibit, non dijudicans corpus Do∣mini</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi.</NOTE>: that is to say, Whosoever eateth this body of Christ unworthily, or drinketh of this blood of Christ unworthily, shall be guilty of the very body and blood of Christ. Wherefore let every man first prove himself, and so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this drink: for whosoever eateth it or drinketh it unworthily, he eateth and drinketh it to his own damnation; because he putteth no difference between the very body of Christ and other kinds of meat.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="451" REF="498"/>
<HEAD>JUSTIFICATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> As touching the order and cause of our justification, we will, that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people, committed by us to their spiritual charge, that this word justification signifieth remission of our sins, and our acceptation or reconciliation into the grace and favour of God: that is to say, our perfect renovation in Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That sinners attain this justification by con∣trition, and faith joined with charity, after such sort and manner as we before mentioned and declared: not as tho' our contrition or faith, or any works proceed∣ing thereof, can worthily merit or deserve to attain the said justification; for the only mercy and grace of the Father, promised freely unto us for his Son's sake Jesus Christ, and the merits of his blood and passion, be the only sufficient and worthy causes thereof. And yet, that notwithstanding to the attaining of the same justification God requireth to be in us not only in∣ward contrition, perfect faith and charity, certain hope and confidence, with all other spiritual graces and motions, which, as we said before, must necessarily concur in the remission of our sins, that is to say, our justification: but also he requireth and commandeth us, that, after we be justified, we must also have good works of charity, and obedience towards God, in the observing and fulfilling outwardly of his laws and commandments; for although acceptation to everlast∣ing life, be conjoined with justification, yet our good works be necessarily required, to the attaining of ever∣lasting life: and we, being justified, be necessarily bound, and it is our necessary duty to do good works, according to the saying of St. Paul, <HI>Debitores sumus non carni, ut secundum vivamus, nam si secundum carnem vixerimus, moriemur. Sin autem spiritu facta corporis mortificaverimus, vivemus. Etenim quicunque spiritu Dei ducuntur, hii sunt filii
<PB N="452" REF="499"/>Dei</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii.</NOTE>: that is to say, We be bound not to live according to the flesh, and to fleshly appetites: for if we will live so, we shall undoubtedly be damned. And con∣trary, if we mortify the deeds of our flesh, and live according to the spirit, we shall be saved. For who∣soever be led by the spirit of God, they be the chil∣dren of God. And Christ saith, <HI>Si vis ad vitam ingredi, serva mandata</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. xix.</NOTE>: that is to say, If ye will come to heaven, keep the commandments. And St. Paul, speaking of evil works, saith, <HI>Qui talia agunt, regnum Dei non possidebunt</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. v.</NOTE>: that is to say, Whosoever commit sinful deeds, shall never come to heaven.</P>
<P>Wherefore we will, that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people, committed by us unto their spiritual charge, that God necessarily requi∣reth of us, to do good works commanded by him, and that not only outward and civil works, but also the inward spiritual motions and graces of the Holy Ghost: that is to say, To dread and fear God, to love God, to have firm confidence and trust in God, to invocate and call upon God, to have patience in all adversities, to hate sin, and to have certain pur∣pose and will not to sin again, and such other like motions and virtues. For Christ saith, <HI>Nisi abundave∣rit justitia vestra plusquam Scribarum et Phariseorum, non intrabitis in regnum coelorum</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Matt. v.</NOTE>: that is to say, We must not only do outward, civil, good works, but also we must have these aforesaid inward spiritual motions, consenting and agreeable to the laws of God.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Articles concerning the laudable ceremonies used in the church; and, first, Of <HI>IMAGES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As touching images, truth it is, that the same have been uesd in the Old Testament, and also for the great
<PB N="453" REF="500"/>abuses of them sometime destroyed and put down: and in the New Testament they have been also allowed, as good authors do declare. Wherefore we will, that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people, committed by us to their spiritual charge, how they ought and may use them: and first that they may be attributed unto them, that they be representers of virtue and good example; and that they also be by occasion the kindlers and stirrers of mens minds, and make men oft to remember and lament their sins and offences, especially the images of Christ and our Lady: and that therefore it is mete, that they should stand in the churches, and none otherwise to be esteemed. And to the intent the rude people should not thenceforth take superstition, as in time past it is thought that the same hath used to do, we will, that our Bishops and Preachers diligently shall teach them, and according to this doctrine reform their abuses: for else there might fortune idola∣try to ensue, which God forbid. And as for censing of them, and kneeling and offering unto them, with other like worships, although the same hath entered by devotion, and fallen to custom, yet the people ought to be diligently taught, that they in no wise do it, nor think it meet to be done to the same images, but only to be done to God and in his honour, although it be done before the images, whether it be of Christ, of the Gross, of our Lady, or of any other Saint beside.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> HONOURING <HI>of</HI> SAINTS.</HEAD>
<P>As touching the honouring of saints, we will, that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people, committed by us unto their spiritual charge, that saints now being with Christ in heaven be to be honoured of Christian people on earch, but not with that confidence and honour which are only due unto God,
<PB N="454" REF="501"/>trusting to attain at their hands that which must be had only of God; but that they be thus to be honoured, because they be known the elect persons of Christ, because they be passed in godly life out of this tran∣sitory world, because they already do reign in glory with Christ, and most especially to laud and praise Christ in them for their excellent virtues, which he planted in them, for example of and by them to such as are yet in this world to live in virtue and goodness; and also not to fear to die for Christ, and his cause, as some of them did: and finally to take them in that they may be the advancers of our prayers and demands unto Christ. By these ways, and such like, be saints to be honoured and had in reverence, and by none other.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> PRAYING <HI>to</HI> SAINTS.</HEAD>
<P>As touching praying to saints, we will, that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people, committed by us unto their spiritual charge, that albeit grace, remission of sin, and salvation, cannot be obtained but of God only by the mediation of our Saviour Christ, which is only sufficient mediator for our sins: yet it is very laudable to pray to saints in heaven everlastingly living, whose charity is ever permanent to be intercessors and to pray for us, and with us unto Almighty God after this manner, <HI>all holy angels,</HI> and saints in heaven, pray for us, and with us, unto the Father, that for his dear Son Jesus Christ's sake, we may have grace of him and remis∣sion of our sins, with an earnest purpose (not wanting ghostly strength) to observe and keep his holy com∣mandments, and never to decline from the same again unto our lives end. And in this manner we may pray to our blessed Lady, to St. John Baptist, to all and every the Apostles, or any other saint particularly, as our devotion doth serve us: so that it be done with∣out any vain superstition as to think that any saint is more merciful, or will hear us sooner than Christ, or
<PB N="455" REF="502"/>that any saint doth serve for one thing more than other, or is patron of the same. And likewise we must keep holidays unto God, in memory of him and his saints, upon such days as the church hath ordained their memories to be celebrated; except they be mitigated and moderated by the assent and commandment of us the supreme head to the ordinaries, and then the sub∣jects ought to obey it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> RITES <HI>and</HI> CEREMONIES.</HEAD>
<P>As concerning the rites and ceremonies of Christ's church, as to have such <HI>vestments</HI> in doing God's ser∣vice, as be and have been most part used; as sprink∣ling of <HI>holy water,</HI> to put us in remembrance of our baptism, and the blood of Christ sprinkled for our redemption upon the cross: giving of <HI>holy bread,</HI> to put us in remembrance of the sacrament of the altar, that all Christian men be one body mystical of Christ, as the bread is made of many grains and yet but one loaf, and to put us in remembrance of the receiving the holy sacrament and body of Christ, the which we ought to receive in right charity, which, in the beginning of Christ's church, men did more often re∣ceive, than they use now-a-days to do: bearing of <HI>candles</HI> on Candlemas-day, in memory of Christ the spiritual light, of whom Simon did prophesy, as is read in the church that day; giving of <HI>ashes</HI> on Ash-Wednesday, to put in remembrance every Christian man, in the beginning of Lent and penance, that he is but ashes and earth, and thereto shall return, which is right necessary to be uttered from henceforth, in our mother tongue, always on the same day: bear∣ing of <HI>palms</HI> on Palm Sunday, in memory of the receiv∣ing of Christ into Jerusalem a little before his death, that we may have the same desire to receive him into our hearts: <HI>creeping</HI> to the cross, and humbling our∣selves to Christ on Good-Friday before the Cross, and
<PB N="456" REF="503"/>there offering unto Christ before the same, and kiss∣ing of it in memory of our redemption by Christ made upon the cross: setting up the <HI>sepulture</HI> of Christ, whose body, after his death, was buried: the <HI>hal∣lowing</HI> of the font, and other like exorcisms, and bene∣dictions, by the ministers of Christ's church, and all other like laudable customs, rites, and ceremonies, be not to be contemned and cast away, but to be used and continued as things good and laudable, to put us in remembrance of those spiritual things that they do signify, not suffering them to be forgotten, or to be put in oblivion, but renewing them in our memories from time to time: but none of these ceremonies have power to remit sin, but only to stir and lift up our minds unto God, by whom only our sins be forgiven.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> PURGATORY.</HEAD>
<P>Forasmuch as due order of charity requireth, and the book of Maccabees, and divers ancient doctors, plainly shew, that it is a very good and charitable deed to pray for souls departed: and forasmuch also as such usage hath continued in the church so many years, even from the beginning, we will, that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people, committed by us unto their spiritual charge, that no man ought to be grieved with the continuance of the same, and that it standeth with the very due order of charity, a Christian man to pray for souls departed, and to com∣mit them in our prayers to God's mercy, and also to cause others to pray for them in masses and exequies, and to give alms to others to pray for them, whereby they may be relieved and holpen of some part of their pain. But forasmuch as the place where they be, the name thereof, and kind of pains there also, be to us uncertain by scripture, therefore this, with all other things, we remit to Almighty God, into whose mercy it is mete and convenient for us to recommend them,
<PB N="457" REF="504"/>trusting that God accepteth our prayers for them, re∣serring the rest wholly to God, to whom is known their estate and condition: wherefore it is much neces∣sary that such abuses be clearly put away, which, un∣der the name of purgatory, hath been advanced, as to make men believe, that through the Bishop of Rome's pardon souls might clearly be delivered out of purgatory, and all the pains of it: or that masses said at <HI>scala coeli,</HI> or other where, in any place, or before any image, might likewise deliver them from all their pain, and send them straight to heaven, and other like abuses.</P>
<P>These constitutions or articles, (commonly called Henry VIII.'s creed) were signed by Thomas Crom∣well, the King's Vicar-general, Archbishop Cranmer, seventeen Bishops, forty Abbots or Priors, and fifty Archdeacons or deputies from the lower-house of con∣vocation, among whom were two Italians, viz. Peter Vannes, Archdeacon of Worcester, and sometime one of the King's agents at Rome to solicit the divorce, and Polydore Virgil, who was Archdeacon of Wells, and wrote a Latin history of England, and was the last Collector of Peter Pence in this kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reason why confirmation is not mentioned in the pre∣ceding articles, may partly appear from the answers to the following questions, preserved in manuscript in the British Museum. The first three answers are said to be by John Capon Bishop of Bangor, and the other three by Archbishop Cranmer.
<P>Question I. Whether the sacrament of confirmation be of the New Testament institution, or not?</P>
<P>Answer. Not of Christ, but since the time of the New Testament preached so far as we know by scripture; but of the footsteps of the church.</P>
<P>Question II. What is the outward sign and thing signified in this sacrament?</P>
<P>Answer. I answer, the outward signs be the unctions with chrism, and certain words thereunto appointed. As to the invisible grace promised by scripture, we find none; but, by Doctors, we find that thereby is given ghostly strength to confess boldly the faith, and to resist the temptations of the adversary.</P>
<P>Question III. What promises be made that the said gifts shall be received by this sacrament?</P>
<P>Answer. I answer, as to the promise made by scripture we find none. The Doctors only write, that by this sacrament be received the gifts above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Question I. Whether confirmation be instituted by Christ?</P>
<P>Answer. There is no place in scripture that declareth this sacra∣ment to be instituted by Christ; for, first, the places alledged for the same be no institution, but the acts and deeds of the apostles. Se∣condly, those acts and deeds were done for special use by the apostles for the confirmation of the godly word spoken at that time. Thirdly, that the said special use doth not now remain with the ministers, successors of the apostles.</P>
<P>Question II. What is the external sign?</P>
<P>Answer. The church useth cream for the exterior sign, but the scripture maketh no mention thereof.</P>
<P>Question. III. What is the efficacy of this sacrament?</P>
<P>Answer. The Bishop, in the name of the church, doth invocate the Holy Ghost, to give strength and constancy, with other spiritual gifts, unto the person confirmed; so that the efficacy of this sacra∣ment is of such value, as is the prayer of the Bishop made in the name of the church.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="458" REF="505"/>
<P>Although the corporal presence in the sacrament, the necessity of auricular confession, the applying to saints as intercessors, and the keeping up of images, were retained as articles of faith; yet those, who were dissatisfied with these tenets, hoped that they might in time be abolished.</P>
<P>It was at this juncture that the excessive number of holidays was reduced; the feasts of the patrons of churches laid aside, and those of their dedication (com∣monly called <HI>Wakes</HI>) ordered to be observed, all over the kingdom, only on the first Sunday in October. The Bishops also, in their injunctions, now required the Epistle and Gospel to be read in English, ordered an English Bible to be provided in all parishes (with <HI>The Institution for the necessary erudition of a Christian man</HI>) to be explained to the people; who were instruct∣ed, that they could be saved only by the mercy of God, and the merits of Christ, and were not to worship, kneel, offer lights or gifts, to any image; and all,
<PB N="459" REF="506"/>to which there was any resort, on account of any supposed peculiar excellence, were taken away.</P>
<P>As the Pope had called a general council at Mantua, where he expected to be master of all debates, the convocation, on July 20, the last day of the session, declared their opinion, "That, though nothing was better instituted by the ancient fathers, for the establish∣ment of the faith, the extirpation of heresies, the heal∣ing of schisms, and the unity of the Christian church, than general councils, gathered in the Holy Ghost, duly called to an indifferent place, with other necessary requisites; so, on the other hand, nothing would pro∣duce more baleful effects, than a general council called upon private malice, ambition, or other carnal motives; and Christian Princes, by whose general consent it was to be called, ought to use their endeavours to prevent so great a mischief." The King, satisfied with this decision of his clergy, published a protest against the council summoned to meet at Mantua; shewing, "That the Pope had no power to call one, it belong∣ing now to Christian Princes, as it formerly did to the Emperors; that the Pope had no jurisdiction in Eng∣land, and could summon none from thence; that the place was neither safe nor proper, and nothing could be done to any purpose if the Pope presided in it, since one of the chief reasons, for desiring a council, was, the reducing his power within its old limit; that he much desired a free general council, but he was sure this could not be so, the Pope having called it at a time when the Emperor and the King of France were at war, knowing that few would come to it, and he might carry things as he pleased; that it was unsafe for any Englishman to go to Mantua, and Popes had so often broke their oaths and promises, that there was no relying on their safe-conducts; that himself had no reason to trust the Pope, who had, for three years past, been stirring up all Christendom against him, and tried all ways possible to create him trouble; that he would
<PB N="460" REF="507"/>not go to any council called by a Bishop of Rome; but, in case of a general peace between Christian Princes, would gladly hearken to a true general coun∣cil, and, in the mean time, would preserve all the ar∣ticles of faith in his kingdom." It was on these ac∣counts, that he protested against any council's being held at Mantua, or any where else, by the Bishop of Rome's authority, and declared, he would neither ac∣knowledge it, nor receive any of its decrees.</P>
<P>The people of England, who had long groaned un∣der the burthen of Papal exactions, were generally pleased with the abolishing the Pope's supremacy; but were not so well satisfied with the late suppression of religious houses; thinking it as well unjust, that they should be destroyed for the delinquency of a few indi∣viduals, as sacrilegious, that what the piety of their ancestors had dedicated to God, should be converted to prophane uses. The gentry used to provide for their younger children, and decayed friends, in those houses, and to be entertained themselves at the Abbots tables: travellers were lodged there, and the poor relieved, by the alms daily distributed at monasteries. The act of parliament, which suppressed them, obliged the far∣mers, to whom the scites of convents were leased by the crown, to keep up the usual hospitality; and the King sold the houses and lands to gentlemen at the easier rates for that purpose, and to make it their interest to support what had been done: but this hospitality was probably not exercised, even at first, with the same freedom and plenty, as it had been done by the Monks, and was, in a little time, dropped entirely. Books had been written, to expose the vices, crimes, and impostures of the religious: but this did not hinder their being pitied, when shoals of them, wandering from place to place, in a distressed and begging con∣dition, told their own tale, and complained of the cruelty or impiety of their treatment.

They all protested on oath, that "they engaged in this undertaking for the love of God, the preserva∣tion of the King's person and issue, the purifying of the nobility, the outing of all low-born and evil coun∣sellors, and not for their private advantage, or with any malicious intent, having only in their view the cross and faith of Christ, the restitution of the church, and the suppression of heretics and their doctrines." To countenance these pretences, which gained them many partizans, they restored the religious to several dissolved monasteries; and, to draw in the common people, gave out, "that the King designed to get all the gold of England into his own hands, under colour of recoining it; that he would seize all unmarked cat∣tle, and all the ornaments of parish-churches; and they should be forced to pay for christenings, mar∣riages, and burials (orders having been given for keeping registers thereof) and for licences to eat white bread." Edward Lee, Archbishop of York, and Thomas Lord Darcy, both suspected of promoting the insurrection, were in Pontefract castle; and surrender∣ing it to them, took their oath of engagement. The insurgents reduced York and Hull: but the castles of Skipton and Scarborough held out against all their ef∣forts; the first being defended by Henry Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, although he was forsaken by 500 gen∣tlemen, whom he retained at his own expences; and the latter by Sir Ralph Euers, though he and his gar∣rison tasted no other food for four and twenty hours than simple bread and water.</P>
<P>The example of the Archbishop and Darcy tempt∣ing the commons of Richmondshire, Durham, West∣moreland, and Lancashire, to rise, George Talbot,
<PB N="464" REF="511"/>Earl of Shrewsbury, marched against them with so much zeal and diligence, that he did not wait Henry's sending him a commission, not doubting but his ser∣vices would merit a pardon for this presumption. The King made him commander in chief of all his forces in the North; and, ordering the Duke of Suffolk to stay in Lincolnshire, to keep that county quiet, sent, on October 20, Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and Henry Courtenay, Marquis of Exeter, with some forces, to Shrewsbury's assistance. Henry proposed to follow in person with a greater body; and had issued a general summons for all his nobility to meet him, on November 7, at Northampton; but was diverted from it by Norfolk and Shrewsbury, who thought the best way of reducing the rebels, was to gain them by amu∣sing them with treaties; their number being so very great, that they could not keep long together for want of provisions. The Earl sent an herald to them with a proclamation, requiring them to lay down their arms, and submit to the King's mercy: but Aske, who as∣sumed all the state of a Prince, rather than of a gene∣ral, would not suffer it to be read, when he under∣stood the contents. The King's troops did not exceed 5000 men; and with these the noblemen took post at Doncaster, fortifying the bridge, and lining the river with their men, to hinder the rebels marching south∣wards. Aske, with an army at least six times more numerous, had resolved to force a passage: but heavy rains falling on the two days he had appointed for that purpose, the fords became unpassable; and Norfolk made use of that disappointment to engage him in a treaty. This afforded an opportunity for some agents he had employed among the rebels to insinuate, that their leaders were making terms for themselves, and would leave the rest to be hanged or ruined. The poorer sort, whom Aske would not suffer to plunder the country for subsistence, were already reduced to great necessities; and hearkening the more readily to
<PB N="465" REF="512"/>these suggestions, disbanded apace. Norfolk, seeing the success of his measures, proposed their sending de∣puties to court with their demands; oftering to go along with them, and intercede in their behalf. This he knew would take up some time, and most of them would disperse before his return. Sir Robert Ellerker, and Robert Bowes, two gentlemen that had been taken at Hull, and forced to go with them, were sent to Windsor; and the answer was delayed, till most of them had disbanded: but the King, hearing that they had engaged to return upon notice, and that they re∣sented their not receiving an answer, sent the Duke of Norfolk to them with a general pardon; six only ex∣cepted by name, and four others not named. As the insurgents had no prospect of sufficient redress of their complaints, and every one dreading himself to be one of the four, they rejected the proposal; though the King, to pacify them a little, had, by new injunctions, ordered all the usual ceremonies of the church to be continued by the clergy.</P>
<P>It was necessary to come to a new treaty with the rebels; and 300 of them had safe-conducts for coming, on December 6, to Doncaster, where it was to be set∣tled with his Majesty's commissioners. There were hopes, that, in so great a number, some might fall out with the rest, and disagree in what was to be ask∣ed: but as this had been adjusted in a meeting of the clergy, that sided with the insurgents, at Pontefract, they all agreed in their demands. These were, "a general pardon; a parliament to be held at York; courts of justice to be fixed there, for deciding all law∣suits north of Trent; a repeal of the acts of parlia∣ment for uses; for making words misprision of trea∣son; for the clergy's paying tenths and first-fruits to the King; and for the last subsidy. They desired the Princess Mary might be restored to her right of suc∣cession, the Pope to his late jurisdiction, and the reli∣gious to their convents; that the Lutherans might be
<PB N="466" REF="513"/>punished; that Audeley, the Lord Chancellor, and Cromwell, Lord Privy Seal, might be excluded from the next parliament; and that Lee and Leighton, who had visited the monasteries, might be imprisoned for bribery and extortion." The rebels made some other requests, but in such general terms, that the King ea∣sily put them off with a general answer; and the Duke of Norfolk writing him word with regard to the rest, that he thought a general pardon; and a parliament in the North, would content them, the King, on De∣cember 9, granted them, under the great seal, a ge∣neral and free pardon of all rebellions, treasons, fe∣lonies, and trespasses, to that day, if they made their submission to the Duke of Norfolk and Earl of Shrews∣bury, and did not repeat their offence. These terms being accepted, the rebels dispersed; and Norfolk and Shrewsbury being ordered to stay in the country with their forces till things were fully composed, brought them all to an entire submission; obliging them to re∣nounce their oaths made during the rebellion, and to take a new one for their future good behaviour. The Lord Darcy and Aske were sent to London, where the former was imprisoned in the Tower; but the latter was well received, the King having a mind either to engage him in his service, or to get from him a disco∣very of such abbots as had furnished money, and of other persons in different parts of the realm, who had favoured the Yorkshire insurrection.</P>
<P>A. D. 1537.] Whether people were apprehensive that the pardon would not be inviolably observed,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Another insurrec∣tion in the North.</NOTE> or whether the clergy, dissatisfied at not obtaining all their demands, spirited them up anew, clandestine meetings were held in the beginning of this year, and there broke out, in February, another commotion in the North, though not so dangerous as the former. Two gentlemen of Cumberland, Nicholas Musgrave and Thomas Tilby, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sing a body of 8000 men, attacked Carlisle: but
<PB N="467" REF="514"/>being repulsed by the citizens, were in their return routed by the Duke of Norfolk, who put all the offi∣cers (except Musgrave, that escaped) to death by mar∣tial law, with about seventy other persons. Sir Fran∣cis Biggot, and one Helam, attempting to surprise Hull, were taken and executed. There were several other risings in the country, and Aske, quitting the court without leave, had embarked in one of them; but they were soon crushed. The pretence for them was, that a parliament was not held at York, as had been promised: but the King said, the rebels had not kept conditions with him, and he would not call one till all was quiet. The Duke of Norfolk, displaying the royal banner, executed martial law, where ever he saw it requisite; Aske was pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to death at Hull; other gentlemen, with some abbots and priors, at York, and in different towns of that county. The Lord Darcy was beheaded on Tower-hill, and the Lord Hussey at Lincoln. The former, at his trial, accused the Duke of Norfolk of having encouraged the rebels to persist in their demands: but this nobleman's great services set him above all suspicion. The Duke denied the charge, and offered to clear himself by single combat: but the King declared himself satisfied with his con∣duct. The executions were not all over till June; and the King, in the next month, published a general amnesty all over the North, which was received with great joy, and, putting an end to people's fears, re∣established the quiet of the country.</P>
<P>These risings seem to have been made purely for the Papal interests, without any encouragement on the part of the Emperor, with whom Henry had been on pretty good terms since his reconciliation with his daughter the Princess Mary, whom it was in his power to declare his heir, according to the late act for regu∣lating the succession.</P>
<P>The King of England's friendship with France ren∣dered him secure on the side of Scotland: it had al∣ready
<PB N="468" REF="515"/>defeated all the solicitations used by the Em∣peror and the Pope, to embark James V. in a quarrel with England: and this Prince being still more closely united to Francis, by the marriage of his daughter Madelaine, and, upon her decease in July, by a con∣tract for another, with Mary of Lorraine, daughter of Claude Duke of Guise, and widow of Louis II. Duke of Long<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eville, Henry had no apprehensions of being attacked from that quarter. The suppr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of the late rebellion discouraged all attempts of the like na∣ture, and rendered him absolute master of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The King, thinking himself free from all danger of a foreign invasion, ventured to put to death Thomas Fitzgerald, eldest son of Gerald, late Earl of Kildare, with his five uncles; who having, by the Emperor's encouragement, and promises of succours, raised, about three years before, a formidable rebellion in Ireland, and treated with the Pope for an investiture of the realm, to be held in vassalage of the see of Rome, had been forced the last year to sub∣mit to mercy, and been attainted soon after by a parliament held at Dublin. Leonard, Lord Grey, deputy of Ireland, to whom they had submitted, interceded strongly in their behalf, when he sent them prisoners to London: but the affairs of that kingdom being now settled, as well by some new laws, and a reception of the acts lately passed in Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, for extinguishing the Pope's power, for acknowledgment of the regal supremacy, and a grant of the twen∣tieth part of the value of ecclesiastical benefices to the crown, as by a peace with the O Neils; and the Kildare family being alone able to disturb the peace of that country, Henry thought proper, in Fe∣bruary, to give orders for their execution.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To these advantages was added, on October 12, the birth of a son, and undoubted heir of all his dominions,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Birth of Edward <HI>VI.</HI></NOTE> to the inexpressible joy of the whole nation, and as much to the King's satisfaction. It was a blessing which had been the subject of his most ardent visnes: but his joy on the occasion was greatly allayed by the death of the Queen, the best belo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of all his wives, and highly celebrated for her humility, goodness of nature, and sweetness of temper, who expired twelve days after, and was buried at Windsor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the course of this year, King Henry issued the following pro∣clamation against heresy and heretics, which recites, That of late many strangers, born out of this land, are arrived and come into this realm, which, albeit they were baptised in their infancy or childhood, according to the ordinance of the universal church of Christ; yet that notwithstanding, in contempt of the holy sacrament of bapti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, so given and received, they have, of their own pre∣sumption and authority, lately re-baptised themselves; and over and besides that, they deny the most blessed and holy sacramant of the altar to be really the very body of our Lord Jesus Christ; and yet farther, they keep, hold, and teach other divers and sundry pesti∣le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> heresies, against God and his holy scriptures, to the great un∣quietness of Christendom, and per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition of innumerable Christian souls; wherefore a great number of them have been lawfully and ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icially convicted of their detestable heresies, and have and shall suffer pain of death for the same, as reason and justice requireth in that behalf, the King's most Royal Majesty being supreme head in earth, under God, of the church of England, always intending to defend and maintain the faith of Christ, and the sacraments of holy church, and daily studying and intending, above all things, to save his lo∣ving subjects, members of the said church, from falling into any er∣roneous opinions and damnable heresies, into which they might hap∣pen to fall, and be infected by the communion and conversation of such seditious and erroneous persons, ordereth, and straitly chargeth and commandeth, that all and singular strangers now being in this his realm, as well such as have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecanted and revoked their said he∣resies, as others that have or do hold, and teach those or any other erroneous opinions or heresies against God, the holy scriptures, and the church, shall, within seven days next after this present procla∣mation, depart out of this his realm, and all other his dominions, on pain to suffer death, if they, contrary to this proclamation, do abide, and be apprehended or taken; and that no person hereafter, being of the same sects, and holding such erroneous opinions and heresies, upon like pain, repair into this his realm, or into any part or place of his dominion: and over this, his Highness strai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly char∣geth and commandeth, that none of his own faithful and loving subjects be so hardy as to hold, keep, and teach, any heresy or er∣rors, contrary to God and the holy scripture, upon like pain above remembered; willing and commanding, as well all prelates of holy church, and all nobles, mayors, justices, sheriffs, bailiffs, consta∣bles, and all other his ministers and loving subjects, that they, and every one of them, shall put their good and effectual endeavour for the apprehending of such as they shall hear or know to keep, hold, or teach, any such heresy, to the intent the offenders may receive due punishment, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of death, from time to time, as the case shall require. according to their merits, not failing so to do, as they will avoid and eschew the King's most high indignation and displea∣sure, and ans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers to his Majesty for the same at their uttermost peril.</NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="470" REF="519"/>the abbeys within his realm, considering them as semi∣naries for promoting disaffection to his government, and the Monks as subjects to the Pope rather than to him∣self, devoted wholly to the see of Rome, and seducing people to its obedience, by continual pretences to false miracles. With this view, he set on foot another vi∣sitation of monasteries: and the commissioners were ordered to enquire into every part of the conversation of the religious, their affection to the King and his supremacy, and their superstition; to discover what cheats and impostures there were in their several houses, with regard to images, relics, or other miraculous things, by which they had drawn people thither on pilgrimages, and gotten from them great presents; to examine how they stood affected during the late com∣motions, and to find out all their irregularities. This produced a detection of an infinite number of impurities, besides holy cheats, and pretended relics, made use of to encourage superstition, rather than devotion, in the people, and to draw them into pilgrimages and offer∣ings. The crimes of Sodom and Gomorrah are said to have been exceeded in Battel-abbey, Christ-church in Canterbury, and several other convents. The visitors found innumerable instances of whoredom, adultery, onanism, and other unnatural lusts and beastly practi∣ces; with arts to prevent conception, and procure ab∣ortion, among such nuns as were debauched. With respect to monkish idolatry and deceit, Reading seems to have been the repository of the nation. There was found the figure of an angel, with one wing, which the monks assirmed to have brought over the head of the spear that pierced the side of Jesus Christ, together with such an inventory of other relics, as filled up four sheets of paper. At St. Edmundsbury were some coals, said to be part of those that roasted St. Laurence, the parings of St. Edmund's toes, the pen knife and boots of St. Thomas Becket, a supposed great quantity of the real cross, and certain relics to

After the quelling of an insurrection, there could be no want of evidence to convict any of the superiors, who had assisted the rebels; and as they had now no privileges to screen them from civil judicature, they were glad to compound for their offences by a sur∣render of their monasteries. On one or other of these accounts, no less than 159 monasteries were resigned this year into the King's hands; and the practice still continued, few having the resolution to stand out, after so many examples, and a week scarce passing without some new surrender.</P>
<P>Whilst the King was rooting out supersti∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="inter">T. Becket's shrine demo∣lished.</NOTE> and buring such images as were the most in request for peculiar virtues and working wonders, he could not well overlook the fre∣quent pilgrimages, and rich presents, made to the shrine at Thomas Becket, commonly called <HI>St. Tho∣mas of Canterbury</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. i. p. 357 of this work.</NOTE>. This shrine excelled all others in England with respect to magnificence and opinion of sanctity: vast numbers of pilgrims resorted to it from all quarters, and even preferred it to those of Christ and the Blessed Virgin; for in one year, the offerings at the altar of Christ and his Mother did not exceed four pounds, while those at the shrine of Becket amounted to nine hundred and fifty-four. Henry could not endure that such a furious and obstinate rebel to his sovereign should be sainted for his defence of ec∣clesiastical liberties, derived only from papal grants, and contrary to the laws of the kingdom, and that a mistaken veneration should be still paid to his remains. His friends, not contented with keeping the day of his death (December 29) as an high festival, also ce∣lebrated July 7 as his translation; in every fiftieth year
<PB N="474" REF="523"/>there was a jubilee of fifteen days, during which in∣dulgences were granted to those who visited his shrine. It had been customary, after differences had crept in about religion, to carry on processes against the dead in the case of erroneous opinions: so Mr. Tracy of Tod∣dington in Gloucestershire had, a few years before, been condemned after his death for a heretick, only because when his will came to be proved, it appeared that he had commended his soul to God's mercy, through the merits of Christ, without any mention of the saints. The like process was used towards Becket; his life and actions were examined, the skull so much venerated at Canterbury, had never belonged to him, for the true skull lay in the same tomb with his bones, which the King ordered to be burned; the miracles ascribed to his relics ap∣peared to be forgeries, and being pronounced to be no saint, but a rebel and a traitor, orders were given to strike his name out of the kalendar, his office out of the breviary, and for abolishing the jubilee and holy days dedicated to his memory. The riches of the shrine (which was either demolished or burnt) were inestimable; the gold in it filling two large chests, each so heavy that eight strong men could scarce carry it out of the church; besides jewels, one of which, a fine stone, the offering of Lewis VII. of France, A. D. 1179, Henry afterwards wore upon his own finger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol. iii. p. 144. Smollet, vol. vi. p. 57.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This insult upon the honour of one of the most fa∣vourite pretended saints, that had ever been canonized at Rome, provoked all the partisans of that court to paint out Henry as the worst of tyrants, as the most sacrilegious mortal that ever breathed, as one that committed outrages, detested even by the heathens, upon the bodies of saints, and that made war with heaven. They compared him to Belshazzar, Nero, Domitian, Dioclesian, and especially to Julian the
<PB N="475" REF="524"/>apostate, whom he resembled in his learning and apos∣tacy, though he fell short of him in his morals. The superiors, religious, and clergy, that had been executed, either for the late rebellion, in which abun∣dance of them had embarked, or for endeavouring to raise another, were represented as so many martyrs for religion; and the suppression of monasteries, as the most ravenous and impious sacrilege. The bull, which Pope Paul III had signed, upon the execution of Cardinal Fisher, and Sir Thomas More<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 423 and 426 of this volume.</NOTE>, for depriving Henry of his crown, absolving his subjects from their allegiance, and forbidding all commerce with his kingdom, and which, after sending copies of it to several European courts, had been suspended during pleasure, was now publish∣ed, and every Christian potentate exhorted to make war with the King of England.</P>
<P>The Pope found no instrument so capable and ready to execute his bull, and serve his interest, as Reginald Pole (the youngest of four sons which Sir Richard Pole had by his wife Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, daughter of George Duke of Clarence, brother to Ed∣ward IV. and) second cousin to Henry. The King had taken a particular care of his education, bred him up in Magdelen and Corpus Christi colleges at Oxford, given him the deanery of Exeter, maintained him a∣broad with a noble allowance for seven years, whilst he prosecuted his studies at Paris and Padua; where he formed a very useful acquaintance, and made a great progress in learning. Henry at last calling him home, to assist in his affairs, he declined the invitation; and, when his excuses could not prevail for further delays, he wrote the King word, that he did not approve his actions, either in the point of his divorce, or in his abolishing the papal supremacy. When the reasons of his disapprobation were asked, he wrote a book, in∣titled, <HI>De Unione Ecclesiastica,</HI> wherein he depressed
<PB N="476" REF="525"/>the royal, and exalted the papal authority; condemned the King's conduct, and pressed him to return to the obedience of the see of Rome, with many sharp re∣flections, and indecent expressions, which might have been omitted, without hurting his cause, or exposing him to the charge of ingratitude for Henry's favours. His book was answered by Tonstal, Stokesley, and Gardiner; but it recommended him so much to the Pope's good graces, that he was, on May 22, 1536, created a Cardinal. Thus listed into the service of the court of Rome, he was sent with the character of le∣gate into the Low Countries, that he might be near England, for the easier keeping up a correspondence with the Papal faction: and the late rebellion was sup∣posed to have been the effect of his intrigues. He was to pass by Paris in his way thither, and perhaps and some commission to that court: but Henry, aware of the design, and insisting with Francis, either to deny him passage thro' his realm, or to deliver him up as a rebel, or at least not to treat with him as a legate, he was obliged to quit the French territories. The King had used the like instances with Mary Queen of Hun∣gary, Regent of the Low Countries; but she replying, that it was not fit for her to refuse the Pope's Legate, Pole was at first treated agreeably to that character when he arrived at Cambray. Having probably some view upon the crown of England for himself, or his eldest brother Henry Lord Montacute, or perhaps some se∣cret inclinations for the Princess Mary, he was, during his stay there very inquisitive to learn, whether the physicians thought the Queen then pregnant would have a made child or a female? Henry did not want intelligence of his actions; and renewing his instances with the Regent, charged her reception of such a traitor as a breach of the treaty; the consequences of which, as the Emp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r was at war with France, she had reason to apprehend. Pole was thereupon ordered to be gone, and told, that, since he was an English∣man
<PB N="477" REF="526"/>of so high a quality, his negotiation could not be a secret, and might do her great prejudice. To remove the King's suspicions, he wrote Cromwell, on May 2, 1537, an apology for his conduct, couch∣ed in general and equivocal terms; and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt the Re∣gent a remonstrance, accusing her of disobedience to the see of Rome, protesting against his treatment, such as had never been used to any legate, and pre∣tending that his chief business there, was only to dis∣pute the errors of the English reformation. Neither of his applications succeeded; the Regent did not like that the dominions, under her care, should be troubled with disputations about religion; and Pole, being forced to depart, removed to Liege; where he carried on, for some time, a clandestine correspondence with the discontented party in England. Returning, in October, to Rome, he was consulted in all measures relating to Henry; and still kept up that correspon∣dence, which proved fatal to several of his friends, and nearest relations.</P>
<P>The King of England, being made acquainted with the Pope's publication of the before-mentioned bull, exacted of the Bishops and Abbots a new oath, by which they renounced the Roman Pontiff's authority. About the same time, he ordered the clergy to read the Lord's prayer, the confession of saith, and the ten commandments, in English. They were directed to recommend good works, and teach the people, that relics, rosaries, and such like, were unnecessary to sal∣vation. All the images to which devotees made of∣ferings, were pulled down, and all tapers taken away, except those that burned before the representation of Christ: and the King suppressed all the invocations of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pro nobis</HI> added to the prayers addressed to saints.</P>
<P>Henry, by these injunctions, gave a mortal blow to the old religion, and was so absolute, both as tem∣poral sovereign, and as supreme head of the church, that no person would venture to express publickly the least
<PB N="478" REF="527"/>disapprobation of his actions, either in a regal or pon∣tifical capacity. Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, who detested the reformation in his heart, so far in∣sinuated himself into the King's confidence, by an out∣ward approbation of his measures, that his Majesty listened to the suggestions against the Sacramentarians, or those who denied the real presence of the Eucharist; and in this the Bishop was the more successful, as Henry himself was strongly attached to the doctrine of transubstantiation. Gardiner, who knew the King's impatience of contradiction in any, but especially re∣ligious, matters, imagined that the zeal of those who favoured the reformation, when persecuted, would ir∣ritate the temper of the impetuous Henry, and that his Majesty would crush them during the prevalence of his indignation. Gardiner, moreover, represented to the King, that nothing could so effectually secure to him the friendship of those engaged in the league of Smalcalde, or disappoint the machinations of the court of Rome, as a vigorous persecution against his subjects, who dared to differ from him in the established opinion of the real presence. Interest and vanity conspired to make Henry listen to the insinuations of the artful pre∣late, and a vigorous persecution was raised against the Sacramentarians.</P>
