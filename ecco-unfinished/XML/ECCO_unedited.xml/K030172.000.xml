<P>ON Thursday last, after I had begun to prepare these Papers for the Press, my friend Mr. Rice, between whom and Mr. Rutherford a very serious difference had that day been brought to a happy con∣clusion, intreated me, in the most earnest terms, at least to suspend my Publication; as he had yet hopes, by his present influence with Mr. Rutherford, to accommodate our differences. I consented, and went the next morning to Richmond, where I received the following letter from Mr. Rice, the contents of which induced me to resume my thoughts of publication; and indeed, rendered it incumbent on me to expedite it as much as possible; which I hope will be fome apology for the appa∣rent haste and inaccuracy of the following Narrative. The attention due to it must, however, depend upon facts. Mr. Rice's letter is as follows; and is published at his own request.</P>

<P>"YOU may remember that I acquainted you before you went out of town, that the moment the affair of last Thursday was over, I thought it a very proper opportunity to avail myself of the situation I then stood in, and told Mr. Rutherford the only advantage I would wish to make of the many advantages I had then given him, would be to ren∣der myself the instrument of bringing about a thorough reconciliation in the Theatre: Mr. Rutherford replied, that nothing in the world would give him greater pleasure; and that he should be the happiest man living if those disputes were once settled. From the many compli∣ments Mr. Rutherford paid me on this occasion, and the very conciliat∣ing disposition he was then in, I really was weak enough to believe him sincere. I saw him the same evening at the Playhouse, and we agreed to meet the next day at Mr. Harris's in Surry-street. If you recollect, I begged you not to proceed in your Publication. I went to Mr. Harris's at the time appointed, and to my great surprize found only Mr. Harris, who made an apology for Mr. Rutherford's not being there, but said that Mr. Rutherford would meet me any where in the evening, if I would leave word where I was to be found. I mentioned the Bedford Coffee-house. Mr. Harris's conversation and mine was rather general, as. I told him that my business was with Mr. Rutherford; that I thought I had a claim upon that gentleman, and meant to use it to make all the Patentees friends; and that I should make a point of Mr. Rutherford's using his influence with <HI>him</HI> to bring about a reconciliation of all parties. Though Mr. Harris did not seem so well disposed to a compromise as Mr. Ruther∣ford, yet he did not give me the least reason to expect the <HI>manoeuvre</HI> of this

<P><HI>"Mr.</HI> Rutherford<HI>'s most friendly compliments wait on Capt.</HI> Rice.<HI>—Was extremely sorry that he could not wait on him in</HI> Surry-Street <HI>to-day;—but will be very happy to see him in</HI> Newman-Street, <HI>to-morrow at ten, to breakfast.</HI></P>

In the mean time, the Publick Advertiser was brought me as usual, when, to my very great astonishment, I saw their Narrative advertised. Mr. Rutherford came at the time appointed in his note. It was with great difficulty I could keep my temper with him; and I told him, in the presence of Mr. Allen and a Hairdresser, that I did intend to say a great deal to him, but that the very disingenuous manner he had dealt with me, had put it out of my power to have any thing to say to him or his friend Mr. Harris; adding, "Had you told me, or even sent me word yesterday, that my interfering was quite unnecessary, as your Case was to be published this morning, I am sure I could not have been in the least offended; but, instead of that, you consented to confer about an accommodation, and concealed your intention of pub∣lishing your Narrative: Such disingenuous treatment from you I thought I did not deserve. I now renounce you both for ever, and think you a couple of people capable of doing every thing that is bad." He said, he was very sorry for my ill opinion of him; but declared, notwith∣standing what had passed, that any thing I had to say in this dispute, should have more weight with him than the remonstrances or argu∣ments of any other person. I intend to come to Richmond, and dine with you to-morrow."</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon my Narrative, it may not be improper to acquaint the Publick with the reasons that have induced me to give them this trouble; <Q>and to shew them that silence must have been interpreted as a tacit acknowledgment of guilt in myself and Mr. Powell, who could not forbear to reply to the most gross and open ca∣lumnies, if we entertained a proper regard for our reputations, and wished to be considered as men who held their good name “as the im∣mediate jewel of their souls.”</Q></P>
<P>Contempt of slander is indeed an heroick quality, and conscious inno∣cence is the surest antidote to its poison. But there are circumstances wherein the world has a kind of right to arraign our conduct; not to mention, that it requires a very uncommon share of philosophy not to refute scandal and malice, when we have the means of justification in our power.</P>
<P>On Saturday, the 23d of January, we were informed that there lay for publick inspection, at Slaughter's Coffee-house, in St. Martin's-lane, a manuscript paper, wherein we were charged, in direct terms, with the most infamous collusion in the management of the Theatre; a collusion intended to promote our own separate and private emolument, and conse∣quently to defraud Mess. Rutherford and Harris, the joint sharers in the property.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding those two gentlemen had for some preceding weeks betrayed the most hostile disposition toward us, and endeavoured to render the management of the Theatre as hazardous as it is troublesome; yet that they, or their friends, should think it advisable to appeal to the Publick, by drawing up a partial state of our differences, seemed almost incredible. In the evening, however, we repaired to the Coffee-room, and on a perusal of the libellous paper in question, we found it to be more replete with falshood, scandal, and malice, than it had even been represented to us; nor indeed was it possible for any person, not minutely acquainted with the facts, to discern how much they were distorted in order to give the least colour to the charges brought against us.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was indorsed, "A narrative of transactions relative to Covent Garden Theatre." And at some distance was written, <HI>in another hand,</HI> "For the use of the gentlemen of Slaughter's Coffee-house;" which words were also written on the margin of the several leaves of the manuscript.</NOTE> The paper was conceived in the following terms:</P>
<P><HI>A short state of the case between</HI> THOMAS HARRIS, JOHN RUTHERFORD, GEORGE COLMAN, <HI>and</HI> WILLIAM POWELL.</P>
<P>"THE patents, &amp;c. of Covent Garden Theatre, being to be sold, pursuant to the direction of the late Mr. Rich's will; Thomas Harris and John Ruther∣ford formed a design of purchasing them, and entered into a treaty with the exe∣cutors of said Rich; but afterwards thought proper to invite some one person con∣versant in these matters to share with them in the purchase; one who might strengthen the company as a performer, and assist them in the management there∣of.—They pitched upon William Powell the player, to whom the plan was com∣municated.—At first his only objection was, an article subsisting between him and the patentees of Drury Lane Theatre; but he afterwards, in his own mind, got over that difficulty, and proposed a friend of his, George Colman, a dramatic au∣thor; and urged the expediency of admitting him into the treaty, by greatly exag∣gerating the service he would do in assisting the Theatrical Management.—At length Harris and Rutherford agreed, not only to the admission of William Powell, but also his friend George Colman. Whereon, March 31st, 1767, these four gentlemen entered into articles of agreement between themselves, for concluding such purchase; and Harris and Rutherford were impowered to conclude the treaty they had begun on their own account, and the four parties were to be equal sharers.</P>
<P>"April 1st, Harris and Rutherford contracted for the purchase, and 10,000 l. the property of Harris and Rutherford, was deposited on that day, the remainder of the 60,000 l. to be paid the 1st July next ensuing. And soon after, all four parties met on the subject of their future articles, when Colman proposed to have the uncontrouled management, which Powell approved; but Harris and Rutherford, (being exceedingly surprised) warmly, and reiteratedly, protested they never would consent to any other articles, but such as would give them a perfect equality of power with Colman. Whereupon, after much deliberation, the four gentlemen, on 14th May last, signed an agreement, by which Colman was appointed acting manager, with this restriction, that he was from time to time, <HI>and at all times,</HI> to communicate and submit his conduct, and the <HI>measures</HI> he should intend to pursue, unto Harris and Rutherford, who were impowered to put a negative on any such measure which they should jointly disapprove.</P>
<P>"Powell was to give his advice and assistance when required.</P>
<P>"May 28th, Powell was engaged as an actor for seven years, at 400 l. a year, and a clear benefit; and if any performer, or player, should be allowed more, then an additional charge was to be allowed Powell, so as to exceed such <HI>future</HI> player. 2d, None of the parties should have any concern in any other theatre.</P>
<P>July 1st, The contract with Rich's executors was compleated, and the money then paid; but Colman and Powell were deficient in their proportion of purchase-money
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
9,000l. whereupon the sum was borrowed, and Harris and Rutherford were securities for Colman and Powell.</P>
<P>"No sooner were they in possession of the theatre, &amp;c. but Colman began to act in a most arbitrary and insolent manner; he scarce even deign'd to consult Har∣ris and Rutherford in any one measure; he received and rejected dramatic pieces; engaging and refusing performers, &amp;c. &amp;c. without ever mentioning them; and at the first rehearsal, instead of introducing them to the performers, (which were fixed by him) he forbad them the stage, thereby endeavouring to prevent Harris and Rutherford from superintending his conduct.</P>
<P>"After much expostulation, Colman assented to a weekly meeting, when he, Colman, was to propose such plays, &amp;c. and all such other measures, as he thought might be proper for the week following. This meeting was observed by all parties for a few weeks; yet Harris and Rutherford could not help seeing, that Colman did not, at the meetings, propose all the measures he intended to pursue; and that when he knew the sentiments of Harris and Rutherford, he generally acted in contradiction to them.</P>
<P>"Fearing to throw the whole affair into confusion, Harris and Rutherford bore this kind of treatment, and repeated insults, from Colman, without resenting them, as he still kept, in some degree, the rank of decency, and did not openly disclaim their negative power; but on Thursday, the day of October, he, in the highest terms, and most aggravating language, openly disclaimed their right of restraining him, and solemnly declared, that to them he would never disclose his future intentions; and that he would be responsible to the public, not to them, for the consequences. Though <HI>they knew of no cause,</HI> yet this appeared to them the language of passion or madness; therefore, he was again, the succeeding day, asked, if he would comply with his articles, and propose his measures, &amp;c. Ac∣cordingly he again refused; and being expostulated with again and again, he on Saturday night declared, he would have no further communication with either of them; yet, notwithstanding all this, on Sunday November the 1st, he wrote them a letter, (vide copy marked A) wherein he recognizes the articles, recapitulates the substance of them, and promises to adhere to them for the future: but (strange as it must appear!) he so soon forgot his promise, that without having either <HI>heard from,</HI> or seen said Harris and Rutherford, he, on the very same night, and with∣out their knowledge, or giving them the least notice thereof, summoned all the principal performers to a tavern, and there harangued them, and acquainted them, that he was invested with the absolute management of the theatre, and entirely suppressed Harris and Rutherford's right of controuling him. This conduct oblig∣ed Harris and Rutherford to read publicly on the stage, on Monday morning, the whole articles, when Colman, in appearance, took shame to himself, and declar∣ed, in the presence of Woodward, Smith, and Gibson, &amp;c. that he would sub∣mit his measures to their controlment.</P>
<P>"During these transactions, it was impossible for Harris and Rutherford to be blind to the ridiculous partialities of Colman; yet they were of opinion, the causes of them were of such a nature, that as men, they could not take notice of them; but the instance was so glaring, in casting the play of Cymbeline, that, <HI>in duty to the public,</HI> Harris and Rutherford were obliged to take notice of it. What can be more distressing to men who have the least sense of honour or gene∣rosity, than being obliged to disclose the foibles and infirmities of others! yet a concise and true declaration of this sort, Harris and Rutherford find to be the only
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
way that can clear themselves and others, from the imputation Colman has no less artfully than wickedly put upon them. The uncommon effrontery Colman has exhibited in making a supposed partiality to a certain actress, his great plea of complaint, and even carrying his assurance to such a height, as to summons the friends of Harris and Rutherford, with others who were strangers to them, and then wickedly depending on alarming and frightening them with false accounts of their conduct respecting the above lady, the <HI>narrators</HI> hope will be deemed a suffi∣cient occasion for their setting that affair in a clear light.—Colman had conceived a violent pique and resentment against the above-mentioned actress, the cause of which shall not be here related; but whilst others are conjecturing, Colman must burn with shame, as that lady's conduct had ever been most unexceptionable in the theatre. Harris and Rutherford could not help frequently expostulating on the injuries he delighted to inflict on her; in particular, although the whole theatre deemed her, as the company then stood, <HI>(Mrs. Yates being not then engaged)</HI> the properest person to have the part of Imogen in the play of Cymbeline: yet he, (Colman) at once to gratify his resentment to her, his lust of acting contrary to the opinion of Harris and Rutherford, and his spirit of gallantry, insisted most heartily, that that character should be given to a certain <HI>young</HI> actress; but with much ado he was shamed from his purpose, and he pledged his honour, that the first mentioned lady should have the character.—It may not be improper to re∣mark here, that after Mrs. Yates was engaged, <HI>it was universally acknowledged,</HI> that no person in our company could stand in competition with her for that cha∣racter.—Yet, after the concessions that were made by Colman, November the 2d, and the reconciliation that ensued, it was agreed by all parties, that as Colman had absurdly made that play a matter of dispute, it should be laid aside, and not got ready for exhibition, until approved by Harris and Rutherford; but notwith∣standing that, he has since, viz. on the day of thought proper to perform it in opposition to their written disapprobation.</P>
<P>"On the day of Colman took upon him, without the knowledge or consent of Harris and Rutherford, to contract with Mr. and Mrs. Yates as players, viz. Mrs. Yates at 500 l. per annum, and Mr. Yates at 10 l. a week, with benefits.—Though the merit of these two performers would at first sight induce one to think, that this step, though irregular, was for the interest of the proprietors, yet, in fact, it has turned out <HI>very much the reverse;</HI> nay, it had been viewed in that light three or four days before by all the proprietors, who jointly declared their sentiments against such a step.—Colman engaging them in this clandestine manner may be accounted for from the following motives:—First, <HI>being very avaricious,</HI> and Powell and himself being in perfect collusion from first to last, he, by giving 500 l. to Mrs. Yates, made an addition to Powell's salary of 100 l. per annum: and again, by doing an act of so much consequence, without the knowledge of Harris and Rutherford, and even against their consent; he there∣by meant to prove to the whole theatre, that he could and would act without consulting or regarding them; and, in consequence, expose Harris and Rutherford to derision. That this was a powerful motive, was plain from his immediate subsequent boastings—"That he had made this engagement on his own authority."—The real loss sustained by this measure cannot be estimated at less than 1500 l. which may be thus made appear: The salaries of capital performers, that were before en∣gaged, and now rendered useless, the addition of Powell's salary, the incredible
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
expence of dresses for Mrs. Yates;—add to this, a loss which has been exceedingly heavy, though it cannot be ascertained, incurred by Colman's neglecting his duty in reviewing and getting up all other plays, except those in which the two above∣mentioned performers, and William Powell, had capital characters; endeavouring by such most unjustifiable means, to give colour and sanction to the step he had taken.</P>
<P>"The following is a proof of the glaring degree to which Colman and Powell car∣ried their collusion. At a meeting, on or about the 20th of November last, between all the four parties, Colman proposed taking out of the treasury a sum from 64 to 70l. on account of the insertion of a few lines in the Rehearsal, and his proposed alterations of King Lear; to all which Powell concurred immediately, and warm∣ly; but Harris and Rutherford remonstrated, that it would be more proper to take the money after the tragedy was produced. Yet, notwithstanding, Colman did take out of the treasury that sum, between 64 and 70l. since which Harris and Rutherford have neither seen nor heard of the play. At the very same meeting, Powell, notwithstanding his articles to the contrary, earnestly insisted on the equity of his having the benefit arising from some one night, on account of his not going to Bristol theatre in the ensuing summer; to which proposal Colman immediately and warmly concurred. At length, to avoid dispute, Harris and Rutherford con∣sented that Powell should go to Bristol theatre, but Colman refused; notwithstand∣ing he urged the propriety of giving him a benefit, and flew into a great heat and passion because Harris and Rutherford would not consent to it.</P>
<P>"What aggravates, to Harris and Rutherford, the very extraordinary expences for dresses, &amp;c. is, that Colman has taken upon him, with some finister view or other, to deposit a great part of the wardrobe, amounting to a very large sum, in the house of Mr. Powell, instead of the place appointed for that purpose in the theatre; and Powell, in the most insulting terms, refuses to bring them to the pro∣per place, though applied to by letter.</P>
<P>"Through Mr. Colman's ill conduct, in the management of the theatre, in measures pursed without the knowledge, or against the consent, of Harris and Rutherford, <HI>they verily believe</HI> a loss not less than 3,500 l. has been sustained; which sum will not appear extraordinary, to those who know the very large receipts and disbursements of a theatre, and which altogether depend on the management thereof.</P>
<P>"It is not so much the abovementioned <HI>losses</HI> that alarm Harris and Rutherford, as that they plainly perceive the ultimate views of Colman and Powell to be their total exclusion, which they purpose to bring about, by setting them, Harris and Rutherford, at so great a distance, and keeping them so ignorant of their own af∣fairs, that they may not be able to see through the future operations of Colman and Powell; and which will unquestionably be directed for the purpose of their private emolument.</P>
<P>"From the foregoing case, how very unjustifiable the behaviour of Colman and Powell is, in persisting (in despite of honour and honesty, and the known original intentions of Harris and Rutherford, and their present subsisting articles) to <HI>mis∣manage</HI> their property, every reader is left to determine."</P>
<P>On Monday, January 25, the Prompter of the Theatre, a very honest and inte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gent man, who thought himself a party aggrieved by that
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
part of the paper which related to a <HI>certain young actress,</HI> waited on Mess. Harris and Rutherford, who both disclaimed any knowledge of such a paper having been exposed till within two hours before that in∣stant; adding, however, <HI>that they could easily conjecture the quarter from which it proceeded, and seeming to ascribe the publication of it to the intempe∣rate zeal of some particular friend.</HI> Upon their expressing a desire to see the paper, the Prompter produced a copy of it; which Mr. Rutherford turned over with much apparent eagerness and curiosity, and joined with Mr. Harris in a request that it might be left in their hands. It was so, and the Prompter departed; but not without previously declaring, that, since the Paper did not appear to have their sanction, he hoped they would not be offended, if he took every occasion of testifying his contempt and detestation of that part of it, which was relative to a <HI>certain young actress.</HI></P>
<P>Within less than an hour after this interview were received, by the several persons to whom they were addressed, the two following Letters:</P>

<P>Surry-street, Tuesday morning, 26th January.</P>
<P>The same evening Mr. Harris told the Prompter, that it was hoped he would not be too violent or acrimonious in his language concerning the written paper left at Slaughter's; for although Mr. Rutherford and himself utterly disclaimed the circulation of it, yet as malevolent per∣sons would undoubtedly attribute it to them, such language from him would be considered as an indirect affront to themselves.</P>

At this interview another gentleman, whom Mr. Bury supposed to be Mr. Rutherford, was present. This application, however, proved as fruitless as the former. Mr. Harris said that they could send no written answer, nor any verbal message: and upon being asked what was the in∣tention of their advertisement, again replied, that they could send no written answer, nor any verbal message. Mr. Bury then observed, that Mr. Powell and Mr. Colman <HI>had publickly declared themselves to have been injured by the paper;</HI> and asked if those gentlemen, on a personal appli∣cation to them, (Mess. Harris and Rutherford) might receive the infor∣mation promised in the advertisement. Mr. Harris replied, that they could send no other answer than what he had just before given.</P>
<P>Upon enquiry after the manner in which the Paper came to be ex∣hibited at Slaughter's Coffee-house, the fact stands thus.</P>
<P>On Saturday, January 23, about noon, as Mr. Julliott, of Henrietta∣street, apothecary, was sitting in a box at Slaughter's Coffee-house, reading the news-papers, two young gentlemen entered the room, and desired to pass him. They passed him, and sat down in the same box. After some time they pulled out a book and a written paper, and called for pen and ink. The bar-maid asked, if they did not want any <HI>paper?</HI> They replied in the negative, and used the pen and ink in making inser∣tions or erasements, or both, in the manuscript which they had just be∣fore produced. In about a quarter of an hour they departed; and Mr. Julliott, after having sufficiently amused himself with the news-papers, happened to cast his eye on the manuscript, which lay on the table. At first he thought it might have been by <HI>accident left</HI> there; but seeing it indorsed, "A Narrative of Transactions relative to Covent-Garden-Theatre," took it for granted, from the title, that it was left there for general inspection, and accordingly made no scruple to examine the con∣tents of it; on perusal of which he told the servant in the bar, that it re∣lated to the disputes among the Covent-Garden Managers; and that he supposed that the two Gentlemen who had just left the room, were no other than Mess. Rutherford and Harris.</P>
<P>Mr. Julliott does not recollect that the Paper was also indorsed, "For the use of the Gentlemen of Slaughter's Coffee-house," at the time that he saw it. Mr. Preston, the master of the Coffee-house, is confident that neither he, nor any of his people to the best of his knowledge or be∣lief, added those words; and a gentleman (whose name will be mentioned if the fact is disputed) who perused the paper about two o'clock the same day, well remembers that it was then so indorsed.</P>
<P>It has been contended that this Paper was nothing more than the heads of a Law-Case, left by accident on a Coffee-house table. The sub∣stance of it may have been, and I believe has been, laid before Counsel;
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
but the very form of it, as it now stands, pronounces it to have been drawn up with another view. Be that as it may, it lay for three days toge∣ther in the Coffee-room, as common and publick as the Daily Advertiser; so that the characters of the parties vilified were equally injured, whether it was left there by accident or design. We have stiled this paper "a false, scandalous, and malicious libel." We repeat those expressions, confident that every dispassionate reader of the following narrative will assent to the justice and propriety of the terms in which we have spoken of the Paper. The charges of collusion and fraud affect us too deeply to be mentioned without some emotion. As to the virulence and malignity of the stile, and the words "effrontery," "assurance," "void of honour and honesty," &amp;c. &amp;c. we take them from whence they come, and consider them as mere paper and packthread to make up the parcel of scandal. The expressions of contempt thrown on us on account of supposed talents, which we should be proud to possess, give us no pain; and we look on the terms <HI>William Powell the Player,</HI> and <HI>George Colman a Dramatick Au∣thor,</HI> as mere words of course, like John Rutherford, and Thomas Harris, <HI>Esquires.</HI></P>
<P>Conscious of the integrity of my actions, and that the more my con∣duct was known to the world, the more fully it would be justified, I have in some peevish moments, when provoked to the uttermost, threat∣ened to appeal to the Publick; but on cooler reflection was always averse to such a proceeding; and it is not without the greatest regret that I am now driven to publish letters, and lay open conversation. The reader indeed will immediately perceive that they are not such as pass between friend and friend; or, if they were, that I have not been the aggressor in this instance. My letters have been submitted by my profest adversaries to Counsel, and the most casual expressions dropt carelessly in the flow of <HI>table-talk</HI> have been urged against me as solemn resolutions. These very letters and conversations are also the basis of the black charges brought against me; so that I do but meet the Libeller on his own ground; on which, if he uses the arms of Falshood for the attack, I have certainly a right to have recourse to Truth for my shield.</P>

<HEAD>A TRUE STATE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the latter end of last March, Mr. Powell desired to speak with me on particular business, and acquainted me that a couple of gentlemen had applied to him to become a joint purchaser with them of the patents, &amp;c. of Covent-Garden Theatre; that he could never think of embarking in such an undertaking with two inexperienced young men, who perhaps might know but little of the world, and cer∣tainly could know nothing of the internal management of a Theatre; that he had not sufficient confidence in his own abilities to suppose himself equal to the task; but that, if he had my assistance, he did not doubt of success; concluding with a request of my permission to mention me to the two gentlemen, and at the same time declaring, that, unless I were included in the treaty, he should decline the proposal, fearing it might terminate in his ruin.</P>
<P>Mr. Powell, with my consent, mentioned my name to the gentlemen. They objected to taking in a fourth; but Mr. Powell declared his opi∣nion, that they would reap more profit from a fourth share with Mr. Colman's assistance, than from a third without him.</P>
<P>A few days after, on another interview between Mr. Powell and the gentlemen, they told him that they had considered of his last proposal; in consequence whereof they had made proper enquiries concerning Mr. Colman, and found his accession to the partnership so desirable a circum∣stance, that they returned Mr. Powell many thanks for making so happy an improvement of their plan, and desired to have a meeting on the oc∣casion with Mr. Colman as soon as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16"/>
Accordingly, on the thirtieth of March, all the four par∣ties met at Mr. Powell's. Mr. Colman being asked by Mess. <NOTE PLACE="marg">March 30. 1767.</NOTE> Rutherford and Harris, whether he had considered of the af∣fair which Mr. Powell had at their desire communicated to him, replied, that he thought himself much obliged to Mr. Powell for his good opi∣nion, but could not think of availing himself of such a partiality, unless they concurred in Mr. Powell's sentiments; and that if they were not of opinion that Mr. Colman's advice and assistance were essential to the wel∣fare of the undertaking, he would by no means think of becoming a party concerned merely from the nomination of Mr. Powell. Their reply to this declaration was conceived in the most handsome terms; and, to con∣vince Mr. Colman that the many civil things they said on this occasion were not words of course, they afterwards recurred to this subject, and repeatedly assured him of the great value they set upon his accession to their scheme, independent of every other consideration than their tho∣rough persuasion of the advantage that would result from it in the success of the Theatre. Being late, it was agreed, after a short conversation on the intended purchase, that <HI>the four</HI> should have a second meeting the very next night, in order to come to a final determination, and to enter into articles of agreement among themselves concerning the purchase. Just before their parting, Mr. Colman, addressing Mess. Harris and Rutherford, observed, that managing a Theatre was like stirring a fire, which every man thought he could do better than any body else. <Q>“Now, gentlemen, said he, I think I stir a fire better than any man in England.”</Q> <Q>To this they replied, “Do you manage; let Mr. Powell act; all we want is to have good interest for our money.”</Q></P>
<P>The next evening we met again; and, at the desire of Mess. Rutherford and Harris, Mr. Hutchinson, a gentleman whom <NOTE PLACE="marg">March 31.</NOTE> they particularly recommended for his abilities and integrity in his pro∣fession, attended with an instrument prepared for us to sign. By this agreement, Mess. Rutherford and Harris were empowered to treat for the purchase of the Theatre, &amp;c. at any sum not exceeding 60,000l. forty thousand to be raised by themselves, and twenty by Colman and Powell, whom they were to assist with a loan of 5000 l. each, to make up their proportions of the purchase-money. On Mr. Hutchin∣son's reading over this instrument, when he came to that part of it wherein it was recited, that the four parties <HI>should be jointly and equally concerned in the management of the Theatre,</HI> Mr. Colman begged leave to interrupt him, and told him it was a settled point that he (Mr. Colman) was to be invested with the direction of the Theatre; whereupon, to his very great surprise, Mess. Harris and Rutherford declared, that they never had the least intention of forming such an article; that, as they had
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
the turn of the scale in the purchase-money, they could not think of low∣ering their consequence in the purchase, &amp;c. Mr. Colman said, that he took it for granted (as he most certainly did) that this matter had been previously understood on all sides; and that he had plainly declared to Mr. Powell, on his first application, that he would never be concerned in the purchase, unless he should be invested with the theatrical direction. Mr. Powell allowed the truth of this assertion, but <HI>said nothing in appro∣bation of Mr. Colman's claim of the management;</HI> and Mess. Rutherford and Harris, seeming sensible of his superior utility in this province, but unwilling to acknowledge that superiority under their hands, the agree∣ment was at last signed by each of the four parties, in the form in which it had been originally prepared.</P>
<P>This transaction passed on the thirty-first of March, though the manu∣script paper exhibited at Slaughter's, as well as the printed Narrative, for the same purposes of fallacy that will appear through the whole, place it much later.</P>
<P>The next morning I set out for Bath, where I remained till the third or fourth of May. In the mean time, Mess. Harris <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 1.</NOTE> and Rutherford contracted for the purchase, deposited 10,000l. and agreed for the payment of the remainder on the ensuing first of July.</P>
<P>I have been extremely particular in the above relation, because I am resolved not to suppress or disguise the most minute fact, that may seem in the least favourable to Mess. Rutherford and Harris. For a like rea∣son I shall suppress all my reflections and resolutions declared to particu∣lar friends, till I had the pleasure of seeing those gentlemen again, which was not till some days after my return to town; the same me∣lancholy occasion that summoned me from Bath sooner than I <NOTE PLACE="marg">May, 1767.</NOTE> proposed, having also secluded me from company. In the mean time, Mess. Rutherford and Harris expressed the greatest impatience for an interview with me, <HI>apart from Mr. Powell.</HI> On the very first con∣ference, they testified, in the warmest terms, their earnest desire that I should be invested with the theatrical direction, complaining at the same time of the indiscretion of Mr. Powell, to whom they ascribed the noto∣riety of our intended purchase, which was now become the common talk of the town, and our names inserted in every news-paper.</P>
<P>It is but justice to Mr. Powell to declare, that it afterwards appeared that, from the peculiar circumstances of Mr. Rich's will, his widow thought herself bound in honour to declare to some other candidates for the purchase, that she had given notice to the trustees of her having con∣tracted for the sale. This circumstance, as well as the necessary appli∣cations by each of the parties to their friends for the requisite sum, tended to make the treaty publick. One part of Mr. Powell's conduct on this
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
occasion, though it certainly contributed to betray our operations, is very much to his honour, though the written Narrative, with the same spirit of candour that animates the whole, endeavours to interpret it to his disadvantage, and to tax him with a scandalous breach of faith to the Patentees of Drury-Lane Theatre. The truth is, that the very day after Mess. Rutherford and Harris had applied to Mr. Powell, he com∣municated the matter to Mr. Lacey, who very kindly assured him of his best wishes, and a continuance of the same friendship which he had shewn to Mr. Powell on every former occasion. Mr. Garrick was then at Bath.</P>
<P>In a word, Mess. Harris and Rutherford now insisted on the expediency of investing Mr. Colman with the direction of <NOTE PLACE="marg">May, 1767.</NOTE> the Theatre, and were extremely sollicitous to settle this point before Mr. Powell's summer-engagements should call him out of town. To this end it was proposed, that we should each of us consider of that and some other necessary articles, and throw our thoughts concerning them upon paper. I did so; and Mr. Harris, in a few days, took occa∣sion to call upon me one morning <HI>alone.</HI> I then submitted to him a pa∣per containing a sketch of some articles, and, among the rest, one re∣lative to the management, which was as follows:</P>
<P><Q>“That George Colman shall be invested with the theatrical direc∣tion, that is to say, the power of engaging and dismissing actors, ac∣tresses, singers, dancers, musicians, &amp;c. &amp;c. of receiving or re∣jecting such new pieces as shall be offered to the Theatre; of casting the plays; of appointing what plays, farces, &amp;c. shall be performed; together with the sole conduct of all such things as are generally un∣derstood to be comprehended under the dramatick and theatrical pro∣vince: <HI>Provided always that the said George Colman shall not do any act contrary to the opinion of</HI> ANY TWO <HI>of the other partners in writing ex∣pressed: and that if the four partne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s shall be equally divided in opinion, that the matter in dispute shall be referred to two arbitrators, one for each party; and if the said two arbitrators cannot agree, that they shall join in appointing one other arbitrator, whose opinion shall be decisive and final.”</HI></Q></P>
<P>On perusing the above rough draught of an article, Mr. Harris did me the honour to observe, that the footing on which I was willing to rest my management was extremely generous, and agreeable to the candour which I had shewn in my whole transaction with them; but that he thought it necessary that I should have <HI>more power</HI> than such an article would give me; that he had the greatest esteem and regard for his friend Mr. Rutherford, whom he thought a very honest, good-natured man, but that there were no two persons in the world more likely to differ in
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
opinion than himself and Mr. Rutherford; so that if Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Powell should happen to join in opposition to any of my measures, an obstruction in the management must necessarily ensue; that his bro∣ther-in-law, Mr. Longman, had told him, that he and Mr. Rutherford <HI>might</HI> differ, but that he and Mr. Colman <HI>never could;</HI> he could wish, therefore, that I would agree to put Mr. Powell entirely out of the ques∣tion, and to place the whole <HI>negative power</HI> in himself and Mr. Ruther∣ford, and then (added he) <HI>"You will always be sure of</HI> ONE <HI>of us."</HI></P>
<P>Although this scene past entirely between Mr Harris and me, yet the truth of it does not rest on my bare assertion; for I recapitulated all these circumstances to Mr. Harris some weeks ago at the Theatre, in the pre∣sence of Messrs. Rutherford, Powell, and Hutchinson. He allowed the facts, but added, that he had been mistaken in me. I returned him the compliment.</P>
<P>I fell into the snare, and said, that if Mr. Powell could be prevailed on to assent to such an article, I had no objection to it. Mr. Rutherford, in this instance, as in every other, implicitly submitted to the opinion of Mr. Harris. Mr. Powell, however, shewed <HI>great repugnance</HI> to giving me the direction. On my expostulating with him alone on this subject, and reminding him of his first application to me, and my declared reso∣lutions at that period, he frankly confessed that <HI>he had been advised to the contrary;</HI> but that, on reflection, he returned to his original intentions, and was content to put his fame and fortune into my hands.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>real</HI> history of the article respecting the manage∣ment, which was accordingly signed by all parties on the 14th <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 14.</NOTE> of May, and is as follows:</P>
<P>"WHEREAS Thomas Harris, John Rutherford, George Colman, and William Powell, by certain articles of agreement, dated the 31st Day of March last, did agree to purchase of the Representatives of John Rich, esq. deceased, two patents for exhibiting theatrical performances, and the several leases of Covent-garden the∣atre, and the rooms, buildings, conveniences, furniture, cloaths, scenes, decora∣tions, music, entertainments, and all things belonging to the said Theatre; and the said Thomas Harris and John Rutherford were thereby authorised to treat for, and purchase the same, at a sum not exceeding 60,000 l. and the purchase-money was to be advanced by the said parties equally, and they were to become jointly pos∣sessed of, and interested in, the premisses so to be purchased, and were to be jointly and equally concerned in the management of the said Theatre, and were to execute proper deeds and instruments for that purpose, when the said purchase should be completed. And whereas the said Thomas Harris and John Rutherford have ac∣cordingly contracted and agreed with the representatives of the said John Rich, for the purchasing of the said patents, leases, premisses, and things, at and for the sum of 60,000 l. and such purchase is to be completed on the first of July next: Now the said several parties, having perused and fully understanding the purport and contents of the said contract, do approve of, and confirm the same. And hav∣ing
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
also, in consequence thereof, taken into their consideration the Management of the said Theatre, they have, for the better and more easy conducting of the business thereof, as well as for their joint and equal benefit and advantage, agreed, and do hereby mutually declare and agree, that, notwithstanding any thing contained in the said agreement already made between the said parties, the said George Colman shall be invested with the Direction of the said Theatre in the particulars following, viz. that he shall have the power of engaging and dismissing performers of all kinds; of receiving or rejecting such new pieces as shall be offered to the said theatre, or the proprietors thereof; of casting the plays; of appointing what plays, farces, en∣tertainments, and other exhibitions, shall be performed; and of conducting all such things as are generally understood to be comprehended in the dramatic and theatri∣cal province. And that the said Thomas Harris and John Rutherford shall be de∣sired to attend to the comptrolment of the Accounts and Treasury, relative to the said theatre. <HI>Provided always, and in as much as the said Thomas Harris and John Ru∣therford will have leisure to attend to the affairs of the said theatre, and the said William Powell is to be engaged as an Actor or Performer upon the Stage (for which purpose separate articles are intended to be entered into between him and the other Parties), in which his time and attention will be chiefly employed and taken up, so that he will not be able to apply himself in managing the business of the theatre; it is therefore hereby further agreed, that the said George Colman shall, from time to time, and at all times hereafter, communicate and submit his conduct, and the measures he shall intend to pursue, unto them the said Tho∣mas Harris and John Rutherford; and in case they shall, at any time, signify their disap∣probation thereof, in writing, unto the said George Colman, then and in that case the mea∣sures, so disapproved of, shall not be carried into execution, any thing before contained to the contrary thereof notwithstanding. Yet, nevertheless, with respect to the said William Powell, it is intended and agreed, that he shall, at all times, give his advice and assistance relative to any part of the business of the said theatre, when thereunto desired by the other parties.</HI> Witness the hands of the said parties, this 14th day of May, 1767.</P>

<P>It was at the time of the above conference that Mr. Harris first men∣tioned Mrs. Lessingham, expressing his desire that she might be engaged at our Theatre; but at the same time requesting that <HI>I would not be alarmed</HI> on this occasion, as he did not wish to have her considered with more partiality than any other Performer, either in regard to the allot∣ment of Parts, or proportion of Salary. I very readily acquiesced in re∣ceiving her, provided she could, with any propriety, disentangle herself from her engagements at Drury Lane; and even declared a propensity to shew her any reasonable partiality, which I did not doubt was all that would be required.</P>
<P>On the 28th of May was signed another Article, chiefly relative to Mr. Powell's engagement as a Performer, of which <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 28.</NOTE> more shall be said in the sequel. By the same Article it was also agreed, that none of the parties should be concerned in any other Theatre; and
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
that any of them producing any new Play, Farce, Entertainment, or other exhibition, or any alteration of an old Play, Farce, &amp;c. should have the common emoluments accruing to Authors from such productions, exclusive of the other parties.</P>
<P>On the first of July the contract with Mr. Rich's executors was compleated, and the money then paid; but in order to ef∣fect <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1.</NOTE> the purchase, the sum of Fifteen Thousand Pounds had been bor∣rowed, viz. <HI>Six</HI> Thousand for Mr. Rutherford, <HI>Five</HI> for Mr. Colman, and <HI>Four</HI> for Mr. Powell; for securing which sum of Fifteen Thousand Pounds the three fourth shares of Messrs. Rutherford, Harris, and Colman, were mortgaged, Mr. Powell having made over the first claim on the whole of his share to the person of whom he had borrowed the other Eleven Thousand of his proportion of the purchase. By this account it will appear, that Messrs. Harris and Rutherford were not called upon to make good their original contract; that Mr. Powell raised One Thousand Pounds more than his contract required; that Mr. Colman was not obliged to them, directly or indirectly, for a single shilling; that he was a joint security with them for the Four Thousand advanced to Mr. Powell, and that Mr. Colman raised, independent of the patent security, One Thousand Pounds more than Mr. Rutherford, who brought but <HI>Nine</HI> Thousand into the common stock to Mr. Colman's <HI>Ten.</HI> It will scarcely be con∣tended that Mr. Colman could not raise 5000l. on his share; at least it cannot be urged with a good grace by Messrs. Harris and Rutherford, who often assured him how much more easily the money was raised by the use of his name: not that these particulars would be worth mention∣ing, if it were not to shew that there is not the most minute circumstance in this whole transaction, wherein the writer of the libellous Narrative has not attempted to deceive.</P>
<P>The purchase being completed, Mr. Powell, who came up to town on purpose to sign the writings, returned to Bristol; <NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and Messrs. Rutherford and Harris set out on a tour of pleasure to Buxton, Matlock, Harrowgate, &amp;c. leaving all the care of preparing the House and Company for the ensuing season to Mr. Colman. Before their depar∣ture Mr. Colman shewed Mr. Harris a paper containing a sketch of the alterations then proposed in the Company, and lamented the want of his and Mr. Rutherford's and Mr. Powell's assistance and advice in the course of his future operations during the summer; on which occasion Mr. Har∣ris, with much politeness and apparent sincerity, replied, that it was of no consequence, since they should have nothing to do but to approve what he proposed.</P>
<P>The many cares attending my new situation are not easily imagined; but I was embarked on a sea of troubles, and was <NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE>
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
resolved to make way, if possible, with chearfulness and resolution. Af∣ter a most laborious and unwearied attention to the business of the The∣atre for six or seven weeks, having settled every thing in the best manner I was able, I went down to Bristol, and communicated all my proceedings to Mr. Powell, who expressed great satisfaction at the measures I had taken. In about three weeks I returned to London, expecting to meet the two other gentlemen returned from the North, and to find them in the same good humour which they maintained before they set out.</P>
<P>In this, however, I was cruelly deceived. They received me in the coldest manner, and instead of seeming sensible of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> trouble I had taken, broke out into complaints of their not having been made duly acquainted with all my proceedings. The only material steps I had taken, were the receiving a Comedy of Dr. Goldsmith, and making an engagement with Mr. Macklin; neither of which, especially the latter, I should have done merely on my own judgment, had it not been almost next to impossible to have obtained their opinion; as their motions were quite uncertain, and I never received a letter from either of them, till a few days before I went to Bristol. Of these measures, however, they declared their entire approbation; but before we parted, Mr. Ruther∣ford took a fresh occasion to differ with me, and rendered a very trivial concern a matter of great importance, <HI>by peremptorily insisting</HI> that the ar∣rangements which I had made in that instance should not be pursued. What rendered this unexpected opposition the more shocking to me, was, that it was introduced by observations rather unfavourable to the rest of my conduct, for which I was weak enough to expect a very different re∣turn. Mr. Rutherford continued to <HI>insist</HI> on my waving the point, which at that time was not only unadvisable, but impracticable. I professed, therefore, that I should most steadily adhere to it; and on those terms we parted.</P>
<P>It is but justice to Mr. Harris to declare, that he acted with the utmost candour on this occasion. He undertook to be a mediator, and used every method to conciliate the mind of each party. At length Mr. Rutherford was prevailed on to wave his opposition, by the interposition of his friend, and the following letter from me.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><HI>To</HI> J. RUTHERFORD, <HI>Esq.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 8, 1767.</NOTE></P>
<P>The charges of my forbidding them the stage on the first rehearsal, and neglecting to introduce them to the performers, if they did not be∣tray a strange disposition to jealousy and ill humour, would scarce deserve notice. All I can say is, that I never intended to give them the least offence, or to be deficient in any due attention to them; nor did they themselves at that time seem to entertain such suspicions: for it was on the stage that Mr. Rutherford and I first met after the above little dif∣ference: it was on the stage that he took me by the hand, assuring me that he was perfectly satisfied, and how ardently he desired the continua∣tion of a good understanding between us: to which I was so sincerely inclined, that I concealed the whole transaction from Mr. Powell; and the curtain drew up on the 14th of September, with seeming content on all sides, and the most entire harmony in the cabinet of the four kings of Brentford.</P>
<P>The above difference, however, proved to be a prologue to the scenes of disputes that were to succeed. A day or two after <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> our opening the Theatre, I found the two gentlemen there together, and Mr. Harris, to my great surprize, in very ill humour. On enquiring the cause, he said that an insult had been offered to Mrs. Lessingham; concerning which he would make no farther enquiry, as he <HI>would not know</HI> from whom it proceeded. That lady having been engaged on the recommendation of Mr. Harris, I verily believe that Mr. Powell, as well as myself, was inclined to treat her not only with respect, but even with partiality, as far as it could be consistent with the general interest. I ventured therefore to vouch thus much, and desired to know the pre∣sent matter of complaint, which proved to be her having been assigned a dressing-room up stairs. I told him that this was the first word I had ever heard of it: that my attendance on matters merely dramatick and theatrical, was more than sufficient business for me; and that the care of dressing-rooms, ward-robe, &amp;c. had been kindly undertaken by Mr. and Mrs. Powell. Upon this he took me apart, and repeated his ex∣pressions of dissatisfaction with more warmth than before. My second answer was no other than the first; whereupon Mr. Harris in some mea∣sure turned the conversation, by desiring that Mrs. Lessingham might have the part of Imogen. I told him that, as the Cast Book then stood, it was allotted to Miss Ward. He said that Mrs. Lessingham could play it as well. I did not deny but she might; adding, that all the business
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
then assigned to Miss Ward must be understood to be merely on suppo∣sition; for that as I had never seen her play, she might perhaps upon trial appear unfit for it; and that I had given her the part of Imogen, merely on account of the youth and innocence of her figure, which I thought very suitable to the character. I added at the same time, that, as a friend to Mrs. Lessingham, I would advise her never to play a line of Tragedy. This Mr. Harris in some measure allowed, but did not seem to think Imogen so much out of her sphere as Belvidera, and some other tragick characters. I mentioned also, that as Mr. Powell had a capital part in the play, it would be but a reasonable attention to him, to con∣sult how far it would be agreeable to him to cast the play in that manner: but Mr. Harris saw no occasion for Mr. Powell's concurrence. This was all that passed on the subject; and this was the only time that ever the name of Miss Ward was mentioned for the part of Imogen; nor was it then agitated on either side as a matter of contention between <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 16.</NOTE> her and Mrs. Lessingham. From this circumstance the Publick may de∣termine of the confidence that is due to the libellous author of the writ∣ten Narrative; wherein, for obvious reasons, mean as they are base, that young actress is brought forward as the object of dispute. It is to be hoped, however, that these wicked insinuations, false as they are scandalous, will not contribute to throw a stain on the character of a young actress, <HI>whose conduct has</HI> not only <HI>ever been most unexceptionable in</HI> THE THEATRE, but every-where else.</P>
<P>About the same period that the arrangement of Mrs. Lessingham's dressing-room was taken into consideration by Mr. Harris, his friend Mr. Rutherford took upon him to promise a separate dressing-room for Mrs. Bellamy. Mr. and Mrs. Powell remonstrated concerning the great want of room behind the scenes to no purpose. Mr. Rutherford said he had pro∣mised; and if it cost him <HI>500l.</HI> to build new rooms, it must be done. In a word, both the ladies were obliged, and both the gentlemen were satisfied.</P>
<P>On Friday, Sept. 18, the Prompter surprized me, by acquaint∣ing me that Mrs. Lessingham had returned the part of Nerissa in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> the Merchant of Venice; and my surprize was redoubled a few hours after, by his putting into my hands the following letter:</P>
<LETTER>

Piqued at the studied insolence of this epistle, but unwilling to re∣sent it on account of the quarter from which it proceeded, I submitted the letter that very evening to Mr. Harris, who defended the propriety of it in such terms as led me to speak my thoughts very freely, both of the letter and its author. This was very highly resented by Mr. Harris, by whose privity I then took it for granted the letter had been sent; and I have since seen no reason to alter my opinion. He went directly to the Prompter, and ordered him to bring the Cast Book to his house the next day. The Prompter did so, and delivered it to Mess. Harris and Rutherford, from whom, on the morning of Sunday the 20th of Sept. just a week after opening the theatre, I received the following letter:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Here was an open act of hostility; an act so far from endeavouring to extenuate the insolence of Mrs. Lessingham, that it was plainly calcu∣lated to convince me that they were both determined on every occasion to countenance and support it. My answer, sent the same morning, was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"WITHOUT dwelling on the very gross treatment which I have received from yourselves and Mrs. Lessingham, I shall beg leave to remind you, that while you have been conspiring to check my authority, you have exceeded the limits of your own. The article of agreement betwixt us, which invested me with the theatrical management, empowered you jointly to object to my measures, but not to prescribe new ones of your own; and from the director of the theatre, to sink me into something lower than the prompter. You will find therefore, that in making erasements from the Cast Book, and signing a list of parts allotted to Mrs. Lessingham, you have as little attended to the propriety you profess, as to the respect due to</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Your humble servant,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>G. COLMAN."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This answer was, I believe, the first circumstance that served to waken them from the trance of despotism, into which their construction of the article relative to the management had thrown them. A <HI>negative</HI> power it left them, but gave them no <HI>positive</HI> one. They told me indeed at our next meeting, that two negatives made one affirmative. I allowed the truth of that logick; but told them, that <HI>both together,</HI> like the two letters in the word NO, they made but <HI>one</HI> negative. I taxed Mr. Rutherford also with want of candor on this occasion, for joining to insult me without so much as inquiring into the merits of the cause; re∣minding
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
him, at the same time, of the opposite conduct of his friend on a former occasion. Mr. Harris then told me, he found I was an im∣practicable man, and desired, or rather injoined me to put my share to sale. Mr. Powell, who till then had only lamented our divisions in silence, was startled at this proposal, and frankly confest that he thought such proceeding was injurious to our common interest. I told Mr. Harris that, finding I was become so disagreeable a partner to himself and Mr. Rutherford, I should retain my share, on purpose to plague them. It was, I think, at this meeting, and on this occasion, that Mr. Ruther∣ford dwelling very much on the words <HI>manly</HI> and <HI>gentleman-like,</HI> I took occasion to tell him, in a careless manner, that I had never in my life heard those words so often repeated; but that I did not need his instruc∣tion how to behave either like a man or a gentleman. His reply to this was very violent, and ended with talking of <HI>going out with him,</HI> accom∣panying these last words with a stride towards the door. I told him I thought it rather extraordinary, that he was not contented with giving the affront, if any had been given; but that he also claimed the pri∣vilege of resentment: however, that if he supposed I was to be terrified, he was mistaken.—They then recurred to the paper in dispute, and asked if the list of parts contained in it should be considered as admissible. I objected to all the tragedy, particularly Leonora in the Revenge; and added, that Mrs. Sullen belonged to Mrs Bulkley, and that Miss Macklin was the original Widow Belmour. They again asked, if I was inclined to oblige them. I told them my chief cause of offence was their having doubted that inclination, and having flown to acts of violence when gentle means would have been more prevalent. They then suddenly changed their tone and manner; Mrs. Lessingham, sorely against my judgment in many instances, was allowed the characters in question; and we parted once more in tolerable good humour.</P>
<P>Such were the expostulations of Messrs. Harris and Rutherford, and such were the injuries which I delighted to inflict on their favou∣rite actress. But it seems, that I <HI>had conceived a violent pique and resent∣ment against her, the cause of which shall not be here related.</HI> Dark charges must, of necessity, be darkly answered; but whenever the lady, or her advocates, shall please to be more explicit, I promise to <HI>speak plainly</HI> in my answer, if she, or they, shall urge any thing of sufficient importance to demand one at my hands.</P>
<P>I allow the charge of employing <HI>news-papers to defend gross partiali∣ties</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mess. R. and H.'s Narrative, p. 37.</NOTE>; for I was weak enough to mention Mrs. Lessingham's having joined us, with the air of announcing a valuable accession to the strength of our company, by special paragraphs in the public papers. I must
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
also plead guilty to the charge of <HI>forcing unpopular performers on a patient audience</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mess. R. and H.'s Narrative, p. 37.</NOTE>; for on the first night of her appearance, to prevent the morti∣sication that her vanity must suffer from a thin house, in direct opposi∣tion to the opinion of Mr. Macklin, I supported her lame performance on the crutches of Love A-la Mode. I also prefixed the Stratagem, in which she played Mrs. Sullen, to the Oxonian in Town, while its no∣velty was some recommendation to it. I had the more merit in these sacrifices, because they were made in direct contradiction to my private opinion. In the last instance, two strong objections to the measure I pursued, stared me in the face: first, that she played the part most wretchedly; and, secondly, that it was apparently injurious to a little piece, especially one of so serious a cast, to be performed after one of the lightest and pleasantest comedies in our language.</P>
<P>But to return. From the moment after our meeting in conse∣quence of their memorable letter of September 19th, Messrs. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> Harris and Rutherford expressed the highest satisfaction at the conces∣sions which I seemed disposed to make, and were incessantly urging me to bring forward the play of Cymbeline, assigning as a motive, the ve∣ry reason which they now urge for opposing the repetition of it, viz. that <HI>it was frequently exhibited at Drury Lane</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 6.</NOTE>. Mr. Powell also, being extremely attached to the character of Posthumus, was desirous of show∣ing himself in it, whoever might play Imogen. In this situation I could not have avoided exhibiting the play, however averse, without disoblig∣ing them all three, if Mr. Dall had not received orders to paint a new scene of Imogen's chamber; a scene which has since given the public so much satisfaction, but which then necessarily delayed the performance of the piece, into which it was to be introduced. Hence it will appear, that Mrs. Lessingham, without any competition, had been avowedly in possession of the part from the 19th of September, that is, within a week of opening the Theatre. On the 12th of October Mr. and Mrs. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct.</NOTE> Yates were engaged, the history of which transaction shall be given in its proper place. From that instant, I confess, that all my notions of Mrs. Lessingham's playing the part in question vanished; for I could never suppose, that Messrs. Rutherford and Harris would be so blind to their own interests, or that Mrs. Lessingham would entertain such an overweening opinion of her own abilities, as to think of her entering in∣to a direct competition with Mrs. Yates. However, I was soon unde∣ceived; for on Thursday the 29th of October, they roundly insisted on Mrs. Lessingham's retaining the character, which I as roundly refused; but not without remonstrating on the gross partiality that would appear in such a procedure; as well as the injustice to Mrs. Yates, and the af∣front
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
to the public; for all which my reputation, <HI>and chiefly mine,</HI> would suffer. They treated these arguments with great contempt; upon which, finding nothing but further altercation likely to ensue, I abrupt∣ly left them; but I do most solemnly declare, that I did not then, or at any other time, <HI>openly and avowedly disclaim their right to lay me under any restraint;</HI> nor did I <HI>declare, that I would never disclose to them any of my future intentions.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mess. R. and H. 's Narrative, p. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>They were resolved, however, to carry this important point, if possible; and finding the <HI>acting manager</HI> inflexible, they not only tampered with Mr. Powell, but applied to Mrs. Yates, with whom they had a very long conference, in her dressing-room, that very evening, as will ap∣pear from the following letter, which they sent about an hour after they took their leave; and from which, together with Mrs. Yates's answer, it is not difficult to guess at the nature and subject of the conference itself.</P>

<P>This answer was received by Messrs. Harris and Rutherford, at the house of Mr. Powell, who, on every dispute, had always done every thing in his power to reconcile the parties to each other, and was then actually employed in exerting his best endeavours for that purpose. On the receipt of my letter, they both broke out into the most violent pas∣sion. One proposed <HI>to attack my favourites;</HI> and, in the first place, to dismiss Mr. Younger, (the prompter) <HI>because he was useful to me in my business.</HI> It then occurred to exercise their <HI>negative power,</HI> by prohibit∣ing the exhibition of the Oxonian in Town, which was then in rehear∣sal; but that suggestion was, on second thoughts, opposed, because it would be doing me a favour, <HI>as the piece would certainly be damned.</HI></P>
<P>In short, the dispute now grew warm indeed, and the very same evening I received a letter from Mr. Harris, to which, on <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 30.</NOTE> the very same evening, I returned an answer. The letter and answer are as follow:</P>

<P>The next evening Mr. Rutherford came to the theatre alone, and interrupting Mr. Powell during the play, in the midst of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 31.</NOTE> his anxieties in a new part, spoke of me in such terms, that Mr. Powell thought it improper for us to meet; Mr. Rutherford, however, sending to desire to speak with me, I came to him. He said that he had nothing to do with what had past between Mr. Harris and me, but that he now came to inform me, <HI>that I was no longer sole manager of that theatre;</HI> of which publick notice would be given to the performers on Monday morning in the Green Room.

<P>On the same evening, just after the play was over, the prompter re∣ceived the following letter, to which he sent the respectful answer an∣nexed: but, respectful as it was, <HI>it gave the highest cause of offence</HI> to Messrs.

On this occasion I related the story in the plainest terms, read the letters which authenti∣cated my narrative, and <HI>fairly stated</HI> the article relative to the manage∣ment, reciting the <HI>negative power</HI> lodged with Mess. Rutherford and Harris, as well as the <HI>positive</HI> one vested in me. <HI>Read</HI> the article, indeed, I could not, as I then had no copy of it. For the truth of these circum∣stances, I appeal to all the parties then present.</P>
<P>The next morning the tumult, so vehemently threatened on their part, and patiently expected on our own, actually ensued. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 2.</NOTE> About eleven o'clock Mess. Harris and Rutherford came on the stage, and interrupted the rehearsal. They asked me, in an authoritative tone, if I had dismissed Mr. Younger? I answered, No.—Will you dismiss him? No.—Some time after this, Mr. Rutherford said, <HI>Did not we</HI> ORDER you <HI>to dismiss Younger?—</HI>ORDER me, <HI>Sir!—</HI>He immediately recanted the imperious word <HI>order,</HI> and was polite enough to substitute the gentler term <HI>desire.</HI> He read the article in an audible voice on the stage to the performers, and afterwards asked them if they would conti∣nue to act under Mr. Colman's management. They answered, YES.
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
Mr. Rutherford, misunderstanding Mr. Smith, and supposing that he meant to assent to <HI>their</HI> direction, said with great heat, <HI>I am obliged to you, Sir; you are a gentleman.</HI> Mr. Smith, however, being asked by another performer to <HI>what</HI> he had answered <HI>yes,</HI> said, that his YES implied an assent to act under Mr. Colman. <HI>Why then, gentlemen,</HI> said Mr. Ruther∣ford, <HI>I will tell you one thing for your comfort; the Theatre will be shut up, for we shall apply to the court of chancery for an injunction for that purpose.</HI> Soon after these transactions, Mrs. Mattocks fainted away, and I ran among others into the common Green-Room to her assistance. During my absence, a difference arose between my friend and Mr. Rutherford, in confequence whereof he and Mr. Harris left the stage, to which I returned a few seconds before their retiring to the great Green-Room.</P>
<P>In less than half an hour, Mr. Powell came and told me, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 2.</NOTE> that Mess. Harris and Rutherford were inclined to a reconci∣liation, if I would but consent to the dismission of Mr. Younger for five minutes. I replied, that provided his dismission should be <HI>literally</HI> for five minutes, I would assent to it, since they thought the form so neces∣sary to save appearances. I own I did not see why they were so well inclined to terms of peace, which they so peremptorily refused the morning before; but being very deeply affected at the part <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 2.</NOTE> which my friend had taken in this affair, I was willing to do every thing in my power to promote a thorough reconciliation on all sides. Accordingly I accompanied Mr. Powell into the great Green-Room; and being asked by Mr. Harris <HI>whether I would carry on the ma∣nagement without doing any thing contrary to the article?</HI> I replied, to the best of my knowledge and belief, in these words: <HI>I never</HI> DID <HI>any thing contrary to the article: I never</HI> MEANT <HI>to do any thing contrary to our arti∣cle. All I desire is to manage according to the article, and to have an unin∣terrupted exercise of the power which the article gives me.</HI> Mess. Wood∣ward, Smith, Gibson, &amp;c. were present: to them I appeal for the truth of this relation; and to them I appeal whether <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the printed Narrative, p. 11.</NOTE> <HI>I apparently took shame to myself</HI> on this occasion.</P>
<P>The gentlemen, however, preserved the decorums of resentment to the last, and thought it necessary, on the very moment of our reconci∣liation, to commit a fresh violation of the article in question, by writing the following note to the treasurer of the Theatre:</P>

<P><HI>Mr.</HI> GARTON.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="35"/>
A reconciliation being thus effected, Mr. Harris desired, that as the play of Cymbeline had been so much the object of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 2.</NOTE> conversation and dispute, it might be laid aside for the present. Accord∣ingly it was so; and the appearance of a good understanding among us was once more restored. But it was with the utmost difficulty that Mess. Harris and Rutherford preserved these appearances; for, instead of each of them favouring me with their advice in a friendly manner, they were continually sending me letters formally signed by them both. This was so directly opposite to their professions, that I expostulated with Mr. Harris on the subject, and told him, that I was in hopes we were now to have gone on as friends, without recurring, in every little instance, to the article, and reminding each other of the extent and limits of our re∣spective power; but that if I saw him and his friend resolved to drive me, on every occasion, to the ground of the article, I would stand on that ground, and defend it to the last; for that I very well knew how much and how little power that article gave me. Mr. Harris replied, that we had all just power enough to plague each other; and, to convince me that he might easily be induced to exercise that power on his part, he added, that the breach between us had been so very wide, that it would not readily close again, without the most sincere desires and en∣deavours on all sides. I professed the greatest readiness to promote so desirable an end; but the gentlemen were so little inclined to meet me half-way, that they still continued the same mode of behaviour which had led me to the above-mentioned expostulation. In short, I plainly saw that they never would forget or forgive the transactions of the second of November.</P>
<P>About the latter end of that month, while things were in this situation, Mr. Dall had finished the scene intended for Cymbe∣line. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Novemb.</NOTE> This redoubled Mr. Powell's impatience and anxiety to exhibit the play; and he applied to Mess. Harris and Rutherford (particularly the former) in the most earnest and submissive terms, to wave their ob∣jections to it. Mr. Harris was inexorable; Mr. Rutherford said, that we ought not to perform it <HI>without asking Mrs. Lessingham's leave;</HI> and referred the farther consideration of it to our next meeting.</P>
<P>One little occurrence, that happened about this time, will perhaps shew the temper and complexion of these gentlemen, more than a matter of more consequence. The prompter had orders to send them every evening an account of the rehearsal settled for the next morning, and at the end of every week a plan of my arrangement of plays for the week ensuing. One of these notes was as follows:</P>

<P>This was addressed to Mr. Rutherford. The like note was addressed to Mr. Harris, only concluding with the word <HI>fixed</HI> instead of <HI>settled,</HI> as in the above. Mr. Harris was so touched at this expression, that he asked the prompter if the note was dictated by Mr. Colman. The promp∣ter replied in the negative. Mr. Harris then commented on the word <HI>fixed;</HI> and observed, that if the business was <HI>fixed</HI> by Mr. Colman, there was no need of submitting the plan of it to them.

<P>"YOUR intimation of <HI>my not treating you fairly,</HI> in the beginning of your letter, does not carry that air of cordiality which you profess in the conclusion of it. If there are such cogent reasons for disobeying his Majesty's commands, it would have been kind in you to have suggested them, as I must confess that none occurred to me which I durst have submitted to his royal notice. The opera cannot be ready on Thursday, and must therefore be postponed till next week. I confess I never thought of the author's sixth night; and as the first night of the opera stood for Friday, in the plan of business sent you, it is pity it did not occur to you sooner, as we shall probably be considerable sufferers by the alteration; not to mention the great hardship on the composer, who is detained from Bath, to his great incon∣venience.</P>

The next day I met them at the Theatre, and fairly told <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 10.</NOTE> them, that it was impossible for me to proceed in the ma∣nagement, while they so studiously endeavoured to take every occasion to make me uneasy; that Cymbeline was in the list of plays submitted to his majesty at the beginning of the season; but to convince them that I did not want to carry any points but such as were conducive to the ge∣neral interest, which I had always meant to pursue, I was resolved to refer my conduct to those who had embarked their property with us, and to their own friends in particular; that it was a wanton piece of cruelty to be perpetually trying to make my mind miserable, when my labours rather deserved their thanks; that I had been a voluntary slave in the conduct of their property; but that I was extremely hurt on their seeming inclined to treat me like a servant in every particular, except that of paying me wages.</P>
<P>They received this expostulation on my part with more temper and moderation than usual. They declared that they had repeatedly, and on all occasions, professed how much they thought themselves obliged to me; and no longer insisted on my representing to their Majesties that we could not obey their Royal Commands respecting the exhibition of Cymbeline. Mr. Rutherford, a day or two after, lamented the little bickering at this meeting, professing the warmest cordiality towards me on his side, and vouching for the same sentiments on behalf of his friend Mr. Harris.</P>
<P>The rehearsals of Cymbeline were then continued without <NOTE PLACE="marg">Decemb.</NOTE> farther interruption or remonstrance; and on Monday the twenty-eighth of December the representation of the play was honoured with the presence of their Majesties; after whose departure the plays, as usual, were announced, and, among the rest, Cymbeline <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 28.</NOTE> again for the succeeding Thursday, which occasioned the fol∣lowing notes:</P>
<P>Monday Evening, 10 o'clock, Dec. 28th.</P>
<P>"MR. HARRIS and Mr. Rutherford present compliments to Mr. Colman.—Are much concerned that he directed Cymbeline to be given out this evening. Mr. Colman is well acquainted with their sentiments on that subject, and how much it is their desire that Cymbeline should for the present be postponed. They doubt not he will conduct this circumstance accordingly."</P>
<P>"MR. COLMAN presents his compliments to Mess. Harris and Rutherford, and is equally concerned and surprized at their repugnance to the repetition of Cymbe∣line; which is the more unexpected, as he mentioned to Mr. Harris his intention to have given it out for the next night, had it not been for the indisposition of Mr. Powell. He flatters himself they must do him the justice to acknowledge the de∣licacy which has been used towards them in this point. As this play had unhappily been the cause of dissension, it was laid aside for a time, and at length resumed and
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
performed by the express command of their Majesties; to whose royal orders it would appear an indirect affront, to discontinue a performance, so likely to redound to the interest and credit of the theatre; at the same time that such a conduct would be a publick confirmation of the evil reports of disputes amongst the managers. From this and many other considerations which their own good sense will suggest to them, Mr. Colman flatters himself, that on cool reflection, they will chearfully concur with himself and Mr. Powell."</P>
<P>Dec. 29th.</P>
<P>"THE compliments of Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Harris wait on Mr. Colman. It is certain Mr. C. did mention his design of giving out Cymbeline to Mr. H. which exceedingly surprized him; but Mr. H. was very happy to hear it was to be deferred, both on account of the hatred he ever bears, and the unwillingness he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about him always to enter into altercation, and that there would be time to take Mr. R's opinion. The advice of their friends, joined to their coolest reflection, still suggests to them the absolute impropriety of representing the play of Cymbe∣line again so soon as proposed.</P>
<P>Their united and most sincere wishes are, that this little difference may end here, and no more may ever arise; and that Mr. C. will, in some degree, pay attention to <HI>their sentiments:</HI> seeing <HI>that</HI> will make their happiness consist in <HI>entirely pursuing</HI> those of Mr. C.</P>
<P>Surry street, Tuesday one o'clock.</P>
<P>I was now credibly informed that, during the rehearsal of the play, wagers had been laid by some, who were of their <HI>privy-council,</HI> that Cymbeline would never be performed but <HI>once.</HI> We had been at great expence in the decorations, which were much approved; the play was esteemed a creditable performance; and there was a great demand for places against any future representation of it, not to repeat the duty in∣cumbent on us to testify the utmost respect to the Royal Order by which it had been revived at our Theatre. The expences bestowed on the play had been incurred with the consent and approbation of Mess. Harris and Rutherford, in whom it was therefore the more unreasonable to preclude our reaping the profits that might result from them. It appeared also impossible to keep terms with men, who were for ever seeking occasions of dispute. On these considerations I made no reply to the above note, and continued to advertise the play.</P>

mode of distressing and embarrassing us in our affairs: but it was almost impossible to conceive or imagine that they meant to ground a charge of fraud or collusion in this circumstance, after they had, by the advice of Mrs. Rich, approved of keeping the unappropriated cloaths out of the wardrobe; and had not only joined with me in desiring Mrs. Powell to take the care of them, but agreed to purchase Mr. Rich's dwelling∣house adjoining to the Theatre for the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Powell, allowing a very large abatement of the rent, in consideration of their re∣serving a room for the occasional meetings of the managers, and other apartments for the purpose of lodging therein the unappropriated cloaths.</P>
<P>As Mess. Harris and Rutherford were now to stand forward as acting managers, no circumstance, however minute, tending to im∣press <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 2.</NOTE> an idea of their importance, was to be neglected or over-looked.

<P><PB N="40" REF="44"/>
Knowing the unquiet spirits of the writers, I looked upon this letter, as well as that to Mr. Powell, to be nothing more than a fresh <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 2.</NOTE> insult, that their resentments to me might keep pace with their instances of spleen to Mr. Powell. I must own I never expected to be called on for a justification of my character in a transa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of this nature; and I am very well convinced, that the gentlemen themselves never thought of exhibiting so scandalous a charge, till after the second repre∣sentation of the play of Cymbeline. This, and the other assertions rela∣tive to Mr. Powell's going to Bristol, as well as the insinuations con∣cerning the wardrobe, and Mrs. Yates's engagement, will appear to be the most exceptionable parts of Mess. Harris and Rutherford's conduct. Passion is a human frailty, and therefore in some degree excusable; but rancour and malice, supported by falshood, are diabolical.</P>
<P>The affairs of the wardrobe have been already considered. The matters of King Lear, and Mr. Powell's going to Bristol in the summer, were both agitated so long ago as on Thursday the 26th of November, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 26.</NOTE> and the substance of what past was as follows:</P>
<P>I told them that the money arising from my night, as author of the Oxonian in Town, lay as yet in the office; but that as I was, by our articles, to be paid for every thing which I did in such a capacity, I would, if they thought proper, take <HI>the clear receipt</HI> of the house that night, as a consideration for my insertions in the Rehearsal at the opening of the Theatre, and my alteration of King Lear; adding, that the alteration of Lear had given me more trouble than that of Philaster, for which I had a night at Drury-Lane; but that as it did not absolutely add a play to our catalogue, and as it was a work I should never have undertaken had I not been engaged in the direction of a theatre, I should be very well contented with such a consideration for my trouble. They asked if I had not better refer all those matters to the end of the season. I replied, with all my heart; that I did not mean to ask it as a favour; but that as I believed I should do nothing more of that sort this year, and as the money happened to be in the office, those circumstances had in∣duced me to mention the matter at that time. Mr. Powell declared his opinion, that the demand was a very moderate one, and that he thought I might very reasonably have claimed a night. I said that, whenever I produced my alteration of the Silent Woman, I should be undoubtedly en∣titled to one for that piece; but in the present instance I should be very well satisfied with the sum then in the office: whereupon it was unani∣mously agreed, that I should take out the clear receipt, which amounted to 64 <HI>l.</HI> 5 <HI>s.</HI> more than was due to me as author of the Oxonian in Town. The above letter, insolent as it is, does not deny my having been <HI>paid</HI> by their consent; but it is particularly happy for me, that Mr. Hutchinson,
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
a gentleman whose integrity has heretofore extorted even their approha∣tion, was present at this scene, and can vouch for the truth of this re∣lation.</P>
<P>But, says the invidious note to the printed Narrative <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See their Narrative, p. 13.</NOTE>, This is <HI>a custo∣mary liberty taken from time to time with this play in the representation: and, particularly, by the celebrated manager of Drury Lane, who, we are assured, never charged a single farthing to his brother patentee for such ser∣vices.</HI> If the celebrated manager of Drury Lane had ever attempted to execute my projected plan of altering King Lear, my labours on this occasion would undoubtedly have been superseded; <HI>but that he never charged a single farthing to his brother patentee for such services</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On a revisal of this page, and a second reference to their printed Narrative, I find, that their note in p. 13. concerning <HI>the customary liberty taken with this play in representation,</HI> alludes to the play of <HI>The Rehearsal;</HI> not to King Lear. In that instance Mr. Shuter, as well as every former <HI>Bays,</HI> took the same liberty, and charged nothing extraordinary for such services. But the usual <HI>extempore</HI> pleasantries of the actor in this character, are very different in point of quantity, not to say quality, from those written additions which they are pleased to call <HI>the insertion of a few liues</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mess. R. and H.'s Narrative, p. 13.</NOTE> How much of the 64l. 5s. Mess. R. and H. are pleased to charge to this account, I cannot tell; but my agreement gave me an undoubted right to receive a consideration for them: and, few and trifling as they are pleased to call these additions, on whatever occasion they shall produce the like, I will convince them I have not been over-paid.</NOTE>, both he and his brother patentee know to be false; and that justly celebrated manager himself, more than once, proposed to me to join with him in <HI>a reform of the theatre,</HI> wherein those pieces which did not require so much alteration as to entitle the new editor to a benefit-night, were to be rewarded <HI>by a certain sum</HI> for each play. My revisal of King Lear falls directly under that description; and, I believe, the manager him∣self will allow, that I have had no more than a <HI>quantum meruit</HI> for my trouble; nay, I will submit to be tried by a theatrical jury, with that manager, as he ever ought to be, at their head; and I will forfeit double the sum, if my foreman does not bring me in <HI>not guilty.</HI> That he has been paid for his services is most certain, as it is most certain; that he has been paid no more than he has very fairly earned. He was pleased to tell me, that I should find my trouble, as acting-manager, would very well deserve 500 l. a year; and to add, that he would give my partners 500 l. a year, if they would not suffer me to be acting-manager. These were his sentiments and expressions at that time; but, as Abraham says in Harlequin's Invasion, <HI>those happy days are over.</HI></P>
<P>The other affair stands thus:</P>
<P>On the 28th of May, when the article relative to Mr. Powell's salary, &amp;c. was signed, when Mr. Hutchinson, who prepared it, <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 28.</NOTE> first read that clause, wherein it was to be agreed, that <HI>none of the</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
<HI>parties should, after the first of October, act, write, or have any concern in any other theatre,</HI> Mr. Powell absolutely refused to sign it, alledging the necessity he should be under to retain his property at Bristol, at least for some years, in justice both to himself and his family; who, notwith∣standing the emoluments that might accrue from our intended purchase, would be extremely distressed and pinched in their income, till he had paid off the money, principal as well as interest, bor∣rowed <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 28.</NOTE> on the occasion. After two or three hours debate, he, with great reluctance, set his hand to the article; and I will venture to say, that my arguments and warmth on the occasion induced him to consent to it. At the same time, to mark our sense of his compliance in this in∣stance, he was promised, by Messrs. Harris and Rutherford, as well as myself, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See their printed Narrative, p. 14.</NOTE> <HI>to indemnify him,</HI> in some measure at least, <HI>for the loss he should sustain by not acting at Bristol in the summer,</HI> should be a matter of our future consideration.</P>
<P>After the completion of the purchase, and our opening the theatre, Mr. Powell frequently took occasion to mention this matter, and desired to know on what footing this affair was to stand, that he might deter∣mine in what manner to conduct himself, in regard to his connections in Bristol. Mess. Rutherford and Harris, for a long time, found means to evade giving a determinate answer; but, on the 26th of November, Mr. Powell desiring a categorical answer, they told him they would give him leave to go to Bristol; that they had altered their sentiments on this head, and conceived the reputation of each patentee to be as distinct as his person, and that the actions of one individual would be no derogation to the character of another; that they were even reduced, though with great regret, to <HI>plead poverty</HI> on the occasion; for, as the money laid down for the purchase was not all their own, what with the payment of interest, and the large incomes they had given up by aban∣doning trade, their abilities to oblige Mr. Powell did not keep pace with their inclinations; besides which, it was to be considered, that both Mr. Powell and myself derived emoluments from the theatre, in which they had no share: but however, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See their printed Narrative, p. 14.</NOTE> <HI>to show their unwillingness to deprive him of any pecuniary advantage, they assented to his going;</HI> and ordered Mr. Hutchinson to draw up a proper form of permission, in writing, on the spot, to be immediately signed by Mr. Colman and themselves. To this, however, Mr. Colman would by no means consent, saying, that he originally opposed Mr. Powell's going to Bristol <HI>propter dignitatem,</HI> thinking it inconsistent with his present situation; but that if they had surmounted that obstacle, he had no stronger objections to urge a∣gainst it; though he would never suffer it to appear under his hand, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 15.</NOTE>
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
that, for the sake of refusing some <HI>rascal counters to his friend,</HI> he would suffer him to bring an imputation on them all. To shew however, that he did not mean to counteract Mr. Powell's intention, or their per∣mission, he proposed to add to that clause in the article relative to the parties not being concerned in any other theatre, the words <HI>within ten miles of London;</HI> by the insertion whereof, Mr. Powell would be at li∣berty to follow his own inclinations, without rendering Mr. Colman re∣sponsible for a conduct which he did not approve, and would be glad to find proper means to prevent. As to the separate emoluments of Mr. Powell and himself, he reminded Mess. Rutherford and Harris, that they were no more than they must necessarily pay to other actors and authors; and that, as Mr. Powell and Mr. Colman paid each a fourth of it them∣selves, their particular advantages from their labours were less than those of others in the same situation; but that, such as they were, if Mess. Harris and Rutherford would <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See printed Narrative, p. 35.</NOTE> <HI>enact tragedies, or write comedies,</HI> they would be entitled to the like. As to Mr. Colman's <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 14.</NOTE> <HI>going so far as to insist warmly on the reasonableness and equity of Mr. Powell's demand of a be∣nefit</HI> on this occasion, it is absolutely false, for which I appeal to Mr. Hutchinson. Such a demand, I really think, after the transaction of the 28th of May, would have been both reasonable and equitable; but, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the mode of compensation was not mentioned, nor any such demand then made by Mr. Powell.</P>
<P>By this time the reader will be tolerably enabled to judge how far the narratives, printed and manuscript, <HI>drawn up by the</HI> AUTHORITY of Messs. Harris and Rutherford, are <HI>supported by indubitable and authentick evidence</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Apology prefixed to the printed Narrative.</NOTE>. Their account of the engagement of Mr. and Mrs. Yates is, in point of exactness and veracity, consistent with the rest of their narration. The very date is erroneous, purposely erroneous, like that of the first material transaction between us. Their Narratives <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See printed Narrative, p. 11.</NOTE> would in∣sinuate the engagements of Mr. and Mrs. Yates to be subsequent to the transactions of the second of November; thereby meaning to con∣ceal, as they have always most industriously endeavoured, the <HI>real cause</HI> of those violent disputes, and to hold up Miss Ward as the object of contention. She never was, on any occasion, rendered an object of con∣tention; though the note in their Narrative <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 15.</NOTE> relative <HI>to some personal al∣tercation, on account of casting the parts of Cymbeline,</HI> expresly says, in di∣rect contradiction to the living testimony of the whole theatre, <HI>Mr. Colman wanting Miss W—to play the part of Imogen; which Harris and Rutherford conceived would be better supplied by Mrs. L—,</HI> WHO HAD
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
PLAYED IT THE PRECEDING SEASON AT DRURY LANE. <HI>On Mrs. Yates's joining the company however, and refusing to give up the part, it was assigned to neither.</HI> The poor flimsy fallacy of their whole represen∣tation of this matter must be evident to every person who has read the foregoing pages of this <HI>true</HI> state of the case. Miss Ward's claim to the character had never been set up with an air of contradiction to their sen∣timents; was never maintained in competition with Mrs. Lessingham; and was wholly withdrawn within eight days after opening the theatre. Mrs. Yates was engaged on the twelfth of October <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>actually played Jane Shore on the sixteenth; and whether the character of Imogen should be performed by Mrs. Yates or Mrs. Lessingham, was notoriously the whole subject-matter of the violent heats and animosities from the twenty-ninth of October of the second of November. Yet, say Mess. Harris and Rutherford, in their printed narrative, after having con∣cluded their garbled account of those transactions, <HI>The</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 11.</NOTE> <HI>reconciliation which</HI> ENSUED <HI>gave Harris and Rutherford some reason to hope that af∣fairs would now be carried on in an amicable manner.</HI> THEY WERE VERY SOON HOWEVER SURPRIZED <HI>with Mr. Colman's having taken upon him to engage Mr. and Mrs. Yates:</HI> an assertion, in respect to its chronology, which the very authority of the play-bills is sufficient to confute.</P>
<P>Still, however, (say they) Mr. Colman engaged Mr. and Mrs. Yates; and the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 13.</NOTE> <HI>surprise of Harris and Rutherford was the greater, as all the four,</HI> IN A CONSULTATION HELD <HI>some days before, had been unanimously of a con∣trary opinion.</HI> The only <HI>consultation</HI> that I recollect on this affair was, that I had one day the honour of all the proprietors under my roof at din∣ner; after which the subject was started, I believe by Mr. Powell, who seemed very desirous of forming such an engagement. Mr. Rutherford also seemed to lean to his opinion: I was not wholly disinclined to it, provided we could obtain Mrs. Yates without her husband, whose assist∣ance, excellent as he is, as our company stood, we did not so much need: Mr. Harris was wholly averse to our thinking of either.</P>
<P>It was then generally said that Mr. Barry and Mrs. Dancer were not to return to Dublin; and on the Saturday following the latter was pub∣lickly announced, after the play at Drury Lane, to perform there on the succeeding Wednesday. The impatience and anxiety of Mr. Powell could then no longer be subdued. He prest me in the most earnest man∣ner to permit him to enter into a serious negotiation with Mrs. Yates; adding, that he thought I carried my punctilious delicacy towards the managers of Drury Lane much too far; that if Mr. Barry and Mrs. Dancer had crossed the water, and Mrs. Yates had still been standing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut upon terms, it would perhaps have been illiberal to interfere; but
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
that since the managers of Drury Lane had thought proper to take Mr. Barry and Mrs. Dancer into their house, still leaving an opening for Mr. and Mrs. Yates, he did not think, in justice to ourselves, that we ought to omit strengthening our company with so popular an actress as Mrs. Yates. These arguments had, in my opinion, so much weight, that I told him I should be glad to know whether Mrs. Yates would join us <HI>alone.</HI> This, on his application to her, she refused; whereupon Mr. Powell intreated me, if I had the least regard for his peace of mind, or his reputation, to engage <HI>both.</HI> We went <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 11.</NOTE> together to Mr. Harris's house in Surry Street. Mr. Harris was out of town. We then went to Mr. Rutherford's in Newman Street. Mr. Rutherford also not being to be found, a note was left, requesting the favour of seeing him at the theatre, on earnest business, next morning by ten or eleven o'clock. We waited till near noon, at which time we set out for Mr. Yates's at Mortlake, leaving the following letter from Mr. Powell for Mr. Rutherford. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 12.</NOTE></P>

<P>"SINCE I had the pleasure to see you, I find that Mr. G—has engaged B—and Mrs. D—; and I, yesterday, had the most assured intelligence, that they had complied to give Mr. and Mrs. Y—their own terms, the consequence of which you must see—that they would do every play in such a manner, with B—, D—, and Y—, that we should not be able to make the least stand against them; and in such case, my reputation as an actor (standing alone) must sink; which to prevent, I would, for my own sake, withdraw myself from the stage, for a time, as an actor.

<P><HI>To</HI> J. RUTHERFORD, <HI>Esq.</HI></P>
<P>In the evening I went to the theatre; and, from the whole tenor of Mr. Rutherford's behaviour, which was agreeable to the spirit of his letter, I concluded, I still think not without reason, that he was very well satisfied with what we had done, thinking it a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 12.</NOTE> measure conducive to the interest and reputation of the theatre. Mr. Harris, however, it must not be dissembled, appeared extremely dissa∣tisfied, construing Mr. Powell's letter as a menace, and declaring his <HI>right to think their consent necessary to our forming an engagement of so much expence and consequence</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Printed Narrative, p. 12.</NOTE>. I acknowledged that right; and assured him that Mr. Powell's letter was not intended as a menace; that, consider∣ing the tragick standing-army of Drury Lane, occasionally reinforced by Mr. Garrick himself, if we ever meant to use a bowl or a dagger this season, I thought the measure was right; but that if, after all, Mr. Rutherford and himself should declare themselves to be of a contrary opinion, Mr. Powell and myself would chearfully defray the expence of that engagement, being conscious that there was an irregularity, in hav∣ing formed it without having previously obtained their assent to it. At length Mr. Powell intreated Mr. Harris, if he had any regard for his (Mr. Powell's) fame or happiness, to shew no farther repugnance to the measure; whereupon Mr. Harris declared he would never say any thing farther against it. How far Mr. Harris has kept his word, or how far Mr. Rutherford's subsequent conduct has been agreeable to
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
his behaviour at that period, the reader is left to determine; and their objection to this engagement, on account of the expence of it, may be estimated by their conference with Mrs. Yates, as well as their letter to her, on the 29th of October. Whether this engagement has enabled us to add to the publick entertainment, the Publick will judge for themselves.</P>
<P>But here again occurs another instance of collusion; for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed Narrative, p. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Mr. Powell became entitled to the addition of</HI> 100 <HI>l. to his salary: and it</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Note to ibid.</NOTE> <HI>is to be re∣marked that Mr. Woodward's engagement was antecedent to Mr. Powell's article; by virtue of which he was entitled to a larger salary than any per∣former hereafter</HI> TO BE <HI>engaged.</HI> The reader is desired to observe, that Mr. Powell's article with us, as a Performer, was signed, as appears by the date, on the 28th of May, some weeks before we were in possession of the patents; and I will appeal to Mr. Hutchinson before-mentioned, who drew the article, and whose name appears as a witness to it, as well as to the <HI>consciences</HI> of all the parties who signed it, whether the whole scope and intention of that article was not to secure to Mr. Powell the first sala∣ry in the theatre. In what manner a court of law might construe the words TO BE <HI>engaged;</HI> and how far the casual circumstance of Mr. Woodward's being in articles with the preceding patentees, at a higher salary, might render him an exception; I will not pretend to decide: but before Mr. T. Harris ventures another <HI>comparison</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Note to ibid. p. 26.</NOTE> <HI>between Mr. Powell's disingenuity and his own generosity,</HI> we would advise him not to insist on the above construction. Mr. Woodward's excellence in his profession is very well known: but does he, excellent as he is, deserve a superior salary to Mr. Powell? And will any reader of common sense conceive it to be the meaning of any of the parties concerned, to rate Mr. Powell lower than Mr. Woodward?—This, however, is the ground of the black charge of collusion between Mr. Powell and Mr. Colman, by which sinister method they were to add 100 l. to Mr. Powell's salary; fifty of which they were of necessity to pay themselves, and to divide the remaining fifty between them. Add to which, that estimating Mr. Yates's salary at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 l. which added to that of Mrs. Yates's, amounted to the gross sum of 800 l. Mr. Colman and Mr. Powell, by a most re∣fined stroke of policy, contrived to pay 200 l. each out of their pock∣ets, for the sake of receiving five and twenty. Hence appears the great utility of the narratives of Mess. Harris and Rutherford, who <HI>thought it incumbent on them, as well in justification of themselves, as out of respect to the Publick, to prevent, as far as lies in their power,</HI> ANY MISREPRESENTA∣TION OF FACTS. <NOTE PLACE="marg">∥ See Apology to their printed Narrative.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="52"/>
The relation of these transactions, which naturally fell under the charges of <HI>collusion</HI> and <HI>fraud,</HI> carried on between me and Mr. Powell, has necessarily turned the tide of my narrative, which will now run on, as it began, in the regular course of time.</P>

<P>This event afforded great matter of triumph to Mess. Harris and Rutherford, as appears by the stile of their letters that imme∣diately <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 5.</NOTE> succeeded it. For our parts we cannot, to this moment, ac∣count for their exultation on this occasion; for what could more testify the weakness of their cause, than their unwillingness to submit it to their particular friends, without any thing on my side, but the plain merits of the question? We are also equally at a loss to account for the conduct of the gentlemen whose names appear at the bottom of the above let∣ter; who not only peremptorily refused to hear the case, which might probably have led to an accommodation; but took upon themselves to prejudge a matter, of which they could not possibly know more than one side of the question.</P>

In the mean time Mess. Rutherford and Harris, delighting themselves with the idea of my disappointment, amused themselves with preparing an additional uneasiness and insult for me at my return. To this pur∣pose they took care that I should find an irritating letter on my table, which I was weak and peevish enough to distinguish by an answer, which produced, the very same evening, a reply more insolent than their original epistle. They are here subjoined, according to the order in which they were written.</P>

<P>In the above letter it is remarkable, that the gentlemen could not restrain their indignation within their letter, but suffered it to overflow, even to the direction; and remembering Tully's maxim, <HI>ex officina nil liberale,</HI> contemptuously reproached Mr. Powell with lodging <HI>at a mu∣sick shop.</HI></P>
<P>The same evening I was honoured with the following: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 6.</NOTE></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"THE cruel necessity we lay under of holding correspondence with you is ex∣ceedingly distressing and dangerous, which we are convinced of from the meeting
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>
of the players, whom you clandestinely convened, and read to them our private letters, though wrote to you in personal confidence, and in the most unguarded manner, some of them on points to which we could only be responsible as man to man.</P>
<P>You have often threatened us to retire from the management. You have often threatened us to appeal to the Publick; nay, you absolutely have had the effrontery to dare an appeal <HI>to our friends:</HI> the issue of <HI>that</HI> appeal, we believe, still lives in your memory. With respect to the Publick, <HI>our reliance</HI> on their protection cannot be exceeded by <HI>your own;</HI> and we have now by us a <HI>narrative</HI> of our whole proceedings with you, from the first moment to the present time, all ready for publication; but we have been advised by our friends not <HI>immediately</HI> to publish it; and if <HI>you</HI> do ap∣peal to them, (the Publick) it can only be occasioned by your depending on your art to work upon the <HI>passions</HI> of mankind, and because you dare not wait to abide by their <HI>judgment,</HI> as must be the case in a high court of judicature.</P>
<P>You will urge, perhaps, how much we are obliged to <HI>you</HI> for the trouble you have given yourself, in taking upon you the whole management of the theatre, and to Mr. Powell for procuring the purchase of all our wardrobe, necessaries, and keeping them afterwards in his own house. From the above circumstances severe injuries have, in the opinion of us both, already arisen to our fortunes, and (the barrier being now entirely destroyed, which was formed for our safety) we dread the future ones.</P>
<P>It is not for us to determine the spirit of our articles from the <HI>letter</HI> of them: that we will not presume to do; but you are conscious—we say, Sir, <HI>you know</HI> that it was our constant, repeated, and uniform declaration, that we would never be con∣cerned with you in the theatre, without having both of us an equality of power with you in the management thereof.</P>
<P>We observe it to be your constant method, when we have objected to a play, that you have ordered a weaker one. <HI>You have no right to order a play for representation before it has been proposed to us.</HI> What can be expected from the play of to-night, weak in itself, and having been already repeated this season to bad houses?

<P>The two plays referred to in the conclusion of this letter, were the Confederacy, and the Recruiting Officer, acted on the first two nights of the revival of Orpheus and Eurydice. It is a pity the gentlemen chose, in this instance, to prognosticate; for had they staid till they had an ac∣count of the <HI>receipts</HI> of those nights, which were very considerable, they might have known <HI>what might be expected from them.</HI></P>
<P>Agreeable and entertaining as it was, we had neither leisure nor in∣clination to maintain so polite a correspondence. We desisted, there∣fore, from taking any notice of their letters, and a kind of sullen silence ensued for some days. In the mean time, the avaricious Colman and collusive Powell were digging in the mine for the benefit of Harris and

Co. who, while they were eating the bread of our industry and the publick munificence, and the manna was yet in their mouths, like the Israelites in the wilderness, murmured against their feeders.</P>
<P>On the 11th of January, the correspondence was renewed with an assumed air of candour and moderation, which, however, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 11.</NOTE> they not being able to sustain, the correspondence broke off a second time.

<P>"INCLOSED you will receive a copy of Mr. Hoskins's opinion on our case. As his abilities and integrity in the law are well known to Mr. Colman, we have the greater reliance upon the impression they must necessarily make. This opinion, as well as another we have taken, points out the infallible remedy for redress; yet, like the rest, it advises an adjustment by arbitration, because our dispute (differing from the generality) must be attended with the severest injury to the property litigated, exclusive of the personal expence to be incurred individually. We therefore pro∣pose an arbitration of our dispute by four gentlemen, <HI>totally unconcerned in affairs of the Theatre;</HI> two to be nominated by us; unexceptionable in point of rank, for∣tune and reputation; and impartial, never having been in the least concerned in our affairs.—If you shall both concur in this proposal, and nominate two gentlemen of equal consideration and impartiality, we shall be ready to enter into bonds for submitting to the award of the gentlemen so nominated.—You will see we could not accept or even answer the proposals you made, because you had, without our knowledge, taken upon you to determine who should be judges of our cause; yet reserving to yourselves the liberty of receiving or rejecting their award.</P>
<P>"In case you shall listen to this proposal, we shall not remit the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dor with which we are now prosecuting our suit in Chancery, until the bonds of arbitration are signed. (We mention this, that you may not afterwards imagine there had been duplicity in our conduct.)</P>
<P>"If you shall not listen to this proposal, we shall, besides prosecuting our suit immediately, take such steps, however violent, as will more speedily prevent your managing our property against our consent; being well ascertained, that for what∣ever damages may accrue, you will be responsible. And we shall have this addi∣tional satisfaction arise to our minds, (which we doubt not will also have its weight in a court of judicature) that we are not the authors of the train of mischiefs which must ensue your refusal.</P>

<P>"UPON perusal of the case of Mr. H. and Mr. R. and the articles of agree∣ment therein stated, and the letters which have passed between them and Mr. C. I am of opinion that Mr. C. and Mr. P. have been guilty of many material and sub∣stantial

As also in em∣ploying and taking into the service of the Theatre Mr. and Mrs. Yates, (espe∣cially at so large salaries) not only without the consent of Mr. H. and Mr. R. but even contrary to a resolution wherein he (Mr. C.) himself joined with Mr. H. and R. a few days before.—And with respect to Mr. P. in taking great part of the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>drobe from the Theatre into the particular possession of himself or his wife. And it seems to me, from the conduct of Mr. C. and Mr. P. hitherto, as if they were determined to throw off all regard to the articles, and to act in the management of all matters relating to the Theatre, as sole and entire owners thereof, in absolute exclusion of Mr. H. and Mr. R. from any further concern therein, than to receive their shares of the clear profits thereof.</P>
<P>"I am also of opinion, that if a bill was to be filed by Mr. H. and Mr. R. against Mr. C. and Mr. P. and his wife in the court of Chancery, that court would decree <HI>a specific performance</HI> of the articles for the future, and would order Mr. C. and Mr. P. to make satisfaction to Mr. H. and Mr. R. for their respective shares of all <HI>damages</HI> which shall appear to have been sustained by any breaches of the articles by them respectively; and would order Mr. P. and his wife to deposite in the proper apartments of the Theatre the parts of the wardrobe which they have improperly taken into their possession.

<P>The day after Mr. Garton received the letter, directing him to charge as cash the orders for admission to the theatre, issued by the several Pro∣prietors, or by their direction; Mr. Garton, at my desire, waited on Mr. Harris, to know if He and Mr. Rutherford meant to restrain the Per∣formers from occasionally giving orders to their friends, as usual? Mr. Harris replied, that it was an established privilege, of which neither Mr. Rutherford nor himself ever wished or intended to deprive them. So that the only persons who were not to be allowed that privilege were, it seems, the Proprietors themselves.</P>
<P>In the first of the above letters, Mess. Harris and Rutherford, with the same spirit of openness and ingenuity that has shone through all their conduct, transmitted to me a copy of a learned counsel's opinion, without sending me, at the same time, a copy of the case whereon that opinion was given; and how far I wronged those gentlemen in <HI>affect∣ing to think,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 31.</NOTE> <HI>that a fair and impartial state of the case had not been laid before the counsel;</HI> those who have compared this plain tale with their tales, may easily determine. The client who deceives his counsel, ul∣timately deceives himself; but the truth is, that the chief object in view was, to draw from some eminent counsel such an opinion, as might serve to bow my mind to truckle to the slavery which they would im∣pose upon me; for the reader must, by this time, be convinced, that in the short space of my theatrical direction, every method of insult and intimidation has been used to drive me to sacrifice our property, and the credit and interest of the theatre, to their partialities, and the caprice and vanity of Mrs. Lessingham; of which my submitting to take the part of Mrs. Sullen, in the Stratagem, from Mrs. Bulkley, in favour of
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
Mrs. Lessingham, is an instance of which I sorely repent, and for which I am still, to use one of their favourite figures, <HI>burning with shame.</HI> The case la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d before their counsel, as plainly appears from the references to it in the opinion, contained the same charges, supported by the same evidence, that are urged against us in their printed and manuscript li∣bels. Their Narratives, indeed, and the case submitted to counsel, are materially, and substantially, one and the same; first transmitted to counsel by a hackney-writer of one sort, and then dressed up for publick inspection by a hackney-writer of another.</P>
<P>Still, however, it is urged <HI>that the court of Chancery would decree a specifick performance of the articles.</HI> I do not doubt but it would. But give me leave to ask those gentlemen, and even their counsel, what is <HI>a specifick performance</HI> of the articles? Is it that I am not to carry on the ordinary business of the Theatre without previously submitting <HI>at all times,</HI> every minute particular to their consideration and controul? Is not the acting manager to appoint, or, from the contingencies of sickness or other accidents, to alter a play appointed for representation, without their previous concern? Is he not to cast the parts of a single play, be∣speak a single dress, or occasionally substitute Mrs. Bulkley for Miss Macklin, without sending at eight or nine o'clock in the evening to Mr. Rutherford in Newman-street, and to Mr. Harris in Surry-street? If this be <HI>a specifick performance,</HI> as the above letters construe it to be, it leaves the director less power than is commonly and necessarily lodged in the Prompter: and I cannot suppose that the wisdom and equity of the noblest court of judicature in the world will solemnly decree such <HI>a spe∣cifick performance,</HI> as the nature of the case renders impossible to be put in execution.</P>
<P>Granting, however, for argument sake, that the court would even decree <HI>a specifick performance</HI> of that sort, for which <HI>the narrators</HI> contend, give me leave to ask another question: Must not <HI>their negative power</HI> be always exercised in the <HI>first</HI> instance? and can they, after having openly or tacitly concurred in a measure, capriciously retract that concurrence? After having not only approved, but <HI>desired,</HI> the representation of Cym∣beline; after having consented to the expensive decoration of it; had they a right, not only on the eve of its representation, but even after the representation of it at the Command of Their Majesties, to prohibit the repetition of it? If this be, as they assert, their <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Printed Narrative, p. 30.</NOTE> <HI>indubitable right to a ne∣gative voice,</HI> by the same indubitable right they might restrain me from opening our doors; and after the lengths to which they have proceeded, I should not be at all surprized at their attempting to exercise their <HI>nega∣tive power</HI> in that manner.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="63"/>
But then <HI>the Court would order Mess. Colman and Powell to make satisfaction to Harris and Rutherford for their respective shares of all</HI> DAMAGES <HI>which should appear to have been sustained by any breach of those articles by them respectively.</HI> Undoubtedly; and it would be pleasant to be called on for <HI>damages</HI> in the present instance in any court of judicature. It is a cause worthy to come on before Trappolin. Make out a panel from the pit, and ask any twelve on the jury, what <HI>damages</HI> they think have arisen to Covent-Garden Theatre this season from the addition of Mr. and Mrs. Yates to the company? ask the Treasurer of the Theatre, what <HI>da∣mages</HI> have arisen from the representation of Cymbeline? ask the ward∣robe keepers, and other officers of the Theatre, what <HI>damages appear to have been sustained by any b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each of articles by Mess. Colman and Powell re∣spectively?</HI> If in all these instances, nothing but necessary expences, fairly brought to account, appear on one hand; if great <HI>benefit</HI> to the pro∣perty appears to have arisen on the other; alas! poor Powell, what will become of thee? alas! poor Colman, what will become of thee! <HI>Solventur risu tabulae: Tu missus abibis.</HI></P>
<P>The words <HI>effrontery</HI> and <HI>assuran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> are favourite terms in the polite vocabulary of Mess. Harris and Rutherford. They assert they <HI>verily be∣lieve</HI> they have incurred a loss of no less than 3500 <HI>l.</HI> by Colman's <HI>mis∣management.</HI> What does the world think of their <HI>modesty?</HI></P>
<P>To talk of <HI>damages</HI> is a very serious matter. Suppose, by a capricious display of their <HI>negative power,</HI> damages should arise; would not the other proprietors, would not every performer of the Theatre, if injured by such conduct, have a right to call judicially upon Mess. Harris and Rutherford to make good such damages?</P>
<P>As to the real intention of the restrictive clause in the article, and the declared object of it, at the time of its execution, it was merely to reserve a provisional power of restraint, which they then declared would probably not be exercised once in seven years, and very possibly would never be exercised at all. Nay, they avow themselves that they <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Printed Narrative, p. 3.</NOTE> <HI>enter∣tained no doubt of Mr. Colman's capacity or inclination to conduct the theatre to the best advantage;</HI> so that the negative clause was added, only lest any <HI>sinister accident might render their interposition necessary to the security of their property</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.<HI>—Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus—</HI>seems to have been the meaning of all parties. Has the <HI>dignus vindice nodus</HI> yet oc∣curred? And has any SINISTER ACCIDENT <HI>rendered their interposition ne∣cessary,</HI> except the representation of the character of Imogen by Mrs. Yates, instead of Mrs. Lessingham?</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="64"/>
The truth is, and they have confessed it, that the two <HI>gentlemen managers</HI> meant to avail themselves of the talents of William Powell <HI>the player,</HI> and George Colman <HI>the dramatick author.</HI> To this end they chearfully subscribed, although not indefinitely, to my abilities for the province of director; and Mr. Powell did not scruple to give up his share of the <HI>positive power,</HI> thinking it safely lodged in my hands. Still, however, they had secured to themselves a <HI>negative power,</HI> which, instead of reserv∣ing till the end of <HI>seven years,</HI> the reader has seen they not only exerted, but <HI>exceeded,</HI> before the end of <HI>seven days.</HI> The force of the restrictive clause is not questioned; and it is certain, that if they chuse to counteract their own interests for the sake of abridging my authority, they have frequent opportunities to embarrass me in the theatrical management. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed Narrative, p. 29.</NOTE> <HI>How comes it then,</HI> say they in triumph, <HI>that Mr. Colman,</HI> A GENTLE∣MAN BRED IN THE STUDY OF THE LAW, <HI>should enter into such absurd ar∣ticles?</HI> The history of the memorable visit with which I was honoured by Mr. Harris, on my return from Bath, is a full answer to their ques∣tion. There are quirks in morality, as well as quirks in the law; but I did not conceive that I was dealing with a petty-fogger in either.</P>
<P>As to my management of the theatre, of my merit or demerit in that particular, the Publick are the most competent judges; but it ill be∣comes my fellow-patentees to suggest matter of reproof on that subject to the person who is said to be their <HI>historiographer;</HI> and it ill becomes him to revile me for my <HI>gratuitous</HI> services, while he is said to be himself a candidate to represent us all four as a <HI>stipendiary</HI> manager. Mr. Spat∣ter, if it be Mr. Spatter, is "one of those wretches who <HI>miscall</HI> them∣selves authors; a fellow, whose heart, and tongue, and pen, are equally scandalous; who tries to insinuate himself every where, to make mis∣chief if there is none, and to increase it if he finds any." Mr. Ken∣rick, the ingenious author of the Widowed Wife, and of the candid and gentleman-like Review of Dr. Johnson's Shakespeare, has been pleased to pay me a very particular compliment in the prologue to his most excellent dramatick performance; and I will refer it to that gen∣tleman, unless perhaps he may be thought <HI>partial,</HI> whether Mr. Spat∣ter, or myself, is the fittest person to be employed in the direction of a theatre. Mr. Spatter perhaps may flatter himself with the hopes of ex∣pelling me from the management, and of seating himself, by the as∣sistance of his friends, in the vacant chair; but Mr. Spatter is mistaken. Let him, if he pleases, make rules for experimental philosophers in his trade of brass-rule-maker: let him make rules for authors in his pro∣fession of Monthly Reviewer; but never, while Mr. Powell and myself are concerned in the property, shall he <HI>openly</HI> make rules for the ma∣nagement of Covent Garden theatre.</P>

We are told, however, that <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mess. H. and R's Narr. p. 35.</NOTE> <HI>the proprietors of a theatre may avail themselves, not only of players, poets, &amp;c. but even of</HI> MANAGERS, <HI>if ne∣cessary, on paying them a valuable consideration.—</HI>Here the <HI>cloven foot</HI> ap∣pears: and to confirm this doctrine, it is observed, that <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Note to Ibid. p. 36.</NOTE> <HI>Mr. Colman's not stipulating for such a consideration, when he accepted of the</HI> NOMINAL DIRECTORSHIP <HI>of the theatre, is a corroborating proof that it was never intended he should take more trouble than Harris and Rutherford: as, had it been otherwise, he would certainly have been as much entitled to a salary for managing, as Mr. Powell was to his salary for acting.</HI> Here we cannot help observing in our turn, that the <HI>acting-manager,</HI> in the beginning of the Narrative, is reduced to the <HI>nominal director</HI> at the end. That I have as reasonable a claim to a salary for managing, as Mr. Powell for acting, is most certain; and indeed in some respects the claim is more reasonable, as the acting-manager incurs, in many instances, an unavoid∣able expence: but that <HI>it was never intended I should take more trouble than Harris and Rutherford,</HI> is false on the very face of the article. After their interpretation of Mr. Powell's article, I am not in the least surprized at their candid construction of the disinterestedness of mine; and the in∣sinuation of <HI>sinister views in my unrequested officiousness,</HI> is as true as it is generous. How far I was officious, or how far I was requested to take the office, is now before the Publick.</P>
<P>They are pleased to call <HI>the more than ordinary profits of the theatre this season, an imaginary circumstance.</HI> That the <HI>receipts</HI> of the theatre this season have been larger than ordinary, is NOT <HI>an imaginary circum∣stance,</HI> but <HI>a real fact:</HI> and if <HI>the disbursements</HI> have also been larger than ordinary, owing to our <HI>moderate efforts,</HI> as Mess. Harris and Ru∣therford are pleased to call them, to entertain the Publick, those gen∣tlemen ought to know, that the first expences of <HI>setting up in business</HI> are not to be calculated as the average expences of the current year. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 35.</NOTE> <HI>Sensible as they are of the disadvantages they lie under,</HI> Mess. Ruther∣ford and Harris do not, however, seem averse to enter into <HI>a compara∣tive view of the abilities of the respective patentees;</HI> and have employed the latter pages of their publication to convince the town of their error, in having been pleased to bestow so much <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 37.</NOTE> <HI>generous approbation on such mo∣derate entertainment, as they have received at Covent Garden Theatre this season.</HI> We hope, however, that our united efforts, <HI>moderate</HI> as Mess. Harris and Rutherford are pleased to call them, will still continue to be honoured with the GENEROUS APPROBATION OF THE PUBLICK. We flatter ourselves, that a fair comparison between the Narratives of Mess. Rutherford and Harris, and our own, will not inspire our patrons with
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>
any resentment of our proceedings. They may now judge, which TWO of the patentees have been <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Introduction, p. 4.</NOTE> <HI>in perfect collusion from first to last;</HI> which have been <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>very avaricious;</HI> and whether personal pique to Mrs. Les∣singham on my side, or personal attachment to Mrs. Lessingham on the part of Mess. Harris and Rutherford, has appeared in the <HI>rise</HI> and <HI>progress</HI> of our <HI>disputes.</HI> Her name, which is scarce distantly alluded to in their Narratives, makes a very conspicuous figure in our State of the Case; and might have been rendered still more capital. On the whole, if we shall not have appeared to have acted <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 5.</NOTE> <HI>in despite of honour and ho∣nesty,</HI> if we shall have appeared to have spared neither expence nor pains in our efforts to entertain, we hope still to be favoured with the prospe∣rous gale of the publick favour; and although it is not easy to keep the helm in such a boisterous sea, yet we hope, by <HI>plain sailing,</HI> to be able to run before the wind, and that the ship will live in a storm.</P>
<P>As to THEIR <HI>sincere desire of contributing to the publick entertainment,</HI> that cannot be questioned; not only as it is their immediate interest, but as they have so notoriously manifested that desire by their loud and vehe∣ment complaints of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>the heavy losses sustained by the engagement of Mrs. Yates, and the incredible expence of her dresses,</HI> as well as other theatrical decorations: not to mention their assignment of principal characters to Mrs. Lessingham, instead of Mrs. Yates.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mess. H. and R.
