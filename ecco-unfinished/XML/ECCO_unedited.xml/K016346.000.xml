<P>What shall I do, whither shall I run, the con∣tinued extravagance of my wife, has brought me to the brink of ruin, my house is beset, and I am myself ex∣posed to every disgrace, my only hope is, that the time allotted for my sojourn upon earth, is almost expired; life has never given me one real joy, and I shall yield it up again with remarkable satisfaction.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My horse was knocked up, and I was obliged to leave him in the wood—But I hav'n't a moment to spare, for the officers are close at my heels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are they so—why, who are these two ill∣looking fellows going down that hill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No less than the worthy gentry I have fled from, but as they probably return this way, only contrive some method to conceal me, and your fortune is made for ever.</P>

<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be your a highway-man.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, upon my honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce with your honour, I'll believe you full as well without it. Then perhaps you're some rich bankrupt, who has made over all his effects to himself, and would now make away with both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, on the contrary, I am a poor devil, not worth a doit, flying from his wife and creditors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're right there, for I know to my cost they're the worst company a man can get into, but you talk of securing my fortune, without having a single sixpence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That don't signify.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to be sure, you'll not be the first man who has provided for others, without having sense e∣nough to take care of himself.</P>

<P>I'll do better for you than giving money.</P>

<P>Aye! I know nothing better than that now a days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I'll grant you the accomplishment of the three first wishes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou shall form.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! are you a wizzard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am a devil. But don't be alarmed, I'm a very good kind of one, and will do you no harm. My name is Belphegor, commanded by Pluto to as∣sume the appearance of a mortal, and reside ten years upon earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>He might have spared himself the trouble, as we have devils enough in that shape already, but for what purpose was you sent hither?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>To prove whether the continual complaints of married men against their wives, were well founded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no occasion to stay ten years to be convinced of that, I fancy friend, your account will not be favourable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My disappointment shall not prejudice me a∣gainst the female world, as I am convinced there are many, who in ever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> respect do honour to human nature, alleviating by their tenderness, the woes of life, and by their smiles improving all their joys.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can I depend on you, who by your own account, don't come from the right place to be much credited; besides is it likely you can grant me three wishes, when you are not able to afford one for yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nevertheless, Pluto has given me the power of rewarding you, in the manner I have promised.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your devilship, will really supply me with whatsoever three things I chuse to desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be confident, and you shan't be disappointed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Begin then by climbing over that gate into my yard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shall I do there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why we are going to bake just now, and we can cram you into the oven at the same time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! that will be too hot.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not know you devils were afraid of bur∣ning.</P>

<P>In taking the figure of man, I have likewise all the feelings of one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you may throw yourself down the well, you will find that cold enough I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You fly from one extreme to another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Booze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it my fault you can neither bear heat nor cold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, I will hide myself in some part of your dwelling, be careful, if my pursuers should return, not to reveal me, and perhaps you may see me again when you stand in need of my advice, but remember, it will be your own fault if you are not a happy man.</P>
