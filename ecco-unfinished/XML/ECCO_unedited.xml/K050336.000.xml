<HEAD>A REPLY TO A PAMPHLET ENTITULED, The L—d <HI>H—sham</HI>'s Vindication of his SPEECH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Know nothing more Difficult, in Replying to the Defence of my Lord <HI>H—sham</HI>'s Speech, than to come at a Certainty, whether it be his Lordship's own Doing or Not. The Paper, which was formerly Call'd his Lordship's Speech, I Talk'd to, as not of his Lordship's Doing, and I am with much more Reason Enclin'd to Treat this the same way, tho' perhaps I may be Mistaken in both.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, I think my self oblig'd to Determine, in what Form to Treat of it, as the Foundation of my Discourse, and as the Ground of my Method; and whether I guess Right or Wrong, the Defence of the Manner lies upon the first Supposition; and therefore this Author when Charging me with Disregard to his Lordship's Quality in my Expressions, is pleas'd to forget, that I first suppos'd that Paper <HI>not to be his.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is it enough to say, I knew it to be his Lordship's Speech, for what ever by Common Fame, <HI>which 'tis own'd is a Common Lyer,</HI> might be suppds'd, it was for me in so Nice a Case, to take things not by their Suggested, but by their Apparent being, and as in the Sence of things, no Man could fair<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
say, it was his Lordships, it was so much the more justifiable to suppose it was not, and so it is here.</P>
<P>I know very well it was Expected, <HI>and perhaps by his Lordship,</HI> that I should have been Question'd, for the Freedom I took with that Paper, and Summon'd to Answer for it at the Bar of the House of Lords, but as that Honourable House understood better, so I am not Asham'd to say, I understood better than to Apprehend it; and, for this time, supposing my self speaking to my Lord I make the same Answer here, That <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad I been call'd up to speak to it,</HI> I should have given there, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, I know nothing of a Speech made in the House of Lords by your Lordiship, or any other Member of that House. Here is a Pam∣phlet Printed which I have spoken to, if there had been my Lord <HI>H—sham</HI>'s Name to it, I know my Duty to your Lordship's Quality better, than to have spoken to it in such Terms; or if it had been Printed, by Order of the House of Lords, I know the Duty of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Author better, than to meddle with any thing Transacted in that Honourab e House; but as I met with a Nameless Pamphlet, neither Publish'd by their Lordships Authority, nor Sign'd, or own'd by your Lordship, whose Title it bore, but coming openly into the World loose, and without a Parent of <HI>Imprimatur,</HI> and with exeeeding warmth, <HI>as I judg'd,</HI> Allarming the Nation; <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such</HI> I Treated it with that Freedom, that I thought it deserv'd; and that in the Nature of the thing, I was at Liberty to do.</P>
<P>Now, tho' I think this a sufficient Answer to the Charge, upon the Man∣ner or Language of the <HI>REVIEW,</HI> yet I shall in the Ensuing Sheats, farther justifie and Explain those Expressions, which his Lordship's, Vindicator Charges upon me as Indecent, <HI>for it is not my way, nor do I approve of Ill Language in Arguments, especially to Persons of his Lordship's Merit and Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>I Confess there are in this Paper, some strong Arguments against the O∣pinion, of its being Genuine. As 1<HI>st.</HI> The Language, very much below his Lordship, 2<HI>ly.</HI> want of Truth in Fact, 3<HI>ly.</HI> Meanness of Arguing. And, 4<HI>ly.</HI> Inequality of Subject, all which shock me very much, when I would take this Pa∣per to be my Lord <HI>H—sham</HI>'s, my Respect for his Lorship, not per∣mitting me to think, his Lordship could take such low steps to come out of a Mistake.</P>
<P>I know there are some Passions, which when Men are mov'd by, they remove them at some Distance from their Wisdom, and Hurry them into strange Excesses, which their Discretion can by no means Account for; a∣mong these, I know none affect the Mind so much, as Envy and Party-Strife; and nothing is so low, but these things will bend the Man to, in hopes ei∣ther of Answering his own Ends, or Defeating his Opositites.</P>
<P>But whoever be the Author of this Paper, I shall let the World see, that whatever Disrespect Men may think, I show'd to an Anonymous Pamphlet; I know how to behaveto a Member of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, and I shall neither for∣get
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
his Lordship's Dignity, NOR WHO GAVE IT HIM; and it am forc'd to any plainness, his Lordship may think Indecent, it will be none but what Truth will Extort from me, TO WHICH, <HI>what ever his Lordship's Vindicator has thought fit to do,</HI> I think my self Bound to a strict Obedience.</P>
<P>I Confess, I think the Vindicator does the Author of the <HI>Review</HI> too much Honour, Thus to measure his Pen with him, and at the same time to give him such Manifest Advantages in point of Fact, and length of Argument; and the Author gives the Vindicator his most Humble Thanks, that he is pleasd to Descend to the Class of this <HI>mean thing</HI> the <HI>Review,</HI> and with him Appeal to the Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, who this Author most willingly Consents to make Judges in the Case.</P>
<P>And as, in all Cafes, he hopes his Lordship will Grant him full Freedom of Speech, and think it below him to Concern himself or the Peerage of <HI>Eng∣gland,</HI> in an Answe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Pamphlet, which has not his Lordship's Name to it; so he assures his Lordship, he will Endeavour to give him Occasion, to think the Statute of <HI>Sean Magnatum</HI> useless in this Case.</P>
<P>In Order to this, the Author of the <HI>Review</HI> passes over at once, all the Ill Language, the Vindicator is pleas'd to bestow upon him, as things, which however in his Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom he may not think below him to stoop to, the Author thinks it below his Breeding to return, and cannot think they Illustrate the Vindicator's Arguments enough, to Encourage him to follow the Example, having moreover, so much more Truth and Reason of his side, as to stand in no need of Railing to help themout.</P>
<P>The two first Paragraphs of this Pamphlet, seem to stand one against a∣nother a little, and I ask the Author's Pardon to reconcile them, to which End I must take the Freedom to repeat them—as follows,</P>
<P>THE Insults and Scandalous Reflections that have been made upon me in several late <HI>Reviews,</HI> tho' they are beyond all Precedent, <Q>yet should “”have been without any Notice, <HI>had the Author of these Papers been the only Person concern'd in them:</HI> but being convinc'd upon Enquiry, from whence he had both his <HI>Encouragement and Instructions,</HI> and being un∣willing to be thought guilty by default, or that Silence on my part should go for Confession, or Railing on his part go for Rea∣son, I choose rather to Appeal from the Malicious Insinuations and false Suggestions of those Papers, to the Candid and Impartial Judg∣ment of every unbiass'd Reader, <HI>than take those Advantages which his Rashness and Impudence,</HI></Q> <HI>perhaps, have given me.</HI></P>
<P><Q>“”I would not have it thought, I am entering the Lists with such a MEAN AND MERCENARY PROSTITUTE as the Au∣thor of the <HI>Review:</HI> I know better the Regard due to the Peerage of <HI>England (tho' some have forgot it)</HI> than to lessen either That or my∣self
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
to such a Degree. But when a Person, my Equal (excepting a few Accidental Ornaments and Advantages which I do not pre∣tend to) <HI>who never yet would give me any Answer elsewhere, tho' more than once provok'd to it,</HI> has betaken himself to such unusual and unbeco∣ming Methods; 'tis but Justice to my self to let him see, that as I Court no Man's Favour, so I do not fear any Man's Power so much as to desert my own just Desence in a Compliment.</Q></P>
<P>The first of these, is wholly upon the Poor Author of the <HI>Review,</HI> and any one I believe would imagine his Lordship'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vindicator was entring the Lists, with this <HI>Mean and Mercenary Prostitute,</HI> as the Vindicator is pleas'd to Call him; and therefore he finds it absolutely necessary to open their Eyes, by adding the Second Paragraph, to let a Certain Person of Honour know, that <HI>somebody</HI> having try'd a great many ways before to Provoke him to a Resentment, <HI>which he never thought worth his while,</HI> he was Resolv'd to try this of Pam∣phletering, and so the Poor <HI>Review</HI> comes in but by the by, like a Man that beats a Dog, nor for any Spleen at the Poor Cur, but to Provoke his Master.</P>
<P>In which also, he chances to be in the Unhappy Mistake, that he falls foul on another Man's Dog instead of his Enemies; and THIS CUR takes it so Unkindly, that he tells him of it again as well as he can, in hopes to Convince him of his Error.</P>
<P>But to come to Particulars; The Vindicator offers here, <HI>1st.</HI> That <HI>the Author of these Papers, is not the only Person Concern'd in them.</HI> And, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <HI>He is Convinc'd</HI> upon Enquiry, <HI>from whence he has both his Encouragement and Infiructions,</HI> and on the Foot of these Suggestions, I suppose he can justifie the Terms afterwards bestow'd on this Author, of <HI>Mean, Mercenary,</HI> and <HI>Presti∣stitute.</HI></P>
<P>I most Humbly ask his Pardon for saying, <HI>Necessity forcing me to it in Vin∣dication of Truth,</HI> to his Misfortune and MINE TOO, not one Word of these Articles happens to have the least Shadow OF TRUTH in them.</P>
<P>That no Man in <HI>England</HI> has, or ever had any Concern, in Writing the Paper Call'd the <HI>Review,</HI> other than the Author, known and Reputed to be so, I take the Liberty to assure him, is a certain, positive, Literal, and Di∣rect Truth, and that not so much as Subject, Manner, Time of Subject, or any part of, in, or belonging to it, has been ever Dictated, Suggested, be∣spoke, or desir'd, or any other way, directly or indirectly, so much as hin∣ted, or mov'd to him, by any Person whatsoever.</P>
<P>And my Certainty of the Truth of this makes it plain, his Lordship can∣not be the Author of this Paper; a Person of his Lordship's Dignity, Ve∣racity and Judgment, would never run the Risque of advancing such a thing, for which I am very well assur'd, his Grounds must be so weak and uncer∣tain, and which must return upon his Character with so much Disadvan∣tage.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
The next thing advanc'd in this Vindication is, that he is Convinc'd up∣on Enquiry, from whence I have both my Encouragement and Instructions, I confess I could be very well pleas'd if some of this <HI>were True;</HI> and that I had either Encouragement or Instructions from any body, in my Resolute pursuit of Truth and Peace; but, <HI>to my Misfortune,</HI> the Fact of this is wrong too; upon what Enquiry the Vindicator may be Convinc'd, I confess I can∣not determine; I know light Information will satisfie some People of what they would have true; but I must beg his Pardon to say, that certainly his Informer must be an Impostor, and I should esteem it a piece of Justice, that I should always acknowledge, if his Lordship or his Vindicator would Vouschsafe to Confront that Evidence, either with me or any other Person, by or from whom, this Encouragement, and these Instructions have been receiv'd, and when, or in what manner given; for certainly when both were brought to the Light, he would be convinc'd he was impos'd upon, and resent it accordingly.</P>
<P>If I were to run through the <HI>Black Lists,</HI> of the <HI>Encouragements</HI> I have met with in the World, while I have Embark'd my self in the <HI>Raging Sea</HI> of the Nations Troubles, this Vindicator would be asham'd to call them En∣couragements; how in pursuit of <HI>Peace,</HI> I have brought my self into innu∣merable <HI>Broils;</HI> how many Exasperated by the <HI>sting of Truth</HI> have vow'd my Destruction; and <HI>how many ways attempted it:</HI> how I stand alone in the World, abandon'd by those very People that own I have <HI>done them Service;</HI> how I am Sold and Bettay'd <HI>by Friends,</HI> Abused and Cheated by Barbarous and <HI>Ʋnnatural Relations,</HI> su'd for <HI>other Mens</HI> Debts, and strip'd Naked by Publick Injustice, of what should have Enabl'd me to <HI>pay my own;</HI> How, with a Numerous Family, and no helps but my own Industry, I have forc'd my way with undiscourag'd Diligence, thro' a Sea of Debt and Misfor∣tune, and reduc'd them Exclusive of Composition from 17000 <HI>l.</HI> to less than 5; how in Gaols, in Retreats, in all manner of Extremeties, I have suppor∣ted my self without the Assistance of Friends, or Relations, either to me or mine; how I still Live without this Vindicator's suggested Methods, and am so far from making my Fortune by this way <HI>of Scribling,</HI> that no Man more desires a Limitation and Regulation of <HI>the Press,</HI> than my self▪ especially that <HI>Speeches in Parliament</HI> might not be Printed <HI>without Order</HI> of Parliament, and poor Authors Betray'd, to Engage with Men too power∣ful for them, in more forcible Arguments than those of Reason; if I should still acquaint him, that whatever he suggests, I shall never starve, tho' this way of Encouragement were remov'd; and that, were the Trade with <HI>Spain</HI> open, I shall Convince the World of it, by settling my self Abroad, where I shall receive better Treatment from both Friend and Enemy than I have here.</P>
<P>These Melancholy Truths, tho' I confess my self full of them, I omit Troubling the World with, only to assure this Vindicator, that the Encouragements suggested to be receiv'd, for the Writing against the Printed Paper, Call'd a Speech, are meer Fictions of some Persons, who
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Court some Men's Favour at the Expence of their own Honesty, and de∣serve their Resentment, for imposing upon them.</P>
<P>But then we come to Instructions, and I confess my self to have receiv'd some Instructions in my Answer, from a very Noble Person, and to whom, I shall always pay a due Acknowledgment for the same; and this Noble Per∣son, let him be who he will, is no body but the Author of that Pamphlet. Entitl'd, my Lord <HI>H—sham</HI>'s Speech.</P>
<P>The Instructions there given, are so plain, so easie, so frequent, and so urgent, that I confess my self press'd by Invincible Necessity to answer for when the <HI>Fact</HI> appear'd so <HI>plain,</HI> the <HI>Suggestions</HI> so <HI>naked,</HI> and <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> singular,</HI> who could refrain himself from speaking? I am therefore accoun∣table for nothing but the Truth of what I have said; and in that I am ready to embrace the worst Consequences, having been <HI>once ruin'd</HI> for speaking Truth, and <HI>not afraid still</HI> to defend it to the last Extremities.</P>
<P>The last of the Three Articles which the Vindication advances, I take to have some Passion in them; but as they touch, that only Reputation the Fury of Men has left me, I must ask Leave to say a Word or two in my just Defence; and tho' the Case be too personal, yet the tedious Vindication of his Lordship's Person, is my Precedent.</P>
<P><HI>Mean, Mercenary,</HI> and <HI>Prostitute.</HI> These are the Titles his Lordship's Vindicator bestows upon me.</P>
<P>To the first; Meaner, my Lord, in my own Eyes than in any Man's; and willing to be as mean as Man can make me, for the Service of my Native Country, and the Defence of Truth, Peace, and the Liberty of <HI>England.</HI> But without entring into the Determination of what is or is not to be un∣derstood by Honour, I ask his Lordship's Pardon on this Occasion, only to value my self without Pride or Affectation in a manner I never did before. I had the Honour to be Trusted, Esteem'd, and much more than I deserv'd, valued by the best King, <HI>England</HI> ever saw; and yet whose Judgment I cannot undervalue, because he gave his Lordship his Honour and his Dignity, which was sometime before as mean as M ... But Fate, that makes Footballs of Men, kicks some up Stairs and some down; some are advanc'd without Ho∣nou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, others suppress d without Infamy; some are raised without Merit, some are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tush'd without Crime; and no Man knows by the Beginning of things, whe∣ther his Course shall issue in a <HI>PEERAGE</HI> or a <HI>PILLORY;</HI> and time was, that no Man could have determin'd it between his Lordship and this mean Fellow, except those that knew his Lordship's Merit more particularly than Out-sides could have directed. In the Grave we shall come to a Second and more ex∣act Equality; and what Difference follows next, will be form'd on no Foot of Advantage from Dignity or Character here; so that this mean Fellow has less Disparity to struggle with, than the Usage of him seems to allow.</P>
<P>But to return to the Days of King <HI>William,</HI> and to Matters of Honour—If I should say I had the Honour to know some things from his Ma∣jesty, and to transact some things for his Majesty, that he would not have tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lordship with, perhaps there may be more Truth than Modesty in
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
it; and if I should say also, these Honours done me, help'd to make me that mean thing, some People since think fit to represent me, perhaps it should be very true also.</P>
<P>Thus much for Meanness, the Charge of which, I thank Heaven is no Crime. A Man ought not to be afraid at any time to be mean, to be honest; Pardon me therefore, with some Warmth to say, That neither the Vindicator, nor all his In∣formers, can with their utmost Inquiry make it appear, that I am, or ever was <HI>Mercenary;</HI> and as there is a Justice due from all Men, of what Dignity or Quality soever, to one another, the wrong done me in this, can be Vindica∣ted by nothing, but proving the Fact; which I am a most Humble Petitio∣ner, that he would be pleas'd to do, or else to give me leave to speak of it in such Terms, as so great an Injury demands</P>
<P>Here I Appeal from the Pamphlet, Publish'd in his Lordship's Name, of which I cannot be sure, whether it be his Lordship's or no; to that Noble Personage, My Lord <HI>H—s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am</HI> who I am applying to, and to that Ho∣nour, which by his Peerage is accepted instead of an Oath, even in matters of Life, whether his Lorrdship can fairly Charge me with one Action in my Life, that can Entitle me to that Scandalous Appellation of a <HI>Mercenary.</HI></P>
<P>No, my Lord, <HI>Pardon my Freedom,</HI> I Contemn and Abhor every thing, and every Man that can be Tax'd with that Name, let his Dig∣nity be what it will; I was ever True to one Principle, I never Betray'd my Master or my Friend; I always Espous'd the cause of Truth and Liberty, was ever on one side, <HI>and that Side was ever right;</HI> I have Liv'd to be Ruin'd for it, and I have Liv'd to see it Triumph over Tyrranny, Party-Rage, and Persecution Principles, <HI>and am sorry to see any Man Abandon it.</HI></P>
<P>I thank God, this World cannot bid a Price sufficient to Bribe me; I confess, if I were of that Religion, in which I should think I could Merit Heaven by being a Villain, I know not what I might be prevail'd up∣on to do, in hopes of such Advantage; but for this World, 'tis the Principle I ever liv'd by, and shall espouse whilst I live, That a Man ought to Dye, rather than betray his Friend, his Cause, or his Master; I appeal to your Lord∣ship's Honour, whether I merit the Scandalous Title of a <HI>Mercenary,</HI> which your Vindicator has Injuriously bestow'd upon me.</P>
<P>I own I am a at loss to know, or indeed to guess what should move this Author, while at the same time he is pleas'd to blame my Language, to fall into this Meanness himself, and Attack me with a Missive Weapon, which will flye back, and do him more Injury than it can do me.</P>
<P>I confess, I have been too long in my own Vindication, and perhaps the Reader may be tyr'd with it, but I Appeal to the occasion, to prove the Necessity to it; to be Call'd <HI>Prostitute, Hackney, Tool, Foul Mouth Mungrel,</HI> with a Charm and Protection, that Writes for Bread, and Lives by Defama∣tion; Insolent Scribler, a Scandalous Pen, Rash, Impudent, and the like; all these move me not at all, and only help'd me to judge, that it was im∣possible this Noble Lord could be the Author of it, the Language is so Gross;
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
but to be withall Tax'd with being <HI>Mercenary,</HI> which I am sure this Vindi∣cator cannot make out, I thought my self oblig'd to defend my self from that Scandal, and I hope all that have any Respect to Truth, will bear with it.</P>
<P>I come next to the Terms fixt upon in the <HI>Review,</HI> as the Subject, the Vin∣dicator Complains of as Abusive; but considering his return in kind, 'tis strange he should object against Railing: Before I enter upon them, I must Com∣plain of some Injustice in the Collection of them, being put together with∣out the Coherence of their Circumstances, and most of them very well to be justifi'd, when Explain'd by the <HI>Addenda</HI> that stand by them—See the Pa∣ragraph.</P>
<Q>“I begin with the <HI>Reflections made upon my Person;</HI> and here it looks very unaccountable, how one that has pretended to <HI>so great Modera∣tion,</HI> as the Author of the <HI>Review;</HI> should be carried so much above his <HI>avow'd Principle, in a Matter he is so very little concern'd in.</HI> It must certainly be the force of some <HI>irresistible Temptation,</HI> or the Oc∣cult Quality, and malign Influence of some <HI>Ruling Star,</HI> that war∣med and transported this <HI>State-Mountebank,</HI> when he Wrote those Pa∣pers, to such a degree above his pretended Moderation. Temper, as to characterize a person he had not the least knowledge of, with as black marks of Infamy as he could invent, or durst venture upon: <HI>as if for speaking my Mind with the Duty of a Subject and the freedom of an</HI> Englishman, I became every thing that was not <HI>Scandalum Magnatum.”</HI></Q>
<P>What a Monster has one Speech made me, <HI>he says?</HI> 'tis calculated and screw'd up to a pitch of Malecontent and Chagin; as if done on purpose to sour the Nation, and printed with an unpeaceable and mischievous meaning; to be design'd to keep alive a Malecontent Party; by a Mouth bent to Noise and Reflection; by a person malign to the Settlement, in hopes to raise grounds of Clamour; and as one who has a great many ill Ends; that it was spoke with Freedom that consists not <HI>any where</HI> with Duty, Allegiance, Truth, Sense or Respect; with Expectation to force a Fortune by railing at his Betters, reviling the Ruler of the People, accusing the Innocent, to please and court a Party; spoken like <HI>Solomon</HI>'s fool with his Eyes in the Ends of the Earth; proposing what is ridiculous and incongruous; calculated to revive the beats and dying Quarrels in the Nation, and encourage the follies that Madmen make use of to ruin the Country in such Cases; by a person, whose fancied Reputation to them that did not know he had—it, might serve to push on the spe∣cious Sham to an Extremity, and to byass honest ignorant people in his fa∣vour, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As to my Moderation, I shall speak to it by it self; and it will best appear, when I shall show what I have not said, that Persons and things would bear, and compare it with what I have said, and the Reasons of both.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
My Lord <HI>H—sham</HI> must Excuse me still, if I am not to be drawn in, to Examine a Speech <HI>as such,</HI> and as spoken in the House of Lords, and Treat it still as a Pamphlet—And as such, I would Humbly Entreat <HI>this Vindicator,</HI> to distinguish my Observations <HI>on the speaking it, from my Obser∣vations on the Printing of it</HI>—And as the latter I cannot yet Repent of the Terms objected against, for in all this Vindication I do not see one reason offer'd, or the least attempt to Vindicate the Printing of it, and Publishing it, by the Common Hawkers of Pamphlets, without the leave of the House; spreading is as an Appeal to the People, <Q>and this I cannot but think still is “”Screw'd up to a pitch of Malecontent and Chagrin, has an Unpeaceable and Mischievous Meaning,</Q> and seems to be design'd to keep alive a Male∣content Party, by Noise and Reflection &amp;c. Nor can I think I have need of any <HI>Charm</HI> or <HI>Protection</HI> for these Freedoms, which the Vindicator most Unju∣stly Charges me with.</P>
<P>The next thing he Presents us with, is a Panegyrick upon the former Behaviour of my Lord <HI>H</HI>—in the Publick Affairs; in which, to do his Lordship Right, I join with him, and am heartily Concern'd he has thought fit to alter his Conduct.</P>
<P><Q>“”What a number of unaccountables (as he calls them) are here! whence could he furnish himself with such an Expence of Scandal, or rake together such a Load of Infamy? <HI>But no men charge so furiously as that are in</HI> Compact, <HI>and think themselves shot-free, by having their</HI> Charm and Protection about them. Being then thus unjustly attacked, not so much by <HI>this Hackney Tool,</HI> whom I despise, as in a M—in mascarade, I am compelled to say those things for my self, which without such provocation, would look vain and boasting.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”This <HI>Scandalous Author</HI> (or who ever bid them say so when he tells the world that I have—my Reputation, would have done well to have prov'd it by Instance. I have had the honour to have <HI>been Employ'd in some publick Station, and entrusted by some of the Chief of his Party, at a time when they thought themselves in no small danger, and when there was not so good an understanding between us:</HI> I appeal to the Head of them, <HI>whether, at his</HI> earnest Desire, <HI>I did not act the Gen∣tleman-part and serve him faithfully:</HI> And tho' afterwards I had the mis∣fortune to fall under the <HI>Displeasure of a House of a Commons, 'tis as well known as they are, it was for interposing between them and Danger, for too vigorously espousing their Cause:</HI> And could never have imagined the same way of Proceeding in falling upon some and leaving others who were equally concerned in the same facts (which I always did and ever shall think very partial) should be lookt upon as unjust when it was some men's own Case, and quite otherwise when it was the Case of the <HI>E—of</HI> N—<HI>m in the business of the</HI> Sc—h P—t It was my differing from some men in this affairs that I believe was my original Sin; which is <HI>never to be forgiven, because it never will be</HI>

<P>I know there are Persons in the World, that differ from me in their No∣tions of our Circumstantial Obligation as to <HI>cotland, and by this his Lordship's</HI> Vindicator <HI>will easily judge, that I am not instructed in what I am upon;</HI> but I must ever defend this as a Truth, against all the World, That our being Su∣periour to <HI>Scotland</HI> in Power, does not singly give us a Title to suppress them; and that a Law to force them to declare the Succession of their Crown with Ours, <HI>Only because we think we can do it,</HI> has no Maxim of State in it, but what will justifie the <HI>French</HI> King in all those Invasions of the Liberties of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and Rights of his Neighbours, for which we think fit to declare War against him</P>

to advise Her Majesty to abridge the <HI>Scots</HI> of their Liberties, in Order to support our Influence over them.</P>
<P>The Justice of Goverment, has no manner of Dependence upon the Power of it, and our being superior to the <HI>Scots</HI> in Strength, tho' that Presumption once cost the Lives of 30000 <HI>English</HI> Men, is far from being a Reason, why they should not have an Act of Security, nor why the Queen should not pass it; and to have advised Her Majesty against it, had been indeed to show the Politician, but to conceal the honest Man.</P>
<P>We all know the Drift of these Men, tho' 'tis some Subject of Wonder to see this Noble Person fall in with it; we see plainly enough the Design of the Party was to have forc'd these Nations upon a War; and the first Pro∣ject was, if possible, to provoke and exasperate the <HI>Scots,</HI> so as to make them Aggressors; but when they found the <HI>Scots</HI> had no fools about them, rather than fail, they will push the <HI>English</HI> Nation upon it, by making Laws to fall upon the <HI>Scots</HI> first; and the weak Pretence of this, must be their Trading with <HI>France,</HI> which at the same time we agree to in our Neighbours, <HI>Practice our selves as to</HI> Spain, where we see it our Interest, and should do so to <HI>France</HI> also, if we did not stand in our own Light.</P>
<P>To provide for their own Safety, the <HI>Scots</HI> make Acts of Security, and her Majesty passes them; and these Gentlemen accuse those that advise the Queen to do it, of being false to <HI>England.</HI> The Question is short, was her Majesty, as Queen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> oblig'd in Honour, and by Oath, to do every thing for the Good and Safety of her Subjects of that Kingdom or no? If in the Negative, <HI>let me desire those Gentlemen that say so,</HI> to read the Declaration of Right, on the Foot of which the <HI>Scots</HI> settled their Crown on her present Majesty, then Princess, and on which her Majesty entred upon the Royal Ad∣ministration; and then answer again, <HI>if in the Affirmative,</HI> where was the Error of advising her Majesty to do that which by her Oath, by the <HI>Postu∣lata</HI> of Government, by her Duty, as the Royal Parent of her People, her Majesty lay under Indispensible Obligations to do?</P>
<P>But as these things tended to prevent the Design of embroiling the Nations, and setting on foot a High Church War, so it thwarted the Measures of those times. I could reveal some more Truths on this Head, that would clear up this Matter, but 'tis enough; her Majesty has taken the Steps of Prudence and Moderation with <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as with <HI>England,</HI> has defeated the Projects of those that push'd at a National Inflammation; that Union so long apprehended, and so diligently struggled against by the Party here, to me seems in View. The Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> has thought fit to rescind the Act which laid a Foundation of a Certain Rupture, and <HI>Peace</HI> the abhorr'd Article that <HI>obstructs the Party,</HI> begins to extend it self <HI>Northward,</HI> from whence they hoped for those Distractions, which they could wish for from no Prin∣ciple but what was destructive to the present Settlement both in Church and State.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
This is but a little of what might be said on this Subject, but may serve to let the Reader into the Secret of all this Business, and to open their Under∣standings who were at a Loss to know why some People were so angry, that the Queen pass'd such Laws in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and suffered the <HI>Scots</HI> to make Pro∣visions for themselves.</P>
<P>Nor can it be useless to note, That abundance of Ignorant People were re∣ally prejudic'd with these things, and thought her Majesty had done hardly by <HI>England,</HI> and that they that advised those things, ought to be hang'd, that the <HI>Scots</HI> were bound to do as we bid them, That our King or Queen must be theirs. These People had forgot, or did not understand the Indepen∣dency of the two Kingdoms; and it begun to be the Word all over <HI>England,</HI> That if the <HI>Scots</HI> would not settle the Crown as we would have them, <HI>we must make them,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>These ignorant Notions serv'd very well to assist in their Kind, to the De∣sign; and tho' those Gentlemen at the Helm of this Matter knew better, yet it favour'd of the same thing, to reproach those Ministers of State with a Crime, in Advising the Queen to do that in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which, in Justice, Her Ma∣jesty could not deny; as if the Queen and Her Council, were to act with <HI>Scotland</HI> purely with a Respect to the Interest of <HI>England</HI> separately consider'd, and not the Right of the two Nations, or Her Majesty's indispensable Obliga∣tions, as Queen of both.</P>
<P>If any Minister of State shifted off his Acting thus, as this Paper offers at, it is Matter of Wonder to me, since whoever he be, he can have no better Inscription written on his Monument than, <HI>That for the Honour of</HI> England, <HI>he scorn'd to Advise Her Majesty, against Discharging the Character and Debt of a Just Princess to Her Subjects of</HI> Scotland, <HI>tho' against our seeming Interest.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, the Interest of Kingdoms ought to be consider'd by Statesmen, and a Wise Prince always studies the Good of his People, but Justice must never bow to Interest; we may be wise, but we must be honest; and the whole is to be defended both ways, of which I could say a great deal more, if the Shortness of this Discourse would permit.</P>
<P>I could enlarge here on the Beginnings of this Clamour against the <HI>Scots,</HI> by whom rais'd, and by whom handed on, to such Fatal Extremes; but as that would run me back to <HI>Another Noble Speech,</HI> and embroil me again with Persons as well as Things, I omit it here; only take the Liberty to say, there were more Passions than those of Fear concern'd, in our being so much alarm'd at the <HI>Scots</HI> making an Act for their own Security, if not, some other Mea∣sures <HI>to provoke them farther,</HI> would never have been the Consequences; for People really apprehensive of Danger, never study to make it greater, at least, if they are in their Senses.</P>
<P>But this cannot but be noted, that as the first Seeds of this National Dis∣content are found taking Root in the very Center of their Religious Settlement, and the Quarrel was fairly driving to a Head between Prelacy and Presbytery, 'tis something unaccountable, to see some People espousing it, who were al∣ways
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
esteem'd to favour the latter, and from whom other Things were always expected.</P>
<P>But these Things are no stranger, than to hear Arguments from another Hand, for Acquainting the Successor with our <HI>English</HI> Prelates;—a Thing, had it happen'd at another Time, would have gone farther towards Confirming the Opinion of our <HI>Bishops being turn'd Presbyterians,</HI> than all the Clamour of the High Church could do for two Years past.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> a Generous Nation, scorn'd to subdue their very Enemies upon Dishonourable Terms; and therefore, when some of their Citizens offer'd to betray them, sent them back to be punish'd by their Masters; <HI>Scot∣land</HI> is not so considerable a Nation, that we should be afraid to do them Ju∣stice; nor so inconsiderable a Nation, that we should presume to do them In∣jury; the Governments are distinct and independent, the Queen acts in a double Cpacity with Respect to the Administration, and is oblig'd to regard Justice to both without Byass, or private Respect; <HI>the</HI> Scots <HI>are not Govern'd by Our Queen, but we are Govern'd by theirs;</HI> and let the Disparity of Nations be what it will, Justice is the Foundation, and the respective Constitutions are the respective Modes of the Government of either.</P>
<P>But I cannot dwell upon this Subject here, and therefore shall make amends for this Brevity in another Place.</P>
<P>This Clause Ends with Gall and Bitterness at the Author of the <HI>Review;</HI> and 'tis the Vindicator's Wonder, <HI>Anglice</HI> Disappointment, that he is not sent <HI>some where,</HI> &amp;c. for saying, That Printing Reflections on Her Majesty, Free∣dom of Speech, (when at the same time the Reflector demanded all Freedom the same way) was inconsistent with Duty, Allegiance, Truth, Sense, or Respect: And of this I must say, as the Vindication in another Case, 'Tis a Sin I can never repent of, at least till farther Convinc'd of its being Criminal, than by the following Head.</P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>These might have been tolerable Grounds to have justified the Pamphleteer's Reflections.</HI> But to speak inconsistently with Duty, Al∣legiance, Truth, Sense, or Respect, before such a Presence, and not be in the Tower; <HI>and if I did not, that the Pamphleteer should not be some where else,</HI> may seem as-strange too, as the Railing at my Betters, and Reviling my Ruler, would be to force a Fortune, by Courting a Party, who at present are so far from having it in their power to oblige any Body by their Interest, that 'tis look'd upon by some as a Crime, to have the Ho∣nour of so much as the least Acquaintance with them. <HI>But this Author, who</HI> writes for Bread, <HI>and</HI> lives by Defamation, <HI>thinks those, I perceive, who are known to be under no Inducement of Necessity, govern themselves by</HI> his base and mereenary Principles.</Q></P>

I allow, unless his Lordship will Abate the Extent of his Power, I have not room to Debate with him on the Merits of this Cause; but I humbly offer, that if the Vindicator will intercede with his Lordship, to wave those, <HI>as I think <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>bitant</HI> Advantages, that I may freely speak Truth, I will prove it inconsistent, &amp;c. as be∣fore, to his Lordships Satisfaction, or publickly ask his Pardon: Why his Lordship was not sent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> is nothing to me, any more than why I am not <HI>some where else,</HI> is to the Vindicator, since I cannot see that I gave any Offence to Justice in what I offer'd.</P>
<P>Come we next to the Vindicator's Defence of the Proposal, about the Presumptive Heir being sent for Over; as follows,</P>
<P><Q>“”'Tis very wonderful, after all, <HI>that a Proposal for Inviting Over the Presumptive Heir to the Crown,</HI> should expose a Man to all this virulent Fury: That a Person only for mentioning it, should be called by the Names of Mr. <HI>Politicus, Speaking Trumpet, Grating Sam,</HI> &amp;c. Whoever have read <HI>Great</HI> Britain<HI>'s Ʋnion, and the Secu∣rity of the</HI> Hannover Succession <HI>considered,</HI> will find that Matter was thought on many Months before the Paper, called <HI>Mercu∣rius Politicus</HI> ever appear'd. And tho' the Reviewer is very free in calling this a Ridiculous proposal, incongruous and inconsist∣ent with the General Good; yet, perhaps this very Person would not have been so very confident, had he seen (as I have) <HI>the Extract of the Princess</HI> Sophia<HI>'s Answer,</HI> dated <HI>November</HI> 3. 1705▪ to the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>'s Letter; in which are these Words, <HI>viz.</HI> I am <HI>ready and willing to comply with whatever can be desired of me by my Friends, in case that the Parliament think that it is for the good of the Kingdom to invite me into</HI> England. Some Men reading this, I doubt not, will think again. If we only considered <HI>what that</HI> Proposal <HI>has produc'd,</HI> it might deserve (one would think) better Language. We have had several Acts of Parliament relating to the Security of the Succession <HI>look'd into since,</HI> and <HI>their Defects cured;</HI> by which it appears, that the Suc∣cession was not so safe as was generally imagined: <HI>A Bill for Na∣turalizing the</HI> Princess Sophia <HI>and her Issue,</HI> and another to <HI>Estab∣lish a Regency (in case of the Queen's Demise)</HI> sent down to the House of Commons, which those that framed and consented to, thought no doubt, a <HI>Security to the Succession:</HI> And yet there was no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> least Appearance of the <HI>Succession's being so much as thought</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> when t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Proposal <HI>was made:</HI> So that not to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Consideration, how far these Expedients will be a
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
Security, if they prove, as they are thought Great Ones; <HI>he thar gave the Occasion and Rise to them,</HI> sure, only for that, cannot deserve to be thus treated.</Q></P>
<P>Strange! that Anger should so blind Men of Judgment and Sense, that they cannot see so far then, as at another time. Now, that the Reader may not Entertain such General Prejudice without Reason, as is here intimated, I appeal to the <HI>Review,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 113. <HI>P.</HI> 450. <HI>Col.</HI> 2. <Q>“”I know this Article has been started in Print be∣fore now, by an Author, whose Principle is as well known as his Paper; and as his Proposal I shall speak to it.—Now Mr. <HI>Politicus,</HI></Q> as this Author would be call'd, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine, my Lord <HI>Haversham</HI> can suppose I could Treat him so, or that he can be spoken to here, and wonder the Vindicator should suppose it for him: 1<HI>st.</HI> Because he is expresly told, that he is not. 2<HI>dly.</HI> 'Tis expressly pointed at, who is spoken to. 3<HI>dly.</HI> No Body but he, that is resolv'd to mistake, can be so mistaken, the Author of <HI>Mercurius Politicus</HI> having publickly Debated this Point; nor does it argue his Lordship must be meant, because another Paper mentioned it before <HI>Mercurius Politicus:</HI> No, tho' his Lordship had been Author of that Paper, because 'tis here directly told, <HI>who I speak to, and who not.</HI></P>
<P>But here comes a Strong Argument, to plead for better Treat∣ment; That since starting this Proposal, produc'd more Acts of Se∣curity it had that way a good Effect; and on that Account, deserv'd better Treatment. I must ask the Vindicator's Pardon, to make an Allusion or two here. K. <HI>James</HI>'s Male-Administration produc'd the Revolution, the Declaration of the Rights and Li∣berties of the People, and Abundance of good Laws to secure Pro∣perty, Religion, Protestant Succession, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>“”He that gave the Occasion and Rise to these things sure <HI>Only for that,</HI></Q> cannot deserve to be thus Treated: If the Vindicator wou'd tell us, That his Lordship made the Proposal for that End, I allow it &amp; <HI>Erit mihi Magnus Appollo;</HI> but if it was only the Ef∣fect of the Nation being awaken'd at the Surprize of the Designs they saw on foot, the Merit then lies too deep for my short sight, and I think it has no more, than the Tacking Proposal of a former Parliament had the Merit of the Peoples sending up Wiser Representatives to this.</P>
<P>I confess, the Wisdom of Providence has been very visible, that has Reviv'd <HI>Sampson</HI>'s Riddle among us, <HI>brought Meat out of these Eaters;</HI> and all the Monsters of a Certain Party have been assistant, to Fright the Nation, not <HI>Out of,</HI> but <HI>Into their Senses,</HI> and so have
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
produc'd Good Effects to us all: But it must be noted withal, That it has been contrary, both to their Expectation, and to their Desire; and if I think the same, in the Case before me, I am afraid I guess too right to be convinc'd by the Consequences; and where, I be∣seech you, lies the Merit of all this?
<Q><L>Before I say any more, I must go on with the Text.</L></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>But I fear there are other Reasons that have raised some Per∣son's Spleen: Some perhaps are angry to have heard it said where it was,</HI> That there was so great a Favourite as the Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham</HI> in King <HI>James</HI> I. his time, who (as the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador told his Majesty) had Besieged him, had Enclosed him with his own Vassals and Servants, and would suffer no one else to have his Majesty's Ear, or so much as come near his Presence, and yet that great Man never had half that Power and Favour, that we see some Persons now-possessed of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>They care not to hear of</HI> Taxes laid upon all Court-Preterments, <HI>or of Persons being so</HI> fat with Favour aud great Offices, as make them insensible of the pressing Necessity a great part of the Nation labours under.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>Others do not like it should be said, That</HI> whenever there is a Dispute between a Parliament and a Minister, either the Minister will be too hard for the Parliament; and there's an End of your Constitution: or the Parliament will be too hard for your Minister, and there's an End of your Minister.</Q></P>
<P>Here 'tis apparent who this Paper aims at; That the <HI>Review</HI> is made but the Shadow or Guide for the Bowle, the Point cast at is plain, the Ministers of State are aim'd at, and the <HI>Review</HI> must be a Tool employ'd by them, or else Rallying him would not reach them. Thus I am brought in for a Place; but God knows, with∣out a Salary, I must have a Pension! I wish he was not in the wrong; for as I have hitherto said nothing but the Truth, I know nothing Dishonourable in being so Encourag'd to speak; but 'tis my Misfortune that it is not so; but on the contrary, I am the mean Thing my Author esteems me, for speaking that Truth which all the World has since found true, and that no Man feels the Inju∣ry of, but I and my Family.</P>
<P>Now let us Examine what is the Case here, <HI>The present Ministry,</HI> like the Old Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> Besiege and Enclose Her Majesty, &amp;c.</P>

<HI>Well!</HI> And pray what did the last Ministry do? Did not they do so too? I need go no further than my self, to affirm that I found it so, when the humblest and most diligent Applications for Capitulated Justice, could not by the most powerful Interces∣sions, ever obtain a true Representation to Her Majesty, but met with the Interruptions of those Gentlemen, who thought it their Interest to ruin a Man they could not—</P>
<P>But let us come to the Historical Instance quoted, The Diffe∣rence of Men makes the Difference of Cases, Favourites have al∣ways been obnoxious to the People of <HI>England;</HI> and as the <HI>Vindi∣cator</HI> observes well, <Q>“”they were either too hard for the Parliament, or the Parliament for them.</Q>—But the Cases differ, and he has the Unhappiness to fall upon a Ministry, that are the Peoples Fa∣vourites and the Queen's too; a Thing perfectly unknown in those Times, and are maligned <HI>Only by a Party,</HI> because they do what cou'd not be done before, because the War is carry'd on by Ge∣nerals and Admirals that stick close to the Business, and hazard all for the Publick, and fewer Expeditions are made in vain than us'd to be; because the Credit of the Treasury is recover'd, and even the Scarcity of Money cannot ballance the exquisite Husban∣dry and Conduct of him that superintends there, because Foreign Negotiations are not betray'd, and Intelligence is carry'd on at a Nicer Rate than under the Management of greater Pretenders; because Her Majesty is a Princess, that can judge and distinguish when she is well and ill serv'd, and will not hear every Malicious Insinuation against those that do Her Business faithfully; therefore She is <HI>Besieg'd and Enclos'd.</HI></P>
<P>Now supposing the Fact, tho' I do not grant it; here are King <HI>James</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Queen <HI>Ann Besieg'd</HI> and <HI>Enclos'd</HI> by Favourites; let us examine the Parallel.</P>

Let us not Complain, and have Nothing to say; these Gentlemen are not too Great for an Impeachment; and it would be a Contemptible Excuse, to say, <HI>The Parliament of</HI> England <HI>will not do them Justice:</HI> However, if it should be thought that these Gentlemen should be too hard for the Parliament (which I mention with Horrour;) yet according to my Lord <HI>Digby</HI>'s Case, which this Author cannot forget, 'tis the Duty of an English Nobleman, to fear no Power, and charge every Traytor. His Lordship will for ever Testify his Courage and Vigo∣rous Adherence to Justice, to tell us these Gentlemen's Crimes, and charge them where they are to be, and ought to be charg'd, <HI>viz.</HI> in Parliament; to pamphlet-daub them, bespatter them with Pen and Ink, and not appear to Impeach them of Crimes, is below an English Nobleman, and a Man of his Lordships Candor and Courage; which still Confirms me in the Opinion, that this Vindication cannot be his Lordship's own doing.</P>

In an Impeachment before the Parliament, all Matters of Truth will come to Light—My Lord Treasurer will be Censur'd and blig'd to refund all the Mis-apply'd and Embezl'd Cash with which he has Amass'd a vast Fortune, and rais'd his Family from Beggars to Noblemen, till he is become too Great for his Soveraign, and Terrible to the People, as it was with the Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham.</HI></P>
<P>Our Secretaries of State will be detected of Betraying the Coun∣cils, and Negotiations of the State, exposing the Prince to the Scandal, Ridicule and Contempt of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as it was in <HI>Ditto</HI> Time and Person, in the Case of <HI>Count Gondamor,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Match, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Our Admirals and Generals will be detected of Betraying their Confederates, not Relieving their Distress'd Allies, suffering be∣sieg'd Towns to be starv'd before their Faces, and a hundred more such Treacheries <HI>Ala-made,</HI> the Isle of <HI>Rhe,</HI> and the City of <HI>Ro∣chelle.</HI></P>
<P>If such things as these can be made out, for God sake, for the Na∣tion's sake, for the Queen's sake, and for our own Honour's sake, let us impeach them, and bring them to Light. We cannot doubt but the Parliament will be too hard for the Minister, when there is Guilt of his side, and such things as these can be brought on the Stage; and I cannot guess but the Vindicator sup∣poses these things, or he, would never have brought the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> for a Parallel, which, without these Circumstances, is as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame as the rest of the Charge.</P>
<P>Now the Author of the Vindication is pleas'd (by way of Re∣cess, and to give the Reader Breath) to take another Step below himself, and to fall foul upon the poor Author of the <HI>Review</HI> a∣gain.</P>

<P>To this I shall give a short Reply; That I am so far from the fear of starving, tho' Exceedingly press'd and pursu'd by Men of a Par∣ty, that for the sake of Publick Peace, I desire nothing more than a Regulation of the Press; and for my own Case, I leave it to Pro∣vidence;
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
I neither ask the Vindicator's Charity, nor Con∣cerns.</P>
<P>The next Paragraph in the Vindication is a Quotation out of the <HI>Review,</HI> and needless to repeat, the Vindicator saying nothing, but that it is a Two-edg'd Scandal; and I also say nothing till he shall think fit farther to Explain himself.</P>
<P>We are now come to the Business of the <HI>Moselle,</HI> and of <HI>Overysche</HI> again; and here the Vindication is pleas'd to state the Matter of Fact, as follows.—</P>
<P><Q>“”The next thing I am charg'd with, is, <HI>a heightning the Miscarri∣ages of the War, rendring our Allies suspected, and loading the</HI> Dutch <HI>and</HI> Imperialists, <HI>as if they had betray'd and abandoned us.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”But the very stating Matter of Fact is enough to wipe off this Scandal. There were two great Attempts design'd (besides the passing the <HI>French</HI> Lines) this last Campaign, worthy the Conduct of our General, <HI>viz.</HI> That on the <HI>Mozelle,</HI> and that at <HI>Overisch, had either of which succeeded, it had soon put an end to this chargeable War;</HI> and that they did not succeed, is known to every body: I would then ask any Man, to whom are these two Disappointments to be imputed? The Answer to this Question, I doubt not, would clear me from all the Malicious Insinuations of this Insolent Scribbler. Is it pos∣sible for any Man to imagine the D. of <HI>M</HI>—would have march'd the Grand Army some hundred Miles, upon a De∣sign he knew he was not strong enough to put in Execution, without the Assistance of Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI>'s Army, which he must have depended upon? Can any Man think that Matter was not first concerted? And if so, whence was it, that when the D. of <HI>M.</HI> had covered that Prince from the <HI>French,</HI> he was not joyn'd by him as was expected? <HI>By which Conjunction</HI> Saar Louis, <HI>which the</HI> French <HI>left uncover'd, had fall'n into our Hands, and a free and easy Passage open'd into</HI> France; <HI>and for want of which, a very promising Design was totally defeat∣ed:</HI> (And as the Reviewer confesses) <HI>our Affairs had a bad As∣pect at the unhappy baulk at the</HI> Mozelle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Again, in the Business of <HI>Overisch, did not the</HI> Dutch <HI>Deputies march near three Days in Company with the D. of</HI> M. <HI>and in all that time did they ever make any exception against his Design:</HI> yet whenit came to be put in Execution, when a fair opportunity of∣fer'd, and Victory in a manner courted us, there not being half the Danger and Difficulty there asat <HI>Blenheim;</HI> Could any Argu∣ments perswade them to consent to venture a Battel? Have not
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
the Letters of the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>M.</HI> and <HI>Monsieur A—k—que been made publick?</HI> And was there not a Book call'd the D—h Politicks ex∣amin'd, &amp;c.—Printed before the Parliament met, that carries this matter much higher than ever I did, which I never yet heard was answered? And must I only not be allowed to speak of such things without lying under the Lash of a Scandalous Pen, and look'd upon as an Enemy to the Confederates? But the most wonderful part of all this, is, that those Persons, who before were so full of those Matters, that they could scarce forbear shewing their Resent∣ment of the usage the D. of <HI>M</HI> met with, have ever since this was mentioned by me, made it their business to give it a quiet different turn. However, let this Snarler, or those who imploy him, be as angry as they please; when I read the joint Address of both Houses of Parliament (which he might have been more Ingenious than to have mangled as he has done) and read how earnestly they intreat Her Majesty, 'By all proper means to excite the whole Confede∣racy to make early and effectual preparations, and to exert their utmost Vigour in the prosecution of the War against <HI>France;</HI> I must be of opinion, that they had very good Grounds for what they did, which sufficiently justifies me.</Q></P>
<P>That the baulk of the <HI>Moselle</HI> gave an unhappy Turn to our Af∣fairs, I never denied, that the Dutch Deputies prevented a Fight at <HI>Overysche.</HI> I allow, and had his Lordship said no more in his Speech before, than is said in this <HI>State of the Fact,</HI> I should have said very little to the thing, if I had taken notice of it at all.</P>
<P>But as to <HI>Hightening Miscarriages,</HI> and <HI>Rendring our Ailies suspected,</HI> I do say still, with all respect to his Lordships Speech, that Printed Paper I was upon, let it be what it will, is in my Opinion fairly chargeable with it.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Germans</HI> did not joyn, is true, but the Paper says ex∣presly, they might <HI>very easily have joyn'd,</HI> of which this Vindication does not say one word how. Now to affirm, they <HI>could,</HI> and <HI>did not,</HI> which is to say, they <HI>would not:</HI> I cannot but think fairly amounts to a rendring <HI>them suspected</HI> and hightening the Miscarriage: if I am mistaken here, I'll readily ask pardon, but I cannot yet see it so much as possible to be a mistake, nor do I see the least at∣tempt made, to prove that Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> was in a conditi∣on to joyn; however were he in never so good a condition, were it pique, dissatisfaction, or any thing of that nature that hindred, yet the matter alledged here must be right, because that part is not offer∣ed to be prov'd.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
2. As to the Dutch—I know great clamour has been raised on that Affair, and I believe his Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had some Persons there who he had reason to complain of, tho' I cannot see it lies at the Door of the Dutch Deputies at all, who march'd three days doubtless with a design to fight, but let us set things in a true light.</P>
<P>The Paper I mentioned, does not blame particular Men, but <HI>the States</HI> under a National Term, <HI>the Dutch,</HI> if you will then call private Miscarriages the Actions of a Government; <HI>why then,</HI> the English Nation will come in for some Shares, upon account of some miss-be∣haviour of private Persons, in which our Allies have suffered as well as we; when our English Guards fled at <HI>Landen;</HI> when our English Fleet abandon'd the <HI>Catalans;</HI> when our Navy Royal left the Enter∣prize at <HI>Cadiz:</HI> Were all these Treacheries of the Nation, or of pri∣vate Men omitting their Duty? and would it not be very hard that these private Mens Errors should be charg'd upon the whole Nation? We have great reason to believe his Grace has received satisfaction in that point, and the Government also by the very good Corre∣spondence remaining.</P>
<P>And yet I cannot but add an Opinion here of my own, with re∣lation to the Dutch whether it concerns this case or no.</P>
<P>We never find the Dutch sparing of their Bones upon any reasona∣ble occasion, if at a distance from home, nor are they shy of commit∣ting the command of their Troops to our Generals. Witness their 8000 Men under Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> their Army on the <HI>Danube,</HI> under the Duke of <HI>Marlborough;</HI> their Army in <HI>Catalonia</HI> under my Lord <HI>Peterbo∣rough;</HI> Witness their Fleets always under our Admirals; But when the War is on their own Frontiers, and the Armies at their Doors, when on the least Defeat or Disappointment, the Enemy is in their Bowels in 24 Hours, and some of their capital Fortresses are exposed, This alters the Case.</P>
<P>The Dutch are a numerous, a rich and a trading Nation, they have a great deal to lose, and it lies in a little compass, and the least miscarriage exposes them to infinite damage before they can look a∣bout them: A remarkable instance of which we had, when the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> received but a little slip or <HI>go by</HI> from the <HI>French, who,</HI> had he not made one of the most daring as well as Politick Retreats that has been known in these Ages, had over-run all the Dutch <HI>Guelder∣land,</HI> and <HI>as it was</HI> show'd themselves in two days at the Gates of <HI>Nimeugen.</HI></P>
<P>These are good reasons why the Dutch are very wary, and indeed ought to be so, when the War is so near home; for this reason it has been the constant usage of the States to have Deputies with their Ar∣mies,
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
without whose Consent, even their own Generals are not to act; these they always had, 'tis the Law of their Country, and we do not see when it was ever dispensed with, but in a few of the latter Years of King <HI>William,</HI> occasioned by their Confidence in the Consumate Experience, as well as affectionate Care for their Safety, in that Immortal Prince.</P>
<P>All these Things considered, the <HI>Dutch</HI> ought to run no Risques, War is uncertain; to say that Action would have ended the War, is more than a Man of Experience ought to conclude, <HI>Multi Cadunt inter Calicem Supremaque Labra;</HI> but in War the Uncertainties are In∣finite; to say the Probabilities were greater than at <HI>Blenheim,</HI> is clenching it indeed; for I must tell this Author, I should think the <HI>Dutch</HI> reduc'd to sad Necessities, if they should hazard All as it was there. The Difficulties and Improbabilities of the Action at <HI>Blenheim</HI> were such, That had not the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> seen an Absolute Necessity of Pushing the <HI>French,</HI> and a Noble Superiori∣ty in the Goodness of his Troops, and above all, led on by the Inspirations of Fate, he would not have Attack'd the <HI>French</HI> Army under all those Disadvantages of Post, and Inferiority of Number; and I question not, and have good Reason to say it; Had that Ac∣tion Miscarry'd, the Improbabilities which now tend to the Im∣mortal Honour of our Nation, and of that Gallant Prince, would have been improv'd to Defame him, Scandalize his Discretion, and perhaps, carry'd on, if possible, to his Destruction.</P>
<P>I could say much more to this, but 'tis enough; remote from Home, where, if defeated, they can have time to turn round, collect their Forces, and defend themselves: None are forwarder for Action than the <HI>Dutch;</HI> at their own Door they are wary, and Infinite Reasons justify them in it; they were always so, we confe∣derated with them under such Circumstances, and ought to expect it; to say they held our Hands from Finishing the War, is as un∣certain, as to say, That taking <HI>Saar Louis</HI> would open a Way into <HI>France</HI> is Un-Geographical: For which I refer the <HI>Vindicator</HI> to his Maps, where he will find, that the <HI>Mareschall Villars</HI> cover'd the Entrance into <HI>France,</HI> and left <HI>Saar Louis,</HI> to take its Fate; after which they must have Fought him in his Entrench∣ments, before they had attempted to push into <HI>France,</HI> or have pass∣ed the <HI>Mozelle</HI> in his Sight, or have gon up and Besieg'd <HI>Metz,</HI> and left him behind them; neither of which would have been to be done without Extreme Hazard; for they had the <HI>Mozelle</HI> and the <HI>Maes</HI> to have passed before they came to the Frontiers of <HI>France;</HI> and whenever they had push'd things to that heighth, the <HI>French</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad Detachments to make from <HI>Flanders,</HI> which they never saw Danger enough to do.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28"/>
I know 'tis argued, that a Concert between the <HI>French</HI> and Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> seem'd probable, for that no Detachments were made from <HI>Flanders</HI> to the <HI>Mozelle,</HI> from whence some concluded the <HI>French</HI> knew that Prince would do them no harm.</P>
<P>But to me it seems as probable, that the <HI>French</HI> saw the <HI>Germans</HI> were not in a Condition of Joyning; or that the most they could attempt, if they joyn'd, was the Seige of <HI>Saar-Louis;</HI> which being very strong, and well provided, would make a Vigorous Defence, that Mounsieur <HI>Villars</HI> was strong enough Encamp'd, not to fear an Attack, and that their Superiority of Force in <HI>Flanders,</HI> would certainly be so useful to them, as would be worth sacrifizing <HI>Saar Louis,</HI> to Enjoy the Advantage.</P>
<P>And this Conjecture of mine, tho' weak, I make from two Ob∣servations; First, That they immediately push'd at the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ar∣my, attack'd <HI>Huy;</HI> and had not the D. of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> with the Vigour and Expedition, like the rest of his Great Actions, imme∣diately Countermarch't, they would have form'd the Siege of <HI>Mae∣stricht,</HI> as soon as the D. of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> had the <HI>Germans</HI> joyn'd him, could have form'd that of <HI>Saar Louis;</HI> so that the <HI>French</HI> easily saw they could fetch the Confederate Army back from the <HI>Mozelle,</HI> be∣fore the Confederate Army could fetch theirs from the <HI>Maes:</HI> Secondly, I conclude thus, because we find Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> has not tainted his Honour since, but acted afterwards very vigorously and successfully against the Enemy.</P>
<P>Thus all these wilful Mistakes fall to the Ground, and all the Exclamations against them, I think, are justly charg'd with De∣signs, to <HI>render our Confederates suspected.</HI></P>
<P>My examining the next Matters will farther explain it, when we come to those Trifles, the Vindication calls Ridiculous, and meer Cavils; which, tho' they are but small Matters, will in their kind, illustrate great; such as are the Expressions, of <HI>coming into the Field, when we were going into Quarters;</HI> thus <HI>ended your Campaign,</HI> and the like—as in the following Paragraph.</P>
<P><Q>“”There is one thing more, which is so very ridiculous, 'tis scarce worth notice, <HI>viz.</HI> how this Learned Critick labours, and is put to it, <HI>to bring the Business of</HI> Barcelona <HI>within the Constru∣ction of what I said.</HI> 'Tis so common a Rule, that words are to be understood according to their subject Matter, there is scarce a School Boy who does not know it: And from the beginning to the end of that Speech, there is not the least Intimation or Glance of any thing done in <HI>Spain.</HI> But 'tis all one to him whether that be so or not, he never considers the Gramatical Construction of Words; but right or wrong,

<P><Q>“”I shall say no more at present, but leave it to the Judgment of any indifferent and impartial Reader, how far by that Speech I have push'd on any specious Sham to byass the Ignorant and Honest People in my Favour, or how far I have been treat∣ed, as any Man might expect.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>In short, tho' no Man rejoyces more in our Successes every where than my self,</HI> yet I cannot but remember that it often hap∣pens in War as in Races, where sometimes these that win a Heat, may lose the Plate, <HI>which I heartily wish may never be our Case.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This indeed is wholly upon the <HI>Review,</HI> but how partially 'tis spoken, I refer to the Judgment of indifferent Men, that <HI>Words are to be understood according to the Subject,</HI> I readily grant, and a Man of my Ld <HI>H—m</HI>'s Perspicuity cannot but see, that the re∣mote Instances of <HI>Catalonia</HI> are brought in by the bye, to lead to the very Objection now made; and this therefore can never be his Lordships doing: For could any Man imagin, my Ld <HI>H—sham</HI> could show himself so unfair an Adversary, as not to recite the whole Matter, but draw a Censure from part. To rectify this, and do my self Justice, the Reader will find the weight of the Obje∣ction lies not upon the remote Instance, but upon the very indivi∣dual subject Matter talking of, and was so observ'd in the <HI>Review;</HI> for which I refer to the Paper, <HI>Review</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 116. <HI>P.</HI> 462. <HI>Col.</HI> 1. <Q>“”Sup∣pose he means, <HI>thus ended your Campaign</HI> IN FLANDERS, <HI>or your Campaign on</HI> THAT SIDE.</Q> I wonder much this Author should slip this Case, since the Words are printed in Capital Letters on purpose to be Remarkable.</P>

<P>As to the Reflection on Monsieur <HI>Fagell,</HI> and the Siege of <HI>Bada∣jos,</HI> which the States of <HI>Holland</HI> are reproach'd with not resenting, I am loth to reply to without Enquiring into the Fact, which I have not time to do; but thus far I must say all Nations have at all times had Miscarriages, and they do not always think fit to resent them; those that are wilful and treacherous indeed merit Remark, but Errors of Judgment or Accident, are not always resented to Ex∣tremity; and the French themselves, who we find as regular in Re∣wards and Punishments, as any Nation, and generally as well serv'd, do not always blame Miscarriages and Mistakes—who should else account for the <HI>French</HI> Admiral? when he had seen the Galloons safe at <HI>Vigo,</HI> that he should lie so long there, and not se∣cure the King's Ships at <HI>Brest,</HI> nor be in a sailing posture, that his Scouts bringing him Intelligence, he might have put out to Sea, and escap'd?

<P><Q>“”<HI>And as</HI> for those who set this Person to work; however they have made a Shift thinking to keep up their Reputation with some, which they have lost <HI>with others;</HI> yet they are so well known to both, as not to be long trusted by either, <HI>and whenever it shall happen</HI> they have no∣thing but their own Merit and Interest to support them, I doubt not but they will find their own Reputation as low in the World as they Endeavour to make that of others: <HI>And in the mean time</HI> present fears unsteadiness and mistrust of every body, <HI>make them not only very</HI> uneasy to themselves, <HI>but the very</HI> Contempt and Pro∣perty <HI>of those they depend on.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”There are two other Points, which the Limits of this Paper will but just give me leave to mention, <HI>viz.

And when ever a just account is given of what <HI>Remittances, Bulloine and Money in Specie</HI> have been sent to <HI>Holland</HI> since this War <HI>(which I would be very glad to see)</HI> that Matter I am consident, will appear as evident as that of the <HI>Dutch</HI> encreases.

<P>To this I answer as to Liberty of Speech in Parliament; I have nothing to say to it, but what I said in the <HI>Review,</HI> which the Vindi∣cation is pleas'd to take no Notice of; <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>“”'Tis hard the Queen alone should lose that Priviledge.</Q></P>
<P>The other Paragraph is another severe Satyr upon my Employers, to which I answer as before; To my Misfortune <HI>I am unemploy'd</HI> in the Sense of the Vindication; but I crave leave to say a Word by way of Conclusion, to the Case upon those whom this Vindicaiion must be understood to mean, and that is, the present Ministry; and tho' I solemnly protest, not one person directly, nor indirectly concern'd in, with, or for the Government, or Ministers of State, knows any thing of this, nor is it my Opinion they stand in need of any Vindication; yet in Common Justice, I must say, and if the <HI>Vindicator</HI> takes it ill, I shall be sorry. This paragraph savours of Envy, is not so in Fact, and is perfectly abusive and scurrilous.</P>
<P>To say, <Q>“”They (the Ministers) are so well known by both, <HI>that is, both Partys;</HI> as not to be long trusted by either, is altogether
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
assumptive,</Q> and if general Opinion and the nature of things may determine, is entirely groundless.</P>
<P>To say they are uneasy, fearful. and distrustful of every body, How strangely positive is that Character, and how easy is it to be affirm'd without Arrogance; <HI>Sir, you cannot know it to be so!</HI></P>
<P>That they are the Contempt and Property of those they depend upon, is meer calling Names, abusive and scurrilous; and I shall only take leave from, perhaps, as due a Conjecture, and I am sure a more impartial Observation, to conclude this Tract with a short account of the present State of the Nation, with respect to the Court and the publick Management.</P>
<P>The Queen I think needs no Mans Character, and I shall not presume to attempt it; In general, Her Majesty is God's Blessing upon the Nation, and all wise Men think so. Heaven has honour'd Her Majesty, with being the Agent of such a Peace as <HI>England</HI> never saw, and which I believe all the power of Hell and High Church, will not be able to disturb.</P>
<P>Her Majesty's Wisdom is seen particularly in the choice of Her Councillors and Servants Prudence and Moderation govern their Actions, they proceed sedately and calmly, they are Men of Ho∣nour, Vertue and Fortunes; they need no Advancement, and can∣not be tax'd with that Avarice and Extortion, which have been the constant Crimes of Favourites, have generally overthrown them, and made them just Sacrifices to the Peoples Revenge.</P>
<P>They stand charg'd with no Crimes, no Mismanagements appear in parliament against them, they are untainted in Reputation, un∣accused by their Enemies, only snarl'd as by a Party, whose Wings of Ambition they prudently clipp'd, and in whose Places: Her Majesty has thought fit to place them, as Persons, Her Royal Wisdom convinces Her, and the whole Nation agrees, are most likely to discharge the High Trust they are in, to Her Majesty's Satisfaction, the Honour of the Government, and the Safety of the Nation.</P>
<P>I could say a great deal more for the Justification of the present Mi∣nistry, but indeed I have not their Instructions, nor so much encou∣ragement as to know it may not displease them. Their case really needs no Vindieation, and tho' this Paper is published in his Lordships name, yet being fully perswaded his Lordship could not be so weak, I forbear to say more to it, as it stands <HI>'tis a second Memorial,</HI> and I doubt not will in its kind do the Nation a great deal of Service, <HI>as that has done,</HI> by letting them see for what trifles 'tis they are <HI>Malecon∣tents,</HI> and on what slight Provocations they would make a Nation un∣easy.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33" MS="y"/>
I am sensible of a new Design on foot, to run down the present Government, by Scurrility, Banter, and Reflection: So a modern Author reproaches the D. of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> with making the <HI>Tour</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> for private Advantage: Let them go on, we hope that Prince will not be discourag'd by these little Things from the Service of his Country; and I hope the Event will shew, that the Journey of the Duke was so far from having that little Design in it, that it had been worth while for their Friend, the <HI>French</HI> King, to have given him three times that Value to have staid at Home. I should say more to it here, but I shall do my self the Honour, to clear the Conduct of that Glo∣rious General in a more particular manner.</P>
<P>I had published this Reply sooner, but I waited to give a sufficient time for my Lord, if this Paper was not his own, publickly to disown it, which his Lordship having not done in all this time, I think 'tis an additional Ground to conclude 'tis not worth his notice.</P>
<P>I beseech my Lord <HI>H—m</HI> to bear with this Return to a Pa∣per publish'd in his Lordship's Name; I hope, I have no where trans∣grest the Rules of Decency to his Lordship's Character, I preserve a very great Respect for his Person, and no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should rejoice more to see his Lordship quit a Party, who on all Occasions have malign'd and affronted him; who court him now for private and corrupt Designs, and who will at last abandon and expose him; and to see his Lord∣ship return to espouse the Cause of Truth and Peace, as he has former∣ly done; than</P>
