<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I returned from <HI>Guil∣ford</HI>, in <HI>July</HI> last, I found a Discharge from the <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Manager, left for me at an unusual Time of the Year, and in an uncommon Manner, under the Hand of one <HI>White</HI>, a Servant of the Manager's: I pitied the Man that sent it—so thought him and his Scribe equally unworthy of farther Notice.</P>
<P>I immediately applied to the proper Power for Leave to try my Fortune at the
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
little Theatre in the <HI>Hay-market</HI>.—His G—e most kindly signed me a Licence during Pleasure, which I took the speediest Means I could to make Use of.—I had but a little Time to raise a Company, and hastily to instruct some new Pupils whom I was obliged to employ. A little more than a Fortnight after my Licence was granted, with a few unskilled Irregulars, I opened the Theatre, and performed there ten Nights in about three Weeks; I spared no Pains, but Night and Day attended the Business, or I had not been able to have proceeded so far:—My Labours were encouraged, and I gratefully remember the Honour several Noble Personages did me, by frequently gracing the Theatre, with their Appearance, on that Occasion:— I was in Hopes to have strengthned my Company by some additional Forces, as several new Performers (some not unpro∣mising) wished to take their Trials under my Tuition; and was not without Hopes
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
of being favoured with some Pieces from some Gentlemen who had before given Specimens of their Taste and Humour.— But alas! when <HI>D. L.</HI> Theatre opened,— I was ordered to stop awhile:—Some∣what farther passed on this Head, which I cannot so readily communicate;—But, my Epistle, addressed to Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>, ex∣plains it.—</P>
<P>I ceased not to petition, and solicit Leave to continue.—While the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>G.</HI> con∣tinued at <HI>New-Market</HI>, I employed a Morn∣ing, in the following Attempt at a Trans∣lation, or Imitation, of the first Ode of <HI>Horace</HI>;—'Twas sent to the D—, and not unkindly received; — I then pub∣lished it in some of the Papers.—Here it follows, with the prefixed Letter printed with it.</P>

<P>THough I flatter myself I have some Taste for the Poetry of others,— yet I presume not to boast any great Ta∣lents that Way myself;—'tis not the Va∣nity of an Author, but a more grateful Motive, occasions me to publish the fol∣lowing ODE:—'Twill be no Mortifica∣tion to me, should the Criticks pronounce me no Poet.—While the Candour of the Town allows me to be an Actor,—and the Continuance of their Favours, with the Protection of the Great, permits me to get my Bread by my Profession.—Such In∣dulgence gratifies the utmost Ambition of,</P>

<L>Your Grace dispels my dreary View:</L>
<L>So, when the World was wrapt in Night,</L>
<L>"BE IT LIGHT,"— said Heaven, and ALL WAS LIGHT.</L></Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Humbly Sheweth,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT your Petitioner is now in the 52d Year of his Age, 36 of which he has spent in the Service of the Public, whose con∣stant Approbation has encourag'd his Endea∣vours;</P>
<P>That your Petitioner, thro' the (YET <HI>unac∣counted for) Policies</HI> of the <HI>Theatres</HI> is excluded Both, while several, his Juniors (by some thought his Inferiors) are getting Fortunes therein:</P>
<P>Your Petitioner, at this late Time of Day, dreading the melancholy Prospects of Starving, in, or, at best, out of Jail (from whence he was but lately freed, by the Clemency of the Legis∣lature, on his surrendering his little All to his Creditors) has no Resource, but to pray—</P>

Hardship of his Case, and allow him to continue his Endeavours, for the Remainder of the Season, twice or thrice a Week, to get his Bread, by his Profession, at the little Thea∣tre in the <HI>Hay-Market</HI>; — which Boon your Petitioner is the more embolden'd to ask, as several of the Nobility and Gentry, his Patrons, wish to see him there: — And, as this Act of your G—'s Generosity can be of no Preju∣dice to others, — but a Relief to many; — and is the only Means to prevent your Petitio∣ner's Starving.</P>

<HEAD>EPISTLE TO Mr. <HI>GARRICK</HI>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I am certainly indebted to you, for the Negative Answer I have received (after repeated Solicita∣tions) to the Petition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hereto prefixed —Is it not incumbent on me, to return you my Public Thanks, for your extraordinary private Favour?—But, is it not possible, some People may think it a little hard, that an <HI>Englishman</HI>, the Son of an <HI>Englishman</HI>, (whose Birth entitled him to a better Fortune than a Playhouse Promised) and who, in his
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Theatrical Capacity, as Author, and Actor, has been judged one of the greatest Ornaments of the <HI>English</HI> Stage)— is it not hard, that His Son, after having spent many Years, with Ap∣probation, in the Service of the Public, should be obstructed in his honest Views, of getting his Bread still in their Service? — and really, by whom obstructed? may one not reply, by the Son of a <HI>Frenchman</HI>, who not content with having amassed a princely Fortune, is still jea∣lous a Shilling should be added to a poor Man's Purse, lest his Coffers should not sufficiently run over?</P>
<P>Alas! mistaken Sir, you need not fear being gay in your Palace, tho' I were to smile in my Cottage.—Can you really think it reasonable, to have my Head taken from my short Shoul∣ders, that you, my little great Man, may ap∣pear the taller? —Methinks, you might be satisfied with the Height you have risen to (without obstructing others) as it is well known you are, in a very few Years, in Point of For∣tune, become the tallest Man of your Genera∣tion, by many Thousands.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy Reflection for poor <HI>English</HI> Comedians, in a free Kingdom, to consider, they are the only Slaves of that Country; but, too true it is:—And to whom are they Slaves? His Majesty? No: His beneficent Heart wishes for none.—To whom then?—Why, to the Patentees of the Theatres (the Actor's Superiors only as Patentees, which they became by great good Luck;) for it is certain, such is their
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Power—that if Want of Judgment, if Pique, or Caprice prevail, they can render the Abilities of the best Performer very useless Qualifications; they can damn good Performers by their Arts, and push indifferent Ones forward by their Par∣tiality; 'till such Favourites, growing familiar to the Town (and none better being suffered to oppose them) they pass for Actors of established Merit, and the Epithets <HI>Celebrated, Eminent</HI>, and <HI>Excellent</HI>, are as wantonly tacked to their Names as in the Marriage Articles of News, when
<Q>“Master <HI>Aaron Nicknack</HI>, the Son of a celebrated <HI>Dutch</HI> Toyman at <HI>Wapping</HI>, is mar∣ried to Miss <HI>Biddy Frissé</HI>, the Niece of an emi∣”nent <HI>French</HI> Barber near <HI>Execution Dock</HI>.</Q></P>
<P>In how much a happier Situation are the <HI>French</HI> Players, tho' in a Country of hateful arbitrary Power? — Tho' Superstition, and Priestcraft, deny them Christian Burial, yet Hu∣manity denies them not a comfortable Liveli∣hood:—Nor is it in the arbitrary Power of the Directors of the Theatres, wantonly to dis∣charge the meanest of them, without Cause assigned; nay, Provision is made for all Kinds of Performers, who, by Age, or other Acci∣dents, become Invalids, after spending their Time in a Theatrical Capacity:—Nor is that Provision such a scanty Stipend, but that it enables them to live with Decency and Com∣fort.—But you, Sir, may probably know more of this, as your Father, a Native of <HI>France</HI>, was capable of acquainting you more fully there∣with.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>Think, Sir, what might have been your Situation, with all your Merit (which, believe me, Sir, I am not either ignorant of, or wilfully blind to) but for the late Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI>'s fatal Indiscretions?—Fatal, unhappy Man, to him∣self, his Family, and Friends.—But for these, which occasioned, at last, his mortgaged Patent to be sold for a Trifle,—and many other happy Incidents, that all, at once, occurred in your Favour, you might have been in my Situation, Sir; —or at best, receiving a Stipend Thou∣sands short of your present Income: Since you may remember, a Cartel (of a cruel Nature) was proposed, and near signing, by the then Managers of the Theatres, —when he who became the Patentee of <HI>D. L.</HI> Theatre, and to whom alone the new Grant was first made (and which before had been denied to you) prudently proposed your being a Partner therein; on which Foun∣dation (I do not insinuate <HI>unmerited</HI>) you have raised a noble Fortune:—Sir, I have employed thrice the Number of Years, you have, in the Service of the approving Public,—and am I, Sir, at last, to be stopped in my honest Pursuit, thro' you, Sir? For, Sir, not to mince the Matter, it is thro' you, I know (and you know) I am delayed. Sir, your Policy overshoots it∣self, as I shall endeavour soon to make appear, by proving my little Attempts at the <HI>Haymarket</HI>, might be of future Use to you. But first give me Leave to hint—I think this Sort of Treat∣ment I have met with, the less supportable, as it is what I never chose to inflict on others, when in Power. Let me dare to speak Truth, without
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
the Imputation of Vanity: I remember not any Opportunity I ever slipped, to encourage any Author; or any Hardship, or Injury, directly, or indirectly, I was ever guilty of, towards any Performer:—On the contrary, I was ever for∣ward to advance them, to the utmost that could be allowed, whenever their Merit seemed to en∣crease: —Nor did any Partiality to myself, make me use any sinister Means to obstruct the Rising of another.</P>
<P>When you became a Manager, I was in an Article with your Partner; it was left to your Option to have me as an Actor, at a Salary inferior to what I had formerly received, from Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI> — who found me of Conse∣quence enough to give me equal to any Actor then in being (Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> excepted, whose Merits had earlier procured him a larger Salary than any Performer had received before). I then per∣suaded Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI> (who consulted me on that Occasion) by all Means to add you to the Com∣pany, as he then hinted he could have you:— And, tho' he had articled with me, to give no other Performer a superior Salary to mine, with∣out mine being advanced equal thereto, I con∣sented he should agree with you, on any Terms he thought fit for his Purpose, and declared I would take no Advantage of such Agreement. —You may remember, Sir, our Meeting with you in order to settle such Agreement. There were present the late Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI> and Mr. <HI>De∣lane</HI>, Mr. <HI>Cross</HI>, still living, and myself. You may remember too, I declared (regarding you
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
as a young Performer of rising Merit) that any Part I had played was at your Service, only de∣siring Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI> to allow me reasonable Time to study some others (which I should not be against acting in the same Plays) that I might not, thro' such Condescension, be thought idle, or become useless.</P>
<P>But, to return to my leaving it to your Option whether I should continue in your Company— You may remember my waiting on you, at your Lodgings, in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI>, to that Pur∣pose; — nor can you, I suppose, forget the Letter your Partner received from me, on that Head:—You must have seen it—it related to you both.—You best know, Sir, why you then declined my serving you; — I too, Sir, know your Reasons now; — I guessed them then;—and may, at a farther Opportu∣nity, take more Notice of them.—In the Interim, let me remind you, Sir, I have not made Use of that incontestible Power the Law has given me, to deprive you of a potent Assistant, in your Theatrical Business; — Time has taught me to stifle private Resent∣ment, however justifiable, where the Quiet, or Entertainment, of the Public is concerned:— I think it not consistent with my Duty to them, to stop their Pleasure in any one Place, espe∣cially when I would wish to divert them my∣self in another.</P>
<P>Perhaps your superior Policy may arraign mine. But, when I was a Manager, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

have been Sir (uncomplained of) of His Ma∣jesty's Company of Comedians, and might have continued so, had not a mistaken Pur∣chaser bought my Farm over my Head, when I had no Suspicion of such Proceeding; — as a certain set of Renters were lately served — a Case not quite unsimilar. — When I was in the Management of the Theatre-Royal, I neither endeavoured to force any Entertain∣ment on my Spectators, nor took any Methods to prevent their Diversion in any other Place,— though frequently urged thereto by my Brother Managers, who often consulted some partial Council, in order to suppress other Theatres;— which Meetings afterwards occasioned that out∣rageous Prosecution against Mr. <HI>Harper</HI>, the Comedian (who by the Way happened to be a Housekeeper in <HI>Middlesex</HI>, and a Freeholder in <HI>Surry</HI>) and in a most unprecedented, and ar∣bitrary Manner, did the strained Power of a petulant <HI>Middlesex</HI> J—ce treat him. — Such was it deemed by a then L. Ch. J. (now an Ornament to the still higher Station he fills) who released Mr. <HI>Harper</HI>, on his single Recognizance to appear, if his Prosecutors thought it prudent to proceed further at Law: — This was after hearing many Council, learned in the Law, on both Sides, — and Mr. <HI>Harper</HI> left the Hall, with the unanimous Joy of several Hundreds, who crowded it on that Occasion.</P>
<P>'Twere ungrateful not to remember an honour∣able Speech of the Great Man, who then sat on the Bench. — The Cause was appointed to be
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
heard early in the Morning, when some of the opposite Council were for deferring the Plead∣ings, and treated it as a Matter of little Conse∣quence; that Great Good Man declared — He thought it a Matter of great Consequence, as the Liberty of a Subject was concerned; — that he could not enter on it too soon, — nor should he grudge any Time bestowed on it.</P>
<P>This known Fact was some Years before the Law since made, whereby acting is made ille∣gal (though deemed by no Statute criminal or bad in itself) unless authorised by Patent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the Crown, or Licence from the Lord Ch—n; —and, that the Legislature did not mean always to confine it to Two Theatres, in this so great Metropolis, is evident from the unlimited Power (as to Number) which that very Law vests in the Crown, and Noble Perso∣nage before mentioned. Many Years before this Law I was in the Profession of an Actor —encouraged by the Candour of the Town; happy in their Smiles: 'Tis not my Business here to remark on that Law; I leave that Task to abler Heads, to whom such Province more properly belongs. — Nor shall I dwell here on the many Theatrical Chicaneries which have been practised against me, when I was most un∣happy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I declare, I do not mean, hereby, a general Reflexion, on my Theatrical Brethren; none will think it needs further Apology, but those who feel the Smart of its Truth: Such are welcome to winch, and be misty — and to such I say, —
<Q>“In mine Adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves to∣gether: Yea the <HI>ABJECTS</HI> gathered themselves together against ”me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not,</Q>
Ps. 35. v. 15.</NOTE>; — I may have already tired the Reader

too much.—But, as I before hinted (which let me here explain) that the little Theatre in the <HI>Hay-Market</HI> might become a Nursery for young Per∣formers, from whence might be culled, at proper Season, new Actors, for the Advantage of the Patentees, and the better Diversion of the Town, is undeniable. — Thus the Trial of such Per∣formers at that Place, might save the Patentees both Expence, Time, and Trouble: The Mur∣murs of several Authors might also be stopped hereby — since many Pieces might be here re∣ceived, when the Managers of the Theatres Royal might but be able to bring many forward, few of the Multiplicity with which they are often overloaded;— and the Patentees might well sup∣pose, they would ever have the Preference both as to Performers, and Performances, since that Theatre, from its Smallness, and Situation, could never hope to vie with them, to their Preju∣dice: — Their Apprehensions may be great, but their Danger could be but small.— Yet, whatever their Fears, is it reasonable, a Mono∣poly should be made of any one Profession, for the Emolument of two or three alone, — while all the rest must lie at their Mercy? Would not any Foreigner be astonished to hear that any Set of People, Proficients in any Art (in a free Country) are to work, or starve, at the Will, and Pleasure of one, or two — nay, perhaps, as may be determined by some one who is to∣tally incapable, either by Instruction, or Per∣formance, of furthering, or improving, by Pre∣cept, or Example, that Art which he gets an Estate by? What a cruel Condition would the

Professors of all the Sister-Arts be in, thus ty∣rannically made a Monopoly of, to support the Profusion of a few Ignorants?</P>
<P>Once more, Sir, let me repeat—What would you think,—what would you feel,—thus hard beset as I am?—Would you think it reason∣able that no Portion of that Bread, the Town is able, and willing, to bestow, should fall to your Lot? —That you should, to gratify the Ambition, or Avarice, of any rich successful Man, when Necessity urges in the latter Part of your Life, (though bless'd by Heaven with Health and Abilities) be prevented from ex∣erting your Faculties in your own Behalf?— Would you be silent on s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch an Occasion? Would you not let the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld know your Condition? Would you not acquaint such as may not have already consider'd it, that this Metropolis is amazingly encreas'd, that Proper∣ty is greatly diffus'd; that many Families are ad∣vanc'd;—that all Degrees of People go to Plays, as the most rational Amusement;—that there are near thirty times the Number of Spectators there were 30 Years ago;—that six Theatres have flourished in one Season, when there were much fewer Numbers to support them;—and that the Town now have but two to go to?</P>
<P>For my own Part, I have but simple <HI>English</HI> Honesty to proceed upon;— whether that will be of as much Service to me as <HI>French</HI> Jesuitical Policy, Time must determine.—My remaining Hope is in a K—g, whose Benevolence of Heart, were he but a private Man, would make him

one of the first of Characters; and whose Ver∣tues as a Prince, it will better become me silent∣ly to admire, (while a happy Nation proclaims his Praise) than presumingly to expatiate on. —If all other means fail (remember, Sir, you urge me to it) I have still the Right of an <HI>English</HI> Subject, to address that great Power, who is justly stil'd the Father of his People, who is universally regarded as the Fountain of Goodness, as well as Honour:—I will not therefore despair, of still having Leave to gain Bread for myself, and a little <HI>British</HI> Company, in that Theatre, wherein the <HI>French</HI> Comedians have been more than once licens'd.—</P>
<P>It may possibly be remember'd I have some∣times, from the whole Royal Family excited a Laughter of Approbation.—Why then may I not hope their condescending Goodness will con∣sider and relieve the anxious Heart of a loyal Subject, who has often had the Honour of making them smile.—I am, Sir, with all due Deference to your Merit, your real Admirer; —and should have been glad, long since, in a Theatrical Capacity, on proper Terms, to have subscrib'd myself,</P>
