<HEAD>TO THE HONOURABLE <HI>CONSTANTINE JOHN PHIPPS.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE the motives of dedication can∣didly acknowledged, perhaps it would appear that authors in general rather intend a compliment to their own vanity, than to that of their patrons. Patron, I flatter myself, will, in the present instance, appear to You too cold and distant an ex∣pression; and though I entertain all due res∣pect for superior rank and situation, and am happy in seizing an opportunity of de∣claring to the world that I am honoured with the friendship of Mr. Phipps, yet never was there an epistle of this nature, in which mere vanity had a more incon∣siderable share; nor should I be thus proud of proclaiming my affection for him, were I not convinced of his being possessed of qualities and accomplishments that would distinguish and adorn the most humble, as well as the most elevated situation.</P>
<P>In the midst of the most familiar inter∣course, I should be loth to forfeit in any de∣gree the partiality you are pleased to shew me, by the smallest appearance of flat∣tery. But when I do but echo the voice of
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
all those who are acquainted with your pub∣lick or private character; when I barely ob∣serve, that in an age of the most unbounded dissipation, You have devoted your time to the attainment of all useful and elegant know∣ledge; joining to the most amiable disposi∣tion the most unshaken integrity, as well as a thorough acquaintance with the constitu∣tion of your country, together with the most able and faithful discharge of the duties of your profession—when I just faintly sketch these outlines of your character, it will, I hope, rather be supposed that I presume to hint to you what the world seems to expect from a young man of fashion of so great promise, than that I mean to corrupt you, or degrade myself, by idle compliment and mean adulation.</P>
<P>Of the Comedy which I now present to you, I will venture to say but little. It is difficult for any man to speak with a to∣lerable grace of himself, and literary per∣formances ought to be their own recom∣mendation; yet I will not scruple to confess, that if I thought it entirely despicable, I would not sollicit your acceptance of it. Three of the great writers, enumerated in the Prologue, Plautus, Terence, and Mar∣montel, have contributed to enrich it. A play lately exhibited on the French stage, the Deux Amis of M. Beaumarchais, also suggested some hints of the fable; but the races of them in this Comedy are so little
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
apparent, that if I did not thus acknowledge the sources from which I have drawn, I question if the ingenious author himself would be able to claim his own property.</P>
<P>Did I conceive that this play contained any passages unfavourable to liberty, more especially the liberty of the press, You, Sir, would be one of the last persons in the kingdom to whose protection I should ven∣ture to recommend it. The liberty of the press is a most invaluable privilege; yet that liberty, like every other species of li∣berty, may be abused; and while it remains (as it is to be hoped it ever will remain) unrestrained by law, the abuse of it is more peculiarly the object of Comedy, whose pro∣vince it is, by wholesome and general sa∣tire, to correct those failings and enormi∣ties, of which the law takes no cognisance. Better were it that thousands and ten thou∣sands of such insignificant individuals as my∣self should be maliciously slandered, than that sacred right of Englishmen should be violated or infringed: yet who will justify the scandalous personalities (politicks entirely out of the question) that disgrace our news∣papers? It is not however sufficient, it seems, to endure them patiently, without a wish to interrupt their progress, but the gentlest retort is enough to set all Grub-Street in an uproar; and the most good-humoured ridi∣cule of these illustrious authors is an attack upon the liberty of the press:—a liberty
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
which they are zealous to exercise in its sullest extent, without allowing any portion of it to their opponents; not considering that the chief benefit of the liberty of the press results from its being open to all, and affording a free examination of both sides of every question. The very liberty they take, however, they are not willing to give; like a scavenger I saw the other day in the street, who bespattered every passenger with the contents of his mud-cart, but sent a volley of curses after a lady of quality, who hap∣pened to splash him as she drove by in her chariot.</P>
<P>Having said thus much of my Comedy, in vindication of the freedom I have used in inscribing it to You, I will not trespass longer on your patience, than to repeat the satisfaction I feel in thus openly testifying my regard, and that I have the honour to be,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>

<L>SEE here, good folks, how genius is abus'd!</L>
<L>A play of mine! the manager refus'd!</L>
<L>And why?—I knew the reason well enough—</L>
<L>Only to introduce his own damn'd stuff.</L>
<L>Oh! he's an arrogant, invidious elf,</L>
<L>Who hates all wit, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no wit himself!</L>
<L>As to the plays on which he builds his fame,</L>
<L>Boasting your praise, <HI>we all know whence they came.</HI></L>
<L>Crown him with ivy, least of Brentford kings!</L>
<L>For still, like ivy, round some oak he clings.</L>
<L>Plays you have damn'd, their authors yet unknown,</L>
<L>Trust me, good people, those were all his own.</L>
<L>If his lame Genius ever stood the test,</L>
<L>'Twas but a crutch'd noun-adjective at best;</L>
<L>Or rather <HI>expletive,</HI> whose weak pretence</L>
<L>Occupies space, but adds not to the sense.</L>
<L>His Lady-Muse, tho' puling, wan, and thin,</L>
<L>With Green-Room caudle all in state lies-in;</L>
<L>His brats so ricketty, 'tis still their curse</L>
<L>To be swath'd, swaddled, and put out to nurse;</L>
<L>Brought up on playhouse pap, they waule and cry,</L>
<L>Crawl on the stage, or in convulsions die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His play to-night, like all he ever wrote,</L>
<L>Is pie-ball'd, piec'd, and patch'd, like Joseph's coat;</L>
<L>Made up of shreds from Plautus and Corneille,</L>
<L>Terence, Moliere, Voltaire, and Marmontel,</L>
<L>With rags from fifty others I might mention,</L>
<L>Which proves him dull and barren of invention:</L>
<L>But shall his nonsense hold the place of sense?</L>
<L>No, Damn him! Damn him, in your own defence!</L>
<L>Else on your mercy will the Dwarf presume,</L>

<L>Now, now, my friends, we've brought him to the stake;</L>
<L>Bait him! and then, perhaps, some sport he'll make.</L>

<L>Friends, like dried figs, stuck close in every row!</L>
<L>Some wits in ambush, in the gallery sit;</L>
<L>Some form a critick phalanx in the pit;</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Fable <HI>and Mrs.</HI> Golding.</STAGE>
<STAGE>(She in a fancy-dress, with a mask in her hand.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fable.</SPEAKER>
<P>MAdam, madam, I tell you he is a coxcomb—an arrant coxcomb, Mrs. Golding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Golding.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a gentleman—thoroughly the gentleman, Mr. Fable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, a modern gentleman—a fine gentle∣man—a race of puppies more pernicious to this country than a breed of wolves would have been.—A mongrel puppy too; on a wrong scent after pleasure; in chace of the fashion, but for ever at fault; with vanity in view, and ridicule for a whipper-in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, Mr. Fable, it does not sig∣nify talking. You know, you and I could never agree on this matter. I was always for my kins∣man's
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
keeping the very best company; and, for my part, I see no great difference between him and his friends of quality—Nay, indeed, mongrel, as you are pleased to call him, sir, the advantage is rather on his side: he has money without rank, and many of them have rank without money. If Beverley has great goings-out, he has great com∣mings-in too; while they keep fine houses, flaming equipages, and great tables out of nothing at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>For which very reason, Mrs. Golding, he is not upon even terms with them. What has a man of business to do with men of pleasure? Why is a young banker to live with young no∣blemen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not, Mr. Fable? Is not the business of the house carried on at the polite end of the town? Does not he live in the very centre of persons of fashion? And has not he constant dealings with them?—Not shut up in Lombard-street—within the sound of Bow-bell, or in sight of the Monument—not cramming turtle and venison at the King's-Arms, or the London-Tavern—but ballotted into the Macaroni, and a member of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avoir Vivre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the worse—so much the worse, Mrs. Golding—his father, who was the firm of the house, established the credit of it by decency and sobriety: but dying while Beverley was very young, your husband, Mr. Golding, was received into the part∣nership as a man of experience, capable of car∣rying on the business to more advantage. He, you know, is now absent on necessary business abroad. In the mean time, I am left a kind of guardian to Beverley, and have the superintend∣ance of his affairs—and what account shall I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e likely to give of them, when instead of making money after the example of his father, he is in∣tent on nothing but spending it? Horses at New∣marstet,
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
hounds at Bagshot, a villa, a mistress, play, and a round of dissipation among hair∣brain'd spendthrifts, wasting their constitutions be∣fore they arrive at maturity, spending their for∣tunes before they come to them, granting annui∣ties to eat up their estates, or living upon the sale of post-obits and reversions!—There, madam, there's a picture of a genteel young banker at the west-end of the town for you; drawn from the life, and coloured after nature; how do you like it, madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>A frightful caricature, Mr. Fable! your descriptions are just the reverse of that sweet flower of a man, the auctioneer over the way. His style is enchanting and delicate, elegant as the <HI>or moulu,</HI> or Derbyshire petrifications, he sets to sale, and soft as the pencil of Guido, Raphael, or Correggio—your pictures may be taken from nature; but they are dark!—dark as the landschapes of Poussin, and wild, and horrible as the views of Salvator Rosa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, madam, it is these affected airs, madam, that pervert your understanding, and make you blind to the danger of your kinsman.—He is in imminent danger of ruin, madam, which will fall upon him, if something is not speedily done to prevent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what would you have me do, Mr. Fable? All I say is, that good company is a very good thing, and genteel connexions can never do my kinsman any mischief; and if I had been mistress, I never would have rested till I had got him into parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into parliament!—into jail, madam. Is not he at expence enough—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Expence! Lord, lord! This is a point of oeconomy, sir. Why he would save above double the charge of bringing him into the house
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
by the mere postage of letters.—Sir Geoffry Kil∣derkin got himself elected for no other purpose.—My kinsman too would frank himself whole again.—And then I am sure he would make an admi∣rable figure in a debate.—Oh, how it would have delighted me to have sat among the ladies in the gallery of the house—to have seen him upon his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet, his whole person hanging over his right leg, his right arm swinging to and fro like a pen∣dulum, and his tongue running down like a larum!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, so! you, I fear, are too far gone for wholesome counsel. Beverley, I hope is not quite incorrigible, and some good may be done upon him. Good morrow to you, madam! I have bu∣siness; good day, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good night, if you please, sir. You may be just up, but I have not been to bed yet, being (as you see) but just come from the Pantheon. The masquerade began to grow thin; but my kins∣man, who was there, is not come home yet, and may not return for some time perhaps—so, once more, good night, good Mr. Fable! I'll endeavour to re∣cruit my spirits from the fatigue of the pleasures of the night, and leave you to the business of the day. Your servant, sir.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Fable <HI>alone.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Your servant, madam!—A weak woman, inca∣pable indeed of swaying the mind of Beverley by her advice, but still serving to countenance his follies by her example.—But now to the business of the day, as she says!—A serious day it will ap∣pear to the young gentleman, I fancy—But it is high time to make him serious—I'll just allow him a short interval to sleep off his masquerade, and
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
then wake him from his dream of folly to a sense of his true situation.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Check.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good morrow, Check!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good morrow to your honour!—The shop is just opened and sprinkled. I am going to the compting-house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right, Check. Regularity and punctuality are the life of business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>The life and soul, sir. I have always found them so—always exact myself I can answer—always precise to a second—and as true to my time as the men that strike the quarters at St. Dunstan's. Ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're merry, Check!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I wish I had cause, sir. Another great house in the city stopt payment yesterday, and a large sum subscribed to prop the credit of another. Sad times, Mr. Fable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sad times! sad men, honest Check. Men make the times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, very true, sir. Ah, one need not go far from home to know that, sir. In poor old Mr. Beverley's time, when we carried on busi∣ness in Threadneedle-street, those were days, Mr. Fable! I wish we were on the other side of Tem∣ple-bar again!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; you are right just where you are, friend. The two sides of Temple-bar have changed hands, Check. The gay, smart, airy sparks, of the west end of the town, have all taken to business, and are turned sheriffs and aldermen; and the merchants, bankers, and tradesmen, are your principal persons of pleasure now-a-days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, I am afraid so. Here's a house, forsooth! my old lady always entertaining com∣pany
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
at home, and my young master always abroad; night turned into day, and day turned into night! It was not so in my old master's time. Never out of the regular channel; sure and mo∣dera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e profit; quiet, sober living; a plain joint and a pudding on week days, and, perhaps, two joints and two puddings on Sunday!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, don't be melancholy, Check. You may live to see two puddings on table again, perhaps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have no hopes but in you, Mr. Fa∣ble; no hope but in you, sir! Every thing would go to wreck and ruin, if it was not for you, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come; cheer up, honest Check! your young master will take up shortly. He has a good heart, and a good understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish he would make less use of his heart, and more of his understanding, sir. He is as generous as a prince, and he thinks all his ac∣quaintance as honest and generous as himself. Let him mind his friend, Mr. Denier, sir. There's a young man for you! merry and wise, I warrant him! He knows that a shilling is a serious thing; that a penny saved is a penny got; and two and two make four, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beverley will find it out at last, Check.—Have you prepared the books and papers as I di∣rected you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well. Let them be ready for in∣spection this very morning; and tell Mr. Beverley I am gone to the Bank; but desire he would not be out of the way at my return, as I have some∣thing of consequence to say to him. Good mor∣row, Check!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good morrow to your honour! I shall be sure to let Mr. Beverley know, sir. <STAGE><HI>[Exit.</HI> Fable.</STAGE>

Oh, here comes his <HI>gentleman,</HI> as they call him. I wish there was not such a gentleman within the bills of mortality.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Handy.</STAGE>
<P>Good morrow to you Mr. Handy! Good mor∣row!</P>

<P>What! my old Rule of Three! are you there? good morrow to you!</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you suppose wrong, Old Thread∣needle! He is up, I assure you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! why he is more early than or∣dinary, Mr. Handy.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much later than ordinary, master Check. He has not been to bed yet.</P>

<P>Mercy on me! past eight in the morn∣ing, and not gone to bed yet?</P>
</SP>

<P>No, he's not come home from the mas∣querade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>The masquerade! Oh, now you have accounted for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I had some thoughts of being at the Pantheon myself, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! at the sixpenny Pantheon at Islington, Mr. Handy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sixpenny Pantheon! S'death what d'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mean, sir? do you take me for a little shopkeeping mechanic, or one of your dapper city clerks, that draws his pen from under his ear in the evening, to go and drink tea at Bagnigge Wells or Dob∣ney's Bowling Green? No, sir; let me tell you I frequent no diversions but those of persons of qua∣lity. Plays now and then, operas twice a week, and masquerades whenever there are any.—A lady of my particular acquaintance—of the first fashion I assure you, old gentleman,—had provided me a ticket, and a domino, with a smart hat and fea∣ther,
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
and diamond button and loop to it.—But as the devil would have it, my lord du—zouns, what was I saying?—Her husband, I say, happening to come in at an unfortunate moment, saw the dress lying in her apartment. My lady—a devilish clever wo∣man upon my soul—turned it off with a laugh, and told him she had provided them on purpose for him, in order to surprise him with a piece of con∣jugal gallantry. So away they went to the Pan∣theon together, and I was obliged to amuse my∣self with another woman of quality who kept house all the evening, to console myself for my disappointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>You imagine I have a large portion of faith, I believe, Mr. Handy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith!—Why have I offered to borrow any money of you, you old multiplication-table? Eh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have not taken that liberty with me, because you knew I would lend you none: but you are rather too familiar with your betters me∣thinks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are familiar with us, and encourage familiarities on our side.—Nay, if you would fol∣low my advice, I would engage to make a fortune even for you, old Methusalem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>For me, Mr. Handy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, for you, old boy! What do you think now of making love to Mrs. Golding? Her husband's abroad, you know. Intrigues are the mode, and she loves to be in the fashion.—Devil take me, if I don't think she and you would make an excellent <HI>tête-a-tête—</HI>Shalum and Hilpa! Eh, my old antediluvian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce with your wit, good Mr. Handy; and please to let your master know that Mr. Fable desires to see him on some particular business as
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
soon as he is stirring,—which, perhaps, may be about dinner-time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! do you pretend to joke too? Pounds, shillings, and pence—you had best stick to that, old gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>They won't stick to you long, I am afraid, young gentleman. Ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again! You are trying to copy after old master Fable, I warrant you.—A sly, dry, queer old buck, that Mr. Fable! He don't much approve of our proceedings, I believe. The people call my master the Macaroni Banker, he says. <STAGE>(Laugh heard)</STAGE>—Gadso! yonder my master comes, faith—and along with him his bosom friend, Mr. Denier—a snake in his bosom too, if I am not mistaken. I never could endure that shrewd spark since I heard him upon the chapter of vails—which he never gives to other people's servants; but, for fear of raising the wages at home, suffers them to be taken by his own. A young curmudgeon! worse than a liquorish old dotard, if possible.—What say you, Grandsire?—<STAGE>(Laugh again)</STAGE>—But, hush! they are here.—Now you may deliver your errand to him yourself, old gentleman.</P>

<P>Support a character at masquerade! Ab∣surd and ridiculous!—and a vulgar idea too, that never entered the head of a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my habit gave me no trouble of that sort—yet I did not wear it from choice, but from convenience. One of the managers of Co∣ven-Garden theatre—for there are about five and forty of them, you know—lent me the dress—and I don't see why I should be expected to support a
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
character in it any more than those who usually wear it.—Eh, Beverley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure. They who say the softest things, and succeed most with the women, enter into the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irit and genius of the place the most happily. Gallantry and intrigue, not wit and hu∣mour, are the objects of a masquerade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, Beverley. I know more than one or two professed jokers, that rehearse their parts for a fortnight before-hand, and write down all the good things they shall say; but, as ill luck will have it, for want of courage and op∣portunity, never utter one of them; and yet, re∣solving they shall not be lost to the world, send them, ready cut and dry, to the news-papers, as having been their extempore sallies and masquerade pleasantries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I know the little haberdashers of small wit; I know them, Denier, and thank you for your description of them.—But who the deuce was that very elegant-looking woman that lord Robert Sprightly stuck so close to for most part of the evening? I have a strong notion it was lady Sarah Brilliant—very like her figure; or Harriot Freelove—but her—she's common, you know—her he would not have followed so warmly.—Oh, Check, are you there?—Handy too? <STAGE>(Check <HI>and</HI> Handy <HI>come sorward)</HI></STAGE> Have you set my night-things in my bed-chamber?</P>

<P>Well, let him have due notice, d'ye hear, Check?—And do you call at the <HI>Sçavoir,</HI> and let them know that I shall dine there to-day, d'ye hear, Handy?—And do you come to me with the state of sir John's account, as soon as I am up, dy'e hear, Check?</P>

<P>You'll dine with us at the <HI>Sçavoir,</HI> De∣nier?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's impossible. Lady Quaver, who subscribes to the opera, has lent her box to Mrs. Carlton and Lydia this evening, and I have pro∣mised to attend them; so we must make a short early dinner at home. You will hardly rise from table before the <HI>finale.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time enough to see the Heinel walk over the course, perhaps: but the places of public di∣version do keep most disorderly hours to be sure. As to the play-houses, I scarce ever attempt to peep into them. There is no getting a mouthful of tragedy or comedy without baulking one's appetite
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
for every thing else. But Lydia is fond of plays too; and the little prude is so eager and punctual, she is as sure to be at the drawing up of the curtain as if she went to keep places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, after all, you are very partial to my ward, Beverley. She is severe upon your gaiety, and you rally her prudery. You both think it worth while to find fault with each other; and that's a dreadful symptom, Beverley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; not so far gone as that neither.—The girl has some good natural qualities; but she has not mixed with the world enough.—She is like one of our English coaches—made of good stuff, and not ill fashion'd—but wants the high Paris varnish, Denier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a good mind to acquaint her with your comparison.—She'll varnish you till you ap∣pear like lord Rusty's pictures—not much the better for it.—But, apropos to your simile,—after your coach has set you down to dinner in St. James's Street, can you send it to carry us to the opera?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure. They are not put up yet. I'll give orders about it immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay! Suppose it takes me home then; and I'll tell them your direction.—I shall hardly get a chair at this time in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it so. Good night to you.—But, Denier!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is to be another masquerade next week, at the Haymarket. Will you go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—hang it! next week is too soon for it.—So much of it makes it grow nauseous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be a genteel thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>A genteel masquerade!—Oh, that's the devil, Beverley. The company at a masquerade should be almost as various as the characters they
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
represent.—Countesses and sempstresses, lords, al∣dermen, blacklegs, and Oxonians.—Make your masquerade too genteel, and it must be very dull, Beverley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the fine women in town will be there. It is to be given by the club at Arthur's. I can supply you with tickets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you?—Well then—come, for once I will go with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, if you could prevail on Lydia to go too—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; she won't take the Paris varnish, Beverley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it. Then there's no hopes of her.</P>

<SP>

<P>Ten days ago I was of your opinion.—But those papers, Mr. Beverley, among which are copies of the last letters from Mr. Golding, will convince you that the danger is imminent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why—Why was not I more early apprised of this, Mr. Fable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a great deal on your hands, you know; and I did not care to interrupt your amuse∣ments, or damp your vivacity, till I had exa∣mined and settled the state of your affairs. I was in hopes, indeed, matters had not been so despe∣rate.—But one misfortune is always accompanied by another, and another followed by more.—The insurance not being done on the Speedwell and Thetis, owing to the miscarriage of Mr. Golding's letters from Bengal, the wreck of both those In∣diamen, as well as Mr. Golding's other losses in India; the failure of the houses at Amsterdam; the late run upon our own; and the bills we have accepted, being so soon payable—are unlucky circumstances, all concurring to perplex and em∣barrass us.</P>

<P>When you have look'd into the vouchers which Check has left with you, you will see the necessity of executing this instrument, constituting me your sole trustee and creditor; I having under∣taken to satisfy every other claim and demand upon the house.—All that concerns me is, that in order to come handsomely through this business, and to appear in earnest to the world, we must exact some co-operation on your part, some little sacrifi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es from you, Mr. Beverly.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sacrifices from me! what sacrifices, Mr. Fable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that I think they will affect you much neither. I was happy, to be sure, to see you keep∣ing the very best company, making a figure on the turf, regularly attending the hunt, and enter∣taining handsomely both here, and at Wimble∣don.—But people in business are liable to these accidents—and pleasure, you know, must give way when pressing exigencies require it. Put your horses to sale, part with your hounds, sell your villa—and as a narrower plan of living, a system of oeconomy, will render all the plate and present furniture unnecessary, I think it will be adviseable to let this house too. A smaller will serve to carry on the business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sell my horses and hounds! part with my houses! dispose of my plate, Mr. Fable! su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely this is being rather too precipitate. It should be very maturely considered, whether we cannot smo∣ther these evils, without letting them burst into a flame immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>That has been thoroughly considered, de∣pend upon't—nay, I have already convened the capi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al creditors, and convinced them of the cer∣tainty of their demands being satisfied, on the plan I have proposed to you. They are persuaded that the house will ultimately prove good and suf∣ficient,
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
and have engaged to support it. Some few indeed seemed to doubt your concurrence and per∣severance; but I (who think I know you better) undertook to answer for both. The truth is, you have no alternative.—The affair is publick by this time, and the eyes of the whole world are upon you—But courage, Beverly! you have youth, as I told you, and honour, and abilities. They are now put to the test, and I have no fear of your conduct.

<P>I thank you for your advice, but it distresses me at present, sir.</P>

<P>Well, well, I'll say no more then—I am glad to find matters not so bad as they have been reported. You'll keep your head above water yet, I hope.—I just staid to mention the affair of the twenty pounds you promised me the last time I saw you.</P>

<P>So, so! so! so!—This is <HI>the world,</HI> as they call it—A pack of hollow friends, and despicable ac∣quaintance! How weak have I been, to give my heart to these wretches, who have souls incapable of mutual attachment!—Callous to distress, and dead to the feelings of humanity!—How I long to see Denier! He is a true friend—frugal without ava∣rice, and chearful without dissipation. He would both advise and assist me.—He would pre∣sently—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Den.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have; I have, Beverley; and ran to you immediately—though I had particular business in the city too this morning—but a friend has pro∣mised to transact it for me. How are you, Be∣verley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a blow, my friend! from whom had you the first news of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Den.</SPEAKER>
<P>From Mr. Fable himself. He came to me on my own affairs, as well as about a large remit∣tance which he has just received on account of Lydia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lydia!—Oh Denier!—Lydia! <STAGE>(sighing)</STAGE>—a large remittance did you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Den.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, from her friends in India, who con∣signed her to our family. A very considerable re∣mittance, indeed—But Mr. Fable is made trustee, I find—They treat her as the court of Chancery does a lunatick. We are committees of her per∣son, and Mr. Fable committee of the estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, Denier; but the very shadow of mirth is at present unseasonable. I am glad, however, that Lydia is likely to be so amply pro∣vided for.</P>

<P>So am I: and I am glad too that you have always professed so total an indifference about her; as a disappointment from any reverse of for∣tune, in case you had fixed your affections on her, would have been an additional mortification.—But Beverly!</P>

<P>You are convinced, I believe, of the truth of my regard for you.</P>

<P>I think too, on your part, Beverley, that you would not, from a mere point of delicacy, op∣pose or repine at my happiness, if it did not inter∣fere with your own.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—to be sure I should not.—But what is all this? Explain.</P>

<P>You must know then, Beverley, that I began very early to be captivated with Lydia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Den.</SPEAKER>
<P>But fancying you entertained a partiality for her, I sinothered my inclination out of friend∣ship for you. But as you meant only superficial gallantry, I now wish to make her serious pro∣posals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proposals to Lydia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Den.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, proposals of marriage; and indeed it seems almost to have been the wish of her friends to bring about such an alliance by placing her in our family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true—that did not occur to me at first, I confess—she too, I suppose, has given you

<P>Thank you, my dear friend, thank you!—But come, come, Beverley! Mr. Fable's news has quite disheartened you. We must not see you too much cast down, neither. This is but a cloud.

<P>Not at present, I am obliged to you—not at present, Mr. Denier.</P>

my affection for you; and now to discover it, only to add to my wretchedness! Distraction!—Denier too seems to wear a different aspect—at least my imagination; jaundiced by my misfortunes, paints him of another colour.—But Lydia! after the im∣pertinence of my former behaviour, how despicable must I appear to her!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very serious affair indeed, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Serious! He's always serious, I think—preaching, preaching, for ever preaching: like lady Tott'nam, that builds all the Methodist chapels.—But it's a strange thing Mr. Golding should never write me word of all this business.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not yet examined the proofs, but dare say, Mr. Fable has just grounds for his pro∣ceedings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, lord! How this breaks into all my arrangements! The glass over my dressing∣room chimney-piece is stuck round with cards, one upon another—I am promised the whole town over for these three months. But it's no matter—they'll be the death of me—so it don't signify.</P>

<P>We must look forward, madam. The prospect is a little gloomy at present, but promises to clear again. No endeavours shall be wanting on my part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I dare say. You were always a good creature—a great favourite of mine you know always—But I can't tell what possessed them to make you a man of business. If they had been ruled by me, they would have put you into the guards. You would have made a sweet figure in a regimental: would not he, Lydia? And then you'd have had as little to do as Colonel Parade or Captain Gillyflower.—But I'll look into the red book—the only book worth looking into—and see if we can't use our interest to get you some little snug sinecure—a commissioner of trade, perhaps, or a lord of the admiralty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I begin to feel we have no dependance but on ourselves, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well—may be not, kinsman—and yet we have a very genteel set of acquaint∣ance.—But, mercy on me, what a figure do I make, if any body should call, in this muslin shade, and queen's night-cap! Lydia, my dear! let me leave you here a minute or two while I shuffle on my things—and then come to me in my dressing-room. Your conversation is better than hartshorn or lavender. Poor Beverley here looks as dismal as young lady Grizzle on her marriage with old sir Solomon.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, madam, if I venture to ex∣press how deeply I am sensible of your appearing to be affected by my misfortunes: and yet I can∣not but confess that I feel your compassion almost
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
as painfully as a reproach—for I am conscious I have not deserved it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Touched as I am with the reverse of your situation, Mr. Beverley, I will not dissemble to you that I am pleased with the change in your be∣haviour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still, still, this very approbation serves to reproach me with the impropriety of my late con∣duct towards you. I feel it. I request your for∣giveness of it; and should be happy to pass the rest of my life in endeavouring to atone it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make no apologies to me, Mr. Beverley; I have no right to expect them, nor has your con∣duct rendered them necessary: most young gentle∣men who pique themselves on their knowledge of the world, act much in the same manner as you behaved to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is too true; but it is not the swarm of coxcombs that renders them less impertinent or troublesome. I ought not to have adopted their contemptuous airs, without being master also of their tame insensibility; yet I had youth to plead in excuse for my vanities; and I flatter myself, that time and reflection—and another motive that distracts me when I think of it—might have ren∣dered me an object less unworthy your compassion. Calamity has torn the veil from my eyes, and I now see but too plainly, not only your excellence, but my own imperfections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Calamity is a severe master, yet amend∣ment can scarce be purchased too dearly: and as your errors have been venial, your distress may be but transient; nay, may, perhaps, at last be the means of your happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! Impossible! However I may be restored to affluence, I can never, never taste of happiness. I have thrown away—perhaps wan∣tonly too—I have thrown away the jewel that
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
should have been the pride and blessing of my life.—Oh, Lydia! the feelings of worldly distress are nothing to the agonies of a despairing affection. My situation extorts from me what I have hitherto endeavoured to conceal even from myself. I love you—I feel I long have loved you—though wretch and fool enough to be almost ashamed of a pas∣sion in which I ought to have gloried. I am now punished for it—heaven knows, severely punished—perhaps too severely—by losing the very hopes of ever obtaining you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not run from one dangerous extreme to another, Mr. Beverley; but guard against des∣pondency, as well as vanity and presumption. I see you are much agitated, much dejected; and what it would, perhaps, have been dangerous and unpardonable to have owned to you but yesterday, to-day I shall not scruple to declare. Hurried away, as you were, by a torrent of fashionable va∣nities, and the poor ambition of keeping high company, I thought I could discern in your mind and disposition no mean understanding, nor un∣generous principles—too good for the associates you had selected, and too susceptible not to be in danger from such society. It is no wonder, therefore, if I felt any growing partiality for you, that I endeavoured to restrain it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>To restrain it! Say rather to extinguish it. Oh, I now perceive all my wretchedness.—But to be supplanted by my bosom-friend! by Denier!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am at a loss to comprehend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>He confessed to me his passion for you but this very morning—not an hour ago he de∣clared to me his intention of making you serious proposals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such proposals would be sure of being re∣jected—rejected with the utmost indignation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do I hear? May I still hope then? And are you resolved not to listen to his ad∣dresses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am too well acquainted with his charac∣ter. His manners, indeed, are lively, and his worldly turn enables him to work himself into the friendship of others; especially, those like your∣self, Mr. Beverley—of an undesigning open-heart∣ed character; in order to avail himself of their foibles, promote his interest, and gratify his pe∣nury. Rely not too securely on the warmth of his professions! steady to no point but his interest, you will find him shifting in his conduct according to the revolutions in your fortune. He seemed at first desirous to unite me to you; but now, hearing, I suppose, of the alteration in your circumstances, and the late remittances in my favour, it is per∣fectly agreeable to his sentiments, to endeavour to supplant you. As yet, however, he has made me no overtures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far then at least he is not unfaithful. But Oh, my Lydia! may I interpret your repug∣nance to his addresses as an argument in my fa∣vour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already frankly declared my opinion of your character. It now remains with you to prove the truth of that opinion, and to determine my resolution accordingly. Do but bear up a∣gainst adversity, so as to shew yourself equal to the possible return of prosperity—a trial, perhaps, ten times more dangerous—and be assured, Mr. Beverley, that with the approbation of my friends, I shall be happy to give every proof of my esteem for so valuable a character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dearest Lydia! <STAGE>(kissing her hand)</STAGE> Mo∣dest, amiable, Lydia! When you avow esteem, let me presume to construe it affection! Oh Ly∣dia,
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
you have made me fond of my misfortunes. Ease and affluence corrupted me, and had so weakened and enervated my mind, that the rough stroke of adversity would have stunned me beyond the power of recovery, had not your gentle hand raised me to the hope of happiness. Take your pupil, Lydia; and render him—for you only can effect it—oh render him worthy of so dear, so exquisite a monitress!</P>

<P>I came on purpose to tell you; I came on purpose to abuse you, old Fable.</P>

<SP>

<P>I am obliged to you; but for what reason?</P>

<P>Impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trop.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Both are not in his power. Not to be cri∣minal, indeed, lies in his own breast; but suspicion and calumny, in the breasts and mouths of others. You consider yourself as an honest man, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zouns! I know I am, without considering at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, honest as you are, you could no more prevent my thinking you a rascal, were I in∣clined to believe you one, than I could hinder your calling me so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you all the world calls you so. It is the talk of the whole city—the Alley is full of it—the 'Change rings with it—and by and by, I suppose, the talkers in Leadenhall-street will harangue about it. You are pretty well paragraphed already, old Fable.</P>

<P>Most intimately so; most confidentially; or, at his departure for India, he would scarce have trusted his whole family and affairs to my care, with the particular charge of young Beverley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, did he so?—Now we are come to the point then.—And a fine guardian you have shewn yourself—a pretty friend to Mr. Golding too! You have staggered the credit of the house, driven the poor young fellow almost out of his senses, and made yourself his sole trustee and cre∣ditor.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trop.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lie!—Zouns! to what purpose?</P>
</SP>

<P>The young man was in the high road to destruction, and driving at such a rate that he must soon have overset the whole undertaking.—It was time to pull the check-string.—To speak plainly; intoxicated as he was by pleasure and vanity, and countenanced by Mrs. Golding, who ought to have discouraged him, direct advice would have been thrown away upon him. But, could I stand by a silent and inactive spectator of the ruin of a whole family? No; finding him incorrigible by
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
softer means, I conjured up the phantom of pover∣ty. The measures I have taken have already brought him to reason; he promises to become a new man; I shall ultimately appear to be a true friend; and the credit of the house will be more firmly established than ever.</P>

<P>I am speechless—struck dumb—you have taken my breath away—I have not a word to say against you—you are a very worthy, sensible, honest fellow, old Fable. You have redeemed your friend Golding, and will be the making of the young fellow's fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I can't take the credit of his reforma∣tion entirely to myself neither. He is in love, it seems, with a most amiable young lady, whose tenderness is redoubled by his misfortunes, while no calamity seems to affect his mind but the imaginary want of a fortune suitable to his pretensions to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trop.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how can you answer it to yourself, to retain his money in your hands, when he wishes to make so laudable a use of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't mean to retain it. Finding Bever∣ley in so fair a way of amendment, I have already set another wheel in motion, and (unknown to him) circulated a report of a sudden turn of fortune in his favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unknown to him, d'ye say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Totally; and it is pleasant enough to see how awkwardly he receives the civilities which are paid to him in consequence of this report, while, unconscious of the cause, he expects (according to the way of the world) nothing but slights and repreaches. To confirm the report, however, and to put him into good humour with himself again, I mean to send a pretended agent or messenger to him, with letters and considerable remittances, as from Mr. Golding. All I want is a trusty person to discharge such a commission.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, reasons may be assigned for his making use of another hand.—Besides, they won't be exa∣mined so nicely. You come to bring money, not to receive it—and that makes a wide difference. But we lose time.—Will you assist me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will—hand and heart—body and soul, old Fable. Let me have the stores, sails, masts, and rigging, and I'll fit him out as handsomely as any vessel I ever furnished in my life. You are a true-hearted, sound-bottomed fellow, old Fable. But what an ass have I made of myself!—Here did I come open-mouthed to reproach you for your roguery; and now you have persuaded me to be∣come your accomplice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>My ally—leagued in honour, not combined and confederated in villainy. But come with me to my closet, and I'll furnish you with the needful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ill follow you; but I must, I must ask your pardon first. It touched me to the quick to hear you were a rascal, and I could not help telling you so.—I beg your pardon again, and again, and again, my friend. You are one of the worthiest men in the world—but, you know, there are not a more silly, empty, insolent, impudent, ignorant, ly∣ing vermin, than your framers of common reports and collectors of personal paragraphs—wretches that pretend to know every thing, and know no∣thing. Your thoughts, words, and actions, they know them all; what you have done, what you are doing, and what you intend to do, they know: know what a papist tells his confessor, or the king whispers the queen: things that never have been,
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
will be, nor are like to be, still they know—true or false, right or wrong, praise or blame, they don't care a half-penny.—And I, to give a moment's cre∣dit to them! Forgive me this once, my friend; and for the future, without certain authority, I'll never believe a word I hear from common report, or depend upon a syllable I read in the news-papers.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, however, with a peculiar ill grace, sir, that you now pretend to discover in me these latent qualifications—You who seemed lately so desirous of recommending Mr. Beverley, and now, from what motive you know best, honouring me with your own addresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Beverley!—Beverley is convinced of my inviolable friendship for him—but it is no wonder, Lydia, that I, who had daily and hourly oppor∣tunities of comtemplating your perfections, should

be more deeply struck, than he that saw you but occasionally. I should not, however, such is my regard for him, have urged my own suit, without being previously assured of his absolute indif∣ference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indifference!—As to that, sir, Mr. Bever∣ley's indifference, or Mr. Beverley's partiality, in this instance, is not at all material. I am placed in your family, it is true; and my situation in life is not as yet positively ascertained. I was taught to believe, indeed, that I should ere now have been received and acknowledged by my friends: but I consider some late events as an earnest of their speedy appearance, and I trust they will offer no violence to my inclinations. I am determined, at least in my own breast; and be assured, sir, that no interest, no force, no time, shall shake my re∣solution.</P>
</SP>

<P>Your friends, madam, may possibly be of a different opinion; and though I might not wish them to put any constraint on you, they will hardly be partial to the ruinous state of poor Be∣verley.</P>
</SP>

<P>In you, sir, his intimate friend, such a re∣flection is particularly ungenerous: yet do not presume too much upon that notion, sir! What∣ever I may think of Mr. Beverley, fortune at least appears inclined to favour him.</P>

I love to husband my good offices: ay, ay! that's the true policy! to gain the good will of others, without touching your own property.—Make a small present to those that you are sure want nothing at all, and it turns to account, like money put out at high interest.—And ever, ever open your purse, and offer to lend to those who you know have no occasion to borrow!</P>

<P>On what subject?</P>

<P>Nay, nay; there is but one subject of any consequence now, you know. But I am afraid you dissembled with your friend a little. You should be frank and generous with me. The com∣merce of friendship can't subsist without it; and I have that title to the knowledge of what passes in your breast, Beverley.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Den.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to do you justice, I believe your not being explicit, arose from the agitation of your mind at that instant, rather than from want of sin∣cerity—and I was a little slow of apprehension on my part—but now we perfectly understand each other.—I see you love Lydia: I am sure of it—and out of friendship and regard to you, my dear Beverley—I frankly give up all my pretensions to her.</P>

<P>Your kindness overwhelms me. How shamefully was I disposed for a time to do injustice to friendship! I now despise the mean and narrow common-place maxims of our friends falling off from us. There is a jealousy in the unfortunate—an unworthy suspicion of neglect and contempt

<P>Spare your reproaches, Mr. Fable! They are needless. I know all my fault, and all my misery. Ruin and infamy now stare me in the face, and drive me to despair.

<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
this nation has ever shewn to the unfortunate?—Sometimes, indeed, to the imprudent?—Have you, sir, any claim to this? You, who have so grosly abused the mutual confidence between man and man, and betrayed the important trust reposed in you—What! a banker! a banker, Mr. Bever∣ley, not only squandering his own fortune, but playing with the property of others!—the pro∣perty of unconscious persons silently melting away, as if by forgery, under his hands, without their own prodigality!—And is such a man, because he is at length buried in the ruin he has pulled down on others, an object of compassion? No, sir, nothing is to be lamented but the mildness of his punishment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very atrociousness of his crime, the pungency of his guilt and remorse, which put him upon a rack severer than any penal laws could de∣vise, still render him an object of pity.</P>

<P>Your remorse and reformation, I fear, were but hypocrisy. Where was that ingenuous confidence that would else have prompted you to lay open this dark transaction, as well as the rest of your unjustifiable extravagance?

<P>Have mercy, Mr. Fable; consider my situation, and do not seek to aggravate the horrors of it—I who so lately thought myself in the road to prosperity, hoping to retrieve my fortune, and redeem my character, now shortly to be branded as the most faithless of beings, the basest of mankind! Distraction!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your situation, I own is dreadful; but by what an unpardonable complication of depravity have you brought it upon yourself, Mr. Beverley! Not content with one species of enormity, but in∣dustriously multiplying your ruin, and combining in yourself the double vices of a man of business, and a man of pleasure! Gambling the whole morning in the Alley, and sitting down at night to <HI>quinze</HI> and hazard at St. James's; by turns, making yourself a prey to the rooks and sharks at one end of the town, and the bulls and bears at the other! Formerly a young spendthrift was contented with one species of prodigality—but it was reserved for you and your precious associates to compound this new medley of folly, this olio of vice and extravagance, at once including the dis∣soluteness of an abandoned debauchee, the chi∣canery of a pettyfogger, and the dirty tricking of a fraudulent stock-jobbing broker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on; go on, sir! it is less than I merit, and I can endure it with patience. My late hu∣miliation
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
was but the prologue to my total ruin▪ The most desperate calamity cannot now make me more miserable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Beverley! did you but know the con∣solation I had in store for you, the schemes I had formed to make you easy in your circumstances, and happy in your love, you would still more re∣gret this cruel disappointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happy in my love!—Oh Lydia, I dare not even think of my presumption in having as∣pired to your favour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go young man! go to those friends on whom you formerly placed such reliance, and try what they will contribute to deliver you from ruin!—Leave me a while—studying to exert my weak endeavours to preserve my friend—or, if they fail, struggling to arm my mind with fortitude and patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where shall I direct myself? to whom shall I apply? My situation I fear is hopeless. The inhabitant of a dungeon, under sentence of execution, is in a state of happiness, to what I feel at this moment.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Fable <HI>alone.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Though he appears at this instant so very culpable, I cannot but be touched by his agitation and re∣morse.—Yet this is not a moment for passion, but reflection.—The ruin, if not prevented, so tho∣roughly overwhelming! The time so pressing! My friend absent! The property I can command, large and considerable as it is, not to be converted into specie directly!—What can be done?—Mr. Tropick must return me the money in his hands which I must now prevent his delivering, as well as the supposed letters to Beverley—yet that will be far, very sar from sufficient—how to make up the rest then!—There is one way indeed—but is that
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
warrantable? Lydia's trust money.—Have I a right, on any pretence whatever, to lay my hands but for a moment, on that sacred deposit?—And yet, where would be the injury? I am sure of re∣placing the sum before there is the least proba∣bility of its being demanded: and that resource, in conjunction with others already in my power, would supply every emergency. My absent friend would be rescued from certain ruin, even the trans∣gression of Beverley might be concealed from the world, and Lydia would fuffer no wrong, nor even be alarmed by suspicion.—It shall be so. I'll see this broker and settle the matter immediately.—And yet, my heart recoils at this transaction. The most pious frauds are at least ambiguous; and I feel it as the most cruel necessity to be driven to indirect means, even for the most generous pur∣poses.—But I have entangled myself by one crooked action, and I must endeavour to redeem all by another.</P>

<P>So shall I, I promise them. Ruined indeed! in my mind it is a monstrous piece of im∣pudence in these trumpery merchant-people to keep gentlefolks for their servants, like people of qua∣lity.—Mrs. Golding quotha'!—a gentlewoman of my genteel family—as wealthy a rope-maker's daughter as any in the city of Bristol! equal to Mrs. Golding, I hope, at any time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Equal, Mrs. Flounce! ay, and a great deal superiour. An old worn-out bit of beggar's∣tape, that binds the hem of quality!—imitating countesses and duchesses—endeavouring to adapt

<P>Well! service (as they say) is no inheritance, Mr. Handy—so I shan't go into place again—not I, truly—I have taken a house at Hogs∣den, and intend to set up a boarding-school to teach young ladies breeding.</P>

<P>And you'll have great success, I dare say, Mrs. Flounce.—As to me, my master was to have got me a good place in the India-House; or to have sent me out with the next cargo of judges and generals to Bengal.—But now he's ruined in the Alley, his interest I suppose is all gone—as well as his principal—eh, Mrs. Flounce! But this is always the case, when Lombard Street will travel to Pall Mall. Quite another latitude!

<P>Beverley, knowing me to be his friend, came to acquaint me with his distresses in the Al∣ley. The natural consequences of that adventure are obvious: and all my India concerns, remit∣tances, and money transactions coming through their house, it struck me with a panick; but by
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
good luck, he was scarce gone before I had no∣tice of Mr. Golding's return by letters from India, brought by the same ships in which he came over. I did not lose a moment. I dare say he had not once entered his doors when the officers met him, and perhaps Beverley himself is not yet apprised of his arrival. Am not I a man of dispatch, Mr. Capias?</P>

<P>And have you the deed ready, Capias?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here it is, sir, perused, signed, and set∣tled by old Steady, of Lincoln's-Inn—an excel∣lent workman—and if we can prevail on Mr. Golding to execute it, you'll come in for an ex∣clusive lien upon his effects, instead of compound∣ing with the other creditors under a commission of bankruptey, which I suppose will be taken out in less than these three days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Den.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—and under which they will not pay five shillings in the pound, perhaps—such a tum∣ble!—sign the deed! tell him he must sign it—His mind's unsettled yet, and he'll be easily per∣suaded—Besides, he'll be glad to serve a particular friend—It can't affect him, you know—the as∣signees will divide the remainder.—I have been a constant friend to the house—he'll be glad to re∣turn the obligation, and I shall fall upon my legs again.</P>

<P>Look ye, Fable, I don't know what to make of all this.—I don't understand you.—You may be an honest man, perhaps.—I hope you are an honest man; but you look very much like a rogue at present, I can tell you.—First of all, you employ me in a damned ridiculous business, in which I have made a cursed fool of myself—and that is scarce over, than in comes a note from you at a sponging-house, desiring me to come there, but not to ask for you by your own name. What's the meaning of all this, master Fable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>No harm, I assure you, friend. In regard to the business you mention, I meant to stop your going, if, unluckily, it had not been too late; and, as to your not asking for me here by my own name, I desired it, because I am not here in my own right, but as the representative of another person.</P>

<P>The writ was sued out against Mr. Gold∣ing, at the suit of Mr. Denier. I had but just settled some affairs very essential to Mr. Golding's interest; and did not know of his return till the moment I had placed him beyond danger. Com∣ing home, however, in the dusk of the evening, the catchpoles lay in wait near the house, touched me on the shoulder, and presented their authority. I readily obeyed, submitting to an arrest in the cha∣racter of Mr. Golding, and glad of an opportunity of exposing the false professions of a pretended friend to the family.</P>

<P>Come, come, this should be a day of ge∣neral happiness; as an instance of your universal good opinion of me, let me have influence enough to make peace between Mr. and Mrs. Golding; and as an earnest of their reconciliation, let them give their joint consent to unite Lydia and Beverley, and ratify their happiness!</P>

<P>Yes, I will own, my dear father, that the change in Mr. Beverley has removed the only ob∣jection that I could ever make to him; and I will

not blush to confess that the future happiness of my life depends on him.</P>

<P>Then every thing is adjusted. I give you joy, my friends.</P>

<P>And I give you joy too. You have puz∣zled me confoundedly, I confess—I said you were an honest fellow—I knew you were an honest fel∣low at bottom—but it was a damned long way to the bottom for all that, old Fable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>My conduct has been mysterious, I con∣fess, friend—perhaps, in some degree culpably so—but whenever I puzzled you, be assured I no less embarrassed myself. The least deviation from the strait path is attended with difficulties; and though I have always meant honestly, and thought I acted uprightly, I have had ample reason to ex∣perience the convenience and necessity, as well as the beauty of truth.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. BULKLEY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On account of the length of this Epilogue, many lines are omitted at the Theatre.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHEN plays are o'er, by Epilogue we're able,</L>
<L>Thro' moral strainers, to refine the fable;</L>
<L>Again the field of comedy to glean</L>
<L>From what the author did, or did not mean;</L>
<L>Or, in a gayer mood, on malice bent,</L>
<L>Quite topsy-turvy turn the bard's intent.</L>
<L>Shall we, ye criticks, to night's play deride?</L>
<L>Or shall we, ladies, take the milder side?</L>
<L>Suppose for once we leave the beaten road,</L>
<L>And try, by turns, the harsh and gentle mode;</L>
<L>A kind of critick country-dance begin;</L>
<L>Right hand and left, cross over, figure in!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The critick first strikes off, condemns each scene,</L>
<L>The tale, the bard, and thus he vents his spleen:</L>
<L>"While books lie open on each mouldy stall,</L>
<L>Bills plaister posts, songs paper ev'ry wall,</L>
<L>At ev'ry corner hungry minds may feed,</L>
<L>Wisdom cries out, and he that runs may read.</L>
<L>On learned alms were playwrights ever fed,</L>
<L>And scraps of poetry their daily bread.</L>
<L>Ev'n Shakespeare would unthread the novel's maze,</L>
<L>Or build on penny histories his plays.</L>
<L>From paltry ballads Rowe extracted Shore,</L>
<L>Which lay like metal buried in the ore.</L>
<L>To jump at once to bards of later days,</L>
<L>What are the riff-raff of our modern plays?</L>
<L><PB REF="85"/>
Their native dulness all in books intrench;</L>
<L>Mere scavengers of Latin, Greek, and French,</L>
<L>Sweep up the learned rubbish, dirt, and dust,</L>
<L>Or from old iron try to file the rust.</L>
<L>Give me the bard whose fiery disposition</L>
<L>Quickens at once, and learns by intuition;</L>
<L>Lifts up his head to think, and, in a minute,</L>
<L>Ideas make a hurly-burly in it;</L>
<L>Struggling for passage, there ferment and bubble,</L>
<L>And thence run over without further trouble;</L>
<L>Till out comes play or poem, as they feign</L>
<L>Minerva issued from her father's brain!</L>
<L>Be all original—struck out at once;</L>
<L>Who borrows, toils, or labours, is a dunce:</L>
<L>Genius, alas! is at the lowest ebb;</L>
<L>And none, like spiders, spin their own fine web.</L>
<L>What wonder, if with some success they strive</L>
<L>With wax and honey to enrich the hive,</L>
<L>If all within their compass they devour,</L>
<L>And, like the bee, steal sweets from ev'ry flower?</L>
<L>Old books, old plays, old thoughts will never do:</L>
<L>Originals for me, and something new!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"New? (cries the lady) Pr'ythee, man, have done!</L>
<L>We know there's nothing new beneath the sun.</L>
<L>Weave, like the spider, from your proper brains,</L>
<L>And take at last a cobweb for your pains!</L>
<L>What is invention? 'Tis not thoughts innate;</L>
<L>Each head at first is but an empty pate.</L>
<L>'Tis but retailing from a wea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thy hoard</L>
<L>The thoughts which observation long has stor'd,</L>
<L>Combining images with lucky hit,</L>
<L>Which sense and education first admit;</L>
<L><PB REF="86"/>
Who, borrowing little from the common store,</L>
<L>Mends what he takes, and from his own adds more,</L>
<L>He is original; or inspiration</L>
<L>Never fill'd bard of this, or other nation,</L>
<L>And Shakespeare's art is merely imitation.</L>
<L>For 'tis a truth long prov'd beyond all doubt,</L>
<L>Where nothing's in, there's nothing can come out.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Modes oft may change, and old give way to new,</L>
<L>Or vary betwixt London and Peru;</L>
<L>Yet here, and every where, the general frame</L>
<L>Of nature and of man is still the same:</L>
<L>Huge ruffs and farthingales are out of fashion;</L>
<L>But still the human heart's the seat of passion:</L>
<L>And he may boast his genius stands the test,</L>
<L>Who paints our passions and our humours best.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Censure not all; to praise let all aspire;</L>
<L>For emulation fans the poet's fire.</L>
<L>Put not one grand extinguisher on plays;</L>
<L>But with kind snuffers gently mend their blaze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While other licenc'd lotteries prevail,</L>
<L>Our bard, by ticklish lottery, tempts a sale,</L>
<L>Prints the particulars of his Musaeum,</L>
<L>And boldly calls the publick in to see 'em:</L>
<L>Their calculation must his fate reveal,</L>
<L>Who ventures all in the dramatick wheel.</L>
