<HEAD>THE
EARL OF DOUGLAS,
AN
ENGLISH STORY.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING could equal
his astonishment and joy at hear∣ing
his <HI>Julia,</HI> so long lamented,
was still alive;—that she had
been educated in his own reli∣gion,
and was one of the most
accomplished works of nature.—
The ardency of his desire to be∣hold
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
her, would not have suffer∣ed
him to defer that indulgence
a moment, if he could have met
with a ship bound to <HI>England,</HI>
and if he had been master of his
own actions. He begged <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
to give him a particular
detail of the state of government
and religion of his country,
which he complied with, enu∣merating
every thing that had
happened till the accession of
Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER a long and serious re∣flection
on the various vicissitudes
in church and state, the earl
thought it most eligible to return
to <HI>Venice,</HI> and endeavour to reap
some reward for a long and pain∣ful
captivity, the result of his
attachment to the service of the
republick. He had no doubt
but his daughter was in a happy
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
situation with the countess of
<HI>Douglas;</HI> the generous cares be∣stowed
on her infancy, were a
security to him that her future
kindness would not be less servent,
and not conceiving there could
be any exigence which required
his immediate presence, he de∣dermined
to write to his friends
in <HI>England,</HI> whilst he prosecuted
his interest at <HI>Venice</HI> with all his
power.</P>
<P>HE communicated this plan
to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who was not sorry
he delayed his departure for
<HI>England;</HI> who knows, said he to
a gentleman in whom he ven∣tured
to confide, though placed
near him by his father, who
knows but if the earl of <HI>War∣wick</HI>
returned to <HI>London,</HI> my fa∣mily
might press him to dispose
of <HI>Julia.</HI>—The task would be far
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
more difficult to resist the com∣mands
of her own father than of
mine, and in my absence, a
proposal of that nature may be
attended with dreadful conse∣quences.
This way of thinking
led him to confirm the earl as
much as possible in his resolu∣tion;
and from that moment,
they contracted the strictest and
tenderest friendship that can pos∣sibly
be imagined between two
men of exalted merit, with only
this distinction, that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
behaved to the earl with a re∣spectful
regard and deference,
which might have surprized those
who were ignorant of his mo∣tive.
His purse was no longer
his own, but his friend's; and
he generously regarded what he
drew from it for his own use, as
a present the earl bestowed,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
whom delicacy taught him to
consider as the proprietor.</P>
<P>THE desire of being useful to
the earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> held the
sorrows of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> in a state
of suspension; and the charms
of his conversation, asswaged in
some measure the poignancy of
that grief which had hitherto
known little intermission. Af∣ter
a prosperous voyage they ar∣rived
at <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>HERE the captain told <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
he trusted his inte∣rest
in regard to the ransom
of <HI>Muley,</HI> for he did not suspect
him to be an <HI>Englishman,</HI> and
would leave it entirely to his ma∣nagement.
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> on his
side, acted with equal generosity,
by▪ presenting him with four
hundred pistoles, his mother's
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
parting gift, adding that he
wished it was in his power to en∣large
the sum for the release of a
man he esteemed so much; and
as a testimony of the grateful
sense he entertained of the cap∣tain's
civility and politeness.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Leghorn Hyppolitus</HI> urged
the earl to write to <HI>Julia,</HI> who
had no occasion for entreaty to
indulge his parental tenderness
in the delightful effusions of
sensibility.—He wrote by the
same pacquet to Lord and Lady
<HI>Douglas,</HI> a full account of his
misfortunes and situation, and
expressive of his gratitude for
their favours to his <HI>Julia.</HI>—
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> likewise added a let∣ter
to his father, but he made up
a separate pacquet, directed to
the earl of <HI>Sussex;</HI> of which the
most important part was a letter
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
to his adored mistress. He did
not expect to hear from them till
he got to <HI>Florence,</HI> where his fa∣ther
had appointed him to re∣side;
and had wrote in the most
pressing manner to Senator <HI>Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti,</HI>
conjuring him to inspect
the conduct of a son he so ten∣derly
loved. The earl and <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
after a short stay at
<HI>Leghorn,, Lucca,</HI> and <HI>Pisa,</HI> ar∣rived
at <HI>Florence</HI> in the most per∣fect
harmony and friendship for
each other.</P>
<P>WHILST things were in this
situation with <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> his
<HI>Julia's</HI> health and tranquillity
were greatly interrupted;—grief
preyed on the roses of her cheeks;
—the lustre of her eyes were
faded▪ and her person so emaci∣ated,
she could scarcely be known.
Far from dissipating her melan∣choly
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
by company and diver∣sions,
she shut herself up in her
appartment, and had no mo∣ments
of satisfaction but those:
she passed with her dear <HI>Lucilla;</HI>
or when her good fortune brought
the earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> to the castle;
whose visits were very rare, from
the fear of encreasing the suspi∣cions
of Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI> who
had absolutely forbid <HI>Julia</HI> to
converse with him.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> after<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
being many days in extreme dan∣ger,
was removed from <HI>Buck∣ingham</HI>
in a litter, as soon as it
was thought safe for him to en∣dure
the motion. The countess
his mother, had been long soli∣citous
to have him at her house,
but before he left the castle, he
requested Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> to per∣mit
him to take leave of <HI>Julia:</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
this was a favour not to be ob∣tained.
She resolutely refused to
grant such a mark of complai∣sance
to the entreaties of the fa∣mily,
and desired them to con∣duct
her to a <HI>French</HI> convent, as
she was determined upon a reli∣gious
life. But they gave no cre∣dit
to her assertions, and did not
doubt, should they comply with
her desire, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> would find
some method to see her, and o∣verturn
all the precautions they
had taken to prevent any farther
intercourse. Sometimes under
the pretext of affection, and
sometimes by a formal refusal,
they apparently discovered their
determination was that she must
either remain in confinement, or
marry to be free.</P>
<P>A PROCEEDING so rigorous,
renewed all her afflictions.—I
am then a slave, my dear <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
said she, I am even refused per∣mission
to fly to a convent! to
enjoy the liberty of indulging my
just grief! I am to live in per∣petual
restraint;—obliged to
controul the motions of my heart
—of my countenance;—sur∣rounded
by persons whose pre∣sence
importunes and distresses
me! Alas! to what can I be
reserved! I who am a singular
instance of being refused devo∣voting
myself to <HI>God!</HI> Who
ever opposed a religious vocati∣on?
Nay, how many wretched
beings are forced into convents
against their inclinations?—
For me alone, all rules are re∣versed!
—My misfortunes seem
to rejoice the authors of them!
These contending passions in∣jured
both body and mind.—
Resentment frequently got the
better of her natural sweetness of
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
temper; whilst <HI>Lucilla,</HI> gave her
the only▪ comfort in her power,
by partaking her grief. Equal∣ly
sensible and prudent, she col∣lected
all the arguments that
could tend to appease her, and
was assiduous in painting future
prospects of blessings capable of
giving her pleasure.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS, in the mean
time, waited on Senator <HI>Alberti,</HI>
whom he found exceedingly dis∣posed
to fulfil Lord <HI>Douglas's</HI>
most sanguine expectations.—
A few days after, he invited him
and the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> to <HI>Ca∣jané,</HI>
a seat built by <HI>Lorenzo de
Medicis,</HI> where was assembled all
that taste and magnificence could
collect of curious and beautiful.
<HI>Cosmo,</HI> the reigning duke, was
gone to pass some time there.—
He expressed great concern that
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could not
stay longer in his dominions, and
received <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> in a manner
capable of flattering his ambi∣tion,
and of affording him a sen∣sible
joy, if his mind would
have suffered him to relish any
thing but affection. His sadness
a mazed the court;—he per∣ceived
it, but not being able to
conceal it, he entreated <HI>Alberti</HI>
to shorten the visit.</P>
<P>THE earl and countess of <HI>Doug∣las</HI>
were not under equal inquie∣tude;
the so much wished for re∣moval
of their son, allowed them
that repose of which they had
been so long deprived; their
principal anxiety now, was to
gain the absolute direction of the
mutual correspondence of the
lovers. The morning <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
left <HI>England,</HI> indulged him with
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
a parting farewell, less to com∣pose
his mind by that consola∣tion▪
than as a means of disco∣vering
how this correspondence
was to be regulated, To attain
that knowledge, the countess or∣dered
one of her women to con∣ceal
herself behind a door, only
covered with the tapestry of the
room, where she might hear and
see all that passed. From her
they learned the letters were to
be addressed to the earl of <HI>Sus∣sex.</HI>
The difficulty was how to
intercept them, a thing not ab∣solutely
impracticable, where cu∣riosity
is powerful, and no ex∣pence
spared for its gratification.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> gained over the
master of the pacquet, that
brought the foreign mails, and
was certain by his means to
receive all letters from <HI>Italy</HI> di∣rected
to the earl of <HI>Sussex.</HI> On
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
the other side, he had recourse
to the <HI>English</HI> envoy, his inti∣mate
friend, to try all methods
of rendering himself master of
the letters directed to his son.—
He informed him in general, of
his falling in love with a young
woman of no fortune; and that
he had sent him abroad in hopes
of curing his passion, for which
purpose, he should put in prac∣tice
all the stratagems he could
invent, to recall him to duty.—
He conjured the envoy to assist
his designs, as the happiness of
his son depended on it.</P>
<P>THE first pacquet Lord <HI>Doug∣las</HI>
received at <HI>London,</HI> was from
<HI>Leghorn,</HI> containing letters from
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Hyppo∣litus,</HI>
with the astonishing news
of the earl's providential escape,
a fact not to be doubted when
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
attested under his own hand.—
He did not think it proper <HI>Julia</HI>
should be informed of this happy
event. It will arm her with
weapons to oppose us, said he to
the countess, when we recom∣mend
any advantageous match,
the natural excuse will be, she
must now wait the return and
approbation of her father! And
as the earl mentions with warmth
his recent obligations to <HI>Hyppo∣litus,</HI>
who probably has made
him▪ the confident of his passion
for <HI>Julia,</HI> he will hardly be per∣swaded
to act against the inclina∣tion
of the friend he loves.</P>
<P>AFTER communicating these
reflexions, they agreed it was ne∣cessary
to keep the secret from
<HI>Julia,</HI> and to employ every art
to intercept the correspondence
of these tender and unfortunate
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
lovers. Accordingly, the con∣cealed
the pacquet to the earl of
<HI>Sussex;</HI> and sorged letters to him,
to <HI>Julia,</HI> and <HI>Lucilla,</HI>—In that
to the earl, he tells him of being
wounded in his right hand, in
an engagement at sea, which o∣bliges
him to employ a friend to
write; a fallacy to accustom
them from the first to a different
hand writing; and as a farther
imposition on their credulity,
the style of a faithful absent lo∣ver
was imitated to the utmost
perfection.</P>
<P>THEY likewise answered the
real letters from <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> in
terms the most likely to con∣vince
him there was no decep∣tion,
and to remove all sus∣picion
from the difference of
character, they told him they had
all agreed to vary their writing,
lest, by any accident, their let∣ters
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
might fall into other hands,
who would then remain igno∣rant
of the authors.</P>
<P>THIS plan occasioned a se∣cond
letter to the <HI>English</HI> envoy,
to entreat him to intercept the let∣ters
directed to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> unless
sealed with such an impression
as he sent him a copy of. Those
so sealed were to be delivered to
his son, and all others returned
under cover, to the earl of <HI>Doug∣las.</HI>
Thus master of the corres∣pondence,
his dexterity was solely
employed in directing it to the
point he intended. An air of
coldness was insensibly diffused
on both sides. <HI>Julia</HI> was wretch∣ed.
—Ah my sister! said she
to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> your brother's passion
no longer exists! observe with
what indifference he writes!—
he lets several mails arrive with∣out
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
any news of him;—and
when he does let me hear from
him, there is such an apparent
constraint in his style, as shews
his professions of friendship and
remembrance, are rather the dic∣tates
of civility and politeness,
than the voluntary effusions of
the heart: he is no more the
same <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> my sister! con∣tinued
she; alas, he is changed
indeed! After these moments
of agony, she would sink into
a state of stupefaction that had
something horrid in it. <HI>Lucilla</HI>
exerted her utmost eloquence
to justify her brother's integrity
and constancy, though she was
convinced herself of his infide∣lity,
and was greatly hurt by the
levity of his conduct.</P>
<P>WHILST these amiable friends
passed their nights in anguish,
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
and wrote a thousand reproachful
upbraiding letters to the unfor∣tunate
<HI>Hyppolitus:</HI> he was not
in a more tranquil situation than
themselves. Before the earl of
<HI>Warwick</HI> left <HI>Venice,</HI> he recounted
to him all that had happened at
the castle, and engaged him to
acquiesce in his sentiments, and
to promise his beautiful daughter
should be only his.</P>
<P>VAIN▪ was it that he described
his transports to his charming
mistress, when they hid e∣very
thing▪ from her eyes, but
words that penetrated her soul
with grief! And <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> re∣ceived
replies where formality
and distrust were blended, so e∣vidently
as to occasion him the
most cruel alarms.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
I HAVE already taken notice
that he met with a thousand
marks of consideration and re∣spect
from the sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor <HI>Alberti,</HI>
who had a son about the same
age with <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> whose name
was <HI>Leander:</HI> he was handsome,
agreeable, had wit, politeness,
and the most gentle and engaging
behaviour. These two cavaliers
felt an immediate propensity to
contract a friendship. There
was such an agreement of hu∣mour
and disposition between
them, that at first sight, sympa∣thy
acted powerfully, and time
formed so complete a union, that
they concealed nothing from
each other, but communicated
their most secret thoughts and
reflexions. It may be naturally
concluded, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> made <HI>Le∣ander</HI>
a circumstantial recital of
his passion for <HI>Julia.</HI>—He spoke
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
of her in terms so rapturous as
were enough to kindle a flame in
the breast of his friend.—He ex∣patiated
with all the extrava∣gance
of an enamoured heart, on
the charms and perfections of
his mistress: never was beauty,
he exclaimed, softened with
sweetness and delicacy like her's!
with an understanding so inform∣ed
—so refined! and a soul sub∣lime,
Yet tender! In short,
she is all enchanting excellence!
How fortunate are you, my dear
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> said <HI>Leander,</HI> in the
affection of a woman so accom∣plished!
—For my part, I have
not yet tasted the pleasures of a
tender engagement.—The wo∣men
here are all coquets,—who
encourage universal addresses,—
and are unsusceptible of love,
yet are cruel to none.—Ah!
what dangerous syrens! replied
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
<HI>Hyppolitus;</HI> I loved <HI>Julia</HI> before
I was sensible of itmyself,—
and she has been the only object
of my attachment;—it is not
therefore from experience that I
regard women of that class in a
formidable light, but I confess
to you their insensibility of heart,
and inequality of humour, with
that unbounded fondness for ad∣miration,
makes me extremely
concerned for those who are en∣tangled
in their snares. At the
conclusion of such conversations
he would unfasten the bracelet of
<HI>Julia's</HI> hair, and imprint on it
a thousand kisses of tenderness!
he would expect the day of the
courier's arrival with inconceiv∣able
impatience. The <HI>English</HI>
envoy never neglected to serve
his friend, Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI> with
great punctuality; so that <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
regularly received the
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
counterfeit letters, instead of the
true, and his inquietude aug∣mented
in proportion to the cold∣ness
of the sentiments he read,
which the feelings of his own
heart so little deserved: Shall I
tell you the fatal effects of ab∣sence?
said he to <HI>Leander,</HI> sor∣rowfully,
the more mine is
lengthened, the more <HI>Julia's</HI> in∣difference
encreases. Ah! too
cruel absence that effaces my
image in the heart I love!</P>
<P>LEANDER endeavoured to pre∣vail
with his friend to reside some
time at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice.</HI> No,
said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> let me remain
here; it is indifferent to my fa∣ther
where I am, if I am not in
<HI>England:</HI> and <HI>Florence</HI> is rather
less distant from it than the cities
you mention. I am insensible to
all the beauties of art and nature,
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
till I am restored to the sight of
her who excells them all! no o∣ther
charms are capable of effect∣ing
me—All my passions are
absorbed in the love I feel for
that amiable woman.—I am
lost to every thing but grief!
Notwithstanding the constancy
of my adoration, you see my
friend, she kills me with her
congealing expressions. And for
that reason, replied <HI>Leander,</HI> I
am desirous to divert you for a∣while
from the indulgence of that
black melancholy which induces
you to shun society.—I ought no
longer to conceal from you, that
the court regards you as a mere
misanthorpe.—Every one en∣quires
the reason.—The ladies
are very clamorous in their in∣vectives;
—at least my <HI>Hyppo∣litus,</HI>
let your complaisance ren∣der
you more sociable.—Alas!
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
said he, it is neither in my power
or inclination to act otherwise
than I do! Let me, my dear
<HI>Leander,</HI> let me enjoy the liberty
of complaining. Seek not to
restrain my sorrows, to mourn
unmolested, is an advantage few
people will choose to envy me!</P>
<P>A YEAR had been dragged
on in this manner, and Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> congratulated himself on
the success of his measures.—
But he could not avoid observing
with peculiar vexation, in all the
letters he opened, that absence
had wrought no effect on the
hearts of <HI>Julia▪</HI> and <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>
That their affection was to strong
to be weakened by time; and
that every line was expressive of
an inviolable faith capable of
resisting death itself. The ap∣prehension
that some unforeseen
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
accident might destroy the de∣sign
he had been so assiduous in
labouring to complete, induced
the earl, without delay, to visit
the <HI>Florentine</HI> ambassador, and
explain to him the uneasiness he
suffered, from his son's per∣severance
in an attachment that
neither his commands, nor ab∣sence,
had made the least im∣pression
upon. He then request∣ed
his assistance in a scheme he
would communicate. The am∣bassador
expressed himself ready
to oblige him,—and joined in
the composition of letters from
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> from the <HI>English</HI> en∣voy,
the Marquiss <HI>de Neri,</HI> and
the Senator <HI>Alberti.</HI> The pur∣port
of the first was to ask his
father's consent to a marriage
with <HI>Signiora de Neri,</HI> a girl of
quality, allied to several of the
first and most illustrious families
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
in <HI>Italy,</HI> and from whom, as
heiress, she had great expecta∣tions.</P>
<P>THIS was accompanied with
her picture, which being a fan∣cied
production, the painter's
imagination was left at liberty to
make as beautiful as he pleased;
—and indeed, it might be con∣sidered
as the very model of per∣fection.
The Senator <HI>Alberti</HI>
wrote in positive terms to Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> that his son was so dis∣tractedly
in love with the lady,
a refusal might cost him his life.
The <HI>English</HI> envoy informed his
lordship that he was perfectly
convinced of the great advantages
to be expected from an alliance
with <HI>Signiora de Neri,</HI> The mar∣quiss
of <HI>Neri's</HI> letter was in the
politest strain, acquainting him
in a careless way, of his daugh∣ter's
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
preference for <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
in return for his strong attach∣ment
he had professed; and that
he could not resist their united
importunities to mention the
subject to him; and assure him he
should feel a singular joy in ac∣cepting
the honour of such a
connection, if he was so happy
as to find it equally agreeable to
the earl of <HI>Douglas.</HI></P>
<P>THINGS thus concerted, one
day when Lord <HI>Sussex</HI> was at din∣ner
with the family, a message
from the <HI>Florentine</HI> ambassador,
desiring leave to wait on the earl
of <HI>Douglas</HI> was delivered. He
politely desired the ambassador to
fix his own time, and should ex∣pect
the honor he intended him
with impatience. Presently af∣ter
his name was announced,
when <HI>Julia,</HI> who avoided all
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
strangers, rose up to retire; but
as the scene was designed for her
observation, the countess whis∣pered
her, that it would not be
well-bred for <HI>Lucilla</HI> and her to
leave the room the time she stayed.
When the first compliments
were over, the ambassador told
his lordship he wished to con∣verse
with him on an affair of
consequence, relating to <HI>Hyppo∣litus.</HI>
My lord desired he would
speak without reserve, as there
were none present but his wife,
daughters, and his son's most in∣timate
friend. The embassador,
who played his part extremely
well, presented him the pacquet,
which Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> first run o∣ver
to himself, when raising his
voice, This is not an affair,
madam, said he to the countes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
that requires secrecy! Here is
what they write to me, (begin∣ning
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
to read aloud) when
spying the box that contained
the picture, he opened it, and
appeared struck with its extreme
beauty.—The countess was
charmed;—and the ambassador
was lavish in assurances that the
soul of <HI>Signiora de Neri,</HI> was e∣qual
to her person. He entreat∣ed
his lordship to favor the pas∣sion
of two lovers whose affec∣tion
was so sincere and ardent,
and not to retard the completion
of their felicity. O <HI>Heavens!</HI>
who can describe the feelings of
the wretched <HI>Julia</HI> during this
cruel conversation! She made
a violent effort on her heart, by
taking the picture; but in cast∣ing
her eyes upon those charms,
fatal to her repose, her rival's
beauty appeared so superior,—
and grief assaulted her so power∣fully,
that the picture dropped
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
from her hand.—Pale-faint mo∣tionless
she sunk on the floor!
At so sad a spectacle, persons of
less obduracy than the earl and
countess of <HI>Douglas,</HI> must have
been touched with compassion!
They did not seem the least
moved, but ordered her to be
carried to her chamber, where
<HI>Lucilla</HI> and the earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI>
bathed her face with their tears;
and notwithstanding all the ap∣plications
used to recover her, it
was four hours before she could
be said to live.</P>
<P>JULIA at length opened her
eyes, with a look of fixed amaze∣ment.
—Neither words or tears
found a passage.—She closed
them again, and continued silent.
Said <HI>Lucilla,</HI> tenderly embracing
her, do not consider this as an ir∣remediable
misfortune?—<HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
is not married;—he may
repent his inconstancy,—should
he return to a sense of honour,
how is it possible he can abandon
you? And if he remains in∣sensible,
will you die for an un∣grateful
man, and leave me a
prey to despair and grief?</P>
<P>THE earl joined his arguments
and entreaties to those of <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
but <HI>Julia</HI> did not discover the
smallest sign that they made the
least impression, and as it grew
late, the earl found himself o∣bliged
to leave her without the
satisfaction of hearing her speak.
<HI>Lucilla</HI> watched by her all night
in tears.—The earl returned in
the morning;—he learned from
<HI>Lucilla</HI> that her friend had not
been prevailed with to take the
least sustenance, and deaf to all
intercession, would not deign to
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
open her eyes, or utter a sylla∣ble.
He went immediately to
Lord and Dady <HI>Douglas,</HI> who
expressed neither surprize nor
sorrow at his pathetic description
of the effects of her despair:—
coldly answering hunger would,
undoubtedly, in time oblige her
to eat; and that lovers had less
appetites than other people—
What, said the earl, in a fierce
and angry tone, do you add in∣sults
to the afflictions you have
brought upon this lovely girl?
can you think a conduct so oppo∣site
to humanity and justice will
not some time or other, spread
your face with blushes? He ad∣ded
solicitations to their re∣proaches,
both equally ineffica∣cious,
and returned to the ap∣partment
of <HI>Julia</HI> in the deepest
distress.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36"/>
HE then joined <HI>Lucilla's</HI> re∣peated
requests that she would
take some food, when opening
her languishing eyes, she spoke
these words, in a voice broken
with sighs and groans:</P>
<P>“MY dear sister, and you my
generous friend, cease to per∣swade
me to take any refresh∣ment.
I am infinitely obliged
to you for these proofs of ten∣der
solicitude; but I hope very
soon to arrive at the last scene of
a wretched existence.—Ah! bar∣barous
<HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> (she exclaim∣ed)
inhuman! How have I de∣served
from thy hand, such cruel
treatment?—Where are the
vows and oaths thou wert once
so lavish of! No! thou never
couldst love! And am I so weak
and mean-spirited to afflict my∣self
thus for a faithless betrayer?”
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
Here the vehemence of her ex∣pression
exhausted her strength;
she persevered in silence and ab∣stinence,
declining to take the
least restorative.</P>
<P>Two days fasting, had reduced
her extremely low, and the earl
of <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> too plainly
convinced of her intention, found
it expedient to alarm her on the
side of conscience.—They knew
the tenderness and delicacy of her
scruples, where religion was
concerned, and after acquainting
her confessor with the situation
of her mind, they left him to
admonish her. His authority
had greater influence than all the
tears of <HI>Lucilla,</HI> or the supplica∣tions
of the earl of <HI>Sussex. Julia</HI>
promised to be obedient to the
injunctions of a man whom she
had always considered with reve∣rence;
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
and when he was gone,
she begged her friends would not
condemn her too unkindly for so
obstinately refusing to comply
with their request: assuring them
it did not arise from any defect
in friendship, but was entirely
the work of despair. I am now
convinced it is not permitted me
to shorten the term of life allot∣ted
by the supreme <HI>Being,</HI> who
will one day demand a strict ac∣count
of my actions. I must
live—continued she, I must live
to be exquisitely miserable! But
since to drag on a wretched life
is injoyned me, I would wish to
conceal from the ungreatful <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
the poignancy of the an∣guish
his perfidy has occasioned.
—Ah! sister, if I may flatter
myself with the thought of being
dear to you! give me a proof of
it by never naming me more to
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
your cruel brother? Or, if that
cannot be dispensed with, tell
him I scorned to shew any marks
of affliction at the news of his
infidelity.—That indifference
has succeeded to disdain, and
that the name of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> is
banished from my lips! I have
the same favour to ask of you,
sir, turning to the earl, do not
expose my mortal wounds to
publick view.—I confide in
your honour.—May I hope you
will not betray me? They both
promised all she desired, and
were transported to find she would
endeavour to preserve a life they
valued so much.</P>
<P>SEVERAL days passed without
any remarkable occurrence—
The earl's and <HI>Lucilla's</HI> letters
were filled with the most severe
reproaches, and had he really
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
been the guilty wretch they be∣lieved
him, their arguments were
forcible enough to have recalled
him to his allegiance. But he
never received these any more
than the preceding ones. <HI>Julia</HI>
sometimes indulged the sweet
hope that her lover might repent
his falshood, and not complete
the marriage. She could not
forbear telling <HI>Lucilla,</HI> that not∣withstanding
the unjustifiable be∣haviour
of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> she felt
herself disposed to pardon his re∣turning
love.—But alas! said
she, the unparalleled charms of
<HI>Signiora de Neri,</HI> blast all my
hopes that he will ever return to
me!</P>
<P>THIS reflexion plunged her
again in grief; nor did <HI>Lucilla</HI>
concur in cherishing such ill∣founded
hopes, as could only
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
serve to renew tender emotions,
which tormented her, without a
prospect of happier events.</P>
<P>LET us try to forget <HI>Hyppoli∣tus,</HI>
my dear sister, said this sin∣cere
friend, you ought to abhor
him, and though he is my bro∣ther,
I am an enemy to his con∣duct.
Forget,—abhor him!
Ah, <HI>Lucilla!</HI> am I mistress of
my sentiments? A soul prepos∣sessed
with the sweet idea of lov∣ing
and being beloved;—con∣firmed
in it by habit;—an inge∣nuous
simple heart that has en∣gaged
its too easy faith;—can it
be expected these should be ca∣pable
of relinquishing a rooted
passion, as soon as suspicion points
at deceit?—But how still more
deplorable is my destiny! con∣vinced
I have for ever lost that
faithless deceiver! industrious in
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
the art of self-tormenting.—
I recollect every word I heard
him speak;—every thing I saw
him do.—He is unceasingly
present before my eyes.—I
discover, and ruminate on a thou∣sand
instances of his incompara∣ble
merit.—All, all, concur to
overwhelm me with regret! with
unutterable woe!—Alas! my
dearest sister, nothing can ex∣ceed
my unhappiness! It is im∣possible
for you to comprehend
the anguish and horror of a situ∣ation
you never experienced!</P>
<P>THE circumstance <HI>Julia</HI> so
much dreaded the confirma∣tion
of, (the marriage of <HI>Hyppo∣litus</HI>)
arrived at the time Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> had ordained it should.
The fatal sound drew blood from
her heart.—Yet, though she
sometimes suffered a gleam of
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
hope to soothe her sorrows, she
had expected the stroke that was
to confirm them for ever. See∣ing
her misfortune past remedy,
she returned to her former inten∣tion
of retiring to a convent,
where she might languish out her
wretched days. But a spark of
vanity objected.—What, shall
I renounce the world, said she to
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> for the sake of a worth∣less
lover; and gratify his pride
by offering such a sacrifice to his
memory? No, the thought is
insupportable! Cost what it
may, he shall not have the satis∣faction
of triumphing in the be∣lief
of my unhappiness! Since
the earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI> passion is
proof against all the rigor I have
treated him with, I will reward
his perseverance, and sacrifice my
repose to my self-love.—This
is a rash and inconsiderate reso∣lution,
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
my dear <HI>Julia,</HI> inter∣rupted
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> you will not sure
present your hand to a man you
cannot love? Think of the a∣larming
consequences of such a
detestable engagement? I com∣prehend
them all, said she mourn∣fully,
but I also see that this step
will prevent your brother from
discovering my sensibility, and
weakness in his favour. He
shall have reason to believe my
affection for him as variable as
his for me; and I please myself
with his being mortified in sup∣posing
I set him an example of
inconstancy.</P>
<P>THE prayers and arguments of
<HI>Lucilla</HI> lost their efficacy on this
occasion; and as the countess of
<HI>Douglas</HI> omitted no opportunities
to inform herself of the senti∣ments
of <HI>Julia,</HI> she no sooner
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
found her more favourably dis∣posed
towards the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI>
than she was eager to let him
know it; and did not lose a mo∣mant
to confirm <HI>Julia</HI> in her new
resolution.—My dear daugh∣ter,
said she, though your re∣gard
for the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> does
dot exceed that of a friend, you
have so high a sense of virtue,
and he adores you, if I may use
the expression, to such a super∣lative
degree, that gratitude and
duty will effect in his favour what
tenderness would have induced
you to bestow on another.</P>
<P>JULIA listened to her in pro∣found
silence, and when she
thought civility obliged her to
reply, only said, “That when
she formed the resolution of ac∣cepting
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> she
hoped at the same time to be ca∣pable
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
of fulfilling her duty.”—
Orders were given with the ut∣most
diligence for the necessary
preparations of this long-desired
ceremony.</P>
<P>THE fatal day arrived. <HI>Julia</HI>
was dressed in a silver brocade,
with roses scattered carelesly o∣ver
it;—her diamonds were set
in the most elegant taste, and her
fair hair adorned with flowers.
—she never appeared so beauti∣ful!
The sweet langour of her
countenance;—the paleness of
her complexion, gave a delicacy
that rather added to, than di∣minished
the graces of her per∣son.
The earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> could
scarce believe this unexpected
transition from misery to happi∣ness
real! His joy was extra∣vagant;
—but all his transports,
—his love, his constancy,—
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
made no impression on the heart
of <HI>Julia.</HI> The marriage was
celebrated at <HI>Buckingham:</HI> the
ball-room was crouded in the
evening with people of the first
fashion, who all remarked the
deep melancholly of the fair vic∣tim;
some attempted to divert
her with the sallies of their wit,
but her answers were equally
short to the gay and the serious
part of the company.</P>
<P>THE earl had been that mor∣ning
informed of all that related
to the birth of <HI>Julia,</HI> as it was
judged improper he should marry
her as the earl of <HI>Douglas's</HI> daugh∣ter,
though he wished that cir∣cumstance
still to remain a secret
to the world. Instead of making
their publick appearance at court.
The earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> carried his
bride into <HI>Berkshire,</HI> where he
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
had a castle magnificient enough
to be supposed a royal residence,
rather than that of a subject.—
To the most delightful natural
situation was united all the em∣bellishments
of art. Its vicinity
to the great forest in <HI>Hampshire,</HI>
furnished this solitary retreat with
magnificent shades of elms and
oaks, venerable by their anti∣quity,
though within forty miles
of the capital, the interposition
of vast woods gave the appearance
of a much farther distance, nor
were the seats of the nobility,
which abounded in this county,
so near as to lessen the air of re∣tirement,
but dispersed in a man∣ner
that added new beauties to
the perspective of this charming
scene.</P>
<P>HERE it was the unhappy
<HI>Julia</HI> accompanied—<HI>not the hus∣band
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
of her choice!</HI> She petiti∣oned
the countess to favour her
with <HI>Lucilla's</HI> company; she rea∣dily
complied. Who would
have seen without compassion,
the deep melancholly that preyed
on her spirits? I had no con∣ception,
would she say to <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
that my misery could be greater,
—that it was possible for me
to suffer more than I had suffer∣ed.
—But alas! how am I mis∣taken!
Each day! each mo∣ment!
heaps woe on woe upon
my wretched head! The ter∣rible
constraint I am obliged to
support in the presence of a hus∣band
I can never love;—the se∣cret
reproaches;—the remorse,
their never failing consequence;
—the tender remembrance of a
lover too dear!—The desire of
performing the task of duty;—
of tearing from the heart an in∣clination
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
it is now a crime to in∣dulge.
—All these sensations
are so painful,—so exquisitely
alarming,—that I sometimes
dread the most horrid effects
from my despair! Accountable
only to myself, I at least avoid∣ed
the shame of blushing for the
sentiments of my heart! What
a wretched martyr to these sen∣timents!
Let it not my <HI>God,</HI>
be of long duration?</P>
<P>HERE, tears burst from her
eyes in torrents.—<HI>Lucilla</HI> sym∣phatized
with her, but great as
her inclination was to comfort
and support her, all endeavours
were ineffectual.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> notwith∣standing
the gratification of his
wishes, felt himself sensibly mor∣tified
in knowing he was not be∣loved.—
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
Love, with all its blindness, is
quick and penetrating;—dis∣tinguishes
with fatal precision
the effects of complaisance, from
those of preference. Love is
prone to flatter,—to impose on
itself.—But there is a source of
delicate delight which the heart
tastes freely of in the exchange
of mutual professions of affec∣tion;
when one alone is anima∣ted,
there are many wretched
moments that explain the mis∣fortune,
though the heart may
continue devoted to its object.
Such was the state of the earl of
<HI>Bedford;</HI> and in these moments
of disappointment, he was stu∣dious
to discover who could have
robbed him of the affection of
his wife.—His reflexions did
not even lead him to conjecture!
—So prudent in her behavi∣our;
—such professed in difference
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
for the world;—educated in re∣tirement;
—he was persuaded if
she did not love him, that at
least she had no prepossession in
favour of another! And though
the certainty of the former gave
him great concern, he felt as
great consolation in the belief of
the latter. I shall be completely
happy in time, said he to one of
his intimate friends. <HI>Julia</HI> is at
present insensible; but when her
heart is once susceptible of ten∣derness,
I doubt not her endear∣ments
will be the result of love,
as they now are of principle.</P>
<P>THREE months were already
elapsed since <HI>Lucilla</HI> or the earl
of Sussex had wrote a single line
to <HI>Hyppolitus;</HI> so much were
they enraged at the unpardon∣able
proofs they had received of
his inconstancy.—The earl,
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
though he boasted of never en∣tering
into a serious engagement
with any woman, was so per∣fectly
a man of honour, he had
no conception of the forfeiture
of a promise, without the for∣feiture
of honesty; a way of
thinking that irritated him to
the highest pitch, against the
conduct of his friend.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Douglas,</HI> having
nothing more to apprehend, had
thanked the ambassadors for their
punctuality in intercepting the
pacquets; and acquainted them
there was no further occasion to
give them that trouble. But
this alteration afforded no relief
to <HI>Hyppolitus;</HI> since those he
wished so ardently to hear from
were not in a disposition to re∣new
the correspondence. His
distress was inconceivable.—Se∣veral
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
times he was upon the
point of leaving <HI>Italy,</HI> and was as
often disswaded by the arguments
of <HI>Leander,</HI> who exerted all his
rhetoric to detain him. One
evening, when his impatience in∣duced
him to shun all conversa∣tion,
even that of his bosom
friend, he left the city, and fol∣lowing
for some time the course
of the river <HI>Arno,</HI> he turned into
a winding path, leading to a
grove of orange trees, myrtles,
and acacias, which afforded a
perpetual spring: he walked
slowly on for some time in a
broad walk, which he at length
quitted for a more sequestered
part of the wood, when finding
himself at liberty to breath his
complaints without interruption,
—he poured forth the most bit∣ter
sighs and cruel reflexions on
the silence of his mistress,—his
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
—sister,—his friend! and came
to a determined resolution to de∣part
immediately; when his gen∣tleman,
who knew how much
his master suffered at not hear∣ing
from <HI>England,</HI> having just re∣ceived
a pacquet, hastened to find
him; he was seen to enter the
wood, where diligent search at
length discovered him. <HI>Hyppo∣litus</HI>
was in rapture to see a letter
directed by the earl of <HI>Sussex.</HI>—
He opened it with precipitation,
and found these words:</P>
<P>“WHATEVER resolutions I
have taken to write to you no
more, I cannot help thinking
three months silence is a suf∣ficient
proof how much I was
affected with your infidelity
to the lovely <HI>Julia.</HI> And
though a marriage so advan∣tageous
as yours is represent∣ed,
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
must be interesting to all
your friends, and though I am
one of those most sensible to
what regards your happiness,
I confess myself unable to con∣gratulate
you on this occasion.
I wish you had never loved
<HI>Julia,</HI> or never ceased to love
her! Her heart was pene∣trated
with the most excruci∣ating
tortures.—The <HI>Flo∣rentine</HI>
ambassador delivered
your letters with his own hand;
she saw the portrait of your
new mistress;—and the con∣sequence
of the emotions she
felt, almost robbed her of life!
She has sacrificed herself to a
sentiment of disdain, that I
fear will be attended with re∣gret
and repentance.—Not∣withstanding
the moderation
and indifference with which
you apparently think of her
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
now, I believe you cannot hear
without indignation and con∣cern,
that she has consented
to be countess of <HI>Bedford.</HI>—
A title which cost her so many
tears, as to give her nuptials
more the appearance of a fu∣neral
than a wedding. She is
in <HI>Berkshire. Lucilla,</HI> is the
companion of her solitude,—
whilst you are surrounded with
pleasure and ease, the wretched
<HI>Julia</HI> is a prey to sorrow and
remorse. Acknowledge you
have no reason to complain of
my silence, or of the coldness
of my style.—My dear <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
it would not become
me to appologize for either.
The sentiments of friendship
ought to be free and uncon∣strained.”</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58"/>
HYPPOLITUS was in the ut∣most
astonishment at the begin∣ning
of this incomprehensible
letter.—His marriage,—his
inconstancy,—the reproaches it
was filled with! still encreased
his surprize.—But when he came
to that part which mentioned
<HI>Julia's</HI> marriage with the earl of
<HI>Bedford,</HI> he fell like one thun∣derstruck,
at the foot of a tree;
—till tempted by the storm of
passion, he repeatedly drew his
sword with an intention to finish
all his misfortunes at one blow;
but a feeble ray of hope still flat∣tered
him:—have I not all ima∣ginable
reason to believe they
will practise a thousand artifices to
deceive me? Perhaps <HI>Julia</HI> is
not altogether convinced of the
story they would impose upon
her, and writes in this manner
to al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm, and lead me back to
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
my former vows, had I been
capable of wandering from them!
These thoughts soon gave place
to others still more afflicting.</P>
<P>Is she then married, he ex∣claimed:
Good <HI>God!</HI> and can I
hear it without dying with des∣pair?
<HI>Julia,</HI> adorable <HI>Julia!</HI>
how have I deserved this? Why
did you suspect my heart could be
guilty of the blackest treason?
That heart engaged to be ever
yours by so many tender ties, was
it possible for it to be anothers?
Ah! you were inclined to be
faithless yourself, or you never
would have believed reports pro∣pagated
to undo me! He was
silent for awhile;—then repent∣ing
the severity of his accusati∣ons,
he entreated his <HI>Julia</HI> to
pardon him, as if she had been
present.—These pathetic en∣treaties
<PB REF="60"/>
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
treaties were accompanied with
floods of tears, and the most pas∣sionate
complaints.—He then
broke into dreadful imprecations,
against the ravisher of his bliss,
and all who had assisted in so vile
a deception.</P>
<P>NIGHT approached, unob∣served
by <HI>Hyppolitus;</HI> he had no
thoughts of leaving the wood,
but traversed it with hasty and
unequal steps.—Now resting
against a tree;—now throwing
himself on the earth;—no spot
afforded him a moment's relief;
—love,—fury, and despair,
tormented his soul by turns so
violently, that his situation bor∣dered
more upon death than
life.</P>
<P>LEANDER, with whom he had
engaged to spend the evening,
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
began to wonder he did not come,
and upon enquiry heard from his
gentleman, he had left him in
the wood; though the season
was fine enough to invite a lover
to pass the night in so agreeable
a retreat, <HI>Leander</HI> could not a∣void
feeling some anxiety as it
grew late, and went himself to
seek him; nor was it long before
the sound of distant groans and
complaints, alarmed him, and
dreading some accident, this
faithful friend advanced with pre∣cipitation
towards the place where
he heard his voice; and by the
light of the moon, saw him ex∣tended
on the ground, seemingly
without sense or motion.</P>
<P>AH! my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> cried
he, you are wounded; you have
been attacked by villains!—by
robbers! <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> looking on
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
him with a countenance where
despair was strongly painted,
how happy should I be, said he
with a deep sigh, to be wounded
even to death! My misfortunes
are terrible indeed! my dear <HI>Le∣ander,</HI>
I am arrived at the very
summit of misery! I have lost
all! Good <HI>God,</HI> she is irrecover∣ably
lost!</P>
<P>HE could say no more, and as
<HI>Leander</HI> saw an open letter by
him, and found him unwilling
to make any further discovery,
he immediately concluded there
must be some fatal contents in
it, that had thrown his friend
into this dreadful agony of dis∣tress.
He removed some paces
from the shade of the trees, in
order to read the characters; and
nothing could exceed the grief
he felt on seeing the causes of
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
his distress.—He returned to
the place where he left him—
but he was gone from thence
without even remembering to
have seen <HI>Leander,</HI> who pursued
him,—calling aloud several times
—At length, in the most un∣frequented
and distant part of the
wood, his groans and loud ex∣clamations,
again informed him
where he was:—grasping his
hand, and pressing him to his
bosom, with all the tenderness
of friendship, he said all that
reason, understanding and af∣fection
suggested in such a tryal.
He first sympathized in his just
affliction, which he knew it was
vain to oppose;—then essayed
to oppose it, in some degree, by
the flattery of hope;—and by
remonstrating that a mind ele∣vated
and noble like his friends,
should not suffer itself to be sub∣dued
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
by the arrows of calamity,
but strive to resist their force.—
he then conjured him by every
thing most dear, particularly by
her who was the only object of
his love and distress, to endea∣vour
to arm his soul with forti∣tude;
least the effects of the
most constant passion, and the
most justifiable subject of grief
that ever man experienced, should
be construed into cowardice and
pusilanimity. He knew the
heart of his friend was sensible
to glory, and could not bear the
slightest imputation that tarnished
it. He added that since <HI>Julia</HI>
expressed such extreme repug∣nance
to a marriage she was un∣happily
persuaded to contract, it
was an indisputable proof he still
reigned in her heart, and there∣fore
since he was still beloved,
his situation was not so desperate
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
as he painted it. Attentive to
these various reasons urged by
his friend, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> gained
fome relaxation from grief, and
tasted the consolation of the
wretched, in giving vent to his
sorrow in words.</P>
<P>DAY began to break, when
<HI>Leander</HI> with difficulty prevailed
with him to go home, for if he
had been suffered to indulge his
own inclination, he would have
remained in the wood like a man
deprived of his senses. <HI>Leander</HI>
would not abandon his friend at
a time when he thought his pre∣sence
of most use,—watching
by his bedside, whilst he started
from broken slumbers. It is easy
to conceive how much <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
was altered by the extreme per∣turbation
his mind endured.—
Those who saw him could hardly
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
be persuaded he was not a man
beginning to recover from some
dangerous distemper. But alas!
is not love the most dangerous of
all dist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpers? <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>! how se∣cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
—how <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensive is a
young heart, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> commence∣ment
of a tender passion;—every
thing engages,—every thing
pleases;—the delicious poi∣son
insinuates itself into our
veins—so much the more fatal
from our unsuspecting credulity.
—The senses are in conspiracy to
receive the artful traitor, and
are in reality the assassins who
administer the deadly draught!</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS remained seve∣ral
days undetermined how to
act, and incapable of pursuing
any fixed resolution.—After a
thousand fluctuating projects, he
at length rested on the thought
of returning to <HI>London.</HI> Nei∣ther
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
his father's wrath, nor the
promise to the countess of <HI>Bed∣ford,</HI>
he should be three years a∣broad,
were capable of shaking
his resolution, and indeed were so
far from alarming him, that he
regarded them as unworthy of
reflection! And when <HI>Leander</HI>
recalled them to his remem∣brance;
betrayers of my happi∣ness,
(said he) they banish me
for the more easy perpetration of
their cruel purpose!—What
have I to fear? Just <HI>Heaven!</HI>
is there a danger that can now
intimidate me?—Misery like
mine, cannot rise higher.—The
malice of fortune has exhausted
its quiver against me.—In the
deplorable state I am reduced to,
life is the only evil left to dread!
<HI>Leander</HI> finding him so ste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy,
determined to accompany him▪
and as he was too much absorbed
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
in grief to attend to the necessary
preparations for his departure, or
the regulation of his affairs, took
the management of every thing,
with the kindness and diligence
of a faithful friend. The pre∣tence
was an excursion to
<HI>Rome,</HI> with only one attendant
on whom they could depend.—
<HI>Leander</HI> requested his father's
permission, and obtained it with∣out
difficulty. They set out for
<HI>Boulogna,</HI> but stayed there only
to pay their compliments to Count
<HI>Bentivoglio,</HI> the friend of <HI>Alberti,</HI>
for whom they had letters.</P>
<P>THEY then crossed the <HI>Ap∣penines,</HI>
and returning secretly to
<HI>Florence▪</HI> kept along the moun∣tains
to <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghorn.</HI> Not finding
any vessel ready to sail for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
they hired one for <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣seilles.</HI>
Two days after their
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
landing they embarked for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
after <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> had met
with some consolation in a letter
from the earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> with
whom he always maintained a
constant correspondence; though
it could not be so frequent as they
wished. The earl, on his arrival
at <HI>Venice,</HI> with an intention to
renew his offers of service to the
republick, found every thing in
profound tranquillity, and learned
that this magnificent city was
contented with being spectatress
of the disturbances which then
interrupted the peace of Europe.
<HI>Cosmo de Medicis</HI> supported by
the emperor, had besieged and
taken the city of <HI>Sienna. Tus∣cany,
Piedmont,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> were
engaged in war, whilst the re∣publick
of <HI>Venice</HI> enjoyed the
triumph of revenge for the in∣sults
received from <HI>Mustapha Bi∣fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
that corsair had entered the
<HI>Adriatic</HI> with several barks, and
already pillaged and ravaged the
coast of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> when Admi∣ral
<HI>Canelli</HI> bore down upon him
with <HI>Venetian</HI> squadron,—run
his vessels a ground, seized him,
and cutting off his head, fixed it
on a spear at the prow of his gal∣ley.
After this successful expe∣dition▪
the <HI>Venetians</HI> thought only
of preserving the amity of the
neighbouring potentates; and
the earl of <HI>Warwick▪</HI> seeing no
opportunity of signalizing his
courage, heard with joy of the
preparations making at <HI>Malta</HI> to
oppose <HI>Dragut Rais,</HI> who by or∣der
of <HI>Solyman</HI> had put to sea at
the head of twenty galleys.</P>
<P>THE knights, alarmed at this
formidable fleet, were indefati∣gable
in putting themselves in a
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
state of defence, and did not even
despair of being strong enough
to attack the enemy. The earl
of <HI>Warwick,</HI> whose breast still
glowed with resentment for the
cruel indignities of his captivity,
was ravished with so glorious an
opportunity of fighting for his
religion, distinguishing his valor,
and punishing a barbarian like
<HI>Dragut-Rais.</HI> With these sen∣timents
he applied to <HI>Aloesio Mon∣cenigo,</HI>
doge of <HI>Venice,</HI> to grant
him a recommendation to the
grand master of <HI>Malta.</HI> The doge
answered his most sanguine ex∣pectations,
and did every thing
to demonstrate his own gratitude
and that of the republic, for ser∣vices
conferred. He sailed for
<HI>Malta,</HI> where he was received
with the highest respect, and
embarked with the Admiral <HI>de la
Vallette.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73"/>
THEY did all that could be
expected from the united valour
and prudence of two such great
soldiers. The <HI>Maltese</HI> vessels
had regained their port; and the
earl had informed <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> of
his return to <HI>Venice;</HI> who, on
his side, had enlarged on the ter∣rible
situation of his mind on the
marriage of <HI>Julia.</HI> The earl,
penetrated with grief, answered
he would give immediate orders
for the dispatch of some affairs of
particular consequence that de∣tained
him at <HI>Venice,</HI> and would
then hasten to <HI>London</HI> to snatch
his daughter from the arms of
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> that the va∣lidity
of the marriage contracted
without his consent, was con∣testible,
and he might depend
upon the performance of the pro∣mise
given, that <HI>Julia</HI> should be
only his.—This hope so agree∣able
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
flattered the enamoured
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> that the violence of
his affliction seemed suspended;
—and <HI>Leander</HI> did not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail to
strengthen its weight, by remind∣ing
him that the daughter of a
man of the earl of <HI>Warwick's</HI>
rank and character, must be re∣stored
to the authority of an in∣jured
father.</P>
<P>THE weather was favourable
to these illustrious travellers,
they arrived at <HI>London</HI> incognito,
and <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> detested his fa∣ther's
house so much, that he e∣ven
avoided the street where it
stood. He flew to the earl of
<HI>Sussex,</HI> who received him with a
coldness that chilled his very
soul. <HI>Leander,</HI> on observing the
sudden effect it had upon his
friend, who sinking under the re∣flexions
that rushed into his mind,
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
could not speak, and was in an
agony of grief, broke silence,
and though a stranger to the earl
of <HI>Sussex,</HI> acquainted him in few
words with the treachery that
had been practised, the fortunate
meeting with the earl of <HI>War∣wick,</HI>
and other material particu∣lars.
—The earl, shocked at the
recital, threw his arms round the
neck of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and pressing
him to his bosom, my dearest
and truest friend! what is this I
hear! and what redress can be
found for injuries like yours.—
You are not married in <HI>Italy!</HI>
and yet this report, false as I am
now convinced it is, has depri∣ved
you of your <HI>Julia!</HI> At that
name, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> returning from
death to life, drawing a heart∣felt
sigh, Ah! where is she, my
friend? Where is that adorable
<HI>Julia?</HI> dear as her vital blood,
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
notwithstanding all the misfor∣tunes
her too precipitate resent∣ment
has overwhelmed me with!
She is still in <HI>Berkshire,</HI> said the
earl, the generous—spirited <HI>Lucilla</HI>
still comforts and shares her sor∣rows.
—I have been informed
she has been dangerously ill, and
that her husband's jealousy is in∣tolerable;
—which I can easily
credit, for I was lately in a great
hunting party at Lord <HI>Nevil's,</HI>
who you know has a fine seat
upon the sorest; his lordship in∣vited
me with several of his
friends, to spend some days
with him, and I was particularly
pleased, as thinking it would af∣ford
me a favourable opportunity
to visit <HI>Julia</HI> without the appear∣ance
of premeditation. The earl
of <HI>Bedford</HI> joined us in the field,
and I hinted my intention of
waiting on him;—he returned a
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
civil but reserved answer, that it
would be doing him great honor,
but he was very seldom at home.
—You have a lady, sir, who
I am very sure is never deficient
in politeness to your friends in
your absence;—he reddened,
and seemed disconcerted; but re∣covering
himself as well as he
could,—That lady, sir, is fond
of retirement, and very often in∣disposed!
This behaviour, ex∣pressive
enough of his meaning,
did not answer the purpose.—
I resolved to venture to knock at
his door; but his orders were so
punctually observed, that the
porter always told me his lady
was asleep, or not well; so found
it impracticable to get a sight of
either her or <HI>Lucilla.</HI> Ah! how
am I to gain admission? The
man that wounded her husband,
and whom he undoubtedly hates
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
more than all the world! Un∣less
you are in some very close
disguise, I have no idea it is pos∣sible,
said <HI>Leander.</HI> They con∣sulted
about it some time, but
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was in too great em∣barassment
to range his thoughts
regularly; <HI>Leander,</HI> too little ac∣quainted
with the customs of a
country, in which he was but
just landed! so that without the
earl of <HI>Sussex's</HI> assistance, they
had never found an expedient.</P>
<P>I HAVE a thought, said he,
which perhaps you will make
something of:—suppose we
buy some toys, such as fans, gloves,
and ribbands, with other articles
the pedlars deal in, who travel
about the country? and fill a
pack, such as they usually carry;
<HI>Leander</HI> and you may put on their
dress, and go to the earl's house,
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
free from suspicion. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
and <HI>Leander</HI> thought the scheme
admirable, and the former en∣treated
his friend to send imme∣diately
to a haberdasher, to fur∣nish
him with an assortment of
millinary trumpery.</P>
<P>ALL things being ready,—
their boxes filled, and their au∣burn
hair concealed under sun∣burnt
wigs.—The great difficulty
to both was to divest themselves
of that noble air which so un∣happily
distinguished the man of
fashion;—in other respects they
were sure of passing undisco∣vered.</P>
<P>IN regard to <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> he
was not only to assume an un∣natural
aukwardness of person,
but was obliged to add a large
black plaister over one eye to▪
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
shade the side of his face; and
give a different appearance to his
features. They <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et out that very
evening on horseback, with
two trusty attendants, who car∣ried
their disguises.—What a
succession of joy, hope, and des∣pair,
passed through the heart of
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> during the journey
—In what disposition am I
likely to find my <HI>Julia?</HI> Will
she pity me? my dear <HI>Leander,</HI>
will she listen to my vows? How
violent are the emotions I feel!
how exquisite! How shall I
restrain my transport, when I
behold her. Should her husband
be present shall I not be irresist∣ably
impelled to punish instantly
the infinite wrongs he has done
me?</P>
<P>THE conversation lasted till
they arrived at the spot where it
<PB N="78" REF="81"/>
was necessary to alight, and
change their habits. They
were guarded against any unex∣pected
events with a pair of pock∣et
pistols, which they charged
and then left their servants and
horses in the forest.</P>
<P>THE morning was advanced,
when they drew near the earl of
<HI>Bedford's</HI> seat, which <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
easily found the approach to, as he
had formerly been there; <HI>Leander</HI>
as principal, was to ask and
answer all questions.—The first
person they met was the earl
walking in the lawn before the
house. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> shuddered at
the sight, and could hardly con∣tain
his rising indignation within
the bounds prescribed. <HI>Leander</HI>
accosted him in <HI>Italian,</HI> which
the earl understood perfectly, and
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
indeed it is a language the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
are fond of, telling him he
had a great many pretty toys,
and hoped he would be a pur∣chaser.
The earl ordered them
into the hall, and after he had
examined their merchandize,
found it so much to his taste,
that he sent to desire the coun∣tess
and <HI>Lucilla</HI> to come down.
The ladies presently appeared;
<HI>Julia</HI> leaned upon a cane with
one hand, and rested on <HI>Lucilla's</HI>
arm as a sick person; pale,—
emaciated,—with an air of set∣tled
melancholy!—But, Good
<HI>God!</HI> how beautiful did she ap∣pear,
thus dejected, in the eyes
of <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> He was obliged
to rest against the wall to sup∣port
his trembling limbs.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Julia</HI> was seated, she
received with habitual complai∣sance
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
but with the utmost inat∣tention
the curiosities <HI>Leander</HI>
presented her! she expressed no
inclination for any of them, till
she was struck with an enameled
representation of a sick <HI>Cupid,</HI>
repulsing the hand that offered
him a cordial, with this motto,
—“I am past the power of me∣dicine.”</P>
<P>SHE could not forbear shew∣ing
it to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> with a look so
expressive! that <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who
watched every turn of her coun∣tenance,
was penetrated to the
soul. Observing the earl of
<HI>Bedford</HI> amused in examining the
collection, and fearing <HI>Julia</HI>
should retire, he ventured to ad∣vance,
after searching his box
for some new toys, he carried
her several, and amongst them
the locket she had given him
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
when he left <HI>England,</HI> without
disguising his voice, which the
emotions of his soul had suffici∣ently
altered: “Buy this bracelet,
madam, said he, you, perhaps,
never saw any of the kind equal
in beauty.” She took it up
carelesly, but the moment it met
her eye, was so struck, that if
the earl had observed her at that
instant, he must have suspected
some mystery. After eagerly ex∣amining
the colour of the hair,
—the hearts,—the device,—
where did you buy these jewels?
said she in a low voice. <HI>Leander,</HI>
perceiving his friend had en∣gaged
her attention, was very
fluent in conversation with the
earl;—so that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> had li∣berty
to reply,—Where did I
buy them madam? Alas! these
are jewels never to be bought!
In that part of my life, which
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
constituted my felicity, I adored
the most charming of her sex,
and she suffered my adoration
without displeasure.—Those
moments past, divine <HI>Julia,</HI> ap∣proaching,
as if to poiut out the
elegance of the workmanship;
those delightful moments are
now no more! she suspected me!
—she believed me faithless,—and
I come to avow my innocence at
her feet.</P>
<P>AT these tender and affecting
words, <HI>Julia</HI> could no longer
doubt it was her dear <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>
She sighed deeply, and support∣ing
her head upon her hand, in∣voluntary
tears trickled down
her cheeks The misfortunes of
that lady would indeed be con∣siderably
augmented were it true
that you are not criminal!—
Whilst they were in this situa∣tion,
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
<HI>Leander</HI> had shewn the
earl a very fine dial, and in order
to judge of its excellence, had
persuaded him to walk upon the
terrace.—<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> having
no other witnesses than his sister,
could no longer forbear throw∣ing
himself at <HI>Julia's</HI> feet, kissing
her fair hand in an extacy where
grief and joy were so strongly
blended, as almost to deprive
him of life. <HI>Lucilla</HI> was tran∣sported
at her brother's return,
and <HI>Julia</HI> was unable to speak,
so much was her soul divided be∣twixt
joy, fear, and grief.—She
even dreaded to be convinced
of his falshood, whatever incli∣nation
she had to reproach him;
but he prevented the latter;—
No, my amiable <HI>Julia,</HI> said he,
with the most passionate emotion,
no, I am not guilty! The trea∣chery
employed to impose up∣on
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
you, on the report of an ideal
marriage which never entered my
thoughts, has poisoned the re∣mainder
of my wretched days.—
I am faithful to my vows;—
<HI>Julia</HI> alas! is not so to her's!
Add not to my self-reproach,
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> said she in a voice
stifled with sighs, what I now
hear, revenges you, by inflicting
the severest punishment on my
unfortunate credulity plunged
into a snare too artfully spread!
—Though my respect and love
will not allow me to reproach
you, yet surely my dearest <HI>Julia</HI>
was too precipitate in giving her∣self
to another. It appears she
must have acted from other mo∣tives
than those of anger and
resentment. Why did she not at
least consult her father, and wait
his approbation?—Whilst he
was speaking, <HI>Julia</HI> regarded him
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
with looks of commiseration,
concluding that disappointment
had impaired his reason. “Con∣sult
my father!” Alas! said
she, I do not even remember to
have had one! Were he alive,
I should not now be the wretch
I am! <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> perceiving by
these words that Lord <HI>Douglas</HI>
had suppressed the earl of <HI>War∣wick's</HI>
letters, as well as his
own, was still more enraged at
this complicated perfidy. It is
time you should be informed of
a circumstance, said he, rising
for fear of being surprized, which
you are particularly interested to
know:—Fortune, my inve∣terate
enemy in all things else,
has however favoured me in the
inestimable blessing of your fa∣ther's
life:—he lives, my <HI>Julia,</HI>
I met with him at sea,—the
slave of <HI>Dragut-Rais,</HI>—who was
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
reported to have killed him.—I
delivered him out of his hands.
—He wrote you the particulars.
—Here <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was inter∣rupted
by the entrance of the
earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> disputing with
<HI>Leander</HI> on the price of the dial.
—He who studied only to de∣tain
the earl, had been bartering
about it for a quarter of an hour;
he asked an extravagant price,
and abated after an obstinate per∣sistance.
on finding the earl be∣gan
to be displeased. The bar∣gain
was interrupted by a visit
from Lady <HI>Nevil,</HI> sister to the
earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and aunt to
<HI>Julia,</HI> though ignorant of their
consanguinity; she felt as strong
a degree of tenderness as if she
had known it.—They were
neighbours, and she came to in∣vite
<HI>Julia</HI> to her daughter's wed∣ding,
with the first family in
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
<HI>England;</HI> though our party will
be but small▪ said Lady <HI>Nevil,</HI> I
don't doubt its being a very chear∣ful
one.—I confess, madam, re∣plied
<HI>Julia,</HI> in the most obliging
manner, that except the plea∣sure
I always have of seeing you
and your family, I am incapa∣ble
of tasting any satisfaction in
company.—I need not tell you I
am but just recovering from a
long illness, and am yet so much
of an invalid, I am fearful of
being an improper guest at a
wedding.—You may alledge
what reasons you please, said
Lady <HI>Nevil,</HI> smiling, but I pro∣test
there can be no wedding
without you!—Every lady would
be out of spirits.—I am resolved
you shall go home with me, this
very day! As Lord <HI>Howard</HI>
was nearly related to the earl of
<HI>Bedford,</HI> he joined his entreaties
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
so earnestly to those of Lady <HI>Ne∣vil,</HI>
that <HI>Julia</HI> was obliged to
acquiesce. There was no possi∣bility
of speaking another word
to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> or of hearing where
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> resided.—
<HI>Lucilla</HI> and she followed Lady
<HI>Nevil</HI> out of the room, and could
only desire the pedlars not to
fail calling when they were more
at leisure, as they wanted seve∣ral
things.—Their eyes mu∣tually
exchanged a tender adieu!
and <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and <HI>Leander</HI> de∣parted
as soon as they saw the
ladies in the coach.</P>
<P>THEY walked on some time
in silence, each absorbed in his
own contemplations.—At length
<HI>Leander</HI> addressed his friend:—
You have introduced me to the
sight of two of the most beauti∣ful
women in the world; and
continued he, I believe it im∣possible
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
to behold them without
admiration! I have regarded
<HI>Julia</HI> as the object of your love,
but <HI>Lucilla,</HI> the charming <HI>Lu∣cilla!</HI>
is that of mine! Were
you not her brother, I should
dread you as a rival! I am en∣chanted
with the engaging free∣dom
of her behaviour;—the
sprightliness of her air;—the
regular beauty of her features;
—the delicacy of her shape;
—all these advantages so far
transcending what I ever met
with, have thrown me into such
astonishment, that I cannot for∣bear
confessing I never felt a real
passion for any woman till this
moment. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was so de∣lighted
to hear the impression
his sister had made, that he sud∣denly
interrupted his friend's
rhapsody, by throwing his arms
about his neck,—I never
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
could find but one fault in you,
my dear <HI>Leander,</HI> and that was
not being in love! I sometimes
lamented our dissimilarity in that
particular; I thought it impossi∣ble
you should listen to me with
that attention I requested;—or
that my misfortunes could excite
your compassion, when your
heart had never experienced
symphathetic feelings. In short,
I am rejoiced you have found a
woman you think worthy of a
serious attachment; and, I think,
it will be my fault if my sister
does not inspire you with a most
ungovernable passion! But you
have not told me what is your
opinion of the divine <HI>Julia.</HI> Is
it not with reason I die for her?
Have you ever seen any thing so
near perfection? For my part,
I am dazzled with her beauty!
That langour! that apparent sad∣ness!
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>
added to her charms and
my affliction.—Alas! all these
circumstances combined, only
encrease the sense I before had of
the excess of my loss.</P>
<P>CONTINUING their discourse
they arrived at the spot where
their attendants waited; they
had scarcely thrown off their dis∣guise,
when they heard the sound
of horses, and found themselves
invested by a number of arm∣ed
men—Their surprize
was great on being summon∣ed
to surrender.—Notwith∣standing
the inequality of the
party, and the temerity of stand∣ing
on the defensive, they drew
their pistols, and put four of their
enemies to flight: availing them∣selves
of the trunks of some large
trees, they avoided being sur∣rounded,
and defended their
lives to the last splinter of their
<PB N="92" REF="95"/>
swords, against their dishonou∣rable
attacks. Their attendants
supported them as far as they
were able, but fresh recruits
poured in on the enemies side,
whilst the strength of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
and <HI>Leander</HI> gradually diminish∣ed;
perceiving they avoided kil∣ling,
and not knowing the cause
of their repeated cries to sur∣render,
the two friends were at
length constrained to submit.—
But no sooner were these wretches
in possession of their persons,
than they treated them with great
inhumanity.—Resentment for
the death of some of their com∣rades,
and for the wounds of
others, had sharpened their ani∣mosity
so much, that they tied
their prisoners together in the
roughest manner, to prevent their
escape, or farther resistance.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="96"/>
THEY then dragged them a∣long
to they house of a neigh∣bouring
justice of peace, from
whom they had received a war∣rant
for apprehending them.—
Some wood-cutters at work in
the forest, when <HI>Leander</HI> and
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> stripped to change
their dresses, observing them lay
aside their embroidered cloaths,
to put on the habits of pedlars,
and one of them covered his eye
with a plaister, concluded them
to be certain highwaymen, who
had lately committed several
robberies in the forest. The
constables, with some companies
of archers, were assembled at the
justices, when the woodmen
went to lodge an information of
what they had seen: circum∣stances
were so suspicious, that
without much pains it was readily
believed these were the very
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
rogues; planting archers in si∣lence
near the avenues of the fo∣rest,
they saw the two friends
return and put on their proper
dresses. The constables wanted
no farther conviction, which
made them persist in endeavour∣ing
to take them alive, and as
night was coming on, they
thought it best to carry them be∣fore
the justice with all speed.</P>
<P>UPON the road, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
made many melancholy reflex∣ions
on the oddity of this adven∣ture.
—He could not conceive
what should occasion it, and was
at a loss where to fix his conjec∣tures.
Can it be the conse∣quence
of my fathers anger?—
Am I betrayed? and has he in∣formation
of my being in <HI>Eng∣land?</HI>
Or can the earl of <HI>Bed∣ford</HI>
and his mother, be autho∣rized
<PB N="95" REF="98"/>
to prosecute me for break∣ing
the conditions of my banish∣ment?
He could recollect no
other enemies, and was amazed
what should induce them to seize
<HI>Leander;</HI> he then loaded him∣self
with reproaches, for the in∣sults
offered to his faithful friend;
much as he wanted to confer
with him on these articles, their
leaders took care to prevent it,
by keeping them in a line one
before the other.—They no
sooner arrived at the justices,
than he examined them separate∣ly;
nor did their astonishment
abate when he interrogated them
on murders and robberies they
had never heard of.</P>
<P>UPON their denial of the facts,
it is easy to believe the rigor of
their discipline was not relaxed;
they were put into a deep dun∣geon,
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
loaded with irons, and a
guard of archers placed before
the entrance. When they had
recovered liberty of speech, they
said all that friendship could in∣spire
on such an occasion.—Do
not be uneasy, my dear friend,
said <HI>Leander,</HI> you see all turns
upon a mistake, and the moment
you discover yourself, these peo∣ple
will be eager to set you free.
Have I not the greatest cause to
be dissatisfied? Ah! <HI>Leander,</HI>
do you so little comprehend the
sentiments I have for you? And
what have I not to fear from the
consequences of this fatal error?
I see you fettered like a ruffian in
a gloomy dungeon! constrained
to lodge upon the damp earth!
You, who generously accompa∣nied
me into my country, after
passing innumerable obligations
upon me in your's! and the first
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
place I lead you into is a prison!
This is my manner of perform∣ing
the duties of hospitality!—
and you would have me insensi∣ble
to the mortification? In∣deed
I would▪ interrupted <HI>Lean∣der,</HI>
for I find very little regard
for me in this way of thinking.
From the moment I became the
voluntary partner of your afflic∣tions,
my friend, all selfish con∣siderations
were annihilated! I
should blush if I was not able to
assure you my mind is superior
to accidents like this! A pri∣son,
—chains,—and a little abu∣sive
language,—are trifles, not
worth ones attention. If you
knew my heart, you would be
perfectly convinced. I should
be very undeserving of these
proofs of your friendly regard,
if I could be unmoved at such
amazing generosity; but to make
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
you sensible of the perplexity of
my situation, reflect, I intreat
you, on the consequence of de∣claring
my rank? When the
earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> shall be informed
of the circumstance of our dis∣guise,
what will he not have rea∣son
to conjecture? He will
accuse <HI>Julia!</HI> In the fury of his
rage, her virtue and innocence
will not guard her from suspi∣cion!
How deplorable may be
the result! Alas! I may be the
fatal cause of the misery of her
I love! Can there be a more
distracting terror? My father
too,—there are are no extre∣mities
of wrath he is not capa∣ble
of! If he releases me from
my present confinement it will
be only to throw me into ano∣ther,
as he has so often threaten∣ed!
Thus I shall deprive <HI>Julia</HI>
of her husband's confidence, and
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
ruin my hopes in her's.—These
are cruel effects, said <HI>Leander,</HI>
disconsolately; and I see little
appearance how they can be a∣voided.
I have thought of a
method, said <HI>Hyppolitus:</HI>—
sometimes a justice of peace may
be an interested man! I will try,
—perhaps we may succeed.—
<HI>Leander</HI> approved his friends de∣sign,
and they slept as well as
they were able.</P>
<P>IT was already noon when the
constables came to carry them a
second time before the justice.—
Instead of farther interrogations
as they expected, he only asked
if they had courage enough to
fight? Not able to comprehend
the meaning of the question,—
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> replied, you may be
best informed of that from the
men who were sent to attack us.
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
But, continued he, advancing
nearer, and lowering his voice,
if you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will restore our liberty,
sir, you have only to prescribe
the terms:—we are ready to
agree to any sum you propose.—
I am not to be bribed, young
man, said the justice, I execute
my office with integrity, and as
so many persons are sufferers by
your depredations, I think it ab∣solutely
necessary you should suf∣fer
as an example. <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
in despair at this ill success of
his project, after reiterated soli∣citations,
resolved to declare who
he was. Your compliance with
our earnest entreaties to release
us, said he, could not be attend∣ed
with the least injury to your
character; I will trust you with
my name, and repeat my former
offer, if you will keep it secret,
as I have very important reasons
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>
for desiring to be concealed.—
You see before you, <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
son of the earl of <HI>Douglas.</HI>—
I would not have you release
me, till I pay the consideration I
have promised.—You are a
very impudent fellow, interrupt∣ed
the justice, in an angry tone,
to dare to assume that name in
my presence! when I am certain
that nobleman is now in <HI>Italy!</HI>
Saying this, he left them, and
gave orders to the constables to
be ready to march. He placed
himself at their head, and the
prisoners in the midst of the
troop. When they arrived at
the brow of a hill, they saw a
magnificent house, upon the plain,
with grand avenues of forest
trees, opening on every side;—
on a terias in front, they could
discern several well dressed per∣sons,
and were surprized with
<PB N="102" REF="105"/>
the harmony of musical instru∣ments.</P>
<P>WHAT does all this portend?
my dear <HI>Hppolitus,</HI> said <HI>Leander,</HI>
are we going to this fine place,
where pleasures of every species
seem collected? What part are
we to act in such an assembly I
wonder?</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS replied with a
sorrowful aspect, we are not
likely to be entertained as guests
in the assembly before us; I
conclude we are to exhibit in
in some neighbouring town, or
perhaps shall not stop till we get
to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>As they spoke, they observed
a gentleman advancing towards
them, who by his air and atten∣tants,
appeared a person of rank.
<PB N="103" REF="106"/>
<HI>Leander</HI> asked his friend if he
knew him? No, said he, but I
take him to be some nobleman
who lives hereabouts.—They
were already so near, that the jus∣tice
alighted, and saluted him with
great ceremony: My lord, said
he, I was coming to wait on your
lordship, to express my concern
at being disappointed of the
wrestlers, who engaged to be
with me yesterday.—I expected
them not till noon, but now I
entirely despair of seeing them.
His lordship shewed great marks
of displeasure in his countenance,
and answered angerly, if I had
not depended on your promise, I
should have taken care to provide
others.—I invited a great deal
of company, mèrely with a view
of entertaining them with these
prizefighters. What would you
have me do, my lord? resumed
<PB N="104" REF="107"/>
the justice, I can offer you four
highwaymen that were taken
lastnight in the forest, I assure
your lordship they made but too
gallant a defence, and I really
believe will afford your lordship
excellent sport. My lord looked
at them, and expressed his parti∣cular
admiration of the fine form
of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and <HI>Leander.</HI> I
thank you, sir, said he, in a more
polite accent: these two young
men are as well made as can be
wished.—They will do.—
Make what haste you can to the
house.—I will go before and
give orders for your reception.—
He immediately dispatched some
of his servants with directions,
leaving the justice to proceed on
his march.</P>
<P>LEANDER did not understand
<HI>English</HI> sufficiently to comprehend
<PB N="105" REF="108"/>
all that was said, till <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
fetching a deep sigh, O, my dear
<HI>Leander,</HI> what a strange misfor∣tune
have we now to encounter.
Good <HI>God!</HI> to what are we re∣served?
To be each others mur∣therer.
Explain the meaning of
these exclamations? said <HI>Leander,</HI>
I cannot conceive.—You know,
interrupted <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
entertained the people with
combats of gladiators, who were
often selected from amongst the
criminals intended for execution.
They introduced this custom into
<HI>England</HI> when they were masters
of it, which still exists: with
this difference, that the modern
gladiators are not compelled, but
voluntarily devote themselves to
this occupation, I say <HI>devote,</HI> be∣cause
they often die of the blows
they receive, and I call it an
occupation, because they live by
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
the money they earn in it. A
linnen shirt and drawers, pumps,
and a nightcap, is all their dress.
The stage is sanded for their ap∣pearance,
and they fight with
broad swords, whose points are
guarded.—With these they back
each other, engage not to quit
the field till they are wounded
twice or thrice. The wounds
they give are horrid, and they
fight with the utmost inveteracy,
like desperate enemies, though
they afterwards divide the money
like loving friends.—It is upon
the whole, a most bloody spec∣tacle,
and the spectators are not
less barbarous, nor less to be
condemned than the combatants.
This is the tragedy they intend
we should act.—I to engage
with you, my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> I
to wound my friend,—cried
<HI>Leander,</HI> in agony. I will die
<PB N="107" REF="110"/>
first! They were now arrived
at the house, and chained as they
were, conducted into a large
hall, where a table was spread
before them, but they obstinately
refused to eat. Here the justice
came to acquaint them in the
severest terms, they must pre∣pair
with a good grace;—that
their life and death were in his
hands, and if they shewed the
least resistance, he swore by all
that was sacred to hang them
upon the first tree;—that he was
master of their fate, and he ad∣vised
them for the last time, not
to provoke him. They strenu∣ously
requested to speak with the
master of the house, but the jus∣tice,
who had observed the strict
union between the two friends,
apprehended they would try to
get excused from engaging each
other, would not suffer the mes∣sage
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
to be delivered.—Their
despair was beyond expression;
the time was already elapsed, and
the more they persevered in re∣fusing
the combat, the more
they were menaced with a shame∣ful
and a speedy death. This
obliged them to an immediate
resolution that as soon as they
received their swords, they would
employ them in selling their
lives at the dearest rate. Furi∣ous
with wrath and indignation,
they threw off their coats, seized
their swords, and rushed into the
place appointed for the combat.</P>
<P>THE company had been told
two highwaymen taken in the
forest, were to entertain them
with an engagement, and the
ground they were to fight upon,
had been railed in for the pur∣pose.
A confused murmur arose
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
at their entrance every one re∣garded
them with wonder; their
youth, beauty, and graceful mein
interested all hearts in their fa∣vour.
<HI>Leander's</HI> features were
unknown, but several could not
avoid taking notice of the strik∣ing
resemblance between the o∣ther
robber, as they believed
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and the earl of <HI>Doug∣las's</HI>
son! If one was not sure of
his being in <HI>Italy,</HI> whispered
they, one could have no doubt
about it! The two faithful
friends, after viewing the audi∣ence
with a noble intrepidity,
cast their eyes upon the wretches
they had to contend with: there
were thirty constables, whom
the justice had placed round the
rail, under his own observation,
not supposing any danger near.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="113"/>
HYPPOLITUS and <HI>Leander</HI>
embraced each other with the
strongest marks of affection, per∣suaded,
that in all human pro∣bability,
death was inevitably
their lot, but they had too much
fortitude to be intimidated with
its approach. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> drew a
degree of consolation, from re∣flecting
he should die unknown,
and that the secret of his visit∣ing
<HI>Julia</HI> would probably be bu∣ried
with him. According to
the plan they had formed, the
two friends threw themselves
with precipitation over the bar∣rier,
and running furiously to∣wards
the justice and his consta∣bles,
snatched a couple of swords,
capable of doing more execution
than those they had bestowed,
and in a few moments they were
covered with blood, and wounded
in several places. Things were in
<PB N="111" REF="114"/>
this state when <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
whose natural humanity induced
them to avoid so cruel a diver∣sion,
hearing an uncommon noise,
intermingled with the shrieks of
several ladies whose pity and terror
was awakened, went to the en∣trance
of the amphitheatre, where
the spectators were assembled,
and looking round for the gladi∣ators,
who were scarcely to be
distinguished in the general con∣fusion.
Alas! what was their
distraction when they beheld
their dear <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and his ge∣nerous
friend! Are there words
to express their astonishment.—
Their affliction,—their horror—
at this deplorable, this unex∣pected
discovery?—Merciful
<HI>Heaven!</HI> it is <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI>—it
is my brother! exclaimed they
with one voice, flying with ra∣pidity
towards them, like persons
<PB N="112" REF="115"/>
who thought no calamity com∣parable
to the death of those
they loved! The company a∣larmed
and interested by this
extraordinary appearance, drew
their swords to assist them;—
breathless and pale, <HI>Lucilla</HI> and
<HI>Julia</HI> approached their lovers;
—their appearance reanimated
their spirits and courage. The
constables seeing so many swords
drawn against them, thought
only of making a retreat, leaving
the two heroes masters of the
field of battle.</P>
<P>BUT the moment their rage
subsided, their strength failed:
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> fell bathed in blood at
the feet of <HI>Julia:</HI>—<HI>Leander,</HI>
striving to assist his friend, sunk
down by him, overcome with
faintness and fatigue. At this
melancholy sight, <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Lu∣cilla
<PB N="113" REF="116"/>
Lucilla</HI> could no longer contain
the extravagance of their grief.
<HI>Julia,</HI> all-occupied with assisting
her dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> supported
his head upon her lap, her arm
round his neck, whilst his cheek
was moistened with her tears.—
She poured forth the most lamen∣table
complaints, and endea∣voured
to stop the blood, which
flowed fast from one of his
wounds; leaving <HI>Lucilla</HI> at li∣berty
to devote her cares to <HI>Le∣ander,</HI>
who felt her compassion
already interested in the preser∣vation
of the illustrious stranger,
from a yet stronger motive than
generosity. The persons round
him would have removed <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
to have his wounds ex∣amined;
but careless before
whom he spoke, he cast a lan∣guishing
look on <HI>Julia,</HI> and said
with great emotion, suffer me,
<PB N="114" REF="117"/>
adorable woman! to expire in
your arms, that my death may
be more tranquil, and more hap∣py
than my life? These words
reached the ears of very few,
and those who heard them con∣cluded
they proceeded from that
delirium which is an indication
of approaching death: but the
earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> who was present,
was struck as with a flash of light∣ning.
He knew <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was
not the brother of <HI>Julia;</HI>—that
they had been educated together;
—that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> wounded him
in the garden at <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
when he was carrying her away.
—He saw in an instant all he
had to fear! and his mind soon
confirmed these suspicions into
intolerable truths. But when
he learned from the justice that
the two gentlemen had appeared
in the disguise of pedlars, there
<PB N="115" REF="118"/>
wanted nothing more, nay, much
less had been sufficient to convince
him there must have been a long
and reciprocal passion between
his wife and <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>—Yet
he had dissimulation enough to
conceal the arrow which rankled
in his breast.</P>
<P>THE two friends were carried
into the same bedchamber, and
a speedy dressing applied to their
wounds, which were more large
than dangerous. <HI>Julia</HI> too late
reflected that the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI>
must have seen with resentment
and indignation the excessive
grief she had expressed on that
occasion, and as some reparation
for this offence, she entreated
<HI>Lucilla</HI> to acquaint her brother
she was obliged to pay some re∣gard
to forms, and therefore could
only visit him in company with
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
her husband; he might judge
of the violence she offered to her
inclination, since she acknow∣ledged
herself so unfortunate as
not to have been able to efface
from her remembrance, or erase
from her heart the sentiments he
had inspired. She conjured him
to inform her where he left her
father.</P>
<P>LORD NEVIL was inconsole∣able
at the adventure which had
happened in his house; he had
the highest esteem for the earl
of <HI>Douglas,</HI> and therefore could
not be uncoucerned at the situa∣tion
of his son: he had been
made acquainted with <HI>Leander's</HI>
rank, and was eager to express
every thing demonstrative of his
regard and affection—<HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
addressed him in the most urgent
terms, and begged him not to
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>
write to his father an account of
what had happened. He frankly
confessed that love was the cause
of his return to <HI>England,</HI> and of
the metamorphosis which ensued.
He made him sensible it would
hazard embroiling him with his
own family, till he had time to
soothe them into forgiveness if
Lord <HI>Nevil</HI> should give the first
intelligence of his arrival.</P>
<P>MANY people were desirous
to penetrate the mystery that in∣duced
these two friends to travel
in disguise, not doubting it the
effects of some attachment,
though they could find no clue
to guide them to a discovery;
and as the world was unacquaint∣ed
that <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
were not brother and sister, their
conjectures were vague and un∣certain.
The justice was alarmed
<PB N="118" REF="121"/>
with the consequences he ap∣prehended
from this affair; that
he was the very picture of ter∣ror.
He supplicated the ladies to
pardon his temerity, and exert
their generosity in his behalf
with <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and <HI>Leander;</HI>
their goodnature was prevailed
upon, and they requested their
lovers to sacrifice their resent∣ment.</P>
<P>As <HI>Lucilla</HI> was perpetually en∣tering
her brother's apartment,
because <HI>Julia,</HI> as well as herself,
wanted to hear how he did every
moment. He often called her
to his bedside, and whispered,
What, my dear sister! are you
never to bring a companion with
you? Will not the amiable
<HI>Julia,</HI> console my distress by her
presence? Had she consulted
only her inclination, answered
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> you would have seen her
even more frequently than you
have done me, but she is obliged
to be peculiarly cautious of not
creating suspicions in a jealous
mind, and therefore dares not
see you without her husband:—
she has charged me to convince
you of this, and to give you, my
dear brother, from her mouth, a
thousand tender assurances of e∣ternal
friendship; and also to beg
you to inform her of all particu∣lars
relating to her father, which
you were prevented in your last
conversation from communica∣ting.</P>
<P>Ah <HI>Lucilla!</HI> said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
interrupting her, I must avail
myself of this curiosity by not
revealing the secret to any but
her dear-self! It may induce
her to have compassion.—Here
<PB N="120" REF="123"/>
he was silent,—then continuing,
Can she refuse me a favour so
essential to my recovery? Sister,
I conjure you to exert your most
perswasive eloquence? I think
my life depends on seeing her.—
Use every argument to move her
pity? <HI>Lucilla</HI> promised to use
her utmost influence with <HI>Ju∣lia.</HI></P>
<P>THE company was so nume∣rous
at Lord <HI>Howard's</HI> wedding
that the best appartments were
resigned to the ladies, and <HI>Julia</HI>
flept with <HI>Lucilla.</HI> They retired
in the evening, as early as po∣liteness
would admit, that they
might be at liberty to converse;
when the servants were with∣drawn,
<HI>Julia</HI> gave a loose to her
sorrows, throwing her arms
round <HI>Lucilla's</HI> neck, Oh my
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>
dear sister! was there ever any
thing so extraordinary as the e∣vents
of this day? Admire with
me the cruel fatality of my stars!
scarcely have I tasted the plea∣sure
of seeing again the man who
has been ever faithful, in oppo∣sition
to all the causes I have
given him to abhor me! Scarcely
had he blest me with the happy
tidings that my father lives!—
than that felicity is dashed by a
succession of the most horrid
images! I am invited to a party
of pleasure, and I see the man I
love butchered before my eyes:
the sensibility I discover in this
interesting moment, prejudices
my husband against me! I saw
the furious agitations of his soul,
marked on his brow, in the midst
of my agonizing distress, and in
spite of the violent efforts he
made to conceal them! I ought
<PB N="122" REF="125"/>
not to flatter myself he is igno∣rant
of my sentiments.—He is
convinced <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> is dearer to
me than life:—that he alone
occupies my heart!—Add to
these calamities, the severe ne∣cessity
I am under not to see him;
and comprehend if that be pos∣sible?
—We must conquer that
necessity and these scruples, my
dearest friend, interrupted <HI>Lucilla</HI>
my brother's life depends on see∣ing
you. I am injoined by him
to assure you of it,—and to con∣jure
you, by his unalterable love,
not to refuse him his only con∣solation
left.—Alas! <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
he makes no reflexions on the
impropriety of this request! and
could you have any conception
of what I have to suffer from
such an interview. Your pity
for me would prevent your de∣siring
it!—The contest between
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
love and duty is so strong, and so
near an equality, that I fear to
transgress in being too kind, or
too cruel. But <HI>Julia</HI> you are yet
unacquainted where to find your
father! a father whose memory
has been always so dear to you,
now in a manner, gained from
the depths of the sea. If you are
inflexible to the prayers of <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
surely you cannot be in∣different
to the fate of the earl of
<HI>Warwick?</HI> and my brother has
sworn to reveal it only to you!
Ah! cease to persuade me, re∣plied
<HI>Julia,</HI> my heart is already
in his interest. You second it,
—and such seducers are too strong
for the remonstrances of reason.
—How great must be the for∣titude
that enable us to shun the
sight of what is dearer than life!
Alas! our frailty on such occa∣sions
convinces us the persuasions
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>
those we love are irresistable.—
What farther objections can I
make? My dear <HI>Lucilla,</HI> I con∣sent
to visit your brother, pro∣vided
you find means of my do∣ing
it undiscovered. Let us lose
no time said <HI>Lucilla,</HI> to guard a∣gainst
surprize, I have left a wax
light ready on a back staircase
which leads to the end of the gal∣lery
terminated by our apartment;
we will tread very softly if you
please? What, in the night,
<HI>Lucilla?</HI> How dreadful would be
the consequences of a discovery?
Not, in the least, answered she,
in regard to the worlds opinion,
as it supposes we are both the
sisters of <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI> The earl
of <HI>Bedford</HI> is too well informed
of the truth, said <HI>Julia,</HI> with a
sigh. Your timidity is unrea∣sonable,
replied <HI>Lucilla,</HI> impa∣tiently;
come, come, my dear
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>
sister, no more hesitation I beg.
<HI>Julia</HI> trembled, when she quit∣ed
her apartment, and taking
hold of <HI>Lucilla,</HI> entered her bro∣ther's
chamber. He had not yet
slept, when he heard the door
open, and the unexpected sight
of his beloved <HI>Julia</HI> occasioned
an excess of pleasure that was
near proving fatal: his wounds
opened a fresh, and he was in a
deplorable state before they per∣ceived
his danger.—<HI>Julia</HI> sat
down by him:—dear <HI>Hyppo∣litus.</HI>
—Tears, which she strove
in vain to restrain stopt her voice;
—the wildness of my grief to∣day,
must have convinced you
the unfortunate <HI>Julia</HI> is altered
in situation, but not in senti∣ments:
yes, my faithful lover,
I will even confess you have been
ever more dear to me than life!
I would resign that chearfully to
<PB N="126" REF="129"/>
make you happy!—I think of
nothing but you! I lament your
misfortune.—I lament my own.
—I can never forgive my rash
credulity.—But since the evil
is past remedy, we must arm
ourselves with fortitude to en∣dure
it: I come to see you once
more,—but it is to give you a
last adieu! If I cannot govern
the emotions of my heart, I am
at least mistress of my conduct.
—There is an indispensible
necessity for our submission to
those cruel laws that duty pre∣scribes.
—Death would, to me, be
preferable to a life of ignominy;
and were we the only inhabitants
left upon the globe, I would act
as if surrounded by multitudes of
spectators!—Cease to flatter
yourself with false hopes of com∣bating
my resolution; the very
attempt would be to add new
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
woes to those already intolera∣ble!
No, my dear <HI>Julia,</HI> said
he, in a faint voice, you have
nothing to dread from my argu∣ments
or intercession, I am very
thankful you have not suffered
me long to languish in uncertain∣ty;
—you could not have formed
a more proper moment for ter∣minating
a life of misfortunes!
the state to which my wounds
have reduced me, and the rigo∣rous
sentence I have heard pro∣nounced,
will very soon deliver
you from an unhappy man, whom
you never would have abandoned
if you had truly loved. I will not
reproach you madam for desiring
my death.—Alas! you never
wished me to live!—I too, have
pressing reasons to wish for
death.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="131"/>
HE was silent; his eyes half-closed;
—his complexion pale.
—<HI>Julia,</HI> in the anguish of her
soul, begged <HI>Lncilla</HI> to call <HI>Le∣ander</HI>
to assist them:—they both
flew to the bed from whence
life was issuing in streams of
blood.—Their distress and ter∣ror
was not to be described.—
They tried to make <HI>Leander</HI>
comprehend it,—who though
dangerously hurt himself, rose
immediately to bind up the
wounds of his friend. <HI>Julia</HI>
was inconsolable at the despair
her words had excited in the
mind of her lover:—she wept
over the hand she held:—you
have not explained my senti∣ments
in the manner I wished,
said she, but since there is only
this alternative, that you must
either see me, or die, the choice
is easily determined my dear
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> since no misfortune
can bear the least competition
with a loss too great for sensi∣bility
to support.—<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> at∣tempted
to kiss her hand, which
she suddenly withdrew.—I con∣fess
said she, guilt magnifies every
fault I am committing.—The
slightest favour I now grant, ap∣pears
criminal! <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> re∣concile
my sense of duty with
the encouragement of your pas∣sion,
and I will be contented!
They are not so irreconcileable
as you at present imagine! You
have been hurried into a detested
engagement without the appro∣bation
of your father.—No,
fair <HI>Julia,</HI> he will never consent
to this outrage to parental autho∣rity,
—I will prevent your doubts
—I will produce incontestible
proof.—<HI>Lucilla,</HI> help to untie
this ribband which fastens it
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>
round my arm? Here are your
father's sentiments! presenting
her a letter which convinced her
of the truth of his assertion.—
Yes, madam, your father is de∣termined
to draw you from those
unworthy hands that have rob∣bed
him of his daughter; and it
will depend upon yourself, whe∣ther
you will pronounce me hap∣py.
—<HI>Julia</HI> was exceedingly
embarrassed, not that she hesi∣tated
what answer she ought to
make, but was undetermined
whether to make any that time.
She regarded the marriage vow
as an indispensible obligation,
and was conscious, whatever de∣ceit
had been practised, no vio∣lence
had compelled her to give
her hand; nor was she insensible
to the censure of the world on
such occasions—She feared to
explain her sentiments to <HI>Hyppo∣litus.</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="134"/>
—He perceived the con∣flict
in her soul.—I am lost,
madam! he exclaimed, you no
longer love me! You balance if
you should express the least joy
at an information that would
have filled you with the highest
rapture if your heart was not
changed.</P>
<P>ALAS <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> she re∣plied,
that heart is too constant
in its attachment! your reproach
is unjust. When my father ar∣rives,
I will obey him in every
injunction that is not repugnant
to conscience and honour. Are
you not dearer than life, inter∣rupted
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> in a calmer
tone, can you think me incapa∣ble
of wishing any thing that
can offend my <HI>Julia?</HI> Compre∣hend
better the delicacy and ex∣tent
of my passion? I do them
<PB N="132" REF="135"/>
all the justice you can desire!
and it is that motive which induces
me to take in your favour a step
so uncommon and perhaps in∣defensible.
—Know how to va∣lue
without abusing my confi∣dence,
aud tell me all that con∣cerns
my father? <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
was not tardy in giving an exact
narrative of all that related to the
earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> nor did the fair
<HI>Julia</HI> conceal his emotions of
joy, at discovering the fresh ob∣ligations
she owed her lover. I
am indebted to you said she, for
my father's liberty, nay, perhaps
his life! nor can I without in∣gratitude,
refuse you my warmest
acknowlegments.</P>
<P>LUCILLA now thought it pro∣per
to interrupt them, with a∣nouncing
the approach of day;
and that it was absolutely neces∣sary
<PB N="133" REF="136"/>
for them to have a little rest.
—The gentlemen made her
some polite reproaches on the in∣terruption
of a conversation so a∣greeably
interesting; but <HI>Julia,</HI>
who was convinced of the pro∣priety
of retiring, conjured <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
to think of nothing but
his recovery: I most sincerely
wish it, my dear brother, giving
her hand which he tenderly kis∣sed,
and you would injure me
to doubt my sympathizing in all
you suffer.—She said a thou∣sand
obliging things to <HI>Leander,</HI>
and then retired with <HI>Lucilla</HI> to
her own appartment.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI> jealous
inquietude had kept him awake
the whole night:—he meditated
the most cruel punishment that
hearts engaged by strong affec∣tion
can suffer; and to prevent
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>
disappointment, called in the as∣sistance
of art. He did not rise
in the morning, pretending to be
seized with a fever, that made it
necessary he should return home.
<HI>Julia,</HI> not daring to raise any
objections, flew instantly to <HI>Hyp∣politus's</HI>
room,—My dear bro∣ther,
I must leave you;—the
earl is determined to go.—I
again repeat, take all proper re∣solutions
with my father that are
consistent with my honour.—
Adieu! deplore and love me! I
bequeath you to the care of <HI>Lu∣cilla,</HI>
who will stay here till you
are perfectly recovered. You a∣bandon
me <HI>Julia!</HI> cried he in a
tone expressive of the utmost
anguish. The destroyer of my
repose tears you from me! Ah!
too charming felicity, how soon
art thou vanished! But may I
not expect, madam, you will re∣turn?
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
Alas! said she, sighing,
I am unable to satisfy you:—I
fear to be a wretched prisoner to
an inexorable goaler! <HI>Lucilla</HI>
came running to say the coach
was at the door, and the earl
waited; the passionate <HI>Hyppoli∣tus</HI>
kissing her hand, and bathing
it with tears; adieu! my adorable
<HI>Julia!</HI> said he, in an agony of
grief, adieu! be true to the most
faithful and unfortunate of all
human beings! <HI>Julia</HI> answered
by taking a fine <HI>Turquoise</HI> stone
ring from her finger, and put∣ting
it upon his. May <HI>Heaven</HI>
accelerate your father's return!
he exclaimed. I wish it with the
utmost ardour, interrupted <HI>Julia,</HI>
expect every thing from my af∣fection!
but leave not my deli∣cacy
the least reproach:—Let
my virtue,—the laws of honour,
—and those of society be satis∣fied.
<PB N="136" REF="139"/>
—With these words she
departed to take leave of Lady
<HI>Nevil,</HI> to whom she earnestly re∣commended
her brother; and
tenderly bidding a thousand a∣dieus
to <HI>Lucilla.</HI> They separa∣ted
with a melancholy presenti∣ment
of the misfortune that
threatened their repose.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> lost no
time in giving secret orders for
preparing all things for a voyage
to <HI>France;</HI> and though he was
obliged to defer it three days, he
did not acquaint his wife with
this intention till he gave her his
hand to lead her to the coach;
with difficulty she snatched a
moment to take her jewels with
her; but sought one in vain to
advertise her dear <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and
<HI>Lucilla</HI> of this mortifying stroke,
to implore their assistance,—or
<PB N="137" REF="140"/>
console them in the affliction she
knew they would be involved.</P>
<P>THE earl's vigilance discon∣certed
all her attempts. <HI>Isabella,</HI>
her woman, informed her of
her h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sband's design, and her
penetration represented on the
instant, all she had to fear.—
Obdurate to her tears and pa∣thetic
remonstrances, the earl
obliged her to accompany him.
—In what, my lord, have I
offended you? in an accent of
softness capable of touching the
most sensible heart, would it not
be kind to enter into some sort of
explanation, sir, before you con∣demn
me?—You will always
have the power of punishment
in reserve, but when once in∣flicted,
you no longer have the
means of reparing the injury done
to my reputation and peace of
<PB N="138" REF="141"/>
mind. Examine your own heart,
madam, said he, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h an air of
resentment; that will justify my
proceeding! and if I avoid en∣tering
into a long detail of cir∣cumstances,
it is not because I
act merely from suspicion, or am
not sufficiently enlightened by
the injuries I have received.—
But this is no time to amuse our∣selves
with useless altercation.—
Deaf to her complaints,—un∣moved
by her tears, he pursued
the road to <HI>Dover;</HI> denied the
satisfaction to write to <HI>Hyppoli∣tus;</HI>
—she remained silent.—
They embarked for <HI>Calais,</HI>—
which they reached in a few
hours.—<HI>Julia</HI> offered up her
vows for a storm to drive them
back to <HI>England</HI> with as much
zeal, as she would have shewn
at any other time for a prospe∣rous
gale. She lay upon the
<PB N="139" REF="142"/>
deck, her hand supporting her
head, her face shaded with a
veil, and her eyes straining to
catch the last faint glimpse of
that shore she quitted with in∣expressible
reluctance:—They
drag me from thee my dear
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> whispered the un∣happy
mourner, whilst thou art
enjoying the pleasing hope of
smiling fortune! Blasted are
those hopes! Perhaps we part
for ever!—Perhaps, wretch that
I am, I may be the fatal instru∣ment
of thy death—Alas! how
wilt thou be able to support the
cruel violence of this separa∣tion.</P>
<P>LOST in these sad reflexions,
the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> hurried her
into a boat which landed him at
<HI>Calais;</HI> it was very late, and he
left her to pass the remainder of
<PB N="140" REF="143"/>
the night with <HI>Isabella</HI> She
was no sooner alone with that
faithful servant, than she cut
these words with a diamond pen∣cil
on the window:</P>
<P>“IF chance should conduct
you here, my dear H. and your
heart teaches your eyes to ac∣knowledge
these characters of the
unfortunate J—. receive them as
solemn assurances of eternal fi∣delity.
—Be constant; and, if
you would convince me of the
sincerity of your passion, be not
too much afflicted!”</P>
<P>It was no sooner day, than the
earl continued his rout to <HI>Paris,</HI>
passing through that delightful
city without allowing his coun∣tess,
oppressed as she was, with grief
and fatigue, the least interval of
rest. They travelled towards
<PB N="141" REF="144"/>
<HI>Bourbon,</HI> whose waters were
thought salutary in consumptive
cases, and much resorted to by
the <HI>English</HI> of that time, but
stopped short at the abbey of St.
<HI>Menoux,</HI> in a fine, but solitary
situation, between <HI>Moulins</HI> and
<HI>Bourbon;</HI> a part of <HI>France,</HI> which
were it not for the company in
the water drinking seasons, would
be quite a desart.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> was ac∣quainted
with the abbess, a young
person, of the illustrious house
of <HI>Amboise,</HI> very vain and inte∣rested,
and not very judicious;
he had no doubt of convincing
her of the propriety of his con∣duct,
or of perswading her to
receive his wife. He requested
to speak with this lady, and
making his own conditions, a∣greed
to settle a large pension.—
<PB N="142" REF="145"/>
The abbess, on her part, pro∣mising
<HI>Julia</HI> should be more
strictly guarded than a state pri∣soner,
and not suffered to see or
write to any person out of the
convent, which was all the earl
desired. Presenting <HI>Julia</HI> and
<HI>Isabella</HI> to the abbess, he hoped
in a sarcastic tone, her <HI>Adonis</HI>
would hazard his delicate person
no more on her account,—or be
taken a second time prisoner in
the disguise of a pedlar.</P>
<P>THIS ironical reproach, ex∣cited
the keenest resentment—
Forbear my lord, said <HI>Julia,</HI> to
search for pretexts to varnish o∣ver
the indignity with which you
thought proper to treat me!—I
am totally innocent of the dis∣guise
you allude to; and in my
present unhappy circumstances,
my sole consolation is to be free
<PB N="143" REF="146"/>
from self-reproach! Nothing
can exceed the injustice of your
reflexions.—Time will vindi∣cate
my character.—The earl
made no reply, and departed
perfectly satisfied with the wis∣dom
of his conduct in this af∣fair.</P>
<P>JULIA remained at the mer∣cy
of the abbess, who ceded very
little of that severity she had en∣gaged
to exercise;—so that only
those religious appointed to watch
her steps, were allowed to con∣verse
with her. <HI>Isabella,</HI> alone,
was permitted to wait on her.—
This girl who had the strongest
attachment to her mistress, em∣ployed
all her understanding,
which was not contemptible, in
finding out reasons to reassume
her fortitude.—Madam, said
she, rely upon the constancy of
<PB N="144" REF="147"/>
<HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>—Your husband may,
<HI>God</HI> willing, chance to die!—
The earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> may have
interest, as we hope, to set your
marriage aside. And the greatest
misfortune come to an end one
time or other.</P>
<P>THE termination of mine,
said <HI>Julia,</HI> in a languishing voice,
will be that of my life! Vain
would be all attempts to reco∣ver
liberty. Instead of one I am
surrounded by fifty goalers! A
slave to the caprice of a husband,
yet dare not indulge the hope of
a dissolution of our marriage, nor
am I convinced that I can wish
it without tarnishing my fame,
and honour. Do I know that
the love of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> is supe∣rior
to time or fate? And should
the law and my conscience coin∣cide,
and <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> remain faith∣ful,
<PB N="145" REF="148"/>
how am I to find the means
of escape?—No one knows
where to seek me; nor can I in∣form
them! Every letter I have
attempted to write has been in∣terrupted,
and I only suffer the
shame and mortification of use∣less
efforts!</P>
<P>THESE were their conversations
in the day; and <HI>Julia</HI> wasted
the night in tears and groans.—
Sleep stole but few moments
from sorrow; and her spirits be∣came
so exhausted, that her con∣stitution
gave way, and her
health declined hourly.</P>
<P>WHILST this was her state
at St. <HI>Monoux,</HI> let us return to
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who was the last per∣son
informed of the misfortune
which had happened. <HI>Lucilla</HI>
dispatched a messenger into <HI>Berk∣shire,</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="149"/>
to learn news of her friend,
who gained no other intelligence
from the earls domestics, than
that their lord and lady were
gone to <HI>London</HI> on particular bu∣siness,
the answer they had orders
to give.—<HI>Lucilla</HI> could not help
being alarmed at a departure so
precipitate, of which she had
not received the least intimation.
—Not able to comprehend
the meaning; she naturally con∣cluded
there was something mys∣terious
in their proceeding; and
in order to come at the truth,
she told her brother, <HI>Julia</HI> had
sent to desire her company for a
few days, and he might depend
she would soon be with him a∣gain.
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> conjured her
to say every thing tender and
passionate to express his impati∣ence
to see the mistress of his
soul.—<HI>Leander</HI> and he were
<PB N="147" REF="150"/>
pretty well recovered of their
wounds, which were never dan∣gerous;—and
the certainty of
soon hearing news of his beloved
<HI>Julia,</HI> had exhilerated the spirits
of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> above their usual
pitch; so that he was tempted
to question his friend what pro∣gress
he had made in his passion
for <HI>Lucilla?</HI></P>
<P>I ASSURE you, continued he,
I often deny myself the pleasure
of talking with her of <HI>Julia,</HI> that
I may give you the opportunity
of engaging in conversation.—
Ah! my dear friend, said <HI>Lean∣der,
Lucilla</HI> is too circumspect to
allow me to discover whether her
heart is susceptible of tenderness!
I have represented mine with the
timidity of a man truly enamour∣ed;
but her talent for raillery,
will not suffer her to give me a
<PB N="148" REF="151"/>
serious reply, notwithstanding all
my supplications. At first I was
charmed with the gaiety of her
humour, but I am unable to ac∣commodate
myself to its perpe∣tuity;
nor am I free from dis∣tressful
apprehensions that she is
not prepossessed in my favour.—
I believe I am the better physi∣ognomist
of the two,—replied
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and capable of mak∣ing
the coolest observations.—
My art assures me she does not
regard you with indifference!—
The manner she speaks of you,
to me, and the esteem she ex∣presses,
are sufficient demonstra∣tions.—she
cunningly enquired
in a careless way, if you had not
a mistress in <HI>Italy?</HI> And when
I answered in the negative, slily
testified her incredulity, that a
man of so much merit could be
disengaged! Why, if his looks are
<PB N="149" REF="152"/>
a true indication, said I smiling,
he does not want sensibility; but
perhaps, sister, it may have been
only awakened since he has
seen you? If you have inspired
him with tender sentiments, I
hope you will aid me in discharg∣ing
the obligations I owe him?
Pray brother, said she, don't in∣sist
on my paying your debts?
Your sense of gratitude is so
much more exalted than mine, I
am satisfied your friend has too
refined a taste to agree to the ex∣change.</P>
<P>WHAT, my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
and have you really conversed
with <HI>Lucilla</HI> in these terms?—
Just as I tell you, replied <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
without effecting to turn
the conversation that way, I ea∣sily
perceived she was very well
pleased with the subject!</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="153"/>
DURING their discourse, <HI>Lu∣cilla,</HI>
arrived in <HI>Berkshire;</HI> she at
first found it difficult to satisfy
her curiosity, several of the ser∣vants
were really ignorant, and
the more knowing ones afraid to
declare what they knew.—At
length, she applied to the steward,
whom she had recommended to
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and from
him learned that <HI>Julia</HI> was car∣ried
to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>A FLOOD of tears! and re∣peated
complaints, were evident
marks of her extreme fondness
for her friend. Throwing her∣self
into a chair, she remained a
long time in the deepest distress,
greatly embarassed in what man∣ner
to explain this misfortune to
her brother, she feared the effect
it might have on his health, to
communicate it; and dreaded
<PB N="151" REF="154"/>
the injury it might be to her <HI>Julia</HI>
to conceal it. Undetermined
how to act, she thought it
might be best to consult <HI>Leander</HI>
in this critical emergency.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS, impatient for
her return, the moment he heard
of it, sent to beg she would come
to him immediately. Whatever
were her efforts to conceal the
anguish of her soul, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
discovered the alteration it had
made in her countenance. At∣tempt
not to flatter me, sister,
said he,—with extreme emotion,
some accident has befallen <HI>Julia,</HI>
I see you are contriving how to
conceal it, but the deception
will be attended with as bad
consequences, as an ample dis∣covery.—I
have no intention to
deceive you, said she, <HI>Julia</HI> has
been ill, the remains of weakness
<PB N="152" REF="155"/>
from the last attack, joined to
perturbation of mind for what
passed in this house, occasioned
a return of fever. In other re∣spects
I found her more composed
and tranquil than I could have
hoped.</P>
<P>HERE tears filled her eyes,
in spite of her endeavours to re∣strain
them. Ah! <HI>Lucilla,</HI> said
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> you tell me but half
my misfortune. Something more
dreadful is still behind!—You
weep,—the words tremble on
your lips.—Sister, for <HI>God's</HI> sake
speak;—or I die!—What has
happened? <HI>Julia's</HI> interest must
ever be inseparable from mine;
—her afflictions are mine.—
The presentiment I have is so
frought with horror,—there is
little danger of augmenting my
sorrows by communication!—
<PB N="153" REF="156"/>
<HI>Lucilla</HI> again repeated what she
had told him.—You know the
excess of my friendship for <HI>Julia,</HI>
yet even surprized at these marks
of sensibility which are its natu∣ral
consequence!—Would it
not have been greater cause of
wonder to see me unaffected with
her illness? My heart impresses
the truth too forcibly.—Ah
<HI>Lucilla!</HI> it is no easy task to de∣ceive
one who loves like me.—
I am determined to set out this
moment for <HI>Berkshire,</HI> should it
cost me my life, to unravel this
mystery! He rung the bell vi∣olently,
and ordered his gentle∣man
to help him to rise. This
attendant was but just returned
from executing a commission
to the earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI> whom
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> had informed of all
that had passed at Lord <HI>Nevil's,</HI>
entreating him to make diligent
<PB N="154" REF="157"/>
enquiry whether his father was
advertised of these transactions,
that he might take measures ac∣cordingly.
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> seeing her
brother resolved, notwithstand∣ing
his wounds, to take a jour∣ney
into <HI>Berkshire,</HI> approached
towards <HI>Leander,</HI> addressing him
in a low voice, Good <HI>God!</HI> sir,
what are we to do? <HI>Julia</HI> is no
longer in <HI>Berkshire.</HI>—The earl
has carried her into <HI>France!</HI>—
What words can we find to ac∣quaint
my brother with this
misfortune? You see what his
present intentions are.</P>
<P>LEANDER'S consternation was
inexpressible. He could not have
been more affected had <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
herself, been carried away.—
He paused, and finding she ex∣pected
an answer, Alas! said he,
madam, I have no idea of con∣cealing
<PB N="155" REF="158"/>
any circumstance from
<HI>Hyppolitus.</HI> His agitations are
already so violent, it would be a
species of cruelty to let him re∣main
longer in suspence!</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS observing them
whisper earnestly, leaned on his
servant's arm, and walked to <HI>Le∣ander's</HI>
bed. Sitting down by it,
he fixed his eyes upon him with
a despairing look; <HI>Lucilla</HI> has
been making you her confident,
I suppose. I am the person prin∣cipally
concerned in her afflic∣tion,
and the only one from
whom the cause is to be kept a
secret. Brother, said <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
since my face is too faithful an
index of what passes in my heart,
I will confess the truth: The
earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> instigated by
rage and jealousy, has forced
<HI>Julia</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> I cannot learn
<PB N="156" REF="159"/>
to what part.—I had this account
from the steward, whose orders
were not to discover it.—This is
the foundation of my distress,
which I wished you uninformed
of, at least for some days.—
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> clasping his hands to∣gether,
hung down his head in
speechless agony.—My dear
friend, said <HI>Leander,</HI> thank <HI>Hea∣ven!</HI>
this is not an irremediable
misfortune! We shall easily dis∣cover
where the traitor has con∣fined
her;—we will fly to re∣dress
her;—you will be her de∣liverer;—the
earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>
will unite his assistance;—no go∣vernment
will suffer, a man un∣der
the influence of visionary
chimeras to be guilty of such ty∣rannical
treatment, to a woman
of rank with impunity.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="160"/>
AH! how flattering would
these hopes be, said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
in a disconsolate accent, if my
own imagination did not furnish
me with a thousand reasons in
opposition. I am the fatal cause
of all her sufferings. It is my
impetuous love that plunged her
into this abyss of sorrow!—
You point out a distant prospect
of snatching her from it.—What
a weak consolation.—How am
I to bear the dreadful interval?
Good <HI>God!</HI> how indeed! A∣bandoned
to these irrational tran∣sports,
which his sister and his
friend were spectators of with the
deepest concern, a servant came
to inform them of the earl of
<HI>Sussex's</HI> arrival. Before they re∣covered
their surprize the earl
was in the room, and not a little
alarmed to discover in their coun∣tenances
the marks of recent afflic∣tion.
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> unable to rise,
extended his arms to embrace
him: You are come, my dear
friend to share my affliction! Is
it possible to conceive any more
exquisite. I know not what
fresh subject of complaint you
may have my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
said the earl, but I thought it
right you should hear from me,
that your father has been inform∣ed
where you are, and will be
with you to-morrow:—he is
violently enraged, and we must
consult what is best to be done.
I should think you ought to lose
no time in acquainting Lord <HI>Ne∣vil</HI>
that I am come at your fa∣ther's
request, to attend you to
<HI>London;</HI> instead of which, I will
carry you to a retired spot where
you will have leisure to take
such measures as may be judged
expedient.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="162"/>
INSTEAD of replying to his
friend's proposal, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> ex∣claimed
in a frantic voice,—I
shall never see her more! The
tyrant has ravished her from me
for ever! I sink under the stroke.
—These expressions alarmed
the earl of <HI>Sussex.</HI>—He regarded
<HI>Lucilla</HI> with an eye of curiosity
that testified his desire to be in∣formed
of their tendency; which
she instantly gratified.</P>
<P>AN unexpected misfortune,
indeed! said he, embracing <HI>Hyp∣politus;</HI>
but your courage will
enable you to conquer it! Be
guided by me, and let us be gone
directly—It would be highly
improper to meet your father's
anger.—When we are at a distance
in a safer place, we will consi∣der
how to recover <HI>Julia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="163"/>
THEY acquiesced in the earl's
opinion.—I leave you, amia∣ble
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> whispered <HI>Leander;</HI>
friendship, in this instance, tri∣umphs
over love. But pay some
regard to the sacrifice I make in
favour of a brother, whom you
have acknowledged to be infinitely
dear to you. I attach my fate to
his.—I go, madam.—I tear
myself from you;—and I adore
you.—To be assured you are
not insensible to my devotion,
for both would be some consola∣tion
in absence.—I am too
much obliged to you, answered
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> blushing, to regard your
friendship for my brother with
indifference! cease to press a
farther explanation, but be per∣swaded
I render justice to your
merit, and behold your departure
with regret.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="164"/>
LEANDER'S rapture at this o∣bliging
farewell, was inexpressi∣ble.—He
was not less reduced
than <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> from the great
loss of blood he had sustained.—
And Lord and Lady <HI>Nevil</HI> used
every argument to persuade them
to stay longer: not knowing Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> was expected the next
day, or the material reasons they
had for avoiding his presence,
they were surprized to find their
guests persist in pouring out a
profusion of thanks for their kind
humanity, in a manner that
shewed their purpose was not to
be shaken.—<HI>Lucilla</HI> did not
endure this separation without a
flood of tears.—Her brother pro∣mised
she should hear from him,
and <HI>Leander</HI> begged permission
to acquaint her with their pro∣ceedings;
nor was she displeased
to have so plausible a pretext for
<PB N="162" REF="165"/>
granting what she so earnestly
wished.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> mounted
his horse, and resigned his coach
for the accommodation of his
wounded friends; who with the
assistance of a mattress and cur∣tains,
travelled much at their ease.
In the situation <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> then
was, what regarded his health
appeared of small consequence;
and <HI>Leander</HI> was so deeply in
love, that the thought of being
absent from <HI>Lucilla,</HI> made him
as miserable as a man in that cir∣cumstance
usually is.—They
spoke little, and in a plaintive
style.—At about forty miles dis∣tance
from Lord <HI>Nevil's,</HI> was a
magnificent castle, where the
marchioness of <HI>Northampton</HI> re∣sided,
a young, and beautiful wi∣dow
of that marquiss, who had
<PB N="163" REF="166"/>
been executed with the duke of
<HI>Northumberland</HI> and Lord <HI>Guil∣ford
Dudley.</HI> Here this lady re∣tired,
and dedicated the spring of
life to grief and meditation—
The earl of Sussex was strongly
soliciting her return to court with
Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> but had hitherto
been unsuccessful. In reality all
his indifference proved insuffici∣ent
to guard him from the charms
of this distressed fair one; he had
visited her frequently since the
ruin of her house, and was so
touched with her sweetness, vir∣tue
and generosity, that what he
at first imagined only sentiments
of pity, proved to be the softer
emotions of love.</P>
<P>BY this lady the two friends
were received with the most flat∣tering
marks of civility. Her
own misfortunes disposed her to
<PB N="164" REF="167"/>
sympathize with, and endeavour
to alleviate those of others; she
interested herself with great hu∣manity
in the affliction of <HI>Hyp∣politus;</HI>
and the earl of <HI>Sussex</HI>
was too well convinced of her
discretion to wish to conceal the
innocent attachment of his friend;
whom the marchioness entreated
him to assure, it would be doing
the greatest favour imaginable to
accept of her house and purse, as
long as they could be of any ser∣vice
to his affairs. <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
insensible as he remained to most
things, felt these generous pro∣fessions
with the warmest grati∣titude,
which broke through the
cloud of melancholy that sur∣rounded
him, in expressions e∣qual
to the occasion.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the earl of
<HI>Douglas</HI> arrived at Lord <HI>Nevil's;</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="168"/>
but there is no describing his
rage at hearing his son was gone.
—In vain did he essay to disco∣ver
the place of his concealment;
the earl of <HI>Sussex's</HI> precaution
induced him to travel all night
through bye roads;—and af∣ter
they were lodged at the mar∣chioness's
house, he omitted no
step to prevent suspicion.—
The amiable <HI>Lucilla</HI> experienced
the effects of her father's ill hu∣mour;
he loaded her with re∣proaches;
he accused her of act∣ing
in concert with <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
and said every thing the most
grating and disagreeable, during
their journey to <HI>London.</HI> Wholly
unmoved by the recital of <HI>Julia's</HI>
adventure, his particular interest
rendered him insensible to the
cruelty of her fate, and stifled
those sentiments of tenderness
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
which humanity naturally in∣spired.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS consulted with
his friends on the most eligible
means to pursue: to overtake
the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> was imprac∣ticable,
had they even been ac∣quainted
with the road he tra∣velled.
They agreed to separate,
each of them was to repair to a
different seaport, to watch the
earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI> return to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and whosoever should first
meet with him, engaged to force
him to answer for his conduct.</P>
<P>WHEN the strength of <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
and <HI>Leander</HI> was suffici∣ently
recruited, they informed
<HI>Lucilla</HI> of their intentions, leav∣ing
their letters to the care of
the marchioness, to whom they
acknowledged the highest sense
<PB N="167" REF="170"/>
of obligation for her hospitality.
—Nothing could be more affec∣tionate
than their reciprocal a∣dieus.—How
infinitely am I
indebted to you my dear friends!
said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> pressing them to
his breast. You embrace my
quarrel, you expose your lives to
revenge it, and far from oppo∣sing
your zeal, as perhaps I
ought, I conjure you to exert
your utmost endeavours to find
my enemy! They assured him
he might safely rely on their vi∣gilance
to demonstrate the sin∣cerity
of their friendship at the
hazard of their lives. It was a∣greed
after the expiration of a
month, they were to meet at the
earl of <HI>Sussex's</HI> house in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>THE earl then embarked for
<HI>Dieppe,—Hyppolitus</HI> for <HI>Calais,</HI>
and <HI>Leander,</HI> who accompanied
<PB N="168" REF="171"/>
him on board the pacquet at
<HI>Dover,</HI> and landed at <HI>Guern∣sey.</HI></P>
<P>THE weather was favourable.
But let us now follow <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
to <HI>Calais.</HI>—Chance guided him
to the same inn where <HI>Julia</HI> had
lodged.—His enquiries, and
the description he gave, gained
such intelligence from his hos∣tess,
as drew on a succession of
questions natural to the curiosity
and anxiety of a lover:—as
whether she seemed dejected?—
Whether she eat?—What she
said?—He desired to have the
chamber she slept in; which he
entered with the very same
emotion as if she had been there.
As he traversed the room with
interrupted steps, ruminating
deeply on his disappointment,—
he happened to turn his eyes to∣wards
<PB N="169" REF="172"/>
the window, where her
pencil had addressed him;—
Good <HI>God!</HI> what a transport of
wonder, pleasure and consola∣tion
did that sight create! he
kissed the well-known charac∣ters;
and thus enriched, he re∣garded
that pane of glass as a more
brilliant treasure, than all the
diamonds of the east.—This
tender testimony of his <HI>Julia's</HI>
remembrance, added new fer∣vour
to his passion; excited his
gratitude to her who was dearer
than life. He lost no time in
using proper methods to be in∣formed
of the earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI>
arrival, should he pass through
<HI>Calais;</HI> where he waited for him
three weeks, impatient of re∣venge.
At length, one evening,
he saw the earl upon the beach,
stepping into a boat, in order to
embark on board the packet.—
<PB N="170" REF="173"/>
Then indignation sparkled in his
eyes:—he hastily seized him
by the arm,—Before you return
to <HI>England,</HI> my lord, said he
haughtily, I have something to
say to you.—The earl, irri∣tated
at his manner of speaking,
and still more enflamed by mo∣tives
of resentment, had not the
least objection to follow <HI>Hyppo∣litus.</HI>—They
spoke not a word,
—but every glance they cast on
each other, provoked their fury
to the highest pitch.—They
stopped in a remote place, ap∣parently
secure from interrup∣tion,
when drawing their swords
with precipitation, the one ani∣mated
by love and rage, the o∣ther
by jealousy and resentment,
they fought in a manner likely to
terminate in the death of one, if
not both antagonists.—Un∣guarded,
and careless of life, each
<PB N="171" REF="174"/>
gave and received several despa∣rate
wounds, till <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> im∣patient
at meeting with such an
obstinate resistance, from a man
he detested, redoubled his ef∣forts,
and, by a vigorous push,
threw the earl on the ground,
and reduced him to ask his life,
which was generously granted,
on condition he released <HI>Julia</HI>
from confinement. At that in∣stant,
the earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI> valet,
who had followed his lord at a
distance, and concealed himself
behind a boat during the com∣bat,
perceiving the extremity to
which he was reduced, run be∣hind
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and stabbed him
in the back—He dropped to
all appearance, dead; and the
valet concluding him so, did not
repeat the blow, but raising his
master in his arms, supported
him to a fisherman's hut, where
<PB N="172" REF="175"/>
he laid him upon a bed. A sur∣geon
was immediately sent for,
who dressed his wounds, but
finding the earl resolute not to
remain at <HI>Calais,</HI> he removed
him into the boat, that was still
in waiting. on board the <HI>Dover</HI>
pacquet, insisting on the surgeon's
attendance to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>WHILST the unfortunate <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
was left unassisted and
weltering in blood, and the night
so far advanced, there was little
probability any passenger should
travel that way: his gentleman,
whose attachment to his master
was very uncommon, always ap∣prehensive
lest he should meet
with some accident, and find∣ing
it grew late without his re∣turn,
employed a number of per∣sons
with flambeaus to search in
different parts of the town.—
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
As <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> had been three
weeks at <HI>Calais,</HI> he began to be
pretty well known to the inha∣bitants:
they soon gained intel∣ligence
of the way he was seen
to walk, with a person who
seemed to be of quality. Ad∣vancing
towards the fisher's hut,
a track of blood was visible;
they pursued it till they came to
the spot where <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> lay, ex∣tended
without sense or motion.
Cutting some branches of oziers,
and twisting them into a kind of
cradle, they conveyed him with
tender care to his lodgings. He
was judged to be in so dange∣rous
a situation, that his gentle∣man
thought it indispensibly ne∣cessary
to write to the earl of
<HI>Douglas</HI> without delay.</P>
<P>THE earl and countess was
extremely affected with this me∣lancholy
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>
account of an only son,
of such distinguished merit as in∣terested
the most indifferent per∣sons
in his favour.—The effect
it must have on every part of
his family may be easily con∣ceived.</P>
<P>HIS afflicted parents set out
immediately, and finding him on
the verge of the grave, began to
reproach themselves, now it ap∣peared
too late, with the violent
measures they had urged to op∣pose
a passion so justifiable and
innocent as that of <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>
He perceived, and was touched
with their distress, and forget∣ting
the rigour of their conduct,
conjured them to moderate the
transports of their sorrow, if they
did not wish him to sink under
its pressure.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="178"/>
THE earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Lean∣der</HI>
met in <HI>London,</HI> at the time
appointed, and no sooner heard
of the duel and its melancholy
consequences to their friend,
than they determined to return
with speed to <HI>France. Hyppoli∣tus</HI>
was as much rejoiced at their
presence, as the weakness of his
spirits would admit;—and they
beheld this apparent danger with
the strongest emotions of grief.
Notwithstanding the anguish he
endured, he exerted himself in
presenting <HI>Leander</HI> to Lord and
Lady <HI>Douglas,</HI> conjuring them
to consider him as the brother of
his choice, and one, whom if it
should be the will of <HI>Heaven</HI> to
deprive them of a son, would
supply that tender relation with
affection and duty. These pa∣thetic
words melted all present
into tears. However, in about
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
two months, there was a visible
amendment in the health of <HI>Hyp∣politus.</HI></P>
<P>DURING this interval, <HI>Lean∣der,</HI>
whose passion for <HI>Lucilla</HI>
encreased every hour; had en∣gaged
the earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI> to re∣present
his pretensions in the most
favourable light to Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI>
and try to discover if an alliance
would be agreeable, that he might
no longer delay writing to his
father on that interesting subject.
—His friendship with <HI>Alberti,</HI>
—the personal merit of <HI>Leander,</HI>
—connected with his immense
fortune, had their proper weight
with the earl of <HI>Douglas.</HI>—
Convinced he could no where
find a more advantageous con∣nection
for his daughter, he lis∣tened
to the proposal with the
highest satisfaction. <HI>Leander,</HI>
transported with joy, immedi∣ately
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>
wrote to his father, at the
same time soliciting one of his
most intimate friends to endea∣vour
to soften the first sallies of
wrath.—He implored the for∣giveness
of the deception con∣cerning
his journey; and said
every thing to extenuate his
fault, expatiated largely on the
beauty and accomplishments of
<HI>Lucilla.;</HI> acquainted him with
the favourable disposition of Lord
<HI>Douglas,</HI> begging him not to re∣fuse
his consent to an alliance in
which his heart was so deeply
concerned, and on whose success
the future happiness of his life
depended. Senator <HI>Alberti,</HI>—
though extremely surprized to
hear his son was in <HI>England</HI> when
he believed him at <HI>Rome,</HI> would
not suffer his anger to interfere
in destroying the hopes and ex∣pectations
he had raised. Tho∣rougly
<PB N="178" REF="181"/>
acquainted with the ho∣nourable
house of <HI>Douglas,</HI> pleas∣ed
with the amiable virtues of
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and, judging of the
sister's accomplishments by those
of her brother,—<HI>Lucilla</HI> ap∣peared
to his imagination, the
perfection of beauty;—prepos∣sessions
which induced him to
give his free consent and appro∣bation
to the proposed marriage;
and also to order the necessary
remittances for <HI>Leander's</HI> ap∣pearing
with splendour suitable
to his rank.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS began to recruit
before this happy news arrived,
—and participated in the joy of
his friend and sister; which con∣tributed
not a little to his cure:
—medical gentlemen strongly
recommended his taking the
waters of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> but he was
<PB N="179" REF="182"/>
not in a humour to hearken to
their advice; his soul was en∣tirely
occupied with schemes of
vengeance.—Unable to sup∣port
himself, he was meditating
a return to <HI>England</HI> in pursuit of
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> either to
put him to death or perish by his
hand. But the tears of his mo∣ther;—the
authority and inter∣position
of his father;—the
tender and united supplications
of <HI>Lucilla,</HI> and his two friends,
rendered it impossible for a heart
like that of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> to longer
resist.—Alas! said he, what is it
you exact from my complaisance?
that I have recourse to remedies
when I conceal within my bo∣som
the slow-consuming poison
which counteracts all these heal∣ing
properties:—How much
more manly;—how much more
noble, to employ the small re∣mains
<PB N="180" REF="183"/>
of life in punishing the ty∣rant
of <HI>Julia.</HI> This argument
had no influence with his family,
who were prepared to controvert
it with all the eloquence of af∣fection:
and as soon as he was
able to quit his bed, the mar∣riage
of <HI>Leander</HI> and <HI>Lucilla</HI> was
solemnized to the satisfaction of
these happy lovers.</P>
<P>IN about four months from
the time of the duel, the wounds
of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> were sufficiently
healed to enable him to endure
the motion of a carriage.—The
countess of <HI>Douglas,</HI> determined
to accompany her daughter to
<HI>Florence;</HI>—and <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> con∣sented
to travel in his equipage
part of the road to <HI>Bourbon.</HI> The
two earls set out for <HI>London,</HI> se∣parately,
with the most cordial
professions of regard.—The earl
<PB N="181" REF="184"/>
of <HI>Sussex</HI> promised to write to
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> at <HI>Bourbon,</HI> and in∣form
him of every thing that
concerned the interest of his love.
—Forget not to inform me like∣wise
of the health of the fair
marchioness of <HI>Northampton;</HI>—
These sentiments with which she
has inspired you, and the parti∣cular
obligations she has con∣fered
on me, will not allow me
to remember her with indiffer∣ence.—And
if any incident
has power to soften the rigour of
my fate▪ it will be to see my
friend united with that lovely
woman! This drew a thousand
affectionate expressions of a friend∣ship
hardly to be parrallelled. Nor
was <HI>Leander</HI> much less concern∣ed,
at parting with the earl of
<HI>Sussex,</HI> whom he highly esteem∣ed:—You
rob us sir, of one
of our brightest ornaments, said
<PB N="182" REF="185"/>
the earl, politely, yet deprive us
of every pretence for regret!—
For who that is acquainted with
your merit can, without injus∣tice.
envy your happiness!—
<HI>Leander</HI> replied in terms expres∣sive
of gratitude, and they sepa∣rated
mutually pleased with each
other.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Moulins,</HI> which is but
four leagues from <HI>Bourbon,</HI> ano∣ther
tender separation ensued.—
The unrestrained chearfulness of
the young couple was incapable
of exciting any lively emotions
in the heart of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>—in∣volved
in melancholy; he ans∣wered
all their good-natured re∣proaches
with an air of confirm∣ed
sadness.—Be contented, said
he, that I hear all your pleasan∣tries
without disgust.—In the
present state of my mind, it is
<PB N="183" REF="186"/>
the most infallible mark of
friendship I can give. Alas!
can you doubt that the sight of
your mutual felicity recalls to
my remembrance the insupera∣ble
bars to mine: your engage∣ments
have never been interrupt∣ed!
Hymen has crowned your
loves, without suffering you to
experience the fears,—the hopes,
—the jealous suspicions,—the
anxious disappointments I en∣dure!
Nor can I flatter myself
they will ever be terminated but
by death.</P>
<P>THESE reflexion threw him
into a reverie in which he re∣mained
absorbed the rest of the
journey.—The moment of
parting was uncommonly mourn∣ful
and affecting. <HI>Lucilla</HI> could
not expect to see this brother, so
infinitely dear to her, for years
<PB N="184" REF="187"/>
for years to come;—and
<HI>Leander</HI> loved <HI>Lucilla</HI> only
better than he did <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI>
His unhappy friend was sensible
to all social affections, nor did
the excess of his passion for <HI>Julia</HI>
weaken his gratitude, or the
goodness of his heart. He en∣treated
them to be assiduous in
enquiring for the earl of <HI>War∣wick,</HI>—and
in giving him the
earliest information;—requesting
them if they did, to send an ex∣press
to <HI>Venice,</HI> to acquaint him
with his daughter's fate▪—<HI>Le∣ander</HI>
had wrote from <HI>Calais,</HI> but
no answer arrived;—so that the
anxiety of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was ex∣treme.
<HI>Leander</HI> and <HI>Lucilla</HI> pas∣sed
through <HI>Lyons,</HI> in their way
to <HI>Florence,</HI> whilst <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
pursued the road to <HI>Bourbon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="188"/>
THE situation of that town is
disagreeable;—the houses ill
built;—the salubrity of its
springs are its only recommen∣dation,
and the certainty of
meeting with polite company.—
This indeed was no inducement
to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who preferred so∣litude,
where he could indulge
his sorrowful meditations, to the
presence of those whom com∣plaisance
would oblige him to
converse with.—He therefore
avoided contracting any acquain∣tance,
and as walking was part
of the regimen prescribed, sought
the most unfrequented shades,
ruminating with an air of settled
melancholy that deterred every
one from accosting him in a
place where custom admits the
most familiar advances without
the imputation of impertinence,
and where the greatest joy is the
<PB N="186" REF="189"/>
acquisition of some new acquain∣tance,
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> sauntered
forth one morning, and taking
the first untrodden path he met
with, found himself insensibly
in the midst of a wood, which
presented to his view a vast vari∣ety
of rural beauties. He stop∣ped
upon a hanging hill, shaded
by the branches of spreading
beech trees, which sheltered it
from the rays of the sun:—he
leaned pensively some time, and
then engraved these words on the
bark of the tree which had sup∣ported
him:</P>
<P>“How would this delightful
intermixture of wood and mea∣dows,
this winding brook sport∣ing
through yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lovely vale,
spotted with cottages; how
would these smiling scenes of
nature charm away the sense
<PB N="187" REF="190"/>
of pain, could I behold their
beauties without thinking of
those of <HI>Climene!</HI> but, alas!
she is absent, and that reflec∣tion
saddens all the prospect,
and sharpens the pangs of af∣fliction.”</P>
<P>LOST in that reflection; he did
not immediately perceive a fold∣ed
paper at his feet, nor when
he did, was his curiosity excited
to take it up; but as the wind
was rather rough, a sentiment of
benevolence for the person who
had dropped the letter, tempted
him to prevent its falling into o∣ther
hands: stooping from that
motive, he found it only an en∣closure
to a chagrine case, which,
on opening, presented a minia∣ture
painting.—But what was
his surprize,—his rapture! when
he saw it resembled the features
<PB N="188" REF="191"/>
of his dear <HI>Julia!</HI> though on a
more attentive examination, he
knew it to be the portrait of her
mother, the countess of <HI>Warwick,</HI>
which he recollected to have seen
in her hand. Attaching his eyes
to an object that awakened a
thousand sadly tender remem∣rances;
he fell into deep con∣templation
on the strange chance
that had thrown it in his way.—
I am certain, it was my <HI>Julia's,</HI>
he exclaimed; she prized it too
high to part with it;—some one
must have robbed her! when in
her possession, it was set with di∣amonds.—I
find it in an ordinary
case!—But has the theft been
committed in <HI>England</HI> or in
<HI>France?</HI> Probability seems to
answer the latter.</P>
<P>IN this confusion of ideas, he
observed a man of decent ap∣pearance
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
advancing towards him,
who no sooner perceived the pic∣ture,
than accosting him with
respect, sir, said he, I have been
in great distress at losing the pic∣ture
you have in your hand,—
and shall ever acknowledge my
obligation to you for restoring it.
Before I do that said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
I must request the favour of
knowing from whom you re∣ceived
it? I am a painter, sir,
who constantly attend the seasons
at <HI>Bourbon,</HI> where from the great
resort of company that drink
the waters, I sell my performan∣ces
at a better price than any
where else. I am often employ∣ed
by the abbess of St. <HI>Menoux,</HI>
about two leagues from hence,
who is fitting up a cabinet in an
elegant style; and the other
day she sent for me to explain
her intentions, and to ask if I
<PB N="190" REF="193"/>
chose to employ my pencil there
for some time: whilst I was set∣tling
the affair, a lady entered
the cabinet, whose accent in∣formed
me she was a foreigner.
—I thought her exquisitely beau∣tiful,
though the paleness of her
complexion seemed to indicate
her being but just recovered from
some violent disorder. She asked
me if I could mend a defect in the
drapery of a miniature picture,
that had been injured by a drop
of water? Taking it out of a
diamond case, she gave it me, and
I promised to repair the damage,
in which I have succeeded, sir,
as you may perceive.—I promised
the lady to bring it to-day, but
taking a walk here in search of a
nobleman who has bought some
of my works, I accidentally
dropt it.</P>
