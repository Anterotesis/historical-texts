<HEAD>A Word against a New Election, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is the Boast of a Party among us, when they Insult their Neighbours upon the late Distractions, and when they Threaten us with Dissolution of the Parliament, the Queen's turning Out her Ministry, and the like, That the People of <HI>England</HI> are gain'd to them; that they have got the Mob on their Side, and that they have opened the Nations Eyes. It seems absolutely necessary to enquire how far this Thing is true, and to put it into other Words a little, that we may see by it the <HI>State of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>The true meaning of the Thing is thus ex∣plain'd, <HI>viz.</HI> that this is <HI>their Hour and the Power,</HI> &amp;c. That the Time is come upon us when God has peen pleased (no doubt vindictively) to give some People up to strong Delusions, that like the Men of <HI>Sodom,</HI> Blindness should over-spread <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great Part of the People. And to bring this to pass, a wicked Party of Men among us have, with too much Success, assisted the gene∣ral Defection; have first spread a Cloud over the Eyes of the People, and then dug the Pit
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
in their Way. By this Party some of the poor People have been brought to take Error for Truth, Falshood for Sincerity, Hypocrisy for Friendship, Bondage for Liberty; and in short, Darkness for Light.</P>
<P>In Religion, they have been fed with Words for Substance, Politicks for Doctrine, and Rail∣ing for Applicatiou; have been brought to for∣get Charity, Brotherly Forbearance and Mode∣ration, taking up Principles of Persecution, Fu∣ry, and Abherence of their Brethren.</P>
<P>In Government, they Embrace absolute Ty∣ranny, for Legal Monarchy, Hereditary Right, instead of Parliamentary Limitation, and Arbi∣trary Will, for Law, by which they are led Blindfold to practice Absolute Submission, with Pleasure, giving up Liberty, with Delight, like the True Tribe of <HI>Isacher,</HI> Couching▪ even be∣fore the Load is laid On. Court their own Chains, and Address their Soveraign for Slave∣ry.</P>
<P>But this has neither sunk so Deep, nor spread so Far, as some People Imagine; what they have hitherto gain'd, will not, we hope, prove so great an Advantage to them, when the People come to Discover, whether all these things Tend Indeed one would not have thought things so Absur'd as these, should gain any Ground a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all among us. One would have thought, the Ty∣ranny we so lately Groan'd under, cou'd not be so Easily forgot; that the Revolution might ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Stare in their Faces. The Gibbets, on which their Murthered Relations were put to Death are scarce taken down; the Spikes that Empail'd
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
the Sculls and Quarters of the Nations Patriots, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Martyrs of Liberty, are yet standing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on our Gates, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Fears of Popery; the Concern for Property, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich possess the very same People, who are ow Running back to <HI>Egypt,</HI> cannot but be fresh <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Memories.</P>
<P>When Idolatry was erected in their Streets, nd the <HI>Mass</HI> stood <HI>Cheek by Joul</HI> with the <HI>Com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Prayer;</HI> when the Priests began to appear in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Habits, and the <HI>Coul</HI> walk'd Hand in Hand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith the <HI>Circingle;</HI> when the <HI>Press</HI> advocated <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the <HI>Grose,</HI> and the Papists debated their Case <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Public; when Pamphlets for Popery crowded <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Streets, and the <HI>Papist misrepresented,</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efended by Authority; when the Government <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as <HI>entirely Popish,</HI> and the Nobility began to go <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Mass, to make good an Old Maxim of State, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all'd <HI>Regis ad exemp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m</HI></P>
<P>One would think (I say) these Times could not be so soon forgot, <HI>it is only Forgetfulness,</HI> the Power of these Delusions wants nothing, but to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a little wip'd off. The Memory of the Com∣mon People wants only to be Reviv'd, they on∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y want to have the Remembrance of these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings Restor'd; to have Popery and Slavery a∣gain brought into their View, the Wooden Shoes of <HI>France,</HI> the Inquisition Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> the High Commission Court of King <HI>James,</HI> set a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle in their Sight again; if these things were done effectually, the Common People of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> would soon Return to their usual Integrity, the Scales would fall from their Eyes, and the Jacobites would have little cause to boast, that they had got the Mob on their Side.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Never let them promise themselves, that these things can consist with one another, the People of <HI>England</HI> can never be long Deluded, it cannot be imagin'd, that the same Poor People can pull down the Popish Mass-Houses to Day, and the Dissenting Meeting-Houses to Morrow; can Huzza for King <HI>William</HI> one time, and for Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> another. They want only to have Matters set in a True Light, and their Eyes will open; they want only to know what they are doing, and who manages them; did they know the Designs of this wretched Party; did they see the Pit at the End of all these Things, they would Tear those People to Pieces, that have thus impos'd upon them, and brought them thus to Act, for that Party they Abhor.</P>
<P>Did the Honest Well-meaning People, that shouted that Fire-Brand into <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> that hung out Flags for him at <HI>Bridgnorth;</HI> that trea∣ted him at <HI>Warwick,</HI> and waited on him in Form at <HI>Banbury;</HI> did they know, that at the same time, that he has taken the Oaths to Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> call'd God to Witness of his Zeal for Her Go∣vernment, and stiled himself a Champion of the Church. He has, in his more private Conversa∣tion, Drank on his Knees to the Prosperity of a <HI>Popish Pretender,</HI> Acknowledged him for his So∣veraign, Cursed the Protestant Succession, as a <HI>Damn'd Legacy</HI> by King <HI>William,</HI> and wish'd that Glorious Restorer of <HI>England</HI>'s Liberties, should be Torn in Pieces by the Rabble.</P>
<P>These things, and many such are known, they can be prov'd uyon this Idol, who the People have been deluded to Worship; the Time is at
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
and, when they shall be made Publick. Can <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Man believe, if this Wolf, in Sheeps Clo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, had been stript, the Protestants of this ingdom could have Carress'd and Hugg'd him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they have done? <HI>He would stink in their Nostrils,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey would be ashamed of their Blindness, and e would not dare to pass through those Places gain, or go back the same way he came, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar of a Just Resentment from the People he had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Abused.</P>
<P>This being the True State of our Case, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople of <HI>England</HI> should be Inform'd a little, hey should see whose Drudgery they have been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oing, how they have been Impos'd upon, what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey have done, what they are still doing, and his would bring them to their Wits again.</P>
<P>This Party having, with infinite Cunning, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought the Poor People to Espouse the Absur'd Doctrine of Non-Resistance, the Genuine Intro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uction of Tyranny and Universal Bondage, it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Requisite, in order to take off that Delusion, that we should let them see a little what Slavery is. what the Effects of Tyranny are, what the Difference <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s between a Legal Limited Government, where Property is Sacred, Justice Unfettered, and the Soveraignty of the Law Acknowledged; and a <HI>French</HI> Despotick Tyranny, where Non-Resisting Principles Subject the very Souls, as well as Bo∣dies, of the People, to the Arbitrary Lust of an Absolute Tyrant.</P>
<P>It is Requisite to let the People see, That the End of all these things is to Enslave us, to bring both our Religious and Civil Liberties into the same Condition, that the Subjects of <HI>France</HI> are now brought into.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
To let them see what that Condition is, giv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them a View of <HI>French</HI> Bondage, and <HI>Popish</HI> Go∣vernment, that they may know what it is, and consider how they should like it, how well i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would suite with <HI>English</HI> Liberty, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mighty Gainers they would be by the Exchang<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>And this is the Design of the Paper.</P>
<P>To bring this down to the meanest Under∣standing, it seems necessary to enter into the short History of our present Circumstances, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> give the People of <HI>England</HI> a View of their pre∣sent State, how it came to what it is, and what it may come to, if those People prevail.</P>
<P>We need not look back beyond the <HI>Revoluti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> By it, this Nation obtain'd some few things hardly worth Naming; and as some think, les<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worth Keeping, such as,</P>

<P>These are Things we gain'd by the Revolu∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
These are the things the Enemies of the Re∣olution would take from us again: For this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, they Nourish Jacobitism among us, for this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, they rejoyce when the <HI>French</HI> prevail, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ok sad when they are beaten: For this, they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ink the Health of the Pretender, as Dr. <HI>Sache∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rell</HI> himself has openly done: For this they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urse the Memory of King <HI>William,</HI> for this Dr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cheverell</HI> publickly said at <HI>Birmingham, as has <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en proved upon Oath,</HI> that he hoped to see King <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illiam De Witted,</HI> That is, <HI>Torn in pieces, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ob.</HI> For this, the same Reverend Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peaking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King <HI>William,</HI> said he could forgive him any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing but that <HI>Damn'd Legacy, the Protestant succession,</HI> which He left us.</P>
<P><HI>For this,</HI> the same Dr. has now set the Nation in Flame; <HI>For this,</HI> they raise Tumults, make Pro∣resses, foment Rabbles, and Mob the Dissenters: <HI>For this,</HI> they change <HI>Principles,</HI> change Hands, &amp;c. nd the like: <HI>Remember Britains.</HI> 'Tis <HI>for this,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey are Treating, Caballing, and forming Parties or a New Election, that if possible, they may ring Men into Parliament, that will <HI>Give up</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Constitution, <HI>abandon</HI> Property, <HI>expose</HI> Re∣gion, and prostitute the Virgin <HI>Liberties</HI> of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, to the ravishing Lust of a Popish Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder.</P>
<P>What is at stake then in your Election of Par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment Men? Your Religion, your Liberty, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evolution, the Succession, the Toleration, the Union? <HI>Consider Britains</HI> what you are a doing: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat</HI> have these things cost the Nation, that now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey should not be thought worth keeping? <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> is there in <HI>French</HI> Bondage, that we

should be fond of restoring it? <HI>What Tempe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> have we found in Papists and High Flyers, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they have been uppermost in the Nation?</P>
<P>How come <HI>France</HI> to groan under Tyranny How come the poor Husbandmen there to hav Lean Carcasles, dejected Countenances, an Wooden Shooes? How come the Gentry to b Slaves to the Court, depend upon the War, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seek all their Grandeur, in the assisting the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King's Tyranny?

<P>All this was brought upon them, by giving up their Liberties, by neglecting their Privilege when they had them, by suffering the Encroach∣ments of their Monarchs, and permitting th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tools of Tyranny, gradually to undermine an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> supplant them; in short, by choosing bad Mem∣bers of Parliament, and letting their Representa∣tives give up their Constitution.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> had once Laws, Privileges, Parliaments, Liberties, Charters, and all the advantages of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Free Nation. Their Kings like ours, could levy no Taxes, force no unjust Burthens upon th People. The Estates of the Kingdom restrain'd the Ambition of their Princes, and prevented th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Miseries of the Subjects for many Ages.</P>
<P>When they had Liberty, they had Wealth they were Rich, Flourishing and Happy; bu when they lost their National Priveleges, they Sunk into Misery. Slavery always brings Pover∣ty,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
they go Hand in Hand together. Their Unlimited Monarchs, to support their Pride, Ambition, Avarice, and exorbitant Greatness to carry on their Unjust Wars, and to injure and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppress their weaker Neighbours, have made Havock of their own Subjects, have spent their Blood in one, and their Treasure in the other, till the poor People are reduced to the utmost Misery and distress. Their Goods, their per∣sons, their Families, their Blood, their Souls, are at the Absolute disposal of the Tyrant that Rules them: They must Worship God, but as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le would have them, wear no Cloaths but what He permits them, Eat no Bread but what He leaves them: Nothing in <HI>France</HI> can be call'd the r own, all is the Kings, and all are Subjects to His Absolute Will.</P>
<P><HI>Remember English Men!</HI> Compare this with your own Case, where every Man's House is his Castle, His Goods are His property, His Estate is his own, the QUEEN cannot command a Shilling, but by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw; not a Farthing raised but by Parliament, paid but by Legal Collection, nor employed when paid, but lyable to an Ac∣count to the Parliament.</P>
<P>Your Lives, your Religion, your Estates, your Liberties, are all secured by Law, and what you have, may truly be call'd your own.</P>
<P>What is the difference between You and the Poor <HI>French,</HI> You are Rich, they are Poor; You are <HI>Well Fed,</HI> they Starve; You have warm Houses, warm Clothes; they <HI>Perish</HI> with Cold, wear the worst of Clothes, Wooden Shooes, and Iron Chains; in short, you are <HI>alive,</HI> and they are <HI>dead.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<HI>Consider English Men:</HI> Learn once but to neg∣lect your Liberties, give up your Rights, and choose Representatives that will do the same. And <HI>France</HI> may say to You, as the Dead Man's Motto says to the Living.</P>
<Q><L>As Tou are, so was I;</L>
<L>As I am, so will You be.</L></Q>
<P>Now is the Time for you to look about you: Had your Fathers given up their Liberties, You had been Slaves, Beggars and <HI>Papists,</HI> as th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>French</HI> now are; and if you give them up, your Children will be so.</P>
<P>Nothing but Liberty preserves Religion here: Had not your Laws and Liberties been Rescued from Tyranny, in the Revolution, your Religion had not been rescued from Popery and Super∣stition; and when ever you give up your Liber∣ty to the Will of the Prince, you give up your Religion with it of Course.</P>
<P>Nothing can secure Your Liberties or Religion, but your choosing Members of Parliament, who will def<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Revolution, preserve the Tolera∣tion, and secure the Protestant Succession.</P>
<P><HI>Consider</HI> then, whether your Liberty, your Religion, your Constitution, your Posterity, do not all call upon you to choose such Men as will preserve them against all manner of Invasions, that your Children may never curse you for be∣traying them to Bondage, or your God reproach and punish you with taking that invaluable Blessing from you, I mean the Protestant Reli∣gion, because you cared not to preserve or im∣prove it when you had it.</P>

<P>This acknowledges their Weakness, the low∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of their Interest, smallness of their Power, nd badness of their Cause.

<P>The Queen has now dissolved the Parliament, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd directed a new Choice: A Dissolution does <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y no means dissolve the Right of Choosing, or the Necessity of Parliaments.</P>
<P>Let us examin the Case a little, and offer som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Things to your Consideration. Some are alarm'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Dissolution; some rejoyce at it.</P>
<P>No Man need trouble himself at the Dissolu∣ion, if the Freeholders and Electors do but pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve, not their Right of Electing, but their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enses in Election; and that is the End of this Discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Enquire then who are they that rejoyce at the Dissolution of the last Parliament; and are not all the Jacobites, Papists, and the Enemies of the Revolution, of that Number?</P>
<P>If Jacobites, if Papists, if High-Flyers rejoyce at the Dissolution of the last Parliament, it is a most necessary Hint to us, and makes it Natural to enquire what it is they can rejoyce at, but the Hopes, that by fomenting our Divisions, en∣flaming our Parties, and embroiling us one with another, they may get such Members chosen as may have less Zeal against Popery, less Steadi∣ness against the Pretender, be less careful of our Liberties, less sollicitous for the Nations Peac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦less warm in Defence of the Protestant Successi∣on, and for Preservation of the Union, than they were that went before. Let us descend to Par∣ticulars.</P>
<P><HI>The Jacobites</HI> can have no other View in it than to make easy the Restoration of the Preten∣der, whom they acknowledge for their lawful King. They could not be Jacobites, if they did not desire this; and they can have no other Reason for desiring a New Parliament, but in hopes of some lucky Chance, some happy Turn, <HI>as they call it,</HI> in favour of their Party. The last Parliament they found by Experience would not do the Work, another may; and therefore they desire a Dissolution, and rejoyce in it.</P>
<P>Papists can have no other View in it, than to make easy the Recovery of French Power, in which alone Popery can have any prospect of returning upon us in this Nation: A vigorous pursuit of the War, to the entire Reduction of
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<HI>France,</HI> must be fatal to the Popish Interest in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritain,</HI> whose only hope rests upon Assistance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the <HI>French,</HI> either by restoring the Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder, a Popish Tool bred up in Superstition, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by any other Method; of which the exorbi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Greatness of <HI>France</HI> would never want <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eans.</P>
<P>If any honest Men may be satisfied with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issolution of the last Parliament, in hopes that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may cool and allay the Heats and Divisions which are come to such a satal hight among us, hat might endanger the Publick Peace, and that hey thought the Change of the Parliament the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est, if not the only way, to prevent those Mis∣hiefs.</P>
<P>Such will above all Things desire that we hould choose Men of peaceable Principles, Men <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Temper and Moderation to succeed; other∣wise the End will not be answer'd; and the Sa∣isfaction such have reaped from the Dissolution will be entirely disappointed.</P>

It would be an Affront to Her Majesty, to hink, that it could please Her, to choose those hat declare War against the Justice, either of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Title or Administration. The High Flyers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Nation, are equally Enemies of the Go∣ernment, with the Jacobites. No Man can <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggest, that Her Majesty desires the People of <HI>ritain</HI> should choose such as these.</P>
<P>The Mobs that have Insulted the Peace of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Majesties Dominions, and bid defiance to er Royal Justice, have no ways been pleasing Her Majesty. Dr. <HI>Sacheverell▪</HI> in all his Va∣ties, has not had the least Countenance from e Queen, Her Majesty is too much a Lover Her Subjects Tranquility, and has too much Heart, the Quiet of Her Realm, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od Order of Her Government, to approve such Follies.

<P>It would be needless to say to the <HI>English</HI> Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> holders, that the Queen does not desire they should choose the Enemies of the Revolution to represent them in Parliament; were it not th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there's a Party of Men among us, who preten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mighty things for the Queen, and boast of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Loyalty to her Majesty; and yet Curse that Glo∣rious Transaction, in which the Liberty of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Protestant Nation, to exclude Papists from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Crown, was Asserted; and that have taken up on them to Decry that Parliamentary Right o Limitting the Succession to the Crown, by which Her Present Majesty Reigns, add without which Her Royal Title would be publickly Dispute<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Uncertain.</P>

<P>More Particularly, they would have you choose <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople that would declare the Hereditary Right f the Crown, against Parliamentary Limitati∣n; and thereby make way for the Pretender, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose Legitamacy they are now very busy in maintaining.</P>

<P>Lastly, if they cannot get such as these, then they desire you should Choose such Peo∣ple as would Divide, Embroil and Confound us, run us up to Tumults, Riots, and all manner of Confusion; Men of Violence and Fury, who neither Love Peace, nor will per∣mit others to enjoy it, hoping that out of those Confusions, some advantage may be made, for the Interest of <HI>France,</HI> and some Room found out, to squeeze in their Popish Pretender.</P>
