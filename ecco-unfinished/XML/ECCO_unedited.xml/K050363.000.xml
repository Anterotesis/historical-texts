<HEAD>THE TRYAL OF Capt. <HI>Jeane</HI> of <HI>Bristol.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following Narrative being so very remarkable, that per∣haps the like never appeared before in this, or any other Na∣tion; we therefore concluded it might be acceptable to make it publick. The Vil∣lanies of <HI>Bluet, Bunworth,</HI> and their Confederates, are all vastly outdone by the detestable, and before unpracticed Cruelties of the Person who is the Sub∣ject of these Sheets; even the Barbari∣ty of Mrs. <HI>Hayes,</HI> who murdered and mangled her Husband, is more than a thousand Times exceeded.</P>
<P>The Persons we have mentioned, had something to say, in Excuse, for even the
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Part of their Conduct: But here is to be found Wickedness for the sake of com∣mitting it; Barbarity in the most perfect Degree; a Murder perpetrated with the horridest Circumstances that could pos∣sibly attend a Murder; and all without so much as the Shadow of a Reason for it. Here is a poor Creature destroyed by most exquisite Tortures, without so much as deserving any Punishment; only by be∣ing in the Power of a Wretch devested entirely of Humanity, he falls a Sacrifice to the most unbounded Rage that Man could practice, or Hell could infuse.</P>
<P>This Action will become the Astonish∣ment and Abhorrence of future Genera∣tions, as much as 'tis of the present. 'Twas not to be imagined that a Child, so young as the unhappy Sufferer, could be capable of raising so strong a Resent∣ment in the Mind of a Man, till this undeniable Instance appeared to the con∣trary. The Nature of the whole Trans∣action is in itself so monsterously and de∣testably cruel and wicked, that, tho' the Captain has many Friends, who, upon a less criminal Case, might have been very ser∣viceable to him, not one of them would so much as attempt to beg Mercy for him, or ask even for a Reprieve.</P>
<P>That which added, if any Thing could do so, to the Abhorrence People had en∣tertained
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
of the Man and his Conduct, was a most remarkable Answer he gave, when being ask'd, at his Tryal, what could induce him to so much Cruelty; <HI>he said,</HI> 'Twas what he took Pleasure in; Words, 'tis believed, never spoke before in a Court of Judicature!</P>
<P>The miserable Object that suffered, was unfortunately taken on board as his Ca∣bin-Boy at <HI>Bristol,</HI> where his unhappy Relations now live. They had educated him suitable to the Design of putting him to Sea, which they always intended, and he ever seemed to have an Inclination for; and he could read and write as well as was expected of him. He was about eighteen Years old. All the Time he had been on board his Behaviour was dutiful to the Captain. He was diligent and ob∣servant; and, to all Appearance, the Cap∣tain was very well satisfied with him; so that it was more surprizing how he could, all of a sudden, become exaspe∣rated against him, and entertain that in∣veterate Malice, which nothing could sa∣tisfy but his Blood; and that too, drawn in a more dreadful Way than any Crea∣ture in human Shape ever experienced be∣fore.</P>
<P>But, in order to be regular, we must here give some short Account of the Tryal,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
and then proceed to the Character and Conduct of the Captain.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the Twenty-fifth of <HI>April</HI> 1726. was held a Session of Admiralty at <HI>Justice-Hall,</HI> in the <HI>Old Bailey,</HI> before Sir <HI>Henry Penrice</HI> Knt. Doctor of Laws, Lieutenant-Commissary in the High Court of Admiraly, and President of the said Court; and Mr. Baron <HI>Hale,</HI> and others, Associates in the Commission; when Cap∣tain <HI>John Jeane</HI> was tried for the Mur∣der of his Cabin-Boy in his Voyage from <HI>South Carolina</HI> to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and found Guilty: Upon which he received Sentence of Death as usual in the like Case; and pursuant thereto he was hanged at <HI>Exe∣cution-Dock</HI> on <HI>Friday</HI> the Thirteenth of <HI>May,</HI> and is now in Chains over-against the <HI>King's Powder-House</HI> at <HI>Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P>Five Men, being all he had in the Voy∣age, appeared against him at his Tryal: They were all very positive in their Evi∣dence; and it was rendered most credita∣ble and strong, by there not being the least material Variation in their Depositions; so that he was convicted upon the fullest and clearest Proof that could possibly▪ be re∣quired. They all swore to the Effect fol∣lowing;</P>
<P>That the barbarous Villain, <HI>for no bet∣ter be ought to be call'd,</HI> had whipped this
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
poor Boy several Times in a very cruel Manner; and after whipping, pickled him in Brine; that for nine Days and Nights he tied him to the main Mast, his Arms and Legs being all the Time extended at full Length; that not content with this, he had him unty'd, and laid along upon the Gangway, where he trod upon him, and would have had the Men done the same, which they refus'd; by which being exasperated as thinking, which indeed he might very well do, that they pitied him, he kick'd him about as he lay, unable to get up, and stamp'd upon his Breast so vio∣lently, that his Excrement came involun∣tarily from him; which he took up, and with his own Hands forc'd it several Times down his Throat; that the poor miserable Creature was eighteen Days a dying, being cruelly allowed Food enough to sustain Life, and keep him in Torture all that Time; that he was severely whipp'd every Day, and particularly the Day he died; that when he was in the Agonies of Death, and speechless, his inexorable Master gave him eighteen Lashes; that when he was just expiring, he put his Finger to his Mouth, which was took for a Signal of desiring something to drink, when the Brute, to continue his Inhuma∣nity to the last, went into the Cabbin for a Glass, which he pissed in, and then gave
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
it him for a Cordial; that a little, 'twas be∣lieved, went down his Throat; upon which pushing the Glass from him, he that In∣stant breathed his last; and God in Mercy put an End to his Sufferings, which seem∣ed to cause an Uneasiness to the Captain for not continuing longer.</P>
<P>They further depos'd, that when the Body was sown up in a Hammock to be thrown overboard, it was of as many Co∣lours as the Rainbow; that his Flesh was in many Places like Jelly, and his Head swollen as big as two Men's Heads of the largest Size.</P>
<P>As the Evidence met with full Credit, so the Relation of it was most shocking to all that heard it; as it must undoubted∣ly be to every one into whose Hands this Book falls, that has any Remains of Hu∣manity or Compassion.</P>
<P>The Captain made no manner of De∣fence, worth being term'd such; the Matter was too black and too plain: He only pretended in general to deny the Facts; but as he could get nobody, so much as to support his Character, or from any one Person or Circumstance invalidate the least Part of the Evidence; tho' there was a small Appearance for him, the Court paid no more Regard to what he said, than ought to be paid to it. At the pronouncing Sen∣tence, Sir <HI>Henry Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rice</HI> said, that he had never heard of so horrid a Barbarity, and
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
hoped such another would never come be∣fore him.</P>
<P>Thus you have a full Relation of a Piece of Villany that never was exceeded, and perhaps may never be equall'd: That which enhaunces the Cruelty of the whole, is, That as this Scene of Barbarity was gradual, so the most severe Parts of it were executed, when the miserable Suffe∣rer was least capable to bear them.</P>
<P>All, that at the Tryal could be pretend∣ed for this Usage, besides what we have already mentioned, amounted to no more than a sorry Suspicion of the Boy's having taken a little Rum and Sugar belonging to the Captain; which altogether did not come to a Shilling; a Charge so trivial, that future Ages will from it have Cause to doubt of the Truth of the whole Relation.</P>
<P>Just now, some that would appear on the Behalf of the Captain, tho' they did not think it adviseable to do so at his Try∣al, have cook'd up a Story, that for many Days after his Conviction was never heard of; and, indeed, seems only to be the Effect of a sudden Imagination: They make round Work with the Witnesses, and their Testimony, and tell us that all they said and swore to was utterly false and ground∣less; that they had taken a Pique at the Captain, <HI>who, by the way they acknow∣ledge to be a severe Man to his People</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<HI>when on board;</HI> and they were resolved, say they, to swear this Matter, which was all exactly concerted and contrived among themselves to take his Life away, for his▪ not having treated them as they thought they deserved; and as they were thus exasperated against him, his Blood they were determined to have at all E∣vents, and they have had it accordingly.</P>
<P>Having thus fairly stated what they af∣firm, we would leave it to the Decision of the impartial Reader, whether what these People say, is to be believed, before what the others swore; and whether it is probable, or no, that five Men should so exactly agree in so many minute Cir∣cumstances, though examin'd apart, un∣less they were real, and could refresh the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Memories by a Recollection of the Truth; and whether 'tis likely these Men could keep their Resentment for the little petty Affronts they pretend, so warm, and so long, as to bring themselves so many Months after these Facts were done, to commit most wilful Perjury, to the de∣stroying an innocent Man's Life, to the utter blasting their own Reputations, and perhaps to the eternal Perdition of their own Souls, and all merely to revenge a trivial Injury; and lastly, whether it does not strongly corroborate all these Witnes∣ses assert, to find, which the Captain him∣self
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
had not the Assurance to deny, that the poor Boy died under the inhuman Disci∣pline of his Master: But as it is hardly possible this improbable Story they spread in Aleviation of the Captain's Crimes, should meet with any Regard from unpre∣judic'd Persons, we shall spend no more Time to invalidate it▪ but pass immediately to Particulars more material.</P>
<P>This Man, if we may call him a Man, who seem'd to be destitute of every good Quality belonging to human Nature, was born at <HI>Bristol,</HI> of honest Parents, and at that Time not wealthy; but in a Capacity to live very comfortably: His Father has since got a very considerable Competency, and has left off his Business, which was a sea-faring one, and lives upon his Estate, which they say, is two hundred a Year: They gave their Son a handsome Educa∣tion, and thereby fitted him for that Busi∣ness in Life, he has since been very prospe∣rous in. For many Years he used the Sea, being partly brought up under his Fa∣ther, and partly to the Trade of a Cooper, which he work'd at when he first went to Sea. He was sometime Commander of a Merchant Ship belonging to <HI>Bristol</HI> He was upwards of twenty nine Years of Age; and has for a considerable while been rec∣koned by those, who had the best Reason to know his Circumstances to be worth more
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
than six thousand Pounds, and all his Debts paid; but what Account may now be given of this last Particular by his Friends, is not very difficult to determine</P>
<P>He was of a morose reserv'd Temper, and always esteemed an ill-natur'd pas∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate Man. This Disposition shew'd it∣self much since his Confinement, and e∣specially since his Condemnation. Being able to pay for it, he was allow'd the Pri∣vilege of the <HI>Press-Yard</HI> in <HI>Newgate,</HI> while under Sentence; and as he was re∣solv'd to keep himself private, few or none were admitted to converse with him, with∣out having first ask'd his Leave to do it; and it was but to v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry few, even of these, that he would say any Thing relating to the Affair he suffer'd Death for, or admit them to talk to him about it.</P>
<P>He seem'd to have no Notion of entring into any Converse with the Ordinary of <HI>Newgate,</HI> or any other Minister, that might lead him to conf ss the Murther, and acknowledge his Guilt; but in a Method something different from what has lately ap∣peared to be the Practice of Persons in his Circumstances, he endeavour'd to prepare for Death, as not having, as he said, the least Reason to expect a Delive∣rance from it; and this Preparation con∣sisted much in Generals. He said he had been a great Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and most heartily asked God's Pardon; that he was sincerely
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
sorry for the Offences of his Life, and hoped for the sake of Christ he should be received to Mercy, and saved. He shew'd indeed a settled constant Concern for seve∣ral Days before his Execution; but the most that could be got from him, during that outward Sign of Penitence, was, That <HI>if</HI> his Management of his Cabbin-Boy was a Sin, he begg'd and hop'd God would forgive him that, among the rest.</P>
<P>He seemed very uneasy at the Thoughts of being to be hung in Chains, and often exclaim'd against it in very pathetick Terms: One Day particularly he said, he look'd upon it to be very hard Treat∣ment, such as he had not deserv'd, and that it was not using him like a Gentle∣man: But in this most People differed very widely from him, looking upon no Pu∣nishment our Laws allow, adequate to his Crimes; and that Nothing co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d have been more suitable to his De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, than to have been put to Death by the like Torture and Distress he inflicted on his murder'd Ser∣vant.</P>
<P>Had he seen any Body coming to his Apartment, and did not like their Ap∣pearance, he would shut his Chamber Door against them, and not allow them to come in, tho' he had before given Leave for their Admittance.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
All the Persuasions that could be us'd, were insufficient to prevail with him to quit the Company of a Gentlewoman, who continued with him all the Time he lay in <HI>Newgate,</HI> as she had done it seems for several Months before he came there. This Gentlewoman went by the Name of <HI>Parker;</HI> but was not at this Time own'd for his Wife.</P>
<P>But no Considerations would avail: His Affection for her, was not to be alienated; and he continued to alleviate the Uneasi∣ness of his Thoughts by diverting himself with this Woman, even to the very Night before he was to die. He look'd upon himself as under great Obligations to her for the Attempt to serve him at his Tryal; and tho' she could say but very little, yet what she did say, was more on his Behalf than what was produc'd by any other Per∣son; tho', 'tis thought, if the Court had been at all acquainted with the Character of the Woman, and especially the Intimacy there was between them, her Evidence had gone for much less than it did.</P>
<P>'Twas to this Person the keeping him∣self so reserv'd, was chiefly owing; and 'tis believ'd she prevented his making Confession, she being always in the Room with him; and not caring People should see her there, she oblig'd him to shut the
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Door, as is mention'd before, against those that came to visit him; and oftentimes she did it herself; which he submitted to, not allowing any to come near him, but whom she approv'd of.</P>
<P>The Reverend Ordinary endeavour'd to the utmost to bring him to a right Sense of Things, and a Temper suitable to his Condition; but it signify'd very lit∣tle: He treated him with good Manners, would hear all he said very patiently, with∣out offering any Interruption, but would give him no manner of Answer. He seem'd to be of a settled Disposition, as if he had done but little amiss; there did not to the last appear any great Alteration in him, nothing like what 'twas reasonable to expect in a Man who was assured, as he himself said, in so short a Time to end his Life, by a violent ignominious Death: The most he could get him to come into, was to allow of Prayers, which he constantly read to him in his Chamber twice every Day; at these he behaved with the Decency that is usual to a Man of Sense in Times of De∣votion, but not at all more affected than ordinarily: He desir'd to be prayed for as a Sinner, but would as yet make no particu∣lar Confession of any one Crime; and when press'd with that for which he was to suffer, he never made any other Reply,
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
but that, If that was his worst Fault, 'twould be well for him.</P>
<P>Mr. Ordinary told him he could not encourage him to expect or hope that God would pardon his past Miscarriages, while he lived in the wilful Practice of Sin; and thereupon renew'd his Intrea∣ties to him, that if he had any Value for his immortal Soul, not to allow the Gentle∣woman, we have mentioned, to come any longer to his Bed: But this signify'd no more than his former Soli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations had done; all he got in return, was to desire him to leave that Part of his Conduct to himself, and to go on to read Prayers with him as usual; which being the most he could bring him to, he was oblig'd to acquiess.</P>
<P>Certainly no Man of his Sense and Ca∣pacity, that pretended to believe and pro∣fess the Christian Religion, ever made so unaccountable a Preparation for so fa∣tal a Catastrophe▪ if he made any at all, as this unhappy Man: His whole Con∣duct spoke it, and therefore we may re∣peat it; he seemed to be desirous indeed that God would pardon and save him; but that if he would not do so upon his own Terms, he would run the Risque of Salvation and Happiness, and take his Lot in the future State, as it might hap∣pen.
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Thus no Essays could move him to give up so much as one Iudulgence; and if nothing would do without owning the the Guilt of particular Facts, and aban∣doning the Object of his Affection, he was resolved to hazard all, rather than com∣ply; so that in a Word, he went out of the World insensible, to all Appearance, of his Crime; and from what was then thought wanton and unlawful Embraces, ventur'd upon Eternity; and how it would fare with him there, he seemed as uncer∣tain, as much at a Loss, and indeed, as regardless, as ever Man could be, who had at the same Time the full Use of his Understanding.</P>
<P>We are told, indeed, that notwithstand∣ing all his Pretences to the contrary, and the many repea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed publick Assevera∣tions he made, that he expected no Mercy, yet, to the last, he secretly cherished the Hopes of having his Life spared; for which 'tis said, he was willing to have parted with all he had in the World: But the Fact was of so shocking a Nature, that nothing but his suffering Death could possibly be the Issue of it, when∣ever he fell into the Hands of Justice.</P>
<P>The only Incident which seem'd to give him any Shock, was the Appearance of the Smith, who came to view his Body on the <HI>Saturday</HI> before he died, in order to
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
make the Iron Work for his hanging in Chains: This alter'd the Appearance of his Countenance, and made him much uneasy all the Time the Smith stay'd; which, tho' it was but a little while, might yet have been less, and not taken Notice of neither, had his Female Companion been less officious in the Matter; for she stood up before the Captain, who set upon a low Chair, and throwing open the two Sides of her Night Gown, endeavour'd to prevent the Smith's seeing him, tho', at the same Time, telling him upon what Account he came. At last she was forced to submit; so that had it not been for her, the Captain had known nothing of the Design of such a Visit, nor could he have suspected it to have been any other than the Effect of the Man's Curiosity.</P>
<P>He was taken very ill two Days before his Execution, and not without strong Sus∣picion of his having enter'd upon a Me∣thod to prevent his being made a publick Specta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le of; but if that was fact, either his Friends, or his Heart fail'd him, for the Preparation only served to make his Exit more miserable, he being so very sick and weak, that they were obliged to bring him upon Men's Shoulders from the Cart to the Scaffold; and when there, he was unable even to set upright, and lay all along upon his Back with his Face co∣vered
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
with his Hat during the whole Time the Minister was performing his Of∣fices. He was attended by two Ministers, but one only assisted him in his last Mo∣ments.</P>
<P>The Crowd to see him die, was very nu∣merous, tho' something less for Fear of the Press-Gangs, who were very diligent, and made the best Use of that Opportu∣nity. An universal Satisfaction seemed to appear in the Countenance of the Behol∣ders; and the Sense they had of the Bar∣barity of his Crime, occasioned his dy∣ing as unpitied, tho' he was in great Dis∣tress by his Illness, as perhaps ever Man did, <HI>Jonathan Wilde</HI> himself not except∣ed. Mrs. <HI>Pye,</HI> the Mother of the poor murther'd Youth, was a Witness to his Execution; she was treated with Regard by all who set round her, and every one, when told who she was, express'd their Concern for her.</P>
<P>The near Approach of Death made some Alteration in his Temper, tho' nothing yet equal to what was expected: He with his Dying, and almost last Breath, solemn∣ly declar'd, as he was to answer it at the Bar of the Almighty God, before whom he said he was sensible he was in a few Moments to appear, that Mrs. <HI>Parker,</HI> the Gentlewoman who was Witness for him at his Tryal, and with whom he had
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
convers'd during his Confinement, was his lawful wedded Wife. A few Minutes before he was turn'd off, he delivered a Paper to Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> the High Consta∣ble, who after reading it to the Populace, gave it to Mr. <HI>Applebee</HI> the Printer; the Substance of which is inserted in this Re∣lation, as it is also in Mr. <HI>Applebee</HI>'s week∣ly Journal of Saturday last, being the fourteenth Instant.</P>
<P>But before we enter upon that Account, allow us to give the Town some other Particulars, which it may not be disagree∣able to make publick.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Bristol</HI> has shewn a very laudable Zeal in prosecuting this Criminal, being convinc'd he was one of the vilest of Offenders: They have spared no Cost to bring him to Justice; and in the Course of the Proceedings, it has stood them in two hundred Pounds at least.</P>
<P>Tho' this Expence was considerable, yet it was far short of what it cost the Captain, in his fruitless Attempts to pro∣cure his Pardon; we being assur'd, if we may take his own Word for it, that he laid out above a thousand Pounds in one Week, since his receiving Sentence, to prevent the putting of it in Execution.</P>
<P>These Applications prov'd all ineffectu∣al, as the Event has plainly shewn: Those who were employed to make them,
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
sunk the Money, knowing it would have been looked upon as an Insolence, to have recommended an Affair of so black a Nature to any Person of Distinction, or that had any Value for a Character in Life.</P>
<P>After this Disappointment, they tried at a Favour of a much lower sort; and since they found he must go to be execu∣ted, they desired it might not be in the ordinary Way, but that instead of a Cart he might have a Coach; and even for this, so flush was their Money, that they would not have scrupled an hundred Guineas to have procur'd it: But they were let to un∣derstand, that even this Request would not be granted him, tho' they would give ten Times that Sum. And we hear a Coach will not be allow'd to any Malefactor for the future, unless upon a most extraordi∣nary Occasion indeed; for a Coach pre∣vents the Criminal from being expos'd to publick View, so much as he deserves; and therefore those who come under that Denomination, will not be so far indulg'd in Time to come.</P>
<P>He lived in a very elegant Manner in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and seem'd to deny himself no Satisfaction that could be receiv'd from eating and drinking: His Habit there was equal to what any Gentleman is usually seen in abroad, and might rather be cal∣led
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
fine, than otherwise: This was entirely laid aside on the Day of Execution; so that his dirty Linnen and mean Apparel seem'd to be an Indication of his Wretchedness; and from an ill Cast with his Eyes, pecu∣liar to himself, he altogether look'd like what the People said, tho' in harsher Terms, a Man deserving his Fate.</P>
<P>If we may take the Opinion of the Exe∣cutioner, who in these Cases is generally allow'd to be a good Judge, he to the last maintain'd a Temper very unfit for a dy∣ing Man; for, according to <HI>Jack</HI>'s Judg∣ment, he was sullen to his latest Moment, and went off in an ill Humour.</P>
<P>If we may believe the publick, this is not the first Instance he has given of the barbarous Cruelty of his Nature, he ha∣ving punish'd several with a much more than ordinary Severity; and particularly, that he once cut a Piece of Flesh out of the Inside of a Boy's Thumb, making an Orifice as low as the Bone, and two In∣ches round, which he fill'd up with Salt, to torture him for some very small Offence he was chargeable with. Many other In∣stances are spoken of; but as the World is inclinable enough to add upon these Oc∣casions▪ more than can be made appear, we have declined inserting any more; nor indeed is there any need to give Mankind more than the Treatment of his Cabbin-Boy,
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
to convince them, that he certainly was one of the most inexorable Wretch∣es that ever breathed.</P>
<P>'Twill be proper here, if we mention it at all, to record something of the Conduct of the well-known Mr. <HI>Ketch:</HI> He search∣ed the Pockets of the Deceas'd with his usual Accuracy and Care; but to his no little Concern he found somebody had been very particular in their Enquiries before him: This settled the Muscles of <HI>Jack</HI>'s Face, much more than the discharging the Duty of his Office could do; and find∣ing the Crowd began to take Notice of his looking very silly, to maintain his Ground, and support his Reputation with his old Friends, with a very good Grace, said, he was a mean spirited Rogue; and if he had thought he should have been no bet∣ter paid for it, he would not have done the Jobb for him.</P>
<P>But to enter upon the more solemn Part, which, as he grew nearer his End, was somewhat more so, and affecting, than it had been; which, as it engag'd those that were Witnesses to it, so undoubtedly it will those that read it: He appear'd in great Agonies the Day before he was to die, and those were so far from leaving him, that they gradually encreas'd till the Ago∣nies of Death put a Period to them: But neither these, nor even the View of the fa∣tal
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
Tree join'd with the utmost Endeavours of his Friends, could induce him to ac∣knowledge the Justice of his Sentence, or the Guilt of the particular Fact, for which he suffered: He insisted to the last, that he could not apprehend it criminal in him to punish the Boy; and that his dying un∣der Correction, was the Lad's Misfor∣tune, but not a Crime chargeable upon him.</P>
<P>This last Particular, with what is sub∣sequent to this, is the Substance of the Pa∣per, deliver'd to Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> the High Con∣stable, which we thought might be more agreeable to the Reader, to have it with Connexion, than if 'twas transmitted in the Method inserted in the Paper itself; which appear'd to be the Composition of a Man under much Consternation. If in relating the Account he gives of himself, any Thing comes in again that has been touch'd upon before, we desire it may be look'd upon as what we are oblig'd to, that the Con∣nexion may be preserv'd, and as a Confir∣mation of those particular Incidents: In the Paper deliver'd to the High Constable, he says, That he was 29 Years of Age, born in <HI>Bristol,</HI> of honest Parents, and People respected: He had good Educa∣tion suitable to his Birth, being taught <HI>Latin,</HI> Writing, Arithmetick, Book-keep∣ing, and such other Things as are proper

to fit a Man for Business; and was also well grounded and instructed in the Prin∣ciples of the Christian Religion. When of Age, he was put out Apprentice to a Cooper in <HI>Bristol,</HI> but went to Sea till the Year 1724: He was made Master of the <HI>Burnet</HI> from <HI>Bristol</HI> to <HI>South Caro∣lina.</HI></P>
<P>He did not come to Chapel, but kept in a Room by himself, alledging that there were divers People, who hated, and bore him ill-will; and the Chapel being always crowded with Spectators, who came to see a great Number of nota∣ble Malefactors under Sentence of Death, hedid not desire to sit by them; so likewise he endeavour'd to shun them whom he supposed to be his Enemies, and who, he thought, would insult over his most mise∣rable and calamitous Condition. The main Reason he gave for keeping himself altogether retir'd, and shunning the Sight of the People, as if he had been afraid, or asham'd of being seen by any Body, was, that he might apply himself wholly to his Devotion, and the few Moments of Life allow'd him in the Service of God; for he did not think that he could be so serious amidst so many Malefactors, and others, who, he said, hated and envied him, and would come on Purpose to laugh at his Calamity.</P>

He own'd himself to have been a great Sinner; but never to have been guilty of any Capital Crime. He said, that he had been too much liable to the Commission of those Sins, which are too commonly in use among Travellers; that sometimes he had been drunk; that he had committed Whoredom; that he had been too much guilty of Covetousness; that he had not been so careful in performance of religious Duties, as he ought to have been, but sometimes had neglected the Observation of the Lord's Day in a due Manner: In short, he confess'd that his Conversation had not been conformable to the Gospel of <HI>Christ,</HI> as it should have been, but more negligent than what was proper in his Duty, both to God and Man; but other∣ways, he said, that he never had been wicked to that Degree, as to be denomi∣nated vicious, but that his Failings were such, as are common to Mankind, and not subject to the Severity of penal Laws.</P>
<P>As to the particular Fact of murthering his Cabbin-Boy, of which he was con∣victed, and for which he was to die▪ he said, that he had not murther'd him, and never intended such a Thing; that the Deceas'd was a very naughty Boy, having frequently broken up several of his Locks, and stolen Brandy, Rum, and o∣ther Provisions from him, which (as he
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
said) the Boy confess'd in part before some other Captains of Ships, who happen'd to be in <HI>South Carolina,</HI> in Company with himself: That the said Boy was very naughty, had stolen a number of Things from him; that it was not possible to re∣strain him from thevish Practices; that some Days after he had been at Sea, bound home to <HI>Bristol,</HI> in an Evening, or Night, as he was asleep in his Bed in the Cab∣bin, the Boy came into it, and having broke open his Locks, and drank above a Pint of his Rum, upon which, he be∣came so drunk, that his Excrements went from him, and abus'd the Cabbin fill'd with Goods, raising a horrid Stench; that thereupon he awoke, and the Boy was in so dismal a Condition, that he knew not what to do: Upon which, he call'd all the Men of the Ship, excepting those who were upon the Watch on Deck, causing them to sit down, and take a Dram, and smoke Tobacco, to remove the intolerable Smell: He ask'd 'em, what such a Servant deserv'd. However, he said to them, he would not meddle with him till their Ar∣rival in <HI>England;</HI> yet, recollecting him∣self, he thought himself oblig'd as a Master, to correct a Servant for such an enormous Fault. And upon this, follow'd the severe Discipline of tying the Boy to
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
the Mast, with his Arms and Legs stretch'd out, in which Posture he conti∣nued for some Days and Nights, com∣manding not to give him any Meat, either boil'd, roasted, or fry'd: When he was at the Point of dying, and past Speech, making Signs for a Dram, his giving him his own Water in a Glass, instead of Rum, his dipping Pieces of of Bread in the Boy's Excrements, which came voluntarily from him, and putting it to the Boy's Mouth, to make him eat it, both which the Boy rejected, he could not disown, only deny'd that he sent him Piss, but the best Rum in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> for a Dram. He said, that there was no evil Design in what he did; and that if he had done as they swore, the Men who appear'd as Evidences against him, were Rogues that they did not hinder him, such Barbarity appearing more like a mad Man, than any Thing else; adding that the Boy's Mother, who was a Woman of a very ill Nature and indifferent Character, was the only Prosecutor, his Father, a Journyman Blacksmith in <HI>Bristol,</HI> having declared to him, that he would have nothing to do in the Affair; and that the Mate and Sai∣lors, who were Witnesses against him, had (upon some Disobligations and Differences) confederated to ruin him. He said, that
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
he was content to die, and had made Prepa∣rations for Death accordingly; that he ac∣knowledg'd the Justice of his Sentence, with respect to the Honourable Judges and the Jury; but that the Evidence had not done him Justice: However, he freely forgave them wherein they had injur'd him, affirming also, that he never pray∣ed to God for himself, but that he did likewise most earnestly pray for them, &amp;c. Some Days before the Execution, he fell into a very ill State of Health, so that his Senses fail'd, and frequently fell into Fits; some suspecting that he had taken Poison. This was insinuated to him: He said God forbid that such a wicked Purpose should enter into his Breast; his Wife also taking God to witness, said, that she never gave him any Thing but what was wholsome, and that she lov'd him too well to be his Executioner. He became so weak and feve∣rish, that he did not desire Exhortations, as not needing Instructions for the Direction of Life, which he look'd upon as past, but godly Prayers, or short Admonitions; withal, desiring to direct him to some pro∣per Place in the Gospel, fit to guard against Despair. Upon the Wednesday before he died, several Chapters in the Bible were read to him, at which he fainted three or four Times. This was look'd upon the
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
Effect of his Illness, rather than Contri∣tion; and after this he was so very weak, that he could not listen to any Thing read or spoke by any Body, but desir'd devout Prayers to God for his Soul. He very of∣ten declar'd, that had he been to live any longer in this World, he had by God's Grace attain'd to such a perfect Resigna∣tion and Contempt of all earthly E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joy∣ments, that he should esteem the World, and all the Pleasures thereof, no more than the Dirt of the Streets. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Bedford</HI> (upon his Desire) frequently visited him, and gave him the Sacrament; the Captain express'd himself very grate∣ful for his Kindness. He died in the Faith of Christ, owning himself an unworthy Member of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and declaring that he was in Peace with all Mankind. <HI>Thus far his own Account.</HI></P>
<P>He was unaccountably hurry'd in his Mind the Night before his Execution, and by sudden Starts, and unconnected Ex∣pressions, shew'd the dreadful Affright of his Soul: His Imagination, 'tis said, pre∣sented even the murther'd Boy to his View in all the Agonies of Death, and he cry'd out like a Man distracted; but much of this was attributed to his Indisposition, for, upon his growing calmer, he appear'd
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
no more concern'd for the particular Fact for which he suffer'd, than he had done be∣fore.</P>
<P>He took but little Care to requite those who had been serviceable to him since his Condemnation, and the Assurances he had given to some upon that Account, pass'd altogether uncomply'd with.</P>
<P>The parting with the Gentlewoman, who we must now call his Wife, was ve∣ry moving; that, and the taking Leave of his Friends, spent a considerable Part of the Morning till ten of the Clock, all possible Endearments pass'd between them, and it seem'd worse than Death to each of of them, that they must meet no more: Abundance of Tears were shed on all Sides, and the Uneasiness it caused to himself par∣ticularly, threw him into Convulsions. As he was to be hung in Chains, his Rela∣tions and Friends all left him at <HI>Newgate;</HI> and he came unaccompany'd to the Water-Side by all his Acquaintance, but those who were become so, by belonging to the Prison. The Mob insulted him by different Methods as he pass'd the Streets, and by saluting him often with Huzza's, testify'd the Satisfaction they had in his Sufferings.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
He express'd a great Concern for his Father, who, he fear'd, would break his Heart as soon as he had the Account of his untimely shameful End; and, for this, he seem'd to shew as much Sorrow, or ra∣ther more, than he did for his own Case: All the Calamity he said the Family ever met with, was brought down upon them by his Indiscretion, and he griev'd the more, because 'twas out of his Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to make them any Reparation.</P>
<P>He could not, at the last, be brought to speak well of Mrs. <HI>Pye,</HI> who, he said, was the Cause of all his Disasters: Her Husband, he said, was as good a Man as liv'd; and he did not doubt, but he would have made the Matter up, and have forgiven him, but that his Wife pre∣vented it; so that, as he term'd it, her Son died by Accident, but she had wilfully sought and taken his Blood; which, he thought, very hard and unjust. But here he was certainly as much mistaken, as ever he had been before; for it plainly appears, that neither Mrs. <HI>Pye,</HI> nor her Husband, would have accepted of any Considera∣tion, though it had been all the Captain could have offer'd in the World, as an Attonement for the Blood of their Son, who had been basely and most cru∣elly murder'd. They knew nothing could
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
be satisfactory to God, or Man, but the Blood of the Murtherer; therefore they would not sell the Blood of their inno∣cent Child, nor have the Guilt of shed∣ding it lie at their Door; and this is what they have most solemnly declared on all Occasions.</P>
<P>But to view the Captain in his last Appearance, preparing for his fatal <HI>Exit:</HI> They favour'd his Indisposition as much as possible, and the Cart mov'd but slow∣ly thro' the Streets: However, being all upon the Stones, it shook him so much, that 'twas fear'd the People and Exe∣cutioner would have been disappointed▪ Arriving at the Place, he reviv'd a little, and having set still in the Cart sometime, they convey'd him, as has been mention'd, from that to the Scaffold. At first, he set, and two Men supported him; when cast∣ing his Eyes around, tho' without look∣ing directly in any Man's Face, which 'twas taken Notice of he carefully a∣voided, he found an Appearance that was far from being agreeable to him; the People express'd nothing of a friendly Concern for him, and he was soon very sensible of it: Upon this, he threw him∣self upon his Back, and never look'd upon the Company more. He ask'd for a little Water, which, by his Direction, had
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
been provided for him by one of the Offi∣cers in a Viol; of this, he took a small Sup, and then applied himself to his De∣votions; which, 'twas observ'd by the Company, Sailors dispatch much sooner than any other People. And, indeed, it was so here, the Whole being over in a little more than a quarter of an Hour; and yet he had as much Time allow'd him, as to perform all the appointed Service, and as much as he seem'd to desire for his more private Prayers and Ejaculations, which were still much shorter than the other. He repeated every Word after the Minister, and seemingly with abun∣dance of Earnestness, saying all the Time upon his Back, as has been observ'd, and his Face cover'd with his Hat. And now the Ministers taking their leave of him, and the People having Notice to get off the Scaffold, gave him a great Alarm, as it well might: His Agonies now began indeed; he lifted up his Hands and Eyes in a most moving Manner, and cry'd to God for Mercy, with the utmost Ve∣hem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncy imaginable: He was all Agony, and his Convulsions were now much grea∣ter than ever they had been. But even all this brought him to no particular Con∣fession of the Fact he died for; his In∣difference and Easiness of Temper, was
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
now at an End, and he was all Conster∣nation and Amazement: He cry'd out once or twice, God's Will be done! God's Will be done! but sure no Man could enter in∣to another World with more Fear and Dread upon him, of what might be the Consequence of such a Transition, than this unhappy Wretch. He continued some few Minutes after this, wringing his Hands, as much as the Cords would give him Leave, and calling upon God for Christ's Sake to have Mercy upon him, and receive his departing Soul, when, at the appointed Signal, the Scaffold was struck, and put an End to his Petitions, and all his Preparations for Death.</P>
<P>He was left to die, as might happen, without that Assistance, from either the People or the Executioner, which is usual; none gave him one friendly Blow to help him out of his Pain, or even so much as pull'd him by his Legs, to hasten his End. Notwithstanding he was so very ill, yet he died hard, being a long while before he expir'd; and 'twas observ'd that several Parts of him were convulsed▪ and he was not quite motionless 'till about eighteen Minutes after he was hung up. This might have mov'd the Compassion of the Popu∣lace upon other Occasions; but now it on∣ly serv'd to put them upon recollecting
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
the disproportion between the Time he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the eighteen Days, in which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had kept the poor Creature in Torment for whom he suffer'd; so that they rather took a Pleasure than otherwise, in think∣ing his Pain was greater than what'scom∣mon.</P>
<P>The Smith was ready with the Irons, and accordingly affixed them to his Body before they cut him down; during which Time, the Mob, according to Custom, stripp'd his Coat of its Buttons, as far as they could reach, to preserve as a Memo∣rial of him. After which, he was con∣veyed down the River, and in the Af∣ternoon, was hung in Chains, at the Place we have already mention'd, pursuant to his Sentence. Great Interest was made, and much Intercession used to prevent this also; but they proved no more effectual than the former Applications had done. He was a Man that had render'd himself undeserving of any Favour; and though he might receive Mercy from God, he had no Reason to expect it from Man: His Hands had been dipp'd in innocent Blood, and to the most horrid detestable Degree, a single Murder could possibly produce; so that it must have left an in∣delible Stain upon the Nation, not to have made an Example of this O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fender, in as
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
severe and publick a Manner, as our Laws would allow of; which, to the Ho∣nour of those in Power, has been done accordingly; and he deservedly remains a Monument of Justice unpity'd, as being one of the worst of Criminals that ever was so exposed.</P>
