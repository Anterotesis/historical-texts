<HEAD>To the Right Honourable CHARLES Lord <HI>HALLIFAX</HI>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I could have the Vanity to make a Merit of Dedicating this Tragedy to Your Lordship, I should here take an Opportunity of telling Your Lordship, that I am, in This, endeavouring to make the best, and only Return I am capable of, for all those Marks of exceeding Goodness and Humanity, which I have
<PB REF="4"/>
still had the Honour to meet with from Your Lord∣ship. But since the Matter is quite otherwise, since it is highly to my Advantage to Shelter my self under so great a Name; since I have done my self so much Ho∣nour by it; I am bound to own, with all the Gratitude I am capable of, that Your Lordship's Patronage is a New, and will be a Lasting Obligation upon me.</P>
<P>Most kinds of Poetry, but especially Tragedies, come into the World now, like Children born under ill Stars▪ a general Indifference, or rather Disinclination, attends like a bad Influence upon 'em; and after having bustled thro' ill Usage, and a short Life, they sleep and are forgotten. The Relish of Things of this kind is certain∣ly very much alter'd from what it was some time since; and tho' I won't presume to Censure other Peoples Pleasures, and prescribe to the various Tastes of Man∣kind; yet I will take the Liberty to say, that those who scorn to be entertain'd like their Fore-fathers, will hard∣ly substitute so reasonable a Diversion in the Room of that which they have laid aside. I could wish there were not so much Reason as there is to attribute this Change of Inclinations, to a Disesteem of Learning it self. Too many People are apt to think that Books are not Necessary to the Finishing the Character of a fine Gentleman; and are therefore easily drawn to despise what they know nothing of. But, my Lord, among all these mortifying Thoughts, it is still a Pleasure to the Muses, to think there are some Men of too delicate Understandings to give in to the Tastes of a deprav'd Age; Men that have not only the Power, but the Will, to protect those Arts which they love, because they are Masters of 'em.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>It would be very easie for me to distinguish one a∣mong those few, after the most advantageous Manner; but all Men of common Sense have concurr'd in doing it already, and there is no need of a Panegyrick.</P>
<P>I could be almost tempted to Expostulate with the rest of the World, (for I am sure there is no Occasion to make an Apology to Your Lordship) in Defence of Poetry. I am far from thinking of a good Poet, as the <HI>Stoicks</HI> did of their Wise-man, that he was suffici∣ent for every thing, could be every thing, and excel in every thing, as he pleas'd; yet sure I may be allow'd to say, that, that Brightness, Quickness, that Strength and Greatness of thinking, which is requir'd in any of the nobler Kinds of Poetry, would raise a Man to an uncommon Distinction in any Profession or Business, that has a Relation to good Sense and Understanding. One Modern Instance can at least be given, where the same Genius that shone in Poetry, was found equal to the first Employments of the State; and where the same Man, who by his Virtue and Wisdom was highly Use∣ful to, and Instrumental in the Safety and Happiness of his Native Country, had been equally Ornamental to it in his Wit.</P>
<P>This is what I could not help saying, for the Honour of an Art which has been formerly the Favourite of the greatest Men. Not that it wants a Recommendation to Your Lordship, who have always been a Constant and Generous Protector of it. This indeed would be much more properly said to the World; and when I have told 'em what Men have equally adorn'd it, and been adorn'd
<PB REF="6"/>
by it. I might not unfitly apply to 'em, what <HI>Horace</HI> said to the <HI>Piso</HI>'s;
<Q><L>—Ne fortè Pudori</L>
<L>Sit tibi Musa Lyrae solers &amp; Cantor Apollo:</L></Q></P>
<P>For my own inconsiderable Pretensions to Verse, I shall, I confess, think better even of them, than I have ever yet done, if they shall afford me the Honour to be always thought,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>.</BYLINE>
<L>SINCE to your fam'd Fore-Fathers quite contrary,</L>
<L>You from their Pleasures, as their Wisdom, vary;</L>
<L>What Art, what Method, shall the Poet find,</L>
<L>To hit the Taste of each fantastick Mind?</L>
<L>Legions of Joys your wand'ring Fancies lead,</L>
<L>Like Summer Flies, which in the Shambles breed;</L>
<L>Each Year they swarm anew, and to the last succeed.</L>
<L>Time was, when Fools by Fellowship were known;</L>
<L>But now they stray; and in this populous Town</L>
<L>Each Coxcomb has a Folly of his own.</L>
<L>Some dress, some dance, some play; not to forget</L>
<L>Your <HI>Piquet</HI> Parties, and your dear <HI>Basset</HI>.</L>
<L>Some Praise, some Rail, some Bow, and some make Faces;</L>
<L>Your Country Squires hunt Foxes, your Court, Places.</L>
<L>The City too fills up the various Scene,</L>
<L>Where Fools lay Wagers, and where Wise Men win.</L>
<L>One rails at <HI>Caelia</HI> for a late Mischance,</L>
<L>One grumbles, and cries up the Pow'r of <HI>France</HI>.</L>
<L>This Man talks Politicks, and that takes Pills;</L>
<L>One cures his own, and one the Nation's Ills.</L>
<L>Now Fidling, and the Charms of Sing-Song, win ye;</L>
<L>Harmonious <HI>Peg</HI> and warbling <HI>Valentini</HI>.</L>
<L>As to your Drinking—but for that we spare it,</L>
<L>Nor with your other vile Delights compare it,</L>
<L>There's something more than Sound, there's Sense in Claret.</L>
<L>Mean while neglected Verse, in long Disgrace,</L>
<L>Amongst your many Pleasures finds no Place;</L>
<L>The virtuous Laws of common Sense for swearing,</L>
<L>You damn us like packt Juries, without hearing.</L>
<L>Each puny Whipster here, is Wit enough,</L>
<L>With scornful Airs, and supercilious Snuff,</L>
<L>To cry, <HI>This Tragedy's such damn'd grave Stuff</HI>.</L>
<L><PB REF="8"/>But now we hope more equal Judges come,</L>
<L>Since <HI>Flanders</HI> sends the generous Warriors home:</L>
<L>You that have fought for Liberty and Laws,</L>
<L>Whose Valour the proud <HI>Gallick</HI> Tyrant awes,</L>
<L>Join to assert the sinking Muses Cause,</L>
<L>Since the same Flame, by different Ways express'd,</L>
<L>Glows in the Heroe's and the Poet's Breast.</L>
<L>The same great Thoughts that rouse you to the Fight</L>
<L>Inspire the Muse, and bid the Poet write.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, who acted <HI>Ethelinda</HI>▪</BYLINE>
<L>THE Business of the Day being now gone thro'</L>
<L>I quit the Saint, and am like one of you;</L>
<L>As well to look to, tho' not quite so good;</L>
<L>I bate in Spirit, but keep my Flesh and Blood.</L>
<L>The Moral of this Play being rightly scann'd,</L>
<L>Is, He that leaves his nown dear Wife is damn'd.</L>
<L>I leave to you to make the Application:</L>
<L>The Doctrine, tho' a little out of Fashion,</L>
<L>May be of use in this same sinful Nation.</L>
<L>What think you of the Matter? Which of you</L>
<L>Would, for his Spouse, like my true Turtle do?</L>
<L>When Wealth and Beauty both at once importune,</L>
<L>Who would not leave his Wife, to make his Fortune?</L>
<L>To some, I know, it may appear but odly,</L>
<L>That this Place, of all others, should turn godly:</L>
<L>But what of that? Since some good Souls there are,</L>
<L>Would gladly be instructed any where;</L>
<L>Nor should you scorn the Weakness of the Teacher,</L>
<L>The Wisest Man is not the ablest Preacher.</L>
<L><PB REF="9"/>Ev'n we, poor Women, have sometimes the Pow'r,</L>
<L>Read as you are, and rich in Learning's Store,</L>
<L>To teach, you Men, what you ne'er knew before.</L>
<L>To no Enthusiastick Rage we swell,</L>
<L>Nor foam, nor act <HI>Tom Tumbler</HI> out of Zeal.</L>
<L>But tho' we don't pretend to Inspiration,</L>
<L>Yet, like the Prophets, of a Neighbour Nation,</L>
<L>Our Teaching chiefly lyes in <HI>AGITATION</HI>.</L>
<L>Perhaps, indeed, such are your wandring Brains,</L>
<L>Our Author might have spar'd his Tragick Pains:</L>
<L>By that you've supp'd, and are set into Drinking,</L>
<L>Some sweeter Matters will employ your Thinking;</L>
<L>With Nymphs Divine, writ on each Glass before ye,</L>
<L>You'll be but little better for our Story.</L>
<L>But since the parting Hour, tho' late, will come,</L>
<L>And all of you, at least as I presume,</L>
<L>May find some kind, instructive She at home,</L>
<L>Then Curtain Lectures will, I hope, be read,</L>
<L>Those Morals then, which from your Thoughts were fled,</L>
<L>Shall be put home to you, and taught a bed.</L>

<L>I rose, and would have sought the thicker Wood;</L>
<L>But while I hurry'd on my hasty Flight,</L>

<L>His Eyes and glowing Visage flashing Flame,</L>
<L>Swore 'twas impossible; he never would,</L>
<L>He could not leave me; with ten thousand Ravings,</L>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>The</HI> SCENE <HI>is a Temple adorn'd according to the Su∣perstition of the Antient</HI> Saxons; <HI>in the Middle are plac'd their three principal Idols</HI>, Thor, Woden, <HI>and</HI> Freya.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Musick is heard at a Distance, as of the Priests preparing for the Sacrifice. Then</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Ariber.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>ALL Night the bloody Priests, a dreadful Band,</L>
<L>Have watch'd intent upon their horrid Rites,</L>
<L>With many a dire and execrable Pray'r,</L>
<L>Calling the Fiends beneath, the sullen <HI>Demons</HI></L>
<L>That dwell in Darkness deep, and Foe to Man,</L>
<L>Delight in reeking Steams of human Gore.</L>
<L>Now huddled on a Heap, they murmur'd hoarse,</L>
<L>And hissing whisper'd round their mystick Charms;</L>
<L>And now, as if by sudden Madness struck,</L>
<L>With Screamings shrill they shook the vaulted Roof,</L>
<L>And vex'd the still, the silent, solemn Midnight.</L>
<L>Such sure in everlasting Flames below,</L>
<L>Such are the Groans of poor lamenting Ghosts,</L>
<L>And such the Howlings of the last Despair.</L>
<L>Anon to Sounds of Woe, and magick Strings,</L>
<L>They danc'd in wild fantastick Measures round;</L>
<L>Then all at once they bent their ghastly Visages</L>
<L>On me, and yelling, thrice they cry'd out, <HI>Aribert!</HI></L>
<L>I have endur'd their Horrors—And at length</L>
<L>See! the Night wears away, and chearful Morn,</L>
<L>All sweet and fresh, spreads from the rosie East;</L>
<L>Fair Nature seems reviv'd, and ev'n my Heart</L>
<L>Sits light and jocund at the Day's Return,</L>
<L>And fearless waits an end of all its Sufferings.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="34" REF="46"/><HI>Enter one of the Guards, he delivers a Letter to</HI> Aribert.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Guar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>From <HI>Oswald</HI> this, on Peril on my Life,</L>
<L>I have engag'd to render to your Hands.
<STAGE><HI>[Exit. Ari.</HI> reads.] Seofrid <HI>has been just to his Word; he has deli∣ver'd the fair</HI> Ethelinda <HI>to my Charge; we have happily past all the Guards, and hope in two Hours to reach the</HI> Briton<HI>'s Camp. From your faithful</HI> Oswald.</STAGE></L>
<L>Then thou hast nothing left on Earth, my Soul,</L>
<L>Worthy thy farther Care. Why do I stay,</L>
<L>Why linger then, and want my Heav'n so long?</L>
<L>To live is to continue to be wretched,</L>
<L>And robs me of a great and glorious Death.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Rodogune <HI>with an Officer, he speaks to her entring</HI>.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Offic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Thus <HI>Offa</HI> to his beauteous Sister sends:</L>
<L>Depend upon a Brother's Love and Care,</L>
<L>To further all you wish.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis well! be near,
<STAGE><HI>Exit Officer.</HI></STAGE></L>
<L>And wait my further Order. See! my Heart,</L>
<L>See there thy dearest Choice, thy fond Desire.</L>
<L>See with how clear a Brow, what chearful Grace,</L>
<L>With all his native Sweetness undistur'b,</L>
<L>The noble Youth attends his harder Fate.</L>
<L>I came to join my friendly Grief with yours,
<STAGE><HI>To</HI> Aribert.</STAGE></L>
<L>To curse your Tyrant Brother, and deplore</L>
<L>Your youthful Hopes, thus all untimely blasted:</L>
<L>But you, I see, have learn'd to scorn your Danger;</L>
<L>Your wear a Face of Triumph, not of Mourning:</L>
<L>Has Death so little in it?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! 'tis nothing,</L>
<L>To Minds that weigh it well: The Vulgar fear it,</L>
<L>And yet they know not why. Since never any</L>
<L>Did from that dark and doubful Land as yet</L>
<L>Turn back again, to tell us 'tis a Pain.</L>
<L>To me it seems like a long wish'd for Happiness,</L>
<L>Beyond what ev'n our Expectation paints;</L>
<L>'Tis Comfort to the Soul, 'tis Peace, 'tis Rest;</L>
<L>It comes like Slumber to the sick Man's Eyes.</L>
<L>Burning and restless with a Feaver's Rage,</L>
<L>All Night he tosses on his weary Bed;</L>
<L>He tells the tedious Minutes as they pass,</L>
<L>And turns, and turns, and seeks for Ease in vain;</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="47"/>But if, at Morning's Dawn, sweet Sleep fall on him,</L>
<L>Think with what Pleasure he resigns his Senses,</L>
<L>Sink to his Pillow, and forgets his Pain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Perhaps it may be such a State of Indolence;</L>
<L>But sure the active Soul should therefore fear it.</L>
<L>The Gods have dealt unjustly with their Creatures,</L>
<L>If barely they bestow a wretched Being,</L>
<L>And scatter not some Pleasures with the Pain,</L>
<L>To make it worth our Keeping. Is there nothing</L>
<L>Could make you wish to live?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! yes, there is;</L>
<L>There is a Blessing I could wish to live for,</L>
<L>To live, for Years, for Ages to enjoy it.</L>
<L>But far, alas! divided from my Arms,</L>
<L>It leaves the World a Wilderness before me,</L>
<L>With nothing worth desiring.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Dull and cold!</L>
<L>Or cold at least to me, dull, dull Indifference.
<STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE></L>
<L>What if some pitying Pow'r look down from Heav'n,</L>
<L>And kindly visit your afflicted Fortunes?</L>
<L>What if it send some unexpected Aid,</L>
<L>Some generous Heart, and some prevailing Hand,</L>
<L>Willing to save, and mighty to defend,</L>
<L>Who from the gloomy Confines of the Grave</L>
<L>Timely shall snatch, shall bring you back to Life,</L>
<L>And raise you up to Empire and to Love?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>The Wretched have few Friends, at least on Earth:</L>
<L>Then what have I to hope?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Hope every thing,</L>
<L>Hope all that Merit, such as yours, may claim,</L>
<L>Such as commands the World, exacts their Homage,</L>
<L>And makes ev'n all the Good and Brave your Friends.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>And can you then vouchsafe to flatter Misery?</L>
<L>T'enrich so fall'n, so lost a thing as I am,</L>
<L>With the sweet Breath of Praise? So pious Virgins</L>
<L>Rob the whole Spring to make their Garlands fine,</L>
<L>Then hang 'em on a senseless Marble Tomb.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>A burning Purple flushes o'er my Face,</L>
<L>And Shame forbids my Tongue, or I would say,</L>
<L>That I—Oh <HI>Aribert!</HI>—I am thy Friend.</L>
<L>Yet wherefore should I blush to own the Thought?</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="48"/>For who!—who would not be the Freind of <HI>Aribert?</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Why is this woundrous Goodness lost upon me?</L>
<L>Why is this Bounty lavish'd on a Bankrupt,</L>
<L>Who has not left another Hour of Life</L>
<L>To pay the mighty Debt?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! let me yet,</L>
<L>Yet add to it, and swell the Sum yet higher;</L>
<L>Nor doubt but Fate shall find the Means to pay it.</L>
<L>Know then that I have pass'd this live-long Night,</L>
<L>Sleepless and anxious with my Cares for thee;</L>
<L>The Gods have sure approv'd the pious Thought,</L>
<L>And crown'd it with Success. Since I have gain'd</L>
<L><HI>Alfred</HI>, the chief of mighty <HI>Woden</HI>'s Priests,</L>
<L>To find a certain Way for thy Escape.</L>
<L>Once of the sacred Habits is at Hand</L>
<L>Prepar'd for thy Disguise, the holy Man</L>
<L>Attends to guide thee to my Brother's Camp:</L>
<L>My self—Oh! yet lye still, my beating Heart—
<STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE></L>
<L>Whatever Dangers chance, my self will be</L>
<L>The Partner and the Guardian of thy Flight.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Now what Return to make—Oh let me sink,</L>
<L>With all these warring Thoughts together in me,</L>
<L>Blushing to Earth, and hide the vast Confusion.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Ye Gods! he answers not, but hangs his Head</L>
<L>In sullen Silence; see! he turns away,</L>
<L>And bends his gloomy Visage to the Earth.</L>
<L>To what am I betray'd! Oh Shame! Dishonour!</L>
<L>And more than Woman's Weakness! He has seen me,</L>
<L>Seen my fond Heart, and scorns the easie Prize.</L>
<L>Blast me, ye Lightnings, strike me to the Centre,</L>
<L>Drive, drive me down, down to the Depths beneath;</L>
<L>Let me not live, nor think—let me not think,</L>
<L>For I have been despis'd—ten thousand thousand,</L>
<L>And yet ten thousand Curses—Oh my Folly!—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Thus let me fall, thus lowly to the Earth,
<STAGE><HI>Kneeling.</HI></STAGE></L>
<L>In humble Adoration of your Goodness;</L>
<L>Thus with my latest Accents breathe your Name,</L>
<L>And bless you e'er I die. Oh <HI>Rodogune</HI>!</L>
<L>Fair Royal Maid! to thee be all thy Wishes,</L>
<L>Content and everlasting Peace dwell with thee,</L>
<L>And every Joy be thine. Nor let one Thought</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="49"/>Of this ungrateful, this unhappy <HI>Aribert</HI></L>
<L>Remain behind, to call a sudden Sigh,</L>
<L>Or stain thee with a Tear. Behold I go,</L>
<L>Doom'd by Eternal Fate, to my long Rest;</L>
<L>Then let my Name too die, sink to Oblivion,</L>
<L>And sleep in Silence with me in the Grave.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Dost thou not wish to live?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>I cannot.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Why?</L>
<L>Behold I give thee Life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>And therefore—oh!</L>
<L>Therefore I cannot take it. I dare die,</L>
<L>But dare not be oblig'd. I dare not owe.</L>
<L>What I can never render back.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Confusion!</L>
<L>Is then the Blessing, Life, become a Curse,</L>
<L>When offer'd to thee by my baleful Hand?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Oh no! for you are all that's good and gracious;</L>
<L>Nature, that makes your Sex the Joy of ours,</L>
<L>Made you the pride of both; she gave you Sweetness,</L>
<L>So mix'd with Strength, with Majesty so rais'd,</L>
<L>To make the willing World confess your Empire,</L>
<L>And love, while they obey. Nor stay'd she there,</L>
<L>But to the Body fitted so the Mind,</L>
<L>As each were fashion'd singly to excel,</L>
<L>As if so fair a Form disdain'd to harbour</L>
<L>A Soul less great, and that great Soul could find</L>
<L>Nothing so like the Heav'n from whence it came,</L>
<L>As that fair Form to dwell in.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Sooting Sounds!</L>
<L>Delightful Flattery from him we love;
<STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE></L>
<L>But what are these to my impatient Hopes!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Yet wherefore should this mighty Mass of Wealth</L>
<L>Be vainly plac'd before my wondring Eyes,</L>
<L>Since I must ne'er possess it, since my Heart,</L>
<L>Once giv'n, can ne'er return, can know no Name</L>
<L>But <HI>Ethelinda</HI>, only <HI>Ethelinda</HI>?</L>
<L>Fix'd to its Choice, and obstinately constant,</L>
<L>It listens not to any other Call.</L>
<L>So rigid Hermits, that forsake the World,</L>
<L>Are deaf to Glory, Greatness, Pomps and Pleasures;</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="50"/>Severe in Zeal, and insolently pious,</L>
<L>They let attending Princes vainly wait,</L>
<L>Knock at their Cells, and lure 'em forth in vain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>How is she form'd? with what superior Grace,</L>
<L>This Rival of my Love? What envious God,</L>
<L>In scorn of Nature's wretched Works below,</L>
<L>Improv'd and made her more than half Divine?</L>
<L>How has he taught her Lips to breathe <HI>Ambrosia</HI>?</L>
<L>How dy'd her Blushes with the Morning's Red,</L>
<L>And cloath'd her with the fairest Beams of Light,</L>
<L>To make her shine beyond me?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Spare the Theme.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>But then her Mind! Ye Gods, which of you all</L>
<L>Could make that great, and fit to rival mine?</L>
<L>What more than heav'nly Fire informs the Mass?</L>
<L>Has she a Soul can dare beyond our Sex,</L>
<L>Beyond ev'n Man himself, can dare like mine?</L>
<L>Can she resolve to bear the secret Stings</L>
<L>Of Shame and conscious Pride, distracting Rage,</L>
<L>And all the deadly Pangs of Love despis'd?</L>
<L>Oh no! she cannot, Nature cannot bear it;
<STAGE><HI>Weeping.</HI></STAGE></L>
<L>It sinks ev'n me, the Torrent drives me down,</L>
<L>The native Greatness of my Spirit fails,</L>
<L>Thus melts, and thus runs gushing thro' my Eyes,</L>
<L>The Floods of Sorrow drown my dying Voice,</L>
<L>And I can only call thee—Cruel <HI>Aribert</HI>!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Oh thou, just Heav'n, if Mortal Man may dare</L>
<L>To look into thy great Decrees, thy Fate,</L>
<L>Were it not better I had never been,</L>
<L>Than thus to bring Affliction and Misfortune,</L>
<L>Thus curse what thou hadst made so good and fair?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rodo.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>But see! the King and cruel Priests appear,</L>
<L>Nor can I save thee now. Thou hast thy Wish;
<STAGE><HI>To</HI> Aribert.</STAGE></L>
<L>But what remains for me? My Heart beats fast,</L>
<L>And swells, impatient at the Tyrant's Sight.</L>
<L>My Blood, e'erwhile at Ebb, now flows again,</L>
<L>And with new Rage I burn. Since Love is lost,</L>
<L>Come thou Revenge, succeed thou to my Bosom,</L>
<L>And reign in all my Soul. Yes, I will find her,</L>
<L>This fatal She, for whom I am despis'd.</L>
<L>Look that she be your Master-Piece, ye Gods;</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="51"/>Let each celestial Hand some Grace impart,</L>
<L>To this rare Pattern of your forming Art;</L>
<L>Such may she be, my jealous Rage to move,</L>

<L>Hast thou bethought thee yet, perfidious Boy!</L>
<L>Wo't thou yet render back thy Theft? Consider,</L>
<L>The Precipice is just beneath thy Feet,</L>
<L>'Tis but a Monument, and I push thee off,</L>
<L>To plunge for ever in Eternal Darkness.</L>
<L>Somewhat like Nature has been busie here,</L>
<L>And made a Struggle for thee in my Soul;</L>
<L>Restore my Love, and be again my Brother.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ari.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Rage, and the Violence of lawless Passion,</L>
<L>Have blinded your clear Reason; wherefore else</L>
<L>This frantick wild Demand? What! should I yield,</L>
<L>Give up my Love, my Wife, my <HI>Ethelinda</HI>,</L>
<L>To an Incestuous Brother's dire Embrace?</L>

<L>Why then, no more. But if we meet again,</L>
