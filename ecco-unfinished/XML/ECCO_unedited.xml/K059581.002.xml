<LG>
<L>WHETHER dispensing hope, and ease</L>
<L>To the pale victim of disease,</L>
<L>Or in the social crowd you sit,</L>
<L>And charm the group with sense and wit,</L>

<L>Attention to my artless strain.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
I mean no giddy heights to climb,</L>
<L>And vainly toil to be sublime;</L>
<L>While every line with labour wrought,</L>
<L>Is swell'd with tropes for want of thought:</L>
<L>Nor shall I call the Muse to shed</L>
<L>Castalian drops upon my head;</L>
<L>Or send me from Parnassian bowers</L>
<L>A chaplet wove of fancy's flowers.</L>
<L>At present all such aid I slight—</L>
<L>My heart instructs me how to write.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That softer glide my hours along,</L>
<L>That still my griefs are sooth'd by song,</L>
<L>That still my careless numbers flow</L>
<L>To your successful skill I owe;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
You, who when sickness o'er me hung,</L>
<L>And languor had my lyre unstrung,</L>
<L>With treasures of the healing art,</L>
<L>With friendship's ardor at your heart,</L>
<L>From sickness snatch'd her early prey</L>
<L>And bade fair health—the goddess gay,</L>
<L>With sprightly air, and winning grace,</L>
<L>With laughing eye, and rosy face,</L>
<L>Accustom'd when you call to hear,</L>
<L>On her light pinion hasten near,</L>
<L>And swift restore with influence kind,</L>
<L>My weaken'd frame, my drooping mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With like benignity, and zeal,</L>
<L>The mental malady to heal,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
To stop the fruitless, hopeless tear,</L>
<L>The life you lengthen'd, render dear,</L>
<L>To charm by fancy's powerful vein,</L>
<L>“The written troubles of the brain,”</L>
<L>From gayer scenes, compassion led</L>
<L>Your frequent footsteps to my shed:</L>
<L>And knowing that the Muses' art</L>
<L>Has power to ease an aching heart,</L>
<L>You sooth'd that heart with partial praise,</L>
<L>And I before too fond of lays,</L>
<L>While others pant for solid gain,</L>
<L>Grasp at a laurel sprig—in vain—</L>
<L>You could not chill with frown severe</L>
<L>The madness to my soul so dear;</L>
<L>For when Apollo came to store</L>
<L>Your mind with salutary lore,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
The god I ween, was pleas'd to dart</L>
<L>A ray from Pindus on your heart;</L>
<L>Your willing bosom caught the fire,</L>
<L>And still is partial to the lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now from you at distance plac'd</L>
<L>Where <HI>Epping</HI> spreads a woody waste;</L>
<L>Tho' unrestrain'd my fancy flies,</L>
<L>And views in air her fabrics rise,</L>
<L>And paints with brighter bloom the flowers,</L>
<L>Bids Dryads people all the bowers,</L>
<L>And Echoes speak from every hill,</L>
<L>And Naiads pour each little rill,</L>
<L>And bands of Sylphs with pride unfold</L>
<L>Their azure plumage mix'd with gold,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
My heart remembers with a sigh</L>
<L>That you are now no longer nigh.</L>
<L>The magic scenes no more engage,</L>
<L>I quit them for your various page;</L>
<L>Where, with delight I traverse o'er</L>
<L>The foreign paths you trod before:</L>
<L>Ah not in vain those paths you trac'd,</L>
<L>With heart to feel, with powers to taste!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amid the ever-jocund train</L>
<L>Who sport upon the banks of Seine,</L>
<L>In your light Frenchman pleas'd I see</L>
<L>His nation's gay epitome;</L>
<L>Whose careless hours glide smooth along,</L>
<L>Who charms MISFORTUNE with a song.</L>

She comes not as on Albion's plain,</L>
<L>With death, and madness in her train;</L>
<L>For here, her keenest sharpest dart</L>
<L>May raze, but cannot pierce the heart.</L>
<L>Yet he whose spirit light as air</L>
<L>Calls life a jest, and laughs at care,</L>
<L>Feels the strong force of pity's voice,</L>
<L>And bids afflicted love rejoice;</L>
<L>Love, such as fills the poet's page</L>
<L>Love, such as form'd the golden age—</L>
<L>FANCHON, thy grateful look I see—</L>
<L>I share thy joys—I weep with thee—</L>
<L>What eye has read without a tear</L>
<L>A tale to nature's heart so dear!</L>

<L>Her lake, from whose broad bosom thrown</L>

<L>And bears his waves with mazy sweep</L>
<L>In rapid torrents to the deep—</L>
<L>Oh for a Muse less weak of wing,</L>

<L>As well as you have told in prose;</L>
<L>How wrapt in snows and icy showers,</L>
<L>Eternal winter, horrid lowers</L>
<L>Upon the mountain's awful brow,</L>
<L>While purple summer blooms below;</L>
<L>How icy structures rear their forms</L>
<L>Pale products of ten thousand storms;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Where the full sun-beam powerless falls</L>
<L>On crystal arches, columns, walls,</L>
<L>Yet paints the proud fantastic height</L>
<L>With all the various hues of light.</L>
<L>Why is no poet call'd to birth</L>
<L>In such a favour'd spot of earth?</L>
<L>How high his vent'rous Muse might rise,</L>
<L>And proudly soorn to ask supplies</L>
<L>From the Parnassian hill, the fire</L>
<L>Of verse, <HI>Mont Blanc</HI> might well inspire.</L>
<L>O SWITZERLAND! how oft these eyes</L>
<L>Desire to view thy mountains rise;</L>
<L>How fancy loves thy steeps to climb,</L>
<L>So wild, so solemn, so sublime;</L>
<L>And o'er thy happy vales to roam,</L>
<L>Where freedom rears her humble home.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Ah, how unlike each social grace</L>
<L>Which binds in love thy manly race,</L>
<L>The HOLLANDERS phlegmatic ease</L>
<L>Too cold to love, too dull to please;</L>
<L>Who feel no sympathetic woe,</L>
<L>Nor sympathetic joy bestow;</L>
<L>But fancy words are only made</L>
<L>To serve the purposes of trade,</L>
<L>And when they neither buy, nor sell,</L>
<L>Think silence answers quite as well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now in his happiest light is seen</L>
<L>VOLTAIRE, when evening chas'd his spleen,</L>
<L>And plac'd at supper with his friends,</L>
<L>The playful flash of wit descends—</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Of names renown'd you clearly shew</L>
<L>The finer traits we wish to know—</L>
<L>To Prussia's martial clime I stray</L>
<L>And see how FREDERIC spends the day;</L>
<L>Behold him rise at dawning light</L>
<L>To form his troops for future fight;</L>
<L>Thro' the firm ranks his glances pierce,</L>
<L>Where discipline, with aspect fierce,</L>
<L>And unrelenting breast, is seen</L>
<L>Degrading man to a machine;</L>
<L>My female heart delights to turn</L>
<L>Where GREATNESS seems not quite so stern:</L>

<L>But lo! on ocean's stormy breast</L>
<L>I see majestic VENICE rest;</L>
<L>While round her spires the billows rave,</L>

<L>Fair liberty has rear'd with toil,</L>
<L>Her fabric on this marshy soil.</L>
<L>She fled those banks with scornful pride,</L>
<L>Where classic Po devolves her tide:</L>
<L>Yet here her unrelenting laws</L>
<L>Are deaf to nature's, freedom's cause.</L>
<L>Unjust! they seal'd FOSCARI'S doom,</L>
<L>An exile in his early bloom.</L>
<L>And he, who bore the rack unmov'd,</L>
<L>Divided far from those he lov'd,</L>
<L>From all the social hour can give,</L>
<L>From all that make it bliss to live,</L>

These worst of ills refus'd to bear,</L>

<P>PART
OF AN
IRREGULAR FRAGMENT,
FOUND IN A
DARK PASSAGE OF THE TOWER.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="advertisement">
<PB REF="23"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem is formed on a very
singular and sublime idea. A young gen∣tleman,
possessed of an uncommon genius for draw∣ing,
on visiting the Tower of London, passing one
door of a singular construction, asked what apart∣ment
it led to, and expressed a desire to have it
opened. The person who shewed the place shook
his head, and answered, “Heaven knows what is
within that door—it has been shut for ages.”—
This answer made small impression on the other
hearers, but a very deep one on the imagination of
<PB REF="24"/>
this youth. Gracious Heaven! an apartment shut
up for ages—and in the Tower!</P>
<Q><L>“Ye Towers of Julius! London's lasting shame,</L>
<L>By many a foul and midnight murder fed.”.</L></Q>
<P>Genius builds on a slight foundation, and rears
beautiful structures on “the baseless fabric of a vi∣sion.”.
The above transient hint dwelt on the
young man's fancy, and conjured into his memory
all the murders which history records to have been
committed in the Tower; Henry the Sixth, the
Duke of Clarence, the two young princes, sons of
Edward the Fourth, Sir Thomas Overbury, &amp;c.
He supposes all their ghosts assembled in this unex∣plored
apartment, and to these his fertile imagina∣tion
has added several others. One of the spectres
<PB REF="25"/>
raises an immense pall of black velvet, and discovers
the remains of a murdered royal family, whose story
is lost in the lapse of time.—The gloomy wildness
of these images struck my imagination so forcibly,
that endeavouring to catch the fire of the youth's
pencil, this Fragment was produced.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THAT no readers of the following work may
entertain expectations respecting it which it
would ill satisfy, it is necessary to acquaint them,
that the author has not had the presumption even to
attempt a full, historical narration of the fall of the
Peruvian empire. To describe that important event
with accuracy, and to display with clearness and
force the various causes which combined to produce
it, would require all the energy of genius, and the
most glowing colours of imagination. Conscious
of her utter inability to execute such a design, she
<PB N="54" REF="50"/>
has only aimed at a simple detail of some few inci∣dents
that make a part of that romantic story;
where the unparalleled sufferings of an innocent and
amiable people, form the most affecting subjects of
true pathos, while their climate, totally unlike our
own, furnishes new and ample materials for poetic
description.</P>
