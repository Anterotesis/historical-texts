<P>IF we consider the projects of the famous Cabal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXVI.</NOTE> it
will be hard to determine, whether the end, which
they proposed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1674.</NOTE> was more blameable and pernicious,
or the means by which they were to effect it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preposterous schemes of the cabal.</NOTE> more impolitic
and imprudent. Though they might talk only of recovering
of fixing the king's authority; their intention could be
no other than that of making him absolute; since it was
not possible to regain or maintain, in opposition to the
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
people, any of those powers of the crown, abolished by late
law or custom, without subduing the people, and render∣ing
the royal prerogative intirely uncontroulable. Against
such a scheme, they might foresee, that every party of
the nation would declare themselves, not only the old
parliamentary party, which, though they kept not in a
body, were still very numerous; but even the greatest
Royalists, who were indeed attached to Monarchy, but
desired to see it limited and restrained by law. It had ap∣peared,
that the present Parliament, though elected dur∣ing
the greatest prevalence of the royal party, were yet
very tenacious of popular privileges, and retained a con∣siderable
jealousy of the Crown, even before they had
received any just ground of suspicion. The guards, there∣fore,
together with a small army, new levied, and undis∣ciplined,
and composed too of Englishmen, were almost
the only domestic resources, which the King could de∣pend
on in the prosecution of these dangerous councils.</P>
<P>THE assistance of France was, no doubt, esteemed by
the Cabal a considerable support in the schemes which
they were forming: but it is not easily conceived, that
they could imagine themselves capable of directing and
employing an associate of so domineering a character.
They ought justly to have suspected, that it would be
Lewis's sole intention, as it evidently was his interest, to
raise incurable jealousies between the King and his peo∣ple;
and that he saw how much a steddy uniform govern∣ment
in this island, whether free or absolute, would
form invincible barriers to his ambition. Should his as∣sistance
be demanded; if he sent a small supply, it would
serve only to enrage the people, and render the breach
altogether irreparable; if he furnished a great force, suf∣ficient
to subdue the nation, there was little reason to
trust his generosity, with regard to the use, which he
would make of this advantage.
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>

<P><PB N="3" REF="10"/>
IN all its other parts, the plans of the Cabal, it must
be confessed, appear equally absurd and incongruous.
If the war with Holland was attended with great success,
and involved the subjection of the republic; such an ac∣cession
of force must fall to Lewis, not to Charles: And
what hopes afterwards of resisting by the greatest unani∣mity
so mighty a monarch? How dangerous, or rather
how ruinous to depend upon his assistance against do∣mestic
discontents? If the Dutch, by their own vigour,
and the assistance of allies, were able to defend them∣selves,
and could bring the war to an equality; the
French arms would be so employed abroad, that no con∣siderable
reinforcement could thence be expected to se∣cond
the King's enterprizes in England. And might not
the project of over-awing or subduing the people be
esteemed, of itself, sufficiently odious, without the ag∣gravation
of sacrificing that State, which they regarded
as their best ally, and with which, on many accounts,
they were desirous of maintaining the greatest concord
and strictest confederacy?</P>
<P>WHATEVER views likewise might be entertained of
promoting by these measures the catholic religion; they
could tend only to render all the other schemes abortive,
and make them fall with inevitable ruin upon the pro∣jectors.
The catholic religion, indeed, where it is esta∣blished,
is more proper than the protestant for support∣ing
an absolute Monarchy; but would any man have
thought of it as the means of acquiring arbitrary author∣ity
in England, where it was more detested than even
slavery itself?</P>
<P>IT must be allowed, that the difficulties, and even in∣consistencies,
attending the schemes of the Cabal, are
so numerous and obvious, that one feels at first an incli∣nation
to deny the reality of those schemes, and to sup∣pose
them entirely the chimeras of calumny and faction.
But the utter impossibility of accounting by any other
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
hypothesis for those strange measures embraced by the
court, as well as for the numerous, circumstances, which
accompanied them, obliges us to acknowledge (though
there remains no direct evidence of it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">No treaty to this purpose with France ever appeared; and indeed, it is probable for the reasons mentioned above, that no such treaty was ever for∣mally entered into: The King thought it sufficient, that he joined his interest with that of the French Monarch, and he believed that this circum∣stance alone would enable him to depend on that Prince's assistance in case of necessity. The abbot Primi indeed published at Paris the terms of a treaty to this purpose: But there are so many difficulties attending his nar∣ration, that it can have little weight with us: He spoke only by conjecture, or if he was supplied by the French Ministers with materials, it was so much the interest of that court to embroil the King with his subjects, that their account is very much to be suspected. He says too, that it was expresly agreed to divide the United Provinces, to give the inland Provinces to Lewis, Zealand to Charles, Holland to the Prince of Orange. But this is very im∣probable on many accounts, particularly because there is no appearance of such a scheme in the French proposals Utrecht. We see plainly by them, that there was no concerted plan betwixt the two Kings, and that they go∣verned themselves entirely by events. Father Orleans, who, it is said, wrote from materials given him by K. James, is the most authentic testi∣mony of the arbitrary designs of the court; and there is no doubt of the truth of his narration in this particular. But his history in other re∣spects is so false and superficial, that were it not supported by other arguments, it would in this narration have small weight with us. But after all, the discourse of Sir William Temple to the King after mentioned, which that Monarch does not oppose, is, next to the evidence of facts, the best proof of the King's intentions.</NOTE>) that a formal plan
was laid for subverting the constitution, and that the
King and the Ministry were in reality conspirators against
the people. What is most probable in human affairs is
not always true; and a very minute circumstance, over∣looked
in our speculations, serves often to explain events,
which may seem the most surprizing and unaccountable.
Though the King possessed penetration and a sound judg∣ment,
his capacity was chiefly fitted for smaller matters<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Duke of Buckingham's character of K. Charles II.</NOTE>,
and the ordinary occurrences of life; nor had he appli∣cation
enough to carry his view to distant consequences,
or to digest and adjust any plan of political operations.
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
AS he scarce ever thought twice on any one subject,
every appearance of advantage was apt to seduce him;
and when he found his way obstructed by unlooked-for
difficulties, he readily turned aside into the first path,
where he expected more to gratify the natural indolence
of his disposition. To this versatility or pliancy of ge∣nius,
he himself was inclined to trust; and he thought,
that, after trying an experiment for enlarging his autho∣rity,
he could easily, if it failed, return into the ordi∣nary
channel of government. But the suspicions of the
people, though they burst not forth at once, were by
this attempt rendered altogether incurable; and the more
they reflected on the circumstances, attending it, the
more resentment and jealousy were they apt to entertain.
They observed, that the King never had any favourite;
that he was never governed by his ministers, scarce even
by his mistresses; and that he himself was the chief spring
of all public councils. Whatever appearance, therefore,
of a change might be pretended, they still suspected,
that the same project was secretly in agitation; and they
deemed no precaution too great to secure them against
the pernicious consequences of such councils.</P>
<P>THE King sensible of this jealousy, was inclined
thenceforth not to trust altogether to his people; and
though obliged to make a separate peace, he still kept
up connexions with the French monarch. He apologized
for deserting his ally, by representing to him all the real
undissembled difficulties, under which he laboured; and
Lewis, with the greatest complaisance and good humour,
admitted the validity of his excuses. The Duke like∣wise,
conscious that his principles and conduct had ren∣dered
him still more obnoxious to the people, maintained
on his own account a separate correspondence with the
French court, and entered into particular connexions
with Lewis, which these princes dignified with the name
of friendship. The Duke had only in view the securing
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
his succession, and favouring the Catholics; and it must
be acknowledged to his praise, that, though his schemes
were dangerous to the people, they gave the King no
just ground of jealousy. A dutiful subject, and an af∣fectionate
brother, he knew no other rule of conduct
but obedience; and the same unlimited submisson, which
afterwards, when King, he exacted of his people, he
was ever willing, before he ascended the throne, to pay
to his Sovereign.</P>
<P>AS the King was at peace with all the world, and al∣most
the only Prince in Europe who was placed in that
agreeable situation, he thought proper to offer his me∣diation
to the contending powers, in order to compose
all their differences. France, willing to negotiate under
so favourable a mediator, very readily accepted Charles's
offer; but, it was apprehended, that, for a like reason,
the allies would be inclined to refuse it. In order to give
a sanction to his new councils, the King invited Tem∣ple
from his retreat, and appointed him ambassador to
the St. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remon∣strances of Sir W. Temple.</NOTE> That wise minister, reflecting on the un∣happy
issue of his former undertakings, and the fatal
turn of councils, which had occasioned it, resolved, be∣fore
he embarked anew, to acquaint himself, as far as
possible, with the real intentions of the King, in those
popular measures, which he seemed again to have adopt∣ed.
After blaming the dangerous schemes of the Cabal,
which the King was desirous to excuse, he told his Ma∣jesty
very plainly, that he would find it extremely diffi∣cult,
if not absolutely impossible, to erect in England
the same system of government and religion, which was
established in France: That the universal bent of the
nation was against both; and it required ages to change
the genius and sentiments of a people: That many, who
were at bottom indifferent in matters of religion, would
yet oppose all alterations on that head; because they con∣sidered,
that nothing but force of arms could subdue the
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
reluctance of the people against popery; after which,
they knew, there could be no security for civil liberty:
That in France every circumstance had long been ad∣justed
to that system of government, and tended to its
establishment and support: That the commonalty, be∣ing
poor and dispirited, were of no account; the nobi∣lity,
engaged by the prospect or possession of numerous
offices, civil and military, were entirely attached to the
court; the ecclesiastics, retained by like motives, added
the sanction of religion to the principles of civil policy:
That in England a great part of the landed property be∣longed
to the yeomanry or middling gentry; the King
had few offices to bestow; and could not himself even sub∣sist,
much less maintain an army, except by the volun∣tary
supplies of his Parliament: That if he had an
army on foot, yet, if composed of Englishmen, they
would never be prevailed on to promote ends, which the
people so much feared and hated: That the Roman Ca∣tholics
in England were not the hundredth part of the
nation, and in Scotland not the two hundredth; and it
seemed against all common sense to hope, by one part,
to govern ninety-nine, who were of contrary sentiments
and dispositions: And that foreign troops, if few, would
tend only to inflame hatred and discontent; and how to
raise and bring over at once, or to maintain many, it was
very difficult to imagine. To these reasonings Temple
added the sentiments of Gourville, a Frenchman, for
whom, he knew, the King had entertained a great esteem.
“A King of England,” said Gourville, “who will be
<HI>the man of his people,</HI> is the greatest King in the world:
But if he will be any thing more, he is nothing at
all.” The King heard at first this discourse with
some impatience; but being a very dextrous dissembler,
he seemed moved at last, and laying his hand on Tem∣ple's,
said with an appearing cordiality, “And I will be
the man of my people.”</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16"/>
TEMPLE when he went abroad, soon found, that the
scheme of mediating a peace was likely to prove abortive.
The allies, besides their jealousy of the King's media∣tion,
were extremely bent upon the continuance of the
war. Spain had stipulated with Holland never to come
to an accommodation, till all things in Flanders were re∣stored
to the condition, in which they had been left by
the Pyrenean treaty. The Emperor had very high pre∣tensions
in Alsace; and as the greatest part of the em∣pire
joined in the alliance, it was hoped, that France, so
much over-matched in force, would soon be obliged to
submit to the terms demanded of her. The states, in∣deed,
oppressed by exorbitant taxes, as well as checked
in their commerce, were desirous of peace, and had few
or no claims of their own to retard it: But they could
not in gratitude, nor even in good policy, abandon allies,
to whose protection they had been so lately indebted for
their safety. The Prince of Orange like wise, who had
great influence in their councils, was all on fire for mili∣tary
fame, and was well pleased to be at the head of ar∣mies,
from which such mighty successes were expected.
Under various pretences, he eluded, during the whole
campaign, the meeting with Temple; and after the
troops were sent into winter-quarters, he told that mini∣ster,
in his first conference, that till greater impression
was made on France, reasonable terms could not be
hoped for; and it was therefore in vain to negotiate.</P>
<P>THE success of the campaign had not answered ex∣pectation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1674.</NOTE>
The prince of Orange, with a superior army,
was opposed in Flanders to the prince of Condé, and had
hoped to penetrate into France by that quarter, where
the frontier was then very feeble. After long endeavour∣ing,
though in vain, to bring Condé to a battle, he
rashly exposed, at Seneffe, a wing of his army; and
that active prince failed not at once to see and to seize
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
the advantage. But this imprudence of the prince of
Orange was amply compensated by his behaviour in that
obstinate and bloody action which ensued. He rallied his
dismayed troops; he led them to the charge; he pushed
the veteran and martial troops of France; and he obliged
the prince of Condé, notwithstanding his age and cha∣racter,
to exert greater efforts, and to risque his person
more, than in any action, where, even during the heat
of youth, he had ever commanded. After sun-set, the
action was continued by the light of the moon; and it
was darkness at last, not the weariness of the combatants,
which put an end to the contest, and left the victory un∣decided.
“ The prince of Orange,” said Condé, with
great candour and generosity, “ has acted in every thing
like an old captain, except venturing his life too like
a young soldier.” Oudenarde was afterwards invested
by the prince of Orange; but he was obliged by the
Imperial and Spanish generals to raise the siege on the
approach of the enemy. He afterwards besieged and
took Grave; and at the beginning of winter, the armies
broke up, with great discontents and complaints on all
sides.</P>
<P>THE allies were not more successful in other places.
Lewis in a few weeks reconquered Franchecomté. In
Alsace, Turenne displayed against a much superior ene∣my,
all that military skill, which had long rendered him
the most renowned captain of his age and nation. By a
sudden and forced march, he attacked and beat at Sintz∣heim
the duke of Lorrain and Caprara, general of the
Imperialists. Seventy thousand Germans pour into Al∣sace,
and take up their quarters in that province. Tu∣renne,
who had retired into Lorrain, returns unexpect∣edly
upon them. He attacks and defeats a body of the
enemy at Mulhausen. He chaces from Colmar the elec∣tor
of Brandenburgh, who commanded the German
troops. He gains a new advantage at Turkheim. And
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
having dislodged all the allies, he obliges them to repass
the Rhine; full of shame for their multiplied defeats,
and still more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1647.</NOTE> of anger and complaints against each
other.</P>
<P>IN England, all these events were considered by the
people with great anxiety and concern; though the King
and his ministers affected great indifference with regard
to them. Considerable alterations were about this time
made in the English ministry. Buckingham was dis∣graced,
who had long, by his wit and entertaining hu∣mour,
possessed the King's favour. The chief ministers
were Arlington, now lord chamberlain, and Danby the
treasurer. Great hatred and jealousy took place between
these ministers; and the King's affairs were somewhat
disturbed by their quarrels. But Danby gained ground
every day with the King, and Arlington declined in the
same proportion. Danby was a frugal minister; and by
his application and industry, he brought the revenue into
tolerable order. He endeavoured so to conduct himself
as to give offence to no party; and the consequence was,
that he was able entirely to pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase none. He was al∣ways
a declared enemy to the French alliance; but never
possessed authority enough to overcome the prepossessions,
which the King and the Duke retained towards it. It
must be ascribed to the prevalence of that interest, that
the Parliament was assembled so late this year; lest they
should attempt to engage the King in measures against
France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1675.</NOTE> during the ensuing campaign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of April.</NOTE> They met not
till the approach of summer.</P>
<P>EVERY step taken by the Commons discovered that ill
humour and jealousy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> to which the late open measures
of the King, and his present secret attachments gave
such just foundation. They drew up a new bill against po∣pery,
and resolved to insert in it many severe clauses for
the detection and prosecution of priests: They presented
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
addresses a second time against Lauderdale; and when the
King's answer was not satisfactory, they seemed still de∣termined
to persevere in their applications: An accusa∣tion
was moved against Danby; but upon examining the
several articles, it was not found to contain any just rea∣sons
of a prosecution; and was therefore dropped: They
applied to the King for recalling his troops from the
French service; and as he only promised, that they
should not be recruited, they appeared to be much dissa∣tisfied
with his answer: A bill was brought in, making
it treason to levy money without authority of parliament:
Another vacating the seats of such members as accepted
of offices: Another to secure the personal liberty of the
subject, and to prevent sending any one prisoner be∣yond
sea.</P>
<P>THAT the court party might not be idle, during these
attacks, a bill for a new test was introduced into the
House of Peers by the earl of Lindesey. All members
of either house, and all who possessed any office, were
by this bill required to swear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Passive obe∣dience.</NOTE> that it was not lawful,
upon any pretence whatsoever, to take arms against the
King; that they abhorred the traiterous position of tak∣ing
arms by his authority against his person, or against
those commissioned by him; and that they will not at
any time endeavour the alteration of the protestant reli∣gion,
or of the established government either in church
or state.</P>
<P>GREAT opposition was made to this bill; as might be
expected from the present disposition of the public. Dur∣ing
seventeen days, the debates were carried on with
much zeal; and all the reason and learning of both par∣ties
were displayed on this memorable occasion. The
question, indeed, with regard to resistance, was a point,
which entered into the controversies of the old parties,
cavalier and roundhead; as it made an essential part of
the present disputes between court and country. Few
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
neuters were found in the nation: But among such as
could maintain a calm indifference, there prevailed senti∣ments
very wide of those adopted by either party. Such
persons thought, that all public declarations of the le∣gislature,
either for or against resistance, were equally
impolitic, and could serve to no other purpose, than to
signalize in their turn the triumph of one faction over
another: That the simplicity retained in the antient laws
of England, as well as in the laws of every other na∣tion,
ought still to be preserved, and was best calculated
to prevent the extremes on either side: That the abso∣lute
exclusion of resistance, in all possible cases, was
founded on <HI>false</HI> principles; its express admission might
be attended with <HI>dangerous</HI> consequences; and there was
no necessity of exposing the public to either inconve∣nience:
That if a choice must necessarily be made in
the case, the preference of utility to truth in public in∣stitutions
was apparent; nor could the supposition of re∣sistance,
beforehand and in general terms, be safely ad∣mitted
in any government: That even in mixt monar∣chies,
where that supposition seemed most requisite, it
was yet entirely superfluous; since no man, on the ap∣proach
of extraordinary necessity, could be at a loss,
though not directed by legal declarations, to find the
proper remedy: That even those who might, at a
distance and in scholastic reasoning, exclude all re∣sistance,
would yet hearken to the voice of nature; when
evident ruin, both to themselves and to the public, must
attend a strict adherence to their pretended principles:
That the question, as it ought thus to be entirely ex∣cluded
from all determinations of the legislature, was,
even among private reasoners, little better than a dispute
of words: That the one party could not pretend, that
resistance ought ever to become a familiar practice; the
other would surely have recourse to it in great extremi∣ties:
And thus the difference could only turn on the de∣grees
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
of danger or oppression, which could warrant this
irregular remedy; a difference, which, in a general ques∣tion,
it was impossible, by any language, precisely to fix
or determine.</P>
<P>THERE were many other absurdities in this test, par∣ticularly
that of swearing not to alter the government
either in church or state; since all human institutions are
liable to abuse, and require continual amendments, which
are, in reality, so many alterations. It is not indeed
possible to make a law, which does not innovate, more
or less, in the government. These difficulties produced
such obstructions to the bill, that it was carried only by
two voices in the House of Peers. All the popish Lords,
headed by the earl of Bristol, voted against it. It was
sent down to the House at Commons, where it was
likely to meet with a scrutiny still more severe.</P>
<P>BUT a quarrel, which ensued between the two Houses,
prevented the passing all the bills projected during the pre∣sent
session. One Dr. Shirley, being cast in a law-suit
before the Chancery against Sir John Fag, a member of
the House of Commons, preferred a petition of appeal
before the House of Peers. The Lords received it, and
summoned Fag to appear before them. He complained
to the lower House, who espoused his cause. They not
only maintained, that no member of their house could
be summoned before the Peers; and for this claim they
could plead precedent: They also asserted, that the
upper House could receive no appeals from any court of
equity; a pretension, which extremely retrenched the
jurisdiction of the Peers, and which was contrary to the
practice that had prevailed during this whole century.
The Commons send Shirley to prison: the Lords assert
their powers. Conferences are tried; but no accommo∣dation
ensues. Four lawyers are sent to the Tower by
the Commons, for transgressing the order of the House,
and pleading in this cause before the Peers. The Peers
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
denominate this arbitrary commitment a breach of the
great charter, and order the lieutenant of the Tower to
release the prisoners: He refuses obedience: They ap∣ply
to the King, and desire him to punish the lieutenant
for his contempt. The King summons both Houses;
exhorts them to unanimity; and informs them, that the
present quarrel had arisen from the contrivance of his and
their enemies, who proposed by that means to force a
dissolution of the Parliament. His advice has no effect:
The Commons continue as violent as ever; and the
King, finding that no business could be finished, at last
prorogued the Parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of June.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN the Parliament were again assembled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of Oc∣tober.</NOTE> there ap∣peared
not in any respect a change of the dispositions of<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE>
either house. The King desired supplies, as well for the
building of ships as for taking off anticipations, which
lay upon his revenue. He even confessed, that he had
not been altogether so frugal as he might have been, and
as he resolved to be for the future: Though he asserted,
that to his great satisfaction he had found his expences by
no means so exorbitant as some had represented them. The
Commons took into consideration the subject of supply.
They voted 300,000 pounds for the building of ships;
but they appropriated the sum by very strict clauses. They
passed a resolution not to grant any supply for taking off
the anticipations of the revenue<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Several historians have affirmed, that the Commons found, this session, upon enquiry, that the King's revenue was 1,600,000 pounds a year, and that the necessary expence was but 700,000 pounds; and have appealed to the Journals for a proof. But there is not the least appearance of this in the Journals; and the fact is impossible.</NOTE>. This vote was
carried in a very full house, by a majority of four only:
So nearly were the parties ballanced. The quarrel was
revived, to which Dr. Shirley's cause had given occasion.
The proceedings of the Commons discovered equal vio∣lence
as during last session. A motion was made in the
House of Peers, but rejected, for addressing the King to
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
dissolve the present Parliament. The King contented him∣self
with proroguing them to a very long term. Whether
these quarrels between the Houses arose from contrivance
or accident was never certainly known.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of No∣vember.</NOTE> Each party
might, according to their different views, esteem them∣selves
either gainers or losers by them. The Court
might desire to obstruct all attacks from the Commons,
by giving them other employment. The country party
might desire the dissolution of a Parliament, which, not∣withstanding
all disgusts, still contained too many roya∣lists,
ever to serve all the purposes of the malecontents.</P>
<P>SOON after the prorogation, there passed a transaction,
which in itself is trivial, but tends strongly to mark the
genius of the English government, and of Charles's ad∣ministration
during this period. The liberty of the
constitution, and the variety as well as violence of the
parties, had begot a propensity for political conversation;
and as the coffee-houses in particular were the scenes,
where the conduct of the King and the ministry was can∣vassed
with great freedom, a proclamation was issued to
suppress these places of rendezvous. Such an act of
power, during former reigns, would have been ground∣ed
entirely on the prerogative; and before the accession
of the house of Stuart, no scruple would have been en∣tertained
with regard to that exercise of authority. But
Charles, finding doubts to arise upon his proclamation,
had recourse to the judges, who supplied him with a chi∣cane
of law, and that too a very frivolous one, by
which he might justify his proceedings. The act, which
settled the excise; gave the King a power to refuse li∣cences
for retailing liquors to such as could not find se∣curity
for payment of the duties. But coffee was not a
liquor liable to excise and even this power of refusing
licences was very, limited, and could not reasonably be
extended beyond the intention of the acr. The King,
therefore, observing the people to be much dissatisfied,
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
yielded to a petition of the coffee-men, who promised
for the future to restrain all seditious discourse in their
houses; and the proclamation was recalled.</P>
<P>THIS campaign proved more fortunate to the confede∣rates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1675.</NOTE>
than any other during this whole war. The
French took the field in Flanders with a very numerous
army; and the King himself-served as a volunteer under
the prince of Condé. But notwithstanding his mighty
preparations, he could gain no advantages but the taking
of Huy and Limbourg, places of no great consequence.
The prince of Orange with a considerable army opposed
him in all his motions; and neither party was willing,
without a visible advantage, to hazard a general battle,
which might be attended either with the entire loss of
Flanders on the one hand, or the invasion of France on the
other. Lewis tired of so unactive a campaign, returned
to Versailles; and the whole summer passed in Flanders
without any memorable event.</P>
<P>TURENNE commanded on the upper Rhine, in oppo∣sition
to his great rival, Montecuculi, general of the
Imperialists. The object of the latter was to pass the
Rhine, to penetrate into Alsace, Lorraine, or Burgundy,
and to fix his quarters in these provinces: The aim of
the former was to guard the French frontiers, and to
disappoint all the schemes of his enemy. The most
consummate skill was displayed on both sides; and if
any superiority appeared in Turenne's conduct, it was
ascribed chiefly to his greater vigour of body, by which
he was enabled to inspect all the posts in person, and
could on the spot take the justest measures for the execu∣tion
of his designs. By posting himself on the German
side of the Rhine, he not only kept Montecuculi from
passing that river: He had also laid his plan in so mas∣terly
a manner, that in a few days he must have obliged
the Germans to decamp, and have gained a considera∣ble
advantage over them; when a period was put to his
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
illustrious life, by a random shot, which struck him on
the breast, as he was taking a view of the enemy. The
news excited sorrow in King, court, and people, equalled
by nothing which we meet with in history, but the la∣mentations
of the Roman people for the death of Ger∣manicus.
The consternation of the army was inexpres∣sible.
The French troops, who, a moment before,
were assured of victory, now considered themselves as
totally vanquished; and the Germans, who would have
been glad to compound for a safe retreat, expected no
less than the total destruction of the enemy. But de
Lorges, nephew to Turenne, succeeded him in the com∣mand,
and possessed a great share of the genius and ca∣pacity
of his predecessor. By his skilful operations, the
French were enabled to repass the Rhine; without con∣siderable
loss; and this retreat was esteemed equally
glorious with the greatst victory. The desperate valour
of the English troops, who were placed in the rear,
contributed greatly to save the French army. They had
been seized with equal passion as the native troops of
France, for their brave general, and fought with ardour
to revenge his death on the Germans. The duke of
Marlborough, then captain Churchill, here learned the
rudiments of that art, which he afterwards practised with
such fatal success against France.</P>
<P>THE prince of Condé left the army in Flanders under
the command of Luxembourg; and carrying with him
a considerable reinforcement, succeeded to Turenne's
command. He defended Alsace from the Germans, who
had passed the Rhine, and invaded that province. He
obliged them first to raise the siege of Hagenau, then
that of Saberne. He eluded all their attempts to bring
him to a battle. And having dextrously kept them from
establishing themselves in Alsace, he forced them, not∣withstanding
their superiority of number, to repass the
<PB N="17" REF="27"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="18" REF="28"/>
Rhine, and take up their winter quarters in their own
country.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of Turenne, a detachment of the
German army was sent to the siege of Treves: An en∣terprize,
in which the Imperialists, the Spaniards, the
Palatine, the duke of Lorraine, and many other princes
passionately concurred. The project was well concerted,
and executed with vigour. Mareschal Crequi, on the
other hand, collected an army, and advanced with a
view of forcing the Germans to raise the siege. They left
a detachment to guard their lines, and under the command
of the dukes of Zell and Osnabrugh, marched in quest of
the enemy. At Consarbric, they fell unexpectedly, and
with superior numbers,, on Crequi, and put him to rout.
He escaped with four attendants only; and throwing
himself into Treves, resolved by a vigorous defence to
make amends for his former error or misfortune. The
garrison was brave, but not abandoned to that total de∣spair,
by which their governor was actuated. They
mutinied against his obstinacy; capitulated for them∣selves;
and because he refused to sign the capitulation,
they delivered him a prisoner into the hands of the
enemy.</P>
<P>'TIS remarkable, that this rout of Crequi is almost
the only battle, which the French lost at land, from Ro∣croi
to Blenheim, during the course of above sixty years;
and these too, full of bloody wars against potent and
martial enemies: Their victories equal almost the num∣ber
of years during that period. Such was the vigour
and good conduct of that Monarchy! And such too
were the resources and refined policy of the European
nations, by which they were enabled to repair their losses,
and still to confine that mighty power nearly within its
antient limits! A fifth part of these victories would have
sufficed in another period to have given to France the
empire of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="29"/>
THE Swedes had been engaged, by the payment of
large subsidies, to take part with Lewis, and invade the
territories of the elector of Brandenburgh in Pomera∣nia.
That elector, joined by some Imperialists from Si∣lesia,
fell upon them with great bravery and success.
He soon beat them out of his part of that country, and
pursued them into their own. He had an interview with
the King of Denmark, who was now entered into the
interests of the confederates, and resolved to declare war
against Sweden. These princes concerted measures for
pushing the victory.</P>
<P>TO all these misfortunes against foreign enemies were
united some domestic insurrections of the common peo∣ple
in Guienne and Brittany. Though soon suppressed,
they divided the force and attention of Lewis. The
only advantage, gained by the French, was at sea. Mes∣sina
in Sicily had revolted; and a fleet under the duke
de Vivonne was dispatched to support the rebels. The
Dutch had sent a squadron to assist the Spaniards. A
battle ensued, where de Ruyter was killed. This event
alone was thought equivalent to a victory.</P>
<P>THE French, who, twelve years before, had scarce a
ship of war in any of their harbours, had raised them∣selves,
by means of perseverance and policy, to be, in
their present force, though not in their resources, the
first maritime power in Europe. The Dutch, while
in alliance with them against England, had supplied
them with several vessels, and had taught them the ru∣dimerits
of the difficult art of ship building. The Eng∣lish
next, when in alliance with them against Holland,
instructed them in the method of fighting their ships,
and of preserving order in naval engagements. Lewis
availed himself of every opportunity to aggrandize his
people, while Charles, sunk in indolence and pleasure,
neglected all the noble arts of government; or if, at
time he roused himself from his lethargy, that in∣dustry,
<PB N="20" REF="30"/>
by reason of the unhappy projects which he em∣braced,
was often more pernicious to the public than his
inactivity itself. He was as anxious to promote the na∣val
power of France, as if the safety of his crown had
depended on it; and many of the plans executed in
that kingdom, were first, 'tis said<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Welwood, Burnet, Coke.</NOTE>, digested and cor∣rected
by him.</P>
<P>THE successes of the allies had been considerable the
last campaign;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1676.</NOTE> but the Spaniards and Imperialists well
knew, that France was not yet sufficiently broke, nor
willing to submit to the terms which they resolved to
impose upon her. Though they could not refuse the
King's mediation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Congress of Nimeguen.</NOTE> and Nimeguen, after many difficul∣ties,
was at last fixed on as the place of congress; yet
under one pretence or other, they still delayed sending
their ambassadors, and no progress was made in the ne∣gotiation.
Lord Berkeley, Sir William Temple, and
Sir Lionel Jenkins, were the English ministers at Nime∣guen.
The Dutch, who were impatient for peace, soon
appeared: Lewis, who hoped to divide the allies, and
who knew, that he himself could neither be seduced nor
forced into a disadvantageous peace, sent ambassadors:
The Swedes, who hoped to recover by treaty, what they
had lost by arms, were also forward to negotiate. But
as these powers could not proceed of themselves to settle
terms, the congress hitherto served merely as an amusement
to the public.</P>
<P>IT was by the events of the campaign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1676.</NOTE> not the confe∣rences
of the negotiators, that the articles of peace were
to be determined. The Spanish towns, ill fortified and
worse defended, made but a feeble resistance to Lewis,
who, by laying up magazines during the winter, was
able to take the field early in the spring, before the fo∣rage
could be found in the open country. In the month
of April he laid siege to Condé, and took it by storm it
<PB N="21" REF="31"/>
four days. Having sent the duke of Orleans to besiege
Bouchaine, a small but important fortress, he posted
himself so advantageously with his main army, as to
hinder the confederates from relieving it, or fighting
without disadvantage. The Prince, in spite of all the
difficulties of the season, and the want of provisions,
came in sight of the French army; but his industry
served to no other purpose than to render him a specta∣tor
of the surrender of Bouchaine. Both armies stood in
awe of each other, and were unwilling to hazard an ac∣tion,
which might be attended with the most important
consequences. Lewis, though he wanted not personal
courage, was very little enterprizing in the field; and
being resolved this campaign to rest contented with the
advantages which he had so early acquired, he thought
proper to entrust his army to Mareschal Schomberg, and
retired himself to Versailles. After his departure,
the Prince of Orange laid siege to Maestricht; but
meeting with an obstinate resistance, he was obliged, on
the approach of Schomberg, who in the mean time had
taken Aire, to raise the siege. He was incapable of
yielding to adversity, or bending under misfortunes: But
he began to foresee, that by the negligence and errors of
his allies, the war in Flanders must necessarily have a
very unfortunate issue.</P>
<P>ON the upper Rhine, Philipsbourg was taken by the
Imperialists. In Pomerania, the Swedes were so unsuc∣cessful
against the Danes and Brandenburgers, that they
seemed to be losing apace all those possessions, which,
with so much valour and good fortune, they had ac∣quired
in Germany.</P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of winter, the congress of
Nimeguen was pretty full, and the plenipotentiaries of
the Emperor and Spain, two powers strictly conjoined by
blood and alliance, at last appeared. The Dutch had
threatened, if they delayed any longer, to proceed to a
<PB N="22" REF="32"/>
separate treaty with France. In the conferences and ne∣gotiations
the dispositions of the parties became every
day more apparent.</P>
<P>THE Hollanders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1677.</NOTE> loaded with debts, and harrassed with
taxes, were desirous of putting an end to a war; in
which, besides the inconveniencies attending all leagues,
the weakness of the Spaniards, the divisions and delays
of the Germans, prognosticated nothing but disgrace
and misfortune. Their commerce languished; and what
gave them still greater anxiety, the commerce of Eng∣land,
by reason of her neutrality, flourished extremely;
and they were apprehensive, left advantages, once lost,
would never thoroughly be regained. They had them∣selves
no farther motive for continuing the war, except
to secure a good frontier to Flanders; but gratitude to
their allies still engaged them, to try, whether another
campaign might procure a peace, which would give
general satisfaction. The Prince of Orange, urged by
motives of honour, of ambition, and of animosity against
France, endeavoured to keep them steady to this re∣solution.</P>
<P>THE Spaniards, not to mention the other incurable
weaknesses, into which their monarchy was fallen,
were distracted with domestic dissensions between the par∣ties
of the Queen Regent and Don John, natural bro∣ther-to
their young sovereign. Though unable of them∣selves
to defend Flanders, they were resolute not to con∣clued
a peace, which would leave it exposed to every
assault or inroad; and while they made the most mag∣nificent
promises to the States, their real trust was in
the protection of England. They saw, that, if that
small but important territory was once subdued by France,
the Hollanders, exposed to so terrible a power, would
fall into dependance, and would endeavour, by submis∣sions,
to ward off that destruction, to which a war it
the heart of their State must necessarily expose them
<PB N="23" REF="33"/>
They believed that Lewis, sensible how much greater
advantages he might reap from the alliance than from
the subjection of the Republic, which must scatter its
people, and depress its commerce, would be content∣ed
with very moderate conditions, and would turn his
enterprizes against his other neighbours. They thought
it impossible but the people and Parliament of England,
foreseeing these obvious consequences, must at last force
the King to take part in the affairs of the continent,
in which their interests were so deeply concerned. And
they trusted, that even the King himself, on the ap∣proach
of so great a danger, must open his eyes, and
sacrifice his prejudices, in favour of France, to the safety
of his own kingdoms.</P>
<P>BUT Charles here found himself entangled in such<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncertain conduct of the King.</NOTE>
opposite motives and engagements, as he had not reso∣lution
enough to break, nor patience to unravel. On
the one hand, he always regarded his alliance with
France as a sure resource in case of any commotions
among his own subjects; and whatever schemes he might
have formed for enlarging his authority, or altering the
established religion, it was from that quarter alone he
could expect assistance. He had actually in secret sold
his neutrality to France, and he received remittances of
a million of livres a year, which was afterwards increased
to two millions; a considerable supply in the present em∣barrassed
state of his revenue. And he dreaded, lest the
Parliament should treat him as they had formerly done
his father; and after they had engaged him in a war on
the continent, should take advantage of his necessities,
and make him purchase supplies by sacrificing his prero∣gative,
and abandoning his ministers.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the cries of his people and Par∣liament,
seconded by Danby, Arlington, and most of
his ministers, incited him to take part with the allies,
and to correct the unequal ballance of power in Europe.
<PB N="24" REF="34"/>
He might apprehend danger from opposing such earnest
desires: He might hope for large supplies, if he con∣curred
with them: And however inglorious and indolent
his disposition, the renown of acting as arbiter of Eu∣rope,
would probably at intervals rouze him from his
lethargy, and move him to support the high character,
with which he was invested.</P>
<P>IT is worthy observation, that during this period, the
King was, by every one, abroad and at home, by
France and by the allies, allowed to be the undisputed
arbiter of Europe; and no terms of peace, which he
would have prescribed, could have been refused by ei∣ther
party. Tho' France afterwards found means to re∣sist
the same alliance, joined with England; yet was she
then obliged to make such violent efforts as quite ex∣hausted
her; and it was the utmost necessity, which
pushed her to find resources, far surpassing her own ex∣pectations.
Charles was sensible, that, so long as the
war continued abroad, he should never enjoy ease at
home, from the impatience and importunity of his sub∣jects;
yet could he not resolve to impose a peace by
openly conjoining himself with either party. Terms
advantageous to the allies must lose him the friendship
of France; The contrary would enrage his Parliament.
Between these views, he perpetually floated; and from
his conduct, it is observable, that a careless, remiss dis∣position,
agitated by opposite, motives, is capable of as
great inconsistencies as is incident even to the greatest
imbecillity and folly.</P>
<P>THE Parliament was assembled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> and the King made
them a very plausible speech,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> in which he warned them
against all differences among themselves; expressed a
resolution to do his part for bringing their consultations
to a happy issue; and offered his consent to any laws for
the farther security of their religion, liberty, and property.
He then told them of the decayed condition of the navy;
<PB N="25" REF="35"/>
and asked money for repairing it: He informed them,
that part of his revenue, the additional excise, was soon
to expire: And he added these words, “You may at
any time see the yearly established expence of the
government, by which it will appear, that the con∣stant
and unavoidable charge being paid, there will
remain no overplus towards answering those contin∣gencies,
which may happen in all kingdoms, and
which have been a considerable burthen on me this
last year.”</P>
<P>BEFORE the parliament entered upon business, they
were stopped by a doubt which was started concerning
the legality of their meeting. It had been enacted by
an old law of Edward the third, “That Parliaments
should be held once every year, or oftner, if need
be.” The last prorogation had been longer than a
year; and being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upposed on that account illegal, it was
pretended to be equivalent to a dissolution. The conse∣quence
seems by no means just; and besides, a latter act,
that which repealed the triennial law, had determined,
that it was necessary to hold Parliaments only once in
three years. Such weight, however, was put on this
cavil, that Buckingham, Shaftesbury, Salisbury, and
Wharton, insisted strenuously in the House of Peers on
the invalidity of the Parliament, and the nullity of all
its future acts. For such dangerous positions, they were
sent to the Tower, there to remain during the pleasure
of his Majesty and the House. Buckingham, Salisbury,
and Wharton made submissions, and were soon after re∣leased.
But Shaftesbury, more obstinate in his temper,
and desirous of distinguishing himself by his adherence
to liberty, sought the remedy of law; and being rejected
by the judges, he was at last, after a twelvemonth's im∣prisonment,
obliged to make the same submissions; upon
which he was also released.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="36"/>
THE Commons at first seemed to proceed with temper.
They granted the sum of 586,000 pounds, for building
thirty ships; tho' they strictly appropriated the money to
that service. Estimates were given in of the expence;
but it was afterwards found that they fell short near
100,000 pounds. They also voted, agreeably to the
King's request, the continuance of the additional excise
for three years. This excise had been granted for nine
years in 1668. Every thing seemed to promise a peace∣able
and an easy session.</P>
<P>BUT the Parliament was soon roused from this tran∣quillity<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1677.</NOTE>
by the news received from abroad. The French
King had taken the field in the middle of February, and
laid siege to Valenciennes, which he carried in a few
days by storm. He next invested both Cambray and St.
Omer. The prince of Orange, alarmed with this pro∣gress,
hastily assembled an army, and marched to the
relief of St. Omer. He was encountered by the French,
under the duke of Orleans and mareschal Luxembourg.
The prince possessed great talents for war; courage, ac∣tivity,
vigilance, patience; but still he was inferior in
genius to those consummate generals, opposed to him by
Lewis; and though he always found means to repair his
losses, and to make head in a little time against the vic∣tors,
he was during his whole life unsuccessful. By a
masterly movement of Luxembourg, he was here beat,
and obliged to retreat to Ypres. During the battle, he
made the utmost efforts, by exhortation and example, to
rally his dismayed soldiers: He struck one of the runa∣ways
across the face with his sword, “ Rascal,” said he,
“ I will set a mark on you at present, that I may hang
you afterwards.” Cambray and St. Omer were soon
surrendered to Lewis.</P>
<P>THIS success, derived from such exorbitant power
and such wise conduct, struck a just terror into the
English Parliament. They addressed the King, repre∣senting
<PB N="27" REF="37"/>
the danger to which the kingdom was expos∣ed
from the greatness of France, and desiring, that his
Majesty, by such alliances as he should think fit, would
both secure his own dominions and the Spanish Ne∣therlands,
and thereby quiet the fears of his people.
The King, desirous of eluding this application, which
he considered as a kind of attack on his measures, re∣plied
in general terms, that he would use all means for
the preservation of Flanders, consistent with the peace
and safety of his kingdoms. This answer was an eva∣sion,
or rather a real denial. The Commons, therefore,
thought proper to be more particular. They entreated
him not to defer the entering into such alliances as might
attain that great end: And in case war with the French
King should be the result of his measures, they promised
to grant him all the aids and supplies, which would ena∣ble
him to support the honour and interest of the nation.
The king was also more particular in his reply. He
told them, that the only way to prevent danger, was to
put him in a condition to make preparations for their se∣curity.
This message was understood to be a demand
of money. The Parliament accordingly empowered
the king to borrow on the additional excise 200,000
pounds, at seven per cent: A very small sum indeed;
but which they deemed sufficient, with the ordinary re∣venue,
to equip a good squadron, and thereby put the na∣tion
in security, till farther resolutions were taken.</P>
<P>BUT this concession fell far short of the King's ex∣pectations.
He therefore informed them, that unless
they granted him the sum of 600,000 pounds upon new
funds, it would not be possible for him, without exposing
the nation to manifest danger, to speak or act those
things, which would answer the end of their several
addresses. The House took this message into conside∣ration:
But before they came to any resolution, the
King sent for them to Whitehall, where he told them,
<PB N="28" REF="38"/>
upon the word of a King, that they should not repent
any trust, which they would repose in him for the
safety of his kingdoms; that he would not for any con∣sideration
break credit with them, or employ their mo∣ney
to other uses, than those for which they intended it;
but that he would not hazard, either his own safety
or theirs, by taking any vigorous measures, or forming
new alliances, till he was in a better condition, both
to defend his subjects, and offend his enemies. This
speech brought affairs to a short issue. The King re∣quired
them to trust him with a large sum: He pawned
his royal word for their security: They must either
run the risque of losing their money, or endanger those
alliances they had projected, and at the same time de∣clare
to all the world the highest di∣strust of their so∣vereign.</P>
<P>BUT there were many reasons which determined the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament's distrust of the King.</NOTE>
House of Commons to put no trust in his Majesty.
They considered, that the pretence of danger was ob∣viously
groundless; while the French were opposed by
such powerful alliances on the continent, while the
King was master of a good fleet at sea, and while all
his subjects were so heartily united in opposition to fo∣reign
enemies. That the only justifiable reason, there∣fore,
of the King's backwardness, was not the apprehen∣sion
of danger from abroad, but a diffidence, which he
might perhaps have entertained of his Parliament; lest,
after engaging him in foreign alliances for carrying on
a war, they should take advantage of his necessities,
and extort from him concessions dangerous to his royal
dignity. That this Parliament, by their past conduct,
had given no foundation for such suspicions, and were
so far from pursuing any sinister ends, that they had
granted supplies for the first Dutch war; for maintain∣ing
the triple league, though concluded without their
advice; even for carrying on the second Dutch war; which
<PB N="29" REF="39"/>
was entered into contrary to their opinion, and contrary
to the manifest interests of the nation. That on the
other hand, the King had, by former measures, excited
very reasonable jealousies in his people, and did with a
bad grace require at present their trust and confidence.
That he had not scrupled to demand supplies for main∣taining
the triple league, at the very moment he was
concerting measures for breaking it, and had accordingly
employed to that purpose the supplies, which he had ob∣tained
by those delusive pretensions. That his union
with France, during the war against Holland, must have
been founded on projects the most dangerous to his peo∣ple;
and as the same union was still secretly maintained,
it might justly be feared, that the same projects were
not yet entirely abandoned. That the King could not
seriously intend to prosecute vigorous measures against
France; since he had so long remained entirely uncon∣cerned
during such obvious dangers, and, till prompted
by his Parliament, whose proper business it was not to
take the lead in those parts of administration, had sus∣pended
all his activity. That if he really meant to enter
into a cordial union with his people, he would have
taken the first step, and have endeavoured, by putting
trust in them, to restore that confidence, which he him∣self,
by his rash councils, had first violated. That it
was in vain to ask so small a sum as 600,000 pounds, in
order to secure him against the future attempts of the
Parliament; since that sum must soon be exhausted by a
war with France, and he must again fall into that depen∣dance,
which was become in some degree essential to the
constitution. That if he would form the necessary alli∣ances,
that sum or a greater would instantly be voted;
nor could there be any reason to dread, that the parlia∣ment
would immediately desert measures, in which they
were engaged by their honour, their inclination, and the
public interest. That the real ground, therefore, of
<PB N="30" REF="40"/>
the King's refusal was neither apprehension of danger
from foreign enemies, nor jealousy of parliamentary en∣croachments;
but a desire of obtaining the money,
which he intended, notwithstanding his royal word, to
employ to other purposes. And that by using such dis∣honourable
means to so ignoble an end, he rendered
himself still more unworthy the confidence of his
people.</P>
<P>THE House of Commons were now regularly divided
into two parties, the court and the country. Some were
inlisted in the court-party by offices, nay a few by bribes
secretly given them; a scandalous practice first begun by
Clifford, a pernicious minister: But great numbers were
attached merely by inclination; so far as they esteemed the
measures of the Court agreeable to the interests of the nation.
Private views and faction had likewise drawn many into
the country party: But there were also many, who had no
other object than the public good. These disinterested
members on both sides fluctuated between the parties; and
gave the superiority sometimes to the Court, sometimes to
the opposition<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Temple's Memoirs, vol. i. p. 458.</NOTE>. In the present emergence, a general
distrust of the King prevailed; and the Parliament re∣solved
not to hazard their money, in expectation of alli∣ances,
which, they believed, were never intended to be
formed. Instead of granting the supply, they voted an
address, wherein “ they besought his majesty to enter
into a league, offensive and defensive, with the States
General of the United Provinces, against the growth
and power of the French King, and for the preserva∣tion
of the Spanish Netherlands; and to make such
other alliances with the confederates as should appear
fit and useful to that end.” They supported their ad∣vice
with reasons; and promised speedy and plentiful supplies,
for preserving his Majesty's honour and the safety
<PB N="31" REF="41"/>
of the public. The King pretended the highest anger
at this address, which he represented as a dange∣rous
encroachment upon his prerogative. He reproved
the Commons in very severe terms; and ordered them
immediately to be adjourned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of May.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is certain, that this was the critical moment, when
the King both might with ease have preserved the ba∣lance
of power in Europe, which it has since cost this
island an infinite profusion of blood and treasure to re∣store,
and might by perseverance have at last regained,
in some tolerable measure, after all past, errors, the con∣fidence
of his people. This opportunity being neglected,
the wound became incurable; and notwithstanding <HI>his</HI>
momentary appearances of vigour against France and po∣pery,
and <HI>their</HI> momentary inclinations to rely on his
faith; <HI>he</HI> was still believed to be at bottom engaged in
the same interest, and <HI>they</HI> soon relapsed into distrust and
jealousy. The secret memoirs of that reign, which have
been since published<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Such as the letters, which passed betwixt Danby and Montague, the King's ambassador at Paris; Temple's Memoirs, and his Letters. In these last, we see that the King never made any proposals of terms but what were advantageous to France, and the prince of Orange believed them to have been always concerted with the French embassador. Vol. i. p. 439.</NOTE>, prove beyond a doubt, that the
King had at this time concerted measures with France,
and had no intention to enter into a war in favour of the
allies. He had entertained no view, therefore, even
when he pawned his ROYÁL WORD to his people, than
to procure a grant of money; and he trusted, that,
while he eluded their expectations, he could not after∣wards
want pretences for palliating his conduct.</P>
<P>NEGOTIATIONS mean while were carried on between
France and Holland, and an eventual treaty was con∣cluded;
that is, all their differences were adjusted, pro∣vided
they could afterwards satisfy their allies on both
sides. But this work, though in appearance difficult,
<PB N="32" REF="42"/>
seemed to be extremely forwarded, by farther bad suc∣cesses
on the part of the confederates, and by the
great impatience of the Hollanders; when a new
event happened, which promised a more prosperous issue
to the quarrel with France, and revived extremely the
hopes of all the English who understood the interests of
their country.</P>
<P>THE King saw, with regret, the violent discon∣tents,
which prevailed in the nation, and which seemed
every day to augment upon him. Strongly desirous by
his natural temper to be easy himself, and to make every
body else easy, he sought expedients to appease those
murmurs, which, as they were very disagreeable for the pre∣sent,
might in their consequences prove extremely dan∣gerous.
He knew, that, during the late war with Hol∣land,
the malecontents at home had made applications to the
prince of Orange; and if he continued still to neglect
the prince's interests, and to thwart the inclinations of
his people, he apprehended lest their common complaints
should cement a lasting union between them. He saw
that the religion of the Duke inspired the nation with
very dismal apprehensions; and though he had obliged
his brother to allow the young princesses to be educated
in the protestant faith, something farther, he thought,
was requisite, in order to satisfy the nation. He enter∣tained
therefore proposals for marrying the prince to the
lady Mary, the eldest princess, and heir apparent to the
crown (for the duke had no male issue.) And he hoped;
by so tempting an offer, to engage him entirely in his
interests. A peace he proposed to make; such as would
satisfy France, and still preserve his connexions with that
crown: And he intended to sanctify it by the approba∣tion
of the prince, whom he found to be extremely re∣vered
in England, and respected throughout all Europe▪
All the reasons for this alliance were seconded by the
sollicitations of Danby, and also of Temple, who was
<PB N="33" REF="43"/>
at the time in England: And Charles at last granted
permission to the prince, when the campaign should be
over, to pay him a visit.</P>
<P>THE King Very graciously received his nephew at<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of Oc∣tober.</NOTE>
Newmarket. He would have entered immediately upon
business; but the prince desired first to be acquainted
with the lady Mary: And he declared, that, contrary
to the usual sentiments of persons of his rank, he placed
a great part of happiness in domestic satisfaction, and
would not, upon any consideration of interest or poli∣tics,
match himself with a person disagreeable to him.
He was introduced to the princess, whom he found in
the bloom of youth, and extremely amiable both in her
person and her humour. The King now thought, that
he had a double tye upon him, and might safely make
account of his compliance with every proposal: He was
surprized to find the prince decline all discourse of busi∣ness,
and refuse to concert any terms for the general
peace, till his marriage should be finished. He well fore∣saw,
he said, from the situation of affairs, that his allies
were likely to have hard terms; and he never would ex∣pose
himself to the reproach of having sacrificed their in∣terests
to promote his own purposes. Charles still be∣lieved;
notwithstanding the cold, severe manner of the
prince, that he would abate of this rigid punctilio of ho∣nour;
and he protracted the time, hoping by his own
insinuation and address, as well as by the allurements of
love and ambition, to win him to compliance. One day,
Temple found the prince in very bad humour, repent∣ing
that he had ever come to England, and resolute in a
few days to leave it. But before he went, the King, he
said, must chuse the terms, on which they should here∣after
live together: He was sure it must be like the
greates;t friends or the greatest enemies: And he desired
Temple to inform his Master next morning of these in∣tentions.
Charles was struck with his menace, and
<PB N="34" REF="44"/>
foresaw how the prince's departure would be interpreted
by the people. He resolved, therefore, immediately to
yield with a good grace; and having paid a compliment
to his nephew's honesty, he told Temple, that the mar∣riage
was concluded, and desired him to, inform the
Duke of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of Octo∣ber.</NOTE> as of an affair already resolved on. The duke
seemed surprized;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the prince of Orange with the lady Mary.</NOTE> but yielded a prompt obedience:
Which, he said, was his constant maxim to whatever
he found to be the King's pleasure. No measure during
this reign gave such general satisfaction. All parties
strove who should most applaud it. And even Arlington,
who had been kept out of the secret, told the prince,
“ That some things, good in themselves, were spoiled
by the manner of doing them, as some things bad
were mended by it; but he would confess, that this
was a thing so good in itself, that the manner of do∣ing
it could not spoil it.”</P>
<P>THIS marriage was a great surprize to Lewis, who,
being accustomed to govern every thing in the English
Court, now found so important a step taken, not only
without his consent, but without his knowlege or parti∣cipation.
A conjunction of England with the allies, and
a vigorous war in opposition to French ambition, were
the consequences immediately expected, both abroad and
at home: But to check these sanguine expectations, the
King, a few days after the marriage, prolonged the ad∣journment
of the Parliament from the third of Decem∣ber
to the fourth of April. This term was too late for
granting supplies, or making preparations for war; and
could be chosen by the King for no other reason, but as
an atonement to France for his consent to the marriage.</P>
<P>THE King, however, entered into consultations with
the prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plan of peace.</NOTE> together with Danby and Temple, con∣cerning
the terms which it would be proper to require
of France. After some debate, it was agreed, that
France should restore Lorrain to the Duke; with Tour∣nay,
<PB N="35" REF="45"/>
Valenciennes, Condé, Aeth, Charleroi, Courtray,
Oudenarde, and Binche to Spain, in order to form a
good frontier for Flanders. The prince insisted much,
that Franchecomté should likewise be restored; and
Charles thought, that because he had patrimonial estates
of great value in that province, and deemed his property
more secure in the hands of Spain, he was engaged by
such views to be obstinate in that point: But the prince
very generously declared, that to procure but one good
town to the Spaniards in Flanders, he would willingly
abandon all those possessions. As the King still insisted
on the impossibility of wresting Franchecomté from
Lewis, the prince was obliged to submit.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this concession to France, the
projected peace was favourable to the allies; and it was
a sufficient indication of vigour in the King, that he had
given his assent to it. He farther agreed to send over a
minister instantly to Paris, in order to propose these
terms. This minister was to enter into no treaty:
He was to allow but two days for the acceptance or re∣fusal
of the terms: Upon the expiration, of these, he was
immediately to return: And in case of refusal, the King
promised immediately to enter into the confederacy. To
carry so imperious a message, and so little expected from
the English Court, Temple was the person pitched on,
whose declared aversion to the French interest was not
likely to make him fail of vigour and promptitude in the
execution of has commission.</P>
<P>BUT Charles next day felt a relenting in this assumed
vigour. Instead of Temple he dispatched the carl of Fe∣versham,
a creature of the Duke's, and a Frenchman by
birth: And he said, that the message being harsh in it∣self,
it was needless to aggravate it by a disagreeable
messenger. The prince left London; and the King;
at his departure, assured him, that he never would
abate in the least point of the scheme concerted,
<PB N="36" REF="46"/>
and would enter into war with Lewis, if he refused
it.</P>
<P>LEWIS received the message with seeming gentleness
and complacency.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotia∣tions.</NOTE> He told Feversham, that the King of
England well knew, that he might always be master of
the peace; but some of the towns in Flanders, it seemed
very hard to demand, especially Tournay, upon whose
fortifications such immense sums had been expended:
He would therefore take some short time to consider of
an answer. Feversham said, that he was limited to two
days stay: But when that time was elapsed, he was pre∣vailed
with to stay some few days longer; and he came
away at last without any positive answer. Lewis said,
that he hoped his brother would not break with him for
one or two towns: And with regard to them too, he
would send orders to his ambassador at London to treat
with the King himself. Charles was softened by the
softness of France; and the blow was thus artfully
eluded. The French ambassador, Barillon, owned, at
last, that he had orders to yield all except Tournay, and
even to treat about some equivalent for that fortress, if
the King absolutely insisted upon it. The prince was
gone, who had given spirit to the English Court; and
the negotiation began to draw out into messages and re∣turns
from Paris.</P>
<P>BY intervals, however, the King could rouze himself,
and show still some firmness and resolution. Finding that
affairs were not likely to come to any conclusion with
France, the Parliament, notwithstanding the long ad∣journment,
was assembled on the fifteenth of January;
a very unusual measure, and capable of giving alarm to
the French Court. Temple was sent for to the coun∣cil,
and the King told him, that he intended he should
go to Holland, in order to form a treaty of alliance with
the States; and that the purposes of it should be, like
the triple league, to force both France and Spain to ac∣cept
<PB N="37" REF="47"/>
of the terms proposed. Temple was sorry to find
this act of vigour qualified by such a regard to France,
and by such an appearance of indifference and neutra∣lity
between the parties. He told the King, that the re∣solution
agreed on, was to begin the war in conjunc∣tion
with all the confederates, in case of no direct and
immediate answer from France: That this measure
would satisfy the prince, the allies, and the people of
England; advantages which could not be expected from
such an alliance with Holland alone: That France
would be disobliged, and Spain likewise; nor would
the Dutch be satisfied with such a faint imitation of the
triple league, a measure concerted when they were
equally at peace with both parties. For these reasons,
Temple declined the employment; and Laurence Hyde,
second son to chancellor Clarendon, was sent in his
place.</P>
<P>THE prince of Orange was surprized to observe such
symptoms of weakness and vigour conjoined in the English
councils.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1678.</NOTE> He was resolved, however, to make the best of
a measure, which he did not approve; and as Spain se∣cretly
consented, that her ally should form a league,
which was seemingly directed against her as well as
France, but which was to fall only on the latter, the
States concluded the treaty in the terms proposed by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Ja∣nuary.</NOTE>
King.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the English Parliament met, after some
new delays;<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of Ja∣nuary.</NOTE> and the King was astonished, that, not∣withstanding
all the resolute measures, which, he
thought, he had taken, great distrust and jealousy and
discontent were apt, at intervals, still to prevail among
the members. Though in his speech he had allowed,
that a good peace could no longer be expected from ne∣gotiation,
and assured them, that he was resolved to en∣ter
into war for that purpose; the Commons did not for∣bear
to insert in their reply several very harsh and even
<PB N="36" REF="48"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="37" REF="49"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="38" REF="50"/>
unreasonable clauses. Upon his reproving them, they
seemed penitent, and voted, that they would assist his Ma∣jesty
in the prosecution of the war. A fleet of ninety
sail, an army of thirty thousand men, and a million of
money were also voted. Great difficulties were made by
the Commons with regard to the army, which the
House, judging by past measures, believed to be intended
more against the liberties of England than against the
progress of the French Monarch. To this perilous situ∣ation
had the King reduced both himself and the nation.
In all debates, severe speeches were made, and were re∣ceived
with a seeming approbation: The Duke and the
treasurer began to be apprehensive of impeachments:
Many motions against the King's ministers were lost by
a very small majority: The Commons appointed a day
to consider the state of the kingdom with regard to po∣pery:
And they even went so far as to vote, that, how
urgent soever the occasion, they would lay no farther
charge on the people, till secured against the prevalence
of the catholic party. In short, the Parliament were
impatient for war whenever the King seemed averse to
it; but grew suspicious of some sinister design so soon as
he complied with their requests, and seemed to enter
into their measures.</P>
<P>THE King was enraged at this last vote: He reproach∣ed
Temple with his popular notions, as he termed them;
and asked him how he thought the House of Commons
could be trusted for carrying on the war, should it be en∣tered
on, when in the very commencement they made
such declarations. The uncertainties indeed of Charles's
conduct were so multiplied, and the jealousies on both
sides so incurable, that even those who approached
nearest the scene of action could not determine, whe∣ther
the King ever seriously meant to enter into war, or
whether, if he did, the House of Commons would
not have taken advantage of his nccessities, and
<PB N="39" REF="51"/>
made him purchase supplies by a great sacrifice of his
authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. I. p. 461.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of France knew how to avail himself of
all the advantages, which these distractons afforded him.
By his emissaries, he represented to the Dutch, the un∣certainty
of their dependance on England; where an in∣dolent
King, averse to all war, especially with France,
and irresolute in his measures, was actuated only by the
uncertain breath of a factious Parliament. To the aristo∣cratic
faction, he remarked the danger of the Prince's
alliance with the Royal Family of England, and revived
their apprehensions, lest, in imitation of his father, who
had been honoured with the same alliance, he should vio∣lently
attempt to enlarge his authority, and enslave his
native country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1678.</NOTE> In order to second these motives with
some farther terrors, he himself took the field very early
in the spring; and after threatning Luxembourg, Mons,
and Namur, he sat down suddenly before Ghent and
Ypres, and in a few weeks made himself master of both
places. This success gave great alarm to the Hollanders,
who were no wise satisfied with the conduct of England,
or with the ambiguous treaty lately concluded; and it
quickened all their paces towards an accommodation.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after the Parliament had voted the
supply, the King began to inlist forces; and such was
the ardour of the English for a war with France, that an
army of above 20,000 men, to the astonishment of all
Europe, were compleated in a few weeks. Three thou∣sand
men, under the duke of Monmouth, were sent
over to secure Ostend: Some regiments were recalled
from the French service: A fleet was fitted out with
great diligence: And a quadruple alliance was projected
between England, Holland, Spain, and the Emperor.</P>
<P>BUT these vigorous measures received a sudden damp
from a passionate address of the lower House; in which
<PB N="40" REF="52"/>
they justified all their past proceedings, that had given
disgust to the King; desired to be acquainted with the
measures taken by him; prayed him to dismiss evil
counsellors; and named in particular the duke of Lau∣derdale,
on whose removal they strenuously insisted.
The King told them, that their address was so extrava∣gant,
that he was not willing speedily to give it the an∣swer,
which it deserved. And he began again to lend
an ear to the proposals of France, who offered him great
sums of money, if he would consent to their making an,
advantageous peace with the allies.</P>
<P>TEMPLE, though pressed by the King, refused to
have any concern in so dishonourable a negotia∣tion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiations.</NOTE> But
he informs us, that the King said, there was one arti∣cle
proposed, which so incensed him, that, as long as he
lived, he would never forget it. Sir William goes no
farther; but the editor of his works, the famous Dr.
Swift, says, that the French, before they would agree
to any payment, required as a preliminary, that the King
should engage never to keep above 8000 regular troops in
his three kingdoms. Charles broke into a passion.
“ Cod's-fish,” said he, his usual oath, “ Does my
brother of France think to serve me thus? Are all his
promises to make me absolute master of my people
come to this? Or does he think <HI>that</HI> a thing to be
done with eight thousand men?”</P>
<P>VAN BEVERNING was the Dutch ambassador at Ni∣meguen,
a man of great authority with the States. He
was very eager for peace, and was perswaded, that the
reluctance of the King and the jealousies of the Parlia∣ment
would for ever disappoint the allies in their hopes of
succour from England. Orders were sent him by the
States to go to the French King at Ghent, and concert
the terms of a general treaty, as well as procure a pre∣sent
truce for six weeks. The terms agreed on were
much worse for the Spaniards, than those planned by
<PB N="41" REF="53"/>
the King and the Prince of Orange. Six towns, some
of them of no great importance, were to be restored to
them: But Ypres, Condé, Valenciennes, and Tour∣nay,
in which consisted the chief strength of their fron∣tier,
were to remain with France.</P>
<P>GREAT murmurs arose in England when it was
known, that Flanders was to be left in so defenceless a
condition. The chief complaints were levelled against
the King, who, by his concurrence at first, by his favour
afterwards, and by his delays at last, had raised the
power of France to such an enormous height, that it
threatened the general liberties of Europe. Charles,
uneasy under these imputations, dreading the conse∣quence
of losing the affections of his subjects, and per∣haps
disgusted with the secret article proposed by France,
began to wish heartily for war, which, he hoped, would
have restored him to his antient popularity.</P>
<P>AN opportunity very unexpectedly offered itself for his
displaying these new dispositions. While the ambassa∣dors
at Nimeguen were concerting the terms of a gene∣ral
treaty, the marquis de Balbaces, the Spanish ambassa∣dor,
asked the ambassadors of France, at what time
France intended to restore the six towns in Flanders.
They made no difficulty of declaring, that the King,
their master, being obliged to see an entire restitution
made to the Swedes of all they had lost in the war,
could not evacuate these towns, till that Crown had re∣ceived
satisfaction; and that this detention of places
was the only means to induce the Princes of the North
to accept of the peace.</P>
<P>THE States immediately gave the King intelligence of
a pretension, which might be attended with such dange∣rous
consequences. The king was both surprized and
angry. He immediately dispatched Temple to concert
with the States vigorous measures for opposing France.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of July.</NOTE>
Temple in six days concluded a treaty, by which Lewis
<PB N="42" REF="54"/>
was obliged to declare within sixteen after the date, that
he would presently evacuate the towns: And in case of
his refusal, Holland was engaged to continue the war,
and England immediately to declare against France, in
conjunction with the whole confederacy.</P>
<P>ALL these warlike measures were so little seconded by
the Parliament, where even the French ministers were
suspected of carrying on some intrigues, that the Com∣mons
renewed their former jealousies against the King,
and voted the army immediately to be disbanded. The
King by a message represented the danger of disarming
before peace was concluded; and he recommended to
their consideration, whether he could honourably recall
his forces from those towns in Flanders, which had put
themselves under his protection, and which had at pre∣sent
no other means of defence. The Commons agreed
to prolong the term with regard to these forces. Every
thing indeed in Europe wore the appearance of war.
France had positively declared, that she would not eva∣cuate
the towns before the requisite cession was made
to Sweden; and her honour seemed now engaged to sup∣port
that declaration. Spain and the Empire, extremely
disgusted with the terms of peace, imposed by Holland,
saw with pleasure the prospect of a powerful support from
the new resolutions of Charles. Holland itself, encou∣raged
by the Prince of Orange and his party, was not
displeased to find that the war would be renewed on more
equal terms. The allied army under that Prince was ap∣proaching
towards Mons, then blockaded by France. A
considerable body of English forces under the duke of
Monmouth, were ready to join him.</P>
<P>CHARLES usually passed a great part of his time in the
women's apartments, particularly those of the dutchess
of Portsmouth; where, among other gay company, he
often met with Barillon, the French ambassador, a man of
polite conversation, who was admitted into all the amuse∣ments
<PB N="43" REF="55"/>
of that inglorious, but agreeable monarch. It was
the charms of this sauntering easy life, which, during the
latter part of his life, attached Charles to his mistresses.
By the insinuations of Barillon and the dutchess of Ports∣mouth,
an order was, in an unguarded hour, procured,
which instantly changed the face of affairs in Europe.
One du Cros, a French fugitive monk, was sent to
Temple, directing him to apply to the Swedish ambassa∣dor,
and perswade him not to insist on the conditions re∣quired
by France, but to sacrifice to general peace those
interests of Sweden. Du Cros, who had secretly re∣ceived
instructions from Barillon, published every where
in Holland the commission, with which he was intrusted;
and all men took, the alarm. It was concluded, that
Charles's sudden alacrity for war was as suddenly extin∣guished,
and that no steady measures could ever be taken
with England. The King afterwards, when he saw Tem∣ple,
treated this important matter in raillery; and said
laughing, that the rogue du Cros had outwitted them
all.</P>
<P>THE negotiations however at Nimeguen still conti∣nued;
and the French ambassadors spun out the time, till
the morning of the fatal day, which, by the late treaty
between England and Holland, was to determine, whe∣ther
a sudden peace or a long war was to have place in
Christendom. The French ambassadors came then to
Van Beverning, and told him, that they had received or∣ders
to consent to the evacuation of the towns, and im∣mediately
to conclude and sign the peace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of Au∣gust.</NOTE> Van Bevern∣ing
might have refused compliance, because it was now
impossible to procure the consent and concurrence of
Spain; but he had entertained so just an idea of the fluc∣tuations
in the English councils, and was so much alarm∣ed
by the late commission given to du Cros, that he
deemed it fortunate for the Republic to conclude on any
terms a dangerous war where they were likely to be
<PB N="44" REF="56" MS="y"/>
very ill supported. The papers were instantly drawn up,
and signed by the ministers of France and Holland be∣tween
eleven and twelve a clock at night. By this treaty,
France secured the possession of Franchecomté, together
with Cambray, Aire, St. Omer, Valenciennes, Tour∣nay,
Ypres, Bouchaine, Cassel, &amp;c. and restored to
Spain only Charleroi, Courtrai, Oudenard, Aeth, Ghent,
and Limbourg.</P>
<P>NEXT day Temple received an express from England,
which brought the ratifications of the treaty lately con∣cluded
with the States, with orders immediately to pro∣ceed
to the exchange of them. Charles was now returned
to his former inclinations for war with France.</P>
<P>VAN BEVERNING was loudly exclaimed against by the
ambassadors of the allies at Nimeguen, especially those of
Brandenburg arid Denmark, whose masters were obliged
by the treaty to restore all their acquisitions. The mini∣sters
of Spain and the Emperor were fullen and dis∣gusted;
and all men hoped, that the States, importuned
and encouraged by continual sollicitations from England,
would disavow their ambassador, and renew the war. The
Prince of Orange even took a very extraordinary step,
in order to engage them to that measure; or perhaps to
give vent to his own spleen and resentment. The day
after signing the peace at Nimeguen, he attacked the
French army at St. Dennis hear Mons; and gained some
advantage over Luxembourg, who rested secure on the
faith of the treaty, and concluded the war to be finished.
The Prince knew, at least had reason to believe, that
the peace was signed, though it had not been formally
notified to him; and he here sacrificed wantonly, with∣out
a proper motive, the lives of many brave men on
both sides, who fell in this sharp and well contested
action.</P>
<P>HYDE was sent over with a view of perswading the
States to disavow Van Beverning; and the King pro∣mised,
<PB N="45" REF="57"/>
that England, if she might depend on Holland,
would immediately declare war, and would pursue it,
till France was reduced to reasonable conditions. Charles
at present went farther than words. He hurried on the
embarkation of his army for Flanders, and all his prepa∣rations
wore a hostile appearance. But the States had
been too often deceived to trust him any longer. They
ratified the treaty signed at Nimeguen; and all the other
Powers of Europe were at last,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Nimeguen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> after much clamour and
many disgusts, obliged to accept of the terms prescribed
to them.</P>
<P>LEWIS had now reached the height of that glory,
which ambition can afford. His ministers and negotia∣tors
appeared as much superior to those of all Europe in
the cabinet, as his generals and armies had been expe∣rienced
in the field. A successful war had been carried
on against an alliance, composed of the greatest Poten∣tates
in Europe. Considerable conquests had been made,
and his territories enlarged on every side. An advanta∣geous
peace was at last concluded, where he had given
the law. The allies were so enraged against each other,
that they were not likely to cement soon in any new
confederacy. And thus he had, during some years, a
real and near prospect of attaining the Monarchy of Eu∣rope,
and of exceeding the Empire of Charlemagne, per∣haps
equalling that of antient Rome. Had England con∣tinued
much longer in the same condition, and under the
same government, it is not easy to conceive, that he
could have failed of his purpose.</P>
<P>IN proportion as these circumstances exalted the
French, they excited indignation among the English,
whose animosity, rouzed by terror, mounted to a great
height against that rival nation. Instead of taking the
lead in the affairs of Europe, Charles, they thought, had,
contrary to his own honour and interest, acted a part
entirely subservient to the common enemy, and in all his
<PB N="46" REF="58"/>
sures had either no project at all, or such as was highly,
criminal and dangerous. While Spain, Holland, the
Emperor, the Princes of Germany called aloud on Eng∣land
to lead them to victory and to liberty, and con∣spired
to raise her to a station more glorious than she had
ever before attained; her King, from mean pecuniary
views, had secretly sold his alliance to Lewis, and was
bribed into an interest contrary to that of his people.
His active schemes in conjunction with France were
highly pernicious; his neutrality was equally ignomini∣ous;
and the jealous, refractory behaviour of the Parlia∣ment,
though in itself dangerous, was the only remedy
for so many greater ills, with which the public, from the
misguided councils of the King, was so nearly threaten∣ed.
Such were the dispositions of men's minds at the
conclusion of the Peace of Nimeguen: And these dispo∣sitions
very naturally prepared the way for the events
which followed.</P>
<P>WE must now return to the affairs of Scotland; which
we left in some disorder, after the suppression of the in∣surrection
in 1666. The King, who at that time en∣deavoured
to render himself popular in England, adopt∣ed
like measures in Scotland, and he entrusted the go∣vernment
chiefly into the hands of Tweddale, and Sir
Robert Murray, men of prudence and moderation. These
ministers made it their principal, occupation to compose
the religious differences, which ran very high, and for
which scarce any modern nation but the Dutch, had as
yet found out the proper remedy. As rigour and re∣straint
had failed in Scotland, a scheme of <HI>comprehension</HI>
was tried; by which it was proposed to diminish greatly
the authority of bishops, to abolish their negative voice
in the ecclesiastical courts, and to leave them little more
than the right of precedency among the presbyters. But
the zealots entertained great jealousy against this scheme,
They remembered, that it was by such gradual steps,
<PB N="47" REF="59"/>
that King James endeavoured to introduce episcopacy.
Should the ears and eyes of men be once reconciled to the
name and habit of bishops, the whole power of the func∣tion,
they dreaded, would soon follow: The least com∣munication
with unlawful and antichristian institutions
they esteemed dangerous and criminal: <HI>Touch not, taste
not, handle not;</HI> this cry went out amongst them: And
the King's ministers at last perceived that they should
prostitute the dignity of government, by making ad∣vances,
to which the malecontents were determined not
not to correspond.</P>
<P>THE next project adopted was that of <HI>indulgence.</HI> In
prosecution of this scheme, the most popular of the ex∣pelled
preachers, without requiring any terms of sub∣mission
to the established religion, were settled in vacant
churches; and small salaries of about twenty pounds a
year were offered to the rest, till they should otherwise be
provided for. These last refused the King's bounty,
which they considered as the wages of a criminal silence.
Even the former soon repented their compliance. The
people, who had been accustomed to hear them rail
against their superiors, and preach to the times, as they
called it, deemed their sermons languid and spiritless,
when deprived of these ornaments. Their usual gifts,
they thought, had left them, on account of their sub∣mission,
which was stigmatized as erastianism. They
gave them the appellation, not of ministers of Christ, but
of <HI>the King's curates;</HI> as the clergy of the established
church were commonly denominated the <HI>bishops cutates.</HI>
The preachers themselves returned in a little time to
their former practices, by which they hoped to regain
their former dominion over the minds of men; a supe∣riority,
which no one, who has ever possessed it, will
willingly, by any consideration, be prevailed on to re∣linquish.
The conventicles, multiplied daily in the West:
The clergy of the established church were insulted:
<PB N="48" REF="60"/>
The laws were neglected: The Covenanters even met
daily in arms at their places of worship: And though
they usually dispersed themselves after religious service,
yet the government took a just alarm at seeing men,
who were so entirely governed by their seditious teachers;
dare to set authority at defiance, and during a time of
full peace, to put themselves in a military posture.</P>
<P>THERE was here, it is apparent, in the political body,
a disease very dangerous and inveterate; and the govern∣ment
had tried every remedy, but the true one, to allay
and correct it. An unlimited toleration, after sects have
diffused themselves and are strongly rooted, is the only
expedient, which can allay their fervour, and make the
civil union acquire a superiority above religious distinc∣tions.
But as the operations of this regimen are com∣monly
very gradual, and at first imperceptible, vulgar
politicians are apt, for that reason, to have recourse to
more hasty and more dangerous remedies. It is observ∣able
too, that these non-conformists in Scotland neither
offered nor demanded toleration; but laid claim to an
entire superiority, and to the exercise of extreme rigour
against their adversaries. The covenant, which they ido∣lized,
was a persecuting, as well as a seditious band of
confederacy: and the government, instead of treating
them like madmen, who should be soothed, and flatter∣ed,
and deceived into tranquillity, thought themselves in∣titled
to a rigid obedience, and were too apt, from a mis∣taken
policy, to retaliate upon the dissenters, who had
erred from the spirit of enthusiasm.</P>
<P>Amidst these disturbances, a new parliament was assem∣bled
at Edinburgh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">19th of October, 1669.</NOTE>; and Lauderdale was sent down com∣missioner.
The zealous presbyterians, who were the
chief patrons of liberty, were too obnoxious to resist the
measures of the government; and the tyde still ran
strong in favour of monarchy. The commissioner had
<PB N="49" REF="61"/>
such influence as to get two acts passed, which were of
the utmost consequence to the civil and eccsesiastical li∣berties
of the kingdom. By the one, it was declared,
that the settling all things with regard to the external
government of the church was a right of the crown:
That whatever related to ecclesiastical meetings, mat∣ters,
and persons, were to be ordered, according to such
directions as the King should send to his Privy Council:
And that these, being published by them, should have
the force of laws. The other act regarded the militia,
which the King by his own authority had two years be∣fore
established, In place of the army which was broke.
By this act, the militia was settled to the number of
22000 men, who were to be constantly armed, and re∣gularly
disciplined. And it was farther enacted, that
these troops should be held in readiness to march into
England, Ireland, or any part of the King's dominions,
for any cause in which his Majesty's authority, power,
for greatness was concerned; on receiving orders not
from the King, but the Privy Council of Scotland.</P>
<P>LAUDERDALE boasted extremely of his services in
procuring these two laws: The King by the former
was rendered absolute master of the church, and might
legally, even by an edict, re-establish, if he thought pro∣per,
the Catholic religion in Scotland: By the latter,
he saw a powerful force ready at his call: He had even
the advantage of being able to disguise his orders under the name of the Privy Council; and in case of failure
in his enterprises, could, by such a pretence, apologize
for his Conduct to the English parliament. But <HI>in</HI> pro∣portion
as these laws were agreeable to the King, they
gave alarm to the English Commons, and were the chief
cause of those redoubled attacks, which they made upon
Lauderdale. these attacks, however, served only to for∣tify
him in his interest with the King; and tho' it is pro∣bable,
that the Scots militia, during the divided state of
<PB N="48" REF="62"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="49" REF="63"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="50" REF="64"/>
that kingdom, would, if matters had come to extremity,
have been of very little service against England; yet
did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> regard the credit of it as a considerable sup∣port
to his authority: And Lauderdale, by degrees, be∣came
the prime or rather sole minister for Scotland.
The natural indolence of the King disposed him to give
entire confidence to a man, who had so far extended the
royal Prerogative, and who was still disposed to render
it absolutely uncontroulable.</P>
<P>IN a subsequent session of the same Parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">28th of July, 1670.</NOTE>, a
severe law was enacted against conventicles. Ruinous
fines were imposed both on the preachers and hearers,
even if the meetings had been in houses; but field con∣venticles
were subjected to the penalty of death and con∣fiscation
of goods: Four hundred marks Scots were
offered as a reward to those who should seize the crimi∣nals;
and they were indemnified for any slaughter,
which they should commit in the execution of such an
undertaking. And as it was found difficult to get evi∣dence
against these conventicles, however numerous,
it was enacted by another law, that, whoever, being
required by the Council, refused to give information
upon oath,, should be punished by arbitrary fines, by
imprisonment, or by banishment to the plantations.
Thus all persecution naturally, or rather necessarily,
adopts the iniquities, as well as rigors, of the inquisi∣tion.
What a considerable part of the society consider
as their duty and honour, and the others are apt to re∣gard
with compassion and indulgence, can by no other
expedient be subjected to such severe penalties as the na∣tural
sentiments of mankind appropriate only to the
greatest crimes.</P>
<P>THO' Lauderdale found this ready compliance in the
Parliament, a party was formed against him, of which
duke Hamilton was the head, Next session<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">16th of June, 1673.</NOTE>, this party
<PB N="51" REF="65"/>
had become considerable: And many were disgusted,
as well with Lauderdale's insolence, as with the
grievances, under which the nation laboured. The first
Parliament of this reign had acknowleged, that the
regulation of all foreign trade was an inherent branch
of royal prerogative. In consequence of this impor∣tant
concession, the King, by an act of council, had
prohibited the importation of brandy and all spirits; and
the execution of this edict was committed to lord El∣phinstone,
a relation of Lauderdale's. Elphinstone
made no other use of this power than to sell licences to
the merchants, by which expedient he gained great sums
to himself, tho' to the loss of the revenue, as well as of
the kingdom. A monopoly of salt had also been
granted to lord Kincardine; and a new imposition on
tobacco had been bestowed in gift upon Sir John Ni∣colson,
for the benefit of himself and some friends of
Lauderdale. When these grievances were complained
of, the commissioner, who was desirous to prevent all
parliamentary enquiry, chose rather to redress them in
council; and he accordingly cancelled the three patents
complained of. But as farther grievances were men∣tioned,
and a general representation of the state of
the kingdom was proposed to be made by Parliament:
Lauderdale opposed, as a barrier, the Lords of Articles,
without whose consent, he said, no motion could be re∣ceived.
Men were now convinced of their imprudence
in restoring that institution, which rendered all national
assemblies in a manner useless for the redress of grie∣vances.</P>
<P>HAMILTON, Tweddale, and others went to London,
and applied to the King, who was alone able to correct
the abuses of Lauderdale's administration. But even
their complaints to him might be dangerous; and all
approaches of truth to the Throne were barred by the
ridiculous law against leasing-making; a law, which seems
<PB N="52" REF="66"/>
have been extorted by the antient nobles, in order to
protect their own tyranny, oppression, and injustice. Great
precautions, therefore, were used by the Scots malecon∣tents
in their representations to the King; but no redress
was obtained. Charles loaded them with caresses, and
continued Lauderdale in his authority.</P>
<P>A VERY bad, at least a severe use was made of this au∣thority.
The Privy Council dispossessed twelve gentle∣men
or noblemen of their houses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1675.</NOTE>; and these houses
were converted, into so many garrisons, established for
the suppression of conventicles. The nation, it was
pretended, was really, on account of these religious as∣semblies,
in a state of war; and by the antient law, the
King, in such an emergence, was empowered to place a
garrison in any house, where he should judge it ex∣pedient.</P>
<P>IT were endless to recount every act of violence and ar∣bitrary
authority exercised during Lauderdale's adminis∣tration.
All the lawyers were put from the bar, nay,
banished by the King's order twelve miles from Edin∣burgh,
and by that means the whole justice of the king∣dom
was suspended for a year; till these lawyers were
brought to declare it as their opinion, that all appeals to
Parliament were illegal. A letter was procured from
the King, for turning out twelve of the chief magis∣trates
of Edinburgh, and declaring them incapable of
all public office; tho' their only crime had been their
want of compliance with Lauderdale. The burroughs
of Scotland have a privilege of meeting once a year by
their deputies, in order to consider the state of trade,
and make bye-laws for its regulation: In this conven∣tion
a petition was voted, complaining of some late laws,
which obstructed commerce, and praying the King, that
he would impower his commissioner, in the next session of
Parliament, to give his assent to the repealing them. For
<PB N="53" REF="67"/>
this presumption, as it was called, several of the members
were fined and imprisoned. One More, a member of
Parliament, having moved in the house, that, in imi∣tation
of the English Parliament, no bill▪ should pass
except after three readings, he was for this pretended
offence immediately sent to prison by the commissioner▪</P>
<P>THE private deportment of Lauderdale was as insolent
and provoking as his public administration was violent
and tyrannical. Justice likewise was universally per∣verted
by faction and interest: And from the great ra∣pacity
of that duke, and still more of his dutchess, all
offices and favours were openly put to sale. No-one
was allowed to approach the Throne who was not de∣pendant
on him; and no remedy could be hoped for or
obtained against his manifold oppressions. The case of
Mitchel shows, that this mintister was as much devoid
of truth and honour as of lenity and justice.</P>
<P>MITCHEL was a desperate <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anatic, and had entertained▪
a resolution of assassinating Sharpe, archbishop of St.
Andrews, who, by his former apostacy and subsequent
rigour, had rendered himself extremely odious to all men,
especially to the Covenanters. In the year 1668,
Mitchel fired a pistol at the primate, as he was sitting in
his coach; but the bishop of Orkney, stepping into the
coach, happened to stretch out his arm, which intercepted
the ball, and was much shattered by it. This happened
in the principal street of the city; but so generally was
the archbishop detested, that the assassin was allowed peace∣ably
to walk off; and having turned a street or two,
and thrown off a wig, which disguised him, he imme∣diately
appeared in public, and remained altogether un∣suspected.
Some years afterwards, Sharpe remarked a
man, who seemed to eye him very eagerly; and being
still anxious, lest an attempt of assassination should be
renewed, he ordered him to be seized and examined.
Two loaded pistols were found upon him; and as he
<PB N="54" REF="68"/>
was now concluded to be the author of the former at∣tempt,
Sharpe promised, that if he would confess his
guilt, he should be dismissed without any punishment.
Mitchel was so credulous as to believe him; but was
immediately produced before the council by the faithless
primate. The council, having no proof against him,
but hoping to involve the whole body of Cove∣nanters
in this odious crime, very solemnly renewed
the promise of pardon, if he would make a full disco∣very;
and it was a great disappointment to them, when
they found, upon his confession, that only one person,
who was now dead, had been acquainted with his bloody
resolutions. Mitchel was next carried before a court of
judicature, and required to renew his confession; but be∣ing
apprehensive, that, tho' a pardon for life had been
promised him, other corporal punishments might still be
inflicted, he refused compliance; and was sent back to
prison. He was next examined before the council, un∣der
pretence of his being concerned in the insurrection
at Pentland; and tho' no proof appeared against him,
he was put to the question, and contrary to the most ob∣vious
principles of equity, was urged to accuse himself.
He endured the torture with singular resolution, and
continued obstinate in the denial of a crime, of which,
it is believed, he really was not guilty. Instead of ob∣taining
his liberty, he was sent to the Bass, a very high
rock, surrounded by the sea; at this time converted into\
a state prison, and full of the unhappy Covenanters.
He there remained in great misery, loaded with irons;
till the year 1677, when it was resolved by some new
examples to strike a fresh terror into the persecuted, but
still obstinate enthusiasts▪ Mitchel was then brought
before a court of judicature, and put upon his trial, for
an attempt to assassinate an archbishop and a privy coun∣sellor.
His former confession was pleaded against him,
and was proved by the testimony of the duke of Lauder∣dales
<PB N="55" REF="69"/>
lord commissioner, lord Hatton his brother, de∣puty
treasurer, the earl of Rothes, chancellor, and the
primate himself. Mitchel, besides maintaining that the
Privy Council was no court of judicature, and that a
confession before them was not judicial, asserted, that
he had been engaged to make that confession by a so∣lemn
promise of pardon which had been given him.
The four privy counsellors denied upon oath, that any
such promise had ever been given. The prisoner then
desired, that the council books might be produced in
court; and even offered a copy of that day's proceedings
to be read; but the Privy Counsellors maintained, that,
after they had made oath, no farther proof could be ad∣mitted,
and that the books of Privy Council contained
the King's secrets, which were on no account to be di∣vulged.
They were not probably aware, when they
swore, that the clerk having engrossed the promise of
pardon in the narrative of Mitchel's confession, the
whole minute had been signed by the chancellor, and
that the proofs of their perjury were by that means
committed to record. Tho' the prisoner was condemned,
Lauderdale was still inclined to pardon him; but the un∣relenting
primate rigorously insisted upon his execution,
and said, that, if assassins remained unpunished, his life
must be exposed to perpetual danger. Mitchel was ac∣cordingly
executed at Edinburgh in January 1678.
Such a complication of cruelty and treachery shews the
character of those ministers, to whom the King had
entrusted the government of Scotland.</P>
<P>LAUDERDALE'S administration, besides the iniquities
arising from the extreme violence of his temper, and
the still greater iniquities inseparable from all projects
of persecution, was attended with other circumstances,
which engaged him into severe and arbitrary measures.
An absolute government was to be introduced, which on
its commencement is often most rigorous; and tyranny
<PB N="56" REF="70"/>
was still obliged, for want of military power, to cover
itself under an appearance of law; a situation which▪
rendered it extremely awkward in its motions, and by
provoking opposition, extended the fury of its op∣pressions.</P>
<P>THE rigours, exercised against conventicles, instead
of breaking the spirit of the fanatics, had tended only,
its is usual, to render them more obstinate in their errors,
to increase the fervour of their zeal, to link them more
closely with each other, and to enflame them against
the established hierarchy. The Commonalty, almost
every where in the South, particularly in the Western counties, frequented conventicles without reserve; and
the gentry, tho' they themselves commonly abstained
from these illegal places of worship, connived at this ir∣regularity
in their inferiors. In order to engage the for∣mer
on the side of the persecutors, a bond or contract
was by order of the Privy Council tendered to the land∣lords
in the West, by which they were to engage for
the good behaviour of their tenants; and in case any te∣nant
frequented a conventicle, they were to subject
themselves to the same fine as could by law be exacted
from the delinquent. It was ridiculous to give sanction
to laws by voluntary contracts: It was iniquitous to make
one man answerable for another's conduct: It was ille∣gal
to impose such hard conditions upon men▪ who had
no wise offended. For these reasons, the greatest part
of the gentry refused to sign those bonds; and Lauder∣dale,
enraged at this opposition, endeavoured to break
their spirit by expedients, which were still more unusual
and more arbitrary.</P>
<P>THE law enacted against conventicles, had called
them seminaries of rebellion. This expression, which
was nothing but a flourish of rhetoric, Lauderdale and
the Privy Council were willing to understand in a literal
sense: and because the western counties abounded in con∣venticles,
<PB N="57" REF="71"/>
tho' otherwise in the most profound peace,
they pretended, that these counties were in a state of ac∣tual
war and rebellion. They made therefore an agree∣ment
with some highland chieftains to call out their clans
to the number of 8000 men: to these they joined the
guards, and the militia of Angus: And they sent the
whole to live on free quarter upon the lands of such as
had refused the bonds illegally required of them. The
obnoxious counties were the most populous and most in∣dustrious in Scotland: The highlanders were the peo∣ple
the most disorderly and the least civilized. It Is easy
to imagine the havoc and destruction, which ensued.
A multitude, not accustomed to military discipline,
averse to the restraint of laws, trained up in rapine and
violence, were let loose amidst those whom they were
taught to regard as enemies to their Prince and to their
religion. Nothing escaped their ravenous hands: By
hardships, and sometimes by tortures, men were obliged
to discover their concealed wealth. Neither age, nor
sex, nor innocence afforded protection: And the gentry,
finding that even those who had been most compliant,
and who had subscribed the bonds, were alike exposed
to the rapacity of those barbarians, confirmed themselves
still more in the obstinate resolution of refusing them.
The voice of the nation was raised against this enor∣mous
outrage; and after two months free quarter, the
highlanders were at last sent back to their hills, loaded
with the spoils and execrations, of the West.</P>
<P>THOSE who had been engaged to subscribe the bonds,
could find no security but by turning out such tenants
as they suspected of an inclination to conventicles, and
thereby depopulating their estates. To encrease the mi∣sery
of these unhappy tenants the council enacted, that
none should be received any where, or allowed a habi∣tation,
who brought not a certificate of his conformity
from the parish-minister. That the obstinate and re∣fractory
<PB N="58" REF="72"/>
might not escape farther persecution, a new de∣vice
was fallen upon. By the law of Scotland, any man,
who should go before a magistrate, and swear that he
thought himself in danger from another, might obtain a
writ of <HI>law-burrows,</HI> as it is called; by which the lat∣ter
was bound,, under the penalty of imprisonment and outlawry,
to find security for his good behaviour. Lau∣derdale
entertained, the absurd notion of making the
King sue for writs of law-burrows against his subjects.
On this pretence, the refusers of the bonds were sum∣moned
to appear before the council, and were required
to bind themselves, under the penalty of two years rent,
neither to frequent conventicles themselves, nor allow
their family and tenants to be present at those unlawful
assemblies. Thus chicanery was joined to tyranny; and
the Majesty of the King, instead of being exalted, was
an reality prostituted; as if he were obliged to seek the
same security, which one neighbour might require of
another.</P>
<P>IT was an old law, but seldom executed, that a man,
who was accused of any crime, and did not appear, in
order to take his trial, might be <HI>intercommuned,</HI> that is,
he might be publicly outlawed; and whoever afterwards,
either on account of business, relation, nay charity,
had the least intercourse with him, was subjected to the
same penalties as could by law be inflicted on the cri∣minal
himself. A great many writs of intercommuning
were now issued against the hearers and preachers in
conventicles; and by this severe and even absurd law,
crimes and guilt went on multiplying in a geometrical
proportion. Where laws themselves are so violent, it
is no wonder that an administration should be ty∣rannical.</P>
<P>LEST the cry of an oppressed people should reach the
Throne, the council forbad, under high penalties, every
nobleman or gentleman of landed property to leave the
<PB N="59" REF="73"/>
kingdom. A severe edict, especially where the Sovereign
himself resided in a foreign country. Notwithstanding
this act of council, Cassilis first, afterwards Hamilton
and Tweddale, went to London, and laid their com∣plaints
before the King. These violent proceedings of
Lauderdale were very opposite to the natural temper of
Charles; and he immediately issued orders for disconti∣nuing
the bonds and the writs of law-burrows. But as
he was commonly little touched with what lay at a dis∣tance,
he entertained not the proper indignation against
those who had abused his authority. Even while he re∣tracted
these oppressive measures, he was prevailed with
to avow and praise them in a letter, which he wrote to
the privy council. This proof of confidence might for∣tify
the hands of the ministry, but the King ran a ma∣nifest
hazard of losing the affections of his subjects, by
not permitting even those who were desirous of it, to
distinguish between him and their oppressors.</P>
<P>IT is reported<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet.</NOTE>, that Charles, after a full hearing of
the debates concerning Scots affairs, said, “ I perceive
that Lauderdale has been guilty of many bad things,
against the people of Scotland; but I cannot find,
that he has acted any thing contrary to my interest.”
A sentiment most unworthy of a Sovereign!</P>
<P>DURING the absence of Hamilton and the other dis∣contented
Lords, the King allowed Lauderdale to sum∣mon
a convention of estates at Edinburgh. This con∣vention,
besides granting some money, bestowed ap∣plauses
on all Lauderdale's administration, and in their
addresses to the King, expressed the highest contentment
and satisfaction. But these instances of complaisance
had the contrary effect in England from what was ex∣pected
by the contrivers of them. All men there con∣cluded
that in Scotland the very voice of liberty was to∣tally

<PB N="59" REF="75"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="60" REF="76"/>
suppressed; and that, by the prevalence of tyranny,
grievances were so rivetted, that it was become dange∣rous
even to mention them, or complain to the Prince,
who alone was capable of redressing them. From the
slavery of the neighbouring kingdom, they inferred the
arbitrary dispositions of the King; and from the violence,
with which sovereign power was there exercised, they
apprehended the miseries, which might ensue to them∣selves
upon their loss of liberty. If persecution by a
protestant church could be carried to such extremities,
what might be dreaded from the prevalence of popery,
which had ever, in all ages, made open profession of
exterminating by fire and sword every opposite sect or
communion? And if the first approaches towards un∣limited
authority were so tyrannical, how dismal its
final establishment; when all dread of opposition shall
at last be removed by mercenary armies, and all sense
of shame by long and inveterate habit?</P>

<P>THE English nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXVII.</NOTE> ever since the fatal league with
France, had entertained violent jealousies against
the Court; and the subsequent measures adopted by the
King, had tended more to encrease than cure the gene∣ral
prejudices. Some mysterious design was still sus∣pected
in every enterprize and profession: Arbitrary
power and popery were apprehended as the scope of all
projects: Each breath or rumour made the people start
with anxiety: Their enemies, they thought, were in
their very bosom, and had got possession of their Sove∣reign's
confidence. While in this timorous, jealous dis∣position,
the cry of a <HI>plot</HI> all on a sudden struck their
<PB N="60" REF="78"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="61" REF="79"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="62" REF="80"/>
ears: They were wakened from their slumber; and like
men affrighted and in the dark, took every shadow for
a specter. The terror of each man became the source of
terror to another. And an universal panic being diffu∣sed,
reason and argument and common sense and com∣mon
humanity lost all influence over them. From this
disposition of men's minds we are to account for the pro∣gress
and credit of the POPISH PLOT;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The popish plot.</NOTE> an event, which
would otherwise appear prodigious and altogether inex∣plicable.</P>
<P>ON the twelfth of August, one Kirby, a chemist, ac∣costed
the Kang, as he was walking in the Park: “ Sir,”
said he, “ keep within the company: Your enemies
have a design upon your life; and you may be shot
in this very walk.” Being asked the reason of these
strange speeches, he said, that two men, called Grove
and Pickering, had engaged to shoot the King, and Sir
George Wakeman, the Queen's physician, to poyson
him. This intelligence, he added, had been commun∣nicated
to him by Doctor Tongue; whom, if per∣mitted,
he would introduce to his Majesty. Tongue
was a divine of the church of England; a man active,
restless, full of projects, devoid of understanding.
He brought papers to the King, which contained informa∣tion
of a plot, and were digested into forty-three articles.
The King not having leisure to peruse them, sent them
to the lord-treasurer, Danby, and ordered the two in∣formers
to lay the business before that minister. Tongue
confessed to Danby, that he himself had not drawn the
papers, that they had been secretly thrust under his door,
and that, tho' he suspected, he did not certainly know
who was the author. After a few days, he returned,
and told the treasurer, that his suspicions, he found,
were just; that the author of the intelligence, whom
he had met twice or thrice in the street, had acknow∣leged
the whole matter, and had given him a more par∣ticular
<PB N="63" REF="81"/>
account of the conspiracy, but desired, that his
name might be concealed, being apprehensive lest the
papists should murder him.</P>
<P>THE information was renewed with regard to Grove's
and Pickering's intentions of shooting the King; and
Tongue even pretended, that, at a particular time, they
were to set out for Windsor with that intention. Or∣ders
were given for arresting them, so soon as they
should appear in that place: But tho' this alarm was
more than once renewed, some frivolous reasons were
still found by Tongue for their delaying the journey.
And the King concluded, both from, these evasions, and
from the mysterious, artificial manner of communicating
the intelligence, that the whole was a fiction.</P>
<P>TONGUE came next to the treasurer, and told him,
that a pacquet of letters, wrote by jesuits concerned in
the plot, was that night to be put into the post-house
for Windsor, directed to Bedingfield, a jesuit, confessor
to the Duke. When this intelligence was conveyed to
the King, he replied, that the pacquet mentioned had a
few hours before been brought to the Duke by Beding∣field;
who said, that he suspected some bad design upon
him, that the letters seemed to contain matters of a dan∣gerous
import, and that he knew them not to be the hand∣writing
of the persons whose names were subscribed to
them. This incident still farther confirmed the King in
his incredulity.</P>
<P>THE matter had probably slept in this posture for ever, had it not been for the anxiety of the Duke, who, hearing
that priests and jesuits and even his own confessor had
been accused, was desirous, that a thorough, enquiry
should by made by the council into the pretended con∣spiracy.
Kirby and Tongue were enquired after, and
were now found to be living in close conjunction with
Titus Oates, the person who was said to have conveyed
the first intelligence to Tongue. Oates affirmed, that
<PB N="62" REF="82"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="63" REF="83"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="64" REF="84"/>
he had fallen under suspicion with the jesuits; that he
had received three blows with a stick and a box on the
ear from the provincial of that order, for revealing their
conspiracy: and that over-hearing them speak of their
intentions to punish him more severely, he had with∣drawn,
and concealed himself. This man, in whose
breast was lodged a secret, involving the fate of Kings
and kingdoms, was allowed to remain in such necessity,
that Kirby was obliged to supply him with daily bread;
and it was a joyful surprize to him, when he heard, that
the council were at last disposed to take some notice of
his intelligence. But as he expected more encourage∣ment
from the public, than from the King or his mini∣sters,
he thought proper, before he was presented to the
council, to go with his two companions to Sir Edmunds∣bury
Godfrey, a noted and active justice of peace, and
to give evidence before him of all the articles of the
conspiracy.</P>
<P>THE wonderful intelligence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">oates's narrative.</NOTE> which Oates conveyed
both to Godfrey and the council, and afterwards to the
Parliament, was to this purpose<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Oates's Narrative.</NOTE>. The pope, he said,
on examining the matter in the congregation <HI>de propa∣ganda
fide,</HI> had found himself entitled to the possession of
England and Ireland on account of the heresy of Prince
and people, and had accordingly assumed the sovereignty
of these kingdoms. This supreme power he had thought
proper to delegate to the society* of jesuits; and de
Oliva, general of that order, in consequence of the pa∣pal
grant, had exerted every act of regal authority, and
particularly had supplied, by commissions under the seal
of the society, all the chief offices, both civil and mili∣tary.
Lord Arundel was created chancellor, lord Powis
treasurer, Sir William Godolphin privy seal, Coleman
secretary of state, Langhorne attorney general, lord Bel∣lasis general of the papal army, lord Peters lieutenant
<PB N="65" REF="85"/>
general, lord Stafford pay-master; and inferior com∣missions, signed by the provincial of the jesuits, were
also distributed to men of all ranks. All the digni∣ties
of the church were filled, and many of them
with Spaniards and other foreigners. The provincial
had held a consult of the jesuits under his authority;
where the King, whom they opprobriously called the
Black Bastard, was solemnly tried and condemned as
a heretic; and a resolution taken to put him to death.
Father le Shee (for so this great plotter and informer
called father la Chaise, confessor to the French King, a
man of probity and humanity) had consigned in London
ten thousand pounds to be paid to any man, who should
merit it by this assassination. A Spanish provincial had
expressed like liberality: The prior of the Benedictines
was willing to go the length of six thousand pounds:
The Dominicans approved of the action; but pleaded
poverty. Ten thousand pounds had been offered to Sir
George Wakeman, the Queen's physician, who de∣manded
fifteen thousand, as a reward for so great a ser∣vice:
His demand was complied with; and five thou∣sand
had been paid him by advance. Lest this means
should fail, four Irish ruffians had been employed by the
jesuits, at the rate of twenty guineas a-piece, to stab the
King at Windsor; and Coleman, late secretary to the
Dutchess of York, had given the messenger, who car∣ried
them orders, a guinea to quicken his diligence.
Grove and Pickering were also employed to shoot the
King with silver bullets: The former was to receive the
sum of fifteen hundred pounds; the latter, being a pious
man, was to be rewarded with thirty thousand masses,
which, estimating masses at a shilling a-piece, amounted
to a like value. Pickering would have executed his pur∣pose,
had not the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int at one time dropt out of his pistol,
at another time the priming. Coniers, the jesuit, had
bought a knife at the price of ten shiliings, which, he
<PB N="66" REF="86"/>
thought, was not dear, considering the purpose for which
he inten ded it, to wit, stabbing the King. Letters of
subscription were circulated among the catholics all over
England, to raise a sum for the same purpose. No less
than fifty jesuits had met in May last, at the White-horse
tavern, where it was unanimously agreed to put the King
to death. This synod did afterwards, for more conve∣nience,
divide themselves into many less cabals or com∣panies;
and Oates was employed to carry notes and let∣ters
from one to another, all tending to the same end of
murthering the King. He even carried, from one com∣pany
to another, a paper, in which they formally expres∣sed
their resolution of executing that deed; and it was regu∣larly
subscribed by all of them. A wager of an hundred
pounds was laid, and stakes made, that the King should
eat no more Christmas pyes. In short, it was deter∣mined,
to use the expression of a jesuit, that if he would
not become R. C. (Roman Catholic) he should no lon∣ger
be C. R. (Charles rex). The great fire of London
had been the work of the jesuits, who had employed eighty
or eighty-six persons for that purpose, and had expended
seven hundred fire-balls; but they had a good return for
their charges; for they had been able to pilfer goods
from the fire to the value of fourteen thousand
pounds: The jesuits had also raised another fire on St.
Margaret's Hill, whence they had stolen goods to the
value of two thousand pounds: Another at Southwark:
and it was determined in like manner to burn all the
chief cities in England. A paper model was already
framed for the firing of London; the stations were re∣gularly
marked out, where the several fires were to com∣mence;
and the whole plan of operations was so con∣certed,
that precautions were taken by the jesuits to
vary their measures, according to the variations of the
winds. Fire-balls were familiarly called among then
Teuxbury mustard pills; and were said to contain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="67" REF="87"/>
notable biting sauce. In the great fire, it had been de∣termined
to murther the King; but he had discovered
such diligence and humanity in extinguishing the flames,
that even the jesuits relented, and spared his life. Be∣sides these assassinations and fires; insurrections, rebel∣lions,
and massacres were projected by that religious or∣der
in all the three kingdoms. There were twenty
thousand Catholics in London, who would rise in four
and twenty hours or les; and Jennison, a jesuit, said,
that they might easily cut the throats of an hundred thou∣sand
Protestants. Eight thousand Catholics had agreed
to take arms in Scotland. Ormond was to be murthered
by four jesuits; a general massacre of the Irish protest∣ants
was concerted; and forty thousand black bills
were already provided for that purpose. Coleman had
remitted two hundred thousand pounds to promote the
rebellion in Ireland; and the French King was to land
a great army in that island. Poole, who wrote the Sy∣nopsis,
was particularly marked out for assassination;
as was also, Dr. Stilllingfleet, a controversial writer against
the Papists. Burnet tells us, that Oates paid him the
same compliment. After all this havoc, the crown was
to be offer'd to the Duke, but on the following condi∣tions;
that he receive it as a gift from the Pope; that
he confirm all the papal commissions for offices and em∣ployments;
that he ratify all past transactions, by par∣doning
the incendiaries, and the murderers of his bro∣ther
and of the people; and that he consent to the utter
extirpation of the protestant religion. If he refuse these
conditions, he himfelf was immediately to be poisoned
or assassinated. <HI>To pot James must go;</HI> according to the
expression ascribed by Oates to the jesuits.</P>
<P>OATES, the informer of this dreadful plot, was him∣self the most infamous of mankind. He was the son of
an anabaptist preacher, chaplain to colonel Pride; but
having taken orders in the church, he had been provided
<PB N="66" REF="88"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="67" REF="89"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="68" REF="90"/>
in a small living by the duke of Norfolk. He had been
indicted for perjury; and by some means had escaped.
He was afterwards a chaplain on board the fleet;
whence he had been dismissed on complaint of some un∣natural
practices, not fit to be named. He then became
a convert to the Catholics; but he afterwards boasted,
that his conversion was a mere pretence, in order to get
into their secrets, and to betray them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Echard, North, L'Estrange, &amp;c.</NOTE>: He was sent
over to the jesuit's college at St. Omers, and tho' above
thirty years of age, he there lived some time among the
students. He was dispatched on an errand to Spain;
and thence returned to St. Omers; where the jesuits,
heartily tired of their convert, at last dismissed him from
their seminary. It is likely, that from resentment of this
usage, he was induced, in combination with Tongue,
to contrive that plot, of which he accused the Catholics.</P>
<P>THIS abandoned man, when examined before the
council, betrayed his impostures in such a manner, as
would have utterly discredited the most consistent sto∣ry,
and the most reputable evidence. While in Spain,
he had been, carried, he said, to Don John, who pro∣mised
great assistance to the execution of the catholic de∣signs.
The King asked him, what sort of man Don
John was: He answered, a tall, lean man; directly
contrary to truth, as the King well knew<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Burnet, North.</NOTE>. He totally
mistook the situation of the jesuit's college at Paris<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">North.</NOTE>.
Tho' he pretended great intimacies with Coleman, he
knew him not, when placed very near him; and had no
other excuse than that his sight was bad in candle-light<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, North, Triale.</NOTE>.
He fell into like mistakes with regard to Wakeman.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING these objections, great atten∣tion
was paid to Oates's evidence, and the plot became very
soon the subject of conversation, and even the object of
terror to the people. The violent animosity, which had
been excited against the Catholics in general, made the
<PB N="69" REF="91"/>
public swallow the grossest absurdities, when they ac∣companied
an accusation of those religionists: And the more
diabolical any contrivance appeared, the better it suited the
tremendous idea entertained of a jesuit. Danby likewise,
who stood in opposition to the French and catholic inte∣rest
at court, was willing to encourage every story, which
might serve to discredit that party. By his suggestion,
when a warrant was signed for arresting Coleman, there
was inserted a clause for seizing his papers; a circum∣stance attended with the most important consequences.</P>
<P>COLEMAN, partly on his own account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coleman's letters.</NOTE> partly by or∣ders
from the Duke, had been engaged in a correspon∣dence
with father la Chaise, with the Pope's nuncio at
Brussels, and with other Catholics abroad; and being
himself a fiery zealot, busy and sanguine, the expressions
in his letters often betrayed great violence and indiscre∣tion.
His correspondence during the years 1674, 1675,
and part of 1676, was seized, and contained many ex∣traordinary
passages. In particular he said to la Chaise,
“ We have here a mighty work upon our hands, no less
than the conversion of three kingdoms, and by that
perhaps the utter subduing of a pestilent heresy, which
has a long time domineered over a great part of this
northern world. There were never such hopes of
success, since the days of Queen Mary, as now in our
days. God has given us a prince,” meaning the
Duke, “ who is become (may I say a miracle) zealous
of being the author and instrument of so glorious a
work; but the opposition we are sure to meet with is
also like to be great: So that it imports us to get all the
aid and assistance we can.” In another letter he said,
“I can scarce believe myself awake, or the thing real,
when I think of a Prince in such an age as we live
in, converted to such a degree of zeal and piety, as
not to regard any thing in the world in comparison
of God Almighty's glory, the salvation of his own
<PB N="70" REF="92"/>
soul, and the conversion of our poor kingdom.” In
other passages, the interests of the Crown of England,
those of the French King, and those of the catholic re∣ligion
are spoke of as inseparable. The Duke is also said
to have connected his interests unalterably with those of
Lewis. The King himself, he affirms, is always in∣clined
to favour the Catholics, when he may do it with∣out
hazard. “ Money,” Coleman adds, “ cannot fail
of perswading the King to any thing. There is no∣thing
it cannot make him do, were it ever so much to
his prejudice. It has such an absolute power over
him, that he cannot resist it. Logic in our court
built upon money, has more powerful charms than
any other sort of argument.” For these reasons, he
proposes to father la Chaise, that the French King should
remit the sum of 300,000 pounds, on condition that the
Parliament be dissolved; a measure, to which, he says,
the King was, of himself, sufficiently inclined, were it
not for his hopes of obtaining money from that assembly.
The Parliament, he said, had already constrained the
King to make peace with Holland, contrary to the in∣terests
of the catholic religion, and of his most christian
majesty: And if they should meet again, they would
surely engage him farther, and even to make war
against France. It appears also from the same letters,
that the assembling the Parliament so late as April in the
year 1675, had been procured by the intrigues of the ca∣tholic
and French party, who thereby intended to show
the Dutch and other confederates abroad, that they could
expect no assistance from England.</P>
<P>WHEN the contents of these letters were publicly
known, they diffused the panic,, with which the nation
began already to be seized on account of the popish
plot. Men reasoned more from their fears and their
passions than from the evidence before them. It is cer∣tain,
that the active and enterprizing spirit of the ca∣tholic
<PB N="71" REF="93"/>
church, particularly of the jesuits, merits atten∣tion,
and is, in some degree, dangerous to every other
communion. Such zeal of proselytism actuates that
sect, that its missionaries have penetrated into every na∣tion
of the globe; and in one sense there is a <HI>popish plot</HI>
perpetually carried on against: all states, Protestant, Pa∣gan,
and Mahometan. It is likewise very probable, that
the conversion of the Duke, and the favour of the King,
had inspired the catholic priests with new hopes of reco∣vering
in these islands their lost dominion, and gave fresh
vigour to that intemperate zeal, by which they are com∣monly
actuated. Their first aim was to obtain a tolera∣tion;
and such was the evidence, they believed, of their
theological tenets, that, could they but procure entire
liberty, they must infallibly in time open the eyes of
the people. After they had converted considerable num∣bers,
they might be enabled, they hoped, to re-instate
themselves in full authority, and entirely to suppress that
heresy, with which the kingdom had so long been in∣fected.
Tho' these dangers to the protestant religion
were very distant, it was justly the object of great con∣cern
to find, that the heir apparent to the crown was so
blinded with bigotry, and so deeply engaged in foreign
interests; and that the King himself had been prevailed
with, from low interests, to hearken to his dangerous in∣sinuations.
Very bad consequences might ensue from
such perverse habits and attachments; nor could the na∣tion
and Parliament guard against them with too anxious
a precaution. But that the Roman pontiff could hope to
assume the sovereignty of these kingdoms; a project,
which, even during the darkness of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, would have appeared chimerical:
That he should delegate this authority to the jesuits; that
order in the Romish church, which was the most hated:
That a massacre could be attempted of the Protestants,
who surpassed the Catholics a hundred fold, and were
<PB N="70" REF="94"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="71" REF="95"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="72" REF="96"/>
invested with the whole authority, of the state: That the
King himself was to be assassinated, and even the Duke,
the only support of their party: These were such ab∣surdities as no human testimony was sufficient to prove;
much less the evidence of one man, who was noted for
infamy, and who could not keep himself, every mo∣ment,
from falling into the grossest inconsistencies. Did
such intelligence deserve even so much attention as to be
refuted, it would appear, that Coleman's letters were
sufficient alone to destroy all its credit. For how could
so long a train of correspondence be carried on, by a man
so much trusted by the party; and yet no traces of in∣surrections, if really intended, of fires, massacres, assas∣sinations,
invasions, be ever discovered in any single
passage of these letters? But all such reflections, and
many more equally obvious, were vainly employed
against that general prepossession, with which the nation
was seized. Oates's plot and Coleman's were univer∣sally
confounded: And the evidence of the latter being
unquestionable, the belief of the former, aided by the
passions of hatred and of terror, took possesson of the
whole people.</P>
<P>THERE was danger however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of Oc∣tober. Godfrey's murder.</NOTE> lest time might open the
eyes of the public; when the murther of Godfrey com∣pleated
the general delusion, and rendered the prejudices
of the nation absolutely incurable. This magistrate had
been missing some days; and after much search, and
many surmizes, his body was found lying in a ditch at
Primrose-hill: The marks of strangling were thought to
appear about his neck, and some contusions on his
breast: His own sword was sticking in the body; but as
no considerable quantity of blood ensued on drawing it,
it was concluded, that it had been thrust in after his
death, and that he had not killed himself: He had rings
on his fingers and money in his pocket: It was there∣fore
inferred, that he had not fallen into the hands of
<PB N="73" REF="97"/>
robbers. Without farther reasoning, the cry rose, that
he had been assassinated by the Papists, on account of
his taking Oates's evidence. This clamour was quickly
propagated, and met with universal belief. The panic
spread itself on every side with infinite rapidity; and all
men, astonished with fear, and animated with rage, saw
in Godfrey's fate all the horrible designs ascribed to the
Catholics; and no farther doubt remained of Oates's
veracity. The voice of the whole nation united against
that hated sect; and notwithstanding that the bloody
conspiracy was supposed to be now discovered, men
could scarce be perswaded, that their lives were yet in
safety. Each hour teemed with new rumours and sur∣mizes.
Invasions from abroad, insurrections at home,
even private murthers and poisonings were apprehended.
To deny the reality of the plot was to be an accomplice:<NOTE PLACE="marg">General constern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion.</NOTE>
To hesitate was criminal; Royalist, Republican;
Churchman, Sectary; Courtier, Patriot; all parties
concurred in the illusion. The city prepared for
its defence, as if the enemy were at its gates: The
chains and posts were put up: And it was a noted saying
at that time of Sir Thomas Player, the chamberlain,
that were it not for these precautions, all the citizens
might rise next morning with their throats cut<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">North, p. 206.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to propagate the popular phrenzy, several ar∣tifices
were employed. The dead body of Godfrey was
carried into the city, attended by vast multitudes. It
was publickly exposed in the streets, and viewed by all
ranks of men; and every one, who saw it, went away
inflamed, as well by the mutual contagion of sentiments,
as by the dismal spectacle itself. The funeral pomp was
celebrated with great parade. It was conducted thro' the
chief streets of the city: Seventy-two clergymen marched
before: Above a thousand persons of distinction followed after: And at the funeral-sermon, two able-bodied di∣vines
<PB N="74" REF="98"/>
mounted the pulpit, and stood on each side of the
preacher, lest, in paying the last office to this unhappy
magistrate, he should, before the whole people, be
murthered by the Papists<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">North, p. 205.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN this disposition of the nation, reason could no more
be heard than a whisper in the midst of the most violent
hurricane. Even at present, Godfrey's, murther cannot
upon any system be rationally accounted for. That he
was assassinated by the Catholics, seems utterly impro∣bable.
These religionists could not be engaged to com∣mit
that crime from <HI>policy,</HI> in order to deter other magis∣trates
from acting against them. Godfrey's fate was no
wise capable of producing that effect, unless it were
publickly known, that the Catholics were his murther∣ers;
an opinion, which, it was easy to foresee, must
prove the ruin of their party. Besides, how many
magistrates, during more than a century, had acted in
the most violent manner, without its being ever sus∣pected,
that any one had been cut off by assassination?
Such jealous times as the present were surely ill fitted for
beginning these dangerous experiments. Shall we there∣fore
say, that the Catholics were pushed on, not by po∣licy,
but by blind <HI>revenge</HI> against Godfrey? But Godfrey
had given them little or no occasion of offence in taking
Oates's evidence. His part was merely an act of form,
belonging to his office; nor could he, or any man in his
station, possibly refuse it. In the rest of his conduct,
he lived on good terms with the Catholics, and was far
from distinguishing himself by his severity against that
sect. It is even certain, that he had contracted an in∣timacy
with Coleman, and took care to inform his friend
of the danger to which, by reason of Oates's evidence,
he was at present exposed.</P>
<P>THERE are some writers, who, finding it impossible
to account for Godfrey's murther by the machinations of
<PB N="75" REF="99"/>
the Catholics, have recourse to the opposite supposition.
They lay hold of that common presumption, that those
commit the crime who reap profit by it; and they affirm
that it was Shaftesbury and the heads of the popular
party, who perpetrated that deed, in order to throw the
odium of it on the Papists. But if this supposition be
received, it must also be admitted, that the whole plot
was the contrivance of those politicians; and that Oates
acted altogether under their direction. But it appears,
that Oates, dreading probably the opposition of power∣ful
enemies, had very anxiously acquitted the Duke,
Danby, Ormond, and all the ministry; persons who
were certainly the most obnoxious to the popular leaders.
Besides, the whole texture of the plot contains such low
absurdity, that it is impossible to have been the inven∣tion
of any man of sense or education. It is true, the more
monstrous and horrible the conspiracy, the better was it
fitted to terrify, and thence to convince the populace:
But this effect, we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay safely say, no one could before∣hand
have promised upon; and a fool was in this case
more likely to succeed than a wise man. Had Shaftes∣bury
laid the plan of a popish conspiracy, he had pro∣bably
rendered it moderate, consistent, credible; and on
that very account had never met with the prodigious suc∣cess,
with which Oates's tremendous fictions were at∣tended.</P>
<P>WE must, therefore, be contented to remain for ever
ignorant of the actors of Godfrey's murther; and only
pronounce in general, that that event, in all likelihood,
had no connexion, one way or other, with the popish
plot. Any man, especially so active a magistrate as Godfrey,
might, in such a city as London, have many enemies,
of whom his friends and family had no suspicion. He
was a melancholy man; and there is some reason, not∣withstanding
all the pretended appearances to the con∣trary,
to suspect that he fell by his own hands. The
<PB N="76" REF="100"/>
affair was never examined with tranquillity, or even
common sense, during the time: and it is impossible
for us, at this distance, certainly to account for it.</P>
<P>NO ONE doubted but the papists had assassinated God∣frey:
but still the particular actors were unknown. A
proclamation was issued by the King, offering a pardon
and five hundred pounds reward to any one who would
discovcr them. As it was afterwards surmized, that the
terror of a like assassination would prevent discovery, a
new proclamation was issued, promising absolute protec∣tion
to any one who would reveal the secret. Thus
were indemnity, money, and security offered to the
fairest bidder: And no one needed to fear, during the
present fury of the people, that his evidence would un∣dergo
too severe a scrutiny.</P>
<P>WHILE the nation was in this ferment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st of Oc∣tober. The Par∣liament.</NOTE> the Parlia∣ment
was assembled. In his speech the King told them,
that tho' they had given money for di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>banding the army<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">They had granted him 600,000 pounds for disbanding the army, for re-imbursing the charges of his naval armament, and for paying the Prin∣cess of Orange's portion.</NOTE>,
he had found Flanders so exposed, that he had thought
it necessary still to keep them on foot, and doubted not
but this measure would meet with their approbation.
He informed them, that his revenue lay under great an∣ticipations,
and at best was never equal to the constant
and necessary expence of the government; as would ap∣pear
from the state of it, which he intended to lay be∣fore
them. He also mentioned the plot, carried on
against his life by the jesuits; but said, that he would
forbear delivering any opinion of the matter, lest he
should seem to say too much or too little; and that he
would leave the scrutiny of it entirely to the law.</P>
<P>THE King was anxious to keep the question of the
popish plot from the Parliament, where he suspected
many designing people would very much abuse the pre∣sent
<PB N="77" REF="101"/>
credulity of the nation: But Danby, who hated the
catholics, and courted popularity, and perhaps hoped, that
the King, if his life was believed to be in danger from the
jesuits, would be more cordially loved by the nation, had
entertained opposite designs; and the very first day of the
session, he opened the matter in the House of Peers.
The King was extremely displeased with this temerity,
and told his minister, “Though you do not believe it,
you will find, that you have given the Parliament a
handle to ruin yourself, as well as to disturb all my
affairs; and you will surely live to repent it.” Dan∣by
had afterwards sufficient reason to applaud the saga∣city
of his master.</P>
<P>The cry of the plot was immediately echoed from one
House to the other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal of the Parliament.</NOTE> The verdict of Parliament gave
sanction to that fury, with which the people were already
agitated. An address was voted for a solemn fast: A
form of prayer was contrived for that service; and be∣cause
the popish plot had been omitted in the first
draught, it was carefully ordered to be inserted; lest
omniscience should want intelligence, to use the words
of an historian<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">North, p. 207.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to continue and propagate the alarm, ad∣dresses
were voted for laying before the house such pa∣pers
as might discover the horrible conspiracy; for the
removal of popish recusants from London; for admini∣stering
every where the oaths of allegiance and supre∣macy;
for denying access at court to all unknown
and suspicious persons; and for appointing the train∣bands
of London and Westminster to be in readiness.
The lords Powis, Stafford, Arundel, Peters, and Bel∣lasis
were committed to the Tower, and were soon after
impeached for high treason. And both Houses, after
hearing Oates's evidence, voted, “ That the Lords and
Commons are of opinion, that there hath been, and
<PB N="78" REF="102"/>
still is, a damnable and hellish plot, contrived and car∣ried
on by the popish recusants, for assassinating and
murdering the King, for subverting the government,
and for rooting out and destroying the protestant re∣ligion.”</P>
<P>So vehement were the Houses, that they sat every
day, forenoon and afternoon, on the subject of the plot:
For no other business could be admitted. A committee
of Lords were appointed to examine prisoners and wit∣nesses:
Blank warrants were put into their hands, for
the commitment of such as should be accused or suspec∣ted.
Oates, who, tho' his evidence were true, must,
by his own confession, be regarded as an infamous vil∣lain,
was by every one applauded, caressed, and called
the saviour of the nation. He was recommended by the
parliament to the King. He was lodged in Whitehall,
protected by guards, and encouraged by a pension of
1200 pounds a year.</P>
<P>IT was not long before such bountiful encouragement
brought forth new witnesses. William Bedloe, a man,
if possible, more infamous than Oates, appeared next
upon the stage. He was of very low birth, had been
noted for several cheats and even thefts, had travelled
over many parts of Europe under borrowed names, had
frequently passed himself for a man of quality, and had
endeavoured, by a variety of lyes and contrivances, to
prey upon the ignorant and unwary. When he appeared
before the council, he gave intelligence only of God∣frey's
murther, which, he said, had been perpetrated in
Somerset-house, where the Queen lived, by papists,
some of them servants in her family. He was questioned
about the plot; but utterly denied all knowlege of it
and also asserted, that he had no acquaintance with Oates
Next day, when examined before the committee o
Lords, he bethought himself better, and was ready to
give an ample account of the plot, which he found <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="79" REF="103"/>
anxiously inquired into. This narrative he made to tally,
as well as he could, with that of Oates, which had
been published: But that he might make himself accept∣able
by new information, he added some other circum∣stances,
and those, still more tremendous and extraor∣dinary.
He said, that ten thousand men were to be
landed from Flanders in Burlington Bay, and immedi∣ately
to seize Hull: That Jersey and Guernsey were to
be surprized by forces from Brest; and that a French
fleet were, all last summer, hovering in the Channel for
that purpose: That the lords Powis and Peters were to
form an army in Radnorshire, to be joined by another
army, consisting of twenty or thirty thousand religious
men and pilgrims, who were to land at Milford Haven
from St. Iago in Spain: That there were forty thousand
men ready in London; besides those, who would, on
the alarm, be posted at every alehouse door, in order to
kill the soldiers, as they came out of their quarters:
That lord Stafford, Coleman, and father Ireland had
money sufficient to defray the expences of all these ar∣maments:
That he himself was to receive four thousand
pounds, as one that could murder a man; as also a com∣mission
from lord Bellasis, and a benediction from the
Pope: That the King was to be assassinated; all the Pro∣testants
massacred who would not seriously be converted;
the government offered to ONE, if he would consent to
hold it of the church; but if he should refuse that con∣dition,
as was suspected, the authority would be left to
certain lords under the nomination of the Pope. In a
subsequent examination before the Commons, Bedloe
added (for these men always brought their intelligence
successively and by piece-meal) that lord Carrington was
also in the conspiracy for raising men and money against
the government; as was likewise lord Brudenel. These
noblemen, with all other persons mentioned by Bedloe,
were immediately committed to custody by the Parliament.

IT is remarkable, that the only resource of Spain, in
her present decayed condition, lay in the assistance of
England; and, so far from being in a situation to tran∣sport
ten thousand men for the invasion of that king∣dom,
she had sollicited and obtained English forces to be
sent into the garrisons of Flanders, which were not
otherwise able to defend themselves against the French.
The French too, we may observe, were, at that very
time, in open war with Spain, and yet are supposed to be
engaged in the same design against England; as if religious
motives were become the sole actuating principle among
sovereigns. But none of these circumstances; however
obvious, were able, when set in opposition to multiplied
horrors, antipathies, and prejudices, to engage the least
attention of the populace: For such the whole nation
were at this time become. The popish plot passed for
incontestible: And had not men soon expected with cer∣tainty
the legal punishment of these criminals, the Ca∣tholics
had been exposed to the hazard of an universal
massacre. The torrent indeed of national prejudices ran
so high, that no-one, without the most imminent dan∣ger,
durst venture openly to oppose it; nay, scarce
any-one, without great force of judgment, could secretly
entertain an opinion contrary to the prevailing senti∣ments.
The loud and unanimous voice of a great na∣tion
has mighty authority over weak minds; and even
later historians are so swayed by the concurring judg∣ment
of such multitudes, that some of them have esteemed
themselves sufficiently moderate, when they affirmed,
that many circumstances of the plot were true, tho'
some were added, and others much magnified. But it
is an obvious principle, that a witness, who perjures
himself, in one circumstance, is credible in none: And
the authority of the plot, even to the end of the prose∣cutions,
stood entirely upon witnesses. Tho' the Ca∣tholics
had been suddenly and unexpectedly detected, at
<PB N="81" REF="107"/>
the very moment, when their conspiracy, it is said, was
ready to be put in execution; no arms, no ammunition,
no money, no commissions, no papers, no letters, af∣ter
the most rigorous search, ever were discouraraged, to
confirm the evidence of Oates and Bedloe. Yet still
the nation, tho' often frustrated, went on in the eager
pursuit and confident belief of the conspiracy: And even
the manifold inconsistencies and absurdities, contained
in the Narratives, instead of discovering them, served
only as farther incentives to discover the bottom of the
plot, and were considered as slight objections, which a
more complete information would fully remove. In all
history, it will be difficult to find such another instance
of popular frenzy and bigotted delusion.</P>
<P>IN order to support the panic among the people, espe∣cially
among the citizens of London, a pamphlet was
published with this title, “A narrative and impartial
discovery of the horrid popish plot, carried on for
burning and destroying the cities of London and West∣minster
with their suburbs; setting forth the several
consults, orders, and resolutions of the jesuits, con∣cerning
the same: By captain William Bedloe, lately
engaged in that horrid design, and one of the popish
committee for carrying on such fires” Every fire,
which had happened for several years past, is there ascri∣bed
to the machinations of the jesuits, who proposed,
as Bedloe said, by such attempts to find an opportunity
for the general massacre of the protestants; and in the
mean time, were pleased to enrich themselves by pilfer∣ing
goods from the fires.</P>
<P>THE King, tho' he scrupled not, wherever he could
use freedom, to throw the highest ridicule on the plot,
and on all who believed it; yet found it necessary to
adopt the popular opinion before the Parliament. The
torrent, he saw, ran too strong to be controuled; and
be could only hope, by a seeming compliance, to be
<PB N="82" REF="108"/>
able, after some time, to guide and direct and elude its
fury. He made therefore a speech to both Houses; in
which he told them, that he would take the utmost care
of his person during these times of danger; that he was
as ready as their hearts could wish, to join with them in
all means for establishing the protestant religion, not only
during his own time, but for all future ages; that,
provided the right of succession was preserved, he would
consent to any laws for restraining a popish successor:
And in conclusion, he exhorted them to think of effec∣tual
means for the conviction of popish recusants; and
he highly praised the duty and loyalty of all his subjects,
who had discovered such anxious concern for his safety.</P>
<P>THESE gracious expressions abated nothing of the vehe∣mence
of parliamentary proceedings. A bill was introduced
for a new test, in which popery was denominated idola∣try;
and all members, who refused this test, were exclu∣ded
both Houses. The bill passed the Commons without
much opposition; but in the upper House the Duke moved,
that an exception might be admitted in his favour.
With great earnestness, and even wth tears in his eyes,
he told them, that he was now to cast himself on their
kindness, in the greatest concern, which he could have
in the world; and he protested, that, whatever his re∣ligion
might be, it should only be a private thing be∣tween
God and his own soul, and never should appear in
his public conduct. Notwithstanding this strong effort,
in so important a point, he prevailed only by two
voices; a sufficient indication of the general disposition
of the people. “I would not have,” said a noble Peer,
in the debate on this bill, “so much as a popish man
or a popish woman to remain here; not so much as a
popish dog or a popish bitch; not so much as a popish
cat to pur or mew about the King.” What is mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
extraordinary, this speech met with praise and appro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
bation.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="109"/>
ENCOURAGED by this general fury, the witnesses went
till a step farther in their accusations; and tho' both
Oates and Bedloe had often declared, that there was no
other person of distinction, whom they knew to be con∣cerned
in the plot, they were now so audacious as to ac∣cuse
even the Queen herself of entering into the design
against her husband's life. The Commons, in an ad∣dress
to the King, gave countenance to this scandalous
accusation; but the Lords would not be prevailed with
to join in the address. It is here, if any where, that
we may suspect the suggestions of the popular leaders
to have had place. The King, it was well known,
bore no great affection to his consort; and now more
than ever, when his heir apparent was so much hated,
had reason to be desirous of issue, which might quiet the
jealous fears of his people. This very hatred▪ which
prevailed against the Duke, would much facilitate, he
knew, any expedient that could be devised for the ex∣clusion
of that Prince; and nothing farther seemed re∣quisite
for the King, than to give way in this particular
to the rage and fury of the nation. But Charles, not∣withstanding
all allurements of pleasure, or interest, or
safety, had the generosity to protect his injured consort.
“They think,” said he, “I have a mind to a new wife;
but for all that I will not see an innocent woman
abused<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">North's Emamen, p. 186.</NOTE>.” He immediately ordered Oates to be
strictly confined, seized his papers, and dismissed his
servants; and this daring informer was obliged to make
applications to Parliament, in order to recover his liberty.</P>
<P>DURING this agitation of men's minds, the Parlia∣ment
gave new attention to the militia; a circumstance,
which, even during the times of greatest tranquillity,
can never prudently be neglected. They passed a bill,
by which it was enacted, that a regular militia should
be kept in arms, during six weeks of the year, and a
<PB N="84" REF="110"/>
third part of them do duty every fortnight of that time.
The popular leaders probably intended to make use of the
general prejudices, and even to turn the arms of the
people against the Prince<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 437.</NOTE>. But Charles refused his as∣sent
to the bill, and told the Parliament, that he would
not, were it for half an hour, part so far with the power
of the sword: But if they would contrive any other
bill for ordering the militia, and still leave it in his
power to assemble or dismiss them as he thought proper,
he would willingly give it the royal sanction. The Com∣mons,
dissatisfied with this negative, tho' the King had never
before employed that prerogative, immediately voted that
all the new-levied forces should be dismissed. They
passed a bill, granting money for that service; but to
shew their extreme jealousy of the Crown, besides ap∣propriating
that money by the strictest clauses, they or∣dered
it to be paid, not into the exchequer, but into the
chamber of London. The Lords demurred with regard
to so extraordinary a clause, which threw a violent re∣flection
on the King's ministers, and even on himself▪
and by that means the act remained in suspence.</P>
<P>IT was no wonder, that the present ferment and cre∣dulity
of the nation engaged men of infamous character
and indigent circumstances to become informers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accusation of Danby.</NOTE> when
persons of rank and condition could be tempted to give into
that scandalous practice. Montague, the King's ambassa∣dor
at Paris, had procured a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat in the lower House;
and without obtaining or asking the King's leave, he
suddenly came over into England. Charles, suspecting
his intention, ordered his papers to be seized; but Mon∣tague,
who foresaw this measure, had taken care to se∣crete
one paper, which he immediately laid before the
House of Commons. It was a letter from the treasurer
Danby, wrote at the beginning of the year, during the
negotiations at Nimeguen for the general peace. Mon∣tague
<PB N="85" REF="111"/>
was there directed to make a demand of money;
or in other words, the King was willing secretly to sell
his good offices to France, contrary to the general in∣terests
of the confederates, and even to those of his own
kingdoms. The letter, among other particulars, con∣tains
these words: “In case the conditions of peace
shall be accepted, the king expects to have six milli∣ons
of livres a year for three years, from the time
that this agreement shall be signed between his Ma∣jesty
and the King of France; because it will pro∣bably
be two or three years before the Parliament will
be in humour to give him any supplies after the making
of any peace with France; and the ambassador here
has always agreed to that sum; but not for so long a
time.” Danby was so unwilling to engage in this ne∣gotiation,
that the King, to satisfy him, subjoined with
his own hand these words; “This letter is writ by my
order, C. R.”</P>
<P>THE Commons were inflamed with this intelligence;
and carrying their suspicions much farther than the truth,
they concluded, that the King had all along acted in
concert with the French court; and that every step,
which he had taken in conjunction with the allies, had
been illusory and deceitful. Desirous of getting to the
bottom of so important a secret, and being pushed by
Danby's numerous enemies, they immediately voted an im∣peachment
of high treason against that minister, and
sent up six articles to the House of Peers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His impeachment.</NOTE> These ar∣ticles
were, That he had traiterously engrossed to him∣self
regal power, by giving instructions to his ma∣jesty's
ambassadors, without the participation of the se∣cretaries
of state, or the privy council: That he had
traiterously endeavoured to subvert the government, and
introduce arbitrary power; and to that end, had levied
and continued an army, contrary to act of Parliament:
That he had traiterously endeavoured to alienate the af∣fections
<PB N="86" REF="112"/>
of his Majesty's subjects, by negotiating a
disadvantageous peace with France, and procuring mo∣ney
for that purpose: That he was popishly affected,
and had traiterously concealed, after he had notice, the late
horrid and bloody plot, contrived by the papists against
his Majesty's person and government: That he had
wasted the King's treasure: And that he had by indirect
means obtained several exorbitant grants from the Crown.</P>
<P>IT is certain that the treasurer, in giving instructions
to the ambassador, had exceeded the bounds of his of∣fice:
and as the genius of a monarchy, strictly limited,
requires, that the proper minister should be answerable
for every abuse of power, the Commons, tho' they here
advanced a new pretension, might justify themselves by
the utility and even necessity of it. But in other respects
their charge against Danby was very ill grounded. That
minister made it appear to the House of Lords, not only
that Montague, the informer against him, had all along
promoted the money-negotiations with France, but that
he himself was ever extremely averse to the interests of
that crown, which he esteemed pernicious to his master,
and to his country. The French nation, he said, had
always entertained, as he was certainly informed, the
highest contempt, both of the King's person and go∣vernment.
His diligence, he added, in tracing and dis∣covering
the popish plot, was generally known; and
if he had common sense, not to say common honesty, he
would surely be anxious to preserve the life of a master,
by whom he was so much favoured. He had wasted no
treasure, because there was no treasure to waste. And
tho' he had reason to be grateful for the King's bounty,
he had made more moderate acquisitions than were gene∣rally
imagined, and than others in his office had ofte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
done, even during a shorter administration.</P>
<P>THE House of Peers plainly saw, that, allowing al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the charge of the Commons to be true, Danby's crim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fell
<PB N="87" REF="113"/>
not under the statute of Edward the third; and tho'
the words, <HI>treason</HI> and <HI>traiterously,</HI> had been carefully
subjoined to several articles, this appellation could not
alter the nature of things, or subject him to the penal∣ties
annexed to that crime. They refused, therefore, to
commit Danby upon this irregular charge: The Com∣mons
insisted on their demand; and a great contest was
likely to arise, when the King, who had already ob∣served

thought proper to prorogue them. This pro∣rogation
was soon after followed by a dissolution; a des∣perate
remedy in the present disposition of the nation.
But the disease, it must be owned, the King had rea∣son
to esteem desperate. The utmost rage had been discovered
by the Commons, on account of the popish
plot; and their fury began already to point against the
royal family, if not against the Throne itself. The
Duke had been struck at in several motions: The trea∣surer
had been impeached: All supply had been refused,
except on the most disagreeable conditions: Fears, jea∣lousies,
and antipathies were every day multiplying in
Parliament: And tho' the people were strongly infected
with the same prejudices, the King hoped, by dissolving
the present cabals, that a set of men might be chosen,
more moderate in their pursuits, and less tainted with
the virulence of faction.</P>
<P>THUS came to a period a parliament, which had state
during the whole course of this reign, one year excepted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its cha∣racter.</NOTE>
Its conclusion was very different from its commence∣ment,
Being elected during the joy and festivity of the
restoration, it consisted almost entirely of royalists;
who were disposed to support the Crown by all the libera∣lity,
which the habits of that age would permit. Alarmed
by the alliance with France, they gradually withdrew
their confidence from the King; and finding him still
<PB N="88" REF="114"/>
to persevere in a foreign interest, they proceeded to dis∣cover
symptoms of the most refractory and most jealous
disposition. The popish plot pushed them beyond all bounds
of moderation; and before their dissolution they seemed
to be treading stast in the foot-steps of the last long Par∣liament,
on whose conduct they threw at first such vio∣lent
blame. In all their variations, they had still followed
the opinions and prejudices of the nation; and seemed
ever to be more governed by humour and party views
than by public interest, and more by public interest than
by any corrupt or private influence.</P>
<P>DURING the fitting of the Parliament, and after its
prorogation and dissolution, the trials of the pretended
criminals were carried on; and the courts of judicature,
places, which, if possible, ought to be kept more pure
from injustice than even national assemblies themselves,
were strongly infected with the same party rage and bi∣gotted
prejudices. Coleman, the most obnoxious of
the conspirators, was first brought to his trial. His
letters were produced against him. They contained,
as he himself confessed, much indiscRetion: But unless
so far as it is illegal to be a zealous catholic, they seem
to prove nothing criminal, much less treasonable, against
him. Oates and Bedloe swore, that he had received a
commission, signed by the superior of the jesuits, to be
papal secretary of state, and had consented to the poi∣soning,
shooting, and stabbing the King: He had even,
according to Oates's deposition, advanced a guinea to
promote those bloody purposes. These wild stories were
all confounded with the projects contained in his letters;
and Coleman received sentence of death. The sentence
was soon after executed upon him<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">3<SUP>d</SUP> of December.</NOTE>. He suffered with
calmness and constancy, and to the last persisted in the
strongest protestations of his innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="115"/>
COLEMAN'S execution was suceceded by the trial of
father Ireland, who, 'tis pretended, had signed, toge∣ther
with fifty jesuits, the great resolve of murdering the
King. Grove and Pickering, who had undertaken to
shoot him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Ireland.</NOTE> were tried at the same time. The only wit∣nesses
against the prisoners were still Oates and Bedloe.
Ireland affirmed, that he was in Staffordshire all the
month of August last, a time when Oates's evidence
made him in London. He proved his assertion by good
evidence, and would have proved it by undoubted; had
he not, most iniquitously, been debarred, while in pri∣son,
of all use <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pen and ink, and denied the liberty of
sending for witnesses. All these men, before they came
to the bar, were condemned in the opinions of the
judges, jury, and spectators; and to be a jesuit, or
even a Catholic, was of itself a sufficient▪ proof of
guilt. The chief justice<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Sir William Scrogges.</NOTE> in particular gave sanction to
all the narrow prejudices and bigotted fury of the popu∣lace.
Instead of being council for the prisoners, as his
office required, he pleaded the cause against them, brow∣beat
their witnesses, and on every occasion represented
their guilt as certain and uncontroverted. He even went
so far as publicly to affirm, that the Papists had not the
same principles which Protestants have, and therefore
were not entitled to that common credence, which the
principles and practices of the latter call for. And when
the jury brought in their verdict against the prisoners,
he said, “You have done, gentlemen, like very good
subjects, and very good Christians, that is to fay,
like very good Protestants: And now much good may
their 30,000 masses do them.” Alluding to the masses,
by which Pickering was to be rewarded for murdering
the King.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1679.</NOTE> All these unhappy men went to execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of Ja∣nuary.</NOTE> protesting their innocence; a circumstance, which
made no impression on the spectators. The opinion,

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>

that the jesuits allowed of lies and mental reservations <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the promotion of a good cause, was at this time so uni∣versally
received, that no credit was given to testimony
delivered either by that order, or by any of their disci∣ples.
It was forgot, that all the conspirators, engage
in the gun-powder-treason, and Garnet, the jesuit
among the rest, had freely on the scafford made confes∣sion
of their guilt.</P>
<P>THO' Bedloe had given information of Godfrey's mur∣der,
he still remained a single evidence against the per∣sons
accused; and all the allurements of profit and ho∣nour
had not hitherto tempted any one to confirm the
testimony of that informer. At last, means were found
to compleat the legal evidence. One Prance, a silver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>smith,
and a Catholic, had been accused by Bedloe o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
being an accomplice in that murder; and upon his de∣nial
had been thrown into prison, loaded with heavy
irons, and confined to the condemned hole, a place cold<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
dard, and full of nastiness. Such rigours were supposed
to be exercised by orders from the secret committee of
lords, particularly Shaftesbury and Buckingham; who▪
in examining the prisoners, usually employed (as 'tis
said, and indeed sufficiently proved) threatenings and
promises, rigour and indulgence, and every art, under
pretence of extorting the truth from them. Prance had not courage to resist, but confessed himself an accom∣plice
in Godfrey's murder. Being asked concerning the
plot, he also thought proper to be acquainted with it,
and conveyed some intelligence to the council. Among
other absurd circumstances, he said, that one Le Fevre
bought a second-hand sword of him; because he knew
not, as he said, what times were at hand: And Prance,
expressing some concern for poor tradesmen, if such
times came; Le Fevre replied, that it would be better
for tradesmen, if the catholic religion was restored:
And particularly, that there would be more church
<PB N="91" REF="119"/>
work for silversmiths. But all this information, with
regard to the plot as well as the murder of Godfrey,
Prance solemnly retracted, both before the King and
the secret committee: And being again thrown into
prison, he was induced, by new terrors and new suffer∣ings,
to confirm his first information, and was now pro∣duced
as a sufficient evidence.</P>
<P>HILL, Green and Berry were tried for Godfrey's
murder; all of them men of law station. Hill was ser∣vant
to a physician: The other two belonged to the po∣pish
chapel at Somerset House. It is needless to run
over all the particulars of a long trial: It will be suf∣ficient
to say, that Bedloe's evidence and Prance's were
in many circumstances totally irreconcileable; that both
of them laboured under unsurmountable difficulties, not
to say gross absurdities; and that they were invalidated
by contrary evidence, which is altogether convincing.
But all was in vain. The prisoners were condemned
and executed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">February 21st and 28th.</NOTE> They all denied their guilt at their exe∣cution;
and as Berry died a Protestant, this circum∣stance
was regarded as very considerable: But instead of
giving some check to the general credulity of the people,
men were only surprized, that a Protestant could be
induced at his death to persist in so manifest a falshood.</P>
<P>AS the army could neither be kept up, nor disbanded
without money, the King, however little hopes he
could entertain of more compliance, found himself
obliged to summon a new Parliament. The blood, al∣ready
shed on account of the popish plot, instead of
satiating the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New elec∣tions.</NOTE> served only as an incentive to their
fury; and each conviction of a criminal was hitherto
regarded as a new proof of those horrible designs, ascribed
to the Papists▪ This election is perhaps the first in
England, which, since the commencement of the Mo∣narchy,
had been carried on by a violent contest be∣tween
the parties, and where the court interested itself,

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="92" REF="122"/>
to a high degree, in the choice of the national represen∣tatives.
But all its efforts were fruitless, in opposition
to the torrent of prejudices, which prevailed. Religion,
liberty, property, even the lives of men were now sup∣posed to be at stake; and no security, it was thought,
except in a vigilant Parliament, could be found against
the impious and bloody conspirators. Were there any
part of the nation, to which the ferment, occasioned by
the popish plot, had not as yet propagated itself; the
new elections, by interesting the whole people in na∣tional
concerns, tended to diffuse it into the remotest
corner; and the consternation, universally excited,
proved an excellent engine for influencing the electors.
All the zealots of the former Parliament were re-chosen:
New ones were added: The Presbyterians in particular,
being transported with the most inveterate antipathy against
popery, were very active and very successful in the elec∣tions.
That party, it is said, first began at this time
the abuse of splitting their freeholds, in order to multi∣ply
the votes of electors. By accounts, which came
from every part of England, it was concluded, that the
new representatives would, if possible, exceed the old
in their refractory opposition to the court, and furious
persecution of the Catholics.</P>
<P>THE King was alarmed, when he saw so dreadful a
tempest arise from such small and unaccountable begin∣nings.
His life, if Oates and Bedloe's information was
true, had been aimed at by the Catholics: Even the
Duke's was in danger: The higher, therefore, the rage
mounted against popery, the more should the nation
have been reconciled to these two princes, in whom,
it appeared, the church of Rome reposed no confidence.
But there is a sophistry, which attends all the passions;
especially those into which the populace enter. Men
gave credit to the informers, so far as concerned the
guilt of the Catholics: But they still retained their old
<PB N="93" REF="123"/>
suspicions, that these religionists were secretly favoured
by the King, and had obtained the most entire ascendant
over his brother. Charles had too much penetration not
to see the danger, to which the succession, and even his
own crown and dignity, now stood exposed A nume∣rous
party, he found, was formed against him; on the
one hand, composed of a populace, so credulous from
prejudice, so blinded with religious antipathy, as impli∣citly
to believe the most palpable absurdities; and con∣ducted,
on the other hand, by leaders so little scrupu∣lous,
as to endeavour, by encouraging perjury, subor∣nation,
lyes, impostures; and even by shedding innocent
blood, to gratify their own furious ambition, and sub∣vert
all legal authority. Rouzed from his lethargy by
so imminent a peril, he began to exert that vigour of
mind, of which on great occasions he was not destitute;
and without quitting in appearance his usual facility of tem∣per,
he collected an industry, firmness, vigilance, of which he
was believed altogether incapable. These qualities, joined
to dexterity and judgment, conducted him happily thro'
the many shoals, which surrounded him; and he was at
last able to make the storm fall on the heads of those who
had blindly raised, or artificially conducted it.</P>
<P>ONE chief step, which the King; took, towards grati∣fying
and appeasing his people and Parliament, was, de∣siring
the Duke to withdraw beyond sea, that no far∣ther
suspicion might remain of the influence of popish
councils. The Duke readily complied; but first re∣quired
an order for that purpose, signed by the King
lest his absence should be interpreted as a proof of fear
or of guilt. He also desired, that his brother should
satisfy him, as well as the public, by a public decla∣ration
of the illegitimacy of the Duke of Monmouth.</P>
<P>JAMES Duke of Monmouth was the King's natural
son by Lucy Walters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Monmouth.</NOTE> and born about ten years before
the restoration. He possessed all the qualities, which
<PB N="94" REF="124"/>
could engage the affections of the populace; a distinguish∣ed
valour, an affable-address, a thoughtless generosity
a graceful person. He rose still higher in the public fa∣vour,
by reason of the universal hatred, to which the
Duke, on account of his religion, was exposed. Mon∣mouth's
capacity was mean; his temper pliant: So that
notwithstanding his great popularity, he had never been
dangerous, had he not implicitly resigned himself over
to the guidance of Shaftesbury, a man of such a restless
temper, such subtle wit, and such abandoned principles.
That daring politician had flattered Monmouth with the
hopes of succeeding to the crown. The story of a con∣tract
of marriage, passed between the King and Mon∣mouth's
mother, and secretly kept in a certain <HI>black box;</HI>
had been industriously spread abroad, and was greedily
received by the multitude. As the horrors of popery still
pressed harder on them, they might be induced, either
to adopt that fiction, as they had already done many
others more incredible, or to commit open violation on
the right of succession. And it would not be difficult, it
was hoped to persuade the King, who was extremely fond
of his son, to give him the preference above a brother,
who by his imprudent bigotry, had involved him in such
inextricable difficulties. But Charles, in order to cut off
all such expectations, as well as to remove the Duke's
apprehensions, took care, in full council, to declare
Monmouth's illegitimacy, and to deny all promise of
marriage to his mother.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of York retires to Brussels.</NOTE> The Duke, being gratify'd in
so reasonable a request, willingly complied with the
King's desire, and retired to Brussels.</P>
<P>BUT the king soon found, that, notwithstanding this
precaution, notwithstanding his concurrence in the pro∣secution
of the popish plot, notwithstanding the zeal
which he expressed, and even at this time exercised against
the Catholics; he had no wise obtained the confidence of
his Parliament. The refractory humour of the Com∣mons
<PB N="95" REF="125"/>
appeared in the first step, which they took upon
their assembling. It had ever been usual for the Com∣mons,
in the election of their speaker, to consult the
inclinations of the Sovereign; and even the long Par∣liament
in 1641 had not thought proper to depart from
so established a custom. The King now desired, that
the choice should fall on Sir Thomas Meres; But Sey∣mour,
speaker to the last Parliament, was instantly
called to the chair, by a vote which seemed unanimous.
The King, when Seymour was presented to him for his
approbation, rejected him, and ordered the Commons
to proceed to a new choice. A great flame was ex∣cited.
The Commons maintained, that the King's ap∣probation
was merely a form, and that he could not,
without giving a reason▪ reject the speaker chosen: The
King, that, since he had the power of rejecting, he
might, if he pleased, keep the reason in his own breast.
As the question had never before been started, it might
seem difficult to find principles, upon which it could be
decided<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">In 1566, the Speaker said to Q. Elizabeth, that without her allowance the election of the house was of no significance. D'Ewes's Journal, p. 97. In the Parliament 1592, 1593, the Speaker, who was Sir Edward Coke, advances a like position. D'Ewes, p. 459. Townshend; p. 35. So that this preten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on of the Commons seems to have been somewhat new; like many of their other powers and privileges.</NOTE>. By way of compromise, it was agreed to set
aside both candidates. Gregory, a lawyer, was chosen;
and the election was ratified by the King. It has ever
since been understood, that the choice of the speaker lies
in the House; but that the King retains the Power of
rejecting any one disagreeable to him.</P>
<P>SEYMOUR was deemed a great enemy to Danby; and
it was the influence of that nobleman, as commonly sup∣posed,
which had engaged the King to enter into this ill∣time
controversy with the Commons. The impeach∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Danby's impeach∣ment.</NOTE> therefore, of Danby was on that account the
<PB N="96" REF="126"/>
sooner revived; and it was maintained by the Com∣mons,
that, notwithstanding the intervening dissolution,
every part of that procedure stood in the same condition
in which it had been left by the last Parliament: A pre∣tension
which, tho' unusual, seems tacitly to have been
yielded them. The King had before hand had the pre∣caution
to grant a pardon to Danby; and, in order to
screen the chancellor from all attacks by the Commons,
he had taken the seal into his own hand, and had him∣self
affixed it to the parchment. He told the Parliament,
that as Danby had acted in every thing by his orders, he
was no wife criminal; that his pardon, however, he
would insist upon; and if it should be found any way de∣fective
in form, he would renew it again and again, till
it should be rendered entirely compleat: But that he
was resolved to deprive him of all employments, and to
remove him from court.</P>
<P>The Commons were no wise satisfied with this con∣cession.
They pretended that no pardon of the Crown
could be pleaded in bar of an impeachment by the Com∣mons.
The prerogative of mercy had been hitherto un∣derstood
to be altogether unlimited in the king; and
this pretension of the Commons, it must be confessed,
was entirely new. It was however very suitable to the
genius of a Monarchy, strictly limited; where the
King's ministers are supposed to be for ever accountable
to national assemblies, even for such abuses of power as
they may commit by orders from their master. The pre∣sent
emergence, while the nation was so highly inflamed,
was the proper time for pushing such popular claims;
and the Commons failed not to avail themselves of this
advantage. They still insisted on the impeachment of
Danby. The Peers, in compliance with them, depart∣ed
from their former scruples, and ordered Danby to be
taken into custody. Danby withdrew. The Commons
passed a bill, appointing him to surrender himself before
<PB N="97" REF="127"/>
a certain day, or, in default of it, attainting him. A
bill had passed the upper House, mitigating the penalty
to banishment; but after some conferences, the Peers
thought proper to yield to the violence of the Commons;
and the bill of attainder was carried. Rather than un∣dergo
such severe penalties, Danby appeared, and was
immediately committed to the Tower.</P>
<P>WHILE a protestant nobleman met with such severe
prosecution, it was not likely that the Catholics would
be over-looked by the zealous Commons. The credit
of the popish plot still stood upon the oaths of a few in∣famous
witnesses.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Popish plot.</NOTE> Tho' such immense preparations
were supposed to have been made in the very bowels of
the kingdom, no traces of them, after the most rigorous
enquiry, had as yet appeared. Tho' so many thousands,
both abroad and at home, had been engaged in the dread∣ful
secret; neither hope, nor fear, nor remorse, nor le∣vity,
nor suspicions, nor private resentment had engaged
any-one to confirm the evidence. Tho' the Catholics;
particularly the jesuits, were represented as guilty of the
utmost indiscretion, insomuch that they talked of the
King's murder as common news, and wrote of it in plain
terms by the common post; yet, among the great num∣ber
of letters seized, no-one contained any part of so
complicated a conspiracy. Tho' the informers pretend∣ed,
that, even after they had resolved to betray the secret,
many treasonable commissions and papers had passed thro'
their hands; they had not had the precaution to keep
any one of them, in order to fortify their evidence. But
all these difficulties, and a thousand more, were not
found too hard of digestion by the nation and Parliament.
The prosecution and farther discovery of the plot were
still the object of general concern. The Commons vot∣ed,
that, if the King should come to an untimely end,
they would revenge his death upon the Papists; not
reflecting that that sect were not his only enemies.
<PB N="98" REF="128"/>
They promised rewards to new discoverers; not consider∣ing
the danger, which they incurred, of granting bribes
to perjury. They made Bedloe a present of 500 pounds;
and particularly recommended the care of his safety to
the duke of Monmouth. Colonel Sackville, a member,
having, in a private company, spoke opprobriously of
those who affirmed that there was any plot, was expelled
the House. The Peers gave power to their committees
to send for and examine such as would maintain the in∣nocence
of those condemned for the plot. A pamphlet
having been published to discredit the informers, and to
vindicate the catholic lords in the Tower, these lords
were required to discover the author, and thereby to ex∣pose their own advocate to prosecuation. And both Houses
concurred in renewing the former vote, that the Papists
had undoubtedly entered into a <HI>horrid</HI> and <HI>treasonable</HI> con∣spiracy
against the King, the state, and the protestant
religion.</P>
<P>IT must be owned, that this extreme violence, in pro∣secution
of so absurd an imposture, disgraces the noble
cause of liberty, in which the Parliament was engaged.
We may even conclude from such impatience of contra∣diction,
that the prosecutors themselves retained a secret
suspicion, that the general belief was but ill grounded.
The politicians among them were afraid to let in light,
lest it might put an end to so useful a delusion: The
weaker and less dishonest party took care, by turning their
eyes aside, not to see a truth, so opposite to those furious
passions, by which they were actuated, and in which
they were determined obstinately to persevere.</P>
<P>SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE had been lately recalled from
his foreign employments; and the King, who, after the
removal of Danby, had no one with whom he could so
much as discourse with freedom of public affairs, was
resolved, upon Coventry's dismission, to make him one
of his secretaries of state. But that philosophical patriot,
<PB N="99" REF="129"/>
too little interested for the intrigues of a court, too full
of spleen and delicacy, for the noisy turbulence of po∣pular
assemblies, was alarmed at the universal discon∣tents
and jealousies, which prevailed, and was deter∣mined
to make his retreat, as soon as possible, from a
scene which threatened so much confusion. Mean-while,
he could not refuse the confidence with which his master
honoured him; and he resolved to employ it to the public
service. He represented to the King, that, as the jea∣lousies
of the nation were extreme, it was necessary to
cure them by some new remedy, and to restore that con∣fidence,
so requisite for the safety both of King and peo∣ple:
That to refuse every thing to the Parliament in their
present disposition, or to yield every thing, was equally
dangerous to the constitution and to public tranquillity:
That if the King would introduce into his councils such
men as enjoyed the confidence of his people, fewer con∣cessions
would probably be required; or if exorbitant de∣mands
were made, the King, under the sanction of such
counsellors, might be enabled, with the greater safety, to
refuse them: And that the heads of the popular party,
being gratified with the King's favour, would probably
abate of that violence, by which they endeavoured at
present to pay court to the multitude.</P>
<P>THE King assented to all these reasons; and, in con∣cert
with Temple, he laid the plan of a new privy-coun∣cil,
without whose advice he declared himself determined
for the future to take no measures of importance. This
council was to consist of thirty persons, and was never
to exceed that number. Fifteen of the chief officers of
the crown were to be continued, who, it was supposed,
would adhere to the King, and, in case of any extre∣mity,
oppose the exorbitancies of saction. The other
part of the council was to be composed, either of men of
character, detached from the court, or of those who pos∣sessed
chief credit in both Houses. And the King, in
<PB N="100" REF="130"/>
filling up the names of his new council, was glad to find,
that the members, in land and offices, possessed to the
amount of 300,000 pounds a year; a sum nearly equal
to the whole property of the House of Commons, against
whose violence the new council was intended as a barrier
to the throne<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Their names were: Prince Rupert, the archbishop of Canterbury, lord Finch chancellor, earl of Shaftesbury, president, earl of Angle∣sea, privy seal, duke of Albemarle, duke of Monmouth, duke of Neweastle, duke of Lauderdale, duke of Ormond, marquess of Winchester, marquess of Worcester, earl of Arlington, earl of Salisbury, earl of Bridgwa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> earl of Sunderland, earl of Essex, earl of Bath, viscount Falconberg, viscount Halifax, bishop of London, lord Robarts, lord Hollis, lord Russel, lord Cavendish, secretary Coventry, Sir Francis North, chief justice, Sir Henry Capel, Sir John Erneley, Sir Thomas Chichely, Sir William Tem∣ple, Edward Seymour, Henry Powle.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS experiment was tried, and seemed at first to
give some satisfaction to the public. The earl of Essex,
a nobleman of the popular party, son to that lord Capel
who had been beheaded a little after the late King, was
made treasure in place of Danby. The earl of Sunder∣land,
a man of intrigue and great capacity, was made
secretary of state: the viscount Halifax, a fine genius,
possessed of learning, eloquence, industry, but subject to
inquietude, and fond of refinements, was admitted into
the council. These three, together with Temple, who
often joined them, though he kept himself more detached
from public business, formed a kind of cabinet council,
from which all affairs received their first digestion. Shaf∣tesbury
was made president of the council; contrary to
the advice of Temple, who foretold the consequence of
admitting a man of so dangerous a character into any
part of the public administration.</P>
<P>As Temple foresaw, it happened. Shaftesbury, find∣ing
that he possessed no more than the appearance of
court-favour, was resolved still to adhere to the popular
<PB N="101" REF="131"/>
party, by whose confidence he enjoyed an undisputed su∣periority
in the lower House, and possessed great influence
over the other. The very appearance of court-favour,
empty as it was, tended to render him more dangerous.
His partizans, observing the progress which he had alrea∣dy
made, hoped, that he would soon acquire the entire
ascendant; and he constantly flattered them, that, if
they persisted in their purposes, the King, from indo∣lence,
and necessity, and fondness for Monmouth, would
at last be induced, even at the expence of his brother's
right, to make them every concession.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the antipathy to popery, as well as jealousy
of the King and Duke, had taken too fast possession of
men's minds, to be removed by so feeble a remedy, as
this new council, projected by Temple. The Com∣mons,
soon after the declaration of that council, pro∣ceeded
so far as to vote unanimously, “That the Duke of
York's being a papist, and the hopes of his coming to
the crown, had given the highest countenance to the
present conspiracies and designs of the papists against
the king and the protestant religion.” It was expected,
that a bill for excluding him the throne would soon be
brought in. To prevent this bold measure, the King
concerted some limitations, which he proposed to the
Parliament. He introduced his plan by the following
gracious expressions: “And to shew you, that, while
you are doing your parts, my thoughts have not been
misemployed, but that it is my constant care to do every
thing, that may preserve your religion, and secure it
for the future in all events, I have commanded my lord
chancellor to mention several particulars; which, I
hope, will be an evidence, that, in all things, which
concern the public security, I shall not follow your
zeal, but lead it.”</P>
<P>THE limitations projected were of the utmost impor∣tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limitations on a popish successor.</NOTE>
and deprived the successor of the chief branches

<PB N="101" REF="133"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="102" REF="134"/>
of royalty. A method was there chalked out, by which
the nation, on every new reign, could be ensured of
having a Parliament, which the King should not, for a
certain time, have it in his power to dissolve. In case
of a popish successor, the prince was to forfeit the right
of conferring any ecclesiastical preferments: No member
of the privy council, no judge of the common law or in
chancery, was to be put in or displaced but by consent of
Parliament: And the same precaution was extended to
the military part of the government; to the lord lieu∣tenant
and deputy lieutenant of the counties, and to all
officers of the navy. The chancellor, of himself added,
“It is hard to invent another restraint; considering how
much the revenue will depend upon the consent of
Parliament, and how impossible it is to raise money
without such consent. But yet, if any thing else can
occur to the wisdom of the Parliament, which may
farther secure religion and liberty against a popish suc∣cessor,
without defeating the right of succession it∣self,
his majesty will readily consent to it.“</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that, when these limitations were
first laid before the council, Shaftesbury and Temple were
the only members, who argued against them. The rea∣sons,
which they employed, were diametrically opposite.
Shaftesbury's opinion was, that the restraints were insuf∣ficient;
and that nothing but the total exclusion of the
duke could give a proper security to the kingdom. Tem∣ple
on the other hand thought, that the restraints were
so rigorous as even to subvert the constitution; and that
shackles, put upon a popish successor, would not after∣wards
be easily cast off by a protestant. It is certain,
that the Duke was extremely alarmed when he heard of
this step taken by the King, and that he was better
pleased even with the bill of exclusion itself, which, he
thought, by reason of its violence and injustice, could
never possibly take place. There is also reason to be∣lieve,
<PB N="103" REF="135"/>
that the King would not have gone so far, had he
not expected from the extreme fury of the Commons,
that his concessions would be rejected, and that the blame
of not forming a reasonable accommodation would by
that means lie entirely at their door.</P>
<P>IT soon appeared, that Charles had entertained a just
opinion of the disposition of the House. So much were
the Commons actuated by the cabals of Shaftesbury and
other malecontents; such violent antipathy prevailed
against popery, that the King's concessions, tho' much more
important than could reasonably have been expected,
were not embraced.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill of ex∣clusion.</NOTE> A bill was brought in for the total
exclusion of the Duke from the crown of England and
Ireland. It was declared that the sovereignty of these
kingdoms, upon the King's death or resignation, should
devolve to the person next in succession after the Duke;
that all acts of royalty, which that Prince should after∣wards
perform, should not only be void, but be deemed
treason; and that if he so much as entered any of these
dominions, he should be deemed guilty of the same of∣fence;
and that all who supported his title, should be
punished as rebels and traitors. This important bill,
which implied banishment as well as exclusion, passed
the lower House by a majority of seventy-nine.</P>
<P>THE Commons were not so wholly employed about
the exclusion-bill as to overlook all other securities to li∣berty.
The country party, during all the last Parlia∣ment,
had exclaimed much against the bribery and cor∣ruption
of the members: and the same reproach had
been renewed against the present Parliament. An en∣quiry
was made into a complaint, which was so dange∣rous
to the honour of that assembly; but very little foun∣dation
was found for it. Sir Stephen Fox, who was the
pay-master, confessed to the House, that nine members
received pensions to the amount of three thousand four
hundred pounds: And after a very rigorous enquiry by
<PB N="104" REF="136"/>
a secret committee, eight more pensioners were discovered.
A sum also, about twelve thousand pounds, had been
occasionally given or lent to others. The writers
of that age pretend, that Clifford and Danby had
adopted very opposite maxims with regard to pecu∣niary
influence. The former endeavoured to gain the
leaders and orators of the House, and deemed the others
of no consequence. The latter thought it sufficient to
gain a majority, however composed. It is likely, that
the means, rather than the intentions, were wanting to
both these ministers.</P>
<P>PENSIONS and bribes, tho' it be difficult entirely to
exclude them, are dangerous expedients for government;
and cannot be too carefully guarded against, nor too ve∣hemently
decried by every one who has a regard to the
virtue and liberty of a nation. The influence, however,
which the Crown acquires from the disposal of places,
honours, and preferments, is to be esteemed of a diffe∣rent
nature. This engine of power may become too
forcible, but it cannot altogether be abolished, without
the total destruction of monarchy, and even of all regu∣lar
authority. But the Commons at this time were so
jealous of the Crown, that they brought in a bill, which
was twice read, excluding from the lower House all
who possessed any lucrative offices.</P>
<P>THE standing army and the King's guards were by
the Commons voted to be illegal: A new pretension, it
must be confessed; but very necessary for the full security
of liberty and a limited constitution.</P>
<P>ARBITRARY imprisonment is a grievance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habeas cor∣pus bill.</NOTE> which, in
some degree, has place almost in every government, ex∣cept
in that of Britain; and our absolute security from
it we owe chiefly to the present Parliament; a merit,
which makes great atonement for the faction and violence,
into which their prejudices had, in other particulars, be∣trayed
them. The great charter had laid the foundation
<PB N="105" REF="137"/>
of this valuable part of liberty; the petition of right had
renewed and extended it; but many provisions were still
wanting, to render it complete, and prevent all evasion
or delay from ministers and judges. The act of <HI>habeas
corpus,</HI> passed this session, served these useful purposes.
By this act, it was prohibited to send any one to prisons
beyond sea. No judge, under severe penalties, must re∣fuse
to any prisoner a writ of <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> by which the
gaoler was directed to produce in court the body of the
prisoner (whence the writ has its name) and to certify
the cause of his detainer and imprisonment. If the
gaol lay within twenty miles of the judge, the writ must
be obeyed in three days; and so proportionably for
greater distances: Every prisoner must be indicted the
first term after his commitment, and brought to trial in
the subsequent term. And no man, after being enlarged
by order of court, can be recommitted for the same of∣fence.
This law is essentially necessary for the pro∣tection
of liberty in a mixed monarchy; and as it has
not place in any other form of government, this consi∣deration
alone may induce us to prefer our present con∣stitution
to all others. It must, however, be confessed,
that there is some difficulty to reconcile with such extreme
liberty the regular police of a state, especially that of
great cities.</P>
<P>DURING these zealous efforts for the protection of li∣berty,
no complaisance for the Crown was discovered
by this Parliament. The King's revenue lay under great
debts and anticipations: Those branches, granted in the
years 1669 and 1670, were ready to expire: And the
fleet was represented by the King to be in great decay
and disorder. But the Commons, instead of being af∣fected
by these distresses of the Crown, trusted chiefly to
them for passing the exclusion-bill, and for punishing
and displacing all the ministers, who were disagreeable
to them. They were therefore in no haste to relieve the
<PB N="106" REF="138"/>
King; and grew only the more assuming on account of
his complaints and uneasiness. Jealous however of the
army, they granted the same sum of 206,000 pounds,
which had been voted for disbanding it by the last Par∣liament;
tho' the vote, by reason of the subsequent pro∣rogation
and dissolution, joined to some scruples of the
Lords, had not been carried into an act. This money
was appropriated by very strict clauses; but the Com∣mons
insisted not as formerly upon its being paid into the
chamber of London.</P>
<P>THE impeachment of the five popish lords in the
Tower, with that of the earl of Danby, was carried on
with great vigour. The power of that minister and his
credit with the King, made him extremely obnoxious
to the popular leaders; and the Commons hoped, that
if he was push'd to extremity, he would be obliged, in
order to justify his own conduct, to lay open the whole
intrigue of the French alliance, which they suspected to
contain a secret of the most dangerous nature. The King
on his side, apprehensive of the same consequences, and
desirous to protect his minister, who was become crimi∣nal
merely by obeying orders, employed his whole inte∣rest
to support the validity of that pardon, which had
been granted him. The Lords appointed a day for the
examination of this question, and agreed to hear coun∣cil
on both sides: But the Commons would not submit
their pretensions to the discussion of argument and en∣quiry.
They voted, that whoever should presume,
without their leave, to maintain before the House
of Peers the validity of Danby's pardon, should be ac∣counted
a betrayer of the liberties of the English Com∣mons.
And they made a demand, that the bishops,
whom they knew to be devoted to the court, should be
removed, not only when the trial of the earl should come
on, but also when the validity of his pardon should be
discussed.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="139"/>
THE bishops before the reformation had always en∣joyed
a seat in Parliament: But so far were they anti∣ently
from regarding that dignity as a privilege, that they
affected rather to form a separate order in the state, quite
independant of the civil magistrate, and accountable
only to the pope and to their own order. By the consti∣tutions,
however, of Clarendon, enacted during the
reign of Henry II. they were obliged to give their pre∣sence
in Parliament; but as the canon law prohibited
them from assisting in the trials of life and death, they
were allowed in such cases the privilege of absenting
themselves. A practice, which was at first merely vo∣luntary,
became afterwards a rule; and on the earl of
Strafford's trial, the bishops, who would gladly have at∣tended,
and who were no longer bound by the canon-law,
were yet obliged to withdraw. It had always been
usual for them to enter a protestation of their right to
fit; and this protestation, being considered as a mere
form, was always admitted and disregarded. But here
was started a new question of no small importance. The
Commons, who were now enabled, by the violence of
the people, and the necessities of the crown, to make
new acquisitions of powers and privileges, insisted, that
the bishops had no more title to vote in the question of
the earl's pardon than in the impeachment itself. The
bishops asserted, that the pardon was merely a prelimi∣nary;
and that, neither by the canon-law nor the prac∣tice
of Parliament, were they ever obliged, in capital
cases, to remove, till the very commencement of the
trial itself. If their absence was considered as a privilege,
which was its real origin, it depended on their own
choice, how far they would insist upon it. If regarded
as a diminution of their right of peerage, such unfavou∣rable
customs ought never to be extended beyond the very
circumstance established by them; and all arguments,
from a pretended parity of reason, were in that case of
little or no authority.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="140"/>
THE House of Lords were so much influenced by
these reasons, that they admitted the bishops' right to
vote, when the validity of the pardon should be exa∣mined.
The Commons insisted still on their withdraw∣ing;
and thus a quarrel being commenced between the
two Houses, the King, who expected nothing but fresh
instances of violence from this Parliament, began to en∣tertain
thoughts of laying hold of so favourable a pre∣tence,
and of finishing the session by a prorogation.
While in this disposition, he was alarmed with sudden
intelligence, that the House of Commons were preparing
a remonstrance, in order to inflame the nation still far∣ther
upon the favourite topics of the plot and of popery.
He hastened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th of May.</NOTE> therefore, to execute his intention, even
without consulting his new council, by whose advice he
had promised to regulate his whole conduct. And thus
were disappointed all the projects of the malecontents,
whe were extremely enraged at this vigorous measure
of the King. Shaftesbury publicly threatened, that he
would have the head of whoever had advised it. The
Parliament was soon after dissolved without advice of
council;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prorogation and disso∣lution of the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and a new Parliament ordered to be chosen.
The King was willing to try every means, which gave
a prospect of more compliance in his subjects;<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of July.</NOTE> and, in
case of failure, the blame, he hoped, would lie on those
whose obstinacy forced him to extremities.</P>
<P>BUT even during the recess of Parliament, there was
no interruption to the prosecution of the Catholics ac∣cused
of the plot. The King, contrary to his own judg∣ment,
found himself obliged to give way to this popular
fury. Whitebread, provincial of the jesuits, Fenwic,
Gavan, Turner, and Harcourt, all of them of the same
order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and execution of the five je∣suits.</NOTE> were first brought to their trial. Besides Oates
and Bedloe, Dugdale, a new witness, appeared against
the prisoners. This man had been steward to lord
Aston, and, tho' poor, possessed somewhat a more repu∣table
<PB N="109" REF="141"/>
character than the other two: But his account of
the intended massacres and assassinations was equally
monstrous and incredible. He even asserted, that 200,000
Papists in England were ready to take arms. The pri∣soners
proved by sixteen witnesses from St. Omer's,
students and most of them young men of family,
that Oates was in that seminary, at the time when he
swore that he was in London: But as they were Catho∣lics
and disciples of the jesuits, their testimony, both
with the judges and the jury, was totally disregarded.
Even the reception, which they met with in court, was
full of outrage and mockery. One of them saying, that
Oates always continued at St. Omer's, if he could believe
his senses: “You Papists,” said the chief justice, “are
taught not to believe your senses.” It must be con∣fessed,
that Oates, in opposition to the students of St.
Omer's, found means to bring evidence of his having
been at that time in London: But this evidence, tho' it
had, at the time, the appearance of some solidity, was
afterwards discovered, when Oates himself was tried for
perjury, to be altogether deceitful. In order farther
to discredit that witness, the jesuits proved by undoubt∣ed
testimony, that he had perjured himself in father Ire∣land's
trial, whom they shewed to have been in Stafford∣shir
at the very time when Oates swore, that he was
committing treason in London. But all these pleas
availed them nothing against the general prejudices.
They received sentence of death; and were executed,
persisting to their last breath in the most solemn, earnest,
and deliberate, tho' disregarded protestations of their
innocence.</P>
<P>THE next trial was that of Langhorne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And of Langhorne.</NOTE> an eminent
lawyer, by whom all the concerns of the jesuits were
managed. Thro' his hands, Oates and Bedloe swore,
all the papal commissions passed; by which the chief of∣fices
in England were supplied with Catholics. When
<PB N="110" REF="142"/>
verdict was given against the prisoner, the audience ex∣pressed
their savage joy by loud acclamations. So high
indeed had the popular rage mounted, that the witnesses
for this unhappy man, on approaching the court, were
almost torne in pieces by the rabble: One in particular
was bruised to such a degree, as to put his life in danger.
And another, a woman, declared, that, unless the court
could afford her protection, she durst not give evidence:
But as the judges could go no farther than promise to pu∣nish
such as should injure her, the prisoner himself had
the humanity to wave her testimony.</P>
<P>So far the informers had proceeded with success:
Their accusation was hitherto equivalent to a sentence of
death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wakeman acquitted.</NOTE> The first check, which they received, was on
the trial of Sir George Wakeman the Queen's physician,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of July.</NOTE>
whom they accused of an intention to poison the King.
It was a strong circumstance in favour of Wakeman,
that Oates, in his first information before the council,
had accused him only upon hearsay; and when asked by
the chancellor, whether he had any thing farther to
charge him with, he added, “God forbid I should say
any thing against Sir George: For I know nothing
more against him.” On the trial he gave positive
evidence of the prisoner's guilt. There were many
other circumstances which favoured Wakeman: But
what chiefly contributed to his acquittal, was the con∣nexion
of his cause with that of the Queen, whom no∣one,
even during the highest prejudices of the times,
could sincerely believe guilty. The great importance
of the trial made men recollect themselves, and recall that
good sense and humanity, which seemed during some∣time
to have abandoned the nation. The chief justice him∣self,
who had hitherto favoured the witnesses, exagge∣rated
the plot, and railed against the prisoners, was ob∣served
to be considerably mollified, and to give a favour∣able
charge to the jury. Oates and Bedloe had the as∣surance
<PB N="111" REF="143"/>
to attack him to his face, and even to accuse
him of partiality before the council. The whole party
who had formerly much extolled his conduct, made him
the great object of their resentment. Wakeman's ac∣quittal
was indeed a sensible mortification to the furious
prosecutors of the plot, and fixed an indelible stain upon
the witnesses. But Wakeman, after he recovered his
liberty, finding himself exposed to such inveterate en∣mity,
and being threatened with farther prosecutions,
thought it prudent to retire beyond sea: And his flight
was interpreted as a proof of guilt, by those who were
still rsolved to persist in the belief of the conspiracy.</P>
<P>THE great discontents in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of af∣fairs in Scot∣land.</NOTE> and the refractory
disposition of the Parliament, excited the hopes of the
Scots covenanters, and gave them some prospect of an
end to those grievous oppressions, under which they had
so long laboured. It was suspected to have been the po∣licy
of Lauderdale and his associates to push these un∣happy
men to extremity, and force them into rebellion,
with a view of reaping profit from the forfeitures and
attainders, which would ensue upon it. But the co∣venanters,
aware of this policy, had hitherto forborne
all acts of hostility; and that tyrannical minister had
failed of his purpose. An incident at last happened,
which brought on an insurrection in that country.</P>
<P>THE covenanters were much enraged against Sharpe,
the primate, whom they considered as an apostate from
their principles, and whom they experienced to be an
unrelenting persecutor of all those who dissented from
the established worship. He had an officer under him,
one Carmichael, no less zealous than himself against all
conventicles, and who by his violent prosecutions had
rendered himself extremely obnoxious to the fanatics.
A company of these had way-laid him on the road near<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of May.</NOTE>
St. Andrews, with an intention, if not of killing him,
at least of beating him so severely as would afterwards
<PB N="112" REF="144"/>
render him more cautious in persecuting the Non-con∣formists<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Wodrow's history of the sufferings of the church of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 28.</NOTE>.
While looking out for their prey, they were
surprized at seeing the archbishop's coach pass by; and
they immediately interpreted this incident as a declaration
of the secret purpose of Providence against him. But
when they observed, that almost all his servants, by
some accident, were absent, they no longer doubted,
that heaven had here delivered their capital enemy into
their hands. Without farther deliberation, they fell
upon him; dragged him from his coach; tore him from
the arms of his daughter, who interposed with cries and
tears; and piercing him with redoubled wounds, left
him dead on the spot, and immediately dispersed them∣selves.</P>
<P>THIS atrocious action served the ministry as a pre∣tence
for a more violent persecution against the fanatics,
on whom, without distinction, they laid the guilt of
those furious assassins. It is indeed certain, that the mur∣der
of Sharpe had excited an universal joy among the
covenanters, and that their blind zeal had often led
them, in their books and sermons, to praise and recom∣mend
the assassination of their enemies, whom they con∣sidered
as the enemies of all true piety and godliness.
The stories of Jael and Sisera, of Ehud and Eglon, re∣sounded
from every pulpit. The officers, quartered in
the west, received more strict orders to find out and dis∣perse
all conventicles; and for that reason the covenan∣ters,
instead of meeting in small bodies, were obliged to
celebrate their worship in numerous assemblies, and to
bring arms for their security. At Rutherglen, a small
borough near Glasgow, they openly set forth a declara∣tion
against prelacy, and in the market-place burned se∣veral
acts of Parliament and acts of council, which had
established prelacy, and prohibited all conventicles. For
<PB N="113" REF="145"/>
this insult on government, they purposely chose the 29th
of May, the anniversary of the restoration; and previ∣ously
extinguished the bonfires, which had been kind∣led
for that solemnity.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Graham, afterwards viscount Dundee, an
active and enterprizing officer, attacked a great conven∣ticle
upon Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don-hill, and was repulsed with the loss
of thirty men. The covenanters finding that they were
unwarily involved in such deep guilt, were engaged to
persevere, and to seek from their valour and fortune alone
for that indemnity, which the severity of the government
left them no hopes of ever being a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e otherwise to ob∣tain.
They pushed on to Glasgow, and tho' at first re∣pused,
they afterwards made themselves masters of that
town; dispossessed all the established clergy; and issued
proclamations, in which they declared, that they fought
against the King's supremacy, against popery and prelacy,
and against a popish successor.</P>
<P>HOWEVER accidental this insurrection might appear,
there is reason to think, that some great men, in com∣bination
with the popular leaders in England, had se∣cretly
instigated the covenanters to proceed to such ex∣tremities<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Algernon Sidney's letters, p. 90.</NOTE>,
and hoped for the same effects as had forty
years before ensued from the disorders in Scotland.
The King also, apprehensive of like consequences, im∣mediately
dispatched Monmouth with a small body of
English cavalry. He joined the Scots guards, and some
regiments of militia, levied from the well affected coun∣ties;
and with great celerity marched towards the west
in quest of the rebels.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Bothwel-bridge.</NOTE> They had taken post at Both∣wel-bridge
between Hamilton and Glasgow; where
there was no access to them but over the bridge, which
a small body was able to defend against the King's
forces. They shewed great judgment in the choice of
their post; but discovered neither judgment nor valour
<PB N="114" REF="146"/>
in any other step of their conduct. No nobility and few
gentry had joined them: The ministers were in reality
the commanders; and the whole army never exceeded
8000 men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of June.</NOTE> Monmouth attacked the bridge; and the
body of insurgents who defended it, maintained their
post, as long as their ammunition lasted. When they
sent for more, they received orders to abandon their
ground, and to retire backwards. This imprudent mea∣sure
ruined the army of the covenanters. Monmouth
passed the bridge without opposition, and drew up in or∣der,
opposite to the enemy. His cannon alone put them
to rout. About 700 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell in the pursuit: For properly
speaking there was no action. Twelve hundred were
taken prisoners; and were treated by Monmouth with
an humanity, which they had never experienced in their
own countrymen. Such of them as would promise to
live peaceably under the government were dismissed.
About three hundred, who were so obstinate as to refuse
this easy condition, were shipped for Barbadoes; but
unfortunately perished in the voyage. Two of their
clergy were hanged. Monmouth was of a generous dis∣position;
and besides, aimed at popularity in Scotland.
The King intended to intrust the affairs of that kingdom
into his hands. He had married a Scots lady, heiress
of one of the most considerable families, and allied to
all the chief nobility. And Lauderdale, as he was now
declining in his parts, and was much decayed in his
memory, began to lose with the King, that influence
which he had maintained during so many years; not∣withstanding
all the efforts of his numerous enemies both
in Scotland and England, and notwithstanding the many
violent and tyrannical actions, of which he had been
guilty. Even at present he retained so much influence
as to poison all the good intentions, which the King,
either of himself or by Monmouth's suggestion, had
formed with regard to Scotland. An act of indemnity
<PB N="115" REF="147"/>
was granted; but the minister took care, that it should
rather afford protection to himself and his associates,
than to the unhappy covenanters. And tho' orders were
given to connive thenceforwards at all conventicles, he
found means, under a variety of pretences, to elude the
execution. It must be owned however to his praise,
that he was the chief person, who by his council hastened
the expeditious march of the forces and the prompt or∣ders
to Monmouth: and thereby disappointed all the
expectations of the English malecontents, who, reflect∣ing
on the dispositions of men's minds in both king∣doms,
had entertained great hopes from the progress of
the Scots insurrection.</P>

the bulk of the nation will always incline to preserve the

various prejudices, interests, and dispositions of men, some
will ever attach themselves with more passion to the re∣gal,
others to the popular part of the government. Tho'
the King after his restoration, had endeavoured to abo∣lish
the distinction of parties, and had chosen his mi∣nisters
from among all denominations; no sooner had he
lost his popularity, and exposed himself to general jea∣lousy,
than he found it requisite to court the old cavalier
party, and to promise them full compensation for that
neglect, of which they had hitherto complained. The
present emergence made it still more necessary for him
to apply for their support; and there were many circum∣stances,
which determined them, at this time, to fly to
the assistance of the crown, and to the protection of the
royal family.</P>
<P>A PARTY strongly attached to monarchy will natu∣rally
be jealous of the right of succession, by which alone,
they believe, stability to be preserved in the government,
and a barrier fixed to the encroachments of popular as∣semblies.
The project, openly embraced of excluding
the Duke, appeared to that party a dangerous innovation:
And the design, secretly projected, of advancing Mon∣mouth,
made them apprehensive, lest the inconvenien∣cies
of a disputed succession should be propagated to all
posterity. While the jealous lovers of liberty maintained,
that a King, whose title depended on the Parliament,
would naturally be more regardful of the interests and
humours of the people; the passionate admirers of mo∣narchy
<PB N="117" REF="151"/>
considered this dependance as a degradation of
kingly government, and a great step towards the esta∣blishment
of a commonwealth in England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the union of the political Royalists brought
great accession of force to the crown, Charles derived
no less support from the confederacy, which he had, at
this time, the address to form with the church of En∣gland.
He represented to the church the great number
of Presbyterians and other sectaries, who had entered into
the popular party; the encouragement and favour which
they met with; the loudness of their cries with regard
to popery and arbitrary power. And he made the esta∣blished
clergy and their adherents apprehend, that the
old scheme for the abolition of prelacy as well as mo∣narchy
was revived, and that the same miseries and
oppressions threatened them, to which, during the civil
wars and usurpations, they had so long been exposed.</P>
<P>THE memory also of these dismal times united many
indifferent and impartial persons to the Crown, and be∣got
a dread, lest the zeal for liberty should engraft itself
on fanaticism, and should once more kindle a civil war
in the kingdom. Had not the King still retained the
prerogative of dissolving the Parliament, there was in∣deed
reason to apprehend the renewal of all the preten∣sions
and violences, which had ushered in the last com∣motions.
The one period appeared an exact counter∣part
to the other: But still discerning judges could per∣ceive,
both in the spirit of the parties and in the genius
of the Prince, a very material difference; by means of
which Charles was enabled at last, tho' with the immi∣nent
peril of liberty, to preserve the peace of the nation.</P>
<P>THE cry against popery was very loud; but it pro∣ceeded
less from religious than from party zeal, in those
who propagated, and even in those who adopted it.
The spirit of enthusiasm had occasioned so much mis∣chief,
and had been so successfully exploded, that it was
<PB N="118" REF="152"/>
not possible, by any artifice, again to revive and sup∣port
it. Cant had been ridiculed; hypocrisy detected;
the pretensions to a more thorough reformation, and to
greater purity, had become suspicious; and instead of
denominating themselves the <HI>godly</HI> party, the appellation af∣fected
at the beginning of the civil wars, the present pa∣triots
were contented to call themselves the <HI>good</HI> and the
<HI>honest</HI> party<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. i. p. 335.</NOTE>: A sure prognostic, that their measures
were not to be so furious, nor their pretensions so exor∣bitant.</P>
<P>THE King too, tho' not endowed with the integrity
and strict principles of his father, was happy in a more
amiable manner, and more popular address. Far from
being distant, stately, or reserved, he had not a grain
of pride or vanity in his whole composition<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. i. p. 449.</NOTE>; but was
the most affable, best bred man alive. He treated his
subjects like noblemen, like gentlemen, like freemen;
not like vassals or boors. His professions were plausible,
his whole behaviour engaging; so that he won upon the
hearts, even while he lost the good opinion of his sub∣jects,
and often ballanced their judgment of things by
their personal inclination<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dis∣sertation on Parties, letter vii.</NOTE> In his public conduct like∣wise,
tho' he had sometimes embraced measures dange∣rous
to the liberty and religion of his people, he had
never been found to persevere obstinately in them, but
had always returned into that path, which their united
opinion seemed to point out to him. And upon the whole,
it seemed to many, cruel and even iniquitous, to re∣mark
too rigorously the failings of a prince, who disco∣vered
so much facility in correcting his errors, and so
much lenity in pardoning the offences committed against
himself.</P>
<P>THE general affection, which was borne the King,
appeared signally about this time. He fell sick at Wind∣sor;
<PB N="119" REF="153"/>
and had two or three fits of a fever, so violent as made
his life be thought in danger. A general amazement sei∣zed
all ranks of men, encreased by the apprehensions en∣tertained
of his successor. In the present disposition of
men's minds, the King's death, to use an expression of
Sir William Temple<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 342.</NOTE>, was regarded as the end of the
world. The malecontents, it was feared, would pro∣ceed
to extremities, and immediately kindle a civil war
in the kingdom. Either their entire success, or entire
failure, or even the ballance and contest of parties, seemed
all of them events equally fatal. The King's chief
counsellors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the ministry.</NOTE> therefore, Essex, Halifax, and Sunderland,
who stood on very bad terms with Shaftesbury and the
popular party, advised him to send secretly for the Duke,
that, in case of any sinister accident, that Prince might be
ready to assert his right against the opposition, which
he was likely to meet with. When the Duke arrived,
he found his brother out of danger; and it was agreed to
conceal the invitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of September.</NOTE> which he had received. His jour∣ney,
however, was attended with very important conse∣quences.
He prevailed on the King to disgrace Mon∣mouth,
whose projects were now known and avowed;
to deprive him of his command in the army; and to
send him beyond sea. He himself returned to Brussels;
but made a very short stay in that place. He obtained
leave to retire to Scotland, under pretence still of quiet∣ing
the apprehensions of the English nation; but really
with a purpose of securing that kingdom in his interests.</P>
<P>THO' Essex and Halifax had concurred in the resolution
of inviting over the Duke, they soon found, that they
had not obtained his confidence, and that even the King,
while he made use of their service, had no sincere re∣gard
for their persons. Essex in disgust resigned the Trea∣sury:
Halifax retired to his country-feat: Temple, de∣spairing
of any accommodation among such enraged par∣ties,
<PB N="120" REF="154"/>
withdrew almost entirely to his books and his gar∣dens.
The King, who changed ministers as well as
measures with great indifference, bestowed at this time
his chief confidence on Hyde, Sunderland, and Godol∣phin.
Hyde succeeded Essex in the treasury.</P>
<P>ALL the King's ministers, as well as himself, were
extremely averse to the meeting of the new Parliament,
which they expected to find as refractory as any of the
preceding.
The elections had gone mostly in favour of
the country party. The terrors of the plot had still
a mighty influence over the populace; and the appre∣hensions
of the Duke's bigotted principles and arbitrary
character, weighed with all men of sense and reflection.
The King therefore resolved to prorogue the Parliament,
that he might try, whether time would allay those hu∣mours,
which, by every other expedient, he had in vain
attempted to mollify. In this measure he did not expect
the concurrence of his council. He knew, that those
popular leaders, whom he had admitted, would zealously
oppose a resolution, which disconcerted all their schemes;
and that the royalists would not dare, by supporting it,
to expose themselves to the vengeance of the Parliament,
when it should be assembled. These reasons obliged him
to take this step entirely of himself; and he only decla∣red
his resolution in council. It is remarkable, that,
tho' the King had made profession never to embrace any
measure without advice of his council, he had often
broke that resolution, and had been necessitated in affairs
of the greatest consequence, to controul their opinion.
Many of them in disgust threw up about this time; par∣ticularly
lord Russel, the most popular man in the na∣tion,
as well from the mildness and integrity of his man∣ners,
as from his zealous attachment to the religion and
liberties of his country. Tho' carried into some ex∣tremes,
his intentions were ever esteemed upright; and be∣ing
heir to the most opulent fortune in the kingdom, as
<PB N="121" REF="155"/>
as void of ambition, men believed, that nothing but
the last necessity would ever engage him to embrace any
desperate measures. Shaftesbury, who was, in most par∣ticulars,
of an opposite character, was removed by the
King from the office of president of the council; and
the earl of Radnor, a man who possessed whimsical ta∣lents
and splenetic virtues, was substituted in his place.</P>
<P>IT was the favour and countenance of the Parliament,
which had chiefly encouraged the rumour of plots; but
the nation had got so much into that vein of credulity,
and every necessitous villain was so much incited by the
success of Oates and Bedloe, that even during the pro∣rogation
the people were not allowed to remain in tran∣quillity.
There was one Dangerfield, a fellow who had
been burned in the hand for crimes, transported, whip∣ped,
pilloried four times, fined for cheats, outlawed for
felony, convicted of coining, and exposed to all the pub∣lic
infamy, which the laws could inflict on the basest and
most shameful enormities. The credulity of the peo∣ple,
and the humour of the times, enabled even this
man to become a person of consequence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meal-tub plot.</NOTE> He was the
author of a new incident, called the <HI>Meal-tub plot,</HI> from
the place where some papers, regarding it, were found.
The bottom of this affair it is difficult, and not very ma∣terial,
to discover. It only appears, that Dangerfield,
under pretence of betraying the conspiracies of the Pres∣byterians,
had been countenanced by some Catholics of
condition, and had even been admitted to the Duke's
presence and the King's. And that under pretence of
revealing new popish plots, he had obtained access to
Shaftesbury and some of the popular leaders. Which
side he intended to cheat, is uncertain; or whether he
did not rather mean to cheat both: But he soon found,
that the belief of the nation was much more open to a
popish than a presbyterian plot; and he resolved to strike
in with the prevailing humour. Tho' no weight could
<PB N="122" REF="156"/>
be laid on his testimony, great clamour was raised; as
if the Court, by way of retaliation, had intended to load
the Presbyterians with the guilt of a false conspiracy.
It must be confessed, that the present period, by the
prevalence and suspicion of such mean and ignoble arts
on all sides, throws a great stain on the British annals.</P>
<P>ONE of the most innocent artifices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of No∣vember.</NOTE> practised by party∣men
at this time, was the additional ceremony, pomp,
and expence, with which a pope-burning was celebrated
in London: This spectacle served to entertain, and
amuse, and enflame the populace. The duke of Mon∣mouth
likewise came over without leave, and made a
triumphant procession thro' many parts of the kingdom,
extremely caressed and admired by the people. All these
arts seemed requisite to support the general prejudices,
during the long interval of Parliament. Great endea∣vours
were also used to obtain the King's consent for
the meeting of that assembly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1680.</NOTE> Seventeen peers presented
a petition to that purpose. Many of the corporations
imitated this example. Notwithstanding several marks
of displeasure, and even a menacing proclamation from
the King, petitions came from all parts, earnestly insisting
on a session of Parliament. The danger of popery, the terrors
of the plot, were never forgot in any of these addresses.</P>
<P>TUMULTUOUS petitioning was one of the chief arti∣fices,
by which the malecontents in the last reign had
attacked the Crown: And tho' the manner of subscri∣bing
and delivering petitions was now somewhat li∣mited
by act of Parliament, the thing itself still remain∣ed;
and was an admirable expedient for infesting the
Court, for spreading discontent, and for uniting the
nation in any popular clamour. As the King found no
law, by which he could punish those importunate, and,
as he esteemed them, undutiful sollicitations, he was
obliged to encounter them by popular applications of a
contrary tendency. Wherever the church and court
<PB N="123" REF="157"/>
party prevailed, addresses were framed, containing ex∣pressions
of the highest regard to his Majesty, the most
entire acquiescence in his wisdom, the most dutiful sub∣mission
to his prerogative, and the deepest <HI>abhorrence</HI> of
those, who endeavoured to encroach on it, by prescri∣bing
to him any time for assembling the Parliament.
Thus the nation came to be distinguished into <HI>Petitioners</HI>
and <HI>Abhorrers.</HI> Factions indeed were at this time ex∣tremely
animated against each other. The very names,
by which each party denominated its antagonist, dis∣cover
the virulence and rancour, which prevailed. For
besides Petitioner and Abhorrer, appellations which were
soon forgot, this year is remarkable for being the epoch
of the well-known epithets of WHIG and TORY,
by which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whig and Tory.</NOTE> and sometimes without any very material dif∣ference,
this island has so been so long divided. The
court party reproached their antagonists with their af∣finity
to the fanatical conventiclers in Scotland, who
were known by the name of Whigs: The country party
found a resemblance between the courtiers and the po∣pish
banditti in Ireland, to whom the appellation of
Tory was affixed. And after this manner, these foolish
terms of reproach came into public and general use;
and even at present seem not nearer their end than when
they were first invented.</P>
<P>THE King used every art to encourage his partizans,
and to reconcile the people to his government. He per∣severed
in the great zeal which he affected against popery.
He even allowed several priests to be put to death, for
no other crime but their having received orders in the
Romish church. It is singular, that one of them, called
Evans, was playing at tennis, when the warrant for his
immediate execution was notified to him: He swore,
that he would play out his set first. Charles, with
the same view of acquiring popularity, formed
an alliance with Spain, and also offered an alliance
<PB N="124" REF="158"/>
to Holland: But the Dutch, terrified with the great
power of France, and seeing little ressource in a coun∣try
so distracted as England, declined acceptance. He
had sent for the Duke from Scotland, but desired him
to return, when the time of ssembling the Parliament
began to approach.</P>
<P>IT was of great consequence to the popular party,
while the meeting of the Parliament depended on the
King's will, to keep the law, whose operations are per∣petual,
entirely on their side. The sheriffs of London
by their office return the juries: It had been usual for
the mayor to nominate one sheriff by drinking to him;
and the common hall had ever without dispute confirmed
the mayor's choice. Sir Robert Clayton, the mayor, na∣med
one who was not acceptable to the popular party:
The common-hall rejected him; and Bethel and Cornish,
two independants, and republicans, and of consequence
deeply engaged with the malecontents, were chosen by
a majority of voices. In spite of all remonstrances and
opposition, the citizens persisted in their choice; and the
court party were obliged for the present to acquiesce.</P>
<P>JURIES however were not so partial in the city; but
that reason and justice, even when the popish plot was
in question, could sometimes prevail. The earl of Castle∣maine,
husband to the famous dutchess of Cleveland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of June.</NOTE>
was acquitted about this time; tho' accused by Oates
and Dangerfield of an intention to assassinate the King.
Sir Thomas Gascoigne, a very aged gentleman in the
north, being accused by two servants, whom he had
dismissed for dishonesty, received a like verdict. These
trials were great blows to the plot, which now began to stagger in the judgment of most men, except those
who were devoted to the country party. But in order
still to preserve alive the zeal against popery, the earl of
Shaftesbury appeared in Westminster hall, attended by
the earl of Huntington, the lords Russel, Cavendish,
<PB N="125" REF="159"/>
Gray, Brandon, Sir Henry Caverly, Sir Gilbert Ger∣rard,
Sir William Cooper, and other persons of distinc∣tion,
and presented to the grand jury of Middlesex rea∣sons
for indicting the Duke of York as a popish recusant.
While the jury were deliberating on this extraordinary
presentment, the chief justice sent for them up, and sud∣denly,
even somewhat irregularly, dismisled them.
Shaftesbury however obtained the end, for which he had
undertaken this bold measure: He showed to all his
followers the desperate resolution, which he had em∣braced,
never to admit of any accommodation or com∣position
with the Duke. By such daring conduct he as∣sured
them, that he was fully determined not to desert
their cause, and he engaged them to a like devoted per∣severance
in all the measures, which he should suggest
to them.</P>
<P>As the kingdom was regularly and openly divided
into two zealous parties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st of Oc∣tober.</NOTE> it was not difficult for the King
to know,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Par∣liament.</NOTE> that the majority of the new House of Com∣mons
was engaged in interests opposite to the Court:
But that he might leave no expedient untried, which
could compose the unhappy differences among his sub∣jects,
he resolved, at last, after a very long interval, to
assemble the Parliament. In his speech, he told them,
that the several prorogations, which he had made, had been
very advantageous to his neighbours, and very useful to
himself: That he had employed that time in perfecting
with the Crown of Spain an alliance, which had been
often desired by former Parliaments, and which, he
doubted not, would be extremely agreeable to them:
That, in order to give weight to this measure, and render
it beneficial to Christendom, it was necessary to avoid
all domestic dissensions, and to unite themselves firmly
in the same views and purposes: That he was determin∣ed,
that nothing on his part should be wanting to such
a salutary end; and provided the succession be preserved
<PB N="126" REF="160"/>
in its due and legal course, he would concur in any
new expedients for the security of the protestant religion:
That the farther examination of the popish plot and the
punishment of the criminals, were requisite for the safety
both of King and kingdom: And after recommending to
them the necessity of providing, by some supplies, for
the safety of Tangiers, he proceeded in these words:
“But that which I value above all the treasure in the
world, and which I am sure will give us greater
strength and reputation both at home and abroad than
any treasure can do, is a perfect union among our∣selves.
Nothing but this can restore the kingdom to
that strength and vigour which it seems to have lost,
and raise us again to that consideration, which Eng∣land
hath usually possessed. All Europe have their
eyes upon this assembly, and think their own happi∣ness
and misery, as well as ours, will depend upon
it. If we should be so unhappy as to fall into mis∣understandings among ourselves to that degree as
would render our friendship unsafe to trust to, it will
not be wondered at, if our neighbours should begin to
take new resolutions, and perhaps such as may be fa∣tal
to us. Let us therefore take care, that we do not
gratify our enemies, and discourage our friends, by any
unseasonable disputes. If any such do happen, the
world will see, that it was no fault of mine: For I
have done all that it was possible for me to do, to keep
you in peace, while I live, and to leave you so, when
I die. But from so great prudence and so good affec∣tion
as yours, I can fear nothing of this kind; but
do rely upon you all, that you will do your best en∣deavours
to bring this Parliament to a good and happy
conclusion.”</P>
<P>ALL these mollifying expressions had no influence with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violence of the Com∣mons.</NOTE>
the Commons. Every step, which they took, betrayed
that zeal, with which they were animated. They voted,
<PB N="127" REF="161"/>
that it was the undoubted right of the subject to petition
the King for the calling and fitting of Parliament. Not
contented with this decision, which seems very justifiable
in a mixt Monarchy, they fell with the utmost violence
on all those <HI>abhorrers,</HI> who in their addresses to the Crown,
had expressed their disapprobation of those petitions.
They did not reflect that it was as lawful for one party
of men, as for another, to express their sentiments of
public affairs; and that the best established right, in par∣ticular
circumstances, may be abused, and even the ex∣ercise
of it become an object of abhorrence. For this
offence, they expelled Sir Thomas Withens. They ap∣pointed
a committee for farther enquiry into such mem∣bers
as had been guilty of a like crime; and complaints
were lodged against Lord Paston, Sir Robert Malverer,
Sir Bryan Stapelton, Taylor and Turner. They ad∣dressed
the King against Sir George Jefferies, recorder
of London, for his activity in the same cause; and they
frightened him into a resignation of his office, in which
he was succeeded by Sir George Treby, a great leader
of the popular party. They voted an impeachment
against North, chief justice of the common pleas, for
drawing the proclamation against tumultuous petitions:
But upon examination found the proclamation so cauti∣ously
worded, that it afforded them no handle against
him. A petition had been presented to the King from
Taunton. “How dare you deliver me such a paper?”
said the King to the person who presented it. “Sir,”
replied he, “my name is DARE.” For this saucy reply,
but under other pretences, he had been tried, fined, and
committed to prison. The Commons now addressed the
King for his liberty and for the remittance of his fine.
Some printers also and authors of seditious libels, they
took under their protection.</P>
<P>GREAT numbers of the Abhorrers, from all parts of
England, were seized by order of the Commons, and
<PB N="126" REF="162"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="127" REF="163"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="128" REF="164"/>
committed to custody. The liberty of the subject,
which had been so carefully guarded by the great char∣ter,
and by the late law of Habeas Corpus, was every
day violated by their arbitrary and capricious commit∣ments.
The chief jealousy, 'tis true, of the English con∣stitution
is naturally and justly directed against the
Crown; nor indeed have the Commons any other way
of securing their privileges but by commitments, which,
as they cannot beforehand be exactly determined by law,
must always appear in some degree arbitrary. Sensible of
these reasons, the people had hitherto, without mur∣muring,
seen this discretionary power exercised by the
House: But as it was now carried to extremes, and was
abused to serve the purposes of a faction, great com∣plaints
against it were heard from all quarters. At last,
the vigour and courage of one Stowel of Exeter, an
Abhorrer, put an end to the practice. He refused to
obey the serjeant at arms, stood upon his defence, and
said that he knew of no law, by which they pretended
to commit him. The house, finding it equally dange∣rous
to proceed or to recede, got off by an evasion:
They inserted in their votes, that Stowel was indispo∣sed,
and that a month's time was allowed him for his
recovery.</P>
<P>BUT the chief violence of the House of Commons
appeared in all their transactions with regard to the plot,
which they prosecuted with the same zeal and the same
credulity as their predecessors. They renewed the for∣mer
vote, which affirmed the reality of the horrid po∣pish
plot; and, in order to the more to terrify the peo∣ple,
they even asserted, that, notwithstanding the disco∣very,
the plot still subsisted. They expelled Sir Robert
Can and Sir Robert Yeomans, who had been complain∣ed
of, for saying, that there was no popish, but there
was a presbyterian plot. And they greatly lamented
the death of Bedloe, whom they called a material wit∣ness,
<PB N="129" REF="165"/>
and on whose testimony they much depended.
He had been seized with a fever at Bristol, had sent
for chief justice North, confirmed all his former evidence,
except that with regard to the Duke and the Queen,
and desired North to apply to the King for some money
to relieve him in his necessities. A few days after he
died; and the whole party triumphed extremely in
this incident: As if such a testimony could be esteemed
the affirmation of a dying man, as if his confession of
perjury in some instances could assure his veracity in the
rest, and as if the perseverance of one profligate could
outweigh the last words of so many men, guilty of no
other crime but that of popery.</P>
<P>THE Commons even endeavoured, by their counte∣nance
and protection, to purge off the extreme infamy,
with which Dangerfield was loaded, and to restore him
to a capacity of being a witness. The whole tribe of
informers, they applauded and rewarded: Jennison, Tur∣berville,
Dugdale, Smith, la Faria, appeared before
them; and their testimony, however frivolous or absurd,
met with a favourable reception: The King was applied
to in their behalf for pensions and pardons: Their nar∣ratives
were printed with that sanction, which arose
from the approbation of the House. Dr. Tongue was
recommended for the first considerable church prefer∣ment,
which should become vacant. Considering men's
determined resolution to believe, instead of admiring that
a palpable falshood should be maintained by witnesses,
it may justly appear wonderful, that no better evidence
was ever produced against the Catholics.</P>
<P>THE principal reasons, which still supported the cla∣mour
of the popish plot, were the apprehensions, so justly
entertained by the people, of the Duke of York, and
the resolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exclusion▪ bill.</NOTE> embraced by their leaders, of excluding
him from the throne. Shaftesbury and many considera∣ble
men of the party, had rendered themselves totally ir∣reconcileable
with him, and could find their safety no
<PB N="130" REF="166"/>
way but in his ruin. Monmouth's friends hoped, that
the exclusion of that Prince would make way for their
patron. The resentment against the Duke's apostacy,
the love of liberty, the zeal for religion, the attach∣ment
to faction; all these motives incited the country
party. And above all, what supported the resolution
of adhering to the exclusion, and rejecting all expedients
offered, was the hope artificially encouraged, that the
King would at last be obliged to yield to their demand.
His revenues were extremely burdened; and even if free,
could scarce suffice for the necessary charges of govern∣ment,
much less for that pleasure and expence, to which
he was strongly inclined. Tho' he had withdrawn his
countenance from Monmouth, he was known secretly
to retain a great affection for him. On no occasion
had he ever been found to persist obstinately against dif∣ficulties
and importunity. And as his beloved mlstress,
the dutchess of Portsmouth, had been engaged, either
from lucrative views, or the hopes of making the
succession fall on her own children, to unite herself
with the popular party; this incident was regarded
as a favourable prognostic of their success. Sun∣derland,
secretary of state, who had linked his inte∣rest
with that of the dutchess, had concurred in the
same measure.</P>
<P>BUT besides friendship to his brother and a regard to
the right of succession, there were many strong reasons
which had determined Charles to persevere in opposing
the exclusion. All the royalists and the devotees to the
church; that party by which alone Monarchy was sup∣ported;
regarded the right of succession as inviolable;
and if abandoned by the King in so capital an article, it
was to be feared, that they would, in their turn, de∣sert
his cause, and deliver him over to the pretensions
and usurpations of the country party. The country party,
or the Whigs, as they were called, if they did not still
retain some propensity towards a republic, were at least
<PB N="131" REF="167"/>
affected with a violent jealousy of regal power; and it was
equally to be dreaded, that being enraged with opposition,
and animated with success, they would, if they pre∣vailed
in this pretension, be willing as well as able, to
reduce the prerogative within very narrow limits. All
menaces therefore, all promises were in vain employed
against the King's resolution: He never would be pre∣vailed
with to desert his friends, and put himself into
the hands of his enemies. And having voluntarily made
such important concessions, and offered, over and over
again, such strong limitations, he was well pleased to
find them rejected by the obstinacy of the Commons;
and hoped, that, after the spirit of opposition had spent
itself in fruitless violence, the time would come, when
he might safely appeal against his Parliament to his people.</P>
<P>SO much were the popular leaders determined to carry
matters to extremity, that in less than a week after the
commencement of the session, a motion was made for
bringing in an exclusion-bill, and a committee was ap∣pointed
for that purpose. This bill differed in nothing
from the former, but in two articles, which showed still
an increase of zeal in the Commons: The bill was to
be read to the people twice a year in all the churches of
the kingdom, and every one, who should support the
Duke's title, was rendered incapable of pardon but by
act of Parliament.</P>
<P>THE debates were carried on with great violence on
both sides. The bill was defended by Sir William Jones,
who had now resigned his office of attorney-general, by
lord Russel, by Sir Francis Winnington, Sir Harry Capel,
Sir William Pulteney, by colonel Titus, Treby, Hamb∣den,
Montague.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of No∣vember.</NOTE> It was opposed by Sir Leoline Jen∣kins,
secretary of state, Sir John Ernley, chancellor of
the exchequer, by Hyde, Seymour, Temple. The ar∣guments,
transmitted to us, may be reduced to the fol∣lowing
topics.</P>

IN every government, said the exclusionists, there is
somewhere an authority absolute and supreme; nor can
any determination, however unusual, which receives
the sanction of the legislature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments for and against the exclusion.</NOTE> ever▪ afterwards admit of
dispute or controul▪ The liberty of any constitution,
so far from diminishing this absolute power, seems rather
to add force to it, and to give it greater influence over
the people. The more parts of the state concur in any
legislative decision, and the more free their voice; the
less likelihood is there that any opposition will be made
to those measures, which receive the final sanction of
their authority. In England, the legislative power is
lodged in King, Lords, and Commons, which com∣prehend
every order of the community: And there is no
pretext for exempting any circumstance of government,
not even the succession of the Crown, from so full and
decisive a jurisdiction. Even express declarations have,
in this particular, been made of parliamentary authority:
Instances have occurred, where it has been exerted:
And tho' prudential reasons may justly be alleged, why
such innovations should never be attempted but on ex∣traordinary
occasions, the power and right are for ever
vested in the community. But if any occasion can be
deemed extraordinary, if any emergence can require un∣usual
expedients, it is the present; when the heir to the
Crown has renounced the religion of the state, and has
zealously embraced a faith, totally hostile and incompa∣tible.
A prince of that communion can never put trust
in a people, so prejudiced against him: The people must
be equally diffident of such a prince. Foreign and de∣structive alliances will seem to the one the only protec∣tion
of his throne: Perpetual jealousy, opposition, saction,
even insurrections will be employed by the other as
the sole securities for their liberty and religion. Tho'
theological principles, when set in opposition to passions,
have often small influence on mankind in general, still
<PB N="133" REF="171"/>
less on princes; yet when they become symbols of fac∣tion,
and marks of party distinctions, they concur with
one of the strongest passions in the human frame, and
are then capable of carrying men to the greatest extre∣mities.
Notwithstanding the better judgment and mil∣der
disposition of the King; how much has the influ∣ence
of the Duke already disturbed the tenor of govern∣ment?
How often engaged the nation into measures to∣tally
destructive of their foreign interests and honour, of
their domestic repose and tranquillity? The more the
absurdity and incredibility of the popish plot are insisted
on, the stronger reason it affords for the exclusion of the
Duke; since the universal belief of it discovers the ex∣treme
antipathy of the nation to his religion, and the ut∣ter
impossibility of ever bringing them to acquiesce peace∣ably
under the dominion of such a Sovereign. The
prince, finding himself in so perilous a situation, must
seek for security by desperate remedies, and by totally
subduing the privileges of a nation, who had betrayed
such hostile dispositions towards himself, and towards
every thing which he deems the most sacred. It is in
vain to propose limitations and expedients. Whatever
share of authority is left in the Duke's hands, will be
employed to the destruction of the nation; and even the
additional restraints, by discovering the public diffidence
and aversion, will serve him as incitements to put him∣self
in a condition entirely absolute and independant.
And as the laws of England still make resistance treason,
and neither do nor can admit of any positive exceptions;
what folly to leave the kingdom in so perilous and
absurd a situation; where the greatest virtue will be ex∣posed
to the most severe proscription, and where the
laws can only be saved by expedients, which these
same laws have declared the highest crime and enormity?</P>
<P>THE court party reasoned in an opposite manner. An
authority, they thought, entirely absolute and uncon∣troulable
<PB N="134" REF="172"/>
is a mere chimera, and is no where to be found
in any human institutions. All government is founded
on opinion and a sense of duty; and wherever the su∣preme
magistrate, by any law or positive prescription,
shocks an opinion regarded as fundamental, and esta∣blished
with equal firmness as his own authority, he
subverts the principle, by which he himself is established,
and can no longer hope for obedience. In European
monarchies, the right of succession is justly esteemed a
fundamental; and even tho' the whole legislature be
vested in a single person, it would never be permitted
him, by an edict, to disinherit his lawful heir, and call
a stranger or more distant relation to the Throne. Abuses
an other parts of government are capable of redress,
from more dispassionate enquiry or better information of
the Sovereign, and till then ought patiently to be en∣dured:
But violations of the right of succession draw
such terrible consequences after them as are not to be
paralleled by any other grievance or inconvenience.
Vainly is it pleaded, that England is a mixt Monar∣chy;
and that a law, framed by King, Lords, and
Commons, is enacted by the concurrence of every part
of the state: It is plain, that there remains a very pow∣erful
party, who may indeed be out-voted, but who
never will deem a law, subversive of hereditary right,
to be any wise valid or obligatory. Limitations, such
as are proposed by the King, give no shock to the con∣stitution,
which, in many particulars, is already li∣mited;
and they may be so calculated as to serve every
purpose, which is sought for by an exclusion. If the
antient barriers against regal authority have been able,
during so many ages, to remain impregnable; how much
more, those additional ones, which, by depriving the
Monarch of power, tend so far to their own security?
The very same jealousy too of religion, which has en∣gaged
the people to lay these restraints upon the suc∣cessor,
<PB N="135" REF="173"/>
will lessen extremely the number of his partizans,
and make it utterly impracticable for him, either by force
or artifice, to break the fetters, imposed upon him.
The King's age and vigorous state of health promise him
a long life: And can it be prudent to tear the whole
state in pieces, in order to provide against a contingency,
which, it is very likely, may never happen? No hu∣man
schemes can secure the public in all possible events;
and the bill of exclusion itself, however accurately
framed, leaves room for very obvious and very natural
suppositions, to which it pretends not to provide any re∣medy.
Should the Duke have a son, after the King's
death; must that son, without any default of his own,
forfeit his title? Or must the princess of Orange descend
from the Throne, in order to give place to the lawful
successor? But were all these reasonings false, it still re∣mains
to be considered, that in public deliberations we
seek not the expedient, which is best in itself, but the
best of such as are practicable. The King willingly con∣sents
to limitations, and has already offered some which
are of the utmost importance: But he is determined to en∣dure
any extremity rather than allow the right of succession
to be invaded. Let us beware of that factious violence,
which leads us to demand more than will be granted;
lest we lose the advantage of those beneficial concessions,
and leave the nation, on the King's decease, at the mercy
of a zealous prince, irritated with the ill usage, which,
he imagines, he has already met with.</P>
<P>IN the House of Commons, the reasoning of the ex∣clusionists
appeared the most convincing; and the bill
passed by a great majority. It was in the House of Peers
that the King expected to oppose it with success. The
court party was there so prevalent, that it was carried
only by a majority of two to pay so much respect to the
bill as even to commit it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of No∣vember.</NOTE> When it came to be de∣bated,
the contest was very violent. Shaftesbury, Sun∣derland,
<PB N="136" REF="174"/>
and Essex argued for it: Halifax chiefly con∣ducted
the debate against it, and displayed an extent of
capacity and a force of eloquence, which had never been
surpassed in that assembly. He was animated, as well by
the greatness of the occasion, as by a rivalship to his un∣cle
Shaftesbury; whom, during that day's debate, he
seemed, in the judgement of all, to have totally eclipsed.
The King was present during the whole debate, which
was prolonged till eleven at night.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exclusion-bill riejected.</NOTE> The bill was thrown
out by a considerable majority. All the bishops, except
three, voted against it. Besides the influence of the
Court over them; the church of England, they ima∣gined
or pretended, was in much greater danger from
the prevalence of Presbyterianism than of Popery, which,
tho' favoured by the Duke, and even by the King, was
extremely repugnant to the genuis of the nation.</P>
<P>THE Commons discovered much ill humour upon this
disappointment. They immediately voted an address for
the removal of Halifax from the King's councils and pre∣sence
for ever. Tho' the pretended cause was his ad∣vising
the late frequent prorogations of Parliament, the
real reason was apparently his vigorous opposition to the
exclusion-bill. When the King applied for money to
enable him to defend Tangiers, which he declared his
present revenues totally unable to support; instead
of complying, they voted such an address as was in reality
a remonstrance, and one little less than violent that famous
remonstrance, which ushered in the civil wars. All
the abuses of government, from the beginning almost of the
reign, are there insisted on; the Dutch war, the alliance
with France, the prorogations and dissolutions of Par∣liament;
and as all these measures, as well as the <HI>damna∣ble</HI>
and <HI>hellish</HI> plot, are ascribed to the machinations of
the Papists, it was plainly insinuated, that the King had,
all along, lain under the influence of that party, and was
in reality the chief conspirator against the religion and
liberties of his people.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="175"/>
THE commons, tho' they conducted the great business
of the exclusion with extreme violence and even impru∣dence,
had yet much reason for that jealousy, which
gave rise to it: But their vehement prosecution of the
popish plot, even after so long an interval, discovers
such a spirit, either of credulity or injustice, as admits
of no apology. The impeachment of the Catholic lords
in the Tower was revived; and as the viscount Stafford,
from his age, infirmities, and narrow capacity, was
esteemed the least capable of defending himself, it was
determined to make him the first victim, that his con∣demnation
might pave the way for a sentence against the
rest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of No∣vember.</NOTE> The chancellor, now created earl of Nottingham,
was appointed lord high steward for conducting this trial.</P>
<P>THERE were three witnesses produced against the pri∣soner;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Stafford.</NOTE>
Oates, Dugdale, and Turberville. Oates swore,
that he saw Fenwic, the jesuit, deliver to Stafford a
commission signed by de Oliva, general of the jesuits,
constituting him paymaster to the papal army, which
was to be levied for the subduing of England: For this
ridiculous imposture still maintened its credit with the
Commons. Dugdale gave testimony, that the prisoner,
at Tixal, a seat of lord Aston's, had endeavoured to en∣gage
him in the design of murdering the King; and had
promised him, besides the honour of being sainted by the
church, a reward of 500 pounds for that service. Tur∣berville
affirmed, that the prisoner, in his own house at
Paris, had made him alike proposal. To offer money for
murdering a King, without laying down any scheme, by
which the assassin may ensure some probability or possibility
of escape, is so incredible in itself, and may so easily be
maintained by any prostitute evidence, that an accusation
of that nature, not accompanied with circumstances,
ought very little to be attended to by any court of judi∣cature.
But notwithstanding the small hold, which the
witnesses afforded, the prisoner was able, in many very
<PB N="138" REF="176"/>
material particulars, to discredit their testimony. It
was sworn by Dugdale, that Stafford had assisted in a
great consult of the Catholics held at Tixal; but Staf∣ford
proved by undoubted testimony, that at the time as∣signed
he was in Bath, and in that neighbourhood,
Turberville had served a noviciate among the Domini∣cans;
but having deserted the convent, he had inlisted
as a trooper in the French army; and being dismissed
that service, he now lived in London, abandoned by all
his relations, and exposed to great poverty. Stafford
proved, by the evidence of his gentleman and his page,
that Turberville had never, either at Paris or at London,
been seen in his company; and it might justly appear
strange, that a person, who had so important a secret in
his keeping, was so long entirely neglected by him.</P>
<P>THE clamour and outrage of the populace, during the
trial, were extreme: Great ability and eloquence were
displayed by the managers, Sir William Jones, Sir Fran∣cis
Winnington, serjeant Maynard: Yet did the priso∣ner,
under all these disadvantageous circumstances, make
a better defence than was expected, either by his friends
or his enemies: The unequal contest, in which he was
engaged, was a plentiful source of compassion to every
mind, seasoned with humanity. He represented, that,
during a course of forty years, from the very commence∣ment
of the civil wars, he had, through many dangers,
difficulties, and losses, still maintained his loyalty: And
was it credible, that now in his old age, easy in his cir∣cumstances,
but dispirited by infirmities, he would be∣lye
the whole course of his life, and engage, against his
royal master, from whom he had ever received kind treat∣ment,
in the most desperate and most bloody of all con∣spiracies?
He remarked the infamy of the witnesses; the
contradictions and absurdities of their testimony; the ex∣treme
indigence in which they had lived, tho' engaged,
as they pretended, in a conspiracy with Kings, Princes,
<PB N="139" REF="177"/>
and nobles; the credit and opulence to which they were
at present raised. With a simplicity and tenderness more
persuasive than the greatest oratory, he still made protes∣tations
of his innocence, and could not forbear, every
moment, expressing the most lively surprize and indig∣nation
at the audacious impudence of the witnesses.</P>
<P>IT will justly appear astonishing to us, as it did to Staf∣ford
himself, that the Peers, after a solemn trial of six
days, should, by a majority of twenty-four voices, pro∣nounce
sentence against him. He received however with
resignation the fatal verdict. <HI>God's holy name be praised,</HI>
was the only exclamation which he uttered. When the
high-steward told him, that the Peers would intercede
with the King for remitting the more cruel and ignomi∣nious
parts of the sentence, hanging and quartering; he
burst into tears: But he told the Lords, that he was
moved to this weakness, by his sense of their goodness,
not by any terror of that fate, which he was doomed to
suffer.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that after Charles, as is usual in
such cases, had remitted to Stafford the hanging and quar∣tering,
the two sheriffs, Bethel and Cornish, indulging
their own republican humour, and complying with the
prevalent spirit of their party, ever jealous of Monarchy,
started a doubt with regard to the King's power of exer∣cising
even this small degree of lenity. “Since he cannot
pardon the whole,” said they, “how can he have
power to remit part of the sentence?” They proposed
the doubt to both houses: The peers pronounced it su∣perfluous;
and even the Commons, apprehensive lest a
question of this nature might make way for Stafford's es∣cape,
gave this singular answer. “This House is <HI>content,</HI>
that the sheriffs do execute William late viscount Staf∣ford
by severing his head from his body <HI>only.</HI>” No∣thing
can be a stronger proof of the fury of the times,
than that lord Russel, notwithstanding the virtue and hu∣manity
<PB N="140" REF="178"/>
of his character, seconded in the House this bar∣barous
scruple of the sheriffs.</P>
<P>IN the interval between the sentence and execution,
many efforts were made to shake the resolution of the in∣firm
and aged prisoner, and to bring him to some con∣fession
of that treason for which he was now condemned.
It was even rumoured, that he had confessed; and the
zealous partymen, who, no doubt, had secretly, not∣withstanding
their credulity, entertained some scruple
with regard to the popish conspiracy, expressed great
triumph on this occasion. But Stafford, when again
called before the House of Peers, discovered many
schemes, which had been laid by himself and others for
procuring a toleration to the Catholics, at least a miti∣gation
of the penal laws, enacted against them: And he
protested, that this was the sole treason of which he had
ever been guilty.</P>
<P>STAFFORD now prepared himself for death with that
intrepidity which became his birth and station, and which
was the natural result of the innocence and integrity,
which, during the course of a long life, he had ever
maintained: His mind seemed even to collect new force
from the violence and oppression, under which he labour∣ed.
When going to execution, he called for a cloak to
defend him against the rigour of the season.<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th of De∣cember.</NOTE> “Perhaps,
said he, I may shake with cold; but, I trust in God,
not for fear.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">and execu∣tion.</NOTE> On the scaffold, he continued, with
reiterated and earnest asseverations, to make protestions
of his innocence: All his fervour was exercised on that
point: When he mentioned the witnesses, whose per∣juries
had bereaved him of life, his expressions were full
of mildness and of charity. He solemnly disavowed all
those immoral principles, which over-zealous Protes∣tants
had ascribed without distinction to the church of
Rome: And he hoped, he said, that the time was now
approaching, when the present delusion would be dis∣sipated;
<PB N="141" REF="179"/>
and when the force of truth, tho' late, would
engage the whole world to make reparation to his in∣jured
honour.</P>
<P>THE populace, who had exulted at Stafford's trial and
condemnation, were now melted into tears, at the sight
of that tender fortitude, which shone forth in each fea∣ture,
and motion, and accent of this aged noble. Their
profound silence was only interrupted by sighs and groans:
With difficulty they found speech to assent to those pro∣testations
of innocence, which he frequently repeated:
“We believe you, my lord! God bless you, my lord!”
These expressions with a faultering accent flowed from
them. The executioner himself was touched with sym∣pathy.
Twice he lifted up the ax, with an intent to
strike the fatal blow; and as often felt his resolution to
fail him. A deep sigh was heard to accompany his last
effort, which laid Stafford for ever at rest. All the spec∣tators
seemed to feel the blow. And when the head was
held up to them with the usual cry, <HI>This is the head of a
traitor,</HI> no clamour of assent was uttered. Pity, remorse,
and astonishment had taken possession of every heart, and
displayed itself in every countenance.</P>
<P>THIS is the last blood which was shed on account of
the popish plot: An incident, which, for the credit of
the nation, it were better to bury in eternal oblivion;
but which it is necessary to perpetuate, as well to main∣tain
the truth of history, as to warn, if possible, their
posterity and all mankind never again to fall into so
shameful and so barbarous a delusion.</P>
<P>THE execution of Stafford gratified the prejudices of
the country party; but it contributed nothing to their
power and security: On the contrary, by exciting com∣miseration,
it tended still farther to encrease that disbelief
of the whole plot, which began now to prevail. The
Commons, therefore, not to lose the present occasion,
resolved to make both friends and enemies sensible of
<PB N="142" REF="180"/>
their authority. They passed a bill for easing the Pro∣testant
Dissenters, and for repealing the persecuting sta∣tute
of the thirty-fifth of Elizabeth: This laudable bill
was likewise carried thro' the House of Peers. The
chief justice was very obnoxious for dismissing the grand
jury in an irregular manner, and thereby preventing that
bold measure of Shaftesbury and his friends, who had
presented the Duke as a Recusant. For this crime the
Commons sent up an impeachment against him; as also
against Jones and Weston, two of the judges, who, in
some speeches from the bench, had gone so far as to give
to many of the first Reformers the denomination of Fa∣natics.</P>
<P>THE King, in rejecting the exclusion bill, had shel∣tered
himself securely behind the authority of the House
of Peers; and the Commons had been deprived of the
usual pretence to attack the Sovereign himself, under co∣lour
of attacking his ministers and counsellors. In pro∣secution
however of the scheme, which he had formed,
of throwing the blame on the Commons in case of any
rupture, he made them a new speech. After warning
them, that a neglect of this opportunity would never be
retrieved, he added these words: “I did promise you the
fullest satisfaction, which your hearts could wish, for
the security of the protestant religion, and to concur with
you in any remedies, which might consist with preserv∣ing
the succession of the Crown in its due and legal
course of descent. I do again, with the same reser∣vations,
renew the same promises to you: And being
thus ready on my part to do all that can reasonably be
expected from me, I should be glad to know from you,
as soon as may be, how far I shall be assisted by you
and what it is you desire from me.”</P>
<P>THE most reasonable objection against the limitations
proposed by the King, is, that they introduced too con∣siderable an innovation in the government, and almo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣totally
<PB N="143" REF="181"/>
annihilated the power of the Monarch. But con∣sidering
the present disposition of the Commons and their
leaders, we may fairly presume, that this objection would
have small weight with them, and that their disgust against
the Court would rather incline them to diminish than
support regal authority. They still hoped, from the
King's urgent necessities, and his usual facility, that he
would throw himself wholly into their hands; and that
thus, without waiting for the accession of the Duke,
they might immediately render themselves absolute masters
of the government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violence of the Com∣mons.</NOTE> The Commons, therefore, besides
insisting still on the exclusion, proceeded to bring in bills
of a very important, and some of them of a very alarm∣ing
nature: One to renew the triennial act, which had
been so inadvertently repealed in the beginning of the
reign: A second to make the office of judge during good
behaviour: A third to declare the levying of money with∣out
consent of Parliament to be high treason: A fourth
to order an association for the safety of his Majesty's
person, for defence of the protestant religion, for the
preservation of the protestant subjects against all invasions
and opposition whatsoever, and for preventing the Duke
of York or any Papist from succeeding to the Crown.
The memory of the covenant was too recent for men
to overlook the consequences of such an association: And
the King, who was particularly conversant in Davila,
could not fail of recollecting a memorable foreign in∣stance to fortify this domestic experience.</P>
<P>THE Commons also passed many votes, which, tho'
they had not the authority of laws, served however to dis∣cover
the temper and disposition of the House. They
voted, that whoever had advised his Majesty to refuse
the exclusion bill, were promoters of popery and ene∣mies
to the King and kingdom. In another vote, they
named the marquess of Worcester, the earls of Claren∣don,
Feversham, and Halifax, Laurence Hyde, and Ed∣ward
<PB N="144" REF="182"/>
Seymour, as those dangerous enemies, and they
requested his Majesty to remove them from his person
and councils for ever: They voted, that, till the exclu∣sion
bill was passed, they could not, consistent with the
trust reposed in them, grant the King any manner of
supply. And left he should be enabled, by any other ex∣pedient,
to support the government, and preserve him∣self
independant, they passed another vote, in which
they declared, that whoever should hereafter lend, by
way of advance, any money upon those branches of the
King's revenue, arising from customs, excise, or hearth
money, should be judged a hinderer of the sitting of
Parliament, and be responsible for the same in Parliament.</P>
<P>THE King might presume, that the Peers, who had
rejected the exclusion bill, would still continue to de∣fend
the Throne, and that none of the dangerous bills,
introduced into the other House, would ever be present∣ed
for the royal assent and approbation. But as there re∣mained
no hopes of bringing the Commons to any com∣posure,
and as their farther sitting served only to keep
faction alive, and to perpetuate the general ferment of
the nation, he came secretly to a resolution of prorogue∣ing
them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1681.</NOTE> They got intelligence about a quarter of an
hour before the black rod came to their door.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of Ja∣nuary. Dissolution of the Par∣liament.</NOTE> Not to
lose such precious time, they passed in a very tumultuous
manner some very extraordinary resolutions. They voted,
<HI>that</HI> whosoever advised his Majesty to prorogue this Par∣liament
to any other purpose than in order to pass the bill
of exclusion, was a betrayer of the King, of the protes∣tant
religion, and of the kingdom of England; a promot∣er
of the French interest, and a pensioner of France:
<HI>That</HI> thanks be given to the city of London for their ma∣nifest
loyalty, and for their care and vigilance in the pre∣servation
of the King and of the protestant religion: <HI>That</HI>
it is the opinion of this House, that that city was burn∣ed
in the year 1666 by the Papists, designing thereby to
<PB N="145" REF="183"/>
introduce arbitrary power and popery into the king∣dom:
<HI>That</HI> humble application be made to his majesty to
restore the duke of Monmouth to all his offices and com∣mands,
from which, it appears to the House, he had
been removed by the influence of the duke of York.
And <HI>that</HI> it is the opinion of the House, that the prose∣cution
of the Protestant dissenters upon the penal laws
is at this time grievous to the subject, a weakening of
the protestant interest, an encouragement of popery,
and dangerous to the peace of the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE King passed some laws of no great importance:
But the bill for repealing the thirty fifth of Elizabeth,
he privately ordered the clerk of the Crown not to pre∣sent
to him. By this artifice, which was equally diso∣bliging
to the country party as if the bill had been re∣jected,
and at the same time implied some meanness
and timidity in the King, that salutary act was for the
present eluded. The King had often of himself attempt∣ed,
and sometimes by irregular means, to give indul∣gence
to Nonconformists: But besides, that he had usu∣ally
expected to comprehend the Catholics in this liberty,
the present refractory disposition of the Sectaries had much
incensed him against them, and he was still resolved, if
possible, to keep them at mercy.</P>
<P>THE last votes of the Commons seemed to be an
attempt of forming indirectly an association against the
Crown, after they found, that their association bill could
not pass: The dissenting interest, the city, and the duke
of Monmouth, they endeavoured to connect with the coun∣try
party. A civil war indeed never appeared so likely as
at present; and it was high time for the King to dissolve
a Parliament, which seemed to have entertained such
dangerous projects. Soon after, he summoned another.
Tho' he observed, that the country party had established
their interest so strongly in all the electing burroughs,
that he could not hope for any disposition more favou∣rable
<PB N="146" REF="184"/>
in the new Parliament, this expedient was still a
prosecution of his former project, of trying every method,
by which he might form an accommodation with the
Commons: And if all failed, he hoped, that he could
the better justify to his people, at least to his party, a
final breach with them.</P>
<P>IT had always been much regretted by the Royalists
during the civil wars, that the Long Parliament had been
assembled at Westminster, and had thereby received force
and encouragement from the neighbourhood of a potent
and factious city, which had zealously embraced their
party. Tho' the King was now possessed of guards,
which, in some measure overawed the populace, he was
determined still farther to obviate all inconveniences;
and he summoned the new Parliament to meet at Oxford.
The city of London showed how just a judgment he
had formed of their disposition. Besides re-electing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
same members, they voted thanks to them for their for∣mer
behaviour, in endeavouring to discover the depth of
the <HI>horrid</HI> and <HI>hellish</HI> popish plot, and to exclude the
Duke of York, the principal cause of the ruin and mi∣sery,
impending over the nation. Monmouth with fifteen
Peers presented a petition against assembling the Parliament
at Oxford, “where the two Houses,” they said,
“could not be in safety; but would be easily exposed
to the swords of the Papists and their adherents, of
whom too many had crept into his Majesty's guards.”
These insinuations, which struck so evidently at the
King himself, were not calculated to perswade him, but
to inflame the people.</P>
<P>THE Exclusionists might have concluded, both from
the King's dissolution of the last Parliament, and from
his summoning of the present to meet at Oxford, that
he was determined to maintain his declared resolution of
rejecting their favourite bill: But they still flattered them∣selves,
that his urgent necessities would influence his easy
<PB N="147" REF="185"/>
temper, and finally gain them the ascendant. The lea∣ders
came to Parliament, attended not only with their
servants, but with numerous bands of their followers
and partizans. The four city members in particular
were followed by great multitudes, wearing ribbons, in
which were woven these words, <HI>No Popery! No Slavery!</HI>
The King had his guards regularly mustered; His party
likewise endeavoured to make a show of their strength:
And on the whole, the assembly at Oxford bore more
the appearance of a tumultuous Polish diet, than of a
regular English Parliament.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st of March.</NOTE> who had hitherto employed the most gra∣cious
expressions to all his Parliaments, particularly the
two last, thought proper to address himself to the pre∣sent
in a more authoritative manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New parlia∣ment at Ox∣ford.</NOTE> He complained of
the unwarrantable proceedings of the former House of
Commons; and said, that, as he would never use arbi∣trary
government himself, neither would he ever suffer
it in others. By calling however this Parliament so soon,
he had sufficiently shown, that no past irregularities could
inspire him with a prejudice against those assemblies. He
now afforded them, he added, another opportunity of
providing for the public safety; and to all the world had
given one evidence more, that on his part he had not ne∣glected
the duty incumbent on him.</P>
<P>THE Commons were not over-awed with the magi∣sterial
air of the King's speech. They consisted almost
entirely of the same members; they chose the same spea∣ker;
and they instantly fell into the same measures, the
impeachment of Danby, the repeal of the persecuting
statute of Elizabeth, the enquiry into the popish plot,
and the bill of exclusion. So violent were they on this
last article, that no expedient, however plausible, could so
much as be hearkened to. Ernely, one of the King's
ministers, proposed, that the Duke should be banished,
during life, five hundred miles from England, and that
<PB N="146" REF="186"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="147" REF="187"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="148" REF="188"/>
on the King's demise the next heir should be constituted
regent with regal power: Yet even this expedient, which
left the Duke only the bare title of King, could not,
tho' seconded by Sir Thomas Lyttleton and Sir Thomas
Mompession, obtain the attention of the House. The
past disappointments of the country party, and the oppo∣sition
made by the court, had only rendered them more
united, more haughty, and more determined. No
other method but their own, of excluding the Duke,
could give them any satisfaction.</P>
<P>THERE was one Fitz-harris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fitz-harris's case.</NOTE> an Irish Catholic, who
had insinuated himself into the dutchess of Portsmouth's
acquaintance, and had been very busy in conveying to
her intelligence of any libel wrote by the country party, or
of any designs entertained against her or against the court.
For services of this kind, and perhaps too, from a regard
to his father, Sir Edward Fitz-Harris, who had been an
eminent royalist, he had received from the King a pre∣sent
of 250 pounds. This man met with one Everard,
a Scotchman, a spy of the exclusionists, and an infor∣mer
of the popish plot; and he proposed to him to write
a libel against the King, the Duke, and the whole ad∣ministration.
What Fitz-harris's intentions were, can∣not
well be ascertained; it is probable, as he afterwards
asserted, that he meant to carry this libel to his patron,
the dutchess, and to make a merit of the discovery. Eve∣rard,
who suspected some other design, and who was
pleased on his side to have the merit of a discovery with
his patrons, resolved to betray his friend: He posted Sir
William Waller, a noted justice of peace, and two per∣sons
more behind the hangings, and gave them an oppor∣tunity
of seeing and hearing the whole transaction. The
libel, sketched out by Fitz-harris, and executed partly
by him, partly by Everard, was the most furious, indecent,
and outrageous performance imaginable; and such as was
fitter to hurt than serve any party, which should be so
<PB N="149" REF="189"/>
imprudent as to adopt it. Waller carried the intelligence
to the King, and obtained a warrant for committing Fitz∣harris,
who happened, at that very time, to have a copy
of the libel in his pocket. Finding himself now delive∣red
over to the law, he resolved to pay court to the po∣pular
party, who were alone able to protect him, and
by whom he observed almost all trials to be governed
and directed. He said, that he had been employed by
the court to write the libel, in order to throw the odium
of it on the exclusionists: But this account, which was
within the bounds of credibility, he disgraced by circum∣stances,
which are altogether absurd and improbable.
The intention of the ministers, he said, was to send
about copies to all the heads of the country party; and
the moment they received them, they were to be arrested,
and a conspiracy to be imputed to them. That he might
merit favour by still more important intelligence, he com∣menced
a discoverer of the great popish plot; and he fai∣led
not to confirm all the tremendous circumstances, in∣sisted
on by his predecessors. He said, that the second
Dutch war was entered into with a view of extirpating
the protestant religion, both abroad and at home; that
father Parry, a jesuit, on the disappointment by the peace,
told him, that the Catholics resolved to destroy the King,
and had even engaged the Queen in that design; that
the envoy of Modena offered him 10,000 pounds to
kill the King, and upon his refusal the envoy said, that
the dutchess of Mazarine, who was as expert at poison∣ing
as her sister, the countess of Soissons, would, with
a little phial, execute that design; that upon the King's
death the army in Flanders were to come over, and mas∣sacre
the Protestants; that money was raised in Italy for
recruits and supplies, and there should be no more Par∣liaments;
and that the Duke was privy to this whole
plan, and had even entered into the design of Godfrey's
<PB N="150" REF="190"/>
murder, which was afterwards executed in the manner
related by Prance.</P>
<P>THE popular leaders had, all along, been very de∣sirous
of having an accusation against the Duke; and
tho' Oates and Bedloe, in their first intelligence, had
not dared to go so far, both Dugdale and Dangerfield
had afterwards been encouraged to supply so material a
defect, by comprehending him in the conspiracy. The
Commons, therefore, finding that Fitz-harris was also
willing to serve this purpose, were not ashamed to adopt
his evidence, and resolved for that end to save him from
the destruction with which he was at present threatened.
The King had removed him from the city-prison, where
he was exposed to be tampered with by the exclusionists;
had sent him to the Tower; and had ordered him to
be prosecuted by an indictment at common law. In or∣der
to prevent his trial, and execution, an impeachment
was voted by the Commons against him, and sent up to
the Lords. That they might show, the greater contempt
of the Court, they ordered, by way of derision, that
the impeachment should be carried up by secretary Jen∣kins;
who was so provoked by the intended affront, that
he at first refused obedience; tho' afterwards, being
threatened with commitment, he was induced to com∣ply
The Lords voted to remit the affair to the ordi∣nary
courts of judicature, before whom, as the attor∣ney-general
informed them, it was already determined to
try Fitz-harris. The Commons maintained, that the
Peers were obliged to receive every impeachment from
the Commons; and this indeed seems to have been the
first instance of their refusal: They therefore voted, that
the Lords, in rejecting their impeachment, had denied
justice, and had violated the constitution of Parliament.
They also declared, that whatever inferior court should
proceed against Fitz-harris, or any one that lay under
<PB N="151" REF="191"/>
impeachment, would be guilty of a high breach of pri∣vilege.
Great heats were likely to ensue; and as the
King found no likelihood of any better temper in the
Commons, he gladly laid hold of the opportunity, af∣forded
by a quarrel between the two Houses, and he pro∣ceeded
to a dissolution of the Parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament dissolved.</NOTE> The secret
was so well kept, that the Commons had no intimation
of it, till the black rod came to their door, and sum∣moned
them to attend the King at the House of Peers.</P>
<P>THIS vigorous measure, tho' it might have been fore∣seen,
excited such astonishment in the country party, as
deprived them of all spirit, and reduced them to absolute
despair. They were sensible, tho' too late, that the
King had finally taken his resolution, and was deter∣mined
to endure any extremity rather than submit to
those terms, which they had resolved to impose upon
him. They found, that he had patiently waited till af∣fairs
should come to full maturity; and having now
engaged a national party on his side, had boldly set his
enemies at defiance. No Parliaments, they knew,
would be summoned for some years; and during that long
interval, the Court, tho' perhaps at the head of an infe∣rior
party, yet being possessed of all authority, would
have every advantage over a body, dispersed and disu∣nited.
These reflections crowded upon every one; and
all the exclusionists were terrified, left Charles should se∣cond
the blow by some action more violent, and im∣mediately
take vengeance on them for their long and ob∣stinate
opposition to his measures. The King on his part
was no less apprehensive, left despair might engage them
to have recourse to force, and make some sudden attempt
upon his person. Both parties therefore hurried away from
Oxford; and in an instant, that city, so crowded and
busy, was left in its usual emptiness and tranquillity.</P>
<P>THE court party gathered force from the dispersion and
astonishment of their antagonists, and adhered more firmly
<PB N="150" REF="192"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="151" REF="193"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="152" REF="194"/>
to the King, whose resolutions, they now saw, could
be entirely depended on. The violence of the exclusi∣onists
was every<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>where exclaimed against and aggravated;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Victory of the Roya∣lists.</NOTE>
and even the reality of the plot, that great engine of their
authority, was openly called in question. The clergy
especially were busy in this great revolution; and be∣ing
moved, partly by their own fears, partly by the in∣sinuations
of the Court, they represented all their anta∣gonists
as Sectaries and Republicans, and rejoiced in
escaping all those perils, which they believed to have
been hanging over them. Principles, the most opposite
to civil liberty, were every where inforced from the pul∣pit;
and adopted in numerous addresses; where the King
was flattered in his present measures, and congratulated
on his escape from Parliaments. Could words have been
depended on, the nation appeared to be running fast into
voluntary servitude, and seemed even ambitious of re∣signing
into the King's hands all the privileges, trans∣mitted
to them, thro' so many ages, by their gallant
ancestors.</P>
<P>BUT Charles had sagacity enough to distinguish be∣tween
men's real internal sentiments, and the language,
which zeal and opposition to a contrary saction may some∣times
extort from them. Notwithstanding all these pro∣fessions
of duty and obedience, he was resolved not to
trust, for a long time, the people with a new election,
but to depend entirely on his own oeconomy for allevi∣ating
those necessities, under which he laboured. Great
retrenchments were made in the houshold: Even his fa∣vourite
navy was neglected: Tangiers, tho' it had cost
great sums of money, was a few years after abandoned
and demolished. The mole was entirely destroyed; and
the garrison, being brought over to England, served to
augment that small army, which the King relied on, as
one solid basis of his authority. It had been happy for
the nation, had Charles used. his victory with justice
<PB N="153" REF="195"/>
and moderation equal to the prudence and dexterity,
with which he obtained it.</P>
<P>THE first step, taken by the court, was the trial of
Fitz-harris. Doubts were raised by the jury with regard
to their power of trying him, after the concluding vote
of the Commons: But the judges took upon them to
decide the question in the assirmative; and the jury were
obliged to proceed. The writing the libel was clearly
proved upon Fitz-harris: The only question was with regard
to his intentions. He afferted, that he was a spy of the
Court, and had accordingly carried the libel to the dutch∣ess
of Portsmouth; and he was desirous, that the jury
should, in this transaction, consider him as a cheat,
not as a traitor. He failed however somewhat in the
proof; and was brought in guilty of treason by the jury.</P>
<P>FINDING himself entirely in the hands of the King, he
now retracted all his former impostures with regard to the
popish plot, and even endeavoured to attone for them by
new impostures against the country party. He affirmed,
that these fictions had been extorted from him by the sug∣gestions
and artifices of Treby the recorder, and of Bethel
and Cornish, the two sheriffs. This account he persisted
in even at his execution; and tho' men knew, that no∣thing
could be depended on, which came from one so
corrupt, and so lost to all sense of honour; yet were they
inclined, from his perseverance, to rely somewhat more
on his veracity in these last asseverations. But it appears
that his wise had some connexions with Mrs. Wall,
the favourite maid of the dutchess of Portsmouth; and
fitz-harris hoped, if he persisted in a story agreeable to
the Court, that some favour might on that account be
shown to his family.</P>
<P>IT is amusing to reflect on the several lights, in which
this story has been represented by the opposite sactions.
The country party affirmed, that Fitz-harris had been
employed by the Court, in order to throw the odium of
<PB N="154" REF="196"/>
the libel on the exclusionists, and thereby give rise to a
protestant plot: The court party maintained, that the
exclusionists had found out Fitz-harris, a spy of the mini∣sters,
and had set him upon this undertaking, from an
intention of loading the Court with the imputation of
such a design upon the exclusionists. Rather than acquit
their antagonists, both sides were willing to adopt an ac∣count
the most intricate and incredible. It was a strange
situation, in which the people, at that time, were
placed; to be every day tortured with these perplexed sto∣ries,
and inflamed with such dark su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>picions against their
fellow-citizens. This was no less than the fifteenth false
plot, or sham plot, as they were then called, with which
the court, it was imagined, had endeavoured to load their
adversaries<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">College's trial.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE country party had intended to make use of Fitz∣harris's
evidence against the Duke and the Catholics;
and his execution was therefore a great mortification to
them. But the King and his ministers were resolved not
to be contented with so slender an advantage. They
were determined to prosecute the victory, and to employ
against the exclusionists those very offensive arms, how∣ever
unfair, which that party had laid up in store against
their antagonists. The whole gang of spies, witnesses, in∣formers,
suborners, who had so long been supported and
encouraged by the leading patriots, finding now that the
King was entirely master, turned short upon their old
patrons, and offered their service to the ministers. To
the disgrace of the Court and of the age, they were re∣ceived
with hearty welcome; and their testimony or ra∣ther
perjury made use of, in order to commit legal mur∣der
upon the opposite party. With an air of triumph and
derision it was asked, “Are not these men good witnesses,
who have established the popish plot, upon whose te∣stimony
Stafford and so many Catholics have been ex∣ecuted,
<PB N="155" REF="197"/>
and whom you yourselves have so long cele∣brated
as men of credit and veracity? You have ad∣mitted
them into your bosom: They are best acquainted
with your treason: They are determined in another
shape to serve their King and country: And you can∣not
complain, that the same measure, which you meted
to others, should now, by a righteous doom or ven∣geance,
be measured out to you.”</P>
<P>IT is certain, that the principle of retaliation may serve
in some cases as a full apology, in others as an alleviation,
for a conduct which would otherwise be exposed to great
blame. But these infamous arts, which poison justice
in its very source, and break all the bands of human
society, are so detestable and dangerous, that no pretence
of retalation can be pleaded as an apology or even an al∣leviation
for the crime incurred by them. On the con∣trary,
the greater indignation the King and his ministers,
felt, when formely exposed to the perjuries of abandoned
men, the more reluctance should they now have discove∣red
against employing the same instruments of vengeance
upon their antagonists.</P>
<P>THE first person, on whom the ministers fell, was one
College, a London joiner, who had become extremely no∣ted
for his zeal against popery, and was very much con∣nected
with Shaftesbury and all the leaders of the country
party: For as they relied much upon the populace, men
of College's rank and station were very useful to them.
College had been in Oxford armed with sword and pistol
during the sitting of the Parliament; and this was made
the foundation of his crime. It was pretended that a
conspiracy had been entered into to seize the King's person,
and retain him in confinement, till he should make the
concessions demanded of him. The sheriffs of London
were in strong opposition to the Court; and it was not
strange, that the grand jury named by them rejected the
bill against College. The prisoner was therefore sent to
<PB N="156" REF="198"/>
Oxford, where the treason was said to have been com∣mitted.
Lord Norris, a courtier, was sheriff of the
county; and the inhabitants were in general extremely
devoted to the court party. A jury was named, consist∣ing
entirely of Royalists; and tho' they were men of
credit and character, yet such was the factious rage, which
prevailed, that little justice could be expected by the pri∣soner.
Some papers, containing hints and directions for
his defence, were taken from him, as he was conducted
to his trial: An iniquity, which some pretended to justify
by alleging, that a like violence had been committed
against a prisoner during the fury of the popish plot.
Such wild notions of retaliation were at that time propa∣gated
by the court party.</P>
<P>THE witnesses produced against College were Dug∣dale,
Turberville, Haynes, Smith; men who had be∣fore
given evidence against the Catholics, and whom the
jury, for that very reason, regarded as the most perjured
lyars. College, tho' beset with so many toils, oppressed
with so many iniquities, defended himself with spirit,
courage, capacity, presence of mind; and he invalidated
the evidence of the Crown, by the most convincing ar∣guments
and the most undoubted testimony: Yet did the
jury, after half an hour's deliberation, bring in a verdict
against him. The inhuman spectators received the news
with a shout of applause: But the prisoner was no wise
dismayed. At his execution, he maintained the same
manly fortitude, and still denied the crime imputed to
him. His whole conduct and demeanour prove him to
have been a man led astray only by the fury of the times,
and to have been governed by a very honest, but indis∣creet
zeal for his country and his religion.</P>
<P>THUS the two parties, actuated by mutual rage, but
cooped up within the narrow limits of the law, levelled
with poisoned daggers the most deadly blows against each
other's breast, and buried in their factious divisions all re∣gard
to truth, honour, and morality.</P>

<P>WHEN the Cabal entered into the mysterious alliance
with France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXIX.</NOTE> they took care to remove the Duke
of Ormond from the committee of foreign affairs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1681.</NOTE> and
nothing tended farther to encrease the national jealousy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of affairs in Ireland.</NOTE>
entertained against the new measures, than to see a man
of so much loyalty, as well as probity, and honour, ex∣cluded
from all their councils. They had even so great
interest with the King as to get Ormond recalled from
the government of Ireland; and lord Robarts, afterwards
earl of Radnor, succceded him in that important employ∣ment.
Lord Berkly succeeded Robarts; and the earl of
Essex, Berkely. At last in the year 1677, Charles cast
his eyes again upon Ormond, whom he had so long ne∣glected;
and sent him over lieutenant to Ireland. “I have
done every thing,” said the King, “to disoblige that
man; but it is not in my power to make him my ene∣my.”
Ormond, during his disgrace, had never join∣ed
the malecontents, nor encouraged those clamours,
<PB N="158" REF="200"/>
which, with too much reason, but often for bad pur∣poses,
were raised against the King's measures. He even
thought it his duty, regularly, tho' with dignity, to
pay his court at Whitehall; and to prove that his at∣tachments
were founded on gratitude, inclination, and
principle, not on any temporary advantages. All the
expressions, which dropped from him, while neglected by
the Court, showed more of good humour, than any pre∣valence
of spleen and indignation. “I can do you no ser∣vice,”
said he to his friends, “I have only the power
left by my applications to do you some hurt.” When
colonel Cary Dillon sollicited him to second his preten∣sions
at Court, and urged that he had no friends but
God and his grace. “Alas! poor Cary,” replied the duke,
“I pity thee; Thou couldst not have two friends, that
possess less interest at Court. I am thrown by,” said
he, on another occasion, “like an old rusty clock; yet
even that neglected machine twice in twenty-four
hours points right.”</P>
<P>WHEN Charles found it his interest to show favour to
the old Royalists and to the church of England, Ormond,
who was extremely revered by that whole party, could
not fail of recovering, together with the government of
Ireland, his former credit and authority. His admini∣stration,
when lord lieutenant, was correspondent to the
general tenor of his life; and tended equally to promote
the interest of Prince and people, of Protestant and Ca∣tholic.
Ever firmly attached to the established religion,
he was able, even during these jealous times, to escape
suspicion, tho' he gratified not vulgar prejudices by any
persecution of the popish party. He encreased the re∣venue
of Ireland to three hundred thousand pounds a year:
He maintained a regular army of ten thousand men: He
supported a well disciplined militia of twenty thousand
And tho' the act of settlement had so far been infringed
that Catholics were permitted to live in corporate towns
<PB N="159" REF="201"/>
they were guarded with so careful an eye, that the most timo∣rous
Protestant never apprehended any danger from them.</P>
<P>THE chief object of Essex's ambition was to return
to the station of lord lieutenant, where he had behaved
with honour and integrity: Shaftesbury and Buckingham
bore an extreme hatred to Ormond, both from personal
and party considerations: The great aim of the anti∣courtiers
was to throw reflections on every part of the
King's government. It could be no surprize, therefore,
to the lord lieutenant to learn, that his administration was
attacked in Parliament, particularly by Shaftesbury; but
he had the satisfaction, at the same time, to hear of the keen,
tho' polite defence, made by his son, the generous Ossory. After Justifying several particulars of Ormond's admini∣stration
against that intriguing patriot, Ossory proceeded
in the following words: “Having spoke of what the
lord lieutenant has done, I presume with the same truth
to tell your lordships what he has not done. He never
advised the breaking of the triple league; he never ad∣vised the shutting up of the Exchequer; he never
advised the declaration for a toleration; he never ad∣vised
the falling out with the Dutch and the joining
with France: He was not the author of that most ex∣cellent
position <HI>Delenda est Carthago,</HI> that Holland, a
protestant country, should, contrary to the true inte∣rest
of England, be totally destroyed. I beg, that
your lordships will be so just as judge of my father
and all men, according to their actions and their coun∣cils.”
These few sentences, pronounced by a plain
and gallant soldier, noted for probity, had a surprizing
effect upon the audience, and confounded all the rhe∣toric
of his eloquent and factious adversary. The prince
of Orange, who esteemed the former character as much
as he despised the latter, could not forbear congratulating
by letter the earl of Ossory on this new species of victory,
which he had obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="202"/>
OSSORY, tho' he ever kept at a great distance from
faction, was the most popular man in the kingdom; tho'
he never made any compliance with the corrupt views of
the Court, was extremely beloved and respected by the
King. An universal grief appeared on his death, which
happened about this time, and which the populace, as
is usual wherever they are much affected, foolishly ascri∣bed
to poison. Ormond bore the loss with patience
and dignity; tho' he ever retained a pleasing, however
melancholy, sense of the signal merit of Ossory. “I
would not exchange my dead son,” said he, “for any
living son in Christendom.”</P>
<P>THESE particularities may appear a digression; but
'tis with pleasure, I own, that I relax myself for a mo∣ment
in the contemplation of these humane and virtu∣ous
characters, amidst that scene of fury and faction,
fraud and violence, in which at present our narration has
unfortunately engaged us.</P>
<P>BESIDES the general interest of the country party to
decry the conduct of all the King's ministers, the pru∣dent
and peaceable administration of Ormond was in a
particular manner displeasing to them. In England,
where the Catholics were scarce one to a hundred, means
had been found to excite an universal panic, on account
of insurrections and even massacres, projected by that
sect; and it could not but seem strange that in Ireland,
where they exceeded the Protestants ten to one, there
should no symptoms appear of any combination or con∣spiracy.
Such an incident, when duly considered, might
even in England shake the credit of the plot, and di∣minish
the authority of those leaders, who had so long,
with such industry, inculcated the belief of it on the
nation. Rewards therefore were published in Ireland to any that would bring
intelligence or become witnesses;
and some profligates were sent over to that kingdom, with
a commission to seek out evidence against the Catholics.
<PB N="161" REF="203"/>
Under pretence of searching for arms or papers, they
broke into houses; and, plundered them: They threw
innocent men into prison, and took bribes for their re∣lease:
And after all their diligence, it was with difficulty,
that that country; commonly fertile enough in witnesses;
could furnish them with any fit for their purpose.</P>
<P>AT last, a Certain Fitzgerald appeared, followed by
two Macnamaras, Ivey, Sanson, Dennis, Bourke, and
some others. These men were immediately sent over to
England; and tho' they possessed neither character, suf∣ficient
to gain belief even for truth, nor sense to invent
a credible falshood they were caressed rewarded, sup∣ported,
and recommended by the earl of Shaftesbury.
Oliver Plunket, the titular primate of Ireland, a man of
very peaceable dispositions, was condemned and exe∣cuted
upon such testimony. And the Oxford-Parliament
entered so far into the matter as to vote that they were
entirely satisfied in the reality of the <HI>horrid</HI> and <HI>damnable</HI>
Irish plot. But such decisions, tho' at first regarded as
Infallible, had now lost much of their authority; and
the public still remained somewhat indifferent and incre∣dulous.</P>
<P>AFTER the dissolution of the Parliament, and the sub∣sequent
victory of the Royalists, Shaftesbury's evidences,
with Turberville, Smith, and others, addressed them∣selves
to the ministers, and gave information of high
treason against their former patron. It is sufficiently
scandalous, that intelligence, conveyed by such men,
should have been attended to; but there is some reason
to think, that the Court agents, nay the ministers, nay
the King himself<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See captain Wilkinson's Narrative.</NOTE>, went farther, and were active in en∣deavouring,
tho' in vain, to find more reputable persons
to support the blasted credit of the Irish witnesses. Shaftes∣bury
was committed to prison, and his indictment was
presented to the grand jury. The new sheriffs of Lon∣don
<PB N="162" REF="204"/>
don, Shute and Pilkington, were engaged as deeply as
their predecessors in the country party; and they took
care to name a jury extremely devoted to the same cause:
A precaution quite requisite, when it was scarce possible
to find men indifferent or attached to neither party. As
far as swearing could go, the treason was clearly proved
against Shaftesbury; or rather so clearly as to merit no
kind of credit or attention.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shaftesbury acquitted.</NOTE> That veteran leader of a
party, enured from his early youth to faction and in∣trigue,
to cabals and conspiracies, was represented as open∣ing
without reserve his treasonable intentions to these
obscure banditti, and throwing out such violent and out∣rageous
reproaches upon the King, as none but men of
low education, like themselves, could be supp∣sed to
employ. The draught of an association, it is true,
against popery and the Duke, was found in Shaftes∣bury's
cabinet; and dangerous inferences might be
drawn from many clauses of that paper. But it
did not appear that it had been framed by Shaftes∣bury,
or so much as approved by him. And as projects of an association had been proposed in Parlia∣ment,
it was very natural for that nobleman to be think∣ing
of some plan, which it might be proper to lay before
that assembly. The grand jury, therefore, after weigh∣ing
all these circumstances, rejected the indictment; and
the people, who attended the hall, testified their joy, by
the loudest acclamations, which were echoed thro' the
whole city.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time a scheme of oppression was laid in
Scotland, after a manner still more flagrant, against a
nobleman much less obnoxious than Shaftesbury; and as
that country was reduced almost to a state of total sub∣jection,
the project had the fortune to succeed.</P>
<P>THE earl of Argyle, from his youth, had distinguish∣ed
himself by his loyalty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle's trial.</NOTE> and his attachment to the royal
family. Tho' his father was head of the Covenanters,
<PB N="163" REF="205"/>
he refused to concur in any of their measures; and when
a commission of colonel was given him by the conven∣tion
of states, he forbore to act upon it, till it should be
ratified by the King. By his respectful behaviour, as
well as by his services, he made himself very acceptable to
Charles, when that Prince was in Scotland; and even
after the battle of Worcester, all the misfortunes, which
attended the royal cause, could not engage him to desert it.
Under Middleton he obstinately persevered to harrass
and infest the victorious English; and it was not till he
received orders from that general, that he would submit
to accept of a capitulation. Such jealousy of his loyal
attachments was entertained by the Commonwealth and
Protestor, that a pretence was soon after fallen upon to
commit him to prison; and his confinement was rigo∣rously
continued till the restoration. The King, sensible
of his services, had remitted to him his father's forfeiture,
and created him earl of Argyle; and when a most unjust
sentence was passed upon him by the Scots Parliament,
Charles had anew remitted it. In the subsequent part of
the reign, Argyle behaved himself dutifully; and tho' he
seemed not disposed to go all lengths with the Court, he
always appeared, even in his opposition, a man of mild
dispositions and peaceable deportment.</P>
<P>A PARLIAMENT was summoned at Edinburgh this
summer, and the Duke was appointed commissioner. Be∣sides
granting money to the king and voting the indefea∣sible
right of succession, this Parliament enacted a test,
which all persons, possessed of offices, civil, military, or
ecclesiastical, were bound to take. In this test, the
King's supremacy was affirmed, the covenant renounced,
passive obedience assented to, and all obligations dis∣claimed
of endeavouring any alterations in church or
state. This was the state of the test, as proposed by the
courtiers: but the country party proposed also a clause
of adherence to the protestant religion, which could not
<PB N="164" REF="206"/>
with decency be refused. The whole was of an enor∣mous
length considered as an oath; and what was worse,
a confession of faith was there ratified; which had been
imposed a little after the reformation, and which contain∣ed
a great many articles, altogether forgot by the Par∣liament
and nation. Among others, the doctrine of re∣sistance
was inculcated; so that the test, being voted in
a hurry, was found on examination to be a medley of
contradiction and absurdity. Several persons, the most
attached to the Crown, serupled to take it. The bishops
and many of the clergy remonstrated: The earl of
Qucensbury refused to swear, except he might be allow∣ed
to add an explanation: And even the privy council
thought it necessary to publish for general satisfaction a
solution of some difficulties, attending the test.</P>
<P>Tho' the courtiers could not reject the clause of adhe∣rence
to the protestant religion, they proposed, as a re∣qursite
mark of respect, that all Princes of the blood
should be exempted from taking that oath. This excep∣tion
was zealously opposed by Argyle, who observed,
that the sole danger to be dreaded for the protestant reli∣gion
must proceed from the perversion of the royal family.
By insisting on such topics, he drew on himself the secret
indignation of the Duke, of which he soon felt the fatal
effects.</P>
<P>WHEN Argyle took the test as a privy counsellor, he
subjoined, in the Duke's presence, an explanation,
which he had beforehand communicated to that Prince,
and which he believed to have been approved by him. It
was in these words. “I have considered the test, and
am very desirous of giving obedience as far as I can. I
am confident, that the Parliament never intended to
impose contradictory oaths: Therefore I think no
man can explain it but for himself. Accordingly, I
take it as far as it is consistent with itself, and the prote∣stant
religion. And I do declare, that I mean not to
<PB N="165" REF="207"/>
bind up myself, in my station, and in a lawful way,
from wishing and endeavouring any alteration, which
I think to the advantage of church or state, and not
repugnant to the protestant religion and my loyalty:
And this I understand as a part of my oath.” The
Duke, as was natural, heard these words with great
tranquillity: no one took the least offence: Argyle was
admitted to sit that day in council: And it was impossible
to imagine, that a capital offence had been committed,
where occasion seemed not to have been given, so much
as for a frown or reprimand.</P>
<P>ARGYLE was much surprized, a few days after, to
find that a warrant was issued for committing him to pri∣son;
that he was indicted for high treason, leasing-mak∣ing
and perjury; and that from these innocent words an
accusation was extracted, by which he was to forfeit ho∣nours,
life, and fortune. It is needless to enter into
particulars, where the iniquity of the whole is so appa∣rent.
Tho' the sword of justice was displayed, even
her semblance was not put on; and the forms alone of
law were preserved, in order to sanctify, or rather aggra∣vate
the oppression. Of five judges, three did not scru∣ple
to find the guilt of treason and leasing-making to be
incurred by the prisoner: A jury of fifteen noblemen
gave verdict against him: And the King, being con∣sulted,
ordered the sentence to be pronounced; but the
execution of it to be suspended, till farther pleasure.</P>
<P>IT was pretended by the Duke and his creatures, that
Argyle's life and fortune were not in any danger, and that
the sole reason for pushing the trial to such extremities
against him was in order to make him renounce some
hereditary jurisdictions, which gave his family a dange∣rous
authority in the Highlands, and checked the course
of public justice. But allowing the end to be justifiable,
the means were infamous; and such as were incompa∣tible,
not only with a free, but a civilized government,
<PB N="166" REF="208"/>
Argyle had therefore no reason to trust any longer to the
justice or mercy of such enemies: He made his escape
from prison; and till he should find a ship for Holland,
he concealed himself during some time in London. The
King heard of his lurking-place, but would not allow
him to be arrested<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 522.</NOTE>. All the parts however of his sen∣tence,
so far as the government in Scotland had power,
were rigorously executed; his estate confiscated, his arms
reversed and torne.</P>
<P>IT would seem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of affairs in Scotland.</NOTE> that the genuine passion for liberty was
at this time totally extinguished in Scotland: There was
only preserved a spirit of mutiny and sedition, encouraged
by a mistaken zeal for religion. Cameron and Cargil,
two furious preachers, went a step beyond all their bre∣thren:
They publickly excommunicated the King for his
tyranny and his breach of the covenant, and renounced all
allegiance to him. Cameron was killed by the troops in an
action at Airs-Moss; Cargil was taken and hanged. Many
of their followers were tried and convicted. Their lives
were offered them if they would say <HI>God save the King:</HI>
But they would only agree to pray for his repentance.
This obstinacy was much insisted on as an apology for
the rigors of the administration: But, if duly considered,
it will rather afford reason for a contrary inference. Such
unhappy delusion is an object rather of commiseration
than of anger; And it is almost impossible, that men
could have been carried to such a degree of madness, un∣less
provoked by a long train of violence and oppression.</P>
<P>AS the King was master in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1682.</NOTE> and no longer
dreaded the clamours of the country party, he permitted
the Duke to pay him a visit; and was soon after prevailed
on to allow of his return to England, and of his bearing
a part in the administration. The Duke went to Scot∣land
in order to bring up his family, and settle the go∣vernment
<PB N="167" REF="209"/>
of that country; and he chose to take his pas∣sage
by sea. The ship struck on a sand-bank, and was
lost: The Duke escaped in the barge; and it is pretended,
that, while many persons of rank and quality were
drowned, and among the rest, Hyde, his brother-in-law,
he was very careful to save several of his dogs and priests:
For these two species of favourites are coupled together
by some writers. It has likewise been asserted, that the
barge might safely have held more persons, and that some
who swam to it were thrust off, and even their hands cut
in order to disengage them. But every action of every
eminent person, during this period, is so liable to be mis∣interpreted
and misrepresented by faction, that we ought
to be very cautious of passing our judgment on too slight
an evidence. It is remarkable, that the sailors on board
the ship, though they felt themselves sinking, and saw
inevitable death before their eyes, yet so soon as they ob∣served
the Duke to be in safety, gave a loud shout, in
testimony of their joy and satisfaction.</P>
<P>THE Duke, during his abode in Scotland, had be∣haved
with great civility towards the gentry and nobi∣lity:
and by his courtly demeanour had much won upon
their affections: But his treatment of the enthusiasts was
still somewhat rigorous; and in many instances he ap∣peared
to be a man of a severe, if not an unrelenting
temper. It is even asserted, that he usually assisted with
his presence at the torture of criminals, and looked on
with tranquillity, as if he were considering some curious
experiment<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 583. Wodrow, vol. ii. p. 169. This last author, who is much the better authority, mentions only one instance, that of Spreul, which seems to have been an extraordinary one.</NOTE>. He left the authority in the hands of the
earl of Aberdeen, chancellor, and the earl of Queens∣bury,
treasurer: A very arbitrary spirit appeared in their
administration. A gentleman of the name of Weir was
tried, because he had kept company with one who had
<PB N="168" REF="210"/>
been in the rebellion; though that person had never been
marked out by process or proclamation. The inferences
upon which Weir was condemned (for a prosecution by
the government and a condemnation were in Scotland the
same thing) hung upon each other, after the following
manner. No man, it was supposed, could have been in a
rebellion, without being exposed to suspicion in the neigh∣bourhood:
If the neighbourhood had suspected him, it
was to be presumed, that each individual had likewise
heard of the grounds of suspicion: Every man was bound
to declare to the government his suspicion against every
man, and to avoid the company of traitors: To fail in
this duty was to participate in the treason: The conclu∣sion
on the whole was, You have conversed with a rebel,
therefore you are yourself a rebel. A reprieve was with
some difficulty procured for Weir; but it was seriously
determined to make use of the precedent. Courts of ju∣dicature
were erected in the southern and western coun∣ties,
and a strict inquisition carried on against this new
species of crime. The term of three years was prescribed
for the continuance of these courts; after which an in∣demnity
was promised. Whoever would take the test,
was instantly entitled to the benefit of this indemnity.
The Presbyterians, alarmed with such tyranny, from
which no man could deem himself safe, began to think
of leaving the country; and some of their agents were
lent to England, in order to treat with the proprietors of
Carolina for a settlement in that colony. Any condition
seemed preferable to the living in their native country,
which, by the prevalence of persecution and violence,
was become as insecure to them as a den of robbers.</P>
<P>ABOVE two thousand persons were out-lawed on pre∣tence
of their conversing or having intercourse with re∣bels<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wodrow, vol. ii. Appendix, 94.</NOTE>,
and they were continually hunted in their retreats
<PB N="169" REF="211"/>
by soldiers, spies, informers, and oppressive magistrates.
It was usual to put ensnaring questions to people, living
peaceably in their own houses; such as, “Will you re∣nounce
the Covenant? Do you esteem the rising at
Bothwel to be rebellion? Was the killing the arch∣bishop
of St. Andrew's a murder?” And when the
poor deluded creatures refused to answer, capital punish∣ments
were inflicted on them<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Wodrow, vol. ii. passim.</NOTE>. Even women were
brought to the gibbet for this pretended crime. A num∣ber
of fugitives, rendered frantic by oppression, had
published a seditious declaration; renouncing allegiance
to Charles Stuart, whom they called, as they, for their
parts, had indeed some reason to esteem him, a tyrant.
This incident afforded the privy council a pretence for a
very unusual kind of oppression. Soldiers were dispersed
over the country, and power was given to all commission
officers, even the most inferior, to oblige every one
whom they met with, to abjure the declaration; and
upon refusal, instantly, without farther questions, to
shoot the delinquent<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Id. vol. ii. p. 434.</NOTE>. It were endless, as well as
shocking, to enumerate all the instances of persecution,
or, in other words, of absurd tyranny, which at that
time prevailed in Scotland. One of them however is so
singular, that I cannot forbear relating it.</P>
<P>THREE women were seized<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Id. vol. ii. p. 505.</NOTE>; and the customary oath
was tendered to them, by which they were to abjure the
seditious declaration above-mentioned. They all refused,
and were condemned to a capital punishment by drown∣ing.
One of them was an elderly woman: The other
two were very young; one eighteen years of age, the
other only thirteen. Even these violent persecutors were
ashamed to put the youngest to death: But the other two
were conducted to the place of execution, and were tied
to stakes within the sea-mark at low water: A contrivance,
<PB N="170" REF="212"/>
which rendered their death lingering and dreadful. The
elderly woman was placed farthest in, and by the rising
of the waters was first suffocated. The younger partly
terrified with the view of her companion's death, partly
subdued by the entreaty of her friends, was prevailed
with to say <HI>God save the King.</HI> Immediately the spectators
called out, that she had submitted; and she was loosened
from the stake. Major Winram, the officer who guarded
the execution, again required her to sign the abjuration;
and upon her refusal, he ordered her instantly to be
plunged in the water, where she was suffocated.</P>
<P>THE severity of the administration in Scotland is in
part to be ascribed to the Duke's temper, to whom the
King had consigned over the government of that coun∣try,
and who gave such attention to affairs as to allow
nothing of importance to escape him. Even the go∣vernment
of England from the same cause began some∣what
to be infected with the same severity. The Duke's
credit was very great at Court. Tho' neither so much
beloved nor esteemed as the King, he was more dreaded;
and thence an attendance more exact, as well as a sub∣mission
more obsequious, was paid him. The saying of
Waller was remarked, that Charles, in spite to the Par∣liament,
who had determined, that the Duke should not
succeed him, was resolved, that he should reign even in
his lifetime.</P>
<P>THE King however, who loved to maintain a balance
in his councils, still supported Halifax, whom he created
a marquess, and made lord privy seal; tho' ever in op∣position
to the Duke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the Ministry in England.</NOTE> This man, who possessed the
finest genius and most extensive capacity, of all employed
in public affairs during the present reign, affected a spe∣cies
of neutrality between the parties, and was esteemed
the head of that small body, known by the denomination
of <HI>Trimmers.</HI> This conduct, which is much more na∣tural
to men of integrity than of ambition, could not
<PB N="171" REF="213"/>
however procure him the former character; and he was
always with reason, regarded as an intriguer rather than
a patriot. Sunderland, who had promoted the exclusion∣bill,
and who had been displaced on that account, was
again, with the Duke's consent, brought into the admi∣nistration.
The extreme duplicity, at least variableness,
of this man's conduct thro' the whole course of his life,
made it be suspected, that it was by the King's direction
he had mixed with the country party. Hyde, created
earl of Rochester, was first commissioner of the treasury,
and was entirely in the Duke's interest.</P>
<P>THE King himself was obliged to act as the head of
a party; a disagreeable situation for a Prince, and always
the source of much injustice and oppression. He knew
how obnoxious the dissenters were to the church; and
he resolved, contrary to the maxims of toleration, which
he had hitherto supported in England, to gratify his
friends by the persecution of his enemies. The laws
against conventicles were now rigorously executed; an
expedient, which, the King knew, would neither dimi∣nish
the numbers nor influence of the Nonconformists;
and which is therefore to be deemed more the result of
passion than of policy. Scarce any persecution serves the
intended purpose but such as amounts to a total extermi∣nation.</P>
<P>Tho' the King's authority made every day great ad∣vances,
it still met with considerable obstacles, chiefly
from the city, which was entirely in the hands of the
malecontents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New nomi∣nation of sheriffs.</NOTE> The juries, in particular, named by the
sheriffs, were not likely to be impartial judges between
the Crown, and the people, and after the experiments
already made in the case of Shaftesbury and that of Col∣lege,
treason, it was apprehended, might there be com∣mitted
with impunity. There could not therefore be a
more important service to the Court than to put affairs
a different footing. Sir John Moor, lord mayor,
<PB N="170" REF="214"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="171" REF="215"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="172" REF="216"/>
was gained by secretary Jenkins, and encouraged to insist
upon the customary privilege of his office, of naming one
of the sheriffs. Accordingly, when the time of election
came, he drank to North, a Levant merchant, who ac∣cepted
that expensive office. The country party said,
that, being lately returned from Turkey, he was, on
account of his recent experience, better qualified to serve
the purposes of the Court. A poll was opened for the
election of another sheriff; and here began the contest.
The majority of the common-hall, headed by the two
sheriffs of the former year, refused to acknowledge
the mayor's right of nominating one sheriff, but insisted
that both must be elected by the liveries.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of June.</NOTE> Papillon and
Dubois were the persons whom the country party agreed
to elect: Box was pointed out by the courtiers. Books
were accordingly opened for the poll; but as the mayor
would not allow the elections to proceed for two vacan∣cies,
the sheriffs and he separated, and each carried on
the poll apart. The country party, who voted with the
sheriffs for Papillon, and Dubois, were much more nu∣merous
than those who voted with the mayor for Box.
But as the mayor insisted, that his books were the only
legal ones, he declared Box to be duly elected. All dif∣ficulties
however were not surmounted. Box, apprehen∣sive
of the consequences of so dubious an election, fined
off; and the mayor found it requisite to proceed to a
new election. When the matter was proposed to the
common-hall, a loud cry was raised, No election! No
election! The two sheriffs already elected, Papillon and
Dubois, were insisted on as the only legal magistrates.
But as the mayor still maintained, that Box alone had
been legally chosen, and that it was now requisite to sup∣ply
his place, he opened books anew, and during the
tumult, and confusion of the citizens, a few of the
mayor's partizans elected Rich, unknown to and un∣heeded
by the rest of the liveries. North and Rich were
<PB N="173" REF="217"/>
accordingly sworn sheriffs for the ensuing year; but it
was necessary to send a guard of the train bands to pro∣tect
them in the entering upon their office.<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of Oc∣tober.</NOTE> A new mayor
of the court party was soon after chosen by means, as is
pretended, much more violent and irregular.</P>
<P>THUS the country party were dislodged from their
strong hold in the city, where, ever since the commence∣ment
of factions in the English government, they had,
without interruption, almost without molestation, main∣tained
a superiority. It had been happy, had the parti∣alities,
hitherto objected to juries, been corrected, with∣out
giving place to partialites of an opposite kind: But
in the present distracted state of the nation, an equitable
neutrality was almost impossible to be attained. The
court and church party, who were now named on juries,
made justice subservient to their factious views; and the King
had a prospect of obtaining full revenge on his enemies. It
was not long before the effects of these alterations were
seen. When it was first reported, that the Duke intended to
leave Scotland, Pilkington, at that time sheriff, a very
violent man, had broke out in these terms, “He has
already burned the city, and is he now coming to
cut all our throats?” For these scandalous expressions,
the Duke sued Pilkington; and enormous damages,
to the amount of 100,000 pounds, were decreed him.
By the law of England, ratified in the great charter,
no fine ought to extend to the total ruin of a criminal.
Sir Patience Ward, formerly mayor, who gave evidence
for Pilkington, was sued for perjury, and condemned to
the pillory: A severe sentence, and sufficient to deter all
witnesses from appearing in favour of those, who were
prosecuted by the Court.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the crown had obtained so great a victory
in the city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1683.</NOTE> it was not quite decisive; and the contest
might be renewed every year at the election of magistrates.
<PB N="174" REF="218"/>
An important project therefore was formed, riot only to
make the King master of the city but by that example
to gain him the ascendant in all the corporations of Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quo war∣ran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os.</NOTE>
and thereby give the greatest wound to the legal
constitution, which the most powerful and most arbitrary
Monarchs had ever yet been able to inflict. All the Roya∣lists,
tho' Englishmen, and even, to a certain degree,
lovers of liberty, were yet induced, from enmity to the
opposite faction, and from the desire of superiority, to
concur in this violent measure. A writ of <HI>quo warranto</HI>
was issued against the city; that is, an enquiry into the
validity of their charter. It was pretended that the city
had forfeited all its privileges, and ought to be declared
no longer a corporation, on account of two offences;
which the court of aldermen and common council had
committed. After the great fire in 1666, all the mar∣kets
had been rebuilt and had been fitted up with many
conveniencies; and in order to defray the expence, the
magistrates had imposed a small toll on such as brought
any goods to market. In the year 1679, they had ad∣dressed
the King against the prorogation of Parliament,
and had employed the following terms. “Your peti∣tioners
are greatly surprized at the late prorogation,
whereby the prosecution of the public justice of the
kingdom, and the making necessary provisions for the
preservation of your Majesty and your protestant sub∣jects,
have received interruption.” These words were
pretended to contain a scandalous reflection on the King
and his measures. The cause of the city was defended
against the attorney and sollicitor generals, by Treby and
Pollexfen.</P>
<P>THESE last pleaded, that, since the foundation of the
Monarchy, no corporation had ever yet been forfeited,
and the thing itself implied an absurdity: That a corpo∣ration,
as such, was incapable of all crime or offence,
and none was answerable for any iniquity but the persons
<PB N="175" REF="219"/>
themselves, who committed it: That the members, in
choosing magistrates, had entrusted them only with legal
powers; and where the magistrates had exceeded-these
powers, their acts were void, but could never involve
the body itself in any criminal imputation: That such
had ever been the practice of England, except at the
Reformation, when the monasteries were forfeited; but
this was an extraordinary case; and it was even thought
necessary afterwards to ratify the whole transaction by
act of Parliament: That corporate bodies, framed for
public good, and calculated for perpetual duration,
ought not to be annihilated for the temporary faults of
their members, who might themselves, without hurting
the community, be questioned for their offences: That
even a private estate, if entailed, could not be forfeited
to the Crown, on account of treason, committed by the
tenant for life; but upon his demise went to the next in
remainder: That the offences, objected to the city, far
from deserving so severe a punishment, were not even
worthy of the smallest reprehension: That all corpora∣tions
were invested with the power of making bye-laws;
and the smallest burrough in England had ever been al∣lowed
to carry the exercise of this power farther than
London had done in the instance complained of: That
the city, having, at their own expence, repaired the mar∣kets,
which were built too on their own estates, might
as lawfully claim a small recompence from such as
brought commodities thither, as a man might require rent
for a house, which he was possessed of: That those who
disliked the condition, might abstain from the market;
and whoever paid, had done it voluntarily: That it was
an avowed right of the subjects to petition; nor had the
city in their address abused this privilege: That the King
himself had often declared, the Parliament often voted,
the nation to be in danger from the popish plot; which,
it is evident could not be fully prosecuted but in a par∣liamentary
<PB N="176" REF="220"/>
manner: That the impeachment of the popish
lords was certainly obstructed by the frequent proroga∣tions;
as was also the enacting of necessary laws, and
providing for the defence of the nation: That the loyalty
of the city, no less than their regard to self-preservation,
might prompt them to frame the petition; since it was
acknowledged, that the King's life was every moment
exposed to the most imminent danger from the popish
conspiracy: That the city had not accused the King of
obstructing justice, much less of having any such inten∣tion;
since it was allowed, that evil counsellors were
alone answerable for all the pernicious consequences of
any measure: And that it was unaccountable, that two
public deeds, which had not, during so long a time,
subjected to any, even the smallest penalty, the persons
guilty of them, should now be punished so severely upon
the corporation, which always was, and always must be
innocent.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that those who would apologize for the
measures of the court, must, in this case, found their
arguments, not on law, but reasons of state. The
judges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of June.</NOTE> therefore, who condemned the city, are totally
inexcusable; since the sole justifiable object of their de∣terminations
must ever be the pure principles of justice
and equity. But the place of judge was at that time
held during pleasure; and it was impossible, that any
cause, where the Court bent its force, could ever be car∣ried
against it. After sentence was pronounced, the city
applied in a very humble manner to the King; and he
agreed to restore their charter, but in return they were
obliged to submit to the following regulations: That no
lord mayor, sheriff, recorder, common serjeant, town
clerk, or coroner should be admitted to the exercise of
his office without his Majesty's approbation: That if the
King disapprove twice of the mayor or sheriffs elected,
he may by commission appoint these magistrates: That
<PB N="177" REF="221"/>
the lord mayor and court of aldermen may, with his Ma∣jesty's
leave, displace any magistrate: And that no al∣derman,
in case of a vacancy, shall be elected without
consent of the court of aldermen, who, if they disap∣prove
twice of the choice, may fill the vacancy.</P>
<P>ALL the corporations in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great pow∣er of the Crown.</NOTE> having the example
of London before their eyes, saw how vain it would
prove to struggle with the Court, and were, most of
them, successively induced to surrender their charters into
the King's hands. Considerable sums were exacted for
restoring the charters; and all the offices of power and
profit were left at the disposal of the Crown. Those
who judge of the actions of princes by the rules of po∣licy
alone, could excuse those measures of the King, by
which he much extended his authority, and acquired a
great ascendant in every burrough and corporation.
But it seems strange, that the independant royalists, who
never meant to make the Crown absolute, should yet be
so elated with the victory obtained over their adversaries,
as to approve of a precedent, which left no national pri∣vileges
in security, but enabled the King, under like pre∣tences,
and by means of like instruments, to recall anew
all those charters, which at present he was pleased to
grant. And every friend to liberty must allow, that the
nation, whose constitution was thus shattered in the
shock of faction, had a right, by every prudent expedi∣ent,
to recover that scurity, of which it was so unhap∣pily
bereaved.</P>
<P>WHILE so great a faction adhered to the Crown, it is
apparent, that resistance, however justifiable, could ne∣ver
be prudent; and all wise men saw no other expedient
but peaceably to submit to the present grievances. There
was however a party of malecontents, so turbulent in
their disposition, that even before this last iniquity, which
laid the whole constitution at the mercy of the King,
they had meditated plans of resistance; at a time when
<PB N="178" REF="222"/>
it could be as little justifiable as prudent. In the spring
1681<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Lord Grey's secret history of the Rye-hou se plot. This is the most full and authentic account of all these transactions; but is in the main confirmed by bishop Sprat, and even Burnet, as well as by the trials and dying confessions of the conspirators: So that nothing can be more unaccountable than that any one should pretend, that this conspiracy was an imposture like the popish plot. Monmouth's declaration published in the next reign, consesses a consult for extraordinary remedies.</NOTE>, a little before the Oxford Parliament, the King
was seized with a fit of sickness at Windsor, which gave
great alarm to the public.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A conspi∣racy.</NOTE> The Duke of Monmouth,
lord Russel, lord Grey, instigated by the restless Shaftes∣bury,
had agreed, in case the King's sickness should prove
mortal, to rise in arms and oppose the succession of the
Duke. Charles recovered; but these dangerous projects
were not laid aside. The same conspirators, together
with Essex and Salisbury, were determined to continue
the Oxford Parliament, after the King, as was daily ex∣pected,
should dissolve it; and they engaged some lea∣ders
among the Commons in the same desperate measure.
They went so far as to detain several lords in the House,
under pretence of signing a protestation against rejecting
Fitz-harris's impeachment: But hearing that the Com∣mons
had broke up in great consternation, they were
likewise obliged at last to separate. Shaftesbury's im∣prisonment
and trial put an end for some time to these
machinations; and it was not till the new sheriffs were im∣posed
on the city that they were revived. The leaders of the
country party began then to apprehend themselves in im∣minent
danger; and they were well pleased to find, that the citizens were struck with the same terror, and were
thence inclined to undertake the most perilous enterprises.
Besides the city, applications were made to the gentry
and nobility in several counties of England to rise in
arms. Monmouth engaged the earl of Maccles∣field,
lord Brandon, Sir Gilbert Gerrard, and other
gentleman in Cheshire: Lord Russel fixed a correspon∣dence
<PB N="179" REF="223"/>
with Sir William Courtney, Sir Francis Rowles,
Sir Francis Drake, who promised to raise the West;
and Trenchard in particular, who had great interest in
the disaffected town of Taunton, assured him of consi∣derable
assistance from that neighbourhood. Shaftesbury
and his emissary, Ferguson, an independant clergyman
and a restless plotter, managed the correspondence in the
city, upon which the confederates chiefly relied. The
whole train was ready to take fire; but was prevented by
the caution of lord Russel, who induced Monmouth to
delay the enterprise. Shaftesbury in the mean time was so
affected with the sense of his danger, that he had left his
house, and secretly lurked in the city; meditating all those
desperate schemes, which disappointed revenge and am∣bition
could dictate. He exclaimed loudly against de∣lay,
and represented to his confederates, that having
gone so far, and entrusted the secret into so many hands,
there was no safety for them but in a bold and desperate
prosecution of their purpose. The projects were there∣fore
renewed: Meetings of the conspirators were ap∣pointed
in different houses, particulary in Shephard's an
eminent wine-merchant in the city: A plan of the in∣surrection
was laid in London, Cheshire, Devonshire,
and Bristol: The several places of rendezvous in the
city were concerted: and the whole operations fixed:
The state of the guards was even viewed by Monmouth
and Armstrong, and an attack on them pronounced very
practicable: A declaration to justify the enterprise to the
public was read and agreed to: And every circumstance
seemed now to render an insurrection unavoidable; when
a new delay was procured by Trenchard, who declared,
that the rising in the West could not for some weeks be
in sufficient forwardness.</P>
<P>SHAFTESBURY was enraged at these perpetual cautions
and delays in an enterprize, which, he thought, nothing
but courage and celerity could render effectual: He threat∣ened
<PB N="180" REF="224"/>
to commence the insurrection with his friends in
the city alone; and he boasted, that he had ten thousand
<HI>brisk boys,</HI> as he called them, who, on a motion of his
finger, were ready to fly to arms. Monmouth, Russel,
and the other conspirators, were, during some time, in
apprehensions, lest despair should push him into some
dangerous measure; when they heard, that, after a long
struggle between fear and rage, he had at last abandoned
all hopes of success, and had retired into Holland. He
lived in a private manner at Amsterdam; and for greater
security desired to be admitted into the magistracy of that
city: But his former violent councils against the Dutch
commonwealth were remembered, and all applications
from him were rejected.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shaftesbury retires and dies.</NOTE> He died soon after; and his
end gave neither sorrow to his friends, nor joy to his ene∣mies.
His surious temper, notwithstanding his capacity,
had done great injury to the cause, in which he was en∣gaged.
The violences and iniquities, which he sug∣gested
and encouraged, were greater than even faction
itself could endure; and men could not forbear some∣times
remembering, that the same person, who was be∣come
so zealous a patriot, was once a most prostitute
courtier. It is remarkable, that this man, whose prin∣ciples
and conduct were, in all other respects, so excep∣tionable,
proved an excellent chancellor; and that all his
decrees, while he possessed that eminent office, were
equally remarkable for justness and for integrity. So dif∣ficult
it is to find in history a character either wholly bad
or perfectly good; tho' the prejudices of party make
writers run frequently into the extremes both of pane∣gyric
and of satire!</P>
<P>AFTER Shaftesbury's departure, the conspirators found
some difficulty in renewing the correspondence with the
city malecontents, who had been accustomed to depend
solely on that nobleman. Their common views, how∣ever,
as well as common apprehension, made them at
<PB N="181" REF="225"/>
last have recourse to each other; and a regular project
of an insurrection was again formed. A council of six
was erected, consisting of Monmouth, Russel, Essex,
Howard, Algernon Sidney, and John Hambden, grand∣son
to the great parliamentary leader. These men en∣tered
into an agreement with Argyle and the Scots male-contents,
who engaged, that, upon the payment of
10,000 pounds for the purchase of arms in Holland, they
would bring the Covenanters into the field. Insurrections
likewise were anew projected in Cheshire and the West,
as well as in the city; and some meetings of the leaders
were held, in order to reduce these projects into form.
The conspirators differed extremely in their views. Sid∣ney
was passionate for a commonwealth. Essex had em∣braced
the same project. But Monmouth had entertained
hopes of acquiring the Crown for himself. Russel, as
well as Hambden, was much attached to the antient con∣stitution,
and proposed only the exclusion of the Duke
and the redress of grievances, Lord Howard was a
man of abandoned principles, and was ready to embrace
any party, which his immediate interest should recom∣mend
to him. But notwithstanding this difference of
characters and of views, their common hatred of the
Duke and the present administration united them into
one party; and the dangerous experiment of an insur∣rection
was fully resolved on.</P>
<P>WHILE these schemes were concerting among the lea∣ders,
there was an inferior order of conspirators,
who frequently met together, and with the insurrec∣tion,
carried on projects quite unknown to Monmouth,
and the cabal of six.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rye-house plot.</NOTE> Among these men were colonel
Rumsey, an old republican officer, who had distin∣guished
himself in Portugal, and had been recommended
to the King by Mareschal Schomberg; lieutenant co∣lonel
Walcot, likewise a republican officer; Good∣enough,
under sheriff of London, a zealous and noted

party-man; West, Tyley, Norton, Ayloffe, lawyers;
Ferguson, Rouse, Hone, Keiling, Holloway, Bourne,
Lee, Rumbald. Most of these last were merchants or
tradesmen; and the only persons of this confederacy,
who had access to the leaders of the party, were Rum∣sey
and Ferguson. When these men were met toge∣ther
in their cabals, they indulged themselves in the
most desperate and most criminal discourse: They frequently
mentioned the assassination of the King and the Duke,
to which they had given the familiar appellation of <HI>lop∣ping:</HI>
They even went so far as to have thought of a
scheme for that purpose. Rumbald, who was a mal∣ster,
possessed a farm, called the Rye-house, which lay
on the way to Newmarket, whither the King com∣monly
went once a year, for the diversion of the races.
A plan of this farm had been laid before some of the
conspirators by Rumbald, who showed them how easy
it would be, by over-turning a cart, to stop at that place
the King's coach; while they might fire upon him from
the hedges, and be easily enabled afterwards, thro' bye
lanes and cross the fields, to make their escape. But
tho' the plausibility of this scheme gave great pleasure to
the conspirators, no concerted design was as yet laid,
nor any men, horses, or arms provided: The whole was
little more than loose discourse, the over-flowings of
their zeal and rancour. The house in which the King
lived at Newmarket, took fire accidentally; and he was
obliged to leave that place eight days sooner than he in∣tended.
To this circumstance his safety was afterwards
ascribed, when the conspiracy was discovered; and the
court party could not sufficiently admire the wise dispen∣sations
of Providence. It is indeed certain, that as the
King had thus unexpectedly left Newmarket, he was
much worse attended than usual; and Rumbald informed
his confederates with regret what a fine opportunity was
thus unfortunately lost.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="229"/>
AMONG the conspirators I have mentioned Keiling, a
salter in London. This man had been engaged in a
very bold measure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspiracy discovered.</NOTE> of arresting the mayor of London,
at the suit of Papillon and Dubois, the outed sheriffs;
and being liable to prosecution for that action, he thought
it fafest to purchase a pardon, by revealing the conspiracy,
in which he was deeply concerned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of June.</NOTE> He brought to se∣cretary
Jenkins intelligence of the assassination plot;
but as he was a single evidence, the secretary, whom
many false plots had probably rendered incredulous, scru∣pled
to issue warrants for the commitment of so great a
number of persons. Keiling therefore, in order to for∣tify
his testimony, engaged his brother in treasonable
discourse with Good-enough, one of the conspirators;
and Jenkins began now to give more attention to the in∣telligence.
The conspirators had got some hint of the
danger, in which they were involved; and all of them
concealed themselves. One person alone, of the name
of Barber, an instrument-maker, was seized; and as his
confession concurred in many particulars with Keiling's
information, the affair seemed to be put out of all ques∣tion;
and a more diligent search was every where made
after the conspirators.</P>
<P>WEST, the lawyer, and colonel Rumsey, finding the
perils to which they were exposed in endeavouring to es∣cape,
resolved to save their own lives at the expence of
their companions; and accordingly surrendered them∣selves
with an intention of becoming evidence. West
could do little more than confirm, the testimony of
Keiling with regard to the assassination plot; but Rum∣sey,
besides additional confirmation of the same design,
was at last, tho' with much difficulty, led to give an ac∣count
of the meetings at Shephard's. Shephard was im∣mediately
apprehended; and had not courage to maintain
fidelity to his confederates. Upon his information, or∣ders
were issued for arresting the great men engaged in
<PB N="184" REF="230"/>
the conspiracy. Monmouth absconded: Russel was sent
to the Tower; Gray was arrested but escaped from the
messenger: Howard was taken, while he concealed him∣self
in a chimney; and being a man of most profligate
morals, as well as indigent circumstances, he scrupled
not, in hopes of a pardon, to reveal the whole conspi∣racy.
Essex, Sidney, Hambden were immediately ap∣prehended
upon his evidence. Every day some of the
con∣spirators were detected in their lurking-places, and
thrown into prison.</P>
<P>LIEUTENANT COLONEL WALCOT was first brought
to his trial.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the conspirators.</NOTE> This man, who was once noted for bra∣very,
had been so far overcome by the love of life, that
he had wrote to secretary Jenkins, and had offered upon
promise of pardon to turn evidence: But no sooner had
he taken this mean step, than he felt more gene∣rous
sentiments arise in him; and he endeavoured, tho'
in vain, to conceal himself. The witnesses against him
were Rumsey, West, Shephard, together with one
Bourne, a brewer. His own letter to the secretary was
produced, and rendered the testimony of the witnesses
unquestionable. Hone and Rouse were also condemned
to die. These two men, as well as Walcot, at their
execution, acknowleged the justice of the sentence;
and from their trial and confession it is sufficiently appa∣rent,
that the plan of an insurrection had been regularly
formed; and that even the assassination had been often
talked of, and not without the approbation of many of
the conspirators.</P>
<P>THE condemnation of these criminals was probably
intended as a preparative to the trial of lord Russel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of lord Russel.</NOTE> and
served to impress the public with a thorow belief of the
conspiracy, as well as a horror against it. The witnesses
produced against the noble prisoner were Rumsey, Shep∣ard,
and lord Howard. Rumsey swore, that he himself
had been introduced to the cabal at Shephard's, where
<PB N="185" REF="231"/>
Russel was present; and had delivered them a message
from Shaftesbury, urging them to hasten the intended
insurrection: But had received for answer, that it was
found nccessary to delay the design, and that Shaftesbury
must therefore, for some time, rest contented. This an∣swer,
he said, was delivered by Ferguson, but was assented
to by the prisoner. He added, that some discourse had
been entered into about taking a survey of the guards;
and he thought, that Monmouth, Gray and Armstrong
undertook to view them. Shephard swore, that his house
had been beforehand bespoke by Ferguson for the se∣cret
meeting of the conspirators, and that he had been
careful to keep all his servants from approaching them,
and had served them himself. Their discourse, he said,
ran chiefly upon the means of surprizing the guards
and it was agreed that Monmouth and his two friends
should take a survey of them. The report, which they
brought next meeting, was, that the guards were remiss,
and that the design was very practicable: But he did not
affirm, that any resolution was taken of executing it.
The prisoner, he thought, was present at both these
meetings; but he was sure, that at least he was present
at one of them. A declaration, he added, had been
read by Ferguson in Russel's presence: The reasons of
the intended insurrection were there set forth, and all
the public grievances fully displayed.</P>
<P>LORD HOWARD had been one of the cabal of six after
Shaftesbury's flight; and two meetings had been held of
the conspirators, one at Hambden's, another at Russel's.
Howard swore, that, at the first meeting, it was agreed
to begin the insurrection in the country before the city;
the places were fixed, the proper quantity and kind of
arms agreed on, and the whole plan of operations con∣certed:
That at the second meeting, the conversation
turned chiefly upon their correspondence with Argyle and
the discontented Scots, and that the principal management
<PB N="186" REF="232"/>
of that affair was intrusted to Sidney, who had sent one
Aaron Smith into Scotland with proper instructions. He
added, that in these consults no question was put nor
votes collected: but there was no contradiction, and,
as he took it, all of them, and the prisoner among the
rest, gave their consent.</P>
<P>RUMSEY and Shephard were very unwilling witnesses
against lord Russel; and it appears from Gray's Secret
History<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Page 43.</NOTE>, that, if they had pleased, they could have
given a more explicite testimony against him. This re∣luctance,
together with the difficulty of recollecting
circumstances in a conversation, which had passed above
eight months before, and which the persons had not at
that time any intention to discover, may beget some
slight objection to their evidence. But on the whole, it
was undoubtedly proved, that the insurrection had been
deliberated on by the prisoner, and fully resolved; the
surprisal of the guards deliberated on, but not fully re∣solved;
and that an assassination had never once been
mentioned or imagined by him. So far the matter of
fact seems certain: But still, with regard to law, there
remained a difficulty, and that of a very important
nature.</P>
<P>THE English laws of treason, both in the manner of
defining that crime and in the proof required, are the
mildest and most indulgent, and consequently the
most equitable, that are any where to be found.
The two chief species of treason, contained in the
law of Edward the third, are the compassing and
intending the King's death, and the actual levying
war against him; and by the law of Mary the
crime must be proved by the concurring testimony of
two witnesses, to some overt act, tending to these pur∣poses.
But the lawyers, partly desirous of paying court
to the Sovereign, partly convinced of ill consequences,
<PB N="187" REF="233"/>
which might attend such narrow limitations, had intro∣duced
a greater latitude, both in the proof and definition
of the crime. It was not required, that the two wit∣nesses
should testify the same precise overt act: It was
sufficient, that they both testified some overt act of the
same treason; and tho' this evasion may seem a subtilty,
it had long prevailed in the courts of judicature, and had
at last been solemnly fixed by parliament at the trial of
lord Stafford. The lawyers had used the same freedom,
tho' perhaps after a more exceptionable manner, with the
law of Edward the third. They had observed, that, by that
famous statute, if a man should enter into a conspiracy
for a rebellion, should even fix a correspondence with fo∣reign
powers for that purpose, should provide arms and
money, yet, if he was detected and no rebellion ensued,
he could not be tried for treason. To prevent this in∣convenience,
which it had been better to remedy by a
new law, they had commonly laid their indictment for
intending the death of the King, and had produced the
intention of a rebellion as a proof of that other inten∣tion.
But tho' this form of indictment and trial
was very frequent, and many criminals had received
sentence upon it, it was considered as irregular, and was
plainly confounding, by a sophism, two species of trea∣son,
which the statute had most accurately distinguished.
What made this refinement still more inexcusable; a
law had passed soon after the restoration, where the con∣sulting
or intending a rebellion, was, during Charles's
life-time, declared treason; and it was required that the
prosecution should be made within six months after the
crime was committed. But notwithstanding this sta∣tute,
the lawyers had persevered, as they still do perse∣vere,
in the old form of indictment; and both Sir Harry
Vane and Oliver Plunket, titular primate of Ireland, had
been tried by it. Such was the general horror, entertained
against the old republicans, and the popish conspirators,
<PB N="188" REF="234"/>
that no-one had murmured against this interpretation of
the statute; and the lawyers thought, that they might
follow the precedent even in the case of the popular and
beloved lord Russel. Russel's crime fell plainly under
the statute of Charles the 2d; but the facts sworne to by
Rumsey and Shepard were without the six months re∣quired
by law and to thc other facts Howard was a
single witness. To make the indictment, therefore,
more extensive, the intention of murdering the King
was comprehended in it; and for proof of this intention
the conspiracy for raising a rebellion was assigned; and
what seemed to bring the matter still nearer, the design
of attacking the King's guards.</P>
<P>RUSSEL perceived this irregularity, and desired to have
the point-argued by council: The chief justice told him,
that that privilege could not be granted, unless he previ∣ously
confessed the facts charged upon him. The arti∣ficial
confounding the two species of treason, tho' a prac∣tice
supported by many precedents, is the chief, but not
the only hardship, of which Russel had reason to complain
on his trial. His defence was very feeble; and he con∣tented
himself with protesting, that he never had enter∣tained
any design against the King's life: His candour
would not allow him to deny the conspiracy for an in∣surrection.
The jury were men of fair and irreproach∣able
characters, but zealous Royalists: After a short de∣liberation,
they brought in the prisoner guilty.</P>
<P>APPLICATIONS were made to the King for a pardon:
Even money, to the amount of an hundred thousand
pounds, was offered to the dutchess of Portsmouth by
the old earl of Bedford, father to Russel. The King
was inexorable. He had been extremely harrassed with
the violence of the country party, and he had observed,
that the prisoner, besides his secret designs, had always
been carried to the highest extremity of opposition in
Parliament. He had even adopted a sentiment, similar to
<PB N="189" REF="235"/>
what we meet with in a letter of the younger Brutus.
Had his father, he said, advised the King to reject the
exclusion-bill, he would he the first to move for a parlia∣mentary
impeachment against him. When such determined
resolution was observed, his popularity, his humanity,
his justice, his very virtues became so many crimes,
and were used as arguments against sparing him. Charles
therefore would go no farther than remit the more ig∣nominious
part of the sentence, which the law requires
to be pronounced against traitors. “My lord Russel,”
said he, “shall find, that I am possessed of that prero∣gative,
which, in the case of lord Stafford, he thought
fit to deny me.” As the fury of the country party
had rendered it impossible for the King, without the most
imminent danger of his throne, to pardon so many Ca∣tholics,
whom he firmly believed to be innocent, and
even affectionate and loyal to him; he probably thought,
that, since the edge of the law was now ready to fall up∣on
that party themselves, they could not reasonably ex∣pect,
that he would interpose to save them.</P>
<P>RUSSEL'S consort, a woman of great merit, daughter
and heiress of the good earl of Southampton, threw
herself at the King's feet, and pleaded with many tears
the merits and loyalty of her father, as an atonement
for those errors, into which honest, however mistaken
principles had seduced her husband. These supplications
were the last instance of female weakness (if they deserve
the name) which she betrayed Finding all applications
vain, she collected courage, and not only fortified herself
against the fatal blow, but endeavoured by her ex∣ample
to strengthen the resolution of her unfortunate
lord. With a tender and decent composure they took
have of each other on the day of his execution. “The
bitterness of death is now passed,” said he, when he
turned from her. Lord Cavendish had lived in the closest
intimacy with Russel, and deserted not his friend
<PB N="190" REF="236"/>
in the present calamity. He gallantly offered to manage
his escape, by changing cloaths with him, and remain∣ing
at all hazards in his place. Russel refused to save his
own life, by an expedient which might expose his friend
to so many hardships. When the duke of Monmouth
by message offered to surrender himself, if Russel thought
that that measure would any way contribute to his safety;
“It will be no advantage to me,” he said, “to have my
friends die with me.” Some of his expressions dis∣cover,
not only composure, but good humour in this
melancholy extremity. The day before his execution he
was seized with a bleeding at the nose. “I shall not
now let blood to divert this distemper,” said he to
doctor Burnet who attended him, “that will be done to
morrow.” A little before the sheriffs conducted him to
the scaffold, he wound up his watch, “Now I have
done,” said he, “with time, and henceforth must
think solely of eternity.”</P>
<P>THE scaffold was erected in Lincoln's Inn Fields,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st of July.</NOTE> a
place very distant from the Tower; and it was probably
intended, by conducting Russel thro' so many streets,
to show the mutinous city their beloved leader, once the
object of all their confidence, now exposed to the utmost
rigours of the law. As he was the most popular among
his own party; so was he ever the least obnoxious to the
opposite faction:<NOTE PLACE="marg">and execu∣tion.</NOTE> And his melancholy fate united every
heart, sensible of humanity, in a tender compassion for
him. Without the least change of countenance, he laid
his head on the block; and at two strokes, it was se∣vered
from his body.</P>
<P>IN the speech, which he delivered to the sheriffs, he
was very anxious to clear his memory from any imputa∣tion
of ever intending the King's death, or any altera∣tion
in the government: He could not explicitely con∣fess
the projected insurrection without hurting his friends,
who might still be called in question for it; but he did
<PB N="191" REF="237"/>
not purge himself of that design, which, in the present
condition of the nation, he regarded as no crime. By
many passages in his speech, he seems to the last to have
lain under the influence of party zeal; a passion, which
being nourished by a social temper, and cloathing itself
under the appearance of principle, it is almost impossible
for a virtuous man, who has acted in public life, ever
thoroughly to eradicate. He professed his entire belief in
the popish plot: And he said, that, tho' he had often
heard the seizure of the guards mentioned, he had ever
disapproved of that attempt. To which he added,
that the massacring so many innocent men in cold blood
was so like a popish practice, that he could not but ab∣hor
it. Upon the whole, the integrity and virtuous inten∣tions,
rather than the capacity, of this unfortunate noble∣man,
seem to have been the shining parts of his character.</P>
<P>ALGERNON SIDNEY was next brought to his trial.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Algernon Sidney.</NOTE>
This gallant person, son to the earl of Leicester, had
entered deeply into the war against the late King; and tho'
no way tainted with enthusiasm, he had so far shared in
all the councils of the independant republican party, as
to have been named on the high court of justice, which
tried and condemned that Monarch: He thought not
proper, however, to take his seat among the judges. He
ever opposed Cromwel's usurpation with zeal and cou∣rage;
and after employing all his efforts against the re∣storation,
he resolved to take no benefit of the general
indemnity, but chose voluntary bunishment, rather than
submit to a government and family, which he abhorred.
As long as the republican party had any existence, he
was active in every scheme, however unpromising, which
tended to promote their cause: But at last, in 1677,
finding it necessary for his private affairs to return into
England, he had applied for the King's pardon, and had
obtained it. When the factions, arising from the po∣pish
plot, began to run high, Sidney, full of those ideas
<PB N="190" REF="238"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="191" REF="239"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="192" REF="240"/>
of liberty, which he had imbibed from the great examples
antiquity, joined the popular party; and was
even willing to seek a second time, thro' all the horrors of civil war, for his adored republic.</P>
<P>FROM this imperfect sketch of the character and con∣duct
of this illustrious personage, it may easily be con∣ceived
how obnoxious he was become to the court and
ministry: What alone renders them inexcusable was the
illegal method, which they took, of effecting their pur∣pose
against him. On Sidney's trial they produced a
great number of witnesses, who proved the reality of a plot
in general; and when the prisoner exclaimed, that
all these evidences said nothing of him, he was answer∣ed,
that this method of proceeding, however irregular,
had been practised in the prosecutions of the popish con∣spirators:
A topic more fit to condemn one party than to
justify the other. The only witness, who deposed
against Sidney was lord Howard; but as the law require∣ed
two witnesses, a strange expedient was fallen on to
supply this deficiency. In ransacking the prisoner's closet;
some discourses on government were found; where he
had maintained principles, favourable indeed to liberty,
but such as the best and most dutiful subjects in all ages
have been known to embrace; the original contract,
the source of power from a consent of the people, the
lawfulness of resisting tyrants, the preference of liberty
to the government of a single person. These papers
were asserted to be equivalent to a second witness, and
even to many witnesses. The prisoner replied, that
there was no other reason for ascribing these papers to
him besides a similitude of hand; a proof, which was
never admitted in criminal prosecutions: That allowing
him to be the author, he had composed them solely for
his private amusement, and had never published them to
the world, or even communicated them to any single
person: That, when examined, they appeared by the
<PB N="193" REF="241"/>
colour of the ink to have been wrote many years before,
and were in vain produced as evidences of a present con∣spiracy
against the government: And that where the law
positively requires two witnesses, one witness, attended
with the most convincing circumstances, could never
suffice; much less, when supported by a circumstance
so weak and precarious. All these arguments, tho' urged
by the prisoner with great courage and pregnancy of
reason, had no influence. The violent and inhuman
Jefferies was now chief justice; and by his direction a
partial jury was easily prevailed on to give a verdict
against Sidney. His execution followed a few days after∣wards:
He complained, and with reason, of the iniquity
of the sentence; but he had too much greatness of mind
to deny those consults with Monmouth and Russel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of De∣cember. His execution.</NOTE> in
which he had been engaged. He rather gloried, that he
now suffered for that <HI>good old cause,</HI> in which, from his
earliest youth, he said, he had inlisted himself.</P>
<P>THE execution of Sidney is regarded as one of the
greatest blemishes of the present reign. The evidence
against him, it must be confessed was not legal; and
the jury, who condemned him, were, for that rea∣son,
very blameable. But that after sentence passed by
a court of judicature, the King should interpose and par∣don
a man, who, tho' otherwise possessed of great me∣rit,
was undoubtedly guilty, who had ever been a most
inflexible and most inveterate enemy to the royal family,
and who lately had even abused the King's clemency,
might be an act of heroic generosity, but can never be
regarded as a necessary and indispensible duty.</P>
<P>HOWARD was also the sole evidence against Hamb∣den;
and his testimony was not supported by any very
material circumstance. The crown-lawyers therefore
found it in vain to try the prisoner for treason:
They laid the indictment only for misdemeanours, and
obtained sentence against him. The fine imposed was
exorbitant; no less than forty thousand pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="242"/>
HOLLOWAY, a merchant of Bristol, one of the con∣spirators,
had fled to the West Indies, and was now
brought over. He had been out-lawed; but the year,
allowed him for presenting himself, was not expired. A
trial was therefore offered him: But as he had at first
confessed his being engaged in a conspiracy for an insur∣rection,
and even allowed that he had heard some dis∣courses
of an assassination, tho' he had not approved of
them, he thought it more expedient to throw himself on
the King's mercy. He was executed, persisting in the
same confession.</P>
<P>SIR THOMAS ARMSTRONG, who had been seized in
Holland by Chidley, the King's minister, and sent over,
was precisely in the same situation with Holloway: But
the same favour, or rather justice, was refused him.
The lawyers pretended, that, unless he voluntarily came
in before the expiration of the time assigned, he could
not claim the privilege of a trial; not considering, that
the seizure of his person ought in equity to be supposed
the accident which prevented him. The King bore a
great enmity against this gentleman, by whom he be∣lieved
the duke of Monmouth to have been seduced
from his duty: He also asserted, that Armstrong had once
promised Cromwel to assassinate him; tho' it must be
confessed, that the prisoner justified himself from this
imputation by very strong arguments. These were the
reasons of that injustice, which was now done him. It
was apprehended, that sufficient evidence of his guilt
could not be produced; and that even the partial juries,
which were now returned, and which allowed themselves
to be entirely directed by Jefferies and other violent
judges, would not give sentence against him.</P>
<P>ON the day that Russel was tried, Essex, a man emi∣nent
both for virtues and abilities, was found in the
Tower with his throat cut. The coroner's inquest
brought in their verdict, <HI>self-murther:</HI> Vet because two
children of ten years of age (one of whom too departed
<PB N="195" REF="243"/>
from his evidence) had affirmed, that they heard a great
noise from his window, and that they saw a hand throw
out a bloody razor, these circumstances were laid hold
of, and the murder was ascribed to the King and the
Duke, who happened that morning to pay a visit to the
Tower. Essex was subject to fits of deep melancholy,
and had been seized with one immediately upon his com∣mitment:
He was accustomed to maintain the lawful∣ness
of suicide: And his countess, upon a strict enquiry,
which was committed to the care of Dr. Burnet, found
no reason to confirm the suspicion: Yet could not all
these circumstances, joined to many others, entirely re∣move
the imputation. It is no wonder, that faction is
so productive of vices of all kinds: For, besides that it
inflames all the passions, it tends much to remove those
great restraints, honour and shame; when men find,
that no iniquity can lose them the applause of their own
party, and no innocence secure them against the calum∣nies
of the opposite.</P>
<P>BUT tho' there is no reason to think, that Essex had
been murdered by any orders from court, it must be ac∣knowleged,
that a very unjustifiable use in Russel's trial
was made of that incident. The King's council men∣tioned
it in their pleadings as a strong proof of the con∣spiracy;
and it is said to have had great weight with the
jury. It was insisted on in Sidney's trial for the same
purpose.</P>
<P>SOME memorable causes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the nation.</NOTE> tried about this time, tho'
they have no relation to the Rye-house conspiracy, show
the temper of the bench and the juries. Oates was con∣victed
of having called the Duke a popish traitor; was
fined to the amount of one hundred thousand pounds; and
was condemned to prison till he should make payment.
A like illegal sentence was passed upon Dutton-Colt for
a like offence. Sir Samuel Barnardiston was fined ten
thousand pounds; because, in some private letters, which
<PB N="196" REF="244"/>
had been intercepted, he had reflected on the govern∣ment.
This gentleman was obnoxious, because he had
been foreman of that jury, which rejected the bill against
Shaftesbury. A pretence was therefore fallen upon for
punishing him; tho' such a precedent may justly be
esteemed a very unusual act of severity, and sufficient to
destroy all confidence in private friendship and corre∣spondence.</P>
<P>THERE is another remarkable trial, which shows the
disposition of the courts of judicature, and which, tho'
it passed in the ensuing year, it may not be improper to
relate here. One Rosewel, a presbyterian preacher, was
accused by three women of having spoke treasonable
words in a sermon. They swore to two or three peri∣ods,
and agreed so exactly together, that there was not
the smallest variation in their depositions. Rosewel on
the other hand made a very good defence. He proved,
that the witnesses were lewd and infamous persons. He
proved, that, even during Cromwel's usurpation, he
had always been loyal; that he prayed constantly for the
King in his family; and that in his sermons he
often inculcated the obligations of loyalty. And as to
the sermon, of which he was accused, several witnesses,
who heard it, and some who wrote it in short hand, de∣posed that he had used no such expressions as those ob∣jected
to him. He offered his own notes as a farther
proof. The women could not shew by any circum∣stance
or witnesses, that they were at his meeting. And
the expressions, which they swore against him, were so
gross▪ that no man in his senses could be supposed to
employ them before a mixt audience. It was also urged,
that it was next to impossible for three women to re∣member
so long a period upon one single hearing, and
to remember it so exactly, as to agree to a tittle in their
depositions with regard to it. The prisoner offered to
put the whole upon this issue: He would pronounce,
<PB N="197" REF="245"/>
with his usual tone of voice, a period as long as that
which they had sworn to; and then let them try to re∣peat
it, if they could. What was more unaccountable,
they had forgot even the text of his sermon; nor did
they remember any single passage, but the words, which
they deposed to. After so strong a defence, the sollici∣tor
general thought not proper to make any reply: Even
Jefferies went no farther than some general declamations
against conventicles and Presbyterians: Yet so violent
were party-prejudices, that the jury gave a verdict against
the prisoner; which however appeared so palpably un∣just,
that it never was executed.</P>
<P>THE duke of Monmouth had absconded on the first
discovery of the conspiracy; and the Court could get no
intelligence of him. At last, Hallifax, who began to
apprehend the too great prevalence of the royal party, and
who thought, that Monmouth's interest would prove the
best counterballance to the Duke's, discovered his retreat,
and prevailed with him to write two letters to the King,
full of the tenderest and most submissive expressions.
The King's fondness was revived; and he permitted
Monmouth to come to court. He even endeavoured to
mediate a reconciliation between his son and his brother;
and having promised Monmouth, that his testimony
should never be employed against any of his spends, he
engaged him to give a full account of the plot. But, in
order to put the country party to silence, he called next
day an extraordinary council; and informed them, that
Monmouth had showed great penitence for the share,
which he had had in the late conspiracy, and had ex∣pressed
his resolutions never more to engage in such cri∣minal
enterprizes. He went so far as to give orders, that
a paragraph to the like purpose should be inserted in the
Gazette. Monmouth kept silence 'till he had obtained
his pardon in form: But finding, that, by taking this
step, he was entirely disgraced with his party, and that,
<PB N="198" REF="246"/>
even tho' he should not be produced in court as an evi∣dence,
his testimony, being so publickly known, might
have weight with juries on any future trial, he resolved
at all hazards to retrieve his honour. His emissaries,
therefore, received orders to deny, that he had ever made
any such confession as that ascribed to him; and the party
cried aloud, that the whole was a fiction of the Court.
The King, provoked at this conduct, banished Mon∣mouth
his presence, and afterwards ordered him to de∣part
the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE court were well aware, that the malecontents in
England had held a correspondence with those in Scot∣land;
and that Baillic of Jerviswood, a man of merit
and learning, with two gentlemen of the name of Camp∣bel,
had come to London, under pretence of negociating
the settlement of the Scots Presbyterians in Carolina,
but really with a view to concert measures with the Eng∣lish
conspirators. Baillie was sent prisoner to Edin∣burgh;
and as no evidence appeared against him, the
council required him to swear, that he would answer all
questions, which should be propounded to him. Baillie
refused to submit to so iniquitious a condition; and a
fine of six thousand pounds was imposed upon him. At
last, two persons, Spence and Carstares, being put to
the torture, gave evidence which involved the earl of
Tarras and some others, who, in order to save them∣selves
from attainder, were reduced to accuse Baillie.
He was brought to trial; and being in so languishing a
condition from the cruel treatment, which he had met
with in prison, that it was feared he would not survive
that night, he was ordered to be executed the very af∣ternoon,
on which he received sentence.</P>
<P>THE severities, exercised during this part of the pre∣sent
reign, were much contrary to the usual tenor of the
King's conduct; and tho' those who studied his cha∣racter
more narrowly, have pronounced, that towards
<PB N="199" REF="247"/>
great offences he was rigid and inexorable, the nation
were more inclined to ascribe every unjust or hard mea∣sure
to the prevalence of the Duke's councils, into whose
hands the King had, from indolence, not from any opi∣nion
of his brother's superior capacity, resigned the reins
of government. The Crown indeed gained great advan∣tages
from the detection of the conspiracy, and lost none
by the rigorous execution of the conspirators: The hor∣ror
entertained against the assassination-plot, which was
commonly confounded with the design of an insurrec∣tion,
rendered the whole party unpopular, and recon∣ciled
the nation to the measures of the court. The
most loyal addresses came from all parts of the kingdom;
and the doctrine of submission to the civil magistrates,
and even of an unlimited passive obedience, became the
reigning principle of the times. The university of Ox∣ford
passed a solemn decree, condemning some doctrines,
which they denominated republican, but which indeed
are, most of them, the only tenets, on which liberty
and a limited constitution can be founded. The faction
of the exclusionists, lately so numerous, powerful, and
zealous, were at the King's feet; and were as much
fallen in their spirit as in their credit with the nation.
Nothing, which had the least appearance of opposition
to the Court, could be hearkened to by the public.</P>
<P>THE King endeavoured to encrease his present popu∣larity
by every art;<NOTE PLACE="marg">163<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and knowing, that the suspicion of
popery was of all others the most dangerous, he judged
it proper to marry his niece, the Lady Anne, to Prince
George, brother to the King of Denmark. All the
credit, however, and persuasion of Hallifax, could not
engage him to call a Parliament, or trust the nation with
the election of a new representative. Tho' his revenues
were extremely burthened, he chose rather to struggle
with the present difficulties, than try an experiment,
<PB N="200" REF="248"/>
which, by raising afresh so many discontented humours,
might prove dangerous to his repose. The Duke like∣wise
zealously obstructed this proposal, and even en∣gaged
the King in measures, which could have no other
tendency, than to render any accommodation with a Par∣liament
altogether impracticable. Williams, who had
been speaker during the two last Parliaments, was pro∣secuted
for warrants, issued by him, in obedience to or∣ders
of the House: A breach of privilege, which it
seemed not likely, any future House of Commons would
leave unpunished. Danby and the popish lords, who
had so long been, confined to the Tower, and who saw
no prospect of a trial in Parliament, were admitted to
bail: A measure very just in itself, but deemed a great en∣croachment
on the privileges of that assembly. The
Duke contrary to law, was restored to the office of
high admiral, without taking the test.</P>
<P>HAD the least grain of jealousy or emulation been
mixed in the King's character; had he been actuated by
that concern, for his people's or even for his own ho∣nour,
which his high station demanded, he would have
hazarded many domestic inconveniencies rather than
allow: France to domineer in so haughty a manner as
that which at present she assumed in every negotiation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of foreign affairs.</NOTE> The peace of Nimeguen, imposed by the Dutch on their
unwilling allies, had disjointed the whole confederacy;
and all the powers, engaged in it, had disbanded their
supernumerary troops, which they found such difficulty
to subsist. Lewis alone still maintained a very powerful
army, and by his preparations rendered himself every day
more formidable. He now acted as if he were the sole
Sovereign in Europe, and as if all other Princes were
soon to become his vassals. Courts or chambers were
erected in Metz and Brisac, for re-uniting such territo∣ries
as had ever been members of any part of his new
conquests. They made inquiry into titles buried in the
<PB N="201" REF="249"/>
most remote antiquity. They cited the neighbouring
Princes to appear before them, and issued decrees, ex∣pelling
them from the contested territories. The im∣portant
town of Strasbourg, an antient and a free state,
was seized by Lewis: Alost was demanded of the Spa∣niards,
on a most frivolous, and even ridiculous pre∣tence;
and upon their refusal to yield it, Luxembourg
was blockaded, and soon after taken. Genoa had been
bombarded, because the Genoese had stipulated to build
some gallies for the Spaniards; and in order to avoid a
more severe fate, that republic was obliged to yield to
the most mortifying conditions. The empire was in∣sulted
in its head and principal members; and used no
other expedient for redress, but impotent complaints and
remonstrances.</P>
<P>SPAIN was so enraged at the insolent treatment which
she met with, that, without-considering her present weak
condition, she declared war against her haughty enemy:
She hoped, that the other powers of Europe, sensible of
the common danger, would fly to her assistance. The
prince of Orange, whose ruling passions were the love of
war and animosity against France, seconded every where
the applications of the Spaniards. In the year 1681, he
even made a journey to England, in order to engage the
King into closer measures with the confederates. He
also proposed to the States to make an augmentation of
their forces; but several of the provinces, and even the
town of Amsterdam, had been gained by the French,
and the proposal was rejected. The Prince's enemies
derived the most plausible reasons of their opposition from
the situation of England, and the known and avowed at∣tachments
of the English Monarch.</P>
<P>No sooner had Charles dismissed his Parliaments, and
embraced the resolution of governing by prerogative
alone, than he dropped his new alliance with Spain, and
returned to his former dangerous connexions with Lewis.
<PB N="202" REF="250"/>
That Prince had even offered to make him arbiter of his
differences with Spain; and this latter power, sensible
of Charles's partiality, had refused to submit to such a
disadvantageous proposal. Whether any money was
now remitted to England, we do not certainly know:
But we may fairly presume, that the King's necessities
were in some degree relieved by France. And tho'
Charles had reason to apprehend the utmost danger from
the great, and still encreasing, naval power of that king∣dom,
joined to the weak condition of the English fleet,
no consideration was able to rouze him from his present
lethargy.</P>
<P>IT is here we are to fix the point of the highest ex∣altation,
which the power of Lewis or that of any Eu∣ropean
Prince, since the age of Charlemagne, had ever
attained. The only Monarch, capable of opposing his
progress, was entirely engaged in his interests; and the
Turks, invited by the malecontents of Hungary, were
preparing to invade the Emperor, and to disable that
Prince from making head against the progress of the
French power. Lewis may even be accused of oversight,
in not making sufficient advantage of such favourable op∣portunities,
which he was never afterwards able to re∣call.
But that Monarch, tho' more governed by mo∣tives
of ambition than by those of justice or moderation,
was still more actuated by the suggestions of vanity.
He contented himself with insulting and domineering
over all the Princes and free States of Europe; and he
thereby provoked their resentment, without subduing
their power. While every one, who approached his
person, and behaved with submission to his authority,
was treated with the highest politeness; all the neigh∣bouring
Potentates had successively felt the effects of his
haughty imperious disposition. And by indulging his
poets, orators, and courtiers in their flatteries, and in
their prognostications of universal empire, he conveyed
<PB N="203" REF="251"/>
faster, than by the prospect of his power alone, the ap∣prehension
of general conquest and subjection.</P>
<P>THE French greatness never,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1685.</NOTE> during his whole reign,
inspired Charles with any apprehensions; and Clifford,
'tis said, one of his most favoured ministers, went so far
as to affirm, that it were better for the King to be Vice∣roy
under a great and generous Monarch, than a slave to
five hundred of his own insolent subjects. The ambi∣tion
therefore and uncontrouled power of Lewis were
no diminution of Charles's happiness; and in other re∣spects
his condition seemed at present more eligible than
it had ever been since his restoration. A mighty faction,
which had shook his throne, and menaced his family,
was totally subdued, and by their precipitant indiscretion
had exposed themselves both to the rigour of the laws
and to public hatred. He had recovered his former po∣polarity
in the nation; and what probably pleased him
more than having a compliant Parliament, he was ena∣bled
to govern altogether without one. But it is cer∣tain,
that the King, amidst all these promising circum∣stances,
was not happy nor satisfied. Whether he found
himself exposed to difficulties for want of money, or
dreaded a recoil of the popular humour from the present
arbitrary measures, is uncertain. Perhaps the violent,
imprudent temper of the Duke, by pushing him upon
dangerous attempts, gave him apprehension and uneasi∣ness.
He was overheard to say one day, in opposing some
of the Duke's hasty councils, “Brother, I am too old
to go again to my travels: You may, if you choose
it.” Whatever was the cause of the King's dissatis∣faction,
it seems very probable, that he was meditating
some change of measures, and had formed a new plan of
administration. He was determined, 'tis thought, to
send the Duke to Scotland, to recall Monmonth, to
summon a Parliament, to dismiss all his unpopular mi∣nisters,
<PB N="202" REF="252"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="203" REF="253"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="204" REF="254"/>
and to throw himself entirely on the good will
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffection of his subjects. Amidst these truly wise
and virtuous designs, he was seized with a sudden fit,
which resembled an apoplexy; and tho' he was reco∣vered
from it by bleeding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's sick∣ness and death, 6th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> he languished only for a few days,
and then expired, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and
twenty-fifth of his reign. He was so happy in a good
constitution of body, and had ever been so remarkably
careful of his health, that his death struck as great a
surprize into his subjects, as if he had been in the flower
of his youth. And their inexpressible concern for him, owing
to their affection for his person, as well as the dread of his
successor, very naturally, when joined to the critical
time of his death, begot the suspicion of poison. All
circumstances however considered, this suspicion must
be allowed to vanish; like many others, of which all
histories are full.</P>
<P>DURING the few days of the King's illness, clergy∣men
of the church of England attended him; but he
discovered a total indifference towards their devotions
and exhortations. Catholic priests were brought, and
he received the sacrament from them, accompanied with
all the other rites of the Romish church. Two papers
were found in his closet, wrote with his own hand, and
containing arguments in favour of that communion.
The Duke had the imprudence immediately to publish
these papers; and thereby both confirmed all the re∣proaches
of those who had been the greatest enemies to
his brother's measures, and afforded to the whole world a
specimen of his own bigotry.</P>
<P>IF we survey the character of Charles the Second in the
different lights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and cha∣racter.</NOTE> which it will admit of, it will appear
very various, and give rise to different and even opposite
fentiments. When considered as a companion, he ap∣pears
the most amiable and engaging of men; and in∣deed,
in this view, his deportment must be allowed al∣together
<PB N="205" REF="255"/>
unexceptionable. His love of raillery was so
tempered with good breeding, that it was never offensive:
His propensity to satyre was so checked with discretion,
that his friends never dreaded their becoming the object
of it: His wit, to use the expression of one, who knew
him well, and who was himself an exquisite judge<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Marquess of Hallifax.</NOTE>,
could not be said so much to be very resined or elevated,
qualities apt to beget jealousy and apprehension in com∣pany,
as to be a plain, gaining, well-bred, recommend∣ing
kind of wit. And tho' perhaps he talked more
than strict rules of behaviour might permit, men were
so pleased with the affable, communicative deportment
of the Monarch, that they always went away contented
both with him and with themselves. This indeed is the
most shining part of the King's character; and he seems
to have been sensible of it: For he was fond of dropping
the formality of state, and of relapsing every moment
into the companion.</P>
<P>IN the duties of private life, his conduct, tho' not
free from exception, was, in the main, laudable. He
was an easy generous lover, a civil obliging husband, a
friendly brother, an indulgent father, and a good natured
master<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Duke of Buckingham.</NOTE>. The voluntary friendships, however, which
this Prince contracted, nay, even his sense of gratitude,
were feeble; and he never attached himself to any of
his ministers or courtiers with a very sincere affection.
He believed them to have no other motive for serving
him but self-interest, and he was still ready, in his turn,
to sacrifice them to present ease or convenience.</P>
<P>WITH a detail of his private character we must set
bounds to our panegyric on Charles. The other parts
of his conduct may admit of some apology, but can
deserve small applause. He was indeed so much fitted
for private life, preferably to public, that he even pos∣sessed
order, frugality, oeconomy in the former: Was
profuse, thoughtless, negligent in the latter. When
<PB N="206" REF="256"/>
we consider him as a Sovereign, his character, tho' not
altogether void of virtues, was in the main dangerous
to his people, and dishonourable to himself. Negligent
of the interests of the nation, careless of its glory,
averse to its religion, jealous of its liberty, lavish of its
treasure, sparing only of its blood; he exposed it by his
measures, tho' he appeared ever but in sport, to the dan∣ger
of a furious civil war, and even to the ruin and
ignominy of a foreign conquest. Yet may all these enor∣mities,
if fairly and candidly examined, be imputed, in
a great measure, to the indolence of his temper; a fault,
which, however unfortunate in a Monarch, it is im∣possible
for us to regard with great severity.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked of this King, that he never
said a foolish thing, nor ever did a wise one: A censure,
which, tho' too far carried, seems to have some founda∣tion
in his character and deportment.</P>
<P>IF we reflect on the appetite for power, inherent in
human nature, and add to it, the King's education in
foreign countries, and among the Cavaliers, a party which
would naturally exaggerate the late usurpations of po∣pular
assemblies upon the rights of Monarchy; it is not
surprizing, that civil liberty should not find in him a
very zealous patron. Harrassed with domestic factions,
weary of calumnies and complaints, oppressed with debts,
straitened in his revenue, he sought, tho' with feeble
efforts, for a form of government, more simple in its
structure and more easy in its management. But his
attachment to France, after all the pains, which we have
taken, by enquiry and conjecture, to fathom it, contains
still something, it must be confessed, mysterious and in∣explicable.
The hopes of rendering himself absolute
by Lewis's assistance seem so chimerical, that they could
scarce be retained with such obstinacy by a Prince o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Charles's penetration: And as to pecuniary subsidies▪
he surely spent much greater sums in one season, during
the second Dutch war, than were remitted from France
<PB N="207" REF="257"/>
during the course of his whole reign. I am apt there∣fore
to imagine, that Charles was in this particular
guided chiefly by inclination, and by a prepossession in
favour of the French nation. He considered that peo∣ple
as gay, sprightly, polite, elegant, courteous, devoted
to their Prince, and attached to the catholic faith; and for
these reasons he cordially loved them. The opposite
character of the Dutch, had rendered them the objects
of his aversion; and even the uncourtly humours of the
English made him very indifferent towards them. Men's
notions of interest are much warped by their affections;
and it is not altogether without example, that a man
may be guided by national prejudices, who has ever been
little biassed by private and personal friendship.</P>
<P>THE character of this Prince has been very elaborately
drawn by two great masters, perfectly well acquainted
with him, the duke of Buckingham and the marquess of
Hallifax; not to mention several elegant strokes given by
Sir William Temple. Dr. Welwood likewise and bi∣shop
Burnet have employed their pencil on the same sub∣ject:
But the former is somewhat partial in his favour;
as the latter is by far too harsh and malignant. Instead
of finding an exact parallel between Charles the Second
and the Emperor Tiberius, as that prelate pretends, it
would be more just to remark a full contrast and oppo∣sition.
The Emperor seems as much to have surpassed
the King in abilities, as he falls short of him in virtue.
Provident, wise, active, jealous, malignant, dark, sul∣len,
unsociable, reserved, cruel, unrelenting, unfor∣giving;
these are the lights, under which the Roman
tyrant has been transmitted to us. And the only cir∣cumstance,
in which, it can justly be pretended, he was
similar to Charles, is his love of women; a passion,
which is too general to form any striking resemblance,
and which that detestable and detested monster shared also
with unnatural appetites.</P>

<P>THE first act of James's reign was to assemble the
privy council;<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's first transactions.</NOTE> where, after some praises bestow∣ed
on the memory of his predecessor, he made
professions of his resolution to maintain the established
government, both in church and state. Tho' he had
been reported, he said, to have imbibed very arbitrary
principles, he knew that the laws of England were suf∣ficient
to make him as great a Monarch as he could wish;
and he was determined never to depart from them. And
as he had heretofore ventured his life in defence of the
<PB N="209" REF="259"/>
nation, he would still go as far as any man in maintain∣ing
all its just rights and liberties.</P>
<P>THIS discourse was received with great applause, not
only by the council, but by the whole nation. The
King universally passed for a man of great sincerity and
great honour; and as the current of favour ran at that
time for the Court, men believed, that his intentions were
conformable to his expressions. “We have now,” it
was said, “the word of a King; and a word never yet
broken.” Addresses came from allquarters, full of
duty, nay, of the most servile adulation. Every one
hastened to pay court to the new Monarch<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The Quakers' address was esteemed somewhat singular. It was con∣ceived in these terms. “We are come to testify our sorrow for the death of our good friend Charles, and our joy for thy being made our gover∣nour. We are told thou art not of the perswasion of the church of England, no more than we: Wherefore we hope thou wilt grant us the same liberty, which thou allowest thyself. Which doing, we wish thee all manner of happiness.”:</NOTE> And James
had reason to think, that, notwithstanding the violent
efforts made by so potent a party for his exclusion, no
throne in Europe was better established than that of
England.</P>
<P>THE King, however, in the first exercise of his au∣thority,
shewed, that either he was not sincere in his
professions of attachment to the laws, or that he had en∣tertained
so lofty an idea of his own legal power, that
even his utmost sincerity would tend very little to secure
the liberties of the people. All the customs and the
greater part of the excise had been voted by Parliament
during the late King's life, and consequently the grant
was now expired; nor had the successor any right to
levy these branches of revenue. But James issued a
proclamation, ordering the customs and excise to be paid
as before; and this exertion of power he would not deign
to qualify by the least act or even appearance of conde∣scension.
It was proposed to him, that, in order to
<PB N="208" REF="260"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="209" REF="261"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="210" REF="262"/>
prevent the ill effects of any intermission in levying these
duties, entries should be made, and bonds for the suns
taken of the merchants: But the payment be suspended
till the Parliament should give authority to receive it.
This precaution was recommended as an expression of
deference to that assembly, or rather to the laws: But
for that very reason probably, it was rejected by the
King, who thought, that the Commons would thence
be invited to assume more authority, and would regard
the whole revenue, and consequently the whole power
of the Crown, as dependant on their good will and
pleasure.</P>
<P>THE King likewise went openly, and with all the
ensigns of his dignity, to mass, an illegal meeting:
And by this imprudence he displayed at once his arbi∣trary
disposition, and the bigotry of his principles:
These two great characteristics of his reign and bane of
his administration. He even sent Caryl, as his agent to
Rome, to make submissions to the Pope, and to pave
the way for a solemn readmission of England into the
bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om of the catholic church. The Pope, Innocent the
XIth, very prudently advised the King not to be too
precipitant in his measures, nor rashly attempt what re∣peated
experience might convince him was absolutely
impracticable. The Spanish ambassador, Ronquillo,
deeming the tranquillity of England very requisite for the
support of Spain, used the freedom to make like remon∣strances.
He observed how busy the priests appeared at
court, and advised the King not to assent with too great
facility to their dangerous councils. “Is it not the
custom of Spain,” replied James, “for the King to
consult with his confessor?” “Yes,” said the ambas∣sador,
“and 'tis for that very reason our affairs succeed
“so ill.”</P>
<P>JAMES gave hopes on his accession, that he would
hold the ballance of power more steadily than his pre∣decessor;
<PB N="211" REF="263"/>
and that France, instead of rendering Eng∣land
subservient to her ambitious projects, would now meet
with strong opposition from that Kingdom. Be∣sides
applying himself to business with great industry, he
seemed jealous of national honour, and expressed great
care, that no more respect should be payed the French
ambassador than his own received at Paris. But these
appearances were not sufficiently supported; and he found
himself by degrees under the necessity of falling into an
union, at least of preserving peace, with that great Mo∣narch,
who, by his power as well as his zeal, seemed
alone capable of assisting him, in the projects formed for
promoting the catholic religion in England.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the King's prejudices, all the
chief offices of the Crown continued still in the hands of
Protestants Rochester was lord high treasurer; his bro∣ther
Clarendon lord chamberlain; Godolphin chamber∣lain
to the Queen; Sunderland secretary of state; Hal∣lifax
president of the council. This nobleman had stood
in opposition to the King during the last years of Charles's
reign; and when he attempted, on the accession, to
make some apology for his late measures, James very
genteely told him, that he would forget every thing that
was past, except his behaviour during the exclusion bill.
In other respects, however, the King appeared not of
so forgiving a temper. When the principal exclusionists
came to pay their respects to their new Sovereign, they
either were not admitted, or were received very coldly,
sometimes even with frowns. This conduct might suit
the character, which the King so much affected, of since∣rity:
But by showing, that a King of England could
resent the quarrels of a duke of Yorke, he gave his
people no high idea either of his lenity or magnanimity.</P>
<P>ON all occasions, the King was very free in declar∣ing,
that men must now look for a more active and more
vigilant government, and that he would retain no mi∣nisters,
<PB N="210" REF="264"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="211" REF="265"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="212" REF="266"/>
who did not practise an unreserved obedience to
his commands. We are not indeed to look For the
springs of his administration so much in his council and
chief officers of state, as in his own temper, and in the
character of those persons, with whom he secretly con∣sulted.
The Queen had great influence over him; a
woman of spirit, whose conduct had been very popular,
till she arrived at that high dignity. She was much go∣verned
by the priests, especially the jesuits; and as these
were also the King's favourites, all public measures were
taken originally from the suggestions of these men, and
bore evident marks of their ignorance in government,
and of the violence of their religious zeal.</P>
<P>THE King however had another attachment, seemingly
not very consistent with this devoted regard to his Queen
and to his priests: It was to Mrs. Sedley, whom he soon
after created countess of Dorchester, and who expected
to govern him with the same authority, which the
dutchess of Portsmouth had possessed during the former
reign. But the King, who had entertained the ambition
of converting his people, was told, that the regularity of
his life ought to correspond to the sanctity of his inten∣tions;
and he was prevailed with, at first, to remove
Mrs. Sedley from Court: A resolution in which he had
not the courage to persevere. Good agreement between
the mistress and the confessor of Princes is not commonly
a difficult matter to compass: But in the present case
these two potent engines of command were found very
incompatible. Mrs. Sedley, who possessed all the wit
and ingenuity of her father, Sir Charles, made the
priests and their councils the perpetual objects of her rail∣lery;
and it is not to be doubted, but they, on their
part, redoubled their exhortations with their penitent to
break off so criminal an attachment.</P>
<P>HOWEVER little inclination the King, as well as his
Queen and priests, might bear to an English Parliament,
<PB N="213" REF="267"/>
it was absolutely necessary, at the beginning of a reign,
to summon that assembly. The low condition, into
which the Whigs or country party had fallen during the
last years of Charles's reign, the odium under which they
laboured on account of the Rye-house conspiracy; these
causes made that party meet with little success in the
new elections. The general resignation too of the char∣ters
had made the corporations extremely dependent;
and the recommendations of the Court, tho' little as∣sisted,
at, that time, by pecuniary influence, were become
very prevalent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The new House of Commons therefore
consisted almost entirely of zealous Tories and church∣men;
and were of consequence strongly byassed, by
their affections, to comply with the measures of the
Crown.</P>
<P>THE discourse, which the King made “to the Parlia∣ment,
was more fitted to work on their fears than their
affections.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of May.</NOTE> He repeated indeed, and with great solem∣nity,
the promise which he had made before the privy
council, of governing according to the laws, and of preserv∣ing
the established religion: Brit at the same time he told
them, that he positively expected they would settle his
brother. “I might use many arguments,” said he,
“to in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orce this demand, the benefit of trade, the sup∣port
of the navy, the necessities of the Crown, and
the well-being of the government itself, which I must
not suffer to be precarious: But I am confident, that
your own consideration and your sense of what is
just and reasonable will suggest to you whatever on
this occasion might be enlarged upon. There is
indeed one popular argument,” added he, “which
may be urged against compliance with my demand:
Men may think, that by feeding me from time to
time with such supplies as they think convenient,
they will better secure frequent meetings of Parlia∣ment:
<PB N="214" REF="268"/>
But as this is the first time I speak to you from
the throne, I must plainly tell you, that such an ex∣pedient
would be very improper to employ with me,
and that the best way to engage me to meet you often
is always to use me well.”</P>
<P>IT was easy to interpret this language of the King.
He plainly intimated, that he had resources in his pre∣rogative
for supporting the government, independaent of
their supplies; and that so long as they complied with
his demands, he would have recourse to them; but that
any ill usage on their part would set him free from those
measures of government, which he seemed to regard
more as voluntary than as necessary. It must be con∣fessed,
that no Parliament in England was ever placed in
a more critical situation, nor where more forcible argu∣ments
could be urged, either for their opposition or com∣pliance
with the Court.</P>
<P>IT was said on the one hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for and against a revenue during life.</NOTE> that jealousy of royal
power was the very basis of the English constitution, and
the principle to which the nation was beholden for all
that liberty, which they enjoy above the subjects of other
monarchies. That this jealousy, tho', at different peri∣ods,
it may be more or less intense, can never safely be
laid asleep, even under the best and wisest Princes. That
the character of the present Sovereign afforded cause
for the highest vigilance, by reason of the arbitrary prin∣ciples,
which he had imbibed; and still more, by rea∣son
of his religious zeal, which it is impossible for him
ever to gratify, without assuming more authority than
the constitution allows him. That power is to be
watched in its very first encroachments; nor is any thing
ever gained by timidity and submission. That every con∣cession
adds new force to usurpation; and at the same
time, by discovering the dastardly dispositions of the
people, inspires it with new courage and enterprize.
That as arms were intrusted altogether in the hands of the
<PB N="215" REF="269"/>
Prince, no check remained upon him but the dependant
condition of his revenue; a security therefore which it
would be the most egregious folly to abandon. That all
the other barriers, which, of late years, had been
erected against arbitrary power, would be found, without
this capital article, to be rather pernicious and destruct∣ive.
That new limitations in the constitution stimulated
the Monarch's inclination to surmount the laws, and
required frequent meetings of Parliament, in order to re∣pair
all the breaches, which either time or violence may
have made upon that complicated fabric. That recent
experience during the reign of the late King, a Prince
who wanted neither prudence nor moderation, had suf∣ficiently
proved the solidity of all these maxims. That
his Parliament, having rashly fixed his revenue for life,
and at the same time repealed the triennial bill, found
that they themselves were no longer of importance, and
that liberty, not protected by national assemblies, was
exposed to every outrage and violation. And that the
more openly the King made an unreasonable demand,
the more obstinately ought it to be refused; since it is
evident, that his purpose in making it cannot possibly be
justifiable.</P>
<P>ON the other hand it was urged, that the rule of
watching the very first encroachments of power could
only have place, where the opposition to it might be
regular, peaceful, and legal. That tho' the refusal of
the King's present demand might seem to be of this na∣ture,
yet in reality it involved consequences, which led
much farther than at first sight might be apprehended.
That the King in his speech had plainly intimated, that
he had resources in his prerogative, which, in case of
opposition from Parliament, he thought himself sully in∣titled
to employ. That if the Parliament openly disco∣vered
an intention of reducing him to dependance, mat∣ters
must presently be brought to a crisis, at a time the
<PB N="216" REF="270"/>
most favourable to his cause, which his most sanguine
wishes could ever have promised him. That if we cast
our eyes abroad, to the state of affairs on the conti∣nent,
to the situation of Scotland and Ireland; or, what
is of more importance, if we consider the disposition of
men's minds at home, every circumstance would be
found adverse to the cause of liberty. That the country
party, during the late reign, by their violent, and in
many respects unjustifiable measures in Parliament, by
their desperate attempts out of Parliament, had exposed
their principles to public hatred, and had excited extreme
jealousy in all the Royalists and zealous churchmen,
who now formed the bulk of the nation. That it would
not be acceptable to that party to see this King worse
treated than his brother in point of revenue, or any at∣tempts
made to keep the Crown in dependance. That
they thought Parliaments as liable to abuse as Monarchy,
and desired not to see things in a situation, where the
King could not, if he found it requisite, either pro∣rogue
or dissolve them. That if the present Parliament,
by making great concessions, could gain the King's con∣fidence,
and engage him to observe the promises now
given them, every thing would by gentle methods suc∣ceed
to their wishes. That if, on the contrary, after
such instances of compliance, he formed any design on
the liberties and religion of the nation, he would in the
eyes of all mankind render himself entirely inexcusable,
and the whole people would join in opposition to him.
That resistance could scarce be attempted twice; and
there was therefore the greater necessity of waiting till
time and incidents had prepared the minds of the nation
for it. That the King's prejudices in favour of popery,
tho' in the main pernicious, yet were so far fortunate,
that they rendered the connexion inseparable between
the national religion and national liberty. And that if
any illegal attempts were afterwards made, the church,
<PB N="217" REF="271"/>
which was at present the chief security of the Crown,
would surely catch the alarm, and would soon dispose
the people to an effectual resistance.</P>
<P>THESE last reasons, fortified by the prejudices and af∣fections
of party, prevailed in Parliament; and the
Commons, besides thanks for the King's speech, voted
unanimously, that they would settle on the present King
during life all the revenue enjoyed by the late King at
the time of his decease. That they might not detract
from this generosity by any symptoms of distrust, they
also voted unanimously, that the House entirely relied
on his Majesty's royal word and repeated declarations to
support the religion of the church of England: but they
added, that that religion was dearer to them than their
lives. The speaker, in presenting the revenue-bill, took
care to inform the King of the Commons' vote with re∣gard
to religion: but could not, by so signal a proof of
confidence, extort from him one word, in favour of that
religion, on which, he told his Majesty, they set so high
a value. Notwithstanding the grounds of suspicion,
which this silence afforded, the House continued in the
same liberal disposition. The King having demanded a
farther supply for the navy and other purposes, they re∣vived
those duties on wines and vinegar, which had been
once enjoyed by the late King; and they added some im∣positions
on tobacco and sugar. This grant amounted
on the whole to about six hundred thousand pounds a
year.</P>
<P>THE House of Lords were in a humour no less com∣pliant.
They even went some lengths towards breaking
in pieces all the remains of the popish plot; that once
formidable engine of bigotry and faction.</P>
<P>A LITTLE before the meeting of Parliament, Oates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oates con∣victed of perjury.</NOTE>
had been tried for perjury on two indictments. One for
swearing, that he was present at a consult of jesuits in
London the twenty-fourth of April, 1679: Another for
<PB N="216" REF="272"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="217" REF="273"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="218" REF="274"/>
swearing, that father Ireland was in London between
the eighth and twelfth of August and on the beginning
of September in the same year. Never crimnal was con∣victed
on fuller and more undoubted evidence. Two
and twenty persons, who had been students at St. Omers,
most of them men of credit and family, gave evidence,
that Oates had entered into that seminary about Christ∣mas
in the preceding year, and had never been absent
but one night, till the month of July following. For∣ty-seven
witnesses, persons also of untainted character,
swore that father Ireland, on the third of August, had
gone to Staffordshire, where he resided till the middle of
September; and, what some years before would have
been regarded as a very material circumstance, nine of
these witnesses were Protestants of the church of Eng∣land.
Oates's sentence was to be fined a thousand marks
on each indictment, to be whipped on two different days
from Aldgate to Newgate, and from Newgate to Ty∣burn,
to be imprisoned during life, and to be pilloried
five times every year. The impudence of the man sup∣ported
itself under the conviction, and his courage un∣der
the punishment. He made solemn appeals to Heaven,
and protectations of the veracity of his testimony: Tho'
the whipping was so cruel, that it was evidently the in∣tention
of the Court to put him to death by that punish∣ment,
he was enabled, by the care of his friends, to re∣cover:
And he lived to King William's reign; when he
had a pension of four hundred pounds a year settled on
him. A considerable number still adhered to him in his
distresses, and regarded him as the martyr of the prote∣stant
cause. The populace were affected with the sight
of a punishment, more severe than is commonly exer∣cised
in England. And the sentence of perpetual im∣prisonment was deemed illegal.</P>
<P>THE conviction of Oates's perjury was taken notice of by
the house of Peers. Besides freeing the popish lords, Powis,
<PB N="219" REF="275"/>
Arundel, Bellasis, and Tyrone, together with Danby,
from the former impeachment by the Commons, they
went so far as to vote a reversal of Stafford's attainder,
on account of the falshood of that evidence, on which
he had been condemned. This bill fixed so deep a stain on
the former proceedings of the exclusionists, that it met
with great opposition among the Lords; and it was at
last, after one reading, dropped by the Commons. Tho'
the reparation of injustice be the second honour, which
a nation can attain; the present emergence seemed very
improper for granting so full a justification of the ca∣tholics,
and throwing so signal an imputation on the Pro∣testants.</P>
<P>THE course of parliamentary proceedings was inter∣rupted
by the news of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon∣mouth's in∣vasion.</NOTE> Monmouth's arrival on the west
coast with three ships from Holland. No sooner was
this intelligence conveyed to the Parliament, than they
voted, that they would adhere to his Majesty with their
lives and fortunes. They passed a bill of attainder against
Monmouth: and they granted a supply of four hundred
thousand pounds for suppressing this rebellion. After
having thus strengthened the hands of the King, they
adjourned themselves.</P>
<P>MONMOUTH, when ordered to depart the kingdom,
during the late reign, had retired to Holland; and as it
was well known, that he was still much favoured by his
indulgent father, all marks of honour and distinction
were bestowed upon him by the Prince of Orange. Af∣ter
the accession of James, the Prince thought proper
to dismiss Monmouth and all his followers; and that
illustrious fugitive retired to Brussels. Finding himself
still pursued by the King's severity, he was pushed, con∣trary
to his judgment as well as inclination, to make a
very rash and premature attempt upon England. He saw
that the King had lately mounted the Throne, not only
without opposition, but seemingly with the good will

and affections of his subjects. A Parliament was sit∣ting,
which discovered the greatest disposition to com∣ply
with the Court, and whose adherence to the Crown,
he knew, would give a sanction and authority to all pu∣blic
measures. The grievances of this reign were hitherto
inconsiderable; and the people were not as yet in a dis∣position
to remark them with great severity. All these
considerations occurred to Monmouth; but such was the
impatience of his followers, such the precipitate humour
of Argyle, who set out for Scotland a little before him,
that no reasons could be attended to; and this unhappy
man was drove upon his fate.</P>
<P>THE imprudence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of June.</NOTE> however, of this enterprize did
not at first appear. Tho' on his landing at Lime in
Dorsetshire, he had cearce a hundred followers; so po∣pular
was his name, that in four days he had assembled
above two thousand horse and foot. They were indeed
almost all of them, the lowest of the people; and his
declaration was chiefly calculated to suit the prejudices
of the vulgar, or the most bigotted of the whig-party.
He called the King, Duke of Yorke; and denominated
him a traitor, a tyrant, a murderer, a popish usurper
He imputed to him the fire of London, the murder of
Godfrey and of Essex, nay the poisoning the late King.
And he invited all the people to join in opposition to his
tyranny.</P>
<P>THE duke of Albemarle, son to him who had restored
the Royal Family, summoned together the militia of
Devonshire to the number of 4000 men, and took post
at Axminster, in order to oppose the rebels; but observ∣ing,
that his troops bore a great affection to Monmouth,
he thought proper to retire. Monmouth, tho' he had
formerly given many signal proofs of personal courage,
had not the vigour of mind requisite for an undertaking
of this nature. From an ill grounded diffidence of his
men, he neglected to attack Albemarle; an easy enter∣prize,
<PB N="221" REF="279"/>
by which he might both have acquired credit and
supplied himself with arms. Lord Gray, who com∣manded
his horse, discovered himself to be a notorious
coward; yet such was the softness of Monmouth's na∣ture,
that Gray was still continued in his command.
Fletcher of Salton, a Scotsman, a person of signal pro∣bity
and fine genius, had been engaged by his republi∣can
principles in this enterprize, and commanded the
cavalry together with Gray: But being insulted by one,
who had newly joined the army, and whose horse he had
in a hurry made use of, he was prompted by passion, to
which he was much subject, to discharge a pistol at the
man; and he killed him on the spot. This accident ob∣liged
him immediately to leave the camp; and the loss of
so gallant an officer was a great prejudice to Monmouth's
enterprize.</P>
<P>THE next station of the rebels was Taunton, a very
disaffected town, which gladly and even fondly received
them, and re-inforced them with considerable numbers.
Twenty young maids of some rank presented Monmouth
with a pair of colours of their handiwork, together with
a copy of the bible. Monmouth was here persuaded to
take upon him the title of King, and assert the le∣gitimacy
of his birth; a claim, which he advanced in
his first declaration, but whose discussion he was deter∣mined,
he then said, during some time to postpone. His
numbers had now increased to six thousand men; and
he was obliged every day, for want of arms, to dismiss a
great many, who crowded to his standard. He entered
Bridgewater, Wells, Frome; and was proclaimed in all
these places: But forgetting, that such desperate enter∣prizes
can only be rendered successful by the most adven∣turous
courage, he allowed the expectations of the' peo∣ple
to languish, without attempting any considerable un∣dertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="280"/>
WHILE Monmouth by his imprudent and ill-timed
caution, was thus wasting time in the West, the King
employed himself in making preparations to oppose him.
Six regiments of British troops were called over from
Holland: The army was considerably augmented: And
regular forces, to the number of 3000 men, were dis∣patched
under the command of Feversham and Churchill,
in order to check the progress of the rebels.</P>
<P>MONMOUTH, observing that no considerable men
joined him, finding that an insurrection which was pro∣jected
in the city had not taken place, hearing that Ar∣gyle,
his confederate, was already defeated and taken;
sunk into such despondency, that he had once resolved
to withdraw himself, and leave his unhappy followers to
their fate. His followers expressed more courage than
their leader, and seemed determined to adhere to him in
every fortune.<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th of July. Monmouth defeated,</NOTE> The negligent disposition made by Fe∣versham,
invited Monmouth to attack the King's army
at Sedgemoor near Bridgewater; and his men in this
action showed what a native courage and a principle of
duty, even when unassisted by discipline, is able to per∣form.
They made great impression on the veteran forces;
drove them from their ground; continued the fight till
their ammunition failed them; and would at last have
obtained a victory, had not the misconduct of Monmouth
and the cowardice of Gray prevented it. After a con∣test
of three hours the rebels gave way; and were fol∣lowed
with great slaughter. About 1500 fell in the
battle and pursuit. And thus was concluded in a few
weeks this enterprize, rashly undertaken, and feebly
conducted.</P>
<P>MONMOUTH fled from the field of battle above twenty
miles, till his horse sunk under him. He then changed
cloaths with a peasant, in order to conceal himself. The
peasant was found by the pursuers, who now redoubled
<PB N="223" REF="281"/>
the diligence of their search. At last, the unhappy
Monmouth was discovered, lying in the bottom of a
ditch, and covered with fern: His body depressed with
fatigue and hunger; his mind by the memory of past
misfortunes, by the prospect of future disasters. Hu∣man
nature is unequal to such calamitous situations;
much more, the temper of a man, softened by early
prosperity, and accustomed to value himself chiefly on
military bravery. He burst into tears, when seized by
his enemies; and he seemed still to indulge the fond
hope and desire of life. Tho' he might have known,
from the greatness of his own offences, and the severity
of James's temper, that no mercy could be expected, he
wrote him the most submissive letters, and conjured him
to spare the blood of a brother, who had ever been so
strongly attached to his interests. James, finding such
symptoms of depression and despondency in the unhappy
prisoner, admitted him to his presence, in hopes of ex∣torting
a discovery of his accomplices: But Monmouth
would not purchase life, however loved, at the price of
so much infamy. Finding all efforts vain, he assumed
courage from despair, and prepared himself for death,
with a spirit, better suited to his rank and character.
This favourite of the people was attended to the scaf∣fold
with a plentiful effusion of tears. He warned the
executioner not to fall into the error which he had com∣mitted
in b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heading Russel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and exe∣cuted, 15th of July.</NOTE> where it had been necessary
to redouble the blow. This precaution served only to
dismay the executioner. He struck a feeble blow on
Monmouth, who raised his head from the block, and
looked him in the face, as if reproaching him for his
failure. He gently laid down his head a second time;
and the executioner struck him again and again to no
purpose. He at last threw aside the ax, and cried out
that he was incapable of finishing the bloody office. The
sheriff obliged him to renew the attempt; and at two
blows more the head was severed from the body.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="282"/>
THUS perished in the thirty-sixth year of his age a
nobleman, who, in less turbulent times, was well qua∣lified
to be an ornament to the Court, even to be ser∣viceable
to his country. The favour of his Prince, the
caresses of faction, the allurements of popularity, se∣duced
him into enterprizes, which exceeded his capa∣city.
The good will of the people still followed him in
every fortune. Even after his execution, their fond cre∣dulity
flattered them with hopes of seeing him once more
at their head. They believed, that the person executed
was not Monmouth, but one, who, having the fortune
to resemble him nearly, was willing to give this proof of
his extreme attachment, and to suffer death in his stead.</P>
<P>THIS victory, obtained by the King in the commence∣ment
of his reign, would naturally, had it been pru∣dently
managed, have tended much to encrease his power
and authority. But by reason of the cruelty, with which
it was prosecuted, and of the temerity, which it after∣wards
occasioned, it was a principal cause of his sudden
ruin and downfall.</P>
<P>SUCH arbitrary principles had the Court instilled into
all its servants, that Feversham, immediately after the
victory, hanged up above twenty prisoners; and was
proceeding in his executions, when the bishop of Bath
and Wells warned him, that these unhappy men were
now by law entitled to a trial, and that their execution
would be deemed a real murther. This remonstrance
however did not stop the savage nature of colonel Kirke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelty of colonel Kirke.</NOTE>
a soldier of fortune, who had long served at Tangiers,
and had contracted from his habitudes with the Moors,
an inhumanity less known in European and in free coun∣tries.
At his first entry into Bridgewater, he hanged
nineteen without the least enquiry into the merits of
their cause. As if to make sport with death, he or∣dered
a certain number to be executed, while he and
his company should drink to the King's health, or to the
<PB N="225" REF="283"/>
queen's, or to judge Jefferies's. Observing their feet
to shake in the agonies of death, he cried that he would
give them music to their dancing; and he immediately
commanded the drums to beat and the trumpets to sound.
By way of experiment, he ordered one man to be hung
up three times, questioning him at every interval, whe∣ther
he repented of his crime: But the man obstinately
asserting, that, notwithstanding all the past, he would
still willingly engage in the same cause, Kirke ordered
him to be hung in chains. One story, commonly told
of him, is memorable for the treachery, as well as bar∣barity,
which attended it. A young maid pleaded for
the life of her brother, and flung herself at Kirke's feet,
armed with all the charms, which beauty and innocence,
bathed in tears, could bestow upon her. The tyrant
was inflamed with desire, not softened into love or cle∣mency.
He promised to grant her request, provided
that she, in her turn, would be equally compliant to
him. The maid yielded to the conditions: But after she
had passed the night with him, the wanton savage, next
morning, showed her from the window her brother,
the darling object for whom she had sacrificed her virtue,
hanged on a gibbet, which he had secrectly ordered to be
there erected for his execution. Rage and despair and
indignation took possession of her mind, and deprived
her for ever of her senses. All the inhabitants of that
country, innocent as well as guilty, were exposed to the
ravages of this barbarian. The soldiery were let loose
to live on free quarter; and his own regiment, instructed
by his example, and encouraged by his exhortations,
distinguished themselves in a more particular manner by
their outrages. By way of pleasantry he used to deno∣minate
them <HI>his lambs;</HI> an appellation, which was long
remembered with horror in the west of England.</P>
<P>THE cruel Jefferies succeeded after some interval;
and showed the people, that the rigours of the law
<PB N="226" REF="284"/>
might equal, if not exceed, the ravages of military
tyranny. This man, who wantoned in cruelty, had al∣ready
given a specimen of his character in many trials,
where he had presided; and he now set out with a savage
joy as to a full harvest of death and destruction. He
began at Dorchester; and thirty rebels being arraigned,
he exhorted them, but in vain, to save him, by their free
confession, the trouble of trying them: And when twenty-nine
were found guilty, he ordered them, as an ad∣ditional
punishment of their disobedience, to be led to
immediate execution. Most of the other prisoners, terri∣fied
with this example, pleaded guilty; and no less than
two hundred and ninety-two received sentence at Dor∣chester.
Of these eighty were executed. Exeter was
the next stage of his cruelty: Two hundred and forty-three
were there tried, of whom a great number were
condemned and executed. He also opened his commission
at Taunton and Wells; and every where carried terror
and astonishment along with him. The juries were so
struck with his menaces, that they gave their verdict
with precipitation, and many innocent persons were in∣volved
with the guilty. And on the whole, besides those
butchered by the military commanders, two hundred
and fifty-one are computed to have fallen by the hand of
justice. The whole country was strowed with the heads
and limbs of traitors. Every village almost beheld the
dead carcass of a wretched inhabitant. And all the ri∣gours
of justice, unabated by any appearance of cle∣mency,
were fully displayed to the people by the in∣human
Jefferies.</P>
<P>OF all the executions during this dismal period, the
most remarkable were those of Mrs. Gaunt and Lady
Lisle, who had been accused of harbouring traitors.
Mrs. Gaunt was an Anabaptist, noted for her benefi∣cence,
which she extended to persons of all professions
and perswasions. One of the robels, knowing her hu∣mane
<PB N="227" REF="285"/>
character, had recourse to her in his distress, and
was concealed by her. Hearing of the proclamation,
which offered an indemnity and rewards to such as dis∣covered
criminals, he basely betrayed his benefactress,
and bore evidence against her. He received a pardon for
his treachery; she was burned alive for her charity.</P>
<P>LADY LISLE was widow of one of the Regicides,
who had enjoyed great favour and authority under Crom∣wel,
and who having fled, after the restoration, to Lau∣zunne
in Swisserland, was there assassinated by three Irish
ruffians, who hoped to make their fortune by this infa∣mous
piece of service. His widow was now prosecuted for
harbouring two rebels the day after the battle of Sedge∣moor;
and Jefferies pushed on the trial with the most
unrelenting violence. In vain did the aged prisoner plead,
that these criminals had been put into no proclamation,
had been convicted by no verdict; nor could any man
be denominated a traitor, till the sentence of some legal
court was passed upon him: That it appeared not by any
proof, that she was so much as acquainted with the guilt
of the persons, or had heard of their joining the rebel∣lion
of Monmouth: That tho' she might be obnoxious
on account of her family, it was well known, that her
heart was ever loyal, and that no person in Eng∣land
had shed more tears for that fatal event, in
which her husband had unfortunately bore too great
a share: And that the same principles, which she herself
had ever embraced, she had carefully instilled into her
son, and had, at that very time, sent him to fight against
those rebels, whom she was now accused of harbouring.
Tho' these arguments did not move Jefferies, they had
influence on the jury. Twice they seemed inclined to
bring in a favourable verdict: They were as often sent
back with menaces and reproaches; and at last were
constrained to give sentence against the prisoner. Not∣withstanding
all applications for pardon, the cruel sen∣tence
<PB N="228" REF="286"/>
was executed. The King said, that he had given
Jefferies a promise not to pardon her: An excuse, which
could serve only to aggravate the blame against himself.</P>
<P>ONE might have hoped, that, by all these bloody execu∣tions,
a rebellion, so precipitate, so ill supported, and of
such short duration, would have been sufficiently expi∣ated:
But nothing could satiate the spirit of rigour,
which possessed the administration Even those multi∣tudes,
who received pardon, were obliged to attone for
their guilt by fines, which reduced them to beggary; or
where their former poverty made them incapable of pay∣ment,
they were condemned to cruel whippings or se∣vere
imprisonments. Nor could the innocent escape the
hands, equally rapacious as cruel, of the chief justice.
Prideaux, a gentleman of Devonshire, being thrown into
prison, and terrified with the severe and arbitrary mea∣sures,
which at that time met with no controul, was
obliged to buy his liberty of Jefferies at the price of fif∣teen
thousand pounds; tho' he could never so much as
learn the crime of which he was accused.</P>
<P>GOODENOUGH, the seditious under-sheriff of London,
who had been engaged in the most bloody and desperate
part of the Rye-house conspiracy, was taken prisoner af∣ter
the battle of Sedgemoor, and was resolved to save his
own life, by an accusation of Cornish, the sheriff, whom
he knew to be extremely obnoxious to the Court. Co∣lonel
Rumsey joined him in the accusation; and the pro∣secution
was so hastened, that the prisoner was tried, con∣demned,
and executed in the space of a week. The
perjury of the witnesses appeared immediately after; and
the King seemed to regret the execution of Cornish. He
granted his estate to his family, and condemned the wit∣nesses
to perpetual imprisonment.</P>
<P>THE injustice of this sentence against Cornish, was
not required to disgust the nation against the Court:
The continued rigour of the other executions had al∣ready
<PB N="229" REF="287"/>
impressed an universal hatred towards the ministers
of justice, attended with a compassion for the unhappy
sufferers, who, as they had been seduced into this crime
by mistaken principles, bore their punishment with the
spirit and zeal of martyrs. The people might have been
willing on this occasion to distinguish between the King
and his ministers: But care was taken to prove, that the
latter had done nothing but what was agreeable to their
master. Jefferies, on his return, was immediately, for
those eminent services, created a peer; and was soon af∣ter
vested with the dignity of chancellor. No body could
then doubt but that the King intended to rule more by
fear than love, and that he was not averse to the cruelties
which had been practised.</P>
<P>WE must now take a view of the state of affairs in
Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of af∣fairs in Scotland.</NOTE> where the fate of Argyle had been decided
before that of Monmouth. Immediately after the King's
accession, a Parliament had been summoned at Edin∣burgh;
and all affairs were there conducted by the duke
of Queensbery the commissioner, and the earl of Perth
the chancellor. The former had resolved to make an
entire surrender of the liberties of his country; but was
determined still to adhere to its religion: The latter en∣tertained
no scruples of paying court even by the sacrifice
of both. But no courtiers, even the most prostitute,
could go farther than the Parliament itself, towards a re∣signation
of their liberties. In a vote, which they called
an offer of duty, after adopting the fabulous history of
an hundred and eleven Scots Monarchs, they acknow∣ledged,
that all these Princes, by the primary and fun∣damental
law of the state, had been vested with a <HI>solid</HI>
and <HI>absolute</HI> authority. They declared their abhorrence
of all principles and positions, derogatory to the King's
sacred, supreme, sovereign, absolute power, of which
none, they said, whether single persons or collective bo∣dies,
can participate, but in dependance on him and by
<PB N="230" REF="288"/>
commission from him. They promised, that the whole
nation, between sixty and sixteen, shall be in readiness
for his Majesty's service, where and as oft as it shall be
his royal pleasure to require them. And they annexed
the whole excise both of inland and foreign commodities
for ever to the Crown.</P>
<P>ALL the other acts of this assembly savoured of the
same spirit. They declared it high treason for any per∣son
to refuse the test, if tendered by the council. To
defend the obligation of the covenant, subjected a per∣son
to the same penalty. To be present at any conven∣ticle,
was made punishable with death and confiscation
of goods. Even such as refused to give testimony, ei∣ther
in cases of treason or nonconformity, were declared
equally punishable as if guilty of those very crimes: An
excellent prelude to all the rigours of an inquisition. It
must be confessed, that nothing could equal the abject
servility of the Scotch nation during this period but the
arbitrary severity of the administration.</P>
<P>IT was in vain, that Argyle summoned a nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle's invasion,</NOTE> so
lost to all sense of liberty, so degraded by repeated in∣dignities,
to rise in vindication of their violated laws
and privileges. The greater part of those who declared
for him, were his own vassals; men, who, if possible,
were still more sunk in slavery than the rest of the na∣tion.
He arrived, after a prosperous voyage, in Ar∣gyleshire,
attended by some fugitives from Holland; and
among the rest, by Sir Patric Hume, a man of mild
dispositions, who had been driven to this extremity by a
continued train of oppression. The privy council was
apprized of Argyle's intentions. The whole militia of
the kingdom, to the number of twenty-two thousand men,
were already in arms; and a third part of them, with
all the regular forces, were on their march to oppose
him. All the considerable gentry of his clan were thrown
into prison. And two ships of war were on the coast
<PB N="231" REF="289"/>
to watch his motions. Under all these discouragements
he yet made a shift, partly from terror, partly from af∣fection,
to collect and arm a body of about two thou∣sand
five hundred men; but soon found himself surrounded
on all sides with insuperable difficulties. His arms and
ammunition were seized: His provisions cut off: The
marquess of Athole pressed him on one side; lord Charles
Murray on another; the Duke of Gordon hung upon
his rear;<NOTE PLACE="marg">defeat,</NOTE> the earl of Dunbarton met him in front. His
followers daily fell off from him; but Argyle, resolute
to persevere, broke at last with the shattered remains of
his troops into the disaffected part of the low countries,
which he had endeavoured to allure to him by declara∣tions
for the covenant. No person showedei ther courage
or inclination to join him; and his small and still de∣creasing
army, after wandering about for a little time,
was at last defeated and dissolved without an enemy.
Argyle himself was seized and carried to Edinburgh;<NOTE PLACE="marg">and execu∣tion.</NOTE>
where, after enduring many indignities with a gallant
spirit, he was publickly executed. He suffered upon the
former unjust sentence, which had been passed upon him.
The rest of his followers either escaped or were pardoned;
all except Rombold and Ayloffe, two Englishmen, who
had attended him on this expedition.</P>
<P>THE King was so elated with this continued tide of
prosperity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of No∣vember. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> that he began to undervalue even an English
Parliament, at all times formidable to his family; and
from his speech to both Houses, whom he had assembled
early in the winter, he seemed to think himself exempt∣ed
from all rules of prudence or necessity of dissimula∣tion
He plainly told the two houses, that the militia,
which had formerly been so much magnified, was now
found, by the experience of the last rebellion, to be al∣together
useless; and he required a new supply, in order
to maintain those additional forces, which he had levied.
The also took notice, that he had employed a great many
<PB N="232" REF="290"/>
catholic officers, and that he had, in their favour, dis∣pensed
with the law, requiring the test to be taken by
every one who possessed any public office. And to cut
short all opposition, he declared, that, having reaped
the benefit of their service during such times of danger,
he was determined, neither to expose them afterwards to
disgrace, nor himself, in case of another rebellion, to
the want of their assistance.</P>
<P>SUCH violent aversion did this Parliament bear to op∣position;
so great dread had been instilled of the con∣sequences
attending any breach with the King; that it is
probable, had he used his dispensing power without de∣claring
it, no enquiries would have been made, and
time might have reconciled the nation to this dangerous
exercise of the prerogative. But to invade at once their
constitution, to threaten their religion, to establish a
standing army, and even to require them, by their con∣currence,
to contribute towards all these measures, ex∣ceeded
the bounds of their patience, and they began,
for the first time, to display some small remains of Eng∣lish
spirit and generosity. When the King's speech
was taken into consideration by the Commons, many se∣vere
reflections were thrown out against the present mea∣sures;
and the House was with seeming difficulty en∣gaged
to promise in a general vote, that they would grant
some supply. But instead of finishing that business,
which could alone render them acceptable to the King,
they proceeded to examine the dispensing power; and
they voted an address to the King against it. Before this
address was presented, they resumed the consideration of
the supply; and as one million two hundred thousand
pounds were demanded by the Court, and two hundred
thousand pounds proposed by the country-party, a mid∣dle
course was chosen, and seven hundred thousand
pounds, after some dispute, were at last voted. The
address against the dispensing power was expressed in the
<PB N="233" REF="291"/>
most respectful and submissive manner; yet was it very
ill received by the King, and his answer contained a
flat denial, uttered with great warmth and vehemence.
The Commons were so daunted with this reply, that
they kept silence a long time; and when Coke, member
for Derby, rose up and said, “I hope we are all English∣men,
and not to be frighted with a few hard words;”
so little spirit appeared in that assembly, often so refrac∣tory
and mutinous, that they sent him to the Tower for
bluntly expressing a free and generous sentiment. They
adjourned, without fixing a day for the consideration of
his Majesty's answer; and on their next meeting, they
very submissively proceeded to the consideration of the
supply, and even went so far as to establish funds for
paying the sum voted, in nine years and a half. The
King, therefore, had in effect, almost without struggle
or violence, obtained a total victory over the Commons;
and instead of contesting for their liberties, now ex∣posed
to manifest danger, they even conferred an addi∣tional
revenue to the Crown; and rendering the King
in some degree independent, contributed to encrease those
imminent dangers, with which they had so good reason
to be alarmed.</P>
<P>THE next opposition came from the House of Peers,
which has not commonly taken the lead on these occa∣sions,
and even from the bench of bishops, whence the
Court usually expects the greatest complaisance and sub∣mission.
The upper House had been engaged, in the
first days of the session, to give general thanks for the
King's speech; by which compliment they were under∣stood,
according to the practice of that time, to have
acquiesced in every part of it: Yet notwithstanding that
step, Compton, bishop of London, in his own name
and that of his brethren, moved that a day should be
appointed for taking the speech into consideration: He
was seconded by Halifax, Nottingham, and Mordaunt.
<PB N="234" REF="292"/>
Jefferies, the chancellor, opposed this motion; and
seemed inclined to use in that House the same arrogance,
to which on the bench he had so long been accustomed:
But he was soon taught to know his place; and he
proved, by his behaviour, that insolence, when checked,
naturally sinks into meanness and cowardice. The bi∣shop
of London's motion prevailed.</P>
<P>THE King might reasonably have presumed, that
even if the Peers should so far recover courage as to
make an application against his dispensing power, the
same steddy answer, which he had given the Commons,
would make them relapse into the same timidity; and he
might by that means have obtained a very considerable
supply, without making any concessions in return. But
so imperious was his temper, so lofty the idea which he
had entertained of his own authority, so violent the
schemes suggested by his own bigotry and that of his
priests; that, without any delay, without waiting for
any farther provocation, he immediately proceeded to a
prorogation. He continued the Parliament during a
year and a half by four more prorogations; but having
in vain tried by separate applications to break the ob∣stinacy
of the leading members, he at last dissolved that
assembly. And as it was plainly impossible for him to
find among his protestant subjects a set of men more de∣voted
to royal authority, it was universally concluded,
that he intended thenceforth to govern entirely without
Parliaments.</P>
<P>NEVER King mounted the throne of England with
greater advantages than James; nay, possessed greater
facility, if that were any advantage, of rendering him∣self
and his posterity absolute: But all these fortunate
circumstances tended only, by his own misconduct, to
bring more sudden ruin upon him. The nation seemed
disposed of themselves to resign their liberties into his
hands, had he not, at the same time, made an attempt
<PB N="235" REF="293"/>
upon their religion: And he might even have succeeded
in surmounting at once their liberties and religion, had
he conducted his schemes with common prudence and
discretion. Openly to declare to the Parliament, so
early in his reign, his intention to dispense with the tests,
struck an universal alarm thro' the nation; infused ter∣ror
into the church, which had hitherto been the chief
support of Monarchy; and even disgusted the army, by
whose means alone he could now propose to govern.
The former horror against popery was revived by pole∣mical
books and sermons; and in every dispute the
victory seemed to be gained by the protestant divines,
who were heard with more favourable ears, and who
conducted the controversy with more learning and elo∣quence.
But another incident happened at this time,
which tended extremely to excite the animosity of the
nation against the catholic communion.</P>
<P>LEWIS the fourteenth, after having long harrassed
and molested the Protestants, at last revoked entirely the
edict of Nantz; which had been enacted by Harry the
fourth for securing them the exercise of their religion;
which had been declared irrevocable; and which, du∣ring
the experience of near a century, had been at∣tended
with no sensible inconvenience. All the ini∣quities,
inseparable from persecution, were exercised
against those unhappy religionists; who became obsti∣nate
in proportion to the oppressions which they suf∣fered,
and either covered under a feigned conversion a
more violent abhorrence to the catholic communion, or
sought among foreign nations for that liberty, of which
they were bereaved in their native country. Above
half a million of the most useful and industrious subjects
deserted France; and exported, together with immense
sums of money, those arts and manufactures, which had
chiefly tended to enrich that kingdom. They propagated
every where the most tragical accounts of the tyranny,
<PB N="236" REF="294"/>
exercised against them, and revived among the Prote∣stants
all those sentiments of the bloody and persecuting
spirit of popery, to which so many incidents in all ages
had given too much foundation. Near fifty thousand
refugees passed over into England; and all men were
disposed from their representations to foster the utmost
horror against the projects, which they apprehended to
be entertained by the King for the abolition of the pro∣testant
religion. When a Prince of so much humanity
and of such signal prudence as Lewis could be engaged,
by the bigotry of his religion alone, without any pro∣vocation,
to embrace such sanguinary and impolitic
measures; what might be dreaded, they asked, from
James, who was so much inferior in these virtues, and
who had already been irritated by such obstinate and vio∣lent
opposition? In vain did the King affect to throw
the highest blame on the persecutions of France: In
vain did he afford the most real protection and assistance
to the distressed Hugonots. All these symptoms of to∣leration
were regarded as fallacious; opposite to the
avowed principles of his sect, and belied by the severe
administration, which he himself had exercised against
the Nonconformists in Scotland.</P>
<P>THE smallest approach towards the introduction of
popery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1686.</NOTE> must, in the present disposition of the people,
have afforded reason of jealousy; much more so wide a
step as that of dispensing with the tests, the sole secu∣rity
which the nation, being disappointed of the exclu∣sion-bill,
found provided against those dreaded innova∣tions.
Yet was the King resolute to persevere in his
purpose; and having failed in bringing over the Par∣liament,
he made an attempt, with more success, for
establishing the dispensing power, by a verdict of his
judges. Sir Edward Hales, a new proselyte, had ac∣cepted
a commission of colonel; and directions were
<PB N="237" REF="295"/>
given to his coachman to prosecute him for the penalty
of five hundred pounds, which the law, establishing
the tests, had granted to informers. By this feigned
action, the King hoped,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dispensing power.</NOTE> both from the authority of the
decision, and the reason of the thing, to put an end to
all questions with regard to his dispensing power.</P>
<P>IT could not be expected, that the lawyers, appointed
to plead against Hales, would exert great force on that
occasion▪ But the cause was regarded with such anxiety
by the public, that it has been thoroughly discussed in se∣veral
elaborate discourses<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Particularly Sir Edward Herbert's defence in the State Trials, and Sir Robert Atkins's Enquiry concerning the dispensing power.</NOTE>; and could men divest them∣selves
of prejudice, there want not sufficient materials,
on which to form a true judgment. The claim and ex∣ercise
of the dispensing power is allowed to be very an∣tient
in England; and tho' it seems at first to have been
copied from papal usurpations, it may plainly be traced
up as high as the reign of Henry the third. In the go∣thic
governments, men were more anxious to secure
their private property than to share in the public admi∣nistration;
and provided no innovations were attempted
on their rights and possessions, the care of executing the
laws, and ensuring general safety was without jealousy
entrusted to the Sovereign. Penal statutes were com∣monly
intended to arm the Prince with more authority
for that purpose; and being in the main calculated for
promoting his influence and interest as first magistrate,
there seemed no danger in allowing him to dispense with
their execution, in such particular cases as might require
an exception or indulgence. That practice had so much
prevailed, that the Parliament itself had more than once
acknowleged this prerogative of the Crown; particu∣larly
during the reign of Henry the fifth, when they enact∣ed
the law against aliens<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 1. Hen. V. n. xv.</NOTE>, and also when they passed the
statute of provisors<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 1. Hen. V. n. xxii. It is re∣markable, however, that in the reign of Richard the second, the Parlia∣ment granted the King only a temporary power of dispensing with the sta∣tute of provisors. Rot. Parl. 15. Rich. II. n. i. A plain implication that he had not, of himself, such a prerogative. So uncertain were many of these points at that time.</NOTE>. But tho' the general tenor of the

<PB N="237" REF="297"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="238" REF="298"/>
penal statutes was such as gave the King a superior in∣terest
in their execution beyond any of his subjects; it
could not but sometimes happen in a mixed government,
that the Parliament would desire to enact laws, by which
the regal power, in some particulars, even where pri∣vate
property was not immediately concerned, might be
regulated and restrained. In the twenty-third of Henry
the sixth, a law of this kind was enacted, prohibiting
any man to serve in a county as sheriff above a year; and
a clause was inserted, by which the King was disabled
from granting a dispensation. Plain reason might have
taught, that this law, at least, should be exempted from
the King's prerogative; But as the dispensing power still
prevailed in other cases, it was soon able, aided by the
servility of the courts of judicature, even to overpower
this statute, which the legislature had evidently intended
to secure against all violation. In the reign of Henry the
seventh, the case was brought to a trial before all the
judges in the Exchequer-chamber; and it was decreed,
that, notwithstanding the strict clause abovementioned,
the King might dispense with the statute: He could
first, it was alleged, dispense with the prohibitory clause,
and then with the statute itself. This opinion of the
judges, however absurd, had ever since passed for un∣doubted
law: The practice of continuing the sheriffs had
ever prevailed: And most of the property in England had
been fixed by decisions, which juries, returned by such
sheriffs, had given in the courts of judicature. Many other
dispensations of a like nature may be produced; not only
such as took place by intervals, but such as were uniformly
continued. Thus the law was dispensed with which prohi∣bited
any man to go a judge of assize into his own county;
that which rendered all Welchmen incapable of offices in
<PB N="239" REF="299"/>
Wales; that which required every one, who received a
pardon for felony, to find sureties for his good behavi∣our.
In the second of James the first, a new consulta∣tion
of all the judges had been held in the Exchequer-chamber
upon a like question: This prerogative of the
Crown was again unanimously confirmed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Coke's Reports, seventh report.</NOTE>: And it be∣came
an established principle in English jurisprudence,
that, tho' the King could not allow of what was morally
unlawful, he could permit what was only prohibited by
positive statute. Even the jealous House of Commons,
which extorted the petition of right from Charles the
first, made no scruple, by the mouth of Glanville, their
manager, to allow of the dispensing power in its full ex∣tent<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. first edit. p. 205. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 132.</NOTE>; and in the famous trial of ship-money, Holborne,
the popular lawyer, had, freely, and in the most ex∣press
terms, made the same concession<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. v. first edit. p. 171.</NOTE>. Sir Edward
Coke, the great oracle of English law, had not only
concurred with all other lawyers in favour of this prero∣gative;
but seems even to believe it so inherent in the
Crown, that an act of Parliament itself could not abo∣lish it<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Coke's Reports, twelfth report, p. 18.</NOTE>. And he particularly observes, that no law can
impose such a disability of enjoying offices as the King
may not dispense with; because the King, from the law
of nature, has a right to the service of all his subjects.
This particular reason, as well as all the general princi∣ples,
is applicable to the question of the tests; nor can
the dangerous consequence of granting dispensations in
that case be ever received before a court of judicature.
Every prerogative of the Crown, it may be said, admits
of abuse: Should the King pardon all criminals, law
must be totally dissolved: Should he declare and continue
perpetual war against all nations, inevitable ruin must

<PB N="239" REF="301"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="240" REF="302"/>
ensue: Yet these powers are entrusted to the Sovereign;
and we must be contented, as our ancestors were, to
depend upon his prudence and discretion in the exercise
of them.</P>
<P>THO' this reasoning seems founded on such principles
as are usually admitted by lawyers, the people had en∣tertained
such violent prepossessions against the use, which
James here made of his prerogative, that he was ob∣liged,
before he brought on Hales's cause, to displace four
of the judges, Jones, Montague, Charleton and Nevil;
and even Sir Edward Herbert, the chief justice, tho' a
man of acknowleged virtue, yet because he here sup∣ported
the pretensions of the Crown, fell under a great
load of infamy. Men deemed a dispensing, to be in ef∣fect
the same with a repealing power; and they could
not conceive, that less authority was requisite to repeal
than to enact any statute. If one penal law was dis∣pensed
with, any other might undergo the same fate:
And by what principle could even the laws, which de∣fine
property, be afterwards secured from violation? The
test act had ever been conceived the great barrier of the
established religion under a popish successor: As such it
had been insisted on by the Parliament; as such granted
by the King; as such, during the debates with regard to
the exclusion, recommended by the chancellor. By
what magic, what chicane of law, is it now annihilated,
and rendered of no validity? These questions were every
where asked; and men, straitened by precedents and de∣cisions
of great authority, were reduced either to question
the antiquity of this prerogative itself, or to assert, that
even the practice of near five centuries could not be∣stow
on it sufficient authority<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Atkins, p. 21.</NOTE>. It was not considered
that the present difficulty or seeming absurdity had pro∣ceeded
from late innovations introduced into the go∣vernment.
Ever since the beginning of this century, the
<PB N="241" REF="303"/>
Parliament had, with the most laudable zeal, been ac∣quiring
powers and establishing principles, favourable to
law and liberty: The authority of the Crown had been
limited in many important particulars: And penal statutes
were often calculated to secure the constitution
against the attempts of ministers, as well as to preserve
general peace and repress crimes and immoralities. A
prerogative however, derived from very antient, and al∣most
uniform practice, the dispensing power, still re∣mained,
or was supposed to remain with the Crown;
sufficient in an instant to overturn this whole fabric,
and to throw down all the fences of the constitution. If
this prerogative; which carries, on the face of it, such
strong symptoms of an absolute authority in the Crown,
had yet, in antient times, subsisted with some degree of
liberty in the subject; this fact only proves, that scarce
any human government, much less one erected in rude
and barbarous times, is entirely consistent and uniform
in all its parts. But to expect, that the dispensing power
could, in any degree, be rendered compatible with those
accurate and regular limitations; which had of late been
established, and which the people were determined to
maintain, was a vain hope; and tho' men knew not
upon what principles they could deny that prerogative,
they saw, that, if they would preserve their laws and
constitution, there was an absolute necessity for denying,
or at least for abolishing it. The revolution alone, which
soon succeeded, happily put an end to all these disputes:
By means of it a more uniform edifice was at last erected:
The monstrous inconsistence, so visible between the an∣tient
Gothic parts of the fabric and the recent plans of
liberty, was fully corrected: And to their mutual felicity,
King and people were finally taught to know their pro∣per
limits and boundaries<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that the Convention, summoned by the Prince of Orange, did not, even when they had the making of their own terms in <HI>the Declaration of Rights,</HI> venture to condemn the dispensing power in ge∣neral, which had been uniformly exercised by the former Kings of England. They only condemned it so far, <HI>at it had been assumed and exercised of late.</HI> But in the <HI>Bill of Rights,</HI> which passed about a twelvemonth after, the Parliament took care to secure themselves more effectually against a branch of prerogative, incompatible with all legal liberty and limitations; and they excluded, in positive terms, all dispensing power in the Crown. Yet even then the House of Lords rejected that clause of the bill, which condemned the exercise of this power in former kings, and obliged the Commons to rest contented with abolishing it for the future. There needs no other proof of the irregular nature of the old English government, than the sub∣sistence of such a prerogative, always exercised and never questioned, till the acquisition of real liberty discovered, at last, the danger of it.

WHATEVER topics lawyers might find to defend
James's dispensing power, the nation thought it dange∣rous,
if not fatal, to liberty; and his resolution of ex∣ercising
it may on that account be esteemed equally
alarming, as if the power had been founded on the most
recent and most flagrant usurpation. It was hot likely,
that an authority, which had been assumed thro' so many
obstacles, would in his hands lie long idle and unem∣ployed.
Four catholic lords were brought into the privy
council, Powis, Arundel, Bellasis, and Dover. Hali∣fax,
finding, that notwithstanding all his past merits,
he possessed no real credit or authority, became very re∣fractory
in his opposition; and his office of privy seal
was given to Arundel. The King was open, as well
as zealous, in the desire of making converts; and men
plainly saw, that the only way to acquire his affection
and confidence was by a sacrifice of their religion. Sun∣derland,
some time after, scrupled not to gain favour at
this price. Rochester, the treasurer, tho' the King's
brother-in-law, yet, because he refused to give this in∣stance
of complaisance, was turned out of his office:
The Treasury was put in commission, and Bellasis was
placed at the head of it. All the courtiers were dis∣gusted,
even such as had little regard to religion. The
<PB N="243" REF="307"/>
dishonour, as well as distrust, attending renegades, made
most men resolve, at all hazards, to adhere to their an∣tient
faith.</P>
<P>IN SCOTLAND,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Scotland.</NOTE> James's zeal for proselytism was more
successful. The earls of Murray, Perth, and Melfort
were brought over to the Court religion; and the two
latter noblemen made use of a very courtly reason for
their conversion: They pretended, that the papers, found
in the late King's cabinet, had opened their eyes, and
had convinced them, of the preference due to the Catho∣lic
religion. Queensberry, who discovered not the same
complaisance, fell into total disgrace, notwithstanding
his former services, and the unlimited sacrifices, which
he had made to the measures of the Court. These
merits could not even ensure him of safety against the
vengeance, to which he stood exposed. His rival, Perth,
who had been ready to sink under his superior interest,
now acquired the ascendant; and all the complaints,
exhibited against him, were totally obliterated. His faith,
according to a saying of Halifax, had made him whole.</P>
<P>BUT it was in Ireland chiefly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Ireland.</NOTE> that the mask was wholly
taken off; and that the King thought himself at liberty
to proceed to the full extent of his zeal, and his vio∣lence.
The duke of Ormond was recalled; and tho'
the primate and lord Granard, two protestants, still pos∣sessed
the authority of justices, the whole power was
lodged in the hands of Talbot, the general, soon efter
created earl of Tyrconnel; a man, who, from the blind∣ness
of his prejudices and fury of his temper, was trans∣ported
with the most immeasurable ardour for the Ca∣tholic
cause. After the suppression of Monmouth's re∣bellion,
orders were given by Tyrconnel to disarm all
the protestants, on pretence of securing the public peace,
and keeping their arms in a few magazines for the use of
the militia. Next, the army was new-modelled; and
great numbers of officers were dismissed, because it was
<PB N="244" REF="308"/>
pretended, that they or their fathers had served under
Cromwel and the Republic. The injustice was not
confined to them. Near three hundred officers more
were afterwards broke, tho' many of them had pur∣chased
their commissions: About four or five thousand
private soldiers, because they were Protestants, were dis∣missed;
and being stripped even of their regimentals,
were turned out to starve in the streets. While these
violences were carrying on, Clarendon, who had been
named lord lieutenant, came over; but he quickly found,
that, as he had refused to give the King the desired
pledge of fidelity, by changing his religion, he pos∣sessed
no credit or authority. He was even a kind of
prisoner in the hands of Tyrconnel; and as he gave all
opposition in. his power to the precipitant measures of
the Catholics, he was soon after recalled, and Tyr∣connel
substituted in his place. The unhappy Prote∣stants
now saw all the legal authority, as well as the
military force, transferred into the hands of their in∣veterate
enemies; inflamed with hereditary hatred, and
stimulated by every motive, which either the passion for
power, property, or religion could inspire. Even the
barbarous banditti were let loose to prey on them in their
present defenceless condition. A renewal of the antient
massacres was apprehended; and great multitudes, struck
with the best grounded terror, deserted the kingdom,
and infused into the English nation a dread of those
violences, to which, after some time, they might justly,
from the prevalence of the Catholics, think themselves
exposed.</P>
<P>ALL judicious persons of the Catholic communion were
disgusted with these violent measures, and could easily
foresee the consequences. But James was entirely go∣verned
by the rash counsels of the Queen and of his
confessor, father Peters, a jesuit, whom he soon after
created a privy counsellor. He thought too that as he
<PB N="245" REF="309"/>
was now in the decline of life, it was necessary for him, by
hasty steps, to carry his designs into execution; lest the
succession of the princess of Orange should overturn all
his projects. In vain did Arundel, Powis, and Bellasis
remonstrate, and suggest more moderate and cautious
measures. These men had seen and felt, during the
prosecution of the plot, the extreme antipathy which the
nation bore to popery; and though some subsequent in∣cidents
had seemingly allayed that spirit, they knew, that
the settled habits of the people were still the same, and
that the smallest incident was sufficient to renew the fo∣rmer
animosity. A very moderate indulgence therefore to
their religion would have satisfied them; and all attempts
to acquire power, much more to procure a change of the
national faith, they deemed dangerous and destructive.</P>
<P>ON the first broaching of the popish plot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breach be∣twixt the King and the church.</NOTE> the Church
of England had concurred with the same violence and
credulity as the rest of the nation, in the prosecution of
it; But dreading afterwards the prevalence of republican
and presbyterian principles, they had been engaged to
support the measures of the court; and to their assistance
James had chiefly owed his succession to the crown.
Finding that all these services were forgot, and that the
Catholic religion was the King's sole darling, the church
had commenced an opposition to court-measures; and
popery was now acknowledged the more immediate danger.
In order to prevent inflammatory sermons on this popu∣lar
subject, James revived some directions to preachers
which had been promulgated by the late King, in the
beginning of his reign, when no design against the na∣tional
religion was yet formed, or at least apprehended.
But in the present delicate and interesting situation of the
church, there was little reason to expect, that orders,
founded on no legal authority, would be rigidly obeyed
by preachers, who saw no security to themselves but in
preserving the confidence and regard of the people. In∣stead
<PB N="246" REF="310"/>
of avoiding controversy, according to the King's ad∣monition,
the preachers every where declaimed against
popery; and among the rest, Dr. Sharpe, a clergyman
of London, particularly distinguished himself, and af∣fected
to throw great contempt on those who had been
induced to change their religion by such pitiful argu∣ments
as the Romish missionaries could suggest. This
topic, being supposed to rcflect on the King, gave great
offence at court; and positive orders were issued to the
bishop of London, his diocesan, immediately to suspend
Sharpe, till his Majesty's pleasure should be farther
known. The prelate replied, that he could not possibly
obey these commands, and that he was not empowered,
in such a summary manner, to inflict any punishment
even upon the greatest delinquent. But neither these
obvious reasons, nor the most dutiful submissions, both
of the prelate and of Sharpe himself, could appease the
court. The King was determined to proceed with the
utmost violence in this cause. The bishop himself he re∣solved
to punish for disobedience to his commands; and
the expedient which he employed for that purpose, was
of a nature at once the most illegal and most alarming.</P>
<P>AMONG all the engines of authority formerly employed
by the Crown, none had been more dangerous or even
destructive to liberty, than the court of high com∣mission,
which, together with the star-chamber, had
been abolished in the reign of Charles I. by act of Parlia∣ment;
in which a clause was also inserted, prohibiting
the erection, in all future times, of that court or any of
a like nature. But the law was deemed by James no
obstacle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Court of ec∣clesiastical commission.</NOTE> and an ecclesiastical commission, was anew is∣sued,
by which seven<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">The persons named were the archbishop of Canterbury, Sancroft; the bishop of Durham, Crew; of Rochester, Sprat; the earl of Rochester Sunderland, chancellor Jefferies, and lord chief justice Herbert. The archbishop refused to act, and the bishop of Chester was substituted in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> place.</NOTE> commissioners were vested with
<PB N="247" REF="311"/>
full and unlimited authority over the whole church of
England. On this court were bestowed the same inqui∣sitorial
powers, possessed by the former court of high
commission: They might proceed upon bare suspicion;
and the better to set the law at defiance, it was expressly
inserted in their patent itself, that they were to exercise
their jurisdiction, notwithstanding any law or statute to
the contrary. The King's design to subdue the church
was now sufficiently known; and had he been able to
establish the authority of this new-erected court, his suc∣cess
was infallible. A more sensible blow could not be
given both to national liberty and religion; and happily
the contest could not be tried in a cause more iniquitous
and unpopular than that against Sharpe and the bishop of
London.</P>
<P>THE prelate was cited before the commissioners. After
denying the legality of the court, after claiming the privi∣lege
of all Christian bishops to be tried by the metro∣politan
and his suffragans; he pleaded in his own defence,
that as he was obliged, if he had suspended Sharpe, to act
in the capacity of a judge, he could not, consistent either
With law or justice, pronounce sentence without a pre∣vious
citation and trial: That he had by petition repre∣sented
this difficulty to his Majesty; and not receiving any
answer, he had reason to think, that his petition had
given entire satisfaction. That in order to shew his far∣ther
deference, he had advised Sharpe to preach no more,
till he had justified his conduct to the King; an advice,
which, coming from a superior, was equivalent to a com∣mand,
and had accordingly met with the proper obedi∣ence:
That he had thus in his apprehension conformed
himself to his Majesty's pleasure; but if he should still be
found wanting to his duty in any particular, he was now
contented to crave pardon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentence against the bishop of London.</NOTE> and to make reparation. All
this submission. both in Sharpe and the prelate, had no
effect; The King was determined to have an example:
<PB N="248" REF="312"/>
Orders were accordingly sent to the commissioners to
proceed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1687.</NOTE> And by a majority of votes the bishop, as well
as the doctor, was suspended.</P>
<P>ALMOST the whole of this short reign consists of at∣tempts
always imprudent, often illegal, and sometimes
both, against whatever was most loved and revered by
the nation: Even such schemes of the King's as might
be laudable in themselves, were so disgraced with these
intentions, that they serve only to aggravate the charge
against him. James was become a great patron of tol∣eration,
and an enemy to all those persecuting laws, which,
from the influence of the church, had been enacted both
against the Dissenters and Catholics.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penal laws suspended.</NOTE> Not contented
with granting dispensations, to particular persons he as∣sumed
a power of issuing a declaration of general indul∣gence,
and of suspending at once all the penal statutes,
by which a conformity was required to the established re∣ligion.
This was a strain of authority, it must be con∣fessed,
quite inconsistent with law and a limited con∣stitution;
but was supported by many strong precedents
in the history of England. Even after the principles of
liberty were become more prevalent, and began to be
well understood, the late King had oftner than once,
and without giving much umbrage, exerted this dange∣rous
power: He had in 1662 suspended the execution of
a law, which regulated carriages: During the two
Dutch wars, he had twice suspended the act of navi∣gation:
And the Commons in 1666, being resolved,
contrary to the King's judgment, to enact that iniquitous
law against Irish cattle, found it necessary, in order to
obviate the exercise of this prerogative, which they de∣sired
not at that time entirely to deny or abrogate, to

<P>THO' the former authority of the King was great in
civil affairs, it was still greater in ecclesiastical; and the
whole despotic power: of the popes was often, believed, in
<PB N="249" REF="313"/>
virtue of the supremacy, to be devolved to the crown.
The last parliament of Charles the first, by depriving the
King and convocation of the power of framing canons
without consent of Parliament, had somewhat diminished
the supposed extent of the supremacy; but still very con∣siderable
remains of it, at least very important claims,
were preserved, and were occasionally made use of by the
Sovereign. In 1662, Charles, pleading both the rights
of his supremacy and his suspending power, had granted
a general indulgence or toleration; and in 1672 he re∣newed
the same edict: Tho' the remonstran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of his
Parliament obliged him, on both occasions, to retract;
and in the last instance, the triumph of law over prero∣gative
was deemed very great and memorable. In general,
we may remark, where the exercise of the suspending
power was agreeable and useful, the power itself was
little questioned: Where the exercise was thought liable
to exceptions, men not only opposed it, but proceeded
to deny altogether the legality of the prerogative on
which it was founded.</P>
<P>JAMES, much more imprudent, head-strong, and ar∣bitrary
than his brother, issued anew a proclamation,
suspending all the penal laws in ecclesiastical affairs, and
granting a general liberty of conscience to all his subjects.
He was not deterred by the consideration, that this
scheme of indulgence was already blasted by two fruit∣less
attempts; and that in such a government as that of
England, it was not sufficient that a prerogative be ap∣proved
of by some lawyers and antiquarians: If it was
condemned by the general voice of the nation, and yet
was still exerted, the victory over national liberty was
equally signal as if obtained by the most flagrant injustice
and usurpation. These two considerations indeed would
rather serve to recommend this project to James; who
deemed himself superior in vigour and activity to his
brother, and who probably thought, that his people en∣joyed
<PB N="250" REF="314"/>
no liberties, but by his royal concession and indul∣gence.</P>
<P>IN order to procure a better reception for his edict of
toleration, the King, finding himself opposed by the
church, began to pay great court to the Dissenters; and
he imagined, that, by playing one party against another,
he would easily obtain the victory over both; a refined
policy which it much exceeded his capacity to conduct.
His intention was so obvious, that it was impossible for
him ever to gain the sincere confidence and regard of the
Nonconformists. They knew, that the genius of their
religion was diametrically opposite to that of the Catho∣lics,
the sole object of the King's affection. They were
sensible, that both the violence of his temper, and the
maxims of his religion, were repugnant to the principles
of toleration. They had seen, that on his first accession
to the Crown, as well as during his brother's reign, he
had courted the church at their expence; and it was
not till after his dangerous schemes were rejected by the
prelates, that he had recourse to the Nonconformists.
All his favours, therefore, must, to every man of judg∣ment
among the sectaries, have appeared most insidious:
Yet such was the pleasure reaped from present ease, such
the animosity of the dissenters against the church, who
had so long subjected them to the rigours of persecution,
that they every where expressed the most entire duty to
the King and compliance with his measures; and could
not forbear rejoicing extremely in the present depression
of their enemies.</P>
<P>BUT had the Dissenters been ever so much inclined to
shut their eyes with regard to the King's intentions, the
manner of conducting his scheme in Scotland was suffi∣cient
to discover the secret. The King first applied to the
Scots Parliament, and desired an indulgence for the Ca∣tholics
alone, without comprehending the Presbyterians:
But that assembly, though more disposed than even the
<PB N="251" REF="315"/>
Parliament of England, to sacrifice their civil liberties,
resolved likewise to adhere pertinaciously to their religion;
and they now rejected for the first time the King's ap∣plication.
James therefore found himself obliged to ex∣ert
his prerogative; and he thought it prudent to interest
a party of his subjects, besides the Catholics, in sup∣porting
this act of authority. To the great surprize of
the harrassed and persecuted Presbyterians, they heard the
principles of toleration every where extolled, and found
that permission was granted to attend conventicles; an
offence, which, even during this reign, had been de∣clared
no less than a capital crime. The King's decla∣ration,
however, of indulgence contained articles, sufficient
to depress their joy. As if Popery were already
predominant, he declared, that he never would use
force or <HI>invincible necessity</HI> against any man on account
of his perswasion or the protestant religion;” A pro∣mise
surely of toleration given to the Protestants with
great precaution, and admitting a considerable latitude
for persecution and violence. It is likewise remarkable,
that the King declared in express terms, that he had
thought fit, by his sovereign authority, prerogative
royal, and <HI>absolute</HI> power, which all his subjects were
to obey <HI>without reserve,</HI> to grant this royal toleration.”
The dangerous designs of other Princes are to be col∣lected
by a comparison of their several actions, by a dis∣covery
of their more secret councils: But so blinded
was James with zeal, so transported with his imperious
temper, that even his proclamations and public edicts
contain expressions, which, without any farther enquiry,
may suffice to his condemnation.</P>
<P>THE English well knew, that the King, by the con∣stitution
of their government, thought himself intitled,
as indeed he was, to as ample authority in his southern,
as in his northern kingdom; and therefore, tho' the de∣claration
of indulgence published for England was more
<PB N="250" REF="316"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="251" REF="317"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="252" REF="318"/>
cautiously worded, they could not but be alarmed by
the arbitrary treatment, to which their neighbours were
exposed. I is even remarkable, that the English de∣claration
contained clauses of a strange import. The
King there promised, that he would maintain his loving
subjects in all their properties and possessions, as well of
church and abbey lands as of any other. Men
thought, that, if the full establishment of popery was
not at hand, this promise was quite superfluous; and
they concluded, that the King was so replete with joy
on the prospect of that glorious event, that he could not,
even for a moment, refrain himself from expressing it.</P>
<P>But what afforded the most alarming prospect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Iceland.</NOTE> was
the violent, and precipitant conduct of affairs in Ireland.
Tyrconnel was now vested with full authority; and car∣ried
over with him as chancellor one Fitton, a man who
was taken from a jail, and who had been convicted of
forgery and other crimes, but who compensated for all
his enormities by a headlong zeal for the Catholic reli∣gion.
He was even heard to say from the bench, that
the Protestants were all rogues, and that there was not
one among forty thousand who was not a traitor, a re∣bel,
and a villain. The whole strain of the administra∣tion
was suitable to such sentiments. The Catholics
were put in possession of the council table, of the courts
of judicature, of the bench of justices. In order to
make them masters of the Parliament, the same violence
was exercised that had been practised in England. The
charters of Dublin and of all the corporations were re∣called;
and new charters were granted, subjecting the
corporations to the absolute will of the Sovereign. The
Protestant freemen were expelled, Catholics introduced,
and the latter sect, as they always were the majority in
number, were now invested with the whole power of
the kingdom. The act of settlement was the only ob∣stacle
to their enjoying the whole property; and Tyr∣connel
<PB N="253" REF="319"/>
had formed a scheme for calling a Parliament, in
order to reverse that act, and empower the King to be∣stow
all the lands of Ireland on his catholic subjects.
But in this scheme he met with opposition from the mo∣derate
Catholics in the King's council. Lord Bellasis
went even so far as to affirm with an oath, “that that fel∣low
in Ireland was fool and madam enough to ruin ten
kingdoms.” The decay of trade, from the desertion
of the Protestants, was represented; the sinking of the
tevenue; the alarm communicated to England: And by
these considerations the King's resolutions were for some
time suspended; tho' it was easy to foresee, from the
usual tenor of his conduct, which side would at last pre∣ponderate.</P>
<P>BUT the King was not contented with discovering in
his own kingdoms the imprudence of his conduct: He
was resolved, that all Europe should be witness of it.
He publickly sent the earl of Castelmaine ambassador ex∣traordinary
to Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Embassy to Rome.</NOTE> in order to express his obeisance to
the Pope, and to reconcile his kingdoms to the catholic
communion. Never man, who came on so important
an errand, met with so many neglects and even affronts,
as Castelmaine; The Pope, instead of being pleased
with this forward step, concluded, that a scheme, con∣ducted
with such indiscretion, could never possibly be
successful. And as he was engaged in a violent quarrel
with the French monarch, a quarrel which interested
him much more than the conversion of England, he bore
little regard to James, whom he believed too closely
united with his capital enemy.</P>
<P>THE only proof of complaisance, which the King re∣ceived
from his Holiness, was his sending a nuncio into
England, in return for the embassy. By act of Parlia∣ment
any communication with the Pope was declared
high treason: Yet so little regard did the King pay to the
laws, that he gave the nuncio a public and solemn re∣ception
<PB N="254" REF="320"/>
at Windsor. The duke of Somerset, one of the
lords of the bed-chamber, because he refused to assist at
this ceremony, was dismissed from his employments.
The nuncio resided openly in London during all this
reign. Four catholic bishops were publickly consecrated
in the King's chapel, and sent out, under the title of
vicars apostolical, to exercise the episcopal function in
their respective dioceses. Their pastoral letters, directed
to the lay Catholics of England, were printed and dis∣persed
by the express allowance and permission of the
King. The regular clergy of that communion appeared
at Court in the habits of their order; and some of them
were so indiscreet as to boast, that, in a little time, they
hoped to walk in procession thro' the capital.</P>
<P>WHILE the King shocked in the most open manner
all the principles and prejudices of his protestant sub∣jects,
he could not sometimes but be sensible, that he
stood in need of their assistance for the execution of his
designs. He had himself, by virtue of his prerogative,
suspended the penal laws, and dispensed with the test;
but he would gladly have obtained the sanction of Par∣liament
to these acts of power and he knew, that,
without this authority, his edicts alone would never af∣ford
sufficient security to the Catholics. He had em∣ployed,
therefore, with the members of Parliament
many private conferences, which were then called <HI>clo∣setings;</HI>
and he used every expedient of reasons, menaces,
and promises to break their obstinacy in this particular.
Finding all his efforts fruitless, he had dissolved the Par∣liament,
and was resolved to call a new one, from whom he
expected more complaisance and submission. By the
practice of annuling the charters, the King was become
master of all the corporations, and could at his pleasure
change every where the whole magistracy. The church
party, therefore, by whom the Crown had been hitherto
so remarkably supported, and to whom the King visibly
<PB N="255" REF="321"/>
owed his own succession, were deprived of all authority;
and Dissenters first in London, and afterwards in every
other town, were substituted in their place. Not con∣tented
with this violent and dangerous innovation, cer∣tain
regulators were appointed to examine the qualifica∣tions
of electors; and directions were given them to ex∣clued
all such as adhered to the test and penal statutes<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The elections in some places, particularly in York, were transferred from the people to the magistrates, who, by the new charter, were all named by the Crown. Sir John Reresby's Memoirs, p. 272. This was in reality nothing different from the King's naming the members. The same act of authority had been employed in all the burroughs of Scot∣land.</NOTE>.
Queries to this purpose were openly proposed in all pla∣ces,
in order to try the sentiments of men, and enable
the King to judge of the proceedings of the future Par∣liament.
The power of the Crown was at this time so
great; the revenue, managed by James's frugality, so
considerable and independant; that if he had embraced
any national party, he had been ensured of infallible
success, and might have carried his authority to what
extent he pleased. But the Catholics, to whom he had
entirely devoted himself, were not the hundredth part of
the people. Even the protestant Nonconformists, whom
he so much courted, were litttle more than the twen∣tieth;
and what Was worse, reposed very little confidence
in the unnatural alliance contracted with the Catholics,
and in the principles of toleration, which, contrary to
their usual practice in all ages, seemed at present to be
adopted by that sect. The King therefore, findnig little
hopes of success, protracted the election of a Parliament,
and proceeded still in the exercise of his illegal and arbi∣trary
authority.</P>
<P>THE whole power in Ireland had been committed to
the Catholics. In Scotland, all the ministers, whom
the King chiefly trusted, were converts to that religion.
Every great office in England, civil and military, was
<PB N="256" REF="322"/>
gradually transferred from the Protestants. Rochester
and Clarendon, the King's brothers-in-law, tho' they
had been ever faithful to his interests, could not, by all
their services, attone for their adherence to the national
religion; and had been dismissed from their employments.
The prostitute Jefferies himself, tho' he had sacrificed ho∣nour
and justice and humanity to the Court; yet because
he refused also to give tip his religion, was very fast de∣clining
in favour and interest. Nothing now remained
but to open the door in the church and universities to
the intrusion of the Catholics; It was not long before
the King made this violent effort; and by constraining
the prelacy and established church to seek protection
in the principles of liberty, he at last left himself entirely
without friends and adherents.</P>
<P>FATHER Francis, a Benedictine, was recommended
by the King's mandate to the university of Cambridge
for the degree of master of arts; and as it was usual for
the university to confer that degree on persons eminent
for learning, without regard to their religion; and as
they had even admitted lately the secretary to the am∣bassador
of Morocco; the King on that account thought
himself the better intitled to compliance. But the uni∣versity
considered, that there was a great difference be∣tween
a compliment bestowed on foreigners, and degrees
which gave a title to vote in all the elections and decrees
of the university; and which, if conferred on the Ca∣tholics,
would infallibly in time render that sect entirely
superior. They therefore refused to obey the King's
mandate, and were cited to appear before the court of
ecclesiastical commission. The vice chancellor was sus∣pended;
but as the university chose a man of spirit to
succeed him, the King thought proper for the present to
drop his pretensions.</P>
<P>THE attempt upon the university of Oxford was pro∣secuted
with more inflexible obstinacy, and was at∣tended
<PB N="257" REF="323"/>
with more important consequences. This uni∣versity
had lately in their famous decree made a solemn
profession of passive obedience; and the Court probably
expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt upon Mag∣dalen co∣lege.</NOTE> that they would show their sincerity, when
their turn came to practise that doctrine; which, tho',
if carried to the utmost extent, it be contrary both to
reason and to nature, is apt to meet with the most ef∣factual
opposition from the latter principle. The presi∣dent
of Magdalen colllege, one of the richest foundations
in Europe, dying about this time, a mandate was sent in
favour of Farmer, a new convert, but one, who, be∣sides
his being a Catholic, had not in other respects the
qualities required by the statutes for enjoying that of∣fice.
The fellows of the college made very submissive
applications to the King for recalling his mandate; but
before they received an answer, the day came, on which, by
their statutes, they were required to proceed to an election.
They therefore chose Dr. Hough, a man of virtue, as
well as of the firmness and vigour requisite for maintain∣ing
his own rights and those of the university. In order
to punish the college for this contumacy, as it was called,
an inferior ecclesiastical commission was sent down, and
the new president and the fellows were cited before that
court. So little regard had been paid to any other con∣sideration
besides religion, that Farmer, on enquiry,
was found guilty of the lowest and most scandalous
vices; insomuch that even the ecclesiastical commission∣ers
were ashamed to insist on his election. A new man∣date,
therefore, was issued in favour of Parker, lately
created bishop of Oxford, a man of a prostitute cha∣racter,
but who, like Farmer, attoned for all his vices
by his avowed willingness to embrace the catholic reli∣gion.
The college represented, that all presidents had
ever been appointed by election, and there were even
few instances of the King's interposing by his recom∣mendation
in favour of any candidate; that having al∣ready
<PB N="258" REF="324"/>
made a regular election of a president, they could
not, during his life, deprive him of his office, and sub∣stitute
any other in his place; that, even if there was a
vacancy, Parker, by the statutes of their founder, could
not be chosen; that they had all of them bound them∣selves
by oath to observe these statutes, and never on any
account to accept of a dispensation; and that the col∣lege
had at all times so much distinguished itself by its
loyalty, that nothing but the most invincible necessity
could now oblige them to oppose his Majesty's inclinations.
All these reasons availed them nothing. The president
and all the fellows, except two who complied, were ex∣pelled
the college; and Parker was put in possession of
the office. This act of violence, of all those committed
during the reign of James, is perhaps the most illegal
and arbitrary. When the dispensing power was the most
strenuously insisted on by court lawyers, it had still been
allowed, that the statutes, which regard private property
could not legally be infringed by that prerogative: Yet
ill this instance it appeared, that even these were not
now secure from invasion. The privileges of a college
are attacked: Men are illegally dispossessed of their pro∣perty,
for adhering to their duty, to their oaths, and to
their religion: The fountains of the church are at∣tempted
to be poysoned; nor would it be long, it was
concluded, ere all ecclesiastical, as well as civil prefer∣ments,
would be bestowed on such as, negligent of ho∣nour,
virtue, and sincerity, basely sacrificed their faith to
the reigning superstition. Such were the general senti∣ments;
and as the universities have an intimate con∣nexion
with the ecclesiastical establishments, and mightily
interest all those who have there received their education,
this arbitrary proceeding begot an universal discontent
against the King's administration.</P>
<P>THE next measure of the Court was an insult still
more open on the ecclesiastics, and rendered the breach
<PB N="259" REF="325"/>
between the King and that powerful body fatal, as well as
incurable. It is strange, that James, when he felt,
from the sentiments of his own heart, what a mighty
influence religious zeal had over him, should yet be so
infatuated as never once to suspect, that it might pos∣sibly
have a proportional authority over his subjects.
Could he have profited from repeated experience, he
had seen instances enough of their strong aversion to∣wards
that communion, which, from a violent, im∣perious
disposition, he was determined, by every pos∣sible
expedient, to introduce into his kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE King published a second declaration of indul∣gence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1688.</NOTE>
almost in the same terms with the former; and he
subjoined an order, that, immediately after divine service
it should be read by the clergy in all the churches. As
they were known universally to disapprove of the
use made of the suspending power, this clause, they
thought, could be meant only as an insult upon them;
and they were sensible, that, by their compliance, they
would expose themselves, both to public contempt, on
account of their tame behaviour, and to public hatred,
by their indirectly patronizing so obnoxious a preroga∣tive<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">When Charles dissolved his last Parliament, he set forth a declaration giving his reasons for that measure, and this declaration the clergy had been ordered to read to the people after divine service. These orders were agreeable to their party prejudices, and they willingly submitted to them. The contrary was now the case.</NOTE>.
They were determined, therefore, almost universally
to preserve the regard of the people; their only
protection, while the laws were become of so little va∣lidity,
and while the Court was so deeply engaged in op∣posite
interests. In order to encourage them in this re∣solution,
six prelates, to wit, Lloyde bishop of St.
Asaph, Ken of Bath and Wells, Turner of Ely, Lake
of Chichester, White of Peterborow, and Trelawney
<PB N="260" REF="326"/>
of Bristol, met privately with the primate, and concerted
the form of a petition to the King. They there repre∣sented
in few words, that, tho' possessed of the highest
sense of loyalty, a virtue of which the church of En∣gland
had given such eminent testimonies; tho' desirous
of affording ease in a legal way to all Protestant Dis∣senters;
yet because the declaration of indulgence was
founded on a prerogative, formerly declared illegal by
Parliament, they could not, in prudence, honour, or
conscience, so far make themselves parties as the distri∣bution
of it all over the kingdom would be interpreted
to amount to. They therefore besought the King, that
he would not insist upon their reading that declaration<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The words of the petition were. That the great averseness found in themselves to their distributing and publishing in all their churches your Majesty's late declaration for liberty of conscience, proceeds neither from any want of duty and obedience to your Majesty (our holy mother, the church of England, being both in her principles and her constant practice unquestionably loyal, and having to her great honour been more than once publicly acknowleged to be so by your gracious Majesty) nor yet from any want of tenderness to Dissenters, in relation to whom we are willing to come to such a temper as shall be thought fit, when the matter shall be considered and settled in Parliament and Convocation. But among many other con∣siderations, from this especially, because that declaration is founded upon such a dispensing power as hath been osten declared illegal in Parliament, and particularly in the years 1662 and 1672, and in the beginning of your Majesty's reign, and is a matter of so great moment and consequence to the whole nation both in church, and state, that your petitioners cannot in prudence, honour, or conscience so far make themselves parties to it as a distribution of it all over the nation and the solemn publication of it once and again, even in God's house, and in the time of divine service, must amount to in common and reasonable construction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King was incapable, not only of yielding to the
greatest opposition, but of allowing the slightest and
most respectful contradiction to pass unpunished. He
immediately embraced a resolution (and his resolutions, when once embraced, were inflexible) of punishing the
bishops, for a petition so popular in its matter, and so
prudent and cautious in the expression. As the petition
<PB N="261" REF="327"/>
was delivered him in private, he summoned them before
the council; and there questioned them whether they
would acknowledge it. The bishops saw his intention,
and seemed long desirous to decline answering; But be∣ing
pushed by the chancellor, they at last owned the pe∣tition.
On their refusal to give bail, an order was im∣mediately
drawn for their commitment to the Tower;
and the Crown lawyers received directions to prosecute
them for the seditious libel, which, it was pretended,
they had composed and uttered.</P>
<P>THE people were already aware of the danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imprison∣ment,</NOTE> to
which the prelates were exposed; and were raised to the
highest pitch of anxiety and attention with regard to
the issue of this extraordinary affair. But when they be∣held
these fathers of the church brought from court
under the custody of a guard, when they saw them em∣barked
in vessels on the river, and conveyed towards the
Tower, all their affection for liberty, all their zeal for
religion, blazed up at once; and they flew to behold
this affecting and animating spectacle. The whole shore
was covered with crowds of prostrate spectators, who at
once implored the blessing of those holy, pastors, and ad∣dressed
their petitions towards Heaven for protection du∣ring
this extreme danger, to which their country and
their religion stood exposed. Even the soldiers, seized
with the contagion of the same spirit, flung themselves
on their knees before the distressed prelates, and craved
the benediction of those criminals, whom they were ap∣pointed
to guard. Some persons ran into the water,
that they might participate more nearly of those blessings,
which the prelates were distributing on all around them.
The bishops themselves, during this triumphant suffering,
augmented the general favour, by the most lowly sub∣missive
deportment; and they still exhorted the people
to fear God, honour the King, and maintain their
loyalty; expressions more animating than the most in∣flammatory
<PB N="260" REF="328"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="261" REF="329"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="262" REF="330"/>
speeches. And no sooner had they entered
the precincts of the Tower than they hurried to chapel,
in order to return thanks for those afflictions, which
Heaven, in defence of its holy cause, had thought them
worthy to endure.</P>
<P>THEIR passage,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ial</NOTE> when conducted to their trial, was,
if possible, attended with greater crowds of anxious
spectators. All men saw the dangerous crisis, to which
affairs were reduced, and were sensible, that the issue
could not possibly be put on a more favourable cause,
than that in which the King had so imprudently en∣gaged.
Twenty-nine temporal peers (for the other pre∣lates
stood aloof) attended the prisoners to Westminster
Hall; and such crowds of gentry followed the procession,
that scarce any room was left for the populace to enter.
The lawyers for the bishops were Sir Robert Sawyer,
Sir Francis Pemberton, Pollexfen, Treby, and Sommers.
No cause, even during the prosecution of the popish plot,
was ever heard with so much zeal and attention. The
popular torrent, which, of itself, ran fierce and strong,
was now farther irritated by the opposition of the go∣vernment.</P>
<P>THE council for the bishops pleaded, that the law al∣lowed
subjects, if they thought themselves aggrieved in
any particular, to address themselves by petition to the
King, provided they kept within certain bounds, which
the same law prescribed them, and which in the present
petition the prelates had rigidly observed: That an active
obedience in cases, which were contrary to conscience,
was never pretended to be due to government; and law
was allowed to be the great measure of the compliance
and submission of subjects: That when any person found
commands to be imposed upon him, which he could not
obey, it was more respectful to offer to the Prince his
reasons for refusal, than to remain in an obstinate and
refractory silence: That it was no breach of duty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>subjects,
<PB N="263" REF="331"/>
even tho' not expresly called upon, to discover
their sense of public measures, in which every one had
so intimate a concern: That the bishops in the present
case were called upon, and must either express their ap∣probation
by compliance, or their disapprobation by pe∣tition:
That it could be no sedition to deny the prero∣gative
of suspending the laws; because there really was
no such prerogative, nor ever could be, in a legal and
limited government: That even if this prerogative was
real, it had yet been frequently disputed before the whole
nation, both in Westminster-hall, and in both houses of
Parliament; and no one had ever dreamed of punishing the
denial of it as criminal; That the prelates, instead of
making an appeal to the people, had applied in pri∣vate
to his Majesty, and had even delivered their pe∣tition
so fecretly, that except by the confession, extorted
from them before the council, it was sound impossible to
prove them the authors: And that tho' the petition was
afterwards printed and dispersed, it was not somuch as
attempted to be proved, that they had the least knowlege
of that publication.</P>
<P>THESE arguments were convincing in themselves, and
were heard with a very favourable disposition by the au∣dience.
Even some of the judges, tho' their seats were
held during pleasure, declared themselves in favour of
the prisoners. The jury however, from what cause is
not certainly known, took several hours to deliberate,
and kept, during so long a time, the people in the most
anxious expectation. But when the wished for verdict,
<HI>not guilty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of June. and acquit∣tal of the bishops.</NOTE> was at last pronounced, the intelligence was
echoed thro' the hall, was conveyed to the crowds with∣out,
was carried into the city, and was propagated with
infinite joy throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P>EVER since Monmouth's rebellion, the King had,
every summer, encamped his army on Hounslow heath,
that he might both improve their discipline, and by so
unusual a spectacle over-awe the mutinous people. A
<PB N="264" REF="332"/>
popish chapel was openly erected in the midst of the
camp, and great pains taken, tho' in vain, to bring over
the soldiers to that communion. The few converts,
whom the priests had made, were treated with such con∣tempt
and ignominy, as deterred every one from follow∣ing
the example. Even the Irish officers, whom the
King introduced into the army, served rather, from the
aversion borne them, to weaken his interest among them.
It happened, that the very day, on which the bishops'
trial was finished, the King had reviewed the troops, and
had retired into lord Feversham, the general's, tent;
when he was surprized to hear a great uproar in the
camp, attended with the most extravagant symptoms of
tumultuary joy. He suddenly enquired the cause, and
was told by Feversham, “It was nothing but the re∣joicing
of the soldiers for the acquittal of the bishops.
Do you call that nothing?” replied he, “but so much
the worse for them.”</P>
<P>THE King was still determined to rush forwards in
the same course, where he was already, by his precipitate
career, so fatally advanced. Tho' he knew, that every
order of men, except a handful of Catholics, were en∣raged
at his past measures, and still more terrified with
the future prospect; tho' he saw that the same discon∣tents
had reached the army, his sole ressource during the
general disaffection: Yet was he incapable of changing
his measures, or even of remitting his violence in the
prosecution of them. He struck out two of the judges,
Powel and Holloway, who had appeared to favour the
bishops: He issued orders to prosecute all those clergy∣men,
who had not read his declaration; that is, the
whole church of England, two hundred excepted: He
sent a mandate to the new fellows, whom he had ob∣truded
on Magdalen-College, to elect for president, in
the room of Parker, lately deceased, one Gifford, a
doctor of the Sorbonne, and titular bishop of Madura:
And he is even said to have nominated the same person
<PB N="265" REF="333"/>
to the see of Oxford. So great an infatuation is perhaps
an object of compassion rather than of anger: And is really
surprising in a man, who, in other respects, was not
deficient in sense and accomplishments.</P>
<P>A FEW days before the acquittal of the bishops, an
event happened, which, in the King's sentiments, much
overballanced all the mortifications,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of June. Birth of the Prince of Wales.</NOTE> which he had re∣ceived
on that occasion. The Queen was brought to
bed of a son, who was baptized by the name of James.
This blessing was impatiently longed for, not only by
the King and Queen, but by all the zealous Catholics
both abroad and at home. They saw, that the King
was past middle age; and that on his death the succession
must devolve on the Prince and Princess of Orange, two
zealous Protestants, who would soon replace every thing
on the antient foundations. Vows therefore were of∣fered
at every shrine for a male successor: Pilgrimages
were undertaken, particularly one to Loretto, by the
dutchess of Modena; and success was chiefly attributed
to that pious journey. But in proportion as this event
was agreeable to the Catholics, it encreased the disgust
of the Protestants, by depriving them of that agreeable,
tho' somewhat distant prospect, in which at present they
flattered themselves. Calumny even went so far as to
ascribe to the King the design of imposing on the world
a supposititious child, who might be educated in his
principles, and after his death support the catholic reli∣gion
in his dominions. The nation almost universally
believed him capable, from bigotry, of committing any
crime; as they had seen, that, from like motives, he
was guilty of every imprudence: And the affections of
nature, they thought, would be easily sacrificed to the
superior motives of propagating a catholic and orthodox
faith. The present occasion was not the first, when
that calumny had been propagated. In the year 1682,
the Queen, then Dutchess of Yorke, had been preg∣nant;

and rumours were spread, that an imposture
would, at that time, be put upon the nation: But hap∣pily,
the infant proved a female, and thereby spared the par∣ty
all the trouble of supporting their improbable fiction<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">This story is taken notice of in a weekly paper, the Observator, pub∣lished at that very time, 23d of August, 1682.

<P>WHILE every motive, civil and religious, concurred
to alienate from the King every rank and denomi∣nation
of men, it might be expected, that his throne
would, without delay, fall to pieces by its own weight:
<PB N="267" REF="337"/>
But such is the influence of established government; so
averse are men from beginning hazardous enterprizes;
that had not the nation received succour from abroad, af∣fairs
might long have remained in their present delicate
situation, and the King might at last have prevailed in
his rash, and ill concerted projects.</P>
<P>THE Prince of Orange,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the Prince of Orange.</NOTE> ever sines his marriage with
the Lady Mary, had maintained a very prudent conduct;
agreeable to that sound understanding, with which he
was so eminently endowed. He made it a maxim to
concern himself very little in English affairs, and never by
any measure to disgust any of the factions, or give um∣brage
to the Prince, who filled the throne. His natural
inclination, as well as his interest, led him to employ
himself with assiduous industry in the affairs of the con∣tinent,
and to oppose the grandeur of the French Mo∣narch,
against whom he had long, both from personal
and political considerations, conceived the most violent
animosity. By this conduct, he gratified the prejudices
the whole English nation: But as he crossed the in∣clinations
of Charles, who sought peace by compliance
With France, he had much declined in the favour and af∣fections
of that monarch.</P>
<P>JAMES on his accession found it so much his interest
to live in good terms with the heir apparent, that he
showed the Prince some demonstrations of friendship;
and the Prince on his part was not wanting in every in∣stance
of duty and regard towards the King. On Mon∣mouth's
invasion, he immediately dispatched over six re∣giments
of British troops, which were in the Dutch ser∣vice:
and he offered to take the command of the King's
forces against the rebels. However much he might dis∣approve
the maxims of the King's administration, he
ever kept a total silence on that subject, and gave no
countenance to those discontents, which were propagated
with such industry throughout the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="338"/>
IT was from the application of James himself, that
the Prince first openly took any part in English affairs.
Notwithstanding the lofty ideas, which the King had
entertained of his own prerogative, he found, that the
edicts, emitted from it, still wanted much of the au∣thority
of laws, and that the continuance of them might
in the issue become dangerous, both to himself and to
the Catholics, whom he desired to favour. An act of
Parliament alone could ensure the indulgence or tolera∣tion,
which he had laboured to establish; and he hoped,
that, if the Prince would declare in favour of that scheme,
the members, who had hitherto resisted all his own ap∣plications,
would at last be prevailed with to adopt it.
The consent, therefore, of the Prince to the repeal of
the penal statutes and of the test was strongly sollicited
by the King; and in order to engage him to agree to that
measure, hopes were given<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 711. D'Avaux, 15th of April, 1688.</NOTE>, that England would second
him in all those enterprizes, which his active and extensive
genius had with such success formed on the continent.</P>
<P>THE Prince knew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He forms a league against France.</NOTE> that the Emperor and the King of
Spain were enraged by the repeated injuries, which they
had suffered from the ambition of Lewis, and still more,
by the frequent insults, which his pride had made them
undergo. He was apprized of the influence of these
Monarchs over the Catholic Princes of the empire: He
had himself obtained a great authority with the prote∣stant
Princes: And he formed a project of uniting Eu∣rope
in one general league against the encroachments of
France, which seemed so nearly to threaten the liberty
and independance of all its neighbours.</P>
<P>No characters are more incompatible than those of a
conqueror and a persecutor; and Lewis soon found, that,
besides his weakening France by the banishment of so
many useful subjects, the refugees had enflamed all the
protestant nations against him, and had raised him ene∣mies,
<PB N="269" REF="339"/>
who, in defence of their religion as well as li∣berty,
were obstinately resolved to oppose his progress.
The city of Amsterdam and other towns in Holland,
which had before fallen into a dependance on France:
being terrified with the accounts, which they every mo∣ment
received, of the furious persecutions against the Hu∣gonots,
had now dropped all private factions, and had en∣tered
into an entire confidence with the Prince of Orange<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, 24th of July, 1681; 10th of June, 15th of October, 11th of November, 1688; vol. iv. p. 30.</NOTE>.
The protestant. Princes of the empire had formed a se∣parate
league at Magdebourg for the defence of their re∣ligion.
The English were anew enraged at the blind
bigotry of their Sovereign, and were disposed to embrace
the most desperate resolutions against him. From a view
of the state of Europe during this period, it appears, that
Lewis, besides sullying an illustrious reign, had wan∣tonly
by this persecution raised invincible barriers to his
arms, which otherwise it had been very difficult, if not
impossible, to resist.</P>
<P>THE Prince of Orange knew how to avail himself of
all these advantages. By his intrigues and influence a
league was formed at Ausbourg, where the whole em∣pire
united in its defence against the French Monarch.
Spain and Holland became parties in the alliance. The
accession of Savoy was afterwards obtained. Sweden
and Denmark seemed to favour the fame cause. But
tho' these numerous states composed the greater part of
Europe, the league was still deemed imperfect and un∣equal
to its end; so long as England maintained that
neutrality, in which she had hitherto persevered.</P>
<P>JAMES, tho' more prone to bigotry, was more sen∣sible
to his own and to national honour than his brother;
and had he not been confined by the former motive, he
would have maintained with more spirit the interest and
independance of his kingdoms. When a prospect, there∣fore,
<PB N="270" REF="340"/>
appeared of promoting his religious schemes by
opposing the progress of France, he was not averse to
that measure; and he gave his son-in-law room to hope,
that, by concurring with his views in England, he
might prevail with him to second those projects, which
the Prince was so ambitious of promoting.</P>
<P>A MORE tempting offer could not be made to a person
of his enterprizing character:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Refuses to concur with the King.</NOTE> But the objections to that
measure, upon deliberation, appeared to him insuperable.
The King, he observed, had incurred the most violent
hatred of his own subjects: Great apprehensions were
entertained of his designs: The only ressource, which
the nation saw, was in the future succession of the Prince
and Princess: Should he concur in those dreaded mea∣sures,
he would draw on himself all the odium, under
which the King laboured: The nation might even re∣fuse
to bear the expence of alliances, which would in
that case become so suspicious: And he might himself
incur danger of losing a succession, which was awaiting
him, and which the egregious indiscretion of the King
seemed even to give him hopes of reaping before it
should devolve to him by the course of nature. The
Prince, therefore, would go no farther than to promise
his consent to the repeal of the penal statutes, by which
the Nonconformists as well as Catholics were exposed
to punishment. The test he esteemed a security abso∣lutely
requisite for the establishied religion.</P>
<P>THE King did not remain satisfied with a single trial.
There was one Stuart, a Scots lawyer, who had been
banished for tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asonable practices; bnt who had after∣wards
obtained a pardon, and had been recalled. By the
King's directions, Stuart wrote several letters to pension∣ary
Fagel, with whom he had contracted an acquaint∣ance
in Holland; and besides urging all the motives for
an unlimited toleration, he desired, that his reasons
should, in the King's name, be communicated to the
<PB N="271" REF="341"/>
Prince and Princess of Orange. Fagel during a long
time made no reply; b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t finding, that his silence was
construed into an assent, he at last expressed his own sen∣timent
and that of their Highnesses. the said, that it
was their fixed opinion, that no man, merely because
he differed from the established faith, should ever, while he
remained a peaceable subject, be exposed to any punish∣ment
or even molestation: That the Prince and Princess
of Orange gave heartily their consent for repealing le∣gally
all the penal statutes, as well those enabled against
the Catholics as against the Protestant Nonconformists;
and would concur with the King in any measure for that
purpose. That the test was not to be considered as a
penalty inflicted on the professors of any religion, but
as a security provided for the established worship. That
it was no punishment on men to be excluded from pub∣lic
offices, and to live peaceably on their own revenues
or industry. That even in the United Provinces, which
were so often cited as models of toleration, tho' all sects
were admitted, yet civil offices were only enjoyed by the
professors of the established religion. That military com∣mands,
indeed, were sometimes bestowed on Catholics;
but as they were conferred with great precaution, and
still lay under the controul of the magistrate, they could
give no just reason for umbrage. And that their High∣nesses,
however desirous of gratifying the King, and of
endeavouring, by every means, to render his reign
peaceable and happy, could not agree to any measure, which
would expose their religion to such imminent danger.</P>
<P>WHEN this letter was published, as it soon was, it
inspired great courage into the Protestants of all denomi∣nations,
and served to keep them united in their oppo∣sition
to the encroachments of the Catholics. On the
other hand, the King, who was not contented with a
simple toleration for his own religion, but was resolved,
that it should enjoy great credit, if not an, absolute su∣periority
<PB N="272" REF="342"/>
was extremely disgusted, and took every oc∣casion
to express his displeasure, as well against the Prince
of Orange as the United Provinces. He gave the Al∣gerine
pyrates, who preyed on the Dutch, a reception in his
harbours, and liberty to dirspose of their prizes.
He revived some complaints of the East India company
with regard to the affair of Bantam<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, 21st of January, 1687.</NOTE>. He required the
six British regiments in the Dutch service to be sent over.
He began to put his navy in a formidable condition.
And from all his movements, the Hollanders entertained
apprehensions, that he sought only an occasion and pre∣tence
for making war upon them.</P>
<P>THE Prince in his turn resolved to push affairs with
more vigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolves to oppose the King.</NOTE> and to preserve all the English Protestants
in his interests, as well as maintain them firm in their
present union against the Catholics. He knew, that the
men of education in England were, marry of them, re∣tained
in their religion more by honour than by prin∣ciple
<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Burnet.</NOTE>; and that, tho' every one was ashamed to be
the first proselyte, yet, if the example was once set by
some eminent-persons, interest would every day make
considerable conversions to a communion, which was so
zealousy encouraged by the Sovereign. Dyvkelt there∣fore
was sent over as envoy to England; and the Prince
gave him instructions, besides publickly remonstrating
with the King on his conduct both at home and abroad,
to apply in his name, after a proper manner, to every
sect and denomination. To the church party he sent
assurances of favour and regard, and protested, that his
education in Holland had no wise prejudiced him against
episcopal government. The Nonconformists he ex∣horted
not to be deceived by the fallacious caresses of a
popish Court, but to wait patiently, till, in the maturity
of time, laws, enacted by Protestants, should give them
<PB N="273" REF="343"/>
that toleration, which, with so much reason, they had
long claimed and demanded. Dykvelt executed his
commission with such dexterity, that all orders of men
cast their eyes towards Holland, and expected thence a
deliverance from those dangers, with which their reli∣gion
and liberty were so nearly threatened.</P>
<P>MANY of the most considerable persons, both in
church and state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is applied to by the Eng∣lish.</NOTE> made secret applications to Dykvelt,
and thro' him to the Prince of Orange. Admiral Her∣bert
too, tho' a man of great expence, and seemingly of
little religion, had thrown up his employments, and
retired to the Hague, where he assured the Prince of the
disaffection of the seamen, by whom that admiral was
extremely beloved. Admiral Russel, cousin german to
the unfortunate lord of that name, passed frequently
between England and Holland, and kept the communi∣cation
open with all the great men of the protestant party.
Henry Sidney, brother to Algernon, and uncle to the
earl of Sunderland, came over under pretence of drink∣ing
the waters at Spaw, and conveyed still stronger as∣surances
of an universal combination against the mea∣sures
of the King. Lord Dumblaine, son to the earl
of Danby, being master of a frigate, made several voy∣ages
to Holland, and carried from many of the nobility
tenders of duty, and even considerable sums of money<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, 14th and 24th of September, 8th and 15th of October, 1688.</NOTE>,
to the Prince of Orange.</P>
<P>THERE remained, however, some reasons, which
retained all parties in awe, and kept them from breaking
out into immediate violence. The Prince, on the one
hand, was afraid of hazarding, by his invasion, an in∣heritance,
which the laws ensured to the Princess; and
the English Protestants, on the other hand, from the
prospect of her succession, still entertained hopes of ob∣taining
at last a peaceable and a safe redress of all their
grievances. But when the Prince of Wales was born,
<PB N="274" REF="344"/>
both the Prince and the English nation were reduced to
despair, and saw no ressource but in a confederacy for
their mutual interests. And thus the event which the
King had so long made the object of his most ardent
prayers, and from which he expected the firm establish∣ment
of his throne, proved the immediate cause of his
ruin and downfall.</P>
<P>ZUYLESTEIN, who had been sent over to congratulate
the King on the birth of his son, brought the Prince
formal invitations from most of the great men in Eng∣land,
to assist them, by his arms, in the recovery of
their laws and liberty. The bishop of London, the
earls of Danby, Nottingham, Devonshire, Dorset, the
duke of Norfolk, the marquess of Hallifax, the lords
Lovelace, Delamare, Paulet, Eland, Mr. Hambden,
Powle, Lester, besides many eminent citizens of Lon∣don;
all these persons, tho' of the most opposite parties,
concurred in their applications to the Prince. The
Whigs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coalition of parties.</NOTE> situable to their antient principles of liberty,
which had led them to attempt the exclusion bill, easily
agreed to oppose a King, whose conduct had verified
whatever his worst enemies had prognosticated of his
succession. The Tories and the church, party, finding
their past services forgotten, their rights invaded, their
religion threatened, agreed to drop for the present all
over-strained doctrines of submission, and attend to the
great and powerful dictates of nature. The Noncon∣formists,
dreading the caresses of known and inveterate
enemies, deemed the offers of toleration more secure
from a Prince educated in those principles, and accus∣tomed
to that practice. And thus all faction was for a
time laid asleep in England; and rival parties, forget∣ting
their animosity, had secretly concurred in a design
of opposing their unhappy and misguided Sovereign.
The earl of Shrewsbury, who had acquired great popu∣larity
by deserting, at this time, the Catholic religion
<PB N="275" REF="345"/>
in which he had been educated, left his regiment, mort∣gaged
his estate for forty thousand pounds, and made a
tender of his sword and purse to the Prince of Orange.
Lord Wharton, notwithstanding his age and infirmities,
had taken a journey for the same purpose. Lord Mor∣daunt
was at the Hague, and pushed on the enterprize
with that ardent and courageous spirit, for which he
was so eminent. Even Sunderland, the King's favou∣rite
minister, is believed to have entered into a corre∣spondence
with the Prince; and at the expence of
his own honour and his master's interest, to have se∣cretly
embraced a cause, which he foresaw, was likely
soon to predominate<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux was always of that opinion. See his Negotiations 6th and 20th of May, 18th, 27th of September, 22d of November, 1688. But it is pretended, that that lord always suggested moderate councils to the King; a sure proof, if true, of his fidelity. See his defence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Prince was easily determined to yield to the ap∣plications
of the English, and to embrace the defence
of a nation, which, during its present fears and distresses,
regarded him as its sole protector. The great object of
his ambition was to be placed at the head of a confede∣rate
army, and by his valour to avenge the injuries,
which himself, his country, and his allies had sustained
from the haughty Lewis. But while England remained
under the present government, he despaired of ever form∣ing
a league, which would be able, with any probability
of success, to make opposition against that powerful
Monarch. The tyes of affinity could not be supposed
to have great influence over a person of the Prince's
rank and temper; much more, as he knew, that they
were at first unwillingly contracted by the King, and
had never since been cultivated by any essential favours
of good offices. Or should any reproach remain upon
him for violating the duties of private life; the glory of
delivering oppressed nations would, he hoped, be able,
<PB N="276" REF="346"/>
in the eyes of all reasonable men, to make ample com∣pensation.
He could not well expect, on the commence∣ment
of his enterprize, that it would lead him to mount
the throne of England: But he undoubtely foresaw,
that its success would establish his authority in that
Kingdom. And so egregious was James's temerity, that
there was no advantage, so great or obvious, which that
Prince's indiscretion might not afford his enemies.</P>
<P>THE Prince of Orange, thro'out his whole life,
was peculiarly happy in the situations, in which he
was placed. He saved his own country from ruin, he
restored the liberties of these kingdoms, he supported
the general independency of Europe. And thus, tho'
his virtue, it is confessed, be not the purest, which we
meet with in history, it will be difficult to find any per∣son,
whose actions and conduct have contributed more
eminently to the general interests of society and of
mankind.</P>
<P>THE time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's prepara∣tions.</NOTE> when the Prince entered on his enterprize,
was very well chosen; as the people were then in the
highest ferment, on account of the insult, which the
imprisonment and trial of the bishops had put upon the
church, and indeed upon all the Protestants of the na∣tion.
His method of conducting the preparations was
no less wise and politic. Under other pretences he had
beforehand made considerable augmentations to the
Dutch fleet; and the ships were at that time lying in
harbour. Some additional troops were also levied; and
sums of money, raised for other purposes, were di∣verted
by the Prince to the use of this expedition. The
States had given him their entire confidence; and partly
from terror of the exorbitant power of France, partly
from disgust at some restraints laid on their commerce
in that kingdom, were sensible how necessary success in
this enterprize was become to their domestic happiness
and security. Many of the neighbouring Princes re∣garded
<PB N="277" REF="347"/>
him as their guardian and protector, and were
guided by him in all their councils. He held confe∣rences
with Castanaga, governor of the Spanish Ne∣therlands,
with the Electors of Bradenburgh and Saxony,
with the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, with the whole
house of Lunenbourg. It was agreed, that these Princes
should replace the troops employed against England, and
should protect the United Provinces during the absence
of the Prince of Orange. Their forces were already on
their march for that purpose: A considerable encamp∣ment
of the Dutch army was formed near Nimeguen:
Every place was in motion; and tho' the roots of this
conspiracy reached from one end of Europe to the other,
so secret were the Prince's councils, so fortunate was
the disposition of affairs, that he still could cover his
preparations under other pretences; and little suspicion
was entertained of his real intentions.</P>
<P>THE King of France, menaced by the league of
Augsbourg, had resolved to strike the first blow against
the allies; and having sought a quarrel with the Em∣peror
and the Elector Palatine, he had invaded Ger∣many
with a great army, and had laid siege to Philips∣bourg.
The Elector of Cologne, who was also Bishop
of Liege and Munster, and whose territories almost en∣tirely
surrounded the United Provinces, had died about
this time; and the candidates for that rich succession
were Prince Clement of Bavaria, supported by the
house of Austria, and the cardinal of Furstemberg, a
prelate entirely dependant on France. The pope, who
favoured the allies, was able to throw the ballance be∣tween
the parties, and Prince Clement was chosen; a
circmstance which contributed extremely to the security
of the States. But as the cardinal kept possession of many
of the fortresses, and had applied to France for succours,
the neighbouring territories were all in motion; and by
this means the preparations of the Dutch and their allies
<PB N="276" REF="348"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="277" REF="349"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="278" REF="350"/>
seemed intended merely for their own defence against the
enterprizes of Lewis.</P>
<P>ALL the artifices, however, of the Prince could not en∣tirely
conceal his real intentions from the sagacity of the
French court. D'Avaux, Lewis's envoy at the Hague,
had been able, by a comparison of circumstances, to trace
the purposes of the preparations in Holland; and he in∣stantly
informed his master of the discovery. Lewis con∣veyed
the intelligence to James; and accompanied the
information with a very important offer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offers of France to the King.</NOTE> He was willing
to join a squadron of French ships to the English fleet;
and to send over any number of troops, which James
should judge requisite for his security. When this pro∣posal
was rejected, he again offered to raise the siege of
Philipsbourg, to march his army into the Netherlands,
and by the terror of his arms to detain the Dutch forces
In their own country. This proposal met with no better
reception.</P>
<P>JAMES was not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejected.</NOTE> as yet, entirely convinced, that his
son in law intended an invasion upon England. Fully
perswaded, himself, of the sacredness of his own autho∣rity,
he fancied, that a like belief had made deep im∣pression
on his subjects; and notwithstanding the strong
symptoms of discontent which broke out, such an uni∣versal
combination in rebellion appeared to him no wise
credible. His army, in which he trusted, and which he
had considerably augmented, would be easily able, he
thought, to repel foreign force, and to suppress any se∣dition
among the populace. A small number of French
troops, joined to these, might tend only to breed discon∣tent;
and afford them a pretence for mutinying against
foreigners, so much feared and hated by the nation. A
great body of auxiliaries might indeed secure him both
against an invasion from Holland, and against the rebellion
of his own subjects; but would be able afterwards to re∣duce
him to total dependance, and render his authority
<PB N="279" REF="351"/>
entirely precarious. Even the French invasion of the
Low Countries might be attended with very dangerous
consquences; and would suffice, in these jealous times,
to revive the old suspicion of a combination against Hol∣land,
and against the protestant religion; a suspicion,
which had already produced such discontents in England.
These were the views suggested by Sunderland, and it must
be confessed, that the reasons, on which they were
founded, were sufficiently plausible; as indeed the situ∣ation,
to which the King had reduced himself, was, to
the last degree, delicate and perplexing.</P>
<P>STILL Lewis was unwilling to abandon a friend and
ally, whose interest he regarded as closely connected with
his own. By the suggestion of Skelton, the King's mi∣nister
at Paris, orders were sent to D'Avaux to remon∣strate
with the States in Lewis's name against those pre∣parations,
which they were making to invade England.
The strict amity, said the French minister, which subsists
between the two monarchs will make Lewis regard every
attempt against his ally as an act of hostility against him∣self.
This remonstrance had a very bad effect, and put
the States in a flame. What is this alliance, they asked,
between France and England, which has been so care∣fully
concealed from us? Is it of the same nature with
the former; meant for our destruction and for the ex∣tirpation
of the protestant religion? If so, it is high time
for us to provide for our own defence, and to anticipate
those projects, which are forming against us.</P>
<P>EVEN James was displeased with this officious step taken
by Lewis for his service. He was not reduced, he said,
to the condition of the cardinal of Furstemberg, and ob∣liged
to seek the protection of France. He recalled Skel∣ton,
and threw him into the Tower for his rash con∣duct.
He solemnly disavowed D'Avaux's memorial;
and protested, that no alliance subsisted between him and
Lewis, but what was public and known to all the world.
The States, however, still affected to appear incredulous
<PB N="280" REF="352"/>
on that article<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">That there really was no new alliance formed betwixt France and Eng∣land appears both from Sunderland's apology, and from D'Avaux's negotia∣tions, lately published: See Vol. IV. p. 18. Eng. Translation. 27th of September, 1687. 16th of March, 6th of May, 10th of August, 2d, 23d, and 24th of September, 5th and 7th of October, 11th of November, 1688.</NOTE>; and the English, extremely prepossessed
against their Sovereign, firmly believed, that a project
was concerted with Lewis for their entire subjection.
Portsmouth, it was said, was to be put into the hands
of that ambitious monarch: England was to be filled
with French and Irish troops: And every man, who was
not willing to embrace the Romish superstition, was by
these bigotted Princes devoted to sudden destruction.</P>
<P>THESE suggestions were every where spread abroad,
and tended extremely to augment the discontents, of
which both the fleet and army, as well as the people,
betrayed every day the most evident symptoms. The
fleet had begun to mutiny; because Stricland, the ad∣miral,
a Roman Catholic, introduced the mass aboard
his ship, and dismissed the protestant chaplain. It
was with some difficulty they could be appeased; and
they still persisted in declaring, that they would not
fight against the Dutch, whom they called friends and
brethren; but would willingly engage the French, whom
they regarded as national enemies. The King had in∣tended
to augment his army with Irish rercuits, and he
resolved to try the experiment on the regiment of
the Duke of Berwic, his natural son; but Beaumont,
the lieutenant-colonel, refused to admit them; and to
this opposition five captains steadily adhered. They were
all cashiered; and had not the discontents of the army
on this occasion become very apparent, it was resolved
to have tried and punished those officers for mutiny.</P>
<P>THE King made a trial of the dispositions of his army,
in a manner still more undisguised. Finding opposition
from all the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the king∣dom,
he resolved to appeal to the military, who, if
unanimous, were able alone to serve all his purposes, and
<PB N="281" REF="353"/>
enforce universal obedience. His intention was to en∣gage
all the regiments, one after another, to give their
consent to the repeal of the test and penal statutes; and
accordingly, the major of Litchfield's drew out the bat∣tallion
before the King, and told them, that they were
required either to enter into his Majesty's views, in these
particulars, or to lay down their arms. The King was
surprised to find, that, two captains and a few popish
soldiers excepted, the whole battallion immediately em∣braced
the latter part of the alternative. For some time,
he remained speechless; but having recovered from his
astonishment, he commanded them to take up their arms;
adding with a sullen, discontented air, “That for the
future, he would not do them the honour to ask their
advice.”</P>
<P>WHILE the King was dismayed with these symptoms
of general disaffection, he received a letter from the mar∣quess
of Albeville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of Sep∣tember.</NOTE> his minister at the Hague; which in∣formed
him with certainty that he was soon to look for a
powerful invasion from Holland, and that Pensionary
Fagel had at last acknowledged, that the scope of all
the Dutch preparations was to transport forces into Eng∣land.
Tho' James could reasonably expect no other in∣telligence,
he was astonished at the news: He grew pale,
and the letter dropped from his hand: His eyes were now
opened, and he found himself on the brink of a frightful
precipice, which his delusions had hitherto concealed
from him. His ministers and councellors, equally asto∣nished
with himself, saw no ressource but in a sudden and
precipitant retraction of all those fatal measures, by which
he had created himself so many enemies, foreign and do∣mestic.
He paid court to the Dutch, and offered to enter
into any alliance with them for common security:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King retracts his measures.</NOTE> He
replaced in all the counties the deputy-lieutenants and
justices, who had been deprived of their commissions for
their adherence to the test and the penal laws: He re∣stored
<PB N="282" REF="354"/>
the charters of London and of all the corporations:
He annulled the court of ecclesiastical commission: He
took off the bishop of London's suspension: He re-in∣stated
the expelled president and fellows of Magdalen
college: And he was even reduced to caress those bishops,
whom he had so lately prosecuted and insulted. All these
measures were regarded as symptoms of fear, not of re∣pentance.
The bishops, instead of promising succour, or
suggesting comfort, recapitulated to him all the instances
of his mal-administration, and advised him thencefor∣wards
to follow more salutary council. And as intel∣ligence
arrived of a great disaster, which had befallen the
Dutch fleet, it is commonly believed, that the King re∣called,
for some time, the concessions, which he had or∣dered
to be made to Magdalen college; A very bad sign
of his sincerity in his other concessions. Nay, so pre∣valent
were his unfortunate prepossessions, that, amidst
all his present distresses, he could not forbear, at the bap∣tism
of the young Prince, from appointing the Pope to
be one of the godfathers.</P>
<P>THE report, that a supposititious child was to be im∣posed
on the nation, had been widely spread, and greedily
received, before the Prince of Wales's birth: But the
King, who, without seeming to take notice of the mat∣ter,
might easily have quashed that ridiculous rumour,
had, from an ill-timed haughtiness, totally neglected it.
He disdained, he said, to satisfy those, who could deem
him capable of so base and villainous an action. Finding
that the calumny still gained ground, and had made deep
impression on his subjects, he was now obliged to submit
to the mortifying office of ascertaining the reality of that
birth. Tho' no particular attention had been beforehand
given to ensure proof, the evidence, both of the Queen's
pregnancy and delivery, was rendered indisputable; and
so much the more, as no argument or proof of any im∣portance,
nothing but popular rumour and surmize, could
be thrown into the opposite scale.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="355"/>
MEANWHILE, the Prince of Orange's declaration was
dispersed over the kingdom, and met with universal ap∣probation.
All the grievances of the nation were there
enumerated:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's declaration.</NOTE> The dispensing and suspending power;
the court of ecclesiastical commission; the filling all offices
with Catholics, and the raising a jesuit to be a privy-coun∣sellor;
the open encouragement given to popery, by
building every where churches, colleges, seminaries for
that sect; the displacing of judges, if they refused to
give sentence according to orders received from Court;
the annulling the charters of all the corporations, and the
subjecting the election of members to arbitrary will and
pleasure; the treating petitions, even the most modest,
and from persons of the highest rank, as criminal and se∣ditious;
the committing the whole authority of Ireland,
civil and military, into the hands of Papists; the assuming
an absolute power over the religion and laws of Scot∣land,
and openly exacting in that kingdom an obedience
without reserve; and the violent presumptions against the
legitimacy of the Prince of Wales. In order to redress
all these grievances, the Prince said, that he intended to
come over into England with an armed force, which
might protect him from the King's evil counsellors:
And that his sole aim was to have a legal and free Parlia∣ment
summoned, who might provide for the safety and
liberty of the nation, as well as examine the proofs of
the Prince of Wales's legitimacy. No one, he added,
could entertain such hard thoughts of him as to imagine,
that he had formed other designs than to procure the full
and lasting settlement of the religion, liberty, and pro∣perty
of the subject. The force, which he intended to
bring with him, was totally disproportioned to any views
of conquest; and it were absurd to suspect, that so many
persons of high rank, both in church and state, would
have given him so many solemn invitations for such a
pernicious purpose. Tho' the English ministers, terri∣fied
<PB N="282" REF="356"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="283" REF="357"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="284" REF="358"/>
with his enterprize, had pretended to redress some
of the grievances complained of; there still remained the
foundation of all grievances, that upon which they could
in an instant be again erected, an arbitrary and despotic
power in the Crown. And for this usurpation there was
no possible remedy, but by a full declaration of all the
rights of the subject in a free Parliament.</P>
<P>SO well concerted were the Prince's measures, that,
in three days, above four hundred transports were hired;
the army quickly fell down the rivers and canals from
Nimeguen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st of Oc∣tober.</NOTE> the artillery, arms, stores, horses were em∣barked;
and the Prince set sail from Helvoet-Sluice, with
a fleet of near five hundred vessels, and an army of above
fourteen thousand men. He first encountered a storm,
which drove him back: But his loss being soon repaired,
the fleet put to sea under the command of admiral Her∣bert,
and made sail with a fair wind towards the west of
England. The same wind detained the King's fleet in
the river, and enabled the Dutch to pass the Straits of
Dover without molestation. Both shores were covered
with multitudes of people, who, besides admiring the
grandeur of the spectacle, were held in anxious suspence
by the prospect of an enterprize, the most important,
which, during some ages, had been undertaken in Eu∣rope.
The Prince had a prosperous voyage, and landed
his army safely in Torbay on the fifth of November, the
anniversary of the gunpowder-treason.</P>
<P>THE Dutch army marched first to Exeter; and the
Prince's declaration was there published. That whole
county was so terrified with the executions, which had
ensued upon Monmouth's rebellion, that no body for se∣veral
days joined the Prince. The bishop of Exeter in a
fright fled to London, and carried to Court intelligence
of the invasion. As a reward of his zeal, he received the
archbishopric of York, which had long been kept vacant,
with an intention, as was universally believed, of bestow∣ing
<PB N="285" REF="359"/>
it on some Catholic. The first person, who joined
the Prince, was major Burrington; and he was quickly
followed by the gentry of the counties of Devon and So∣merset.
Sir Edward Seymour made proposals for an asso∣ciation,
which every one signed. By degrees, the earl
of Abington, Mr. Russel, son to the earl of Bedford,
Mr. Wharton, Godfrey, Howe came to Exeter. All
England was in commotion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">General commotion.</NOTE> Lord Delamere took arms
in Cheshire, the earl of Danby seized York, the earl of
Bath governor of Plymouth, declared for the Prince, the
earl of Devonshire made a like declaration in Derby.
The nobility and gentry of Nottingham embraced the
same cause; and every day there appeared some effect of
of that universal combination, into which the nation had
entered against the measures of the King. Even those
who took not the field against him, were able to embarrass
and confound his councils. A petition for a free Parlia∣ment
was signed by twenty-four bishops and peers of the
greatest distinction, and was presented to the King. No
one thought of opposition or resistance against the inva∣der.</P>
<P>BUT the most dangerous symptom was the disaffection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Desertion of the army.</NOTE>
which, from the general spirit of the nation, not from
any particular reason, had crept into the army. The of∣ficers
seemed all disposed to prefer the interests of their
country and of their religion before those principles of
honour and fidelity, which are commonly esteemed the
most sacred ties by men of that profession. Lord Col∣chester,
son to the earl of Rivers, was the first officer who
deserted to the prince; and he was attended by a few of
his troops. Lord Lovelace made a like effort; but was
intercepted by the militia under the duke of Beaufort,
and taken prisoner: Lord Cornbury, son to the earl of
Clarendon, was more successful. He attempted to carry
over three regiments of cavalry; and he actually brought
a considerable part of them to the Prince's quarters. Se∣veral

<PB N="286" REF="362"/>
officers of distinction informed Feversham, the ge∣neral,
that they could not in conscience fight against the
Prince of Orange.</P>
<P>LORD CHURCHHILL had been raised from the rank of
a page, and had been invested with a high command in
the army, had been created a peer, and had owed his
whole fortune to the King's bounty: Yet even this per∣son
could resolve, during the present extremity, to desert
his unhappy master, who had ever reposed entire confi∣dence
in him. He carried with him the duke of Graston,
natural son to the late King, colonel Berkeley, and some
troops of dragoons. This conduct was a signal sacrifice
to public virtue of every duty in private life; and re∣quired,
for ever after, the most upright, the most dis∣interested,
and most public spirited behaviour to render
it justifiable.</P>
<P>THE King had arrived at Salisbury, the head quarters
of his army, when he received this fatal news. That
Prince, though a severe enemy, had ever appeared a
warm, steady, and sincere friend; and he was extremely
shocked with this, as well as with many other instances
of ingratitude, to which he was now exposed. There
remained none in whom he could confide. As the whole
army had discovered symptoms of discontent, he con∣cluded
it full of treachery; and being deserted by those
whom he had most favoured and obliged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of No∣vember.</NOTE> he no longer
expected that others would hazard their lives in his ser∣vice.
During this distraction and perplexity, he em∣braced
a sudden resolution of drawing off his army, and
retiring towards London: A measure, which could only
serve to betray his fears, and provoke farther treachery.</P>
<P>BUT Churchhill had prepared a still more mortal blow
for his distrest benefactor. His lady and he had an en∣tire
ascendant over the family of Prince George of Den∣mark;
and the time now appeared seasonable for over∣whelming
the unhappy King, who was already stagger∣ing
<PB N="287" REF="363"/>
with the violent shocks, which he had received. An∣dover
was the first stage of his Majesty's retreat towards
London; and there, prince George, together with the
young duke of Ormond, Sir George Huet, and some other
persons of distinction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and of Prince George.</NOTE> deserted him in the night-time,
and retired to the Prince's camp. No sooner had this
news reached London, than the princess Anne, pretend∣ing
fear of the King's displeasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and of the Princess Anne.</NOTE> withdrew herself in
the company of the bishop of London and lady Church∣hill.
She fled to Nottingham; where the earl of Dorset
received her with great respect, and the gentry of the
county quickly formed a troop for her protection.</P>
<P>THE late King, in order to gratify the nation, had
entrusted the education of his nieces entirely to Protes∣tants;
and as these princesses were deemed the chief res∣source
of the established religion after their father's de∣fection,
great care had been taken to instill into them,
from their earliest infancy, the strongest prejudices against
popery. During the violence too of such popular currents,
as now prevailed in England, all private considerations
are commonly lost in the general passion; and the more
principle any person possesses, the more apt is he, on such
occasions, to neglect and abandon his domestic duties.
Though these causes may account for the Princess's be∣haviour,
they had no way prepared to King to expect so
astonishing an event. He burst into tears, when the first
intelligence of it was conveyed to him. Undoubtedly he
foresaw in this incident the total expiration of his royal<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's consteration.</NOTE>
authority: But the nearer and more intimate concern of
a parent laid hold of his heart; when he found himself
abandoned in his uttermost distre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s by a child, and a virtu∣ous
child, whom he had ever regarded with the most ten∣der
affection. “God help me,” cried he, in the ex∣tremity
of his agony, “my own children have forsaken
me!” It is indeed singular, that a Prince, whose chief
blame consisted in imprudences and misguided principles,
<PB N="286" REF="364"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="287" REF="365"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>

should be exposed, from religious antipathy, to such treat∣ment
as even Nero, Domitian, or the most enormous ty∣rants,
that have disgraced the records of history, never
met with from their friends and family.</P>
<P>SO violent were the prejudices, which at this time
prevailed, that this unhappy father, who had been de∣serted
by his favourite child, was believed, upon her
disappearance, to have put her to death: And it was
fortunate, that the truth was timely discovered; other∣wise
the populace, even the King's guards themselves,
might have been engaged, in revenge, to commence a
massacre of the priests and Catholics.</P>
<P>THE King's fortune now exposed him to the contempt
of his enemies; and his behaviour was not such as could
procure him the esteem of his friends and adherents.
Unable to resist the torrent, he preserved not presence of
mind in yielding to it; but seemed in this emergence as
much depressed with adversity, as he had before been
vainly elated by prosperity. He called a council of all
the peers and prelates who were in London; and fol∣lowed
their advice in issuing writs for a new Parliament,
and in sending Halifax, Nottingham, and Godolphin, as
commissioners to treat with the prince of Orange. But
these were the last acts of royal authority which he ex∣erted.
He even hearkened to imprudent council, by
which he was prompted to desert the throne, and to gra∣tify
his enemies beyond what their fondest hopes could
have promised them.</P>
<P>THE Queen, observing the fury of the people, and
knowing how much she was the object of general hatred,
was struck with the deepest terror, and began to appre∣hend
a parliamentary impeachment from which she was
told, the Queens of England were not exempted. The
popish courtiers, and above all, the priests, were aware,
that they would be the first sacrifice, and that their per∣petual
banishment, was the smallest penalty, which they
<PB N="289" REF="367"/>
must expect from national resentment. They were there∣fore
desirous of carrying the King along with them;
whose presence, they knew, would still be some resource
and protection to them in foreign countries, and whose
restoration, if it ever happened, would again re-instate
them in power and authority. The general defection of
the Protestants made the King regard the Catholics,
as his only subjects, on whose council he could rely;
and the fatal catastrophe of his father afforded them a
plausible reason for making him apprehend a like
fate. The infinite difference of circumstances was not,
during's men present distraction, sufficiently weighed.
Even after the people were inflamed by a long civil war,
the execution of Charles the first could not be deemed
a national deed: It was perpetrated by a fanatical army,
pushed on by a daring and enthusiastic leader; and the
whole kingdom had ever entertained, and did still enter∣tain,
a most violent abhorrence against that enormity.
The situation of public affairs, therefore, no more re∣sembled
what they were forty years before, than the
Prince of Orange, either in birth, character, fortune,
or connexions, could be supposed a parallel to Crom∣wel.</P>
<P>THE emmissaries of France, and among the rest, Baril∣lon,
the French ambassador, were busy about the King;
and they had entertained a very false notion, which they
instilled into him; that nothing would more certainly re∣tard
the public settlement, and beget universal confusion,
than his desertion of the kingdom. The Prince of Orange
had with good reason embraced a contrary opinion; and
he deemed it extremely difficult to find expedients for se∣curing
the nation, so long as the King kept possession of
the crown. Actuated, therefore, by this public motive,
and no less, we may well presume, by private ambition,
he was determined to use every expedient, which might
intimidate the King, and make him desert that throne,
<PB N="288" REF="368"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="289" REF="369"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="290" REF="370"/>
which he himself was alone enabled to fill. He declined
a personal conference with the king's commissioners, and
sent the earls of Clarendon and Oxford to treat with
them: The terms, which he proposed, implied almost a
present participation of the sovereignty: And he stop∣ped
not a moment the march of his army towards Lon∣don.</P>
<P>THE news which the King received from all quarters,
helped to continue the panic, into which he was fallen,
and which his enemies expected to improve to their ad∣vantage.
Colonel Copel, deputy-governor of Hull,
made himself master of that important fortress; and threw
into prison lord Langdale, the governor, a Catholic;
together with lord Montgomery, a nobleman of the same
religion. The town of Newcastle received the lord
Lumly, and declared for the Prince of Orange and a free
Parliament. The duke of Norfolk, lord lieutenant of
the county of that name, engaged it in the same measure.
The Prince's declaraion was read at Oxford by the duke
of Ormond, and was received with great applause by that
loyal University, who also made an offer of their plate to
the Prince. Every day, some person of quality or dis∣tinction,
and among the rest, the duke of Somerset,
went over to the enemy. A very violent declaration was
dispersed in the Prince's name, but not with his partici∣pation;
in which every one was commanded to seize and
punish all Papists, who, contrary to law, pretended ei∣ther
to carry arms, or exercise any act of authority. It
may not be unworthy of notice, that a merry ballad,
called Lilliballero, being at this time published in derision
of the Papists and the Irish, it was greedily received by
the people, and was universally sung by all ranks of men,
even by the King's army, who were strongly seized with
the national spirit. This incident both discovered, and
served to encrease, the general discontent of the king∣dom.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="371"/>
THE contagion of mutiny and disobedience had also
reached Scotland, whence the regular forces, contrary
to the advice of Balcarras, the treasurer, were with∣drawn,
in order to re-inforce the English army. The
marquess of Athole, together with the viscount Tarbat,
and others, finding the opportunity favourable, began to
form intrigues against Perth, the chancellor; and the
Presbyterians and other malecontents flocked from all
quarters to Edinburgh. The chancellor, apprehensive
of the consequences, found it expedient to withdraw;
and the populace, as if that event were a signal for their
insurrection, immediately rose in arms, and rifled the
popish chapel in the king's palace. All the Catholics,
even all the zealous Royalists, were obliged to conceal
themselves; and the privy council, instead of their for∣mer
submissive strains of address to the King, and violent
edicts against their fellow-subjects, now made applications
to the Prince of Orange, as the sole restorer of law and
liberty.</P>
<P>THE King every moment alarmed, more and more,
with these proofs of a general disaffection, not daring to
repose trust in any but those who were exposed to more
danger than himself, agitated by indignation towards in∣gratitude,
by disdain of infidelity, impelled by his own
fears and those of others, precipitantly embraced the re∣solution
of withdrawing to France, and he sent off be∣forehand
the Queen and the infant Prince, under the
conduct of count Lauzun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and flight. 12th o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> December.</NOTE> an old favourite of the French
Monarch. He himself disappeared in the night-time,
attended only by Sir Edward Hales, a new convert; and
made the best of his way to a ship, which waited for him
near the mouth of the river. As if this measure had
not been the most grateful to his enemies of any which he
could adopt, he had carefully concealed his intention from
all the world; and nothing could equal the surprize,
which seized the city, the court, the kingdom, upon the
<PB N="292" REF="372"/>
discovery of this strange event. Men beheld, all on a
sudden, the reins of government thrown up by the hand
which held them; and saw none, who had any right or
even pretension, to take possession of them.</P>
<P>THE more effectually to involve every thing in confu∣sion,
the King appointed not any one, who should, in
his absence, exercise any part of the administration; he
threw the great seal into the river; and he recalled all
those writs, which had been issued for the elections of
the new Parliament. It is often supposed, that the sole
motive, which impelled him to this sudden desertion,
was his reluctance to meet a free Parliament, and his re∣solution
not to submit to those terms, which his subjects
would deem requisite for the security of their liberties and
their religion. But it must be considered, that his sub∣jects
had first deserted him, and entirely lost his confi∣dence;
that he might reasonably be supposed to entertain
fears for his liberty, if not for his life; and that the con∣ditions
would not probably be moderate, which the na∣tion,
sensible of his inflexible temper, enraged with the
violation of their laws and the danger of their religion,
and foreseeing his resentment on account of their past
opposition, would, in his present circumstances, exact
from him.</P>
<P>BY this temporary dissolution of government, the po∣pulace
were now masters; and there was no disorder,
which, during their present ferment, might not be dread∣ed
from them. They rose in a tumult and destroyed all
the mass-houses. They even attacked and rifled the
houses of the Florentine envoy and Spanish ambassador,
where many of the Catholics had lodged their most valu∣able
effects. Jefferies, the chancellor, who had disguised
himself, in order to fly the kingdom, was discovered by
them, and so abused, that he died in a little time after∣wards.
Even the army, which should have suppressed
those tumults, would, it was apprehended, serve rather
<PB N="293" REF="373"/>
to encrease the general disorder. Feversham had no sooner
heard of the King's retreat, than he disbanded the troops
in the neighbourhood, and without either disarming
or paying them, let them loose to prey upon the coun∣try.</P>
<P>IN this extremity, the bishops and peers, who were
in town, being the only remaining authority of the state
(for the privy council, composed of the King's creatures,
was totally disregarded) thought proper to assemble, and
to interpose for the preservation of the community.
They chose the marquess of Halifax their speaker: They
gave directions to the mayor and aldermen for keeping
the peace of the city: They issued orders, which were
readily obeyed, to the fleet, the army, and all the gar∣risons:
And they made applications to the Prince, whose
enterprize they highly applauded, and whose success they
joyfully congratulated.</P>
<P>THE Prince on his part was not wanting to the tyde of
success, which flowed in upon him, nor backward in
assuming that authority, which the present exigency had
put into his hands. Besides the general popularity, at∣tending
his cause, a new incident made his approach to
London still more welcome. In the present trepidation
of the people, a rumour arose, either from chance or de∣sign,
that the disbanded Irish had taken arms, and had
commenced an universal massacre of all the Protestants in
England. This ridiculous belief was spread all over the
kingdom in one day; and begot every where the deepest
consternation. The alarum bells were rung; the bea∣cons
fired; men fancied that they saw at a distance the
smoke of the burning cities, and heard the groans of
those who were slaughtered in their neighbourhood. It
was surprizing, that the Catholics did not all perish, in
the rage which naturally succeeds such popular panics.</P>
<P>WHILE every one, either from principle, interest, or
animosity, turned their back on the unhappy King, who
<PB N="294" REF="374"/>
had abandoned his own cause, the unwelcome news ar∣rived,
that he had been seized by the populace at Fever∣sham,
while he was making his escape in disguise; that
he had been very much abused,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King seized at Fever∣sham.</NOTE> till he was known; but
that the gentry had then interposed and protected him,
tho' they still refused to consent to his escape. This in∣telligence
threw all parties into confusion. The Prince
sent Zuylestein with orders, that the king should ap∣proach
no nearer than Rochester; but the massage came
too late. He was already arrived in London, where the
populace, moved by compassion for his unhappy fate, and
actuated by their own levity, had received him with
shouts and acclamations.</P>
<P>DURING the King's abode at Whitehall, little atten∣tion
was payed him by the nobility or any persons of dis∣tinction.
They had, all of them, been previously dis∣gusted
on account of his blind partiality to the Catholics;
and they knew, that they were now become more crimi∣nal
in his eyes by their late public applications to the
Prince of Orange. He himself shewed not any symp∣toms
of spirit, nor discovered any intention of resuming
the reins of government, which he had once thrown
aside. His authority was now plainly expired; and as
he had exercised his power, while possessed of it, with
very precipitant and haughty councils, he relinquished
it by a despair, equally precipitant and pusillanimous.</P>
<P>NOTHING remained for the now ruling powers but to
deliberate how they should dispose of his person. Be∣sides,
that the Prince may justly be supposed to have possessed
more generosity than to think of offering violence
to an unhappy monarch, so nearly related, to him, he
knew, that nothing would so effectually promote his own
views as the King's retreat into France, a country at all
times so obnoxious to the English. It was determined,
therefore, to push him into that measure, which, of
himself, he seemed sufficiently inclined to embrace. The
<PB N="295" REF="375"/>
King having sent lord Feversham on a civil message to the
Prince, desiring a conference for an accommodation in
order to the public settlement, that nobleman was put in
arrest, under pretence of his wanting a passport: The
Dutch guards were ordered to take possession of White∣hall,
where the King then lodged, and to displace the
English: And Halifax, Shrewsbury, and Delamere,
brought a message from the Prince, which they delivered
to the King in bed after midnight, ordering him to leave
his palace next morning, and to depart for Ham, a seat
of the dutchess of Lauderdale's. He desired permission,
which was easily granted, of retiring to Rochester, a
town near the sea-coast. It was perceived, that the ar∣tifice
had taken effect; and that the king, terrified with
this harsh treatment, had renewed his former resolution of
leaving the kingdom.</P>
<P>HE lingered, however, some days at Rochester, under
the protection of a Dutch guard, and seemed desirous of
an invitation still to keep possession of the throne. He
was undoubtedly sensible, that, as he had, at first, trust∣ed
too much to his people's loyalty, and in confidence of
their submission, had offered the highest violence to their
principles and prejudices; so had he, at last, on finding
his disappointment, gone too far into the other extreme,
and had hastily supposed them void of all sense of duty or
allegiance. But observing, that the church, the nobili∣ty,
the city, the country, all concurred in neglecting
him, and leaving him to his own councils, he submitted
to his melancholy fate; and being urged by earnest let∣ters
from the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second eva∣sion.</NOTE> he privately embarked on board a
frigate which waited for him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of De∣cember.</NOTE> and he arrived safely at
Ambleteuse in Picardy, whence he hastened to St. Ger∣mains.
Lewis received him with the highest generosity,
sympathy, and regard; a conduct, which, more than
his most signal victories, contributes to the honour of
that great Monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="376"/>
THUS ended the reign of a Prince, whom, if we con∣sider
his personal character rather than his public conduct,
we may safely pronounce to have been more unfortunate
than criminal.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's character.</NOTE> He had many of those qualities, which
form a good citizen: Even some of those, which, had
they not been swallowed up in bigotry and arbitrary prin∣ciples,
serve to compose a good Sovereign. In domestic
life, his conduct was irreproachable, and is intitled to
our approbation. Severe, but open in his enmities,
steady in his councils, diligent in his schemes, brave in
his enterprizes, faithful, sincere, and honourable in his
dealings with all men: Such was the character, with
which the duke of York mounted the throne of England.
In that high station, his frugality of public money was
remarkable, his industry exemplary, his application to
naval affairs successful, his encouragement of trade ju∣dicious,
his jealousy, of national honour laudable: What
then was wanting to make him an excellent Sovereign?
A due regard and affection to the religion and constitution
of his country. Had he been possessed of this essential
quality, even his middling talents, aided by so many vir∣tues,
would have rendered his reign honourable and hap∣py.
When it was wanting, every excellency, which he
possessed, became dangerous and pernicious to his king∣doms.</P>
<P>THE sincerity of this Prince (a virtue, on which he
highly valued himself) has been much questioned in those
reiterated promises, which he made of preserving the
liberties and religion of the nation. It must be confss∣ed,
that his reign was one continued invasion of both;
yet is it known, that, to his last breath, he persisted in
asserting, that he never meant to subvert the laws, or
procure more than a toleration and an equality of privi∣leges
to his catholic subjects. This question can only affect
the personal character of the King, not our judg∣ment
of his public conduct. Tho' by a stretch of can∣dour
<PB N="297" REF="377"/>
we should admit of his sincerity in these professions,
the people were equally justifiable in their resistance of
him. So lofty was the idea, which he had entertained of
his <HI>legal</HI> authority, that it left his subjects little or no
right to liberty, but what was dependent on his sovereign
will and pleasure. And such was his zeal of proselytism,
that, whatever he might have intended, he plainly stop∣ped
not at toleration and equality: He confined all power,
encouragement, and favour to the Catholics: Converts
from interest would soon have multiplied upon him: If
not the greatest, at least the best part of the people, he
would have flattered himself, were brought over to his re∣ligion:
And he would in a little time have thought it
just, as well as pious, to bestow on it all the public es∣tablishments.
Rigours and persecutions against heretics
would speedily have followed; and thus liberty and the
protestant religion would in the issue have been totally
subverted; tho' we should not suppose, that James, on
the commencement of his reign, had seriously formed a
plan for that purpose. And on the whole, allowing this
King to have possessed good qualities and good intentions,
his conduct serves only, on that very account, as a
stronger proof, how dangerous it is to allow any Prince,
infected with that superstition, to wear the crown of these
kingdoms.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner, the courage and abilities of the
Prince of Orange, seconded by surprizing fortune, had
effected the deliverance of this; island; and with very lit∣tle
effusion of blood (for only one officer of the Dutch
army and a few private soldiers fell in an accidental skir∣mish)
had expelled from the throne a great Prince, sup∣ported
by a formidable fleet and a numerous army. Still
the more difficult task remained, and what perhaps the
Prince regarded as not the least important: The obtain∣ing
for himself that crown, which had fallen from the
head of his father-in-law. Some lawyers, intangled in
<PB N="298" REF="378"/>
the subtleties and forms of their profession, could think
of no expedient; but that the Prince should claim the
crown by right of conquest; should assume immediately
the title of Sovereign; and should call a Parliament,
which, being thus legally summoned by a King in pos∣session,
could ratify whatever had been transacted before
they assembled. But this measure, being destructive of
all principles of liberty, the only principles on which his
future throne could be established, was prudently reject∣ed
by the Prince, who, finding himself possessed of the
good will of the nation, refolved to leave them entirely to
their own guidance and direction. The peers and bishops,
to the number of near ninety, made an address, desiring
him to summon a convention by circular letters; to as∣sume,
in the mean time, the management of all public
affairs; and to concert measures for the security of Ire∣land.
At the same time, they resused reading a letter,
which the King had left in order to apologize for his
late desertion, by the violence which had been put upon
him. This step was a sufficient indication of their in∣tentions
with regard to that unhappy Monarch.</P>
<P>THE Prince, seemed still unwilling to act upon an au∣thority,
which might be deemed so imperfect: He was
desirous of obtaining a more express declaration of the
public consent. A very judicious expedient was fallen
on for that purpose. All the members, who had sat in
the House of Commons during any Parliament of Charles
the second (the only Parliaments whose election was re∣garded
as free) were invited to meet; and to them were
added The mayor, aldermen, and fifty of the common
council of the city. This was the most proper represen∣tative
of the people, which could be summoned during
the present emergence. They unanimously voted the
same address with the Lords: And the Prince, being
thus supported by all the legal authority, which could
possibly be obtained in this critical juncture, wrote circu∣lar
<PB N="299" REF="379"/>
letters to the counties and corporations of England;
and his orders were universally complied with. A most
profound tranquility prevailed throughout the kingdom;
and the prince's administration was submitted to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convention summoned.</NOTE> as if he
had succeeded in the most regular manner to the vacant
throne. The fleet received his orders: The army, with∣out
murmur or opposition, allowed him to new-model
them. And the city supplied him with a loan of two
hundred thousand pounds.</P>
<P>THE conduct of the Prince with regard to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689.</NOTE>
was founded on the same prudent and moderate maxims.<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of Janu∣ary.</NOTE>
Finding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of Scotland.</NOTE> that there were many Scotsmen of rank at that
time in London, he summoned them together, laid be∣fore
them his intentions, and asked their advice in the
present emergency. This assembly, consisting of thirty
noblemen and about fourscore gentelmen, chose duke
Hamilton for president; a man, who, being of a tempo∣rizing
character, was determined to pay court to the pre∣sent
authority. His eldest son, the earl of Arran, pro∣fessed
an adherence to King James; an usual policy in
Scotland, where the father and son, during civil com∣motions,
are often observed to take, opposite sides: in
order to secure at all adventures the family from forfei∣ture.
Arran proposed to invite back the King upon con∣ditions;
but as he was vehemently opposed in this motion
by Sir Patric Hume, and seconded by nobody, the assem∣bly
made an offer to the Prince of the present adminis∣tration,
which he willingly accepted. To anticipate a
little in our narration; a convention, by circular letters
from the Prince, was summoned at Edinburgh on the
twenty-second of March; where it was soon visible, that
the interest of the malecontests would entirely prevail.
The more zealous Royalists, regarding this assembly as
illegal, had forborn to appear at elections; and the other
party were returned from most places. The revolution
was not, in Scotland as in England, effected by the coa∣lition
<PB N="298" REF="380"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="299" REF="381"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="300" REF="382"/>
of Whig and Tory: The former party alone had
over-powered the government, and were too much en∣raged
by the past injuries, which they had suffered, to
admit of any composition with their former masters. So
soon as the purpose of the convention was discovered,
the earl of Balcarras and viscount Dundee, the leaders
of the Tories, withdrew from Edinburgh; and the con∣vention
having passed a vote, that King James, by his
mal-administration, and his abuse of power, had <HI>forfeited</HI>
all title to the crown, they made a tender of the royal
dignity to the Prince and Princess of Orange.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of Ja∣nuary.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE English convention was assembled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">English con∣vention meets.</NOTE> and it im∣mediately
appeared, that the House of Commons, both
from the prevailing humour of the people, and from the
influence of present authority, were mostly chosen from
among the whig party. After thanks were unanimously
given by both Houses to the Prince of Orange for the
deliverance, which he had brought them, a memorable
vote was in a few days passed by a great majority of the
Commons, and sent up to the House of Peers for their
concurrence. It was contained in these words. “That
King James the second, having endeavoured to subvert
the constitution of the kingdom, by breaking the ori∣ginal
contract betwixt King and people; and having,
by the advice of Jesuits and other wicked persons,
violated the fundamental laws, and withdrawn himself
out of the kingdom, has abdicated the government,
and that the throne is thereby vacant.” This vote,
when carried to the upper House, met with great oppo∣sition;
of which it is here necessary for us to explain the
reason.</P>
<P>THE Tories and the High-church-men, finding them∣selves
at once menaced with a subversion of their laws
and of their religion, had zealously promoted the national
revolt, and had on this occasion departed from those prin∣ciples
of non-resistance, of which, while the King fa∣voured
them, they had formerly made such loud profes∣sions.
<PB N="301" REF="383"/>
Their present apprehensions had prevailed over
their political tenets; and the unfortunate James, who
had too much relied on those general declarations, which
never will be reduced to practice, found in the issue that
both parties were secretly united in opposition to him.
But no sooner was the danger passed, and the general
fear somewhat allayed, than party prejudices resumed, in
some degree, their former authority; and the Tories were
ashamed of that victory, which their antagonists, during
the late transactions, had obtained over them. They
were inclined, therefore, to steer a middle course; and,
tho' generally determined to oppose the King's return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Views of the parties.</NOTE>
they resolved not to consent to the dethroning him, or
altering the line of succession. A regent with kingly
power was the expedient, which they proposed; and a
late instance in Portugal seemed to give some authority
and precedent to that plan of government.</P>
<P>IN favour of this scheme the Tories urged, that, by
the uniform tenor of the English laws, the right of the
crown was ever regarded as sacred, and could, on no ac∣count,
and by no mal-administration, be forfeited by the
Sovereign: That to dethrone a King and to elect his
successor, was a practice quite unknown to the constitu∣tion,
and had a tendency to render kingly power entirely
dependant and precarious: That where the Prince, from
his tender years, from lunacy, or from other natural in∣firmity,
was incapacitated to hold the reins of govern∣ment,
both the laws and former practice agreed in ap∣pointing
a regent, who, during the interval, was in∣vested
with the whole power of the administration: That
the inveterate and dangerous prejudices of King James
had rendered him as unfit to sway the English scepter, as
if he had fallen to lunacy; and it was therefore natural
for the people to have recourse to the same remedy: That
the election of one King was a precedent for the election
of another; and the government, by that means, would
<PB N="302" REF="384"/>
either degenerate into a republic, or what was worse,
into a turbulent and seditious Monarchy: That the case
was still more dangerous, if there remained a Prince,
who claimed the crown by right of succession, and dis∣puted,
on so plausible a ground, the title of the present
Sovereign: That tho' the doctrine of non-resistance
might not, in every possible circumstance, be absolutely
true, yet was the belief of it extremely expedient; and
to establish a government, which should have the con∣trary
principle for its basis, was to lay the foundation of
perpetual revolutions and convulsions: That the appoint∣ment
of a regent was indeed exposed to many inconve∣niencies;
but so long as the line of succession was pre∣served
entire, there was still a prospect of putting an end
some time or other, to the public disorders: And that
scarce any instance occurred in history, especially in the
English history, where a disputed title had not in the issue,
been attended with much greater ills, than all those,
which the people had sought to shun, by departing from
the lineal successor.</P>
<P>THE leaders of the whig-party, on the other hand,
asserted, that, if there was any ill in the precedent, that
ill would result as much from the establishing a regent,
as from the dethroning one King, and appointing his
successor; nor would the one expedient, if wantonly
and rashly embraced by the people, be less the source of
public convulsions than the other: That if the laws
gave no express permission to depose the Sovereign, nei∣ther
did they authorize the resisting his authority, or se∣parating
the power from the title: That a regent was
unknown, except where the Prince, by reason of his
tender age or his infirmities, was incapable of a will;
and in that case, his will was supposed to be involved in
that of the regent: That it would be the height of ab∣surdity
to try a man for acting upon a commission, re∣ceived
from a Prince, whom we ourselves acknowledge
<PB N="303" REF="385"/>
to be the lawful Sovereign; and no jury would decide so
contrary both to law and to common sense, as to con∣demn
such a criminal: That even the prospect of being
delivered from this monstrons inconvenience was, in the
present situation of things, more distant, than that of
putting an end to a disputed succession: That allowing
the young Prince to be the legitimate heir, he had been
carried abroad; he would be educated in principles de∣structive
of the constitution and established religion;
and he would probably leave a son, liable to the same
insuperable objection: That if the whole line were cut
off by law, the people would in time forget or neglect
their claim; an advantage, which could not be hoped
for, while the administration was conducted in their
name, and while they were still acknowledged to possess
the legal title: And that a nation thus perpetually go∣verned
by regents or protectors approached much nearer
to a republic than one subject to Monarchs, whose he∣reditary
regular succession, as well as present authority,
was fixed and appointed by the people.</P>
<P>THIS question was agitated with great zeal by the op∣posite
parties in the House of Peers. The chief speakers
among the Tories were Clarendon, Rochester, and Not∣tingham;
among the Whigs, Halifax and Danby. The
question was carried for a King by two voices only,
fifty-one against forty-nine. All the prelates, except
two, the bishops of London and Bristol, voted for a re∣gent.
The primate, a disinterested but pusillanimous
man, kept at a distance, both from the Prince's court
and from Parliament.</P>
<P>THE House of Peers proceeded next to examine piece∣meal
the vote, sent up to them by the Commons. They
debated, “Whether there was an original contract be∣tween
King and people,” and the affirmative was
carried by fifty-three against forty-six; a proof that the
Tories were already losing ground. The next question
<PB N="302" REF="386"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="303" REF="387"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="304" REF="388"/>
was, “Whether King James had broke that original con∣tract?”
and after a slight opposition, the affirmative
prevailed. The Lords proceeded to take into considera∣tion
the word, <HI>abdicated;</HI> and it was carried that <HI>deserted</HI>
was more proper. The concluding question was, “Whe∣ther
King James, having broke the original contract
and <HI>deserted</HI> the government, the throne was thereby va∣cant?”
This question was debated with more heat and
contention than any of the former; and upon a division,
the Tories prevailed by eleven voices, and it was carried
to omit the last article with regard to the vacancy of the
throne. The vote was sent back to the Commons with
these amendments.</P>
<P>THE earl of Danby had embraced the project of be∣stowing
the Crown solely upon the Princess of Orange,
and of admitting her as hereditary legal successor to
King James: Passing by the infant Prince as illegitimate
or supposititious. His change of party in the last ques∣tion
gave the Tories so considerable a majority in the num∣ber
of voices.</P>
<P>THE Commons still insisted on their vote,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Free <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on∣ferences betwixt the Houses.</NOTE> and sent
up reasons, why the Lords should depart from their
amendments. The Lords were not convinced; and it
was necessary to have a free conference, in order to settle
this controversy. Never national debate surely was more
important, nor managed by more able speakers; yet is
one suprized to find the topics, insisted on by both sides,
so very frivolous; more resembling the verbal disputes
of the schools than the solid reasonings of statesmen and
legislators. In public transactions of such consequence,
the true motives, which produce any measure, are sel∣dom
avowed. The Whigs, now the ruling party, hav∣ing
united with the Tories, in order to bring about the
revolution, had so much deference for their new allies,
as not to insist, that the Crown should be declared <HI>for∣feited,</HI>
on account of the King's mal-administration:
<PB N="305" REF="389"/>
Such a declaration, they thought, would imply too ex∣press
a censure of the old tory principles, and too open
a preference of their own. They agreed therefore to
confound together the King's abusing his power and his
withdrawing from the kingdom; and they called the
whole an <HI>abdication;</HI> as if he had given a virtual, tho'
not a verbal, consent to his dethronement. The Tories
took advantage of this obvious impropriety, which had
been occasioned merely by the complaisance or prudence
of the Whigs; and they insisted upon the word, <HI>deser∣tion,</HI>
as much more significant and intelligible. It was
retorted on them, that, however that expression might be
justly applied to the King's withdrawing himself, it could
not, with any propriety, be extended to his violation of
the fundamental laws. And thus both parties, while
they warped their principles from regard to their antago∣nists,
and from prudential considerations, lost the práise
of consistence and uniformity.</P>
<P>THE managers for the Lords next insisted, that even al∣lowing
the King's abuse of power to be equivalent to an
abdication, or in other words, to a civil death, it could
operate no otherwise than his voluntary resignation or
his natural death; and could only make way for the next
successor. It was a maxim of English law, <HI>that the throne
was never vacant;</HI> but instantly upon the decease of one
King was filled with his legal heir, who was entitled to
all the authority of his predecessor. And however young
or unfit for government the successor, however unfortu∣nate
in his situation, tho' he were even a captive in the
hands of public enemies; yet no just reason, they
thought, could be assigned, why, without any default of
his own, he should lose a crown, to which, by birth,
he was fully intitled. The managers of the Commons
might have opposed this reasoning by many specious
and even solid arguments. They might have said, that
the great security for allegiance being merely opinion,
<PB N="306" REF="390"/>
any scheme of settlement should be adopted, in which,
it was most probable, the people would acquiesce and
persevere. That tho' upon the natural death of one
King, whose administration had been agreeable to the
laws, many and great inconveniencies would be endured
rather than exclude his lineal successor; yet the case
was not the same, when the people had been obliged, by their
revolt, to dethrone a Prince, whose illegal measures had,
in every circumstance, violated the constitution. That
in these extraordinary revolutions, the government re∣turned
to its first principles, and the community acquired
a right of providing for the public interest by expedients,
which, on other occasions, might be deemed violent and
irregular. That the recent use of one extraordinary re∣medy
familiarized the people to the practice of another,
and more reconciled their minds to such licences than
if the government had run on in its usual tenor. And
that King James, having carried abroad his son, as well
as withdrawn himself, had given such just provocation
to the kingdom, had voluntarily involved it in such diffi∣culties,
that the interests of his family were justly sacri∣ficed
to the public settlement and tranquillity. Tho'
these topics seem reasonable, they were intirely forborne
by the whig managers; both because they implied an
acknowledgment of the infant Prince's legitimacy,
which, it was agreed, to keep in obscurity, and because
they contained too express a condemnation of tory prin∣ciples.
They were contented to maintain the vote of
the Commons by shifts and evasions; and both sides
parted at last without coming to any agreement.</P>
<P>BUT it was impossible for the public to remain long in
the present situation. The perseverance, therefore, of
the Lower House obliged the Lords to comply; and by
the desertion of some Peers to the Whig party, the vote
of the Commons, without any alteration, passed by a
small majority in the Upper House, and received the
<PB N="307" REF="391"/>
sanction of every part of the legislature, which then sub∣sisted.</P>
<P>IT happens unluckily for those, who maintain an ori∣ginal
contract between the magistrate and people, that
great revolutions of government, and new settlements
of civil constitutions, are commonly conducted with such
violence, tumult and disorder, that the public voice can
scarce ever be heard; and the opinions of the citizens are
at that time less attended to than even in the common
course of administration. The present transactions in
England, it must be confessed, are a very singular excep∣tion
to this observation. The new elections had been
carried on with great tranquillity and freedom: The
Prince had ordered the troops to depart from all the
towns, where the voters assembled: A tumultuary pe∣tition
to the two Houses having been promoted, he took
care, tho' the petition was calculated for his own advan∣tage,
effectually to suppress it: He entered into no in∣trigues,
either with the electors or the members: He
kept himself in a total silence, as if he had been no wise
concerned in these transactions: And so far from form∣ing
cabals with the leaders of parties, he disdained even
to bestow caresses on those, whose assistance might be use∣ful
to him. This conduct was highly meritorious, and
discovered great moderation and magnanimity; even tho'
the Prince unfortunately, thro' the whole course of his
life, and on every occasion, was noted for an address so
cold, dry, and distant, that it was very difficult for him,
on account of any interest, to soften or familiarize it.</P>
<P>AT last, the Prince deigned to break silence, and to
express, tho' in a private manner, his sentiments on the
present situation of affairs. He called together Halifax,
Shrewsbury, Danby, and a few more; and he told them,
that having been invited over to restore their liberty, he
had engaged in this enterprize, and had at last happily
effected his purpose: That it belonged to the Parliament,
<PB N="308" REF="392"/>
now chosen and assembled with freedom, to concert
measures for the public settlement; and he pretended not
to interpose in their determinations. That he heard of se∣veral
schemes proposed for establishing the government;
Some insisted on a regent; others were desirous of be∣stowing
the Crown on the Princess: It was their concern
alone to choose that plan of administration which was
most agreeable or advantageous to them. That if they
chose to settle a regent, he had no objection: He only
thought it incumbent on him to inform them, that he
was determined not to be the regent, nor ever to engage
in a scheme, which, he knew, would be exposed to such
insuperable difficulties. That no man could have a juster
or deeper sense of the Princess's merit than he was im∣pressed
with; but he would rather remain a private per∣son
than enjoy a crown, which must depend on the will
or life of another. And that they must therefore make ac∣count,
if they were inclined to either of these two plans
of settlement, that it would be totally out of his power
to assist them in carrying it into execution: His affairs
abroad were too important to be abandoned for so pre∣carious
a dignity, or even to allow him so much leizure
as would be requisite to introduce order into their dis∣jointed
government.</P>
<P>THESE views of the prince were seconded by the Prin∣cess
herself, who, as she possessed many virtues, was
a most obsequious wife to a husband, who, in the judg∣ment
of the generality of her sex, would have appeared
so little attractive and amiable. All considerations were
neglected, when they came in competition with what
she deemed her duty to the Prince. When Danby and
others of her partizans wrote her an account of their
schemes and proceedings, she expressed great displeasure;
and even transmitted their letters to her husband, as a
sacrifice to conjugal fidelity. The Princess Anne also
concurred in the same plan for the public settlement;
<PB N="309" REF="393"/>
and being promised an ample revenue, was contented to
he postponed in the succession to the crown. And as the
title of her infant brother, in the present establishment,
was entirely neglected, she might, on the whole, esteem
herself, in point of interest, a great gainer by this revo∣lution.</P>
<P>ALL parties, therefore, being agreed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the crown.</NOTE> the Convention
passed a bill, where they settled the Crown on the Prince
and Princess of Orange, the sole Administration to re∣main
in the Prince: The Princess of Denmark to succeed
after the death of the Prince and Princess of Orange;
her posterity after those of the Princess, but before those
of the Prince by any other wife. The Convention an∣nexed
to this settlement of the crown a declaration of
rights, where all the points, which had, of late years,
been disputed between King and people, were finally de∣termined;
and the powers of royal prerogative were
more narrowly circumscribed and more exactly defined,
than in any former period of the English government.</P>
<P>THUS we have seen, thro' the course of four reigns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners, arts, and sciences,</NOTE> a
continued struggle maintained between the crown and the
people: Privilege and Prerogative were ever at variance:
And both parties, beside the present object of dispute, had
many latent claims, which, on a favourable occasion,
they produced against their adversaries. Governments
too steady and uniform, as they are seldom free, so are
they, in the judgment of some, attended with another
sensible inconvenience: They abate the active powers of
men; depress courage, invention, and genius; and pro∣duce
<PB N="310" REF="394"/>
an universal lethargy in the people. Tho' this
opinion may be just, the fluctuation and contest, it must
be allowed, of the English government were, during these
reigns, much too violent both for the repose and safety
of the people. Foreign affairs, at that time, were either
entirely neglected, or managed to pernicious purposes:
And in the domestic administration there was felt a con∣tinued
fever, either secret or manifest; sometimes the
most furious convulsions and disorders. The revolution
forms a new epoch in the constitution; and was attended
with consequences much more advantageous to the peo∣ple,
than the barely freeing them from a bad administra∣tion.
By deciding many important questions in favour
of liberty, and still more, by that great precedent of de∣posing
one King, and establishing a new family, it gave
such an ascendant to popular principles, as has put the
nature of the English constitution beyond all controversy.
And it may safely be affirmed, without any danger of
exaggeration, that we in this island have ever since en∣joyed,
if not the best system of government, at least the
most entire system of liberty, that ever was known
amongst mankind.</P>
<P>TO decry with such violence, as is affected by some,
the whole line of Stuart; to maintain, that their admi∣nistration
was one continued encroachment on the <HI>incon∣testible</HI>
rights of the people; is not giving due honour
to that great event, which not only put a period to their
hereditary succession, but made a new settlement of
the whole constitution. The inconveniencies, suffered by
the people under the two first reigns of that family (for
in the main they were prosperous) proceeded in a great
measure from the unavoidable situation of affairs; and
scarce any thing could have prevented those events, but
such vigour of genius in the Sovereign, attended with
such good fortune, as might have enabled him entirely to
overpower the liberties of his people. While the Parlia∣ments,
<PB N="311" REF="395"/>
in these reigns, were taking advantage of the ne∣cessities
of the Prince, and attempting every session to
abolish, or circumscribe, or define, some prerogative of
the Crown, and innovate in the usual tenor of govern∣ment:
Must it not be expected, that the Prince would
defend an authority, which, for above a century, that
is, during the whole regular course of the for∣mer
English government, had been exercised with∣out
dispute or controversy? And tho' Charles the
second, in 1672, may with reason be deemed the
aggressor, nor is it possible to justify his conduct; yet
were there some motives surely, which could engage a
Prince, so soft and indolent, and at the same time, so
judicious, to attempt such hazardous enterprizes. He
felt, that public affairs had reached a situation, at which
they could not possibly remain, without some farther in∣novation.
Frequent Parliaments were become almost
entirely necessary to the conduct of public business; yet
these assemblies were still, in the judgment of the Roy∣alists,
much inferior in dignity to the Sovereign, whom
they seemed better calculated to council than controul.
The Crown still possessed considerable power of opposing
Parliaments; and had not as yet acquired the means of
influencing them. Hence a continued jealousy between
these parts of the constitution: Hence the inclination
mutually to take advantage of each other's necessities:
Hence the impossibility under which the King lay of find∣ing
ministers, who could at once be serviceable and
faithful to him. If he followed his own choice in ap∣pointing
his servants, without regard to their parliamen∣tary
interest, a refractory session was instantly to be ex∣pected:
If he chose them from among the leaders of po∣pular
assemblies, they either lost their influence by ad∣hering
to the Crown, or they betrayed the Crown, in
order to preserve their influence with the people. Nei∣ther
Hambden, whom Charles the first was willing to
<PB N="312" REF="396"/>
gain at any price; nor Shaftesbury, whom Charles the
second, after the popish plot, attempted to engage in his
councils, would renounce their popularity for the preca∣rious,
and, as they esteemed it, deceitful favour of the
Prince. The root of their authority they still thought
to lye in the Parliament; and as the power of that as∣sembly
was not yet uncontrouleable, they still resolved
to augment it, tho' at the expence of the royal preroga∣tives.</P>
<P>'TIS no wonder, that these events, by the representa∣tions
of faction, have long been extremely clouded and
obscured. No man has yet arose, who has been en∣abled
to pay an entire regard to truth, and has dared to
expose her, without covering or disguise, to the eyes of
the prejudiced public. Even that party amongst us,
who boast of the highest regard to liberty, have not pos∣sessed
sufficient liberty of thought in this particular; nor
have been able to decide impartially of their own merit
compared with that of their antagonists. More noble
undoubtedly in their ends, and more beneficial to man∣kind;
they must also be allowed to have been often less
justifiable in the means, and in many of their transactions
to have payed more regard to political than to moral
considerations. Being obliged to court the populace,
they found it necessary to comply with their rage and
folly; and have even, on many occasions, by propagat∣ing
fictions, by promoting violence, served to infatuate,
as well as corrupt that people, to whom they made a
tender of liberty and justice. Charles the first was a
tyrant, a Papist, and a contriver of the Irish massacre:
The church of England was relpasing fast into idolatry:
Puritanism was the only true religion, and the covenant
the favourite object of heavenly regard. Thro' these de∣lusions
the party proceeded, and, what may seem more
wonderful, still to the encrease of law and liberty; 'till
they reached the imposture of the popish plot, a fiction
<PB N="313" REF="397"/>
which exceeds the ordinary bounds of vulgar credulity.
But however singular these events may appear, there is
really nothing altogether new in any period of modern
history: And it is remarkable, that tribunitian arts, tho'
sometimes useful in a free constitution, have often been
such as men of strict probity and honour could not bring
themselves either to practice or approve. The other fac∣tion,
who, since the revolution, have been obliged to
court the populace, sometimes found it requisite to em∣ploy
like artifices.</P>
<P>THE whig party, for a course of near seventy years,
have, almost without interruption, enjoyed the whole
authority of the government; and no honours nor offices
could be obtained but by their countenance and protec∣tion.
But this event, which has been advantageous to
the state, has been destructive to the truth of history,
and has established many gross falshoods, which it is
unaccountable how any civilized nation could have em∣braced
with regard to its domestic occurrences. Com∣positions
ths most despicable, both for style and matter,
have been extolled, and propagated, and read; as if
they had equalled the most celebrated remains of anti∣quity.
And because the ruling party had obtained an
advantage over their antagonists in the philosophical dis∣putes
concerning some of their general principles, they
thence assumed a right to impose on the public their ac∣count
of all particular transactions, and to represent the
other party as governed entirely by the lowest and most
vulgar prejudices. But extremes of all kinds are to be
avoided; and tho' no one will ever please either faction
by moderate opinions, it is there we are most likely to
meet with truth and cetainty.</P>
<P>WE shall subjoin to this general view of the English
government, some account of the state of the finances,
arms, trade, manners, arts, between the restoration and
revolution.

THE revenue of Charles the second, as settled by the
long Parliament, was put upon a very bad footing. It
was too small, if they intended to make him indepen∣dant
in the common course of his administration: It
was too large, and settled during too long a period, if
they resolved to keep him in entire dependance. The large
debts of the republic, which were thrown upon that
Prince, the necessity of supplying the naval and military
stores, which were entirely exhausted<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lord Clarendon's speech to the Parliament, Oct. 9, 1665.</NOTE>; that of repair∣ing
and furnishing his palaces: All these causes involved
the King in great difficulties immediately after his resto∣ration;
and the Parliament were not sufficiently liberal
in supplying him. Perhaps too he had contracted some
debts abroad; and his bounty to the distressed cavaliers,
tho' it did not correspond either to their services or ex∣pectations,
could not fail, in some degree, to exhaust
his treasures. The extraordinary sums, granted the
King during the first years, did not suffice for these ex∣traordinary
charges; and the excise and customs, the only
constant revenue, amounted not to nine hundred thou∣sand
pounds a year, and fell very much short of the or∣dinary
charges of the government. The addition of
hearth-money in 1662, and of the other two branches
in 1669 and 1670, brought up the revenue to one mil∣lion
three hundred fifty-eight thousand pounds, as we
learn from lord treasurer Danby's account: But the
same authority informs us, that the yearly expence of
the government was at that time one million three hun∣dred
eighty seven thousand seven hundred and seventy
pounds<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ralph's History, vol. i. p. 288. We learn from that lord's Memoirs, p. 12. that the receipts of the Exchequer, during six years, from 1673 to 1679, was about eight millions two hundred thousand pounds, or one million three hundred sixty-six thousand pounds a year. See likewise, p. 169.</NOTE>, without mentioning contingencies, which are
always very considerable, even under the most prudent
<PB N="315" REF="401"/>
administration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXXI.</NOTE> Those branches of revenue, granted in
1669 and 1670, expired in 1680, and were never renewed
by the Parliament: They were computed to be above
two hundred thousand pounds a year. It must be al∣lowed,
because asserted. by all cotemporary authors of
both parties, and even confessed by himself, that King
Charles was somewhat profuse and negligent. But it is
likewise certain, that a very rigid frugality was requisite
to support the government under such difficulties. There
is a familiar rule in all business, that every, man should
be payed, in proportion to the trust reposed in him, and
to the power, which he enjoys; and the nation soon
found reason, from Charles's dangerous connexions with
France, to repent their transgression of that prudential
maxim.</P>
<P>IF we estimate the ordinary revenue of Charles the se∣cond
at one million two hundred thousand pounds a year
during his whole reign, the computation with rather ex∣ceed
than fall under the, true value. The Convention
Parliament, after all the sums, which they had granted the
King towards the payment of old debts, threw, the last
day of their meeting, a debt upon him, amounting to
one million seven hundred forty-three thousand two hun∣dred
sixty-three pounds<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Journals, 29th of December, 1660.</NOTE>. All the extraordinary sums,
which were afterwards voted him by Parliament, amount∣ed
to eleven millions four hundred forty-three thousand
four hundred and seven pounds; which divided by
twenty-four, the number of years, which that King
reigned, make four hundred seventy-six thousand eight
hundred and eight pounds a year. During that time, he
had two violent wars to sustain with the Dutch; and in
1678, he made expensive preparations for a war with
France. In the first Dutch war, both France and Den∣mark
were allies to the United Provinces, and the naval armaments
in England were very great; so that it is im∣possible
<PB N="316" REF="402"/>
he could have secreted any part, at least any con∣siderable
part, of the sums, which were then voted him
by: Parliament.</P>
<P>To these sums we must add about one million two
hundred thousand pounds, which had been detained from
the bankers on shutting up the Exchequer in 1672. The
King payed six per cent. for this money during all the
rest of his reign<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Danby's Memoirs, p. 7.</NOTE>. It is remarkable, that, notwith∣standing
this violent breach of faith, the King, two
years after, borrowed money at eight per cent; the same
rate of interest, which he had payed before that event<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 65.</NOTE>.
A proof, that public credit, instead of being of so de∣licate
a nature, as we are apt to imagine, is, in reality, so
hardy and roust, that it is very difficult to destroy it.</P>
<P>THE revenue of James was raised by the Parliament
to about one million eight hundred fifty thousand pounds<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Journ. 1st of March, 1689.</NOTE>;
and his income as Duke of York being added, made the
whole amount to two millions a year; a sum well pro∣portioned
to the public necessities, but enjoyed by him
in too independent a manner. The national debt at the
revolution amounted to one million fifty-four thousand
nine hundred twenty-five pounds<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Journ. 20th of March, 1689.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE militia fell much to decay during these two reigns,
partly by the policy of the Kings, who had entertained
a diffidence of their subjects, partly by that ill judged
law, which limited the King's power of mustering and
arraying them. In the beginning, however, of Charles's
reign, the militia were still deemed formidable. De
Wit having proposed to the French King an invasion of
England during the first Dutch war, that Monarch re∣plied,
that such an attempt would be entirely fruitless,
and would tend only to unite the English. In a few
days, said he, after our landing, there will be fifty thou∣sand
men at least upon us<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">D'Estrades, 20th of October, 1666.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="403"/>
CHARLES in the beginning of his reign had in pay near
five thousand men, of guards and garrisons. At the end
of his reign, he augmented this number to near eight
thousand. James on Monmouth's rebellion had on foot
about fifteen thousand men; and when ths Prince of
Orange invaded him, there were no fewer than thirty
thousand regular troops in England.</P>
<P>THE English navy, during the greatest part of Charles's
reign, made a great figure, for number of ships, valour
of the men, and conduct of the commanders. Even in
1678, the fleet consisted of eighty-three ships<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Pepys's Memoirs, p. 4.</NOTE>; besides
thirty, which were at that, time on the stocks. On the
King's accession he found only sixty-three vessels of all
sizes<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of English affairs, chiefly naval.</NOTE>. During the latter part of Charles's reign, the
navy fell considerably to decay, by reason of the narrow∣ness
of the King's revenue: But James, soon after his
accession, restored it to its former power and glory; and
before he left the throne, carried it much father. The
administration of the admiralty under Pepys, is still re∣garded
as a model for order and economy. The fleet at
the revolution consisted of one hundred seventy-three
vessels of all sizes; and required forty-two thousand sea∣men
to man it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. ii. p. 476.</NOTE>. That King, when Duke of York,
had been the first inventor of sea-signals. The military
genius, during thiese two reigns, had not totally decayed
among the young nobility. Dorset, Mulgrave, Roches∣ter,
not to mention Ossory, served on board the fleet,
and were present in the most furious engagements against
the Dutch.</P>
<P>THE commerce and riches of England did never, du∣ring
any period, increase so fast as from the restoration
to the revolution. The two Dutch wars, by disturbing
the trade of that republic, promoted the navigation of
this island; and after Charles had made a separate peace
<PB N="318" REF="404"/>
with the States, his subjects enjoyed unmolested the
trade of Europe. The only disturbance, which they
met with, was from a few French privateers, who in∣fested
the channel; and Charles interposed not in behalf
of his subjects with sufficient spirit and vigour. The
recovery or conquest of New York and the Jerseys was
a very considerable accession to the strength and security
of the English colonies; and, together with the settle∣ment
of Pensilvania and Carolina, which was effected
during this reign, extended prodigiously the English em∣pire
in America. The persecutions of the Dissenters,
or more properly speaking, the restraints imposed upon
them, contributed to augment and people these colonies.
Dr. Davenant affirms<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Discourse on the public revenues, part ii. P. 29, 33, 36.</NOTE> that the shipping of England
doubled during these twenty-eight years. Several new
manufactures were established; in iron, brass, silk, hats,
glass, &amp;c. One Brewer, leaving the Low Countries, when
they were threatened with a French conquest, brought the
art of dying woollen cloth into England, and by that im∣provement
saved the nation great sums of money. The
encrease of coynage during these two reigns was ten
millions two hundred sixty-one thonsand pounds. A
board of trade was erected in 1670; and the earl of
Sandwich was made president. Charles revived and sup∣ported
the charter of the East-India company; a mea∣sure
whole utility is somewhat doubtful: He granted a
charter to the Hudson's Bay company; a measure evi∣dently
hurtful.</P>
<P>THE French King, about the beginning of Charles's
reign, laid some impositions on English commodities:
And the English, partly displeased with this innovation,
partly moved by their animosity against France, retalio∣ated,
by laying such restraints on the commerce with
that kingdom as amounted almost to a prohibition. They
<PB N="319" REF="405"/>
formed calculations, by which they perswaded themselves,
that they were losers a million and half or near two mil∣lions
a year by the French trade. But no good effects
were found to result from these restraints; and in King
James's reign they were taken off by the Parliament.</P>
<P>AT the same time that the burroughs of England were
deprived of their privileges, the like attempt was made
on the colonies. King James recalled their charters, by
which their liberties were secured; and he sent over go∣vernors
invested with absolute power. The arbitrary
principles of that Monarch appeared in every part of his
administration.</P>
<P>THE people, during these two reigns, were, in a
great measure, cured of that wild fanaticism, by which
they had formerly been so much agitated. Whatever
new vices they might acquire, it may be questioned,
whether, by this change, they were, in the main, much
losers in point of morals. By the example of the King
and the cavaliers, licentiousness and debauchery became
very prevalent in the nation. The pleasures of the table
were much pursued. Love was treated, more as an ap∣petite
than a passion. The one sex began to abate of
the national, character of chastity, without being able
to inspire the other with sentiment or delicacy.</P>
<P>THE abuses in the former age, arising from over∣strained
pretensions of piety, had much propagated the
spirit of irreligion<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><P>This sophism, of arguing from the abuse of any thing against the use of it, is one of the grossest; and at the same time, the most common, to which men are subject. The history, of all ages, and none more than that of the period, which is our subject, offers us examples of the abuse of religion; and we have not been sparing to remark, them: But whoever would thence draw an inference to the disadvantage of religion in general, would argue very rashly and erroneously. The proper office of religion is to reform men's lives, to purify their hearts, to inforce all moral duties, and to secure obedience to, the laws and civil magistrate. While it pursues these falutary purposes, its operations, tho' infinitely valuable, are secret and silent, and seldom come under the cognizance of history. That adulterate species of it alone, whlch inflames faction, animates sedition, and prompts rebe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, distinguishes itself on the open theatre of the world, and is the great, source of revolutions and public co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vulsions. The historian, therefore, has scarce occasion to mention any other kind of religion; and he may retain the highest regard, for true piety, even while he exposes all the abuses of the false. He may even think, that he cannot better show his attachment to the Former than by detecting the latter, and, laying open its absurdities and pernicious tendency.</P>
<P>IT is no proof of irreligion in an historian, that he remarks some fault or imperfection in each, sect of religion, which he has occasion to mention, Every institution, however divine, which is adopted by men, must partake of the weakness and infirmities of our nature; and will be apt, unless carefully guarded, to degenerate into one extreme or the other. What species of devotion so pure, noble, and worthy, the Supreme Being, as that which is most spiritual, simple, unadorned, and which partakes nothing either of the senses or imagination? Yet is it found by experience, that this mode of worship does very naturally, among the vulgar, mount up into extravagance and fanaticism. Even many of the first reformers are exposed to this reproach; and their zeal, tho' in the event, it proved extremely useful, partook strongly of the enthusiastic genius: Two of the judges in the reign of Charles the second, scrupled not to advance this opinion even from the bench. Some mixture ceremony, pomp, and ornament may seem to correct the abuse; yet will it be found very difficult to prevent such a form of religion from sinking sometimes into superstision the church of England itself, which is perhaps the best medium among these extremes, will be allowed, at least during the, age of archbishop La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, to have been somewhat infected with a superstition, resembling the popish; and to have payed a higher regard to some positive institutions, than the nature of the things, strictly speaking, would permit. It is the business of an historian to remark these abuses of all kinds; but it belongs also to a prudent reader to confine the representations, which he meets with, to that age alone of which the author treats. What absurdity, for instance, to suppose, that the Presbyterians, Independants, Anabaptists, and other sectaries of the present age, partake of, all the extravagancies, which, we remark in those who bore these appellations in the last century? The inference indeed seem juster; where sects have been noted for fanaticism during one period, to conclude, that they will be very moderate and reasonable in the subsequent. For as it is the nature of fanaticism to abolish all slavish submission to priests power; it follows that as soon as the first ferment is abated, men are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate rally in such fects left to the free use of their reason, and shake off the fetters of custom and authority.</P></NOTE>

this period lie under the imputation of Deism. Besides
wits and scholars by profession, Shaftesbury, Halifax,
<PB N="321" REF="407"/>
Buckingham, Mulgrave, Sunderland, Essex Rochester,
Sidney, Temple are supposed to have adopted these prin∣ciples.</P>
<P>THE same factions, which formerly distracted the na∣tion,
were revived, and exerted themselves in the most
ungenerous and unmanly enterprizes against each other.
King Charles, being in his whole deportment a model
of easy and gentlemanly behaviour, improved the polite∣ness
of the nation; as much as faction, which of all
things is most destructive to politeness, could possibly per∣mit.
His courtiers were long distinguishable in England
by their obliging and agreeable manners.</P>
<P>AMIDST the thick cloud of bigotr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and ignorance,
which overspread the nation, during the Commonwealth
and Protectorship, there were a few sedate philosophers,
who in the retirement of Oxford, cultivated their reason,
and established conferences for the mutual communica∣tion
of their discoveries in physics and geometry. Wil∣kins,
a clergyman, who had married Cromwel's sister
and was afterwards created bishop of Chester, promoted
these philosophical conversations. Immediately after the
restoration, these men procured a patent, and having
enlarged their number, were denominated the <HI>Royal So∣ciety.</HI>
But this patent was all they obtained from the
King. Tho' Charles was a great lover of the sciences,
particularly chymistry and mechanics, he animated them
by his example alone, not by his bounty. His craving
courtiers and mistresses, by whom he was perpetually sur∣rounded,
engrossed all his expence, and left him neither
money nor attention for literary merit. His contempo∣porary,
Lewis, who fell short of the King's genius and
knowledge in this particular, much exceeded him in libe∣rality.
Besides pensions conferred on learned men
throughout all Europe, his academies were directed by
rules and supported by fallaries: A generosity, which
does great honour to his memory; and in the eyes of all

<PB N="322" REF="410"/>
the ingenuous part of mankind, will be esteemed art
atonement for many of the errors of his reign. We
may he surprized, that this example should not be more
followed by Princes; since it is certain, that that bounty,
so extensive, so beneficial, and so much celebrated, cost
not that Monarch so great a sum as is often conferred on
one single, useless, overgrown favourite or courtier.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the French academy of sciences was directed,
encouraged, and supported by the Sovereign, there arose
in England some men of superior genius, who were more
than sufficient to cast the ballance, and who drew on
themselves and on their native country the regard and at∣tention
of all Europe. Besides Wilkins, Wren, Wallis,
eminent mathematicians, Hooke, an accurate observer
by microscopes, and Sydenham, the restorer of true phy∣sic;
there flourished during this period a Boyle and a
Newton; men who trode, with cautious, and there∣fore
the more secure steps, the only road, which leads to
true philosophy.</P>
<P>BOYLE improved the pneumatic engine, invented by
Otto Guericke, and was thereby enabled to make several
new and curious experiments on the air as well as on
other bodies: His chymistry is much admired by those
acquainted with that art: his hydrostatics contain a
greater mixture of reasoning and invention with experi∣ment
than any other of his works; but his reasoning is
still remote from that boldness and temerity, which had
led astray so many philosophers. Boyle was a great par∣tizan
of the mechanical philosophy; a theory, which, by
discovering some of the secrets of nature, and allowing us
to imagine the rest, is so agreeable to the natural vanity
and curiosity of men.</P>
<P>IN Newton this island may boast of having produced the
greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the orna∣ment
and instruction of the species. Cautious, in ad∣mitting
no principles but such as were founded on expe∣riment;
<PB N="323" REF="411"/>
but resolute to adopt every such principle, how∣ever
new or unusual: From modesty, ignorant of his su∣priority
above the rest of mankind; and thence, less
careful to accommodate his reasonings to common appre∣hensions:
More anxious to merit than acquire fame: He
was from these causes long unknown to the world; but
his reputation at last broke out with a lustre, which scarce
any writer, during his own life-time, had ever before
attained. While Newton seemed to draw off the veil
from some of the mysteries of nature, he shewed at the
same time the imperfections of the mechanical philosophy;
and thereby restored her ultimate secrets to that obscurity,
in which they ever did and ever will remain.</P>
<P>THIS age was far from being so favourable to polite
literature as to the sciences. Charles, tho' fond of wit,
tho' possessed himself of a considerable share of it, tho'
his taste of conversation seems to have been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound and
just; served rather to corrupt than improve the poetry and
eloquence of his time. When the theatres were opened
at the restoration, and freedom was again given to plea∣santry
and ingenuity; men, after so long an abstinence,
fed on these delicacies with less taste than avidity, and
the coarsest and most irregular species of wit was received
by the court as well as by the people. The productions
at that time represented on the theatre were such mon∣sters
of extravagance and folly; so utterly devoid of
all reason or even common sense; that they would be
the disgrace of English literature, had not the nation made
attonement for its former admiration of them, by the to∣tal
oblivion to which they are now condemned. The
duke of Buckingham's Rehearsal, which exposed these
wild productions, seems to be a piece of ridicule car∣ried
to excess; yet in reality the copy scarce equals
some of the absurdities, which we meet with in the
originals.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="412"/>
THIS severe satyre, together with the good sense of the
nation, corrected, after some time, the extravagancies
of the fashionable wit; but the productions of literature
still wanted much of that correctness and delicacy, which
we so much admire in the antients, and in the French
writers, their judicious imitators. It was indeed during
this period chiefly, that that nation left the English be∣hind
them in the productions of poetry, eloquence, his∣tory,
and other branches of polite letters; and acquired
a superiority, which the efforts of English writers, during
the subsequent age, did more successfully contest with
them. The arts and sciences were imported from Italy
into this island as early as in France; and made at first
more surprizing advances. Spencer, Shakespear, Bacon,
Johnson, were much superior to their cotemporaries,
who flourished in that kingdom. Milton, Waller, Den∣ham,
Cowley, Harvey were at least equal to their cotem∣poraries.
The reign of Charles the second, which some
preposterously represent as our augustan age, retarded the
progress of polite literature in his island; and it was
then found, that the immeasurable licentiousness, which
was indulged or rather applauded at court, was more
destructive to the refined arts than even the cant, non∣sense,
and enthusiasm of the preceeding period.</P>
<P>MOST of the celebrated writers of this age remain mo∣numents
of genius, perverted by indecency and bad taste;
but none more than Dryden, both by reason of the great∣ness
of his talents and the gross abuse which he made of
them. His plays, excepting a few scenes, are utterly
disfigured by vice or folly or both. His translations ap∣pear
too much the offspring of haste and hunger: Even
his fables are ill chosen tales, conveyed in an incorrect,
tho' spirited versification. Yet amidst this great number
of loose productions, the refuse of our language, there
are found some small pieces, his Ode to St. Cecilia, the
<PB N="325" REF="413"/>
greatest part of Absalom and Achitophel, and a few more,
which discover so great genius, such a richness of expres∣sion,
such pomp and variety of numbers, that they leave
us equally full of regret and indignation, on account of
the inferiority or rather great absurdity of his other
writings.</P>
<P>The very name of Rochester is offensive to modest
ears; yet does his poetry discover such energy of style and
such poignancy of satyre, as give ground to imagine what
so fine a genius, had he fallen in a more happy age and
had followed better models, was capable of producing.
The antient satyrists often used great liberty in their ex∣pressions;
but their freedom no more resembles the li∣cence
of Rochester, than the nakedness of an Indian does
that of a common prostitute.</P>
<P>WYCHERLEY was ambitious of the reputation of
wit and libertinism; and he attained it: He was pro∣bably
capable of reaching the fame of true comedy,
and instructive ridicule. Otway had a genius finely
turned to the pathetic: but he neither observes strictly
the rules of the drama, nor the rules, still more, essen∣tial,
of propriety and decorum. By one single piece the
duke of Buckingham did both great service to his age and
honour to himself. The earls of Mulgrave, Dorset, and
Roscommon wrote in a good taste; but their productions
are either feeble or careless. The marquess of Halifax
discovers a refined genius; and nothing but leizure and
an inferior station seem wanting to have procured him
great eminence in literature.</P>
<P>OF all the considerable writers of this age, Sir William
Temple is almost the only one, who kept himself altogether,
unpolluted by that inundation of vice and licentiousness,
which overwhelmed the nation. The style of this au∣thor,
tho' extremely negligent, and even mixed with fo∣reign
idioms, is agreeable and interesting. That mix∣ture
<PB N="326" REF="414"/>
of vanity, which appears, in his works, is rather a
recommendation to them. By means of it, we enter into
acquaintance with the character of the author, full of
honour and humanity; and fancy that we are engaged,
not in the perusal of a book, but in conversation with a
companion.</P>
<P>THO' Hudibras was published, and probably com∣posed,
during Charles the second's reign, Butler may
justly, as well as Milton, be thought to belong to the
foregoing period. No composition abounds so much as
Hudibras in strokes of just and inimitable wit; yet are
there many performances, which give as great or greater
entertainment on the whole perusal. The allusions are
often dark and far-fetched; and tho' scarce any author
was ever able to express his thoughts in so few words, he
often employs too many thoughts on one subject, and
thereby becomes prolix after an unusual manner. It is
surprizing how much erudition Butler has introduced with
so good a grace into a work of pleasantry and humour;
Hudibras is perhaps one of the most learned compositions,
that is to be found in any language. The advantage,
which the royal cause received from this poem, in expo∣sing
the fanaticism and false pretences of the former par∣liamentary
party, was prodigious. The king himself
had so good a taste as to be highly pleased with the me∣rit
of the work, and had even got a great part of it by
heart: Yet was he either so careless in his temper, or so
little endowed with the virtue of liberality, or more
properly speaking, of gratitude, that he allowed the au∣thor,
who was a man of virtue and probity, to live in
obscurity, and die in want. Dryden is an instance of a
negligence of the same kind. His Absalom sensibly
contributed in the victory, which the Tories obtained
over the Whigs after the exclusion-parliaments: Yet
could not this merit, aided by his great genius, procure
<PB N="327" REF="415"/>
him an establishment, which might exempt him from
the necessity of writing for bread. Otway, tho' a profest
Royalist, could not eyen procure bread by his writings;
and he had the singular fate of dying literally of hunger.
These incidents throw a great stain on the memory
of Charles, who had discernment, loved genius, was
liberal of money, but attained not the praise of true
generosity.</P>
