<HEAD>Dr. CHEYNE's
Own ACCOUNT of
HIMSELF.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Was born of healthy Parents, in the <HI>Prime</HI>
of their Days, but disposed to <HI>Corpulence</HI>
by the whole Race of one Side of my Fa∣mily.
I passed my Youth in close Study,
and almost constant Application to the
<HI>abstracted Sciences,</HI> and consequently in
great Temperance and a sedentary Life; yet not so
much, but that I sometimes kept <HI>Holyday,</HI> diverted
myself with the Works of Imagination, and rouzed
Nature by ageeable Company and good Cheer.</P>
<P>Upon my coming to <HI>London,</HI> I, all of a sudden,
chang'd my whole Manner of Living: I found the
<HI>Bottle Companions,</HI> the <HI>younger Gentry,</HI> and <HI>Free-livers,</HI>
to be the most easy of <HI>Access,</HI> and most quickly sus∣ceptible
of <HI>Friendship</HI> and <HI>Acquaintance;</HI> nothing being
necessary for that Purpose, but to be able to <HI>eat</HI> lusti∣ly,
and swallow down much <HI>Liquor;</HI> and being natu∣rally
of a large Size, a chearful Temper, and tolera∣ble
lively <HI>Imagination;</HI> and having, in my Country
Retirement, laid in Store of <HI>Ideas</HI> and <HI>Facts;</HI> by these
Qualifications I soon became caressed by them, and
grew daily in <HI>Bulk</HI> and in <HI>Friendship</HI> with these gay
Gentlemen and their Acquaintances.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6"/>
I was tempted to continue this Course, no Doubt
from a Liking, as well as to force a <HI>Trade,</HI> which
Method I had observed to succeed with some others;
and thus constantly dining and supping in <HI>Taverns,</HI>
and in the Houses of my Acquaintances of <HI>Taste</HI> and
<HI>Delicacy,</HI> my Health was in a few Years brought into
great Distress, by so sudden and violent a Change. I
grew excessively <HI>fat, short-breath'd, lethargic,</HI> and
<HI>listless.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He then gives an</HI> Account <HI>of a violent</HI> Fever <HI>he was
seized with, and proceeds,</HI> p. 327.</P>
<P>At this Time I left off <HI>Suppers</HI> of all Kinds, even
at <HI>Dinner</HI> eating but a small Quantity of <HI>Animal Food,</HI>
and drinking very little fermented Liquor, well know∣ing
that <HI>Diseases</HI> must always be cured by their Con∣traries.
On this Occasion, all my <HI>bouncing, protest∣ing,
undertaking</HI> Companions forsook me, and dropp'd
off like Autumn Leaves: They could not bear, it
seems, to see their Companion in such Misery, but
retired to comfort themselves with a <HI>cheerupping</HI> Cup,
leaving me to pass the melancholy Moments with my
own Apprehensions and Remorse. Even those who
had shared the best Part of my Profusions, who, in
their Necessities, had been assisted by my false Gene∣rosity,
and, in their Disorders, relieved by my Care,
did now entirely abandon me; so that I was forc'd
to retire into the Country quite alone, being reduced
to the State of Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> when he said, that
<HI>if he had served his</HI> Maker <HI>as faithfully and warmly as
he had his</HI> Prince, <HI>he would not have forsaken him in
that Extremity:</HI> And so will every one find, when <HI>U∣nion</HI>
and <HI>Friendship</HI> is not founded on <HI>solid Virtue,</HI> and
in Conformity to the <HI>divine Order,</HI> but in <HI>sensual Plea∣sures</HI>
and mere <HI>Jollity.</HI> This Circumstance I mention,
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
because I thought then, it had some Share in my suc∣ceeding
<HI>Melancholy,</HI> p. 330.</P>
<P>While I was thus forsaken by my <HI>Holiday</HI> Friends,
and my Body was, as it were, melting away like a
<HI>Snow-ball</HI> in Summer, being dejected, <HI>melancholy,</HI> and
much confined at Home, by a Course of <HI>mineral</HI> Me∣dicines,
and Country Retirement, I had a long Sea∣son
for <HI>Meditation</HI> and <HI>Reflection,</HI> (my Faculties being
then as clear and quick as ever) which I was the
more readily led into, that I concluded myself infalli∣bly
entering into an <HI>unknown State of Things.</HI></P>
<P>Having had a <HI>liberal</HI> and <HI>regular</HI> Education, with
the Instruction and Example of pious Parents (who
at first had designed me for the <HI>Church</HI>) I had pre∣served
a firm Persuasion of the great and fundamental
Principles of all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Morality; viz.</HI> The <HI>Ex∣istence</HI>
of a <HI>supreme</HI> and <HI>infinitely perfect Being,</HI> the
<HI>Freedom</HI> of the <HI>Will,</HI> the <HI>Immortality</HI> of the <HI>Spirits</HI> of
all <HI>intelligent Beings,</HI> and the Certainty of <HI>future Re∣wards</HI>
or <HI>Punishments.</HI></P>
<P>These Doctrines I had examined carefully and had
been confirmed in, from <HI>abstracted Reasonings,</HI> as well
as from the best <HI>natural Philosophy,</HI> and some clearer
Knowledge of the <HI>material System</HI> of the World in ge∣neral,
and the Wisdom, Fitness, and beautiful Con∣trivance
of particular Things, animated and inanima∣ted;
so that the Truth and Necessity of these <HI>Prin∣ciples</HI>
was so riveted in me (which may be seen by the
first Edition of my <HI>Philosophical Principles,</HI> published
some Years before that happen'd) as never after to be
shaken in all my Wanderings and Follies: And I had
then the Consolation to reflect, that in my loosest
Days, I had never <HI>pimp'd</HI> to the <HI>Vices</HI> or <HI>Infidelity</HI> of
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
any, but was always a determined Adversary to
both.</P>
<P>But I found, that these alone were not sufficient
to quiet my Mind at that Juncture, especially when
I began to consider seriously, whether I might not
(thro' <HI>Carelesness</HI> and <HI>Self-Sufficiency, Voluptuousness</HI>
and Love of <HI>Sensuality,</HI> which might have impaired
my <HI>Spiritual</HI> Nature) have neglected to examine
with sufficient Care; if there might not be more
required of those who had had proper <HI>Opportunities</HI>
and <HI>Leisure;</HI> if there might not, I say, be higher,
more noble, and more enlightening <HI>Principles</HI> re∣vealed
to Mankind <HI>some where;</HI> and if there were
not more encouraging and enlivening <HI>Motives</HI> propo∣sed,
to form a more extensive and <HI>heroic</HI> Virtue upon,
than those arising from <HI>Natural Religion</HI> only (for then
I had gone little farther than to have taken <HI>Christia∣nity</HI>
and <HI>Revelation</HI> on Trust) and lastly, if there were
not likewise some clearer Accounts discoverable of
that <HI>State</HI> I was then (I thought) apparently going
into, than could be obtained from the mere Light of
<HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Philosophy.</HI></P>
<P>Such were my Reflections in this my <HI>melancholy</HI> Re∣tirement;
and this led me to call to Mind, which of
all my numerous and various <HI>Acquaintances</HI> I could
wish to resemble most, now in these my (to me
seemingly approaching) last Moments; and who, a∣mong
all those of my particular Acquaintances, was
<HI>he,</HI> who being of sound <HI>natural,</HI> and duly <HI>cultivated</HI>
Parts, had most strictly and constantly liv'd up to
their Convictions under the commonly received Prin∣ciples,
and plain Consequencies of <HI>Christianity:</HI> In
a Word, who it was I could remember to have
received, and lived up to the plain Truths and
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
Precepts contain'd in the <HI>Gospels,</HI> or more particu∣larly
in our <HI>Saviour's Sermon</HI> on the <HI>Mount.</HI></P>
<P>At that Time, among many whom my Memo∣ry
suggested to me, I fix'd on one, a worthy and
learned <HI>Clergyman</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> suffici∣ently
known and distinguished in the <HI>Philosophical</HI>
and <HI>Theological</HI> World (whom I dare not name, be∣cause
he is still living, tho' now extremely old;)
and as in studying <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> and in running
over (as I was able) Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s <HI>Philosophical</HI>
Works, I had always pick'd out, and mark'd down,
the <HI>Authors</HI> and Writings mostly used and recom∣mended
by those others, and by Him, because I
thought they could best judge of such; so in this
Case, the more quickly to settle my Mind, and
quiet my Conscience, I resolved to purchase, study,
and examine carefully, such <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Dogmatick</HI>
Authors, as I knew this <HI>venerable Man</HI> did most
approve and delight in.</P>
<P>In this Manner I collected a Set of religious Books
and Writers, of most of the first Ages since <HI>Christi∣anity,</HI>
recommended by him, with a few others of the
most <HI>spiritual</HI> of the <HI>Moderns,</HI> which have been my
<HI>Study, Delight,</HI> and <HI>Entertainment,</HI> in my Retirements
ever since: And on these I have formed my <HI>Ideas,
Principles,</HI> and <HI>Sentiments;</HI> so as under all the Varie∣ties
of <HI>Opinions, Sects, Disputes,</HI> and <HI>Controversies,</HI>
that of late, and since the earliest Ages, have been
canvassed and bandied in the World, I have scarce e∣ver
since been the least shaken, or tempted to change
my Sentiments or Opinions, or so much as to hesitate
in any material Point.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10"/>
This tedious, perhaps, impertinent Circumstance
I mention, because the <HI>Fright, Anxiety, Dread,</HI> and
<HI>Terror,</HI> which, in Minds of such a Turn as mine (es∣pecially
under a broken and <HI>cachectick</HI> Constitution,
and in so atrocious a <HI>nervous</HI> Case) arises, or at least,
is exasperated from such Reflections, being once set∣led
and quieted, <HI>That</HI> after becomes an excellent <HI>Cor∣dial,</HI>
and a constant Source of <HI>Peace, Tranquillity,</HI> and
<HI>Chearfulness,</HI> and so greatly contributes to forward
the Cure of such <HI>nervous</HI> Diseases: For I never found
any sensible Tranquillity or Amendment, 'till I came
to this firm and setled Resolution in the main; <HI>viz.
To neglect nothing to secure my eternal Peace, more than
if I had been certified I should die within the Day; nor
to mind any Thing that my secular Obligations and Duties
demanded of me, less, than if I had been ensured to live
fifty Years more.</HI> This, tho' with infinite Weakness
and Imperfection, has been much my settled Intenti∣on
in the main since.</P>
<P><HI>After relating the</HI> Progress <HI>and</HI> Cure <HI>of his</HI> Distemp∣er,
<HI>for several Pages, he concludes,</HI> p. 363.</P>
<P>From the most extreme Misery, I do now enjoy as
<HI>perfect Health,</HI> as much <HI>Activity</HI> and <HI>Chearfulness,</HI> with
the full, free, and perfect Use of my <HI>Faculties;</HI> a Fa∣cility
of Study, and of going about the Business of
my <HI>Profession,</HI> and, in short, of every <HI>rational Functi∣on</HI>
of Life, as I was ever capable of in my best Days,
and indeed, of every Thing worth living for, as a
<HI>free</HI> and <HI>rational Intelligence:</HI> Every Thing, I say, ex∣cept
that I cannot eat and drink so highly and volup∣tuously
as I have formerly; and if I know my Heart
(which I am sure I do not fully) tho' I were to be <HI>e∣ternal</HI>
and <HI>unaccountable,</HI> I should live (at least wish to
live, in the main, and as to <HI>Diet</HI>) as I now do, and
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
would not willingly and deliberately go thro' the
same Misery, for the mere Gratification of my <HI>Senses</HI>
only; no, not to obtain the Dominion of our <HI>System,</HI>
and all the <HI>Glories</HI> and <HI>Pleasures</HI> in it.</P>
<P>What I may happen to do, God only knows; I
am too old, I hope, to make any new Trials and
Changes in this my bodily <HI>Regimen:</HI> And indeed, to
what Purpose? Being as well as any, and indeed bet∣ter
than most are, at my Time of Day: And there∣fore,
with God's Grace, if my <HI>Health, Senses,</HI> and
Love of <HI>Virtue,</HI> continue with me the same, I shall,
I hope, go on in the Method now described, and live,
and I hope die, in continual Gratitude to the <HI>best of
Beings,</HI> who, by an over-ruling <HI>Providence,</HI> and as it
were by mere <HI>casual Hints,</HI> far beyond the Reach of
my <HI>Penetration,</HI> has irresistibly (as I should almost say,
if I felt not my own <HI>Liberty</HI>) directed the great Steps
of my <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Health</HI> hitherto.</P>
<P>Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo.</P>
<P>Which (for the Sake of the <HI>English</HI> Reader) is to say.</P>
<P>I will sing the Mercies of the Lord for ever.</P>
<P><HI>He died at</HI> Bath, April 12, 1743. <HI>Aged</HI> 72. <HI>Since
which the following excellent</HI> CHARACTER <HI>has
been given of him.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>THE
CHARACTER
OF
Dr. CHEYNE.</HEAD>
<P>THE extraordinary Circumstances of his Life
in a medical Sense may be best collected from
his various Works.—As a Physician he
seemed to proceed, like <HI>Hippocrates</HI> of old
and <HI>Sydennam</HI> of late, upon a few perceptible Truths.
—He writ chiefly to the Studious, the Voluptu∣ous,
and those who inherited bad Constitutions from
their Parents, and consequently must have been
greatly misrepresented by those who needed not his
Aid, therefore ridicul'd him. A Man, who com∣bates
human Pleasures and Passions, will never want
Enemies.—That he might be mistaken in some
Parts may be readily allowed, but it plainly ap∣pears,
that he writ from the full Conviction of his
Heart.—But to come nearer to the Point, and
within the common Judgment of Mankind, his
<HI>System</HI> has a peculiar Tendency to promote <HI>Virtue</HI>
and <HI>Religion,</HI> to calm the Passions, refine the Mind,
and purify the Heart.</P>
<P>It has been the common, nay a proverbial Phrase,
to charge the Professors of Physic with Irreligion,
it is hoped, falsely: However, Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI> had a
peculiarly sincere and vital Warmth for <HI>Christianity.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
He considered it in the primitive Ages as it was
practised, and not in the present as 'tis taught.
He made his Writings all subservient to Virtue
and the Glory of God. He lost not his Creator
in the infinite Works of Creation; he lov'd the
Clergy, and was beloved by them. He died, as
he ever wish'd and besought God, calm and with∣out
a Pang. His last Hours were entirely spent
in Prayer, grounded on a full Confidence of <HI>Christ's</HI>
all-sufficient Merit.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>Dr. CHEYNE's
Own ACCOUNT of his
WRITINGS.</HEAD>
<P>THE first Time I adventured to appear in Print,
was on the Account of my great Master and
generous Friend, Dr. <HI>Pitcairn.</HI> He thought
himself ill-used by some of his Brethren of the Pro∣fession
who then were at intestine War on the Subject
of <HI>Fevers;</HI> and fancied the handsomest Way to bring
them down, was to exhibit a more specious Account
of this Disease, than any of them had shewn. His
Business then in the Practice of Physick was so great,
as not to allow him sufficient Time for such a Work.
Two others therefore, with myself, were joined to
manage the Affair: In which he was to cut and carve,
and to add the practical Part. My Province was the
Theory. I was then very young in the Profession,
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
and living in the Country. But in a few Days I brought
in my Part finished, as it now appears, under the Ti∣tle
of <HI>The New Theory of Fevers.</HI> The others either
suppress'd or forgot theirs; and mine, without the
least Alteration, but in a few Words, was order'd for
the Press. I could not resist the Commands of my
Friend; but would not suffer my Name to be put to
it, being conscious it was a raw and unexperienced
Performance. There are tho', some Things in it,
which may be of Use to Beginners, both as to the
Method of Philosophising on the Animal Oeconomy,
and in the Account of the Manner of the Operation
of the greater Medicines. The Foundations also and
the Causes assigned for acute and slow Fevers, I still
think solid and just, and more particular and limited
than those of any other <HI>Theory</HI> yet published. But it
wants so much filing and finishing, so many Alterati∣ons
and Additions, as would cost me more Labour
and Pains than the writing a new <HI>Treatise</HI> on the same
Subject: So that out of mere Laziness and Inappe∣tency,
I have thrown it by as unripe Fruit, and suf∣fered
it to be as if it never had been.</P>
<P>My next Sally was in a Book of abstracted Geo∣metry
and Algebra, entitled, <HI>Methodus Fluxionum in∣versa,</HI>
brought forth in Ambition and bred up in Va∣nity.
There are some Things in it tolerable for the
Time, when the Methods of Quadratures, the Men∣suration
of Ratio's, and Transformation of Curves,
into those of other Kinds, were not advanced to such
Heights as they now are. But it is a long Time since
I was forced to forgoe these barren and airy Studies
for more substantial and commodious Speculations:
Indulging and Rioting in these so exquisitely bewitch∣ing
Contemplations, being only proper for publick
Professors, and those born to E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ates, and who
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
are under no outward Necessities. Besides, to own
a great but grievous Truth, tho' they may quicken
and sharpen the Invention, strengthen and extend the
Imagination, improve and refine the reas'ning Facul∣ty,
and are of Use both in the necessary and the lux∣urious
Refinement of mechanical Arts; yet having
no Tendency to rectify the Will, sweeten the Tem∣per,
or mend the Heart, they often leave a Stiffness,
Positiveness, and Sufficiency on weak Minds, much
more pernicious to Society, and the Interests of the
great End of our Being, than all the Advantages
they bring them can recompence. They are indeed
Edge-Tools, not to be trusted in the Hands of any,
but those who have already acquired an humble Heart,
a lowly Spirit, and a sober and teachable Temper.
For in others they are very apt to beget a secret and
refined Pride, an over-weening and over-bearing Va∣nity
(the most opposite Temper to the true Gospel-Spirit,
which, without Offence, I may suppose to be
the best Disposition of Mind) that tempts them to
presume on a Kind of Omniscience, in Respect of
their Fellow-Creatures, that have not risen to their
Elevation; and to set up for an Infallibility, or at
least a decisive Judgment, even in Matters which do
not admit of a <HI>more</HI> or <HI>less</HI> (their proper Object) of
which Kind whatsoever relates to the infinite Author
of our Being most certainly is. Upon all which Ac∣counts,
conscious of my own Weakness, I have long
since bid them an Adieu, farther than as they serve
to amuse, or are useful in the absolute Necessities of
Life.</P>
<P>The Defence of that Book against the learned and
acute Mr. <HI>Abr. de Moivre,</HI> being written in a Spirit
of Levity and Resentment, I most sincerely retract,
and wish undone, so far as it is personal or peevish,
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
and ask him and the World Pardon for it; as I do
for the <HI>Defence</HI> of Dr. <HI>Pitcairn</HI>'s <HI>Dissertations,</HI> and the
<HI>New Theory of Fevers,</HI> against the late learned and in∣genious
Dr. <HI>Oliphant.</HI> I heartily condemn and detest
all personal Reflections, all malicious and unmannerly
Turns, and all false and unjust Repreientations, as
unbecoming Gentlemen, Scholars, and Christians;
and disprove and undo both Performances, as far as
in me lies, in every Thing that does not strictly and
barely relate to the Argument.</P>
<P>The first Part of the <HI>Philosophical Principles,</HI> that
of <HI>Natural Religion,</HI> consists merely of Discourses and
Lectures of <HI>Natural Philosophy,</HI> and of its Consequen∣ces
on <HI>Religion,</HI> occasionally read or discoursed to that
most noble and great Person, the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI>
so great an Ornament to his Country, and his high
Employments, to whom they were inscrib'd. I thought
they might be of Use to other young Gentlemen,
who, while they were learning the Elements of natu∣ral
Philosophy, might have thereby the Principles of
natural Religon insensibly instilled into them. And
accordingly it has been and still is used for that Purpose
at both Universities.</P>
<P>The second Part of the <HI>Philosophical Principles,</HI> to
wit, that of <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> was added afterward,
to shew, that all our Knowledge of Nature was by
Analogy, or the Relations of Things only, and not
their real Nature, Substance, or internal Principles:
That from this Method of Analogy (the only Medi∣um
of human Knowledge) we should be necessarily
led to conclude the Attributes or Qualities of the
supreme and absolute Infinite, were indeed analo∣gous
to the Properties or Qualities of finite Beings,
but only in such a Manner as the Difference bet∣ween
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
Infinite and Finite requires; and that there∣fore,
not being able to know precisely these Diffe∣rences,
we ought implicitely to believe without rea∣soning,
what is revealed to us concerning the Na∣ture
of the infinite Being; or bring our Reason to
submit to the Mysteries of Faith. How I have suc∣ceeded
is not for me to determine. As the End
was honest, I am secure the great Principles and
the fundamental Propositions are true and just.</P>
<P>The <HI>Essay on the Gout and</HI> Bath <HI>Waters</HI> was brought
forth by mere Accident. The first Draught being, as I
there mentioned, only a Paper of Directions for a
Gentleman, my Friend and Patient, troubled with
the Gout. It was enlarged upon different Occasions,
and published to prevent its being pyrated; several Co∣pies
having been given out to others in the same Cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>As to my <HI>Essay of Health and Long Life,</HI> its Ori∣gin
was as casual as that of my former. My good and
worthy Friend, Sir <HI>Joseph Jekyl,</HI> having been at <HI>Bath</HI>
for a Confirmation of his Health, at his Departure
desired me to draw up some Instructions in Writing
to direct him in the Conduct of his Health for the
future, and in the Manner of supporting his Spirits
free and full, under the great Business he was engag'd
in. I was then in the Hurry of our Season, and could
not so soon answer his Expectation, as his real Worth,
and my sincere Esteem required. I thought myself
therefore the more obliged, as soon as I had Leisure,
to exert myself to the uttermost in Obedience to his
Commands. At first I drew up most of these Rules
at the End of the several Chapters; but, upon Re∣flection,
thought it not Respect enough to his good
Taste and Capacity to judge of the Reasons of Things,
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
to prescribe him bare and dry Directions in Matters of so
great Moment. I added therefore the philosophical
Account and Reasons of these Rules, which make up the
Bulk of the Chapters themselves. He, out of Love to
his Fellow-Citizens (which was one shining Part of his
Character, and which I ought to suppose had in this
Instance only imposed on his better Judgment) de∣sired
they might be made publick. Upon which Ac∣count
several Things have been since added, to make
the whole of more general Use. If therefore any
Thing in this Treatise be tolerable, or if any Person
receive Benefit by it, they owe it entirely to that ex∣cellent
Person, upon whose Account solely it was un∣dertaken,
and at whose Request it is published.</P>
<P>I know not what may be the Fate and Success of
this Performance; nor am I sollicitous about it, being
conscious the Design was honest, the Subject weighty,
and the Execution the best my Time, my Abilities,
and my Health would permit, which cannot bear the
Labour of much Fileing and Finishing. Being careful
not to incroach on the Province of the Physician, I
have concealed nothing my Knowledge could suggest to
direct the Sufferer, in the best Manner I could, to pre∣serve
his Health, and lengthen out his Life: And I have
held out no false or delusory Lights to lead him astray,
or torment him unnecessarily.</P>
<P>If it were possible any Set of Men could be offend∣ed
at my Performance, it might be my Brethren of
the Profession, for endeavouring to lessen the <HI>Materia
Morbifica.</HI> But as this would be the most malicious,
unjust, and unworthy Reflection could be thrown on
Scholars and Gentlemen of a liberal Education; so I
never entertain'd the most remote Vanity to think a∣ny
Endeavour of mine would make so considerable a
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
Change in the Nation; especially when the Devil, the
World, and the Flesh were on the other Side of the
Question, which have stood their Ground even against
the Rules of Life and Immortality brought to Light
by the <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>All I can say as an Apology is, that of whatsoever
Indifference my Concerns as an Author may be to my
Reader, yet they were not so to me; this being the
only Place and Time I may have to adjust them in,
and it being the Heighth of my Ambition,</P>
<P>Nil conscire mini, nulla pallescere culpa.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>The above</HI> ACCOUNT <HI>of the foregoing</HI>
Articles <HI>is taken from the</HI> Essay of Health and Long
Life, <HI>to which it is prefix'd. What has been publish'd
since are as follow, with the</HI> Doctor's <HI>own</HI> Account <HI>of
them subjoin'd,</HI> viz.</P>
<DIV2>
<P>I. <HI>The</HI> English Malady: <HI>Or, a</HI> Treatise <HI>of</HI> Ner∣vous
Diseases <HI>of all Kinds. In</HI> Three Parts.</P>
<P><HI>THE Title</HI> I have chosen for this <HI>Treatise,</HI> is a <HI>Re∣proach</HI>
universally thrown on this <HI>Island</HI> by Fo∣reigners,
and all our Neighbours on the <HI>Continent,</HI> by
whom <HI>nervous</HI> Distempers, <HI>Spleen, Vapours,</HI> and <HI>Low∣ness
of Spirits,</HI> are in Derision, called the ENGLISH
MALADY. And I wish there were not so good
Grounds for this Reflection. The <HI>Moisture</HI> of our <HI>Air,</HI>
the Variableness of our <HI>Weather,</HI> (from our Situation
amidst the <HI>Ocean</HI>) the <HI>Rankness</HI> and <HI>Fertility</HI> of our
Soil, the <HI>Richness</HI> and <HI>Heaviness</HI> of our Food, the
<HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Abundance</HI> of the Inhabitants, (from
their universal Trade) the <HI>Inactivity</HI> and <HI>sedentary</HI>
Occupations of the better Sort, (among whom
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
this <HI>Evil</HI> mostly rages) and the Humour of living in
great, populous, and consequently unhealthy Towns,
have brought forth a <HI>Class</HI> and <HI>Set</HI> of Distempers, with
atrocious and frightful <HI>Symptoms,</HI> scarce known to our
Ancestors, and never rising to such fatal <HI>Heights,</HI> nor
afflicting such <HI>Numbers</HI> in any other known Nation.
These <HI>nervous</HI> Disorders being computed to make al∣most
one <HI>Third</HI> of the Complaints of the People of
<HI>Condition</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Work</HI> has lain finish'd by me, as it now ap∣pears
(at least in the main) these several Years past,
and was intended as a <HI>Legacy</HI> and <HI>Dying-Speech,</HI> only
to my <HI>Fellow-Sufferers</HI> under these Complaints. And
had certainly never appear'd, (till its Author had dis∣appear'd)
had it not been for the perhaps indiscreet
<HI>Zeal</HI> of some of my warmest Friends, who (upon the
late Frequency and daily Encrease of wanton and un∣common
Self murderers, produc'd mostly by this <HI>Di∣stemper,</HI>
and their <HI>blasphemous</HI> and <HI>frantick Apologies</HI>
grafted on the Principles of the <HI>Infidels,</HI> and propa∣gated
by their <HI>Disciples</HI>) extorted it from me, to try
what a little more just and solid <HI>Philosophy,</HI> join'd to
a Method of <HI>Cure,</HI> and proper Medicines could do,
to put a Stop to so universal a <HI>Lunacy</HI> and <HI>Madness.</HI></P>
<P>What I pretend to have done in some Degree in
the following Treatise, is, That I hope I have ex∣plain'd
the Nature and Causes of <HI>Nervous Distempers</HI>
(which have hitherto been reckon'd <HI>Witchcraft, En∣chantment,
Sorcery</HI> and <HI>Possession,</HI> and have been the
constant Resource of Ignorance) from Principles ea∣sy,
natural and intelligible, deduc'd from the best and
soundest <HI>Natural Philosophy;</HI> and have by the plainest
Reasoning, drawn from these <HI>Causes</HI> and this <HI>Philoso∣phy,</HI>
a <HI>Method of Cure</HI> and a <HI>Course of Medicines</HI> spe∣cisically
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
obviating these Causes, confirm'd by long Ex∣perience
and repeated Observations, and conformable
to the Practice of the ablest and best Writers on these
Diseases.</P>
<P>There are two Sorts of Readers I have not the most
remote Hopes of convincing or giving Satisfaction to;
<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Voluptuous</HI> and <HI>Unthinking.</HI> Those who value
Life only for the Sake of <HI>good Eating</HI> and <HI>Drinking,</HI>
and those whose <HI>thinking</HI> Faculties and <HI>Organs</HI> have
never been truly <HI>form'd</HI> or duly <HI>cultivated;</HI> neither of
<HI>these</HI> will ever bear or can receive any Conviction or
Reasoning from such <HI>Principles</HI> as I lay down. But
the <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> and the immutable <HI>Relations of
Things,</HI> are too stubborn to bend to such <HI>Gentlemen;</HI>
and I should not chuse to study such a Sort of <HI>Parti∣culars,</HI>
to learn uncorrupted Nature, its <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Or∣der,</HI>
no more than I should apply to a <HI>monstrous Pro∣duction</HI>
to learn the <HI>Genius</HI> of a <HI>Tribe,</HI> or a <HI>Species</HI> ei∣ther
of <HI>Vegetables</HI> or <HI>Animals.</HI> Possibly even they them∣selves
may be convinc'd at least in some Measure,
when their <HI>proper Time</HI> is come; and sooner or later
it may come, unless the <HI>Minute Philosophy</HI> prevail,
and become the <HI>Standard.</HI> For probably when they
begin to feel violent <HI>Pain,</HI> long <HI>Sickness,</HI> habitual <HI>Low
Spirits,</HI> or enter upon the <HI>Limits of both Worlds,</HI> they
may be convinced. For, in the main, I believe the
Cause of these Distempers here assign'd, <HI>just</HI> and <HI>ade∣quate,</HI>
and on the Success of the <HI>Methods of Cure</HI> laid
down in general (in Cases where any thing would suc∣ceed)
I could venture my <HI>Reputation, Fortune</HI> and <HI>Life.</HI></P>
<P>If any of your <HI>Authors</HI> without <HI>Names,</HI> who would
in the Dark; your <HI>Hackney-Scriblers,</HI> who want only
to give their <HI>Lucubrations</HI> Sale; your <HI>profane</HI> and <HI>bold

what Side of the Question soever it lies, has any <HI>Dif∣ficulties</HI>
or <HI>Doubts,</HI> he may find some one or other who
may give him all the Satisfaction he can desire; if it

<HEAD>II. An Essay on Regimen. Together with Five
Discourses, Medical, Moral, and Philosophical.</HEAD>
<P>THE following <HI>Essay</HI> was written to instruct all
sober and serious Persons, how to preserve, or
regain their Health; but chiefly to direct and relieve
my <HI>Fellow-sufferers,</HI> the <HI>Scorbutic, Gouty, Consumptive,</HI>
or <HI>Nervous</HI> Valetudinarian-low-livers; to make them
pass their Lives the most comfortably, the <HI>Degree</HI> of
their Distempers, the <HI>Time</HI> of Life, the <HI>Nature</HI> of
Things, and the secret Orders of <HI>Providence,</HI> will per∣mit.
And since they must be deprived, in some De∣gree,
of the <HI>grosser</HI> sensual Pleasures; since all sentient
and <HI>intelligent</HI> Beings are made for Happiness, will by
mere <HI>Instinct,</HI> seek it <HI>some-how,</HI> and <HI>some-where;</HI> since
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
their necessary <HI>Low-living</HI> will naturally (in time at
least) make them <HI>high-spirited,</HI> and their <HI>intellectual
Organs</HI> more <HI>acute, penetrating,</HI> and <HI>delicate;</HI> I have
endeavour'd, by the following <HI>Discourses,</HI> to supply
them with some suitable <HI>Entertainments</HI> and <HI>Amuse∣ments,</HI>
such as I have often agreeably diverted my lei∣sure
Hours with.</P>
<P>I am very sensible, by this Work, I shall make
myself obnoxious to <HI>two</HI> very different Kinds of Men,
the <HI>Stiff, Rigid,</HI> and <HI>Precise;</HI> and the <HI>Licentious, Un∣guarded,
Spurious, Free-Thinkers.</HI> The <HI>first,</HI> very pro∣bably,
will censure my <HI>Conjectures</HI> and <HI>Sentiments,</HI> as
<HI>dangerous</HI> and <HI>presumptuous,</HI> and <HI>myself,</HI> as being <HI>wise
above what is written,</HI> and arrogantly prying into the
<HI>Secrets</HI> of infinit Wisdom. It is very possible I may
have been <HI>faulty,</HI> in this particular. I am sensible,
that some even undoubted <HI>Truths,</HI> that may hurt the
<HI>Weak,</HI> ought to be concealed, or enjoy'd only in <HI>se∣cret;</HI>
the same Degrees of <HI>Light</HI> not being equally <HI>lu∣minous</HI>
and <HI>perceptive</HI> to all <HI>Eyes.</HI> But since <HI>old Men,</HI>
and Valetudinarians especially, become, as it were,
<HI>Children</HI> a second Time, and, in their <HI>second Childhood,
those</HI> must have their <HI>Rattles</HI> as well as <HI>these;</HI> I thought
it safer, as I am sure it is much more entertaining, to
play with <HI>Ideas, philosophic Conjectures,</HI> and such <HI>A∣musements,</HI>
how weakly soever founded, as tend to
make <HI>Virtue</HI> and its <HI>Sourse</HI> amiable, justify the <HI>Conduct
of Providence,</HI> and mend and rejoice the <HI>Heart</HI> with∣out
hurting the <HI>Head,</HI> than to dwell on the dark Side
of Things, that lead to <HI>Pyrrhonism, Fatalism, Infide∣lity,</HI>
and <HI>Despair.</HI> If I thought I had advanced any
thing <HI>derogatory</HI> from the <HI>Amiableness</HI> of infinit Per∣fection,
<HI>contrary</HI> to the Doctrine of the earliest and
purest Times of <HI>Christianity, contradictory</HI> to the <HI>Ana∣logy</HI>
of Faith, and the <HI>Form of sound Words,</HI> I had
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
committed these <HI>Sheets</HI> to the <HI>Flames,</HI> with the <HI>Hand</HI>
of their <HI>Author,</HI> before I had published them. But,
on the contrary, I hoped they might agreeably enter∣tain
my <HI>Valetudinarian,</HI> who being placed by his low
Health, in the <HI>middle State,</HI> between both <HI>Worlds,</HI> the
<HI>old</HI> and the <HI>new,</HI> must unavoidably, at some Times,
<HI>figure</HI> to himself some Sort of a <HI>Map</HI> of the next
World. I was therefore willing to try to <HI>illuminat</HI> it,
the best I could, and to trace some of the <HI>Out-lines</HI> of
the <HI>Passages</HI> from <HI>this</HI> to <HI>that Mansion;</HI> by endeavour∣ing
to <HI>illustrat,</HI> from not so common a Set of <HI>Princi∣ples</HI>
and <HI>Philosophy,</HI> some great and fundamental <HI>Truths,</HI>
establish'd on more <HI>popular Proofs,</HI> viz. that there is
no Possibility of Happiness here or hereafter, without
<HI>Purity</HI> of <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Life;</HI> and that the true <HI>Reason</HI> of
the present <HI>Darkness,</HI> both in <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Revelati∣on,</HI>
is the Difficulty of recovering this <HI>Purity of Heart
and Life,</HI> to its utmost Perfection, in free <HI>lapsed</HI> Intel∣ligences,
consistent with their <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Har∣mony</HI>
of the Divine Attributes, which infinit <HI>Power</HI>
and <HI>Wisdom</HI> will not, I might say, cannot, counteract.</P>
<P>I apprehend less Quarter from the opposit <HI>Set</HI> of
Men, who may honour me with <HI>Enthusiasm, Roman∣ceing,</HI>
and <HI>Castle-building,</HI> without any solid Foundati∣on.
All I have to say is, that perhaps my Manner of
explaining some great Truths, and a few of the Con∣sequences
I draw by my <HI>Method,</HI> may be defective:
And perhaps, from some of the <HI>Links</HI> being dropt,
and from Faults in the <HI>wording,</HI> the <HI>Chain</HI> of the Rea∣soning
may not be always <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>strong;</HI> but I am
sure the <HI>Foundation</HI> is <HI>solid</HI> and <HI>just,</HI> and allowed to be
such by all <HI>true Philosophers;</HI> and without it, all <HI>gene∣ral</HI>
and <HI>abstracted</HI> Reasoning (on these <HI>imperceptible</HI>
Subjects) must be vain; I mean, without admitting
<HI>Analogy:</HI> For without supposing the Evidence and Pro∣bability
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
of it, (it being in <HI>Things</HI> only, what <HI>Proporti∣on</HI>
is in <HI>Numbers,</HI> and its <HI>Progressions</HI> being only like
the higher and subsequent Terms of a <HI>Series</HI> in <HI>Alge∣bra,</HI>
from some of the first and simplest <HI>Terms</HI> being
given) no <HI>general Laws,</HI> nor <HI>universal Propositions,</HI> can
be found out, in <HI>Mathematicks, Philosophy,</HI> or <HI>Morali∣ty.</HI>
For <HI>Induction,</HI> either in <HI>Experiment, Observation,</HI>
or <HI>Calculation,</HI> must be always <HI>particular</HI> and limited.
Perhaps the <HI>Method,</HI> when manag'd by a <HI>clearer Head,</HI>
and a more <HI>solid Judgment,</HI> may become a noble <HI>Source</HI>
of <HI>divine Knowledge,</HI> and a <HI>sublime Philosophy. Mathe∣matitians</HI>
well know, that there are several different
<HI>Methods</HI> of investigating the same Propositions in <HI>Al∣gebra</HI>
and <HI>Geometry;</HI> and there is scarce a <HI>Geometer,</HI> but
has his own <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Investigation.</HI> The same Con∣clusions,
drawn from different demonstrated <HI>Truths,</HI>
give a <HI>sensible Pleasure,</HI> and a stronger <HI>Conviction,</HI> to an
honest Heart, and a Lover of Truth; and I could
not but be delighted with the <HI>Universality, Simplicity,</HI>
and <HI>Luminousness</HI> of the <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Analogy,</HI> and the
other Principles I have laid down in the following
<HI>Discourses,</HI> not having met with an <HI>Objection, Difficul∣ty,</HI>
or even a <HI>Puzzle</HI> almost, in <HI>Nature, Providence,</HI> or
<HI>Revelation,</HI> which had not an easy, consequential or
probable Solution from them, which is, at least, a
Prejudice in their Favour. I had nothing to do, but
to try the <HI>Difficulty,</HI> in its most simple and obvious
Cases, (as I used to do in <HI>Algebra,</HI> to find out <HI>univer∣sal
Canons</HI>) and attentively to observe the Conditions
of the <HI>Progression,</HI> till the higher Terms involved the
Complication.</P>
<P>There are some Persons made so by <HI>Nature,</HI> that
they are <HI>slow, dark, gloomy, joyless, puzzling,</HI> and <HI>per∣plexing,</HI>
and they pass for the wise, prudent, guarded
Men of the <HI>World:</HI> They may attack <HI>Error,</HI> but sel∣dom
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
find out <HI>Truth</HI> by themselves; like the <HI>Scuttle∣fish,</HI>
they spout out their own <HI>black Liquor</HI> on the <HI>pellu∣cid
Element.</HI> If they are <HI>honest</HI> and <HI>sincere,</HI> they are
much to be pitied, and are to be treated with <HI>Huma∣nity</HI>
and <HI>Charity,</HI> being in the State of those born <HI>poor</HI>
and <HI>blind,</HI> and so destitute of the Necessaries and Con∣veniences
of Life. They must do the best they can,
and be charitably supplied, and with Docility be wil∣ling
to be led by others; and thus, tho' their Trial
might be <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>severe,</HI> yet their Victory would be
<HI>meritorious</HI> and <HI>glorious.</HI> But, on the contrary, it of∣ten
happens, that <HI>Licentiousness, Self-sufficiency,</HI> and a
supercilious Contempt of others, are the true Causes
of their <HI>Darkness</HI> and <HI>Indigence,</HI> and that they have
themselves, by wrong or no Culture, stunted the <HI>Or∣gans</HI>
of their Faculties, and by a perpetual <HI>Mal-regi∣men</HI>
have distorted them.</P>
<P>I take <HI>common Happiness,</HI> in our natural State at pre∣sent,
to lie in the Pursuit of the general Measures of
Thinking, Acting and Living, follow'd by the great∣est
Part of the middling Rank of our <HI>Species</HI> (as it is
in their Order in other <HI>Animals</HI>); and <HI>common Sense</HI>
(as it is distinguished from cultivated and refin'd
Sense) to lie in assenting and conforming to the <HI>Truths</HI>
and <HI>Manners,</HI> agreed upon explicitely or implicitely,
in the <HI>Community</HI> where Providence has placed us,
without some <HI>irresistible,</HI> that is, <HI>miraculous</HI> Evidence,
or a <HI>peaceable, silent,</HI> and not <HI>intermeddling</HI> Self-convic∣tion
to the contrary. And he who pretends to be <HI>hap∣py,</HI>
as to his outward Circumstances, out of <HI>common
Life,</HI> or <HI>wise</HI> as to intellectual Endowments, out of
<HI>common Sense,</HI> in Things on a Level with his <HI>Occupa∣tion</HI>
and <HI>Education;</HI> I take him always to labour un∣der
some undiscover'd <HI>chronical nervous</HI> Distemper, be
the other Appearances what they will, and have been
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
seldom mistaken in a <HI>particular Case.</HI> For tho' a <HI>sound
Mind</HI> be not the <HI>only</HI> sure Evidence of a <HI>sound Body,</HI>
yet it will always shew, that none of the great <HI>Or∣gans</HI>
of Life are intirely spoilt, or greatly <HI>damaged,</HI>
however tender and delicate they may be. It is more
difficult, than perhaps most Men are aware of, to de∣termin,
with any Degree of Exactness, the <HI>Limits</HI>
that separat <HI>Wisdom</HI> from <HI>Folly, Wrong-headedness</HI> from
<HI>intellectual Sanity;</HI> the most perfect Man here has a
<HI>Mixture</HI> of both: <HI>Optimus ille, qui minimis urgetur.</HI>
Certain it is, that <HI>true Wisdom,</HI> and a <HI>sound Mind,</HI> con∣sists
in first <HI>pondering,</HI> and then <HI>doing,</HI> every thing as
near as we can, with <HI>Order, Number, Weight</HI> and <HI>Mea∣sure:</HI>
But since <HI>Precision</HI> is incompatible with <HI>Finitude,</HI>
if we endeavour to be constantly <HI>progressive</HI> towards
Perfection, tho' by gentle Steps, neither stopping nor
turning aside, but doing the best we can without <HI>Scru∣pulosity,</HI>
and generously hopeing and believing, that
infinit Wisdom and Goodness has, or will supply the
<HI>rest,</HI> in his own Time and Manner, <HI>we cannot fail.</HI></P>
<P>Were I to <HI>choose</HI> for myself, considering the many
certain <HI>Miseries</HI> and Temptations of this State of
<HI>Probation,</HI> the <HI>few</HI> uncertain <HI>Antidotes,</HI> and much <HI>few∣er</HI>
sincere, durable, and real <HI>Pleasures;</HI> I had much
rather have the weaker, than the stronger <HI>System</HI> of
Nerves, within the <HI>Extremes.</HI> I had rather choose to
be contented with the <HI>slight</HI> and <HI>slender,</HI> than covet the
strong and <HI>pungent</HI> Pleasures. I had rather be happy
in a <HI>Dream,</HI> than miserable <HI>awake.</HI> In a word, I had
rather choose to be an innocent, benevolent, tho'
weaker and more <HI>credulous</HI> Person, than a <HI>malicious,
critical, spurious Free-thinker,</HI> even with Regard to
this Life only. They most certainly are <HI>comparative∣ly,
unhappy,</HI> and <HI>joyless</HI> in themselves, and are <HI>unhar∣moniously</HI>
fram'd, in <HI>Body</HI> as well as <HI>Mind,</HI> who can

delight, and employ their <HI>Talents,</HI> on throwing <HI>Dark∣ness</HI>
and <HI>Doubts</HI> even on the imaginary Happiness
(suppose it such) of their <HI>Fellow-Creatures:</HI> Nothing
but <HI>Rancour,</HI> and <HI>acrid Juices,</HI> could be pleased with
tearing and destroying <HI>Childrens Play-things;</HI> and the
wisest Man here is comparatively but a <HI>Child.</HI></P>
<P>As to myself, I can <HI>honestly affirm,</HI> I have had but
<HI>one</HI> uniform Manner of thinking in <HI>Philosophy, Physic,</HI>
and <HI>Divinity,</HI> in the main, ever since my Thoughts
were <HI>fix'd,</HI> and my Principles <HI>establish'd:</HI> They may
have had <HI>Alternatives</HI> of greater <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Darkness,</HI>
occasionally and transiently, according to the <HI>State</HI> of
my <HI>Spirits, Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Experience;</HI> but in the
<HI>Heart of my Soul</HI> (so to speak) I have been uniform,
and under the same <HI>Convictions,</HI> as to the <HI>Fundamental,</HI>
of these <HI>Sciences;</HI> and always thought <HI>spurious Free-Thinkers,
active Latitudinarians,</HI> and <HI>Apostolic Infidels</HI>
(it being a Contra <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iction they can be certain in their

an infinit deal of Hurt) under some obstinat bodily
Distemper, and much more proper Subjects for <HI>Me∣dicin,</HI>
than <HI>Argument;</HI> and that a <HI>low Diet,</HI> long and
obstinatly persisted in, would at last cure both thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Body and their Mind, so far as it depends on the Bo∣dy,
especially where Vice and Infidelity have not be

As I firmly believe, and am as much convinced as
am of any natural Effect, that Water-drinking only
will preserve all the Opulent healthy from every mor∣tal
Distemper, bateing Accidents, hereditary and epi∣demical
Diseases; and that a Diet of Milk and Seeds
with Water-drinking only, duly continued, and pru∣dently
managed, with proper Evacuation, Air, and
Exercise, is the most infallible <HI>Antidote</HI> for all the ob∣stinat
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
Diseases of the Body, and Distemperatures of
the Mind, so far as it depends on the Body, the pre∣sent
State of Things will permit; and that it will
cure every Disorder in the Body, cureable, and ren∣der
the <HI>Distemperature</HI> of the Mind more tractable;
and that, in all Events, it will make both more tole∣rable,
than they can possibly be otherwise.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>At the End of the</HI> Practical Essay <HI>on the</HI> Re∣gimen
<HI>of</HI> Diet, &amp;c. <HI>he concludes with the following use∣ful</HI>
Aphorisms, <HI>which we shall here beg Leave to trans∣cribe,
for the Benefit of those who may have not yet seen
that Book, and as a</HI> Specimen <HI>of the whole.</HI> viz.</P>
<P>I. A Constant Endeavour after the <HI>lightest</HI> and
the <HI>least</HI> of Meat and Drink a Man can be
tolerably easy under, is the <HI>shortest</HI> and most infallible
<HI>Mean</HI> to preserve <HI>Life, Health,</HI> and <HI>Serenity.</HI></P>
<P>II. He that would preserve a <HI>clear Head,</HI> and equal
Spirits, must keep his <HI>Stomach</HI> clean, his <HI>Bowels</HI> mo∣deratly
empty and uncomprest.</P>
<P>III. On <HI>bad Nights, Lowness, Flatulence</HI> and Op∣pression
of <HI>Spirits,</HI> of any Continuance, the only cer∣tain
<HI>Reliefs</HI> are, a small <HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> a gentle <HI>Vomit,</HI> a
<HI>domestic Purge, rideing</HI> a Horse-back, and a <HI>Regimen</HI> of
the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI> persisted in.</P>
<P>IV. Small frequent <HI>Phlebotomies</HI> are the quickest and
most effectual Mean to mend the <HI>Blood,</HI> and to cure
<HI>Cachochymy,</HI> if a <HI>Regimen</HI> of the lightest and least be
joined.</P>
<P>V. Gentle and repeated Evacuation upwards and
downwards, (especially, and perhaps only, <HI>Vomits</HI>) by
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
the Medicines most familiar and experienced, (the
<HI>Action</HI> and Exercise of Vomiting is its chief Use) are
the <HI>surest, quickest,</HI> and most effectual Mean to prevent
or remedy the ill Effects of Gluttony, Over-loading,
and Repletion, (that is, almost all chronical Distem∣pers)
provided the <HI>lightest</HI> and the least be join'd
afterwards.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>Diseases</HI> are always to be cured by their <HI>Con∣traries,</HI>
the <HI>high Diet</HI> by the <HI>low,</HI> the <HI>hot</HI> by the <HI>cool,</HI>
the <HI>sapid</HI> by the <HI>insipid,</HI> the <HI>thiek</HI> and gross by the <HI>thin</HI>
and poor, <HI>Repletion</HI> by <HI>Fasting, Inactivity</HI> by <HI>Exercise.</HI>
Health acquir'd and possessed lies in the middle Re∣gimen,
between these two <HI>Extremes.</HI></P>
<P>VII. <HI>Perfect Health</HI> and <HI>good Spirits</HI> depend chiefly,
if not only, on the easy and pleasant Play or Perfor∣mance
of the <HI>Animal Functions, viz.</HI> the <HI>Digestion, Cir∣culation,
Respiration, Perspiration, muscular Motion,</HI>
and the <HI>Secretions.</HI></P>
<P>VIII. He that would be soon <HI>well,</HI> must be long <HI>sick,</HI>
that is, treat himself as a <HI>Valetudinarian</HI> in most things.</P>
<P>IX. <HI>Exercise</HI> and <HI>gentle Evacuation</HI> will supply the
Place of <HI>Abstinence,</HI> and <HI>Abstinence</HI> will supply the
Place of <HI>Evacuation;</HI> but the first two are still prefera∣ble,
because they damage the <HI>Solids</HI> least.</P>
<P>X. <HI>Quantity</HI> in Food will supply <HI>Quality,</HI> and <HI>Qua∣lity</HI>
will supply the Place of <HI>Quantity;</HI> but in very bad
Cases it is most secure to join <HI>both.</HI></P>
<P>XI. There is but little in a <HI>specifick Regimen</HI> of <HI>Di∣et</HI>
to remedy or antidot a <HI>specifick Distemper; Abstinence</HI>
in general, or a constant Endeavour after the <HI>lightest</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
and the <HI>least,</HI> will constantly supply the Place of any
<HI>specific</HI> particular <HI>Regimen</HI> of Diet: But in very bad
Cases, a particular <HI>Choice</HI> of the most <HI>specific Regimen</HI>
that <HI>Art, Experience</HI> and <HI>Philosophy</HI> shew to be most
proper, is not to be neglected.</P>
<P>XII. The <HI>Regimen of Diet</HI> by which one is cured
of a particular Distemper, ought to be continued, at
least in some Degree, especially if the Person is not
much under <HI>Fifty,</HI> else the Distemper will return with
more severe and worse <HI>Symptoms</HI> than at first, as <HI>Ex∣perience</HI>
has constantly shew'd.</P>
<P>XIII. Every <HI>wise</HI> Man, after <HI>Fifty,</HI> ought to begin
to lessen at least the <HI>Quantity</HI> of his <HI>Aliment;</HI> and if he
would continue free of great and dangerous Distemp∣ers,
and preserve his <HI>Senses</HI> and <HI>Faculties</HI> clear to the
<HI>last,</HI> he ought every seven Year go on, abateing gra∣dually
and sensibly, and at last <HI>descend</HI> out of Life as
he <HI>ascended</HI> into it, even into the Child's Diet.</P>
<P>XIV. He that is <HI>old</HI> when he is young, that is,
treats himself as a wise <HI>old Man</HI> does, or ought to do,
by great <HI>Temperance, Air</HI> and <HI>Exercise,</HI> if he lives past
Thirty-five, will be young when he grows old in Years.</P>
<P>XV. No Person of any Fortune ever died, or suf∣fer'd
<HI>acute</HI> Pains, or mortal Distempers, by the <HI>too
cool, too little,</HI> or too <HI>insipid</HI> in Diet; all by the <HI>too hot,
high</HI> and <HI>savoury:</HI> But Virtue and Health lie in the
<HI>golden Mean,</HI> so difficult to be found, and only to be
secur'd by the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI> a Man can be tole∣rably
easy under.</P>
<P>XVI. The eternal <HI>Law</HI> of Nature, by intense Pai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in <HI>Craveing</HI> and <HI>Hunger,</HI> will never suffer a Person in
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
his right Senses to go on long obstinatly, and to his
Hurt, in the <HI>too little.</HI></P>
<P>XVII. <HI>Water pure, clear and insipid,</HI> is the sole <HI>Be∣verage</HI>
that can procure or continue <HI>Health,</HI> and a <HI>clear
Head,</HI> being the <HI>sole</HI> Fluid that will pass through the
smallest animal <HI>Tubes</HI> without Resistance; next to it
are <HI>aqueous,</HI> or weak fermented Liquors.</P>
<P>XVIII. <HI>Water tepid or cold,</HI> or impregnated with
the <HI>specific Vegetables,</HI> or <HI>Minerals,</HI> that Experience
has found proper to <HI>antidot</HI> a given Distemper, is the
true <HI>Panacea</HI> in both <HI>acute</HI> and <HI>chronical Distempers:</HI>
Nature has prepared no other <HI>Medicin</HI> for us, but Wa∣ter
impregnated with <HI>Vegetables</HI> in their <HI>Juices,</HI> or na∣tural
<HI>Mineral</HI> Waters on the Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P>XIX. <HI>Milk</HI> is the only <HI>Food</HI> prepared by Nature
for young, that is, weak and tender <HI>animal</HI> Bodies;
and there is no real Difference between a <HI>young, tender,
animal Body,</HI> and a diseased grown <HI>Animal,</HI> but that,
of the <HI>two,</HI> the <HI>last</HI> is the worst; but it will cost La∣bour
and Patience to make <HI>Milk</HI> agree in <HI>bilious</HI> Cases.</P>
<P>XX. <HI>Milk</HI> and sweet sound Blood differ in nothing
but in <HI>Colour: Milk</HI> is <HI>Blood,</HI> which almost directly
comes from the Chyle into the Teats of the <HI>Animal;</HI>
and <HI>Blood</HI> is <HI>Milk</HI> which has gone many Rounds in the
<HI>Circulation,</HI> and is ground a little in the <HI>Lungs,</HI> where
being mixt with the <HI>Nitre</HI> of the Air, it receives its
<HI>Scarlet</HI> Colour; it is a Medium between <HI>animal</HI> and
<HI>vegetable</HI> Food.</P>
<P>XXI. <HI>Whey</HI> sweet, or medicated with the Juice of
any <HI>specific</HI> Plant, Sage, Balm, or Orange, or anti∣scorbutic,
vulnerary, or pulmonic Plants, will supply
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>
the Place, and are preferable to most Decoctions, of
Plants, Infusions, <HI>Apozems</HI> and <HI>Diet-Drinks</HI> whatso∣ever,
except those of the strong Detergents, as <HI>Horse-Radish,
Mustard-Seed,</HI> and the like, where necessary.</P>
<P>XXII. <HI>Goats Whey</HI> being a natural Infusion from
gentle Heat, and gentle <HI>Triture,</HI> of the fine <HI>aromatic</HI>
and <HI>nitrous</HI> Vegetables on which <HI>Goats</HI> feed only, is
one of the very best Diluents, Detergents, Cleansers
and Sweetners of <HI>scorbutic</HI> and <HI>salin Cachochymies.</HI></P>
<P>XXIII. <HI>Friction</HI> Morning and Night, and in Win∣ter
Washing with warm, and Drying before a Fire,
and in Summer with cold Water, is an excellent <HI>Mean</HI>
to facilitat and promote the Perspiration; to clean the
<HI>Cuticle,</HI> and cure <HI>cutaneous</HI> Uncleanness and <HI>Defedati∣ons,
cold Batheing</HI> is excellent, and preferable to every
Washing in Cases where the Blood is sweet and thin,
the Solids too lax only.</P>
<P>XXIV. <HI>Cincture</HI> with a broad quilted Belt about
the Loins, to keep the <HI>Bowels</HI> in their natural Situati∣ons,
and the <HI>chylous Vessels</HI> in their best <HI>Locality,</HI> and
in flabby Constitutions, weak <HI>Bowels</HI> and <HI>Atrophies,</HI>
is of great Benefit.</P>
<P>XXV. <HI>Rideing</HI> is the best of all Exercises to get
Health, and to promote the <HI>Digestions,</HI> especially in
<HI>nervous Distempers,</HI> where the <HI>Abdomen</HI> and the <HI>Mese∣raic
Glands</HI> are principally affected: But <HI>Walking</HI> is best
to preserve Health already got, because it is the most
natural, and the most universal Promoter of all the
Excretions.</P>
<P>XXVI. In <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Art</HI> there is no such immedi∣at
Cure for low Spirits, Anxiety, and Want of Sleep,
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
as rideing a Horse-back, long Journies with Fasting,
or rather a very soft light Feeding with warm thin
Liquors at Resting-Places, but that the least possible
that actual <HI>Fainting</HI> will permit.</P>
<P>XXVII. Next to <HI>Rideing,</HI> is either a <HI>Vomit,</HI> or Fast∣ing
almost to Faintness, and then only a little spiced
Wine and Water warm, and a Mouthful or two of
<HI>dry Bisket</HI> every 5th or 6th Hour, with continued <HI>Fri∣ction,</HI>
with a course Cloth, warm Flannel, or a Flesh-Brush,
especially on the <HI>Spine,</HI> in <HI>Faintings</HI> and ex∣treme
<HI>Lowness.</HI></P>
<P>XXVIII. To procure <HI>natural Rest,</HI> nothing is like
four or five middling Pills of true <HI>Assafoetida,</HI> with
four or five Grains of pure succatrine Aloe, taken
going to Bed.</P>
<P>XXIX. The only Way to secure tolerable <HI>Spirits</HI>
in very low Cases, is a constant Endeavour to make
Hunger the greatest Pain, and to cheat the <HI>Appetite</HI>
and Craveing with little, warm, light Liquors at
large Intervals.</P>
<P>XXX. <HI>Good Hours</HI> will be always a most beneficial
Mean to preserve Health and Spirits, to go to Bed
by Ten, and rise by Six.</P>
<P>XXXI. Whosoever would preserve his Health
and Spirits to the last, even when he is in Possession
of it, ought to pass through the great Operations of
<HI>Physic</HI> in the <HI>Spring, viz.</HI> To <HI>bleed, vomit</HI> and <HI>purge,</HI>
whether he have apparent Necessity or not; for <HI>Scur∣vy,</HI>
or <HI>scorbutic Juices,</HI> is the great chronical and fun∣damental
Distemper of <HI>Britain;</HI> all the rest are but
Sprouts and Branches of it. And therefore,</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="35"/>
XXXII. <HI>Vomits</HI> often repeated, at least as often as
the Symptom of any Ail aggravats, increases or ex∣asperats,
are the sole <HI>universal Antidote</HI> and <HI>Panacea</HI> of
<HI>Britain;</HI> an ailing Person cannot repeat <HI>them</HI> too of∣ten,
they will always prove beneficial and <HI>salutary.</HI></P>
<P>XXXIII. In <HI>cold Feet</HI> nothing like batheing them
in tepid Water a little before going to Bed.</P>
<P>XXXIV. A <HI>low Diet</HI> seldom extirpats, or totally
cradicats, any <HI>hereditary chronical</HI> Distemper, unless it
be in the young, the middling aged, or the strong
and healthy, who have otherwise tolerable <HI>Stamina;</HI>
in the very <HI>puny,</HI> delicat and <HI>slender,</HI> in the <HI>old,</HI> and
far advanced in Life, even after Fifty, in the strong∣est,
it only abates the Violence of their <HI>Symptoms,</HI>
makes them less severe, and the Returns seldomer,
and only prolongs the Duration of their Lives.</P>
<P>XXXV. The natural Diseases of the <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>Ne∣cessitous</HI>
are generally owing to a <HI>bad,</HI> unwholesome,
unsound Diet, and the Want of due Care of the o∣ther
<HI>Non-naturals,</HI> Cleanness and Shelter; and are
generally cured by their <HI>Contraries, viz.</HI> a good,
<HI>wholesome,</HI> plain Diet, and a due Cleanness, Shelter
from the Inclemency of Seasons, and an easy Mind.</P>
<P>XXXVI. If it happen that the <HI>Poor,</HI> and those ha∣ving
no Property of their <HI>own,</HI> by <HI>Stealth, Robbery,</HI>
or <HI>unlawful</HI> Means, enter on and pursue the <HI>Luxury</HI>
of the <HI>Rich</HI> and Opulent, not having the other Ne¦cessaries
and Conveniences of Life, neglecting, or not
being able to afford, or being inured to want the ne∣cessary
Care of the other <HI>Non-naturals,</HI> their Diseases
are then the most <HI>atrocious,</HI> painful and miserable of
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
any; which is the Reason that the <HI>acute</HI> and <HI>contagi∣ous</HI>
Distempers begin first, spread faster, and are more
<HI>mortal</HI> among <HI>them,</HI> than those of the better Sort.</P>
<P>XXXVII. <HI>Diet;</HI> a proper well regulated and par∣simonious,
cool Diet, is the far greatest <HI>Article</HI> of long
Life and Health; but the other <HI>Non-naturals</HI> are to be
carefully attended to, and guarded against, else it will
not avail alone, which is the Case in <HI>Monasteries, De∣sarts,</HI>
and long <HI>Sea Voyages.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. <HI>Before we come to give an</HI> Account <HI>of the
last</HI> Article <HI>of Dr.</HI> CHEYNE'<HI>s</HI> Writings, <HI>we
thought it not improper to subjoin to the foregoing</HI> Apho∣risms,
<HI>His</HI> Method <HI>of</HI> curing <HI>a</HI> COLD, <HI>taken from
his</HI> Essay on Health and Long Life; <HI>where (in</HI> Pages
29 <HI>and</HI> 30 <HI>of the 8th</HI> Edition <HI>of that</HI> Book) <HI>he says,</HI></P>
<P>THAT Dr. <HI>James Keill,</HI> in his <HI>Statica Britannica,</HI>
has made it out, beyond all Possibility of doubt∣ing,
that <HI>catching of Cold,</HI> is nothing but <HI>sucking</HI> in,
by the Passages of <HI>Perspiration,</HI> large <HI>Quantities</HI> of
<HI>moist Air,</HI> and <HI>Nitrous Salts,</HI> which, by the thicken∣ing
the Blood and Juices, (as is evident from Bleed∣ing
after catching Cold) and thereby <HI>obstructing,</HI> not
only the <HI>Perspiration,</HI> but also all the other siner <HI>Se∣cretions,</HI>
raises immediately a small <HI>Fever</HI> and a <HI>Tu∣mult</HI>
in the whole <HI>Animal Oeconomy:</HI> and, neglected,
lays a Foundation for <HI>Consumptions, Obstructions</HI> of the
great <HI>Viscera,</HI> and universal <HI>Cachexies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tender</HI> therefore, and <HI>Valetudinary,</HI> ought cau∣tiously
to avoid all Occasions of <HI>catching Cold;</HI> and if
they have been so unfortunate as to <HI>get one,</HI> to set a∣bout
its Cure immediately, before it has taken too
deep <HI>Root</HI> in the <HI>Habit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="37"/>
From the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Disorder thus describ'd,
the <HI>Remedy</HI> is obvious; to wit, <HI>lying</HI> much <HI>a Bed;
drinking</HI> plentifully of small, warm <HI>Sack-Whey,</HI> with
a few <HI>Drops</HI> of <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Hart's Horn; Posset-Drink;
Water-Gruel,</HI> or any other <HI>warm, small Liquor;</HI> a Scru∣ple
of <HI>Gas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igne</HI>'s <HI>Powder,</HI> Morning and Night, living
<HI>low</HI> upon <HI>Spoon-Meats, Pudding,</HI> and <HI>Chicken,</HI> and <HI>drink∣ing</HI>
every Thing <HI>warm:</HI> In a Word, treating it at first
as a small <HI>Fever,</HI> with gentle <HI>Diaphoreticks;</HI> and after∣wards,
if any <HI>Cough</HI> or <HI>Spitting</HI> should remain, (which
this Method generally prevents) by <HI>softening</HI> the <HI>Breast</HI>
with a little <HI>Sugar-Candy</HI> and <HI>Oil</HI> of <HI>Sweet-Almonds;</HI>
or a Solution of <HI>Gum Ammoniac,</HI> an Ounce to a Quart
of <HI>Barley Water,</HI> to make the <HI>Expectoration</HI> easy; and
going <HI>cautiously</HI> and <HI>well clothed</HI> into the <HI>Air</HI> afterwards.</P>
<P>This is a much more <HI>natural, easy</HI> and <HI>effectual</HI> Me∣thod,
than the Practice by <HI>Balsams, Lanctus's, Pecto∣rals,</HI>
and the like <HI>Trumpery</HI> in common Use, which
serve only to <HI>spoil</HI> the <HI>Stomach, oppress</HI> the <HI>Spirits,</HI> and

<HEAD>III. The Natural Method of Curing the Diseases
of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind
depending on the Body. In Three Parts.</HEAD>
<P>IN my <HI>Essay</HI> on <HI>Regimen,</HI> I promised the World
my Thoughts concerning, <HI>The natural Method of
cureing the Diseases of the Body, and the Disorders of
the Mind resulting from such Diseases,</HI> on the Principles
of <HI>Philosophy</HI> laid down in that <HI>Essay,</HI> which, by a
Course of fifty Years Study, I have discover'd to be
the most <HI>Rational,</HI> and in forty Years <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Phy∣sic,</HI>
have found them to be the most <HI>Effectual.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="38"/>
This <HI>Promise</HI> I have in the <HI>following Sheets</HI> endea∣vour'd
to perform, whether to the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Be∣nefit</HI>
of the <HI>Public, Time</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> must shew.
To a <HI>Delicacy</HI> of <HI>Sentiment</HI> and <HI>Correctness</HI> of <HI>Style,</HI> I
have small Pretensions; to convey my own <HI>Thoughts</HI>
to others, with as much <HI>Plainness</HI> and <HI>Perspicuity</HI> as
my Subject would admit of, has been my <HI>principal
View;</HI> and if the serious attentive <HI>Reader</HI> finds him∣self
instructed, the Intention of the Writer is answer'd,
and his Credit, as a <HI>Pen-man,</HI> is of small Import.</P>
<P><HI>Nature</HI> and her <HI>Laws,</HI> a competent Knowledge of
the <HI>animal Oeconomy,</HI> and the best <HI>Observations</HI> which
I have been capable of makeing on my own <HI>Success</HI>
in Practice, or on that of the ablest of my <HI>Profession,</HI>
are the Foundation of every thing by me advanced.
<HI>Theory</HI> I have given into as far only as seemed necessa∣ry
to reconcile the <HI>Method</HI> and <HI>Medicins</HI> by me recom∣mended,
to the truest <HI>Idea</HI> which I could frame of
the Distemper to be cured: For the rest, the <HI>Reader</HI>
is referred to the <HI>Essay</HI> above-mentiond, and its <HI>Ap∣pendages.</HI></P>
<P>In a Design extensive as this, it will not be expect∣ed
that I should descend either into <HI>Forms</HI> of <HI>Medi∣cins,</HI>
or the particular Circumstances of every <HI>Distem∣per</HI>
under Consideration; this will be the necessary
Duty of the <HI>Physician</HI> in ordinary, who, if he ap∣proves
the general Directions by me given, will readi∣ly
adapt them to any particular Case, its <HI>Degrees</HI> and
<HI>Symptoms.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot, I should hope, give any reasonable <HI>Of∣fence,</HI>
if in a Work of this Kind, many particular
Things should occur, which probably I may have al∣ready
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
advanced in some former <HI>Treatises;</HI> my <HI>Apology</HI>
for which is, that in all I know of <HI>Physic,</HI> I have but
one general <HI>System; Nature</HI> being ever <HI>one</HI> and the
same, and proceeding in all <HI>animal Functions</HI> and Ope∣rations
by the <HI>same,</HI> or at least by analogous <HI>Laws.</HI></P>
<P>What I learned from <HI>Books, Speculation</HI> and <HI>Philo∣sophy,</HI>
by Trial and Experience I have found to be
greatly <HI>defective,</HI> as well in many Distempers, where∣of
I myself have felt the Weight, as in the Cases of
my <HI>Patients;</HI> and this <HI>Experience</HI> has led me to throw
off all <HI>unsuccessful</HI> Methods and <HI>Medicins,</HI> and to con∣fine
myself to <HI>such</HI> only, by which I had Reason to
think the principal <HI>Point</HI> in View, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>lasting Cure,</HI>
might be obtained. This Method of proceeding re∣duces
the <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Physic</HI> into a narrow Compass,
<HI>viz.</HI> 1. To proper <HI>Evacuations</HI> of the several proper
Kinds. 2. To <HI>attenuating</HI> and <HI>deobstruent</HI> Medicins,
of which I find the <HI>mild ponderose</HI> to be generally the
best; and after a due Use of these, 3. The gentle <HI>As∣tringents</HI>
and <HI>Strengthners</HI> of the Solids, 4. A proper
and <HI>specific Diet,</HI> with <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Exercise.</HI></P>
<P>This is my general <HI>System:</HI> This, if just and solid,
brings all that can be pertinently said on the <HI>Cure</HI> of
Distempers, into an easy and intelligible View, and
makes many of the <HI>same</HI> Methods and Medicins com∣mon
to different <HI>Cases</HI> and <HI>Patients.</HI> Whatever
exceeds, is <HI>calculated</HI> either for the easy Death, or to
keep up the Courage and Hopes, of the <HI>Patient.</HI></P>
<P>It would not become me to say, that the Method
here laid down, how judiciously soever applied, will
in every <HI>Case</HI> absolutely cure or save: This, however,
I venture to affirm, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Continuance of this
Method for a due Time, has done, in very bad Ca∣ses,
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
and, by <HI>GOD's Blessing,</HI> will do more than any
other which has yet been so strongly and clearly en∣forced
and explained, or is commonly used.</P>
<P>I may be deceiv'd myself, but, if I know my own
Heart, have not a single <HI>Temptation</HI> to deceive others.
My <HI>Age</HI> is little short of seventy Years, at which
Time in Life, a <HI>Thought</HI> of adding to my <HI>Reputation,</HI>
or to my <HI>Purse,</HI> would be extreme Folly: The <HI>first</HI> is
now at the Disposal of the <HI>Public,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> will soon
be in the Hands of my <HI>Executors.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, though I should <HI>convince</HI> the World,
I must not expect to <HI>convert</HI> it: Lessons of <HI>Abstinence</HI>
and <HI>Self denial</HI> loose their <HI>Weight,</HI> when offered to
strong <HI>Passions,</HI> and <HI>high Spirits;</HI> and the greatest Part
of my <HI>Disciples</HI> will probably always be such, as have
labour'd through the tedious <HI>Courses</HI> of <HI>Physic</HI> with∣out
Success, whose Sufferings have soured the <HI>false
Pleasures</HI> resulting from <HI>sensual Appetites,</HI> and who are
at length willing to renounce <HI>Luxury,</HI> in order to les∣sen
<HI>Misery.</HI> To these I <HI>seriously</HI> affirm, that this <HI>Me∣thod,</HI>
strictly and for Time sufficient pursued, will af∣ford
all the <HI>Ease</HI> which human <HI>Art</HI> can give, or hu∣man
<HI>Nature</HI> receive; and as the <HI>Time</HI> is hourly steal∣ing
on, when <HI>Art</HI> can do no more, an Observance of
these <HI>Rules</HI> will be the calmest and easiest Way of <HI>ly∣ing
down in Death.</HI></P>
<P>Let this single Consideration then recommend the
<HI>System</HI> proposed, <HI>viz.</HI> That it has a necessary Ten∣dency
to <HI>alleviat</HI> the <HI>Pains</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> and to soften the
<HI>Terrors</HI> of <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thus far the</HI> Doctor's <HI>own</HI> ACCOUNT <HI>of His</HI>
Last Labours in Medicin, <HI>hitherto publish'd: We shall
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
now oblige the</HI> Reader <HI>with some few</HI> EXTRACTS
<HI>from them; wherein are contain'd some singular</HI> Instances
<HI>of the good</HI> Effects <HI>of</HI> Temperance <HI>and</HI> Abstinence, <HI>so
strongly recommended by him; as likewise of the fatal</HI>
Consequences <HI>of the contrary</HI> Vices. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>I. I Have a due Esteem for the <HI>Philosophers</HI> and
<HI>wise Men</HI> both of <HI>Antiquity</HI> and <HI>later</HI> Ages;
those who have labour'd to cure the <HI>Diseases</HI> of the
<HI>Mind,</HI> and those who have suggested effectual <HI>Means</HI>
for the <HI>Cure</HI> or <HI>Reiief</HI> of the <HI>Distempers</HI> of the <HI>Body;</HI>
as well as for those who have discover'd the <HI>Wisdom</HI>
and <HI>Beauty</HI> of the <HI>Works</HI> of the <HI>Author of Nature.</HI>
The <HI>Christian Philosophy,</HI> represented in its true Light,
is infinitely beyond any thing that ever was thought
of, or could possibly enter into the Heart of Crea∣tures
to imagine, for extirpating the <HI>Diseases</HI> of the
<HI>Mind,</HI> as is allow'd even by its <HI>Adversaries</HI> themselves:
For remedying the <HI>Distempers</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> to make a
Man live as long as his original <HI>Frame</HI> was design'd
to last, with the least <HI>Pain,</HI> fewest <HI>Diseases,</HI> or Loss of
his Senses, I think <HI>Pythagoras</HI> and <HI>Cornaro</HI> (for sug∣gesting
a general and effectual <HI>Mean</HI>) by far the two
greatest Men that ever were; the <HI>first,</HI> by <HI>vegetable</HI>
Food, and <HI>unfermented</HI> Liquors; the <HI>latter,</HI> by the
<HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI> of <HI>animal Food,</HI> and naturally fer∣mented
Liquors. Both lived to a great <HI>Age:</HI> But what
is chiefly to be regarded in their Conduct and Exam∣ple,
both preserv'd their <HI>Senses, Chearfulness</HI> and <HI>Se∣renity,</HI>
to the last; and, which is still more to be re∣garded,
both, at least the last, <HI>dissolv'd</HI> without Pain
or Struggle; the first having lost his Life in a Tu∣mult,
as is said by some, after a great Age of perfect
Health. <HI>Vide</HI> Pages 66, 67, <HI>of the last mention'd</HI> Book.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="42"/>
<HI>In another Place,</HI> (viz. Page 296,) <HI>his further</HI> RE∣MARKS
<HI>upon</HI> CORNARO <HI>are as follow,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Cornaro,</HI> who was possibly a single Instance, a∣mongst
Men of Rank and <HI>Affluence,</HI> of a long Life,
high Health and Spirits to the <HI>last,</HI> secured these va∣luable
Blessings by the mere Force of <HI>Regimen,</HI> even
after a luxurious, and consequently an unhealthy and
dispirited <HI>Youth.</HI> At Forty, he began to curb his Ap∣petites,
and to manage his <HI>Diet,</HI> which, after several
<HI>Essays,</HI> he fixed at twelve Ounces of <HI>Food,</HI> and four∣teen
of <HI>Wine</HI> in twenty-four Hours; from this Time,
(<HI>viz,</HI> the Age of Forty) gradually lessening his <HI>Diet,</HI>
till he reduced it to the Yolk of an Egg (<HI>i. e.</HI> about
an Ounce of solid Food in twenty-four Hours, and
probably did the same by his <HI>Wine</HI>). He enjoyed a
perfect State of Health, and was at the same time in
<HI>high Spirits</HI> to the Age of an Hundred, or, as some
Authors say, an Hundred and Twenty: A very ex∣traordinary
Instance this, in a Man of <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s <HI>Rank</HI>
in <HI>Life,</HI> who had in his Youth indulged in <HI>high</HI> Food,
and <HI>rich</HI> Wine. Now it is highly probable, that from
the Time of the first Reduction of his Food so, at
the Age of Forty, he must gradually have lessened
the daily <HI>Quantity,</HI> about two Ounces every ten Years,
till he had at Length reduced it to an Ounce a Day.
The happy Result of this gradual <HI>Reduction</HI> shews,
that he must naturally have had strong Solids: For I
am quite persuaded, that if instead of this <HI>stinted</HI>
Quantity of <HI>animal</HI> Food, he had, at the Age of For∣ty,
confined himself to Cow's Milk and Bread, to
Vegetables and Water only, he might probably have
lived to a much greater Age, with a clearer <HI>Head,</HI>
and higher <HI>Spirits;</HI> for the sovereign Method of pro∣longing
Life is to preserve the Blood in a <HI>thin, sweet,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
and <HI>balmy</HI> State, by which only the <HI>Circulation</HI> can be
kept sufficiently extensive and full, through the vari∣ous
<HI>Meanders</HI> of the <HI>Capillaries,</HI> and all their delicate
<HI>Circumvolutions</HI> in the <HI>Glands:</HI> For natural <HI>Death</HI> by
reason of Age only, is the necessary Result of thicken∣ing
the Blood, which gradually lessens the Extent of,
and finally stops, the <HI>Circulation,</HI> even in the Trunks
of the Vessels.</P>
<P>III. I have been credibly inform'd, that Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton,</HI> when he applied himself to what is esteem'd
the greatest Stretch of human <HI>Invention</HI> and <HI>Penetra∣tion,</HI>
(<HI>viz.</HI> the Study, <HI>Investigation</HI> and <HI>Analysis</HI> of the
<HI>Theory</HI> of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Colours</HI>) to quicken his Faculties,
and fix his Attention, confin'd himself to a small
Quantity of Bread, dureing all the Time, with a little
<HI>Sack</HI> and Water, of which, without any Regulation,
he took as he found a Craving, or <HI>Failure</HI> of Spirits.
And the famous Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> Projector of the <HI>Missisip∣pi,</HI>
to keep his Head clear, and Faculties acute, in
order to obtain a Superiority of Skill in <HI>Game,</HI> liv'd
many Years on <HI>half</HI> a Chicken a Day, with about a
a <HI>Pound</HI> of Bread, and drank nothing but Water or
<HI>aqueous</HI> Liquors, and by that Means won great Sums
on the Square. Many more Instances I could give
of great Men in all Ages, and of all <HI>Professions,</HI> who
maintain'd their Superiority of Parts, their Attenti∣on,
Penetration, just and close Thinking, by extreme
<HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Abstinence.</HI> But I chose these <HI>two,</HI> be∣cause
they have been, and still are, much distinguish'd
and known in their vastly different Ways; and that
any one who thinks it worth his while, may be satis∣fied
about the Truth of the Facts. <HI>Vide</HI> Page 81, <HI>ib.</HI></P>
<P>IV. When I advise the <HI>Lightest</HI> and the <HI>Least,</HI> I
mean, To take regularly Something and Somewhat;
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
for Nothing neither admits of Degrees nor Qualities.
Suppose (to shew the Absurdity) a Man took <HI>half a
Pound</HI> of Bread and a <HI>Pint</HI> of Water three Times a
Day, what would be the Consequence? The <HI>Objector</HI>
thinks the Patient would certainly <HI>die;</HI> his concoct∣ing
Juices would turn <HI>acrid,</HI> and so spoil his Blood,
and thereby he would <HI>pine,</HI> and at last extinguish;
and yet <HI>Cassian</HI> tells us, that the antient <HI>Hermits</HI> al∣low'd
themselves but a Pound (or even less) of Bread
with Water in <HI>Twenty-four</HI> Hours; and most of them
liv'd to an <HI>Hundred,</HI> some to an Hundred and Fif∣ty,
others to Two hundred Years, without Diseas∣es,
and with great Serenity and Chearfulness. And
Dr. <HI>Barwick</HI> tells us, in the Life of his Brother,
who, in the late Civil Wars, had for many Years been
confin'd in a low Room in the <HI>Tower,</HI> dureing the
Usurpation; that at the Time of his going in, he
was under a <HI>Phthisis, Alrophy,</HI> and <HI>Dyscrasy,</HI> and
liv'd on Bread and Water only several Years there;
and yet came out at the <HI>Restoration,</HI> sleek, plump,
and gay. Many such Instances I could produce,
but it would be lost Labour. <HI>Vide</HI> Page 210, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>V. In <HI>England</HI> alone, from <HI>Gluttony</HI> and <HI>Intempe∣rance</HI>
in fermented Liquors, and from unguarded <HI>Lea∣chery,</HI>
I have been told, that a <HI>late worthy and learned
Physician,</HI> that had examin'd into the Numbers con∣fin'd
for <HI>Lunacy</HI> and <HI>Madness,</HI> upon the strictest Exa∣mination,
found they reach'd to a Number I dare not
name. And another <HI>Physician</HI> ascribed Wrong-head∣edness,
<HI>gloomy Thinking, Melancholy, Despondency</HI> and
<HI>Darkness</HI> on the <HI>Imagination,</HI> to the abounding of Cho∣ler
in the <HI>Stomach,</HI> which every one knows to arise
from Intemperance and Excess. Whatever be in these
<HI>Gentlemens</HI> Observations and Opinions, it cannot be
doubted, that the clear, ready, and pleasant Exercise
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
of the <HI>intellectual</HI> Faculties, and their easy and undis∣turb'd
<HI>Application</HI> and <HI>Attention</HI> to any Subject, is ne∣ver
to be obtained, but by a free and regular Perfor∣mance
of the natural <HI>Functions;</HI> which, as has been
shewn, the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI> Food can only procure.

<HEAD>Dr. CHEYNE's CHARACTER
Of the Honourable
GEORGE BAILLIE, Es{que}</HEAD>
<P>THE Honourable <HI>George Baillie,</HI> Es{que} descended
from an antient and virtuous Family in <HI>North-Britain,</HI>
was a Gentleman, who, in this corrupt Age,
did Honour to human Nature, and was a great In∣stance
(according to my best Observation) of the
<HI>Efficacy</HI> of the <HI>Grace, Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of the
<HI>Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>At one and the same Time he was a most <HI>zealous
Patriot,</HI> a very <HI>able Statesman,</HI> and the most <HI>perfect
Christian;</HI> that this, or any Age has produced; <HI>Piety,
Charity, Justice</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> being the <HI>Basis</HI> of all his
<HI>private Resolves,</HI> and <HI>publick Transactions.</HI> He consi∣dered
Mankind as his <HI>Family,</HI> and each Individual as
his <HI>Child,</HI> and as the <HI>Image</HI> of his <HI>Heavenly Father.</HI>
He continued steadily in his own Church and Princi∣ples,
when at Home, and in his Country; discourag∣ing
<HI>Indifference</HI> and <HI>Wavering</HI> in the <HI>external,</HI> as well as
<HI>internal</HI> Life of Religion, but without <HI>Rigidness</HI> and
<HI>Narrowness of Soul;</HI> believing <HI>Charity</HI> to be one of
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
the <HI>Cardinal Virtues,</HI> and a guarded Freedom, essenti∣al
to our unlapsed and recovered Natures.</P>
<P>I had the Honour of an intimate Acquaintance with
him for the last thirty Years of his Life. I have
studied him in all the various Scenes he passed
through; in Posts of great Honour, in the Trou∣bles
of private Life, in Health and Sickness, in Bu∣siness
and Retirement; and with great Truth I can
affirm, that in all these several Scenes, I never knew
his Superior in <HI>solid Virtue</HI> and <HI>just Thinking.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Courage</HI> was <HI>undaunted,</HI> and his <HI>Patience im∣moveable;</HI>
his <HI>Piety unfeigned,</HI> and his <HI>Truth exact</HI>
to the greatest <HI>Precisian.</HI> Having been bred in the
<HI>School of Affliction,</HI> his Compassion was never denied
to those who were in <HI>Distress,</HI> even by their own <HI>In∣discretions.</HI>
He spent the last twelve Years of his Life
in <HI>constant Meditation, Contemplation,</HI> and <HI>Prayer.</HI> It
was truly <HI>a Life hid with Christ in God.</HI> He passed
through several States of <HI>Purification</HI> and <HI>severe Trial,</HI>
unknown to common and unexperienced <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>His Father (a few Hours before his Life must have
ended by the Hardships of his Confinement) was,
for his Love to his Religion and Country, most bar∣barously
put to Death by the Severity of the then <HI>Ad∣ministration,</HI>
and the Madness of the Times; where∣by
his Estate was forfeited, and his Son obliged to
retire into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>Coming into <HI>England</HI> with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
he narrowly escaped perishing at Sea; on which Ac∣count,
all his Life after, he kept a rigorous <HI>Fast</HI> once
every Week, spending the whole Day in <HI>Meditation,
Prayer,</HI> and <HI>Praises</HI> to his <HI>Deliverer.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="47"/>
During all the Times of his great and arduous <HI>Em∣playments,</HI>
he never failed Morning and Night to re∣tire
a considerable Time to his Closet, and prostrate
himself before his Maker. His Faith and Trust, that
the <HI>Children of the Righteous shall never want Bread,</HI>
was so firm, that in all his Difficulties and Misfor∣tunes,
he never saved any Thing for Fear of Want,
(when the Expence was charitable, necessary, or de∣cent;)
and in his Prosperity he never squandered a∣way
any Thing ostentatiously or uselesly.</P>
<P>His private <HI>Charities</HI> were as <HI>great</HI> and <HI>extensive,</HI> as
they were <HI>secret</HI> and <HI>constant.</HI> In short, in his Rank
and Order, under the present <HI>Lapse</HI> of human Nature,
and the flagrant <HI>Corruption</HI> of this <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Nation,</HI> he
was in every Thing a most <HI>perfect Example</HI> to his <HI>Fa∣mily,</HI>
to his <HI>Friends,</HI> and to his <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He died</HI> August 6, 1738, <HI>at</HI> Oxford, <HI>Aged</HI> 75.</P>

<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
<HEAD>Some ACCOUNT of Dr. ARCHI∣BALD
PITCAIRN, and his Wri∣tings,
by Dr. SEWEL.</HEAD>
<P>DR. PITCAIRN was one of the first, who
leaving the <HI>Old</HI> Conjectural Method of Phy∣sical
Writers, struck into a <HI>New</HI> and more
Solid Way of Reasoning, grounded upon Observati∣ons
and Mathematical Principles.</P>
<P>He studied many Years abroad, where his great
Learning, and successful Practice, procured him the
Esteem of all Foreigners, and spread his Reputation
into as many different Countries, as the Variety of
Students of Physic in <HI>Holland</HI> owed their Birth to, e∣very
one carrying home a high Opinion of Dr PIT∣CAIRN's
useful Knowledge in that Science.</P>
<P>These Qualifications in his Art raised him in a little
Time to the Professorship at <HI>Leyden,</HI> unto which he
was chose in the Year 1691, as much to the Reputa∣tion
of the <HI>Scottish</HI> Nation as his own. Here he be∣gan
his excellent Lectures, in a Manner, which con∣firmed
his Auditors in the just Notions they had con∣ceived
of him, as of one who was to banish the Old
false Maxims of Physic, and lay more certain and
infallible Fundamentals of the most comprehensive
Art the Mind of Man is capable of attaining. It were
needless to inform the Reader what <HI>Errors</HI> he reform∣ed,
what <HI>new Lights</HI> he spread over the Face of Phy∣sic,
and what <HI>admirable Hints</HI> he gave for its future
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
Improvement, such as the Genius of a <HI>second</HI> PIT∣CAIRN,
or a <HI>present</HI> MEAD, might indeed carry to
that desireable Pitch, which other Learned Men have
hitherto labour'd at in vain. There is no Page in his
<HI>Dissertations</HI> wherein something of this Nature may
not be observed, and the Book it self will be the best
Evidence of the Truth we assert.</P>
<P>He continued in the Chair at <HI>Leyden</HI> sometime, and
published a great many of his curious Pieces in that
Place, all which were admired by the Learned of the
Faculty; and though some of his Opinions met with
<HI>Adversaries,</HI> the Doctor had no Occasion to give him∣self
the Trouble of a <HI>Vindication,</HI> the Justness of his
Reasoning raising him up <HI>Advocates</HI> wherever Truth
prevailed over Sophistry, and good Sense was prefer∣red
to the Jargon of unintelligible Terms.</P>
<P>He had in all Probability continued longer at this
Place, but some private Concerns obliged him to re∣tire
into his own Country, where his Fame had alrea∣dy
made Way for an honourable Entertainment a∣mong
all Persons of the best Sense and Quality. Here
he continued his Practice with equal Applause and
Success, keeping at the same Time a Correspondence
with most of the great Men of the Faculty in all Parts
of <HI>Europe,</HI> whom either his Writings or Conversation
at <HI>Leyden</HI> had made his Friends and Admirers. Indeed
he was the freest and most communicative of his Ad∣vice
of any Person, perhaps, that ever made so emi∣nent
a Figure in his Profession, never refusing either
to satisfy by Letter the Curiosity, or inform the Mind
of the Enquirer. His <HI>Friendship</HI> with the great <HI>Belli∣ni,</HI>
and Mons. <HI>Hecquet,</HI> must never be forgotten; and
it is evident from their Writings, that they seemed
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
to be proud of <HI>that Name,</HI> and took all Occasions to
do Justice to the Merit of their <HI>Friend.</HI></P>
<P>This may lead us into some Part of his private
CHARACTER, of which there are too many Wit∣nesses
living to make us say any Thing but strict
Truth.</P>
<P>In the Business of his Profession he was always rea∣dy
to serve every one to the utmost of his Power,
and even to contribute to their Health at the Danger
of his own. He was a Man of too good Sense to be
a Humourist in Physic, or refuse Attendance out of
Pique, or Prejudice, or Affectation: He understood
the Value of Life too well to sacrifice it to Caprice
and Humour. There is one Thing more remarkable
of him; That he was not at all concern'd about Fees,
and frighted from his Duty by the Sight of Poverty
in his Patient, nay, he went with greater Chearful∣ness
to those from whom he could expect nothing but
good Will, than to Persons of the highest Conditi∣on.
Besides, in Cases which seemed to require that
Assistance, he not only gave away his Skill and Me∣dicines,
but extended his Generosity for the Provision
of other Conveniences for the Sick, and left the
Marks of his Charity, as well as of the Liberality of
his Art, behind him. The Virtue of Charity was re∣ally
so much his own, in the Use of it, that he con∣trived
a most secret and decent Manner of conveying
his Benevolence, and relieved many who knew not
their Benefactor.</P>
<P>In short, he was one of the greatest and most use∣ful
Men in his Profession this Age has produced, of
a free and universal Genius, a good Orator, Poet,
and Philosopher. He was of a pleasant, engaging Hu∣mour.
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
Life sate very easy upon him in all its Circum∣stances.
He despised many, but hated none. He
loved his Friends, and laughed at his Enemies. Thus
he drew out Life to about sixty Years: And it was
not long before he died, that he gave us that excel∣lent
Picture of himself in a Copy of Verses, which
are at least equal, both in their Easiness, Simplicity,
and Elegance of Thought and Stile, to any of CA∣TULLUS,
and far superior to any modern Compo∣sition
of that Kind. They have been printed by Mr.
PRIOR, who honour'd them with an Imitation; how
near the Original, the Reader may judge.</P>

<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
<HEAD>Some EXTRACTS from LEWIS CORNARO,
a Noble Venetian, concerning the Preservation
of Health.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas several Persons, whose weak Constitu∣tion
required great Care in the Management
of it, have been well satisfied with what I
have written concerning Sobriety, the Experience which
they have had of the Usefulness of my Counsels, and
the Acknowledgments which they have made thereof;
encourage me to take up my Pen again, that I may
convince those, who meet with no Inconvenience from
Intemperance, that they are in the wrong in relying
so much on the Strength of their Constitution.</P>
<P>Let it be ever so well compos'd, yet it holds not
good but to such an Age. These Persons seldom ar∣rive
to Sixty, but they decay all of a sudden, and
perceive themselves loaded with a Complication of Dis∣tempers.
Some are Gouty, Dropsical, and Rheuma∣tical:
Others are subject to Cholicks, the Stone and
Piles; lastly, to abundance of Distempers, which
would probably never have happen'd to them, if they
had been so wife as to have taken Care of themselves
in their Youth. If they die infirm at Fourscore Years
of Age, they might have lived in Health to an Hun∣dred,
and so have run out the Term of Life, which
Nature has left open to all Men.</P>
<P>It is to be supposed that this common Parent wish∣es
that all her Children might live at least a Century;
and since some among them have lived to a longer
Date, why should not others have a Right of expect∣ing
the same Advantage?</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="56"/>
I do not disagree, but that we are subject to the
Stars which were predominant at our Birth. Their
good or bad Aspects, enfeeble or strengthen the
Springs of our Life; but Man being endued with
Judgment and Reason, ought to repair by his prudent
Conduct, the Harm which his Planet may have done
him; he may prolong his Days by the Means of a
sober Life, to as long a Period, as if he had been
born Strong and Lusty. Prudence prevents and cor∣rects
the Malignity of the Planets; they give us cer∣tain
Inclinations, they carry us out to certain Passions;
but they lay no Violence upon us, we may resist 'em,
and in this Sense a wife Man is above the Stars.</P>
<P>I was born very Cholerick and Hasty; I flew out
into Passion for the least Trifle; I huffed all Mankind,
and was so intolerable, that a great many Persons of
Repute avoided my Company. I apprehended the
Injury which I did my self; I knew that Anger is a
real Frenzy; that it disturbs our Judgment, that it
transports us beyond our selves, and that the Differ∣ence
between a passionate and a mad Man, is only
this, that the latter has lost his Reason for ever,
and the former is only deprived of it by Fits. A
sober Life cured me of this Frenzy; by its Assist∣ance
I became so moderate, and so much Master
of my Passion, that no Body could perceive that
it was born with me.</P>
<P>A Man may likewise with Reason, and a regu∣lar
Life, correct a bad Constitution; and notwith∣standing
the Tenderness thereof, may live a long
Time in good Health. I should never have seen Forty
Years, had I followed all my Inclinations, and yet I
am in the Eighty Sixth Year of my Age. If the long
and dangerous Distempers which I had in my Youth,
had not consumed a great deal of the Radical Moist∣ure,
the Loss of which is irreparable, I might have
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
promis'd my self to have liv'd a compleat Century.
But without flattering my self, I find it to be a great
Matter to have arrived to Forty Six Years more than
I ever expected, and that in my Old Age my Consti∣tution
is still so good, that not only my Teeth, my
Voice, my Memory, and my Heart, are in as good
a Condition, as ever they were in the briskest Days
of my Youth; but likewise my Judgment has lost
nothing of its Clearness and Force.</P>
<P>I am of the Opinion, that this proceeds from the
Abridgment I make of my Food, proportionably to
my growing into Years. Experience, which tells us,
that Infants have a greater Appetite, and are more
often hungry, than grown Men, ought likewise to
teach us, that in Old Age we have less need of Nour∣ishment,
than in the Beginning of Life. A Man who
is very old, can hardly eat, because he can scarce di∣gest
what he eats; a little serves his Turn, and the
Yolk of an Egg is a good Meal to him. I shall be
satisfied therewith to the End of my Days, hopeing,
by this Conduct, neither to dye with Violence, nor
with Pain, not questioning but that they who will
imitate me, will meet with as easy an Exit, since we
are all of the same <HI>Species,</HI> and made up of the same
Materials.</P>
<P>Since nothing then is more advantageous for a Man
upon Earth, than to live long; he is obliged to pre∣serve
his Health as far as possible, and this he cannot
do without Sobriety. 'Tis true, indeed, that there
are several who eat and drink plentifully, and yet live
to an Hundred Years of Age. 'Tis by their Exam∣ple
that others flatter themselves with the Hopes of
attaining to the same Age, without any Occasion of
laying a Restraint upon themselves. But they are in
the wrong upon these two Accounts: First, because
there is hardly one in a Thousand, that has so strong
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
a Constitution. Secondly, because such Men do gene∣rally
end their Lives by such Distempers, as put them
into great Agonies by dying, which would never hap∣pen
to those that have the same Government of them∣selves
that I have. A Man runs the Risque of not
attaining to Fifty Years of Age, for not daring to
undertake a regular Course of Life; which is no im∣possible
Thing, since 'tis what I, and several others,
have practised, and do practise. And a Man becomes
insensibly a Murderer of himself; because he cannot
be persuaded, that notwithstanding the false Charms
of a voluptuous Life, a wise Man ought not to look
upon it as any Hardship, to put in Practice what his
Reason advises him.</P>
<P>Reason, if we hearken to it, will tell us, that a
good Regimen is necessary for the prolonging of our
Days; and that it consists in Two Things: First, in
taking Care of the Quality; and, Secondly, of the
Quantity; so as to eat and drink nothing that offends
the Stomach, nor any more than what we can easily
digest. Our Experience ought to be our Guide in these
Two Principles, when we are arriv'd to Forty, Fifty,
or Threescore Years of Age. He who puts in Prac∣tice
that Knowledge which he has of what is good for
him, and goes on in a frugal way of Living, keeps
the Humours in a just Temperature, and prevents
them from being alter'd; tho' he suffer Heat and
Cold, tho' he be fatigu'd, tho' his Sleep be broke;
provided there be no Excess in any of them. This
being so; what an Obligation does a Man lie under
of living soberly? And ought he not to free himself
from the Fears of sinking under the least Intempera∣ture
of the Air, and under the least Fatigue, which
make us sick upon every slight Occasion?</P>
<P>'Tis true, indeed, the most sober may sometimes
be indisposed, when they are unavoidably oblig'd to
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>
transgress the Rules which they have been used to ob∣serve:
But then, they are certain, that their Indispo∣sition
will not last above Two or Three Days at most;
nor can they fall into a Fever. Weariness and Faint∣ness
are easily remedied by Rest and good Diet. The
Malignancy of the Stars cannot put the malignant
Humours in a Ferment, in Bodies which have them
not: Tho' Distempers which proceed from Intempe∣rance,
have an internal Cause, and may be dangerous;
those which are deriv'd from the Influences of the
Planets, affect us only externally, and cannot produce
any great Disorders.</P>
<P>There are some who feed high, and maintain, that
whatsoever they eat is so little Disturbance to them,
that they cannot perceive in what Part of their Body
their Stomach lies; but I aver, that they do not speak
as they think; nor is it natural. 'Tis impossible, that
any created Being should be of so perfect a Composi∣tion,
as that neither Heat nor Cold, Dry nor Moist,
should have any Influence over it; and that the Vari∣ety
of Food which they make use of, of different
Qualities, should be equally agreeable to them. Those
Men cannot but acknowledge, that they are some∣times
out of Order: If it is not owing to a sensible
Indigestion, yet they are troubled with Head-achs,
want of Sleep, and Fevers; of which they are cur'd
by a Diet, and taking such Medicines as are proper
for Evacuation. It is therefore certain, that their
Distempers proceed from Repletion, or from their
having eat or drank something which did not agree
with their Stomachs.</P>
<P>Most old People excuse their high Feeding, by say∣ing,
that it is necessary for them to eat a great deal,
to keep up their natural Heat, which diminishes pro∣portionably
as they grow in Years; and, to create an
Appetite, 'tis requisite to find out proper Sauces, and
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>
to eat whatever they have a Fancy for; and that
without thus humouring their Palates, they should
be soon in their Graves. To this I reply, That Na∣ture,
for the Preservation of a Man in Years, has
so compos'd him, that he may live with a little Food;
that his Stomach cannot digest a great Quantity; and
that he has no need of being afraid of dying for want
of eating, since when he is sick, he is forc'd to have
Recourse to a regular Sort of Diet, which is the first
and main Thing prescrib'd him by his Physicians.
Lastly, That if this Remedy is of such Efficacy, as
to snatch us out of the Arms of Death, 'tis a Mist∣ake
to suppose, that a Man may not, by eating a lit∣tle
more than he does when he is sick, live a long
Time without ever being sick.</P>
<P>Others had rather be disturb'd Twice or Thrice a
Year with the Gout, the <HI>Sciatica,</HI> and other Epide∣mical
Distempers, than to be always put to the Tor∣ment
and Mortification of laying a Restraint upon
their Appetites; being sure, that when they are in∣disposed,
a regular Diet will be an infallible Remedy
and Cure. But let them be inform'd by me, that as
they grow up in Years, their natural Heat abates:
That a regular Diet, despis'd as a Precaution, and
only look'd upon as Phsiyc, cannot always have the
same Effect nor Force to draw off the Crudities, and
repair the Disorders, which are caused by Repletion;
and, lastly, that they run the Hazard of being cheat∣ed,
by their Hope and their Intemperance.</P>
<P>Others say, that it is more eligible to feed high,
and enjoy themselves, tho' a Man lives the less
while. It is no surprizing Matter, that Fools and
Madmen should contemn and despise Life; the World
would be no Loser, whenever they go out of it: But
'tis a considerable Loss, when wise, virtuous, and
holy Men drop into the Grave. If one of them were
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
a Bishop, he might have been an Archbishop, in
growing older: If he were in some considerable Post
in the State, he might have arrived to the highest: If
he were learned, or excelled in any Art, he would
have been more excellent, and done more Honour to
his Country and himself.</P>
<P>Others there are, who perceiving themselves to
grow old, tho' their Stomach becomes less capable of
digesting well every day than other, yet will not, on
that Account, abate any Thing of their Diet. They
only abridge themselves of the Number of their Meals;
and because they find two or three times a day is troub∣lesome,
they think their Health is sufficiently provi∣ded
for, by making only one Meal; that so the time
between one Repast and another, may (as they say)
facilitate the Digestion of those Aliments, which they
might have taken at twice: For this Reason, they eat
at this one Meal so much, that their Stomach is over∣charg'd,
and out of Order, and converts the Super∣fluities
of its Nourishment into bad Humours, which
engender Diseases and Death. I never knew a Man
that liv'd long by this Conduct. These Men would
doubtless have prolong'd their Days, had they abridg'd
the Quantity of their ordinary Food, proportionably
as they grew in Years, and had eaten a great deal less,
and a little oftner.</P>
<P>Some again are of Opinion, That Sobriety may in∣deed
preserve a Man in Health, but does not prolong
his Life: To this we say, That there have been Per∣sons
in past Ages, who have prolong'd their Lives by
this Means; and some there are at present, who still
do: It shortens not our Days, as the Infirmities con∣tracted
by Repletion do. A Man of an ordinary Reach
may perceive, that, if he desires to live long, it is
better to be well than sick; and that, consequently,
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
Temperance contributes more to a long Life, than an
excessive high Feeding.</P>
<P>Whatsoever the Sensualists may say, Temperance
is of infinite Benefit to Mankind: To it he owes his
Preservation: It banishes from his Mind the dismal
Apprehension of dying: 'Tis by its Means that he
becomes wise, and arrives to an Age, wherein Reason
and Experience furnish him with Assistance, to free
himself from the Tyranny of his Passions, which have
lorded it over him for almost the whole Course of
his Life.</P>
<P>O happy State of Life! which, besides other Bles∣sings
with which thou favourest an Old Man, dost
preserve his Stomach in so perfect a Tone, as to make
him relish a Piece of dry Bread, better than the Vo∣luptuous
do all their dainty Morsels, and best season'd
Dishes. The Appetite which thou gavest us for Bread,
is just and reasonable; since 'tis the most proper Food
for Mankind, when attended with a Desire of Eating.
A sober Life is never without such an Appetite. So
that by eating a little, my Stomach is often craving
after the Manna; which I sometimes relish with so
much Pleasure, that I should think I trespass upon the
Duty of Temperance, did I not know that one must
eat it to support Life; and that one cannot make use
of a plainer, and a more natural Diet.</P>
<P>My Spirits are not injur'd by what I eat; they are
only reviv'd and supported by it. I always find my
self in an even Temper, always chearful; and more
so after, than before Meals. I use my self, presently
upon rising from Table, to write or study, and never
find, that this Application of Mind, after Eating, is
prejudicial to me: For I am equally capable at all
Times of doing it, and never perceive my self drow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y,
as a great many People do. The Reason of this
is, because the little I eat is not sufficient to send up
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>
the Fumes from the Stomach to the Head, which fill
the Brain, and render it uncapable of performing its
Functions.</P>
<P>What I eat, is as follows; <HI>viz.</HI> Bread, Soop, new∣laid
Eggs, Veal, Kid, Mutton, Partridges, Pullets,
and Pidgeons. Among the Sea-fish, I chuse <HI>Goldenis,</HI>
and of the River-fish, the Pike. All these <HI>Aliments</HI>
are proper for old Men; who, if they be <HI>wise for
themselves,</HI> would be contented with these, and seek
for no other.</P>
<P>A poor old Man, who has not wherewith to pur∣chase
all these, should be satisfied with Bread, Broth,
and Eggs; but not to eat much of them at a Time;
and so to regulate himself, with respect to the Quan∣tity
of his Diet, as that he may not die but by a meer
Dissolution. For it is not to be supposed that a Stab,
or the like, is the only violent Death; Fevers, and a
great many other Distempers, of which one dies in
Bed, are to be counted as such, being caused by those
Humours, against which Nature would not struggle,
if they were Natural.</P>
<P>I cannot understand how it comes to pass that
so many, otherwise prudent and rational, cannot re∣solve
upon laying a Restraint upon their insatiable
Appetites, at Fifty or Threescore Years of Age,
or at least when they begin to feel the Infirmities
of old Age coming upon them. They might rid
themselves of them by a strict Diet; but they be∣come
incurable, because they will not observe a
<HI>Regimen.</HI> I do not wonder so much, that young
People are so hardly brought to such a Resolution;
they are not capable enough of reflecting, and their
Judgment is not solid enough to resist the Charms
of Sense: But at Fifty, a Man ought to be go∣vern'd
by his Reason, which would convince us,
if we would hearken to it, that to gratify all our
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
Appetites, without any Rule or Measure, is the
way to become infirm, and to die young. Nor does
the Pleasure of Taste last long, it hardly begins,
but 'tis gone and past; the more one eats, the more
one may, and the Distempers which it brings along
with it, last us to our Graves. Now should not a
sober Man be very well satisfied, when he is at
Table, upon the Assurance, that as often as he rises
from it, what he eats will do him no Harm?</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MAXIMS for the prolonging of LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS not good to eat too much, or to fast too
long, or to do any thing else that is preter∣natural.</P>
<P>Whoever eats or drinks too much, will be sick.
The Distempers of Repletion are cur'd by Ab∣stinence.</P>
<P>Old Men can fast easily; Men of ripe Age can
fast almost as much; but young Persons, and Chil∣dren,
that are brisk and lively, can hardly fast at all.</P>
<P>Growing Persons have a great deal of Natural
Heat, which requires a great deal of Nourishment,
else the Body will pine away! But Old Men, who
have but little Natural Heat, require but little Food,
and too much overcharges them.</P>
<P>It must be examin'd, what Sort of Persons ought
to feed once or twice a Day, more or less; Allow∣ance
being always made to the Age of the Person,
to the Season of the Year, to the Place where one
lives, and to Custom.</P>
<P>The more you feed foul Bodies, the more you
hurt yourselves.</P>

<P>Human Breath, says M. <HI>Cohausen,</HI> is no other than
Air expressed by the Lungs, and, consequently, satu∣rated
with Particles from the Blood of the Person
discharging it. As a Person labouring under an in∣fectious
Disease may communicate it by his Breath;
so the pure Breath, and insensible Transpiration, of a
healthy young Girl, may contribute to rouse the slug∣gish
Motion of an old Man's Blood, and give it a
brisk and strong Circulation. There are various Ex∣amples
of the great Power of Air and Odours, in
nourishing human Bodies, and at least, in supporting
and maintaining the Lamp of Life, when almost ex∣tinguished.
And he shews, from natural Reason, that
the human Breath may bring People out of a Swoon.</P>
<P>Having laid down these Principles, he states his
Hypothesis thus in the Platonick Style; When <HI>Thyshe</HI>
emits her Breath, she throws off, with that Air, cer∣tain
Spirits or Vapours from her Blood. <HI>Hermippus</HI>
respiring them, they easily mix with his Blood. Thus
the Vapour excited by the vital Heat of <HI>Thysbe,</HI> passes
thro' the Aether into the Lungs and Blood of <HI>Her∣mippus;</HI>
without a Metaphor we may say, that the
Spirits of <HI>Thysbe</HI> warm the Heart of the old Man.
For these Spirits being vigorous, full of Life and
Vivacity, they must naturally re-animate the half-frozen
Blood of <HI>Hermippus.</HI> We may even go so far
as to say, that with his own he enjoys a borrow'd Life;
and therefore we need not wonder, that he should <HI>last</HI>
twice as long as other Men.</P>
<P>The Condition of Life, therefore, which is most
capable of furnishing such a constant Supply of young
and wholsom Breaths, must be very eligible. Our
Doctor suggests that of a Director of a College of
young Women, or, in other Words, a Confessor of
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
youthful Nuns; and in support of this Notion, he re∣marks,
that such as have had the Education of young
People, have frequently reach'd a very advanc'd Age.</P>
<P>The Sophist <HI>Gorgias</HI> lived to be 108, the Sophist
<HI>Protagoras</HI> to 90, the celebrated Philosopher and Rhe∣torician,
<HI>Isocrates,</HI> to 98, the Grammarian <HI>Euphranor</HI>
taught at upwards of 100, and <HI>Orbilius,</HI> who was fa∣mous
for his ill Nature, lived a Century. To these
he adds <HI>Lewis Cornaro,</HI> a Nobleman of <HI>Venice,</HI> who
had been always infirm to his 35th Year, and then
abandoning Medicines, prolong'd his Life to 90 by
Dint of a wise Regimen. Amongst other Particulars
he tells us this; That he bred up 11 of his Nephews,
all Sons of the same Father and Mother, and all stout
healthy Youths; that with these, after he return'd
from the Senate, he us'd to play and dance. He adds,
that little Children made always a Part of his Amuse∣ments,
and that he look'd upon them, till they were
upwards of Five Years old, as so many little Players,
to whom he owed the greatest Pleasure he enjoyed in
the latter Part of his Life, and, which is more to our
Purpose, the Preservation of his Health.</P>
<P>In the Maidens, which he would have bred up un∣der
his <HI>Hermippus,</HI> the Doctor requires that they
should be all young, innocent, chaste, healthy, and
have sweet Breaths. Such, he supposes, was <HI>Abishag</HI>
the Shunamite, whom the Physicians recommended
to King <HI>David</HI> to warm his Blood, by lying with him
in the Night, and serving him in the Day. He like∣wise
supposes, that the innocent Pastimes, the chaste
Caresses, the humourous Frolicks of these young
People, should rejoice and revive the Spirits of the
old Man; who, he takes it for granted, must be of
a gentle, chearful Disposition, and equally ready to
indulge, and even to share in their Pleasures.</P>
