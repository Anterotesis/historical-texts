<HEAD>NORTHAMPTONSHIRE.</HEAD>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS county is situated in the very heart of the kingdom, and is bounded on the east by the counties of Bedford and Hunting∣don; on the south by those of Buckingham and Oxford; on the west by Warwickshire; and on the north by the counties of Leicester, Rutland, and Lincoln, which are separated from it by the lesser Avon, and the Welland. Its greatest length is about fifty miles, its greatest breadth about twenty, and its circumference about one hundred and thirty. It contains thirty-three parishes, in which are one city, eleven market towns, and one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants. Nine mem∣bers are returned to parliament for this county, viz. two knights for the shire, two for the city of
<PB N="4" REF="30"/>
Peterborough, two for each of the towns of North∣ampton and Brockley, and one for Higham Fer∣rers. It lies in the Midland-circuit, and the dio∣cese of Peterborough.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>As this county is dry, well cultivated, free from marshes, except the fens about Peterborough, in the centre of the kingdom, and of course at a distance from the sea, it enjoys a very pure and wholesome air. In consequence of this, it is very populous, and so full of towns and churches, that thirty spires, or sleeples, may be seen in many places at one view: and even in the fens, the inhabitants seem to enjoy a good state of health, and to be little affected by the water, which fre∣quently overflows their grounds, especially in winter, but is never suffered to remain long upon it. Its soil ix exceeding fertile, both in corn and pasturage; but it labours under a scarcity of fuel, as it doth not produce much wood, and by lying at a distance from the sea, cannot be easily sup∣plied with coal. Its commodities, besides corn, are sheep, wool, black-cattle, and salt-petre; and its manufactures, serges, tammies, shalloons, boots, and shoes.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>Besides many lesser brooks and streams, it is well watered by the rivers Nen, Welland, Ouse, and Leam, the three first of which are large, and for the most part navigable.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Peterborough city was antiently called Medes∣well-hamsted, from a spring in the middle of the
<PB N="5" REF="40"/>
river Nen, opposite the town, but afterwards Pe∣terborough, from a monastery built and dedicated to St. Peter, by Wolpher, king of the Mercians. This monastery being destroyed by the Danes, was rebuilt about the year 960, by Ethelwold, bishop of Winchester. At the dissolution of the abbeys, Henry VIII. erected a bishopric here, assigning this county and Rutlandshire for its diocese. The cathedral, which is very antient, is a most stately Gothic fabric. The west front in particular, with its arches and columns, is much admired, as is also the painting of the windows; and the most remarkable monuments are those of Catharine of Spain, queen to Henry VIII. and of Mary, queen of Scots. It is a handsome well built town. The river Nen running hard by, and being navi∣gable, they export by it a great deal of malt and woollen manufactures, and import coal and corn, &amp;c. By a charter from Henry VIII. the corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, and aldermen; but the city officers are elected by the dean and chapter, who are lords of the manor. They have plenty of good water; but their air, on account of the fens in the neighbourhood, is not esteemed very whole∣some. Besides the bishop, dean, and chapter, con∣sisting of six prebendaries, there are eight petty canons, four students in divinity, one epistler, one gospeller, a sub-dean, sub treasurer, a chanter, eight choiristers, eight singing men, two chancel∣lors, a master, usher, and twenty scholars at a grammar-school, besides a steward, organist, and other inferior officers. This city gives the title of earl to the family of the Mordaunts.</P>
<P>Northampton was formerly, as Cambden affirms, called North-afandon, from its situation to the north of the river Nen, called antiently Aufona, by which, and another lesser river, it is almost in∣closed. Dr. Gibson says, that the antient Saxon
<PB N="6" REF="50"/>
annals called both it and Southampton, simply Hamtun, and afterwards, to distinguish them, called the one, from its situation, Southamtun, and the other Northamtun, but never North∣afandon. Tho' it does not appear to be a place of great antiquity, yet here was a castle, and a church dedicated to St. Andrew, built by Simon de Sancto Licio, commonly called Senlez, the first earl of Northampton of that name. It is said to have been burnt down during the Danish depre∣dations; but in the reign of St. Edward it appears to have been a considerable place. It was besieged by the barons in their war with king John, at which time that military work, called Hunshill, is supposed to have been raised. In the time of Henry III. it sided with the barons, when it was besieged and taken by the king. Here the bloody battle was fought in which Henry VI. was taken prisoner; and several parliaments have been held in this town. It was entirely consumed by a most dreadful fire in 1675, yet, by the help of liberal contributions from all parts of the king∣dom, it hath so recovered itself, that it is now one of the neatest and best built towns of the kingdom. Among the public buildings, which are all lofty, the most remarkable are the church called All∣hallows, the sessions and assize house, and the George inn, which belongs to the poor of the town. There was formerly a nunnery in the neighbouring meadows. A county hospital, or infirmary, has been lately built here, after the manner of those of Bath, London, Bristol, &amp;c. It has a considera∣ble manufacture of shoes and stockings, and its fairs are noted for horses both for draught and saddle; besides, it is a great thoroughfare for the north and west roads. It is governed by a mayor, two bailiffs, four aldermen, twelve magistrates,
<PB N="7" REF="60"/>
a recorder, a town-clerk, a common-council, forty eight burgesses, and five serjeants. It gives title of earl to the family of Compton.</P>
<P>Higham Ferrers is a small, but neat, clean town. The first part of its name is derived from its situ∣ation on a rising ground, and the other from the family of Ferrers, who had once a castle here. It stands on the east side of the Nen, and is an antient borough and corporation, governed by a mayor, steward, recorder, seven aldermen, thirteen capi∣tal burgesses and commonalty. It has a free∣school and alms-house, a college for secular clerks and prebendaries, and an hospital for the poor, founded by Henry Chicheley, archbishop of Can∣terbury.</P>
<P>Brackley, that is a place full of brakes or fern, is said to be the third borough in England in point of antiquity. It stands near the head of the Ouse, and was once a noted market for wool; but that advantage it hath lost. Its corporation con∣sists of a mayor, chosen every year at the court∣leet of the lord of the manor, and returned by the steward, six aldermen, and twenty-six bur∣gesses. It has a free-school, and two parish churches.</P>
<P>Oundale, or Oundle, a contraction of Avon∣dale, as being almost surrounded by the Avon, is a neat little town. Here are two stately stone bridges over the river, a free-school, an alms-house founded by Sir William Laxton, lord mayor of London, of which the grocers company in Lon∣don are trustees; and a well, that sometimes makes an odd kind of rumbling noise, the forerunner, as the common people imagine, of war, or some other calamity.</P>
<P>Wellingborough, a large market town upon the Nen, antiently called Wedlingborough. It
<PB N="8" REF="70"/>
was once destroyed by the Danes; and afterwards king John, at the request of the monks of Croy∣land, to whom the manor belonged, granted it a market. In 1738 it suffered greatly by a fire; but hath been since rebuilt. Its mineral waters were formerly much frequented; and Mary, king Charles 1st's queen, was here several weeks drink∣ing them. It has a good market for corn, and a very considerable manufacture of lace.</P>
<P>Thorpston, commonly pronounced Thrapston, is situated in a pleasant valley upon the Avon, which has been made navigable to the town. It is a charming place for such as delight in solitude and rural scenes.</P>
<P>Daventry, or Daintry. This town's chief de∣pendance is upon travellers to and from the north∣west counties, for whose accommodation it hath many inns. Upon a high hill are the remains of a Roman camp, four square, taking up two hun∣dred acres, or thereabouts, in which a great many Roman coins have been found. The Roman high∣way, called Watling-street, passed thro' this town, and is yet plainly distinguishable in several places. Here was formerly a monastery of Augustine friars. The government of the town is vested in a mayor, aldermen, steward, and twelve freemen.</P>
<P>Towcester is a large town upon the highway to Chester, consisting of one long street. From the three bridges over as many branches of a little river, the Roman military way that passes by it, and the coins sometimes found about it, this town is supposed to be the <HI>Tripontium</HI> of Antoni∣nus. The inhabitants are all employed in the manufacture of silk and lace.</P>
<P>Rockingham gives title of earl and marquis to the family of Watson-Wentworth, and stands on the Willand. Here was formerly a castle upon a hill,
<PB N="9" REF="80"/>
surrounded by a forest, extending fourteen miles in length, and four in breadth, in the year 1640, and before it was much larger; but now it is interspersed with towns, fields, and lawns.</P>
<P>Kettering is a handsome town, and pleasantly situated. It has a manufacture of shalloons, serges, and tammies, in which a great many hands are employed.</P>
<P>Rothwell, or Rouwell, is a pretty good town, has a noted horse-fair, and a market-house, em∣bellished with the arms of most of the gentlemen of the county.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Besides the antiquities we have mentioned al∣ready, we must not omit the following: at Chip∣ping-wardon, on the south-west side of the coun∣ty, they often dig up the foundations of antient buildings and Roman coins; and at Charleton, not far from thence, there is a camp, with a dou∣ble fortification, called Ramsborough. Green's Norton, near Lacy forest, was antiently held in capite of the king, for the service of lifting up the right hand towards the king yearly on Christmas∣day, in what place soever he then happened to be. Several antient fortifications have been observed upon the river Nen, as at Mill-Cotton, Chester, and Clifford-hill, which appear to have been the work of the Romans by the coins, urns, &amp;c. found there. At Gildsborough, near Daintrey, the re∣mains of Roman military works are likewise to be seen; and between Catesby and Badby, there is a large encampment, the area of which is about ten acres. More eastward, upon the Nen, stands Wedon on the Street, once the royal seat of Wol∣pher, king of the Mercians, and supposed to be the <HI>Bennavenna</HI> of Antoninus. Within the de∣mesnes
<PB N="10" REF="90"/>
of Boughton is a spring, which incrusteth wood, or any thing that falls into it, with a stony substance. At Caster, and on the opposite side of the river, the <HI>Durobrevae</HI> of the Romans, and the <HI>Dormanchester</HI> of the Saxons, seems to have stood; chequered pavements, and great quantities of Roman coins have been found here, and from hence went two high-ways, the remains of which are still visible, the one called Forty-foot-way, from its being forty foot broad, to Stamford; the other called Long-ditch and High-street, by Lol∣ham bridges, thro' West-Deeping into Lincoln∣shire. Cordyke, a contraction of Caer-dyke, near Peterborough, is a huge fosse or ditch, which seems to have been made by the Romans for draining the fens. Naseby, eleven miles from Northampton, is noted for the bloody battle fought June 14, 1645, between Charles I. and the parliament. At Culworth, not far from Towcester, the stones call∣ed astroites are found; and at Astrop are mineral waters, said to be good in scorbutic and other cases. At Oxenden, near Kettering, is a re∣markable echo. At Chester, near Higham-Fer∣rers, are the remains of a Roman camp, fortified with a stone wall, within which many coins, pave∣ments, &amp;c. have been found. Near Northamp∣ton is Holmeby-house, where Charles I. was im∣prisoned. Fotheringay-castle, where Richard III. was born, and Mary queen of Scots beheaded, is upon a branch of the Nen, near Oundle. In the church are the monuments of Edward and Richard, dukes of York; and its windows are finely painted.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>HUNTINGDONSHIRE.</HEAD>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>It has Bedfordshire on the south, Northampton∣shire on the west and north, where they are part∣ed by the river Avon, and Cambridgeshire on the east. It is but of small extent, not exceeding twenty-five miles in length, twenty in breadth, and seventy in circumference. It is divided into four hundreds, and seventy-nine parishes, containing about two hundred and forty thousand acres, six market-towns, and about fifty thousand inhabi∣tants. As this county, Cambridgeshire, and the isle of Ely, have but one sheriff, he is chosen out of them by turns. It is a part of the diocese of Lincoln, and in the Norfolk circuit. It sends four members to parliament, two for the county, and two for Huntingdon, the archdeacon of which is vested with the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the county.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>In the low marshy grounds the air cannot be supposed to be very wholesome, especially to strangers; but the soil is rich, producing plenty of corn and grass. In the higher grounds, the air is very good; and tho' the soil is not so fertile as in the lower, yet it is very proper for sheep, and accordingly great flocks are grazed there. Herds of cows and black cattle are kept in the fens, which yield also plenty of fish, water-fowl, and turf for fuel. In the fenny ground grow great quantities
<PB N="13" REF="120"/>
of willows, whence the county is sometimes nick∣named Willowshire.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>The chief rivers are the Ouse and Nen. There are several meers or lakes in the county, which yield abundance of fish, but are said to be some∣times greatly agitated, even in calm weather, which is supposed to be owing to subterraneous winds. Medicinal springs too are found in some parts of it.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Huntingdon is the chief town of the county, and gives name to it. It was by the Saxons called Hunter's Down, because in those times the greatest part of the county was a forest; but it was dis∣forested by Henry II. and III. and Edward I. It is a well built town, consisting chiefly of one long street, on the north side of the Ouse, which is na∣vigable as high as Bedford by barges, and has a bridge over it. This town was formerly more considerable, for it had once fifteen churches, which are now reduced to two, an abbey founded by the empress Maud, and a castle, which was demolished by Henry II. It had its first charter from king John; tho' it is not governed according to that charter at present, but by a mayor, twelve aldermen, and burgesses. Here the assizes are always held; and here also is the county gaol, and a good grammar school. The meadows that sur∣round the town are very beautiful, and are ren∣dered more so by the numerous flocks and herds that are fed in them. This town formerly gave title of earl to several princes of Scotland, and was the birth-place of the famous Oliver Crom∣well. At present it gives title of earl to the fa∣mily
<PB N="14" REF="130"/>
of Hastings, and has ever since the reign of Henry VIII.</P>
<P>Godmanchester, antiently called Gormanchester, from Gorman the Dane, who obtained these parts from king Alfred, by an article of the peace con∣cluded between them. The place consists almost entirely of wealthy husbandmen, who being obliged, by their tenure, to attend the king with their ploughs, when he visits these parts, upon such occasions always make a very fine appearance. When James I. passed this way to London, they met him with seventy ploughs and teams, with which he was so well pleased, that he incorpo∣rated them by the name of two bailiffs, twelve assistants, and the commonalty of the borough of Godmanchester. They boast that they have for∣merly entertained the kings of England in their progress, with a rustic shew of nine score of ploughs. It seems to be the same place which Antoninus calls <HI>Duroliponte,</HI> as <HI>Durosiponte,</HI> which differs from the other only by one letter, signifies in the British, a bridge over the Ouse, and it stands on the other side the Ouse, over against Huntingdon. Upon the London road, between Huntingdon and Caxton, and not far from Godmanchester, is the famous tree called the Beggar's-bush. From the name of this tree, it is commonly said of a spend∣thrift in the county, that he is in the way to Beg∣gar's-bush.</P>
<P>St. Neots, or St. Needs, was so called from one Neotus, a learned and pious person, who spent his life in propagating the Christian religion, and had a monastery here dedicated to him, and richly en∣dowed, which was burnt by the Danes. It is a large town, has a handsome church and steeple, and some trade by means of the Ouse, on which it stands, and over which it has a bridge. It gives title of baron to the earl of Sandwich. At Hael∣weston,
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
a small village not far off, are two springs, of which one, that is brackish, is said to give re∣lief in cutaneous disorders, and the other to the dim-sighted.</P>
<P>St. Ives stands upon the Ouse, in the middle of pleasant meadows, and is large and well built, with a fine stone bridge over the river. It derives its name from Ivo, a Persian, who after travelling over England, and preaching the gospel with great zeal, about the year 600, is said to have died here. It seems to have had a mint in former times, and was once famed for its medicinal waters. Not many years ago it suffered greatly by a fire; but hath been since rebuilt.</P>
<P>Kimbolton is a neat town, seated in a bottom, in the west part of the county, and was called by the Romans Kinnebantum. A noble seat is erected upon the foundations of the ancient castle by the Montagues, first earls, and now dukes of Man∣chester, to whom the town gives the title of baron.</P>
<P>Ramsey is noted for its market for fat cattle and water-fowl. Its name signifies the Rams-isle, as it is separated on all sides from terra firma by lakes and fens, except where it is joined to it by a long causey. Formerly it had a famous monastery dedicated to St. Dunstan, whose abbot was mitred, and sat in parliament. This abbey was founded by Alwyn, cousin to king Edgar, and was one of the richest in England, on which account the place was called Ramsey the rich. The gardens, corn-fields, and rich pastures, with which it is surrounded, make it very pleasant in summer. An antient causey passes from hence to Peterborough, called King's-Delf. In 1720 a vast many Roman coins were found; and in 1730 a fire destroyed a great number of houses. Nothing of the abbey is now left, except a part of the gatehouse, and a muti∣lated
<PB N="16" REF="150"/>
statue of Alwyn, thought to be one of the oldest now extant made in England.</P>
<P>Yaxley is a little town, pretty well-built, among the fens. There is another of the same name upon Wittlesey-meer.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES and ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Wittlesey-meer is a lake six miles long, and three broad, the water of which is clear, and well stored with fish, but often agitated when no wind is stirring. The air about it is intolerable to strangers, but agrees with the native well enough. One of these shakes, to which the water is subject, had like to have been fatal to king Canute, as he was passing it with his family.</P>
<P>Henry of Huntingdon says, there was once a city called Caer-Dorm, and Dormeceaster, upon the Nen, nigh Walmsford; but that it was all in ruins before his time. It is now called Darnford. From the resemblance of the names, from the old coins found about it, and other marks of antiquity, it appears to be the Durobriva of Antoninus. From hence there runs a Roman way directly to Huntingdon, which the Saxons called Ermin∣street. Above Stilton it appears with a bank, and runs thro' the middle of a square fort, defended on the north-side with walls, on the rest with ramparts of earth, near which stone coffins have been dug up.</P>
<P>This county has no rare plants, but such as are common to it with Cambridgeshire.</P>

<HEAD>CAMBRIDGESHIRE.</HEAD>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>It is bounded on the east by Norfolk, on the south by Essex and Hertfordshire, on the west by Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire, and on the north by Lincolnshire. It is about forty miles long, twenty-five broad, and one hundred and thirty in circumference, divided into seventeen hundreds, and one hundred and sixty - three parishes, con∣taining about five hundred and seventy thousand acres, one city, one borough, which is also an university, eight market towns, and about ninety∣eight thousand inhabitants. It lies in the diocese of Ely; and sends six members to parliament, two for the county, two for the university, and two for the town of Cambridge.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is very different in different parts of the county. In the fens it is moist and foggy, and therefore not so wholesome; but in the south and east parts it is very good, these being much drier than the other: but both, by late improvements, have been rendered very fruitful, the former by draining, and the latter by cinque-foil; so that it produces plenty of corn, especially barley, saffron, and hemp, affords the richest pastures, and in consequence of that, cattle and butter. The rivers abound with fish, and the fens with wild fowl. The principal manufactures of the county are malt, paper, and baskets.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="18" REF="170"/>
<HEAD>RIVERS and FENS.</HEAD>
<P>The chief rivers are the Ouse, which divides the county into two parts, and is navigable from Cambridge to Lynn in Norfolk; the Cam, which in the British signifies crooked, to denote its winding; the Welland, the Glene, the Witham, and that called Peterborough river, which is na∣vigable to that city from Wisbech.</P>
<P>The fens called Bedford Level consist of about three hundred thousand acres of marshy ground, lying in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Hun∣tingdonshire, Northamptonshire, and Lincolnshire, and surrounded on all hands, except towards the sea, with high lands. As it appears to have been dry land formerly, the great change it has under∣gone must have been owing either to a violent breach and inundation of the sea, or to earth∣quakes. As the towns in and about the fens were great sufferers by the stagnation of the waters in summer, and want of provisions in winter, many attempts were made to drain them, but without success, until the time of Charles I. in which, and that of his son, the work was happily compleated, and an act of parliament passed, by which a cor∣poration was established for its preservation and government. By the same act, eighty-three thou∣sand acres were vested in the corporation, and ten thousand in the king. In these fens are a great many decoys, in which incredible numbers of ducks, and other wild fowl, are caught during the season. Whoever desires a more particular ac∣count of them, may consult Sir Jonas Moor's map and history, Sir William Dugdale's account, and that printed for Moses Pitt in 1685.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Cambridge derives its name from the bridge over the Cam, which divides the town into two parts. Either it, or a place in the neighbourhood, was stiled Camboritum, in the time of the Romans. It suffered much during the wars with the Danes. Here was a castle built by William the Conqueror, of which the gatehouse yet remains, and is now the county gaol. By Doomsday-book it appears, that it then had ten wards, containing three hun∣dred and eighty-seven houses. In William Rufus's reign it was quite destroyed by Roger de Mont∣gomery; but Henry I. bestowed many privileges upon it, particularly an exemption from the power of the sheriff, on condition of its paying yearly in∣to the Exchequer one hundred marks (equivalent to one thousand pounds now) and from tolls, last∣age, pontage, passage, and stallage, in all fairs of his dominions. There is a ditch, still called the King's-ditch, made by Henry III. during the ba∣rons wars, to secure it against the rebels in the isle of Ely. In the rebellion of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, in the reign of Richard II. the University∣records were burnt. The place now called the Jewry was formerly inhabited by Jews. The glory of Cambridge is its university, but when it had its beginning is uncertain. At first there was no public provision for the accommodation or maintenance of the scholars; but afterwards inns began to be erected by pious persons for their
<PB N="20" REF="200"/>
reception; and in the time of Edward I. colleges began to be built and endowed.</P>

<P>The university enjoys great privileges, and is governed by the chancellor, who is always some nobleman, and may be changed every three years, and has a commissary under him; the high-stew∣ard, chosen by the senate; the vice-chancellor, chosen by the whole body of the university, out of two named by the heads of the colleges; two proctors chosen every year; two taxers, who, with the proctors, regulate the weights and mea∣sures. The other officers are, a register, or kee∣per
<PB N="21" REF="210"/>
of the archives, three esquire-beadles, one yeoman-beadle, and a library-keeper. Each col∣lege has its schools and library, as at Oxford, of which those of Trinity and St. John are the most considerable. King George I. purchased, for one thousand pounds, the library of Dr. Moor, bishop of Ely, consisting of thirty thousand volumes, and made a present of it to the university, which, out of gratitude, erected in 1739, a fine marble statue of that prince in the senate-hall of King's∣college. A professor of modern languages and history was also established here and at Oxford, with a salary of four hundred pounds for himself and two to teach under him, by king George I. in 1724. In 1728 a professorship for natural philo∣sophy was erected by Dr. Woodward, a professor at Gresham college, London, with a salary of one hundred and fifty pounds a-year. The same gen∣tleman left them also his collection of fossils, and a part of his library. The master and fellows of Catharine-hall are trustees of an hospital for the cure of poor diseased people gratis, for the build∣ing and furnishing of which Dr. Addenbroke left four thousand pounds. Each college has its cha∣pel for worship; but public sermons are preached at St. Mary's church. The following are the most remarkable structures: 1st, the chapel of King's∣college, which for its contrivance and extent, fine carved work in wood and stone, and painted win∣dows, is hardly to be equalled in the world. It is entirely of free-stone, roof and all, without one pillar to support it. 2d, Trinity-college and li∣brary, wonderful both for the design and execu∣tion. We must not omit to observe, that a fellowship was founded at Magdalen-college, called the travelling Norfolk fellowship, because it is appropriated to gentlemen of that county. Any person, that is qualified, may borrow what∣ever
<PB N="22" REF="220"/>
book he has occasion for, from the libraries at Cambridge; and any one that is qualified may study in those of Oxford. The privilege of send∣ing members to parliament was first granted to the university by James I. The town is governed by a mayor, high-steward, recorder, thirteen alder∣men, of whom the mayor is one, twenty-four common council men, a town-clerk, and other inferior officers. The mayor, when he enters on his office, takes an oath to maintain the privileges of the university. The town has fourteen parish churches, and is pretty large; but the situation is low and dirty.</P>
<P>Ely is an antient city, and took its rise from a famous nunnery and monastery seated there in former times. Henry I. made it an episcopal see; and the civil government, both of the city and isle, belongs to the bishop, who appointeth a judge to hear and determine all causes arising within the same. Tho' a city, it sends no members to par∣liament. It is pretty large, but not populous, by reason of its fenny situation and unwholesome air. The cathedral and bishop's palace are state∣ly structures, and it has a free-school for twenty∣four boys. The name of the town is derived either from the cels, which are very plentiful here, or the willows, which are no less so, and which in Saxon are called Helyz. The ground about it being very rich, and laid out chiefly in gardens, supplies the neighbouring country for a great way with its produce. From this isle the prince of Wales takes the title of marquis.</P>
<P>Wisbich is a well built town in the northern ex∣tremity of the isle of Ely. It had formerly a castle built by William the Conqueror, and re∣built by cardinal Moreton, bishop of Ely. In the year 1236, it suffered much by an inundation of the sea; but it is now a place of good trade, send∣ing
<PB N="23" REF="230"/>
a great deal of oil, oats, and butter, to Lon∣don, and bringing back a variety of commodities, with which it supplies the neighbouring country.</P>
<P>Newmarket is a handsome town, and stands in a good air. Part of it is in this county, and part in Suffolk. Though it is a great thoroughfare, its chief dependence is upon the races, which are the most noted and frequented of any in England. The course upon the heath is a very fine one, where a prodigious crowd of all ranks assembles in the months of April and October, and where great sums are lost and won. At these times the town gets a great deal of money, lodgings and every kind of provision being at an extravagant rate. Charles II. used always to be present at these races, and had a house built for his residence during the continuance of them.</P>
<P>Thorney-abbey, so called from a famous abbey that stood formerly here among bushes and thorns, is situated among the fens to the north-west. It was first called Ankeridge, from the anchorites dwelling there. The abbey was destroyed by the Danes, but rebuilt by Ethelwold, bishop of Win∣chester. In William of Malmsbury's time, it seems, by his description of it, to have been a perfect paradise; but it hath undergone a great change since, by being overwhelmed by the sea.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES and ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Soham was once the see of the bishop of the East Angles, and here the ruins of a church, burnt by the Danes, are still to be seen. It is but an in∣considerable place.</P>
<P>Reches, a small market-town in the hundred of Stane. Here a ditch and rampart, called by the common people the Devil's-dyke, supposed to have been the boundary of the kingdom of the
<PB N="24" REF="240"/>
East-Angles, begins and runs over Newmarket∣heath.</P>
<P>Linton. Here a coal-mine hath been lately discovered, and a Roman military way terminates not far off upon the Ikening. It gave birth to Dr. Richardson, who assisted in translating the Bible in the reign of James I.</P>
<P>Caxton. A Roman way passes through this place, which gave birth to two noted persons, viz. Mathew Paris, the historian, and William, surnamed de Caxton from hence, the first who brought the art of printing into England.</P>
<P>Barnwell, a small village near Cambridge, so called, as Cambden tells us, from the wells, and the boys, or bairns, and other young people, that used to assemble here for sport and exercise on St. John's-eve; whence the fair, that is kept there at Midsummer, took its rise. A most deplorable accident happened, September 1727, in a barn, in which a great number of people, some of them of fashion, were assembled to see a puppet-shew, having been set on fire. Out of about one hundred and thirty, not above five or six escaped, all the rest having been consumed by the flames, or crush∣ed by the roof falling in before the door could be opened.</P>
<P>Gogmagog-Hills are near Cambridge to the south-east, and on the top is an entrenchment, fortified with a threefold rampart, of a circular form, and about forty paces in diameter.</P>
<P>Arbury, or Arborough. Here is an entrench∣ment, which from the form, coins, and nearness of water, (of which that people were particularly careful) is thought to be Roman.</P>
<P>At Trompington, near the Cam, is a place call∣ed Damhill, where Roman urns, pateras, and other antiquities, together with human bones, have been dug up.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="250"/>
Sturbridge-fair, kept by a small brook called the Sture, nigh Cambridge, was once reckoned the greatest in Europe, and is still very considerable. Prodigious quantities of wool, and woollen manu∣factures, are bought and sold here. It is kept in a large corn-field near the Cam, by which goods of all sorts, to an immense value, are transported to it, and from it, to all parts of England, and even Scotland, besides what goes by land. The dealers in hops, which is a great article at this fair, occupy a particular part of the field, as the clothiers and dealers in wool do others. There is a street of booths called Cheapside, in which are shops with wares of all sorts, coffee-houses, taverns, eat∣ing houses, &amp;c. Large commissions for goods are negotiated, over and above what is sold in the fair. The magistrates of Cambridge keep a court of justice in the fair, and proceed in a summary way, which prevents all that disorder and confu∣sion that would otherwise take place. Hackney coaches, from London, ply by land, and wherries upon the Cam, during the fair. After the hurry of business is over, the neighbouring gentry all round visit it, and lay out a great deal of money in toys and diversions.</P>
<P>At Sutton, not far from Ely, in 1694, several small coins, three silver plates, three twisted rings, and one plain, were turned up by the plough.</P>
<P>Besides the Devil's-dyke, already mentioned, there are three others: one called Flem's-dyke, begins at Hinkeston, and runs eastward, by Hil∣dersham, towards Horse-heath, for five miles; the second, called Brent's-ditch, runs from Mel∣bourne, by Fulmer; and the third is near Cam∣bridge, called the Seven-mile-dyke, because it lies seven miles from Newmarket.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>Suffolk, a contract of Southfolk, so called from its situation in respect of Norfolk. It is bounded on the west by Cambridgeshire, on the south by Essex, from which it is parted by the river Stour;
<PB N="31" REF="310"/>
on the east by the German ocean; and on the north by Norfolk, separated from it by the lesser Ouse and the Waverley. It is upwards of forty miles in length, about twenty-five, at a medium, in breadth, and one hundred and fifty-six in cir∣cumference. It contains twenty-two hundreds, thirty-two market-towns, two hundred and seven∣ty-five parishes, thirty-four thousand four hun∣dred and twenty-two houses, and two hundred and six thousand inhabitants. The whole is di∣vided into two parts, viz. the liberty of St. Ed∣mund, and the Geldable; the former of which contain the west parts of the county, and the other the east; and there is a grand jury for each at the assizes.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is reckoned as wholesome and pleasant as any in the kingdom; nor is it otherwise upon the sea-coast, which is dry and sandy, and free from salt marshes. The soil, except to the west and upon the sea-coast, is very rich, being a com∣pound of clay and marle. Towards the sea there are large heaths and tracts of sand; but these pro∣duce hemp, rye, and pease, and feed great flocks of sheep. About Newmarket, the soil is much the same; but in high Suffolk, or the woodlands, besides wood, there are very rich pastures, where abundance of cattle are fed. In other parts of the county, as about Bury, there is plenty of corn. As this county is noted for the richness of its pastures, so is it for butter and cheese, especially the former, which is said to be extraordinary fine; so that be∣ing packed up in firkins, it is sold for all uses, both by sea and land, and conveyed to many parts of England, especially to London. The inland parts of the county are well supplied with wood
<PB N="32" REF="320"/>
for fuel, and those upon the sea-coast with coals from Newcastle. The manufactures of the county are chiefly woollen and linen cloth. It lies in the diocese of Norwich; has two archdeacons, viz. of Sudbury and Suffolk; gives title of earl to a branch of the Howards; sends two members to parlia∣ment for the county; and two for each of the fol∣lowing places, Ipswich, Dunwich, Orford, Ald∣borough, Sudbury, Eye, and St. Edmund's-Bury.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>The county is extremely well watered by the following rivers, which either traverse its borders or run across into the German ocean, viz. the lesser Ouse, the Waveney, the Blithe, the Deben, the Orwell or Gipping, and the Stour.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Ipswich comes from the Saxon Gypeswick, that is, a town situated upon the Gyppen, now called Orwell. It had once twenty-one churches, but now only twelve. It was plundered by the Danes in 991, and afterwards besieged by king Stephen. It had charters and a mint in the reign of king John, but its last charter was from Charles II. The remains of a wall and six or seven religious houses are still to be seen. Though it is not in so flourishing a state as formerly, when the har∣bour was more commodious, yet it is still a large well built town. Besides the churches al∣ready mentioned, it has several meeting-houses, two chapels, a town-hall, council-chamber, a large market-place with a cross in the middle of it, a shire-hall for the county-sessions, a library, seve∣ral hospitals, a free-school, a handsome stone bridge over the river, stately shambles in the mar∣ket-place
<PB N="33" REF="330"/>
built by cardinal Wolsey, who was a native of the town, and a butcher's son, and who also began to build a college here, on the ruins of a small college of black canons, which still bears his name, though it was never finished. Here are also several alms-houses, three charity-schools, and a convenient key and custom-house. By vir∣tue of Charles II's charter, the town is governed by two bailiffs, a recorder, twelve portmen, of whom the bailiffs are two, a town-clerk, two co∣roners, and twenty-four common-council. The bailiffs and twenty-four of the portmen are justices of the peace. The town enjoys a great many privileges,. as passing fines and recoveries, trying criminal, and even crown and capital causes, among themselves, settling the assize of bread, wine, and beer. No freeman is obliged to serve on juries out of the town, or bear any office for the king, except that of sheriff, or to pay tolls or duties in any other part of the kingdom. They have an admiralty jurisdiction beyond Harwich on the Essex coast, and on both sides the Suffolk coast, by which they are intitled to all goods cast on shore. The bailiffs even hold an admiralty-court beyond Landguard-fort. By a trial in king Ed∣ward III's time, it appears that the town had a right to the custom-duties for all goods coming into Harwich haven. They claim a right also to all waifes and strays, &amp;c. The manufactures of the town are chiefly woollen and linen cloth. It has still a considerable foreign trade. The tide rises pretty high, and brings great ships within a small distance of the town. They export a great deal of corn to London, and sometimes to Holland. Formerly they had a great trade in ship-building; but that having declined, they now send great quantities of timber to the king's yard at Chatham. It has several great fairs for cattle, cheese, and but∣ter;
<PB N="34" REF="340"/>
and is admirably situated for the trade to Greenland, because the same wind that carries them out of the river will carry them to Green∣land. It is worth remarking, that it is one of the best places in England for persons in nar∣row circumstances, house rent being easy, provi∣sions cheap and plentiful, the passage by land or water to London, &amp;c. convenient, and the com∣pany of the place good. It gives title of viscount, as well as Thetford, to the duke of Grafton.</P>
<P>Dunwich, that is, a town upon a hill, is very antient, and was once a bishop's see, and before that, seems to have been a Roman station, from the coins sometimes found here. In the reign of William I. it had two hundred and thirty-six burgesses, and one hundred poor. Afterwards it had a mint, and in Henry II's reign, William of Newburrow, tells us, it was a famous village, and well stored with riches of all sorts; but by the loss of its bishop and monasteries, and the in∣roads of the sea, it is now reduced to a parcel of sorry cottages. It is a town corporate, governed by two bailiffs and inferior officers, and has sent burgesses to parliament since Edward Ist's reign. The free burgesses gave king John three hundred marks of silver, ten falcons, and five gerfalcons for his charter, by which they were made a free borough, with power to try causes within their own precincts, and other privileges.

<P>Orford, at the mouth of the Ore, was once a large populous town, but it has suffered much by the sea's retiring. It had formerly a castle, and a nunnery, of both which the ruins are still to be seen, particularly of the castle, whose towers, and those of the church, are a sea-mark. At the Ness there is a light-house, very useful to seamen. It

<P>Eye surrounded by a brook, and standing on the road between Ipswich and Norwich, is but a mean place, the inhabitants being employed chiefly in the manufacture of bone-lace and spin∣ning. King John made it a corporation, to con∣sist of two bailiffs, ten principal burgesses, twenty-four common council men, a recorder, and town∣clerk; the bailiffs are chosen out of the principal burgesses. It has a large church, and gives title of baron to lord Cornwallis.</P>
<P>Aldborough, an antient and pretty large town, consisting of two streets, near a mile in length. There is a handsome church to the west up∣on a hill, and is defended by several pieces of cannon. Great quantities of soles, sprats, and lobsters, are caught here, with which, and with coals and corn, the town drives a pretty good trade. It is a corporation, consisting of twelve superior and twenty-four inferior members, and the latter elect two bailiffs out of the former.</P>

at mace. It gives name to one of the two archdeaconries into which the county is divided, and the title of baron to the duke of Grafton. Here Simon Theobald, archdeacon of Canterbury, who was a native of the town, and beheaded in Wat Tyler's rebellion, lies buried in a chapel of his own building at St. Gregory's church; and here it was where Edward III. placed the Flemings, who first brought the woollen manufacture into England.</P>
<P>St. Edmund's-Bury, or Bury St. Edmund's, was so called after the body of St. Edmund, king of the East Angles, whom the Danes had put to death in a very cruel manner, was brought hither and buried in a stately church. Soon after, an abbey was founded in honour of him, which is said to have been one of the largest and richest in the world. The gate of it is still remaining, and is a very noble piece of antiquity. This place is often mentioned in history. Sueno, the Dane, it is said, laid it all in ashes. In king Henry II's time, the Jews, for murdering a boy here, in de∣rision of our Saviour's crucifixion, and other such offences elsewhere, were banished the kingdom. Near this town the army of the same Henry twice rendezvoused during his contest with his son. Here the barons met, and made their league against king John. Here a parliament was held in the reign of Henry III. and another in that of Edward I. in whose time, and that of Edward II. there was a mint; and it is said there was one in the reign of king John. At a parliament held here the 25th of Henry VI. Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, was murdered, which gave occa∣sion to the war between the houses of Lan∣caster and York. Gardiner, the persecuting bishop of Winchester, was a native of this town, and so was Sir Nicholas Bacon, father of Sir Ni∣cholas,
<PB N="37" REF="370"/>
the first baronet of England, and of the great lord Verulam. Ledgate too, a famous poet about the year 1440, was a monk of this town. In Charles I's reign, the town was so depopulated by a plague, that the grass grew in the streets, and four hundred families were sick of it at the same time. It is a handsome well-built town, and is called the Montpellier of England, not only for its good air, but also for the prospect it commands of a fine open country, and is so regularly built, that almost all the streets cut one another at right angles. It is reckoned three miles in circuit with∣in the walls, and contains five wards, five gates, and thirty-four streets, strait, spacious, and well paved. There are abundance of fine buildings in the town, the most remarkable of which are the two parish churches, which are large and stately, have beautiful windows, neat pillars, and noble roofs. In St. James's is the tomb of Mary II. of France, sister to Henry VIII. At the re∣formation, there were five hospitals, one college, and forty churches and chapels in it, all well en∣dowed. Here is a grammar-school founded by Edward VI. There is little or no manufacture here, but spinning. It has several great fairs; but the chief of them, and perhaps the most noted in England, is that on St. Matthew's day, which lasts a fortnight, during which the neighbouring gentry come to it every afternoon, when they raffle, go to the play, and then to an assembly at some gentleman's house; for a great many gentle∣men live in and about the town. From James I. it obtained the privilege of sending members to parliament, and a charter of incorporation, in consequence of which, it is governed by an al∣derman, recorder, town-clerk, coroner, twelve capital burgesses, and twenty-four common-coun∣cil. In Edward III's time, the townsmen forced
<PB N="38" REF="380"/>
the abbey, and made the abbot and monks their prisoners, till they had sealed a charter of incor∣poration for the town, given it the custody of all its gates, and the wardships of all its pupils and orphans; for which nineteen of the rioters were tried and executed, the rest fled, the town was fined sixty thousand pounds (for which however two thousand marks were accepted) and all the writ∣ings which had been extorted from the abbots and monks made void.</P>
<P>Bungay is a large town almost surrounded by the river Ware. The ruins of a castle, demo∣lished in the reign of Henry III. and of a nunnery are still to be seen In 1688, it was almost de∣stroyed by fire, but has been since handsomely re∣built. It has two parish churches, of which one is very noble, and a grammar school, with ten scholarships for Emanuel college, in Cambridge.</P>
<P>Lestoff, Leostoff, or Lestock, is a small town hanging as it were over the sea.

Here queen Mary resided, while the lady Jane Grey was her compe∣titor for the crown. Sir Robert Hitcham purchased it and the lordship of the earl of Suffolk, and de∣vised them to the master and fellows of Pembroke∣hall for charitable uses. The church, in which are several monuments of the Mowbrays, earls of Norfolk, is a very stately fabric, all of black flint, with a lofty steeple. Here are two alms-houses, the one founded by a baptist-preacher, and the other by Sir Robert Hitcham, who founded also a free-school, and lies interred in the church. Framlingham, in the Saxon, signifies a habitation of strangers, so called from its inha∣bitants the Danes.</P>

Lavenham, or Lanham, is a pleasant town up∣on the side of a hill, at the bottom of which runs a branch of the river Bret, or Breton. Here serges, shalloons, says, and stuffs, are manufactured to a considerable amount, much fine yarn is spun, and from hence many hundred loads of wool are sent to London. This town's fair is noted for good butter and cheese, and their church is reckoned the finest in the county. It was repaired, or rather rebuilt, by Mr. Thomas Spring, a rich clothier, in the reign of Henry VI. assisted by the Veres, earls of Oxford, who have very fine pews in it, with their arms painted upon the windows, and carved upon the arches that support it. There is also a statue of Mr. Spring in brass in the church, and six bells in the tower, remarkably fine. Here is a free-school endowed with thirty pounds a year for the master, besides a school-house and dwelling-house; there are also considerable charities for the mainte∣nance of the poor, and putting their children out apprentices. The town is governed by six capi∣tal burgesses, or headboroughs, who are such for life, and chuse the inferior officers. Both it and manor belonged formerly to the Veres, earls of Oxford, and were always exempted from serving at any court held for the hundred of Baker, in which it stands.</P>

<P>Monmouth, the capital of the county, is so called from its situation at the conflux of the Monow, or Mynwy, and Wye. Here was a castle in William the Conqueror's time, which Henry III. took from John, baron of Monmouth. It afterwards came to the house of Lancaster, who bestowed many privileges upon the town. Here Henry V. surnamed of Monmouth, was born. The corporation consists of two bailiffs, fifteen common-council-men, and a town-clerk. It is a populous well built town, and carries on a considerable trade with Bristol, by means of the Wye. The famous historian, Jeffery of Mon∣mouth, was born at this place. Formerly it gave the title of earl to the family of Cary, and of duke to king Charles IId's eldest natural son; but now of earl to the Mordaunts, who are also earls of Peterborough.</P>
<P>Chepstow, which in Saxon signifies a market, or place of trade, seems to have had its rise from the Venta Silurum of Antoninus, which stood about four miles from hence, and is now called Caer-Went. It is a considerable town, situated upon a hill, close by the river Wye, over which it has an exceeding high bridge, built upon piles.

It had formerly for its lords the Clares, earls of Pembroke, commonly called earls of Pembroke and Strighull, from a neighbouring castle, where they lived, the last of whom was the famous Ri∣chard, surnamed Strongbow, from his strength and skill in archery. Here was formerly a priory, of which the present church was a part, and a strong beautiful castle. It is now the port for all the towns upon the Wye and Lug; for ships of good burden may come up to it, the tide rising upwards of six fathom at the bridge.</P>
<P>Abergavenny, so called from its situation at the confluence of the rivers Usk and Gavenny, is the antient Gobanium of Antoninus. It had former∣ly a priory, has still a strong castle and walls, is a great thorough-fare, has a manufacture of flannels, and gives the title of baron to the antient family of Nevil.</P>
<P>Caerleon, in British the city of the Legion, is the Isca and Legio Secunda of Antoninus, and is thought to have been so called from the Legio Se∣cunda Augusta, or Secunda Britannica, which probably was stationed here to awe the Silures. It appears to have been formerly a very noble city, not only from the descriptions of antient au∣thors, but also from the many inscriptions and other antiquities found in and about it. In the time of the Britons it seems to have been a sort of university and archbishop's see, afterwards transla∣ted to Wales.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The air of the country is very wholesome, but the face of it is very different in different parts; for the eastern part is hilly, and is called Cottes∣wold; the western woody, and called the Forest of Dean; and the rest is a fruitful valley, thro' which the Severn rolls his mighty flood. This river is in some places between two and three miles broad, and its course through the country, including its windings, is not less than seventy miles. The tide of flood, called the Boar, rises very high, and is very impetuous. It is remarkable, that the greatest tides are one year at the full moon, and the other at the new; one year the night-tides, and the next the day. This river affords a noble convey∣ance for goods and merchandise of all sorts, to and from the county; but it is watered by several others, as the Wye, the Avon, the Isis, the Le∣den, the Frome, the Strond, and Windrush, be∣sides lesser streams, all abounding with fish, the Severn in particular with salmon, conger-eels, and lampreys. The soil is in general very fertile, tho' pretty much diversified, yielding plenty of corn, pasture, fruit, and wood. In the hilly part of the county, or Cotteswold, the air is sharper than in the lowlands, and the soil, though not so fit for grain, produces excellent pasture for sheep; so that of the four hundred thousand that are com∣puted to be kept in the county, the greater part are fed here. Of these sheep the wool is ex∣ceeding fine, and hence it is that this shire is so eminent for its manufacture of cloth, of which fifty thousand pieces are said to have been made yearly, before the practice of clandestinely exporting our wool became so common. In the vale, or lower part of the county, thro' which the Severn passes,
<PB N="51" REF="510"/>
the air and soil are very different from those of the Cotteswold; for the former is much warmer and richer, yielding the most luxuriant pastures; in consequence of which numerous herds of black cattle are kept, and great quantities of that excellent cheese, for which it is so much cele∣brated, made in it. The remaining part of the county, called the Forest of Dean, was formerly almost entirely over-run with wood, and extended twenty miles in length, and ten in breadth. It was then a nest of robbers, especially towards the Severn; but now it contains many towns and vil∣lages, consisting chiefly of miners, employed in the coal-pits, or in digging for, or forging iron ore, with both which the forest abounds. These miners have their particular laws, customs, courts, and judges; and the king, as in all royal forests, has a swain-mote, for the preservation of the vert and venison. This forest was antiently, and is still noted for its oaks, which thrive here surpri∣singly; but as there is a prodigious consumption of wood in the forges, it is continually dwindling way. <Q>There were so many religious houses in the county before the reformation, that it gave occa∣sion to the proverb, “As sure as God is in Glo∣cestershire.”</Q></P>

<P>Glocester, the capital, is an antient city, and by Antoninus is called Clevum, or Glevum, which Cambden thinks was formed from the British Caer-Glowe, signifying a fair city. It was built by the Romans to curb the Silures, and a colony was placed there called Colonia Glevum. It stands upon the bank of the Severn, and ex∣cept on the side next the river, is surrounded by a wall. Towards the south there was antiently a castle built in the time of William the Conqueror,

In the south isle Edward II. lies interred in an alabaster tomb; and not far from him, in the middle of the quire, Ro∣bert Curt hose, eldest son of William the Con∣queror. This city suffered much in the barons wars, was plundered by Edward, the son of Henry III. and not long after almost entirely destroyed by an accidental fire. King John made it a borough; and Henry III. who was crowned here, a corporation. Richard III. made it a county of itself, adding two hundreds to it, and gave it his sword and cap of maintenance. It had once eleven parish churches, but five of them were demolished, when it was besieged by Charles I. against whom it had shut its gates. In the reign of Charles II. its walls were pulled down, and two hundreds taken from its county by act of parliament. It was erected into an episcopal see by Henry VIII. on the sup∣pression of the abbey of St. Peter, with a dean and six prebends. About the time of the conquest, its chief business seems to have been forging of iron; for in Doomsday-book it is said, that the only tribute required of it was so many icres, or bars of iron. At present it has ten incorporated companies, a stone-bridge over the river, with a key and wharf; and tho' it is so well situated for trade, yet its traffic is not considerable, having been much impaired by the neighbourhood of Bristol. One of its chief manufactures now is pin∣making. Several parliaments were antiently held here, particularly by Richard II. and III. and in
<PB N="53" REF="530"/>
the town are many crosses and statues of the kings of England. By a charter from Charles II. it is governed by a steward, mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, a town clerk, two sheriffs chosen yearly out of twenty-six common-council men, a sword∣bearer, and four serjeants at mace. Cambden says, the Roman-way, that extends from St. David's in Wales to Southampton, passes thro' this city. It gives title of duke to the second brother of his pre∣sent majesty George III.</P>
<P>Cirencester takes its name from the river Churn, on which it stands. It is very antient, being by Ptolemy called Corinium, and by Antoninus Du∣rocornovium. That it was a considerable place in the time of the Romans, is manifest from the inscriptions in marble, coins, chequered pavements, baths, and highways that have been discovered. It is said to have been taken from the Britons by Ceaulin, king of the West Saxons. Penda, the Mercian, afterwards laid siege to it with a great army, but was defeated by Cineglise, king of the West-Saxons. It afterwards became subject to the Mercians, and suffered much from the Danes. Henry III. ordered the castle to be razed to the ground. Richard I. was a great benefactor to the town and abbey; as was also Henry IV. who granted them several privileges. It was formerly very large, as appears by the walls, which would contain four towns as big as the present. It had also three churches antiently, of which only one remains, much admired for its lofty tower, chapels, and painted glass. Its fairs and markets are among the most considerable in the kingdom for wool and cloth, of which a great deal is manufactured in this town. It has had charters from several kings, and is governed at present by two high∣constables, and fourteen wardsmen over seven wards, chosen yearly at the court-leet. Here is
<PB N="54" REF="540"/>
a free-school, and several alms-houses. In a mount on the west-side, called Grismund's tower, human bones of a gigantic size have been found.</P>
<P>Tewksbury stands at the conflux of the Severn and Avon, and had its name from one Theocus, who led the life of a hermit in this place. Here was antiently a famous monastery, founded in the year 715, by Odo and Dodo, two brothers; and in the year 1470, was fought a bloody battle at this place, betwixt the houses of York and Lan∣caster, in which the Lancastrians were defeated. It is a large, populous, well built town, consisting chiefly of three streets, with three bridges leading to it over three rivers, a free-school, hospital, and a very large and noble church, in which are seve∣ral monuments of great men, particularly of Ed∣ward, son of Henry VI. and of the duke of Cla∣rence, brother to Edward IV. This corporation was dissolved by a proclamation of James II. but at present it is governed by twenty-four burgesses, two of whom are chosen bailiffs yearly, who, with two others, are the ruling magistrates, and sole justices of the peace within the town. It is famous for the manufacture of woollen-cloth, stockings, and mustard.</P>
<P>Campden, on the edge of the county next Wor∣cestershire. The Saxon kings are said to have had a congress here in 689, to consult how to carry on the war against the Britons. It is a market-town, and has a great manufacture of stockings. Sir Baptist Hicks, created by Charles I. viscount Campden, was a great benefactor to it, and lies buried in the south-isle of the church, in which, besides his, are many other noble monuments of marble. It has a right to the tolls of the fairs on Ash-Wednesday and St. Andrew's day, but that of the others belong to the lord of the manor. This town had its charter from James I. and is governed by two
<PB N="55" REF="550"/>
bailiffs, twelve burgesses, and a steward, who have authority to chuse twelve inferior burgesses, and to determine in actions for debt not exceed∣ing six pounds thirteen shillings and four-pence. It gives the title of viscount to the earl of Gains∣borough.</P>
<P>Newent, in the Forest of Dean, has its name from an inn, built for the reception of travellers to and from Wales. It stands on a river that falls into the Severn, and is navigable by boats. It is a pretty large place, and has a parish twenty miles in compass, containing several hamlets.</P>
<P>Dean, alias Michael-Dean, is also in the Forest, and consists chiefly of one street, with a good church. Pins are its principal manufacture.</P>
<P>Cheltenham, or Chiltenham, is so named from the brook Chilt, which runs thro' the parish. It is noted chiefly for its malt and mineral waters, which are said to be of much the same quality as those of Scarborough. There are two other par∣ticulars worth mentioning in relation to this place. The first is, that the minister of the parish must be a fellow of Jesus-college, Oxford, nominated by that society, and approved of by the earl of Gains∣borough, and can hold the living only six years. The next is, that the manor paid to Edward the Confessor nine pounds a-year, and three thousand loaves for his dogs; and to William the Conqueror twenty pounds a-year, and twenty-five pounds a-year for bread to his dogs.</P>
<P>Stow, on the Would, is a large market-town, said to have but one element, viz. air; there being neither wood, common-field, nor water belong∣ing to it. The forces of Charles I. were routed at this place by those of the parliament, March 21, 1648. It has an hospital, alms-house, and free-school; and its fairs are much frequented for cheese, hops, and sheep. The Roman fosse-way passes thro' it.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="560"/>
North-leche, on the river Leche, is governed by a bailiff, and two constables. It has a neat church, several alms-houses, and a well endowed free-school. It is said that the founder, being in want afterwards, applied to the trustees to be ap∣pointed master of it, but his suit was refused</P>
<P>Painswick, which takes its name from its an∣tient lords of the sur-name of Paine, is situated upon the river Stroud, in a wholesome air. Its situation is advantageous for carrying on the wool∣len manufacture.</P>
<P>Stroud is on the slope of a hill, at the bottom of which is Stroud-water. This water being of a quality that makes it very proper for dying scar∣let, and other grain colours, is the occasion that its banks, and this town in particular, are inhabi∣ted chiefly by clothiers, who have erected many fulling-mills upon it. It has a handsome church, a free-school, and work-house in it.</P>
<P>Berkley, an antient borough governed by a mayor and aldermen. The mayor is sworn at the court-leet of the earl of Berkley, who is lord of the manor and castle, from which he derives both his name and title. It gives name also to the pa∣rish, which is the largest in the county, and to the hundred, most of the towns of which depend up∣on it, besides many others in the shire. The family of Berkley had hardly its equal for antiquity and illustrious descent, for they have been barons ever since the reign of Henry II. and quarter in their arms the coats of twenty noble families. Of the great value of the manor to the lord, we may form some judgment by the fee-farm rent paid to the crown, so early as the reign of Henry II. which was five hundred pounds. Here Edward II. was imprisoned, and the little room in the castle in which he was murdered, is still to be seen. The town and parish, lying low upon the Severn, are not reckoned very healthy.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="570"/>
Dursley, a market-town, famous for cloathing, is a corporation, and is governed by a bailiff and four constables, but sends no members to par∣liament. Here was antiently a castle, and there is a field near the town still called Castle-field. Here is also a rock of stone, called by the inhabi∣tants puff-stone, which, though soft and easy to hew, is yet surprizingly durable, as appears from the castle of Berkley, which is built with it, and which, though above six hundred years old, yet discovers no symptoms of decay. The town gives the title of viscount to the earl of Berkley.</P>
<P>Fairford stands on the Coln, over which it has two large bridges. The church is remarka∣ble for its painted glass, designed by Albert Du∣rer, and taken by one Tame, a merchant, on board a ship bound to Rome, who afterwards pur∣chased the manor of Henry VIII. and built the church. In the parish, which is ten miles in com∣pass, are many barrows; and medals and coins are often found in it.</P>
<P>Thornbury is two miles from the Severn, has four small alms-houses, a free-school, and a large church in form of a cathedral. Here a castle was begun, but never finished, in the reign of Henry VIII. by Edward, duke of Buckingham. It has a titular mayor, twelve aldermen, and two con∣stables.</P>
<P>Lechlade, so called from its standing at the con∣flux of the Lech and Thames, is supposed to have been antiently a Roman town. It is now popu∣lous, being a great thoroughfare, and sending butter, cheese, and other goods to London, by the Thames, which begins to be navigable for barges here. In 1670, Laurence Bathurst, es{que} gave the whole rectory impropriate, to the value of two hundred and forty pounds per annum, to the vicarage of this place.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="580"/>
Aust stands on a craggy cliff on the banks of the Severn. Here, till very lately, was a ferry over the Severn, which is now two miles lower. As the passage was antiently at Oldbury, it is supposed to be the Trajectus of Antoninus, oppo∣site to Abone, or Avone, now, probably, the lit∣tle village Aventon, or Alvington.</P>
<P>Tetbury stands on a rising ground, and is a large handsome town, but ill provided with water. Here is a great market for yarn, a free-school, and alms-house, and the inhabitants have a right to the tolls of their fairs and markets. A bailiff is chosen yearly for the management of their reve∣nues. At Kingscot near this place, Roman coins have been frequently found, and there is a large camp, called Bury-hill, not far off.</P>
<P>Wotton under Edge is a handsome town, noted for its woollen manufactures. The chief magis∣trate, who is called a mayor, is chosen yearly at the earl of Berkley's court leet. Here is a stately church with some monuments of the Berkley fa∣mily, a free-school, and alms-house. Hugh Per∣ry, esquire, an alderman of London, and a na∣tive of this place, was a great benefactor to it; as was also Sir Jonathan Daws and his family.</P>
<P>In the hundred to which this town gives name, lies Kingswood, a forest formerly of great extent, but now containing only about five thousand acres, which have been granted to several gentlemen by patent from the crown, and consist mostly of coal mines. The parish of Kingswood is tithe-free, in consequence of a grant to an abbey that formerly stood in it, and, though surrounded by Glocester∣shire, is in the county of Wilts.</P>
<P>At a place called Conham, about a mile from Bristol, and on the edge of the forest, are great works for smelting copper, making brass, which are supplied with coal from the forest, and with the ore from Cornwall and Ireland.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="590"/>
Chipping Sudbury, an antient borough and great thoroughfare. It has a considerable trade likewise in coal, lime, cheese, and corn; and it has also a free-school. The bailiffs and burghers have a power to assign eighty-eight cow-pastures to as many of the inhabitants, and eight acres of meadow for their own lives and those of their widows, and to grant them to others as they fall.</P>
<P>Marshfield is considerable for its manufacture of malt and cloth, and is famous for cakes. It is governed by a bailiff, who has power to punish delinquents within its liberties.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The parish of Clifton near Bristol, is noted for the hot-well, and those stupendous rocks upon the Avon, called St. Vincent's rocks, on the top of which is a fortification and a camp. Near Tewkes∣bury, on the top of a hill called Towbery-hill, is an encampment; and in the Severn is the isle of Alney, where Edmund, king of the English, and Canute, king of the Danes, agreed to deter∣mine their right to the kingdom by single com∣bat. Not far from Stroud, in the parish of Bis∣ley, was born the famous friar Bacon, and edu∣cated at St. Mary's chapel, now St. Bury-mill, on Stroud-water. On the hills near Alderley, at the head of the little river Avon, are stones resem∣bling cockles and oysters. At Alderley was born the famous Sir Matthew Hale, lord chief justice of England. In the parish of Avelston near Aust, is a large round camp, and another, not far frem thence, at Castle hill. In the parish of Puckle-church, was antiently a royal villa, where Edmund, king of England, was killed with a dagger, as he interposed between his sewer and one Leof, a notorions outlaw. About three
<PB N="60" REF="600"/>
miles from Bristol, is Penpark-hole, which is a vast cavity, seventy-five yards in length, forty in breadth, and nineteen in height, the mouth of which is forty yards deep, but very narrow. At Woodchester, not far from Glocester, was discovered anno 1722, a curious mosaic pave∣ment, representing birds and beasts in their natu∣ral colours, and another since at Cromhall, six∣teen miles from Glocester. At Henbury, two miles from St. Vincent's rocks, is a camp with three rampires, or trenches. Near Derham, in the parish of Old Alston, a hole, like the tunnel of a chimney, was discovered in ploughing, thro' which, some persons being let down, found a ca∣vity extending half a mile. At Tormarton, a lit∣tle to the north of Derham, are stones resembling bullets, others with cockle-shells incorporated into them, and a petrifying spring. Coins are often ploughed up at Lemington, where there seems to have been a station of the Romans. In the garden of the manor-house at Wickmar, is a chesnut-tree, which measures nineteen yards about, and at Slymbridge, on the Severn, is a family of the name, which, for many generations, has had five fingers and a thumb upon each hand. At Farmington, near North Lech, is an exceeding large Roman camp called Norbury.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>On the west it borders upon Glocestershire; on the south, where it is broadest, the river Isis di∣vides it from Berkshire; on the east it is bounded by Buckinghamshire; and on the north, where it terminates in a narrow point, it has on the one side Northamptonshire, and on the other War∣wickshire. It extends from Cleydon to Caver∣sham forty-two miles in length, and from Cley∣don to Farringdon twenty-six in breadth, making about one hundred and thirty in circumference, within which are contained one city, fifteen mar∣ket towns, two hundred and eighty parishes, fourteen hundreds, five hundred and thirty-four thousand acres, and about one hundred and twenty thousand souls.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The air is sweet and pleasant, and the soil rich and fertile. The lower parts consist of meadows and corn-fields, and the higher were covered with woods till the civil wars, in which they were so entirely destroyed, that wood is now extremely scarce and dear, except in what is called the Chil∣tern, and so is coal; of consequence fuel bears an exorbitant price. The county is extremely well watered; for, besides the Isis, Tame, Cher∣well, Evenlode, and Windrush, there is a great number of lesser rivers and brooks. One of the four great Roman ways passes quite thro' it, en∣tering at the parish of Chinner, and going out at

<P>Oxford, so celebrated for its university, is plea∣santly seated in a plain with a fine fruitful country all around. The composition of the name is ob∣vious. In the British times it seems to have been a place of study; but in the Saxon aera, it was noted only for a religious house dedicated to St. Frideswide, till Alfred built three colleges, one for grammarians, another for philosophers, and a third for divines. Learning continued to flou∣rish till the city was sacked and burnt by the Danes in the reign of Etheldred, and after that Harold, surnamed Harefoot, treated it with great severity upon some provocation he had received. It seems to have been besieged and taken by Wil∣liam the Conqueror, and to have been deserted by the learned from that time till about the year 1129, when one Robert Pulein began to read lectures in divinity; and such was the resort of stu∣dents to it, that in the reign of king John, there were not fewer than three thousand. Robert d'Oily, a Norman, to whom William the Con∣queror had given the greatest part of it, built a castle on the west side in 1071; and he is also sup∣posed to have surrounded it with walls. In a pa∣lace built by Henry I. was born Richard I. commonly called Coeur de Lion. About the tenth of king John, there happened a quarrel between the citizens and students, in consequence of which many of the latter quitted it, but returned again
<PB N="65" REF="650"/>
a few years afterwards. Here Henry III. held a parliament to settle the differences betwixt him and his barons, when he confirmed the privileges granted to the university by his predecessors, and added others of his own. In this reign the stu∣dents are said to have been thirty thousand, who were all excommunicated by the pope for some rudeness to his legate. In Edward III's time, they were split into two factions, called the northern and southern men, a division which was attended with many disorders and much violence, but in a short time concord and harmony again prevailed. As colleges began about this time to be founded and endowed, we shall here present our readers with a list of them, together with the time when, and persons by whom they were founded.</P>

<P>Worcester was called Gloucester-hall till lately, that it was endowed by Sir Thomas Coke, and made collegiate.</P>
<P>Hartford was Hart-hall till 1740, that it was erected into a college.</P>
<P>All these are richly endowed, and have fine gardens, libraries, chapels, &amp;c. The halls, in which the students maintain themselves, except a few that have exhibitions, are these: St. Ed∣mund's, belonging to Queen's college; Magda∣len, to Magdalen-college; St. Alban's, to Mer∣ton; St. Mary's, to Oriel; New-Inn, to New∣college. Several persons have been great bene∣factors to particular colleges, as Dr. Ratcliffe to University-college; colonel Codrington and Dr. Clarke, to All-Souls; queen Caroline, to Queen's; the before-mentioned Dr. Clarke and Mrs. Eaton, to Worcester; Dr. Wake, archbishop of Canter∣bury, to Christ-Church. The most considerable of these colleges are Magdalen's and Christ-Church, which are as noble foundations as any in the world. The church of the latter is the ca∣thedral, and has a dean, eight canons, eight chaplains, eight singing men, eight choiristers, a teacher of musick, and an organist. Each of the colleges has its visitor appointed by its statutes, except Christ-Church, which is subject to the vi∣sitation of the sovereign alone. The other remark∣able buildings belonging to the university are; first, the public schools; secondly, the Bodleian or pub∣lic library; thirdly, Ratcliffe's library, a most ele∣gant structure, for building and furnishing which Dr. Ratcliffe left forty thousand pounds; fourthly,
<PB N="66" REF="670"/>
the theatre, built by Sheldon, archbishop of Can∣terbury; fifthly, the museum, in which is an ela∣boratory and a repository for natural and artificial rarities and antiquities; sixthly, the Clarendon printing house, so called, because it was built partly with the money arising to the university by the sale of lord Clarendon's history. To the south of Mag∣dalen college lies the physic garden, instituted by the earl of Danby, and much improved by Dr. Sherrard. It contains five acres, in which is a compleat series of such plants as grow naturally, disposed in their respective classes; together with two neat and convenient green-houses, stocked with a valuable collection of exotics, and a hot∣house, where various plants brought from the warmer climates are raised. The whole body of the university, including professors, fellows, and stu∣dents of all sorts, exceeds three thousand. Each college has its particular statutes and rules for its government. There are four terms in the year for public exercises, &amp;c. and particular days and hours for public lectures by the several professors. The university is governed by a chancellor, high-steward, vice-chancellor, two proctors, a public orator, a keeper of the archives, a register, three 'squire∣beadles, and three yeomen-beadles. As to the city, it has had the same privileges granted to it as London, particularly an exemption from toll all over England. It is governed by a mayor, high-steward, recorder, four aldermen, eight as∣sistants, two bailiffs, a town-clerk, two chamber∣lains, all that have borne the office of bailiff and chamberlain, and twenty-four common-council men; but these are subject to the chancellor or vice-chancellor of the university in all affairs of moment: and not only the mayor, but the prin∣cipal citizens, and sheriff of the county, take an oath to maintain the privileges of the university. The city, including the colleges, is one of the
<PB N="67" REF="680"/>
largest in England, having thirteen parish churches, besides the cathedral, well-built, clean, and re∣gular. At the entrance of the town from the Woodstock and Banbury roads, a neat hospital hath been lately erected by the trustees of Dr. Ratcliffe's benefaction, out of the surplus money remaining after defraying the expence of his library. The male∣line of the family of Vere, to whom the city had given the title of earl for five hundred years, failing in Aubrey de Vere, who was twentieth earl, queen Anne conferred the title upon Robert Harley, a descendant of the Veres, in whose family it still continues. The chief trade of the city is in malt, conveyed in barges to London.</P>
<P>New Woodstock, signifying a woody place, is seated upon a small brook that falls into the Even∣lode. In this town king Etheldred is said to have held an assembly of the states, and Alfred to have translated Boetius de Consolatione Philosophiae. King Henry I. built a palace here, and enclosed a large park with a stone wall, which some think to have been the first that was raised in England. Henry II. is said to have built a labyrinth here to conceal the fair Rosamond from the restless jea∣lousy of his queen. The park and manor conti∣nued in the crown, till queen Anne, by act of parliament, bestowed them upon the duke of Marlborough, as a reward for his eminent and un∣paralleled services. A very noble and magnifi∣cent house was also erected for him at the public expence within the manor, called, from the great victory obtained over the French and Bavarians at Blenheim, upon the Danube, Blenheim-house, or castle. The gardens and other ornaments are in all respect suited to the grandeur and magnifi∣cence of the house, the furniture of which is also extremely fine, especially the tapestry hangings, representing the duke's battles. For the manor and castle the duke's descendants are obliged, by
<PB N="68" REF="690"/>
way of homage, to present yearly a standard to the sovereign on the day on which the battle of Blenheim was fought. Upon a vast obelisk in the park is inscribed a short account of the duke's exploits and character; and at the principal en∣trance from the town is a stately triumphal arch erected to his memory. The Roman highway, called Akeman street, passes through this park. The town is large and well built, has a manu∣facture of polished steel wares and gloves; and is governed by a mayor, high steward, recorder, four aldermen, two chamberlains, and sixteen com∣mon-council. It is noted for being the birth∣place of Edmund, son to Edward I. surnamed of Woodstock; of Edward the Black Prince, and his brother Thomas of Woodstock; and the poet Chaucer. Here queen Elizabeth was confined by her sister queen Mary. His grace the duke of Portland takes the title of viscount from hence.</P>
<P>Banbury stands upon the Cherwell. Here was a castle built by Alexander, bishop of Lincoln; and about three miles from hence was fought that battle, in which the earl of Warwick defeated Edward IV. and the Lancastrian party. The an∣tiquity of the place appears from the coins of Ro∣man emperors often found in the adjoining fields. It had its first charter from queen Mary, the next from James I. and the third and last, from George I. in consequence of which, it is now go∣verned by a mayor, high-steward, recorder, six capital burgesses, and thirty assistants. Being surrounded with rich meadows, it was antiently, and is still, noted for excellent cheese.</P>
<P>Whitney stands upon the Windrush, and is an antient town. It sent members to parliament till the thirty-third of Edward III. So much wool is spun here for rugs and blankets, for which the town is noted, that above a hundred packs are
<PB N="69" REF="700"/>
said to be consumed in a week. Their rugs and blankets are greatly admired, and employ a vast number of hands in and about the town. They have also a manufacture of duffils, of tilts for bargemen, and cuts for hammocks. Great quantities of sheep-skins are likewise dressed and stained here, and made into breeches and jackets. Near this place lies Whichwood-forest, antiently of great extent, but now much reduced.</P>
<P>Henley stands upon the Thames, in the extre∣mity of the county. Dr. Plot supposes it to be the oldest own in it, and Dr. Gale will have it to be the Galleva Atrebatum of Antoninus, on ac∣count of the Roman coins found here, and the military way that runs from Spinae to this place. The inhabitants are mostly maltsters, bargemen, and mealmen; and vast quantities of corn, malt, meal, and wood, are conveyed from hence to London. Its market is one of the greatest in England for corn. It is a thriving well built town, governed by a warden, burgesses, and other officers; and has two free-schools and an alms-house.</P>
<P>Dorchester stands upon the Tame, and appears from the coins frequently found about it, to have been a Roman station. In the Saxon times it was the see of a bishop, which was removed in the time of William the Conqueror to Lincoln. Here was antiently an abbey of regular canons. It is said no snakes or venemous creatures have ever been seen about it. However, it is now but a mean inconsiderable place.</P>
<P>Burford is situated upon the Windrush. Near this town at a place, still called Battle-Edge, Athelbald, king of the West Saxons, as it is thought, was entirely defeated by Cuthred, king of the Mercians. Here too a council was con∣vened in 685 by the kings Etheldred and Berth∣wald. It had a charter from Henry II. and is go∣verned
<PB N="70" REF="710"/>
at present by two bailiffs and other inferior officers. Its market is noted for saddles, and the neighbouring downs for horse-races, by which the town is much benefited. It was the birth-place of Dr. Heylin, author of the Cosmography, &amp;c. and gives title of earl to the duke of St. Albans.</P>
<P>Chipping-Norton seems to derive the first part of its name from the Saxon word ceapan, to cheapen, and to have been antiently a market. It is now governed by two bailiffs and inferior officers, who have power to determine actions under four pounds value. It is said to have had both a castle and monastery formerly, and Roman coins are often found about it.</P>
<P>Tame is seated pleasantly on the river from which it derives its name. It was much indebted to Lexington, bishop of Lincoln, who brought the great road through it, which before lay at some distance. It has a free-school and alms-house founded by lord Williams, of Tame, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and is a large town, with a good market, the river being navigable to it by barges.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which is supposed to derive its name from the Saxon word Buc, denoting a hart or buck, is bounded on the south by Berkshire, from which it is parted by the Thames; on the west by Oxfordshire; on the north by Northamp∣tonshire; on the east by Bedfordshire, Hertford∣shire, and Middlesex. Its length is thirty-nine miles, breadth eighteen, and circumference one
<PB N="74" REF="750"/>
hundred and thirty-eight, in which space it con∣tains four hundred and forty-one thousand acres, eight hundreds, three to the south and five to the north of the Chiltern, eleven market-towns, six parliamentary boroughs, one hundred and eighty∣five parishes, and about one hundred and eleven thousand three hundred souls. The boroughs are Buckingham, Chipping - Wycomb, Ayles∣sbury, Agmondesham, Wendover, and Great-Marlow, each of which sends two members to parliament, and the county two, in all fourteen. It lies in the diocese of Lincoln, and Norfolk cir∣cuit, and gives the title of earl to the family of Hobart.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is good, especially upon the Chiltern: but tho' in the vale the air may not be altogether so pure and serene as upon the hills, the soil is much more fruitful; yet that of the Chiltern is far from being barren, for, besides feeding large flocks of sheep, it produces very good wheat and barley. The meadows of the vale are among the richest pastures of England, as the sheep are among the largest, tho' the mutton is not so good as that of the Downs, nor the beef equal to that of So∣mersetshire. The Chiltern was formerly over-run with wood, and infamous for being a harbour for thieves; but it hath been long cleared both of the one and the other. The graziers of the vale are as considerable as any in England; and their herds of cattle as numerous and of as large a size. The county is also well furnished with wood and water, so that it is inferior to few in England. The chief manufactures are paper and bone∣lace; the last of which is almost equal to that of Flanders.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Buckingham, the county town, stands on the Ouse, by which it is almost surrounded. Edward the Elder fortified it in the year 918 with a ram∣part and turrets, against the incursions of the Danes. It seems, however, to have been but an inconsiderable place at the conquest; for, accord∣ing to Doomsday-book, it paid only for one hide, and had but twenty-six burgesses. It had former∣ly a castle in the middle of the town, of which scarce any vestiges now remain. The shrine of St. Rumbald, the patron of fishermen, preserved in its church, was held in great veneration. The town is now large and populous, has three bridges over the Ouse, a free-school, and town-hall, a handsome structure, in which the weights and measures of the county are kept by act of parliament. The county gaol stands in this town, and here the assizes are some∣times kept. It was formerly a staple for wool, but taht advantage it hath now lost. It is governed by a bailiff, and twelve burgesses, who are the sole electors of the members. In its neighbourhood are many paper-mills upon the Ouse.</P>
<P>Chipping-Wycomb, or High-Wickham, is si∣tuated upon a small river, in a low ground, sur∣rounded with pleasant hills. It is an antient, large, well-built, wealthy town, was made a free borough by Henry I. and began to send members to parliament the 28th of Edward I. The manor is held of the dean and canons of Windsor, to whom the corporation pay a quit-rent of twenty∣six
<PB N="76" REF="770"/>
pounds per annum. It is governed by a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, a town-clerk, and two bailiffs, with a common-council. Its market is so considerable, especially for corn, that the toll of it was many years ago let for a hundred and fifty pounds, besides one hundred pounds fine. It is a great thoroughfare upon the Oxford-road, and there are many mills for paper and corn in the neighbourhood. Most of the flour made here is conveyed in barges from Marlow to London. There is a free-grammar-school, with several alms-houses, endowed with lands that formerly belonged to a monastery and an hospital of St. John of Jerusalem. The assizes are sometimes kept at this place; and near the town, in 1724, was discovered a curious tesselated pavement.</P>
<P>Aylesbury stands at the east-end of the vale, not far from the river Tame, on a rising ground, sur∣rounded by rich meadows and pastures. It was antiently famous for St. Adith, who was so cele∣brated for her sanctity, that she is reported to have performed many miracles. Some lands, we are told, were antiently held here, on condition that the possessor should provide straw for the king's bed three times a-year, if he should come so often thither. If he came in winter, he was also to straw his chamber, and find him three eels; if in sum∣mer, he was to provide sweet herbs for his cham∣ber, and two green geese. Chief-justice Baldwin was a great benefactor to this town; for he not only built the town-hall, and made a causey for three miles towards London, but brought the assizes and sessions hither, much to the advantage of the inhabitants. The corporation, by virtue of its charter from queen Mary, in January 1553-4, consists of a bailiff, ten aldermen, and twelve capital burgesses. The same queen also granted it a market and two fairs, with a pye-powder-court
<PB N="77" REF="780"/>
and stallage, a gaol, jurisdiction from Glaswer's bridge to Stane-bridge, and from Holman's-bridge to the Wall-bridge, trial of malefactors, assize of bread and beer, the privilege of sending members to parliament, and made it a county within itself. It is a fair market-town, and pretty populous. It gave title of earl to the noble family of Bruce, who were also earls of Elgin, in Scotland. The chief officer is now the constable, chosen by the inhabitants, and confirmed by the lord of the manor.</P>
<P>Amersham, or Agmondesham, is a small an∣tient town, but no corporation. Its chief ma∣gistrates are burgesses, and it has a handsome town∣hall and free-school.</P>
<P>Wendover, tho' a corporation, is a poor place. It stands at the entrance of the vale of Aylesbury, with pleasant hills on each side.</P>
<P>Great-Marlow derives its name from the marle of which the soil hereabouts is composed, and is a pretty considerable town, seated upon the Thames. It is a borough, but no corporation, and its chief manufacture is bone-lace. There are a great many mills in its neighbourhood, some for corn and paper, some for brass works, such as kettles, pans, and thimbles, and others for rape and linseed-oil. Besides these advantages, it is the port whence great quantities of malt, flour, and beech, brought from the neighbouring towns, are conveyed in barges to London. It has a handsome church, town-house, a bridge over the Thames, and a charity-school.</P>
<P>Eaton is seated on the Thames, over which it has a bridge to Windsor, and is famous for its college and school founded by Henry VI. The college consists of a provost, seven fellows, and seventy scholars. For teaching these, and many others that are sent hither for their education, there
<PB N="78" REF="790"/>
are two masters, and four ushers to each master. For the scholars upon the foundation, when fit for the university, there are scholarships and fellow∣ships provided in King's-college, Cambridge, which was founded by the same king. The elec∣tion of youths for the university is on the first Tuesday in August, and thither they are removed as fast as vacancies happen, according to the order of their election. The revenue of the college is said to be about five thousand pounds a-year.</P>
<P>Colnbrook. As the brook Coln, on which the town stands, is divided into four channels, over each of these is a bridge, and as the distances also agree, it is supposed to be the Pontes of Antoni∣nus. It is now a small town, but has some good inns.</P>
<P>Beaconsfield has also good inns on the Oxford∣road; but its greatest glory is the giving birth to the famous poet Edmund Waller, who had a great estate and fine seat here.</P>
<P>Stony Stratford had the epithet of Stony from the quarries of free-stone in its neighbourhood, of which the town is built, and that of Stratford, from the ford in the river Ouse, on which it stands, and the highway called Watling-street, on which it is also situated. It is a large town, and has a stone-bridge over the Ouse, and two churches, which no other town in the county can boast of. Here was formerly a cross, with the arms of Eng∣land, Castile, Leon, and the county of Ponthieu, erected to Eleanor of Spain, queen to Edward I. as were others in every town where the corpse rested. It is supposed to be the antient Lactoro∣dum, and has now a manufacture of lace.</P>
<P>Newport Pagnel, so called from its antient lords of the surname of Pagnel, is the most noted town in England for bone-lace, and in consequence a large populous place, but neither borough nor cor∣poration.

It is of an oval form, about twenty-two miles long, fifteen broad, and seventy-three in compass; with∣in which it contains two hundred and sixty thou∣sand acres, nine hundreds, ten market towns, and one hundred and twenty-four parishes.

<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is pleasant and healthy, and the soil fruitful, especially towards the north, where it is a deep clay. Towards the middle, the face of the country is somewhat hilly and woody, and the soil sandy. Towards the south, tho' the soil
<PB N="81" REF="820"/>
is not very rich, yet it produces abundance of excellent barley. A great part of the country is watered by the windings of the Ouse, which divides it into two parts; and being navigable, affords an easy conveyance for commodities to of from it. It yields also a great deal of fuller's earth, plenty of wood, except on the east side, woad for dying, butter and cheese. Its principal manufactures are bone-lace and straw-hats. It sends four mem∣bers to parliament, namely, two for Bedford, and two knights for the shire.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Bedford, the county town, stands on each side of the Ouse, over which it has a stone bridge. It is an antient town, and pleasantly situated, but not very large nor well built; tho' the buildings are much improved of late, and the river made navigable. It has two weekly markets, the one on Tuesday for live cattle, and the other on Sa∣turday for corn; of which the former is held on the south side of the river, and the other on the north. At this place the Britons were overthrown in a great battle, in 572, by Cuthwulf, the Saxon king; and here was a strong castle, built in the time of the Normans by Pagan de Beauchamp, the third baron of Bedford. It was reduced by king Stephen after a long siege, and afterwards by king John, after a siege of sixty days, from Fulco de Brent, who rebelled against his sovereign, notwithstanding he had taken this castle before from the barons, and had it bestowed upon him by the king. The town is a very antient corporation, and has long sent members to parliament. It is governed at present by a mayor, recorder, two bailiffs, twelve aldermen, two chamberlains, a town-clerk, and three serjeants. The neighbouring country is
<PB N="82" REF="830"/>
very fruitful in wheat, great quantities of which are carried from hence to Hitchen and Hertford markets. sold, ground, and conveyed to London. The town has five churches, a free-school, and se∣veral hospitals, and enjoys a good trade in corn by the way of Lynn. When the river is swelled by rains, especially in winter, it is usual in Cam∣bridgeshire to say, the bailiff of Bedford is coming, meaning, that it is going to lay their fens under water. At this town the noted John Bunyan, au∣thor of the Pilgrim's Progress, was educated, if not born. He was a brazier, or tinker, but af∣terwards turned preacher.</P>
<P>Ampthill is seated almost in the middle of the county, upon a hill, as its name denotes, and is a handsome market-town. Here, in a palace be∣longing to the crown, queen Catharine, consort to Henry VIII. resided during the progress of the divorce, and from hence was cited to appear before the commissioners at Dunstable. It has a charity-school, and an hospital for ten poor men.</P>
<P>Biggleswade, or Bigglesworth, is a great tho∣rough-fare on the north-road, and is pleasantly situated on the river Ivel, which is navigable by boats.</P>
<P>Wooburn is a handsome town, and has a neat market-place, a free-school, and an hospital built and endowed by the earls and dukes of Bedford. Here was antiently a famous monastery, where now stands the fine palace of the duke of Bed∣ford. In the neighbourhood is plenty of fuller's∣earth, one sort of which at Aspley Gowez is said to turn wood into stone.</P>
<P>Dunstable stands in that part of the county called the Chiltern, in a chalky ground, and is populous and full of inns. This is supposed to be the Magioninium, Magiovinium, and Magin∣tum

of Antoninus, from the coins found here, called madning-money, the Roman way on which it stands, and the round military fortification at a little distance, called Madning-bower, or Mad∣man-bower, all which appear to be a corruption of Magintum. It seems plainly to derive its name from its situation, the word dun in Saxon signify∣ing a hill or eminence. A council was held in 1214, by Langton, archbishop of Canterbury; and here several Lollards suffered martyrdom under Henry V. and VII. It was in this place also that archbishop Cranmer pronounced the sentence of divorce against queen Catharine. The larks about the town are said to be the largest and best in England. As they can come at no water without digging twenty-four fathom deep, each quarter of the town has a public pond, which, tho' supplied only with rain-water, are said never to be dry.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which derives its name from Hart∣ford, the capital, and that from the harts, with which it antiently abounded, being then over-run with woods, is bounded on the east by Essex, on the west by Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, on the south by Middlesex, and on the north by Cambridgeshire. This county is much indented by those that surround it; the longest part is about thirty miles, the broadest about twenty-four, and one hundred and thirty in compass, in which are contained about four hundred and fifty-one thousand acres, eighteen market towns, one hun∣dred and twenty parishes, and above ninety-five thousand inhabitants, who send six members to parliament, viz. two for the shire, two for Hart∣ford, and two for St. Alban's. Before the reign of queen Elizabeth, one sheriff served both for this shire and Essex; but in the ninth year of her reign, it had one allotted for itself. With regard to ecclesiastical jurisdiction, it belongs partly to the diocese of Lincoln, and partly to that of London.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>Tho' the soil in general, but especially in the Chiltern and southern parts, is but very indif∣ferent, and much inferior to that of the neigh∣bouring counties, yet the air is so much supe∣rior, that lands in this shire generally sell at three or four years purchase more than in many others on that account. But it must be owned, that the soil of Hartfordshire has been much improved of late, by draining, sowing grass-seeds, and other methods. There are few or no manufactures in the county; but its markets are much frequented, in conse∣quence of its being near London, for malt and all sorts of grain, which, with the many thorough∣fares through it, make ample amends.</P>

<P>Hartford, signifying, as is commonly thought, the ford of Harts, stands on the river Lea. In Wil∣liam the Conqueror's time, as we find in Dooms∣day-book, there were twenty-six burgesses in it. It has a castle upon the Lea, supposed to have been built by Edward the Elder, which Edward III. granted to his son John, duke of Lancaster, to∣gether with the town and honour of Hartford, that (as it is expressed in the grant) he might keep a house suitable to his quality, and have a decent habitation. Here the East Saxon kings often kept their court; and where, in 673, was held a sy∣nod. King Edward the Elder built a village for his tenants, and fortified it with a wall of turf for their defence, which is what was originally meant by a burgh, whence the houses were called burgages, and the inhabitants burghers or burgesses. The ma∣nor of this town was an honour and a royal manor,
<PB N="87" REF="880"/>
and even the town and castle were held of the king in capite; of the latter of which the sheriffs of Hartfordshire and Essex were usually governors. The manor was granted by queen Elizabeth to lord Burleigh, whose descendants still possess it. The town sent members to parliament in Edward the Ist's time, but after the seventh of Henry V. the bailiff and burgesses petitioned the parliament to be excused, on account of their poverty. It has had several charters and grants of privileges from different kings, particularly several fairs and markets. In Henry VII's reign, the standards of weights and measures were ordered to be kept here. Here was antiently a monastery, founded by a ne∣phew of William the Conqueror's, and five churches, which are now reduced to two. As the town is re∣markable for its pleasant dry situation and whole∣some air, the governors of Christ's hospital have fitted up a large building for the reception of their sickly or supernumarary children. It is governed at present by a mayor, high-steward, recorder, nine aldermen, a town-clerk, chamberlain, ten capital burgesses, and sixteen assistants; and it has two serjeants at mace. Its markets are very considerable for wool, wheat, and malt, of which, especially the last, great quantities are conveyed to London by the river Lea. The town has had a great many benefactors; but to particularize them and their benefactions, would require more room than we can allow. It gives the title of earl to the noble family of Seymour-Conway.</P>
<P>St. Alban's rose out of the ruins of the antient city of Verolamium, upon Offa, king of the Mer∣cians, founding a monastery near it, about the year 795, in a place called Holmehurst, to the memory of St. Alban, who was the first British martyr in the reign of Dioclesian. Together with the monastery, a town grew up, which from
<PB N="88" REF="890"/>
the saint took the name of St. Alban's. From the veneration paid to this saint, and the great possessions and immunities bestowed by kings and popes in con∣sequence thereof upon the monastery, it became one of the wealthiest and most eminent in Britain, if not in the world. Pope Adrian, who was born near it, gave the abbot the precedence of all the other abbots in England, using these words: "As St. Alban is well known to have been the proto mar∣tyr of the English nation, so the abbot of his mo∣nastery should in all times be reputed the first in dignity of all the abbots of England." Here two battles were fought between the houses of York and Lancaster; in the first, Richard, duke of York, defeated the Lancastrian party with great slaughter, and took king Henry VI. prisoner; but four years after, the Lancastrians, under the conduct of queen Margaret, routed the Yorkists, and recovered the king. The church, a large, beautiful, antient pile, was purchased at the disso∣lution of monasteries, by the inhabitants for four hundred pounds, and converted into a parish church. How amazingly durable the Roman bricks are, appears from this church, which, tho' built in 793, from the walls of Old Verulam, is still standing. In it are a great number of inscrip∣tions and monuments of kings, &amp;c. particularly those of Offa, the Saxon king, St. Alban, and Humphrey, duke of Glocester. There are three other parish churches, in one of which, St. Mi∣chael's, is an alabaster monument of the illus∣trious Bacon, lord viscount Verulam. The town has had several charters, by the last of which it is governed by a mayor, high-steward, recorder, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four assistants. One of its weekly markets is among the greatest in England for wheat. To the liberty of this town belongs both a civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction
<PB N="89" REF="900"/>
over a great many neighbouring parishes, with a gaol and gaol-delivery held at St. Alban's four times a year. Not far from the town are the re∣mains called vulgarly Oester-hills, as is supposed from Ostorius the propraetor. It now gives title of duke to the family of Beauclerk, the first of whom was a natural son of king Charles II.</P>
<P>At Royston was formerly a cross built by a lady of the name of Roysia, and thence called Roysia's cross; but a monastery having been after∣wards built in the same place, and in consequence of that a town, it took the name of Royston. Richard I. granted it a fair and market, which was once one of the greatest in the kingdom for corn and malt. It is a neat town, standing at the extremity of the county, on the confines of Cambridgeshire. The church, which antiently belonged to the pri∣ory, and has many fine monuments in it, was purchased by the inhabitants at the dissolution, and converted, by act of parliament, into a parish church. The rectory, of which the dean and chapter of St. Paul's are patrons, is very valua∣ble, consisting of five parishes reduced into one. Here, we are told by Norden, that the best wheat was sold for a shilling a quarter in Henry VI's time. The Roman way, called Ermine-street, passes thro' this hundred; and that called Icken∣ing-street a little to the east of the town, along which, and in the fields about the town, are a great many barrows. On this account, and the many Roman coins often found about it, it is, with great probability, supposed to have been a Roman station.</P>
<P>Baldock is a pretty large town, inhabited mostly by maltsters, and its market for corn and malt is very considerable. It formerly belonged to the Knights Templars, but at the dissolution fell to the crown. One Mr. John Wynne gave eleven
<PB N="90" REF="910"/>
thousand pounds to build six alms-houses, and purchase lands to raise an annuity of forty shillings for each poor person settled in them.</P>
<P>Hitchin, or Hitching, a corruption of Hitchend, from its standing at the end of Hitch-wood, is esteemed the second town of the county, for its extent and number of inhabitants. It is governed by a bailiff and four constables. The market is very considerable for malt and corn, and the more so, as no toll is paid for grain of any kind. The town and manor belonged formerly to the Baliol family; but when John Baliol became king of Scotland, they reverted to the crown, in which, or in some of the royal family, they have ever since continued. It has a handsome church, free-school, and several alms-houses well endowed. About the town is found marle of several sorts.</P>
<P>Buntingford is a small town, situated upon Er∣mine-street. Henry VIII. gave the manor of Cor∣neybury, in which the town stands, to Sir Tho∣mas Audley, lord-high-chancellor, with the pri∣vilege of a market, and two fairs, upon condition that he and his heirs should appoint two men of the town to collect the tolls, &amp;c. of them, and pay them to the king, to be expended for the pub∣lick good of the place. Dr. Seth Ward, bishop of Sarum, who was educated here, founded and endowed an alms-house for four ancient men and as many women.</P>
<P>Barkway is a populous flourishing town, and a great throughfare in the north road.</P>
<P>Bishops-Hatfield. Hatfield is a corruption of Heathfield, to which Bishops was added, because it belonged, after the reformation, to the bishops, as it had before, to the monks of Ely. Here was long a royal palace, which, together with the town, purchased of the bishop of Ely, by queen Eliza∣beth, was exchanged by king James I. for Theo∣balds,
<PB N="91" REF="920"/>
belonging to the ancestors of the earl of Salisbury.</P>
<P>Totteridge, so called from its situation on the ridge of a hill, is a very pleasant village, well known to the citizens of London on account of its fine air.</P>
<P>Stevenage, in the hundred of Broadwater, has a market and several fairs. The manor belongs to the bishop of London. The town possesses a free∣school and hospital, besides other charities.</P>
<P>Bishops-Stortford is a considerable place, with four streets pointing to the four quarters, good inns, and a market. It takes the name of Stortford from its situation on the Stort, and the epithet of Bishops from its having belonged to the bishops of Lon∣don ever since the conquest. There was antiently a castle belonging also to the bishop, for the guard of which he had certain rents assigned him out of several manors, and in which was a prison, called the convicts prison, because the bishops used to put such as were convicted of heresy into it. King John incorporated the town, and also authorized it to send members to parliament; but it hath since lost these privileges. Here is a stately church, with painted glass, and very antient, a free-school and library well endowed, and several alms-houses.</P>
<P>Hodsdon is but a small town, tho' it is a great thoroughfare, and has a good market, especially for all sorts of corn. It has also a free-school, to which queen Elizabeth granted certain privileges.</P>
<P>Hunsdon. Here was a palace built by Henry VIII. in which he often resided, and where he kept his children, on account of its fine air; for it stands on a rising ground, and gravelly soil. The same king annexed the manors of Roydon and Stansted to this, and made them an honour; which Edward VI. granted to the princess Mary his sister, and queen Elizabeth gave to Henry
<PB N="92" REF="930"/>
Carey, her cousin, with the title of baron Huns∣don: but the manor is now the property of another family.</P>
<P>Sawbridgeworth is a small market-town upon the Stort. Its name is said to be compounded of Say, because the manor once belonged to lord Say, Briest a bridge, and Worth a mansion. It has a handsome church, in which are many monu∣ments, particularly one of general Lumly; who, as his epitaph informs us, was in twenty campaigns in Ireland, Flanders, and Germany, under king William and the duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>Berkhamsted, a corruption of Berghamsted, that is, a village or town upon a hill, is an antient town. In 697 was held at this place a synod of the clergy; and, in the time of William the Conqueror, the nobles had a meeting about throwing off the Nor∣man yoke, to which William came in person, and swore upon the reliques of the church of St. Alban's, and the holy Evangelists, that he would inviolably observe all the good, approved, and antient laws of the kingdom; but to this oath he shewed little regard afterwards. Henry II. kept his court here, and granted the town a great many privileges and immunities. Robert, earl of Morton, half-brother to the Conqueror, is said to have built a castle in it. The town and honour have been constantly in the crown since the year 1308; and his royal highness the duke of Cum∣berland derives his title of marquis from hence. In the manor and honour are comprized no fewer than fifty-three townships, partly in this county, partly in Bucks, and partly in Northamptonshire. The town is pretty large, and a corporation, though a poor one. It has a stately church, an alms-house, and free-school, well endowed, of which the king is patron, and the warden of All-souls college, Oxford, visitor.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="940"/>
Ware, so called, as is supposed, from a sort of dam antiently made there to stop the current, commonly called a wear, is a flourishing place, being a great thoroughfare, and standing on the river Lea, which is navigable from hence. This town never began to make any figure till the time of king John, when, under the protection of its lord Sayer de Quincy, earl of Winchester, it turn∣ed the high road hither: for before that time it was only a small village, and no waggons could pass the bridge by reason of a chain across it, the key whereof was kept by the bailiff of Hartford. From hence the New-river water is conveyed for sixty miles, taking in the windings to London, and greatly contributes to its cleanliness, health, and convenience. The town has a weekly market, and pye-powder court, view of frank pledges, waife and stray, free-warren, and the neighbouring park. Its market is a very great one for corn, of which and malt prodigious quantities are conveyed in barges to London by the river Lea. Here is a famous bed, much visited by travellers, and is so large, that twenty couple may lie at ease in it. Besides a church, there are several alms-houses, and a charity school.</P>
<P>Hempsted is a small market town, seated among hills, by the side of a little river. At the request of John Waterhouse, esquire, auditor to Henry VIII. to whom a part of it was granted at the dis∣solution, it was incorporated by the name of a bailiff and inhabitants, with perpetual succession, and a common-seal. It is one of the greatest mar∣kets in England for wheat, a considerable quantity of which is ground here, and conveyed to London, and has besides a manufacture of straw-hats, which employs and supports a great number of hands.</P>
<P>Tring, or Troung, is a pretty little town, and a good market, especially for corn. The manor,
<PB N="94" REF="950"/>
after passing through a great many hands, came at last to Henry Guy, esquire, who, from a very small fortune, rose to be secretary of the treasury, a member of the house of commons, a com∣missioner of the customs, and a groom of the bedchamber to king Charles II. king James II. king William and queen Mary, and built a fine house, which now belongs to William Gore, esquire. In this county is a hundred called Caisho, which is supposed to be derived from the antient Cassii mentioned by Caesar, and seated, as it is conjectured, hereabouts.</P>
<P>Barnet, called by the Saxons Bergnet, from its situation on a hill, and Cheaping-Barnet from its market. It is a great thoroughfare and market for corn and cattle, especially hogs. Near this place a bloody battle was fought in 1468, betwixt the houses of Lancaster and York. The village called Kicksend, about a mile and a half to the north of the town, is supposed to have been the field of battle, in commemoration of which there is a stone pillar, with an inscription, erected at the farther end of Barnet. Here is a free-school founded by queen Elizabeth, and an alms-house by James Ravenscroft, esquire, for six poor widows.</P>
<P>East-Barnet is a pleasant village, in the neigh∣bourhood of Enfield-Chace, formerly much fre∣quented for its medicinal spring.</P>
<P>Watford, six miles from St. Alban's, is a con∣traction of Watlingford, as Mr. Norden hath shewn to a demonstration; for Watling-street passed in a direct line from London over Hamstead-heath to this place and Verulam. It has a handsome free-school, and several alms-houses.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The principal place for antiquities in this county is the antient Verulamium near St. Alban's, which was formerly a very famous city. In Nero's time it was esteemed a municipium, that is, a town whose inhabitants enjoyed the rights and privi∣leges of Roman citizens. When the Britons re∣volted from the Romans under Boadicea, they destroyed it entirely; but afterwards it flourished again, and arose to a great degree of eminence. Roman antiquities of all sorts have been found here, and many are still found to this day.</P>
<P>At Ashwell, not far from Royston, is a large square fortification, in which Roman coins have been frequently found.</P>
<P>At Offley king Offa frequently resided, and at last died; and at Hexton, or Hockston, not far off, is an oval camp of great strength, and an∣tient works, near which, on the top of another hill, is a tumulus; and a piece of ground there∣abouts is still called Dane-furlong. About half a mile to the south is an oblong camp, still very strong both by nature and art, called Ravensbo∣rough-castle.</P>
<P>At King's-Langley, near Abbots-Langley, was antiently a royal palace, where Edmund of Lang∣ley, son to Edward III. was born. In a small cell of friars praedicant here, that unhappy prince Ri∣chard II. was first buried, but afterwards removed to Westminster, where he had a monument of brass bestowed upon him.</P>
<P>At Abbots-Langley, so called, because it belong∣ed antiently to the abbots of St. Alban's, was born Nicholas Breakspeare, afterwards pope Ha∣drian IV. He first preached the gospel to the
<PB N="96" REF="970"/>
Norwegians, had his stirrup held by the emperor Frederic I. and was at last choaked by a fly, which flew into his mouth.</P>
<P>At a place called Brockley-hill, or Shenley, twelve miles from London, and nine from Veru∣lam, the Sulloniacae of Antoninus are supposed to have had their station, as that place stands upon the highway called Watling-street, at the distances mentioned in the Itinerary, and as coins, urns, &amp;c. have been found about it.</P>
<P>At Westmill, or Wadesmill, near Ware, some Roman antiquities have been found; and in Round-wood and Camp's-wood, hard by, are some vestiges of entrenchments. The Caesaro∣magus of Antoninus is supposed, by some, to have been at Braughing, as being exactly sixteen miles from Durolitum (Cheshunt) and twelve from Cano∣nium, now Littlebury-hill, in Essex.</P>
<P>At Westleton-green, in the parish of Little-Hadham, are the remains of a fortification; and to the west of Cheshunt are the remains of another; the vallum and fosse of which are yet visible for an hundred yards.</P>
<P>At Spadwell nunnery, near St. Alban's, king Henry VIII. is said to have been married to Ann Bolen; and at Gorhambury, not far from thence, is his statue. At Kingsbury, a little to the north∣west of St. Alban's, was once a palace of the Saxon kings.</P>
<P>At Siffeverns, in Coldecote parish, there was in 1627 a walnut-tree, which covered seventy-six poles of ground. The weight of its boughs cleft the trunk at last to the bottom.</P>
<P>On the Ikening-street, near Baldock, are the remains of a British town, called now Westbury-hill.</P>

It extends from east to west forty miles in length, thirty-five in breadth from north to south, and one hundred and forty in circumference, in which space it contains one mil∣lion two hundred and forty thousand acres, twenty hundreds, twenty-two market towns, four hun∣dred and fifteen parishes, and two hundred and eight thousand and eight hundred souls. It sends eight members to parliament, viz. two for the shire, and two each for Malden, Colchester, and Harwich.

The county, in some places, produces a great deal of saffron, as about Saffron Walden. It is well supplied both with sea and river fish, wood, and wild fowl. Vast numbers of horses, oxen, sheep, and cows are fed and bred in the fens, a great deal of corn raised, and cheese made; the soil being there as rich as the air is bad.

<P>Colchester, thought by some to be the place mentioned by Antoninus under the name of Co∣lonia, different from Colonia Camaloduni, and by the Saxons called Caer Colin, is a beautiful, po∣pulous, pleasant town, the capital of the county, extended on the brow of a hill from east to west, and adorned with ten churches. It had formerly strong walls and a castle, but now there are hard∣ly any remains of either. From the coins and Roman bricks found here, it appears very plainly to have been a Roman station. This place is said to have given birth to Fl. Julia Helena, mother to Constantine the Great, and daughter to king Coelus, so much celebrated for her piety and zeal in propagating the Christian religion. Here, and in the neighbouring towns, is a great manu∣facture of bays and says, which employs a vast number of hands in carding, spinning, and wea∣ving, and yields very valuable returns. This town is also famous for oysters, in pickling and barrel∣ling of which the inhabitants excel. The render∣ing navagable the river Colne, on which it stands, has greatly contributed to the promoting its trade and manufactures. It is a liberty of itself, and by virtue of its last charter from king William, is governed by a mayor, high-steward, recorder, or his deputy, eleven aldermen, a chamberlain, town-clerk, eighteen assistants, and eighteen com∣mon-council men. There was formerly an abbey here, whose abbot was mitred, and sat in parliament. In the time of the civil wars it was besieged by the parliament's troops, and reduced by famine.

<P>Malden, or Maldon, is an antient city, and was the chief seat of Cunobeline, the British king, but was reduced by the emperor Claudius, and made a Roman colony, called Colonia Camalodu∣num; but when the Britons revolted under Boa∣dicia, it was plundered and burnt: however, the Romans raised it out of its ashes again, for it is mentioned by Antoninus long after. It was ruined again in the Danish wars, but repaired and fortifi∣ed with a castle by Edward, son to king Alfred. In William the Conqueror's time, we find by Doomsday-book, that it had one hundred and eighty houses, held by burghers, and eighteen mansions laid waste. It is now a considerable town, consisting chiefly of one street, and has a pretty convenient harbour. It is also a liberty of itself, and a corporation, governed by two bailiffs, six alder∣men, eighteen headboroughs, a steward, recorder, and four hundred burgesses, who vote for its mem∣bers of parliament. Here is a grammar-school, a work-house, a large library for the use of the clergy of the town and neighbourhood; and a considera∣ble trade is carried on in coals, iron, corn, and deals. In a neighbouring bay are bred those delicate oysters, called Walfleet oysters, from a wall of earth raised to keep out the sea. The custom called Bo∣rough English takes place here, by which the youngest son succeeds his father in his lands and tenements if he dies intestate.</P>
<P>Harwich is not a large, but a neat well built town, and is walled and paved with a sort of pe∣trified clay, that falls from the cliffs in the neigh∣bourhood. The harbour, or bay, is very large,

safe, and deep, and is commanded by a strong fort on the Suffolk side, tho' not in that county. Here is a dock belonging to the government, with all conveniences for building, cleaning, and re∣fitting men of war. A little way from the town, on a high hill, called Beacon-hill, is a very fine light house, which is seen at a great distance, and is very useful on this dangerous coast. At this place the packet-boats, that pass between England, Holland, and Germany, are stationed, and the town is much benefited by the passengers. The government, by a charter from king James I, is vested in a mayor, eight aldermen, twenty-four capital burgesses, the electors, and recorder. The town has also an admiralty jurisdiction within its liberties, and the return of all writs, fines, &amp;c. At Walton, about five miles to the south of Har∣wich, there are works for making copperas; and at Warbness, in its neighbourhood, in 1701, bones of an extraordinary size were found, sup∣posed to be the bones of some of those elephants that were brought into Britain by the emperor Claudius. In Thorp, Kirby, and Walton, to the south of Harwich, no man can be arrested but by the bailiff, with the consent of the lord, they be∣ing within that which was antiently called the li∣berty of this Soke.</P>

place where the assizes, sessions, and meetings for elections of members for the county are held, and all public business is transacted. It is, besides, a great thoroughfare on the London road, and has a free-school founded and well endowed by Ed∣ward VI.</P>
<P>Saffron-Walden has the epithet of Saffron, from the great quantities of saffron raised in its neigh∣bourhood. This choice plant was first brought to England in the time of Edward III. in which it has been much cultivated ever since, but no where with more success than about this town. The roots being taken up about July, and replanted, in about three weeks there appears a bluish flower, within which are three yellow chives, which are picked out and dried by a gentle fire. The pro∣duce of an acre, when dried, is about twenty pounds. It is a handsome town, and by virtue of a charter from Edward VI. is governed by a mayor and twenty-four aldermen, out of whom is yearly chosen a treasurer, who is the chief officer for that year, and two chanberlains his assistants.</P>
<P>Dunmow magna &amp; parva is a very antient town, for here Cesaromagus is, by some, supposed to have stood. It is situated on a hill, as its name implies, and is governed by twelve headboroughs, out of whom a bailiff is chosen every year. Here was antiently a priory, to which if any man went and swore within a year and day of his marriage, that he had not quarrelled with his wife, nor re∣pented of his marriage, he might claim a gam∣mon or flitch of bacon; which several have actually claimed and received. At Audley-Inn or End, a little to the south of the town, was once a noble palace, intended at first for a royal one, and for some time actually pertaining to the crown; but a great part of it hath been pulled down by the family of Suffolk, to whom it now belongs.</P>

Coggeshall, or Coxall, was formerly noted for a woollen manufacture, called Coggeshall-Whites, by which many of the inhabitants got great estates, but it is now much decayed. In a grotto several Roman antiquities have been found, particularly an urn, inscribed Coccilli M. i. e. Manibus to Coccillus's ghost; and from him, perhaps, the town had its name.</P>
<P>Bocking. The deanry of this town, as it is called, is worth six or seven hundred pounds a∣year, and in the gift of the archbishop of Canter∣bury. There is a species of bays peculiar to this place, called Bockings, which render it a very flourishing place.</P>
<P>Braintree. Here also is a great manufacture of bays and says, which, however, has declined of late.</P>
<P>Manningtree, or Maintree, is a small town upon the Stour, over which is a bridge, and by which it carries on a good trade.</P>
<P>Felstead, near Braintree, has a free-grammar school, well endowed, in queen Elizabeth's time, by a lord Rich, for teaching eighty children of Essex, gratis, and an alms-house for six poor peo∣ple, also well endowed.</P>
<P>Ingerstone, or Ingatstone, is a great thorough∣fare and market for live cattle. Here is the seat of the lords Petre, of which family Sir William, in the reign of Henry VIII. founded eight fel∣lowships in Exeter college, Oxford, and an alms-house in this town for twenty poor people.</P>
<P>Burntwood, in the hundred of Chafford, stands on a hill, on the high-road. It is full of inns, and well inhabited.</P>
<P>Rumford is a great thoroughfare; and the bai∣liff and wardens, tho' no corporation, are impow∣ered by patent to try causes civil and criminal, and for that end a court is held every week.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Hornchurch. Here was formerly a monastery, called the Horned Monastery, from a pair of huge leaden horns fastened to it.</P>
<P>Barking. In this town was antiently a monastery of Benedictines, the oldest and richest in England; and here William the Conqueror resided for some time after his coronation. It is chiefly inhabited by fishermen, who send their fish in boats to Bil∣lingsgate.</P>
<P>There are two parishes in this county of the name of Tilbury, opposite to Gravesend, distinguished by the epithets of east and west. In the former are some spacious caverns in a chalky cliff, which are supposed to have been dug by the antient Britons, either for chalk to manure the ground, or for granaries to secure their corn against their ene∣mies and the weather. In the latter is Tilbury-fort, which commands the river, and has a constant gar∣rison. It is encompassed by a double ditch, of which the innermost is one hundred and eighty feet wide, and towards the river, besides the guns on the curtain and bastions, there is a platform mounting above one hundred guns. Towards the land are two redoubts, and in case of the approach of an enemy, they can lay the level under water.</P>
<P>Witham, supposed to have been the old Ansam in Antoninus's Itinerary, is a neat town, and a great thoroughfare.</P>
<P>Waltham. Here in antient times was a famous monastery built by Harold, the son of earl God∣win, in honour of the holy cross, in which he made his solemn vows for success against the Nor∣mans, and in which, after his death, he was in∣terred. In the gardens of the abbey is a fine tulip tree, much visited by the curious.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of this town, is a royal
<PB N="105" REF="1060"/>
forest of great extent, now called Epping-forest, from the town of that name, but formerly Essex and Waltham-forest.</P>
<P>At Assington, near Bellerica, was fought a des∣perate battle between Edmund Ironside and the Danes, in which the former was defeated.</P>
<P>At Bartlow, on the confines of Cambridgeshire, are four great barrows.</P>
<P>At Chesterford, near Walden, the ruins of a Roman town have been discovered.</P>
<P>At Rochford, which gives title of earl to Wil∣liam Henry Zulestein de Nassau, the lord of the honour of Raleigh, is held a court at cock-crow∣ing, called lawless-court, on the Wednesday after Michaelmas. The steward and suitors whisper each other; they are not allowed either fire or candle; a piece of coal serves instead of pen and ink; and whoever owes service to the court, and does not attend, forfeits double his rent for every hour. Cambden tells us, this penance was im∣posed on the tenants for having met at such an hour, to conspire against their lord.</P>
<P>At Sterbury-Hill, a mile west from Walden, many Roman antiquities have been found. In Hartlow hundred, near Hallingbury, is an old military vallum called Walberg.</P>
<P>In the Thames, and sea along the Essex coast, are several islands, as Mersey, between Maldon and Colchester waters; Osey, or Osyth, below Maldon, which at certain seasons is covered with wild∣fowl; Canvey-isle, in the Thames, by which it is sometimes overflowed, called by Ptolemy Connos, and by other more ancient writers Convennos. Over-against it is a place called the Hope. In the mouth of the river, and along the Essex coast, are very dangerous flats and sands, often fatal to mariners. Besides those we have mentioned, there are several other good towns in this county, such as

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county has its name from Somerton, for∣merly its chief town, and is bounded on the west by Devonshire, on the south by Dorsetshire, on the north by Bristol channel, or the Severn sea, on the north-east by a small part of Gloucestershire, and on the east by Wiltshire. It is one of the largest counties in England, extending in length from east to west about sixty miles; in breadth, where broadest, from south to north, about fifty; and one hundred and fifty in circumference. It is divided into forty-two hundreds, in which are three cities, thirty market towns, one thousand seven hundred villages, three hundred and eighty∣five parishes, of which one hundred and thirty∣two are vicarages, containing more than a million of acres, and about two hundred and eighty thousand souls. It sends eighteen members to parliament, viz. two for the county, two for Bristol, two for Bath, two for Wells, two for Taunton, two for Bridgewater, two for Ilchester, two for Milbourn∣port, and two for Minehead.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county is very mild and whole∣some, especially that of the hilly part. The soil in general is exceeding rich, so that single acres very commonly produce forty or fifty bushels of wheat, and there have been instances of some pro∣ducing sixty of barley. As there is very fine pa∣sture both for sheep and black cattle, it abounds in both, which are as large as, and their flesh of a finer grain, than those of Lincolnshire. In con∣sequence of this abundance of black cattle, great quantities of cheese are made in it, of which that of Cheddar is thought equal to Parmesan. In the hilly parts are found coal, lead, copper, lapis calaminaris, and okre. Wood thrives in it as well as in any county of the kingdom. It a∣bounds also in pease, beans, beer, cyder, fruit, wild fowl, and salmon, and its mineral waters are celebrated all over the world.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>The riches of this county, both natural and ac∣quired, exceed those of any other in the kingdom, Middlesex and Yorkshire excepted. The woolen manufacture in all its branches is carried on to a very great extent; and in some parts of the county great quantities of linen are made. If to these, the produce of various other commodities in which it abounds, is added, the amount of the whole must, undoubtedly, be very great. Its foreign trade must also be allowed to be very ex∣tensive, when it is considered that it has a large trade for sea-coal, and possesses, besides other ports, that of Bristol, a town of the greatest trade in Eng∣land, next to London.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Bristol, the capital, for trade, wealth, and num∣ber of inhabitants, is inferior to none but Lon∣don. Bristol is a corruption of Brightstow, as it was called by the Saxons. It is thought to have stood antiently altogether upon the west, or So∣mersetshire, side of the Avon, before the bridge was built; but after that, it came to be partly in Somersetshire, and partly in Gloucestershire, until it was made a county of itself, though even before that, in the parliament rolls, it was always placed in Somersetshire. At present the east side is by much the largest and most populous. It had antiently a castle, built by-Robert, earl of Glou∣cester, natural son to Henry I. which was demo∣lished by Cromwell; and the ground is now laid out into streets. The corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, of whom the recorder is one, two sheriffs, and twenty-eight common-council men. The recorder is generally a serjeant at law, and sits as judge in capital and all other criminal causes. The mayor, to support his dignity, and defray his extraordinary expence, is entitled to certain fees from ships, which up∣wards of forty years ago amounted to five or six hundred pounds. Besides the cathedral, which was antiently the church of the Augustine monastery, there are eighteen parish churches. Here
<PB N="112" REF="1140"/>
are dissenters of all denominations, of whom the quakers are very respectable, both for their wealth and numbers. When Henry VIII. dissolved the monastery, he applied its revenues to the mainte∣nance of a bishop, dean, six prebendaries, and other officers. Of the parish churches, St. Mary Ratcliff is reckoned one of the finest, not only here, but in the whole kingdom. In this church, besides two monuments of the founder, William Can∣nings, who had been five times mayor of this city, one in the habit of a magistrate, and another in that of a priest (for in his latter days he took or∣ders) there is one of Sir William Pen, father to the famous quaker. The old bridge over the Avon consisted of four broad arches with houses on both sides, like those formerly on London-bridge; but this has been lately pulled down, and another is erecting in its place. No carts or waggons are admitted into Bristol, for fear of damaging the vaults and gutters made under-ground, for carrying the filth of the city into the river. Queen's-square, in this city, is larger than any in London, except Lincolns-inn-fields, and has in the centre an equestrian statue of king William III. All the gates of the city remain intire, and a part of the walls; the rest were razed in the reign of William Rufus. It is almost as broad as long, about seven miles in circumference, and contains about ninety-five thousand inhabitants. Of the hospitals, the chief are, first, that called Queen Elizabeth's, in which one hundred boys are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and naviga∣tion; six of whom, when they go out, have ten pounds, and the rest eight pounds eight shillings, to bind them apprentices: the master is allowed four hundred and fifty pounds a year for the maintenance of the boys. Second, Colston's hospital, in which one hundred boys are maintained for seven years, and taught and apprenticed, as in queen Elizabeth's.
<PB N="113" REF="1150"/>
Third, Another founded by the same gentleman in 1691, for twelve men and twelve women, with an allowance of three shillings per week, and twen∣ty-four sacks of coals in the year. This charity cost the founder twenty-five thousand pounds. Four, Another founded partly by Mr. Colston, and partly by the merchants, in which eighteen men on account of the merchants, and twelve men and women on account of Mr. Colston, are maintained. Five, An infirmary, which was opened in 1736, for the sick, lame, and distressed poor of this city, which is maintained by subscrip∣tion, besides five thousand pounds bequeathed to it by John Eldridge, es{que} formerly comptroller of the customs at this port. There are, besides these, a bridewell, several alms-houses, and charity-schools. There is also a guildhall for the sessions and assizes; the mayor's and sheriffs courts; a council-house, where the mayor and aldermen meet every day, except Sundays, to administer justice; a handsome new exchange, with three entrances, about two∣thirds as large as that in London; and a key half a mile in length, the most commodious in England for shipping and landing goods, for which pur∣pose it is provided with several cranes. In col∣lege-green is a stately high cross, with the effigies of several kings round it. In Winch-street is a guard-house, with barracks for soldiers. As to the trade of this city, it was computed many years ago to be much greater, in proportion, especially to America and the West Indies, than that of London. Fifty sail, some of them ships of consi∣derable burden, have arrived here at one time, or very near one another, from the West Indies. For this trade, and that to Ireland, it is much better situated than London, besides the great advan∣tages it possesses of an inland navigation by the Wye and Severn. Their trade is not confined
<PB N="114" REF="1160"/>
to the West Indies and America, but extends to the Baltic, Norway, Holland, Hamburgh, Guinea, and the Streights. The largest ships are discharged at Hungroad, four miles below the city, and the goods brought to the key by lighters. For build∣ing, equipping, and repairing ships, there are docks, yards, rope-walks, and shipwrights. Here are some considerable woollen manufactures, and no less than fifteen glass-houses, for which Kingswood and Mendip furnish the coals. The city compa∣nies are thirteen: 1st, The merchant adventurers. 2d, The merchant taylors. 3d, The mercers. 4th, The soap-boilers. 5th, The tobacconists. 6th, The butchers. 7th, The barbers. 8th, the tylers 9th, The holliers, who are the sled∣men. 10th, Shoemakers. 11th, Coopers. 12th, Bakers. 13th, Smiths. For supplying the city with water there are six public conduits; and hand∣some hackney coaches may be hired at very rea∣sonable rates, but they do not ply in the streets. There are also stage coaches, which set out every day for Bath, London, and other places. A mile below the city, close by the river, is the hot well, whose waters are specific for the diabetes, and good in pthisical, scorbutic, and inflamma∣tory disorders. Hither is a great resort in the summer of invalids, as well as other company, for whose accommodation and entertainment there is a pump-room, ball-room, coffee-house, with ta∣verns, and a great number of elegant lodging∣houses, both below on a level with the well, and above, in the delightful village of Clifton, which is situated on the brow of a hill, from whence there are downs extending several miles, where the company ride out for exercise. Nothing can be more pure and salutary than the air of these downs, which afford a variety of the most roman∣tic and agreeable prospects, comprehending King∣road,
<PB REF="1170"/>

<PB N="115" REF="1180"/>
with the ships at anchor, the mouth of the Severn, and the mountains of Wales. In the rocks above the well are found those six cornered stones, called Bristol stones; but they are not so plentiful now as in Cambden's days, when, he says, whole bushels might have been easily ga∣thered. In this city is a theatre, where plays are acted almost every night during the recess of the comedians from the metropolis. There are two annual fairs, to which the concourse is so great, that the neighbouring inns have filled one hundred beds a-piece with their guests. In the winter sea∣son there is an assembly every Thursday for the gayer part of the citizens of both sexes. About half way betwixt Bristol and Bath, at a place called Warmly, a company of Bristol merchants have erected a noble manufacture of pins, and other brass utensils, which employs a great number of hands, including above two hundred children of both sexes from seven to twelve or thirteen years of age. All the different operations of melting, splitting, drawing, hammering, turning, &amp;c. are performed by wheels worked with water, which is raised by two fire-engines of a very curious me∣chanism. The contriver and manager of this great work is one Mr. Champion, a quaker of Bristol, who has an elegant house and gardens on the spot. The city of Bristol gives the title of earl to the family of Hervey. It is worth observing, that whoever marries a citizen's daughter becomes free of the city.</P>
<P>Bath. All the different names that this city has borne in different ages and languages, have been taken from its medicinal waters, as the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or hot waters of Ptolomy: the aquae solis, or waters of the sun, of Antoninus: the Caer Baden, and Caer Ennant, i. e. the city of Baths, and the city of Ointment, of the Britons:
<PB N="116" REF="1190"/>
and the Ackmanchester, i. e. the city of Valetudi∣narians, of the Saxons. The baths consist of the King's-bath, the Queen's-bath, the Cross-bath, the Hot-bath, the Leper's-bath, and the duke of Kingston's-bath. This place was of old a resort only for cripples and diseased persons; but now it is more frequented by the sound for pleasure, than the sick for health. The waters are very pleasant to the taste, and impregnated with a vitriolic prin∣ciple, yielding upon evaporation, a little neutral salt, and a calcarious earth and iron. They are very efficacious in strengthening the bowels and stomach, bracing the relaxed fibres, and invigo∣rating the circulation. In bilious complaints they are counted specific, and prove serviceable in most nervous, paralytic, rheumatic, and gouty com∣plaints. At the King's-bath is a handsome pump∣room, where the gentlemen and ladies go in a morning to drink the waters; and there is a band of music that plays all the time. In the Cross bath is a monument of marble, representing the descent of the Holy-Ghost attended by angels, erected by the earl of Melfort (who was secretary of state for Scotland) when king James II. met his queen here. The King's-bath is a large bason of sixty-five feet ten inches, by forty feet ten inches, containing three hundred and forty-six tuns, two hogsheads, and thirty-six gallons of water, when filled to its usual height. In the middle is a wooden building with niches and seats for the accommodation of the bathers. There are also iron rings all round for them to hold by, and guides, both male and fe∣male, to attend them in the bath. The person intending to bathe puts on, at his own lodgings, a bathing dress of brown canvas hired for the pur∣pose, and is carried in a close chair, of a particular make, to one of the slips which open into the bath. There he descends by steps into the water, where
<PB N="117" REF="1200"/>
he is attended by a guide. Having stayed his stated time in the bath, he ascends again into the slip, where he puts off his bathing-dress, and being wrapt up in blankets, is carried home to bed, where he lies for some time to encourage perspi∣ration. The King's-bath is overlooked by the company in the pump-room; and adjoining to it are places furnished with pumps to pour the hot streams on any particular part of the body. The Queen's-bath communicates with the King's, from which it is filled; therefore the water of it is not so hot, being at a greater distance from the source. As the heat is here more moderate, the bathers descend first into the Queen's-bath, and advance gradually to the centre of the other. In the year 1755, the abbey-house, or priory, belong∣ing to the duke of Kingston, was taken down, in order to erect a more commodious pile of building, and in digging for the foundation, the work men discovered about twenty-feet below the surface of the earth, the remains of Roman baths and suda∣tories constructed upon an elegant plan, with floors suspended on pillars, and surrounded with tubu∣lated bricks, for the conveyance of heat and va∣pour. These were supplied by a spring of hot water, of the same properties and temperature with those of the King's-bath; and the sewer was found still entire, that conveyed the waste water into the river. The duke, having cleared the spring and the sewer, has erected several convenient baths and sudatories on the spot, where invalids may be ac∣commodated at all hours, by night as well as by day. The two seasons are the spring and fall; but those who take the waters purely for their health, do not regard the seasons, but drink them all the year round. There are a number of genteel sedan chairs, which carry people to any distance, not exceeding half a mile, for sixpence. The
<PB N="118" REF="1210"/>
company assemble in the afternoon, alternately, at two stately rooms, to converse together, or play at cards. At a very pretty new theatre near the parades, plays are acted every other night; and there are balls twice a week, for which and the rooms, and books at the libraries, the gentry generally subscribe. The city is surrounded with hills on all sides, except a little opening to the east and west, thro' which the Avon runs. This river, which has been made navigable to Bristol by act of parliament, washes the city on the east and south sides, and there is an elegant bridge over it. This city hath formerly had a slight wall, of which some part still remains, as well as one or two of its gates; but almost all the new buildings, and much the greatest and finest part of the city, is without the walls, particularly the fine square called Queen's∣square, in the middle of which is a small garden, with gravel walks, and an obelisk in the centre: but the greatest ornament in Bath is the circus. It is of a circular form, consisting of houses built on an uniform plan, with three openings at equal distances to the south, east, and west, leading into as many streets. The fronts of the houses, which are all three stories high, are adorned with three rows of columns in pairs, of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, the frize embellished with sculpture. The whole has an air of magnificence, which cannot fail to strike the most indifferent spectator. In the centre of the area is a reservoir, or bason, filled by two or three springs rising in the neighbouring hills; whence the streets in this district are supplied with water. On the south∣side of the town, are the north and south parades, two noble walks, paved with hewn stone, raised upon arches, facing each an elegant row of houses on one side, and having a stone balustrade on the other. These, with the two streets that join them,
<PB N="119" REF="1220"/>
were planned and executed by one Mr. Wood, an able architect, who likewise built the square, and projected the circus. The two public rooms stand betwixt the north parade and Orange-grove; which last is a square planted with trees, having in the middle a stone obelisk, inscribed in Latin to the late prince of Orange, who recovered his health in consequence of drinking the Bath waters, and gave his name to this part of the town. Several new streets and rows have of late years been built on the north side of Bath, in the neighbourhood of the square, such as Gay-street, Milsom-street, Edgar-row, Harlequin-row, Bla∣dud's-buildings, King's-mead-street, and Brock∣street. A cemicircular range of buildings is just begun near the Circus, to be called from its form the Crescent. Behind the Circus also is a fine riding-school just finished. In a word, new houses ap∣pear in every corner, and Bath is continually ex∣tending itself through all its different avenues. If this rage for building continues; and people per∣sist in flocking thither from all quarters, Bath will soon become one of the largest and most populous cities in England. Their advantages for building here are very great, having excellent free-stone, limestone, and slate in the neighbourhood. One sort of their lime is as white as snow. The guild∣hall of Bath stands in the market place, and is said to be built on a plan of Inigo Jones, which, how∣ever, exhibits nothing worthy of that great archi∣tect: besides, one end of it has been rebuilt in a different stile. The hall is ornamented with some portraits of the late prince of Wales and other re∣markable personages: but the greatest curiosity of the place is a Minerva's-head in bronze, a real antique, dug up in Stall-street, in the year 1725. Bath boasts a noble infirmary, or general hospital, for the reception of the sick and lame from all
<PB N="120" REF="1230"/>
parts of the three kingdoms. It extends one hun∣dred feet in front, and ninety in depth, being capa∣ble of receiving one hundred and fifty patients. Here was antiently a monastery, of which the pre∣sent cathedral was the church. It is a venerable pile; the principal front of which is adorned with angels ascending and descending. The bishop of the diocese is nominated both from Bath and Wells; yet he and his chapter always reside at Wells. There are three other churches in Bath, and several chapels and meeting-houses. Besides the infirmary, there are several other hos∣pitals, alms-houses, and charity-schools. The corporation consists of a mayor, eight aldermen, of whom two are justices of the peace, and twenty-four common-council men. The city is extremely well provided with stage-coaches, post-coaches, chaises, machines, and waggons. Bath is the general hospital of the nation, and a great num∣ber of invalids find benefit from the waters: but as the city lies in a bottom surrounded by very high hills, the air is constantly surcharged with damps, and indeed this place is more subject to rain than any other part in England. The mar∣kets are remarkably well supplied with provisions of all kinds at reasonable rates, particularly fish and poultry. They also afford excellent mutton fed upon Lansdown, one of the highest hills that over∣look the city. This down, remarkable for its pure air, extends about three miles, and at the ex∣tremity of it, there is a stone monument, with an inscription, erected to the memory of Sir Bevil Granville, who was here killed in a battle which he fought with the parliament's army, in the reign of Charles I. On the downs to the south, about a mile from Bath, is a very fine seat, called Prior∣park, which was built by the late Mr. Allen, a gentleman so eminent both for his virtues and abi∣lities,
<PB N="121" REF="1240"/>
that his memory will be ever dear to this place. St. James's parish gave birth to Mr. Hales, a man greatly celebrated for his learning, tem∣perance, probity, and piety, whose chamber, Dr. Heylin says, was a church, and his chair a pulpit. At Swainswic, in this neighbourhood, was born the famous William Prynne, who represented this city in parliament from the restoration to the death of Charles II. and wrote one hundred and seventy-two folios, quartos, octavos, and duodecimos. A∣bout a mile to the south of the city is a chalybeate mineral water, called Lyncombe-Spaw. The house at the Spaw is used at present for inoculation. A little way from the north-parade, on the other side the river, is a public garden much frequented in summer. The flesh and green markets are now removed from the street, and particular places al∣lotted for them. The foundations also of a new guildhall have been laid, a fine chapel, called the Octogon chapel, has been lately built in Milsom∣street, and a methodist-chapel, in Harlequin-row, called Lady Huntingdon's.</P>
<P>Wells is a neat little city, with broad streets, containing about four thousand inhabitants. It has its name from the wells that spring up in all parts of it. It was erected into a bishop's see, anno 905, and the cathedral was repaired, or ra∣ther rebuilt, upwards of five hundred years ago, by bishop Fitz-Joceline. Its front is much ad∣mired for its imagery and carved stone-work. The bishop's palace is one of the handsomest in the kingdom, and has a fine chapel built by the abovementioned Fitz-Joceline. By an act passed in the thirty-fifth of king Henry VIII. it was ordained, that the dean and chapter of Wells should make one sole chapter for the bishop. Be∣sides the bishop and dean, to this church belong twenty-seven prebendaries, nineteen petty canons,
<PB N="122" REF="1250"/>
a precentor, a treasurer, a chancellor, and three archdeacons, viz. of Bath, Wells, and Taunton. Here are several hospitals founded by their bishops, a charity-school, and four alms-houses. A manu∣facture of bone-lace is carried on at Wells; but the poor are chiefly employed in knitting hose. The town is governed by a mayor, seven masters or aldermen, sixteen gownsmen, or common-coun∣cil men. In the great storm that happened in the night in 1703, bishop Kidder and his lady were killed in their beds at this place, by the fall of a stack of chimnies.</P>
<P>Bridgewater is a corruption of Brugge-walter, or Walter's-borough, it having been given to one Walter a Norman after the conquest. Here was antiently a strong castle, and priory of friars∣minors. It stands on the Bristol-channel at the mouth of the Parret, over which it has a bridge, and which is navigable from hence to Taunton, and abounds with fish, especially salmon. The town is a corporation with great privileges, as freedom from inquests out of the town, power to make bye-laws and free burgesses, to purchase lands, to have a court of record within the bo∣rough, an admiralty court, and pye-powder court, during their fairs and markets, of which it has several very considerable for corn, cattle, hogs, sheep, cheese, &amp;c. King Charles I. extended the jurisdiction and privileges of the corporation to the whole parish of Bridgewater. The stile of the corporation is a mayor, aldermen, and burgesses. The town suffered greatly in the civil wars, and by the duke of Monmouth's ill-concerted enter∣prize; but after the revolution the trade of this town increased considerably, and the key so much enlarged, that ships of two hundred tons may now come up to it. The tide runs strong ten miles above the town, and at spring comes in roaring and soaming
<PB N="123" REF="1260"/>
very furiously, whence it is called the boar. Such tides rise twenty-two feet at the key. An estimate may be made of its trade by the receipt of the customs, which amount to upwards of three thou∣sand pounds a year, clear of salaries and incidental charges. Besides its coasting trade to Bristol, Wales, and Cornwall, it has a considerable foreign trade to Ireland, Portugal, Newfoundland, and sometimes to the Streights, Virginia, and the West Indies. The town has a revenue of ten thousand pounds; its freemen are free in all the ports of England, except London, and of Ireland, except Dublin; and its bailiffs have the authority of sheriffs within the borough, which was made a county of itself by Henry VIII. It contains about four thousand souls, has some good inns, a spaci∣ous town-hall, church, and free-school, a private academy for such of their youth as are intended for preachers, and a fine meeting-house, with this peculiarity, that it has an advanced seat for the mayor and aldermen, who happen to be dissenters. The famous admiral Blake was a native of this town, as was also John Oldmixon, esquire, who wrote that admiral's life, together with the history of the Stuarts. Four miles below Bridgewater is the lordship of Powlet, which gave name to the dukes of Bolton and earls Powlet.</P>
<P>Minehead stands on the Bristol channel, has a safe harbour, and is much frequented by passengers to and from Ireland. It is divided into the upper and lower, middle and key towns, containing about two thousand souls. It is well built and the har∣bour is capable of receiving ships of the greatest burden. Its chief trade is with Ireland and South Wales, for both which it is very conveniently situ∣ated, importing great quantities of wool from the former, and of coals from the latter; it has also a correspondence with the merchants of Bristol and
<PB N="124" REF="1270"/>
Barnstaple, sends ships sometimes to Virginia and the West-Indies, and several thousand barrels of herrings to the Mediterranean every year. It was made a corporation, and had large privileges grant∣ed to it by queen Elizabeth, on condition of keep∣ing the key in repair; but that having been ne∣glected, it has lost them, and is now governed by two constables, chosen at the court-leet of the Lut∣terels, who are lords of the manor, and who have made a fine key and piers, in consequence of an act of parliament, by which they were entitled to the profits of certain duties for a number of years.</P>
<P>Taunton, or Thonton, is a large populous town, the number of its inhabitants amounting to twenty-thousand. It is situated on the Thone, which was made navigable to Bridgewater by an act of parliament in the reign of William III. and has here a bridge over it of six arches. The streets are spacious and clean, but the smell of the oil used about the wool is offensive to strangers; for here is a great woollen manufacture, which employs several thousand of the inhabitants. In this town is an academy to train up dissenters for the ministry, two churches, several alms-houses, and a well en∣dowed free-school. Dissenters of all denomina∣tions have meeting-houses in this place. The assizes for the county are generally held in the hall of a castle built by one of the bishops of Winchester, to whom the town belonged before the conquest. There was once another castle built by Ina, king of the West Saxons. The corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, justice, two aldermen, twenty-four capital burgesses, a town-clerk, two consta∣bles, two portreves, and two serjeants at mace. The community has no lands or houses, or stock of money, and the mayor very trifling privileges, in comparison of those of other towns: therefore, tho' the town is the most flourishing, the corpo∣ration
<PB N="125" REF="1280"/>
is the poorest in the county. The inhabi∣tants of Taunton were among the first that joined the prince of Orange at his landing, and are still counted among the most zealous whigs of Eng∣land. Every pot-walloner in this town, that is all who dress their own victuals, have a vote for members of parliament; for which reason the lodgers, a little before the election comes on, take care to boil their victuals in the street, that they may be intitled to vote. In the vale of Taunton, vul∣garly called Taunton-Dean, the lands are said to be so exceeding rich, as to need no manure; but the inhabitants are very boorish. The bishop of Winchester has great interest in Taunton, his quit∣rents and fines amounting to about one thousand six hundred pounds a-year. All the lands are re∣gistered, and tho' subject to fines, quit-rents, suit and service, commonly sell at twenty years purchase. Near this place is the isle of Athelney, formed by the conflux of the Parret and Thone, where king Alfred, with a few of his nobles, concealed them∣selves, when the Danes had over-run the whole country to the forest of Selwood. Here he was en∣tertained by a poor swine-herd, whom he after∣wards made bishop of Winchester.</P>
<P>Ilchester, or Ivelchester, had its name from its situation on the river Ivel. It is very antient, being the Ischalis of Antoninus, where Roman coins are often found. It appears to have been much larger formerly than it is now, and to have had a castle and double walls. Here is the county gaol, and the county courts are held at this place. The knights of the shire are also chosen at this town. It is governed by two bailiffs and twelve burgesses, who are lords of the manor; and it gives title of earl to Stephen Fox, brother to lord Hol∣land. This was the birth-place of the famous friar Bacon, who lived in the reign of Henry III. and was so learned, that he passed for a conjurer
<PB N="126" REF="1290"/>
in that dark illiterate age. As such he was taken up by order of pope Nicholas IV. and kept close prisoner many years.</P>
<P>Milbourn-Port is so antient a borough, that it is mentioned in Doomsday-book. It is governed by two sub-bailiffs, under nine capital bailiffs: there are also two constables of great power, and two stewards, chosen out of seven others, who have the custody of the common seal of the borough, and the distribution of the rents of the lands given to the poor. The two bailiffs return the members of parliament, and the number of the inhabitants is about eleven hundred.</P>
<P>Next to the parliamentary towns, Glastenbury, on account of its antiquity, claims the first place. The abbey, which gave rise to the town, seems to have been the first and oldest foundation of that kind in Britain. The monks pretend that it was the re∣sidence of Joseph of Arimathea and St. Patrick; but for this assertion they produce no good autho∣rity. The king of the West Saxons erected a church here, which he, and the succeeding kings, enriched to such a degree, that the abbot lived like a prince, had the title of lord, and sat among the barons in parliament, and no person, not even a bishop or prince, durst set foot on the isle of Avalon, in which the abbey stands, without his leave. The revenue of the abbey was above forty thousand pounds a-year, besides seven parks well stocked with deer. The last abbot, Richard Whi∣ting, who had a hundred monks, and three hun∣dred domesticks, was hanged in his pontificals, with two of his monks, on the Torr, a high hill in the neighbourhood, for refusing to take the oath of supremacy to Henry VIII. and surrender his abbey when required. He was also charged with seizing the church plate to support the rebellion in Yorkshire, and with having in his closet a manu∣script
<PB N="127" REF="1300"/>
against the king's divorce. The story of the Glastenbury thorn, and of its budding always upon Christmas-day is well known; however, that circumstance is false, tho', if the winter is mild, it always buds about the latter end of December, but later, if the winter is severe. Edgar, and many other Saxon kings, were buried here, and, as some will have it, Arthur the British king. By the ve∣nerable remains of this antient abbey and church, which are now mostly over-grown with ivy, they appear to have been very spacious and magnificent. The town, whose name some derive from Glastum, woad, which is said to grow hereabouts spontane∣ously, was in the time of its abbots both a parlia∣mentary borough and a corporation; but since that period it remained without these privileges, till Sir Peter King, afterwards lord chancellor, pro∣cured a charter of incorporation for it from queen Anne. There is a manufacture of stockings; but the chief dependence of the place is upon strangers, whose curiosity brings them to see the ruins of the abbey. The scite of the abbey now belongs to the duke of Devonshire.</P>
<P>Wellington is chiefly noted for its fairs for cat∣tle, and its manufacture of serges, druggets, &amp;c. It was also the seat of that upright judge, lord chief justice Popham, who founded an hospital in it for six poor men and as many women.</P>
<P>Dulverton is a pretty town on the London road to Truro, in Cornwall. In its neighbourhood are mines of lead. It is governed by a portreve and recorder, who keep a court of record, and have power of arrests.</P>
<P>Dunster is an antient town on the Severn sea, consisting of about four hundred houses, with a manufacture of kerseys. It had formerly a castle, now in ruins, in which the famous William Prynne was imprisoned in Oliver's time, for re∣fusing to pay taxes.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="1310"/>
Watchet is a small harbour, having a few vessels belonging to it. The pier was built by the late Sir William Wyndham, for which he was allowed the key duties, by act of parlia∣ment. The inhabitants burn abundance of sea∣weed for the glass-houses at Bristol, and make lime, both for building and manuring their land, of pebbles fetched from the sea coast. A great deal of alabaster is washed down from the sea-cliffs here, and conveyed to Bristol.</P>
<P>Yeovil is a large town, containing above two thousand inhabitants, governed by a portreve and twelve burgesses. Here is a manufacture of cloth and gloves, and one of the greatest markets in the county for corn, cheese, hemp, flax, linnen, and sail cloth. At Camelet and Chesterton, in its neighbourhood, are the remains of a Roman camp; and many coins and other antiquities have been dug up there.</P>
<P>At Somerton, as we observed before, from which the county derives its name, and once its capital, was antiently a strong castle, in which John, king of France, was some time confined. Near the town is a common of twenty thousand acres, where most of the cattle brought to its fairs and markets are fed.</P>
<P>Axbridge, a borough under Mendip-hills, up∣on the river Axe, from which it derives its name, is a neat clean little town, and a corporation, consisting of a mayor, aldermen, and burgesses, who are lords paramount of the manor. The un∣der-lords are called and sit as judges in the court∣leet. Teazles, a kind of thistles used in dressing cloth, are more cultivated here than in any other place in England.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Axbridge is the pa∣rish of Chedder, which is noted for its fine large cheeses, some of which weigh one hundred or a
<PB N="129" REF="1320"/>
hundred and fifty pounds, and cost sixpence a pound on the spot. The parish is twenty-three miles in compass; and abounds so much with ap∣ple-trees, that three thousand hogsheads of cyder have been made in a season, and thirty-nine horse∣loads of apples sent every week to Shipton-Mallet for sale, for twenty-nine weeks running. Above the town is a gap, between two hills or rocks, two or three hundred feet high, for a mile together, called Cheddar-cliffs. At the foot of these cliffs rises a spring, which within a quarter of a mile of its source drives twelve mills.</P>
<P>Chard consists of four streets, which terminate near the market-place. It has a good market for corn and butcher's meat, and a woollen manu∣facture, but not very considerable.</P>
<P>Keynsham, or Canesham, lies between Bath and Bristol, has a bridge of fifteen arches over the Avon, and a considerable trade in malt. Here was antiently a priory of black canons, and a royal deer-park. In its neighbourhood is a quarry, where stones, called snake's-stones, are found, be∣cause they have the resemblance of a serpent, ex∣cept that they want the head, and are of all sizes. Betwixt this town and Bristol are mines of coal, like those of Newcastle. At Staunton Drew, not far from this place, is a monument called the Wedding, something like Stonhenge; and on the top of a hill a camp named Stantonbury.</P>
<P>Bruton. Here was antiently a priory, and now there is a handsome church, free-school, alms-house, and a great manufacture of serges and stockings.</P>
<P>Castle-Carey is a small town, and of note only for its mineral water, described by Dr. Guidot in his account of those of Bath. Here was antiently a castle, as its name imports.</P>
<P>Shepton-Mallet is a large town, but very irre∣gular,
<PB N="130" REF="1330"/>
by being situated on steep hills. It is go∣verned by a constable, and has some considerable clothiers in it.</P>
<P>Croscomb is a pretty neat town on a river, in the road to Wells. Some cloth is made here; but the principal manufacture is that of stockings.</P>
<P>Froome-Selwood is a very large town, a great thoroughfare, and the chief of that district antient∣ly called Selwoodshire, which was one continued forest in the east part of this county, and the west of Wiltshire Here, tho' the town is larger than some cities, is but one church, which is very hand∣some, and has a good organ; but there are six or seven meeting-houses, some of them very large and neat, besides a free-school and an alms-house. Tho' the inhabitants are reckoned to be about thirteen thousand, it is no corporation, but is governed by two constables chosen at the court-leet. The woollen manufacture, in this town and its neigh∣bourhood, was formerly so considerable, that seven waggons, containing each one hundred and forty pieces worth fourteen pounds, one piece with an∣other, were sent out weekly for Blackwell-hall. These manufactures still flourish here, tho', perhaps, not in such an extraordinary manner as in times past. This town is also noted for its fine beer; as a neigh∣bouring solitary village called Agford is for the residence of the late celebrated Mrs. Rowe. She was born at Ilchester; but here she composed most of her pieces, both in prose and verse.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Mendip-Hills extend a great way, are very steep, and noted for lead and coals. Any Eng∣lishman may work in the lead mines, unless he has forfeited his right by stealing any of the ore or tools. Whoever is found guilty of these, is shut
<PB N="131" REF="1340"/>
up in a hut, surrounded with fern, which is set on fire. As his hands and feet are at liberty, he is allowed to open himself a way thro' the hut and flames, but must never be seen there again. This is called burning the hill. The lead of these hills, not being so soft and pliant as that of Derbyshire, is not so proper for sheeting, but is generally ex∣ported, and cast into bullets and small shot. Those employed in melting the lead are subject to a disease in the bowels, which frequently proves fatal, and the smoke often kills the cattle that feed in the neighbourhood: nor can those who live near the place where the lead ore is washed, keep either cat or dog, or any sort of fowl, for they all die in a short time, and even their children sometimes expire suddenly. The air near the mines is thick, cold, and foggy, and the soil red and stony. The trees have their tops blasted, their leaves and bark discoloured and scorched, and they grow to no considerable size. Frost and snow melt quickly near the mines, tho' they remain longer upon other parts of the hills than any where else in the adjacent country. Thunder-storms, nocturnal∣lights, and fiery meteors, are more common here than elsewhere. For a supply of air, the miners have elm-boxes, exactly closed, by which they carry it down above twenty fathom. Thirty-six hundred of the best ore will yield above a ton of lead, which when formed into what the miners call sows and pigs, is conveyed to Bristol, and exported. In the parish of Workey, on the south-side of the hill, is a famous cave called Workey-hole. The water, that is continually dropping from the roof of it, and consolidating into a glassy substance, presents a great many chimerical figures, especi∣ally to strong imaginations. The darkness of the place, the height of the vault, the hollow mur∣mur of the waters thro' the rocks, and the echo,
<PB N="132" REF="1350"/>
which is very surprising to those who are unac∣quainted with the nature of sounds, render it very awful and tremendous. To the roof of it, at cer∣tain places, hang multitudes of bats. Near the hills are some veins of magnesia and yellow okre; and at Bishop's-Chew is dug up a red bolus, which is used all over England for marking sheep, and by the apothecaries for bolus armenus. In Bishop's Chew, or Chew-magna parish, the houses, even of the poorest people, are extremely neat, being generally whited over, and accommodated with neat gardens. On the top of the hill, in the same parish, from whence there is a very noble prospect, are the remains of a camp, trebly forti∣fied, and of a circular form, for which reason it is called Bow-ditch.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the west by So∣mersetshire, on the east by Berkshire and Hamp∣shire, on the north by Glocestershire, and on the south by Dorsetshire and part of Hampshire. The length amounts to thirty-nine miles, its breadth to thirty, and its circumference to one hundred and forty. It contains twenty-nine hun∣dreds, twenty-three market towns, three hundred and four parishes, and about eight hundred and seventy-six thousand souls. Besides two members for the shire, and two for the city of Salisbury, each of the following towns sends two to parliament, viz. Wilton, Downton, Hindon, Heytesbury, West∣bury, Calne, Devizes, Chippenham, Malmsbury, Cricklade, Great Bedwin, Ludgershall, Old Sarum, Wooton-Basset, Marlborough.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county is very healthy, not only in the more low and level parts, but also on the hills. The soil of the vales is very rich, and pro∣duces corn and grass in great plenty. The beau∣tiful downs in the south yield the finest pasture for sheep, with which they are overspread. The greatest disadvantage the county labours under is want of fuel, as there are no coal-pits, and but little wood. This county is noted for great quan∣tities of very fine cheese, and for its manufacture of broad cloth, to which it was invited by the great plenty and fineness of its wool. Besides lesser streams not a few, it is watered by the rivers Isis, Kennet, Upper and Lower Avon, Willy,

<P>Salisbury, the capital, is large and well built. It owed its rise to its cathedral, which was begun in 1219, and finished in 1258. According to an estimate delivered in to Henry III. it cost forty thousand marks. It is a Gothic building, and is certainly the most elegant and regular in the king∣dom. The doors and chapels are equal in num∣ber to the months, the windows to the days, and the pillars and pilasters to the hours in a year. It is built in the form of a lantern, with a spire in the middle, and nothing but buttresses, and glass windows on the outside. The spire is the highest in the kingdom, being four hundred and ten feet, which is twice the height of the monument in Lon∣don. The pillars and pilasters in the church are of fusile marble, the art of which is now either intirely lost, or little known. The roof of the chapter-house, which is fifty feet in diameter, and one hundred and fifty in circumference, bears all upon one slender pillar, which is such a curiosity as can hardly be matched in Europe. The turning of the western road thro' the city in the reign of Ed∣ward III. was a great advantage to it. The chan∣cellorship of the most noble order of the Garter, which is annexed to this see, was first conferred on bishop Richard Beauchamp. The hospital of St. Michael's, near this city, was founded by one of its bishops. Dr. Seth Ward, bishop of this see, in the reign of Charles II. contributed great∣ly to the making the river Avon navigable to Christ-church in Hampshire. The same prelate in 1683 built an hospital for the entertainment of the widows of poor ministers of the gospel. There are three other churches besides the cathedral,
<PB N="136" REF="1400"/>
which is without the liberty of the city, and a greater number of boarding-schools, especially for young ladies, than in any other town in England. Here is a manufacture of druggets, flannels, bone∣lace, and those cloths called Salisbury-whites; in consideration of which, and its fairs, markets, assizes, boarding-schools, and clergy, the city may be justly said to be in a flourishing condition. It was incorporated by Henry III. and is governed by a mayor, high-steward, recorder, deputy-re∣corder, twenty-four aldermen, and thirty assist∣ants, or common-council men. The number of souls is about ten thousand. That called the close, where the canons and prebendaries live, is like a fine city of itself. Here is an assembly for the la∣dies every Tuesday, and coaches set out from hence to London every day. In the cathedral is the figure of one Bennet, who endeavoured to fast forty days and forty nights, in imitation of our Saviour, but fell a victim to his enthusiastical folly. In this town are several charity-schools; the expence of one them is entirely defrayed by the bishop. The city gives title of earl to the noble family of Cecil.</P>
<P>Old Sarum, though now only a farm-house, was antiently a very considerable place. It was a Roman station, and in Antoninus's Itinerary, is called Sorbiodunum. Some of the latter Roman emperors are said to have resided here some time, particularly Severus. King Edgar, in 960, held a council here; but Swain, king of Denmark, plundered and burnt the town. In 1078, the bi∣shop's see was removed hither from Sherburn, and not long after the cathedral was built. Hither William the Conqueror summoned all the states of the kingdom to swear allegiance to him; and his son, Henry I. assembled in this town the lords spiritual and temporal. But not long after, it
<PB N="137" REF="1410"/>
began to be deserted, and a new town was began in the vale below, which was better accommo∣dated, both with respect to air and water, than the former. This, as well as three other poor vil∣lages not far from Salisbury, send two members to parliament. The number of the electors are about ten, who have lands adjoining, and are styled burgesses and freeholders.</P>
<P>Wilton was once the chief town of the county, to which it also gave name, though at present but a small place. It was very populous in the time of the Saxons, when it had a monastery and a great many churches. It was also some time the see of a bishop, but it began afterwards to decline, espe∣cially after the western road was turned through Salisbury. Its greatest glory now is the magni∣ficent seat of the earl of Pembroke and Montgo∣mery, built out of the suppressed abbeys, and called Wilton-house. The house was mostly de∣signed by Inigo Jones; and the gardens are so no∣ble, the furniture, the pictures, sculptures, the statues and bustos, both Greek and Roman, are so exquisitely fine and numerous, that it would require a volume to give any tolerable account of them.</P>
<P>Downton, pleasantly situated upon the Avon, is an antient borough by prescription, and its mayor is chosen at the court leet of the lord of the manor.</P>
<P>Hindon, another small borough, governed by a bailiff and burgesses, but a considerable tho∣roughfare, has a market, chiefly for cattle, and a manufacture of fine twist.</P>
<P>Heytesb ury is an antient borough, and stands on the river Willy, has a collegiate church with four prebendaries, a free-school, and is govern∣ed by a bailiff and burgesses.</P>
<P>Westbury, a small borough, deriving its name from its situation, is supposed to have risen out
<PB N="138" REF="1420"/>
of the ruins of the old Roman town about half a mile to the north, which some think was the Ver∣lucio of Antoninus. It is governed by a mayor, recorder, and twelve aldermen, and has a manu∣facture of coarse broad cloth.</P>
<P>Calne is a small, but populous, well-built town. On the other side of the river, on which it stands, near Studley, was antiently a Roman colony, from which this town is supposed to have risen, where Roman coins are often found. The West Saxon kings had a palace, and, it is probable, there was once a castle, from a street and field still called by that name. Here, in 997, was held a great synod to put an end to the disputes between the monks and secular priests about the celibacy of the clergy and the monks holding benefices; when, in the middle of the debates, the house in which the states were assembled suddenly fell to the ground, together with the bishops and no∣bility of the kingdom. Many were killed by the fall, and others bruised; St. Dunstan alone, who presided in the synod, and favoured the monks, escaped unhurt: in consequence of which escape, that party triumphed. The manor, prebend, and parsonage of Calne, are held by leases for several lives from the dean, chapter, and treasurer of Sa∣rum.</P>
<P>Devizes is a large populous town, consisting chiefly of two streets running parallel to one an∣other. It is thought to have been a station of the Romans, from the many coins, urns, and other antiquities dug up, and from the square camp on Roundway-hill, that overhangs the town. It derives its name from Devitiacus, a British prince, who resided in this part of the country. Here was antiently one of the strongest castles in Eng∣land, either improved or erected by Roger, bishop of Sarum, in the time of king Stephen. A dif∣ference
<PB N="139" REF="1430"/>
afterwards arising between the king and the bishop, the castle was besieged, and when it was surrendered by the bishop's nephew, forty thousand marks of silver, besides plate, gold, and jewels, were found in it. In the late civil wars, after it had been besieged several times, it was taken by the parliament forces, and demolished. The town has a great market for corn, wool, horses, and all sorts of cattle, and its malt-trade and woollen manufacture are very considerable; but it is but ill supplied with water. The corpo∣ration consists of a mayor, recorder, eleven mas∣ters, and thirty-six common-council.</P>
<P>Chippenham is a large well built town upon the Avon, over which it has a bridge of sixteen arches. It is supposed to have been a market from the beginning, its name in the Saxon im∣porting as much. It was one of the chief towns of the West Saxons, but queen Mary first incor∣porated it, by the stile of bailiff and burgesses. Besides being a great thoroughfare between Lon∣don and Bath, it has a well frequented market, and a manufacture of cloth. On the walls and windows of the church are the arms of the Hungerfords.</P>
<P>Malmsbury is almost surrounded by the Avon and a brook that runs into it, over which are six pridges. Here was antiently a castle, and the greatest abbey in Wiltshire, whose abbot was mitred, and sat in parliament. It was first called Ingleborn, and afterwards Maildulphbury, from Maildulphus, who lived as a hermit in a wood under the hill. Maildulphbury was after∣wards contracted into Malmsbury. Maildulph founded the monastery; but it was greatly en∣larged by his scholar Aldhelm, who was held in such veneration by king Athelstan, that he grant∣ed the town large immunities for his sake, en∣riched the monastery, and was at last buried under
<PB N="140" REF="1440"/>
the high altar of the church, where his monument is to be seen at this day. It had its first charter of incorporation from Edward, king of the West Saxons, and its last from William III. A great part of the abbey church still remains, and is used as the parish church. This town carries on a con∣siderable trade in the woollen manufacture, and is noted for being the birth-place of William, surnamed of Malmesbury, and Mr. Hobbes, the author of the Leviathan. It is a neat town, and governed by an alderman, chosen annually, twelve capital burgesses, four assistants, landholders, and commoners.</P>
<P>Cricklade stands at the influx of the Churn and Rey into the Thames, and contains near fourteen hundred houses. It is an antient borough by prescrip∣tion, and is governed by a bailiff. The advow∣son of its parish church, and its manor called Abingdon's-court, belong to the dean and chap∣ter of Sarum. It has a free-school handsomely endowed.</P>
<P>Great Bedwin, an antient borough by prescrip∣tion, Dr. Stukely takes to be the Lucomagus of Ravennas. Here was antiently a castle, the ditches of which are still visible in the south part of the town; and here was born that famous phy∣sician Dr. Thomas Willis, of Oxford. In the church, which is a stately fabric, among other monuments, is one of Sir John Seymour, father of the Protector. The town is governed by a portreve, chosen by a jury at the court-leet of the lord Bruce, lord of the manor; and the portreve chuses a bailiff and other officers.</P>
<P>Ludgershall, another antient borough by pre∣scription, though now no better than a hamlet, is situated in a delightful country near the forest of Chute. It is governed by a bailiff annually chosen at the court-leet of the lord of the manor.
<PB N="141" REF="1450"/>
Wooton-Basset is a borough both by charter and prescription. It takes its name from the fa∣mily to which it antiently belonged. Though governed by a mayor, aldermen, and burgesses, yet it is so mean a place, that the mayor is gene∣rally some poor mechanic.</P>
<P>Marlborough is thought to take its name from the hill of chalk at the foot of which it stands, chalk having been antiently called marle. It was one of the Roman stations, called Cunitio by An∣toninus, and had afterwards a castle, in which, in Henry III's time, was held a parliament, which enacted those laws called the Marlborough-statutes. It formerly gave title of earl to a family of the name of Ley; but now that of duke to a de∣scendant of the ever-victorious general, John, first duke of Marlborough, who was advanced to that honour for his great services by her majesty queen Anne. It is a great thorough∣fare betwixt London and Bath, has several com∣modious inns, and consists chiefly of one broad street pretty well built. There are still some remains not only of the castle, but also of a priory, and of the Roman Castrum, where coins are often found. There is little trade or ma∣nufactures in the town, though the Kennet was made navigable some years age from hence to Reading. It is a corporation by charter from se∣veral kings, and the lord Bruce is lord of the ma∣nor.</P>
<P>Trowbridge, which had its name from the stone∣bridge at the west end of it, over the river Were. Here was antiently a castle, of which nothing now remains; but a considerable manufacture of fine broad cloth is carried on in this town.</P>
<P>Bradford stands upon the Lower Avon, over which it has a bridge. Here was once a mo∣nastery,
<PB N="142" REF="1460"/>
near which a bloody battle was fought between Kenelwachius, king of the West Saxons, and his kinsman Cuthred. A synod was also held here in the tenth century. This town, as well as others in its neighbourhood, is noted for the ma∣nufacture of broad cloths, by which many great estates and families have been raised. Betwixt this and Bath lies Holt, famous for its mineral waters.</P>
<P>Cosham is a very healthy pleasant village, and a thoroughfare from London to Bath, from which it is only nine miles distant. Near this spot the Saxon king Ethelred had a palace, and kept his court; and here lady Mary Hungerford founded an alms-house and free school. In the south side of this place is an old house, in which Sir Richard Black∣more, the poet and physician, was born. The woollen manufacture is carried on here by several considerable clothiers. From Kingdown, in the neighbourhood, is a most charming prospect.</P>
<P>Lavington, called Market or East-Lavington, to distinguish it from West, or Bishop's-Laving∣ton, where the earl of Abingdon has a very fine seat, is situated in a pleasant country, and has two alms houses and a free-school well endowed.</P>
<P>Maiden-bradley had antiently a priory founded by Manser Bisset, sewer to king Stephen. In this town was born the famous republican and regicide, Edmund Ludlow, lieutenant-general of the armies of the commonwealth of Eng∣land, and lord deputy of Ireland. Here is a fine seat of the duke of Somerset's; and at Longleat, in this neighbourhood, is one of the noblest in the kingdom, belonging to lord Weymouth.</P>
<P>Mere. There is a hundred which takes its name from this place, of which it was once the principal town. It had antiently a castle, and is now a staple for wool. In Stourton-park, in its neighbourhood,
<PB N="143" REF="1470"/>
are the remains of a Danish camp; and there are several villages about it, that take their names from the little river Deveril, as Kingston-Deveril, Monckton-Deveril, Brixton-Deveril, Hill-Deve∣ril, and Deveril-Longbridge.</P>
<P>Warminster is a very antient town, which Camb∣den supposes to be the Verlucio of Antoninus, tho' no coins, or other remains of the Romans, have ever been discovered about it. On the downs on the east side of the town are two camps, one called Battlebury, thought to be Danish, from its double works; and another Scratchbury, which is a square fortification, with a single trench. It has a great market for corn, and a greater malt-trade than any town in the west of England, besides its cloth and wool-trade. It has moreover good inns, and is a very populous thriving place. This, with several other towns in the county, was antiently the estate of the Hungerfords, and afterwards was given by Richard III. to Howard, duke of Nor∣folk. West of the town is a high hill, call∣ed Clay-hill, which on Palm Sunday is covered from top to bottom with young people from the adjacent towns and villages, whose chief diversion is to see one another slip and tumble to the bottom. On the south, north, and east sides of this town are the downs generally called Salisbury plain. They extend near fifty miles from Salisbury to Wey∣mouth in Dorsetshire. Formerly they were thought incapable of producing grain, and only fed sheep; but now, tho' they still feed innumerable flocks of sheep, by turning up the land first with the plough, and then folding their sheep on it, they have been made to yield plentiful crops of wheat, barley and rye On these plains is Wardour-castle, which gives title of baron to lord Arundel of Wardour, a Roman catholic family.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES and ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>On the east side of Salisbury is Clarendon-park, which gave title of earl to Sir Edward Hyde, lord∣chancellor, in the reign of Charles II. It is very large and beautiful, and has twenty groves in it, each a mile in compass. Here were several palaces antiently, one built by king John, another called the King's-manor, and a third the Queen's, which is still in being, as are some remains of the others. Also a synod was held here in the reign of Henry II. when archbishop Becket, and the other bishops, swore to the observance of certain articles drawn up by the king, and called from hence the Con∣stitutions of Clarendon. On a dry chalky-hill, half a mile from hence, between Old Sarum and Winchester, is a Roman camp, said to have been made or repaired by Chlorus, father of Constan∣tine.</P>
<P>Stonehenge, reckoned one of the wonders of this island, is six miles to the north of Salisbury. It consists of two circles and two ovals, respec∣tively concentric, inclosed in a circular ditch. Some of the stones weigh above forty tons, and would require above one hundred and forty oxen to draw them. They are not factitious, but were undoubtedly brought from among those called the Grey Wethers, near Abury, on Marlborough downs, except the altar, which is a composition of red, green, and white chrystals, cemented by nature with opaque granules of a flinty or stony matter. It stands on the summit of a hill, or at least pretty near it. Of the outer circle, which, when perfect, consisted of thirty uprights, and thirty imposts, seventeen uprights are left stand∣ing, and six imposts. Of the other uprights and imposts, some are lying upon the ground, entire
<PB N="145" REF="1490"/>
or broken, and some have been carried off. The inner circle consisted originally of forty uprights, at the distance of eight feet from the outer circle, and lower by the half; but out of the forty, nine∣teen only are left: the walk between is three hun∣dred feet in circumference. The great oval con∣sists of ten uprights and five imposts; and the inner, with the altar, of twenty uprights, but some of these are broken or fallen. The whole number of which Stonehenge was composed amounted to one hundred and forty. Dr. Stukely, to whose Dissertation we refer those who desire a more particular account, has made it more than probable, that it was the chief temple of the druids in this island. All round Stonehenge, and in sight of it, are a great number of barrows, of a very elegant bell-like form, generally surrounded with a ditch. They are almost all of them upon rising-grounds, and in some places there are rows of them equidistant. Some have thought that there have been great battles upon the plain, and that these are the burial-places of the slain; but they are really no other than the sepulchres of kings and great personages, buried in peace, and set near this temple for the same reason that we bury in church-yards and consecrated ground. This county, besides other monuments of anti∣quity, exhibits a vast number of camps and forti∣fications, British, Roman, Saxon, and Danish, especially upon the downs. Of one of these at Aubery, on Marlborough downs, Dr. Stukely has given a very particular and curious descrip∣tion.</P>
<P>At Ambresbury, a place of great antiquity, was antiently a famous monastery, afterwards con∣verted into a nunnery, to which Eleanor, queen of King Henry III. retired, and in which she died. In 1285, Mary, daughter of Edward I. and the
<PB N="145" REF="1500"/>
daughters of thirteen noblemen, took the veil; and here Aurelius and several British princes were buried. In the river Avon, on which the town stands, a little fish called a loach is taken, which is usually put into a glass of sack, and swallowed alive.</P>
<P>Across the shire, from east to west, runs a won∣derful ditch, called Wansdyke. Mr. Cambden thinks it was cast up for a boundary between the West Saxons and Mercians; but others are of opinion it was made by Cerdic, the first king of the West Saxons and his son Kenric, against the incursions of the Britons; the rampire and graft are very large. There are a great many more upon the plain, especially about Stonehenge.</P>
<P>A little to the south of Marlborough lies Saver∣nack forest, the property of lord Bruce. It is twelve miles round, well-stocked with deer, and cut into beautiful walks and vistas, which meet in the cen∣tre, from one of which is a view of his lordship's no∣ble seat at Tokenham-park, contiguous to the fo∣rest, which is the only one belonging to a subject.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the south by Hamp∣shire, on the west by Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, on the north by the Thames, which separates it from Buckingham and Oxfordshires, and on the east by Middlesex and Surrey. The origin of its name is uncertain, and therefore shall not detain us. Its
<PB N="148" REF="1520"/>
length extends to thirty-nine miles, its breadth to twenty-nine, and its circumference to one hundred and twenty, within which it contains about five hundred and twenty-seven thousand acres, eighty-five thousand inhabitants, one hundred and forty parishes, of which sixty-two are vicarages, twenty hundreds, sixty-seven villages, and twelve market∣towns. It sends nine members to parliament, viz. two for the county, and two for each of the fol∣lowing towns, New Windsor, Reading, Walling∣ford, and Abingdon.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>This county is one of the pleasantest in Eng∣land, the air in general being good, and the soil fertile, especially in the vale of White Horse, so called from the figure of that animal, cut out of a chalky rock, as it is thought, by the Saxons, who bore a white horse for their arms. The more barren parts of it lie upon the east side, where are many woods and forests, abounding with game, and the finest oak and beech. The principal rivers are the Thames and Kennet, which are well stored with fish, particularly trout and cray-fish. The manufactures are chiefly woollen cloth, sail cloth, and malt. It lies in the diocese of Salisbury and Oxford circuit, and gives title of earl to a branch of the Howard family.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>In describing the towns, we shall begin, as usual, with the parliamentary boroughs.</P>
<P>Windsor is thought to derive its name from the winding of the shore of the Thames. It was given by Edward the Confessor to the monks of Westminster; but William the Conqueror brought
<PB N="149" REF="1530"/>
it back, by exchange, to the crown. It consists at present of several streets, has great privileges and immunities, and is governed by a mayor, high∣steward, under-steward, town-clerk, two bailiffs, and other officers subordinate to them. By a grant from James I. of the manor or honour of Windsor to the corporation, it has authority over several lord∣ships, as the dean and canons have over many pe∣culiars. William the Conqueror first built a castle here, with lodges in the adjoining forest; Henry I. rebuilt and fortified it. The bishop of Durham, who was one of the regents of the king∣dom during Richard I's absence in the Holy Land, resided in the castle; and Eleanor, wife to Edw. I. had four children born in it. Edward III. who was born here, and on that account called Edward of Windsor, built the palace-royal and chapel, St. George's hall and chapel, the lodgings on the east and south-sides of the inner court, the tower in the middle, the houses for the dean and canons in the outer-court, with all the walls, towers, and gates; all which he fortified with ditches, ram∣parts, towers, and several other places of strength. The whole consists of two large courts, with a tower betwixt them, and is about a mile in com∣pass. <Q>William of Wickham, then the court archi∣tect, afterwards bishop of Winchester, planned and directed the work; whence upon the inner wall of the little tower are these words: “This made Wickham.”</Q> Edward IV. rebuilt St. George's-chapel, and the houses of the dean and canons. Henry VII. added the fine building joining to the king's lodgings; Henry VIII. the great gate that opens into the outer court; Ed∣ward VI. and queen Mary erected a curious foun∣tain in the middle of the inner court; and queen Elizabeth made the noble terrace, faced withfree∣stone ramparts, like those of a fortified city,
<PB N="150" REF="1540"/>
where she used to walk an hour before dinner, if the weather was not windy. This terrace affords one of the finest prospects in the world, extending along the river on one side to London, and on the other to Oxford. King Charles II. laid out great sums in further improvements and embellishments of the palace, as did king James II. and William, especially in the article of paintings, of which there is a great variety by the most eminent mas∣ters, so numerous, that it would require a volume to describe all the pictures and rich furniture. The apartments for state, beauty, and convenience, are as fine as any in Europe, and larger and loftier than those of the so much boasted palace of Ver∣sailles. The hall, designed from the first institu∣tion of the noble order of the Carter for enter∣taining the knights at their installation, is one of the finest rooms in the world, and the paintings suitable to its magnificence. The royal chapel is one of the neatest and most beautiful in England, and the carved work exceeds any thing of the kind in this island. The tower above-mentioned is the habitation of the governor or constable of the castle, fitted up suitable to his dignity; and as often as he or the court is at Windsor, the standard is erected on the top of it. St. George's chapel is one of the most beautiful and stately Gothic buildings to be seen at this day, and displays not only the grandeur of the court in those times, but the spirit and genius of its magnanimous founder. There is nothing remaining of the kind so antient and so beautiful, both within and without, it having withstood the attacks of time to admiration. The yearly revenue of this church, before it was set apart to be the chapel of the order, was above one thousand pounds, a prodigious sum in those days. In the choir are the stalls of twenty-six knights of the order, and their banners over them,
<PB N="151" REF="1550"/>
with a throne for the sovereign. As the knights die, their banners are taken down, and their coats of arms and titles, engraved on little copper-plates, are nailed to the stalls. It appears from the re∣gistry of the order, that there have been eight emperors of Germany, thirty kings, ten electors of the empire, thirteen other sovereign princes, six princes of Orange, peers of France, grandees of Spain, &amp;c. companions of this most noble order, besides our own kings, and those of our no∣bility and gentry; of the former of which the Ratcliffs, Talbots, Howards, de Grays, Manners, Hastings, Nevils, Spencers, Montagues, Browns, Savilles, Sheffields, Mohuns, Herberts, Bridgets, and Wallops; and of the latter, the Hollands, Wingfields, Falstaffs, Stapletons, are the chief. Here is also a college, consisting of a dean, twelve secular canons, thirteen priests or vicars, four clerks, six choiristers, and twenty-six alms-knights, besides other officers, founded by Edward III. and incorporated by the name of the dean and ca∣nons of the free-chapel of St. George within the castle of Windsor, by Edward IV. The alms∣knights are now only eighteen, and are stiled the poor knights of Windsor, and have forty pounds a year. They are obliged by their order to go in their robes, twice a day, to church, to pray for the so∣vereign and the knights of the Garter. In the chapel lie interred the bodies of Hen. VIII. and one of his queens, as also those of Henry VI. of Edward IV. who has a fine monument of steel over him, and of Charles I. In a little chapel lies the dukes of Beaufort, descended from the dukes of Lancaster. At the west end of the square are the houses of the singing men, with each a little gar∣den behind it, the apartments of the canons, &amp;c. and at the bottom of the square is the library. On the south side of the chapel is an oratory, in which
<PB N="152" REF="1560"/>
prayers are read twice a day. There are two parks, the great and the little, the former fourteen, and the latter not much more than three miles in circumference, which has fine walks, a charm∣ing lodge for the keeper, and is well stocked with deer. In the house of office in the lodge is the history of the expedition to Mexico by Cortez, painted on mother of pearl, and presented to ad∣miral Churchill out of the spoils taken at port St. Mary and Vigo. The great park is extremely beautiful, and full of game. In it are several fine lodges, particularly that of the keeper, and the one called Cranburn, or the duke's lodge, from his late royal highness the duke of Cumberland, who generally resided there, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing ranger of both parks: at present his majesty's third brother, the duke of Cumberland, is ranger. Though the lodge was extremely beautiful before, both by art and nature, as it stands on the top of a hill, and commands a most inchanting prospect, with very large and elegant gardens, yet his late royal high∣ness made it still more delightful by various em∣bellishments.</P>
<P>Reading is supposed to have derived its name from the fern which grew hereabouts, called in the British tongue Redin. The Thames almost encloses the town, and hard by receives the Kennet, over which are seven bridges in or near the town. Here was formerly a strong castle, which was demolished by Henry II. The Danes are said to have retreat∣ed to it, when they were defeated by king Ethel∣wolph, at Inglefield, in this neighbourhood. Near the spot where the castle stood, Henry I. pulled down a nunnery, and erected a most mag∣nificent abbey, and endowed it with great revenues for the refreshment of travellers. He and his queen, and, as some think, his daughter Maud, were buried in it. After the dissolution of the monasteries it was converted into a royal seat,
<PB N="153" REF="1570"/>
which is now in ruins. Its last abbot, Faringdon, was hanged, drawn, and quartered, with two of his monks, for refusing to surrender it on demand. In the civil wars it declared for the king; but was reduced, after a siege of ten days, by the parlia∣ment forces. It is now a very large and flourishing town, being a great thoroughfare, and carrying on a considerable trade in malt, meal, and timber, which is conveyed to London by the Thames. It was formerly very eminent in the cloathing trade. Archbishop Laud, who founded an hospital here, was descended from a family of clothiers of this town. Some of the barges in which their malt is sent to London will carry one thousand or twelve hundred quarters. They bring back from thence coals, salt, tobacco, grocery-wares, oils, &amp;c. The number of inhabitants is computed at eight thou∣sand. Here in 1688 began the cry, called the Irish cry, that the Irish were plundering, burning, and cutting throats, wherever they came, which occasioned such an universal consternation, that every place was up in arms to defend itself. There is a great natural curiosity near this town, viz. a continual stratum of oyster-shells for five or six acres, of which a particular account is given in the second volume of Lowthorp's Abridgement. The corporation consists of a mayor, twelve aldermen, and as many burgesses, besides other officers. At this town the assizes are sometimes held: it also boasts of a stately county infirmary; and here lord chief-justice Holt was born.</P>
<P>Wallingford is a very pretty town upon the Thames. It is, according to Cambden, the Gal∣lena of Ptolemy and Antoninus, and the capital of the Attribatii. Of Gallena, a little altered, and of Ford, its present name, he thinks, it is compound∣ed. It had formerly no less than fourteen churches, besides a collegiate chapel in its castle, which was one of the largest and strongest in England,
<PB N="154" REF="1580"/>
and was annexed, with the honour, to the earldom of Cornwall. Cambden was of opinion, that it was a work of the Romans, being intire in his days, but now altogether in ruins. The town suffered greatly by a plague in the reign of Edward III. and afterwards by the loss of the road to Glocester, when the bridges were built at Abing∣don and Dorchester: notwithstanding which, it is at this day a large, handsome town, governed by a mayor, high-steward, recorder, five aldermen, who are justices of the peace within the borough, a town-clerk, two bailiffs, a chamberlain, and eighteen assis∣tants. Here are two churches, a handsome town hall, two good streets, and a free-school. The town has a right to the rents and profits of its markets, and the assizes are sometimes held in it. Its manufac∣ture of malt, and the convenience of sending that and other commodities to London by water, are its chief support. Near it is Choseley farm, said to be one of the greatest in England, being let at one thousand pounds a-year.</P>
<P>Abingdon took its present name from an abbey built there by Cissa, king of the West Saxons, which grew by degrees to such magnificence, as to vie with any abbey in Britain for riches and grandeur. The town, which at first had its chief dependence upon the abbey, became consider∣able after Henry V. had built bridges over the Ouse, and turned the high-road hither for a shorter cut. Before the abbey was built it was called Sheovesham. When the bridges were erected, the best artificers had but a penny a day, wheat being then at a shilling a quarter. In the Saxon times several synods were held in it. Henry II. was educated in the abbey, of which nothing is now left standing but the West-gate. One Mr. Barbour was a great benefactor to this town, par∣ticularly by promoting the building of the bridges
<PB N="155" REF="1590"/>
and causeways between them. The assizes are often held here, and the public business of the county is transacted in a large hall above the market house, standing upon lofty pillars of most curious ashler-work. The corporation, constituted by queen Mary, consists of a mayor, two bailiffs, nine aldermen, called principal bur∣gesses, an high-steward, recorder, town - clerk, and sixteen, or more, secondary burgesses, who, since the dissolution of the abbey, are entitled to the profit of its market and fairs. The chief trade of the town is in malt, which they send, with other commodities, to London. It gives title of earl to a younger branch of the Bertie family; and has two churches, two alms-houses, a free and a cha∣rity-school, besides an hospital called St. Helens. Here Whitlock, author of the Memoirs, is said to have been born.</P>
<P>The other places in this county worth mention∣ing are, Farringdon, a handsome town upon a hill, at one end of the vale of White-horse. It has a large church, and is governed by a bailiff.</P>
<P>Wantage, a pretty neat town. Here was an∣tiently a royal seat, where king Alfred was born. Its downs, about a mile off, are noted for horse∣races.</P>
<P>Hungerford, tho' situated upon a great road, and the river Kennet, is not considerable. Its trouts and cray-fish are reckoned very fine. The town formerly gave name and title to the barons of Hungerford: of which family, Sir Thomas was the first speaker of the house of commons, in the reign of Edward III. Walter, his son, who was the first baron and steward of the houshold to Hen∣ry V. held the castle and barony of Homet, in Nor∣mandy, by this tenure, that he should find the king and his heirs at the castle of Roan a lance with a fox's tail hanging to it. The constable of the town
<PB N="156" REF="1600"/>
is now lord of the manor, and holds it immediate∣ly of the king. They have a horn, holding about a quart, given them, as the inscription says, by John of Gaunt, together with the royal fishery in a certain part of the river.</P>
<P>Newbery or Newbury, i. e. the new borough, which name it acquired from its growing up as the antient Spinae of the Romans decayed. The latter is now a village in the neighbourhood, called Spinham land. Notwithstanding its name, it is as old as the conquest, was formerly noted for its manufacture of broad cloth, and still makes a great quantity of shalloons and druggets; in con∣sequence of which, and its lying upon the Bath road, with the river Kennet running thro' the town, it is far from feeling any symptoms of age or decay. At this place were two bloody engagements be∣tween Charles I. and the parliament, at both which the king himself was present. Fine trout, eels, and cray fish are caught in the Kennet; and at the sand-pits near the town several protestants are said to have been burnt in the reign of queen Mary. It is governed by a mayor, high-steward, recorder, aldermen, and capital burgesses.</P>
<P>I amborn, or Langborn, has its name from a little river that runs by it, and stands on the south-side of White-horse-hill. The river is re∣markable for being always full in summer, but en∣tirely lost in winter, the winter going off about Michaelmas. At Dennington, or Dunnington, in the neighbourhood, Chaucer is said to have lived, and to have composed many of his poems under an oak, which was standing about twenty or thirty years ago.</P>
<P>Sunning, a village situated on the Thames, was antiently the see of eight bishops, who had a palace and park here; but it was translated
<PB N="157" REF="1610"/>
first to Sherburn and then to Salisbury, to whose bishops this village still belongs.</P>
<P>Maidenhead, a pretty large well built town upon the Thames, over which it has a wooden bridge, maintained by the corporation, who, for that end, are allowed the tolls both over and under, and three trees yearly out of Windsor forest, towards keeping it in repair. It is governed by a high∣steward, a mayor, a steward, and ten aldermen; and out of the latter are chosen every year two bridge-masters. The mayor is clerk of the market, coroner, judge of the court, which is holden once in three weeks, a justice of the peace, together with his predecessor and the steward, and, in conjunc∣tion with the aldermen, has power to make bye∣laws. The revenue of the town consists chiefly of the tolls of the bridge and market. It has a gaol both for debtors and felons, a great trade in malt, meal, and timber, which are sent in barges to London; and is a considerable thoroughfare upon the Bath-road. There is a wood in the neigh∣bourhood noted for robberies, called Maiden∣head-thicket.</P>
<P>Bray, where, as Cambden thinks, was the ha∣bitation of the Bibroci, who submitted to Caesar when he crossed the Thames, and from whom he imagines the place had its name: but it owes its present fame more to its vicar than to its an∣tient inhabitants. This vicar was twice a papist and twice a protestant, in the reigns of Henry VIII. Edward VI. queen Mary, and queen Elizabeth. Being asked how he came to change his principles so often, he replied, that he was determined to live and die vicar of Bray.</P>
<P>Okingham, the chief place in Windsor forest, is a pretty large town, and has a manufacture of silk stockings. It has a free-school and hospi∣tal, and the corporation consists of an alderman,
<PB N="158" REF="1620"/>
recorder, and capital burgesses. The forest in which it stands gave birth to Mr. Alexander Pope, who out of filial duty, affection, and grati∣tude, has given a most beautiful description of it.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The antiquities of this county, besides those al∣ready mentioned, are a camp almost of a round figure at Ashbury-park, near Kingston-Lisle. A large camp of a quadrangular form, and single works, a mile above Wantage. Great numbers of Roman coins, lamps, &amp;c. have been discovered on St. Leonard's-hill near Windsor. A large camp at East Hempsted, in Windsor-forest, called Caesar's camp. At Laurence-Waltham several Roman coins, especially of the eastern emperors, have been dug up, and from the bricks and other ruins, it is supposed there was a Roman fort there. Cherbury castle, within two miles of Denchworth, an orbicular rampart, treble ditched, said to have been the castle of the Danish king Canute. Ick∣leton-way, part of Icknild-street, which may be traced to Strateley. Tombs and statues of an extraordinary size, about four miles east from East Ilsley, which the country people think were made for giants; but the antiquaries say for the family of la Beche, who had a castle here. Above White∣horse-hill a camp very large, but with single works: and at about two furlongs distance, a barrow called Dragon-hill, supposed to be the tumulus of Uther Pendragon.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which derives its name from its situation amidst the three kingdoms of the East, West, and South Saxons, is bounded on the west by Buckinghamshire, from which it is separated by the little river Coln and the shire ditch; on the north by Hertfordshire; on the east by the river Lea, which parts it from Essex; and on the south by the Thames, which divides it from Surry. It
<PB N="160" REF="1640"/>
is but of small extent. in length not exceeding twenty-one miles, in breadth fifteen, and in cir∣cumference eighty; but, by reason of the cities of London and Westminster, and the numerous large villages in their neighbourhood, it is by far the most populous and wealthy in England. The whole of it lies in the diocese of London, and is divided into six hundreds, two liberties, and seventy-three parishes, which, besides London and Westminster, contain five market-towns. There are several royal parks in it, and a great many chapels of ease. The sheriffs are not appointed by the king, but chosen by the liverymen of London.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>As the soil is gravelly, and exceedingly well cul∣tivated, in consequence of the great number of inhabitants, the air is very pure and wholesome. The great quantities of rich manure produced by such multitudes of people and cattle, has so im∣proved and enriched the lands, that they are ex∣tremely fruitful in vegetables of all kinds. In the neighbourhood of London there is little or no corn, the land being employed either for feeding cows, raising hay, or as garden grounds.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>London, the seat and capital of the British em∣pire, has been so fully and so often described, that it would be altogether superfiuous to enter into a minute account of it: we shall therefore content ourselves with a very brief and general description,</P>
<P>As to the etymology of the name it is uncertain, and therefore shall not detain us. This city is in∣ferior to few or none in respect of extent, wealth,
<PB N="161" REF="1650"/>
and populousness; but in respect of trade, in∣dustry, politeness, learning, and ingenuity, it at least equals, if not exceeds, all the other cities of the world. It is situated upon a declivity, and on a gravelly soil, along the north side of the Thames, where the river forms a kind of crescent. Of the part which lies within the walls, and is properly called the city, the extent is not great; but reckoning from Hydepark-corner to Poplar, the length is about seven miles and a half, and the breadth from the stones-end at Newington-Butts in Surry, to Jeffry's alms-houses, in Kingsland road in Mid∣dlesex, upwards of three miles: hence the cir∣cumference of the whole is almost eighteen miles. It appears to have been founded between the reigns of Julius Caesar and Nero, but by whom is uncertain; for we are told by Tacitus, that it was a place of great trade in Nero's time. From that period it has been continually increasing, tho' with many interruptions from enemies and fires, especially that in the reign of Charles II. Under the Romans it was neither a municipium nor colony, but only a prefecture, and on that ac∣count termed Oppedum by Tacitus; yet it was even then the capital of the island. It was first walled about with hewn stone and British bricks by Constantine the Great, at the request of Helena his mother, and the walls formed an oblong square, in compass about three miles, with seven principal gates. The same emperor made it a bishop's see; for it appears that the bishop of London was at the council of Arles in the year 314: he also set∣tled a mint in it, as is plain from some of his coins. The city afterwards took the name of Augusta; but whether from Helena Augusta, the mother of Constantine, or from the Legio Secunda Au∣gusta, is uncertain. It did not, however, long enjoy that lofty name, being again distinguished
<PB N="162" REF="1660"/>
by the more antient one of London. After the departure of the Romans, the Saxons got posses∣sion of and plundered it; but when they embraced Christianity, it rose again with a new and greater lustre: for Aethelbert, king of Kent, built a church dedicated to St. Paul, which, by improvements and additions at several times, became very large and magnificent, and was not quite finished till about the year 1312. This church, after several reparations, was at last intirely consumed in that dreadful conflagration which happened in 1666. In the Saxon and Danish wars the city suffered greatly, having been often sacked, plundered, and destroyed; but from the conquest till 1666, it had not felt any very signal calamity, tho' many fires had happened, the houses being then mostly of wood. What hath befallen it since that time to the present, is so well known, that it is needless to relate particulars. Within the walls are nine∣ty-seven parishes, and seventeen without. The number of inhabitants is computed at seven hun∣dred and twenty thousand. The city is divided into twenty-six wards, over each of which an alder∣man presides, who, with the chief magistrate, called the lord-mayor, who is also an alderman, and has the charge of a ward, the two sheriffs, recorder, chamberlain, town-clerk, and two hundred and thirty-six common-council men, have the govern∣ment of the city. The roads leading to it are very good; and it is plentifully supplied with fuel, wa∣ter, and provisions of all sorts. The principal streets, since the late improvements, are very neat, clean, well paved, and lighted. Its charitable foun∣dations for the relief of the poor in all the various distresses to which they can be liable, are no less the object of the admiration than applause of strangers. The immense traffic and correspon∣dence carried on by the merchants and tradesmen
<PB N="163" REF="1670"/>
of this city, whether singly, or by companies, contributes in an extraordinary degree both to its own flourishing condition, and that of the whole nation. Some idea of its extensive commerce may be formed by the number of ships in the Thames, whose masts appear like a forest, as well as by the duties paid on merchandize at the custom-house, which so far back as the year 1728 amounted to up∣wards of two millions eight hundred thousand pounds sterling; and by the incredible sums of money raised in it upon the credit of government, during the emergencies of war. The surprizing wealth and populousness of London will further appear from a general estimate of the following articles of pro∣visions consumed in the course of one year within the city and suburbs of London and Westminster.</P>

The societies and institutions for advancing reli∣gion both at home and abroad, good manners, arts, sciences, commerce, and manufactures, the study of the laws, and of antiquities, claim like∣wise our particular admiration and applause.</P>
<P>The government of the city of London, as already observed, is vested in the lord-mayor, al∣dermen, sheriffs, recorder, chamberlain, and the common-council. The lord-mayor is chosen on Michaelmas-day by the liverymen out of those aldermen who have served the office of sheriff, but have not yet been mayors; the liverymen gene∣rally return to the court of aldermen the two seniors below the chair, of whom they chuse one. He is sworn in at Guildhall on the festival of St. Simon and St. Jude, October 28; and on Nov. 9, he goes to Westminster by water in great pomp, and is sworn in before the barons of the exchequer. He returns by water again, attended by the city companies in their barges, to Guildhall, where a magnificent entertainment is prepared, which the lord-chancellor, judges, foreign ambassadors, mi∣nisters of state, and many of the nobility, gene∣rally honour with their presence, and sometimes even the king, queen, and princes of the blood. His jurisdiction extends not only over the city and part of the suburbs, but also over the river from the mouth of the Medway to Staines bridge. When he appears abroad, he wears a scarlet or purple robe with a gold chain, and is attended in his coach and six by a great many officers. Du∣ring his mayoralty he resides at the mansion-house, which is richly furnished, and in which he keeps open table. If a lord-mayor refuses to serve after he is chosen, he is liable to be fined.</P>
<P>The aldermen, who are twenty-six in number, preside over the several wards, by whom they are chosen. They are such for life, unless they chuse to resign. The lord-mayor and aldermen have a great
<PB N="165" REF="1690"/>
share in the legislative, and almost the whole exe∣cutive power in the city, and by them most of the city officers are appointed. All that are above the chair are justices of the peace, and the three eldest below the chair. Each of them has one or two deputies to assist him in the management of the affairs of the ward.</P>
<P>The two sheriffs are chosen annually on Mid∣summer-day by the liverymen. At Michaelmas they are sworn and enter upon their office. Each of them has an under-sheriff and other officers sub∣ordinate to them, When chosen, they must either serve or pay a fine of five hundred pounds to the city, unless he will swear himself not worth fifteen thousand pounds. No alderman can be lord∣mayor till he has served the office of sheriff.</P>
<P>The recorder and chamberlain are the next two chief officers and magistrates in the city. The former is appointed by the lord-mayor and alder∣men, and the latter chosen by the liverymen, and both for life. Other officers who hold their places for life are the bridge-masters, auditors of accompts, and ale-conners; but these are chosen by the liverymen.</P>
<P>The court of common-council consists of the lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council-men, chosen by the house-keepers in each ward. Bye∣laws for the city are made by this court, and com∣mittees for various purposes appointed.</P>
<P>There are many courts of justice held in the city before one or more of the above named magistrates; as the court of hustings, before the lord-mayor, aldermen, and recorder, in which the four members of parliament for the city are chosen by the liverymen; the lord-mayor's court; the sheriffs courts; chamberlain's court; orphan's court, before the lord-mayor and aldermen once a year; court of conscience, before two aldermen and four commoners, each of which has its par∣ticular
<PB N="166" REF="1700"/>
department. Other assemblies are held in each ward, as wardmotes for chusing the officers and settling the affairs of the ward; and hall∣motes, held at the halls of the respective compa∣nies, for regulating matters relating to their trade.</P>
<P>With regard to the tradesmen and mechanics, they are divided into companies, incorporated either by charters from kings, by prescription, or by act of parliament or common-council. Most of these have halls, and a certain number of live∣rymen, who pay a particular fine at their admission; and all of them have their different privileges and officers, distributing various sums to their poor, and in other acts of charity. For further particulars, we refer the reader to the histories of London; and to our general account of the commerce of the nation for what regards the trad∣ing and monied companies.</P>
<P>As to the shipping, it appeared from the gene∣ral register kept at the custom-house, that there were in the year 1732, one thousand, four hun∣dred, and seventeen ships belonging to the port of London, the crews of which amounted to twenty-one thousand, seven hundred, and ninety-seven. Further, it appeared, that in the year 1727, eight thousand, eight hundred, and eighty nine ships, foreign or British, had arrived at London, and the number is thought to exceed that sometimes con∣siderably. Betwixt London-bridge and Blackwall are a great number of docks, wet and dry, and yards for laying up, repairing, and building ships, lighters, hoys, &amp;c. besides the great numbers of the two last that are built above bridge. The offices for ensuring ships, goods, and merchan∣dize from hazards by sea, and for lending money on bottomree, are the Royal Exchange and Lon∣don insurance. There are others for ensuring houses and goods from loss and damage by fire, besides those for ensuring lives.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="1710"/>
The militia of London▪ consists of six regi∣ments, each of which is divided into eight com∣panies, making in all seven thousand two hun∣dred men, together with two regiments com∣manded by the lieutenant of the Tower, and the artillery company, which, added to the others, make the whole amount to above ten thousand men, including officers and drums. The officers are the lord-mayor, aldermen, and other principal citizens, who have their commissions from the king.</P>
<P>With regard to the ecclesiastical government, the bishop of London takes place next to the arch∣bishop of Canterbury and York; but his revenue is not equal to that of Durham and Winchester. His diocese comprehends not only Middlesex, Essex, and a part of Herefordshire, but also the plantations. Several parishes having been erected since the fire in 1666, there are now only sixty-two parochial churches, and of these several are pe∣culiars. Their revenue, at a medium, is about one hundred and fifty pounds a year, besides the parsonage-house and surplice-fees.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the immense consumption, this city is plentifully supplied with provisions. The markets, besides Smithfield, for live cattle, and Leadenhall, for butchers meat, &amp;c. are Ho∣ney lane, Newgate, and Fleet-markets for flesh, fish, herbs, and fruits; Billingsgate and Fish∣street-hill, for fish only; the three cranes in Queen∣street, for apples and other fruit; Bear-key and Queenhithe, for corn, malt, and meal; and at Billingsgate, every morning, on a broad place at the head of the dock, called Roomland, most of the coals consumed in and about the city are bought and sold. With regard to water, both this city and Westminster are extremely well sup∣plied from the Thames, or the New River brought
<PB N="168" REF="1720"/>
from Ware in Hertfordshire, and conveyed by pipes into every house at a moderate expence.</P>
<P>It is proper to observe here, that great altera∣tions and improvements have been made lately, both with respect to the streets in London and Westminster, most of which have been new paved with stone brought from Scotland, and in the Scotch manner. The sign-posts have been taken down, or placed against the walls of the houses. A fine new bridge with elliptical arches, planned by that ingenious architect Mr. Mylne, is almost finished at Black-friars; Fleet-ditch is arched over; a fine street is to be opened from the bridge, thro' Fleet-market, into the fields north of the city; and the shore of the Thames, above and below the bridge next the city, is to be embanked, all in pursuance of late acts of parliament.</P>
<P>Having said thus much in general of this great city, we will now give some account of the most remarkable places in each ward.</P>
<P>Bridgeward takes its name from the bridge called London-bridge, which was first of wood; but that being burnt down in the reign of king Stephen, another was built of stone, which was not finished till the tenth of king John, and suffered much by a fire four years after. It had, till lately, a row of houses on each side, and was a very noble bridge for the time in which it was built; but the houses have been pulled down, and the whole so much altered and improved, that it looks now as if it was quite new. Under the first, second, and fourth arches, on the north side, are machines worked by the tides in the river, by which a considerable part of the city is supplied with water. As this ward contains the whole bo∣rough of Southwark, which lies in Surry, we shall take notice of the other remarkable places in it under that county.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="1730"/>
Tower-ward derives its name from the Tower of London, as it is commonly called, which is of great extent, and very antient: it has a broad and deep moat running round it, and a strong wall, on which a great many cannon may be mounted, by which it commands both the city and river; and besides these, there is a large battery of cannon opposite to it, on the bank of the river. In this tower, our kings sometimes formerly resided. Now the crown-jewels, the board of ordnance, a mint for coinage of money, a prodigious magazine of arms and artillery, a grand horse-armoury, and the archives of the na∣tion, are kept in it. Without the walls is a place for lions, tygers, and other wild beasts. There are several hamlets belonging to the tower, whose train-bands, amounting to about four hundred men, are obliged, when required, to do duty in it. In this ward is the custom-house, a spacious building with two wings: that called the long∣room, is fifteen feet high, and runs the whole length of the building, which is one hundred and eighty-nine feet. Here the commissioners sit, with their officers and clerks; and though the bu∣siness is immense, the customs amounting to above two millions per annum, yet is it transacted with as much order and regularity as the common af∣fairs of a merchant's counting-house, built said the customs of the port of London make two thirds of those of all England. A little to the north of London-bridge, stands a stately pillar, called the Monument, erected very near the spot where the great fire broke out in 1666, built of Portland stone, and of the Dorick order, fifteen feet diameter, and two hundred and two feet high from the ground. The pedestal, which is forty feet high, and twenty square, is adorned with cu∣rious bass-reliefs. Within it is a winding stair∣case, consisting of three hundred and forty-five
<PB N="170" REF="1740"/>
steps, and from the top is a noble prospect over the city.</P>
<P>Limestreet-ward. In this ward is Leadenhall, the greatest market, perhaps, in Europe, for but∣chers meat, meal, and other provisions, leather, raw hides, wool, Colchester baize, &amp;c. the meal, wool, leather, and Colchester baize, are sold in the hall. It is remarkable, that though the ward runs through several parishes, there is no church or whole street in it: but, besides Leadenhall and the market, it contains the India-house, erected by the company in 1726, which, though spacious, is not at all suited to the great figure the company makes at present in the trading world. It contains large warehouses and rooms for the use of the directors and clerks, with a spa∣cious hall and court-yard for the reception of those who attend on the company on court-days, which are every Wednesday.</P>
<P>Broad-street-ward contains Gresham-college, founded by Sir Thomas Gresham in queen Eli∣zabeth's time, for reading lectures on the seven liberal sciences. By the will of the founder, the professors have each fifty pounds a year out of the rent of the Royal Exchange, with lodgings in the college; but since the institution of the Royal So∣ciety, these lectures are in a manner deserted, the professors having seldom above three or four auditors, and these of the most ordinary people. This building has been lately purchased, in order to erect a spacious excise-office. The bank of England, that repository of immense wealth, stands also in this ward. It was founded in the year 1732, in Threadneedle-street, and is now a very large and stately fabric, having lately received great additions and improvements. In the hall, which is seventy-nine feet in length and forty in breadth, is an elegant marble statue of king William III. their founder, with an inscrip∣tion.
<PB N="171" REF="1750"/>
The cash is preserved in large vaults, that have strong walls and iron gates. On the north side, towards Bartholomew-lane, is the accomp∣tants office, which is sixty feet long and twenty-eight feet broad; and on the room fronting the gate, the transfer office is kept. Waggons loaded with gold and silver bullion are often seen in the court-yard. In this ward are also several parish churches, with Carpenters-hall, Drapers-hall, Merchant-Taylors-hall, Pinners-hall, the South-Sea-house, and the Pay-office. In the South-Sea-house all the affairs of that company are transacted. In the Pay-office all the stores for the use of the navy are paid for, and also the wages of the sailors in his majesty's service.</P>
<P>Cornhill-ward; in which is situated the Royal Exchange, one of the largest and finest of the kind in the world. The old one, built by Sir Thomas Gresham, having been destroyed by the great fire in 1666, the foundation of the present structure was laid in 1667, and finished in 1669. It is an oblong square of Portland stone, and cost sixty-six thousand pounds. There are arcades all round, paved with black and white marble, to which the merchants may retire from the sun and rain. The quadrangle within is one hundred and forty-four feet long, and one hundred and seventeen broad. All round on the inside are niches, in most of which are statues of the kings and queens of England, and in the centre of the area, that of Charles II. in a Ro∣man habit. There are two gates, one on the south and another on the north side; and on the south side is a clock with chimes. A kind of gallery runs round the four sides of the building, in which were formerly a great number of shops, that are now deserted. At present one side of it is employed as auction rooms for furniture; and in other apartments above stairs, are the Royal Ex∣change
<PB N="172" REF="1760"/>
assurance office, &amp;c. and in the vaults are the pepper warehouses of the East-India company. All the niches above the piazzas are filled except four; but of the twenty-eight below only two are filled, one with the statue of Sir Thomas Gresham, and the other with that of Sir John Bernard, who is perhaps the only citizen who ever had the honour of having his statue erected in his life-time, mere∣ly on account of his merit. All the statues were painted and gilt by a voluntary subscription in the year 1754. In the area, on the inside of the ex∣change, merchants meet every day at twelve at noon; and a prodigious concourse of traders of all nations continue there till two, in order to transact business; but soon after that hour the gates are shut, and not opened again till four. For the readier dispatch of business, all the different na∣tions and classes of merchants have their separate walks. The churches in this ward are those of St. Michael and St. Peter.</P>
<P>Walbrook-ward is remarkable for the mansion∣house, built for the residence of the lord-mayor, dur∣ing his mayoralty. It stands where Stocks-market was kept formerly, and is a large and magnificent structure, worthy of the first magistrate of so great a city. On digging for the foundation, the ground was found so full of springs, that there was a ne∣cessity for erecting it on piles. It is built of Port∣land stone, and adorned with a grand portico and pediment in the front. The apartments are very noble, especially the Egyptian-hall, designed for public entertainments; but it has the misfortune to be so crowded with houses, especially on the sides, that the rooms are dark. The pediment is adorned with a very noble piece in bas-relief, re∣presenting the dignity and opulence of the city of London. In Cannon-street in this ward is that re∣markable stone, called London-stone. It has been
<PB N="173" REF="1770"/>
there ever since the time of Ethelstan, king of the West-Saxons; but why, or by whom, set up is uncertain. In this ward is also the fine church of St. Stephen's Walbrook, Salter's-hall, and St. Swithin's-church.</P>
<P>Dowgate-ward. In Suffolk-lane, and the parish of St. Laurence Pountney in this ward, is Mer∣chant-Taylors school, founded by that company in 1561. It has convenient apartments for the masters and ushers; and forty-six fellowships in St. John's-college in Oxford were appropriated to its scholars by Sir Thomas White, the founder of that college. The school consists of eight forms, in which near three hundred boys have their edu∣cation; of whom, according to the constitutions of the company, one hundred are taught gratis, an hundred more at five shillings, and fifty at two shillings and six-pence a quarter. There are seve∣ral public examinations of the scholars in a year, especially on the 11th of June, when the vacant fellowships in St. John's college are filled up out of the scholars of the upper-form. The head∣master receives from the company a salary of ninety pounds six shillings per annum, and thirty shil∣lings for water, besides the quarterage from the scholars, which renders his salary very considera∣ble. The first usher has thirty pounds a year, and the two last twenty-five pounds, and all of them have proper apartments. In this ward are also the parish church of Allhallows the great; to∣gether with Plumbers-hall, Watermens-hall, Join∣ers-hall, Innholders-hall, Skinners-hall, Tallow∣chandlers-hall, and the Steel-yard.</P>
<P>Cordwainers street-ward is noted for the stately church, called Bow-church, from the arches or bows with which its steeple is adorned, and from which the ecclesiastical court, stiled the Court of Arches, took its name, that court having
<PB N="174" REF="1780"/>
formerly been held there. The great bell of this church being heard all over London and its neigh∣bourhood, it is said of one born in or about the city, that he was born within the sound of Bow∣bell. The present church was built after the fire in 1666, in which the former was destroyed. The steeple is much admired both for the design and execution. Sir Christopher Wren was the architect. It has all the five orders in it, placed as they are usually expressed. Tho' the dragon on the top of the spire is ten feet long, and pro∣portionably bulky, yet it is turned by the least wind. There is an incident in relation to the steeple of the old church worth mentioning: in 1196 it was taken and fortified by one Fitz-Osbert, a traitor, who, being smoaked out of it, was hanged, with nine of his associates, in Smithfield. The other churches in this ward are those of St. Antholen and St. Mary Aldermary.</P>
<P>Cheapside-ward. Guildhall, or the town-house of London, for holding the courts, and transact∣ing the business of the city, stands in this ward. It was begun in 1411, and finished in 1431. Being much damaged by the fire in 1666, it was soon after repaired and beautified. The great hall is one hundred and fifty-three feet in length, near fifty broad, and fifty-five feet high; and not to mention the figures of the giants, which are rather a deformity, is adorned with the city-arms, king's∣arms, the arms of the twenty-four companies, those of Edward the Confessor, and of England and France quartered together, the figure of Moses with the two tables of the Decalogue, the pic∣ture of the abovementioned Edward and his queen, of king William and Mary, queen Anne, king George I. and II. and queen Caroline, their present majesties, and lord-chancellor Camden. Between the columns are those of eighteen judges. The hall will hold near seven thousand people for the
<PB N="175" REF="1790"/>
election of magistrates and members of parliament. Besides the hall, it contains the lord-mayor's, and many other courts, the council-chambers, a great many offices, kitchens, prisons, &amp;c. Many of the colours and standards taken from the French at the battle of Ramellies, and presented to the city by queen Anne, are likewise stuck up in the hall. In this ward are also the parish churches of St. Mildred in the Poultry and St. Mary's Cole∣church, Grocers-hall, Mercers-hall, and the Poultry-Compter.</P>
<P>Bassishaw, or Basinghall-ward, takes one of its names from the hall now called Black∣well-hall, but antiently Basinghall. It is a square building, with a court in the middle, surrounded with warehouses, where is a weekly-market for all the broad and narrow woollen cloths brought out of the country. Each piece of cloth pays one penny for pitching, and a half-penny per week resting. The profits, which are said to amount to eleven thousand pounds per annum, are applied towards the support of Christ's-hospital, the go∣vernors whereof have the whole management of these warehouses. In this ward are also Coopers-hall, Masons-hall, Weavers-hall, and Bassishaw∣church.</P>
<P>Cripple-gate-ward. In this ward is Sion college, built and appropriated to the use of the London clergy, in pursuance of the will of Dr. Thomas White, vicar of St. Dunstan's in the West, who also ordained that a sermon should be preached be∣fore them quarterly in Latin, and that they should afterwards have a good dinner. In 1664 they were incorporated by the name of the president and fel∣lows of Sion-college. Here is a handsome hall, lodgings for the president, and chambers for the students, together with a public library, and an alms-house for twenty poor men and women, who
<PB N="176" REF="1800"/>
have each a room and between five and six pounds a year. In this ward are also the parish churches of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, St. Alphage, St. Al∣ban's, Wood street, St. Michael's, Wood-street, and St. Mary's, Aldermanbury, Lamb's chapel, Dr. William's library, and the halls of the haber∣dashers, waxchandlers, plaisterers, brewers, cur∣riers, bowyers, and loriners companies.</P>
<P>Farringdon-ward-within boasts of having within it that noble, beautiful, and stupendous pile the cathedral of St. Paul, which takes up six acres of ground, is four hundred and sixty-three feet from east to west between the walls, two hundred and twenty-eight from north to south in the cross-isle between the walls, one hundred and one from north to south in the nave between the walls, two hundred and fifteen from the pave∣ment to the top of the cupola, three hundred and forty-four from the pavement to the top of the cross, and ninety from the pavement to the highest part of the arched roofing in the nave and choir. It was near forty years in building, was designed by Sir Christopher Wren, and cost in the whole upwards of a million sterling. There are three grand porticoes, supported by stately columns, on the north, south, and west sides. The nave and choir are paved with marble, and the altar with porphyry finely polished. The dome is painted by Sir James Thornhill, with the history of St. Paul's conversion, and has on its vertex a neat balcony, and above that a beautiful stone lan∣thorn, near seventy feet high, with a ball and a fine gilt cross at top. The church is built of Portland stone, in form of a cross, in imitation of St. Peter's at Rome; and the expence of it was de∣frayed by a duty on coals. On the east side of the cathedral is the famous school called St. Paul's school, founded by Dr. John Collet, dean of St.
<PB N="177" REF="1810"/>
Paul's, in 1509, and endowed with handsome stipends for a master, sub-master, and usher, to teach one hundred and fifty-three poor children of any county of England, or any nation. The ma∣ster, wardens, and assistants of the mercer's com∣pany, are the governors of the school, and ad∣mit the masters and scholars; some of whom, when they go to the university, have exhibitions for seven years, unless provided for sooner. The upper-master has three hundred pounds a-year, besides the advantage of additional scholars and boarders, by which he generally makes about two hundred pounds a-year more; the second master has two hundred and fifty pounds, and the third ninety pounds a-year. In Warwick-lane in this ward is the college of physicians, a stately build∣ing, tho' badly situated. It has several grand apartments, particularly the hall, committee-room, another where the members meet once a quarter, besides the library, dispensatory, theatre, preparing-room, and garrets to dry herbs; and is adorned with pictures, sculptures, statues, and busts, particularly those of king Charles II. Sir John Cutler, and doctor Harvey. In the hall two of the fellows meet twice a week, to dispense advice and medicines to the poor gratis. The college consists of a president, censors, fellows, candidates, ho∣norary fellows, and licentiates, incorporated by charters from several kings, and vested with sundry powers, privileges, and immunities; in conse∣quence of which they are not obliged to bear, or provide arms, or to serve on juries. They may take six bodies a-year, executed at Tyburn, for the pur∣poses of dissection; and none but such as they li∣cence, can legally practise physic within London, or seven miles round it. They have a good li∣brary, particularly of books relating to their own profession. Adjoining to Christ-church, in New∣gate-street,
<PB N="178" REF="1820"/>
is the noble charity called Christ's-hos∣pital, a most spacious structure, founded by Ed∣ward VI. for the poor children of both sexes of de∣cayed citizens; of whom about one thousand are ge∣nerally maintained, clothed, and instructed, either in the hospital here, or in two houses at Ware and Hertford dependant upon it. In 1673, a mathe∣matical-school was founded by Charles II. and en∣dowed with three hundred and seventy pounds a-year, and, in 1694, a writing school was erected by Sir John Moor, knight and alderman. The other schools are a grammar-school, a school for the girls, who learn reading and needle-work; and there hath been lately added a master to teach the boys drawing. Of the boys, those of the most pro∣mising genius, after being seven or eight years on the foundation, are sent to the university, some to sea, and others are put out apprentices, with a suit∣able sum. They are dressed in blue, whence they are called Blue-coat boys, and the hospital, Blue∣coat hospital. There are three hundred governors, who appoint the officers of the hospital, and admit the children. It is a pleasing sight to behold the children at supper on a Sunday evening in the hall. There are eight wards for the children's beds, that of the girls being separated from the rest; and there is also a ward for the sick. Each of the ma∣sters have one hundred pounds a-year, besides an additional salary of twenty pounds allowed the grammer - master for catechising the boys, his usher has fifty pounds a-year: in short, twelve or thirteen hundred pounds a-year are expended in salaries to the officers, clerks, and servants; and the sum disbursed for the support of the hospital, amounts to between eleven and twelve thousand pounds, for defraying of which the hospital has a great estate in lands and houses, besides the re∣venue arising from licensing the city carts, and
<PB N="179" REF="1830"/>
From Black well-hall. The other remarkable places in this ward are Christ's-church in Newgate street, St. Vedast's in Foster-lane, St. Martin's, Ludgate, and St. Martin's, Friday - street; Stationers-hall, Apothecaries-hall, Sadlers-hall, Embroiderers-hall, and Scots-hall: the last belonging to a corpora∣tion for the relief of poor, sick, aged, and reduced Scotsmen and women. They also employ and in∣struct poor Scottish orphans, bury the dead, and give money to such as are disposed to return to Scotland. The sums distributed by this society a∣mount to about six hundred pounds a-year.</P>
<P>Castle-Baynard-ward contains Doctor's-Com∣mons, where the judges and lawyers belong∣ing to the ecclesiastical and admiralty courts live in a collegiate way. Here are also offices, in which wills are deposited and searched, and a court of faculties and dispensations. Causes are likewise tried in this place by the court of admiralty, and by that of delegates. The epithet of commons is given to it, from the civilians commoning together, as in other colleges. The causes of which the ci∣vil and ecclesiastical law do, or may take cogni∣zance, are blasphemy, apostacy from Christianity, heresy, ordinations, institutions of clerks to bene∣fices, celebration of divine service, matrimony, divorces, bastardy, tythes, oblations, obventions, mortuaries, delapidations, reparation of churches, probate of wills, administrations, simony, incest, fornication, adultery, solicitation of chastity, pen∣sions, procurations, commutation of penance, right of pews, and others of the like kind. The prac∣tisers in these courts are of two sorts, advocates and proctors. The advocates are such as have taken the degree of doctor of the civil law, and are re∣tained as counsellors. The judges and advocates, if of Oxford, wear in court scarlet robes, and hoods lined with taffata; but if of Cambridge, white
<PB N="180" REF="1840"/>
minever, and round black velvet caps. The proctors, who are the attornies in these courts, wear black robes, and hoods lined with fur. Their library contains a great number of books of all sorts, especially on civil law and history; and it must be continually increasing, as every bishop, at his consecration, gives, at least, twenty pounds, and some fifty pounds, towards purchasing books. Hard by, on St. Bennet's-hill, is the col∣lege of heralds, incorporated by Richard III. It consists of the earl-marshal, or his deputy, three kings at arms, Garter, Clarencieux, and Norroy, six heralds, four pursuivants, and eight proctors. In the college is a good library of books of heral∣dry and antiquities, and the records of the coats of arms of all the names and families in England. All causes and differences relating to arms, atchieve∣ments, and titles, are also heard here. In this ward are also several churches.</P>
<P>Farringdon-ward-without. In this ward are the two Temples, or inns for the study and practice of the common law; Serjeants-inn, for the use of the judges and serjeants; and six inns of Chan∣cery, in which attornies are chiefly bred, viz. Clif∣ford's-inn and New-inn belonging to the Temples; Staple's-inn and Bernard's-inn to Gray's-inn; and Furnival's-inn and Travy's-inn to Lincoln's-inn. The Temples are very neat, divided into several courts, having each their hall and library, and very pleasant walks and gardens. In the treasury∣chamber of the Middle-Temple is preserved a great quantity of armour, which belonged to the Knights-Templars, consisting of helmets, breast and back-pieces, together with several pikes, a halbert, and two very beautiful shields, with iron spikes in their centres, six inches in diame∣ter, and each above twenty pounds weight. They are curiously engraved, and one of them
<PB N="181" REF="1850"/>
richly inlaid with gold: the insides are lined with leather stuffed, the edges being adorned with silk fringe, and broad leathern bells are fixed to them for the bearer to sling them upon their shoulders. Antiently at commons in the hall of the Inner-Temple, their bread served instead of plates, and they had no other drinking vessels than wooden cups; but at present they are allowed trenchers for their meat, and coarse green earthen pots for their liquor. However, tho' the custom of using mean vessels still prevails, yet there are few who fare better. All the members of the society who have chambers are obliged to be in commons a fortnight every term, for which they pay about ten shillings a week. Sixteen of these terms, with a regular course of study, qualifies a student for the bar. The expences of admission, with other dis∣bursements, amount to four pounds and two∣pence; but in the Middle-Temple the charge of admission is five pounds, and the time to qualify a student for the bar is twenty-eight terms. The chief officer of both houses is a treasurer, who is annually elected from among the benchers, and whose office is to admit students, to assign them their chambers, and to receive and pay all the cash belonging to the society. An assembly, wherein the affairs of the society are treated, is commonly held twice every term. The library in Garden - court, in the Middle-Temple, is open almost the whole year from morning to night. There is a church which serves both societies, and is a stately Gothic structure, with many curi∣ous monuments, some of them of knights-tem∣plars. To it belongs a divine, commonly called master of the Temple, and a reader, with handsome stipends: the master has also a house and garden adjoining to the church. Formerly there was a fixed lecturer for Sundays in the afternoon, who had
<PB N="182" REF="1860"/>
eighty pounds a-year from each society, convenient lodging, and his diet at the benchers table; but of late the lecture is carried on by various preachers appointed and paid by the treasurers of the two houses. The other places of any note in this ward are, the Sessions-house in the Old-Bailey, in which criminal causes, arising in the city of London and county of Middlesex, are tried before the lord mayor, recorder, and some of the judges, eight times a year. The Fleet-prison, allotted for the confinement of debtors from any part of the king∣dom, and for such as are guilty of a contempt of the court of Chancery and King's-bench: it hath been a very convenient prison, but is now old and decayed. There is an area inclosed by high walls, in which the prisoners divert them∣selves, together with a kitchen, and a coffee-house. If any of the debtors can give security to the war∣den, that he shall be forth-coming, he may take a house or lodging, and walk abroad any where within the rules, extending to one side of Lud∣gate-hill, the Old-Bailey, and Fleet-lane. The chapel of the Rolls in Chancery-lane, in which the modern rolls and records of the nation are kept; when these grow too bulky, they are re∣moved to the Tower. Within the liberty of the Rolls the city hath no authority. Bridewell is both an hospital and house of correction, into which a royal palace, that formerly stood here, was converted by Fdward VI. In the hospital are lodged twenty decayed tradesmen, with about one hundred apprentices, who, when they have served their time, have their freedom, and ten pounds to set them up. These youths, who are cloathed in blue-doublets and white-hats, are under particu∣lar regulations, distinguishing themselves at all dangerous fires, by the dexterity with which they work an excellent fire-engine belonging to the
<PB N="183" REF="1870"/>
hospital, and the expedition and regularity with which they supply it with water. In the house of correction, strumpets and other disorderly per∣sons are set to hard labour, corrected, or discharged, as the governors think proper. Hard by is St. Bride's church, a stately fabric, with a most beau∣tiful spire of great height. St. Dunstan's church, remarkable for a curious clock. Ely house, over against St. Andrew's church, Holborn. This has been the city palace of the bishops of Ely for near five hundred years. St. Bartholomew's hospital, for the cure of the poor, sick, and lame, from all parts of the kingdom was refounded by Henry VIII. out of an old infirmary and priory, and en∣dowed with five hundred marks a year; to which the citizens covenanted to add as much for the relief of one hundred lame and infirm patients: but the revenues of the hospital are now so much increased, that the annual expence amounts to about ten thousand pounds, and the number of patients in the hospital and locks to about six hundred, besides out-patients, officers, and ser∣vants. The building is equally magnificent, ex∣tensive, and commodious. Pity it is that so noble and humane a foundation should want any thing to render it perfect, and that every sick person who is admitted, except such as have suffered by accidents, as the fracture or dislocation of a bone, should be obliged to deposit, or give security for the payment of a guinea, in case of death, by which some of the poorest and most miserable ob∣jects are excluded; which is also the case of several of the other hospitals of this city. The governors are about three hundred, besides the lord mayor and aldermen. Contiguous to this hospital, on the north-side, is Smithfield, noted for its fair and weekly markets on Monday and Friday, the greatest in England for all sorts of live cattle. In
<PB N="184" REF="1880"/>
the reign of the bloody popish queen Mary, it was stained with the blood of many protestant martyrs. The last public edifice of this ward which we shall mention, is Surgeon's hall in the Old Bailey, an elegant modern building, with a noble theatre for the purposes of anatomy. In this ward is also a narrow-street near Smithfield, called Cloth-fair, because a fair for cloth was antiently kept in it, in which several eminent woollen-drapers still live.</P>
<P>Coleman street-ward is distinguished by that stately fabric called Bethlehem-hospital for the reception of lunatics. It is five hundred and forty feet long and forty broad, and is divided into a great number of cells, in which the unhappy patients, who are generally above two hundred, are taken care of without any expence to their friends, except cloaths, and burial when they die. Two handsome wings have been lately added for such lunatics as are incurable. The governors are the same as those of Bridewell, and are mostly substantial citizens, with a president, who is ge∣nerally an alderman. The galleries of the hospi∣tal are divided in the middle by two iron grates, by which means all the men are placed at one end of the house, and all the women at the other. St. Luke's hospital for lunatics is an improvement on that of Bethlehem: it is situated on the north side of the road, above Upper-Moorfields, in St. Luke's parish, and is supported by private subscription. In this ward are also Founders-hall, Armourers and Braziers-hall, and the Excise-office. In the last the commissioners, who have each a salary of one thousand pounds a-year, receive the produce of the excise of beer, ale, and other liquors; of coffee, tea, and chocolate; of malt, hops, soap, starch, can∣dles, paper, calicoes, gold and silver wire, vellum, parchment, hides, and skins, collected all over England, which they pay into the Exchequer.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="1890"/>
Having now gone thro' the several wards which contain any thing remarkable, we shall only men∣tion the remainder, viz. Aldgate, Aldersgate, Bread-street, Bishopsgate, Billingsgate, Candle∣wick, Langbourn, Portsoken, Queenhithe, and Vintry. The city had formerly eight gates, of which six are now pulled down, Ludgate, Bishopsgate, Moorgate, Aldgate, Aldersgate, Crip∣plegate. Those that remain are Newgate and Temple-Bar, which last is the boundary of the city liberties on that side. Newgate is the county gaol for debtors, and a prison for the criminals both of London and Middlesex.</P>
<P>Westminster. This city had its name from the situation of its abbey, antiently called a minster, in respect of that of St. Paul. That part proper∣ly called the city of Westminster, comprehending the parishes of St. John and St. Margaret, was once an island formed by the Thames, called Thorney Island, from the thorns with which it was over-run, and the abbey that stood in it, Thorney-abbey. The liberties of Westminster contain the several parishes of St. Martin in the Fields, St. James, St. Anne, St. Paul, Covent-garden, St. Mary le Strand, St. Clement, Danes, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> George, Hanover-square, and the precinct of the Savoy. The government, both of the city and liberties, is under the jurisdiction of the dean and chapter of Westminster, in civil as well as ecclesiastical affairs, and their authority extends to the precinct of St. Martin le Grand, by New∣gate-street, and in some towns of Essex, that are exempted from the jurisdiction of the bishop of London and the archbishop of Canterbury; but the management of the civil part has, ever since the reformation, been in the hands of laymen, elected from time to time, and confirmed by the dean and chapter. The chief of these laymen are the high-steward, the deputy-steward, and the
<PB N="186" REF="1900"/>
high-bailiff, who hold their offices for life. There are also sixteen burgesses and their assistants, out of which are elected two head-burgesses, one for the city, and the other for the liberties. Another officer is the high-constable, who has all the other constables under his direction.</P>
<P>We now proceed to give a short account of the most remarkable places in the parishes both of the city and liberties.</P>
<P>St. Margaret's parish. The places most worthy our notice in this parish are, first, the church, which is a large and elegant structure: it was first founded by Edward the Confessor, but has been often rebuilt and repaired from that time to the year 1735, in which it was beautifully repaired at the expence of five thousand pounds given by the parliament, being the church to which the house of commons repair to hear sermons upon the na∣tional holidays; there is a particular seat for the speaker. Secondly, St. James's park, of which, at least, the south side is situated in it, and there∣fore may be described here. This park is near a mile and a half in circumference; on all sides of it are very beautiful walks, and in the centre, ex∣tending nearly the whole length of the park from east to west, is a fine canal. On the south <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, near the east end, is a wilderness; at the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the parade, where the horse and foot-guard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rendezvous and perform their exercises. Front∣ing the parade, to the south, stands the treasure, a large massy building of Portland stone, contain∣ing halls, apartments, and offices, for the various branches of business transacted by the commission∣ers for executing the office of lord-high-treasurer of England; and here a committee of the privy∣council sit occasionally to hear appeals from the plantations. Here also is a stately building lately erected by the government opposite to Whitehall, called the Horse-Guards, because some of them
<PB N="187" REF="1910"/>
daily mount guard there. Thirdly, Privy-garden. This was the garden belonging to Whitehall pa∣lace before it was burnt down; but now it is quite open, and on some parts of it houses have been built by several noblemen, who have obtained grants of it for that purpose from the crown. Fourthly, the Almery or Ambry, to the south of Tothill-street, where the alms of the abbey is said to have been distributed formerly; and here the first printing-press used in England was set up in 1471, by the abbot of Westminster, and managed by Caxton, who brought it from Hol∣land. Fifthly, the Sanctuary; so was the abbey∣yard formerly called, because neither debtors could be arrested, nor criminals apprehended in it, but both bid defiance to justice, as they do still in popish countries; but this scandalous privilege was taken away at the reformation. Sixthly, the abbey-church of St. Peter. A church was first built here by Sebert, king of the East Saxons, and dedicated to St. Peter. That having been destroyed by the Danes, another was founded by bishop Dunstan. Afterwards a far more magnificent church and a monastery were built by Edward the Confessor. But the present lofty fabric was erected by Henry III. and was fifty years in build∣ing. Henry VII. afterwards added that most cu∣rious chapel, which still goes by his name, for a burial place for himself and his family. Leland calls it the miracle of the world. The first stone of it was laid in January 1502, and the whole charge of it amounted to fourteen thousand pounds sterling, a very great sum in those days. It con∣tains his own magnificent monument of solid brass gilt, and a number of others belonging to kings and great men, very splendid and noble. In the church also great numbers of eminent men, both in church and state, commanders by sea and land, philoso∣phers, poets, &amp;c. are buried, or at least have mo∣numents.
<PB N="188" REF="1920"/>
In it our kings are not only buried, but crowned, with great pomp and solemnity. In the ninth of queen Ann, four thousand a year, out of the coal duty, was granted by parliament for keeping it in repair. The revenue of the abbey, in the popish times, was near four thousand pounds, equal in value now to twenty thousand. It was also extremely rich in plate, jewels, and vestments. In Dort's History of the Antiquities of Westmin∣ster, we are told that it had large possessions in two hundreds, sixteen manors, seventeen hamlets, ninety-seven cities, towns, and villages. Queen Elizabeth, at her accession, turned out the monks and erected a college, consisting of a dean, twelve prebends, and forty scholars. In the east cloister of the abbey there is a library of about six thou∣sand books, belonging to the dean and chapter. Seventhly, the King's school, near to the abbey-church, on the south side, at first called the queen's school, as having been founded by queen Elizabeth, for a head-master, second mas∣ter, and forty scholars. The masters have hand∣some allowances, and the scholars their edu∣cation, diet, and lodging, and a gown once a year. Besides those on the foundation, great numbers of gentlemen's sons are now educated here, making in the whole about four hun∣dred; so that there are not only the two masters, but likewise five ushers. Of those scholars that are fit for the university, a certain number are elected annually by the dean of Christ-church, Oxford, and the master of Trinity-college, Cam∣bridge, alternately. In the former of these col∣leges they have a competent maintenance for life, and in the latter, till they are capable of provid∣ing for themselves. Eighthly, Westminster-hall, in which the coronation feast is kept, and the courts of Chancery, King's-bench, Common∣pleas, and Exchequer are held, was first built
<PB N="189" REF="1930"/>
by William Rufus, and afterwards repaired by archbishop Becket: it was repaired a second time, or rebuilt by Richard II. Though it is two hun∣dred and twenty-eight feet in length, sixty-six in breadth, and ninety in height, yet it has not a single pillar in it, but is supported by buttresses. On the east side of the gate, are the exchequer offices, whence all the public money is received and disbursed. This hall is also used for the trial of peers and others, upon an impeachment of the commons. A great number of colours and stan∣dards taken from the French at the battle of Hock∣stet, are stuck up in it. Ninthly, St. Stephen's chapel, near the south end of the hall: it belonged antiently to a college of canons, but is now the place where the house of com∣mons hold their assemblies, for which pur∣pose it has been used ever since the dissolution of the monasteries. It is a large commodious room, with benches ascending like those in a theatre, sufficient for the accommodation of six hundred gentlemen. It has also convenient apart∣ments about it for several purposes; and galleries in which strangers are sometimes permitted to sit and hear the debates. Betwixt the house of com∣mons and that of lords, are the painted-chamber and court of requests; in the former, conferences betwixt the houses are held; and in the latter, such as have business in either house attend. Tenthly, the house of lords. This is an oblong room, less than the house of commons, and hung with fine old tapestry, in which is represented the de∣feat of the Spanish armada. In it is a throne for the king, when he comes to the parliament, with seats for the prince of Wales, and other princes of the blood royal; for the archbishops and bishops; the temporal peers, according to their ranks; for peers under age, and sons of peers. The lord-chancellor,
<PB N="190" REF="1940"/>
keeper, and the judges, master of the rolls, and masters of chancery, when present, sit on woolpacks, to put them in mind of the im∣portance of the woollen manufacture to the na∣tion. Eleventhly, Westminster-bridge. This is a noble bridge over the Thames, from New Pa∣lace-yard Westminster, to Stangate in Surrey, begun in the year 1736, and built at the public expence, consisting of thirteen arches, of which the centre one is very large. At top there is a noble stone balustrade on each side, with re∣cesses, covered with half domes, at certain dis∣tances all along. On each side is also a broad foot∣path, with a road betwixt, large enough for three carriages to go a-breast. At night the bridge is well lighted by lamps placed along the balustrades. The expence of erecting it amounted to above three hundred and eighty-nine thousand pounds. Twelfthly, Whitehall, a magnificent palace built by cardinal Wolsey, upon whose death it came to the crown. It was greatly enlarged and beautified by Henry VIII. who removed hither from Bridewell, where he had resided after his pa∣lace at Westminster was burnt down. The addi∣tions made by Henry took up that space where are now the treasury, offices of trade and planta∣tions, of one of the secretaries of state, and privy∣council, besides dwelling-houses. But this palace was entirely destroyed by fire in the reign of king William, soon after the revolution, except the banqueting-house, which was added by James I. and is a very noble fabric, planned by Inigo Jones. There is one very stately room in it, now used for a chapel, from one of the windows of which king Charles I. was led to the scaffold. The cieling of it is finely painted by Rubens. Here are kept the office of one of the secretaries of state, the board of green-cloth, and the lottery-office.
<PB N="191" REF="1950"/>
Before this palace was consumed by fire, it was reckoned the largest in the world. While Henry was carrying on his improvements, he also built St. James's, and enclosed the park of that name for the embellishment of both.</P>
<P>The parish of St. John. There is nothing re∣markable in this parish, besides what hath been already mentioned, but the church, which is a very heavy building, with two porticoes, and four stone towers and pinacles on the corners on the outside.</P>
<P>We proceed now to treat of the parishes in the liberties of Westminster, and shall begin with that of</P>
<P>St. Martin's in the Fields. The church of this parish had its name from being situated at first in an open field, though the neighbourhood is now one of the most populous spots in London. The present church is very large and beautiful, has a fine steeple, spire, and ring of bells, a noble organ, altar-piece, and pulpit. The portico at the west end is very grand and lofty. The whole of the church is said to have cost upwards of thirty thousand pounds. The parish was taken out of St. Margaret's, Westminster; and though those of St. Paul, Covent-garden, St. Anne, St. James, and St. George, Hanover-square, have been taken out of it, yet it is still very large, and the rectory one of the best in England. The other places worth mentioning in this parish are, first, Charing-cross, so called from the cross erected by Edward I. to his beloved queen Eleanor in the village that then lay about it, called Cha∣ring. In place of the cross, which was almost destroyed in the civil war, was erected the pre∣sent equestrian statue of Charles I. after the re∣storation. Secondly, Scotland-yard, so called from a palace that stood here antiently, belonging to
<PB N="192" REF="1960"/>
the kings of Scotland, who, while they held any dominions in England, were obliged to come and do homage for them to the kings of this country. Here are now the war-office and board of works; but of the palace there are no remains. Thirdly, the admiralty-office. This is a massy stone struc∣ture, containing, besides the hall and other rooms, apartments for the seven lords of the admiralty, who have the whole management of the royal navy under the king. The clumsiness of the architecture is now happily concealed by an ele∣gant screen, in form of an arcade, at the en∣trance, contrived by Mr. Adams, the architect. Fourthly, St. Martin's school and library. Dr. Tennison, an eminent divine, and afterwards arch∣bishop of Canterbury, but then only rector of this parish, erected both these in the reign of James II. Fifthly, the Mews. Here the king's hawks were once kept, but now the place so called consists of two large courts, separated by a range of stables, in which the king's horses stand. In the courts are coach-houses and lodg∣ings for the grooms, footmen, and coachmen, under the master of the horse. Sixthly, Marlbo∣rough-house. This is a plain brick building, be∣longing to the dukes of Marlborough. It stands pleasantly, being separated from the park only by a small garden, and on the other side from Pall∣mall by a court. The apartments are elegant, well furnished, and adorned with paintings. Seventhly, Carleton-house. Here the princess dowager of Wales, his majesty's mother, usually resides, during the winter season. It has a garden behind it, towards the park, and a large court before it, towards Pall-mall, and is now a very ele∣gant and commodious mansion, since its late im∣provements and alterations. In the same street, a commodious house has been built for his late royal
<PB N="193" REF="1970"/>
highness the duke of York, having a fine view into the park. Eighthly, St. James's palace. This palace, as we observed before, was built by Henry VIII. Before the dissolution it was an hospital for leprous maidens, to whom, upon their surrender of it, Henry granted pensions for life. It consists of several courts, and has one good range of state-rooms; though, upon the whole, it makes a very contemptible appearance as a royal palace. It has, however, a very neat chapel for the use of the royal family, which is exempted from all episcopal jurisdiction, and sub∣ject only to the dean, under whom, for the service of it, are a subdean, forty-eight chaplains, twelve gentlemen of the chapel, two organists, ten chil∣dren, a serjeant, a yeoman, and a groom of the vestry. There is also a lord-almoner, for the distribution of his majesty's alms. In this and the queen's palace the royal family now reside during the winter. Ninthly, the Queen's-palace. This was called Buck∣ingham-house, till it was purchased by his present majesty, and named the Queen's-palace. The situation is very agreeable, at the west end of St. James's-park, of which it has a full view from the front, and commands a prospect of the gardens and country behind. The gardens have been much enlarged since it was purchased, and several im∣provements and alterations made in the house, which is adorned with some good pictures. On the south side of the gardens a stately riding house hath been built for his majesty's use. The palace itself is a plain brick building in form of an oblong square, with a flat roof, and offices on each side, joined to the body of the house by open corri∣dores, betwixt which is a large area, with a bason in the middle, and a gate of iron curiously wrought towards the park, from which, on each side, runs a dwarf - wall, balustraded a-top with iron to the
<PB N="194" REF="1980"/>
offices. Tenthly, the queen's library, standing in the Upper St. James's-park, near the palace, was built and furnished with books by the late queen Caroline. Eleventhly, Northumberland-house, a noble antient palace, built round a quadrangle, with gardens and walks down to the Thames. It is very richly furnished, and adorned with many fine pictures. It belonged antiently to the Percys, earls of Northumberland; then to the duke of Somerset, upon his marrying the heiress of that family; and now to the duke of Northumberland, to which title, after that of earl, Sir Hugh Smithson hath been advanced since his marriage with the late duke of Somerset's eldest daughter. Besides these places, which are the most remarkable, there are, in this parish, several chapels, a work-house, play-house, tennis-court, alms-houses, cold-baths, bagnios, charity-schools, a part of Leicester square, and the Hay-market.</P>
<P>St. James's-parish, which was taken out of that of St. Martin's in the Fields. The most remarkable places in it are, first, the church, which cost seven thousand pounds, has a lofty steeple, and an arched roof, supported with pillars of the Corinthian or∣der, and adorned with fret - work. It was made parochial in the year 1685, since which time, as the audience is polite, and the revenue good, it hath had many eminent preachers. Secondly, St. James's-square, which is pretty large, has fine houses on all sides, inhabited mostly by the nobi∣lity, and is well paved, with a noble bason in the centre, surrounded with a pallisade. Thirdly, De∣vonshire-house in Piccadilly was formerly a noble house, built by Inigo Jones, in which the princess Ann resided before her accession; but that having been burnt down in 1733, the present magnifi∣cent house was erected in the room of it. Fourthly, Burlington-house is a very noble fabric, with a large area, or court, on each side of which are the offices,
<PB N="195" REF="1990"/>
and towards the street a high wall, having three gates, two lesser ones at each end, and a grand en∣trance in the middle. Fifthly, Berkeley-square, containing three acres, has been lately laid out and enclosed with iron rails in an elegant taste, and is surrounded with handsome houses; particularly, on the south-side, there is a most magnificient man∣sion belonging to lord Shelburne. Sixthly, At the bottom of the Hay-market on the west-side is the Opera-house; and on the other side of the street a little theatre, well contrived and deco∣rated for the representation of dramatic entertain∣ments. There are a great number of elegant houses in this parish belonging to persons of distinc∣tion, and several charity-schools, meeting-houses, markets, and chapels of ease.</P>
<P>St. George's, Hanover-square. In this parish, besides the church, a stately edifice, and one of the fifty new churches, the most remarkable places are the following: first, Hanover square, which, tho' not very large, is agreeable, having handsome houses all round, and an area of about two acres laid out in near gravel walks. Secondly, Caven∣dish-square, adorned with a number of elegant houses, near which is a handsome chapel erected by the duke of Portland. Thirdly, Grosvenor-square, having an area of five acres, in which is a pleasant garden, with an equestrian statue of king George I. finely gilt in the centre. In this parish are also the infirmary at Hyde-park corner, several chapels of ease, a work-house, a charity-school, and a market.</P>
<P>St. A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n's, Westminster. In this parish are Soho and a part of Leicester-squares. The former is well built, and has beautiful walks railed in, and planted with trees; in the midst of which is a fountain, and a statue of Charles II in armour. The latter takes up between two and three acres, the greatest part of which is inclosed, and laid out in pleasant walks, with an equestrian statue of
<PB N="196" REF="2000"/>
George II. gilt, in the centre. On the north side is Leicester-house, the residence of his present ma∣jesty when prince of Wales. In this parish live more French refugees, or their descendants, than in any other in England.</P>
<P>St. Paul's, Covent-Garden. That space now called Covent or Common-Garden was antiently a real garden belonging to the monks of West∣minster, and for that reason called Convent-Gar∣den. In 1552 it was given by Edward VI. to John, earl of Bedford, one of whose descendants built the church for the use of his tenants, which in 1645 was made parochial. It was designed by Inigo Jones, and tho' plain, is accounted elegant, having a noble portico on the east side, where the poll is taken for members for the city and liberty of Westminster. The square, on the west side of which the church stands, has a column in the middle, with sun-dials on all sides at the top, stately houses with arcades on the north and east, a fine play-house in the north-east corner, and in the area is kept a market, the best in Eng∣land, for all kinds of fruit, garden stuff, and green and dried herbs.</P>
<P>St. Mary le Strand, one of the fifty new churches, is not large, but very beautiful, tho' rather over∣charged with sculpture. On the west is a stately portico, with a dome, supported by several pillars. The parish, before the erection of the church, was in the precinct of the Savoy. The most remark∣able buildings are, first, Somerset-house, a palace built by the duke of Somerset, uncle to Edward VI. which consists of several courts, and, no doubt, was a magnificent structure for the times in which it was built, but makes no grand appearance now. Charles II. made a noble addition to it, which, with the back parts of the palace, command a beautiful view of the gardens and river. The gar∣dens are adorned with shady-walks, and there are
<PB N="197" REF="2010"/>
some statues both in it and about the house. As none of the royal family have resided here for a long time, officers belonging to the court, and others, are permitted to lodge in it. Secondly, the Savoy, which was antiently a house built by Peter earl of Savoy, from whom it derived its name. Afterwards there was a magnificent palace, be∣longing to the dukes of Lancaster, which was destroyed by Wat Tyler and his Kentish rebels. Henry VII. built and endowed an hospital in place of it, which Edward VI. suppressed, and gave the greater part of its revenues to his hospitals of Bride∣well, St. Thomas, and Christ-church: but queen Mary revived the former establishment, which was suppressed once more by queen Elizabeth, and the revenue restored to the hospitals. Here are now a great many private houses, a prison for deserters and other offenders, barracks for the guards and recruits, and chapels for the French and German protestants. It is a liberty of itself, independent of the dean and chapter of West∣minster, or rather a part of that now called the Dutchy Liberty, extending from Temple-Bar to Cecil-street in the Strand.</P>
<P>St. Clement's-Danes is said to have had the epi∣thet of Danes from a church, or caemetery, that antiently stood in it belonging to that nation. The church is one of the most beautiful in town, was designed by Sir Christopher Wren, and built at the expence of the parishioners in 1682. The most noted places in the parish are, first, Clement's∣inn, which has its name from the church, and is one of the inns of Chancery belonging to the Inner-Temple: it consists of a hall and several courts. Secondly, New-inn, belonging to the Mid∣dle-Temple, has a handsome little garden, and is well built. Thirdly, Lyon's-inn, which belongs to the Inner-Temple, and has been long in the
<PB N="198" REF="2020"/>
possession of the practitioners of the law. Fourth∣ly, Exeter-Exchange is a large building opposite the Savoy, where Exeter-house formerly stood. The upper floor is occupied chiefly as a ware∣house, and the lower, formerly by milliners, but now by glovers, dealers in toys, books, musical instruments, and prints. Fifthly, Clare-market, which had its name from the Newcastle family, its proprietors, and is well supplied with provisions of all sorts.</P>
<P>St. Martin's le Grand, tho' in the heart of the city of London, is, as we observed above, sub∣ject to that of Westminster, the deputy-steward of which holds a court in it weekly, and for whose members the inhabitants of the precinct vote.</P>
<P>We now proceed to describe the most remarkable places in the several parishes in the suburbs and without the liberties both of London and West∣minster, taking them as they lie from west to east.</P>
<P>St. Giles in the Fields. In antient times here was an hospital for lepers, founded by Maud, wife to Henry I. where, it is said, the prisoners going to Tyburn were presented with a bowl of ale, to refresh them before they were executed. The present church was built betwixt the years 1730 and 1734. The parish was very large, till St. George's Bloomsbury was taken out of it. It still contains one of the largest and handsomest squares in Europe, namely, Lincoln's-inn fields, in which the houses are very fine, especially on the west side, and the area has a large bason of water in the centre, and is surrounded with an iron pallisade on a dwarf-wall.</P>
<P>St. George's, Bloomsbury, was taken out of the parish of St. Giles, and its church, which stands south and north, and has the figure of George I. at the top of its lofty spire, is one of the fifty new ones. Here was antiently a village called Bloomsbury,
<PB N="199" REF="2030"/>
from which the parish and square derive their names. The square contains about three acres, and is very beautiful. In this parish is that mag∣nificent palace called Montague-house, which be∣longed to the late duke of Montague, but has been lately purchased by the parliament for a re∣pository of the Cottonian library, Harlean manu∣scripts, major Edward's library, and Sir Hans Sloane's immense and curious collection of books, manuscripts, and rarities, which are now the pro∣perty of the public, and called the British Mu∣seum. In consideration of its great utility, his majesty has also been graciously pleased to add thereto the libraries of books and manuscripts collected by the several kings of England. Sir Hans Sloane's collection cost twenty thousand pounds, lord Oxford's manuscripts ten thousand pounds, the house and gardens ten thousand pounds, and all other conveniences for placing the whole fifteen thousand pounds, besides a large sum placed in the funds to supply salaries for the officers, &amp;c. A catalogue of this noble Mu∣seum is written in thirty-eight volumes in folio and eight in quarto. Rules and statutes also, with respect to the use of it, have been drawn up by the trustees, and printed. A little to the east of the Museum is Bedford-house, a very elegant spacious structure, with its front to∣wards the square, from which it is separated by a noble wall and gates, inclosing a fine area. Be∣hind it has a beautiful garden, and a prospect of the fields. In this parish there is also a handsome mar∣ket, rebuilt some years ago by the duke of Bedford.</P>
<P>St. George's, Queen-square, was taken out of St. Andrew's, Holbourn, and its church is ano∣ther of the fifty new ones. The most remarkable places in it are, first, its square, which is a very fine one, but open on the north to the fields.
<PB N="200" REF="2040"/>
secondly, the hospital in Lamb's Conduit fields, for the maintenance of exposed and deserted young children, called the Foundling-hospital, which is a very large and magnificent structure. In this hospital a great number of exposed and deserted children are maintained and instructed; the boys being fitted for agriculture and the sea-service, and the girls for useful servants for such proper persons as may apply for them. By act of parlia∣ment, the males are not to continue in the house after they have attained the age of twenty-four, nor the females after twenty-one. Such as have not had the small-pox are inoculated at three years of age, in a proper place out of the hospital. For some time all were admitted that were brought, not exceeding two months old; but now only such as draw white balls. Thirdly, Powis-house, in Or∣mond-street, had its name from the last duke of Powis, by whom both it and the late duke of New∣castle's house in Lincoln's-inn-fields were built; but the present structure is said to have been erected at the expence of Lewis XIV. of France, the former having been burnt down while his am∣bassador resided in it. Fourthly, Red-lion-square, which is small, but very neat, with an obelisk in the centre. Besides these places, in this neigh∣bourhood are two conduits, called the Devil's and Lambs Conduits; the former of which supplies Christ's-hospital with water, St. John's-church, as it is called, tho' it is no more than a chapel of ease to St. Andrew's Holborn, and the two great inns of court called Gray's and Lincoln's-inns.</P>
<P>Gray's-inn is in the parish of St. Andrew's Hol∣born, but not within the liberties of the city, and therefore was not mentioned in our descrip∣tion of the most remarkable places in it. It an∣tiently belonged to the family of the Grays of Wilton, whence it had its name; afterwards
<PB N="201" REF="2050"/>
to the students of the law, and since then to the monks of Shene near Richmond, who leased it to the society for a small rent, which has been paid to the crown since the dissolution, when Henry VIII. granted it in fee-farm to the society upon that condition. It consists of several courts, inhabited by barristers and students of the law, and also by such gentlemen of independent fortunes, as chuse this place for the sake of an agreeeable re∣tirement, or the pleasure of the walks, which is likewise the case of most of the other inns of court. Here is a large hall, a chapel, and a library, well furnished with law and other books. Behind it is a very noble garden, with gravel and terras∣walks, well planted and shaded with trees. The society can boast of having in the list of its mem∣bers those two eminent men, Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord-keeper of the great-seal, and Sir Francis, lord Verulam, and lord-high-chancellor of Eng∣land; the latter of whom was more elevated above other men by his genius, learning, and know∣ledge of nature, than by his rank and office. The members of the house are to be in commons a fortnight every term, for which they pay sixteen shillings. The other great inn, viz. Lincoln's, is partly in the parish of St. Giles's, partly in that of St. Clement's, and partly in the liberty of the Rolls. It is very large, consisting of several courts, which have been erected at different periods of time. The chapel is very beautiful, and much admired for its painted windows. On the north∣side are gardens, in which is a fine terras extend∣ing the whole length of the garden, and com∣manding a prospect of Lincoln's-inn fields, besides walks shaded with trees, and embellished with fountains and statues. The charge of admission into this house, including fees, amounts to five pounds, and every student after studying there
<PB N="202" REF="2060"/>
seven years, is admitted to the bar. The mem∣bers are obliged to be a fortnight in commons every term.</P>
<P>St. James's, Clerkenwell. The church of this parish is part of one that belonged to a priory which stood here antiently. It had the epithet of Clerkenwell from the parish clerks of London coming hither formerly, once a-year, to represent portions of scripture, in the dramatic way, before the lord-mayor, aldermen, and some of the nobi∣lity, at a noted fountain near the lower end of the green. Near this, where now is St. John's-square, was formerly an hospital belonging to the knights of St. John of Jerusalem, or Knights-Hospitallers, so called from their having an hospital at Jerusalem for the accommodation of pilgrims, and other Christians. This was their chief seat in England. Both they, and the Knights-Templars, tho' ori∣ginally poor and humble, flourished to such a degree, that the former had nineteen thousand lordships in Christendom, and the latter nine thousand; the prior of the former being reckoned the first baron of Eng∣land. The yearly revenues of their hospitals at the dissolution amounted to three thousand four hun∣dred pounds; a sum equal to five times as much now. In this parish is Hicks's-hall, which had its name from Sir Baptist Hicks, a mercer and justice of the peace, who built it at his own expence, and in which are held the sessions of the justices of the peace for Middlesex. Here also the grand-jury meet eight times a-year, to find the bills of indict∣ment on which criminals are afterwards tried at the Old-Bailey. As the water-works of the New-River company are in this parish, it will not be improper to give a brief account of that great undertaking, for supplying the city with good and wholesome water. It was first set on foot by the citizens of London in the reign of James I. but
<PB N="203" REF="2070"/>
they growing weary of it, in consequence of the expence, it was next undertaken by Sir Hugh Middleton, assisted by the king, who cut a canal, from Ware to Islington, for forty miles, bringing it over vallies in some places, and thro' mountains in others. King Charles I. relinquished his moiety to Sir Hugh, upon condition that five hundred pounds a-year, fee-farm rent, should be paid out of the future profits to the crown. The stock and profits were divided into seventy-two shares, each of which is valued at above five thousand guineas, the number of houses supplied by it with water being now very great, and continually increasing. The proprietors were incorporated by James I. and the affairs of the company are managed by a governor, deputy-governor, treasurer, and twen∣ty-six directors, who have under them several clerks, collectors, paviours, turncocks, pipe-borers, besides surveyors to see the river scoured once a-year, and fourteen walkers between Ware and London, to see that no damage be done to it, nor any thing thrown in to infect the water. Be∣sides the great pleasure, convenience, health, and cleanliness private families derive from this un∣dertaking, the advantage of a supply of water in every street, for extinguishing fires, is apparent to every one. Likewise in this parish is the noble hospital, called the Charter-house, because it was antiently a monastery belonging to the Chartreux, or Carthusians. After the dissolution, it passed thro' several hands, till at last in the reign of James I. it was purchased of the earl of Suffolk by Thomas Sutton, of Castle-Camps, in the coun∣ty of Cambridge, who converted it into an hos∣pital, which he liberally endowed, for the main∣tenance of eighty poor brothers, who are to be decayed gentlemen or merchants, or superannuated soldiers by sea or land, not under fifty years of
<PB N="204" REF="2080"/>
age; but soldiers maimed in the wars may, in regard of their misfortune, be admitted ten years sooner. All these, besides a gown each, diet, and lodging, are allowed seven pounds a-year. He further endowed it for the maintenance and education of forty boys, now increased to forty-four, in consequence of the improvement of the rents. These are admitted between the years of ten and fifteen, and continue in the hospital eight; at the expiration of which, those that have a capa∣city for learning are transplanted to the universities, where twenty nine now are constantly maintained, with an allowance of twenty pounds per annum for eight years, after which many of them are provided for in the church, there being nine livings in the gift of the governors, to which they have the preference. Those of a less promising genius in classical learning are put out appren∣tices, and the house gives forty pounds with each. The governors are the king, archbishop of Canterbury, two bishops, twelve noblemen, of whom the king presents two both of the pen∣sioners and scholars, and the rest one each in their turns. Under these are a master or governor, a preacher, two schoolmasters, a physician, regis∣ter, receiver, treasurer, manciple, steward, and auditor, liberally provided for in the house. The purchase of the house cost Mr. Sutton thirteen thousand pounds; the building and fitting up of the hospital seven thousand pounds more; and the rents of the fifteen manors, and other lands, with which he endowed it, amounted at first to four thousand five hundred pounds, and now to upwards of six thousand pounds per annum. He lies bu∣ried in the chapel under a magnificent monument of white and black marble, which cost fifteen hun∣dred pounds. Besides the money and estates ex∣pended upon, and left to the hospital, he be∣queathed
<PB N="205" REF="2090"/>
fifteen thousand pounds in legacies to his relations and friends.</P>
<P>St. Luke's parish was taken out of St. Giles's Cripplegate, and the church is one of the fifty new ones. The places worth our no∣tice in it are these; first, the Artillery-ground. This is a field to the north of Chiswell-street, for the Artillery company, and trained bands of Lon∣don to perform their exercises in, with a building in the middle for a magazine of arms. Secondly, Old-street, a part of the Roman military way, that went by London from the west to the eastern part of the kingdom. Thirdly, Tindal's, or the Dissenters burying ground, so called be∣cause one Tindal took a lease of the ground, and converted it into a burial-place for the dissenters. Fourth, Mountmill, at the end of Goswell-street, was one of the forts erected by the parlia∣ment in 1643, for the defence of London. It was afterwards called the Mount, and upon a wind-mill being erected upon it, Mount-mill. Fifth, Playhouse-yard, between Whitecross-street and Golden-lane. Here was antiently a play-house, and, as it appears, another in Barbican; nor is this to be wondered at, as many of the no∣bility formerly lived hereabouts. By the pest-house, in this parish, is an hospital in which above two hundred poor French protestants are main∣tained, one half of them and more by the revenue of the house, and the rest by their friends at nine pounds a year each: the governors of it are in∣corporated. Near this is St. Luke's hospital for lunatics, which we have mentioned before. In this parish are also several alms houses, a free∣school, the city common-hunt house, and a ken∣nel for hounds.</P>
<P>St. Leonard's Shoreditch. This is a very large parish, which took its name, not from Jane Shore,
<PB N="206" REF="2100"/>
concubine to Edward IV. but from Sir John Sord, or Soreditch, lord of the manor in the reign of Edward III. The foundation of the present church, which is very beautiful, and has a very lofty steeple, was laid in the year 1736. The places of chief note in the parish are these; first, Aske's hospital, in the hamlet of Hoxton, built by the company of haberdashers, execu∣tors of Robert Aske, esquire, one of their mem∣bers, who left them thirty thousand pounds for that purpose, and for the relief of twenty poor men, members of the company, who must be single, and have each three pounds a year, lodg∣ing, firing, diet, and a gown once in two years. He further ordained, that twenty boys, the sons of decayed freemen of the company, should be educated and maintained. Their master has forty pounds and a house, and reads prayers twice a day. The building, which has more the air of a palace than an alms-house, cost twelve thousand pounds. Secondly, Ironmongers-hospital, or Jef∣fries alms-houses. This hospital stands in Kings∣land road, a little out of town, and is an excellent model for an alms house, being only two stories high, of brick, without ornament, but neat, and the chapel in the middle. In it, erected by the ironmongers in 1713, pursuant to the will of Sir Robert Jeffries, who was a member of that com∣pany, and lord-mayor of London, fifty-six poor men of the same company, not under fifty-six years of age, have a room, part of a cellar, six pounds a year, and a gown. If any of them have a wife, she may live with him, and if she survives him, be chosen in his room. Thirdly, the Weavers-alms-houses in Old-street, in which twelve weavers wi∣dows have each twenty-four bushels of coals, twenty shillings a year, and a gown every se∣cond year. Fourthly, Fuller's alms-houses,
<PB N="207" REF="2110"/>
in which twelve poor widows of Shoreditch parish have four pounds a year and a sack of coals. Fifthly, Walter's alms houses in the same street. In these, eight poor widows have five shillings a month each, and half a chaldron of coals yearly. Sixthly, Badger's alms-houses at Hox∣ton, in which six poor men have twenty shillings a year for themselves and wives. Seventhly, Burn's alms-houses in Kingsland-road, consisting of twelve rooms, in each of which a poor freeman of the frame-work-knitters company, or his widow, has his proportion of eighty pounds a year. Har∣war's alms-houses in the same road, in which twelve single men and women, put in one half by the drapers company, and the other by the parish of Shoreditch, have six shillings a month, and half a chaldron of coals each yearly. In Norton-Falgate liberty, which belongs to the dean and chapter of St. Paul's, and lies between Bi∣shopsgate-street-bars and Shoreditch, is an alms-house, in which six poor members of the weavers company, have each eight pounds, a chaldron of coals, and a dozen and half of candles yearly.</P>
<P>The parish of Christ-church, Spitalfields. The church is one of the fifty new ones, and is reckoned one of the most magnificent parish churches in Lon∣don. The inhabitants, of which the greater part are French, or of French extraction, are employed chiefly in the silk manufacture. The parish was taken out of St. Dunstan's Stepney. From the urns with ashes, human bones, and other Roman antiquities, that have been dug up here, these fields would seem to have been a burial-place of the Romans. They were afterwards called Lolles∣worth-fields, as we learn from Stow, and after that Spitalfields, from St. Mary's Spital, in the neighbourhood. The French have a charity∣school in these fields, in which all the poor chil∣dren
<PB N="208" REF="2120"/>
of that nation are taught to read, write, and cypher gratis, at certain hours of the day, and two alms-houses, in one of which near three hun∣dred poor families have a pan of broth, half a pound of meat, and a pound of bread, from two to six times a week, according to their circum∣stances; the charity requires five hundred a year to support it. In the other, forty-five poor men and women have two shillings and three pence, and a bushel of coals a week, and apparel every other year. In an alms-house belonging to the dyers, near Spitalfields, six poor widows have thirty shillings a year.</P>
<P>St. Mary's Whitechapel. The church of this parish was so called, as it is thought, from its be∣ing formerly a chapel of ease to Stepney, and the whiteness of its walls. In Wellclose, or Marine square, in this parish, is the Danish chapel, and in Rosemary-lane is Rag-fair, in which old cloaths, to a great amount, are bought and sold. Besides these, there is a market for hay, and carcases of sheep; and not many ago was a playhouse in Goodman's-fields, for the amusement of the inha∣bitants of Wapping and its environs. To con∣clude, there are also two free-schools, two alms-houses, a court of record, a prison, work-house, and cold bath.</P>
<P>St. Catharine's by the Tower. This parish is chiefly remarkable for an hospital and chantry founded in the popish times with great privileges and immunities; the former by Maud, wife of king Stephen, but endowed and augmented by Eleanor, relict of Henry III. and Eleanor, wife of Edward I. for a master, three brethren, chap∣lains, six poor clerks, and ten poor women; the latter by Philippa, wife to Edward III. The master delivered up the charter to queen Eliza∣beth, to be cancelled; but she granted them an∣other,
<PB N="209" REF="2130"/>
by which most of their privileges and re∣venues were continued to them. In consequence of this there is still a master, but he is not an eccle∣siastic as formerly; three brethren, usually some eminent clergymen, who preach by turns; three sisters, and ten beadswomen, among whom the endowment is divided. The precinct is still a dis∣tinct liberty, having its proper judge, court, and prison; and without an order from the board of Green-cloth, no person can be arrested in it. The church is subject to the bishop of London. In this parish is a place called Hangman's-gains, which is a strange corruption of Hammes and Guisnes, the names of two towns in Picardy, whence, upon their being taken by the French, many of the inhabitants came and settled here.</P>
<P>St. John's, Wapping, was taken out of St. Mary's, White-chapel. It is inhabited chiefly by sea-faring people, or such as deal in naval stores. It can claim a third of all the gifts and legacies left to St. Mary's, White-chapel, and also of the rents of the houses belonging to that parish, with a sixth of the money collected at the sacrament. In this parish is Execution-dock, where pirates are executed, another dock, and a yard for ship∣building.</P>
<P>St. Paul's, Shadwell, was taken out of Stepney, deriving its name from a spring under the south-wall of the church. In Sun-tavern-fields, where gra∣vel, which is now taken out of the river, used formerly to be dug for ballast, and conveyed thro' the lanes, still from thence called Old and New-gravel-lanes, coffins and urns, &amp;c. were found in 1615: whence, it is supposed, there was for∣merly a Roman caemetery. In this parish is also a medicinal-spring, and a dock for building ships.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="2140"/>
St. George's in the East is one of the fifty new churches, and the parish was formerly a part of that of Stepney. The most remarkable founda∣tion in it is Raine's hospital in Fowden-fields. Forty-eight girls, taken out of the parish-school, which was also endowed by Mr. Raine with a per∣petual annuity of sixty pounds, are taught to read, write, sew, and housewifry, and after being three years upon the foundation, are put out appren∣tices. For these purposes he endowed the hospital with a perpetual annuity of two hundred and forty pounds, besides four thousand four hundred pounds South-sea annuities, to be laid out in a purchase.</P>
<P>St. Ann's, Limehouse, is one of the fifty new churches, said to have had its name from the limes that formerly grew thereabouts. In the parish are two docks for ship-building; and the inhabitants, both of it and the two last mentioned parishes, are chiefly sea-faring people and their dependants.</P>
<P>St. Dunstan's, Stepney. Tho' several parishes, as we have already observed, have been taken out of this, it is still very large, and contains most of the Tower-hamlets, viz. Bednal-green, Mile-end, Poplar, and Ratcliff, besides the village of Step∣ney. There are none of these without one or two alms-houses; but at Mile-end are many, as the drapers, skinners, vintners, judge Fuller's, Fish∣er's, Bancroft's, and the Trinity-house; of which, the two last merit a more particular description. In Bancroft's alms-house, which was erected in 1735 by the drapers company, in pursuance of the will of Francis Bancroft, who had been one of the lord-mayor's officers, and left twenty-seven thou∣sand pounds in trust to the above company, for building and endowing it, twenty-four poor alms∣men have eight pounds a-piece, and half a chal∣dron of coals yearly, with a gown of bays every
<PB N="211" REF="2150"/>
third year; and one hundred poor boys are cloath∣ed and taught, with four pounds to bind them ap∣prentices; but if they go to service, they have only two pounds ten shillings to buy cloaths. The two school-masters have thirty pounds a year and a house each: besides what is allowed for books, paper, pens, and ink, twenty pounds a-year are allotted to supply the master and school with coals and candles. Both alms-men and boys are obliged to be present at two sermons, for which he left money, to be preached at St. Helen's or St. Michael's, Cornhill. Trinity-hospital, a very beautiful building, was erected in 1695 by the corporation of the Trinity, consisting of a master, four wardens, eight assistants, eighteen elder brethren, and an unlimited number of younger brethren, for twenty-eight decayed or antient seamen, or their widows, who have sixteen shil∣lings every month, twenty shillings a-year for coals, and a gown every second year. Besides this, arising from the money of the ballast-office, light-houses, buoys, beacons, &amp;c. belonging to them by act of parliament, the benefactions of well disposed persons, estates purchased or received, they an∣nually afford relief to at least three thousand poor mariners, their widows, or orphans. They had their first charter from Henry VIII. which has been several times confirmed and extended since. Their powers and privileges are, 1st, To examine the masters of his majesty's ships. 2d, To lay five pounds fine upon aliens who serve aboard mer∣chants ships without their license, and to punish seamen for mutiny and desertion in the merchants service. 3d, To appoint pilots for conducting ships in and out of the Thames, and to lay fifty pounds fine upon them and the masters, who act without being authorized by them. 4th, To set∣tle the rates of pilotage, and erect light-houses and
<PB N="212" REF="2160"/>
sea-marks on the coast. 5th, To license poor sea∣men, not freemen, to row on the Thames for their support, when their service is not wanted at sea. 6th, To hear and determine the complaints of officers and seamen in the merchants service; but an appeal lies from their decrees to the court of admiralty. 7th, In consideration of the increase of their poor, to purchase estates in mortmain to the amount of five hundred pounds, and to receive the benefactions of well disposed persons to the like amount clear of reprizes. Every master or mate, who is expert in navigation, may be ad∣mitted into the fraternity as a younger brother. The hamlet of Poplar in this parish is so called from the trees of that kind, with which it formerly abounded. That called Poplar-marsh, or the Isle of Dogs, from the hounds kept in it when the court resided at Greenwich, is reckoned the richest pasture in England, and the sheep and cattle fed there the largest. It is not in reality an island, but a peninsula, being joined to the land on the north-side. Blackwall, in this parish, contains several yards and docks, and a safe harbour for the largest ships. Ratcliff is said to take its name from a red cliff that was antiently there. In this parish is a German and Portuguese-Jews burial-ground, and an annual fair at Mile end. In each of the hamlets is a chapel of ease to the mother-church at Stepney, and dissenters meeting-houses all over the parish.</P>
<P>St. John's, Hackney, contains, besides the village properly called Hackney, the hamlets of Dalston and Shakelwell on the west, Clapton on the north, and Hummerton on the east, which are inhabited mostly by merchants and citizens of London.</P>
<P>St. Mary's, Islington. This parish, besides Islington, comprehends the Upper and Lower
<PB N="213" REF="2170"/>
Holloways, three sides of Newington-Green, and part of Kingsland, The church, which was not many years ago rebuilt, is a prebend of St. Paul's, but subject in ecclesiastical matters to the archdeacon of London. In this parish is Canonbury-house, on a beautiful eminence, once the mansion-house of a manor belonging to the canons of St. Bartho∣lomew, in Smithfield, but now divided into tene∣ments, and let out, many people from London taking lodgings in it, on account of its fine situa∣tion, air, and prospect. On the west side of Isling∣ton is that noble reservoir, whence the water, con∣veyed by the channel already mentioned from Ware in Hertfordshire, is received, and from which, and another reservoir a little higher, it is distributed by pipes all over the town. In a field beyond the White-conduit-house, called Six-acre-field, are the remains of a Roman camp, supposed to be made by the Roman general Suetonius, after he quitted London, and before he defeated the Britons un∣der Boadicea. Near Islington also is a spring of chalybeate-water, called New Tunbridge-wells, for drinking of which each person pays three-pence; and a house of entertainment, called Sadler's-wells, where during the summer season people are amused with rope-dancing, tumbling, pantomime enter∣tainments, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Having now given a brief account of every thing remarkable in the cities of London and West∣minster, and the parishes which may not improper∣ly be called their suburbs, we next proceed to take a view of the most remarkable places in the rest of the county.</P>
<P>St. Mary-le-Bonne, or rather Borne, took its name from a church built here in the fifteenth century, in place of one at Tyburn, and dedicated to the Virgin-Mary, with the epither of Borne, from a bourn or brook near it. The city was for∣merly
<PB N="214" REF="2180"/>
supplied with water from this brook by nine conduits; but in 1703, when it was plentifully supplied with better from the New-River, this was demised for seven hundred pounds a-year, for the term of forty-three years. Over the cisterns, at the foot of the bridge, was formerly a banquet-house, in which the lord-mayor and aldermen, and their ladies, used to have entertainments; but it was taken down in 1737. Tho' antiently there was a manor, village, and church, that bore the name of Tyburn, yet the only place that retains it at present is the spot where the felons are exe∣cuted. This village is now almost joined to the metropolis, by the new buildings on that side. Here is a place of public entertainment, with a pleasant garden, and a band of vocal and instru∣mental music, in imitation of Vauxhall. At a little distance, towards the north, lies Paddington, a pretty little rural village.</P>
<P>Hampstead, a village, lying to the north-east of the former, upon the brow of a hill, whence there is a most delightful prospect of London, the Thames, and the country along its banks on both sides. The heath has something very wild and agreeable. Here is a fine assembly and long-room; and not many years ago a very handsome chapel was erected by the contributions of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Highgate. This village has its name from an high gate, where toll was paid to the bishop of London, when the road from Gray's-inn to Bar∣net was turned thro' his lands. In the neighbour∣ing parish of Hornsey, to which, and that of Pancras, the church of Highgate is only a chapel of ease, at a place called Muswell-hill, from a well there, was a chapel in the popish times, stiled Our Lady of Muswell, much visited by the super∣stitious, in consequence of some miraculous cures pretended to be wrought by the water.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="2190"/>
Kensington. Here is a palace, which was pur∣chased of the earl of Nottingham by king Wil∣liam, and, with its gardens, hath been greatly improved since by queen Anne and queen Caro∣line. This palace has some elegant apartments, richly furnished, and adorned with original paint∣ings. The gardens are very large, and laid out with excellent taste, as displaying every where a noble simplicity and grandeur. The grand bason of water in the centre, and the Serpentine river, are great ornaments. The spacious walks and lawns greatly contribute likewise to its embellish∣ment. The air of the gravel-pits in the neigh∣bourhood is much extolled; and so is the situa∣tion of Holland-house, a little to the west of it. On the south side of it lies Hyde-park, of great extent, and very beautiful, being planted with a vast number and variety of tall stately trees, finely disposed and adorned with a grand piece of water in the centre, called the Serpentine-river, a reservoir near Grosvenor-gate, a grove towards the top, some fine springs, and herds of deer. The nobility and gentry take the air here on horseback, or in coaches; and in the summer sea∣son there are frequent reviews, at which his ma∣jesty is often present. At the corner of it, next Westminster, is St. George's-hospital, for the sick and lame, which was first opened in 1734. It has about three hundred governors, is supported by voluntary subscriptions, and so well managed and attended, that it is a very useful charity.</P>
<P>Chelsea is a pleasant and populous village upon the banks of the Thames, inhabited mostly by Londoners who have retired from business; but it is chiefly noted for three particulars: 1st, Its hospital for lame, sick, and superannuated sol∣diers. 2d, The apothecaries physic - garden. 3d, Its porcelain manufacture. The hospital was
<PB N="216" REF="2200"/>
begun by Charles II. continued by James II. and finished by William and Mary. The building consists of three sides of a quadrangle, in which are apartments for betwixt four and five hundred soldiers, officers civil and military, and servants, with a chapel, hall, &amp;c. The pensioners wear an uniform of red, lined with blue, and are provided with washing, firing, diet, and lodging, and a day's pay every week. The out-pensioners some∣times amount to ten thousand, having each four∣pence a-day for their maintenance. To defray the charge of all these, the army pays poundage, and a day's pay is stopped out from every officer and soldier yearly. The apothecaries - garden contains all the different species of medicinal plants hitherto discovered, with a building, in which is a greenhouse, apartments for the meeting of the company, and others for drying seeds and plants, under the care of the celebrated Mr. Miller, the first of his profession in Europe. The porcelain manufacture was carried on to great perfection at Chelsea, but at present it seems at a stand. Near this village is Ranelagh-house, an elegant rotun∣da, erected for the entertainment of the public, with music and singing. On one side is the orchestra, and there are forty-eight boxes round it in a dou∣ble row. It is so spacious, so finely illuminated, painted, and gilded, and when filled, exhibits such a number of gentlemen and ladies in rich and splendid dresses, that a spectator is struck in an ex∣traordinary manner upon his first entering it, and apt to fancy himself in an enchanted palace. The gardens are laid out in gravel walks, having a canal and bason, and are illuminated with a great num∣ber of lamps.</P>

Hammersmith is a pretty neat village, four miles from London, on the banks of the Thames, and he great western-road.</P>
<P>East and West Acton are two villages which have their names from the oaks that grew about them formerly. At East-Acton are medicinal springs, which were formerly much frequented. The latter has nothing remarkable in it unless it be the church.</P>
<P>Fulham has a wooden bridge over the Thames to Putney, at which not only horses and carriages, but also foot passengers pay toll. In this village is a palace belonging to the bishop of London.</P>
<P>Cheswic, or Chiswic, stands pleasantly on the Thames, six miles from Hyde-park corner. It is chiefly noted for a small house belonging to the late earl of Burlington, an elegant piece of archi∣tecture, seemingly built as the model of a larger palace. It is decorated with some valuable paint∣ings, and the gardens are very agreeably laid out, and ornamented with busts and statues.</P>
<P>Great and Little Ealing form one of the plea∣santest villages in the county. Among the many fine seats in the parish, the chief is Gunnersbury-house, lately purchased by the princess Amelia. It stands on an eminence between the two great western roads, and was built by Mr. Webb, son-in-law to the celebrated Inigo Jones. From a portico in the back front of the house, there is a most delightful prospect of London, Surry, and both banks of the Thames for several miles.</P>
<P>Brentford has its name from the little river Brent, on which it is situated, near where it falls into the Thames. Standing close to the Thames, it sends a great deal of corn to London by water, and some by land. It is also a great thoroughfare on the western road. In a place on the north-side, called the Butts, the poll for knights of the shire
<PB N="218" REF="2220"/>
is always taken. Patrick Ruthven, a Scotsman, and earl of Forth, had the title of earl of this town bestowed upon him, for his gallant behaviour in an action near it in the civil wars. On the west side, by the Thames, stands Sion-house a very noble seat of the duke of Northumberland's. It had its name from a nunnery erected by Hen. V. and called Sion, from the holy mount of that name. In the neighbourhood is also Osterley-house, built by Sir Thomas Gresham, founder of the Royal-Exchange, and afterwards was the sea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Sir William Waller, the parliament-general, and of Dr. Barebones.</P>
<P>Uxbridge is noted for the treaty between king Charles I. and the parliament, and is a great tho∣roughfare on the Oxford-road. Tho' in the parish of great Hillingdon, it has magistrates of its own, namely, two bailiffs, two constables, and four tything-men, or head-boroughs. It gives title of earl to the family of Paget, and drives a considera∣ble trade in meal sent to London.</P>
<P>Hampton-Court. Here is a palace pleasantly situ∣ated on the Thames between two parks, and has fine gardens. It was built by cardinal Wolsey, with all the magnificence known in that age; and afterwards so much enlarged and embellished by Henry VIII. that Grotius says, A traveller, after having seen all the most magnificent palaces in the world, upon the sight of this, would be apt to exclaim, <HI>Ibi reges, hic habitare deos:</HI> i. e. That princes there, but here the gods did dwell. Not only the palace, but also the parks and gardens have been greatly improved since by Charles I. Oliver Cromwell, who made it his summer resi∣dence, and in particular by king William and Mary, queen Anne, and George I. yet it is now again neglected, his present majesty having made choice of Richmond for his summer-retreat. Those
<PB N="219" REF="2230"/>
fine inimitable pieces of Raphael Urbin, called the Cartoons, that were brought hither by king William, have been lately removed to the queen's palace at Westminster. For these Carroons the late French king is said to have offered one hun∣dred thousand pounds. It is not saying too much, when we affirm that the palace, parks, and gardens, have every embellishment that can serve to render them inchanting and delightful. The village, from which the palace takes its name, is pretty well built, and agreeable.</P>
<P>Staines is pleasantly situated upon the Thames, and derives its name from a stone that was antient∣ly set up here, to mark the extent of the city of London's jurisdiction upon the river. It is a pretty good town, has a wooden bridge over the river, and is governed by two constables and four head∣boroughs, appointed by the king's steward, be∣cause the honour or manor belongs to the crown.</P>
<P>Harrow on the Hill, which standing high, the church upon it, with its lofty steeple, is seen at a great distance. Here is a celebrated school, in which great numbers of young gentle∣men are educated. The fields about the village of Heston, in this neighbourhood, are noted for the excellent wheat they produce.</P>
<P>Edgeware is a market-town, consisting chiefly of one street. The old Roman military way, called Watling-street, passes by this town over Hamp∣stead-heath to Verulam or St. Alban's.</P>
<P>Hounslow lies on the western road, and is chief∣ly noted for its grand inns and heath, over which the Roman highway passes, where numberless rob∣beries have been, and still are committed.</P>
<P>Twickenham is a delightful village on the banks of the Thames, opposite to Richmond in Surry, remarkable for a great number of elegant country houses belonging to the nobility and gentry, but

chiefly noted for having been the residence of the celebrated poet Mr. Alexander Pope.</P>
<P>Enfield is a very pretty market-town, stands close to the chace on the east side, and is almost surrounded by the New-river. Its name was ori∣ginally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nfin or Infin, from its situation in fenny or moorish ground; but now, instead of fens, there are fine corn-fields all around, except where the chace lies. Over against the church is a large old house, said to have been a royal palace in queen Elizabeth's time. The chace, which is a part of the dutchy of Lancaster, and has been an∣nexed to it ever since Henry IV. married a daugh∣ter and coheir of the last of the Bohuns, is of great extent, over-run with trees and thickets, and has a good lodge for the ranger. When king James I. who took great delight in hunting, resided at Theo∣balds in the neighbourhood, it was full of game, deer, and timber; but it has undergone great changes since that time.</P>
<P>Southgate. At the south-gate of the chace is a very beautiful village, called from thence South-gate. It stands on a rising ground, and enjoys a remarkably fine air.</P>
<P>Tottenham stands on one of the great northern roads. In this place is a cross, once very high, and thence called Tottenham-high-cross. It is supposed to have been built in consequence of an order of the church of Rome, to erect crosses in the most frequented places of every parish, and to have been only repaired, embellished, or raised higher by Edward I. when the corpse of his queen rested here, in its way to London. Betwixt Tot∣tenham and London, upon the same road, lies Stoke-Newington, a large handsome village.</P>
<P>Bromley and Bow by Stratford are villages seated on the confines of the county towards Essex. The first had its name from the broom that formerly
<PB N="221" REF="2250"/>
grew about it, and had antiently a monastery, on the side of which now stands the manor-house, called Bromley-hall. The church is the lord of the manor's donative, and the parish very small. The other village has its name from the arches of the bridge built over the Lea by order of Maud, wife to Henry I. and daughter of Mal∣colm Canmore, king of Scotland, who had been in danger of being drowned as she passed the river at Oldford in the neighbourhood. It is noted for dying scarlet; and the church, which was before a chapel of ease to Stepney, has been many years made parochial. There are several other villages in this county, as Isleworth, Edmonton, Parson's∣green, Finchley, &amp;c. some of which, tho' only called villages, are equal to large towns <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Besides the charitable foundations already described, there are some others in and a∣bout London lately established, which we shall just mention here, not having room to de∣scribe them particularly: these are the London - hospital in Whitechapel-road, the Magda∣len-house for the reception of penitent prostitutes, in Good-man's-fields, the Lying-in-hospital Aldersgate - street, the Small-pox hospital near Pancras, the Middlesex-hospi∣tal in Marybone - fields, the Lying-in-hospital in Brown∣low - street, Long - acre, and the Lock-hospital, Hyde-park∣corner.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the west by Berk∣shire and Hampshire, on the south by Sussex, on
<PB N="224" REF="2280"/>
the east by Kent, on the north by Middlesex, from which it is parted by the Thames, whence it had the name of Suth-rey, from the Saxons, i. e. the country on the south side the river. It is thirty-four miles in length from east to west, twenty-one in breadth from north to south, and one hundred and twelve in circumference. It contains thirteen hundreds, one hundred and forty parishes, of which thirty-five are vicarages, eleven market-towns, four hundred and fifty villages, five hun∣dred and ninety-two thousand acres, and about one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants. The members sent from it to parliament are fourteen, of which two are sent by each of the following boroughs, viz. Southwark, Bleechingley, Rye∣gate, Guildford, Gatton, Haslemere, which we shall describe in order, and two for the county.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county towards the middle, con∣sisting mostly of hills and heath, is sharp, but pure and wholesome. About the skirts, where it is more level, and the soil richer, the air is milder, but still salubrious. In the middle parts the soil is barren enough in general; but towards the ex∣tremities, and where the country is open and champaign, it is fruitful in grass and corn, parti∣cularly on the south-side in Holmsdale, in which meadows, woods, and corn-fields, are agreeably intermixed. The soil is also very fertile along the Thames, especially towards London, where it greatly contributes to maintain plenty in the Lon∣don markets. It has several rivers, abounding with fish, the chief of which are the Wye, the Mole, and the Wandle. The first of these is of great benefit to the county, being navigable from Weybridge to the Thames, and thereby supply∣ing
<PB N="225" REF="2290"/>
many parts of it with necessaries of all sorts. The Mole is so called, because it runs about two miles under ground, entering at a place named the Swallows, at the bottom of Boxhill, and emerging again, as is commonly thought, at Leatherhead. The chief articles of commerce produced in the county are corn, boxwood, wal∣nuts, and fullers-earth, which is sold at a groat a bushel.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Southwark had its name from its situation in respect of London, from which it is separated only by the bridge. It contains six parishes, viz. St. Olave, St. John at Horsleydown, St. Saviour, vulgarly called St. Mary Overey, St. George, St. Thomas, and Christ-church. The other parishes in the bills of mortality in Surrey are, St. Mary's, at Lambeth, St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey, St. Mary's, Newington, and St. Mary's, Rother∣hithe. All these lie along the river, from Vaux∣hall to Deptford, for the space of about seven miles. The Borough, as it is commonly called, in wealth, populousness, and extent, is inferior to few cities. It was purchased of king Edward VI. for six hundred and forty-seven pounds, two shillings, and one penny, by the mayor, commonalty, and citizens of London, and immediately erected into a ward, under the name of Bridgward without; of consequence, its inhabitants became intitled to all the laws and privileges of the city of London, and the lord-mayor of London to the authority and rights of a justice of peace and escheator within the borough and precincts. It is governed, under the lord mayor and aldermen of the ward, by a steward and bailiff. But besides the pur∣chase-money mentioned above, a further sum of five hundred marks was afterwards paid by the city
<PB N="226" REF="2300"/>
to the crown, in consideration of the grant. It had formerly a noble monastery of Benedictines, called Bermondsey, besides a priory, and two palaces, one built by Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, and another belonging to the bishops of Winches∣ter. It is divided into two parts, the Borough-li∣berty, and the clink or manor of Southwark. In each of these is a court of record for debts, dama∣ges, and trespasses. In that for the Borough-li∣berty, the lord-mayor's steward is judge, the li∣berty being under his jurisdiction. In that for the clink, the bishop of Winchester's steward and bailiff are judges, it being under the jurisdiction of that see. In both divisions are also held court∣leets, and to each there belongs a prison. As to the military government of Southwark, there is a lord-lieutenant, and eleven deputy-lieutenants, who have under them a regiment of six companies of one hundred and fifty men each.</P>
<P>We shall now just mention the most remarka∣ble places in the several parishes abovemention∣ed, beginning with</P>
<P>St. Saviour's. The church of this parish, vul∣garly called St. Mary Overy, from its dedication to the virgin Mary, and situation over the Ree or river, in respect of London, is a stately Gothic structure, in the form of a cathedral. What is remarkable with regard to this church is, that it was granted, together with the tithes, to the church∣wardens and their successors for ever, to provide two chaplains at their pleasure, who are neither present∣ed nor endowed. In this parish is, first, the sessions∣house on St. Margaret's-hill, on the south-side of which, in a niche, stands the statue of James II. in his royal robes, holding a sceptre. Secondly, the Talbot inn, where, by an inscription on the main beam, it appears that Sir Jeffery Chaucer and twenty-nine pilgrims, in their way to Canter∣bury,
<PB N="227" REF="2310"/>
lodged in the year 1383. Its sign was an∣tiently a tabard, that is, a coat without sleeves, whence certain scholars in Queen's-college, Ox∣fords, are still called tabarders, from their hav∣ing formerly worn that habit. Thirdly, here was antiently the bishop of Winchester's pa∣lace and park; and on the bank-side were public stews licensed by the bishop, under certain regu∣lations, confirmed by act of parliament: whence the lewd women were called Winchester geese. Fourthly, the prison of the clink is in this parish, a foundery, and a machine for raising water, to sup∣ply the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Christ-Church parish belonged to St. Saviour's, till separated from it in 1670. Here was antiently two bear-gardens, supposed to have been the first erected near London, and now there is a glass-house.</P>
<P>St. George's parish. Where the church of this pa∣rish now stands, was formerly that of the abbey of Bermondsey. Here is a place that formerly claimed the privilege of protection from arrests, called the Mint, because there was once a coinage of money in it; but this pretended privilege was abolished by act of parliament in the reign of king William. Here is also the King's-Bench prison, whose rules are of considerable extent, and which is properly a place of confinement in all cases triable in the court of King's Bench. It is in fact a neat little town, in St. George's fields, surrounded by high walls, which include a piece of ground in which the prisoners exercise themselves in a variety of diversions. The Marshalsea-court and prison are likewise in this parish. Of the court the knight marshal is president, and his steward judge. Actions for debt, damages, and trespasses ten miles round Whitehall, excepting London, are cognizable here. It was originally intended
<PB N="228" REF="2320"/>
for the cognizance of causes between the king's domestics. The prison is the county and admi∣ralty gaol, as well as of the court. The White Lyon prison, or county-bridewell, is likewise in this parish, where are alms-houses under the di∣rection of the fishmongers company of London, besides several others.</P>
<P>St. Olave's parish. In this parish is a free-school founded by queen Elizabeth, and many wharfs for shipping and landing goods. Here was an∣tiently the city-residence of the abbot of Canter∣bury, and also that of the abbot of Battle, in Sussex, from whom the bridge called Battle-bridge took its name, as the place named the Maze did from the wilderness in his garden.</P>
<P>St. John's, Horsley-down, is taken out of St. Olave's, and the church is one of the fifty new ones. The parish is said to have had its name from its be∣ing a field formerly, where horses grazed. Here too was once the artillery-ground and house belonging to the trained-bands of Southwark.</P>
<P>St. Thomas's. The church of this parish was first intended for the hospital of St. Thomas, but afterwards made parochial, and a chapel erected in the hospital for the use of the patients. The hospitals of St. Thomas and Guy, both in this pa∣rish, are two noble foundations. St. Thomas's for the cure of the sick, lame, and infirm, was founded by Edward VI. but the present struc∣ture, which is very large and commodious, con∣sisting of several courts, was built in 1693 and 1732, and now it takes in such a number of pa∣tients, that the annual disbursements amount to near eight thousand pounds. The num∣ber of patients in and out of the hospital are ge∣nerally betwixt six and seven hundred. There are nineteen wards, and four hundred and seventy-four beds, the utmost care being taken of the
<PB N="229" REF="2330"/>
patients. Besides the lord-mayor and aldermen, there are upwards of two hundred governors. At a little distance from this hospital is Guy's, one of the noblest private charities perhaps in the world. The founder, Mr. Guy, a bookseller in London, left two hundred and thirty-eight thou∣sand pounds for building and endowing it. The building consists of two spacious squares, with twelve wards, and four hundred and thirty-five beds. In 1738, there were four hundred and six patients, be∣sides out-patients; and the expences of the house in 1737, amounted to seven thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight pounds, fourteen shillings, and one penny. The hospital takes in incurables, as well as others.</P>
<P>St. Mary's Newington, or Newton. The vil∣lage called Newington Butts, in this parish, had the epithet of butts, from the butts at which they used to shoot formerly, to acquire a dexterity in archery, before the invention of fire-arms. It hath been much improved and enlarged of late, as have most of the other villages about London. At the corner of Kent-street is the Lock-hospital, belonging to St. Bartholomew's in London, and employed chiefly for the cure of venereal patients. Of the two alms-houses in the parish, that be∣longing to the fishmongers is a very large, hand∣some, convenient structure, consisting of three courts. At Kennington was antiently a royal man∣sion, and on its common is now a place for the execution of criminals.</P>
<P>St. Mary's, Lambeth, is a large parish, about seven miles in circumference, divided into four liberties and eight precincts. The archbishops of Canterbury have long had a palace here, which is a very stately venerable pile, consisting of a tower on the north-side, called the Lollards tower, be∣cause these people used formerly to be imprisoned
<PB N="230" REF="2340"/>
in it, as the king's adherents were during the civil wars, a chapel, guard-room, hall, gallery, library, and cloysters, besides the archbishop's apartments. The north part is very antient; a part of it was built by cardinal Pole, and the whole repaired by archbishop Juxon. There is a piece of ground in this parish, now built upon, called Pedlar's∣acre, given by a pedlar, on condition that his and his dog's pictures should be perpetually pre∣served in the church in painted glass. Through Lambeth-marsh and St. George's fields, runs the canal that was made by Canute, to turn off the course of the Thames, and bring his fleet of small vessels to the west side of London-bridge. Oppo∣site to Somerset-house, in this parish, were for∣merly Cuper's-gardens, laid out in agreeable walks, with a pretty temple for the accommodation of a band of music, to entertain the company that vi∣sited them in the summer evenings. But the pub∣lic gardens in this parish, called Vauxhall-gardens, are perhaps the finest of the kind in Europe. They are laid out in the most elegant taste, and every object conspires to ravish the beholder; such as the shady walks and groves, the ruins, statues, pavilions, all heightened and set off with the charms of music, vocal and instrumental, and the solemn shade of lofty trees; the whole scene animated by the glare of an infinite number of lamps, dispersed so as to produce the greatest wonder and delight. Near Vauxhall-turnpike, in this parish, are the remains of a Roman fort or entrenchment, and of another at the corner of St. George's fields, near the Ducking-pond, where urns, coins, and tesselated pavements have been frequently found. A Roman military way likewise extended from the Horse-ferry to Vauxhall, from thence to the Ducking-pond,
<PB N="231" REF="2350"/>
thence across St. George's fields to the windmill, thence to the end of Kent-street, where was a stone fortress, and thence to the Grange, near Bermondsey-street, where was another; so that lines and forts seem to have run round from the Thames at Lambeth to Deptford. It was at Lambeth, that the Danish king Canute breathed his last in the midst of his cups. In this parish are glass-houses and potteries; and at the Dog and Duck by St. George's fields, is a mineral water, which is said to give relief in the scurvy and many other cases.</P>
<P>St. Mary's, Rotherhithe, vulgarly called Red∣riff, is inhabited chiefly by sea-faring people and watermen, has three docks for ship-build∣ing, a copperas work, a corn-mill belonging to the king, and a free-school for the education of eight mariners sons.</P>
<P>St. Mary Magdalen's, Bermondsey. In this pa∣rish was antiently the stately abbey called Ber∣mondsey, from whence to the Thames went a wa∣ter-course that still remains, but is not now naviga∣ble, as it was formerly. Here is now a dock called St. Saviour's.</P>
<P>Having given some account of Southwark and the neighbouring parishes, we now proceed to treat of the other parliamentary boroughs.</P>
<P>Guildford, standing on the river Wye, which is navigable from thence to the Thames, is by some called the county-town, because the elec∣tions for knights of the shire are always held in it, and often the assizes. Here certain lands were an∣tiently held by the tenure of maintaining the king's laundresses, called, in the Latin of those times, meretrices, whence some writers have said that it was for maintaining the king's mistresses. It is a corporation, governed by a mayor, recorder,
<PB N="232" REF="2360"/>
seven aldermen, and sixteen bailiffs, and has always sent members to parliament. It has two churches, a free-school founded by king Edward VI. a handsome alms-house endowed by George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury, called Trinity-hospital, and two charity-schools. With regard to its trade, its market is one of the greatest in England for corn, a great part of which, as well as of that bought at Farnham, is ground in the mills upon the river, and sent in meal to London. Thither also, by the same conveyance, is sent a great deal of timber, brought not from the neighbourhood only, but also from Sussex. Here and all around, was formerly a great manu∣facture of cloth, which is now inconsiderable. On the top of a hill, near the town, is the gallows, so that the executions may be easily seen from the town. The wheat in the neighbourhood, having a red stalk, is very good, and bears a high price. A battle is supposed to have been fought here, where the two hillocks, called Robin-hood's butts stand, in which some of the chiefs slain in the en∣gagement are thought to be buried. The town gives the title of earl to the family of North; it has very good inns, being on the road to Ports∣mouth and Chichester.</P>
<P>Blechingley is a small, but antient town, and a borough by prescription, yet has no market. It is situated on the side of Holmssdale, on a hill, whence there is a very extensive prospect, and has a handsome church, a free-school for twenty poor children, and antiently had a castle. The manor belongs to the family of Clayton, at whose court-leet the bailiff, who is the returning officer, is annually chosen.</P>
<P>Rhiegate or Ryegate: by the name of this bo∣rough is meant the channel of a river. It stands in the vale of Holmesdale, which is supposed to
<PB N="233" REF="2370"/>
derive its name from the holm-trees with which it abounds, as well as with chalk, fullers-earth, and medicinal plants. It had antiently a castle, of which there yet remains a vault, capable of holding five hundred persons, in which, it is said, the barons held their meetings when they took up arms against king John. There was also a priory here formerly. In a vault, under the church, are many monuments of the Howards, earls of Nottingham. In the neighbourhood is a very fine seat called Flankford. It is a borough by prescription, and governed like the former.</P>
<P>Gatton is another borough by prescription. Tho' it is now a mean village, it was formerly a large town. It is governed by a constable, who returns its members, and is chosen at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. From the coins and other Roman antiquities found here, it is supposed to have been one of their stations.</P>
<P>Haslemere is a paltry place, but a borough by prescription, and its constitution the same as the former. It is supposed, and with some probabi∣lity, to have had a different situation, and to have been much more considerable formerly than it is now.</P>
<P>We come now to describe the other towns, some of which, tho' not parliamentary, are of much more note than most of those that are, particularly</P>
<P>Kingston, which took its name from having been the residence of many of the Saxon kings, some of whom were crowned here. Over the Thames at this place is a wooden bridge of twen∣ty arches, and here the summer assizes are gene∣rally held. In this town was antiently a house of Richard Nevil, earl of Warwick, who, from his deposing and setting up Henry VI. and Edward IV. was called the King-maker. Combe Nevil,
<PB N="234" REF="2380"/>
at a little distance to the south, was another seat of the same nobleman. Medals and coins of se∣veral Roman emperors are often found about it and the town; and east from it, upon a gra∣velly-hill, was a burying-place of the Romans. There are several springs in the neighbour∣hood, whence water is conveyed in leaden pipes under the Thames to Hampton-Court. From another spring in a cellar, near the town, flows a brook, which has a bridge over it at Kingston. Opposite to Combe is a royal-park, one of the largest in England, being eleven miles round. In the midst of it is a mount, called King Henry's, whence there is a most extensive prospect. King∣ston is a large town, has a good market for corn, a free-school erected and endowed by queen Elizabeth, an alms-house founded by alderman Cleave of London, and a spacious church, with eight bells, in which the pictures of Athel∣stan, Etheldred I. and II. Edwin, and Edward the Martyr, who were crowned here, and of king John, who gave the town its first charter, are preserved.</P>
<P>Petersham is a very pleasant village. It was heretofore so privileged from arrests, that no offi∣cer durst bring an arrested person thro', much less arrest one in it. The earl of Harrington, to whom it gives the title of viscount, as it formerly did of baron to the duke of Lauderdale, in the reign of Charles II. has a fine seat here, on the very spot where the earl of Rochester's-house for∣merly stood.</P>
<P>Richmond. The first royal palace built here was by Edward III. but that was levelled with the ground by Richard II. for grief that he had lost his queen there. Another erected by Henry V. was burnt down by an accidental fire in 1500.
<PB N="235" REF="2390"/>
The present structure was built by Hen. VII. and its name changed from Sheen to Richmond, of which place he had been earl before he came to the throne; but both the house and gardens have been greatly improved since, particularly by his late majesty and queen Caroline, the former of whom pur∣chased the houses on Kew-Green, where his pre∣sent majesty, when prince of Wales, used to re∣side in summer. It is still the summer-residence of her royal highness the princess-dowager of Wales. Of late years a considerable extent of ground has been taken into the gardens of Kew, which are agreeably laid out in lawns, walks, and groves, imbellished with temples, alcoves, and a very lofty brick tower in the Chinese stile of archi∣tecture. On Kew-Green there is a great number of elegant country houses belonging to the royal family, and other persons of distinction, now rendered the more agreeable and commodious by the new bridge built over the Thames at this place. The palace of Richmond, which is but an inconsiderable building, in respect of air and situation, yields to few, if any, and is adorned with some good paintings. The grand terras of the garden, which overlooks the river, is admired by all foreigners. The town extends a full mile up the hill from the Thames, skirted and inter∣mingled with gardens. The summit of Rich∣mond-hill affords a most inchanting prospect of towns, villages, bridges, woods, groves, gardens, fields, and an incredible number of delightful villas along the banks of the river Thames, which winds with a serpentine course through this delicious vale from Kingston to London. The tide, before the building of Westminster-bridge, used to rise as high as this town, but now falls short of it. On the top of the hill is an alms-house for ten poor widows, founded by Duppa, bishop of Winchester, in the
<PB N="236" REF="2400"/>
reign of Charles II. in discharge of a vow he had made.</P>
<P>Wandsworth, Battersea, Putney, and Wimbleton are four very handsome villages, pleasantly si∣tuated. Many rich citizens and gentlemen have seats about them, especially on Putney∣common. Battersea gives the title of baron to lord viscount Bolingbroke. Wandsworth has its name from the river Wandle, which there falls into the Thames, and has a bridge over it. It has a manufacture of brass-plates, kettles, skillets, and frying-pans; and a great many dyers live in the town.</P>
<P>Dulwich is remarkable for its college, founded in 1619 by Mr. Alleyn, who has been a player, for a master and warden, who were always to be of his own name, and bachelors; four fellows, of whom three were to be divines, and the other an organist; six poor men, and as many poor women, with a school for the education of twelve boys. Those who have a taste for the country will be much pleased with the rural simplicity of Norwood, thro' which there is an agreeable walk from the public-house called the Green-man, to the top of the hill, from whence there is a mag∣nificent prospect of London. On the farther side of this hill are the medicinal wells of Sydenham, the name of another village in the neighbour∣hood.</P>
<P>Stretham. The only thing for which this place deserves to be mentioned is its medicinal springs, discovered in 1660.</P>
<P>Epsom is a village noted for its numerous mine∣ral waters. The situtation is extremely pleasant, dry, and healthy, in the neighbourhood of Bansted∣downs; for which reason many gentlemen and merchants have seats about it. But none of these are comparable to that at the end of the town
<PB N="237" REF="2410"/>
called Durdan's, belonging to the earl of Guild∣ford. In the neighbourhood there was once a magnificent royal palace, called Nonsuch, built by Henry VIII. but pulled down in the reign of Charles II. Its purging waters are not so much frequented as they used to be. On the neighbour∣ing downs are horse-races in May, which occasion a great resort of company.</P>
<P>Farnham is said to take its name from the ferns growing about it. It was given by Aethelbald, king of the West Saxons, to the bishop and con∣gregation of Winchester; and since that time the bishop hath generally resided here in summer in the castle, which was built in a noble situation by Henry of Blois, brother of king Stephen, and bishop of Winchester. The cloathing trade was once very considerable here, though little or nothing of it is left now: but, till within these few years, here was one of the greatest wheat-markets in England. One day with another, two hundred and fifty loads of wheat used to be sold here; and the toll, at a medium, amounted to two hundred pounds a-year: but the market and meal trade have declined greatly since the people about Chichester and Southampton began to send their wheat in meal to London by sea. This place is also noted for its hop-gardens, in which it is said between three and four hundred acres are employ∣ed. Not only this town, but all the other market∣towns in the county, had either fifty pounds a-year for ever in land, or one thousand pounds in money, and every other parish almost six or eight pounds yearly, left them by one Smith, who had been a silver-smith in London, but afterwards went a begging, and was called Dog-Smith, from a dog that always followed him. Mitcham was expresly excluded from his bounty, because he had been whipt out of it as a common vagrant.

This town is large and populous, and governed by bailiffs and burgesses under the bishop of Win∣chester.</P>
<P>Godalming, whose name signifies Goda, or Go∣diva's alms, and is supposed to have been given by her to some religious house, is a corporation, and its chief magistrate a warden, chosen annually. The cloth manufacture, especially that of kerseys, both mixed and blue, flourishes here more than in any other part of the county. It is said to have been antiently a bishop's see, the revenues of which were afterwards conferred on the dean of Sarum. In the parish is the manor of Catteshall, or Gates∣hill, which was annexed to the honourable office of master of the king's-concubines. The town is noted for its fuel, which is peat, for the best brown paper made in its mills upon the river Lodden, and for liquorice and carrots. The river Wye has been lately made navigable from Guild∣ford to this town.</P>
<P>Woking is a private country town out of any great road, and is therefore little heard of. Here are the remains of a royal house, in which the old countess of Richmond, mother to Henry VII. resided. In this and other church-yards, where the soil is a light red sand, a kind of plant, about the thickness of a bullrush, with a head like that of asparagus, which rises almost to the surface, but never above it, is found in the graves, while the flesh of a corpse remains unconsumed, after which it dies away; the outside of it is black, but the inside red.</P>
<P>Bagshot. Here was formerly a royal house and park, to which king James and king Charles I. often repaired for the sake of hunting. The town has good inns. The heath is a barren desart of great extent, over-run with furze; but, by some late trials, the soil is found capable of improve∣ment.
<PB N="239" REF="2430"/>
In some parts it is beautified with clumps of fir and beech, planted by his late royal highness William, duke of Cumberland.</P>
<P>Egham is situated on the Thames over-against Staines, and has some good inns, besides alms-houses and charity-schools well endowed. In the field to the north of the town, called Rumney, Running, and Council mead, the great charter which laid the foundation of the English liberties, was signed by king John. In that which is now the parsonage-house lived Sir John Denham, au∣thor of that celebrated poem called Cowper's-hill.</P>
<P>Chertsey. Hither Cowley, the famous poet, retired from the servility and dependence, the splendid farce and insignificant pomp of a court, to the health, quiet, and freedom of a country life. This town and hundred has a bailiff appointed by the exchequer, independent of the high-sheriff. At Coway-stakes, near this place, Julius Caesar passed the Thames. The town has a handsome free-school.</P>
<P>Croydon, antiently Cradiden, is situated upon the edge of Bansted-downs, and is large and hand∣some. Here is a palace of the archbishops of Canterbury, now much neglected, and an hospi∣tal erected and endowed by archbishop Whitgift, for a warden and twenty-eight poor men and wo∣men, with a school for ten boys and ten girls. In the church, which is one of the finest of the county, are many remarkable monuments, particularly those of Dr. Grindall and archbishop Sheldon. A great deal of charcoal is made here, and a great quantity of oats, oatmeal, wheat, and barley, sold in the market and carried to London.</P>
<P>Bansted is a village noted for giving name to those beautiful downs that extend under different appellations for thirty miles, from Croydon to Farnham, and are covered with a fine carpet of
<PB N="240" REF="2440"/>
short grass, perfumed with thyme and juniper. The air of them is very pure and pleasant, the mutton small, but sweet, and the prospect very extensive and agreeable.</P>
<P>Darking stands on a rock of soft sandy stone, in which are dug many convenient cellars; and it has a good market for meat, wheat, fish, poultry, and especially fat geese and capons, brought hither from Horsham in Sussex, about which great num∣bers of them are bred and fattened. The great Roman causeway, called Store-street, made of flints and pebbles, from seven to ten yards broad, and near a yard and a half deep, passes through the church-yard, and may be traced a great way. In this manor, if the customary tenant dies intes∣tate, his youngest son or brother succeeds to the estate. From Box-hill, in the neighbourhood, so called from the great quantities of that wood grow∣ing upon it, is a most enchanting prospect, especi∣ally to the south.</P>
<P>Okeley has its name from the oaks grow∣ing about it, where a remarkable custom has pre∣vailed, time immemorial, of planting rose-bushes upon the graves, especially of the young of both sexes by their surviving relations or lovers. Here was formerly a castle in this town, and a bloody battle was fought near it between king Ethelwolf and the Danes. In the parish adjoining is a very high hill, called Lith-hill, whence, in a clear day, is one of the most extensive prospects in Europe, tak∣ing in a circumference of two hundred and sixty miles, including all Surrey and Sussex, part of Kent, Essex, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Buckingham∣shire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire beyond Windsor∣castle, Hampshire, and, as it is believed, Wiltshire.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Besides the antiquities already mentioned, there are, first, a camp of twelve acres in the parish of Walton upon Thames, which Dr. Gibson thinks took its name from the vallum. Secondly, an∣other large camp near Darking, containing about ten acres, with double deep trenches. Thirdly, a perfect Roman way on Letherhead-downs, in the road from London to Darking. Fourthly, two square Roman camps on the tops of two hills at some distance from Beddington. Fifthly, a cir∣cular fortification, called Bensbury, near Wim∣bleton, where Ceaulin, king of the West Saxons, defeated Aethelbert, king of Kent. Sixthly, the plain vestiges of a large town at Effingham, a small village not far from Letherhead. Seventhly, the platform of a Roman temple, five miles east of Guildford. Eighthly, the skeleton of a man nine feet three inches long, found in the church∣yard at Wotton. Ninthly, a passage a furlong in length, dug through the bottom of a hill, some∣thing like that near Naples, only that it does not go quite through, near Aldbury, five miles east of Guildford. It was intended as a way to a seat of the duke of Norfolk, but the original design was frustrated by a rock at the south end; however, it is still preserved as a curiosity. Tenthly, at Putney was born Thomas Cromwell, afterwards earl of Es∣sex, whose father was a blacksmith. Eleventhly, Richard Weston, of Sutton-place, near Guildford, brought clover first into England, and the river to Guildford, which he also made navigable to the Thames. Twelfthly, at Beddington, near Croy∣don, is a fine seat of the Carews, adorned with gardens, orchards, and a fine orangery, the trees of which are upwards of a hundred years old,

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>The name of this county is, with great probabi∣lity, supposed to be derived from some word in the antient language of the Gauls, signifying a corner, in which it is actually situated, and by which name it was distinguished by all the antient geographers; especially as many other places of the like situation have names somewhat similar; and the French express a corner by the word canton, which being derived neither from the German nor Latin, must from the Galic or Celtic, the modern French being composed of these three. It has the Downs on the east, Surrey on the west, Middlesex and Essex on the north, from both which it is di∣vided by the Thames, and the English channel and Sussex on the south and south-west. It is divided into five lathes, and these into sixty-eight hun∣dreds extending in length fifty-six miles, in breadth thirty, and in circumference one hundred and sixty-six, within which it contains one million two hundred and forty-eight thousand acres, four hundred and eight parishes, one hundred and sixty-three of which are vicarages, two cities,
<PB N="244" REF="2480"/>
thirty large towns, eleven hundred and eighty vil∣lages, and two hundred and twenty thousand in∣habitants. The county sends eighteen members to parliament, viz. two knights for the shires, four members for the cities of Canterbury and Rochester, four for the towns of Maidstone and Queenborough, and eight for the Cinque-ports, Dover, Sandwich, Hythe, and Romney.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>In different parts of the county there is a con∣siderable difference in the air. Upon the banks of the Thames, the sea coast, and Romney-marsh, it is aguish, especially to strangers, but in the rest of the county pure and pleasant enough. Hence in the east part towards the Downs and Thames, there is said to be health without wealth; in the Weald, wealth without health; but in the middle and towards London, both health and wealth. The county produces a great variety of valuable articles, and of many of these, not only enough for its own consumption, but also a large superfluity for its neighbours. It abounds in par∣ticular with hops and fruit, especially cherries and pippins, woods of oak, beech, birch, and ches∣nuts; cattle, especially about Romney-marsh, where the bullocks are large, and the pasture very luxuriant; mines of iron, pits of chalk and marle, fields of corn, woad, madder, flax, saint∣foin, and samphire. Nor is it destitute of sheep, deer, rabbits, sea or river fish, with the last of which it is supplied from the Thames, Medway, Darent, and Stour.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Canterbury is the capital of the county. It had the names of Durovernum and Darvernum

<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A view of the City of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="245" REF="2500"/>
given it by the Romans, and Durobernia by Bede, which are thought to be derived from Durwhem, signifying a rapid stream, such as the Stour, on which it stands, is. The Britons called it Caer-Kent, i. e. the City of Kent, but its present English name is of the same import, derived from the Saxon. Modern writers in Latin call it Cantuaria. Its great antiquity appears not only from Anto∣ninus's Itinerary, but from the military way which has been discovered here, and the causeways leading to Dover and Lymme, besides the coins and other curiosities found about it. The archie∣piscopal and metropolitical dignity seems to have been settled here very early, about the beginning of the ninth century, if not sooner; and to prevent its being removed, an anathema was decreed against any who should attempt it. After that the city flourished greatly, though it suffered in common with other towns during the Danish invasions, and at other times by the casualties of fires. The city was given intirely to the bishops by William Rufus, and was held in the utmost veneration in the popish times, especially after the murder of Becket in the reign of Henry II. to whose shrine so great was the resort, and so rich the offerings, that Erasmus, who was an eye-witness of its wealth, says the whole church and chapel in which he was interred glittered with jewels; and at the dissolution, the plate and jewels filled two great chests, each of which required eight strong men to carry out. The cathedral was granted by Ethelbert, king of Kent, upon his conversion, to Austin the monk, together with his palace, and the royalty of the city and its territories. This Austin founded a monastery for monks, called from him Augustin. After the cathedral had been several times destroyed by fire and rebuilt, the present was begun about the year 1174, and augmented and embellished
<PB N="246" REF="2510"/>
by the succeeding archbishops, till it was com∣pleted in the reign of Henry V. It is a noble Go∣thic pile, and before the reformation had thirty∣seven altars. A great many kings, princes, car∣dinals, and archbishops are buried in it. At the dissolution, Henry VIII. seized all the revenues both of the church and monastery, except what he al∣lotted for the maintenance of a dean, twelve pre∣bendaries, and six preachers, whom he established in place of the monks. Besides the cathedral and other churches, as well as a monastery, the city had antiently a castle on the south-side, and strong walls, with towers, a ditch, and rampart: it had also a mint and an exchange. As to its government, it seems to have been intirely subject to the arch∣bishop, both in spirituals and temporals, at least from the time that William Rufus gave it solely to bishop Anselm, till the reformation. It is now a county of itself, and the corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, a sheriff, twenty-four common-council-men, a mace-bearer, sword-bearer, and four serjeants at mace. Every Monday a court is held at Guildhall for civil and criminal causes; and every other Tuesday for the government of the city. With respect to its pre∣sent condition, here are at present no less than two or three thousand French protestants em∣ployed in the silk manufacture. Besides the cathe∣dral, it contains fifteen parish churches, seven hospitals, a free-school, a house of correction, a gaol for criminals, and a sumptuous conduit for supplying the inhabitants with water. It consists of four streets, disposed in the form of a cross, and divided into six wards, which are about three miles in circumference. It is surrounded on all hands with hop-grounds much to its advantage, and is famed for its excellent brawn. Whoever would be more particularly informed with respect
<PB N="247" REF="2520"/>
to the antiquities and history of the cathedral, and the archbishops of Canterbury, may consult Mr. Dart's History, and Willis's Account of the mi∣tred Abbeys.</P>
<P>Rochester is an antient city and the see of a bishop. Its present name is derived from the Saxon. Those by which it was known antiently were, Duro-brus, Duro-brivae, Duro-provae or Duro-brovae, Duro-brovis or Duro-breves, Roibis, and Roffa. It had once a very strong castle, built by William the Conqueror. Aethelbert, king of Kent, founded a church in it, and made it an episco∣pal see. To its cathedral now belong a dean and six prebendaries. The castle, with all its rights and services, was granted by James I. to Sir An∣thony Weldon, of Swanscomb, and his posterity, to whom it has proved a valuable acquisition; for, upon a certain day, all the tenants of the lands that hold of it by the tenure called castle-guard, are obliged to come and pay their quit-rents, or have them doubled for every tide of the Medway which they are absent, according to the custom of the manor. Here is a very handsome bridge of twenty-one arches, built in the reign of Henry IV. for the maintenance of which certain lands were granted in the reign of Ri∣chard III. and queen Elizabeth. The military way called Watling-street, passes through it, com∣ing from Blackheath, and extending to Dover. In different parts of the town, there are still some re∣mains of the old wall. Here is a handsome town∣house, a mathematical school founded by Sir Jo∣seph Williamson, plenipotentiary at the treaty of Ryswick, an alms-house founded by Mr. Richard Watts, and endowed with sixty pounds a year, and a handsome charity-school. There is an oys∣ter-fishery in the Medway, subject to the magistracy of the city, who hold a court on that account,
<PB N="248" REF="2530"/>
called the admiralty-court. Every one who has served seven years apprenticeship to a dredger∣man, and obtained a licence from the court, for which he pays six shillings and eight pence yearly, has a right to fish. The court has authority to appoint the time when oysters are to be taken, the quantity to be taken, the places where they are to be taken, and to punish offenders, and such as presume to fish without being duly qualified. The city consists chiefly of one broad ill-built street, and is governed by a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, of whom the mayor is one, twelve common-council-men, a town-clerk, three serjeants at mace, and a water-bailiff. It has given the title of earl to several families, but last to that of Hyde, descended from the earl of Clarendon. The see is the most antient one in England next to that of Canterbury.</P>
<P>Maidstone is generally stiled the county-town, the assizes being mostly, and the other courts always, held here. The knights of the shire also are chosen, and one of the public gaols, with the standard of weights and measures by act of par∣liament, are kept in it. Mr. Cambden thinks it is the Roman station Vagniacum, upon the river Va∣ga, or Medway. The Britons called it Caer-Med∣way, or Megwag, and the Saxons Medwegstone, from which the present name seems derived. It has been a considerable town ever since the time of the Romans, having been much favoured by the archbishops of Canterbury, whose peculiar the pa∣rish is, and served by their curate. There were once two colleges, and a palace built by them here; and the fine stone bridge little inferior to that of Rochester, was erected by them. Edward VI. made it a mayor-town; queen Mary disfranchised it for its adherence to Sir Thomas Wyat, who was lord of the manor, but queen Elizabeth incorporated it again. It is governed at pre∣sent
<PB N="249" REF="2540"/>
by a mayor, recorder, twelve assistants, call∣ed jurats, and twenty - four commoners. The earls of Winchelsea are lords of the manor, it having been granted to their progenetrix, the lady of Sir Moyle Finch, by James I. with the title of viscountess Maidstone. It is a large popu∣lous pleasant town, trading chiefly in hops and linen thread, of which, and likewise timber, wheat, apples, cherries, a sort of paving-stone, very durable, and white sand, it sends great quan∣tities to London, the Medway being navigable hi∣ther by barges and hoys of fifty or sixty tons. The London market is also supplied from hence with Kentish bullocks from the weald of Kent, which begins not far from the town. The adjacent country is extremely fertile and beautiful, full of villages and gentlemen's seats.</P>
<P>Old-Rumney, or Romeney, was formerly called Romenal, and from its name is thought to have been a work of the Romans. It was a considera∣ble place, till the reign of Edward I. when its harbour was deserted by the sea, since which pe∣riod it has been decaying. New-Rumney, which is one of the Cinque-ports, and with its members Old - Romney, Dangemarsh, Aswardstone, and Broomhill, is bound, by the constitution of these ports, to fit out fiveships of war. The town is hand∣some and pleasantly situated upon a gravelly-hill. Here the two great meetings for all the Cinque∣ports, called Gesling, are held yearly. The ma∣gistrates of the town were once called barons, but are now stiled a mayor and jurats. Its chief trade is grazing cattle in the marsh, which, according to Cambden, is fourteen miles long and eight broad, and, it is probable, was once covered by the sea. Tho' the air is unwholesome, yet the soil is very rich, and the pasture so luxuriant, that the sheep and bullocks fed here are reckoned the largest in
<PB N="250" REF="2550"/>
England, and so numerous, that they contribute greatly to the supplying the London markets. It contains forty-four thousand acres, two towns, and nineteen parishes, which, in order to promote the draining, settling, and cultivating, were encor∣porated by Edward IV. by the name of the bailiff, jurats, and commonalty of Rumney-marsh, and had great privileges and immunities bestowed upon them, such as scarce any other corporation in Eng∣land enjoys. Laws also are established among them, called the statutes of Sewers, by which all the low grounds from the isle of Thanet to Pevensey in Sussex are governed. In this, as in most other marshes, great trees are often found under ground.</P>
<P>Hythe is another of the Cinque-ports. Its name, in the Saxon, signifies a port, tho' it now hardly deserves the name, being choaked up in a great measure with sand. It took its rise from West-Hythe, and that from Limme, both which fell successively to decay, upon the sea retiring from them. It was incorporated by queen Elizabeth by the name of a mayor, jurats, and commonalty. Here are two hospitals, and antiently there were five churches, but now only one; under which, in a vault, is a huge pile of gigantic human skulls and bones, said to have been those of Danes slain in a battle near the town.</P>
<P>Dover is called Dubris in the Itinerary. Its present name is thought to be derived from the British Dufyrrha, signifying a steep place. It is also one of the Cinque-ports, and was bound for∣merly to find twenty-one ships for the wars, when it had a large convenient harbour, of which little remains. What it is chiefly noted for now is, its being the station of the packet-boats for France and Flanders, and the port where passengers com∣monly take shipping for France, the channel being narrowest at this place. On a hill, or rather rock,
<PB N="251" REF="2560"/>
on the right-hand, overlooking the sea, stands Dover-castle, so large that it looks like a little city. It is thought to have been first built by the Romans, by whom, when the empire began to decline, a company of Tungrians was placed here in garrison, a part of whose arms were those mira∣culous arrows formerly shewn in the castle. From that time scarce any notice was taken of it or the town, till a little before the conquest, when it was look∣ed upon as the key of England. After the con∣quest, large possessions were assigned by the Con∣queror to his nobles in Kent, upon condition that they should repair to its defence with a certain number of men, whenever there was occasion; but instead of this they afterwards paid a stipulated sum of money. It is too high to hurt or annoy any ship at sea, and could not stand a siege now half a day. In it is a well sixty fathom deep, the work of Julius Caesar, and now called Wat∣son's cellar, whence the water is drawn by a wheel. There is also an old church, said to have been erected by Lucius, the first christian king of Bri∣tain, which is a very great curiosity, and a Ro∣man pharos or watch-tower. The royal palace, chapel, and offices, appear from their ruins to have been exceeding grand. Upon another rock over against it are the remains of an antient building called Bridenstone, and supposed to have been a watch-tower to direct sailors by night-lights. In this town the lord-warden of the Cinque-ports is now sworn, the courts held, and most of the busi∣ness relating to the Cinque-ports in general trans∣acted. Here is also a custom-house and victualling-office. The situation of the town is very romantic, in a valley between lofty cliffs. It is governed by a mayor and jurats, and was incorporated in Edward the Confessor's time. Its members are Folkstone, Feversham, St. John's, St. Peter's,
<PB N="252" REF="2570"/>
Birchington, Kingsdown, and Ringswold. The town was antiently walled, had nine gates, and seven churches, five of which have been destroyed. Tho' great sums of money were expended upon the harbour in Henry VIII. queen Elizabeth, and king William's reigns, yet it will now admit only small vessels, and that only at high-water. Each of the twenty-one wards, into which the town was antiently divided, had a licensed packet-boat: and in the reign of Richard II. the fare was, for a single person in summer, six-pence, in winter one shilling; for a horse in summer one shilling and six-pence, and in winter two shillings. It now gives the title of duke to the family of Douglas in Scotland.</P>
<P>Sandwich is another of the Cinque-ports, whose members are Fordwick, Deal, Warmar, Rams∣gate, Stonar, Sar, and Brightlingsey. It stands at the bottom of a bay, near the mouth of the Stour, was formerly walled, and one of the chief ports of England, being obliged to send five ships for the king's wars, armed and equipped with twenty men each, which they were to maintain fifteen days, and after that by the king. The Pro∣tus Rutupensis, or Statio Rutupece, is supposed to have stood near this spot, whence the Romans used to sail to the continent, and where they first landed. It is said to have paid formerly forty pounds, and forty thousand herrings to the archbishop of Can∣terbury, yearly. Here Canute the Dane slit the noses, and cut off the hands of the English hostages. The town is governed by a mayor, jurats, and common∣council, has three churches, as many hospitals, a free-school, whence two scholars have exhibi∣tions in Lincoln-college, Oxford, a good custom-house, and key; but the harbour is so choaked up, that it will admit none but small vessels. There is a manufacture of cloth in the town; but their
<PB N="253" REF="2580"/>
chief trade is in shipping and malting. It gives the title of earl to the family of Montague.</P>
<P>Queenborough was built by Edward III. and called Queenborough in honour of his queen. He made it a corporation by the name of mayor and ju∣rats, bestowed a great many privileges upon it, and secured it with a castle: yet it is now but a poor mean place, its inhabitants being mostly fisher∣men, tho' still a corporation, and sends mem∣bers to parliament. It stands on the west side of the island of Sheppey.</P>
<P>This island, formed by the sea and the river Medway, the two mouths of which are called the East and West-Swale, is twenty miles in compass, and took its name from the great flocks of sheep constantly fed upon it. This island la∣bours under a searcity of wood and fresh water, but is fruitful in corn. All over the island are tumuli or barrows, which are supposed to have been raised over Danish officers, it having been long infested by these people. The usual passage from here to Kent, is at King's-ferry, where people are wafted over by means of a rope extended across the river, and secured at both ends. No toll is paid except on Sundays and certain holidays, the expence of which, a causeway leading to it, and a wall to keep out the sea, being all defrayed by a trifling tax, that the landholders of the isle impose upon themselves, at the rate of a penny for an acre of fresh land, and another for every ten of salt-marsh-land. The isle is much visited by botanists, on account of the great number of marine plants that grow in the marshes. In this island, at the mouth of the Med∣way, stands Sheerness-fort, a strong and regular fortification, built by Charles II. to defend the river, and prevent such a disaster as happened in
<PB N="254" REF="2590"/>
1667, when the Dutch sailed up the Medway, and committed such devastation. The town is a neat little place, where is a yard and dock for building and repairing fifth and sixth rates, frigates, and yachts. The river from hence to Rochester is very broad and deep, and makes a very noble safe harbour for the largest men of war. On both shores of the Medway also, for further se∣curity, are two castles, called Upnor and Gilling∣ham, both well supplied with guns.</P>
<P>Chatham, which is a continuation of Rochester, was founded by Charles II. after the Dutch-war, and has been ever since a celebrated station of the royal navy. Here is every requisite for building, repairing, rigging, cleaning, and laying up ships of war; as docks, yards, launches, forges, founde∣ries, warehouses, and storehouses, in which there are such immense quantities of naval stores, and disposed in such order, as is really amazing. Two commissioners, and other officers, constantly reside here, to take care of the stores and works, and give necessary orders. As the public buildings are sur∣prisingly large and stately, so are the private houses in general very neat and commodious. The town gives title of earl to the late right honourable William Pitt, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>. The charity, called the Chest, for the relief of wounded and disabled seamen, was established after the defeat of the Spanish ar∣mada, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, by Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins, who en∣gaged the seamen then in the queen's service to allow a small portion of their pay for that pur∣pose; and this, having been approved of by the go∣vernment, has been continued ever since.</P>
<P>Stroud stands on the other side the river, close to Rochester-bridge, and with Chatham and Ro∣chester form almost one continued town. It was
<PB N="255" REF="2600"/>
a manor formerly belonging to the Knights-Tem∣plars, to whom Henry III. granted it.</P>
<P>Lewisham is only a village, yet often men∣tioned in history on account of some memorable incidents. In this place, in the reign of Charles II. an alms-house, and two free-schools, one for English, and the other for Latin, with a mainte∣nance for some of the scholars at the university, were founded by Abraham Colf, minister of the parish, who appointed the leather-sellers company in London governors of them.</P>
<P>At Bromley is a palace of the bishops of Rochester, to whom, in the year 700, king Edgar gave the manor; and here, in the reign of Charles II. Warner, bishop of Rochester, founded an hospi∣tal for twenty poor widows of clergymen, to whom he allowed twenty pounds a-year, and fifty pounds to a chaplain.</P>
<P>Eltham had formerly a royal palace, which, such are the changes and revolutions that time brings about, is now a barn belonging to a farmer in the village. It seems to have been very large and magnificent, with spacious gardens, and a broad deep moat running round it. Edward II. generally resided here, and his queen was deli∣vered of a son at this place, called John of El∣tham. The crown-lands are now in the possession of Sir John Shaw, baronet. It is a neat village, a considerable thoroughfare, and gives title of earl to his royal highness the prince of Wales.</P>
<P>Sevenoak, or Sennock, is said to have had its name from seven oaks of extraordinary height that grew there formerly. Sir Humphry Stafford was defeated near this place by Jack Cade and his fol∣lowers, in the reign of Hen. VI. and here Sir William Sevenoake, who is said to have been a foundling, supported and educated by a charitable person of
<PB N="256" REF="2610"/>
the town, from which he had his name, but rose afterwards to be lord-mayor of London, founded, out of gratitude, a school and hospital. The town is governed by a warden and assistants, and stands on the river Darent.</P>
<P>Dartford is a contraction of Darentford, the town being situated upon the Darent, which is navigable for barges, and has several paper, powder, and other mills on it. The first mill for making paper, and also for slitting iron bars to make wire, was erected on the river by Sir John Spelman, in the reign of Charles II. At this place the rebellion raised by Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, in the time of Richard II. began; and here Edward III. built a nunnery, which Henry VIII. converted into a palace. The town is a great thoroughfare on the road to Dover and Can∣terbury, and has a good market for corn. Upon a little river that falls into the Darent below this town, stands St. Mary's-Cray, Paul's-Cray, Foot's-Cray, North-Cray, and Crayford, all which de∣rive their name from the river, which was an∣tiently called Creece, but now Crouch. At Crayford the Britons were totally defeated by Hengist the Saxon; in consequence of which victory he found∣ed the kingdom of Kent. In the heath and fields in the neighbourhood of the same place are many caves, narrow at top and wide at the bottom, in which the Saxons secreted their wives, children, and effects, when at war with the Britons.</P>
<P>Tunbridge has its name from the bridge over the Tun, one of the branches of the Medway. Here was antiently a castle built by Richard de Clare, who had the manor in lieu of Briony in Normandy, of which his grandfather Godfrey, a natural son of Richard I. duke of Normandy, had been earl. But the earls of Gloucester, his suc∣cessors,
<PB N="257" REF="2620"/>
held it afterwards of the archbishops of Canterbury. A free-school was erected here by Sir Andrew Judd, a native of the place; and cer∣tain lands and tenements settled on it by act of parliament, in the reign of queen Elizabeth. From hence the earls of Rochford derive the title of viscount. In the parish, only four miles from the town, are the so much celebrated wells, whose waters are very efficacious in cold chronical diseases, weak nerves, and bad digestion. They are much frequented in the months of June, July, and Au∣gust, both for health and pleasure. At the prin∣cipal well are paved walks, of which one is co∣vered for the music to play, and the company to walk in, in wet weather, besides the long-rooms, shops, coffee-rooms, gardens, bowling greens, a chapel, and market. There are balls four times a week; and it is observed that they who have no∣thing to do any where else, are the busiest here. The air of the place is exceeding good, and pro∣visions, whether butchers-meat, fish, wild or tame fowl, in great plenty and perfection. The company divert themselves with walking, dancing, bowling, card-playing, raffling, tea-drinking, dressing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Lenham is thought by Cambden to be the Durolenum or Durolevum of Antoninus. In the church is the tomb of Robert Thompson, esquire, the grandchild of Mary Honeywood, who, as appears from the epitaph, had three hun∣dred and sixty-seven children, lawfully descended from her, sixteen of her own body, one hundred and fourteen grand-children, two hundred and twenty-eight in the third generation, and nine in the fourth.</P>
<P>Sittingbourn lies in the lathe of Scray. Being a considerable thoroughfare, it has several inns, of which the Red Lion is remarkable for an enter∣tainment
<PB N="258" REF="2630"/>
given in it to Henry V. when he re∣turned from France, which, though then counted an elegant one, cost only nine shillings and nine∣pence, wine being at one penny a pint, and other things proportionably cheap. Teynham, in this neighbourhood, gives the title of baron to a de∣scendant of Sir John Roper, who was the first man in the county that proclaimed James I. and on that account was created baron of Teyn∣ham.</P>
<P>Wye stands on the Stour, which is navigable hitherfor barges. At this place Edward II. kept his Christmas before his coronation, and after he had buried his father, the manor then belonging to the crown; and here Kemp, archbishop of Can∣terbury, built a collegiate church, the lands of which are now in the possession of the earl of Win∣chelsea, who is lord of the royal manor of Wye. The lady Thornhill, to erect and endow a charity-school, left two thousand five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Ashford. The manor of this town belonged antiently to the dean and canons of Westminster. It stands on the road from London to Hythe, is governed by a mayor, and has a court of record once in three weeks, for all actions of debt or da∣mages, not exceeding twenty marks. It has also a free grammar-school, and a market every Tues∣day fortnight.</P>
<P>Dimchurch. By a statute of Edward III. the corporation of Rumney-marsh are to meet here fifteen days after Michaelmas, to settle all diffe∣rences, enforce the execution of the marsh-laws, and enact new ones for the general interest and be∣nefit of the community. Here also the courts for the lathe, and the records of Rumney-marsh, are kept.</P>
<P>Folkstone is a member of the Cinque-port of Dover, and by the coins and other antiquities
<PB N="259" REF="2640"/>
found about it, appears to be antient. It had for∣merly a watch-tower upon a hill, still called Castle-hill, a fort built in 1068, the ruins of which are still visible, as well as a nunnery. The town is in∣corporated by the name of mayor, jurats, and com∣monalty, has a harbour for small ships, and the inha∣bitants, who are mostly fishermen, are employed, in the different seasons, in catching mackarel for London, and herrings for the merchants of Yar∣mouth and Leostoff. There are about three hundred fishing-boats or smacks belonging to it. In this town the celebrated Dr. Harvey, who discovered the circulation of the blood, was born; and here Sir Eliab Harvey endowed a charity-school.</P>
<P>Sandgate-castle stands a little to the south of Folkstone, upon the sea-shore. It was built by Henry VIII. at the expence of five thousand pounds. There are now a few guns mounted on it to protect the harbour and fishermen of Folke∣stone.</P>
<P>The head-lands upon this coast, called the South and North Foreland, are the two most eas∣terly points of Kent, and the bay between them is called the Downs. This would be a very dangerous road for ships, were it not pretty well sheltered by two head-lands and the Goodwin-sands, which run for about three leagues parallel to the shore, and at a considerable distance from it: yet ships are still exposed to great danger in hard gales at south-east, east-by-north, or east-north-east.</P>
<P>Tenterden is an antient town, governed by a mayor and jurats. It has a free-school, but is most remarkable for the lofty steeple of its church, which, it is pretended, was by accident the cause of the Goodwin-sands: for the abbot of St. Au∣gustin, near Canterbury, who was rector of the parish, being so intent upon the building this
<PB N="260" REF="2650"/>
steeple, as to neglect the wall by which that tract of land, now called the Goodwin-sands, was guarded from the sea, it was so overflowed, that it could never afterwards be recovered.</P>
<P>Deal. Julius Caesar, who landed here in his descent upon Britain, calls it Dola. On each side the town is a castle built by Henry VIII. to com∣mand the road, viz. Sandown on the north, and Wilmar on the south. It is now a handsome thriving town, in consequence of the great resort of seamen to it from the Downs: besides, it carries on some foreign trade, and most ships bound to or from London stop at it, either to take in fresh provisions, receive or dispatch letters from and to their owners and merchants, or set passengers on shore.</P>
<P>Margate, otherwise called St. John's, is a mem∣ber of the town and port of Dover. Here king William frequently landed in his return from the continent, as passengers do still when the wind does not serve for the Thames. It has a good bay for vessels to ride in, and a large pier, maintained by a duty on all goods shipped or landed there, whence a great deal of corn, chiefly the pro∣duce of the island, is exported. It was, till of late, a poor place, inhabited chiefly by fishermen and mariners; but has been for some time so much frequented for bathing in the sea, either for health or pleasure, that its condition is much altered for the better; for here are now several bathing-rooms, a parade, assembly-room, playhouse, and some good inns. Two physicians usually reside in it during the summer season. Hoys go regularly once a week between London and Margate, and passengers pay half a crown, besides a trifle for their baggage. Near this town is the North Foreland and a light-house, on the top of which a fire is kept blazing all night, for the direction of
<PB N="261" REF="2660"/>
mariners. Here was fought a bloody battle be∣twixt the Danes and Saxons about the year 853, in the reign of Ethelwolf. On the field of battle are still two barrows, the tombs, as it is supposed, of some of the Danish officers. This town is situ∣ated in the isle of Thanet, formed by the sea and the river Wantsum, which is eight miles in length, four in breadth, and very fruitful in corn and grass. When Vortigern, the British king, sent for the Saxons to assist him against the Scots and Picts, he gave them this isle; and here the Danes first landed and began their depredations. Though there are fifteen or sixteen hundred fa∣milies upon the island, it is said there is hardly a gentleman's house in it. At the North Foreland, on the north east of it, the mouth of the Thames on this side begins, as it does on the other at the Nase in Essex. The principal place is Rams∣gate, where a noble pier is now building; and where the inhabitants pretend that Julius Caesar first landed: whence its true name, as they alledge, is Romansgate.</P>
<P>Feversham is a very antient town; for in a char∣ter of king Kenulf's, anno 802, it is called the King's little town. In the reign of king Athel∣stan, anno 903, a great council was held in it, and several laws enacted. Here was also a mitred abbey erected by king Stephen, in which he, with Maud his queen, and Eustace his son, was bu∣ried. It now belongs to the marquis of Rocking∣ham. The town is a corporation by the name of the mayor, jurats, and commonalty. It lies upon a creek of the East Swale, navigable for hoys and lighters; and the country about it is exceeding fruitful, especially in apples and cherries. The principal business of the town is fishing for oysters, of which the Dutch take great quantities, to the amount of two or three thousand pounds yearly,
<PB N="262" REF="2670"/>
besides what they dispose of at home: but this trade is attended with a great disadvantage, prodigi∣ous quantities of wine, coffee, tea, brandy, and pep∣per, being brought over by the Dutch from France and Holland, which are run by the fishermen, and a part exchanged for wool. It was here that James II. was stopped when he was going to France, af∣ter the prince of Orange had landed; and the ge∣neral of his army, a brother of the family of Du∣ras, in France, had the title of earl from this town.</P>
<P>Milton, or Middleton, has its name from its be∣ing situated in the middle of the county, between the Downs and Deptford, and is particularly fa∣mous for its delicate oysters. It is a large town situated among the creeks of the East Swale, and has a good market for corn and fruit. The ma∣nor belongs to the earl of Pembroke. The kings of Kent had a palace here antiently, which was burnt down by earl Goodwin, in Edward the Con∣fessor's time. The town has a harbour for barges, and is governed by a port-reve, who supervises all the weights and measures of the hundred. Not far from the town are the remains of a fortification erected by king Alfred, called Bernard-castle, and of another by Hastings the pirate, called Castle-ruff.</P>
<P>Gravesend is a noted town upon the Thames, opposite Tilbury-fort, in Essex. It was plun∣dered and burnt in the reign of Richard II. by the French and Spaniards; on which account Ri∣chard, at the request of the abbot of St. Mary le Grace, on Tower-hill, to whom he had granted a manor there called Parrocks, vested it with the sole privilege of carrying passengers from thence to London by water. The town is surrounded with garden-grounds, which are noted for the excel∣lent asparagus they produce. All outward-bound
<PB N="263" REF="2680"/>
ships are obliged to come to an anchor here, till they have been visited and examined by the custom-house officers; and here they generally take in provisions. The place thrives a-pace, in conse∣quence of its being continually crowded with sea∣men belonging to the shipping riding at anchor before it. Here is a blockhouse well mounted with cannon to command the ships and river. Milton and Gravesend are a corporation by the name of mayor, jurats, and inhabitants of both towns. The fare in the tilt-boat is now nine-pence a-head, and one shilling in the wherry. The former must not take in above forty passengers, and the latter no more than ten. Both at Billingsgate and Gravesend, a bell is rung for fifteen minutes at high-water, by night and day, to give notice to the tilt-boats and wherries to put off. Coaches also ply at Gravesend to carry passengers to Rochester. Here is a very handsome charitable foundation, Mr. Henry Pinnock, having, in 1624, given two dwelling-houses, and a house for a master-weaver to employ the poor; and a good estate is also settled for the repairs. Swanscomb, near Graves∣end, is said to have derived its name from Swain, king of Denmark, he having encamped there al∣ter landing from the Thames.</P>
<P>Woolwich is almost entirely made up of docks, yards, and storehouses, with the houses of the of∣ficers belonging to them and the ordnance. There are immense stores of timber, plank, masts, pitch, tar, &amp;c. for the use of the royal navy. There is also a spacious rope-walk for making ca∣bles and cordage; and in the lower part of the town is the gun-yard or warren, where is a prodi∣gious magazine of artillery, mortars, bomb-shells, carcases, granadoes, &amp;c. The Thames is here so broad and deep, that the largest men of war may ride with safety even at low-water. At this
<PB N="264" REF="2690"/>
place is an academy, in which young gentlemen are taught navigation, gunnery, and fortification, and thereby qualified to make able engineers, and officers in the navy.</P>
<P>Greenwich is very pleasantly situated upon the bank of the Thames. In this town was formerly a royal palace, built by Humphrey, duke of Glou∣cester, enlarged by Henry VII. and completed by Henry VIII. who often resided there, as did queen Mary and queen Elizabeth, who were also born in it; and it was here Edward VI. died. Near the town is a park planted and walled in by Charles II. with a hill in the middle, whence there is a noble prospect of London, the Thames, and shipping; also a royal observatory furnished with a complete set of instruments for astronomi∣cal observations. But the glory of Greenwich is the hospital for disabled and superannuated seamen, their widows, and children. It is a very noble structure, the wing next London being part of the palace that king Charles II. intended to have erected, and which cost him thirty-six thousand pounds, being finely adorned with all the deco∣rations of painting, sculpture, and architecture. About two thousand old disabled seamen are main∣tained in it. The nurses, who must be seamen's widows, have ten pounds a year, and such as at∣tend the infirmary, two shillings a week more. Besides private benefactions to the amount of about sixty thousand pounds, the parliament, in the year 1732, settled the earl of Derwentwater's estate up∣on the hospital to the yearly value of six thousand pounds. The hall of the hospital is finely painted by Sir James Thornhill. All strangers who see it pay two pence each, and this income is applied to the support of the mathematical school for the sons of sailors. For the better support of this hospital,
<PB N="265" REF="2700"/>
every seaman in the royal navy, and in the mer∣chants service, pays sixpence a month, stopped out of their pay, and delivered in at the sixpenny receivers office on Tower-hill: on which account a seaman, who can produce an authentic certificate of his being disabled and rendered unfit for service, by defending any ship belonging to his majesty's British subjects, or in taking any ship from the enemy, may be admitted into this hospital, and receive the same benefit from it, as if he had been in his majesty's immediate service. Besides the seamen and widows mentioned above, about one hundred boys, the sons of seamen, are in∣structed in navigation, and bred up for the ser∣vice of the royal navy; but there are no out-pen∣sioners, as at Chelsea. Each of the mariners has a weekly allowance of bread, beef, mutton, pease, cheese, butter, and beer, and one shilling a week tobacco-money. The tobacco-money of the boat-swains is two shillings and six-pence a week each; that of their mates one shilling and sixpence; and that of the other officers in proportion to their rank. Each common pensioner also, once in two years, has a suit of blue cloaths, a hat, three pair of stockings, two pair of shoes, five neck∣cloths, three shirts, and two night-caps. The principal officers of the house are a governor, lieu∣tenant-governor, treasurer, three captains, six lieu∣tenants, two chaplains, a physician and surgeon, a clerk of the checque, and an auditor, who have handsome salaries. In this town are also two charity-schools, the one endowed with four hun∣dred pounds a year, for twenty boys, of which the drapers company of London are managers, and the other with ninety-five pounds a year, for twenty-eight boys under the care of the vicar, church-wardens, and overseers. In the reign of James I. the earl of Northampton, brother to the duke
<PB N="266" REF="2710"/>
of Norfolk, founded and endowed an hospital for twenty old decayed housekeepers, which is commonly called the duke of Norfolk's college, and committed to the care of the mercers com∣pany in London. Many of the inhabitants of the town are persons of note and fashion, who have served abroad in our fleets and armies. The pro∣fits of the market belong to this hospital, whose governors have the direction of it. It is remark∣able, that the first hospital that was founded by an English protestant, was here in 1560, by Mr. Lambard, author of the Perambulation of Kent, for twenty poor. Blackheath, in the neigh∣bourhood of this town, has been the scene not only of many robberies, but the rendezvous of many rebel armies: for here, in the reign of Ri∣chard II. Wat Tyler drew up a hundred thousand men, Jack Cade encamped on it in that of Henry VI. and in Henry VII's time, two thousand Cor∣nish rebeis were defeated. On the south side of the heath stands Morden-college, founded by Sir John Morden, baronet, for the reception of honest old merchants, not under sixty years of age, who have twenty pounds a year each. The num∣ber of pensioners was intended to be forty, which the house will accommodate; but at present there are not quite so many. It is under the direc∣tion of seven Turkey merchants, who fill up the vacancies that happen among the pensioners. The college has a chaplain, who reads prayers twice a-day, and preaches twice on Sunday, for which he has sixty pounds a-year. Adjoining to the college is a burial-place for the pen∣sioners.</P>
<P>Charlton, a pleasant village on the north-side of the heath, noted for a fair, which is of a very singular nature, called Horn-fair: for on St. Luke's-day, on which it is held, a great mob, in
<PB N="267" REF="2720"/>
consequence of a printed summons dispersed thro' town and country some days before, assemble at a place called Cuckold's-point, beyond Rother∣hithe, whence they march in procession with horns on their heads thro' Deptford and Greenwich to Charlton, where the fair is kept, in which the chief articles for sale are different sorts of wares made of horn. It used formerly to be a scene of the most unbounded licentiousness and obscenity; but of late it hath been reduced to a little more order and decency. Tradition gives this account of its origin: King John, while he was hunting hereabouts, having been separated from his at∣tendants, stepped into a cottage, where he found only a woman, with whose beauty being capti∣vated, he prevailed upon her to gratify his passion, tho' she was married; but having been surprised in the midst of his amorous transports by the hus∣band, the king discovered himself, and pacified his rage by presents, a grant of the hamlet, and all the land from thence to Cuckold's-point; and the husband, to perpetuate the memory of this adven∣ture, by which he was such a gainer, and which, no doubt, greatly flattered both his own and his wife's vanity, established, with the king consent, a fair for horns upon the spot.</P>
<P>Deptford is the last town of the county towards London. It had its name from a deep ford over the river Ravensbourn, where the bridge now stands. It is a large populous town, containing about one thousand houses, and is the seat of the corporation, guild, or brotherhood of the mariners of England, established in the reign of Henry VIII. called Trinity-house of Deptford∣strond, of which we gave some account already in our description of Stepney-parish in Middlesex. There are two hospitals, the one consisting of
<PB N="268" REF="2730"/>
thirty-eight, and the other of twenty-one houses, for decayed pilots, masters of ships, and their widows, in which the men are allowed twenty shillings, and the women sixteen shillings per month. But this town is chiefly distinguished by its noble dock and yard, which, like the others we have already described, are furnished with all the conveniences and stores requisite for building, equipping, repairing, and laying up ships of war. The town is now enlarged to such a degree, that it is, in a manner, joined to Rotherhithe. The yard, with the store-houses, docks, and officers houses, take up a considerable part of the town. The royal yachts are generally kept here; and near the dock is the seat of Sir John Evelyn, called Say's-court, where Peter the Great, czar of Muscovy, resided, while he attended the yard, to complete his knowledge in the practical part of naval architecture.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The antiquities of Kent, besides those already mentioned, are a fortification on the river Ra∣vensbourn, not far from Lewisham, inclosed with triple rampires and ditches of a vast height and depth, and near two miles in circuit, which is sup∣posed to have been a work of the Romans. A pavement of shell, or shell-like stones, of the conchite sort, discovered near Hunton on the Medway, in the year 1683. Keeth-coty-house, a monument of huge stones near Aylesford, sup∣posed to be the tomb of Catigern the Briton, who was killed here in a battle with the Saxons. At Gillingham, near Rochester, six hundred Nor∣man gentlemen, who came in the retinue of the princes Edward and Alfred, were massacred by
<PB N="269" REF="2740"/>
earl Godwin. Gad's-hill, near Gravesend, is noted for the pranks played there by Henry V. when prince of Wales. Great variety of Roman coins have been found at Reculver, the antient Regalbium, near Canterbury. In the year 1738 a number of broad pieces was found by a farmer at Tunstal near Sittingbourn, supposed to have been buried there in the civil wars. At Cran∣brook, fifteen miles from Maidstone, the woollen manufacture was first introduced into England by some Flemings, whom Edward III. had invited over for that purpose. Richborough, or Stonar, near Sandwich, is supposed to be the antient Rutupiae, a famous city and port of the Romans. At Richborough are still some remains of walls, and a tower. Before Sandwich gates are two Ro∣man tumuli, and six Celtic ones on the sea-shore. Between Sandwich and Richborough are the re∣mains of an amphitheatre of turf, on an emi∣nence.</P>

<P>This county is bounded by the English chan∣nel on the south; St. George's channel on the west; the Bristol channel on the north; and the river Tamar separates it on the east from Devon∣shire. Its name is supposed by some to be com∣pounded of Carn, signifying a rock in the British, and Gauls or Waules, the name that the Saxons gave the Britons; but others think it derived from the Latin cornu, or the British kern, which sig∣nifies a horn, on account of its running out into the sea, somewhat in the form of a horn. It is seventy miles in length, forty in breadth where broadest, and not five in the narrowest part. Its cir∣cumference is computed at one hundred and fifty miles, being divided into nine hundreds, in which are one hundred sixty-one parishes, twenty-one parliamentary boroughs, twenty-seven market-towns, between twelve and thirteen hundred vil∣lages, nine hundred and sixty thousand acres, and one hundred and twenty-six thousand inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county is sharp, but healthy. High and sudden winds are more common in this than in other counties. The spring also and harvest are observed to be more backward, and the summers and winters more tempe∣rate. It is a very rocky mountainous country, but the mountains are rich in metals, espe∣cially tin. The valleys are very pleasant and fer∣tile, and yield plenty both of corn and pasture. The lands near the sea-coast are manured and fer∣tilized
<PB N="273" REF="2780"/>
with sea-weed, and a kind of sand, formed by particles of broken shells, as they are dashed against each other by the sea. This county abounds in mines of tin and lead, moor-stones, lapis calami∣naris for making brass, Cornish diamonds, and a yellow ore, called mundick; whence copper and lapis calaminaris are extracted. Cattle of all sorts are smaller here than in any other parts of Eng∣land; and the wool of the sheep, which are mostly without horns, is very fine, and the flesh, both of them and the black cattle, extremely delicate. The county is well supplied with fish from the sea and rivers; but of the sea-fish the most noted and profitable is the pilchard, of which prodigious quantities are caught from July to November, and cured and exported, especially to Spain. It is said that a million have been sometimes taken at a draught. Excellent cod are also caught upon the coast. The pilchards are not gutted, as is usual with other sorts of fish, the entrails being the fattest part, and esteemed the most delicate. Here is also great plenty of sea and land fowl, both wild and tame. The Cornish chough is a kind of crow, with a red bill and feet: it breeds on the coast between the Lizard and Land's-end.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of the TIN-MINES.</HEAD>
<P>The tin dug from these mines, after the ore is re∣duced to powder by mills and washed, is melted into pigs of three or four hundred weight, with the owner's name stamped upon them. There are five towns, Leskard, Lestwithel, Truro, Helston, and Penzance, where the tin is assayed and marked at Midsummer and Michaelmas, or Lady-day and Christmas, with the seal of the dutchy of Cornwall. When it is thus marked, and the duty of four shillings for every hundred weight paid, the tin∣ner
<PB N="274" REF="2790"/>
may dispose of it as he pleases; only the king or duke of Cornwall are to have the preference, if they chuse to be purchasers. The causes arising among the tinners are tried by juries return∣ed by the mayors of the stannary or coinage-towns, before the lord-warden or his deputy. In conside∣ration of their paying so high a duty for the coin∣age of their tin, for in Devonshire they pay only eight-pence for the hundred weight, and as a re∣ward for their loyalty, and to encourage them in their application to the laborious, dangerous, and dismal business of mining, they have had many privileges bestowed upon them by our kings, and by the earls and dukes of Cornwall. The natives are remarkable for their strength and acti∣vity, as well as their dexterity in wrestling, in which exercise the Cornish hug is highly extolled.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>Ever since Edward III. created his eldest son duke of Cornwall, the eldest sons of the kings of England have enjoyed that title; and have royal prerogatives and privileges in the duchy, such as the nomination of its sheriff, a right to the duty on tin, wrecks, customs, &amp;c. Tho' this county is much inferior to some others in point of populous∣ness and wealth, particularly Yorkshire and Mid∣dlesex, yet it sends a far greater number of mem∣bers to parliament, viz. forty-four, which is near∣ly equal to the number sent from North-Britain, and double that sent from Wales. This great disproportion, so dangerous to the constitution, is attributed to the partiality of our monarchs, on account of the great revenue they received from it, or to the interest of its antient dukes. The bo∣roughs which send members to parliament, and of which there are seven or eight so inconsiderable
<PB N="275" REF="2800"/>
as to have no church, are as follow: Lances∣ton, Leskard, Lestwithiel, Truro, Bodmin, Hel∣ston, Saltash, Camelford, Westlow, Eastlow, Gram∣pound, Penryn, Tregony, Bossiney, St. Ives, Fowey, St. Germans, St. Michaels, Newport, St. Maws, and Kellington. Each of these sends two mem∣bers, which, with the two knights for the shire, make forty-four.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Lanceston is a populous trading town, the chief of the county, as well as the most antient. Here the members for the county are always chosen; and here, and at Bodmin, the assizes are held by turns. The manor is held in fee-farm of the prince of Wales, and the town governed by a mayor, recorder, and eight aldermen. There is a free-school in it, founded and endowed by queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Leskard is large and well built, has several manufactures of leather, and enjoys almost as great a trade as any town in the county. It has also a large church, a handsome town-hall, a free-school, a curious conduit, and was incorporated by queen Elizabeth, by the stile of mayor and bur∣gesses.</P>
<P>Lestwithiel stands on the river Tay, which is now so choaked up with sand, that ships come no farther than Fowey, which is at the mouth of it. This town, however, still retains the bushelage of corn, coals, salt, and malt, in Fowey, and the anchorage in its harbour. The weights and mea∣sures, and the common gaol for the whole stannary, together with the county courts, are kept here. The church of this town, and that of Helston, are the only places of worship in the whole coun∣ty that have spires. The corporation consists of
<PB N="276" REF="2810"/>
seven capital burgesses, of whom one is mayor, and seventeen common-council-men. The town is well built, and has a woollen-manufacture.</P>
<P>Truro is a considerable town, and as well built as any in the county. It is governed by a mayor, who is also mayor of Falmouth, four aldermen, twenty capital burgesses, and a recorder. At the election of the mayor, six-pence is paid for every house in the town to the lord of the manor, by way of acknowledgment; but the corporation has a right to the keyage of all goods laden or un∣laden at the port of Falmouth. Great quantities of copper ore are found in the mountains between this and St. Michaels; in shipping off which and tin most of the trade of the town consists. The inhabitants are noted for the elegance of their dress, and genteel manner of living.</P>
<P>Bodmin was once the see of a bishop, the re∣mains of whose palace, and likewise of a friary and priory, are still to be seen. The town extends about a mile in length, between two hills, and is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, out of whom the mayor is chosen, twenty-four common-council-men, and a town clerk. On Holgaver∣moor, in the neighbourhood, a prodigious num∣ber of people assemble every year about the mid∣dle of July, for sport and pastime; when, among other diversions, there are mock trials before a per∣son called the mayor of Halgover. This is the only staple-town in the county, having a good market for corn and meat, and a prison for debtors.</P>
<P>Helston consists of four streets in the form of a cross, and is a large populous place, near the mouth of a little river called Cober, where the tin ships often take in their lading. The spire of the church is so high, that it serves for a sea-mark. The town is governed by a mayor and four aldermen, who are to be of the common-council, and to
<PB N="277" REF="2820"/>
chuse twenty-four assistants. It enjoys several privileges, in particular that of holding sessions of the peace for the town.</P>
<P>Saltash. There is a ferry from hence to Ply∣mouth, which is only a league distant. Here is also a church, free-school, and market, and a great trade in malt and beer. The town is go∣verned by a mayor and six aldermen, who are stiled the council of the borough, and may chuse a recorder. It has considerable privileges, as a court of admiralty, coroner's inquest, anchorage of foreign shipping, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Camelford is a small town and corporation, standing near the river Camelford, whose arms are a camel passant over a ford.</P>
<P>Portpigham has also the name of Westlow, from its situation on the west side of the river Low, op∣posite to Eastlow, on the other side. The river has a stone-bridge over it, and is navigable for vessels of a hundred tons. The trade of the town, which is but small, is chiefly in pilchards, and the corporation consists of a mayor and twelve bur∣gesses, out of whom the mayor is chosen, and who together have a power to elect a steward.</P>
<P>Eastlow is a more considerable place than West∣low, and is governed by a mayor and eight capi∣tal burgesses, of whom one is always the mayor, and a recorder chosen by the mayor and burgesses. Here is a chapel of ease to the mother-church of St. Martin's, and a small battery of cannon.</P>
<P>Grampound is a corporation, tho' it consists but of one street, and has many privileges, possessing two fairs, and a market, exempted from toll thro' all Cornwall, view of frank-pledge, assize of bread and beer, the property of several mills and lands, &amp;c. It stands almost in the centre of the county, upon the river Falle, over which it has a bridge.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="2830"/>
Penryn is a neat town, adorned with gardens and orchards, and an arm of the sea on each side. This town has a share in the pilchard and New∣foundland-fisheries, and some considerable mer∣chants inhabit it. Here is a good custom-house and key, with a free-school founded by queen Elizabeth, a prison, and a guildhall. The mayor and two of the aldermen are justices of the peace; and the corporation has a power to try felons, with an office of record every three weeks.</P>
<P>Tregony stands on a river which is navigable by boats. It was incorporated by James I. and had antiently a castle, which is now gone to de∣cay. Its chief manufacture is serge; and the an∣tient, and now noble, family of the Boscawens are lords of the manor.</P>
<P>Bossiney, or Tintagel, had antiently a castle, esteemed one of the wonders of the county, as standing on two rocks, one on the land, and the other on the sea, joined by a draw-bridge. Here king Arthur is said to have been born, and to have been killed in a battle near Camelford. All that have free-land in the borough, and live in the parish, are freemen, and have votes in the election of its members and magistrates.</P>
<P>St. Ives. Before the harbour was choaked up with sand, this town drove a considerable trade in pilchards and Cornish slates. Here is a spacious church, and a grammar-school, founded by Charles I. and at no great distance are some cop∣per mines. From Madern-hills, betwixt this and the Land's-end, is a noble prospect of both chan∣nels, and of the ocean. The town is governed by a mayor, eleven aldermen, and twelve bur∣gesses, with a recorder, town-clerk, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fowey, or Foy, is a large town upon the Eng∣lish channel, and its trade is very considerable, especially in pilchards. In antient times it distin∣guished
<PB N="279" REF="2840"/>
itself greatly by sea; for it is said to have had once sixty sail of large ships belonging to it, to have triumphed at different times over all the Cinque-ports, and to have taken several French men of war. There was once a tower on each side the river on which the town stands, for its defence, the ruins of which are still visible. The corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, eight aldermen, a town-clerk, and two assistants: and the mayor, for the time being, and the next year after, together with the senior alderman, is a justice of the peace.</P>
<P>St. Germans, tho' once an episcopal see, which was translated hither from Bodmin, and from thence afterwards to Exeter, is now but a mean hamlet, governed by a portreve, or mayor, who is also bailiff, and may make any house in the vil∣lage the prison of those whom he arrests. The ruins of the episcopal palace are still visible in the neighbourhood. The parish is the largest in Cornwall, and contains seventeen villages, and a great many gentlemen's seats.</P>
<P>St. Michaels is an antient borough, tho' now but a mean hamlet, governed by a portreve chosen out of the six chief tenants of the manor, by a jury of the principal inhabitants.</P>
<P>Newport, lying in the same parish as Launceston, is neither a corporation nor borough; but its elections are managed, and its members returned, by two persons, called Vianders, chosen yearly at the court-leet of the lord of the manor.</P>
<P>St. Maws. The inhabitants of this town, which consists of one street fronting the sea, live chiefly by fishing. The castle here, and Pen∣dennis castle, opposite to it, were both built by Henry VIII. for the defence of Falmouth haven.</P>
<P>Kellinton is a considerable town, both for wealth and number of inhabitants. Its chief
<PB N="280" REF="2850"/>
support is a woollen manufacture; and it is go∣verned by a portreve, who is chosen yearly by the burgesses at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. Whoever has lived a twelvemonth in the borough, is qualified to be admitted a burgess.</P>
<P>Besides the parliamentary boroughs, the fol∣lowing places deserve to be mentioned, viz.</P>
<P>Falmouth is by far the most wealthy and po∣pulous, and has the most trade of any in the county. Its harbour, in which the whole royal navy may ride in safety, is, as we observed already, defended by two castles, with garrisons. Here is the custom-house for most of the towns in the county, and the station for the packet-boats to Portugal and the West-Indies. Its share in the pilchard fishery, and trade to Portugal, are also very considerable. It is governed by a mayor and aldermen, and gives title of viscount to the family of Boscawen.</P>
<P>Penzance, which is the farthest west of any town in England, and within ten miles of the Land's∣end, is well built and populous. Veins of lead, tin, and copper, are plainly distinguishable here at low-water, running into the sea. Near this town lies Mount's-bay, which is a very safe har∣bour against the south-winds. It has its name from a high rock in it, called the Cornish-mount, or St. Michael's-mount, there being a fort on it, with a chapel dedicated to that archangel.</P>
<P>St. Neots. The only circumstance for which this place is worth mentioning, are the paintings in the glass windows of the church, relating to some particular traditions of the Jews. It is pro∣bable the inhabitants had these from the Jews themselves, who traded hither for tin.</P>
<P>Padstow is very conveniently seated for trading to Ireland. Its name is a contraction of Petrock∣stow, from one Petrocus, a British saint; and its
<PB N="281" REF="2860"/>
chief trade is in herrings, which come up the channel in October, and in slate-tiles.</P>
<P>New-island, in its neighbourhood, is noted for camphire and sea-fowl.</P>
<P>Wadbridge is another market-town, which takes its name from a large stone bridge over the river Camel, some of the arches of which are said to have been founded upon woolpacks, on account of the quick-sand at the bottom of the river.</P>
<P>Redruth is a considerable market-town between St. Ives and Truro, much resorted to by the tin∣ners.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES and ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Godolphin-hills abound with mines, and give title of baron to a family of the same name, who are said to have been lords of them in William the Conqueror's time. They are about four miles from Market-Jew.</P>
<P>Trematon-castle was built before the Norman invasion, and was one of the four antient residences of the earls and dukes of Cornwall; but it is now in ruins.</P>
<P>St. Buriens is an antient independent deanery, held in commendam by the bishop of Exeter, from whose spiritual jurisdiction there is no appeal, ex∣cept to the king.</P>
<P>Boscaw-woane parish gives name to the family of Boscawen. There is a circle of large stones in it, which is supposed to be a sepulchral monument of the antient Britons.</P>
<P>The Hurlers are three circles of stones on the down not far from Bodmin, supposed by Dr. Stukeley to be an antient Druid temple; but by others, a burial-place. The common people will have it that they were men turned to stones for playing at ball on a Sunday.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="2870"/>
At Tintagil castle, king Arthur is said to have been born, as we hinted before, and to have lost his life in a battle at Camel sord, not far from it.</P>
<P>At Castle Treryn is a rock, so placed upon an∣other, that it may be moved with one finger, tho' of an enormous weight.</P>

<HEAD>Of the SCILLY ISLES.</HEAD>
<P>These islands, called by the Greeks Cassiterides, are reckoned part of Cornwall. They are about one hundred and forty in number, and about thirty miles from the Land's - end. Some are overflowed at high-tides, but most of them are high and rocky. Several are very fruitful both in corn and pasture, particularly St. Mary's, which is the largest, being nine miles in circumfe∣rence, with a harbour and castle. Scilly, from which all the rest are named, was once accounted the most considerable. Many abound with rabbits, swans, cranes, and herons. Formerly they were famous for tin mines; but of these there are now no vestiges. The inhabitants have plenty of fish, as well as milk and cattle. Notwithstanding the light-houses kept here, ships in dark nights and hard gales, or by misreckoning, are in danger of being driven on shore, and beat to pieces; and these isles have actually been fatal to many vessels, by being situated so much in the way of ships bound from the channel to the southward, or from the southward to the channel. But how∣ever the merchant and sailor may suffer, the inha∣bitants are often great gainers by shipwrecks; for in stormy weather great treasure is often driven on shore. Dr. Halley says the true latitude of the Lizard is forty-nine degrees fifty minutes; and that the variation of the compass ever since the year 1657, has been considerably westerly: he therefore recommends it to all masters of ships, that they steer two watches east-by-south, for one east, which will exactly keep them parallel; as al∣so that they come out of the sea on a parallel not more northerly than forty-nine degrees, forty mi∣nutes, which will bring them clear by the Lizard.</P>

<P>This county is bounded on the south by the English channel; by the Bristol channel on the north; on the east it has Somersetshire, and on the west Corn∣wall, from which it is divided by the river Tamar. It extends in length sixty-nine miles, in breadth sixty-six, and two hundred in circumference, being divided into thirty-three hundreds, in which are twelve boroughs that send members to parliament, forty market-towns, one thousand seven hundred and thirty-three villages, and three hundred and forty thousand inhabitants. The number of pa∣rishes in it amounts to three hundred and ninety∣four, of which one hundred and seventeen are vi∣carages; and contain one million nine hun∣dred and twenty thousand acres.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air, both on the hills and in the vallies, is healthy, though much sharper on the former than in the latter. The soil is various; in the western parts of the county it is coarse and moorish, and bad for sheep, though proper for black cattle, of which here are bred great numbers. In the northern parts, the dry soil and downs are well adapted to sheep, with numerous flocks of which they are covered. Tolerable crops of corn are also raised there when the land is well manured. The soil of the rest of the county is rich and fertile, both in corn and pasture, yielding also, in some places, plenty of marle for manuring it. In other places, where there is a scarcity of manure, they improve the land with ashes, produced by paring
<PB N="286" REF="2910"/>
off and burning the surface. Abundance of ex∣cellent rough cyder is made in some parts of the county; and formerly there was a great deal of tin dug out of it, tho' now very little. In this county are also found veins of loadstone, and quarries of slate and stone for building, of which considerable quantities are exported. Its principal manufactures are woollens of several sorts, and bone-lace. It has mineral waters at Cleave, Ta∣vistock, Lamerton, Lifton, &amp;c. Its chief rivers are Tamar, Tave, Lad, Ock, Tame, Touridge, Ex, and Dart. There were antiently a great many boroughs in this county which sent members to parliament; but the only towns now represented are these: Exeter city, Totness, Plymouth, Oke∣hampton, Barnstaple, Plympton, Honiton, Tavi∣stock, Ashburton, Dartmouth, Beeralston, and Tiverton.</P>

<P>Exeter is called Isca by Ptolemy, and by An∣toninus Isca Danmoniorum. The present name is a contraction of Excester, that is, a city upon the Ex. Edward the Confessor transferred the bishop's see hither from Crediton, and it had so many mona∣steries formerly, that it was called Monkton. The city is now large, populous, and wealthy, with gates, walls, and suburbs: the circumference of the whole is about two miles, being well supplied with water, brought in pipes from the neighbourhood. It consists chiefly of four streets, which meet in the centre of the town. In a part of the old castle, called Rougemount, from the red soil on which it stands, are held the assizes, quarter-sessions, and county-courts. This castle is said to have been antiently the residence of the West Saxon kings, and after them of the earls and dukes of Corn∣wall.

Here is a noble cathedral dedicated to St. Peter, three hundred and ninety feet long, and seventy-four broad; and notwithstanding it was four hundred years in building, yet looks as uniform as if built by one architect. In the Close about it are the houses of the dean and chapter. It has an organ so large, that the greatest pipe is fifteen inches diameter. Besides this, there are a great many churches and chapels, meeting-houses, hospitals, alms-houses, charity-schools, and prisons. There is also a work house, and a county-infirmary, three hun∣dred feet in length, of which the first stone was laid in 1741. This city is a county of itself, governed by a mayor, twenty-four aldermen, a recorder, cham∣berlain, sheriff, town-clerk, sword-bearer, and four stewards. When they go to church on publick occa∣sions, they are attended by four serjeants at mace, and four staff-bearers. The magistrates and free∣men, who are about twelve hundred, chuse the members of parliament. The magistrates have extensive powers with respect to the administration of justice, both in civil and criminal causes. For∣merly the sea flowed up to the city walls, and ships loaded and unloaded at the water-gate; but the navigation of the river was afterwards so obstructed by the weers made in it by Hugh Courtney, earl of Devon, that the merchants brought their goods from Topsham by land. A channel, however, hath been since cut thro' the dams, and vessels of one hundred and fifty tons now come up to the key. There is a prodigious woollen manufacture in this city of serges, perpetuanas, long-ells, drug∣gets, and kerseys. A serge-market is kept weekly in South-gate-street, in which goods to the amount of sixty thousand pounds are sometimes sold in a week. Roman coins have been often dug up here, and the city hath been frequently besieged, taken, plundered, and burnt; and that, for the most part,
<PB N="288" REF="2940"/>
in consequence of its loyalty to its sovereigns, for which it hath been greatly applauded. It gives title of earl to a branch of the noble family of Cecil. Near this city is the parish of Heavy∣tree, so called from the gallows erected for the execution of malefactors. Mrs. Tuckfield, whose husband had been sheriff of the county in the reign of Edward VI. purchased a piece of ground for their burial, and left money to buy them shrouds. Sir Thomas Bodley, founder of the Bodleian library, and lord chancellor King, were both born in this city.</P>
<P>Totness, consisting chiefly of one broad street, three quarters of a mile long, had formerly a castle and walls, of which some remains are still visible. Here the famous fosse-way began, and extended to Lincoln. This is the most antient borough in the county, tho' it was not made a corporation till the reign of king John. It has a fine church, a town-hall, free-school, and a stately bridge over the Dart. The method of taking salmon-peel here is extremely diverting: a spaniel trained up to the sport, drives them into a shove-net, by which means they will sometimes catch thirty at a time, which, tho' seven∣teen or twenty inches long, are sold for two-pence a piece.</P>
<P>Plymouth was antiently only a fishing village, but is now the largest town in the county next to Exeter. For this great change it is indebted to its port, one of the safest in England, and capa∣ble of containing one thousand sail. The town and harbour are defended by several forts, and a strong citadel, erected by Charles II. mounting near' three hundred guns. Here are docks, wet and dry, with all other conveniences and necessa∣ries requisite for building and repairing ships, and is as complete an arsenal as any belonging to the government. The corporation, which consists

of a mayor, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four common-council-men, has the impropriation of the churches, and the choice of lecturers every three years. They have also a right to the toll of the markets, of the corn, yarn, &amp;c. the profits of the mills, and the revenues of the shambles. The town is well supplied with water, which was brought from a place seven miles distant, at the ex∣pence of Sir Francis Drake, who was a native of the shire; as were also Sir John and Sir Richard Hawkins, the three greatest sailors of the age. Here are two handsome parish churches, a custom-house, four hospitals, a workhouse, and charity-school. The inhabitants drive a considerable trade to the Streights and West-Indies, and have a share of the pilchard fishery. On the Eddystone rock, at the entrance of the bay, is a curious light-house, erect∣ed by the corporation of Trinity-house. Around the dock, which is about two short miles from Plymouth, the buildings have multiplied so much as to form a pretty town of considerable extent.</P>
<P>Okehampton, standing at the mouth of the Oke, from which it takes its name, is governed by a mayor, eight capital burgesses, and as many as∣sistants, a recorder, justice, and town-clerk. It is a considerable thoroughfare, has a manufacture of serge; and the eight principal members of the corporation have a right to the toll of its fairs and markets.</P>
<P>Barnstaple. The name of this town is com∣pounded of bar, which in the British signifies the mouth of a river, it being situated at the mouth of the Taw, and staple, implying in the Saxon tongue a place of trade. It had formerly a castle, great privileges, and a considerable traffic, part of which was transferred to Biddiford, when its har∣bour became so shallow, as not to admit any but small vessels. However, its trade still exceeds that
<PB N="290" REF="2970"/>
of Biddiford. It is pleasantly situated among hills, the streets are clean and well paved, and gives title to one of the archdeaconries of the diocese of Exeter, which are four in all, viz. Exeter, Barn∣staple, Totness, and Cornwall, and is noted for fine ale. The corporation consists of a mayor, twenty-four capital burgesses, of whom two are aldermen, a high-steward, recorder, deputy-re∣corder, and other officers.</P>
<P>Plympton takes its name from the river Plym, tho' it is above a mile from it, and is called Plymp∣ton-Maurice, to distinguish it from Plympton-Mary, which is only half a mile distant. The town consists chiefly of two streets, has a well en∣dowed free-school, had formerly a castle be∣longing to the earls of Devon, and is governed by a mayor, recorder, eight principal inhabitants, a bailiff, and town-clerk.</P>
<P>Honiton stands on the river Otter. Its situation is extremely pleasant, and is a considerable tho∣roughfare, consisting chiefly of one long street, well built, and populous. It is an antient borough by prescription, and governed by a portreve, chosen at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. The chief manufacture of the place is lace of the broadest sort, of which great quantities are sent to London.</P>
<P>Tavistock derives its name from the Tave, on the banks of which it stands. Here was antiently a stately abbey, and a school, where the old Saxon tongue was taught. It is even said, that a Saxon grammar was printed here in the beginning of the civil wars. The town is an antient borough by prescription, governed by a portreve, chosen at the court-leet of his grace the duke of Bedford, who is lord of the manor, and to whom it gives the title of marquis.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="2980"/>
Ashburton lies upon the road from London to Plymouth, is a considerable thoroughfare, has also a manufacture of serge, several fairs, and a market on Tuesday. It consists of one pretty long well built street, and has a very handsome church, with a clock and chimes. Being an an∣tient borough by prescription, it is governed by a portreve, chosen at the court-leet of the lord of the manor.</P>
<P>Dartmouth. Under this name are compre∣hended Clifton and Hardness, besides that proper∣ly called Dartmouth, from its situation at the mouth of the Dart. It stands on the side of a craggy hill, and is a large place, but very irregularly built. Here is a harbour in which five hundred sail may ride in safety, defended by several castles, forts, and blockhouses: besides a chain, upon occasion, may be laid across the river's mouth. The trade of the town is very considerable, particularly in fish from Newfoundland. The inhabitants like∣wise trade with Portugal and the plantations, and have a large share in the pilchard fishery. The corporation, which consists of a mayor, twelve masters, twelve common-council-men, a recorder, two bailiffs, a town-clerk, and high-steward, have a power to make freemen, to hold a court of session, and water-bailiffwick-court, and are lords of the manor and royalty of Tounstall. The town gives the title of earl to the family of Legge. At a village called Brixham, near this town, is a remarkable well, called Laywell, which ebbs and flows every hour five or six inches, and sometimes bub∣bles up like a boiling pot, yet does not appear to have any communication with the sea. About twelve miles from hence to the south-west is the noted point called the Start, and as many to the north-east lies</P>
<P>Torbay, about twelve miles in compass, which
<PB N="292" REF="2990"/>
will be ever memorable for the landing of the prince of Orange, afterwards king William III. on the 5th of November, 1688. The bay affords safe riding to the most numerous fleets in stormy weather, when the wind blows from the west and north.</P>
<P>Berealston, or Bearalston, is a small, but an∣tient borough, governed by a portreve, chosen at the court-leet of the lord of the manor, and re∣turns the members elected by the burgage-holders. These burgage-holders pay each three-pence, or more, quit-rent to the lord of the manor, for the land they hold in the borough.</P>
<P>Tiverton is a contraction of Twyford-town, from two fords formerly in the rivers Ex and Loman, where are now stone-bridges. Tho' it has been thrice almost totally destroyed by fire, first in 1598, then in 1612, and lastly in 1730, when the loss was computed at one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, yet it is now very large, and flourishing, and has the greatest woollen manufac∣tory in the county next to Exeter. Here is a free∣school liberally endowed by Peter Blondell, a clothier, who also left two thousand pounds to found fellowships and scholarships in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The town is govern∣ed by a mayor, twelve principal, and as many in∣ferior, burgesses, a recorder, and clerk of the peace.</P>
<P>The principal towns, not parliamentary, are,</P>
<P>Biddiford, a contraction of By the Ford, being situated on the Towridge, over which it has a noble bridge. Ships load and unload at a fine key in the very centre of the town. Here are many eminent merchants, who carry on a great trade to Ireland, Virginia, and the West-Indies. They have also a very large share in the Newfoundland and herring fisheries. The corporation consists of a mayor, al∣dermen, recorder, and town-clerk.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="3000"/>
South-Moulton has its name from its situation on the river Moule, to which south is added, to distinguish it from another of the same name to the north of it. Here are two very great markets for all sorts of cattle and merchandize, a woollen manufacture, and a free-school. The corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, eighteen capital bur∣gesses, a town-clerk, and two serjeants at mace.</P>
<P>Great Torrington, or Towridge-town, is so called from its situation along the Towridge, over which it has a stone-bridge. Here are some con∣siderable merchants, who drive a great trade to Ire∣land, &amp;c. The town is governed by a mayor, eight aldermen, and sixteen burgesses; has two churches, and had antiently a castle in the south part of the town. It has a manufacture of stuffs, and a good market for corn, flesh, &amp;c. Margaret, countess of Richmond, and mother to Henry VII. resided some time at this place, and gave the manor-house, and lands adjoining to it, to the parson and his successors for ever.</P>
<P>Ilfracomb, or Alfrincomb, is a large town of great trade, especially in herrings, having a fine harbour and key, well provided with pilots, and pilot-boats, a warp-house, light-house, and con∣veniences both for building and repairing ships. The town consists chiefly of one street, of near a mile in length, but not compactly built, and is governed by a mayor, bailiffs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Credeton was the bishop's see before it was tran∣slated to Exeter. The cathedral is still standing, and is a very magnificent pile. This was a flourish∣ing town till the 14th of August, 1743, when it was almost entirely destroyed by a dreadful fire, by which more than two thousand families were reduced to the greatest distress.</P>
<P>Topsham is a small town, and stands three miles lower upon the same river as Exeter. It is, as it
<PB N="294" REF="3010"/>
were, the port of that city; and the larger ships unload here, and send their merchandize in lighters to Exeter.</P>
<P>Axminster. When Athelstan defeated the Danes at Brunaburg, in the neighbourhood of this town, he founded a minster, and college of priests, to pray for the souls of those that were slain in the engagement. This minster being situated upon the Axe, the town that afterwards grew up there, acquired the name of Axminster. It carries on a little trade in kerseys, druggets, and other articles of the woollen manufacture. In the hundred to which this town gives name, at Ash, in the parish of Mosbury, was born that great and illustrious general, John, duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>Comb-Martin lies a little to the east of Ilfra∣comb. Its neighbourhood is noted for producing the best hemp in the county. In the time of Ed∣ward I. silver mines were discovered here, which in the reign of Edward III. yielded great profit and even in queen Elizabeth's time, some silver was extracted from them. Some leagues west∣ward to this place lies</P>
<P>Lundy-island, three miles long, and two broad, is so encompassed with rocks, as to be accessible only in one place; and even there the entrance is so narrow, that two men can hardly go abreast. Here is found samphire; and, in the breeding time, such numbers of sea-fowl, that it is hardly possible to avoid trampling upon their eggs when one goes ashore.</P>

the lord-warden, used to meet in parliament, as it is called, and make laws touching the mines and stanneries. As for the forest, it is a mountainous tract, twenty miles long and fourteen broad, where∣in above one hundred thousand sheep, besides black cattle, are fed in summer.</P>
<P>At Chudleigh was antiently a sanctuary, and a sumptuous palace belonging to the bishops of Exe∣ter, who were lords of the manor.</P>
<P>At Ledford, eighteen miles from Plymouth, the river Led, by being confined between rocks, has worked itself so deep a channel, that the water is seventy feet perpendicular below the bridge, and can hardly be either seen or heard from it, not∣withstanding it is level with the road. At about a mile from hence, in the same river, is a remark∣able fall or cataract, of the height of near one hundred feet.</P>
<P>Herty-point, in this county, is supposed to be the Herculis Promontorium of Ptolemy.</P>
<P>At North-Taunton is a pit ten feet deep, out of which there sometimes springs up a little brook, that continues to run for many days, and is thought by the common people to be a presage of some great calamity.</P>
<P>On the northern shore of the county is Mort, to which Sir William Tracy, one of those who slew Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, retired twenty-three years after the fact; contrary to what is asserted in the vulgar chronicles, that all who were concerned in that murder died miserably in three years after.</P>
<P>There were several other abbeys and priories in this county, besides those already mentioned; as Ford-abbey, Buckfastre-abbey, three miles from Ashburton, Otterly-priory, Buckland-priory, Fri∣thelstoke-priory, near Tonington, and Darling∣ton-temple,

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>Dorsetshire has the English channel on the south; Somersetshire and Wiltshire on the north; Hamp∣shire on the east; Devonshire, and some part of So∣mersetshire, on the west. It is between forty and fifty miles in length, from east to west, about thirty-four where broadest, and one hundred and fifty in circumference. It contains thirty-four hundreds, twenty-two market-towns, two hundred and forty-eight parishes, seven hundred and seventy-two thousand acres, and about one hundred and thirty-two thousand inhabitants.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>This county is pleasantly diversified with hills and valleys, and the air of both is healthy. It has an extensive sea-coast, along which the air is esteemed wholesome; is very fruitful in corn and pasture, the downs feeding an incredible num∣ber of sheep, and the lower grounds yielding rich pasture for black cattle. It produces a great deal of wool and woollen-cloth, hemp, flax, and linen, and is also well provided with materials for building and fuel, having quarries of excellent stone at Portland and Purbeck, with store of wood in Black-more-forest. Nor does it abound less with wild
<PB N="298" REF="3050"/>
and tame fowl, as well as sea and river fish, with the last of which it is plentifully supplied by the Frome, Stower, Piddle, Dulish, and Allen. On the rocks and coasts of the county are found sam∣phire and eringo; and Pool and Wareham afford the best tobacco-pipe clay. It lies in the diocese of Bristol, though that city is not in the county; but the archdeacon of Dorset has the whole eccle∣siastical jurisdiction. Besides two knights for the shire, two members are sent to parliament by each of the following towns: Dorchester, Lyme-Regis. Bridport, Weymouth, Melcombe-Regis, Wareham, Corfe-castle, Pool, and Shaftesbury.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Dorchester, the county-town, is very antient, for here the Romans had one of their principal stations; and a mile off is a camp with five trenches, enclosing ten acres, now called Maiden-castle, which is a most noble piece of antiquity. The town, called by Antoninus Dorovernia, is situated upon the river Frome, and consists chiefly of three spacious streets, which terminate towards the centre. There are few towns in England better paved and built. Here are three churches, a town-hall, shire-hall, a free-school, three alms-houses, and the county-gaol. The assizes and quarter-sessions are held in this town, and the knights of the shire are elected. It is noted for its excellent beer, and for the vast number of sheep fed upon the neigh∣bouring downs, which generally have two lambs at a time; and, on that account, are much valued all over England. The woollen manufacture and the malt-trade are much declined in this town; but its markets and fairs are well frequented, and the toll of both is vested in the corporation, which holds the manor as a fee-farm rent from the crown.
<PB N="299" REF="3060"/>
Some remains of the old Roman walls, and Iken∣ing-street, are still descernible; and, in the neigh∣bourhood, the ruins of an amphitheatre, where, as well as in other places about the town, Roman coins are often found, which they call Dorn money.</P>
<P>Lyme-Regis, or Kings-Lyme, is a sea-port at the mouth of the Lyme, from which it derives its name. The harbour and key are inferior to none in England, but very chargeable. The town has great privileges granted by several kings, as a court of hustings, freedom from tolls, lastage, &amp;c. The corporation consists of a mayor, a recorder, fifteen capital burgesses, two of whom, with the mayor, are justices, and a town-clerk. Its trade was formerly so great, that the customs, in some years, amounted to sixteen thousand pounds. The harbour, called the Cobb, lies about a quarter of a mile from the town; and there are some guns planted at proper places for the defence both of it and the town. The merchants here have some share in the pilchard fishery. The Bermudas or Summer islands took their name from Sir George Summers, a native of this town, and its represen∣tative in parliament in the reign of James I. and it was at this place the unfortunate duke of Mon∣mouth landed in 1685.</P>
<P>Bridport, or Burport, is a great thoroughfare, and had once a considerable trade, now greatly declined. It was, in particular, noted for its hemp and hempen manufactures; but, though there is still a great deal of that commodity raised in the neighbourhood, yet the trade is very much decayed. The corporation, who are lords of the borough under the king, and pay a small quit-rent into the exchequer, consists of two bailiffs, fifteen capital burgesses, a recorder, and town-clerk.
<PB N="300" REF="3070"/>
By their charter they have all fines, a power to hold lands and tenements, and other privi∣leges.</P>
<P>Weymouth, deriving its name from its situation at the mouth of the river Wey, is a very neat agreeable town, though it lies low. Melcombe-Regis, which stands on the opposite bank of the river, makes with it but one corporation, which sends as many members to parliament as London; every voter having, as in the capital, the privilege of polling for four persons. The corporation con∣sists of a mayor, recorder, two bailiffs, twenty-four capital burgesses; and every mayor is an al∣derman for life. Here is a custom-house and good key, but little trade, unless what is clandestine. Their fair trade is chiefly in wine, and fish brought from Newfoundland. The town gives title of viscount to the family of Thynne.</P>
<P>Melcombe-Regis, as we observed before, makes but one corporation with Weymouth, being situated upon the opposite bank of the river, and joined to it by a bridge. These towns were united into one corporation in the reign of James I. Mel∣combe has four tolerable streets, and is the most thriving and populous of the two; yet the port, which is said to be the most frequented in the county, and is defended by two castles, goes by the name of Weymouth.</P>
<P>Over against these towns lies what is called the isle of Portland, though it is in reality a penin∣sula, about seven miles round, and but thinly in∣habited; for though it yields plenty of corn and pasture for sheep, yet wood and other fewel is so scarce, that the inhabitants are forced to burn cow-dung dried in the sun. Its lofty rocks render it inaccessible on all sides except towards the north, where is a strong castle called Portland-castle; and on the opposite shore another, called Sands-foot.
<PB N="301" REF="3080"/>
The sea betwixt, on account of the strong current, is called Portland-race, and is very dangerous; but there are two lights to guide the mariner. From the east end of the island runs a bank of gravel and pebbles, near seven miles in length, cast up by the sea, at a little distance from the shore, and called Chesil-bank. In the narrow sea between, are several thousand swans belonging to the family of Horner. This island is remarkable for its quarries of fine white free-stone, of which great quantities are exported; and gives title of duke to the family of Bentinck, of Dutch extraction. The inhabi∣tants were famous slingers of old. Among the sea-weeds here is often found <HI>isidis placamon,</HI> i. e. Isis's hair, which is a sort of shrub produced by the sea, not unlike coral; it has no leaves, and when cut, changes colour, growing black, hard, and brittle.</P>
<P>Wareham. Here was antiently a castle and a noted harbour; in consequence of which it be∣came a large place, and had seventeen churches, which are now reduced to three, all served by one minister; for he preaches in the largest the sum∣mer half year, and in the other two by turns in winter. It is supposed to have risen on the decay of Stowborough, a small village in the neighbour∣hood, which was once governed by a mayor, but now by a bailiff. The royalty of the town was vested by general Erle in the corporation for ever, to put poor children out apprentices. The toll of the market also belongs to the corporation, which consists of a mayor, recorder, town-clerk, six ca∣pital burgesses, twelve common-council-men, and their assistants. The mayor is coroner not only of the town, but of the isles of Purbeck and Brans∣key. The chief dependence of the place is now upon the fine tobacco-pipe clay dug out of a hill in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="3090"/>
Corfe-castle stands in that spot which is called the Isle of Purbeck, though it is in reality only a peninsula. It took its name from a very strong castle, supposed to have been built by king Edgar; and had many privileges, such as an ex∣emption from toll, arrests, suit, or service with∣out the borough, granted first by queen Eliza∣beth, and confirmed by Charles II. The castle, which was demolished in the civil wars, appears to have been exceedingly strong and large, the ruins being near half a mile in circumference. The lord of this manor is, by inheritance, lieutenant of the isle, appoints all officers, determines by his bailiffs and deputies all actions, and is admiral of the coast. This isle is about ten miles long and six over; and is full of heaths, woods, and forests, abounding with deer. It is noted for its fine stone quarries and marble, of both which, especially the former, great quantities are exported.</P>
<P>Pool is surrounded every way with water, except to the north, where it is joined to the continent; and took its name from the bay below it, which, in a calm, looks like a standing water or pool. The decay of Wareham, and the act of parliament in the reign of Henry VI. transferring the franchises of Melcombe hither, contributed greatly to its growth and increase. It is now one of the most considerable ports in the west of England; and, in particular, has a large share in the Newfound∣land fishery: but its trade, as well as that of other towns on the coast, has suffered much by the high duties laid on French goods. The corpora∣tion consists of a mayor, alderman, bailiffs, and burgesses. The mayor is admiral and escheator within the town and liberty, and clerk of the mar∣ket. The town has divers other privileges granted by queen Elizabeth. Great quantities of Pur∣beck stone, of pickled oysters, and other fish,
<PB N="303" REF="3100"/>
and of corn, pease, and beans, are exported from hence.</P>
<P>Shaftesbury is pretty large, handsome, and po∣pulous, stands upon a hill, and is supposed to have been built by Alfred about the year 880. Here was antiently a famous monastery, besides ten churches. Water is so scarce in it, that the in∣habitants have been obliged to dig pits to save rain water, there being but two springs in the whole town, and these the property of private persons. It was incorporated by queen Eliza∣beth and king Charles II. and is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, bailiffs, and common∣council. From this town Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper took the title of earl in the twenty-fourth of Charles II.</P>
<P>These are all the parliamentary boroughs: of the other towns the most considerable are,</P>
<P>Blandford, an antient borough, governed by two bailiffs, chosen out of the capital burgesses, or aldermen. It hath been twice almost entirely destroyed by fire, first in queen Elizabeth's time, and again in the year 1731; but it hath been since rebuilt more beautiful than before, and gives the title of marquis to the duke of Marlborough. The town is chiefly employed in the manufacture of cloth, and malting. The adjoining downs of Burford are extremely pleasant, and full of coun∣try seats.</P>
<P>Winburn. Here is a collegiate church, a very noble edifice, one hundred and eighty feet in length, with a choir of singing men and boys. Antiently there was also a minster or monastery. The market for black cattle begins on Good-Friday, and lasts several weeks. There is a well endowed free-school in the town, and a manufacture of stockings; but the inhabitants, in general, are poor.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="3110"/>
Sherburn is a large town, and very antient. The number of its inhabitants is computed at ten thousand It was long an episcopal see, having had a succession of twenty-five bishops; but this see was removed in the eleventh century to Salis∣bury. The county went along with the see, till Henry VIII. made it a separate diocese, under the bishop of Bristol. The chief manufactures of the town are buttons, bone-lace, and haberdashery wares. The antient cathedral and abbey church, which is now parochial, is a most magnificent structure, and, besides other monuments, has those of the Saxon kings Ethelbald and Ethel∣bert. Here is a free-school, a fine alms-house, and antiently there was a castle in that part of the town still called Castle-town.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Besides those already taken notice of, there were three other famous abbies in this county, viz. those of Abbotsbury, Middleton, and Brindon. Middleton-abbey was founded by king Athelstan, by way of atonement for taking away both the life and crown of his brother Edwin. The manor of Brenston, near Blandford, was antiently held in grand serjeanty by this odd tenure, viz. by finding a man to go before the king's army for forty days when he should make war in Scotland, some records say in Wales, bare-headed and bare∣footed, in his shirt and linen drawers, holding in one hand a bow without a string, and in the other an arrow without feathers. In the parish of Win∣terborne, not far from Bridport, is a circular monument of stones, which seem to be petrified lumps like flint.</P>

In the champain part of the county, where it is clear of wood, the soil is very fertile, producing plenty of all sorts of grain. The county is extremely well wooded and watered; for besides many woods on private estates, in which there are vast quantities of well grown tim∣ber, there is the New-forest of great extent be∣longing to the crown, well stored with venerable oaks. In these woods and forests, great num∣bers of hogs run at large, and feed on the acorns; and hence it is, that the Hampshire bacon so far excels that of most other counties. With respect to water, it has the rivers Avon, Anton, Arle, Test, Stowre, and Itchin, besides many rivulets, all a∣bounding in fish, especially trout. As its sea-coast is of a considerable extent, it possesses many good ports and harbours, and is well supplied with salt-water fish. Much honey is produced in the county, and a great deal of mead and metheglin made. Here is also plenty of game, and on the downs is most delightful hunting. The manufacture of cloth and kersies in this county, tho' not so extensive as that of some others, yet is far from being inconsi∣derable,
<PB N="307" REF="3140"/>
and employs great numbers of the poor, as well as contributes to the enriching of the manufacturers by what is sent abroad.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Winchester, the capital, is a very antient city; for it is supposed to have been built several cen∣turies before Christ. The Romans called it Venta Belgarum, the Britons Caer Givent, and the Saxons Wittanceaster, whence came the present name. It stands upon the river Itchin, in a bot∣tom surrounded with chalky-hills, and is generally allowed to have been a considerable place in the time of the Romans. Some of the first converts to Christianity are supposed to have lived here. In the castle, near the west-gate, many of the Saxon kings antiently kept their court. In the hall, where the assizes are kept, is shewn a round table of one piece of wood, which, it is pretended, is above twelve hundred years old, and was that at which king Arthur, with his knights, used to carouse: but Cambden says, it plainly ap∣pears to be of a much more modern date. There is an inscription in Saxon characters upon it, which is now illegible, said to be the names of his twenty-four knights. The cathedral was founded by Kenegulfe, a king of the Mercians; but there were many Christians, and places for their worship here, long before that period. Kine∣wal, or Kenwalchius, the son of Kenegulfe, trans∣lated the see of Sherburn hither, and made Wina, a Frenchman, the first bishop; who, falling after∣wards under the displeasure of Kinewal, purchased the see of London of Wulphire, king of Mer∣cia, and is reckoned the first simoniacal bishop in England. Here Egbert I. sole monarch of England, was crowned; and not long after Swithin, one of the bishops of this see, was canonized.
<PB N="308" REF="3150"/>
We are told by the monkish writers, that near this town a single combat was fought between Colbrand, a Danish giant, and Guy, earl of Warwick. An∣other of the bishops of this see was Denewulf, whom Alfred preferred to it, tho' he had been a swine-herd, after he had acquired a sufficient stock of learning, as a reward for having concealed him from the Danes. A monastery was built here by Edward the Elder, and richly endowed by him and his successors. Edward the Confessor was crowned in this place by Edsius, archbishop of Canterbury. At that time Alwyn was bishop of this see; but was confined to a monastery on suspi∣cion of a criminal correspondence with queen Emma; from which he was discharged upon the queen's clearing herself by ordeal. By way of thanksgiving to St. Swithin for her deliverance, the queen gave nine manors to his church. Wal∣kelin, the next bishop, laid the foundation of the present cathedral. William the Conqueror kept his court here; and at this place he beheaded Waltheof, the great Saxon earl of Northumber∣land. He not only confined for life in the castle, but put out the eyes of Ederic, another Saxon earl, because he had delivered up the castle of York to Edgar Atheling. Giffard, the next bishop, to terminate the quarrels between the monks of the old and new minsters, removed the latter to Hyde, in this neighbourhood, where he had built an abbey for their reception. His successor was Henry of Blois, brother to king Stephen, who reduced the empress Maud to such straits in this city and castle, that she caused a report to be spread of her death, and was carried out in a coffin. The bishop, after his return, founded and endowed the hospital of St. Cross, about a mile to the south of this city, and built the bishop's palace called Wolvesey. Here Henry
<PB N="309" REF="3160"/>
II. held a parliament, and was crowned with his queen. When Godfrey Lucy, son to Richard, lord chief justice of England, and governor of the castle, was bishop, Richard II. granted a charter, with very ample privileges, to the citizens. King John resided in this city; and his son Henry III. was born there. Peter de la Roche, another of its bishops, was lord chief justice, and governor of the kingdom, in the minority of Henry III. In his time Henry the Lion, duke of Bavaria, with his duchess Matilda, daughter of Henry II. re∣sided at Winchester, where their son William, duke of Bavaria, was born. Henry III. kept his Christmas here in 1239, when Raleigh was bishop. When the barons rose, the city was taken, and all the Jews in the town put to the sword; but the earl of Leicester, whose son had taken it, being slain, it was recovered by the king. After the murder of Edward II. his uncle, Edmund Plan∣tagenet, was beheaded at the castle-gate of this city. <Q>William Edendon, bishop of this see, being elected archbishop of Canterbury, refused it, saying, “If Canterbury is the higher rack, Win∣chester is the better manger.”</Q> This bishop, who had been treasurer of England, was buried in an alabaster tomb on the south-side of the entrance into the choir. He was succeeded by the famous Wil∣liam of Wickham, so denominated from a village near this place, who became prime minister to Edw. III. He procured a charter, by which this city was made a staple for wool; and founded a college called St. Mary's, which he endowed with a liberal main∣tenance for a warden, ten fellows, two masters, se∣venty scholars, three chaplains, three clerks, an or∣ganist, and sixteen choristers, to which he granted great privileges. The college consists of two courts, in which are lodgings for the masters and scholars, &amp;c. a large hall, chapel, schools, and a library. After a certain time of continuance in the school, the scho∣lars,
<PB N="310" REF="3170"/>
if they chuse to prosecute their studies, have exhibitions for that purpose in New-college, Ox∣ford, which was also founded by Wickham. The same prelate built also the nave of the church, and obtained the offices of chancellor to the archbishop of Canterbury, and prelate of the garter, to be an∣nexed to this see. <Q>Besides these donations, he ex∣pended twenty thousand marks in the repair of houses, mended the highways from hence to London, built several free-schools and hospitals both in this county and Surry, all which have his coat of arms on them, with this motto, “Manners make the man.”</Q> Henry IV. was married in this city; and Henry V. gave audience in it to the French ambassadors who came to implore peace. The bishop at that time was Henry de Beaufort, uncle to the king, who was thrice chancellor of the king∣dom, a cardinal, and general of the pope's forces against the Bohemians. He founded an hospital here, left legacies to all the cathedrals of England, and lies buried in a fine tomb in the church, in which he is represented in his cardinal's robes and hat. Arthur, eldest son of Henry VII. was born in this city in 1486. Waynfleet, bishop of this see, founded Magdalen college in Oxford. One of his successors, Richard Fosse, collected the bones of Kengulfe, Kinulphus, Egbert, Edmund, Canute, queen Emma, William Rufus, and his brother Richard, which had been dispersed in the civil wars, deposited them in leaden chests, and interred them at the foot of the great wall of the choir. In 1554 queen Mary was married in this city to Philip of Spain, and the chair used on that occa∣sion is still preserved. In her reign the persecuting Gardiner was bishop of this see. One of his suc∣cessors was Cooper, author of the Thesaurus, which bears his name. Mr. Trussel, who continued Daniel's History of England, wrote a History of all its bishops and bishoprics, a particular description
<PB N="311" REF="3180"/>
of this city, and the occurrences therein, with the origin of cities in general, was bred at Winchester school. Morley, who was bishop of this see after the Restoration, built a new episcopal palace, and a college for ten ministers widows, which he en∣dowed with a good revenue. In his time, a palace was began, and almost finished here by Ch. II, which is now going to ruins. In the monastery at Hyde was a cross, the gift of Canute the Dane, which cost him one year's revenue of all England. When the monks were ejected out of the other convent dedicated to the Holy Trinity, they were succeed∣ed by a dean and twelve prebendaries. The cathe∣dral is a large pile, and has a venerable look, but is not very elegant. Besides the tombs, there are many curious pieces of workmanship in it, the chief of which are, 1st, The font, erected in the time of the Saxons. 2d, Copper statues of James I. and Charles I. 3d, The bishop's throne. 4th, The stalls' of the dean and prebendaries. 5th, The ascent to the choir and altar. 6th, The pavement, in∣laid with marble of diverse colours, in various figures. 7th, The altar-piece, reckoned the noblest in England. 8th, The paintings in the windows, especially the great east window. At the hospital of the Holy Cross mentioned above, every travel∣ler that knocks at the door may claim a manchet of white bread and a cup of beer, of which a great quantity is provided every day for that purpose. This hospital was intended for the maintenance of a master and thirty pensioners, but only fourteen are now maintained in it; and the master enjoys a revenue of eight hundred pounds a year. This city is about a mile and a half in compass, and almost surrrounded with a wall of flint, has six gates, large suburbs, broad clean streets; but the private houses are, in general, but ordinary, many of them being very old. The city is interspersed with
<PB N="312" REF="3190"/>
a great many gardens, which contribute to its beau∣ty and healthiness. There is a great deal of good company in the city and neighbourhood, and many clergymen, but little trade or manufacture. Many other public edifices, besides those we have men∣tioned, adorn this city, particularly an infirmary, an hospital called St. John's, and the guildhall. The corporation consists of a mayor, high-stewad, recor∣der, aldermen, two coroners, two bailiffs, twenty∣four common-council-men, a town-clerk, four con∣stables, and four serjeants at mace, and the city gives title of marquis to the duke of Bolton. A Roman highway leads from hence to Alton, and went formerly, as it is thought, from thence to London. The charming downs in the neigh∣bourhood contribute greatly to the health and pleasure of the inhabitants. The river Itchin is navigable for barges from hence to Southampton.</P>
<P>Southampton stands between two rivers at the bottom of a bay, called Southampton water, which is so deep, that it will carry ships of five hundred tons up to the town. Great quantities of timber are brought down both the rivers to this town, whence it is conveyed to Portsmouth. A little to the east, where St. Mary's hamlet is now situated, stood antiently the Roman town Clausentum, the ruins of which are still visible; and Roman coins are often found about it. This town was afterwards called Hamtun, and was plundered and burnt by the French in the reign of Edward III. but an∣other soon arose in the place where the pre∣sent Southampton stands, which Richard II. sur∣rounded with walls, building also a castle for the defence of it and the harbour. The wall consists of those little white shells that grow on the backs of oysters Here Henry V. mustered his army before his first expedition to France; and here Philippa, wife to Edward III. founded an hospi∣tal, called God's-house; and Henry VII. a monas∣tery.
<PB REF="3200"/>

<PB N="313" REF="3210"/>
The town has one of the longest and broadest streets in England, and a very fine key. Its trade seems to have been more considerable for∣merly than it is at present. Most of that carried on now is with Jersey and Guernsey, besides which, there is a little with France and Portugal for wine, and to Newfoundland for fish. The town was made a corporation by Henry II. and king John; and a county of itself by Henry VI. and a fort, called the tower, on which some cannon are mounted, was erected by Henry VIII. near the key. The town had its last charter from Charles II. Here is a custom-house and a collector, with a free-school. The mayor of the town is admiral of the coast from South-sea to Hurst-castle. The assizes for the county are usually held here.</P>
<P>Portsmouth is the chief harbour and station of the royal navy, and the key of England. It stands at the entrance of a creek, in the isle of Portsey, which is about fourteen miles in compass, sur∣rounded at high tides by the sea, and joined to the continent by a bridge. There was formerly a town nearer the bottom of the creek, where Ves∣pasian is said to have landed, called by Ptolemy, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. the great harbour; and by our ancestors Portperes and Portchester; but the sea retiring from it, the inhabitants removed to the spot on which Portsmouth now stands. The town was a place of some note in the reign of Richard II. for the inhabitants then fitted out a small fleet, with which they defeated the French. Two forts were built at the entrance of the harbour by Edward IV. and Henry VII. placed a garrison in it; queen Fliza∣beth made great additions to the fortifications, which have been so improved and augmented since, that it is almost impregnable. Here are all the materials and conveniencies for building, re∣pairing, rigging, arming, victualling, and com∣pletely equipping ships of all rates, from the least
<PB N="314" REF="3220"/>
to the greatest: it is amazing to see the immense quantities of military and naval stores. The num∣ber of men employed in the yard, is never less than a thousand. In short, the docks and yards, with dwelling-houses for the commissioner and all the subordinate officers and master-workmen, appear like a distinct town. Here king Charles II. met the infanta of Portugal, whom he had espoused. Though the situation of the town is low and aguish, the streets dirty, provisions, lodgings, and fuel dear, fresh water scarce; yet, so great is the resort of soldiers and seamen, especially in time of war, that the inns and taverns are perpetually crouded. A sufficient number of troops are kept in garrison, which is considerably augmented in war-time. A commissioner presides over the yard, a governor or deputy-governor over the garrison; and a mayor, aldermen, and burgesses over the town, under the governor. Here is a noble ar∣senal; and a thousand sail of ships may ride safe in the harbour, the mouth of which is secured on the Gosport side, by four forts, and a platform of twenty great guns level with the water; and on the other side by South-sea castle. As Portsmouth does not admit of any enlargement of buildings, a sort of suburb has been lately begun on the ad∣joining heath, which increases so fast, that it bids fair soon to outstrip the town itself, both in num∣ber of inhabitants and beauty of buildings. In the dock-yard is a royal academy of much the same nature as that of Woolwich. In July, 1760, a most dreadful fire broke out in the dock-yard, supposed to be occasioned by lightning, in which were con∣sumed prodigious quantities of naval stores of all kinds, to an immense value.</P>
<P>Gosport is a large town of great trade. Here strangers who visit Portsmouth generally lodge, and most of the sailors wives live. It is situated in respect of Portsmouth, much in the same manner as South∣wark
<PB N="315" REF="3230"/>
to London, only there is no bridge betwixt the former; but boats are continually passing.</P>
<P>Five miles from hence lies Southwick, where was the seat of colonel Norton, who made that extraordinary will, by which he left a personal estate of sixty thousand pounds, and a real one of six thousand pounds a year to the poor, hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, wounded, prisoners, and strangers, to the end of the world. But upon ex∣amination, it carried such strong marks of insanity, that it was set aside. The situation of the house is low and wet; but the park rises from the house to the highest point of Portsdown, whence there is one of the finest and most extensive prospects in England, taking in the South-downs, Portsmouth∣town and harbour, the Isle of Wight, and a great extent of sea to the south-east. Along this coast, salt is made of the sea-water, which at first is of a pale green, but by boiling turns to a pure white.</P>
<P>Petersfield is a pretty large town on the road from London to Portsmouth. By virtue of a charter from queen Elizabeth, and others of an earlier date, it is a corporation, by the stile of mayor, burgesses, and commonalty; yet the mayor is now chosen at the court-leet of the lord of the manor.</P>
<P>Stockbridge, though a borough by prescription, and a great thoroughfare, is but a poor mean place. It was represented in parliament by Sir Richard Steele, when he was expelled the house in queen Anne's reign. The knight is said to have made use of a very diverting expedient to carry his election: at an entertainment he made for the electors and their wives, he stuck an apple full of guineas, and declared it should be the prize of that man, whose wife should be first brought to-bed after that day nine months. The women were so
<PB N="316" REF="3240"/>
pleased with the fancy, that they all engaged their husbands to vote for Sir Richard; and he was ac∣cordingly returned. The town is governed by a bailiff, constable, and serjeants. The bailiff is the returning officer, and commonly an inn-keeper, or the dependent of one. Wheelwrights and car∣penters make a great part of the inhabitants of the town, which is supposed to be the Brige or Brage of Antoninus.</P>
<P>Near this town are three villages of the name of Wallop, the Upper, Middle, and Nether; and a river on which the villages stand. We mention them here only on account of their giv∣ing name and title of baron to the antient and ho∣nourable family of the earl of Portsmouth, one of whose ancestors, in 1513, fitted out some ships, with which he burnt twenty-one towns in Nor∣mandy, and all the French ships in the ports of Naples and Tripoly, by way of reprisal for piracies committed on the English by that nation.</P>
<P>Christ-church took its name from its church, which was antiently collegiate, and dedicated to the holy Trinity; but Ralph Hammond, bishop of Durham, who had been dean of it, changed the name of Trinity to that of Christ, when he rebuilt it. From its standing between two rivers, the Avon and Stour, near their conflux, it had at first the name of Twinambourne. It is a large popu∣lous borough, and had antiently a castle built by Richard de Redvers, earl of Devonshire, in the time of Henry I. The Avon was made navigable from hence to Salisbury, about the year 1680. The manufactures of the town are chiefly silk∣stockings and gloves. Though its foreign trade is inconsiderable, it is well furnished with officers of the customs. On the town's seal is the figure of Baldwin de Revers, from whom it had its first pri∣vileges,
<PB N="317" REF="3250"/>
and who lived in the time of king Ste∣phen.</P>
<P>Lymington is a sea-port town at the entrance of the bay of Southampton, and is a corporation by prescription, consisting of a mayor, aldermen, and burgesses. The mayor is chosen by the burgesses, and sworn in at the court of the lord of the manor. A great quantity of salt is made here, and most of that which is used in the southern parts, is brought from hence, either by land or water. The salt is said to be exceeding good for preserving flesh. Merchant-ships and small craft are built at this town, the situation of which is healthy and plea∣sant, as it stands on a hill, and commands a prospect of the sea and the Isle of Wight. It gives title of viscount to Wallop, earl of Portsmouth.</P>
<P>Hurst-castle, which was built by Henry VIII. for the defence of New-forest, stands at the extre∣mity of a neck of land, whence is the shortest pas∣sage to the Isle of Wight. It is mounted with cannon, and has a small garrison. Hither king Charles I. was brought from the Isle of Wight, and confined three weeks. The place is so un∣healthy, that the garrison is often obliged to shift its quarters. This, with Calshot-castle, a little more to the east, and those of St. Andrew's and Netley, command the sea all along this coast, and perfectly secure the entrance of the bay of Southampton.</P>
<P>Whitchurch is but a mean town, though it has a great road lying through it, and a manufacture of shalloons, serges, and other articles of the woollen manufacture. The mayor is chosen annu∣ally at the court of the dean and chapter of Win∣chester, who are lords of the manor. Its situa∣tion on the edge of the forest of Chute, makes it very pleasant.</P>
<P>Andover, a large handsome town, and a great thoroughfare, standing pleasantly on the side of
<PB N="318" REF="3260"/>
the downs on the river Aude, was made a corpora∣tion by queen Elizabeth, but had its first charter from king John. Here was antiently a college of Benedictine monks; and now there is a free-school, charity-school, and hospital, with a great manufacture of shalloons and malt. In the neigh∣bourhood, at a poor mean village, called Weyhill, is one of the greatest fairs in England for hops, cheese, and sheep.</P>
<P>As the other parliamentary boroughs are situated in the Isle of Wight, we shall forbear describing them till we come to that isle; and proceed to the other remarkable places of the county upon the continent.</P>
<P>Ringwood stands on the river Avon, and is a large thriving place, in consequence of its manu∣factures of druggets, narrow cloths, stockings, and leather; besides which it has a good market for corn and cattle. Near this place, the duke of Monmouth was found in a ditch, covered with fern, after the battle of Sedgemoor.</P>
<P>Rumsey is a pretty large antient town, pleasantly situated. It had formerly a monastery of monks, which was afterwards converted into a nunnery; and of which Mary, only daughter of king Ste∣phen, was some time abbess. Matthew of Alsace, son to the earl of Flanders, privately conveyed away this lady, who was a nun, and married her; but after he had two children by her, was fain to send her back. In the old church here, king Ed∣ward and his son Afred, were interred. This town is a corporation, has a manufacture of cloth, and was the birth-place of Sir William Petty, ancestor of the earls of Shelburne.</P>
<P>Arlesford is governed by a bailiff and eight burgesses, and has a good market for sheep. It was burnt down in 1610, but hath been since re∣built in a better manner. Part of the Roman high∣way,
<PB N="319" REF="3270"/>
which passes by this town towards London, serves for the head of a pond or little lake near the town.</P>
<P>Basingstoke is very antient, large, populous, and a great thoroughfare. This town has a market, much frequented, for corn of all sorts; and a great quantity of malt is made in it. Here, in 871, the Danes defeated king Etheldred. The manufactures of druggets, shalloons, and other woollen stuffs, have been carried on here lately with great success. The town is a corporation; and besides a church, has a very handsome chapel built by the first lord Sandys, and a free-school. In the neighbourhood stood old Basing-house, a fa∣mous fortress in the time of the civil wars. The marquis of Winchester, ancestor of the duke of Bolton, with a resolute band of veterans, bid de∣fiance in it for a long time to the parliament∣forces; but at last it was taken by storm by Crom∣well, and burnt to the ground. The late duke built a house out of the ruins.</P>
<P>Odiham lies a little to the east of Basingstoke, is a town corporate, and had antiently a royal palace, and a castle so strong, that thirteen men defended it for a fortnight against the dauphin and the barons in king John's time. The town be∣longed antiently to the bishop of Winchester; and was the birth place of Lilly, the famous gram∣marian. It is but a small place, though it lies on the great western road.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>At Silchester, a poor village, or rather farm-house, on the borders of Berkshire, stood the an∣tient Vendomia, or Vendonum. Besides other remains, the walls may be traced quite round. A little without the walls, to the north-east, where
<PB N="320" REF="3280"/>
is now a yard for cattle and a horse-pond, was an∣tiently an amphitheatre.</P>
<P>At Kingsclere, a pleasant town, was formerly the seat of the Saxon kings, as the name seems to import; and about a mile from it is an old square camp, with some remains of a large building, said to have been a castle. Farther off, on a hill, called Laddle-hill, is another ancient encamp∣ment.</P>
<P>On St. Catharine's hill also, near Winchester, is a camp; and another near West-Woodhay, on the edge of Berkshire.</P>
<P>In this county lies New-forest, within the limits of which were antiently many towns, villages, and churches, till they were destroyed by William the Conqueror, to make room for deer and other game, and for the exercise and diversion of hunt∣ing. Two of his sons, Richard, and William Rufus, afterwards king, as well as Henry, his grandson, by his eldest son Robert, lost their lives in it, Ru∣fus, by an arrow shot at a deer by Walter Tyrrel, his bow-bearer; Richard, by a pestilential blast; and Henry, by being caught by the head in the boughs of a tree, while he was hunting. The of∣ficers of the forest are a warden, who is always a person of the first rank, nine keepers, who have the care of nine walks, into which the forest is divided, two rangers, and a bow-bearer. The three last offices are always held by some of the neigh∣bouring gentry.</P>

<HEAD>The ISLE of WIGHT.</HEAD>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This island was by the antient Britons called Guith, which signifies a separation, or land sepa∣rated from the continent, whence the Romans formed Vecta, Vectus, and Vectesis; and, as the Germans always change the V into a W, the Ro∣man name was converted into Wecta, Wect, and at last into Wight. It stretches along a part of the Hampshire coast, to which county it belongs, and from which it is divided by a very narrow channel, especially that part opposite to Hurst-castle. This channel was antiently called Solent, and is re∣markable for the violence and rapidity of its tides. The isle is of an oval form, its length from east to west is twenty miles, its greatest breadth twelve, and its circumference sixty. The most easterly point is opposite to Portsmouth, and the most westerly to Christ-church. It is encompassed with rocks, of which the most noted are the Needles, the Shingles, the Brambles, and the Mixen; the last are so called from their filth, the word in the
<PB N="322" REF="3300"/>
Saxon signifying a dunghill, as the needles are so denominated from their sharpness. The sea breaks so far into the island on the north side, that it is al∣most divided into two; and that part which lies to the east of the inlet is actually called Binbridge; and that to the west, Freshwater isle. It lies in the diocese of Winchester, contains fifty-two pa∣rishes, four market towns, of which three send members to parliament, viz. Newport, Yarmouth, and Newton, four castles, and near thirty thousand inhabitants. They have a well-disciplined militia of their own, besides which three thousand of the Hampshire, and two thousand of the Wilt∣shire militia, are obliged to assist them in case of need. Where the island is accessible, which is but in few places, there are castles built for its defence; and in time of war, beacons are set up to give notice of the approach of an enemy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is exceeding healthy, and the inhabi∣tants, in consequence, vigorous and long-lived. The soil is so sertile, that one years crop is gene∣rally enough to serve the inhabitants seven. The hills that run across the isle, yield the finest pas∣ture for sheep, whose wool is highly valued, and therefore turns much to the advantage of the in∣habitants; nor is the isle destitute of meadow for hay and pasture, nor of wild and tame fowl, hares, rabbits, and deer. Here also is found a fine white clay and sand, of the former of which to∣bacco-pipes are made, and of the latter drinking-glasses.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>The Romans subdued it about the year 45; after them it was subject to the West Saxons till the
<PB N="323" REF="3310"/>
year 650, when it was reduced by the Mercians, but recovered afterwards by the West Saxons. In 1012 king Ethelred passed the winter here, when he was expelled his kingdom by Swain, king of Denmark; and in the spring went over to Nor∣mandy. Tosti, Harold's brother, plundered it with the help of some Flemish pirates. Its first lord, after the Conquest, was William Fitzosborn. His son having forfeited it by treason, it was given by Edward I. to Richard de Redvers, earl of Devon, in whose family it continued, till it was sold to Henry I. for six thousand marks; after which the lordship of the isle remained in the crown two hundred years. A family, called from it de Insula, or L'Isle, has long been eminent both here and upon the continent. King Richard II. granted it to the duke of York and his heirs; as did Henry VI. to Philippa, duchess of York, for life, in lieu of a portion, and the reversion to Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, who, dying with∣out issue, the same Henry made his favourite, Henry de Beauchamp, king of Wight, and of Jersey and Guernsey. He dying without issue, Edward IV. made Richard, lord Woodville, his father-in-law, lord of the isle of Wight, in whose family it continued, till Henry VII. granted it for life to Sir Reginaldo Bray, on condition of paying three hundred and eight pounds yearly to the crown. The French have often attempted to get possession of it, but without success, particularly in the reign of Richard II. and in those of Henry IV. and VIII. The only circumstance since that period worth mentioning in regard to this island, is the im∣prisonment of Charles I. in Carisbrooke-castle, during eight months, when colonel Hammond was governor; and the reaty carried on between this king, and the commissioners of the par∣liament. The governor is always a person of
<PB N="324" REF="3320"/>
rank, and has under his command the governors of the forts and castles of the island.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Newport was antiently called Medena and Novus Burgus de Meden; whence the adjacent country, to the east and west, is still called East and West Meden. It was a borough by prescription, with the title of bailiffs and burgesses, till king James I. incorporated it by charter. The town is large and populous, clean and well-built. It stands on a river, which falls into the sea at Cowes, and is navigable from thence by barges. It did not send members to parliament till the reign of queen Elizabeth. The town has been much improved of late in beauty, extent, trade, and convenience; and is at present a very flourishing place. The church, though a large building, is only a chapel of ease to Carisbrooke, which is now but a small village on a lofty eminence, about a mile from Newport, though formerly a considerable town. The castle is very antient, having been first built by Whitgar, to whom Cerdic, the West Saxon king, gave it. Its antiquity, curiosities, and ex∣tensive prospect, render it well worth the attention of a traveller. Alexander Ross, who continued Sir Walter Raleigh's History, and is burlesqued in Hudibras, was vicar of this village.</P>
<P>Yarmouth, which, to distinguish it from the other of that name in Norfolk, is called South Yarmouth, stands on a creek on the north side of the island. It is a corporation, has handsome houses, built mostly of free-stone, and a castle with a garrison.</P>
<P>Newton is also a corporation, has a convenient haven, and sends members to parliament; never∣theless, it is but an inconsiderable place, standing
<PB N="325" REF="3330"/>
in a creek on the same side of the island as the former.</P>
<P>Cowes is the name of two towns at the mouth of the river, but on opposite sides. West Cowes has a castle with a garrison, and is a very flourish∣ing town. At East Cowes vessels of considerable burthen are built. Ships rendezvous here to wait for convoys, and take in fresh provision; but ly∣ing low, neither of them is esteemed wholesome.</P>
<P>St. Helen's lies at the east end of the island, and is remarkable only for its fine road, large enough to contain the whole navy of England. A bay runs up from hence a great way into the land. Not far from this place, are</P>
<P>Sandown and Sharpnore-castles, both of which have governors and garrisons. The first is on the bay of the same name; and the other on the turning to the west from the rocks called the Needles.</P>

<HEAD>JERSEY, GUERNSEY, ALDERNEY, and SARK.</HEAD>
<P>These isles are all that remains to the crown of England of the duchy of Normandy. As they lie over against Hampshire, tho' near the coast of France, and are now in the diocese of Win∣chester, as they were formerly in that of Coutance in Normandy, it is proper to treat of them here.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="327" REF="3350"/>
<HEAD>JERSEY,</HEAD>
<P>Lying four leagues from the nearest part of Normandy, and twenty-five from the nearest coast of England, was called by the Romans Caesarea, from which the modern name has been formed; Jer being a contraction of Caesar, and Ey signify∣ing an island. It is in length about twelve miles, breadth where widest about six, and thirty in circumference. A great part of it is surrounded by rocks and shelves, often fatal to mariners. The cliffs on the north side are very high, but the south is much lower, and almost level with the water. Both the hilly and low grounds are very fertile, producing all manner of trees, roots, and herbs, especially apple-trees; but no corn enough to sup∣ply the inhabitants. This want of corn is attributed chiefly to their laying out too much of their land in orchards; for there is no place in the world of the same extent, which produces so much cyder. The hills are so thick planted with trees, that the island looks at a distance like a forest. As most of these are fruit trees, and the island produces nei∣ther coal nor peat, there is a want of wood for fuel; instead of which the poor people are forced to dry and burn a sea-weed, called Vraic, which is thrown up by the sea in great quantities upon the beach, rocks, and little isles, that surround the great one. They not only use it for fuel but to manure their ground, either when reduced to ashes, or in its natural state. The isle is extremely well watered, having springs even upon the highest hills. There is a tract of land which has been rendered quite useless by the sand thrown upon it by the west winds, which are sometimes very boisterous. Here is plenty of cattle and sheep, horses, hares, and rabbits. The sheep are small,
<PB N="328" REF="3360"/>
as well as the black cattle; but the wool of the for∣mer, and the flesh of both, is very fine. The sheep have sometimes six horns. There is also great plenty of fowl, wild and tame, especially sea-fowl. Among the latter are soland geese and barnacles; and among the former partridges, which have feathers of various colours, and are extremely beautiful. Besides the several kinds of fish caught upon the English coast, they have some peculiar to their own. The reverend Mr. Talle, who was rector of a parish here in king William's time, tells us that there is a fish seen about the isle, with teats like a woman's, called a mermaid. The in∣habitants use no malt liquors; cyder, wine, and brandy, being very plentiful and cheap. The butter is very good, and the honey excellent. The fields are inclosed with mounds of earth, six, eight, or ten feet high, and proportionably thick. The air of the island is very healthy, and the winters are milder, but more windy than in Eng∣land. Those of the inhabitants, who are tempe∣rate, live to a great age; but luxury being more prevalent here than formerly, has brought in distempers unknown to their ancestors. The houses in the island are generally of stone, of which there is great plenty. There is one sort called montmado stone, which is of a reddish white, and may be cut and shaped like Portland stone. Another sort used by them is of a bluish white, brought from the French island Chause, and is of a fine grain; but they have their lime and slate either from France or England. They carry on a very considerable trade not only with France and England, but also with Spain, and send sometimes near thirty sail of ships to Newfoundland. The chief manufacture of the island is stockings, of which a vast number is knit here by the women and children. A great part of the wool they use
<PB N="329" REF="3370"/>
comes from England; two thousand tods, uncomb∣ed, being allowed them by act of parliament. As estates, both real and personal, are equally divided among sons and daughters, there are few great ones; but as no taxes are paid upon home con∣sumption, and the necessaries of life in general are cheap, a small estate is of more value here than in most other places. The language generally spoken is French; but there are few people of fashion that cannot speak English too. The prin∣cipal families are of Norman extraction, with a few Welch and English. Gentlemen possessed of manors are addressed, as in France, by the name of their seigneuries.</P>
<P>At first there was but one governor for all those isles, who appointed the bailiffs; but since Henry VII. Jersey has had a distinct governor, and the bailiffs have been appointed by the crown. The governor is continued during the pleasure of the sovereign, and is allowed the whole revenue of the island for the support of his dignity, except a small deduction for the salaries and fees of the civil officers. The governor is vested with the whole military power, and the bailiff and jurats with the civil and judicial, under certain limita∣tions. The governor, with the concurrence of two jurats, may arrest and imprison any man on suspicion of treason. No inhabitant can go out of the island, nor foreigner settle in it, without his knowledge and consent. No convention of estates can be held, nor, in short, any thing of impor∣tance transacted, without his consent. All the castles and garrisons, together with militia, are en∣tirely under his command. The principal fortress is Elizabeth castle, where the lieutenant-governor resides, for the chief governor is generally absent. The militia consists of two troops of horse, and five regiments of foot, with a train of twenty-five
<PB N="330" REF="3380"/>
brass field pieces. At every place round the island accessible to an enemy, are guard-houses, with batteries of cannon. The bailiff and twelve jurats are chosen by the people, by whom they are commonly stiled justiciers, but have no salary. The bailiff has the disposal of all the places of the officers belonging to the high-court of justice, ex∣cept that of the attorney-general. He presides in the court, pronounces sentence, and upon an equal division of the bench, has the casting vote. The jurats are his assessors. This court takes cognizance of all causes arising within the island, treason excepted; but in civil causes an appeal lies to the privy council; and in case of murder, where malice prepense does not appear evident to the court, they must not proceed to sentence, till the fact is laid before his majesty, and his pleasure is known. Seven of the jurats constitute a court, and the terms are only three. There is another called a constable, who is one of the chief persons of his parish, and his office generally triennial. He represents his parish in the convention of estates, and presides in every parish assembly for secular affairs; but in matters relating to the church, the minister is president.</P>
<P>The assembly called the convention of estates of his majesty's island of Jersey, is composed of the jurats, clergy, and constables. It is not deemed a convention, unless seven are present from each of the three bodies; nor can it be called without the consent of the magistrates and governor, the latter of whom has a negative voice. This assem∣bly naturalizes foreigners, raises supplies for the public service, states and audits the accounts of pub∣lic receipts and expences, determines differences about the disposal and management of the church treasury, examines all proposals and schemes for the public benefit, appoints deputies to solicit the
<PB N="331" REF="3390"/>
affairs of the island at the king's court, makes or∣dinances against the profaners of the Lord's day, blasphemers, common-swearers, drunkards, and riotous and disorderly persons. The inhabitants enjoy many valuable privileges, having been de∣clared by several royal charters a free people, to be treated not as aliens and foreigners, but as na∣tive Englishmen, throughout the king's dominions, and exempted, as a peculiar of the crown, from all taxes imposed by parliament.</P>
<P>The island is supposed to have been first con∣verted to Christianity by St. Magloire, a Briton, who quitted a bishopric to turn evangelist. In the popish times, besides the stately abbey of St. Hilier, situated where now is the lower ward of Elizabeth's-castle, there were four priories, twelve parish churches, which still remain, and above twenty chapels, some of which are now in ruins. At the reformation many protestant ministers fled thither from persecution in France, and entirely overturned popery. As for the ecclesiastical go∣vernment, it is subject to the bishop of Winches∣ter, whose commissary, called a dean, in conjunc∣tion with any two or three of the rectors, holds a spiritual court, from which an appeal lies to the bishop, or, if that see is vacant, to the archbishop of Canterbury. Here are no pluralities; and tho' the tythes and surplice fees are inconsiderable, the glebes are good, and the parsonage-houses kept in constant repair by the respective parishes. There are two grammar-schools pretty well endowed, and so situated as to suffice for the whole island, which are under the direction of the dean and ministers. The churches are large Gothic structures, with lofty spires and arched stone-roofs, which are covered with slate, laid in a bed of strong mortar. The highways in the island are kept in good order, and there are surveyors in each tithing to take
<PB N="332" REF="3400"/>
care of them. Every year, about Midsummer, the magistrates, attended by the constables, pe∣rambulate them, to see that they are not neglected, or incroached upon. Jersey gives title of earl to lord viscount Villiers.</P>
<P>The island is divided into twelve parishes, each having a communication with the sea.</P>
<P>The parish of St. Owen's is remarkable for be∣ing a royal fief, and for many hundred years the estate of the noble family of Carteret. This fa∣mily, of which the chief branch is now ennobled by the title of earl of Granville, is very eminent in this island, and has been for many ages. They took their name from the lordship of Carteret in Normandy, which belonged to the family, till they lost it by their adherence to the kings of England, when Normandy was reunited to the crown of France in 1204. They have a great estate in this island, and the whole isle of Sark, paying only fifty shillings a-year out of it to the crown, of which it is held in capite. St. Ouen, who was archbishop of Rouen four hundred years before the conquest, is said to have been of this family, and they have sometimes been called by his name. They have many times distinguished themselves in the defence or recovery of this island from the French; as they did in behalf of king Charles I. against the parliament. They have at all times bore a great sway in it, and generally have had a share in the government, in quality either of governors, or deputy-governors, com∣manders of the forts and castles, bailiffs, and jurats.</P>
<P>Besides a great number of villages and hamlets, there are two towns, viz. St. Hilier and St. Aubin. St. Hilier is the capital of the island, and consists of about four hundred houses. Its situation is both pleasant and commodious, its streets are broad
<PB N="333" REF="3410"/>
and well paved; and its market being the only one of the island, is resorted to by people of all ranks, from every part. It has a good harbour, a capacious church, a fine corn-market, and sham∣bles, and is well supplied with water. In short, it scarce wants any thing either necessary or conve∣nient. It took its name from Hilerius, a holy man and a hermit, who was slain by the Normans, at their first invasion of these parts.</P>
<P>St. Aubin is about three miles from Hilier. The inhabitants are mostly merchants and masters of ships, who settled there for the sake of its port, the best in the island. Here is a fort mounted with cannon, close to the harbour. This town is not half so large as St. Hilier, but as neat. There is a handsome chapel in the town, and a church at some distance from it. It gives name to the bay, on which both it and St. Hilier stand, and in the middle of which is St. Hilier's isle, with Eliza∣beth's castle, one of the strongest in the king's dominions.</P>
<P>As the government, laws, religion, language, and privileges of the other islands are the same with those of Jersey, we shall not have occasion to dwell upon them.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>GUERNSEY</HEAD>
<P>Is called Sarnia by Antoninus, and lies about twenty miles from Jersey, to which it is not comparable either for extent or fruitfulness. But this is not owing to the soil's being less fertile, but to its not being so well cultivated; for the industry of the inhabitants is applied more to commerce than agriculture: yet they have corn enough for their own consumption, as well as cattle. It is ra∣ther better fortified by nature than that of Jersey, and is well supplied with fish, not only from the
<PB N="334" REF="3420"/>
sea, but also from a large lake. The air is very healthy, and the soil of such a nature, that no vene∣mous creature will live in it. Here is a better har∣bour than any in Jersey, defended by a very strong fort. It is full of gardens and orchards, and has cyder in great plenty. Their language is French as well as their extraction, their fuel sea-weed, or coal from England, and the drink of the better sort French wine, which is as cheap as beer in England. That beautiful flower, called the Lilium Sarniense, is a native of this place; and here are found those sharp stones called Emerils, with which lapidaries polish diamonds, and glaziers cut their glass.</P>
<P>The fine harbour abovementioned is almost at the extremity of the island east-ward. It is a spaci∣ous bay capable of receiving large ships, which may get to sea from it with any wind. On this bay stands the tower of St. Peter, where is a very noble pier, consisting of vast stones laid close together with much art and regularity. It is upwards of four hundred years since it was erected, and it bids fair to last for many ages. It is not only a se∣curity to the shipping; but the top being laid with large smooth flags, guarded with parapets, and of great length and breadth, is the ordinary walk of the inhabitants, commanding a most delightful pro∣spect of the sea, and the neighbouring islands. The governor generally resides in Castle-Cornet at the mouth of the haven, and has all the castles and garrisons of the island under his command. The town is well supplied with provisions, especially fish, and carries on a great trade. Guernsey is not so populous, nor so well wooded as Jersey, but they both agree in their productions, their original settle∣ment, and their temporal and spiritual government. The Liturgy of the church of England is now so universally received, that there is not one congre∣gation of dissenters in the whole island. In the reign
<PB N="335" REF="3430"/>
of queen Mary, the genius of the Roman catholic religion discovered itself here in a memorable in∣stance. Three women, the mother and two daugh∣ters, were charged with heresy, for adhering to the reformed religion, and condemned to be burnt. One of them, named Perotine Massey, being big with child, the infant dropped from her womb into the fire, from which it was snatched alive, but after∣wards ordered to be burnt with the ashes of its mother. This isle gives title of baron to the earl of Ailesford, and contains eight parishes.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>ALDERNEY.</HEAD>
<P>This isle is about eight miles in compass, healthy and fruitful, both in corn and pasture, and is separated from France only by a narrow sea or streight called by the French, Les Ras de Blanchart, and by us, the Race of Alderney. In stormy weather it is a dangerous passage, but otherwise safe enough. This island is an appendage of Guernsey, and has but one small harbour. The inhabitants are in number about a thousand, and live altogether in one town for their greater safety. To the west lie those dangerous Rocks, called the Casquets, extending about three leagues, on which the sons of Henry I. were cast away in their passage from Nor∣mandy. It is said, that there is a common field of five hundred acres, which has not lain fallow these hundred years. The estates are divided equally among all the children here as in Jersey. Here also is a bailiff and other officers, from whom there lies an appeal to the courts of Guernsey.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>SARK</HEAD>
<P>Is another appendage of Guernsey, a pretty small island, bearing excellent corn, and its inhabitants
<PB N="336" REF="3440"/>
amount to about three hundred, who are all te∣nants to the earl of Granville, to one of whose ancestors it was granted by queen Elizabeth. Here was antiently a convent, dedicated to St. Maglo∣rius, a christian Briton, and the apostle of these isles. There are only two passages or ascents to it, and of these only one is practicable for carriages, being defended by two pieces of cannon. It is governed by a bailiff and other officers; but capi∣tal offenders are tried at Guernsey.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, deriving its name from its situation in respect of the other Saxons, and called Sussex, i. e. the country of the South Saxons, has Hampshire on the west, the British channel on the south, Surry on the north, and Kent on the east. Its length is sixty-five miles, its breadth twenty-nine, and its circumference one hundred and seventy. It is divided into six rapes, and these into sixty-five hundreds, in which are three hundred and twelve parishes, of which one hun∣dred and twenty-three are vicarages, one city, eighteen market-towns, one thousand and sixty villages and hamlets, and about one hundred and twenty thousand souls. It has few good ports tho' it lies along the channel for sixty-five miles, which is its greatest length, the coast being en∣cumbered in many places with rocks; and where it is more open, such quantities of sand are thrown upon it by the south-west winds, and the harbours so choaked up, that they will not admit vessels of any great draught or burden. The county is well watered by the rivers Arun, Adar, Ouse, Rother,
<PB N="337" REF="3450"/>
Lavant, Cuckmeer, Ashburn, and Aften, by which it is well supplied with fish, as well as from the sea. Hence different places of the country are famed for different sorts of fish, as the Arun for mullets, which enter it from the sea in sum∣mer in shoals, and by feeding upon a particular kind of herb, become extremely delicious, Chichester for lobsters, Selsey for cockles, Amberley for trout, Pulborough for eels, Rye for herrings, and the county in general for carp. It is remarkable that all the rivers abovementioned rise and fall into the sea within the county.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air, as well as the soil, is various in dif∣ferent parts of the county. Upon the coast the air is aguish, upon the hills and downs pleasant and wholesome; but somewhat moist and foggy in the valleys, the soil being deep and rich, and the vegetation in summer very vigorous. The downs in some places are very fertile in corn and grass, in others they feed great flocks of sheep, whose flesh and wool are very fine; but of the latter no inconsiderable quantity is clandes∣tinely exported to France. In the Weald and the vallies, the roads are very deep, especially in winter. In the north quarter are many woods, and some forests in other places; whence the king's yards are supplied with the largest and best timber in England, beside what is made into charcoal and consumed in the iron works; for, on the east-side, is plenty of iron ore, with furnaces, forges, and mills for manufacturing it. The gunpowder of this county is said to excel that of any other. Those delicious birds called Wheat-ears are bred in this shire: they are no bigger than a lark, but almost an entire lump of fat. That part now called
<PB N="338" REF="3460"/>
the Wild or Weald of Sussex was anciently a mere desert for hogs and deer, of great extent, taking in a part of Kent and Surrey, and was called Anderida Silva, Coid Andred, and Andradswald, from Ande∣rida, an adjoining city. This county is in the home∣circuit and diocese of Chichester, giving title of earl to the family of Yelverton, and sends twenty-eight members to parliament, viz. two for the county, two for the city of Chichester, and two for each of the following towns, Horsham, Lewis, Bramber, East-Grinstead, Midhurst, Shoreham, Steyning, Arundel, Hastings, Rye, Winchelsea, and Seaford; of which the four last are Cinque∣ports.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Chichester, the capital, standing on the rivulet La∣vant, in a plain, was the royal seat and capital of the South Saxons, having been built by Cissa, one of their kings, and called Cissa Ceaster or City. After the conquest it was given to Roger de Mont∣gomery, when bishop Stigand removed his see to it from Selsey. Both the city and cathedral were burnt down in the reign of Richard I. but restored by its bishop Selfrid or Saffred. The cathedral is not a large, but neat church, has a fine spire, and is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Its chapter con∣sists of a dean, thirty prebendaries, two archdeacons, a treasurer, chancellor, chaunter, and twelve vicars choral. Many of the ornaments of the church were destroyed in the civil wars: but the bishop's palace hath been lately rebuilt. The city is neat and com∣pact, having four streets answering to the four cardinal points, with four gates, and surrounded by an old wall. It has a stately cross in the market place; but the publick buildings are not extraordinary. Antiently there was a Franciscan convent here, and a castle be∣longing
<PB N="339" REF="3470"/>
to the earls of Arundel. It is a city and county of itself, the government being vested in a mayor, recorder, aldermen, common-council with∣out limitation, and four justices of the peace, chosen out of the aldermen. The mayor is attended by four serjeants at mace and a crier, and is bal∣lotted by the aldermen and common council, who nominate two persons. The principal manufactures of the town are malt and needles. The finest lob∣sters in England are bred in the Lavant. Its Saturdays market is noted for fish, wheat, barley, malt, and oats; and every Wednesday fortnight there is a great market for cattle. At Deal key is a small harbour, where vessels come in and go out at high water, loaded with wheat, timber, coals, &amp;c. for Lon∣don and ports on the coast. It is worth observing, that the Lavant, unlike most other rivers, is very low in winter, but in summer often overflows its banks. There is a delightful prospect from this city of the sea and neighbouring country.</P>
<P>Horsham has its name from Horsa, brother to Hengist the Saxon. Being one of the largest towns of the county, the assizes are often held in it; and here is the county gaol, a very fine church, and free∣school. There is a quarrey of very good stone either for tiling or flooring in its neighbourhood; and its weekly market is well supplied with provisions of all kinds, especially poultry. The manor be∣longed antiently to the dukes of Norfolk; but, being forfeited, was given to the ancestor of the earls Delawar. It is a borough by prescrip∣tion, and is governed by two bailiffs, who are chosen yearly by a jury, at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. The jury return four persons to the steward, and he nominates two out of the four for the ensuing year. The members of parliament are chosen by the bailiffs and burgage-holders.</P>
<P>Midhurst derives its name from its having been antiently surrounded with a wood. It is pleasantly
<PB N="340" REF="3480"/>
situated upon a hill, at the bottom of which runs the Arun; and, being a borough by prescription, is governed by a bailiff, chosen annually by a jury at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. The Romans called it Midae. Tratton, in its neigh∣bourhood, was the birth place of Otway the poet.</P>
<P>Lewis stands upon a rising ground at some distance from the sea, and, for extent and po∣pulousness, is one of the chief towns in the county. Here was formerly a castle, and near it a priory for Cluniac monks, both of which were built, and the latter endowed, by William Warren, earl of Surry, and dedicated to St. Pancras. In the time of the Saxons there was a mint here. Afterwards in the reign of Henry III. a bloody battle was fought in its neighbourhood between the king and the barons, on which the king, tho' he gained some advantage at first, was in the end entirely defeated. The town is handsome, with large suburbs, and is pleasantly situated upon the edge of the South-downs. It is an antient borough by prescription, and is governed by constables chosen yearly and alternately at the court-leet of three lords, viz. the duke of Dorset, the duke of Nor∣folk, and the lord Abergavenny. It drives a great trade, and goods are brought to the town in boats and barges from a port eight miles off on the river Ouse. On this river is a considerable iron manufacture; and from a windmill near the town, is one of the finest prospects in the world.</P>
<P>Steyning, or Stening, is a poor small town, but a borough by prescription. The chief magistrate is the constable, who presides over and deter∣mines in elections of members of parliament. It was antiently a large town, and had a priory of black canons, afterwards converted into a college for a dean and secular canons. Here are several good fairs, particularly at Michaelmas, and a free

school founded by one Mr. Holland, a tradesman of the town. The ancestors of earl Delawar ob∣tained this manor also upon the attainder of John de Mowbray, duke of Norfolk. The land about the town is so fruitful, that an acre often pro∣duces thirty or forty bushels of wheat, and fifty of barley, and lets at a great price. As the pasture of the downs is particularly excellent for sheep, so the mutton is extremely delicious. A charity of twenty-four pounds a year to this, and twenty-three other parishes, was given above one hundred years ago by Sir Barrick Hiltman; but, being limited to ninety-nine years, it is now expired.</P>
<P>Shoreham, Old and New, stand upon the Adur, at the mouth of which was antiently the Portus Adurni, a good harbour, till it was barred up in a great measure by sand-banks. It was here Ella, the Saxon, landed an army, with which he drove the Britons into the Weald, then a forest, and founded the kingdom of the South Saxons. This manor, also being forfeited by the duke of Norfolk, was given to the ancestor of earl Delawar. New Shoreham is a populous place, governed by con∣stables, and has a good harbour, which has been lately greatly improved; but the old town is dwindled into a poor village. Here, on account of the plenty and cheapness of timber in the neighbouring country, and the conveniency of the river to bring it down, many artificers and tradesmen in the ship-building business are settled.</P>
<P>East-Grinstead the Less has the epithet of East, to distinguish it from West Grinstead, a manor in the rape of Bramber, and of the Less, to distinguish it from the market-town of that name in this county. Here is an hospital built in the reign of James I. for thirty-one poor people, and endowed with three hundred and thirty pounds a year, by
<PB N="342" REF="3500"/>
the earl of Dorset, whose descendants, now dukes, are lords of the manor. Besides others, it has a great fair in November for Welch runts, fat hogs, and other cattle. It is a borough by pre∣scription; and the bailiff, who is the chief magis∣trate, and returning officer, is chosen by a jury of burgage-holders at the duke of Dorset's court-leet.</P>
<P>Bramber, or Bramborough cum Botolph. This borough and manor, which antiently belonged to the Braises, and after them to the Mowbrays, dukes of Norfolk, is now the estate of earl Delawar, who likewise possesses the other manors that pertained to that family. Here was antiently a castle, the ruins of which are still visible. Bram∣ber and Steyning were represented in parliament by the same members, till new Edward IV. but since that time they have had separate members. It is a borough by prescription, but a very poor one, and is governed by constables chosen yearly by a jury at the court-leet of the lord of the ma∣nor.</P>
<P>Arundel, famous for its excellent mullets, seems to take its name from the river Arun, by which it stands, upon the declivity of a hill, near the top of which is that famous castle, which, in the Saxon times, is said to have been a mile in compass, and is now one of the duke of Norfolk's seats. To this castle is inseparably annexed the manor, and also the title and dignity of earl; for in Henry VI's time, it was declared by act of parliament, that all who had been or should be possessed of the castle and honour were, and should be, by vir∣tue thereof, earls of Arundel. Formerly the fa∣mily of Fitz-Alan, but now the dukes of Nor∣folk, as lords of the manor and castle, are earls of Arundel. The town is a borough by prescrip∣tion, governed by a mayor, twelve burgesses, a steward, and other inferior officers. The majority
<PB N="343" REF="3510"/>
of the inhabitants, paying scot and lot, chuse the mayor yearly at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. In the church are several monuments of the antient earls. The harbour was formerly a very good one, till it was choaked up with sand; but an act of parliament was passed some years ago for restoring it.</P>
<P>Hastings, which is supposed to derive its name from Hastings, a Danish pirate, is the chief of the Cinque-ports, and, with its members, Winchel∣sea, Rye, &amp;c. was bound to find twenty-one ships for any naval expedition; on which account, as well as the other ports, it enjoyed ample privileges and immunities. The ships were not only to be com∣pletely equipped, but manned each with twenty-one men well armed, who were to be maintained by the respective ports fifteen days, after which the king was obliged to keep them, if he had any further occasion for their service. Notice was to be given to the several ports forty days before the ships were wanted. The ports were at first but five, and therefore called Cinque-ports, viz. Hastings, Dover, Hythe, Romney, and Sandwich, to which Winchelsea and Rye were afterwards added as principals, and some other small towns as members. The lord-warden of these ports is always a no∣bleman, and has the authority of admiral and chancellor within his jurisdiction, besides other privileges. Their representatives in parliament have the title of barons, who support the canopy at the king's coronation, and have a table spread for them on the king's right-hand. Here, in the reign of Athelstan, was a mint; and William the Conqueror mustered his army, after he had landed at Pevensey, and burnt his fleet. This town had formerly a castle, the ruins of which are still visible. Here is no harbour, but only an open
<PB N="344" REF="3520"/>
beach. The town is exempted from toll, and go∣verned by a mayor and jurats, who have authority to judge in capital causes. Its members are Pe∣vensey, Seaforth, Bulliver, Heath, Hidney, Beaks∣burn, and Granger. The earls of Huntington have both their name and title of baron from it. A great quantity of the best fish caught here are sent to London by land-carriage.</P>
<P>Rye, another of the Cinque-ports, is pleasantly situated at the extremity of the county towards Kent, on the side of a hill, and has a delightful prospect of the sea, by which, and the river Ro∣ther, it is almost surrounded at high-water. The harbour is so choaked up, that it will hardly admit the smallest vessels. A great quantity and variety of fish are caught here in their seasons, particularly herrings and mackarel, and conveyed to London. Here is a free-school, and a considerable trade in hops, wool, timber, kettles, cannon, &amp;c. which are cast at the iron-works in the neighbourhood. It is a corporation by prescription, governed by a mayor and twelve jurats, and is well supplied with water by leaden pipes from the neighbouring hills. Tenterden is its only member.</P>
<P>Winchelsea is the third Cinque-port in this county. The sea swallowed up the old town, and retired from the new before it was quite finished, in consequence of which it is now so decayed, that grass grows in the streets. It appears to have been once a very large and handsome town, divided into thirty-two squares, with three parish churches. Such also the old town seems to have been, which stood at the distance of two or three miles. Near the new was a castle, now quite decay∣ed, built by Henry VIII. In St. Leonard's, one of its three antient churches, was the statue of that saint, the patron of the town, with a moveable vane in his hand, which being placed
<PB N="345" REF="3530"/>
against any particular quarter, they imagined would make the wind blow from thence. In con∣sequence of this opinion, whoever wanted a wind for himself or his friends, used to turn it accord∣ingly, having first made an offering to the saint, without which they were not allowed to approach him, or were told that it would be ineffectual. The borough is governed by a mayor and jurats, and gives the title of earl to the noble family of Finch.</P>
<P>Seaford, though but a small fishing town, with∣out any market, sends members to parliament, is a member of the Cinque-port of Hastings, and a corporation, by the name of bailiffs, jurats, and commonalty of the town, parish, and borough of Seaford. It is defended by a fort, and is built of stone and slate; but has suffered much by foreign enemies, and was more considerable formerly. Not far from hence is</P>
<P>Beachy - head, which is the highest promon∣tory on the south coast of England, and is re∣markable for a sea-engagement in its neighbour∣hood, in 1690, between the French and the Dutch and English, in which the latter were forced to retire. In the neighbourhood of this cliff, the wheat-ears we mentioned before are chiefly taken.</P>
<P>Battel had its name from the decisive battle here fought betwixt William the Conqueror and Ha∣rold, for the crown of England. After the bat∣tle, the conqueror erected an abbey on the spot where it was fought, which he dedicated to St. Martin, and called Battle-abbey, ordering mass to be said for the souls of all that fell in the conflict, and bestowing great revenues and privi∣leges upon it. Part of the charter run thus: "If any thief, murderer, or person guilty of any crime, fly for fear of death and come to the church,
<PB N="346" REF="3540"/>
let him have no harm, but be freely dismissed. Be it lawful also for the abbot of the same church to deliver from the gallows any thief or robber whatsoever, if he chance to come by at the exe∣cution." In a short time houses began to be built about the abbey, and this was the origin of the town of Battel. Nothing now remains of the abbey, though it was a mile in compass, and, no doubt, very magnificent, except the gate-house, which is used for the sessions and other public meetings. The town has a harbour for barges; and the best gunpowder, perhaps in Europe, is made here. On a hill, near the town, formerly called Standard-hill, but now Beacon-hill, William the Conqueror set up his standard of defiance be∣fore the engagement.</P>
<P>Brighthelmstone stands fifty miles from Lon∣don, and its situation is extremely pleasant, being surrounded on one side by the sea, and on the others by beautiful pastures, or corn-fields, beyond which are charming downs, where vast flocks of sheep, remarkable for their fine wool, are fed. This town has been much frequented lately for the sake of bathing in the sea, and drink∣ing its water, for which every convenience and accommodation that can be wished for, have been provided. The air is remarkably pure and salubrious; less rain falls here than in any other part of England, and as there is no river or brook of any consequence in the neighbourhood, the sea∣water is strong and genuine, without mixture to weaken its efficacy. From hence Charles II. made his escape to France, having wandered about in the most imminent danger several weeks after the battle of Worcester. Here barks and other small craft are built for the merchants of London, &amp;c. and the fishermen let themselves out for the sea∣son, to catch herrings for the people of Yar∣mouth.

It is a pretty large place, having seven streets and as many lanes; but it has suffered much by the encroachments of the sea, and is in danger of suffering still more.</P>
<P>Newhaven, a small town at the mouth of the Ouse, inhabited chiefly by sea-faring people. Some small craft are built here, and it has a little trade, but the harbour will not admit vessels above fifty or sixty tons.</P>
<P>Petworth is a large handsome town; tho' its greatest ornament is the late duke of Somerset's palace, now the earl of Egremont's, which is so magnificent, that it would not disgrace the court of any prince in christendom. In a vault of the church, are interred many of the Percies, earls of Northumberland, by marrying the heiress of which family, this palace and estate devolved to the dukes of Somerset.</P>

<P>A Roman camp near Chichester, and another, supposed to be Danish, upon Rook's-hill, two or three miles north of that city. The noted high∣way, called Stanes-street, passes through this county by Billinghurst and Arundel. About a mile from Findon, and not far from Steyning, is an antient camp, within two miles of the sea. On the hills, near Newhaven, are found variety of curious fossils, particularly spar, as clear as chrys∣tal. Here likewise many of those shell-like fos∣sils are found, generally near the places where iron-ore abounds. Betwixt this and New-Shore∣ham, upon the coast, is found a black heavy bi∣tuminous substance, which the people call spum∣bulo, and use for fuel. At Pevensey are the re∣mains of a castle built by William the Conqueror,

<HEAD>WALES.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>ANTIENT STATE, DIVISION, and GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WALES, which was antiently of greater extent than it is at present, and com∣prehended all the country beyond the Severn, that is, besides the twelve counties included in it at present, those of Herefordshire and Mon∣mouthshire, which now are reckoned a part of England, was then inhabited by three different tribes of the Britons, namely, the Silures, the Dimetae, and the Ordovices. The Romans were never able to subdue them, till the reign of Vespasian, when they were reduced by Julius Frontinus, who placed garrisons in their country to keep them in awe. Tho' the Saxons made them∣selves masters of all England, they never could get possession of Wales, except the counties of Monmouthshire and Herefordshire, formerly a part of Wales. About the year 870, Roderic, king of Wales, divided it among his three sons:
<PB N="350" REF="3580"/>
and the names of these divisions were Demetia, or South-Wales; Povesia, or Powis-Land; and Venedotia, or North-Wales. Another division is mentioned afterwards in the Records, viz. North-Wales, South-Wales, and West-Wales, the last comprehending the counties of Monmouth and Hereford. The country derived the name of Wales, and the inhabitants that of Welsh, from the Saxons, who, by those terms, denote a coun∣try and people to which they are strangers; for the Welsh, in their own language, call their country Cymry, and their language Cymraeg. They continued under their own princes and laws from the abovementioned period, and were never en∣tirely subjected to the crown of England, till the reign of Edward I. when Llewellin ap Gryffith, prince of Wales, lost both his life and dominions. Edward, the better to secure his conquest, and to reconcile the Welsh to a foreign yoke, sent his queen to lye-in at Caernarvon, where she was delivered of a prince; to whom the Welsh, on that account, the more readily submitted. Ever since that time the eldest sons of the kings of Eng∣land have commonly been created princes of Wales, and, as such, enjoy certain revenues from that country. But tho' Wales, from that time, was subject to the crown of England, yet it was not united and incorporated with it till the 27th of Henry VIII. when, by act of parliament, the go∣vernment of it was modelled according to the English form; all laws, customs, and tenures, con∣trary to those of England, being abrogated, and the inhabitants admitted to a participation of all the English liberties and privileges, particularly that of sending members to parliament, viz. a knight for every shire, and a burgess for every shire-town, except Merioneth. By other acts
<PB N="351" REF="3590"/>
made afterwards, the country was divided into four circuits, and two justices were appointed for each, containing three counties; but at present there are only two circuits and four judges, two for each. In fine, the government here, both civil and ecclesiastical, is now the same as that of England.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHARACTER and LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>As to the character of the Welsh, they are said to be a brave, hospitable people; and tho' very jealous of affronts, passionate, and hasty, yet are easily reconciled. The common people look with a suspicious eye on strangers, and bear an here∣ditary grudge to the English nation, by whom their ancestors were expelled from the finest parts of the island. The gentlemen are apt to value themselves upon the antiquity of their families, and with some reason, as they can generally trace them much higher than the inhabitants of most other countries.</P>
<P>All the better sort, both in town and country, can speak English, especially in the counties bor∣dering upon England. The common people, in general, only speak their own language, which is the antient British, and not only differs entirely from the English, but has very little affi∣nity with any of the western tongues, unless we should except the Galic, Erse, or Irish. It is said to be a dialect of the antient Celtic or Gome∣rian, and in many respects to resemble the He∣brew. Most of the clergy are natives of the country, and understand English so well, that they could exercise their functions in any part of Britain. The public worship, however, is as often performed in Welsh as in English, ex∣cepting in the towns, where the latter is the pre∣vailing language; nay there, even most of the
<PB N="352" REF="3600"/>
meaner sort understand it. No country perhaps in Europe, Scotland excepted, sends abroad so great a number of scholars, in proportion to its extent; for there is hardly a town in Wales with∣out a free-school. The ignorance which formerly prevailed among the poorer sort, especially the colliers, is now in a great measure removed by the circulating schools, and other laudable measures, employed by the worthy Society for propagating Christian knowledge. By the circulating schools are meant certain school-masters, who travel from one place to another, instructing both old and young in reading, praying, and the principles of our most holy religion. In the year 1749, the number of these school-masters amount∣ed to one hundred and forty-two, and the persons instructed by them to seventy-two thousand two hundred and sixty-four. These useful institutions depend on the liberality of well-disposed people. The society for promoting Christian knowledge lay out considerable sums in printing good books for the use of the Welsh. The inhabitants, who are computed at about three hundred thousand, are not, in general, wealthy, tho' the land tax of Wales brings in forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty-two pounds.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>FACE of the COUNTRY, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The country, tho' mountainous, especially in North-Wales, is far from being barren or un∣fruitful; the hills, besides the metals and mine∣rals they contain, feeding vast herds of small black cattle, deer, sheep, and goats, and their vallies a∣bounding in corn, as their seas and rivers do in fish. Here are also wood, coal, and turf for fuel in abundance.</P>

<P>Wales is bounded on all sides by the sea and the Severn, except on the east, where it joins to the counties of Chester, Salop, Hereford, and Mon∣mouth. Its length, from the southernmost part of Glamorganshire, to the extremity of Flintshire north, is computed at about one hundred and thirteen miles; and its greatest breadth from the river Wye east, to St. David's in Pembrokeshire west, is nearly of the same dimensions, being about ninety miles.</P>
<P>In our description of this principality, we shall begin from the north with the</P>

<HEAD>Island and county of ANGLESEY.</HEAD>
<P>This island had its present name from the Eng∣lish, signifying the English Island, or Island of the Angles. The Romans called it Mona, and In∣sula Opaca, or the Shady Island, being then over∣run with wood, though there is now very little upon it. The Britons stiled it Mon, and Ynys Dowylh, i. e. the Shady Island, and the old Saxons Mones.</P>

<P>Anglesey is surrounded by the Irish sea on all sides, except on the south-east, where it is parted from Caernarvonshire by the narrow firth of Meneu, which is fordable in some places at low water. The length of the isle is twenty-four miles, its greatest breadth about seventeen, and its circumference near sixty-seven. It contains about two hundred thousand acres, six hundreds, seventy-four parishes, two market-towns, and above twelve thousand inha∣bitants,
<PB N="354" REF="3620"/>
lies wholly in the diocese of Bangor, gives title of earl to the family of Annesley, and sends two members to parliament, viz. one for the county, and another for the borough of Beau∣maris.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air cannot justly be called unwholesome, ex∣cept when it is loaded with fogs, to which it is often subject, especially in the autumn. Though the appearance of the county does not pro∣mise much fertility, yet it produces plenty of corn, especially wheat, and that the best in Wales; it also abounds with cattle, fish, fowl, mill-stones, and grindstones. The island is watered by three rivers, viz. the Brant, Alow, and Keveny, which supply it with fish, as well as the surrounding sea.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Beaumaris stands on the east side of the island, has a good harbour, and had antiently a castle built by Edward I. who also founded the town, and gave it the name of Beaumaris, from its moorish situation. The great and quarter sessions, as well as the county court, are held in this town, which is a corporation, consisting of a mayor, re∣corder, bailiffs, and burgesses, &amp;c. Here pas∣sengers from Chester for Ireland generally land, and from hence proceed to Holyhead. The town has two very good streets, a market well supplied with provisions, and a handsome church, in which are some fine monuments of the knights Templars, and the family of the Bulkeleys.</P>
<P>Holyhead is the station of the packet-boats to Ireland, to the capital of which the passage from hence is the shortest of any from England or Wales, as it lies exactly opposite. The pac∣ket-boats,
<PB N="355" REF="3630"/>
of which there are several in the service of the government, pass every week to and from Dublin. In one of these, for half a guinea, you are accommodated with the use of the cabin and a bed; and, if the weather is fa∣vourable, are soon wafted to the Hibernian shore. This village consists of straggling thatched houses, some of which, however, have good accommo∣dation for passengers. It stands on the Head, which is the most westerly point of the island, and indeed an island itself. The Welsh call it Caer Gybe. Hither the packets arrive thrice a week from Dublin, and as often sail from this place.</P>
<P>Newburgh, or Newborough, is a little town, standing on the south side of the island, governed by a mayor, recorder, and bailiffs, and gives title of baron to the earl of Cholmondeley.</P>
<P>A berfraw is now but a small village; yet here it was that the princes of North-Wales antiently kept their court, who were therefore sometimes stiled the kings of Aberfraw.</P>

<P>In this island are two camps, one supposed to be Roman, and the other British. There is also a village, called Tre'r Druw, or the Druids town; and another called Tre'r Burdk, or the Bards town, lying between Newburgh and Beaumaris.</P>
<P>In 1680 a gold medal of Julius Constantius was found at a place called Trevarthin, and deposited in the cabinet belonging to the Mostyn family.</P>
<P>In this island are also a great many rude monu∣ments, consisting of several rough stones, pitched on end, as supporters or pillars, and a vast stone of several tons weight at top. These are called by the inhabitants Cromlecheu, and are thought to be sepulchral monuments, either of the Druids,

<P>This county is bounded on the north by the Irish sea and the Dee, on the east by Cheshire, and elsewhere by Denbighshire and Shropshire. It is the least of all the counties in Wales, extending in length between twenty and thirty miles, and in breadth about eight, being divided into five hun∣dreds, and twenty-eight parishes, in which are one city, one borough, three market-towns, contain∣ing about one hundred thousand acres, and thirty∣two thousand inhabitants. The greatest part of it lies in the diocese of St. Asaph, and the rest in that of Chester. Two members are sent by it to parliament, viz. one for the county, and an∣other for Flint.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is healthful, but pretty sharp, not be∣ing so well screaned as those to the south of it, by high mountains, from the rude north winds. It is tolerably fertile, especially in the vallies, which produce plenty of wheat, barley, oats, and rye. Neither is it destitute of cattle, tho' they are small, nor of butter, cheese, and honey: of the last of which they make metheglin, a drink much used in Wales. Here are also pit-coal, lead-ore, mill-stones, fish, and fowl, but little wood or fruit. The rivers peculiar to the county worth mentioning are the Wheeler, Seveon, and Alen; the two former of which, after a short course, fall into the Clwyd, and the other into the Dee.</P>

<P>Flint, the county town, stands on the aestuary of the Dee, having a small harbour, and formerly a castle, begun by Henry II. and finished by Ed∣ward I. but now in ruins. It is a corporation, consisting of a mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses, and the place where the assizes are generally held.</P>
<P>St. Asaph, a bishop's see, which Kentigern, bishop of Glasgow, is said to have erected about the year 560, appointing his favourite St. Asaph, from whom the town takes its name, the first bishop. It stands at the conflux of the Clwyd and Elwy, whence it is called by the Welsh Lhan-Elwy, and has a bridge over both these rivers, but is otherwise a poor mean place. The bishop, for the better support of his dignity, is also arch∣deacon of St. Asaph. His diocese comprehends a part of the counties of Flint, Denbigh, Mont∣gomery, Merioneth, and Salop. This town
<PB N="358" REF="3660"/>
gives the title of viscount to the earl of Ashburn∣ham.</P>
<P>Holywell, a small town, taking its name from a spring which the credulous papists pretend sprung up miraculously in the place where St. Winifrid, a christian virgin, was ravished and be∣headed, but afterwards restored to life by St. Beuno. These waters are impregnated with some kind of mineral, and often cure disorders; but the papists look upon these cures as miraculous, and ascribe them to St. Winifrid: in consequence of which notion, there is a great resort of de∣votees, and sick people to the well, which is a spring of fine water, flowing in such quantities, that at the distance of twenty yards, it keeps a water-mill continually going. The place where it rises, is enclosed in the form of a bath, about twelve feet long by six or seven wide, over which has been built by the monks of former ages, a most curious and venerable Gothic structure, in honour of the saint who first bestowed her bene∣diction on the spring. It is an excellent cold bath, and when it proves serviceable as such, its situa∣tion, under such a venerable superstructure, is a circumstance sufficient to possess the minds of the superstitious and credulous with the belief of a supernatural cure. The village is now large and populous, being of late much increased in buildings.</P>
<P>Caerwys has an excellent market, and is situated between St. Asaph and Flint, towards the centre of the county. Here, in the reign of queen Eli∣zabeth, was an assembly of the poets, musicians, and bards of North-Wales, candidates for the silver harp.

<P>This county is bounded on the south by Merio∣neth and Montgomeryshires; on the north by Flintshire and the Irish sea; on the west by Me∣rioneth and Carnarvonshires; and on the east by Shropshire and Cheshire. It extends in length about forty miles, in breadth twenty-one, and in circumference one hundred and eighteen, is divided into twelve hundreds, containing fifty-seven parishes, four market-towns, about four hundred and ten thousand acres, and thirty-eight thousand inhabitants.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county is wholesome, but sharp, it being pretty hilly, and the snow lying long on the mountains. Its soil in general is barren; but the vale of Clwyd, so called from its being watered by that river, is a very fertile pleasant spot, of great extent, and well inhabited. The other rivers of the county are, the Elwy, Dee, and Conway. Its chief commodities are black cattle, sheep, and goats, rye, called here amel-corn, and lead-ore. A pleasanter prospect cannot be imagined than that which the vale of Clwyd presents in summer, when viewed from the wild mountains which hem it in on all sides, ex∣cept towards the sea, and serve as a foil to its beauties. This county sends two members to par∣liament, viz, a knight for the shire, and a burgess for Denbigh, which gives title of earl to the noble family of Fielding.</P>

<P>Denbigh, the parliamentary borough just men∣tioned, is the chief town of this county, and gives name to it. It stands on a branch of the Clwyd, is a handsome town, and drives a great trade, espe∣cially in gloves and tanned leather, besides a good market for corn, cattle, and other provisions. It is called by the Welsh Kledvryn yn Rhos, that is, the craggy hill in Ross, and is governed by two al∣dermen, a recorder, two bailiffs, a town-clerk, and other officers. Here was antiently a very strong castle. The chief disadvantage which the place labours under, is the want of good whole∣some water.</P>
<P>Ruthin. Here are the ruins of an antient castle, built, as well as the town, by Roger Grey, to whom Edward I. gave most of the vale of Clwyd for his services against the Welsh. The town, which is a corporation, is large, has a good free-school, an hospital, and possesses the greatest market in the vale.</P>
<P>Wrexham is also a large handsome town. The chief manufacture of it and the adjacent country is flannel, of which considerable quantities are bought up here, and sent to London. It stands on a good soil on a small river, has a stately church, two meeting-houses, and a considerable market for corn, cattle, and other provisions.

<P>This county is bounded on the north and west by the sea, on the south by Merionethshire, and on the east is divided from Denbighshire by the river Conway. It is about forty miles in length, twenty in breadth, and ninety-five in circumference, containing three hundred and seventy thousand acres, seven hundreds, sixty-eight parishes, one city, one borough, six market-towns, and about sixteen thousand inhabitants, lying altogether in the diocese of Bangor. The members it sends to parliament are one for the shire, and another for the borough of Caernarvon.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county is very piercing, which is owing partly to the snow, that lies seven or eight months of the year upon some of the moun∣tains,
<PB N="563" REF="3710"/>
which are so high that they are called the British Alps; and partly to the great number of lakes, which are said not to be fewer than between fifty and sixty. As to the soil, in the vallies between the hills, along the rivers, and on the side next Ire∣land, it is pretty fertile, especially in barley; and great numbers of cattle, sheep, and goats, are fed on the mountains. The sea, lakes, and rivers, sup∣ply the inhabitants with plenty of fish, and in great variety. The highest mountains in the county are those called Snowdon-hills, and Penmaen-mawr, which last hangs over the sea. There is a road cut out of the rock on the side next the sea, which is guarded by a wall running along the edge of it on that side; but the traveller is sometimes in danger of being crushed by the fall of pieces of the rock from the precipices above. The river Conway, though its course from the lake from which it issues to its mouth, is only twelve miles, yet it is so deep, in consequence of the many brooks it receives in that short space, that it is navigable for ships of good burthen for eight miles. Pearls are found in a large black muscle taken in this river.</P>

<P>Bangor is a bishop's see, the diocese of which comprehends this county and Anglesey, with part of Denbigh, Merioneth, and Montgomeryshires. Of the three archdeaconries, one is annexed to the bishopric, for its better support. This city had once a castle and monastery so large, that it was called Bangor-vaur, or Bangor the great. The town is but an inconsiderable place, governed by the bishop's steward. The bishop's palace and the free-school are the principal buildings of the place. The cathedral is very old and mean. Edw. I. attempted to build a bridge here over the Firth,
<PB N="364" REF="3720"/>
or arm of the sea, that lies betwixt this county and Anglesey, but found the design altogether impracti∣cable.</P>
<P>Caernarvon is the shire-town, and was built by Edward I. near the site of the antient Segontium. It is almost surrounded by the sea and two rivers, gives name to the neighbouring bay, and had antiently a castle, built also by Edward I. in which his son, Edward II. the first prince of Wales, was born. It is a small neat town, governed by the constable of the castle, who is also mayor, an al∣derman, two bailiffs, a town-clerk, and other in∣ferior officers. The market here is well supplied with provisions, and there is a ferry from hence to Anglesey. The town gives title of earl and mar∣quis to the duke of Chandos, and has a good tide∣harbour. It is said Constantius, the father of Con∣stantine the Great, was interred here.</P>
<P>Conway, or Aberconway, is a handsome town advantageously situated at the mouth of the river Conway, whence it is called Aberconway; and is governed by an alderman and two bailiffs. Here was once a very strong stately castle, now in ruins, which was built, as well as the town, by Edward I. Notwithstanding this town stands on a fine navi∣gable river, as broad as the Thames at Deptford, and capable of receiving ships of any burden, yet it has very little trade, and seems to be rather up∣on the decline. <Q>There is an epitaph on a tomb∣stone here, not to be paralleled perhaps in Europe. It runs thus: “Here lieth the body of Nicholas Hookes, of Conway, gent. who was the one and fortieth child of his father, William Hookes, esquire, by Alice, his wife, and the father of seven and twenty children. He died the 20th of March, 1637.”</Q> Near this town stood the antient city Co∣novium. Aberconway was the capital and resi∣dence of the antient princes of Wales. In its neigh∣bourhood
<PB N="365" REF="3730"/>
are those lofty mountains, justly in Eng∣lish called Snowdown-hills, for the snow lies on them eight or nine months in the year. From the tops of some of them, in clear weather, may be seen the hills about Dublin, particularly the promon∣tory of Hoath, and mountains of Wicklow, at the distance of eighty or ninety miles. Here, and in other parts of North Wales, the old custom of en∣tertaining the company during their stay at their inns with the Welsh harp still prevails. The no∣velty of this custom, the appearance it has of a chearful and hospitable welcome, together with the agreeable wildness of the music, renders it generally very acceptable to strangers.</P>

<P>The highest mountain in this county, and, as it is thought, in Great Britain, is that called Moel y Wydhva, whence, in a clear day, may be seen part of Ireland, Scotland, England, and the Isle of Man. As these mountains are called the British Alps, so they produce some plants and animals that are found only on them and the Italian Alps. Among the latter, is the <HI>merula sexatilis aldrovandi,</HI> or rock-ouzel, called in Switzerland, Berg-amzel, or mountain black-bird; and a fish called the tor∣goch, found in the lakes on these mountains, and

supposed to be the same as the roetel of the Al∣pine lakes. It is said also that trouts with one eye are sometimes taken in these lakes. The places where Roman legions were antiently stationed, in this and other counties of Wales, are generally known at this day by the name of Kaer Lheion, that is, Urbs Legionum, or the city of the Le∣gions, with the addition of the name of the river, mountain, &amp;c. near which they stand, to distin∣guish them, as Caer Lheion ar Wysk.

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county, which is more encum∣bered with mountains than any other in Wales, is exceeding sharp and bleak; and would be very unwholesome, if the vapours from the Irish sea were not, in a great measure, dispersed by the high winds to which this county is sub∣ject. The soil is very rocky and barren, except in the valleys, which yield good corn, and pasture for cattle and sheep. As the country is so moun∣tainous, the inhabitants apply themselves chiefly to grazing, keeping vast flocks of sheep, deer, and goats, in the mountains, and living much up∣on butter, cheese, fowl, and fish, especially her∣rings. They have but little corn, and their black cattle are generally sold to the English. The chief rivers of the county are the Dyffi, or Tovy, the Avon, the Drwrydh, and the Dee, which last runs through the lake called Lhyn Tigid, or Pim∣ble Meer, without mixing its waters with those of the lake, as is supposed; for the salmon, with which the river abounds, are never taken out of the main stream; and the givineads, a fish peculiar to the lake, are never found in it. This lake is very large, and winds, it is pretended, will make it overflow, but land-floods never. The fish in the lakes, and the herbs on the rocks and mountains here, like those in Caernarvonshire, and other hilly parts of Wales, are said to be much the same as those of the Alps. This county lies in the dio∣cese of Bangor, and sends no member to parlia∣ment, except a knight of the shire; for it has no towns of any note.</P>

As there are but few moun∣tains, the soil is generally fruitful, especially on the sea coasts; nor are its mountains altogether unprofitable, but produce pasture sufficient to main∣tain great numbers of sheep and goats. Its other commodities are corn, cattle, pit - coal, marle, fish, and fowl. Among these last are falcons, called here peregrins. The inhabitants of this county make a very pleasant durable fire of culm, which is the dust of coal made up into balls, with a third part of mud. The county is well watered by the rivers Clethy, Dougledye, Cled∣hew, and Teive, which last parts it from Cardi∣ganshire.
<PB N="377" REF="3850"/>
There is a division of the county stiled Rhos in the Welsh, by which is meant a large green plain. This is inhabited by the descendents of the Flemings, placed there by Henry I. to curb the Welsh, who were never able to expel them, tho' they often attempted it. On the coasts of this county, as well as on those of Glamorganshire and the Severn sea, is found the lactuca marina of Cambden, being a marine plant, or weed, which, when dressed in a certain manner, is eaten by the inhabitants, and called laver, or black butter.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Pembroke is the county-town, and stands on a creek of Milford-haven, over which it has two handsome bridges. It had antiently a castle, in which Hen. VII. was born, and was surrounded with walls; but both are now gone to decay. The town is a corporation, and gives title of earl to the noble family of Herbert, as well as Montgomery. It is the largest town next to Caermarthen in Wales, as well as the most wealthy; and its trade is so considerable, that it employs near two hundred ships and vessels on its own account. There are two churches and a custom-house, and the sea at every tide flows up to its walls.</P>
<P>Milford-haven is one of the finest harbours in Europe, and the best in the three kingdoms. It lies on the north-side near the mouth of the Bristol channel, and is very large, safe, and deep. There is no danger nor difficulty in going in or out with the tide, or almost any wind. If a ship comes in without a cable or anchor, she may run ashore on the ooze, and there lie safe till she is refitted, and in an hour's time she may get out of the harbour into the open sea. It lies extremely convenient
<PB N="378" REF="3860"/>
for ships bound from the English or Bristol chan∣nels to Ireland, or farther west, and from thence to the channels. It is said a thousand sail may ride secure, there being many bays, creeks, and roads in it. Tho' the fortification and improve∣ment of this noble harbour hath been often much talked of, and even a large sum granted by parliament for that purpose, yet very little hath hitherto been done, and it still continues in a great measure neglected.</P>
<P>Haverfordwest is a handsome, populous, trading town on the Dougledye, having three parish churches, besides one in the out-parts, a com∣modious key for ships of burden, a custom-house, a free-grammar-school, a charity-school, an alms-house, and a fine stone bridge over the Doug∣ledye. Here was antiently a priory and a castle, the town being strongly walled. It is now a corporation and county of itself, governed by a mayor and aldermen, who compose a common∣council, a sheriff, town-clerk, two bailiffs, and other inferior officers. The mayor is admiral, coroner, escheator, and clerk of the markets with∣in the liberties of the town. Here is the county gaol, and here the assizes are kept. The neigh∣bourhood of the town is full of gentry; and its trade so considerable, that it is one of the most flourishing places in Wales.</P>
<P>St. David's, the Latin name of which is Me∣nevia, stands on that promontory called by Ptolemy, Octopitarum; by the Welsh, Pibid∣rog and Cantrev Dewi; and by the English, St. David's Head. Both the town and promontory had their names from Dewi, or David, who was archbishop of Caerleon, but translated the archi∣episcopal dignity hither in king Arthur's days. This same David gave rise to the custom still ob∣served by the Welsh, of wearing a leak in their
<PB N="379" REF="3870"/>
hats on the first of March; for before an engage∣ment with the Saxons, in which it would seem that he acted in quality of general, he ordered his soldiers to stick each a leak in his cap, to distin∣guish them from the enemy. The Welsh call the town Tydewi, i. e. David's-house. It appears to have been antiently a considerable city; but afterwards suffered so much by the loss of the archiepiscopal dignity, and by the ravages of Saxons, Danes, and pirates, that it was at last quite reduced, and is now almost deserted, tho' still the see of a bishop, who has a palace and cathedral, which is a vene∣rable old building. What has prevented in a great measure its restoration in peaceable times, is its barren unhealthy situation; which, as Giral∣dus long since observed, is neither clad with trees, watered with rivers, nor adorned with mea∣dows, but continually exposed to storms and tempests. The ecclesiastics belonging to the cathedral, besides the bishop, are a chanter, who is next to the bishop, there being no dean, the chancellor, the treasurer, four archdeacons, who, with the others, make up twenty-one canons. In the diocese are three hundred and eight parishes, which take up the counties of Pembroke, Cardi∣gan, Caermarthen, Brecknock, and Radnor, with a small part of those of Monmouth, Here∣ford, and Montgomery. From the promontory in a clear day, Ireland may be seen very distinct, being only forty miles distant. A little off the extremity of the promontory or head are those rocks, infamous for shipwrecks, called the Bishop and his clerks. Great flights of birds of various kinds resort to them in the spring to breed. Among these are the puffins and those called Harry - birds, which breed in holes like rabbits, and are taken with nets. Others lay and hatch their eggs on the bare rocks. It is remark∣able,
<PB N="380" REF="3880"/>
that all these birds both come and go in the night, and are commonly seen for a week about Christmas, and then disappear till April; after which they continue till August.</P>
<P>Tenby, or Tenbigh, situated on a rock on the south coast of this shire, and called by the Welsh Dinbeck y Piscod, from its plenty of fish, is a neat town, has a good key and road for shipping, a considerable trade to Ireland, a great export of coals, and a share in the herring fishery. Here stood formerly a castle, which was demolished in the civil wars. The town is go∣verned by a mayor and bailiff.</P>
<P>Whiston, tho' a mean place, is governed by a mayor and bailiff.</P>
<P>Fishgard, or Fiscard, has a good harbour, and some trade in herrings. The town is situated at the mouth of the river Givain, and thence is called by the Welsh Aber-Givain. It is governed by a mayor, bailiffs, and other officers.</P>
<P>Newport had antiently a castle, which is now in ruins. Tho' but a poor ill built place, yet it has a good harbour, a fair church, and some trade with Ireland. The Welsh name is Trendraeth, i. e. a town on the sand. It is governed by a portreve and bailiff.</P>
<P>Killgarring, or Kilgarran, stands on the river Teivi, which abounds with salmon, and has a cataract called the Salmon's-leap; because the sal∣mon, when they come up to it from the sea, bend their tails to their mouth, and, with a jerk, throw themselves up to the top of the fall. Giraldus says, this river formerly bred beavers, but there are none found near it now. The town has a har∣bour for boats, and had formerly a castle, at this time in ruins. It consists of one street, and is go∣verned by a portreve and bailiffs.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="3890"/>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>On the coast of this county is a pool, called Bosharston-meer, so deep that it could never be fathomed. It makes a great noise before a storm, and is thought to have a subterraneous communi∣cation with the sea.</P>
<P>Here was once the great ferry for Ireland, and tho' the passage from Holyhead is nearer to Dub∣lin, yet it is more dangerous, by reason of the sudden gusts of wind from the mountains. A wind will carry a vessel from hence to Waterford in seven or eight hours.</P>
<P>There are six rivers in this county, whose names are nearly the same, which is a singularity for which Dr. Gibson, tho' well acquainted with the Welsh language, cannot account. The rivers are the Tave, Towa, Tawy, Towy, Tivy, and Tovy. Of these the Tivy is navigable for small vessels to Cardigan, and the Tovy to Caermarthen.</P>
<P>Carew castle, which stands on one of the bays of Milford-haven, gave name and origin to the illustrious family of Carew.</P>
<P>On a sea-cliff, within half a mile of St. David's, is a prodigious large stone, altogether rude and unpolished, called in Welsh, As Maen Sigl, or the rocking stone; for being mounted on divers others, it was so equally poised, that a man might have shaken it with one finger; but the position of it was so altered by some soldiers in the civil wars, that it is now almost immovable.</P>
<P>St. David, the patron of the Welsh, is said to have been uncle to king Arthur, to have lived one hundred and forty-six years, sixty-five of which
<PB N="382" REF="3900"/>
he was a bishop or archbishop, and to have been in∣terred in the cathedral of St. David's in 642.</P>
<P>It is said that on the coast of this county, the trunks of trees have been often seen at low ebbs fast in the ground, by which it would appear that the sea had gained upon the land. The trunks, through time, were become as hard and black as ebony.</P>
<P>In this county also are many such rude stone mo∣numents as we have already mentioned; some of them circular or oval, some in the form of chests; generally supposed to be sepulchral monuments or Druid temples. Besides these, there are many an∣tient tumuli, or artificial mounts for urn-burial; and in this county, as well as in Cardiganshire, many inscriptions have been found, some in cha∣racters quite unintelligible, and others in Ro∣man letters, though of doubtful meaning.</P>

<P>Caermarthen, the shire - town, is situated on the river Towy, over which it has a fine stone bridge: along the river is also a commodious key, to which ships of good burden have ac∣cess; and its trade is very considerable. The town is a place of great antiquity, being the Maridunum of Ptolomy, and is plentifully supplied with provisions, both by its river, and from the neighbouring country. It is not only a populous and thriving, but a polite place, many of the neigh∣bouring gentry residing there in winter; having plays, balls, and assemblies, for their amusement. It is a corporation and county of itself, with power to hold courts and make bye-laws. King James the First granted it a fair, called Lammas fair. The town had antiently walls, with a strong castle, and was the seat of the Welsh parliaments, being ac∣counted then the capital of the country. Here were held the courts of chancery and exchequer for South Wales, till the whole was united to England in the reign of Henry VIII. About the year four hundred

Near this town is a wood called Merlin's Grove, to which he is said to have often retired for contemplation. Many of his pretended prophecies are still preserved in this country. The town gives the title of marquis to his grace the duke of Leeds. The adjacent country is the richest and most de∣lightful in Wales.</P>
<P>Kidwely stands on a bay on the south-side of the county. It has a harbour, but too much choaked up with sands to be of any great use. Old Kidwely, on the other side the river Gwen∣draethvechan, had once a castle and walls, which have been long since in ruins. The new is a mayor-town, and had formerly a considerable cloth manufacture; but now its chief dependence is up∣on the fishery.</P>

<P>At a place called Brony Scawen, in Lhan Boy∣dy parish, above two hundred coins, all of silver, and some of the most antient ever found in Britain, were discovered in 1692, by two shepherd boys in two leaden boxes, very near the surface of the ground, at the entry of a spacious camp called Y Gaer. This camp is of an oval form, about three hundred paces in circumference, with a rampire between two and three yards in height, and a tumulus or barrow on each side of it.</P>
<P>Near Caermarthen, towards the east, may be seen the ruins of Kastelk Karreg, which was situated on a steep inaccessible rock; and also se∣veral vast caverns, supposed to have been copper∣mines of the Romans.

<P>Cardiff, the capital, the British name of which is Caer-Dyeth, stands on the Tavye or Taff, about four miles from its mouth, where there is a good harbour; but only small vessels come up to the town. In the reign of William Ru∣fus, one Fitz-Harmon; a Norman, got possession of this town and county, having been invit∣ed to its assistance by Justin ap Gwyrgant, who had revolted from his own prince; but after
<PB N="388" REF="3960"/>
Fitz-Harmon had defeated Rhys ap Tewdwr, prince of Wales, he dispossessed Justin ap Gwyr∣gant, and divided the country among his followers. The town is pretty large, has several fairs for corn, cattle, sheep, horses, and swine, and plentiful mar∣kets. Here is a strong, stately, spacious castle, in which the assizes are held, and the audit for the estate of the earl of Pembroke. The town has a good trade, especially with Bristol, and is governed by the constable of the castle, who is the earl of Pembroke, or his deputy, two bailiffs, who hold a court of record every fortnight, and are justices of the peace, twelve aldermen, as many ca∣pital burgesses, a steward, town-clerk, &amp;c. It is said to be the most beautiful town in all South Wales, standing in a level fruitful soil, and encom∣passed, at a little distance, with pleasant hills. Ro∣bert Curthose died a prisoner in the castle of Cardiff anno 1134, after having had his eyes put out by his brother. In this, as in most other towns, were antiently several convents.</P>
<P>Llandaff is a bishop's see, the diocese of which comprehends one hundred and seventy-seven pa∣rishes. Its cathedral, a stately structure, was first built by the Gallic bishops Germanus and Lupus, when they came over to suppress the Pelagian he∣resy, and dedicated to St. Talio; but the present edifice was erected by bishop Urban near seven hundred years ago. This, though a very antient bishopric, is extremely poor, a circumstance owing to one of its bishops, who is said to have alienated part of its revenues in the reign of Henry VIII. The city is very mean, situated in a bottom at the mouth of the Taff, as its Welsh name part∣ly intimates; for it signifies a church upon the Taff. At a little distance from hence is a small island, called Barry from St. Baruch, who lies bu∣ried there, which gave both name and origin to
<PB N="389" REF="3970"/>
the family of the earl of Barrymore in Ireland, once proprietors of it. At Wormshead point, a good way farther to the west, is a small clift or crevice in the ground, into which, if a handful of dust or sand is thrown, it will be blown back into the air; and if a person lies down, and lays his ear to it, he will hear distinctly a hollow noise like that of a prodigious large pair of bellows, occasioned by the reciprocal motion of the sea, under the arched and rocky hollow of the headland.</P>
<P>Cowbridge stands on the river Ewenny, not far from its mouth. From a stone bridge over this river, it is called by the Welsh Pontvaen. It has a harbour for boats, and a good market for corn, cattle, and sheep. The chief magistrate is a bailiff chosen annually, and sworn into his office by the earl of Pembroke's deputy-constable of the neigh∣bouring castle of St. Quintin.</P>
<P>At Newton, in this neighbourhood, is a very particular sort of fountain, which, at high water, is very low, but at ebb is full to the brim, tho' it never overflows. These effects are supposed to be occasioned by the air, which at full sea not having vent, stops the sources of the spring, but at low water finds a passage, and no longer con∣fines it. Not far from hence is Boverton, sup∣posed to be the Bovium of Antoninus.</P>
<P>Neath, in British Nedh, is a pretty large old town on a river of the same name, over which it has a stone bridge. The trade of the place consists chiefly in the exportation of coals, which are found in great plenty in the neighbouring hills.

Betwixt this and Cardiff is a large bay called Cardiff-bay; and on the other side of the river are the ruins of a stately abbey, and a very antient

<P>In this county are other antient monuments, as one at Pentre Yskythrog, in Lhan St. Fred parish, supposed to be sepulchral; another in Vainor parish, being a cross upon the highway, with an inscription hitherto unintelligible; an∣other in Lhan Hamwech parish, commonly called Ty Ilhtud, or St. Eltut's Hermitage, consisting of four large stones, altogether rude and unpo∣lished, of which three are pitched in the ground, and the fourth laid on the top for cover. Two of them are inscribed with a variety of crosses, and other figures; but for what purpose the monument was erected, antiquaries have not determined.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded with Brecknock and Cardiganshires on the south and west, with Shrop∣shire and Herefordshire on the east, and with Montgomeryshire on the north. Its length is about twenty-nine miles, its breadth eighteen, and its circumference ninety, containing six hun∣dreds, fifty-two parishes, about nineteen thou∣sand inhabitants, and three hundred and ten thou∣sand acres. The county sends two members to parliament, one for itself, another for the town of Radnor; and lies in the dioceses of Hereford and St. David's.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>A great part of this county being rocky and mountainous, the air upon the hills is sharp and piercing; but in the more champain parts of the county, towards the south and east, the climate is more temperate, and the soil fruitful. The mountainous parts abound in woods, lakes, and rivulets, and feed large flocks of sheep and
<PB N="395" REF="4030"/>
goats, with many herds of cattle. This county is noted also for horses and cheese. The only river pe∣culiar to it is the Ython, with three smaller streams that fall into it, viz. the Dulas, the Clowdock, and the Cameran; but the Wye divides it from Brecknockshire, and the Trent from Shropshire. All these abound with fish.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Radnor, which gives name to the county, and is its capital, to distinguish it from another place of the same name that was destroyed by Rhys ap Griffydth, in the reign of king John, and is now a sorry village, called by the Welsh Maesyved-hen, and, from its high situation, Pencraig, is called New Radnor, a name supposed to have been derived from the Welsh Rhaiadr, signifying a water∣fall, or cataract, as there is such a fall in the river Wye near the town, which had formerly a castle and walls. Old Radnor, supposed to have been the Magos of the Romans, was almost entirely de∣stroyed by Owen Glendour, when he assumed the title of prince of Wales, upon the deposition Richard II. The new town stands at the bottom of a hill, and is pretty well built, tho' the houses are thatched. Queen Elizabeth, by her charter, granted the town considerable privileges, together with the manor, which is of great extent, and a jurisdiction therein. It gives title of earl to the family of Bouverie.</P>
<P>Prestein, or Prestaign, is a large well-built town on the river Lug. Here is the county gaol, and a good market for grain, especially barley, of which considerable quanties of malt are made. This town is much indebted for its flourish∣ing state to Martin, bishop of St. David's, in the reign of Henry VIII. It is called by the Welsh
<PB N="396" REF="4040"/>
Lhan-Andras, or St. Andrew's, and is the place where the assizes are held.</P>
<P>Knighton stands on the river Teme, over which it has a bridge. It is a considerable town, has a good market, and trades in corn, cattle, hops, salt, linen, woollen cloth, and other commo∣dities.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Near Knighton is to be seen the dyke which Offa, the Mercian, cast up as a boundary between his subjects and the Britons. It extended from the mouth of the Dee to that of the river Wye, for the space of ninety miles.</P>
<P>In this county are several tumuli or barrows, and large heaps of stones, called in South-Wales, Karneu, in North-Wales, Karnedheu.</P>
<P>From Rhagadar, a small inconsiderable town, a dreary dismal wilderness takes its name, whither Vortigern retired when he began to repent of his folly in calling in the Saxons. He built there a city, and called it Haer Givortigern; but both he and it were afterwards consumed by lightning. Of the city there is not any memorial remaining but what we find in books. In this wilderness it is also said, that Lhewellyn, the last prince of Wales of the British line, ended his days in 1282.</P>

<HEAD>ISLE of MAN.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS island was distinguished antiently by several appellations, as Mona, Monoeda, Mo∣nabia, Menavia, Eubonia, Manaw, &amp;c. but its present name is probably derived from the Saxon Mang, signifying among, as lying in St. George's channel, between the kingdoms of England, Scot∣land, and Ireland, and nearly at an equal distance from all three. Its length from north to south is about thirty miles, its breadth from eight to fif∣teen, and the latitude of the middle of the island is 54 deg. 16 min. north.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>That the air is pure and wholesome appears to a demonstration from the longevity of the inhabi∣tants. The winters are longer and more severe than on the continent of England, and the sum∣mers shorter and cooler; but the weather is less vari∣able in both seasons. High winds, indeed, are more common than in England, but rains much less so. In the northern parts, where the chief mountains lie, the soil is barren, heathy, and gravelly; but towards the south, it is very good, yielding wheat, barley, oats, rye, flax, hemp, roots, and pulse. A ridge of mountains runs almost the whole length of the island, which though very bleak, yet furnishes the inhabitants with plenty
<PB N="402" REF="4100"/>
of excellent water, with peat and turf for fuel; and the vallies that lie among them afford good pasture, corn, and hay. The island breeds abun∣dance of black cattle, which are smaller than those of England, as are most of the other animals com∣mon to the two countries. The gentry have good horses both for draught and saddle; besides which, there is a small sort bred in the moun∣tains, very swift and hardy. There are no badgers, foxes, otters, pole-cats, moles, hedge∣hogs, or snakes on the island, or any other noxi∣ous animals; and till some spawn was brought over from Ireland, there were no frogs. In the mountains great numbers of hogs and sheep are bred, of both which the meat is said to be excel∣lent. They run wild, and are never housed. Of the sheep, some are of a buff colour, whose wool is tolerably fine, and makes a pretty colour with∣out any dye. Here is an airy of eagles, and several of a mottled kind of hawks. Hence it was, that Henry IV. when he granted it to Sir John Stanley, and his heirs, obliged them, in lieu of all other services, to present him and his successors with a cast of falcons on the day of their coronation. On the south coast there is a small island, called the Calf of Man, about three miles in circumference, separated from the isle of Man by a narrow channel. About the rocks of this little isle an incredible number of all sorts of sea fowl breed. At this place are also found bar∣nacles, or claik-geese, and puffins, which breed in rabbit-holes, and of whose young, when they begin to fly, about the middle of August, not less than four or five thousand are hunted and taken. They are almost one lump of fat. Some pickle them with wine, spice, and other ingre∣dients, and send them abroad as presents; but the greatest part are consumed at home. There
<PB N="403" REF="4110"/>
are no coal mines in the island; but some of iron, lead, and copper, though not wrought. It abounds in marble, slate, stone, and other materials for building, together with lime-stone, of which and marle great quantities are used in manuring the ground.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>The commodities of this island, besides their black cattle, of which six hundred may, by the act of navigation, be imported into England, are lambs-wool, fine and coarse linen, coarse woollen cloth, hides, skins, honey, tallow, marble, and slate; but their staple commodity is, or at least was formerly, herrings, of which twenty thousand barrels have been exported in one year to France and other places. This island, till lately, might have been justly called a magazine, or warehouse, for smugglers; for as there was little or no custom paid, wine and brandy from France, rum from the West Indies, callicoes, teas, and other East India goods, from Holland, Denmark, and Sweden, were landed here, laid up in warehouses, and afterwards run in small boats into Ireland, England, and Scotland: but since the royalty of the island hath been purchased by the government of the duke of Athol, who was lord of it, that pernicious smuggling - business hath been almost totally suppressed. The liberty, however, and privilege of a free trade with Eng∣land, and the dominions thereunto belonging, will make the inhabitants amends for the loss of that contraband commerce.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, and CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>The island was first inhabited by the Britons, and then by the Scots. Afterwards the Norwe∣gians
<PB N="404" REF="4120"/>
dispossessed the Scots of it and the western isles, and appointed governors of them, who ge∣nerally resided in the Isle of Man, and took the title of King of Man and the Isles. This royalty continued till 1266, when Magnus, king of Norway, surrendered it to Alexander III. of Scot∣land, for four thousand marks, to be paid in four years, and an hundred marks yearly: but at last, about the latter end of Edward I. or beginning of Edward II's. reign, it fell into the hands of the English, and has ever since continued under their jurisdiction. It had several lords before Henry IV. granted it, with the patronage of the bishopric, to Sir John Stanley and his heirs. Upon the death of the last lord Derby, without issue male, it devolved to the duke of Athol, who had mar∣ried his sister; but hath been lately re-annexed to the crown by purchase, to which there is now a governor and garrison appointed by the king, with officers of the customs, &amp;c. As the king is now in place of the lord, he has the same rights, powers, and prerogatives, such as giving the final assent to all laws; the power of pardoning offen∣ders; of changing the sentence of death into ban∣ishment; of appointing and displacing the gover∣nor and officers, civil and military, with a right to all forfeitures for treason, felony, suicide; to ten shillings out of every boat which takes above ten maese of herrings, every maese being five hundred, &amp;c. besides the rents, fines, and services, to which all landed estates are subject. The governor resides at Castle-town, where he has a handsome house, salary, and other conveniences befitting his station. He is to take care that all officers, civil and military, do their duty. To him, as chancellor, there lies an appeal in matters of right and wrong, and from him to the king in council. The form of the governor's oath was antiently somewhat singu∣lar.
<PB N="405" REF="4130"/>
<Q>He swore to do right betwixt the lord and his people, “as uprightly as the staff (the ensign of his authority) now stood in his hand,” that it might be a constant monitor to him of the obli∣gations he lies under.</Q> Formerly the temporal judges, called deemsters, determined causes ac∣cording to their consciences or best judgment, having no written laws, and these decisions were called breast-laws; but afterwards these judges were ordered to write down all decisions in intri∣cated and important matters, that they might serve as precedents and rules in future determina∣tions; and that their judgments might be the more conformable to equity, they were enjoined to take the advice of the council, and twenty-four keys of the island, before they pronounced them. The su∣preme court, or assembly of the states of the island, called the tinwald, from ting, a court of justice, and wald, fenced, is held on a hill near the middle of the island in the open air. This assembly consists of the governor, officers spiri∣tual and temporal, deemsters, and the twenty-four keys, and is held once a-year. Here any person has a right to present any uncommon grie∣vance, and to have his complaint heard and redressed in the face of the whole country. In this court also all new laws are to be published after they have been agreed to by the governor, council, deemsters, and the twenty-four keys, and have obtained the royal assent. The council consists of the gover∣nor, bishop, archdeacon, the two vicars-general, the receiver-general, the comptroller, the bailiff, and the attorney-general. The twenty-four keys, so called, it is said from unlocking, as it were, or solving the difficulties of the law, represent the commons in making all new laws, and assist the deemsters in interpreting them, and deciding all difficult cases. The two deemsters are the temporal judges,
<PB N="406" REF="4140"/>
both in civil and criminal causes; but matters of small moment they determine at their houses. <Q>The deemster's oath is pretty singular: he swears to do justice “as equally between man and man, as the herring bone lies between the two sides;” that their daily food, as that fish was antiently, might put them in mind of the solemn engagements they had entered into.</Q> The island, with regard to its civil concerns, is divided into six sheadings, each of which has its coroner, who, in the name of the sheriff, is entrusted with the peace of his district, se∣cures criminals, and brings them to justice. Besides these, there is a moar and captain for every parish. The moars, who are changed yearly, are the king's bailiffs, and are answerable for the rents in their respective divisions; and the captains have the care of the militia or train-bands.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The religion and worship of the inhabitants are the same as the members of the church of England, Christianity was first planted here by St. Patrick a∣bout the year 440. The cathedral is dedicated to St. Germain, who was the first bishop of the isle. About the beginning of the eleventh century, when the Norwegians had made a conquest of this and the western isles, the see of Sodor, con∣taining most of those islands, was united to that of Man, and so continued till finally an∣nexed to the crown of England, about the end of the reign of Edward I. when, notwithstand∣ing the bishopric was now confined to the isle, the bishops still continue to stile themselves of Sodor and Man. The cathedral stands in the isle of Peele; but the bishop resides in the village of Balrury, in Kirkmichael parish, where he has a good palace, chapel, and gardens. Since the
<PB N="407" REF="4150"/>
late purchase, the king has the nomination of the bishop, who is subject to the jurisdiction of the archbishop of York. He has no seat in parlia∣ment; but has privileges superior to those of most other bishops in his own diocese, and sits uppermost in the lower house of convocation. The ecclesiasti∣cal courts are held by the bishop, either in person, or by his vicars-general; or by the archdeacon in person, or by his official. There are seventeen parish churches and four chapels in the four market-towns. All the livings, which are now pretty good, in consequence of certain augmen∣tations procured by the worthy Dr. Isaac Barrow, (who was bishop of Man, in the reign of Charles II.) except four, and the archdeaconry, were in the gift of the lord of the isle, and now in the king's. Ecclesiastical discipline is here maintained very strictly according to the canons; and the better to secure it, the bishop calls a convocation of his clergy, at least once a-year, in order to enquire how the discipline of the church has been observed, and to make such constitutions as are necessary for its better government. In all the courts of this island, ecclesiastical and civil, both men and wo∣men, who are natives of the island, usually plead their own causes. Strangers being unacquainted with the laws and language, are forced to employ others to speak for them: and as it is not long since there were any attornies, law-suits in consequence were determined without much charge. There are no papists natives of the island, nor dissenters of any other denomination, except a few quakers.</P>
<P>If a bishop's tenant is found guilty of a capital crime, (for which he may be tried in the bishop's court, and by a jury of his tenants) he forfeits his lands to the bishop, but his person and moveables are at the king's disposal.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="408" REF="4160"/>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>The language of the natives is a dialect of the Irish, and comes pretty near to that spoken in the Highlands of Scotland, with a mixture of Latin, Greek, Welsh, and English words. The Bible, or at least the New Testament, and the book of Common-Prayer, have been translated into the Manks language.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>MANNERS and CUSTOMS of the INHABITANTS.</HEAD>
<P>The number of the inhabitants is about twenty thousand. They are a very quiet, orderly sort of people, charitable to the poor, courteous to strangers, and very tenacious of their antient laws, liberties, and tenures. Antiently the women ne∣ver stirred abroad without their winding sheets, to put them in mind of their mortality; and when a female was sentenced to die for any heinous crime, she was sewed up in a sack, and thrown from a rock into the sea. The better sort have good substantial houses of stone, covered with slate; but those of the poorer people are thatched, which they secure against the winds by a net made of ropes of straw. They improve their lands with lime, sea-weed, or by folding their cattle and sheep in little enclosures of turf; the spaces within which are so enriched by their dung and urine, that they yield very good crops of corn. The common bread of the country is made of oatmeal, as in Scotland and Lancashire. If there is no sons, the eldest daughter inherits the lands and tenements, tho'there be more children. The wives, at their deaths, may dispose of one half of the goods, moveable and immoveable, notwith∣standing their husbands are alive, except in the six
<PB N="409" REF="4170"/>
northern parishes, where they can only dispose of a third, if they have had children. The women of the south are said to have obtained this superior pri∣vilege for assisting their husbands in a day of battle. A widow has one half of her husband's real estate, if she be his first wife, and one quarter if she be the second or third; but if any widow mar∣ries or miscarries, she loses her widow-right in her husband's estate. A child got before marriage shall inherit, provided the marriage follows within a-year or two, and the woman has never been de∣famed with regard to any other man. The executors of spiritual men have a right to the years profits, if they live till after twelve o'clock on Easter-day. If a single woman prosecutes a single man for a rape, and he is found guilty, the deemster de∣livers to the woman a rope, a sword, and a ring, and she has it in her choice to have him hanged or beheaded, or to save his life by marrying him. If any man gets a farmer's daughter with child, he must either marry her, or endow her with such a portion as her father would have given her. No man can alienate his estate, without the consent of the governor and other officers. When any person is to be summoned before a magistrate, he makes a mark upon a slate, generally the initials of the person's name. This is given to the proper officer with two-pence, who shews it to the person to be summoned, with the time when he is to appear, and at whose suit. If he refuses to obey, he is fined or committed to prison, till he gives bond to obey and pay costs. It is worthy observation here, as something singular, that the clergy of this island, in speaking or writing to them, are dignified like our knights and baronets with the title of Sir prefixed to their Christian names.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Castle-Town, or Castle-Russin, so called from a beautiful old castle built of a coarse kind of mar∣ble still entire, is the metropolis of the island, and the place where the governor and princi∣pal officers reside, where the chancery is kept, and the assizes are held twice a-year.</P>
<P>Peele was called Holm-town by the Norwe∣gians, from a small island close by it, in which stands the cathedral, now in ruins, except the chancel, kept in repair by the bishop. This isle, tho' strong by nature, was surrounded with a wall, towers, and other fortifications, by Thomas, earl of Derby. The town has been much enlarged of late, several merchants having settled in it, and built good houses.</P>
<P>Douglas. Here was formerly a nunnery, and now there is a free-school, with one of the best harbours in the three kingdoms, having a fine mole extending into the sea. It is the richest and most populous town in the whole island, has the best market, and enjoys the greatest share of trade. The merchants have large warehouses, vaults, and cellars for laying up goods.</P>
<P>Ramsea is noted for a spacious bay, in which ships may ride safe from all winds, except the north-east. As this town hath now a tolerable harbour, it begins to possess a greater trade, and to be much more considerable than it was formerly.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES and ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>There are a great many Runick inscriptions in this island, most of which are sepulchral, and still

entire. They are writ in the old Norwegian lan∣guage, now understood in the isle of Tero only.</P>
<P>There are also a great many tumuli, or barrows, and heaps of stones, especially in the parish of Kirk-Michael, besides monuments of large white stones in several places.</P>
<P>Brass daggers, and other instruments of the same metal, have been found in this island, buried under ground, together with nails of pure gold, which seem to have belonged to some royal target.</P>

<HEAD>Its NAME.</HEAD>
<P>THE antient names of this island were Hi∣bernia, Juverna, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Ierna, together with Iris, Iverdhon, and Ireland, which are all derived, according to Cambden, from Erin, the name by which it is known in the language of the antient natives. There are other derivations; but they seem more forced and farther fetched. As to the name Erin, Cambden thinks it is derived from the Irish word Hiere, signifying the west, or a tract or country westward; such being the situation of Ireland in respect of England and the continent of Europe. This country was also formerly stiled Scotia, or Scotland, and the in∣habitants Scots.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>Ireland is situated between the 5th and 10th de∣grees of west longitude, and between the 51st and
<PB N="413" REF="4210"/>
56th north latitude. The longest day in the south parts is sixteen hours and a half, and in the north seventeen hours and a quarter. It has the Deuca∣lidonian sea on the north and north-east; the At∣lantic ocean on the west; the Irish channel or sea, commonly called St. George's channel, on the east, dividing it from part of Scotland and England; and on the south the mouth of St. George's chan∣nel, called sometimes the Virgivian sea. It is about twenty-three miles distant from Port Pa∣trick in the county of Galway, in Scotland; about one hundred and fifty from Park-gate, near West-Chester; about seventy from Holyhead, in An∣glesey; as many from St. David's, in Pembroke∣shire; and from Bristol about two hundred. The number of inhabitants is computed at two millions five hundred thousand. It extends about three hundred miles in length where longest, and one hundred and fifty in breadth where broadest. Its circumference is reckoned at one thousand four hundred miles, and its superficial contents at eleven millions sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and twelve Irish, or seventeen millions nine hundred and twenty-seven thousand eight hundred and sixty-four English acres. The proportion it bears to England and Wales is supposed to be as eighteen to thirty, or rather as two to three.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>Before the marshes were drained, and many of the woods cut down, the air was very damp, thick, and foggy, and apt to occasion fluxes and rheums, especially among strangers; but now it is reckon∣ed, in general, pure and healthful, tho' still in∣ferior, in that respect, to the south of Eng∣land, the soil not being near so well drained or cultivated: however, it is at least equally mild
<PB N="414" REF="4220"/>
and temperate, neither the heat of summer nor the cold of winter being ever very violent; and wind, clouds, and rain, much more common than frost and snow. The air is now continually growing better, as the industry of the inhabitants increases, and the remaining bogs and fenny grounds are drained. The coolness of it however in summer is attended with this disadvantage, that the corn and fruits are not so soon nor so thorough∣ly ripened as in England. Against the moisture of the air, and its ill effects, the lower sort of people endeavour to defend themselves by the copious use of usquebaugh. It is said no ve∣nomous creatures, as snakes, toads, spiders, nor moles, will live here, and that the wood of the forests breeds no worms. The soil of Ireland is abundantly fruitful both in corn and grass, es∣pecially the latter; in consequence of which an infinite number of sheep and black cattle are bred particularly in the province of Connaught; and beef makes a very considerable article in their exports. The meadows yield the finest grass for hay, of which vast quantities are made, or rather spoiled, to fodder their black cattle, sheep, and horses, in winter. Few countries produce finer grain than what grows in the well cul∣tivated parts of Ireland. Tho' many bogs have been drained, yet numbers still remain. They are of several sorts. Some are covered with grass, some with reeds and rushes, and some with little shrubs, interspersed with water. Some yield plenty of very good turf. In others, called red bogs, large fir and other trees are often found. There are but few woods now in this country.</P>
<P><Q>“I make no doubt, says an ingenious gentle∣man that lately visited Ireland, but there is as much wood and timber growing in the county of
<PB N="415" REF="4230"/>
Kent, as in the whole kingdom of Ireland.”</Q> The northern and eastern counties are the best culti∣vated and enclosed, the most fertile, populous, flourishing, and industrious. Grazing, especially of black cattle, is the chief employment of the peasants all over Ireland, except in the province of Ulster, where the linen manufactory is the prin∣cipal object. The great obstacle to the prosperity and improvement of the kingdom is the extreme poverty and oppression of the common people. The produce of the kingdom, either in corn or cattle, is not above two thirds at most of what by good cultivation it might yield. The high-roads, throughout the southern and western parts, are lined with beggars, who live in huts or cabbins without chimnies, or any covering capable of de∣fending the wretched inhabitants from the cold, wind, and rain. <Q>“It is a scandal, says the same ju∣dicious traveller, to the proprietors of this fertile country, that there is not the greatest plenty of good corn and hay in it; but some of the best land in the king's dominions is suffered to be torn in pieces, and cultivated in the vilest manner, by a set of abject miserable occupiers, who are abso∣lutely no better than slaves to the despicably lazy and oppressive subordinate landlords.”</Q> No country in the world abounds more with beautiful lakes, or loughs, as they are called there, especially in the provinces of Ulster and Connaught. They are divided into fresh water and salt water lakes. Of the fresh water lakes, the largest are Lough-Neagh, lying between the counties of Armagh, Tyrone, Londonderry, Antrim, and Down; and Lough-Erne, which runs through the whole county of Fermanagh from the south-east to the north-west: but the most beautiful in the whole kingdom is the lake of Killarny, in the county of Kerry. Of the salt lakes, arms, or in∣lets
<PB N="416" REF="4240"/>
of the sea, the principal are Strongford-lake, in the county of Down, Lough-Swilly, in that of Donnegal, and Lough-Foyle, in that of Derry. Though they have good coal-pits in some places, yet the principal fuel of the country is turf; but most of the towns upon the coast are supplied with coal from England or Scotland. The commodities that Ireland furnishes for exportation are principally these, cattle, hides, tallow, butter, cheese, honey, wax, wool, and woollen cloth, salmon, herrings, coarse rugs, friezes, ratteens, camlets, timber, pipe-staves, hemp, and linen cloth in great quantities, the soil be∣ing very proper for flax and hemp, of both which a great deal is raised, especially in the northern parts. The inhabitants have hitherto applied themselves almost wholly to the breeding of cattle; but the parliament of Ireland hath of late distin∣guished itself by its attention to the true interests of their country, and by the vigorous and patriotic measures it hath taken to promote agriculture, trade, population, and police, and to banish ig∣norance, popery, and superstition. England reap great advantages from its commerce with Ireland, supplying it with almost all sorts of goods, linen, woollen stuffs, and provisions excepted. The Irish formerly exported woollen stuffs to Spain and Holland; but the trade of England suffering, as the former could sell their goods much cheaper, this trade was prohibited by parliament: however, to make them amends, great encouragement is given to the linen manufacture, which they are al∣lowed to import into England, together with raw wool, and, in time of scarcity, provisions. The roads in this kingdom are generally tolerably good for riding, running sometimes ten or fifteen miles in a strait line; but they are not equal to the English for a carriage. Turnpikes are established
<PB N="41" REF="4250"/>
on all the principal roads, and the inns are tolerable; but few are provided with good hay or litter for horses. They have a variety of game, excellent hawks, and horses that are noted for their easy pacing. There are no wolves now, unless on the wild unfrequented mountains, where they have been heard to howl in hard winters. Bees abound in this island, and a great deal of honey is made by them not only in hives, but also in trunks of trees, and caverns of the earth. Vines are common enough, but the heat of the cli∣mate is seldom sufficient to bring the grapes to maturity. The principal rivers of Ireland are the Shannon, Barrow, Neor, Suir, Bann, Lee, Liffy, and Boyne. The Shannon, which gives title of earl to a branch of the family of Boyle, is a very noble river, larger than any in England, but not navigable above fifty miles, on account of a ridge of rocks south of Killaloe running quite across it, and stopping all navigation further up. It runs from north to south upwards of three hundred English miles, spreading itself into many large and beautiful lakes of different extent, from five to ten and fifteen miles, abounding with salmon, pike, &amp;c. of a very large size; and some of the lakes are adorned with fertile and beautiful islands. The Lee rises in the county of Cork, below which city it falls into the sea, after an easterly course for about twenty-six miles. The Liffy rises in the county of Wicklow, and falls into the Irish sea below Dublin. The Boyne, remarkable for the victory gained on its banks by king William III. over king James II. and his adherents, rises in the King's county, and falls into the sea at Drogheda. The Barrow, Neor, and Suir, have their sources in different branches of one and the same mountain, namely Slieu-Bloom, and fall, after having united their streams, into the sea at Hook-point, at the mouth of the haven of
<PB N="418" REF="4260"/>
Waterford. The Bann, famous for a pearl fishery, but much more for that of salmon, rises in the county of Down, and falls into Lough-Neagh, in the county of Armagh. Here are a great num∣ber of fair, spacious, and commodious harbours, the chief of which are Waterford-haven, Carling∣ford-haven, Strangford-haven, the bay of Car∣rickfergus, on the east; Lough-Foyle and Lough-Swilly, Ship-haven, Killybegs-harbour, Donne∣gal-haven, on the north; Galway-haven, the mouth of the Shannon, Swerwick or St. Mary∣wick-haven, Dingle-bay, on the west; Kimare-bay, or river, Bantry-bay, Dunmanus-bay, Bal∣timore-bay, Castle-haven, Glendore-haven, King∣fale-haven, and Cork-haven, on the south and south-east. These are the principal unbarred havens. There are also a great many barred havens, some of which have been much improved by acts of parliament, particularly that of Dublin. Tho' Ireland cannot be called a mountainous country, yet are there several lofty chains, as well as single mountains in the kingdom. Three words in the Irish express the different degrees of their elevation, namely, Knock, Slieve, and Bein. Among the last, or highest sort, are the mountains of Car∣lingford; the Curlieus, which separate the coun∣ties of Sligoe, Roscommon, and Connaught; those in the county of Donnegal, about Lough-Swilly; the Mangerton mountains in the county of Kerry; Croagh-Patrick, in the county of Mayo, from whence, as fabulous tradition relates, St. Patrick drove all serpents and venomous creatures into the sea; the Gualty mountains in the county of Tip∣perary; Slieu-bloom, called by some writers the Blandine mountains, celebrated by the immortal Spencer in his Fairy Queen, running thro' part of the King and Queen's counties, and part of the county of Tipperary; the Brandon mountains in the
<PB N="419" REF="4270"/>
county of Kerry, to the east of Smerwick-bay; Slieu∣galen, in the county of Tyrone; the mountains of Wicklow, particularly the Sugar-loaf-hill; the mountains of Mourne and Iveagh, in the county of Down, reckoned among the highest in the king∣dom, particularly that called Slein-Donard, which is said to be one thousand and fifty-six yards in perpendicular heighth, and many others, several of which contain veins of iron, lead, copper, mi∣nerals, coals, quarries of stone, slate, and marble. The chief capes or head-lands are, Fair-head, or Fair-foreland, Cape-horn, and Telen-head on the north; Slime-head, or Sline-head, Loop-head, or Cape-lain, and Cape-Dorses on the west; Missen∣head, Cape-Courcey, or the Old-head of Kingsale on the south; Ardmore-head, Arklow-head, Wick∣low-head, Bray-head, Hoath-head, and St. John's Foreland on the east.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>We have already mentioned the commodities of Ireland, by which, and its natural situation, ex∣tended coasts, harbours, bays, and rivers, commo∣dious for navigation, we may perceive how well it is formed and furnished for an extensive traffic: but the English, from a principle of self-preservation, and to prevent the ruin of their own commerce, have thought proper to restrain and discourage that of Ireland in some articles, particularly with regard to wool and woollen goods; for wool and bay-yarn are allowed to be exported only to England: yet from a thirst of gain, all hazards are run to send them by stealth into other countries, to the great detriment of the English woollen ma∣nufactures. The chief manufacture of Ireland, and the principal branch of its commerce, con∣sists in linnen cloth, yarn, lawns, and cambricks,
<PB N="420" REF="4280"/>
which are the principal sources of whatever wealth there is in that country. Besides, they export con∣siderable quantities of butter, tallow, leather, bar∣relled beef and pork, and herrings. Ship-build∣ing is no inconsiderable branch of business, and employs a great many hands. In good years they export a great deal of corn to Portugal; but when their crops fail, they have recourse to England for supplies. Besides the wool and yarn brought to England, and clandestinely exported, together with woollen manufactures, their home consump∣tion is so entirely supplied thereby, that not a single article of that kind is wanted from abroad. The chief articles of their importation are wine, brandy, tobacco, spices, hops, coals, copper, block tin, lead, West-India commodities, mercery, grocery, and haberdashery goods, and of these the greater part comes from England. But all their cloaths, equipages, furniture, and many of their silks, are made at home. By a late compu∣tation, the protestants are not above one-sixth part of the inhabitants. The papists are mostly employed in country-work, as tilling the land; and raising cattle; and the protestants, English, and Scots, are generally embarked in trade and manufactures. The present revenue of Ireland is estimated at about half a million. The country suffers greatly by remittances to the absentees, both in England and abroad; for there are several regiments of Irish in the service of France and Spain, besides many officers of their nation in the armies of different powers of Europe: a way of life to which they are inclined, partly by their martial disposition, and partly by the discourage∣ments to which their religion subjects them in Ireland.</P>

<PB N="421" REF="4290"/>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>Christianity seems to have been first planted here by Palladius in the fifth century, but more fully by his successor St. Patrick, who is said to have been born in Clydesdale in Scotland. The island is commonly called by the antient histo∣rians Insula Sanctorum, as having produced more saints, martyrs, and confessors, than any other nation in the world. St. Patrick appears to have come hither about the year 432, to have retired in 465, and to have died in 492. The established religion at present is the same as in England, both in doctrine and discipline; and the government of the church is under four archbishops, viz. of Armagh, who is primate of all Ireland, of Dublin, who is stiled primate of Ireland, of Cashell, and Tuam. These archbishops have under them twenty suffra∣gan bishops, whose sees are generally well endowed, viz. the first eight, the second three, the third five, and the last four. Ireland has only one uni∣versity, namely, that of Dublin, which is wholly devoted to the church of England; but the num∣ber of students fall far short of either of the two English universities.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CIVIL GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The constitution of the government of Ireland differs but little from that of England. The king sends a viceroy, who, at different periods, hath been stiled custos, or keeper, justiciary, warden, procurator, seneschal, constable, justice, justice's∣deputy, and lieutenant, and who comes as near the grandeur and majesty of a king, both in au∣thority and state, as any viceroy in Christendom. To assist him on all occasions, he has a privy coun∣cil,
<PB N="422" REF="4300"/>
composed of the officers of state, and such others as his majesty is pleased to appoint. The parliament is called, prorogued, and dissolved, at the pleasure of the sovereign. During former reigns, the same parliament continued till the death of the king: but by a late act, a new parliament is to be chosen every eight years. The several orders and degrees of the people and nobility, are much the same here as in England; as are also the courts of justice, their terms, and man∣ner of proceeding, assizes, justices of the peace, &amp;c. The island is divided into four provinces, namely, Munster, Leinster, Connaught, and Ulster; and these again into five circuits, containing thirty-two counties, of which Tipperary is a palatinate, and that of Dublin is not comprehended in any of the five circuits. The greater part of the re∣venues of this kingdom are employed in the sup∣port of the government.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LAWS.</HEAD>
<P>The antient judges of this country were called brehons, and seem to have had some kind of writ∣ten laws to guide them in their decisions. They had the eleventh part of all the fines in criminal cases, which brought them in a good income; the greatest crimes, as murder, rapes, and rob∣beries, being then only punished in that manner. The Irish laws and customs prevailed over a great part of the kingdom, till the whole was reduced by queen Elizabeth, and modelled according to the English constitution by king James I. The common law of England, together with their own statutes and acts of parliament, is now the rule both in the courts at Dublin, and all those subordinate to them.</P>

<PB N="423" REF="4310"/>
<HEAD>Antient History and State of IRELAND.</HEAD>
<P>Setting aside the ridiculous legends and fables of the Irish with respect to their antiquity and ori∣gin, it seems highly reasonable to conclude, that the country was first peopled from Britain. There is no good reason to induce us to believe, that it was ever conquered by the Romans, notwith∣standing what hath been alledged to the contrary. Towards the decline of the Roman empire, a colony of Scots began to make a great figure in Ireland, whence it acquired the name of Scotia. This colony is supposed to have come original∣ly from Spain. The island was afterwards of∣ten harrassed by the Norwegians and Saxons; but never entirely subdued till Henry II. king of England, made himself master of it. It hath been ever since subject to the kings of Eng∣land, who were only stiled lords of Ireland, till the title of king was bestowed on Henry VIII. by the states of the realm in parliament assembled.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the Establishments for EDUCATION in Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>Besides the university of Dublin, of which we shall give an account when we describe that city, and a great number of free-schools erected in different parts of the kingdom, both by public and private munificence, there are many Eng∣lish protestant working-schools, erected by a so∣ciety incorporated by a charter passed for that pur∣pose, than which a more effectual method could not have been contrived for the instruction of the poor popish natives of Ireland in the principles of real christianity, and for inuring them to industry, labour, and obedience to their sovereign. Of these schools there are now a great number filled
<PB N="424" REF="4320"/>
with children, who are not only maintained with all necessaries, brought up to labour and industry, and instructed in the duties of true religion, but, when qualified, are put out apprentices to protestant masters: after their apprenticeships are expired, a portion of five pounds is given to him or her who marries a protestant with the appro∣bation of the committee of fifteen. There is also in Dublin a charter-nursery, where children sent up from the country in rags are cloathed, fed, taught, and attended by a master, mistress, and nurse, from whence they are transplanted to coun∣try-schools as occasion offers. The free-schools in Ireland amounted in the year 1748, to one hundred and sixty-eight, in which were educated three thou∣sand and six children, exclusive of thirty protestant working-schools, in which eight hundred and eighty-five children were fed, cloathed, and taught gratis.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the IRISH BARDS or POETS.</HEAD>
<P>Antiently the bards were very numerous in Ireland. Their business was chiefly to transmit to posterity the heroic and memorable actions of fa∣mous men. The romantic tales contained in their ballads, psalters, chronicles, and traditions, concerning their antient heroes, would fill a great number of volumes. The number of these bards, which amounted at one time to near a third part of the nation, with their destructive privileges and great idleness, rendering them at last a public nui∣sance, a convention was held at Dromceat, express∣ly for removing it: when a reform was actually effected, and by degrees, as the country became more enlightened and industrious, a change of manners and customs took place; and the bards, as an institution or order of men in the state, in the end entirely disappeared.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="425" REF="4330"/>
<HEAD>CHARACTER of the INHABITANTS.</HEAD>
<P>The Irish of the present generation are a medley of the descendants of the antient, or, as they have been usually called, wild Irish, and of the English emigrants. As to the descendants of the antient Irish, whose names generally begin with Mae or O, those on the east and west coasts seem to be of a different origin. The inhabitants of the east and north coasts, who probably came origi∣nally from Britain, and into Britain from Gaul, are of a squat set stature, with short broad faces, thick lips, hollow eyes, and noses turned up; whereas those on the western coast seem, to be de∣scended from a colony of Spaniards, whom they resemble in their persons, being tall and slender, finely limbed, with grave and sedate countenances, long eye-brows, and lank dark hair. But though these distinctions are now in a great measure worn out by intermarriages with one another and the English, since the conquest of Ireland by Henry II. yet they are still discernible. The language of the antient Irish seems to be a mixture of the old British and the Cantabrian or Spanish; but it is now in a manner lost, or understood by few, except of the poorer sort. With respect to their character, the native Irish seem to have degenerated from their ancestors in valour and learning, being ignorant, superstitious, and credulous, in conse∣quence of their blind submission to their popish priests. Impatient of abuse and injury, they are implacable and violent in all their affections; but quick of apprehension, constant in love, courteous to strangers, and patient of hardships. In the service of foreign princes they are distinguished by their courage and fidelity; though not remarkable
<PB N="426" REF="4340"/>
for their bravery at home. The music they admire most is that of the harp and bagpipe. The surnames, especially of the better sort, have generally an O or Mac, which signifies son, placed before them. The Irish, at present, are said to be much given to drinking; and, in general, possessed with a no∣tion that they cannot lay any claim to the character of being polite, unless they lay it down as a maxim in entertaining strangers never to suffer them to depart from their house sober: but we must do them the justice to own, that this notion is com∣mon to them with some other European nations, who value themselves much upon their politeness. Thus does a false taste, joined to a ridiculous va∣nity and ostentation, usurp the sacred name of friendship and hospitality: indeed, among the more sensible part of the natives of Ireland, such no∣tions and practices are justly despised and ex∣ploded. The inhabitants are very far from be∣ing what they have been too often represented by those who had never an opportunity of know∣ing their real character, but were blinded with prejudice. Whoever visits Ireland will find as great a proportion of genius, civility, and under∣standing, even in the very lowest class of the na∣tives, as in most other countries. A late traveller represents their common people, those especially of the Roman catholic persuasion, as labouring under the greatest oppression, poverty, and sla∣very, being fleeced, or rather flead, by their hard-hearted priests and landlords. He says, if there are any wild Irish remaining, it is in the province of Connaught, the common people there having the least sense of law and government of any in Ire∣land, except their tyrannic landlords, who, in a literal sense, are absolute sovereigns over their re∣spective towns and clans. English is the uiversal
<PB N="427" REF="4350"/>
language of Ireland among people of any fortune, and very few of the lowest class are to be met with who cannot speak it: many of them speak both English and Irish equally well. At the inns, tho' they are far from making the appearance of those in England, yet the traveller will generally meet with civil usage, with good provisions, and for himself clean decent lodging; but, for want of good hay and litter, the case will be far otherwise with his horse. "The people of Ireland, says the gentleman we hinted at above, especially those of any fortune, are genteel, sprightly, sen∣sible, sociable, and generally well affected to the English, from whom their dress, fashions, and diversions are taken. The Englishman that can drink will find them as hospitable as any people in Europe; if he can drink like an Irishman, he will be heartily welcome to eat like an English∣man." But though he cannot help inveighing against their false notions of hospitality, he allows that there is a native sprightliness and sociability, a generosity and frankness in their general man∣ner, that is conspicuous and engaging, and which cannot fail of recommending them to strangers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>An exemption from serpents and other veno∣mous creatures, a favour granted by providence to few other parts of the habitable globe, if we ex∣cept the islands of Crete and Yvica, hath been al∣ready mentioned. Ireland indeed has spiders and newts, but not poisonous. The vulgar Irish, and many of the learned, are so weak as to ascribe this exemption to a miracle wrought by St. Patrick, notwithstanding Solinus, who lived some centu∣ries before him, mentions this property as a circumstance well known in his time. Another
<PB N="428" REF="4360"/>
curiosity, as they may well be reckoned, tho' the breed is now almost extinct, are the Irish wolf dogs. They are large and strong, and of a fine shape. Presents of them have been often made to princes and other great men, and highly valued. The goshawks and ger-falcons may be also mentioned under this head, as they are esteemed the best in the world. The ger-falcons, the largest bird of the falcon kind, approaching the size of a vulture, and of the greatest strength next the eagle, as they are but rarely to be met with, so they excel all other hawks in beauty. Formerly there was a large fowl, called the cock of the wood, in Ire∣land. It equalled a peacock in size; but the spe∣cies, both of them and the moose-deer, whose horns have been often discovered under ground in bogs, are now extinct. Other curiosities in Ireland are the many beautiful lakes and inlets of the sea, abounding in fish and interspersed with islands, embellished with a variety of shrubs and trees; the glyns or deep narrow vallies among the mountains, whose sides are adorned with woods, and the bottoms watered with chrystal streams; the many wonderful cataracts, falls, or salmon∣leaps, as they are called, from the salmon, which in the season of the year for spawning, are conti∣nually leaping over them; that surprizing phe∣nomenon, in the county of Antrim, called the Giants-causeway; and, lastly, the bogs, which supply the country with very good fuel, and are some of them of great extent. This fuel seems to consist of rotten wood, or the roots of the heath, converted into a kind of black combustible spongy mud or substance, which when dug, or cut out of the bog, in oblong pieces and dried, make very good firing. Thus much in general of the natural curiosities of Ireland, for which, perhaps, no country in the world is more
<PB N="429" REF="4370"/>
remarkable. Of antiquities and artificial curiosi∣ties, the number is not great. The most worthy of note are the tall slender towers built of lime and stone, and dispersed thro' various parts of the kingdom. Some of the most remarkable curiosi∣ties we shall treat of at large in the counties where they are found. We now proceed to a more particular description of the several provinces of Ireland, and the counties contained in each, be∣ginning with Ulster, in the north.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROVINCE of ULSTER.</HEAD>
<P>This province, which is called in Latin Ulto∣nia, in Irish Cui Guilly, and gives title of earl to the dukes of York of the royal family, has the Atlantic ocean on the west; St. George's channel and the Irish sea on the east; the Deucalidonean ocean on the north; and on the south and south-west, the provinces of Leinster and Connaught. Its greatest length is near one hundred and twenty miles, its breadth about one hundred, and its circumference, including the windings and turn∣ings, four hundred and sixty, containing nine counties, fifty-eight market-towns and boroughs, one archbishopric, six bishoprics, and two hun∣dred and fourteen parishes. Ulster abounds in lakes and rivers, which supply it with variety of fine fish, especially salmon, besides what it has from the sea, with which a great part of it is bounded. The southern parts of it are rich, fer∣tile, well cultivated, and enclosed; but the greater part of the northern is open and mountainous. The towns of this province are, in general, the neatest and best built of any in Ireland, as well as the farm-houses, which, in most parts of the kingdom, are constructed of no better materials than clay and straw. The inhabitants of Ulster are also more like the English in their manner and
<PB N="430" REF="4380"/>
dialect, than those of the other three provinces: for as it includes within itself the whole, or by far the greater part of the linen manufactory, the best branch of trade in the kingdom, they have conse∣quently the greatest intercourse with England. An Englishman in some parts of it, indeed, will imagine himself, from the similarity of their lan∣guage and manners, in his own country. The Scots that came and settled in Britain under Fergus are said to have been transplanted from hence. This province had antiently petty kings of its own. It was first subjected to the English in the reign of Hen∣ry II. by John Courcy, the first who bore the title of earl of Ulster; but it afterwards threw off the yoke, and was never entirely reduced till the reign of James I. when great numbers of Scots, by his encouragement, went and settled in it. Of these, most of the present inhabitants are the descendants. This province was the first and principal scene of the bloody massacre in 1641. The counties con∣tained in it are, Donnegal, Londonderry, Antrim, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan, Ar∣magh, and Down.</P>

<HEAD>The county of DONNEGAL, or TYRCONNEL.</HEAD>
<P>This county has the sea on the north and west, the bay of Donnegal and the county of Ferma∣nagh on the south, the counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, and part of Fermanagh on the east. Its greatest length from south-east to north-west is sixty-four miles, and its breadth thirty-five, be∣ing well peopled and cultivated. The air is good, and the soil, in general, fertile, the boggy grounds having of late been much drained and improved by shells brought from the sea-shore, and spread upon them as manure. It contains five baronies, and about six hundred and thirty thousand acres, abounds with harbours, and now gives title of
<PB N="431" REF="4390"/>
earl to a family of English extraction, of the name of Carpenter, but antiently to the O Don∣nels and Talbots. It sends to parliament two members for the shire, and two for each of the following boroughs, viz. St. Johnstown, Don∣negal, Ballyshannon, Killibegs, and Lifford.</P>
<P>Donnegal, which gives name to the county, and the title of earl to a family of the name of Chi∣chester, stands on a great bay, full of good har∣bours, yet has not much trade. It is true, there are such shelves in the mouth of the bay, that it requires an expert pilot.</P>
<P>St. Johnstown is a small town on the river Foyle, to the north-west of Derry.</P>
<P>Ballyshannon stands on the river that issues from Lough-Erne, not far from its mouth. It has a harbour and some trade, and is pretty well inha∣bited. At a fall near it is a salmon-fishery, the property of lord Donnegal, which lets for sixteen hundred pounds per annum.</P>
<P>Lifford, which stands on the river Foyle, tho' a small place, is the shire-town, and gives the title of baron to earl Fitzwilliams.</P>
<P>Killybegs stands on a fine bay, and has a good harbour, but little trade.</P>
<P>Raphoe, though a poor place, is the see of a bishop, and has a free-school, with a stately castle for the residence of the bishop.</P>
<P>Laterkenny, Rathmetton, Buncranagh, and Rathmullen, are all small places. The last has a small harbour on the sea-coast.</P>
<P>The salt-water lake, or rather arm of the sea, called Lough-Swilly, runs eighteen miles up into this county, and is about five miles broad at its mouth. A thousand sail might ride in it with safety. There are many villages and gentlemen's seats on its banks, but no town or trade of any consequence. In short, all the north-west part of
<PB N="432" REF="4400"/>
Ireland is full of lakes, bays, and harbours, but, for want of trade, very little known or frequented. Two of the most remarkable fresh-water lakes in this county are Lough-Derg and Lough-Fin, the former of which contains an island, in which was antiently a cell or cave much frequented by the Ro∣man Catholics, both natives and foreigners, who came hither in pilgrimage, and to do penance. Here the friars made their deluded votaries believe, that, for the conviction of unbelievers, St. Pa∣trick had, by his prayers, obtained of God that purgatory should be visible. But to prevent their discovering the cheat, they made them watch and fast so rigorously, by way of preparation, before they were suffered to enter it, and told them such horrid stories, that their brains were in a manner turn∣ed; in consequence of which they actually fancied they saw the pains of purgatory. In king James I's time, some gentlemen, being sent to inquire into this matter, found that it was a little vault hewed out of a rock, capable of containing six or eight persons, and quite dark when the door was shut. Upon the report made by these gentlemen, the friars were ordered to quit the island, their houses were demolished, and the cell laid open, as it has remained ever since.</P>

<HEAD>LONDONDERRY, or COLERAIN.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the south and south-west by the county of Tyrone; by Antrim on the east, from which it is parted by the river Bann; by Donnegal on the west; and that county and the Deucalidonean ocean on the north. Its greatest length is about thirty-six miles, its breadth thirty, containing about two hundred and fifty-one thousand five hundred and ten acres. The bogs and heaths of this county are manured with sea∣shells,
<PB N="433" REF="4410"/>
as those of Donnegal. Like that too it is pretty champain, and not unfruitful. It is par∣ticularly noted for a very clear river, called the Bann, abounding with salmon, a fish said to delight in limpid streams. This river, to distinguish it from a lesser of the same name, is called the Greater or Lower Bann. In order to cultivate, settle, and civilize this county, king James I. granted it, by letters patent to a society, by the name of the governor and assistants at London of the new plan∣tation of Ulster in the realm of Ireland. It con∣tains six baronies, and, besides the two knights of the shire, sends to parliament two members for the city of Londonderry, and two each for Cole∣rain, and Newton-Limavady, or Lamnevady.</P>
<P>Londonderry, or Derry, the capital of the county, and the fee of a bishop, stands at the bottom of Lough-Foyle. This city has a very good port, to which ships of the greatest burden have access, and a considerable trade. It will be ever famous for the gallantry and perseverance with which it defended itself in three memorable sieges, in defiance of the greatest hardships and discouragements, namely, 1st, In 1641, when the rebels could not reduce it either by fraud or force. 2dly, In 1649, when it was besieged by the lord Ardes, and reduced almost to extremity by famine, till at last relieved by troops sent from Eng∣land. 3dly, When it held out against the French and Irish from the 7th of December, 1688, to the last day of July, 1689, though it was neither well fortified, nor provided with a garrison or stores of provision and ammunition, and hardly any at∣tempt made to relieve it during so long a time: Tho' the city is twenty miles up the river, yet very large ships can come up to the key, where there is four or five fathoms of water. It is now well fortified with a strong wall, besides outworks;
<PB N="434" REF="4420"/>
and along the banks of the river are several castles and a fort. This city is of no great antiquity, having been built and planted in the reign of James I. by a colony sent by the society abovementioned. The trade of the town is very considerable, having not only a large share in the herring-fishery, but sending ships also to the West-Indies, New-Eng∣land, and Newfoundland, for which they are so ad∣vantageously situated, that a vessel bound from thence to America often arrive there before a Lon∣don ship can get clear of the soundings, or arrive in the latitude of Londonderry. Tho' there are a great many shallows in Lough Foyle, which serves it instead of a road, yet they are easily avoided, as there are deep channels between them. Those points called Emistone, Rusterhull, or Caldy-head, which lie a little to the west of the mouth of the harbour, are counted the most northerly of Ireland, lying in lat. 55° 20′. The inhabitants of this city are a most all protestants. <Q>It gives title of earl and baron to a branch of the family of Pitt. A late traveller says, “Derry is, perhaps, the cleanest, best built, and most beautifully situated town in Ireland; and excepting Cork as conve∣nient as any for commerce, foreign and domestic, and, but for the restrictions on the trade of Ire∣land, would in a few years become a flourishing and wealthy city.”</Q> The lake almost surrounds it, and the whole ground-plot both of it and its liber∣ties belongs to the twelve great companies of London. Great quantities of salmon, salted and barrelled, are exported from hence to America.</P>
<P>Colerain is a handsome walled town, standing near the mouth of the Great Bann. It would pro∣bably be a place of good trade, if the river, by being confined within a narrow channel, was not so extremely rapid, that it is difficult for vessels, even with the help of the tide, to stem the current;
<PB N="435" REF="4430"/>
besides, ships of burden cannot get in at all. Here, however, is a very valuable salmon fishery; one in particular belonging to the city of London, which lets for fifteen hundred pounds a-year. Be∣fore the building of Londonderry, the county took its name from this town, which gives title of barôn to a family of the surname of Hanger.</P>
<P>Newton-Limavaddy is a thriving market-town on a river called Ree-water, near Lough-Foyle.</P>
<P>Magherafelt, and Ballinderry, are small incon∣siderable places.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTRIM.</HEAD>
<P>This is the most northern county of Ireland, and is bounded by that of Down on the south-east, that of Londonderry on the west, from which it is separated by the river Bann, part of Armagh on the south, St. George's channel on the east, and the Deucalidonian - ocean on the north. Its greatest length is about forty-six miles, its greatest breadth about twenty-seven, and the number of acres it contains, plantation measure, are computed at three hundred and eighty-three thou∣sand. Tho' the county is much incumbered with bogs and marshes, yet it enjoys a pretty good air, and is well peopled, chiefly with protestants. Where it is free from bogs the soil is fruitful. It sends two members for the shire, and two for each of the following towns, viz. Lisburn, Belfast, Antrim, and Randalstown.</P>
<P>Belfast is the most considerable town in all this part of Ireland for extent, wealth, trade, and number of inhabitants. The harbour below the town is commodious, and has a good depth of water. A great trade is carried on from hence to Scotland, particularly to Glasgow; and most of the inhabitants, both of the town and the neigh∣bouring
<PB N="436" REF="4440"/>
country, are of Scotch extraction, and of the presbyterian religion. Three miles from hence is a very beautiful seat belonging to—Hill, esquire.</P>
<P>Lisburn is a small town, seated on a river called Lagen-water, which falls into Carrickfergus-bay. It gives the title of viscount to the right honoura∣ble Wilmot Vaughan, one of the lords of trade and plantation.</P>
<P>Antrim, which gives name to the county, and the title of earl to the antient family of M'Donnel, is a considerable town, pleasantly situated on a branch of Lough-Neagh, called the Six-mile-water, on which it has a harbour for boats.</P>
<P>Randalstown, tho' a parliamentary borough, is a place of little note.</P>
<P>Carrickfergus, or Knockfergus, that is the Rock of Fergus, so called from Fergus I. king of Scotland, who, after quelling a rebellion here, was cast away in the bay in his return to Scotland, is a populous town, walled and fortified, with an excellent harbour, and defended by a castle on a high rock. In the road before the town there is depth enough of water for large ships; but small vessels only can come up to the pier. Here the assizes and quarter-sessions are kept both for the county at large, and for the town and its liber∣ties, which are a distinct county; and there is a gaol here for both. Tho' it has not the privilege of sending members to parliament, yet it is a cor∣poration, and has a good market.</P>
<P>The monastery Maigio, often mentioned by Bede, is supposed to have been upon an island, or rather peninsula, near Carrickfergus, called Magge.</P>
<P>Certain narrow valleys, called glyns, beginning here, and running a great way along the coast, be∣longed formerly to the Bissets, noblemen of Scot∣land,
<PB N="437" REF="4450"/>
who having been obliged to quit that country for having assassinated Patrick, earl of Athol, upon a private quarrel, came hither, and had a great estate bestowed upon them by Henry III. of England; of which, in the reign of Ed∣ward II. a part was forfeited by the rebellion of Hugh, then chief of the family. Another tract near this, called the Rowte, belonged antiently to the Macguilliers, but now to the M'Donnels, earls of Antrim.</P>
<P>Donluce, which stands on the coast of the nor∣thern ocean, is fortified with a strong castle built on a rock, and gives the title of viscount to the earl of Antrim.</P>
<P>Connor, though a poor place, is a bishop's see united with Down.</P>
<P>Ballymoney, Larne, Ballymenagh, Toom, Bally∣castle, having a coal-pit, and Bush, are all small towns in this county.</P>
<P>Toom is situated on the narrow strait betwixt Lough-Neagh and Lough-beg.</P>
<P>Bush stands on the sea-coast, and near it is that re∣markable natural curiosity, called the Giant's cause∣way, which is perhaps unexceptionably one of the greatest and most singular natural curiosities in the known world; for it is, indeed, the only exhibition of the kind that was yet ever met with in the creation. The principal, or grand causeway, for there are several less considerable and scattered fragments of similar workmanship, consists of a most irregular arrangement of many hundred thou∣sands of columns of a black kind of rock, hard as marble: almost all of them are of a pentagonal figure, but so closely and compactly situated on their sides, though perfectly distinct from top to bottom, that scarce any thing can be introduced between them. The columns are of an unequal height and breadth, some of the highest, visible
<PB N="438" REF="4460"/>
above the surface of the strand, and at the foot of the impending angular precipice, may be about twenty feet; they do not exceed this height, at least none of the principal arrangement. How deep they are fixed in the strand was never yet discovered. This grand arrange∣ment extends nearly two hundred yards, vi∣sible at low water, how far beyond is uncer∣tain; from its declining appearance, however, at low water, it is probable, it does not extend under water to a distance any thing equal to what is seen above. The breadth of the principal causeway, which runs out in one continued range of columns is, in general, from twenty to thirty feet, at one place or two it may be nearly forty for a few yards. In this account are excluded the broken and scattered pieces of the same kind of construction, that are detached from the sides of the grand causeway, as they do not appear to to have ever been contiguous to the principal arrangement, though they have frequently been taken into the width; which has been the cause of such wild and dissimilar representations of this causeway, which different accounts have exhi∣bited. The highest part of this causeway is the nar∣rowest at the very foot of the impending cliff, from whence the whole projects, where for four or five yards, it is not above ten or fifteen feet wide. The columns of this narrow part incline from a perpendicular a little to the westward, and form a slope on their tops, by the very unequal height of the columns on the two sides, by which an ascent is made at the foot of the cliff, from the head of one column to the next above, gradatim, to the top of the great causeway, which, at the distance of half a dozen yards from the cliff, ob∣tains a perpendicular position, and lowering in its general height, widens to about twenty or between
<PB N="439" REF="4470"/>
twenty and thirty feet, and for one hundred yards nearly is always above water. The tops of the co∣lumns for this length being nearly of an equal height, they form a grand and singular parade, that may be easily walked on, rather inclining to the water's edge. But from high water-mark, as it is perpetually washed by the beating surges on every return of the tide, the platform lowers con∣siderably, and becomes more and more uneven, so as not to be walked on but with the greatest care. At the distance of one hundred and fifty yards from the cliff, it turns a little to the east for twenty or thirty yards, and then sinks into the sea. Thus far we have traced the general figure and outlines only of this most singular phaenome∣non; we will now point out the circumstances that are particularly curious and extraordinary in this causeway, which are, the figure of the columns, their construction, and close combination with each other; together with the general disposition of the several phaenomena of this kind about the place. The figure of these columns is almost un∣exceptionably pentagonal, or composed of five sides, there are but very few of any other figure introduced; some few there are of three, four, and six sides, but the generality of them are five sided, and the spectator must look very nicely to find any of a different construction: yet what is very extraordinary, and particularly curious, there are not two columns in ten thousand to be found, that either have their sides equal among themselves, or whose figures are alike. Nor is the composition of these columns or pillars less deserving the atten∣tion of the curious spectator. They are not of one solid stone in an upright position, but com∣posed of several short lengths, curiously joined, not with flat surfaces, but articulated into each other, like ball and socket, or like the joints in the
<PB N="440" REF="4480"/>
vertebrae of some of the larger kind of fish, the one end at the joint having a cavity, into which the convex end of the opposite is exactly fitted. This is not visible, but by disjoining the two stones. The depth of the concavity or convexi∣ty is generally about three or four inches. And what is still farther remarkable of the joint, the convexity, and the correspondent concavity, is not conformed to the external angular figure of the column, but exactly round, and as large as the size or diameter of the column will admit; and, consequently, as the angles of these columns are, in general, extremely unequal, the circular edges of the joint is seldom coincident with more than two or three sides of the pentagonal, and from the edge of the circular part of the joint to the exterior sides and angles they are quite plain. It is still farther very remarkable, likewise, that the articulations of these joints are frequently inverted; in some the concavity is upwards, in others the reverse. This occasions that variety and mixture of concavities and convexities on the tops of the columns, which is observable throughout the platform of this causeway, yet without any disco∣verable design or regularity with respect to the number of either. The length, also, of these par∣ticular stones, from joint to joint, is various; in general, they are from eighteen to twenty-four inches long, and, for the most part, longer toward the bottom of the columns than nearer the top, and the articulation of the joints something deeper. The size, or diameter, likewise, of the columns is as different as their length and figure; in general, they are from fifteen to twenty inches in diameter. There are really no traces of uniformity or design discovered throughout the whole combination, except in the form of the joint, which is invariably by an articulation of the convex into the concave
<PB N="441" REF="4490"/>
of the piece next above or below it; nor are there any traces of a finishing in any part, either in height, length, or breadth of this curious cause∣way. If there is here and there a smooth top to any of the columns above water, there are others just by, of equal height, that are more or less convex or concave, which shew them to have been joined to pieces that have been washed, or by other means taken off. And undoubtedly those parts that are always above water have, from time to time, been made as even as might be; and the remaining surfaces of the joints must na∣turally have been worn smoother by the constant friction of weather and walking, than where the sea, at every tide, is beating upon it and conti∣nually removing some of the upper stones and ex∣posing fresh joints. And, farther, as these co∣lumns preserve their diameters, from top to bottom, in all the exterior ones, which have two or three sides exposed to view, the same may, with reason, be inferred of the interior columns, whose tops only are visible. Yet what is very extraordinary, and equally curious in this phaenomenon is, that notwithstanding the universal dissimilitude of the columns, both as to their figure and diameter, and though perfectly distinct from top to bottom, yet is the whole arrangement so closely combined at all points, that hardly a knife can be introduced between them either on the sides or angles. And it is really a most curious piece of entertainment to examine the close contexture and nice insertion of such an infinite variety of angular figures as are exhibited on the surface of this grand parade. From the infinite dissimilarity of the figure of these columns, this will appear a most surprizing cir∣cumstance to the curious spectator, and would in∣cline him to believe it a work of human art, were it not, on the other hand, inconceivable that the
<PB N="442" REF="4500"/>
wit or invention of man should construct and com∣bine such an infinite number of columns, which should have a general apparent likeness, and yet be so universaily dissimilar in their figure as that, from the minutest examination, not two in ten or twenty thousand should be found, whose angles and sides are equal among themselves, or of the one column to those of the other. That it is the work of nature there can be no doubt to an atten∣tive spectator, who carefully surveys the general form and situation, with the infinitely various figu∣ration of the several parts of this causeway. There are no traces of regularity or design in the out-lines of this curious phaenomenon; which, including the broken and detached pieces of the same kind of workmanship, are extremely scattered and con∣fused, and, whatever they might originally, do not, at present, appear to have any connection with the grand or principal causeway, as to any supposable design or use in its first construction, and as little design can be inferred from the figure or situation of the several constituent parts. The whole exhibition is, indeed, extremely con∣fused, disuniform, and destitute of every appear∣ance of use or design in its original construction. But what, beyond dispute, determines its original to have been from nature is, that the very cliffs, at a great distance from the causeway, especially in the bay to the eastward, exhibit, at many places, the same kind of columns, figured and jointed in all respects like those of the grand cause∣way; some of them are seen near to the top of the cliff, which in general, in these bays to the east and west of the causeway, is near three hun∣dred feet in height; others again are seen about midway, and at different elevations from the strand. A very considerable exposure of them is
<PB N="443" REF="4510"/>
seen in the very bottom of the bay to the eastward, near a hundred rods from the causeway, where the earth has evidently fallen away from them upon the strand, and exhibits a most curious arrange∣ment of many of these pentagonal columns, in a perpendicular position, supporting, in appearance, a cliff of different strata of earth, clay, rock, &amp;c. to the height of one hundred and fifty feet or more, above. Some of these columns are between thirty and forty feet high, from the top of the sloping bank below them; and, being longest in the mid∣dle of the arrangement, shortening on either hand in view, they have obtained the appellation of organs, from a rude likeness, indeed, in this par∣ticular to the exterior or frontal tubes of that in∣strument; and as there are very few broken pieces on the strand near it, it is probable that the out∣side range of columns that now appears, is really the original exterior line, to the seaward, of this collection. But how far they extend internally into the bowels of the encumbent cliff, may be worthy the examination of any curious gentleman in the neighbourhood, by running an arch or cavern on one or both sides, to trace the internal scope of this particular arrangement, which may be about thirty feet wide, and is composed of the loftiest co∣lumns of any that are found in, or about, the causeway. The very substance, indeed, of that part of the cliff which projects to a point, between the two bays on the east and west of the causeway, seems composed of this kind of materials; for be∣sides the many pieces that are seen on the sides of the cliff that circulate to the bottom of the bays, particularly the eastern side, there is, at the very point of the cliff, and just above the narrow and highest part of the causeway, a long collection of them seen, whose heads or tops just appearing without the sloping bank, plainly shew them to
<PB N="444" REF="4520"/>
be in an oblique position, and about halfway be∣tween the perpendicular and horizontal. The heads of these, likewise, are of mixt surfaces, convex and concave, and the columns evidently appear to have been removed from their original upright, to their present inclining or oblique po∣sition, by the sinking or falling of the cliff; nor do I make any doubt, that the whole causeway, that runs out from thence to the sea was, ori∣ginally, concealed in the very bowels of a super∣encumbent cliff, that, by degrees, has fallen off it; and the looser earth being washed away, has left this more fixed and most curious columnal combination exposed to view, and which will pro∣bably remain for ages a monument of the superior and exquisite workmanship of nature. The circumstance of its being the only phaenome∣non of the kind that has yet been discovered, is no disproof of its natural origin; or it is an equal presumption against its being the work of human art. For neither art nor nature, perhaps, in any part of the known world, has exhibited a construction like it. That there is nothing of the same kind to be met with, makes this, in∣deed, the more extraordinary, and the more just∣ly deserving the notice and admiration of the cu∣rious; but nothing can be inferred from thence alone as to its origin. The romantic supposition of its having been a causeway from Ireland to Scot∣land is ridiculous and absurd at first view. The nearest coast of Scotland to this place is at least thirty miles: if any use or design of this kind can be imagined ever to have taken place, it must have been to some island not far from the shore, which the sea has swallowed up. But the gene∣ral form and construction of the several parts is at the utmost distance from favouring such a suppo∣sition. Nor is the ridiculous opinion that is met
<PB N="445" REF="4530"/>
with in some of the old natural histories of this kingdom less absurd, on a comparison that is made of this to Stonehenge on Salisbury-plain, that this, as well as that, may have been originally a Druid temple, or some antient place of worship; for there is no more likeness in the comparison than would be found between two of the most dissimilar productions of art or nature. Into such ridiculous fancies will men suffer themselves to be led who have never seen the originals of which they pretend to give a description; but implicity write from the authority of others, equally with themselves, unacquainted with them. The truth is, that from the most exact survey, and the mi∣nutest examination, of this most singular and cu∣rious phaenomenon, the total absence of every ap∣pearance of design or use that can be discovered, it may justly be looked upon as a lusus naturae: if there are any exhibitions in nature that may be called such, this is super-eminently one of them. With respect to the manner of its original produc∣tion, it should seem to be a rocky concressence or vegetation, of a similar natural process with many sparry or lapidar productions that are found in some parts both of England and Ireland. This, however, I speak with diffidence, and submit to the judgment of more curious naturalists. That stones of many, and perhaps of all, kinds do really grow from a lesser to a larger size, is, at this time, a well known truth. Whether these have en∣creased in their magnitude since the memory of man, there have been no observations made by any gentleman in the country: though such easily might have been made, with respect to any particular pillar or column, a little de∣tached from the rest. But, indeed, whether they grew to this surprizing and most singular form and connection with each other, by any na∣tural
<PB N="446" REF="4540"/>
vegetative process, or were originally brought into it at once by the omnipotent fiat of nature, is, at this time, and probably ever will be, an abso∣lutely indiscoverable secret. The singularity, however, as well as figure of the phaenomenon, is very extraordinary, that there should never, in any part of the world, be any production of a simi∣lar kind to this yet discovered, not even in Ireland itself, is a circumstance, indeed, amazing, and that very justly places this at the head of natural curiosities.</P>

<HEAD>TYRONE, or TIR-OEN.</HEAD>
<P>This county on the south and south-west has a part of Fermanagh, Monaghan, and Armagh; on the north Londonderry; on the east Lough-Eaugh, which separates it from a part of Antrim; and on the west the river Liffer, by which it is parted from Donnegal and part of Fermanagh. Its length where longest is about sixty miles, and its breadth thirty-five; but it is much indented by the neighbouring counties. The number of its acres is estimated at three hundred and eighty-nine thousand one hundred and seventy-five. The air of this county is wholesome; but the soil of a great part of it, being mountainous, is very indifferent. Many of the vallies, however, and low grounds, are fruitful both in corn and pasture. It contains four baronies; and besides the two knights for the shire, sends two members to parliament for each of the following towns, viz.
<PB N="447" REF="4550"/>
Clogher, Augher, Strabane, and Dungannon, of which in order.</P>
<P>Clogher, standing in the Lower Tyrone, is a see of a bishop, founded by St. Patrick, and well endowed, but otherwise mean and inconsiderable.</P>
<P>Augher is a place as despicable as Clogher.</P>
<P>Strabane, a large thriving corporation, stands on the river Foyle, has a castle, and gives title of viscount and baron to the earl of Abercorn, to whom it belongs.</P>
<P>Dungannon, reckoned the capital of the coun∣ty, standing on a hill, is a place of some strength, and gives the title of baron to lord-viscount Vane.</P>
<P>Mountjoy is a small but strong town in this county on Lough-Neagh, and gives title of viscount to the earl of Blessington, a branch of the family of Stewart, whose ancestor, the first viscount, was a lieutenant-general in the reign of queen Anne.</P>
<P>Lough-Neagh, on which this town stands, is the largest lake in Ireland, overspreading near one hundred thousand acres of land; but it is not di∣versified and adorned with islands and woods like Lough-Earne. Being the receptacle of several rivers and brooks, and having but a narrow out-let into the sea thro' the Lower Bann, it generally rises in the winter season eight or ten feet above its level, sometimes overflowing the low grounds on its coast. The waters of the lake are said to have a petrifying virtue, and to cure evils, ulcers, and running sores. A variety of beautiful pebbles, chrystals, cornelians, mochoas, agates, and other precious stones have, it is said, been found upon its banks.</P>
<P>Brinburgh and Steward's-town are both small places.</P>
<P>Omagh, or Drammoragh, stands on Roe-water. Tho' small, it is the county town. Roe-water

<P>In the lower barony of Dungannon, several trumpets of an uncommon size have been disco∣vered; they are supposed to have been used by the pagan priests at their funeral rites, in consort with those who were wont formerly to make a hi∣deous howling noise upon these occasions. This county is famous for its antient lords, or rather ty∣rants. It now gives title of earl to a family surnamed Beresford. Tyrone or Tir-Oen is said to signify the land of Eugenius, as Tir-Connel does that of Connal or Cornelius.</P>

<HEAD>FERMANAGH.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded by Cavan on the south; Tir-Oen on the north and north-east; Donnegal on the north-west; Leitrim on the south-west; and Monaghan on the east. It is thirty-eight miles long, twenty four broad, contains eight baronies, and about two hundred and twenty-four thousand eight hundred and seven acres. A great part of it is taken up with bogs, and that prodigi∣ous lake called Lough-Earne, which is near twenty miles in length, and in some places fourteen in breadth, being diversified with upwards of three hundred islands, most of them well wooded, inhabited, and covered with cattle. It abounds also with a great variety of fish, such as huge pike, large bream, roach, eels, trout, and salmon. The water of the lake in some places is said to have a particular softness and sliminess, that bleaches linen much sooner than can be done by other wa∣ter. This lake is divided into the upper and lower, betwixt which it contracts itself for five or six miles to the breadth of an ordinary river. In the parish of Kilasher are marble rocks fifty OF sixty
<PB N="449" REF="4570"/>
feet in height. This county sends only four members to parliament, viz. two for the shire and two for Inniskillin, and gives the title of viscount to earl Verney.</P>
<P>Inniskillin, the capital of the county, is situ∣ated on an island in the narrow part of the lake: being an important pass, it is well fortified and gar∣risoned. In 1689 this town was bravely defended by the protestants against king James and his po∣pish army. Over-against Inniskillin, on the bank of the lake, is Lisgool-castle. <Q>“The town of Inniskillin, says the ingenious author of Hiber∣nia Curiosa, is one of the most considerable inland towns of the kingdom; and, if a prospect is taken of it in the summer season, its situation will ap∣pear most delightful. At either end of it is a bridge, by which alone it can be entered. The lake is almost surrounded by mountains or lofty eminences, from many of which a general prospect of the lake and its numerous isles is extremely fine: the prospect likewise from the town, or the island on which it stands, is inconceivably rural and beautiful. The shade of the woods, consist∣ing of trees and shrubs of various kinds, some of them ever-greens, the coolness of the water, the diversion of fishing, and the infinite variety of figures delineated by the islands, make this lake a perfect paradise in the summer. It is a kind of rural Venice, where the woods appear to be the habitations, and the broken and winding surface of the lake, the streets, leading from one part to another.”</Q> The town is famous for producing the brave and gallant regiment of its name in the war between king William and James II. in Ireland.</P>
<P>Tearmon, Tully-Castle, Baleek, Newton-Butler, Lisnaskea, Clabby, and Maguire's-bridge, are all small places. From Baleek, on the river Erne to the sea, is one continued series of cascades. New∣ton-Butler

<HEAD>CAVAN.</HEAD>
<P>This county has Longford and West Meath on the south; Leitrim on the west; Fermanagh on the north; and part of Monaghan, Meath, and Louth on the east. Its length is forty-seven miles, and its breadth, where broadest, twenty-five. It contains seven baronies and two hundred and seventy-four thousand eight hundred acres, sends six members to parliament, viz. two for the county, and two each for the boroughs of Cavan and Belturbet; and gives the title of earl to the family of Lambert. The air is not unhealthy, tho' there is much boggy ground in some places. The greater part however is well cultivated and inhabited.</P>
<P>Cavan is the county-town. In 1690 a great part of it was burnt down, with all the forage of the rebels; and colonel Worseley, at the head of the Inniskillin men and one thousand regulars, de∣feated four thousand, under the duke of Berwick.</P>
<P>Belturbet stands near the upper end of Lough-Erne. It is a small town, but has a harbour for boats.</P>

<P>This county has Tyrone on the north; Cavan on the south; Fermanagh on the west; Armagh on the east; and Louth, with a part of East Meath, on the south-east. It extends in length thirty-two
<PB N="451" REF="4590"/>
miles, in breadth thirty, and contains one hun∣dred and seventy thousand acres. It is very mountainous, woody, and marshy, divided into five baronies, and sends four members to parlia∣ment, two for the county and two for Monaghan.</P>
<P>Monaghan, though small, is the capital and county-town; giving name to the whole county, and to a barony in the honourable family of Bla∣ney.</P>
<P>Glaslough, Clounish, Carrickmacross, and Castle∣shane, are small places.</P>
<P>The M'Mahons, a name in Irish signifying the sons of a bear, descended from Walter Fitz-Urse, who was concerned in the murder of Becket, arch∣bishop of Canterbury, for a long time were the petty sovereigns or tyrants of this county.

<DIV3>
<HEAD>ARMAGH.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded by Louth on the south; Lough-Neagh on the north; Tyrone and Monag∣han on the west; and Down, in part, on the east, from which it is separated by the river Newry. It is in length thirty-two miles, in breadth seven∣teen, and is divided into five baronies, containing about one hundred and seventy thousand six hun∣dred and twenty acres. Both the air and soil are good, especially the latter, which is said to be the richest in Ireland; only there is a certain tract in it called the Fewes, that is, hilly and barren. The members it sends to parliament are six, viz.
<PB N="452" REF="4600"/>
two for the city of Armagh, two for the county, and two for the borough of Charlemont.</P>
<P>Armagh, standing near the river Kalin, gives name to the county, and is the see of the primate of all Ireland. It is said to have been founded by St. Patrick in the fifth century; and in 1142, it was constituted an archbishopric, together with Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam, by cardinal Papyreo, with the consent of the king, dukes, bishops, abbots, and states of Ireland. This Papyreo was sent into Ireland by pope Eugenius, to reform the abuses that had crept into the church-discipline of that country. Here was antiently a famous mo∣nastery built by St. Columba, or Columbanus, about the year 610. This town was first sub∣jected to the English by John de Courcy; but af∣terwards entirely destroyed by Tir Cen, or O Neal, in queen Elizabeth's time. However, it was after∣wards recovered, rebuilt, and garrisoned by the English.</P>
<P>Charlemont took its name from a fort or mount built by Charles Blount, lord Mountjoy, and from him called Charlemont. It stands on the river Blackwater, near the borders of Tyrone, and gives the title of earl and viscount to the family of Caul∣field.</P>
<P>Portadown, Portendown, or Portnadown, is a small place upon the Bann, over which it has a bridge.</P>
<P>Lurgan is one of the prettiest market-towns of the north of Ireland. It stands near Lough-Neagh, and much resembles one of our spacious thoroughfare - towns in the high roads near the capital. From the similarity of its ge∣neral figure, of the language, manners, and dis∣positions of its inhabitants to those of the Eng∣lish, it hath for many years acquired the name of Little England. Its situation is extremely
<PB N="453" REF="4610"/>
pleasant on a gentle eminence, in a sertile and po∣pulous country, about two miles from and com∣manding a prospect of Lough-Neagh, one of the largest lakes in the kingdom. In the neighbouring villages all hands are employed in the linen manufac∣ture. The inhabitants are genteel, sensible, and friendly, have some good inns, and a polite as∣sembly.</P>

<HEAD>DOWN.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Down is bounded on the north by the county of Antrim; on the west by the county of Armagh; and on the east and south by St. George's channel. It is fruitful and populous, enjoying a good air. The length of the county is about forty∣four English miles, and the breadth upwards of thirty. It is divided into seven baronies, contain∣ing seventy-two parishes, and about five hundred and fifty-eight thousand two hundred and eighty∣nine thousand English acres. Besides the two members for the county, two are sent to parlia∣ment for each of the following towns, viz. Down-Patrick, Newry, Newton, Killeagh, Bangor, and Hillsborough.</P>
<P>Down-Patrick is a very antient-town and a bi∣shop's see, erected about the end of the fifth cen∣tury by St. Patrick, and now united to Connor. In the antient cathedral, of which the ruins are still visible near the town, it is pretended that St. Patrick, St. Bridget, and St. Columb were buried. It is also said that Magnus, king of Norway, was interred near it, having been slain by the Irish, when he landed to take a view of the country, before
<PB N="454" REF="4620"/>
he disembarked his forces. Besides the cathedral, there were four religious houses here antiently, and the prior had a seat in parliament. The town stands on the lake of Strangford, which abounds with sal∣mon, mullet, and other fish, is the resort of swans and various kinds of water-fowl, and contains many pleasant islands. Here are several handsome public buildings, as the church, the sessions-house, two alms-houses, two schools, a market-house, and barracks for a troop of horse. Not far from the town are the ruins of a monastery founded by St. Patrick for ca∣nons regular, about the middle of the fifth century; and in an isle, opposite the cathedral, are the ruins of the Inch-abbey, i. e. the abbey in the island, founded by John de Courcy about the year 1180, and supplied with Cistercian monks from Furness in Lancashire. About a mile from the town is St. Patrick's well, to which great numbers of su∣perstitious people flock at certain times; some to perform penance, others in hopes of relief in va∣rious disorders, by drinking or washing in the wa∣ter, which is said to have been blessed by St. Pa∣trick. The linen manufacture flourishes about this town, which gives title of viscount to the family of Dawney.</P>
<P>Newry stands near a river of the same name, over which it has two bridges, and was founded in the reign of queen Elizabeth by Nicholas Bag∣nal, marshal of Ireland. But long before that period, there was an abbey of Cistercian monks here. Of its antient castle there are still some re∣mains. The town was twice destroyed by the Irish rebels, first in 1641, and again in 1689; but hath so well recovered itself since, as to be counted at present the largest and most trading town of the county, for which happy change it is principally indebted to the linen manufacture. The canal for inland navigation, which terminates
<PB N="455" REF="4630"/>
in the river here, is another great advantage to it. The town is a great thoroughfare, tho' surrounded with hills and mountains, except to the north, where the canal runs. A garrison is constantly kept in this place.</P>
<P>Newton stands at the north end of the lake of Strangford. It had antiently a convent of Domi∣nican friars; but is remarkable at present for its fine diaper and quarries of free-stone.</P>
<P>Killeleagh is situated also upon the lake of Strangford, of which it has an agreeable prospect. It had the honour to give birth to that great natu∣ralist and physician Sir Hans Sloane. There is a handsome church, a castle, barracks for a troop of dragoons, a bridge over a little river that runs by the town, and a safe commodious harbour, formed by a little bay at the lower end of it. The linen manufacture also flourishes in this borough. It is governed by a provost, who, with twelve burgesses, chuse the members of parliament.</P>
<P>Bangor contains between two and three hun∣dred houses, and has a considerable manufacture for linen yarn. It stands on Carrickfergus-bay, and is governed by a provost and twelve burgesses, who chuse the members of parliament. Here are still seen the ruins of a very antient abbey. Duke Schomberg landed with the forces under his com∣mand at this town in 1689. The first church of stonein the province of Ulster is said to have been erected here.</P>
<P>Hillsborough gives the title of earl and viscount to the family of Hill, from whom it derives its name. It is situated on a dry gravelly soil, and governed by a sovereign, as the chief magistrate is called, and twelve burgesses, who elect the repre∣sentatives in parliament.</P>
<P>The other places worth mentioning, besides the parliamentary boroughs, are</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="4640"/>
Ross-Trevor, which though but a small place, on the north-side of Carlingford-haven, yet has a good key, within a few yards of which ships may ride at anchor. It has also a salt-house, and a pottery of the fine potters-clay found near Car∣rickfergus, of which large quantities are exported.</P>
<P>Briansford, or Tullimore, gives title of baron to the earl of Charleville. Here are two deer∣parks finely wooded and watered, belonging to the earl of Clanbrassil, where the goat-whey drinkers, in the spring and summer, find both health and amusement.</P>
<P>Rathfryland, or Rathon-Island, is built on a hill, and shews the ruins of a castle, antiently the mansion-house of Macginnis, lord Eveagh; but the town now belongs to—Magil, esquire, is a great thoroughfare between Newry and Down-Patrick, and one of the greatest markets for linen in the county.</P>
<P>Dundrum, where are the remains of a strong castle that belonged formerly to the above-men∣tioned Macginnis. The bay, which takes its name from this place, is spacious, and abounds in fish, particularly trout and flat fish; but it is dangerous for shipping.</P>
<P>Killogh, or Port St. Anne, where are barracks for two troops of dragoons, a protestant working-school, salt-works, and a commodious key and bason for ships of good burden. Its trade is considerable, especially in exporting barley. The point or head near this town, called by Ptolemy, Issanium, and now St. John's Foreland, is the most eastern part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Ardglass, before the reign of queen Eliza∣beth, was the most noted place for trade in Ulster, and is said also to have been formerly a parliamen∣tary borough; but the privilege of sending mem∣bers to parliament is lost, and Killogh hath got all its trade. The greatest part of the town, with a good
<PB N="457" REF="4650"/>
estate in the neighbourhood, belongs to the duke of Leinster. The right honourable lord-viscount Barrington takes the title of baron from hence.</P>
<P>Strangford is a small but antient town, situ∣ated on the river or lake of Strangford, tho' it is in reality an arm of the sea. This town gives title of viscount to the family of Smyth; and takes its name from the rapidity of the tides, which is so great here, both at flood and ebb, that it carries boats at the rate of six knots or miles in an hour. The lake, or arm of the sea, is about seven∣teen miles long, and four broad at a medium, and abounds with variety of fish, as bass, mullet, whiting, large sea-trouts, oysters, lobsters, shrimps, &amp;c. There is a rock in the middle of the mouth or entrance of the lake dangerous to such as are unacquainted with it, even in calm weather, on account of the rapidity of the current; but there is a broad pas∣sage and deep water on either side. The town is situated on the south-west side, about a league from the bar or entrance, and belongs to the duke of Leinster.</P>
<P>The lake of Strangford contains upwards of sixty islands. On the west side of it is a group of small islands called the Scattheric islands, some of which are noted for fattening and restoring distem∣pered horses; many of them are stocked with rab∣bits, while others have a great resort of swans to them, and of various kinds of fowl, such as wild geese, great flights of barnacles, sweet and well flavoured ducks, gold-heads, wigeon, teal, and four or five sorts of divers. A great deal of sea-weed is burnt into kelp on the islands, and a flat stoney coast surrounding the lake, by which a num∣ber of hands are employed.</P>
<P>Portaferry is a town of some trade in the barony of Ards, opposite to Strangford, between which the communication is kept up by a ferry-boat.</P>
<P><PB N="458" REF="4660"/>
Donaghadee is the station for the packets from Port-Patrick in Scotland, from which it is only about seven or eight leagues distant.</P>
<P>Groomsport, or Graham's-port, which, if we mistake not, belongs to the earl of Farnham of the name of Maxwell, hath a harbour for small vessels.</P>
<P>Tullynkhill, which lies upon the shore, and has a quarry of liver-coloured marble. At Ard∣millan, near it, is a chalybeate spa.</P>
<P>Saintfield, where are barracks for a troop of horse, and a flourishing linen manufacture, for both of which it is indebted to the family of Price, who have their seat here, and to whom it belongs.</P>
<P>Ballynahinch, or Maghedrol, is a great tho∣roughfare. Here, and the neighbouring country, the linen manufacture is carried on very success∣fully. Tho' the soil about the town is but coarse, yet it produces good oats, flax, and potatoes. As the papists are numerous in this part of the country, the society for promoting English pro∣testant working-schools have settled one in this place, for the education of poor popish children in the protestant religion.</P>
<P>Dromore is a market-town and bishopric, found∣ed by St. Coleman in the sixth century; but there are no revenues for the maintenance of a choir. Here is the diocese-school, and an Eng∣lish protestant-school, where poor children are in∣structed in the protestant religion, set to work, and some of them cloathed. The bishop has an estate near the town, and a tolerable cathedral in it. At the east-end of it is a Danish mount or fortification, very large, defended with broad ramparts, trenches, battlements, and parapets. The linen manfacture flourishes in this place, which stands on one side of the river Logan.</P>
<P>Moyrah is a thriving village, belonging to and giving the title of earl to the family of Rawdon,
<PB N="459" REF="4670"/>
who have built a handsome church, and an Eng∣lish protestant school for twenty-four poor children. In the neighbourhood are quarries of white lime-stone.</P>
<P>Maralin, alias Magheralin, where the bishops of Dromore have a small demesne and house. Here is a long bridge over the river Logan, and the water of the springs is said to be exceeding good for bleaching cloth. About this place the linen manufacture thrives exceedingly, every farmer having some share in it. Marle-pits have been opened here, and many other parts of the county.</P>
<P>Waring's-town is a village belonging to—Waring, esquire, in which also the linen manu∣facture is carried on with success. Here is another Danish mount, which, when opened in 1681, was found a sepulchre.</P>
<P>Banbridge, about which are many bleach-yards, the water of the river Bann, on which the village stands, and from which and the bridge over it, it takes its name, being accounted very proper for that purpose. Here are held the greatest fairs in the kingdom for linen-cloth.</P>
<P>Loughbrickland has its name from a lough in the neighbourhood. The turnpike road from Dublin to Belfast and Antrim passes by it. In 1690 the forces rendezvoused and encamped here under king William. The place also from which the earls of Clanbrassel take their title lies in this county.</P>
<P>Killileigh is a small place upon the lake of Strangford.</P>
<P>This county, tho' in general hilly and hoggy, yet by the industry of the inhabitants in cul∣tivating and draining it, produces good crops of corn, especially oats; and, where marle is found, barley. It is pretty populous, and by their dili∣gent application to the linen manufacture, daily increases in wealth and inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="4680"/>
The mountains of Maurne are reckoned among the highest in the kingdom. That of Slieve-Do∣nagh in particular, is said to be half a mile per∣pendicular in height. These mountains are com∣mons to the whole county, and afford pasture to great numbers of cattle, with quarries of mill-stone, and a great variety of plants, shrubs, and me∣dicinal herbs, on which, as the goats principally feed, their milk and whey is thereby rendered so nourishing and restorative, that numbers of con∣sumptive, valetudinary people come hither by the advice of their physicians to drink it.</P>
<P>In the river Bann is a pearl fishery, which for∣merly turned to some account; but at present to very little, few of the muscles that contain the pearls being now found, and those only in smooth deep water. These muscles are in shape and co∣lour like the sea-muscles, but of a larger size. The pearl is found at the smaller end of the shell, be∣tween the two films that line it, at the extremity of the gut, and without the body of the fish. In this county is a society incorporated by James II. by the stile and title of the governor and freemen of the corporation of horse-breeders, in the coun∣ty of Down. The design of this society being to promote and improve the breed of horses, many of the nobility and gentry, especially of this county, have been members of it, and even some of the chief governors. The gold medal worn by the governor and freemen has on one side a mare, with a foal sucking her, and this motto, En equis patrum virtus. On the reverse are two running horses on full stretch, with this motto, Metam avidè petunt.</P>
<P>In the year 1733, it appeared that there were fourteen thousand and sixty protestant families, and five thousand two hundred and ten popish in this county.</P>

<HEAD>The PROVINCE of LEINSTER or LEMPSTER.</HEAD>
<P>This province, called in Latin, Lagenia, is bound∣ed by Ulster on the north; by Connaught and Munster on the west and south-west; and by the sea on the south and east. The Shannon separates it from Connaught, and the Sure from a part of Munster. Its length from north to south amounts to about one hundred and twelve miles, its breadth from east to west seventy, and its circumference, including the windings and turnings, to three hun∣dred and sixty miles. It contains twelve counties, viz. Louth, East - Meath, West - Meath, Long∣ford, Dublin, Kildare, King's-county, Queen's-county, Wicklow, Catherlogh, Kilkenny, and Wexford, ninety baronies, one archbishopric, three bishoprics, nine hundred and twenty-six parishes, forty-seven parliamentary boroughs, and sixty - three market - towns and places of trade. Leinster in general is very well cultivated, enjoys a good air and soil, and abounds in corn, cattle, fish, and fowl. Its principal rivers are the Boyne, Barrow, Liffy, Nuer, Slane, or Urrin, and the May, of which the first is famous for the victory obtained on its banks by king William over king James, and gives title of viscount to a family of the name of Hamilton. The bog of Allen, the largest in the kingdom, extends almost across the whole province from east to west, the turf of which is universally esteemed the best in Ireland. This province, formerly governed by petty kings of its own, is now the most populous in the kingdom, containing the capital and seat of govern∣ment. The inhabitants are also the most polite, and, in general, as zealous protestants as any in the-British dominions. Leinster gives the title of duke to the family of Fitzgerald, formerly earls of
<PB N="462" REF="4700"/>
Kildare. The abovementioned counties we shall describe in order.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>This county called in antient books Luna and Luda, and in Irish Iriel, is bounded on the north by Armagh and Carlingford-bay; on the south-east it is parted from Meath by the Boyne; on the east it has St. George's-channel; and on the west Mo∣naghan and East-Meath. It is the smallest county of the kingdom, being only twenty-five miles in length, and thirteen where broadest, contain∣ing about one hundred and eleven thousand one hundred and eighty acres, four baronies, besides the town and liberties of Drogheda, which make a distinct county. The air is pleasant and healthful, and the soil is fruitful in corn and grass. It gives the title of earl to a family of the name of Ber∣mingham, and sends ten members to parliament, viz. two for the county, and two for each of these four towns, Atherdee, Carlingford, Dundalk, and Dunleer.</P>
<P>Athirdee stands upon a small river that falls into Dundalk-bay, seven miles from Drogheda, where it has a harbour for boats, but is otherwise inconsi∣derable.</P>
<P>Carlingford stands forty-five miles from Dublin, on the south side of a large bay of its own name, where there is room for the whole navy of Eng∣land, it being two miles broad where narrowest, and having from ten to twenty fathom water in most places: even on the bar there is water enough for any ships not drawing above twenty-two feet. The town is neat but not large, and there are barracks in it for a company of foot. Several of its ships are employed in the fishery on the coast, and others in bringing coals from Whitehaven. There are several considerable merchants here, and
<PB N="463" REF="4710"/>
ship-building employs a great part of the inhabi∣tants. This town gives the title of viscount to the earl of Tyrconnel.</P>
<P>Dundalk is the shire town, and has a good mar∣ket, but an indifferent harbour. It is very strong both by nature and art. In 1649 the re∣bels quitted it after Oliver Cromwell had stormed Drogheda; and in 1689, it was abandoned by the popish garrison, at the approach of duke Schomberg. Near this town, Edward Bruce, the brother of Robert king of Scots, was cut off, with eight thousand two hundred of his men.</P>
<P>Drogheda stands near the mouth of the Boyne, on a bay of its own name, twenty miles from Dub∣lin, and is the chief town of the county. The harbour here is good, tho' the entrance is some∣what difficult; and there is a pretty brisk trade, especially to the north of England, for which it is very conveniently situated. Among other com∣modities, they bring from England a great quan∣tity of coals, not only for the use of the town, but of the country around, conveying them to a great distance by means of the Boyne, which divides the town into two parts, and has a bridge over it. Several privileges were granted to this place by Edward II. in particular that of a mint; and in 1365 an academy was erected here, with as ample privileges as the university of Oxford; but for want of proper support, it came to nothing. Drogheda made a gallant defence in 1641 under lord Moor and Sir Henry Tichburn; but was at last taken by the duke of Ormond and lord Inchikin. When Cromwell took it by storm in 1649, he put the whole garrison, consisting of four thousand men, to the sword. King James's garrison surrendered it to king William immediately after the battle at the Boyne. From this town the family of Moor derive the title of earl.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="4720"/>
Dunleer is a small place between Ardee and Drogheda.</P>
<P>Athenry, supposed by Cambden to be the Rigia, or Regia, of Ptolemy, gives the title of baron to the earl of Louth; and Douth that of viscount to the honourable family of Netterville. They are both small places.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EAST-MEATH.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded with the county of Dublin and the ocean on the east; Meath on the west; Kildare on the south-west; and those of Cavan and Louth on the north and north-east. It is thirty-two miles long and twenty-five broad, contains eighteen baronies, and sends to parlia∣ment, besides the two knights of the shire, twelve members for the boroughs of Trim, Aboy, Navan, Kells, Duleek, and Ratoath. This county abounds in corn, pasture, and herds of cattle, the air and soil being good, and the inhabitants numerous. Several noble families have also titles of honour within it, as the viscounts Boyne, Cholmondeley of Kells, and Grimston, and the barons Bellew, or de Bella Aqua of Duleek, and Aylmer of Bal∣rath. Horns, prodigiously large, supposed to be those of the moose-deer, have been found not only in this county, but several other parts of Ireland. Antiently there were petty kings of Meath.</P>
<P>Trim, the county town, is situated on the Boyne, and has barracks for a troop of horse.</P>
<P>Navan stands also on the Boyne, and is the or∣dinary residence of the bishop of Meath, who is said to have no cathedral church, dean, or chap∣ter, but acts in all matters with the assent of the clergy of Meath. Here are also barracks for a troop of horse.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="4730"/>
Kells, Duleek, Ratoath, Slane, Athboy, and Ardbraccan, are small places. Duleek lies on the river Nanny, and the bishop of Meath has a seat at Ardbraccan.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>WEST-MEATH.</HEAD>
<P>This county has its name from its situation in respect of the former, by which it is bounded on the east; the Shannon parts it from Roscommon on the west; the King's county lies on the south of it; and Longford on the north. It is betwixt thirty and forty miles in length, and twenty in breadth, containing many rivers, lakes, and bogs. The land, where it is free from these, is abundantly fertile, and well inhabited. The baronies in this county are thirteen, and the members sent to par∣liament ten, viz. two for the shire, and two each for the boroughs of Mullingar, Athlone, Fore, and Kilbeggan.</P>
<P>Mullingar is a pretty good market-town, about the middle of the county. By act of parliament it is the county-town, and has barracks for a troop of horse.</P>
<P>Athlone, a town of considerable note and strength, having a castle and garrison, stands on both sides of the Shannon, over which it has a bridge, and is reckoned the key of Connaught, from its situation on the confines of that province, on which account chiefly the town has a garrison. That on the west side the river is called the Irish, and the other the English town. It was besieged by king William's forces in 1690, without success; but next year it was taken, and all who made resistance put to the sword. It gives title of earl to a descen∣dant of general Ginkle, created by king William earl of Athlone.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="4740"/>
Fore, Killbeggan, and Kinnegad, are inconsi∣derable places. Delvin, in this county, gives the title of baron, and the county itself that of earl, to the family of Nugent, as Meath does to one of the name of Brabazon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LONGFORD.</HEAD>
<P>This is a fruitful pleasant county, bounded on the north by Cavan; on the east and south by West-Meath; on the north-west by Leitrim; and on the west by Roscommon, from which it is part∣ed by the Shannon. It is twenty-seven miles long and sixteen broad, in general fertile and agreeable, tho' not without bogs and fens in some places. It contains six baronies, sends to parliament te members, namely, two for the county, and two each for Longford, Granard, Lanesborough, and St. John's-town.</P>
<P>Longford is the capital of the county, and, be∣sides a castle, has barracks for a troop of horse. It gives the title of baron to the family of Packen∣ham.</P>
<P>Lanesborough stands on the Shannon, over which it has a bridge. It has also barracks for a troop of horse, or company of foot, and gives title of earl to a branch of the family of Butler.</P>
<P>Granard, a small place in the north-east part of the county, gives the title of viscount to a branch of the Scotch family of Forbes.</P>
<P>St. John's-town also is a small place not far from Granard.</P>

Kildare on the west; and the Irish sea, or St. George's channel, on the east. It is about twenty-six miles in length from north to south, and fif∣teen from east to west. This county, excepting a mountainous tract in the south part of it, is very populous and fertile, abounding with all the necessaries of life, but wood, in lieu of which they burn turf and sea coal. It far exceeds any other part of the kingdom, not only in populous∣ness, culture, trade, and wealth, but politeness, elegance, ingenuity, and every species of refine∣ment and improvement. It contains six baronies, viz. Rathdown, Newcastle, Castleknoc, Cowloc, Balrodry, and Nethercross; sending to parlia∣ment two knights for the shire, four members for Dublin and its university, and two a piece for the boroughs of Swords and Newcastle.</P>
<P>The city of Dublin, the capital of the kingdom, is situated on the river Liffy, near the bottom of a beautiful bay, to which it gives name, and which is three or four miles wide at its entrance, and seven or eight deep, with hills and promontories on either hand. It is a large, populous, and, for the greater part, a well built city; not much em∣bellished, indeed, with grand or magnificent build∣ings: a few, however, there are, of which the college or university, the parliament houses, the King's, the Lying-in hospital, and Swift's for lu∣natics, with the duke of Leinster's-house, are the principal. The churches in general make but a very indifferent figure as to their architecture; and are almost entirely destitute of monumental ornaments. The two houses of parliament are infinitely superior, in point of grandeur and magnificence, to those of Westminster. The house of lords is, perhaps, as elegant a room as any in Great Britain or Ire∣land. The college-library, from the number of
<PB N="468" REF="4770"/>
volumes it contains, the magnificence and neat∣ness of the rooms, and the convenient dispo∣sition of the books and desks for the use of the students, is well worthy attention. The castle, as it is called, from one once situated there, of which, at present, there are very few remains, is the residence of the lord-lieutenant when in Ire∣land; but has very little of grandeur in its external appearance besides the large square and court∣yard which it encloses. Some of the rooms, however, are large and elegant. The whole ex∣tent of the city of Dublin is about one-third of London, including Westminster and South∣wark; and one fourth, at least, of the whole has been built within these forty years. Those parts of the town that have been added since that time are substantially built, and the streets, in general, well laid out, especially on the north-side of the river, where the most considerable addi∣tions have been made within the term above-mentioned. There are on this side many spacious and regular streets, particularly Sackville-street, in the north-east part of the town, which, with some alterations and improvements, would have been one of the finest, perhaps, in Europe. The most elegant and best finished piece of architecture in Dublin is the Lying - in hospital. The view of Dublin from the top of any of their towers is the most beautiful, perhaps, of any large city in the king's dominions, in a similar point of view, from the neatness of the blue slating with which the houses are universally covered. The bay below the city to the east, with the adjacent country, adds greatly to the beauty of the prospect. The river Liffy, which runs thro' almost the centre of the city, from west to east, and contributes much to its health, is but a small river, about one
<PB N="469" REF="4780"/>
fifth as wide as the Thames at London, conse∣quently cannot be supposed capable of bringing up to the town ships of above one hundred and fifty or two hundred tons burden. Over this river there are five bridges, of which that called Essex bridge is well built, spacious, and elegant. As a fine exchange is intended to be erected in this city, premiums have been lately offered and advertised for the three best plans. There are two elegant theatres here, in which plays are acted as in Lon∣don, besides a third, which has been shut for se∣veral years. The old house in Smock-alley, tho' not so large as the new in Crow-street, is one of the best constructed theatres, both for the audience and the actors, that can be imagined. Here are summer entertainments too, in imitation of those of London. Adjoining to the Lying - in hos∣pital, and belonging to it, is a large square piece of ground inclosed, and three sides out of four very prettily laid out in walks, plantations of shrubs, trees, &amp;c. and on the fourth stands the hospital, On the side of the green, op∣posite the hospital, the ground being much higher, is formed into a fine hanging bank, with a slope of near thirty feet, on the top of which is laid out a grand terrace-walk, commanding a fine view of the hospital. On the upper side of this terrace, and nearly encompassed by the groves and shrubberies, is built a very pretty orchestra. This garden, the most agreeable about Dublin, is much frequented in the fine summer evenings by the genteel company of the city: and though not so generally calculated for a musical entertainment as the garden of Vaux∣hall, near London, yet there are some walks in it where the music has a finer effect than in many of the other. The greatest defect of this large and po∣pulous
<PB N="470" REF="4790"/>
city is the almost total want of good inns for the accommodation of strangers and travellers. There are not above two or three that are barely tolerable. Dublin is the see of an archbishop, who has a handsome cathedral, and a chapter consisting of a dean, chanter, chancellor, trea∣surer, two archdeacons, and twenty-two preben∣daries. Here is a society, called the Dublin so∣ciety, which hath been of infinite benefit to the kingdom by distributing premiums, to a very considerable amount, yearly, for encouraging and promoting husbandry, and other useful arts and manufactures. The chief magistrate, or mayor of Dublin, as in London, bears the title of lord during his mayoralty. Every year the lord-mayor and twenty-four companies perambulate the city and its liberties. The provisions of this city are gene∣rally good, and at a reasonable price, liquors espe∣cially. The best spirits may be had at half the price they sell for in London. Their wine is chiefly claret, the common price of which is two shillings; and the best that the town affords, may be had for two shillings and six-pence the bottle. The rates of hackney coaches and chairs are fixed here, as in London, for the different distances, or set - downs, as they are called. But here are two sorts of carriages peculiar to the place. The one is called a noddy, which is nothing more than an old cast-off one horse chaise, or chair, with a kind of stool fixed upon the shafts, just before the seat, on which the driver sits just over the rump of the horse, and drives you from one part of the town to ano∣ther, at stated rates, for a set-down. Tho' it is neither a very safe nor easy vehicle, yet it is conveni∣ent for single persons, the fare being not much more than half that of a coach; and they will go to any
<PB N="471" REF="4800"/>
part of the kingdom on the terms you can agree. The other is called a chaise-marine, and is little else than a common car with one horse. They are used throughout the kingdom for the conveyance of people on parties of pleasure, genteel and ungenteel, and for the carriage of goods and merchandize of every kind, hay, straw, corn, dung, turf, &amp;c. When used for parties of pleasure, a mat is laid on the le∣vel part for the commonalty; and, for the genteeler sort, a bed is put on this. The inhabitants of Dublin pretend to speak English better than those of Lon∣don, and have even the ridiculous vanity to arro∣gate to themselves a higher degree of politeness and gentility, and a more refined taste. The number of the inhabitants of this city is computed at about three hundred thousand, and gives the title of earl to his royal highness the duke of Cum∣berland. The environs of the city are very pleasant.</P>
<P>About seven miles from it, on the Lissy, is Leislip, one of the pleasantest villages in Ireland. There are several seats of the first families in the kingdom about this village; in particular, a very beautiful one belonging to the archbishop of Ar∣magh, the gardens of which are extremely de∣lightful, lying on a declivity along the side of the river, very steep to the edge of the water, and skirted from top to bottom with trees of various kinds, where the roaring of a fall at the height of sixty or seventy feet above it has a very agreeable effect, together with several vistas in the wood ter∣minating on the fall or river. This village, in the summer season, is much resorted to by genteel company from Dublin, to drink of a mineral spring, close to the edge of the Liffy, a little be∣low the village.</P>
<P>Newcastle. This town stands pleasantly on the
<PB N="472" REF="4810"/>
top of a hill near the sea, eight miles from Dub∣lin. It commands a very fine prospect, both of the sea and country. Opposite to it begin those shelves of sand called the grounds, which run along the coast to the south.</P>
<P>Swords, a small market-town, lying on the sea, infamous in history for having been the first place of rendezvous to the rebel Irish in 1642. It gives title of viscount to lord Molesworth.</P>
<P>Lush is a market-town on the coast, twelve miles from Dublin.</P>
<P>Balruddery, Finglas, and Glasnevin, are small places.</P>
<P>At Castletown, about ten miles from Dublin, is a feat belonging to the right honourable Tho∣mas Conolly, esquire, whose lady, a sister of the duke of Richmond's, hath, by the strength of her own native elegance of taste and genius for rural design, improved a spot by nature infertile of beauty or elegance, into a seat, that, when the de∣signed improvements are compleated, will be one of the most delightful in Ireland.</P>
<P>On the coast of this county among other isles, lies the little island of St. Benedict, belonging to the archbishop of Dublin, and the isle of Lambay, supposed to be the Limnium of Ptolemy. On the north-side of the Liffy, at Chapel-Izod, is the coun∣try-palace of the lord-lieutenant, with a noble park, called Phoenix-park. Where the river Liffy runs into the sea stands Hoath, almost encom∣passed by water, which gives name to a pro∣montory, and the title of baron to the noble family of St. Lawrence. In this county also lies Fingal, a small, but very rich and fertile district, which gives the title of earl to a family of the name of Plunket. Fingal, in the Irish, signifies a na∣tion of foreigners. Bellemont gives the title of
<PB N="473" REF="4820"/>
earl to the family of Coote; Kingsland that of viscount to the family of Barnewell; Merion that of viscount to earl Fitzwilliam; Rathcoole that of viscount to the family of Tracy; and Santry that of baron to the earl of Barrymore. Kilmanham, which formerly belonged to the knights of St. John of Jerusalem, but now to the earl of Ross, is the place where the county sessions are held.</P>

<HEAD>KILDARE.</HEAD>
<P>This county has East Meath on the north; Catherlough on the south: Dublin and Wicklow on the east; and King's and Queen's counties on the west. Its length is about thirty-seven miles, and its breadth twenty - three. The soil is very rich and fertile, and the air temperate and pleasant. It contains ten baronies, and, besides the two members for the county, sends two more for each of the boroughs of Kildare, Naas, Harris∣town, and Atoy, or Athy.</P>
<P>Kildare, the capital, stands twenty-seven miles from Dublin, gives name to the county, and the title of marquis to the duke of Leinster, on whose ancestors the castle and town of Kildare, together with the stile and title of earl of Kildare, were bestowed by Edward II. This town also is the see of a bishop, who has precedence of all the Irish bishops, except that of Meath. In the neigh∣bourhood is a plain called the Currogh, large enough for a camp of ten thousand men. The bishopric of Kildare is said to have been founded by St. Conloth, with the assistance of St. Bridget.</P>
<P>Athy is situated upon the Barrow, over which is a handsome stone bridge. It is a small but neat town, with barracks for a troop of horse.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="4830"/>
Naas, though small, is the shire-town. Not far from it are two prodigious large stones, called the Long-stones; but when or for what end placed there, historians give no accounts.</P>
<P>Harristown, Maynoth, Kilrush, Castle-Dermot, Kilcullen, Rathangan, Kilcock, Monasterevin, and Carberry, are small places. The last gives the title of baron to the family of Evans.</P>
<P>The viscounts Loftus and Allen have their names and titles from places in this county. Ophally gives the title of baron to the duke of Leinster.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>KING'S-COUNTY.</HEAD>
<P>This county takes its name from king Philip of Spain, husband to queen Mary. It is bounded on the north with West Meath; on the south by part of Tipperary and Queen's-County, from which it is divided by the Barrow; and part of Tipperary and Gallway on the west, from which it is separated by the Shannon. The length of it is about forty miles, and the breadth near twenty. This county was formerly full of bogs, but it is now well drained, cut, cultivated, and inhabited. It contains eleven baronies, and sends six members to parliament, viz. two for the county, and four for Philip's-town and Banatur.</P>
<P>Philip's-town, or King's-town, the capital of the county, took its name from Philip of Spain. It had formerly a castle, and now has barracks for a company of foot, and gives title of baron to lord-viscount Molesworth.</P>
<P>Banaghir, Banahir, or Banatur, is a small town, with a bridge over the Shannon, that leads into the county of Galway. Being an important pass, it has barracks for two companies of foot.</P>
<P><PB N="475" REF="4840"/>
Geashill is a neat market-town, six miles from Philip's-town, giving the title of baron to the fa∣mily of Digby.</P>
<P>Bir stands on the borders of Tipperary, and is the largest town in the county.</P>
<P>Bally-boy is advantageously situated near the centre of the county, and said to be in a flourish∣ing condition.</P>
<P>Endenderry and Tullemore are both small towns. The latter gives the title of baron to the earl of Charleville.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>QUEEN'S-COUNTY.</HEAD>
<P>This county has its name from the popish queen Mary, in whose reign it was first made a county by the earl of Sussex, then lord-deputy. It is bounded on the south by Kilkenny and Cather∣logh; by King's-County on the north and west; part of Kildare and Catherlogh on the east; and part of Tipperary on the west. Its greatest length from north to south is thirty-five miles, and its breadth near as much; but it is unequal both ways. This county was antiently full of bogs and woods, though now pretty well inclosed, cultivated, and inhabited. The baronies contained in it are seven, and it sends eight members to parliament, viz. two for the county, and two for each of the boroughs of Port-Arlington, Mary-borough, and Ballynekil.</P>
<P>Mary-borough, or Queen's-town, had its name from the abovementioned queen Mary. It gives title of baron and viscount to lord Molyneux, has barracks for a troop of horse, and is the county town.</P>
<P>Port-Arlington is a small town on the river Bar∣row, in the northern part of the county.</P>
<P><PB N="476" REF="4850"/>
Ballynekil is a small town, but has one of the best markets in the county.</P>
<P>Montrath is a large town, giving title of earl to the family of Coote.</P>
<P>Rheban, formerly a city, is now a mean village.</P>
<P>Ossory, in this county, gives name to a bishop∣ric, and the title of earl to the family of Fitzpa∣trick.</P>
<P>In this county are also the small towns of Mount∣melick, Abbylease, Durrow, Stradbally, Bally∣roan, and Burres.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>WICKLOW.</HEAD>
<P>This county has that of Wexford on the south; that of Dublin and part of Kildare on the north; St. George's channel or the east; and Kildare and Catherlogh counties on the west. Its length, where longest, is thirty-six miles, and its greatest breadth twenty-eight. It is divided into six baro∣nies. There are some pretty high mountains in this county, in one of which there is a cop∣per-mine, wrought at the expence of some English gentlemen. The lowlands are pretty well inhabited, enclosed, and cultivated, the soil being good and the air wholesome. From the mountains in this county, one may see, in a clear day, very distinctly the mountains of Snowdown in North Wales. In the Wicklow mountains, are also some of those deep dark vallies called glyns, very beautiful and picturesque, together with some grand and astonishing water-falls. Among the former, the dark glyn and the glyn of the mountains, are particularly remarkable. "The dark glyn, says the author of the Hibernia Curio∣sa, is much visited in the summer season by the gentry from Dublin, and most of the people of fortune that come to this city. It is equal, if not
<PB N="477" REF="4860"/>
superior, to any of the kind in the kingdom, one of the deepest, and at the same time, the narrowest, and most orriguous vallies I remember to have seen. The sides of the hills which skirt it, adorned with trees to the very tops, and intermixed with rocky precipices, together with the murmuring of a little river at the bottom, that winds its way thro' this intricate valley over numberless little breaks and falls, that add greatly to the beauty of the scene, render it altogether a most pleasing summer recreation. The closeness of the lofty shading hills on the sides, at the same time that it affords a most delightful cool retreat from the heat of the sun, throws a kind of gloomy solemnity on the bottom of this deep valley; and from this cir∣cumstance it is very properly called the dark glyn. It is rather a deep chasm than a valley, extending about a mile, through a lofty range of hills. At the very bottom of the glyn is a way cut out by the side of the stream, and adapted to the gloomy retirement of the place, where the lover, the poet, or philosopher, may wander with every circumstance, every scene about him, calculated to warm his imagination, or produce the most se∣rious reflections. The glyn of the mountains in this neighbourhood is a more open and spacious valley, but immensely deep, and skirted on either hand with the most enormous astonishing moun∣tains, covered for the most part with trees from their bottoms to the very tops, presenting a prospect of the most horrible impending rocks. The bottom of the valley is just wide enough for a road and a river that runs through it. There is something inexpressible striking, beautiful, grand, and awful in this scene." These glyns are not far from Powerscourt, a most beautiful seat, fourteen miles from Dublin, belonging and giving the ti∣tle of viscount to the family of Wingfield. Near
<PB N="478" REF="4870"/>
this charming seat is one of the most beautiful wa∣ter-falls in the world, called the Fall of Powers∣court, which, from the peculiarity of its situation, its prodigious height and singular beauty, well deserves the notice of every traveller. It is pro∣duced by a small river arising from springs and rains collected on the plains or shallow vallies, on the top of an adjacent range of mountains, and falls at least three hundred feet, of which two hun∣dred are visible on the plain below. The only time to see this most beautiful and astonishing wa∣ter-fall in its highest perfection is immediately after heavy rains on the mountains above. No description can then convey an adequate idea of the beauty and grandeur of the scene, or the transport of the spectator. The trees which grow from the bottom to the top of the hill, on the sides of this prodigious water-fall, are an inexpressible addition to its charms. The whole scenery in∣deed, above and below, is the most extraordinary and entertaining of its kind that can be conceived. At lord Powerscourt's delicious seat mentioned above, is a large grove of the arbutus or straw∣berry-tree, one of the most beautiful ever-greens, perhaps, that our climate produces, having, at the same time, bloom, green, and ripe fruit on its branches; but it has not those ornaments through∣out the year, as, without sufficient foundation, has been asserted. The fruit, by the natives in the neighbourhood, is called the cane-apple; when ripe it is in shape much like the wood-strawberry, but nearly as large as the garden-strawberry, of a fine scarlet colour, and hangs in beautiful clusters among the branches: the taste, however, is insi∣pid. This county sends ten members to parlia∣ment, viz. two for the shire, and two for each of these boroughs, Wicklow, Baltinglass, Carys∣fort, and Blessington.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="4880"/>
Wicklow gives name to the county, and is its capital. This town is noted for the best ale in Ireland. It has barracks for three companies of foot, and a kind of castle and haven at the mouth of the river Leitrim; but most of its trade consists in carrying provisions in small vessels to Dublin. It gives the title of baron to lord Maynard.</P>
<P>Blessington is a small town on the Liffy, giving the title of earl to a branch of the family of Stew∣art. About two miles from it are three castles on the Liffy.</P>
<P>Baltinglass is a small town, standing on the river Urrin, and gives the title of baron to the family of Stratford.</P>
<P>Carysfort also is a small place, giving the title of baron to the family of Proby.</P>
<P>Arklow contains barracks for two companies of foot; it is a pretty town near the sea, and at the mouth of a river, called by Ptolemy, Ovaca: for∣merly it had a castle belonging to the dukes of Ormond, who, among other titles of honour, stiled themselves lords of Arklow.</P>
<P>Dunlaven, though a small town, has a good market.</P>
<P>At Windgate is a remarkable heap of stones, generally supposed to be a sepulchral monument.</P>
<P>Rathdrum, Bray, and Carnew, are all small places.</P>

<HEAD>CARLOW, CATHERLOGH, or CATHERLOUGH.</HEAD>
<P>This county has part of Kildare and Wicklow on the north; Wexford on the south; part of Wicklow and Wexford on the east; and part of Queen's county and Kilkenny on the west. It is about twenty-eight miles from north to south, about eighteen from east to west, and contains
<PB N="480" REF="4890"/>
five baronies, lying mostly between the rivers Barrow and Slane, which divide it from the coun∣ties of Kilkenny and Wexford. This county, which enjoys a fruitful soil and wholesome air, sends six members to parliament, viz. two for the shire, and two each for the boroughs of Cather∣logh and Old Leighlin.</P>
<P>Catherlogh, the county town, stands on the Barrow, and contains barracks for a troop of horse, with an antient castle. It gives the title of earl to a family of the surname of Knight.</P>
<P>Old Leighlin, Laughlen, or Laughlin, was for∣merly a bishop's see, now annexed to the bishop∣ric of Fernes. At Leighlin bridge, a mile south of Old Leighlin, on the river Barrow, was antiently a commandery of the Knights Templars. Below Leighlin bridge, before it arrives at Ross, the Bar∣row is joined by the Neor, from whence they both continue a southerly course under the name of the river of Ross, south of which, being increased by the Sure, they are all three lost in the sea at Hook-point, which lies at the mouth of the haven of Waterford.</P>
<P>Tullagh, or Tullo, stands on the river Slane, is pretty well built, and has a good market.</P>
<P>Hacket's town, Bagnal's town, and Clonegal, are all small places.</P>
