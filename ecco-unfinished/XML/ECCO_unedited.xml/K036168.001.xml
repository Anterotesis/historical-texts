<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the DELICACY of TASTE and PAS<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ION.</HEAD>
<P>SOME People are subject to a certain <HI>delicacy</HI>
of <HI>passion,</HI> which makes them extremely sensi∣ble
to all the accidents of life, and gives them
a lively joy upon every prosperous event, as well as
a piercing grief, when they meet with misfortunes
and adversity. Favours and good offices easily engage
their friendship; while the smallest injury provokes
their resentment. Any honour or mark of distinc∣tion
elevates them above measure; but they are as
sensibly touched with contempt. People of this cha∣racter
have, no doubt, much more lively enjoyments,
as well as more pungent sorrows, than men of cool
and sedate tempers: But, I believe, when every thing
is balanced, there is no one, who would not rather
chuse to be of the latter character, were he entire∣ly
master of his own disposition. Good or ill for∣tune
is very little at our own disposal: And when
a person, that has this sensibility of temper, meets
with any misfortune, his sorrow or resentment takes
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
intire possession of him, and deprives him of all re∣lish
in the common occurrences of life; of which the
right enjoyment forms the greatest part of our hap∣piness.
Great pleasures are much less frequent than
great pains; so that a sensible temper must meet
with fewer trials in the former way than in the lat∣ter.
Not to mention, than men of such lively pas∣sions
are apt to be transported beyond all bounds of
prudence and discretion, and to take false steps in
the conduct of life, which are often irretrievable.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>delicacy</HI> of <HI>taste</HI> observable in some
men, which very much resembles this <HI>delicacy</HI> of
<HI>passion,</HI> and produces the same sensibility to beauty
and deformity of every kind, as that does to pro∣sperity
and adversity, obligations and in injuries. When
you present a poem or a picture to a man possessed
of this talent, the delicacy of his feeling, makes
him be touched very sensibly with every part of it;
nor are the masterly strokes perceived with more ex∣quisite
relish and satisfaction, than the negligences
or absurdities with disgust and uneasiness. A polite
and judicious conversation affords him the highest
entertainment; rudeness or impertinence is as great
a punishment to him. In short, delicacy of taste has
the same effect as delicacy of passion: It enlarges
the sphere both of our happiness and misery, and
makes us sensible to pains as well as pleasures, which
escape the rest of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8"/>
I BELIEVE, however, there is no one, who will
not agree with me, that notwithstanding this resem∣blance,
a delicacy of taste is as much to be desired
and cultivated as a delicacy of passion is to be la∣mented,
and to be remedied, if possible. The good
or ill accidents of life are very little at our di∣sposal;
but we are pretty much masters what
books we shall read, what diversions we shall par∣take
of, and what company we shall keep. Phi∣losophers
have endeavoured to render happiness en∣tirely
independent of every thing external. That
is impossible to be <HI>attained:</HI> But every wise man
will endeavour to place his happiness on such ob∣jects
as depend most upon himself: and <HI>that</HI> is not
to be <HI>attained</HI> so much by any other means as by
this delicacy of sentiment. When a man is posses∣sed
of that talent, he is more happy by what pleases
his taste, than by what gratisies his appetites, and
receives more enjoyment from a poem or a piece
of reasoning than the most expensive luxury can
afford.</P>
<P>How far delicacy of taste, and that of passion,
are connected together in the original frame of the
mind, it is hard to determine. To me there ap∣pears
a very considerable connexion between them.
For we may observe that women, who have more
delicate passions then men, have also a more delicate
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
taste of the ornaments of life, of dress, equipage,
and the ordinary decencies of behaviour. Any ex∣cellency
in these hits their taste much sooner than
ours; and when you please their taste, you soon en∣gage
their affections.</P>
<P>BUT whatever connection there may be original∣ly
betwixt these dispositions, I am persuaded, that
nothing is so proper to cure us of this delicacy of
passion, as the cultivating of that higher and more
refined taste, which enables us to judge of the cha∣racters
of men, of compositions of genius, and of
the productions of the nobler arts. A greater or
less relish of those obvious beauties which strike the
senses, depends entirely upon the greater or less sen∣sibility
of the temper: But with regard to the scien∣ces
and liberal arts, a fine taste is, in some measure
the same with strong sense, or at least depends so
much upon it, that they are inseparable. To judge
aright of a composition of genius, there are so many
views to be taken in, so many circumstances to be
compared, and such a knowledge of human nature
requisite, that no man, who is not possessed of the
foundest judgment, will ever make a tolerable critic
in such performances. And this is a new reason for
cultivating a relish in the liberal arts. Our judgment
will strengthen by this exercise: We shall form juster
notions of life: Many things, which please or afflict
others, will appear to us too frivolous to engage our
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
attention: And we shall lose by degrees that sensibi∣lity
and delicacy of passion, which is so incommo∣dious.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps I have gone too far in saying, That
a cultivated taste for the polite arts extinguishes the
passions, and renders us indifferent to those objects
which are so fondly pursued by the rest of mankind.
On farther reslection, I find, that it rather improves
our sensibility for all the tender and agreeable pas∣sions;
at the same time that it renders the mind
incapable of the rougher and more boisterous e∣motions.</P>
<Q><L>Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes,</L>
<L>Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros.</L></Q>
<P>FOR this, I think there may be assigned two very
natural reasons. In the <HI>first</HI> place, nothing is so im∣proving
to the temper as the study of the beauties,
either of poetry, eloquence, musick, or painting.
They give a certain elegance of sentiment, to which
the rest of mankind are entire strangers. The emo∣tions
they excite are sost and tender. They draw
the mind off from the hurry of business and inte∣rest;
cherish reflection; dispose to tranquillity; and
produce an agreeable melancholy, which, of all dis∣positions
of the mind, is the best suited to love and
friendship.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
In the <HI>second</HI> place, a delicacy of taste is faour∣able
to love and friendship, by confining our choice
to few people, and making us indifferent to the
company and conversation of the greatest part of
men. You will very seldom find, that mere men
of the world, whatever strong sense they may be
endowed with, are very nice in distinguishing of cha∣racters,
or in marking those insensible differences and
gradations which make one man preferable to ano∣ther.
Any one, that has competent sense, is suffi∣cient
for their entertainment: They talk to him,
of their pleasure and affairs, with the same frank∣ness
as they would to another; and finding many,
who are fit to supply his place, they never feel any
vacancy or want in his absence. But to make use
of the allusion of a celebrated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Menf.</HI> FONTENELLS, <HI>Plura<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ité de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mendes.</HI> Soir &amp;</NOTE> FRENCH author, the
judgment may be compared to a clock or watch,
where the most ordinary machine is sufficient to tell
the hours; but the most elaborate and artificial alone
can point out the minutes and seconds, and distin∣guish
the smallest differences of time. One that has
well digested his knowledge both of books and men,
has little enjoyment but in the company of a few se∣lect
companions. He feels too sensibly, how much
all the rest of mankind fall short of the notions which
he has entertained. And, his affections being thus
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
confined within a narrow circle, no wonder he carries
them further than if they were more general and
undistinguished. The gaiety and frolic of a bottle-companion
improves with him into a solid friendship:
And the ardours of a youthful appetite become an
elegant passon.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the LIBERTY of the PRESS.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more apt to surprize a fo∣reigner,
than the extreme liberty, which we
enjoy in this country, of communicating whatever
we please to the public, and of openly censuring
every measure, entered into by the king or his mi∣nisters.
If the administration resolve upon war, 'tis
affirmed, that either wilfully or ignorantly they mis∣take
the interest of the nation, and that peace, in
the present situation of affairs, is infinitely prefer∣able.
If the passion of the ministers lie towards
peace, our political writers breathe nothing but wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and devastation, and represent the pacific conduct of
the government as mean and pusillanimous. As this
liberty is not indulged in any other government,
either republican or monarchical; in HOLLAND and
VENICE, no more than in FRANCE or SPAIN; it
may very naturally give occasion to these two ques∣tions,
<HI>How it happens that</HI> GREAT BRITAIN <HI>enjoys
such a peculiar privilege?</HI> and <HI>Whether the unlimited
exercise of this liberty be advantageous or prejudicial
to the public?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
As to the fust question, Why the laws indulge
us in such an extraordinary liberty? I believe the
reason may be derived from our mixed form of go∣vernment,
which is neither wholly monarchical, nor
wholly republican. It will be found, if I mistake
not, a true observation in politics, that the two ex∣tremes
in government, liberty and slavery, common∣ly
approach nearest to each other; and that as you
depart from the extremes, and mix a little of mo∣narchy
with liberty, the government becomes al∣ways
the more free; and on the other hand, when
you mix a little of liberty with monarchy, the yoke
becomes always the more grievous and intolerable.
I shall endeavour to explain myself. In a govern∣ment,
such as that of FRANCE, which is entirely ab∣solute,
and where laws, custom, and religion concur,
all of them, to make the people fully satisfied with
their condition, the monarch cannot entertain the
least <HI>jealousy</HI> against his subjects, and therefore is
apt to indulge them in great <HI>liberties</HI> both of speech
and action. In a government altogether republican,
such as that of HOLLAND, where there is no ma∣gistrate
so eminent as to give <HI>jealousy</HI> to the state,
there is no danger in intrusting the magistrates with
very large discretionary powers; and though many
advantages result from such powers, in the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣ing
peace and order, yet they lay a considerable
restraint on men's actions, and make every pri∣vate
subject pay a great respect to the government.
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Thus it seems evident, that the two extremes of
absolute monarchy and of a republic, approach very
near to each other in some material circumstan∣ces.
In the <HI>first,</HI> the magistrate has no jealousy of
the people: In the <HI>second,</HI> the people have no jea∣lousy
of the magistrate: Which want of jealousy be∣gets
a mutual confidence and trust in both cases,
and produces a species of liberty in monarchies, and
of arbitrary power in republics.</P>
<P>TO justify the other part of the foregoing ob∣servation,
that in every government the means are
most wide of each other, and that the mixtures of
monarchy and liberty render the yoke either more
easy or more grievous; I must take notice of a re∣mark
of TACITUS with regard to the ROMANS
under the emperors, that they neither could bear
total slavery nor total liberty, <HI>Nec totam servitutem,
nec totam liberta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em pati poslunt.</HI> This remark a ce∣lebrated
poet has translated and applied to the ENG∣LISH,
in his lively description of queen ELIZABETH'S
policy and government.</P>
<Q><L>Et f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t ai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er son joug a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Anglois indompé,</L>

<L>HENRIADE, Liv. 1.</L></Q>
<P>ACCORDING to these remarks, we are to consi∣der
the ROMAN government under the emperors as
a mixture of despotism and liberty, where the de∣spotism
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
prevailed; and the ENGLISH government
as a mixture of the same kind, but where the liberty
predominates. The consequences are exactly con∣formable
to the foregoing observation; and such as
may be expected from those mixed forms of govern∣ment,
which beget a mutual watchfulness and jealousy.
The ROMAN emperors were, many of them, the most
frightful tyrants that ever disgraced human nature;
and 'tis evident their cruelty was chiefly excited by
their <HI>jealousy,</HI> and by their observing, that all the
great men of ROME bore with impatience the do∣minion
of a family, which, but a little before, was
no ways superior to their own. On the other hand,
as the republican part of the government prevails in
ENGLAND, though with a great mixture of monar∣chy,
'tis obliged, for its own preservation, to main∣tain
a watchful <HI>jealousy</HI> over the magistrates, to remove
all discretionary powers, and to secure every one's
life and fortune by general and inflexible laws. No
action must be deemed a crime but what the law
has plainly determined to be such: No crime must
be imputed to a man but from a legal proof before
his judges; and even these judges must be his
fellow-subjects, who are obliged, by their own in∣terest,
to have a watchful eye over the encroachments
and violence of the ministers. From these causes it
proceeds, that there is as much liberty, and eyen,
perhaps, licentiousness in BRITAIN, as there were
formerly slavery and tyranny in ROME.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
THESE principles account for the great liberty of
the press in these kingdoms, beyond what is indulg∣ed
in any other government. 'Tis sufficiently known,
that arbitrary power would steal in upon us, were
we not extremely watchful to prevent its progress,
and were there not an easy method of conveying
the alarum from one end of the kingdom to the
other. The spirit of the people must frequently be
rouzed in order to curb the ambition of the court;
and the dread of rousing this spirit, must be em∣ployed
to prevent that ambition. Nothing so ef∣fectual
to this purpose as the liberty of the press,
by which all the learning, wit and genius of the
nation may be employed on the side of liberty, and
every one be animated to its defence. As long,
therefore, as the republican part of our government
can maintain itself against the monarchical, it must
be extremely jealous of the liberty of the press, as
of the utmost importance to its preservation.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore the liberty of the press is so es∣sential
to the support of our mixed government;
this sufficiently decides the second question, <HI>Whether
this liberty be advantageous or prejudicial;</HI> there be∣ing
nothing of greater importance in every state
than the preservation of the ancient government,
especially if it be a free one. But I would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain go
a step farther, and assert, that such a liberty is at∣tended
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
with so few inconveniencies, that it may be
claimed as the common right of mankind, and ought
to be indulged them almost in every government:
except the ecclesiastical, to which indeed it would
prove fatal. We need not dread from this liberty
any such ill consequences as followed from the ha∣rangues
of the popular demagogues of ATHENS and
tribunes of ROME. A man reads a book or pam∣phlet
alone and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>olly. There is none present from
whom he can catch the passion by contagion. He
is not hurried away by the force and energy of action.
And should he be wrought up to ever so seditious
a humour, there is no violent resolution presented
to him, by which he can immediately vent his pas∣sion.
The liberty of the press, therefore, however
abused, can scarce ever excite popular tumults or
rebellion. And as to those murmurs or secret dis∣contents
it may occasion, 'tis better they should get
vent in words, that they may come to the know∣ledge
of the magistrate before it be too late, in or∣der
to his providing a remedy against them. Man∣kind,
it is true, have always a greater propension to
believe what is said to the disadvantage of their go∣vernors,
than the contrary; but this inclination is
inseparable from them, whether they have liberty
or not. A whisper may fly as quick, and be as
pernicious as a pamphlet. Nay, it will be more per∣nicious,
where men are not accustomed to think freely,
or distinguish betwixt truth and falshood.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
IT has also been found, as the experience of man∣kind
increases, that the <HI>pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple</HI> are no such dange∣rous
monster as they have been represented, and that
it is in every respect better to guide them, like ra∣tional
creatures, than to lead or drive them, like
brute beasts. Before the United Provinces set the
example, toleration was deemed incompatible with
good government; and it was thought impossible,
that a number of religious sects could live together
in harmony and peace, and have all of them an
equal affection to their common country, and to each
other. ENGLAND has set a like example of civil
liberty; and though this liberty seems to occasion
some small ferment at present, it has not as yet
produced any pernicious effects; and it is to be
hoped, that men, being every day more accustomed
to the free discussion of public affairs, will improve
in the judgment of them, and be with greater dif∣ficulty
seduced by every idle rumour and popular
clamour.</P>
<P>IT is a very comfortable reflection to the lovers
of liberty, that this peculiar privilege of BRITAIN
is of a kind that cannot easily be wrested from us,
but must last as long as our government remains,
in any degree, free and independent. It is seldom,
that liberty of any kind is lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t all at once. Slavery
has so frightful an aspect to men accustomed to
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
freedom, that it must steal upon them by degrees, and
must disguise itself in a thousand shapes, in order to
be received. But, if the liberty of the press ever be
lost, it must be lost at once. The general laws a∣gainst
sedition and libelling are at present as strong as
they possibly can be made. Nothing can impose a
farther restraint, but either the clapping an IMPRIMA∣MUR
upon the press, or the giving to the court very
large discretionary powers to punish whatever dis∣pleases
them. But these concessions would be such
a bare-faced violation of liberty, that they will pro∣tably
be the last efforts of a despotic government.
We may conclude, that the liberty of <HI>Britain</HI> is gone
for ever when these attempts shall succeed.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
<HEAD>ESSAY III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of IMPUDENCE and MODESTY.</HEAD>
<P>I AM of opinion, That the common complaints
against Providence are ill-grounded, and that
the good or bad qualities of men are the causes of
their good or bad fortune, more than what is gene∣rally
imagined. There are, no doubt, instances to
the contrary, and these too pretty numerous; but few,
in comparison of the instances we have of a right
distribution of prosperity and adversity: nor indeed
could it be otherwise from the common course of
human affairs. To be endowed with a benevolent
disposition, and to love others, will almost infalli∣bly
procure love and esteem; which is the chief
circumstance in life, and facilitates every enterprize
and undertaking; besides the satisfaction, which im∣mediately
results from it. The case is much the
same with the other virtues. Prosperity is natu∣rally,
though not necessarily, attached to virtue and
merit; and adversity, in like manner, to vice and
folly.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
I MUST, however, confess, that this rule admits
of an exception, with regard to one moral quality;
and that <HI>modesty</HI> has a natural tendency to conceal
a man's talents, as <HI>impudence</HI> displays them to the
utmost, and has been the only cause why many have
risen in the world, under all the disadvantages of
low birth and little merit. Such indolence and in∣capacity
is there in the generality of mankind, that
they are apt to receive a man for whatever he has
a mind to put himself off for; and admit his over∣bearing
airs as proofs of that merit which he assumes
to himself. A decent assurance seems to be the na∣tural
attendant of virtue; and few men can distin∣guish
impudence from it: As, on the other hand,
diffidence, being the natural result of vice and folly,
has drawn disgrace upon modesty, which in outward
appearance so nearly resembles it.</P>
<P>As impudence, though really a vice, has the same
effects upon a man's fortune, as if it were a virtue;
so we may observe, that it is almost as difficult to
be attained, and is, in that respect, distinguished
from all the other vices, which are acquired with
little pains, and continually encreate upon indulgence.
Many a man, being sensible that modesty is extreme∣ly
prejudicial to him in making his fortune, has
resolved to be impudent, and to put a bold face
upon the matter: But, it is observable, that such
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
people have seldom succeeded in the attempt, but
have been obliged to relapse into their primitive
modesty. Nothing carries a man through the world
like a true genuine natural impudence. Its counter∣feit
is good for nothing, nor can ever support it∣self.
In any other attempt, whatever faults a man
commits and is sensible of, he is so much the nearer
his end. But when he endeavours at impudence,
if he ever failed in the attempt, the remembrance
of that failure will make him blush, and will infal∣libly
disconcert him: After which every blush is a
cause for new blushes, till he be found out to be an
arrant cheat, and a vain pretender to impudence.</P>
<P>IF any thing can give a modest man more assu∣rance,
it must be some advantages of fortune, which
chance procures to him. Riches naturally gain a
man a favourable reception in the world, and give
merit a double lustre, when a person is endow∣ed
with it; and supply its place, in a great mea∣sure,
when it is absent. It is wonderful to observe
what airs of superiority fools and knaves, with large
possessions, give themselves above men of the greatest
merit in poverty. Nor do the men of merit make
any strong opposition to these usurpations; or rather
seem to favour them by the modesty of their be∣haviour.
Their good sense and experience make
them diffident of their judgment, and cause them to
examine every thing with the greatest accuracy: As,
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
on the other hand, the delicacy of their sentiments
makes them timorous lest they commit faults, and
lese in the practice of the world that integrity of
virtue, so to speak, of which they are so jealous. To
make wisdom agree with confidence, is as difficult
as to reconcile vice and modesty.</P>
<P>THESE are the reflections which have occurred up∣on
this subject of impudence and modesty; and I
hope the reader will not be displeased to see them
wrought into the following allegory,</P>
<P>JUPITER, in the beginning, joined VIRTUE,
WISDOM, and CONFIDENCE together; and VICE,
FOLLY, and DIFFIDENCE: And thus connected,
sent them into the world. But though he thought
he had matched them with great judgment, and said
that <HI>Confidence</HI> was the natural companion of <HI>Vir∣tue,</HI>
and that <HI>Vice</HI> deserved to be attended with <HI>Dif∣fidence,</HI>
they had not gone far before dissension arose
among them. <HI>Wisdom,</HI> who was the guide of the
one company, was always accustomed before she
ventured upon any road, however beaten, to exa∣mine
it carefully; to enquire whither it led; what
dangers, difficulties and hindrances might possbly
or probably occur in it. In these deliberations she
usually consumed some time; which delay was very
displeasing to <HI>Confidence,</HI> who was always inclined
to hurry on, without much forethought or delibe∣ration,
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
in the first road he met. <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI>
were inseparable: But <HI>Confidence</HI> one day, following
his impetuous nature, advanced a considerable way
before his guides and companions; and not feeling
any want of their company, he never enquired after
them, nor ever met with them more. In like man∣ner,
the other society, though joined by JUPITER,
disagreed and separated. As <HI>Folly</HI> saw very little way
before her, she had nothing to determine concern∣ing
the goodness of roads, nor could give the pre∣ference
to one above another; and this want of reso∣lution
was encreased by <HI>Diffidence,</HI> who, with her
doubts and scruples, always retarded the journey.
This was a great annoyance to <HI>Vice,</HI> who loved not
to hear of difficulties and delays, and was never
satisfied without his full career, in whatever his in∣clinations
led him to. <HI>Folly,</HI> he knew, though she
hearkened to <HI>Diffidence,</HI> would be easily managed
when alone; and therefore, as a vicious horse throws
his rider, he openly beat away this controller of all
his pleasures, and proceeded in his journey with
<HI>Folly,</HI> from whom he is inseparable. <HI>Confidence</HI> and
<HI>Diffidence</HI> being, after this manner, both thrown loose
from their respective companies, wandered <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or some
time; till at last chance led them at the same time
to one village. <HI>Confidence▪</HI> went directly up to the
great house, which belonged to WEALTH, the lord
of the village; and without staying for a porter, in∣truded
himself immediately into the innermost apart∣ments,
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
where he found <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Folly</HI> well received
before him. He joined the train; recommended him∣self
very quickly to his landlord; and entered into
such familiarity with <HI>Vice,</HI> that he was enlisted in the
same company with <HI>Folly.</HI> They were frequent guests
of <HI>Wealth,</HI> and from that moment inseparable. <HI>Diffi∣dence,</HI>
in the mean time, not daring to approach the
great house, accepted of an invitation from POVERTY,
one of the tenants; and entering the cottage, found
<HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> who being repulsed by the land∣lord,
had retired thither. <HI>Virtue</HI> took compassion of
her, and <HI>Wisdom</HI> found, from her temper, that she
would easily improve: So they admitted her into their
society. Accordingly, by their means, she altered
in a little time somewhat of her manner, and be∣coming
much more amiable and engaging, was now
known by the name of <HI>Modesty.</HI> As ill company has
a greater effect than good, <HI>Confidence,</HI> though more
refractory to counsel and example, degenerated so far
by the society of <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Folly,</HI> as to pass by the
name of IMPUDENCE. Mankind, who saw these so∣cieties
as JUPITER first joined them, and know no∣thing
of these mutual desertions, are thereby led into
strange mistakes; and wherever they see <HI>Impudence,</HI>
make account of finding <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and
wherever they observe <HI>Modesty,</HI> call her attendants

<HEAD>ESSAY IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That POLITICS may be reduced to a SCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a question with several, Whether there be
any essèntial difference between one form of go∣vernment
and another? and, whether every form may
not become good or bad, according as it is well or
ill administred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>For forms of government let fools contest:</L>
<L>Whate'er is best administer'd is best.</L>
<L>ESSAY on Man, Book 3.</L></NOTE>? Were it once admitted, that all
governments are alike, and that the only difference
consists in the character and conduct of the gover∣nors,
most political disputes would be at an end,
and all <HI>Zeal</HI> for one constitution above another, must
be esteemed mere bigotry and folly. But, though
a friend to Moderation, I cannot forbear condem∣ning
this sentiment, and should be sorry to think,
that human affairs admit of no greater stability, than
what they receive from the casual humours and cha∣racters
of particular men.</P>
<P>'TIS true, those who maintain, that the goodness
of all government consists in the goodness of the ad∣ministration,
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
may cite many particular instances in
history, where the very sam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> government, in diffe∣rent
hands, has varied suddenly into the two oppo∣site
extremes of good and bad. Compare the FRENCH
government under HENRY III. and under HENRY
IV. Oppression, levity, artifice on the part of the
rulers; faction, sedition, treachery, rebellion, disloy∣alty
on the part of the subjects: These compose the
character of the former miserable aera. But when the
patriot and heroic prince, who succeeded, was once
firmly seated on the throne, the government, the
people, every thing seemed to be totally changed;
and all from the difference of the temper and senti∣ments
of these two sovereigns. An equal difference
of a contrary kind, may be found on comparing the
reigns of ELIZABETH and JAMES, at least with re∣gard
to foreign affairs: and instances of this kind
may be multiplied, almost without number, from an∣cient
as well as modern history.</P>
<P>BUT here I would beg leave to make a distinction.
All absolute governments (and such, in a great mea∣sure,
was that of ENGLAND, till the middle of
the last century, notwithstanding the numerous pane∣gyrics
on ancient ENGLISH liberty) must very much
depend on the administration; and this is one of the
great inconveniences of that form of government.
But a republican and free government would be a
most obvious absurdity, if the particular checks and
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
controuls, provided by the constitution, had really
no influence, and made it not the interest, even of
bad men, to operate for the public good. Such is
the intention of these forms of government, and such
is their real effect, where they are wisely constitu∣ted:
As, on the other hand, they are the sources
of all disorder, and of the blackest crimes, where
either skill or honesty has been wanting in their origi∣nal
frame and institution.</P>
<P>SO great is the force of laws, and of particular
forms of government, and so little dependence have
they on the humours and tempers of men, that con∣sequences
almost as general and certain may be de∣duced
from them, on most occasions, as any which
the mathematical sciences afford us.</P>
<P>THE ROMAN government gave the whole legis∣lative
power to the commons, without allowing a
negative either to the nobility or consuls. This un∣bounded
power the commons possessed in a collec∣tive,
not in a representative body. The consequen∣ces
were: When the people, by success and conquest,
had become very numerous, and had spread them∣selves
to a great distance from the capital, the city-tribes,
tho' the most contemptible, carried almost every
vote: They were, therefore most cajoled by every
one who affected popularity: They were supported in
idleness by the general distribution of corn, and by
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
particular bribes, which they received from almost
every candidate: By this means they became every
day more licentious, and the CAMPUS MARTIUS
was a perpetual scene of tumult and sedition: Armed
slaves were introduced among these rascally citizens;
so that the whole government fell into anarchy, and
the greatest happiness which the ROMANS could look
for, was the despotic power of the CAESAR<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Such
are the effects of democracy without a representa∣tive.</P>
<P>A NOBILITY may possess the whole, or any part
of the legislative power of a state, in two different
ways. Either every nobleman shares the power as
part of the whole body, or the whole body enjoys
the power as composed of parts, which have each
a distinct power and authority. The VENETIAN ari∣stocracy
is an instance of the first kind of govern∣ment:
The POLISH of the second. In the VENE∣TIAN
government the whole body of nobility pos∣sesses
the whole power, and no nobleman has any
authority which he receives not from the whole.
In the POLISH government every nobleman, by
means of his fiefs, has a peculiar hereditary autho∣rity
over his vassals, and the whole body has no
authority but what it receives from the concurrence
of its parts. The distinct operations and tendencies
of these two species of government might be made
most apparent even <HI>a priori.</HI> A VENETIAN nobility
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
is infinitely preferable to a POLISH, let the humours
and education of men be ever so much varied. A no∣bility,
who possess their power in common, will pre∣serve
peace and order, both among themselves, and their
subjects; and no member can have authority enough
to controul the laws for a moment. The nobles will
preserve their authority over the people, but with∣out
any grievous tyranny, or any breach of private
property; because such a tyrannical government pro∣motes
not the interest of the whole body, however
it may that of some individuals. There will be a
distinction of rank between the nobility and people,
but this will be the only distinction in the state.
The whole nobility will form one body, and the
whole people another, without any of those private
feuds and animosities, which spread ruin and desola∣tion
every where. 'Tis easy to see the disadvan∣tages
of a POLISH nobility in every one of these
particulars.</P>
<P>'Tis possible so to constitute a free government,
as that a single person, call him duke, prince, or
king, shall possess a very large share of power, and
shall form a proper balance or counterpoise to the
other parts of the legislature. This chief magistrate
may be either <HI>elective</HI> or <HI>hereditary;</HI> and though the
former institution may, to a superficial view, appear
the most advantageous; yet a more accurate inspec∣tion
will discover in it greater inconveniencies than
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
in the latter, and such as are sounded on causes and
principles eternal and immutable. The filling of the
throne, in such a government, is a point of too great
and too general interest, not to divide the whole people
into factions: From whence a civil war, the greatest
of ills, may be apprehended, almost with certainty,
upon very vacancy. The prince elected must be
either a <HI>Foreigner</HI> or a <HI>Native:</HI> The former will be
ignorant of the people whom he is to govern; sus∣picious
of his new subjects, and suspected by them;
giving his confidence entirely to strangers, who will
have no other care but of enriching themsclves in
the quickest manner, while their master's favour and
authority are able to support them. A native will
carry into the throne all his private animosities and
friendships, and will never be regarded, in his ele∣vation,
without exciting the sentiments of envy in
those, who formerly considered him as their equal.
Not to mention, that a crown is too high a reward
ever to be given to merit alone, and will always
induce the candidates to employ force, or money,
or intrigue, to procure the votes of the electors: SO
that such an election will give no better chance for
superior merit in the prince, than if the state had
trusted to birth alone for determining their sovereign.</P>
<P>IT may therefore be pronounced as an universal
axiom in politics, <HI>That an hereditary prince, a nobi∣lity
without vassals, and a people voting by their re∣presentatives
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
form the best</HI> MONARCHY, ARISTO∣CRACY,
<HI>and</HI> DEMOCRACY. But in order to prove
more fully, that politics admit of general truths, which
are invariable by the humor or education either of
subject or sovereign, it may not be amiss to observe
fome other principles of this science, which may seem
to deserve that character.</P>
<P>IT may easily be observed, that though free go∣vernments
have been commonly the most happy for
those who partake of their freedom; yet are they
the most ruinous and oppressive to their provinces:
And this observation may, I believe, be fixed as a
maxim of the kind we are here speaking of. When
a monarch extends his dominions by conquest, he
soon learns to consider his old and his new <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣jects
as on the same footing; because, in reality,
all his subjects are to him the same, except the few
friends and favourites, with whom he is personally
acquainted. He does not, therefore, make any dis∣tinction
betwixt them in his <HI>general</HI> laws; and, at
the same time, is no less careful to prevent all <HI>par∣ticular</HI>
acts of oppression on the one as on the other.
But a free state nccessarily makes a great distinction
and must always do so, till men learn to love their
neighbours as well as themselves. The conquerors,
in such a government, are all legislators, and will
be sure so to contrive matters, by restrictions of trade,
and by taxes, as to draw some private, as well as
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
public, advantage from their conquests. Provincial
governors have also a better chance in a republic,
to escape with their plunder, by means of bribery
or interest, and their fellow-citizens, who find their
own state to be inriched by the spoils of the sub∣ject-provinces,
will be the more inclined to tole∣rate
such abuses. Not to mention, that it is a ne∣cessary
precaution in a free state to change the go∣vernors
frequently; which obliges these temporary
tyrants to be more expeditious and rapacious, that
they may accumulate sufficient wealth before they
give place to their successors. What cruel tyrants
were the ROMANS over the world during the time
of their commonwealth! 'Tis true, they had laws
to prevent oppression in their provincial magistrates;
but CICERO informs us, that the ROMANS could
not better consult the interest of the provinces than
by repealing these very laws. For, in that case,
says he, our magistrates, having intire impunity,
would plunder no more than would satissy their
own rapaciousness: Whereas, at present, they must
also satisfy that of their judges, and of all the great
men of ROME, whose protection they stand in need
of. Who can read of the cruelties and oppressions
of VERRES without horror and astonishment? And
who is not touched with indignation to hear, that
after CICERO had exhausted on that abandoned cri∣minal
all the thunders of his eloquence, and had
prevailed so far as to get him condemned to the
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
utmost extent of the laws; yet that cruel tyrant
lived peaceably to old age, in opulence and ease,
and, thirty years afterward, was put into the pro∣scription
by MARK ANTHONY, on account of his
exorbitant wealth, where he fell, with CICERO him∣self,
and all the most virtuous men of ROME? After
the dissolution of the commonwealth, the ROMAN
yoke became easier upon the provinces, as TACI∣TUS
informs us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ann. lib. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE>; and it may be observed, that
many of the worst emperors, DOMITIAN<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">SUET. in vita DOMIT.</NOTE>, for in∣stance,
were very careful to prevent all oppression
of the provinces. In<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Egregium resumend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e libertati tempus, si ipsi f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crentes, qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> inops ITALIA, quam imbellis urbana plebs, nibil validum in ex∣crcitibus, ni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i quod externum cogitaent. <HI>TACIT, Ann. lib.</HI> 3.</NOTE> TIBERIUS'S time, GAUI▪ was esteemed richer than ITALY itself: Nor, do I
find, during the whole time of the ROMAN monar∣chy,
that the empire became less rich or populous
in any of its provinces; though indeed its valour and
military discipline were always upon the decline.
The oppression and tyranny of the CARTHA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>INIANS
over their subject states in AFRICA went so far, as
we learn from POLYBIUS<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. cap. 72.</NOTE> that not content with
exacting the half of all the product of the ground,
which of itself was a very high rent, they also loaded
them with many other taxes. If we Pass from an∣tient
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
to modern times, we shall always find the ob∣servation
to hold. The provinces of absolute mo∣narchies
are always better treated than those of free
states. Compare the <HI>Païs conquis</HI> of FRANCE with
IRELAND, and you will be convinced of this truth;
though this latter kingdom being, in a good measure,
people from ENGLAND, possesses so many rights
and privileges as should naturally make it challenge
better treatment than that of a conquered province.
CORSICA is also an obvious instance to the same
purpose.</P>
<P>THERE is an observation of MACHIAVEL, with
regard to the conquests of ALEXANDER the Great,
which, I think, may be regarded as one of those eter∣nal
political truths which no time nor accidents can
vary. It may seem strange, says that politician, that
such sudden conquests, as those of ALEXANDER, should
be possessed so peaceably by his successors, and that
the PERSIANS, during all the confusions and civil
wars of the GREEKS, never made the smallest efforts
towards the recovery of their former independent go∣vernment.
To satisfy us concerning the cause of this
remarkable event, we may consider, that a monarch
may govern his subjects in two different ways. He may
either follow the maxims of the eastern princes, and
stretch his power so far as to leave no distinction of
ranks among his subjects, but what proceeds imme∣diately
from himself; no advantages of birth; no
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
hereditary honours and possessions; and, in a word,
no credit among the people, except from his com∣mission
alone. Or a monarch may exert his power
after a milder manner, like our EUROPEAN princes;
and leave other sources of honour, beside his smile
and favour: Birth, titles, possessions, valour, integri∣ty,
knowledge, or great and fortunate atchievements.
In the former species of government, after a conquest,
'tis impossible ever to shake off the yoke; since no
one possesses, among the people, so much personal
credit and authority as to begin such an enterprize:
Whereas, in the latter, the least misfortune, or dis∣cord
of the victors, will encourage the vanquished
to take arms, who have leaders ready to prompt and
conduct them in every undertaking<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I HAVE taken it for granted, according to the supposition of MACHIAVEL, that the antient PERSIANS had no nobi∣lity; tho' there is reason to suspect, that the FLORENTINE secretary, who seems to have been better acquainted with the ROMAN than the GREEK authors, was mistaken in this parti∣cular. The more antient PERSIANS, whose manners are de∣scribed by XENOPHON, were a free people, and had nobility. Their <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> were preserved even after the extending of their conquests and the consequent change of their government. AR∣RIAN mentions them in DARIUS'S time, <HI>De exp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</HI> AL<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>X. lib. 2. Historians also speak often of the persons in command as men of family. TYGRANES, who was general of the MEDES under XERXES, was of the race of ACHAEMENES, HEROD. lib. 7. cap. 62. ARTACHAEES, who directed the cutting of the canal about mount AT<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OS, was of the same family. Id. cap. 117. MEGA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>YZUS was one of the seven eminent PER∣SIANS who conspired against the MAGI. His son, ZOPYaUS, was in the highest command under DARIUS, and delivered BABYLON to him. His grandson, MEGA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>YZUS, command∣ed the army, defeated at MARATHON. His great grandson ZOPYRUS, was also eminent, and was banished PERSIA. HE∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ON. lib. 3. THUC. lib. 1. ROSACES, who commanded an army in Aegypt under ARTAXEXES, was also descended from one of the seven conspirators; DIOD. SIc. lib. 16. AGESI∣LAUS, in XENOPHON, Hist. GRAEC. lib. 4. being desirous of making a marriage betwixt king COTYS his ally, and the daughter of SPITHRIDATES a PERSIAN of rank, who had deserted to him, first asks COTYS what family SPITHRIDATES is of. One of the most considerable in PERSIA, says COTYS. ARIAEUS, when offered the sovereignty by CLEARCHUS and the ten thousand GREEKS, refused it as of too low a rank, and said, that so many eminent PEZSIANS, would never endure his rule. <HI>Id. de. exped.</HI> lib. 2. Some of the families, descend∣ed from the seven PERSIANS abovementioned remained during all ALEXANDER's successors; and MITHRIDATES, in AN∣TIOCHUS' time, is said by POLYBIUS to be descended from one of them, lib. 5. cap. 43. ARTABAZUS was esteemed, as ARRIAN says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. lib. 3. And when ALEXANDER married in one day 80 of his captains to PERSIAN women, his intention plainly was to ally the MACEDONIANS with the most eminent Persians families. Id. lib. 7. DIODORUS SICULUS says they were of the most noble birth in PERSIA, lib. 17. The government of PERSIA was despotic, and conducted, in many respects, after the eastern man∣ner, but was not carried so far as to extirpate all nobility, and confound all ranks and orders. It left men who were still great, by themselves and their family, independent of their office and commission. And the reason why the MACEDO∣NIANS kept so easily dominion over them was owing to other causès easy to be found in the historians; tho' it must be owned that MACHIAVEL's reasoning is, in itself, just, how∣ever doubtful its application to the present case.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38"/>
SUCH is the reasoning of MACHIAVEL, which
seems to me very solid and conclusive; though I
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
wish he had not mixed falshood with truth, in as∣serting,
that monarchies governed according to the
eastern policy, though more easily kept when once
subdued, yet are the most difficult to subdue; since
they cannot contain any powerful subject, whose dis∣content
and faction may facilitate the enterprizes of
an enemy. For besides, that such a tyrannical go∣vernment
enervates the courage of men, and ren∣ders
them indifferent towards the fortunes of their
sovereign; besides this, I say, we find by experience,
that even the temporary and delegated authority of
the generals and magistrates; being always, in such
governments, as absolute within its sphere, as that
of the prince himself; is able, with barbarians ac∣customed
to a blind submission, to produce the most
dangerous and fatal revolutions. So that, in every
respect, a gentle government is preferable, and gives
the greatest security to the sovereign as well as to
the subject.</P>
<P>LEGISLATORS, therefore, ought not to trust the
future government of a state entirely to chance, but
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
ought to provide a system of laws to regulate the
administration of public affairs to the latest posteri∣ty.
Effects will always correspond to causes; and
wise regulations in any commonwealth, are the most
valuable legacy which can be left to future ages.
In the smallest court or office, the stated forms and
methods, by which business must be conducted, are
found to be a considerable check on the natural de∣pravity
of mankind. Why should not the case be
the same in public affairs? Can we ascribe the sta∣bility
and wisdom of the VENETIAN government,
through so many ages, to any thing but the form
of government? And is it not easy to point out those
defects in the original constitution, which produced
the tumultuous governments of ATHENS and ROME,
and ended at last in the ruin of these two famous
republics? And so little dependance has this affair
on the humours and education of particular men,
that one part of the same republic may be wisely
conducted, and another weakly, by the very same
men, merely on account of the difference of the forms
and institutions, by which these parts are regulated.
Historians inform us that this was actually the case
with GENOA. For while the state was always full
of sedition, and tumult, and disorder, the bank of
St. GEORGE, which had become a considerable part
of the people, was conducted, for several ages, with
the utmost integrity and wisdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essemp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a vera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> raro, &amp; da Filososi intante loro imaginate &amp; vedute Republiche mai non trevato, vedere dentro ad un mede∣simo cerchio, fra medesimi cittadini, la liberta, &amp; la tirannide, la vita civile et la corotta, la giustitia &amp; la licenza; perche quello or dine solo mantiene quella citta piena di cestumi antichi &amp; vencrabili.

<P><PB N="39" REF="41"/>
The ages of greatest public spirit are not always
most eminent for private virtue. Good laws may
beget order and moderation in the government, where
the manners and customs have instilled little huma∣nity
or justice into the tempers of men. The most
illustrious period of the ROMAN history, considered
in a political view, is that between the beginning of
the first and end of the last PUNIC war; the due ba∣lance
between the nobility and people being then
fixed by the contests of the tribunes, and not being
yet lost by the extent of conquests. Yet at this very
time, the horrid practice of poisoning was so com∣mon,
that, during part of a season, a <HI>Praetor</HI> punish∣ed
capitally for this crime above three thousand<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">T. LIVIX, lib. 40. cap. 43.</NOTE> per∣sons,
in a part of ITALY; and found informations
of this nature still multiplying upon him. There
is a similar, or rather a worse instance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Id.</HI> lib. 8. cap. 18.</NOTE>, in the more
early times of the commonwealth. So depraved in
private life were that people, whom in their histories
we so much admire. I doubt not but they were
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
really more virtuous during the time of the two <HI>Fri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>virates,</HI>
when they were tearing their common

<P>HERE, then, is a sufficient inducement to maintain,
with the utmost ZEAL, in every free state, those forms
and institutions by which liberty is secured, the pub∣lic
good consulted, and the avarice or ambition of
particular men restrained and punished. Nothing
does more honour to human nature, than to see it
susceptible of so noble a passion; as nothing can be a
greater indication of meanness of heart in any man,
than to see him devoid of it. A man who loves only
himself, without regard to friendship or merit, is a
detestable monster; and a man, who is only suscep∣tible
of friendship, without public spirit, or a regard
to the community, is deficient in the most material
part of virtue.</P>
<P>BUT this is a subject which needs not be longer in∣sisted
on at present. There are enow of zealots on
both sides who kindle up the passions of their parti∣zans,
and under the pretence of public good, pursue
the interests and ends of their particular faction. For
my part, I shall always be more fond of promoting
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
moderation than zeal; tho' perhaps the surest way
of producing moderation in every party is to increase
our zeal for the public. Let us therefore try, if it be
possible, from the foregoing doctrine, to draw a lesson
of moderation with regard to the parties into which
our country is at present<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1742.</NOTE> divided; at the same time,
that we allow not this moderation to abate the industry
and passion with which every individual is bound to
pursue the good of his country.</P>
<P>THOSE who either attack or defend a minister in
such a government as ours, where the utmost liberty
is allowed, always carry matters to an extreme, and
exaggerate his merit or demerit with regard to the pub∣lic.
His enemies are sure to charge him with the
greatest enormities, both in domestic and foreign ma∣nagement;
and there is no meanness nor crime, of
which, in their account, he is not capable. Unne∣cessary
wars, scandalous treaties, profusion of public
treasure, oppressive taxes, every kind of mal-admini∣stration
is ascribed to him. To aggravate the charge,
his pernicious conduct, it is said, will extend its bane∣ful
influence even to posterity, by undermining the
best constitution in the world, and disordering that
wise system of laws, institutions and customs, by which
our ancestors, for so many centuries, have been so
happily governed. He is not only a wicked minister
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
in himself, but has removed every security provided
against wicked ministers for the future.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the partizans of the minister
make his panegyric run as high as the accusation
against him, and celebrate his wise, steady and mo∣derate
conduct in every part of his administration.
The honour and interest of the nation supported
abroad, public credit maintained at home, persecution
restrained, faction subdued; the merit of all these
blessings is ascribed solely to the minister. At the
same time he crowns all his other merits, by a reli∣gious
care of the best constitution in the world, which
he has preserved in all its parts, and has transmitted
entire, to be the happiness and security of the latest
posterity.</P>
<P>WHEN this accusation and panegyric are received
by the partizans of each party, no wonder they be∣get
a most extraordinary ferment on both sides, and
fill the nation with the most violent animosities. But
I would fain persuade these party-zealots, that there
is a fiat contradiction both in the accusation and pane∣gyric,
and that it were impossible for either of them
to run so high, were it not for this contradiction. If
our constitution be really <HI>that noble fabric, the pride
of</HI> BRITAIN, <HI>the envy of our neighbours, raised by the
labour of so many centuries, repaired at the expence of so
many millions; and cemented by such a profusion of blood;</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Dissertation on Parties; Letter 10.</NOTE>
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
I say, if our constitution does in any degree deserve
these eulogies, it would never have suffered a wicked
and weak minister to govern triumphantly for a course
of twenty years, when opposed by the greatest ge∣niuses
of the nation, who exercised the utmost liberty
of tongue and pen, in parliament, and in their fre∣quent
appeals to the people. But, if the minister be
wicked and weak, to the degree so strenuously insisted
on, the constitution must be faulty in its original prin∣ciples,
and he cannot consistently be charged with
undermining the best constitution in the world. A
constitution is only so far good, as it provides a reme∣dy
against mal-administration; and if the BRITISH
constitution, when in its greatest vigour, and repaired
by two such remarkable events, as the <HI>Revolution</HI> and
<HI>Accession,</HI> where our ancient royal family was sacri∣ficed
to it; if our constitution, I say, with so great
advantages, does not, in fact, provide any such re∣medy,
we are rather beholden to any minister who
undermines it, and affords us an opportunity of erect∣ing
in its place a better constitution.</P>
<P>I WOULD make use of the same topics to moderate
the zeal of those who defend the minister. <HI>Is our
constitution so excellent?</HI> Then a change of ministry
can be no such dreadful event; since 'tis essential to
such a constitution, in every ministry, both to preserve
itself from violation, and to prevent all enormitities in
the administration. <HI>Is our constitution very bad?</HI> Then
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
so extraordinary a jealousy and apprehension, on ac∣count
of changes, is il-placed; and a man should no
more be anxious in this case, than a husband, who
had married a woman from the stews, should be watch∣ful
to prevent her infidelity. Public affairs, in such a
constitution, must necessarily go to confusion, by what∣ever
hands they are conducted; and the zeal of <HI>pa∣triots</HI>
is much less requisite in that case than the pa∣tience
and submission of <HI>philosophers.</HI> The virtue and
good intentions of CATO and BRUTUS are highly
laudable; but, to what purpose did their zeal serve?
To nothing, but to hasten the fatal period of the
ROMAN government, and render its convulsions and
dying agonies more violent and painful.</P>
<P>I WOULD not be understood to mean, that public
affairs deserve no care and attention at all. Would
men be moderate and consistent, their claims might
be admitted; at least might be examined. The
<HI>country-party</HI> might still assert, that our constitution,
tho' excellent, will admit of mal administration to
a certain degree; and therefore, if the minister be
bad, 'tis proper to oppose him with a <HI>suitable</HI> degree
of zeal. And, on the other hand, the <HI>court party</HI>
may be allowed, upon the supposition that the mini∣ster
were good, to defend, and with <HI>some</HI> zeal too, his
administration. I would only persuade men not to
contend, as if they were fighting <HI>pro aris &amp; focis,</HI> and
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
change a good constitution into a bad one, by the vio∣lence
of their factions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>What our author's opinion was of the famous minister here pointed at, may be learned from that essay, printed in the former editions, under the title of</HI> A character of Sir ROBERT WALPOLE: <HI>It was as follows:</HI> There never was a man, whose actions and character have been more earnestly and openly canvassed, than those of the present minister, who, having governed a learned and free nation for so long a time, amidst such mighty opposi∣tion, may make a large library of what has been wrote for and against him, and is the subject of above half the paper that has been blotted in the nation within these twenty years. I wish, for the honour of our country, that any one character of him had been drawn with such <HI>judgment</HI> and <HI>impartiality,</HI> as to have some credit with posterity, and to thew, that our liberty has, once at least, been employed to good purpose. I am only afraid of failing in the former quality of judgment: But if it should be so, 'tis but one page more thrown away, after an hundred thousand, upon the same subject, that have perished, and be∣come useless. In the mean time, I shall flatter myself with the pleasing imagination, that the following character will be adopt∣ed by future historians.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>ROBERT WALPOLE,</HI> prime minister of GREAT BRITAIN, is a man of ability, not a genius; good-natured, not virtuous; constant, not magnanimous; moderate, not equi∣table<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Moderate in the exercise of power, not equitable in engrossing it.</NOTE>. His virtues, in some instances, are free from the al∣lay of those vices, which usually accompany such virtues: He is a generous friend, without being a bitter enemy. His vices, in other instances, are not compensated by those virtues which are nearly allyed to them: His want of enterprise is not attended with frugality. The private character of the man is better than the public: His virtues more than his vices: HIs fortune great∣er than his fame. With many good qualities he has incurred the public hatred: With good capacity he has not escaped ridicule. He would have been esteemed more worthy of his high station, had he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever possessed it; and is better qualified for the second than for the first place in any government. His ministry has been more advantageous to his family than to the public, better for this age than for posterity, and more pernicious by bad precedents than by real grievances. During his time trade has flourished, liberty declined, and learning gone to ruin. As I am a man, I love him; as I am a scholar, I hate him; as I am a BRITON, I calmly wish his fall. And were I a member of either house, I would give my vote for removing him from ST. JAMES's; but should be glad to see him retire to HOUGHTON-HALL, to pass the remainder of his days in ease and pleasure.</P>
<P>The author is pleased to find, that after animosities are laid, and calumny has ceased, the whole nation almost have returned to the same moderate sentiments with regard to this great man; if they are not rather become more favourable to him, by a very natural transition, from one extreme to another. The author would not oppose those bu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ane sentiments towards the dead; tho' be cannot forbear observing, that the not paying more of our public debts was, as hinted in this character, a great, and the only great, error in that long admini∣stration.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>
I HAVE not here considered any thing that is per∣sonal
in the present controversy. In the be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t civil con∣stitution,
where every man is restrained by the most
rigid laws, 'tis easy to discover either the good or bad
intentions of a minister, and to judge, whether his
personal character deserves love or hatred. But such
questions are of little importance to the public, and
lay those who employ their pens upon them, under a
just suspicion either of malevolence or flattery.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the FIRST PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more surprizing to those, who
consider human affairs with a philosophical
eye, than to see the easiness with which the many are
governed by the few; and to observe the implicit
submission with which men resign their own senti∣ments
and passions to those of their rulers. When
we enquire by what means this wonder is brought
about, we shall find, that as FORCE is always on the
side of the governed, the governors have nothing to
support them but opinion. 'Tis therefore, on opinion
only that government is founded; and this maxim
extends to the most despotic and most military govern∣ments,
as well as to the most free and most popular.
The soldan of AEGYPT, or the emperor of ROME;
might drive his harmless subjects, like brute beasts,
against their sentiments and inclination: But he must,
at least, have led his <HI>mamalukes,</HI> or <HI>praetorian bands,</HI>
like men, by their opinion.</P>
<P>OPINION is of two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> opinion of INTE∣REST,
and opinion of RIGHT. By opinion of inte∣rest,
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
I chiefly understand the sense of the public ad∣vantage
which is reaped from government; together
with the persuasion, that the particular government,
which is established, is equally advantageous with any
other that could easily be settled. When this opinion
prevails among the generality of a state, or among
those who have the force in their hands, it gives great
security to any government.</P>
<P>RIGHT is of two kinds, right to POWER and right
to PROPERTY. What prevalence opinion of the first
kind has over mankind, may easily be understood by
observing the attachment which all nations have to
their ancient government, and even to those names
which have had the sanction of antiquity. Antiquity
always begets the opinion of right; and whatever
disadvantageous sentiments we may entertain of man∣kind,
they are always found to be prodigal both of
blood and treasure in the maintenance of public jus∣tice.
This passion we may denominate enthusiasm,
or we may give it what appellation we please; but
a politician, who should overlook its influence on
human affairs, would prove himself but of a very
limited understanding. <HI>There is,</HI> indeed, no parti∣cular,
in which, at first sight, there may appear a
greater contradiction in the frame of the human mind
than the present. When men act in a faction, they
are apt, without any shame or remorse, to neglect
all the ties of honour and morality, in order to serve
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
their party; and yet, when a faction is formed upon
a point of right or principle, there is no occasion,
where men discover a greater obstinacy, and a more
determined sense of justice and equity. The same
social disposition of mankind is the cause of both these
contradictory appearances.</P>
<P>'Tis sufficiently understood, that the opinion of
right to property is of the greatest moment in all mat∣ters
of government. A noted author has made pro∣perty
the foundation of all government; and most of
our political writers seem inclined to follow him in
that particular. This is carrying the matter too far;
but still it must be owned, that the opinion of right
to property has a great influence in this subject.</P>
<P>UPON these three opinions, therefore, of public
<HI>interest,</HI> of <HI>right to power,</HI> and of <HI>right to property,</HI> are
all governments founded, and all authority of the few
over the many. There are indeed other principles,
which add force to these, and determine, limit, or
alter their operation; such as <HI>self-interest, fear,</HI> and
<HI>affection:</HI> But still we may assert; that these other
principles can have no influence alone, but suppose
the antecedent influence of those opinions above-mentioned.
They are, therefore, to be esteemed the
secondary, not the original principles of government.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52"/>
FOR, <HI>first,</HI> as to <HI>self-interest,</HI> by which I mean the
expectation of particular rewards, distinct from the
general protection which we receive from govern∣ment,
'tis evident that the magistrate's authority must
be antecedently established, or, at least be hoped for,
in order to produce this expectation. The prospect
of reward may augment the authority with regard to
some particular persons; but can never give birth to
it, with regard to the public. Men naturally look
for the greatest favours from their friends and acquain∣tance;
and therefore, the hopes of any considerable
number of the state, would never center in any par∣ticular
set of men, if these men had no other title to
magistracy, and had no separate influence over the
opinions of mankind. The same observation may be
extended to the other two principles of <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>af∣fection.</HI>
No man would have any reason to <HI>fear</HI> the
fury of a tyrant, if he had no authority over any but
from fear; since, as a single man, his bodily force
can reach but a small way, and all farther power he
prossesses must be founded either on our own opinion,
or on the presumed opinion of others. And tho' <HI>af∣fection</HI>
to wisdom and virtue in a <HI>sovereign</HI> extends
very far, and has great influence; yet he must be an∣tecedently
supposed invested with a public character,
otherwise the public esteem will serve him in no stead,
nor will his virtue have any influence beyond a nar∣row
sphere.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53"/>
A GOVERNMENT may endure for several ages,
tho' the balance of power, and the balance of pro∣perty
do not agree. This chiefly happens, where
any rank or order of the state has acquired a large
share of the property; but, from the original consti∣tution
of the government, has no share of the power.
Under what pretext would any individual of that
order assume authority in public affairs? As men
are commonly much attached to their ancient govern∣ment,
it is not to be expected, that the public would
ever favour such usurpations. But where the original
constitution allows any share of power, tho' small, to
an order of men, who possess a large share of the
property, 'tis easy for them gradually to stretch their
authority, and bring the balance of power to coin∣cide
with that of property. This has been the case
with the house of commons in ENGLAND.</P>
<P>MOST writers, who have treated of the BRITISH
government, have supposed, that as the house of com∣mons
represents all the commons of GREAT BRI∣TAIN;
so its weight in the scale is proportioned
to the property and power of all whom it represents.
But this principle must not be received as absolutely
true. For tho' the people are apt to attach themselves
more to the house of commons, than to any other
member of the constitution; that house being chosen
by them as their representatives, and as the public
guardians of their liberty; yet are there instances
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
where the house, even when in opposition to the
crown, has not been followed by the people; as we
may particularly observe of the <HI>tory</HI> house of com∣mons
in the reign of king WILLIAM. Were the
members of the house obliged to receive instructions
from their constituents, like the DUTCH deputies,
this would entirely alter the case; and, if such im∣mense
power and riches, as those of the whole com∣mons
of BRITAIN, were brought into the scale, 'tis
not easy to conceive, that the crown could either in∣fluence
that multitude of people, or withstand that
overbalance of propety▪ 'Tis true, the crown has
great influence over the collective body of BRITAIN
in the elections of members; but were this influence
which at present is only exerted once in seven years,
to be employed in bringing over the people to every
vote, it would soon be wasted; and no skill, popu∣larity
or revenue, could support it. I must, there∣fore,
be of opinion, that an alterations, in this parti∣cular,
would introduce a total alteration in our go∣vernment,
and would soon reduce it to a pure repub∣lic;
and, perhaps, to a republic of no inconvenient
form. For tho' the people collected in a body like
the ROMAN tribes, be quite unfit for government, yet
when dispersed in small bodies, they are more suscep∣tible
both of reason and order; the force of popular
currents and tides is, in a great measure, broke; and
the public interest may be pursued with some method
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
and constancy. But 'tis needless to reason any farther
concerning a form of government, which is never
likely to have place in BRITAIN, and which seems
not to be the aim of any party amongst us. Let us
cherish and improve our ancient government as much
as possible, without encouraging a passion for such
dangerous novelties.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this subject with observing, that
the present political controversy, with regard to <HI>in∣structions,</HI>
is a very frivolous one, and can never be
brought to any decision, as it is managed by both
parties. The country party pretend not, that a mem∣ber
is absolutely bound to follow instructions, as an
ambassador or general is confined by his orders, and
that his vote is not to be received in the house, but
so far as it is conformable to them. The court∣party
again, pretend not, that the sentiments of the
people ought to have no weight with each member;
much less that he ought to despise the sentiments of
those he represents, and with whom he is more par∣ticularly
connected. And if their sentiments be of
weight, why ought they not to express these senti∣ments?
The question, then, is only concerning the
degrees of weight which ought to be placed on in∣structions.
But such is the nature of language, that
'tis impossible for it to express distinctly these different
degrees; and if men will carry on a controversy on
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
this head, it may well happen, that they differ in
their language, and yet agree in their sentiments; or
differ in their sentiments, and yet agree in their lan∣guage.
Besides, how is it possible to fix these degrees,
considering the variety of affairs which come before
the house, and the variety of places which members
represent? Ought the instructions of TOTNESS to
have the same weight with those of LONDON? or in∣structions,
with regard to the <HI>Convention,</HI> which re∣spected
foreign politics, to have the same weight as
those with regard to the <HI>excise,</HI> which respected only
our domestic affairs?</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of LOVE and MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>I KNOW not whence it proceeds, that women
are so apt to take amiss every thing which is said
in disparagement of the married state; and always
consider a satyr upon matrimony as a satyr upon
themselves. Do they mean, that they are the parties
principally concerned, and that if a backwardness to
enter into that state should prevail in the world, they
would be the greatest sufferers? Or, are they sensible,
that the misfortunes and miscarriages of the married
state are owing more to their sex than to ours? I
hope they do not intend to confess either of these two
particulars, or to give such an advantage to their ad∣versaries,
the men, as even to allow them to suspect
it.</P>
<P>I HAVE often had thoughts of complying with this
humour of the fair sex, and of writing a panegyric
upon marriage: But, in looking around for mate∣rials,
they seemed to be of so mixed a nature, that at
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
the conclusion of my reflections, I found that I was as
much disposed to write a satyr, which might be pla∣ced
on the opposite pages of the panegyric: And I
am afraid, that as satyr is, on most occasions, thought
to contain more truth than panegyric, I should have
done their cause more harm than good by this expe∣dient.
To misrepresent facts is what, I know, they
will not require of me. I must be more a friend to
truth, than even to them, where their interests are
opposite.</P>
<P>I SHALL tell the women what it is our sex com∣plains
of most in the married state; and if they be
disposed to satisfy us in this particular, all the other
differences will easily be accommodated. If I be not
mistaken, 'tis their love of dominion, which is the
ground of the quarrel; tho' 'tis very likely, that they
will think it an unreasonable love of it in us, which
makes us insist so much upon that point <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ However
this may be, no passion seems to have more influence
on female minds, than this for power; and there is a
remarkable instance in history of its prevailing above
another passion, which is the only one that can be
supposed a proper counterpoise for it. We are told
that all the women in SCYTHIA once conspired against
the men, and kept the secret so well, that they exe∣cuted
their design before they were suspected. They
surprised the men in drink, or asleep; bound them
all fast in chains; and having called a solemn coun∣cil
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
of the whole sex, it was debated what expedient
should be used to improve the present advantage, and
prevent their falling again into slavery. To kill all
the men did not seem to the relish of any part of the
assembly, notwithstanding the injuries formerly re∣ceived;
and they were afterwards pleased to make a
great merit of this lenity of theirs. It was, therefore,
agreed to put out the eyes of the whole male sex, and
thereby resign in all future time the vanity which
they could draw from their beauty, in order to secure
their authority. We must no longer pretend to dress
and show, say they; but then we shall be free from
slavery. We shall hear no more tender sighs; but in
return we shall hear no more imperious commands.
Love must for ever leave us; but he will carry sub∣jection
along with him.</P>
<P>'TIS regarded by some as an unlucky circumstance,
since▪ the women were resolved to maim the men, and
deprive them of some of their senses, in order to ren∣der
them humble and dependent, that the sense of
hearing could not serve their purpose, since 'tis pro∣bable
the females would rather have attacked that
than the sight: And I think it is agreed among the
learned, that, in a married state, 'tis not near so great
an inconvenience to lose the former sense as the latter.
However this may be, we are told by modern anec∣dotes,
that some of the SCYTHIAN women did se∣cretly
spare their husband's eyes; presuming, I sup∣pose,
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
that they could govern them as well by means
of that sense as without it. But so incorrigible and
untractable were these men, that their wives were all
obliged, in a few years, as their youth and beauty de∣cayed,
to imitate the example of their sisters; which
it was no difficult matter to do in a state where the
female sex had once got the superiority.</P>
<P>I KNOW not if our SCOTTISH ladies derive any
thing of this humour from their SCYTHIAN ances∣tors;
but, I must confess that I have often been sur∣prized
to see a woman very well pleased to take a fool
for her mate, that she might govern with the less con∣troul;
and could not but think her sentiments, in this
respect, still more barbarous than those of the SCY∣THIAN
women above-mentioned; as much as the
eyes of the understanding are more valuable than
those of the body.</P>
<P>BUT to be just, and to lay the blame more equally,
I am afraid it is the fault of our sex, if the women be
so fond of rule, and that if we did not abuse our au∣thority,
they would never think it worth while to
dispute it. Tyrants, we know, produce rebels; and
all history informs us, that rebels, when they prevail,
are apt to become tyrants in their turn. For this rea∣son,
I could wish there were no pretensions to autho∣rity
on either side; but that every thing was carried
on with perfect equality, as between two equal mem∣bers
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
of the same body. And to induce both parties
to embrace those amicable sentiments, I shall deliver
to them PLATO's account of the origin of love and
marriage.</P>
<P>MANKIND, according to that fanciful philosopher,
were not, in their original, divided into male and fe∣male,
as at present; but each individual person was
a compound of both sexes, and was in himself both
husband and wife, melted down into one living crea∣ture.
This union, no doubt, was very intire, and the
parts very well adjusted together, since there resulted
a perfect harmony betwixt the male and female, al∣tho'
they were obliged to be inseparable companions.
And so great were the harmony and happiness flowing
from it, that the ANDROGYNES (for so PLATO calls
them) or MEN-WOMEN, became insolent upon their
prosperity, and rebelled against the Gods. To pu∣nish
them for this temerity, JUPITER could contrive
no better expedient, than to divorce the male-part
from the female, and make two imperfect beings of
the compound, which was before so perfect. Hence
the origin of men and women, as distinct creatures.
But notwithstanding this division, so lively is our re∣membrance
of the happiness which we enjoyed in
our primaeval state, that we are never at rest in this
situation; but each of these halves is continually
searching thro' the whole species to find the other
half, which was broken from it: And when they
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
meet, they join again with the greatest fondness and
sympathy. But it often happens, that they are mis∣taken
in this particular; that they take for their half
what no way corresponds to them; and that the parts
do not meet nor join in with each other, as is usual
in fractures. In this case the union was soon dissol∣ved,
and each part is set loose again to hunt for its
lost half, joining itself to every one whom it meets,
by way of trial, and enjoying no rest till its perfect
sympathy with its partner shews, that it has at last
been successful in its endeavours.</P>
<P>WERE I disposed to carry on this fiction of PLA∣TO,
which accounts for the mutual love betwixt the
sexes in so agreeable a manner, I would do it by the
following allegory.</P>
<P>WHEN JUPITER had separated the male from the
female, and had quelled their pride and ambition by
so severe an operation, he could not but repent him
of the cruelty of his vengeance, and take compassion
on poor mortals, who were now become incapable of
any repose or tranquillity. Such cravings, such anxi∣eties,
such necessities arose, as made them curse their
creation, and think existence itself a punishment.
In vain had they recourse to every other occupation
and amusement. In vain did they seek after every
pleasure of sense, and every refinement of reason.
Nothing could fill that void, which they felt in their
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
hearts, or supply the loss of their partner, who was so
fatally separated from them. To remedy this disor∣der,
and to bestow some comfort, at least, on the hu∣man
race in their forlorn situation, JUPITER sent
down LOVE and HYMEN to collect the broken halves
of human kind, and piece them together in the best
manner possible. These two deities found such a
prompt disposition in mankind to unite again in their
primaeval state, that they proceeded on their work
with wonderful success for some time; till at last,
from many unlucky accidents, dissension arose be∣twixt
them. The chief counsellor and favourite of
HYMEN was CARE, who was continually filling his
patron's head with prospects of futurity; a settle∣ment,
family, children, servants; so that little else
was regarded in all the matches <HI>they</HI> made. On the
other hand, <HI>Love</HI> had chosen PLEASURE for his fa∣vourite,
who was as pernicious a counsellor as the
other, and would never allow <HI>Love</HI> to look beyond
the present momentary gratification, or the stisfying
of the prevailing inclination. These two favourites
became, in a little time, irreconcileable enemies, and
made it their chief business to undermine each other
in all their undertaking. No sooner had <HI>Love</HI> fixed
upon two halves, which he was cementing together,
and forming to a close union, but <HI>Care</HI> insinuates him∣self,
and bringing HYMEN along with him, dissolves
the union produced by love, and joins each half to
some other half, which he had provided for it. To
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
be revenged of this, <HI>Pleasure</HI> creeps in upon a pair
already joined by HYMEN; and calling <HI>Love</HI> to his
assistance, they under hand contrive to join each half
by secret links, to halves, which HYMEN was wholly
u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acquainted with. It was not long before this
quarrel was felt in its pernicious consequences; and
such complaints arose before the throne of JUPITER,
that he was obliged to summon the offending parties
to appear before him, in order to give an account of
their proceedings. After hearing the pleadings on
both sides, he ordered an immediate reconcilement
betwixt <HI>Love</HI> and HYMEN, as the only expedient for
giving happiness to mankind: And that he might
be sure this reconcilement should be durable, he laid
his strict injunctions on them never to join any halves
without consulting their favourites <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI>
and obtaining the consent of both to the conjunction.
Where this order is strictly observed, the <HI>Androgyne</HI> is
perfectly restored, and the human race enjoy the same
happiness as in their primaeval state. The seam is
scarce perceived that joins the two beings; but both
of them combine to form one perfect and happy
creature.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the STUDY of HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing which I would recommend
more earnestly to my female readers than the
study of history, as an occupation, of all others, the
best suited both to their sex and education, much
more instructive than their ordinary books of amuse∣ment,
and more entertaining than those serious com∣positions,
which are usually to be found in their clo∣sets.
Among other important truths, which they
may learn from history, they may be informed of
two particulars, the knowledge of which may contri∣bute
very much to their quiet and repose; <HI>That</HI> our
sex, as well as theirs, are far from being such perfect
creatures as they are apt to imagine, and, <HI>That</HI> Love
is not the only passion, which governs the male-world,
but is often overcome by avarice, ambition, vanity,
and a thousand other passions. Whether they be the
false representations of mankind in those two parti∣culars,
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
which endear romances and novels so much to
the fair sex, I know not; but must confess that I am
sorry to see them have such an aversion to matter of
fact, and such an appetite for falshood. I remember I
was once desired by a young beauty, for whom I had
some passion, to send her some novels and romances
for her amusement in the country; but was not so un∣generous
as to take the advantage, which such a
course of reading might have given me, being resol∣ved
not to make use of poisoned arms against her. I
therefore sent her PLUTARCH'S lives, assuring her, at
the same time, that there was not a word of truth in
them from beginning to end. She perused them very
attentively, 'till she came to the lives of ALEXANDER
and CAESAR, whose names she had heard of by acci∣dent;
and then returned me the book, with many
reproaches for deceiving her.</P>
<P>I MAY indeed be told, that the fair sex have no
such aversion to history, as I have represented, provi∣ded
it be <HI>secret</HI> history, and contain some memorable
transaction proper to excite their curiosity. But as I
do not find that truth, which is the basis of history, is
at all regarded in those anecdotes, I cannot admit of
this as a proof of their passion for that study. How∣ever
this may be, I see not why the same curiosity
might not receive a more proper direction, and lead
them to defire accounts of those who lived in past ages,
as well as of their cotemporaries. What is it to CLE∣ORA,
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
whether FULVIA entertains a secret commerce
of <HI>Love</HI> with PHILANDER or not? Has she not
equal reason to be pleased, when she is informed
(what is whispered about among historians) that
CATO'S sister had an intrigue with CAESAR, and
palmed her son, MARCUS BRUTUS, upon her hus∣band
for his own, tho' in reality he was her gallant's?
And are not the loves of MESSALINA or JULIA as
proper subjects of discourse as any intrigue that this
city has produced of late years?</P>
<P>BUT I know not whence it comes, that I have been
thus seduced into a kind of raillery against the ladies:
Unless, perhaps, it proceed from the same cause,
which makes the person, who is the favourite of the
company, be often the object of their good-natured
jests and pleasantries. We are pleased to address our∣selves
after any manner, to one who is agreeable to
us; and, at the same time, presume, that nothing
will be taken amiss by a person, who is secure of the
good opinion and affections of every one present. I
shall now proceed to handle my subject more seri∣ously,
and shall point out the many advantages, which
flow from the study of history, and show how well
suited it is to every one, but particularly to those who
are debarred the severer studies, by the tenderness of
their complexion, and the weakness of their edu∣cation.
The advantages found in history seem to be
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
of three kinds, as it amuses the fancy, as it improves
the understanding, and as it strengthens virtue.</P>
<P>IN reality, what more agreeable entertainment to
the mind, than to be transported into the remotest
ages of the world, and to observe human society, in
its infancy, making the first faint essays towards the
arts and sciences: To see the policy of government,
and the civility of conversation refining by degrees,
and every thing which is ornamental to human life
advancing towards its perfection. To remark the
rise, progress, declension, and final extinction of the
most flourishing empires: The virtues, which con∣tributed
to their greatness, and the vices, which drew
on their ruin. In short, to see all human race, from
the beginning of time, pass, as it were, in review be∣fore
us; appearing in their true colours, without any
of those disguises, which, during their life-time, so
much perplexed the judgment of the beholders. What
spectacle can be imagined, so magnificent, so various,
so interesting? What amusement, either of the senses
or imagination, can be compared with it? Shall those
trifling pastimes, which engross so much of our time,
be preferred as more satisfactory, and more fit to en∣gage
our attention? How perverse must that taste be,
which is capable of so wrong a choice of pleasures?</P>
<P>BUT history is a most improving part of know∣ledge,
as well as an agreeable amusement; and a
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
great part of what we commonly call <HI>Erudition,</HI> and
value so highly, is nothing but an acquaintance with
historical facts. An extensive knowledge of this
kind belongs to men of letters; but I must think it
an unpardonable ignorance in persons of whatever
sex or condition, not to be acquainted with the his∣tory
of their own country, together with the histories
of ancient GREECE and ROME. A woman may be∣have
herself with good manners, and have even some
vivacity in her turn of wit; but where her mind is so
unfurnished, 'tis impossible her conversation can af∣ford
any entertainment to men of sense and reflection.</P>
<P>I MUST add, that history is not only a valuable
part of knowledge, but opens the door to many
other parts, and affords materials to most of the sci∣ences.
And indeed, if we consider the shortness of
human life, and our limited knowledge, even of what
passes in our own time, we must be sensible that we
should be for ever children in understanding, were it
not for this invention, which extends our experience
to all past ages, and to the most distant nations; mak∣ing
them contribute as much to our improvement in
wisdom, as if they had actually lain under our ob∣servation.
A man acquainted with history may, in
some respect, be said to have lived from the begin∣ning
of the world, and to have been making conti∣nual
additions to his stock of knowledge in every
century.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70"/>
THERE is also an advantage in that experience
which is acquired by history, above what is learned
by the practice of the world, that it brings us ac∣quainted
with human affairs, without diminishing in
the least from the most delicate sentiments of virtue.
And, to tell the truth, I know not any study or occu∣pation
so unexceptionable as history in this particular.
Poets can paint virtue in the most charming colours;
but, as they address themselves entirely to the pas∣sions,
they often become advocates for vice. Even
philosophers are apt to bewilder themselves in the
subtilty of their speculations; and we have seen some
go so far as to deny the reality of all moral distinc∣tions.
But I think it a remark worthy the attention
of the speculative, that the historians have been, al∣most
without exception, the true friends of virtue, and
have always represented it in its proper colours, how∣ever
they may have erred in their judgments of par∣ticular
persons. MACHIAVEL himself discovers a
true sentiment of virtue in his history of FLORENCE.
When he talks as a <HI>Politician,</HI> in his general reason∣ings,
he considers poisoning, assassination and perjury,
as lawful arts of power; but when he speaks as an
<HI>Historian,</HI> in his particular narrations, he shows so
keen an indignation against vice, and so warm an ap∣probation
of virtue, in many passages, that I could
not forbear applying to him that remark of HORACE,
That if you chace away nature, tho' with ever so
great indignity, she will always return upon you.
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
Nor is this combination of historians in favour of vir∣tue
at all difficult to be accounted for. When a man
of business enters into life and action, he is more apt
to consider the characters of men, as they have rela∣tion
to his interest, than as they stand in themselves;
and has his judgment warped on every occasion by
the violence of his passion. When a philosopher con∣templates
characters and manners in his closet, the
general abstract view of the objects leaves the mind
so cold and unmoved, that the sentiments of nature
have no room to play, and he scarce feels the differ∣ence
between vice and virtue. History keeps in a
just medium betwixt these extremes, and places the
objects in their true point of view. The writers of
history, as well as the readers, are sufficiently interest∣ed
in the characters and events, to have a lively sen∣timent
of blame or praise; and, at the same time,
have no particular interest or concern to pervert their
judgment.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the INDEPENDENCY of PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE frequently observed, in comparing the
conduct of the <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country</HI> parties, that the
former are commonly less assuming and dogmatical
in conversation, more apt to make concessions; and
tho' not, perhaps, more susceptible of conviction, yet
more able to bear contradiction than the latter; who
are apt to fly out upon any opposition, and to regard
one as a mercenary designing fellow, if he argues
with any coolness and impartiality, or makes any
concessions to their adversaries. This is a fact, which,
I believe, every one may have observed, who has been
much in companies where political questions have
been discussed; tho' were one to ask the reason of
this difference, every party would be apt to assign a
different one. Gentlemen in the <HI>Opposition</HI> will as∣cribe
it to the very nature of their party, which,
being founded on public spirit, and a zeal for the
constitution, cannot easily endure such doctrines, as
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
are of pernicious consequence to liberty. The cour∣tiers,
on the other hand, will be apt to put us in
mind of the clown mentioned by lord SHAFTSBURY.
“A Clown, says that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Miscellaneous Reflections, p. 107.</NOTE> excellent author, once took
a fancy to hear the <HI>Latin</HI> disputes of doctors at
an university. He was asked what pleasure he
could take in viewing such combatants, when he
could never know so much, as which of the parties
had the better. <HI>For that matter,</HI> replied the clown,
<HI>I a'n't such a fool neither, but I can see who's the
first that puts t'other into a passion.</HI> Nature herself
dictated this lesson to the clown, that he who had
the better of the argument would be easy and well-humoured:
But he who was unable to support his
cause by reason, would naturally lose his temper,
and grow violent.”</P>
<P>To which of these reasons shall we adhere? To
neither of them, in my opinion; unless we have a
mind to inlist ourselves, and become zealots in either
party. I believe I can assign the reason of this dif∣ferent
conduct of the two parties, without offend∣ing
either. The country party are plainly most po∣pular
at present, and, perhaps, have been so in most
administrations: So that, being accustomed to pre∣vail
in company, they cannot endure to hear their
opinions controverted, but are as confident on the
public favour, as if they were supported in all their
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
sentiments by the most infallible demonsration. The
courtiers, on the other hand, are commonly so run
down by popular talkers, that if you speak to them
with any moderation, or make them the smallest con∣cessions,
they think themselves extremely beholden to
you, and are apt to return the favour by a like mo∣deration
and facility on their part. To be furious
and passionate, they know, would only gain them
the character of <HI>shameless mercenaries;</HI> not that of
<HI>zealous patriots,</HI> which is the character that such a warm
behaviour is apt to acquire to the other party.</P>
<P>IN all controversies, we find, without regarding
the truth or falshood on either side, that those who
defend the established and popular opinions, are al∣ways
the most dogmatical and imperious in their
stile: While their adversaries affect a most extraor∣dinary
gentleness and moderation, in order to soften,
as much as possible, any prejudices that may lye a∣gainst
them. Consider the behaviour of our <HI>free∣thinkers</HI>
of all denominations, whether they be such
as decry all revelation, or only oppose the exorbi∣tant
power of the clergy; COLLINS, TINDAL, FOS∣TER,
HOADLEY. Compare their moderation and
good-manners, with the zeal and even scurrility of
their adversaries, and you will be convinced of the
truth of my observation. A like difference may be
observed in the conduct of those FRENCH writers,
who maintained the controversy with regard to an∣cient
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
and modern learning. BOILEAU, <HI>Monstieur &amp;
Madame</HI> DACIER, <HI>l'Abbe de</HI> Bos, who defended the
party of the ancients, mixed their reasonings with
satyre and invective: While FONTENELLE, <HI>la</HI> MOT∣TE,
CHARPENTIER, and even PERRAULT never
transgressed the bounds of moderation and good-breed∣ing;
tho' provoked by the most severe railleries of
their adversaries.</P>
<P>I AM led into this train of reflection, by consder∣ing
some papers wrote upon the grand topic of <HI>court∣influence,
and parliamentary dependence,</HI> where, in my
humble opinion, the country party, besides vehemence
and satye, shew too rigid an inflexibility, and too
great a jealousy of makinig concessions to their ad∣versries.
Their reasonings lose their force, by be∣ing
carried too far; and the popularity of their opi∣nions
has seduced them to neglect, in some measure,
their justness and solidity. The following reasoning
will, I hope, serve to justify me in this opinion.</P>
<P>POLITICAL writers have established it as a maxim,
That in contriving any system of government, and
and fixing the several checks and controuls of the
constitution, every man ought to be supposed a <HI>knave,</HI>
and to have no other end, in all his actions, but pri∣vate
interest. By this interest we must govern him,
and, by means of it, make him co-operate to public
good, notwithstanding his insatiable avarice and am∣bition.
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
Without this, say they, we shall in vain boast
of the advantages of any constitution, and shall find,
in the end, that we have no security for our liberties
or possessions, except the good-will of our rulers;
that is, we shall have no security at all.</P>
<P>'TIS therefore a just <HI>political</HI> maxim, <HI>That every
man must be supposed a knave:</HI> Tho' at the same time,
it appears somewhat strange, that a maxim should be
true in <HI>politics,</HI> which is false in <HI>fact.</HI> But to satisfy
us on this head, we may consider, that men are ge∣nerally
more honest in their private than in their
public character, and will go greater lengths to serve
a party, than when their own private interest is a∣lone
concerned. Honour is a great check upon man∣kind:
But where a considerable body of men act to∣gether,
this check is, in a great measure, removed;
since a man is sure to be approved of by his own
party, for what promotes the common interest, and
he soon learns to despise the clamours of his adver∣saries.
To which we may add, that every court or
senate is determined by the majority; so that, if self-interest
influences only the majority, (as it will always
do) the whole senate follows the allurements of this
separate interest, and acts as if it contained not one
member, who had any regard to public interest and
liberty.</P>
<P>WHEN there offers, therefore, to our censure, and
examination, any plan of government, real or ima∣ginary,
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
where the power is distributed among several
courts, and several orders of men, we should always
consider the private interest of each court, and each
order; and, if we find, that, by the skilful division
of the power, the private interest must necessarily,
in its operation, concur with the public, we may pro∣nounce
that government to be wise and happy. If,
on the contrary, the private interest of each order
be not checked, and be not directed to public inte∣terest,
we ought to look for nothing but faction,
disorder, and tyranny from such a government. In
this opinion I am justified by experience, as well as
by the authority of all philosophers and politicians
both antient and modern.</P>
<P>How much, therefore, would it have surprized
such a genius as CICERO, or TACITUS, to have been
told, That, in a future age, there should arife a very
regular system of <HI>mixt</HI> government, where the autho∣rity
was so distributed, that one rank, whenever it
pleased, might swallow up all the rest, and engross
the whole power of the constitution. Such a govern∣ment,
they would say, will not be a mixed government.
For so great is the natural ambition of men, that they
are never satisfied with power; and if one order of
men, by pursuing its own interest, can usurp upon
every other order, it will certainly do so, and render
itself, as far as possible, absolute and uncontroulable.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78"/>
BUT, in this opinion, experience shews they would
have been mistaken. For this is actually the case
with the BRITISH constitution. The share of power
allotted by our constitution to the house of commons
is so great, that it absolutely commands all the other
parts of the government. The king's legislative
power is plainly no proper check to it. For tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the king has a negative in the passing of laws; yet
this, in fact, is esteemed of so little moment, that
whatever is voted by the two houses, is always sure
to be passed into a law, and the royal assent is little
better than a mere form. The principal weight of
the crown lies in the executive power. But besides
that the executive power, in every government, is
altogether subordinate to the legislative; besides this,
I say, the exercise of this power requires an immense
expence, and the commons have assumed to them∣selves
the sole power of disposing of public money.
How easy, therefore, would it be for that house to
wrest from the crown all these powers, one after
another, by making every grant of money condi∣tional,
and choosing their time so well, that their
refusal of subsidies should only distress the govern∣ment,
without giving foreign powers any advantage
over us? Did the house of commons depend in the
same manner on the king, and had none of the mem∣bers
any property but from his gift, would not he
command all their resolutions, and be from that mo∣ment
absolute? As to the house of lords, they are
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
a very powerful support to the crown so long as
they are, in their turn, supported by it; but both
experience and reason shew us, that they have no
force nor authority sufficient to maintain themselves
alone, without such support.</P>
<P>How, therefore, shall we solve this paradox? And
by what means is this members of our constitution
confined within the proper limits; since, from our
very constitution, it must necessarily have as much
power as it demands, and can only be confined it∣self?
How is this consistent with our experience of
human nature? I answer, That the interest of the
body is here restrained by the interest of the by
individuals, and that the house of commons stretches
not its power, because such an usurpation would be
contrary to the interest of the majority of its mem∣bers.
The crown has so many offices at its dispo∣sal,
that, when assisted by the honest and disinterest∣ed
part of the house, it will always command the
resolutions of the whole; so far at least, as to pre∣serve
the ancient constitution from danger. We may,
therefore, give to this influence what name we please;
we may call it by the invidious appellations of <HI>cor∣ruption</HI>
and <HI>dependence;</HI> but some degree and some
kind of it are inseparable from the very nature of
the constitution, and necessary to the preservation of
our mixed government.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80"/>
INSTEAD then of asserting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Dissertation on Parties,</HI> throughout.</NOTE> absolutely, that the
dependence of parliament, in every degree, is an
infringement of BRITISH liberty, the country-party
had better have made some concessions to their ad∣versaries,
and have only examined what was the pro∣per
degree of this dependence, beyond which it be∣came
dangerous to liberty. But such a moderation
is not to be expected of party-men of any kind.
After a concession of this nature, all declamation must
be abandoned; and a serious calm enquiry into the
proper degree of court influence, and parliamentary
dependence would have been expected by the rea∣ders.
And tho' the advantage, in such a contro∣versy,
might possibly remain to the <HI>country-party;</HI>
yet the victory would not be so compleat as they
wish for, nor would a true patriot have given an en∣tire
loose to his zeal, for fear of running matters
into a contrary extreme, by diminishing too<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">By that <HI>influence of the crown,</HI> which I would justify, I mean only, that arising from the offices and honours which are at the disposal of the crown. As to private <HI>bribery,</HI> it may be considered in the same light as the practice of employing spies, which is scarce justifiable in a good minister, and is in∣famous in a bad one: But to be a spy, or to be corrupted, is always infamous under all ministries, and is to be regarded as a shameless prostitution. POLYBIUS justly esteems the pe∣cuniary influence of the senate and censors to be one of the regular and constitutional weights, which preserved the balance of the ROMAN government.

<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
influence of the crown. It was, therefore, thought
best to deny, that this extreme could ever be dan∣gerous
to the constitution, or that the crown could
ever have too little influence over members of par∣liament.</P>
<P>ALL questions concerning the proper medium be∣tween
any two extremes are very difficult to be de∣cided;
both because it is difficult to find <HI>words</HI> pro∣per
to fix this medium, and because the good and
ill, in such cases, run so gradually into each other,
as even to render our <HI>sentiments</HI> doubtful and un∣certain.
But there is a peculiar difficulty in the pre∣sent
case, which would embarrass the most knowing
and most impartial examiner. The power of the
crown is always lodged in a single person, either
king or minister; and as this person may have ei∣ther
a greater or less degree of ambition, capacity,
courage, popularity or fortune, the power, which is
too great in one hand, may become too little in
another. In pure republics, where the power is
distributed among several assemblies or senates, the
checks and controuls are more regular in their ope∣ration;
because the members of such numerous as∣semblies
may be presumed to be always nearly equal
in capacity and virtue; and 'tis only their number,
riches, or authority, which enter into consideration.
But a limited monarchy admits not of any such sta∣bility;
nor is it possible to assign to the crown
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
such a determinate degree of power, as will, in every
hand, form a proper counter-balance to the other
parts of the constitution. This is an unavoidable dis∣advantage,

that species of government.</P>

be denied; but yet the general maxim, <HI>That the
balance of one depends on the balance of the other,</HI> must
be received with several limitations. 'Tis evident,
that much less property in a single hand will be able
to counter-balance a greater property in several hands;
not only because it is difficult to make many persons
combine in the same views and measures; but also be∣cause
property, when united, causes much greater de∣pendance,
than the same property, when dispersed. An
hundred persons, of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a year a-piece, can consume
all their income, and no body shall ever be the better
for them, except their servants and tradesmen, who
justly regard their profits as the product of their own
labour. But a man possessed of 100,000<HI>l.</HI> a year,
if he has either any generosity, or any cunning, may
create a great dependance by obligations, and still a
<PB N="85" REF="85"/>
greater by expectations. Hence we may observe, that
in all free governments any subject exorbitantly rich
has always created a jealousy, even tho' his riches
bore no manner of proportion to the riches of the
state, CRASSUS'S fortune, if I remember well, a∣mounted
only to about<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As interest in ROME was higher than with us, this might yield above 100,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year.</NOTE> sixteen hundred thousand
pounds in our money; and yet we find, that, tho' his
genius was nothing extraordinary, he was able, by
means of his riches alone, to counter-balance, during
his life-time, the power of POMPEY as well as that
of CAESAR, who afterwards became master of the
world. The wealth of the MEDICIS made them
masters of FLORENCE; tho', 'tis probable, it was
very inconsiderable, compared to the united proper∣ty
of that opulent republic.</P>
<P>THESE considerations are apt to make one enter∣tain
a very magnificent idea of the BRITISH spirit
and love of liberty; since we could maintain our free
government, during so many centuries, against our
sovereigns, who, besides the power and dignity and
majesty of the crown, have always been possessed of
much more property than any subject has ever en∣joyed
in any commonwealth. But it may be said,
that this spirit, however great, will never be able to
support itself against that immense property, which is
<PB N="86" REF="86"/>
now lodged in the king, and which is still increasing.
Upon a moderate computation, there are near three
millions at the disposal of the crown. 'The civil list
amounts to near a million; the collection of all taxes
to another million; and the employments in the army
and navy, together with ecclesiastical preferments, to
above a third million: An enormous sum, and what
may fairly be computed to be more than a thirtieth
part of the whole income and labour of the king∣dom.
When we add to this immense property, the
increasing luxury of the nation, our proneness to cor∣ruption,
together with the great power and preroga∣tives
of the crown, and the command of such nume∣rous
military forces, there is no one but must despair
of being able, without extraordinary efforts, to sup∣port
our free government much longer under all these
disadvantages.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, those who maintain, that the
byass of the BRITISH government leans towards a re∣public,
may support their opinion by very specious
arguments. It may be said, that tho' this immense
property in the crown, be joined to the dignity of first
magistrate, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to many other legal powers and pre∣rogatives,
which should naturally give it a greater in∣fluence;
yet it really becomes less dangerous to li∣berty
upon that very account. Were BRITAIN a re∣public,
and were any private man possessed of a reve∣nue,
a third, or even a tenth part as large as that of
<PB N="87" REF="87"/>
the crown, he would very justly excite jealousy; be∣cause
he would infallibly have great authority in the
government: And such an irregular authority, not
avowed by the laws, is always more dangerous than
a much greater authority, which is derived from them.
A<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On ne monte jamais si <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aut que quand on ne sçait pas ou on va, said CROMWELL to the president DE BELLIIVRE. DE RETZ'S Memoirs.</NOTE> man possessed of usurped power, can set no
bounds to his pretensions: His partizans have liberty
to hope for every thing in his favour: His enemies
provoke his ambition, with his fears, by the violence
of their opposition: And the government being
thrown into a ferment, every corrupted humour in
the state naturally gathers to him. On the contrary,
a legal authority, tho' very great, has always some
bounds, which terminate both the hopes and preten∣sions
of the person possessed of it: The laws must
have provided a remedy against its excesses: Such an
eminent magistrate has much to fear, and little to
hope from his usurpations: And as his legal autho∣rity
is quietly submitted to, he has small temptation
and small opportunity of extending it farther. Be∣sides,
it happens, with regard to ambitious aims and
projects, what may be observed with regard to sects
of philosophy and religion. A new sect excites such
a ferment, and is both opposed and defended with
such vehemence, that it spreads always faster, and
<PB N="88" REF="88"/>
multiplies its partizans with greater rapidity, than
any old established opinion, recommended by the
sanction of the laws and of antiquity. Such is the
nature of novelty, that where any thing pleases it
becomes doubly agreeable, if new; but if it dis∣pleases,
it is doubly displeasing, upon that very ac∣count.
And, in most cases, the violence of enemies
is favourable to ambitious projects, as well as the zeal
of partizans.</P>
<P>IT may farther be said, that tho' men be very
much governed by interest; yet even interest itself,
and all human affairs are entirely governed by <HI>opinion.</HI>
Now, there has been a very sudden and a very sen∣sible
change in the opinions of men within these last
fifty years by the progress of learning and of liberty.
Most people, in this island, have divested themselves
of all superstitious reverence to names and authority:
The clergy have much lost their credit: Their pre∣tensions
and doctrines have been ridiculed; and even
religion can scarce support itself in the world. The
mere name of <HI>king</HI> commands little respect; and to
talk of a king as GOD's vicegerent on earth, or to
give him any of those magnificent titles, which for∣merly
dazzled mankind, would but excite laughter in
every one. Tho' the crown, by means of its large
revenue, may maintain its authority in times of tran∣quility,
upon private interest and influence; yet as
the least shock or convulsion must break all these in∣terests
<PB N="89" REF="89"/>
to pieces, the kingly power, being no longer
supported by the settled principles and opinions of
men, will immediately dissolve. Had men been in
the same disposition at the <HI>revolution,</HI> as they are at
present, monarchy would have run a great risque of
being entirely lost in this island.</P>
<P>DURST I venture to deliver my own sentiments
amidst these opposite arguments, I would assert, that
unless there happen some extraordinary convulsion, the
power of the crown, by means of its large revenue, is
rather upon the increase; tho', at the same time I own,
that its progress seems very slow, and almost insen∣sible.
The tide had run long, and with some rapi∣dity,
to the side of popular government, and is just
beginning to turn towards monarchy.</P>
<P>'TIS well known that every government must come
to a period, and that death is unavoidable to the po∣litical
as well as to the animal body. But, as one
kind of death may be preferable to another, it may
be enquired, whether it be more desirable for the
BRITISH constitution to terminate in a popular go∣vernment,
or in absolute monarchy? Here I would
declare frankly, that tho' liberty be infinitely prefer∣able
to slavery, in almost every case; yet I should
much rather wish to see an absolute monarch than a
republic in this island. For, let us consider, what
kind of republic we have reason to expect. The
<PB N="90" REF="90"/>
question is not concerning any fine imaginary repub∣lic,
of which a man may form a plan in his close<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
There is no doubt, but a popular government may
be imagined more perfect than absolute monarchy, or
even than our present constitution. But what reason
have we to expect that any such government will
ever be established in BRITAIN, upon the dissolution
of our monarchy? If any single person acquire
power enought to take our constitution to pieces, and
put it up a-new, he is really an absolute monarch;
and we have had already an instance of this kind,
sufficient to convince us, that such a person will never
resign his power, or establish any free government.
Matters, therefore, must be trusted to their natural
progress and operation; and the house of commons,
according to its present constitution, must be the only
legislature in such a popular government. The in∣conveniencies,
attending such a situation of affairs,
present themselves by thousands. If the house of
commons, in such a case, ever dissolves itself, which
is not to be expected, we may look for a civil war
every election. If it continues itself, we shall suffer
all the tyranny of a faction, subdivided into new fac∣tions.
And as such a violent government cannot long
subsist, we shall, at last, after infinite convulsions, and
civil wars, find repose in absolute monarchy, which
it would have been happier for us to have established
peaceably from the beginning. Absolute monarchy,
<PB N="91" REF="91"/>
therefore, is the easiest death, the true <HI>Euthanasia</HI> of
the BRITISH constitution.</P>
<P>THUS, if we have reason to be more jealous of
monarchy, because the danger is more imminent from
that quarter; we have also reason to be more jealous
of popular government, because that danger is more
terrible. This may teach us a lesson of moderation
in all our political controversies.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of PARTIES in GENERAL.</HEAD>
<P>OF all men, who distinguish themselves by me∣morable
atchievements, the first place of ho∣nour
seems due to LEGISLATORS, and founders of
states, who transmit a system of laws and institutions
to secure the peace, happiness, and liberty of future
generations. The influence of useful inventions in
the arts and sciences may, perhaps, extend farther
than those of wise laws, whose effects are limited both
in time and place; but the benefit arising from the
former is not so sensible as that which proceeds from
the latter. Speculative sciences do, indeed, improve
the mind; but this advantage reaches only to a few
persons, who have leisure to apply themselves to
them. And as to practical arts, which increase the
commodities and enjoyments of life, 'tis well known,
that mens happiness consists not so much in an abun∣dance
of these, as in the peace and security with which
they possess them; and those blessings can only be de∣rived
from good government. Not to mention, that
<PB N="94" REF="93"/>
general virtue and good morals in a state, which are
so requisite to happiness, can never arise from the most
refined precepts of philosophy, or even the severst
injunctions of religion; but must proceed entirely
from the virtuous education of the youth, the effect
of wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e laws and institutions. In must, therefore, pre∣sume
to differ from my lord BACON in this particular,
and must regard antiquity as somewhat unjust in its
distribution of honosr, when it made gods of all the
inventors of useful arts, such as CERES, BACCHUS,
AESCULAPIUS; and dignified legislators, such as RO∣MULUS
and THESUS, only with the appellation of
demi-gods, and heroes.</P>
<P>As much as legislators and founders of states ought
to be hounoured and respected among men, as much
ought the founders of sects and factions to be detested
and hated; because the influence of factions is di∣rectly
contrary to that of laws. Factions subvert go∣vernment,
reader laws impotent, and beget the fierceft
animo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ities among men of the same nation, who ought
to give mutual assistance and protection to each other.
And what should render the founder of parties more
odious is, the difficulty of extirpating these parties,
when once they have taken rise in any state. They
naturally propagate themselves for many centuries, and
seldom end but by the total dissolution of that go∣vernment,
in which they are planted. They are,
besides, seeds which grow most plentifully in the rich∣est
<PB N="95" REF="94"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oils; and tho' despotic governments be not en∣tirely
free from them, it must be confessed, that they
rise more easily, and propagate themselves faster in
free governments, where they always infect the legi∣slature
itself, which alone could be able by the steady
application of rewards and punishments, to eradicate
them.</P>
<P>FACTIONS or parties may be divided into PER∣SONAL
and REAL; that is, into factions founded on
personal friendship or animosity among those who
compose the factions, and into those founded on some
real difference of sentiment or interest. The reason
of this distinction is obvious, tho' I must acknow∣ledge,
that parties are seldom found pure and unmixt,
either of the one kind or the other. Tis not often
seen, that a government divides into factions, where
there is no difference in the views of these factions, either
real or apparent, trivial or material: And in those
factions, which are founded on the most real and most
material difference, there is always observed to be a
great deal of personal animosity or affection. But
notwithstanding this mixture, a party may be denomi∣nated
either personal or real, according to that prin∣ciple
which is peredominant, and is found to have the
greatest influence.</P>
<P>PERSONAL factions arise most easily in small re∣publics.
Every domestic quarrel becomes an affair of
state. Love, vanity, emulation, any passion begets
<PB N="96" REF="95"/>
public division as well as ambition and resentment.
The NERI and BIANCHI of FLORENCE, the FRE∣GOSI
and ADOEMI of GENOA, the COLONESSI and
ORSINI of modern ROME, were parties of this kind.</P>
<P>MEN have such a propensity to divide into personal
factions, that the smallest appearance of real difference
will produce them. What can be imagined more
trivial than the difference between one colour of livery
and another in horse-races? Yet this difference be∣got
two most inveterate factions in the GREEK em∣pire,
the PRASINI and VENETI, who never suspended
their animosities, till they ruined that unhappy go∣vernment.</P>
<P>WE find in the ROMAN history a very remarkable
faction betwixt two tribes, the POLLIA and PAPIRIA,
which continued for the space of near three hundred
years, and discovered itself in their suffrages at every
election of magistrates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As this fact has not been much observed by antiquaries or politicians, I shall deliver it in the words of the ROMAN histo∣rian. <HI>Populus</HI> TUSCULANUS <HI>cum conjugibus ac liberis ROMAM venit: Ea multitude, veste mutata, &amp; specie reorum tribus circuit, genibus se omnium advolvens.

LIVII, lib. 8. The CASTELANI and NICOLLOTI are two mobbish factions in VENICE, who frequently box toge∣ther, and then lay aside their quarrels presently.</NOTE>. This faction was the more
<PB N="97" REF="96"/>
remarkable, that it could continue for so long a tract
of time; even tho' it did not spread itself, nor draw
any of the other tribes into a share of the quarrel If
mankind had not a strong propensity to such divisons,
the indifference of the rest of the community must
have suppressed this foolish animosity, that had not
any aliment of new benefits and injuries, of sym∣pathy
and antipathy, which never fail to take place,
when the whole state is rent into two equal factions.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more usual than to see parties, which
have begun upon real difference, continue even
after that difference is lost. When men are once in∣listed
on opposite sides, they contract an affection to
the persons with whom they are united, and an ani∣mosity
against their antagonists: And these passions
they often transmit to their posterity. The real dif∣ference
between GUELF and GHIBBELLINE was long
lost in ITALY, before these factions were extinguished.
The GUELFS adhered to the pope, the GHIBBEL∣LINES
to the emperor; and yet the family of SFOR∣SA,
who were in alliance with the emperor, tho' they
<PB N="98" REF="97"/>
were GUELFS, being expelled MILAN by the king<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LEWIS XII.</NOTE>
of FRANCE, assisted by JACOMO TRIVULZIO and the
GHIBBELLINESS, the pope concurred with the latter,
and they formed leagues with the pope against the
emperor.</P>
<P>THE civil wars which arose some few years ago
in MOROCCO, betwixt the <HI>bla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks</HI> and <HI>whites,</HI> merely
on account of their complexion, are founded on a
very pleasant difference. We laugh at them; but I
believe, were things rightly examined, we afford
much more occasion of ridicule to the MOORS. For,
what are all the wars of religion which have pre∣vailed
in this polite and knowing part of the world?
They are certainly more absurd than the MOORISH
civil wars. The difference of complexion is sensible
and a real difference: But the difference about an ar∣ticle
of faith, which is utterly absurd and unitel∣ligible,
is not a difference of sentiments, but only a
difference of a few phrases and expressions, which one
party accepts of, without understanding them; and
the other refuses, in the same manner. Besides, I do
not find, that the <HI>whites</HI> in MOROCCO ever imposed
on the <HI>blacks</HI> any necessity of altering their com∣plexion,
or threatened them with inquisitions and
penal laws in case of obstinacy; Nor have the <HI>blacks</HI>
been more unreasonable in this particular. But is a
<PB N="99" REF="98"/>
man's opinion, where he is able to form a real opi∣nion,
more at his disposal than his complexion? And
can one be induced by force or fear to do more than
paint and disguise in the one case as well as in the
other?</P>
<P>REAL factions may be divided into factions from
<HI>interest,</HI> from <HI>principle</HI> and from <HI>affection.</HI> Of all fac∣tions,
those from interest are the most reasonable, and
most excusable. Where two orders of men, such
as the nobles and people, have a distinct authority in
a government, which is not very accurately balanced
and modelled, they naturally follow a distinct interest:
nor can we reasonably expect a different conduct from
that degree of selfishness, which is implanted in hu∣man
nature. It requires very great skill in a legisla∣tor
to prevent such factions; and many philosophers
are of opinion, that this secret, like the <HI>grand elixir,</HI>
or <HI>perpetual motion,</HI> may amuse men in theory, but can
never possibly be reduced to practice. In despotic go∣vernments,
indeed, factions often do not appear; but
they are never the less real; or rather, they are more
real and more pernicious, upon that very account.
The distinct orders of men, nobles and people, sol∣diers
and merchants, have all a distinct interest; but
the more powerful oppresses the weaker with impu∣nity,
and without resistance; which begets a seeming
tranquillity in such governments.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="99"/>
THERE has been an attemt to divide the <HI>landed</HI>
and <HI>trading</HI> interest in <HI>England;</HI> but without success.
The interest of these two bodies is not really distinct,
and never will be so, till our public debts increase to
such a degree, as to become altogether oppressive and
intolerable.</P>
<P>PARTIES from <HI>principles,</HI> especially abstarct specu∣lative
principles, are known only to modern times,
and are, perhaps, the most extraordinary and unac∣countable,
<HI>phaenomenon,</HI> which has ever yet appeared
in human affairs. Where different principles beget a
contrariety of conduct, which is the case with all dif∣ferent
political principles, the matter may be more
easily explained. A man, who esteems the true right
of government to lie in one man, or one family,
cannot easily agree with his fellow citizen, who thinks
that another man or family is possessed of this right.
Each naturally wishes that right may take place, ac∣cording
to his own notions of it. But where the dif∣ference
of principles is attended with no contrariety
of action, but each may follow his own way, without
interfering with his neighbour, as happens in all re∣ligious
controversies; what madness, what fury can
beget such unhappy and such fatal divisions?</P>
<P>Two men, travelling on the highway, the one
east▪ the other west, can easily pass each other, if the
way be broad enough: But two men, reasoning upon
<PB N="101" REF="100"/>
opposite principles of religion, cannot so easily pass,
without shocking; tho' one should think, that the
way were also, in that case, sufficiently broad, and that
each might proceed, without interruption, in his
own course. But such is the nature of the human
mind, that it always takes hold of every mind that
approaches it; and as it is wonderfully fortified and
corroborated by an unanimity of sentiments, so is it
shocked and disturbed by any contrariety. Hence the
eagerness, which most people discover in a dispute;
and hence their impatience of opposition, even in the
most speculative and indifferent opinions.</P>
<P>THIS principle, however frivolous it may appear,
seems to have been the origin of all religions wars
and divisions. But, as this principle is universal in
human nature, its effects would not have been been con∣fined
to one<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age, and to one sect of religion, did it
not there concur with other more accidental causes,
which raise it to such a height, as to produce the
highest misery and devastation. Most religions of the
ancient world arose in the unknown ages of governm∣ment,
when men were as yet barbarous and unin∣structed,
and the prince, as well as peasant, was dis∣posed
to receive, with implicit faith, every pious tale
or fiction which was offered him. The magistrate
embraced the religion of the people, and entering cor∣dially
into the care of sacred matters, naturally ac∣quired
an authority in them, and united the ecclesi∣astical
<PB N="102" REF="101"/>
with the civil power. But the <HI>Christian</HI> reli∣gion
arising, while principles directly opposite to it
were firmly established in the polite part of the world,
who despised the nation that first broached this no∣velty;
no wonder, that in such circumstances, it was
but little countenanced by the civil magistrate, and
that the priesthood were allowed to engross all the
authority in the new sect. So bad a use did they
make of this power, even in those early times, that
that the persecutions of Christianity may, perhaps
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I say, <HI>in part;</HI> For 'tis a vulgar error to imagine, that the ancients were as great friends to toleration as the ENGLISH OF DUTCH are at present. The laws against external superstition, amongst the ROMANS, were as ancient as the time of the twelve tables; and the JEWS as well as CHRISTIANS were sometimes punished by them: tho', in general, these laws were not rigorously executed. Immediately after the conquest of GAUL, they forbad all but the natives to be initiated into the religion of the DRUIDS; and this was a kind of persecution. In about a century after this conquest, the emperor, CLAUDIUS, quite abolished that superstition by penal laws; which would have been a very grievous persecution, if the imitation of the ROMAN manners had not, before-hand, weaned the GAULS from their ancient prejudices. SUETONIUS <HI>in vita</HI> CLAUDII. PLINY ascribes the abolition of the Druid superstitions to TI∣BERIUS, probably because that emperor had taken some steps towards restraining them, (lib. 30. cap. 1.) This is an in∣stance of the usual caution and moderation of the ROMANS in such cases; and very different from their violent and sanguinary method of treating the <HI>Christians.</HI> Hence we may entertain a suspicion, that those furious persecutions of <HI>Christianity</HI> were, in some measure, owing to the imprudent zeal and bigotry of the first propagators of that sect; and Ecclesiastical history af∣fords us many reasons to confirm this suspicion.</NOTE> <HI>in part,</HI> be ascribed to the violence instilled by them
<PB N="103" REF="102"/>
into their followers. And the same principles of
priestly government continuing, after Christianity be∣came
the established religion, they have engendered a
spirit of persecution, which has ever since been the
poison of human society, and the source of the most
inveterate factions in every government. Such fac∣tions,
therefore, on the part of the people, may justly
be esteemed factions of <HI>principle:</HI> but, on the part of
the priests, who are the prime movers, they are really
factions of <HI>interest.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another cause (beside the authority of
the priests, and the separation of the ecclesiastical and
civil powers) which has contributed to render CHRIS∣TENDOM
the scene of religious wars and divisions.
Religions, that arise in ages totally ignorant and bar∣barous,
consist mostly of traditional tales and fictions,
which may be very different in every sect, without be∣ing
contrary to each other; and even when they are
contrary, every one adheres to the tradition of his
own sect, without much reasoning or disputation.
<PB N="104" REF="103"/>
But as philosophy was widely spread over the world,
at the time when Christianity arose, the teachers of
the new sect were obliged to form a system of specu∣lative
opinions; to divide, with some accuracy, their
articles of faith; and to explain, comment, confute,
and confirm with all the subtilty of argument and sci∣ence.
From hence naturally arose keenness in dis∣pute,
when the christian religion came to be split in∣to
new divisions and heresies: And this keenness as∣sisted
the priests in their pernicious policy, of beget∣ting
a mutual hatred and antipathy among their de∣luded
followers. Sects of philosophy, in the ancient
world, were more zealous than parties of religion;
but in modern times, parties of religion are more fu∣rious
and enraged than the most cruel factions which
ever arose from interest and ambition.</P>
<P>I HAVE mentioned parties from <HI>offection</HI> as a kind
of <HI>real</HI> parties, beside those from <HI>interest</HI> and <HI>principle.</HI>
By parties from affection. I understand those which
are founded on the different affections of men to∣wards
particular families and persons, whom they de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire
to rule over them. These parties are often very
violent; tho', I must own, it is somewhat unaccount∣able,
that men should attach themselves so strongly
to persons, with whom they are no way acquainted,
whom perhaps they never saw, and from whom they
never received, nor can ever hope for any favour.
Yet this we find often to be the case, and even with
<PB N="105" REF="104"/>
men, who, on other occasions, discover no great ge∣nerosity
of spirit, nor are found to be easily transported
by friendship beyond their own interest. We are apt,
I know not how, to think the relation betwixt us and
our sovereign very close and intimate. The splendor
of majesty and power bestows an importance on the
fortunes even of a single person. And when a man's
good-nature gives him not this imaginary interest, his
ill-nature will, from spite and opposition to persons
whose sentiments are different from his own.

for it, under any administration, to avoid. The just
balance between the republican and monarchical part
of our constitution is really, in itself; so extreme∣ly
delicate and uncertain, that when joined to mens
passions and prejudices, 'tis impossible but different
opinions must arise concerning it, even among per∣sons
of the best understanding. Those of mild tem∣pers,
who love peace and order, and detest sedition
and civil wars, will always entertain more favour∣able
sentiments of monarchy, than men of bold and
generous spirits, who are passionate lovers of liber∣ty,
and think no evil comparable to subjection and
slavery. And tho' all reasonable men agree in ge∣neral
to preserve our mixed government; yet when
they come to particulars, some will incline to trust
<PB N="108" REF="108"/>
larger powers to the crown, to bestow on it more
influence, and to guard against its encroachments with
less caution, than others who are terrified at the most
distant approaches of tyranny and despotic power.
Thus are there parties of PRINCIPLE involved in
the very nature of our constitution, which may pro∣perly
enough be denominated those of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These words have become of general use, and therefore I shall employ them, without intending to express by them an universal blame of the one party, or approbation of the other. The court-party may, no doubt, on some occasions consult best the interest of the country, and the country-party oppose it. In like manner, the ROMAN part<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s were denominated <HI>Op∣timates</HI> and <HI>Populares;</HI> and CICERO, like a true party-man, defines the <HI>Optimates</HI> to be such as, in all their public con∣duct, regulated themselves by the sentiments of the best and worthiest of the ROMANS: <HI>Pro.

The term of <HI>Country-party</HI> may afford a favourable definition or etymo∣logy of the same kind: But it would be folly to draw any argument from that head, and I have no regard to it in employ∣ing these terms.</NOTE> COURT and
COUNTRY. The strength and violence of each of
these part<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will much depend upon the particular
administration. An administration may be so bad, as
to throw a g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat majority into the opposition; as a
good administration will reconcile to the court many
of the most passionate lovers of liberty. But, how∣ever
the nation may fluctuate betwixt them, the par∣ties
<PB N="109" REF="109"/>
themselves will always subsist, so long as we
are governed by a limited monarchy.</P>
<P>BUT, besides this difference of <HI>Principle,</HI> those par∣ties
are very much fomented by a difference of IN∣TEREST,
without which they could scarce ever be
dangerous or violent. The crown will naturally be∣stow
all its trust and power upon those, whose prin∣ciples,
real or pretended, are most favourable to mo∣narchical
government; and this temptation will na∣turally
engage them to go greater lengths than their
principles would otherwise carry them. Their an∣tagonists,
who are disappointed in their ambitious
aims, throw themselves into the party whose princi∣ples
incline them to be most jealous of royal power,
and naturally carry those principles to a greater length
than sound politics will justify. Thus, the <HI>Court</HI> and
<HI>Country</HI> parties, which are the genuine offspring of
the BRITISH government, are a kind of mixt parties,
and are influenced both by principle and by interest.
The heads of the factions are commonly most govern∣ed
by the latter motive; the inferior members of
them by the former. I must be understood to mean
this of persons who have motives for taking party
on any side. For, to tell the truth, the greatest part
are commonly men who associate themselves they
know not why; from example, from passion, from
idleness. But still it is requisite, that there be some
source of division, either in principle or interest;
<PB N="110" REF="110"/>
otherwise such persons would not find parties, to which
they could associate themselves.</P>
<P>AS to ecclesiastical parties; we may observe, that,
in all ages of the world, priests have been enemies
to liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This proposition is true, notwithstanding, that in the early times of the ENGLISH government, the clergy were the great and principal opposers of the crown: But, at that time, their possessions were so immensely great, that they composed a consi∣derable part of the proprietors of ENGLAND, and in many con∣testa were direct rivals of the crown.</NOTE>, and 'tis certain, that this steady conduct
of theirs must have been founded on fixt reasons of
interest and ambition. Liberty of thinking, and of ex∣pressing
our thoughts, is always fatal to priestly power,
and to those pious frauds, on which it is commonly
founded; and, by an infallible connexion, which pre∣vails
among every species of liberty, this privilege can
never be enjoyed, at least, has never yet been enjoyed,
but in a free government. Hence it must happen, in
such a government as that of BRITAIN, that the
established cleagy, while things are in their natural
situation, will always be of the <HI>Court</HI>-party; as, on
the contrary, dissenters of all kinds will be of the
<HI>Country</HI>-party; since they can never hope for that
toleration, which they stand in need of, but by means
of our free government. All princes, who have aim∣ed
at despotic power, have known of what impor∣tance
it was to gain the established clergy: As the
clergy, on their side, have shewn a great facility of
<PB N="111" REF="111"/>
entering into the views of such princes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Judaei sibi ipsi reges imposuere; qui mobilitate vulgi ex∣pulsi, resumpta per arma dominatione; fugas civium, urbium eversiones, fratrum, conjugum, parentum neces, aliaque solita regibus ausi, superstitionem fovebant; quia honor sacerdotii fir∣mamentum potentiae assumebatur.

VAZA was, perhaps, the only ambitious mo∣narch,
that ever depressed the church, at the same
time, that he discouraged liberty. But the exorbi∣tant
power of the bishops in SWEDEN, who, at that
time, overtopped the crown, together with their at∣tachment
to a foreign family, was the reason of his
embracing such an unusual system of politics.</P>
<P>THIS observation concerning the propensity of
priests to despotic power, and to the government of
a single person, is not true with regard to one sect
only. The <HI>Presbiterian</HI> and <HI>Calvinistic</HI> clergy in
HOLLAND were always professed friends to the fa∣mily
of ORANGE; as the <HI>Arminians,</HI> who were es∣teemed
heretics, were always of the LOUVESTEIN
faction, and zealous for liberty. But if a prince has
the choice of both, 'tis easy to see, that he will pre∣fer
the episcopal to the presbyterian form of go∣vernment,
both because of the greater affinity be∣tween
monarchy and episcopacy, and because of the
facility which a prince finds, in such a government,
of ruling the clergy, by means of their ecclesiastical
superiors<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Populi imperium juxta libertatem: paucorum dominatio regiae libidini propior est. TACIT. <HI>Ann. lib.</HI> 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="112"/>
IF we consider the first rise of parties in ENG∣LAND,
during the civil wars, we shall find, that it
was exactly conformable to this general theory, and
that the species of government gave birth to these
parties, by a regular and infallible operation. The
ENGLISH constitution, before that time, had lain in
a kind of confusion; yet so, as that the subjects pos∣sessed
many noble privileges, which, tho' not, per∣haps,
exactly bounded and secured by law, were uni∣versally
deemed, from long possession, to belong to
them as their birth-right. An ambitious, or rather
an ignorant, prince arose, who esteemed all these pri∣vileges
to be concessions of his predecessors, revo∣cable
at pleasure; and, in prosecution of this prin∣ciple,
he openly acted in violation of liberty, during
the course of several years. Necessity, at last, con∣strained
him to call a parliament: the spirit of li∣berty
arose and spread itself: The prince, being
without any support, was obliged to grant every thing
required of him: And his enemies, jealous and im∣placable,
set no bounds to their pretensions. Here
then began those contests, in which it was no won∣der,
that men of that age were divided into diffe∣rent
parties; since even at this day, the impartial
are at a loss to decide concerning the justice of the
quarrel. The pretensions of the parliament, if yield∣ed
to, broke the balance of our constitution, by ren∣dering
the government almost intirely republican.
If not yielded to, we were, perhaps, still in danger
<PB N="113" REF="113"/>
of despotic power, from the settled principles and
inveterate habits of the king, which had plainly ap∣peared
in every concession that he had been con∣strained
to make to his people. In this question, so
delicate and uncertain, men naturally sell to the side
which was most conformable to their usual princi∣ples;
and those, who were the most passionate fa∣vourers
of monarchy, declared for the king, as the
zealous friends of liberty sided with the parliament.
The hopes of success being nearly equal on both
fides, <HI>interest</HI> had no general influence in this con∣test:
So that ROUND-HEAD and CAVALIER were
merely parties of principle; neither of which dis∣owned
either monarchy or liberty; but the former
party inclined most to the republican part of our
government, and the latter to the monarchical. In
this respect they may be considered as court and
country-party enflamed into a civil war, by an un∣happy
concurrence of circumstances, and by the tur∣bulent
spirit of the age. The commonwealth's men,
and the partizans of despotic power, lay concealed in
both parties, and formed but an inconsiderable part
of them.</P>
<P>THE clergy had concurred with the king's arbi∣trary
designs, according to their usual maxims in such
cases: And, in return, were allowed to persecute
their adversaries, whom they called heretics and schis∣matics.
The established clergy were episcopal; the
<PB N="114" REF="114"/>
non-conformists pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>byterian: So that all things con∣curred
to throw the former, without reserve, into the
king's party; and the latter into that of the par∣liament.
The <HI>Cavaliers</HI> being the court party, and
the <HI>Round-heads</HI> the country-party, the union was in∣fallible
between the former and the established pre∣lacy,
and between the latter and presbyterian non-conformists.
This union is so natural, according to
the general principles of politics, that it requires
some very extraordinary situation of affairs to break
it.</P>
<P>EVERY one knows the event of this quarrel; fa∣tal
to the king first, and to the parliament afterwards.
After many confusions and revolutions, the royal fa∣mily
was at last restored, and the government esta∣blished
on the same footing as before. CHARLES II.
was not made wiser by the example of his father;
but prosecuted the same measures, tho' at first, with
more secrecy and caution. New parties arose, under
the appellations of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> which have con∣tinued
ever since to confound and distract our go∣vernment.
What the nature is of these parties, is,
perhaps, one of the most difficult questions, which
can be met with, and is a proof that history may con∣tain
problems, as uncertain as any, which are to be
found in the most abstract sciences. We have seen
the conduct of these two parties, during the course
of seventy years, in a vast variety of circumstances,
<PB N="115" REF="115"/>
possessed of power, and deprived of it, during peace
and during war: Persons, who profess themselves of
one side or other, we meet every hour, in company,
in our pleasures, in our serious occupations: We our∣selves
are constrained, in a manner, to take party;
and living in a country of the highest liberty, every
one may openly declare all his sentiments and opi∣nions:
And yet we are at a loss to tell the nature,
pretensions, and principles of the parties. The que∣stion
is, perhaps, in itself, somewhat dissicult; but
has been rendered more so, by the prejudice and vio∣lence
of party.</P>
<P>When we compare the parties of WHIG and
TORY, to those of ROUND-HEAD and CAVALIER,
the most obvious difference, which appears betwixt
them, consists in the principles of <HI>passive obedience,</HI>
and <HI>indefeasible right,</HI> which were but little heard of
among the CAVALIERS, but became the universal
doctrine, and were esteemed the true characteristic of
a TORY. Were these principles pushed into their
most obvious consequences, they imply a formal re∣nunciation
of all our liberties, and an avowal of ab∣solute
monarchy; since nothing can be a greater ab∣surdity
than a limited power, which must not be re∣sisted,
even when it exceeds its limitations. But as
the most rational principles are often but a weak
counterpoise to passion; 'tis no wonder, that these
absurd principles, <HI>sufficient,</HI> according to a celebrat∣ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Differtation on parties, <HI>Letter</HI> 2d.</NOTE>
<PB N="116" REF="116"/>
author, <HI>to shock the common sense of a</HI> HOTTEN∣TOT
or SAMOIEDE, were found too weak for that
effect. The TORIES, as men, were enemies to op∣pression;
and also as ENGLISHMEN, they were ene∣mies
to despotic power. Their zeal for liberty, was,
perhaps, less servent than that of their antagonists; but
was sufficient to make them forget all their general prin∣ciples,
when they saw themselves openly threatened
with a subversion of the antient government. From
these sentiments arose the <HI>revolution;</HI> an event of
mighty consequence, and the firmest foundation of
BRITISH liberty. The conduct of the TORIES, dur∣ing
that event, and after it, will afford us a true insight
into the nature of that party.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>first</HI> place, They appear to have had the
sentiments of true BRITONS in their affections to
liberty, and in their determined resolution not to
sacrifice it to any abstract principles whatsover, or to
any imaginary rights of princes. This part of their
character might justly have been doubted of before
the <HI>revolution,</HI> from the obvious tendency of their
avowed principles, and from their great compliances
with a court, which made little secret of its arbitrary
designs. The <HI>revlution</HI> shewed them to have been,
in this respect, nothing but a genuine <HI>court-party,</HI> such
as might be expected in a BRITISH government:
That is, <HI>Lovers of liberty, but greater lovers of mo∣narchy.</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="117"/>
It must, however, be confessed, that they
carried their monarchical principles further, even in
practice, but more so in theory, than was, in any de∣gree,
consistent with a limited government.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> NEITHER their principles nor affections
concurred, entirely or heartily, with the settlement
made at the <HI>revolution,</HI> or with that which has since
taken place. This part of their character may seem
contradictory to the former; since any other settle∣ment,
in those circumstances of the nation, must pro∣bably
have been dangerous, if not fatal to liberty.
But the heart of man is made to reconcile contradic∣tions
; and this contradiction is not greater than that
betwixt <HI>passive obedience,</HI> and the <HI>resistance</HI> employed
at the <HI>revolution.</HI> A TORY, therefore, since the <HI>revo∣lution
,</HI> may be defined in a few words, to be <HI>a lover
of monarchy, tho' without abandoning liberty; and a
partizan of the family of</HI> STUART. As a WHIG may
be defined to be <HI>a lover of liberty, tho' without re∣nouncing
monarchy; and a friend to the settlement in
the</HI> PROTESTANT <HI>line</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The author above cited has asserted, that the REAL dis∣tinction betwixt WHIG and TORY was lost at the <HI>revolution,</HI> and that ever since they have continued to be mere <HI>personal</HI> par∣ties, like the GUELFS and GIBBELINES, after the emperors had lost all authority in ITALY. Such an opinion, were it received, would turn our whole history into an aenigma.</P>
<P>I shall first mention, as a proof of a real distinction betwixt these parties, what every one may have observed or heard con∣cerning the conduct and conversation of all his friends and ac∣quaintance on both sides. Have not the TORIES always bore an avowed affection to the family of STUART, and have not their adversaries always opposed with vigour the succession of that family?</P>
<P>The TORY principles are confessedly the most favourable to monarchy. Yet the tories have almost always opposed the court these fifty years; nor were they cordial friends to King WIL∣LIAM, even when employed by him. Their▪ quarrel, there∣fore, cannot be supposed to have lain with the throne, but with the person who sat on it.</P>
<P>They concurred heartily with the court during the four last years of Queen ANNE. But is any one at a loss to find the reason?</P>
<P>The succession of the crown in the BRITISH government is a point of too great consequence to be absolutely indifferent to persons who concern themselves, in any degree, about the for∣tune of the public; much less can it be supposed, that the TO∣RY party, who never valued themselves upon moderation, could maintain a <HI>stoical</HI> indifference in a point of such importance. Were they, therefore, zealous for the house of HANOVER? Or was there any thing that kept an opposite zeal from openly ap∣pearing, if it did not openly appear, but prudence, and a sense of decency?</P>
<P>'Tis monstrous to see an established episcopal clergy in declared opposition to the court, and a non-conformist presbyterian clergy in conjunction with it. What could have produced such an unnatural conduct in both? Nothing, but that the former espoused monarchical principles too high for the present settle∣ment, which is founded on principles of liberty: And the lat∣ter, being afraid of the prevalence of those high principles, ad∣hered to that party, from whom they had reason to expect liber∣ty and toleration.</P>
<P>The different conduct of the two parties, with regard to fo∣reign politics, is also a proof to the same purpose. HOLLAND has always been most favoured by one, and FRANCE by the other. In short, the proofs of this kind seem so palpable and evident, that 'tis almost needless to collect them.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="118"/>
THESE different views, with regard to the settle∣ment
of the crown, were accidental, but natural ad∣ditions
<PB N="119" REF="119"/>
to the principles of the <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country</HI> par∣ties,
which are the genuine parties of the BRITISH
government. A passionate lover of monarchy is apt
to be displeased at any change of the succession; as
savouring too much of a commonwealth: A passion∣ate
lover of liberty, is apt to think that every part of
the government ought to be subordinate to the inter∣e
sts of liberty. 'Tis however remarkable, that tho'
the principles of WHIG and TORY were both of them
of a compound nature; yet the ingredients, which
predominated in both, were not correspondent to each
other. A TORY loved monarchy, and bore an af∣fection
to the family of STUART; but the latter af∣fection
was the predominant inclination of the party.
A WHIG-loved-liberty, and was a friend to the set∣tlement
<PB N="120" REF="120"/>
in the PROTESTANT line; but the love of
liberty was professedly his predominant inclination.
The TORIES have frequently acted as republicans,
where either policy or revenge has engaged them to
that conduct; and there was no one of that party,
who, upon the supposition, that he was to be disap∣pointed
in his views with regard to the succession,
would not have desired to impose the strictest limita∣tions
on the crown, and to bring our form of govern∣ment
as near republican as possible, in order to de∣press
the family, which, according to his apprehen∣sion,
succeeded without any just title. The WHIGS,
'tis true, have also taken steps dangerous to liberty,
under colour of securing the succession and settlement
of the crown, according to their views: But as the
body of the party had no passion for that succession,
otherwise than as the means of securing liberty, they
have been betrayed into these steps by ignorance or
frailty, or the interests of their leaders. The succes∣sion
of the crown was, therefore, the chief point with
the TORIES; the security of our liberties with the
WHIGS. Nor is this seeming irregularity at all dif∣ficult
to be accounted for, by our present theory.
<HI>Court</HI> and <HI>country</HI> parties are the true parents of TORY
and WHIG. But 'tis almost impossible, that the at∣tachment
of the <HI>court</HI> party to monarchy should not
degenerate into an attachment to the monarch; there
being so close a connexion between them, and the lat∣ter
being so much the more natural object. How
<PB N="121" REF="121"/>
easily does the worship of the divinity degenerate into
a worship of the idol? The connexion is not so great
betwixt liberty, the divinity of the old <HI>country</HI> party
or WHIGS, and any monarch or royal family; nor is
it so reasonable to suppose, that in that party, the wor∣ship
can be so easily transferred from the one to the
other. Tho' even that would be no great miracle.</P>
<P>'TIS difficult to penetrate into the thoughts and
sentiments of any particular man; but 'tis almost im∣possible
to distinguish those of a whole party, where it
often happens, that no two persons agree precisely in
the same maxims of conduct. Yet I will venture to
affirm, that it was not so much PRINCIPLE, or an
opinion of indefeasible right, which attached the
TORIES to the ancient royal family, as AFFECTION,
or a certain love and esteem for their persons. The
same cause divided ENGLAND formerly between the
houses of YORK and LANCASTER, and SCOTLAND
between the families of BRUCE and BALIOL; in an
age, when political disputes were but little in fashion,
and when political <HI>principles</HI> must of course have had
but little influence on mankind. The doctrine of
passive obedience is so absurd in itself, and so opposite
to our liberties, that it seems to have been chiefly left
to pulpit-declaimers, and to their deluded followers
among the vulgar. Men of better sense were guided
by <HI>affection;</HI> and as to the leaders of this party, 'tis
probable, that <HI>interest</HI> was their chief motive, and
<PB N="122" REF="122"/>
that they acted more contrary to their private senti∣ments,
than the leaders of the opposite party. Tho'
'tis almost impossible to maintain with zeal the right of
any person or family, without acquiring a good-will
to them, and changing the <HI>principle</HI> into <HI>affection;</HI> yet
this is less natural to people of an elevated station and
liberal education, who have had full opportunity of
observing the weakness, folly, and arrogance of mo∣narchs,
and have found them to be nothing superior,
if not rather inferior to the rest of mankind. The
<HI>interest,</HI> therefore, of being heads of a party does of∣ten,
with such people, supply the place both of <HI>prin∣ciple</HI> and <HI>affection.</HI></P>
<P>SOME, who will not venture to assert, that the <HI>real</HI>
difference betwixt WHIG and TORY was lost at the
<HI>revolution,</HI> seem inclined to think, that the difference
is now abolished, and that affairs are so far returned to
their natural state, that there are at present no other par∣ties
amongst us but <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country;</HI> that is, men,
who by interest or principle, are attached either to mo∣narchy
or to liberty. It must, indeed, be confest, that
the TORY party seem, of late, to have decayed much
in their numbers; still more in their zeal; and I may
venture to say, still more in their credit and authority.
There are few men of knowledge or learning, at least,
few philosophers, since Mr. LOCKE has wrote, who
would not be ashamed to be thought of that party;
and in almost all companies the name of OLD WHIG
<PB N="123" REF="123"/>
is mentioned as an uncontestable appellation of honour
and dignity. Accordingly, the enemies of the mi∣nistry,
as a reproach, call the courtiers the true TO∣RIES
; and as an honour, denominate the gentlemen
in the <HI>opposition</HI> the true WHIGS. The TORIES have
been so long obliged to talk in the republican stile,
that they seem to have made converts of themselves
by their hypocrisy, and to have embraced the senti∣ments,
as well as language of their adversaries. There
are, however, very considerable remains of that par∣ty
in ENGLAND, with all their old prejudices; and a
proof, that <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country</HI> are not our only par∣ties,
is, that almost all the dissenters side with the
court, and the lower clergy, at least, of the church of
ENGLAND, with the opposition. This may convince
us, that some byass still hangs upon our constitution,
some extrinsic weight, which turns it from its natural
course, and causes a confusion in our parties.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this subject with observing, that
we never had any TORIES in SCOTLAND, according
to the proper signification of the word, and that the
division of parties in this country was really into
WHIGS and JACOBITES. A JACOBITE seems to be
a TORY, who has no regard to the constitution, but
is either a zealous partizan of absolute monarchy, or at
least willing to sacrifice our liberties to the obtaining the
succession in that family to which he is attached. The
reason of the difference betwixt ENGLAND and SCOT∣LAND,
<PB N="124" REF="124"/>
I take to be this: Political and religious di∣visions
in the latter country, have been, since the <HI>re∣volution
,</HI> regularly correspondent to each other. The
PRESBYTERIANS were all WHIGS without excep∣tion
: Those who favoured <HI>episcopacy,</HI> of the opposite
party. And as the clergy of the latter sect were
turned out of their churches at the <HI>revolution,</HI> they had
no motive for making any compliances with the go∣vernment
in their oaths, or their forms of prayers, but
openly avowed the highest principles of their party;
which is the cause, why their followers have been
more viclent than their brethren of the TORY party
in ENGLAND<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of the opinions, delivered in these Essays, with re∣gard to the public transactions in the last century, the author, on more accurate examination, found occasion to retract in his <HI>History of</HI> GREAT BRITAIN.

<P>THESE two species of false religion, tho' both per∣nicious,
are yet of a very different, and even of a con∣trary

unaccountable terrors and apprehensions, proceeding
either from the unhappy situation of private or public
affairs, from ill health, from a gloomy and melan∣choly
disposition, or from the concurrence of all
these circumstances. In such a state of mind, infinite
unknonw evils are dreaded from unknown agents;
and where real objects of terror are wanting, the soul,
active to its own prejudice, and fostering its predomi∣nant
inclination, finds imaginary ones, to whose
power and malevolence it sets no limits. As these
enemies are entirely invisible and unknown, the me∣thods
taken to appease them are equally unaccount∣able,

recommends to a blind and terrified credulity.
Weakness, fear, melancholy, together with igno∣rance,
are, therefore, the true sources of SUPER∣STITION.</P>
<P>BUT the mind of man is also subject to an unac∣countable
elevation and presumption, proceeding
from prosperous success, from luxuriant health, from
strong spirits, or from a bold and confident disposi∣tion.
In such a state of mind, the imagination swells
with great, but confused conceptions, to which no
sublunary beauties or enjoyments can correspond.
Every thing mortal and perishable vanishes as un∣worthy
of attention. And a full range is given to the
fancy in the invisible regions or world of spirits,
where the soul is at liberty to indulge itself in every
imagination, which may best suit its present taste and
disposition. Hence arise raptures, transports, and
surprising flights of fancy; and confidence and pre∣sumption
still increasing, these raptures being alto∣gether
unaccountable, and seeming quite beyond the
reach of our ordinary faculties, are attributed to the
immediate inspiration of that Divine Being, who is
the object of devotion. In a little time, the inspired
person comes to regard himself as the chief favourite
of the Divinity; and when this frenzy once takes
<PB N="127" REF="127"/>
place, which is the summit of enthusiasm, every
whimsy is consecrated: Human reason, and even mo∣rality
are rejected as fallacious guides: And the fana∣tic
madman delivers himself over, blindly, and with∣out
reserve, the supposed illapses of the spirit, and
to inspirations from above. Hope, pride, presump∣tion,
a warm imagination, together with ignorance,
are, therefore, the true sources of ENTHUSIASM.</P>
<P>THESE two species of false religion might afford
occasion to many speculations; but I shall confine
myself, at present, to a few reflexions concerning their
different influence on government and society.</P>
<P>MY first reflection is, <HI>That superstion is favour∣able
to preistly power, and enthusiasm as much or ra∣ther
more contrary to it, than sound reason and philo∣sophy.</HI>
As superstition is founded on fear, sorrow, and
a depression of spirits, it represents the man to him∣self
in such despicable colours, that he appears un∣worthy
in his own eyes, of approaching the divine
presence, and naturally has recourse to any other per∣son,
whose sanctity of life, or, perhaps, impudence
and cunning, have made him be supposed more fa∣voured
by the Divinity. To him the superstitious
entrust their devotions: To his care they recommend
their prayers, petitions, and sacrifices: And by his
means, hope to render their addresses acceptable to
<PB N="128" REF="128"/>
their incensed deity. Hence the origin of PRIESTS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <HI>Priests</HI> I here mean only the pretenders to power and dominion, and to a superior sanctity of character, distinct from virtue and good morals. These are very different from <HI>clergymen,</HI> who are set apart, <HI>by the laws,</HI> to the care of sacred matters, and to the conducting our public devotions with greater decency and order. There is no rank of men more to be respected than the latter.</NOTE>,
who may justly be regarded as one of the grossest in∣ventions
of a timorous and abject superstition, which,
ever diffident of itself, dares not offer up its own de∣votions,
but ignorantly thinks to recommend itself to
the divinity, by the mediation of his supposed friends
and servants. As superstition is a considerable ingre∣dient
in almost all religions, even the most fanatical;
there being nothing but philosophy able to conquer
entirely these unaccountable terrors; hence it pro∣ceeds,
that in almost every sect of religion there are
priests to be found. But the stronger mixture there
is of superstition, the higher is the authority of the
priesthood. Modern judaism and popery, (especially
the latter) being the most unphilosophical and absurd
superstitions which have yet been known in the
world, are the most enslaved by their priests. As the
church of ENGLAND may justly be said to retain some
mixture of popish superstition, it partakes also, in its
original constitution, of a propensity to priestly power
<PB N="129" REF="129"/>
and dominion; particularly in the respect it exacts to
the sacerdotal character. And tho', according to the
sentiments of that church, the prayers of the priest
must be accompanied with those of the laity; yet is
he the mouth of the congregation, his person is sacred,
and without his presence few would think their pub∣lic
devotions, or the sacraments, and other rites, ac∣ceptable
to the divinity.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, it may be observed, that all en∣thusiasts
have been free from the yoke of ecclesiastics,
and have exprest great independence in their devo∣tion;
with a contempt of forms, ceremonies, and
traditions. The <HI>quakers</HI> are the most egregious, tho'
at the same time, the most innocent enthusiasts that
have been yet known; and are, perhaps, the only
sect, who have never admitted priests amongst them.
The <HI>independents,</HI> of all the ENGLISH secta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, ap∣proach
nearest to the <HI>quakers</HI> in fanaticism, and in
their freedom from priestly bondage. The <HI>presby∣terians</HI>
follow after, at an equal distance in both these
particulars. In short, this observation is founded in
the most certain experience; and will also appear to
be founded on reason, if we consider, that as en∣thusiasm
arises from a presumptuous pride and confi∣dence,
it thinks itself sufficiently qualified to <HI>ap∣proach</HI>
the divinity, without any human mediator.
Its rapturous devotions are so fervent, that it even
imagines itself <HI>actually</HI> to <HI>approach</HI> him by the way of
<PB N="130" REF="130"/>
contemplation and inward converse; which makes it
neglect all those outward ceremonies and observan∣ces,
to which the assistance of the priests appears so re∣quisite
in the eyes of their superstitious votaries. The
fanatic consecrates himself, and bestows on his own
person a sacred character, much superior to what
forms and ceremonious institutions can confer on any
other.</P>
<P>MY <HI>second</HI> reflection with regard to these species of
false religion is, <HI>that religions, which partake of enthu∣siasm
are, on their first rise, much more furious and
violent than those which partake of superstition; but in
a little time become much more gentle and moderate.</HI>
The violence of this species of religion, when excited
by novelty, and animated by opposition, appears
from numberless instances; of the <HI>anabaptists</HI> in GER∣MANY,
the <HI>camisars</HI> in FRANCE, the <HI>levellers</HI> and
other fanatics in ENGLAND, and the <HI>covenanters</HI> in
SCOTLAND. Enthusiasm being founded on strong
spirits, and a presumptuous boldness of character, it
naturally begets the most extreme resolutions; espe∣cially
after it rises to that height as to inspire the de∣luded
fanatics with the opinion of divine illumina∣tions,
and with a contempt for the common rules of
reason, morality and prudence.</P>
<P>'TIS thus enthusiasm produces the most cruel deso∣lations
in human society: But its fury is like that of
<PB N="131" REF="131"/>
thunder and tempest, which exhaust themselves in a
little time, and leave the air more calm and serene
than before. When the first fire of enthusiasm is
spent, men naturally, in all fanatical sects, sink into
the greatest remissness and coolness in sacred matters;
there being no body of men amongst them, endow∣ed
with sufficient authority, whose interest is con∣cerned
to support the religious spirit: No rites, no
ceremonies, no holy observances, which may enter
into the common train of life, and preserve the sa∣cred
principles from oblivion. Superstition, on the
contrary, steals in gradually and insensibly; renders
men tame and submissive; is acceptable to the ma∣gistrate,
and seems inoffensive to the people: Till at
last the priest, having firmly established his authority,
becomes the tyrant and disturber of human society,
by his endless contentions, persecutions, and religious
wars. How smoothly did the ROMISH church ad∣vance
in their acquisition of power? But into what
dismal convulsions did they throw all EUROPE, in
order to maintain it? On the other hand, our sec∣taries,
who were formerly such dangerous bigots, are
now become very free reasoners; and the <HI>quakers</HI>
seem to approach nearly the only regular body of
<HI>deists</HI> in the universe, the <HI>literati,</HI> or the disciples of
CONFUCIUS in CHINA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The CHINESE Literati have no priests or ecclesiastical esta∣blishment.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="132"/>
MY <HI>third</HI> observation on this head is, <HI>that super∣stition
is an enemy to civil liberty, and enthusiasm a
friend to it.</HI> As superstition groans under the domi∣nion
of the priests, and enthusiasm is destructive of
all ecclesiastical power, this sufficiently accounts for
the present observation. Not to mention, that en∣thusiasm
being the infirmity of bold and ambitious
tempers, is naturally accompanied with a spirit of li∣berty;
as superstition, on the contrary, renders men
tame and abject, and fits them for slavery. We learn
from the ENGLISH history, that, during the civil
wars, the <HI>independents</HI> and <HI>deists,</HI> tho' the most oppo∣site
in their religious principles; yet were united in
their political ones, and were alike passionate for a
commonwealth. And since the origin of <HI>whig</HI> and
<HI>tory,</HI> the leaders of the <HI>whigs</HI> have either been <HI>deists</HI>
or profest <HI>latitudinarians</HI> in their principles; that is,
friends to toleration, and indifferent to any parti∣cular
sect of <HI>christians:</HI> While the sectaries, who
have all a strong tincture of enthusiasm, have always,
without exception, concurred with that party, in the
defence of civil liberty. The resemblance in their
superstitions long united the high-church <HI>tories,</HI> and
the <HI>Roman catholics,</HI> in the support of prerogative and
kingly power; tho' experience of the tolerating spirit
of the <HI>whigs</HI> seems of late to have reconciled the <HI>ca∣tholics</HI>
to that party.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="133"/>
THE <HI>molinists</HI> and <HI>jansenists</HI> in FRANCE have a
thousand unintelligible disputes, which are not wor∣thy
the reflection of a man of sense: But what princi∣pally
distinguishes these two sects, and alone merits at∣tention,
is the different spirit of their religion. The
<HI>molinist.,</HI> conducted by the <HI>jesuites,</HI> are great friends to
superstition, rigid observers of external forms and ce∣remonies,
and devoted to the authority of the priests,
and to tradition. The <HI>jarsenists</HI> are enthusiasts, and
zealous promoters of the passionate devotion, and of
the inward life; little influenced by authority; and,
in a word, but half catholics. The consequences are
exactly conformable to the foregoing reasoning. The
<HI>jesuites</HI> are the tyrants of the people, and the slaves
of the court: And the <HI>jansenists</HI> preserve alive the
small sparks of the love of liberty, which are to be
found in the FRENCH nation.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of AVARICE.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS easy to observe, that comic writers exag∣gerate
every character, and draw their fop,
or coward with stronger features than are any where
to be met with in nature. This moral kind of paint∣ing
for the stage has been often compared to the paint∣ing
for cupolas and cielings, where the colours are
over-charged, and every part is drawn excessively
large, and beyond nature. The figures seem mon∣strous
and disproportioned, when seen too nigh; but
become natural and rengular, when set at a distance,
and placed in that point of view, in which they
are intended to be surveyed. For a like reason,
when characters are exhibited in theatrical represen∣tations,
the want of reality removes, in a manner,
the personages; and redering them more cold and
unentertaining, makes it necessary to compensate, by
the force of colouring, what they want in substance.
Thus we find in common life, that when a man
once allows himself to depart from truth in his nar∣rations,
he never can keep within bounds of pro∣bability;
<PB N="136" REF="135"/>
but adds still some new circumstance to ren∣der
his stories more marvellous, and to satisfy his
imagination. Two men in buckram suits became
eleven to Sir JOHN FALSTAFF before the end of his
story.</P>
<P>THERE is only one vice, which may be found
in life with as strong features, and a high a colour∣ing
as need be employed by any satyrist or comic
poet; and that is AVARICE. Every day we meet
with men of immense fortunes, without heirs, and
on the very brink of the grave, who refuse them∣selves
the most common necessaries of life, and go
on heaping possessions on possessions, under all the
real pressures of the severest poverty. An old usurer,
says the story, lying in his last agonies was presented
by the priest with the crucifix to worship. He opens
his eyes a moment before he expires, considers the
crucifix, and cries, <HI>These jewels are not true; I can
only lend ten pist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les upon such a pledge.</HI> This was pro∣bably
the invention of some epigrammatist; and yet
every one, from his own experience, may be able
to recollect almost as strong instances of perseverance
in avarice. 'Tis commonly reported of a famous
miser in this city, that finding himself near death,
he sent for some of the magistrates, and gave them
a bill of an hundred pounds, payable after his de∣cease;
which sum he intended should be disposed
of in charitable uses; but scarce were they gone,
<PB N="137" REF="136"/>
when he orders them to be called back, and offers
them ready money, if they would abate five pounds
of the sum. Another noted miser in the north, in∣tending
to defraud his heirs, and leave his fortune
to the building an hospital, protracted the drawing
of his will from day to day; and 'tis thought, that
if those interested in it had not paid for the draw∣ing
it, he had died intestate. In short, none of the
most furious excesses of love and ambition are in any
respet to be compared to the extremes of avarice.</P>
<P>THE best excuse that can be made for avarice is,
that it generally prevails in old men, or in men of
cold tempers, where all the other affections are ex∣tinct;
and the mind being incapable of remaining
without some passion or pursuit, at last find out this
monstrously absurd one, which suits the coldness and
inactivity of its temper. At the same time, it seems
very extraordinary, that so frosty, spiritless a passion
should be able to carry us farther than all the warmth
of youth and pleasure. But if we look more nar∣rowly
into the matter, we shall find, that this very
circumstance renders the explication of the case more
easy. When the temper is warm and full of vi∣gour,
it naturally shoots out more ways than one,
and produces inferior passions to counter-balance, in
some degree, its predominant inclination. 'Tis im∣possible
for a person of that temper, however bent
on any pursuit, to be deprived of all sense of shame,
<PB N="138" REF="137"/>
or all regard to the sentiments of mankind. His
friends must have some influence over him: And other
considerations are apt to have their weight. All this
serves to restrain him within some bounds. But 'tis
no wonder that the avaritious man, being, from the
coldness of his temper, without regard to reputation,
to friendship, or to pleasure, should be carried so far
by his prevailing inclination, and should display his
paffion in such surprizing instances.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find no vice so irreclaimable
as avarice: And tho' there scarcely has been a mo∣ralist
or philosopher, from the beginning of the world
to this day, who has not levelled a stroke at it, we
hardly find a single instance of any person's being
cured of it. For this reason, I am more apt to ap∣prove
of those, who attack it with wit and humour,
than of those who treat it in a serious manner. There
being so little hopes of doing good to the people
infected with this vice, I would have the rest of man∣kind,
at least, diverted by our manner of exposing
it: As indeed there is no kind of diversion, of which
they seem so willing to partake.</P>
<P>AMONG the fables of <HI>Monsieur de la</HI> MOTTE, there
is one levelled against avarice, which seems to me
more natural and easy, than most of the fables of
that ingenious author. A miser, says he, being dead,
and fairly interred, came to the banks of the STYX,
<PB N="139" REF="138"/>
desiring to be ferried over along with the other ghosts.
CHARON demands his fare, and is surprized to see
the miser, rather than pay it, throw himself into the
river, and swim over the other side, notwithstand∣ing
all the clamour and opposition that could be
made to him. All hell was in an uproar; and each
of the judges was meditating some punishment, suit∣able
to a crime of such dangerous consequence to the
infernal revenues. Shall he be chained to the rock
with PROMETHEUS? Or tremble below the preci∣pice
in company with the DANAIDES? Or assist SI∣SYPHUS
in rolling his stone? No, says MINOS, none
of these. We must invent some severer punishment.
Let him be sent back to the earth, to see the use his
heirs are making of his riches.</P>
<P>I HOPE it will not be interpreted as a design of
setting myself in opposition to this celebrated author,
if I proceed to deliver a fable of my own, which is
intended to expose the same vice of avarice. The
hint of it was taken from these lines of Mr. POPE.</P>
<Q><L>Damn'd to the mines, an equal fate betides</L>
<L>The slave that higs it, and the slave that bides.</L></Q>
<P>OUR old mother Earth once lodged in indictment
against AVARICE before the courts of heaven, for her
wicked and malicious council and advice, in tempting,
inducing, persuading, and traiterously seducing the
<PB N="140" REF="139"/>
children of the plaintiff to commit the detestable
crime of parricide upon her, and, mangling her body,
ransack her very bowels for hidden treasure. The
indictment was very long and verbose; but we must
omit a great part of the repetitions and synonymous
terms, not to tire our readers too much with our tale.
AVARICE, being called before JUPITER to answer to
this charge, had not much to say in her own defence.
The injury was clearly proved upon her. The fact,
indeed, was notorious, and the injury had been fre∣quently
repeated. When therefore the plaintiff de∣manded
justice, JUPITER very readily gave sentence
in her favour; and his decree was to this purpose,
That since dame <HI>Avarice,</HI> the desendant, had thus
grievously injured dame <HI>Earth,</HI> the plaintiff, she was
hereby ordered to take that treasure, of which she had
feloniously robbed the said plaintiff, by ransacking
her bosom, and in the same manner, as before, open∣ing
her bosom, restore it back to her, without dimu∣nition
to retention. From this sentence, it shall fol∣low,
says JUPITER to the by-standers, That, in all
future ages, the retainers of <HI>Avarice</HI> shall bury and
conceal their riches, and thereby restore to the earth
what they took from her.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the DIGNITY OF HUMAN NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain sects, which secretly form
themselves in the learned world, as well as
in the political; and tho' sometimes they come not
to an open rupture, yet they give a different turn
to the ways of thinking of those who have taken
party on either side. The most remarkable of this
kind are the sects, that are founded on the different
sentiments with regard to the <HI>dignity of human na∣ture;</HI>
which is a point that seems to have divided
philosophers and poets, as well as divines, from the
beginning of the world to this day. Some exalt our
species to the skies, and represent man as a kind of
human demi-god, who derives his origin from hea∣ven,
and retains evident marks of his lineage and
descent. Others insist upon the blind sides of
human nature, and can discover nothing, except va∣nity,
in which man surpasses the other animals, whom
he affects so much to despise. If an author pos∣sesses
the talent of rhetoric, and declamation, he com∣monly
<PB N="142" REF="141"/>
takes party with the former: If his turn lies
towards irony and ridicule, he naturally throws him∣self
into the other extreme.</P>
<P>I AM far from thinking, that all those, who have
depreciated human nature have been enemies to vir∣tue,
and have exposed the frailties of their fellow-creatures
with any bad intention. On the contrary,
I am sensible, that a very delicate sense of morals,
especially when attended with somewhat of the <HI>Mi∣santhrope,</HI>
is apt to give a man a disgust of the world,
and to make him consider the common course of hu∣man
affairs with too much spleen and indignation.
I must, however, be of opinion, that the sentiments
of those, who are inclined to think favourably of
mankind, are much more advantageous to virtue,
than the contrary principles which give us a mean
opinion of our nature. When a man is possessed of
a high notion of his rank and character in the crea∣tion,
he will naturally endeavour to act up to it,
and will scorn to do a base or vicious action, which
might sink him below that figure which he makes
in his own imagination. Accordingly we find, that
all our polite and fashionable moralists insist upon this
topic, and endeavour to represent vice as unworthy
of man, as well as odious in itself.</P>
<P>WOMEN are generally much more flattered in their
youth than men; which may proceed from this rea∣son,
<PB N="143" REF="142"/>
among others, that their chief point of honour
is considered as much more difficult than ours, and
requires to be supported by all that decent pride,
which can be instilled into them.</P>
<P>WE find very few disputes which are not found∣ed
on some ambiguity in the expression; and I am
persuaded, that the present dispute concerning the
dignity of human nature, is not more exempt from
it than any other. It may, therefore, be worth while
to consider, what is real, and what is only verbal
in this controversy.</P>
<P>THAT there is a natural difference betwixt merit
and demerit, virtue and vice, wisdom and folly, no
reasonable man will deny: but yet 'tis evident, that
in affixing the term, which denotes either our ap∣probation
or blame, we are commonly more influenced
by comparison than by any fixt unalterable standard
in the nature of things. In like manner, quantity,
and extension, and bulk, are by every one acknow∣ledged
to be real things: But when we call any ani∣mal
<HI>great</HI> or <HI>little,</HI> we always form a secret compa∣rison
between that animal and others of the same
species; and 'tis that comparison which regulates our
judgment concerning its greatness. A dog and a
horse may be of the very same size, while the
one is admired for the greatness of its bulk, and
the other for the smallness. When I am pre∣sent,
<PB N="144" REF="143"/>
therefore, at any dispute, I always consider with
myself, whether it be a question of comparison or
not that is the subject of the controversy; and if it
be, whether the disputants compare the same objects
together, or talk of things that are widely different.
As the latter is commonly the case, I have long since
learnt to neglect such disputes as manifest abuses of
leisure, the most valuable present that could be made
to mortals.</P>
<P>IN forming our notions of human nature, we are
very apt to make a comparison betwixt men and ani∣mals,
which are the only creatures endowed with
thought that fall under our senses. Certainly this
comparison is very favourable to mankind. On the
one hand we see a creature, whose thoughts are not li∣mited
by any narrow bounds, either of place or time;
who carries his researches into the most distant re∣gions
of this globe, and beyond this globe, to the
planets and heavenly bodies; looks backward to con∣sider
the first origin of human race; casts his eyes
forward to see the influence of his actions upon pos∣terity,
and the judgments which will be formed of
his character a thousand years hence; a creature, who
traces causes and effects to a great length and in∣tricacy;
extracts general principles from particular
appearances; improves upon his discoveries; corrects
his mistakes; and makes his very errors profitable.
On the other hand, we are presented with a crea∣ture
<PB N="145" REF="144"/>
the very reverse of this; limited in its obser∣vations
and reasonings to a very few sensible objects
which surround it; without curiosity, without fore∣fight;
blindly conducted by instinct, and attaining
in a very short time, its utmost perfection, beyond
which it is never able to advance a single step. What
a wide difference is there betwixt these creatures! And
how exalted a notion must we entertain of the former,
in comparison of the latter!</P>
<P>THERE are two means commonly employed to
destroy this conclusion: <HI>First,</HI> By making an unfair
representation of the case, and insisting only upon
the weaknesses of human nature. And <HI>secondly,</HI> By
forming a new and secret comparison between man
and beings of the most perfect wisdom. Among the
other excellencies of man, this is remarkable, that
he can form an idea of perfections much beyond
what he has experience of in himself; and is not
limited in his conception of wisdom and virtue. He can
easily exalt his notions and conceive a degree of knowlege,
which, when compared to his own, will make
the latter appear very contemptible, and will cause
the difference betwixt that and the sagacity of ani∣mals,
in a manner, to disappear and vanish. Now
this being a point, in which all the world is agreed,
that human understanding falls infinitely short of per∣fect
wisdom; 'tis proper we should know when this
comparison takes place, that we may not dispute, where
there is no real difference in our sentiments. Man falls
<PB N="146" REF="145"/>
much shorter of perfect wisdom, and even of his own
ideas of perfect wisdom, than animals do of man;
but yet the latter difference is so considerable, that no∣thing
but a comparison with the former, can make it
appcar of little moment.</P>
<P>“TIS also very usual to <HI>compare</HI> one man with an∣other;
and finding very few whom we can call <HI>wise</HI> or
<HI>virtuous,</HI> we are apt to entertain a contemptible notion
of our species in general. That we may be sensible
of the fallacy of this way of reasoning, we may ob∣serve,
that the honourable appellations of wise and
virtuous, are not annexed to any particular degree of
those qualities of <HI>wisdom</HI> and <HI>virtue;</HI> but arise altogether
from the comparison we make betwixt one man and
another. When we find a man, who arrives at such a
pitch of wisdom as is very uncommon, we pronounce
him a wise man: So that to say, there are few wise
men in the world, is really to say nothing; since 'tis
only by their scarcity, that they merit that ap∣pellation.
Were the lowest of our species as wise
as TULLY, or my lord BACON, we should still have
reason to say, that there are few wise men. For
in that case we should exalt our notions of wisdom,
and should not pay a singular honour to any one,
who was not singularly distinguished by his talents.
In like manner, I have heard it observed by thought∣less
people, that there are few women possessed of
beauty, in comparison of those who want it; not con∣sidering,
that we bestow the epithet of <HI>beautiful</HI> only
<PB N="147" REF="146"/>
on such as possess a degree of beauty, that is com∣mon
to them with a few. The same degree of beauty
in a woman is called deformity, which is treated as
real beauty in one of our sex.</P>
<P>AS 'tis usual, in forming a notion of our species,
to <HI>compare</HI> it with the other species above or below
it, or to compare the individuals of the species a∣mong
themselves; so we often compare together the
different motives or actuating principles of human
nature, in order to regulate our judgment concern∣ing
it. And indeed, this is the only kind of com∣parison
which is worth our attention, or decides any
thing in the present question. Were our selfish and
vicious principles so much predominant above our
social and virtuous, as is asserted by some philoso∣phers,
we ought undoubtedly to entertain a contemp∣tible
notion of human nature.</P>
<P>THERE is much of a dispute of words in all this
controversy. When a man denies the sincerity of all
public spirit or affection to a country and commu∣nity,
I am at a loss what to think of him. Per∣haps
he never felt this passion in so clear and dis∣tinct
a manner as to remove all his doubts concern∣ing
its force and reality. But when he proceeds
afterwards to reject all private friendship, if no in∣terest
or self-love intermixes itself; I am then con∣fident
that he abuses terms, and confounds the ideas
of things; since it is impossible for any one to be
<PB N="148" REF="147"/>
so selfish, or rather so stupid, as to make no diffe∣rence
between one man and another, and give no
preference to qualities, which engage his approba∣tion
and esteem. Is he also, say I, as insensible to
anger as he pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ends to be to friendship? And does
injury and wrong no more affect him than kind∣ness
or benefits? Impossible: He does not know him∣self:
He has forgot the movements of his mind;
or rather he makes use of a different language from
the rest of his countrymen, and calls not things
by their proper names. What say you of natural
affection? (I subjoin) Is that also a species of self-love?
Yes: All is self-love. <HI>Your</HI> children are loved
only because they are yours: <HI>Your</HI> friend for a like
reason: And <HI>your</HI> country engages you only so far
as it has a connexion with <HI>yourself.</HI> Were the idea
of self removed, nothing would affect you: You would
be altogether inactive and insensible: Or if you ever
gave yourself any movement, it would only be from
vanity, and a desire of fame and reputation to this
same self. I am willing, reply I, to receive your in∣terpretation
of human actions, provided you admit
the facts. That species of self-love, which displays
itself in kindness to others, you must allow to have
great influence, and even greater, on many occasions,
than that which remains in its original shape and
form. For how few are there, who, having a family,
children, and relations, do not spend more on the
maintenance and education of these than on their own
<PB N="149" REF="148"/>
pleasures? This, indeed, you justly observe, may pro∣ceed
from their self-love, since the prosperity of their
family and friends is one, or the chief of their plea∣sures,
as well as their chief honour. Be you also
one of these selfish men, and you are sure of every
one's good opinion and good will; or not to shock
your nice ears with these expressions, the self-love of
every one, and mine amongst the rest, will then in∣cline
us to serve you, and speak well of you.</P>
<P>IN my opinion, there are two things which have
led astray those philosophers, who have insisted so
much on the selfishness of man. In the <HI>first</HI> place,
they found, that every act of virtue or friendship was
attended with a secret pleasure: from whence they
concluded, that friendship and virtue could not be
difinterested. But the fallacy of this is obvious. The
virtuous sentiment or passion produces the pleasure,
and does not arise from it. I feel a pleasure in doing
good to my friend, because I love him; but do not
love him for the sake of that pleasure.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, it has always been found, that the
virtuous are far from being indifferent to praise; and
therefore they have been represented as a set of vain-glorious
men, who had nothing in view but the ap∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>auses
of others. But this also is a fallacy. 'Tis very
unjust in the world, when they find any tincture of
vanity in a laudable action, to depreciate it upon that
<PB N="150" REF="149"/>
account, or ascribe it entirely to that motive. The
cafe is not the same with vanity, as with other pas∣sions.
Where avarice or revenge enters into any
seemingly virtuous action, 'tis difficult for us to de∣termine
how far it enters, and 'tis natural to suppose
it the sole actuating principle. But vanity is so close∣ly
allied to virtue, and to love the fame of laudable
actions approaches so near the love of laudable actions
for their own sake, that these passions are more capa∣ble
of mixture, than any other kinds of affection; and
'tis almost impossible to have the latter without some
degree of the former. Accordingly we find, that this
passion for glory is always warped and varied accord∣ing
to the particular taste or sentiment of the mind
on which it falls. NERO had the same vanity in driv∣ing
a chariot, that TRAJAN had in governing the
empire with justice and ability. To love the glory of
virtuous actions is a sure proof of the love of virtuous
actions.</P>

<P>THOSE who employ their pens on political
subjects, free from party-rage, and party pre∣judices,
cultivate a science, which, of all others, con∣tributes
most to public utility, and even to the pri∣vate
satisfaction of those who addict themselves to the
study of it. I am apt, however, to entertain a sus∣picion,
that the world is still too young to fix many
general truths in politics, which will remain true to
the latest posterity. We have not as yet had ex∣perience
of above three thousand years; so that not
only the art of reasoning is still defective in this sci∣ence,
as well as in all others, but we even want suf∣ficient
materials upon which we can reason. 'Tis not
fully known, what degrees of refinement, either in
virtue or vice, human nature is susceptible of; nor,
what may be expected of mankind from any great
revolution in their education, customs or principles.
MACHIAVEL was certainly a great genius; but hav∣ing
<PB N="152" REF="151"/>
confined his study to the furious and tyrannical
governments of ancient times, or to the little disor∣derly
principalities of ITALY, his reasonings, espe∣cially
upon monarchical government, have been found
extremely defective; and there scarce is any maxim
in his <HI>prince,</HI> which subsequent experience has not en∣tirely
refuted. <HI>A weak prince,</HI> says he, <HI>is incapable
of receiving good counsel; for if he consult with seve∣ral,
he will not be able to choose among their different
counsels. If he abandon himself to one, that minister
may, perhaps, have capacity; but he will not be long
a minister: He will be sure to dispossess his master, and
place himself and his family upon the throne.</HI> I men∣tion
this, among innumerable instances, of the errors
of that politician, proceeding, in a great measure, from
his having lived in too early an age of the world, to
be a good judge of political truth. Almost all the
princes of EUROPE are at present governed by their
ministers; and have been so for near two centuries;
and yet no such event has ever happened, or can pos∣sibly
happen. SEJANUS might project dethroning
the CAESARS; but FLEURY, tho' ever so vicious, could
not, while in his senses, entertain the least hopes of
dispossessing the BOURBONS.</P>
<P>TRADE was never esteemed an affair of state, 'till
the last century; and there scarcely is any ancient
<PB N="153" REF="152"/>
writer on politics, who has made mention of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">XENOPHON mentions it; buy with a doubt if it be of any advantage to a state. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> XEN. HIERO. PLATO totally excludes it from his imaginary republic. De Legibus, lib. 4.</NOTE>.
Even the ITALIANS have kept a profound silence
with regard to it; tho' it has now excited the chief
attention, as well of ministers of state, as of specu∣lative
reasoners. The great opulence, grandeur, and
military atchievements of the two maritime powers,
seem first to have instructed mankind in the vast im∣portance
of an extensive commerce.</P>
<P>HAVING, therefore, intended in this essay to have
made a full comparison of civil liberty and absolute
government, and to have shewn the great advantages
of the former above the latter; I began to entertain
a suspicion, that no man in this age was sufficiently
qualified for such an undertaking; and that whatever
any one should advance on that head would, in all
probability, be refuted by further experience, and be
rejected by posterity. Such mighty revolutions have
happened in human affairs, and so many events have
arisen contrary to the expectation of the ancients, that
they are sufficient to beget the suspicion of still further
changes.</P>
<P>IT had been observed by the ancients, that all the
arts and sciences arose among free nations; and, that
<PB N="154" REF="153"/>
the PERSIANS and EGYPTIANS, notwithstanding all
their ease, opulence and luxury, made but faint ef∣forts
towards a relish in those finer pleasures, which
were carried to such perfection by the GREEKS,
amidst continual wars, attended with poverty, and
the greatest simplicity of life and manners. It had
also been observed, that as the GREEKS lost their
liberty, tho' they encreased mightily in riches, by
means of the conquest of ALEXANDER; yet the arts,
from that moment, declined among them, and have
never since been able to raise their head in that cli∣mate.
Learning was transplanted to ROME, the only
free nation at that time in the universe; and having
met with so favourable a soil, it made prodigious
shoots for above a century; till the decay of liberty
produced also the decay of letters, and spread a total
barbarism over the world. From these two experi∣ments,
of which each was double in its kind, and
shewed the fall of learning in despotic governments,
as well as its rise in popular ones, LONGINUS thought
himself sufficiently justified, in asserting, that the arts
and sciences could never flourish, but in a free go∣vernment:
and in this opinion, he has been followed
by several eminent writers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. ADDISON and lord SHAFTESBURY.</NOTE> in our own country, who
either confined their view merely to ancient facts, or
entertained too great a partiality in favour of that form
of government, which is established amongst us.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="154"/>
BUT what would these writers have said, to the in∣stances
of modern ROME and of FLORENCE? Of which
the former carried to perfection all the finer arts of
sculpture, painting and music, as well as poetry, tho'
they groaned under tyranny, and under the tyranny
of priests: While the latter made the greatest pro∣gress
in the arts and sciences, after they began to lose
their liberty by the usurpations of the family of ME∣DICIS.
ARIOSTO, TASSO, GALLILAEO, no more
than RAPHAEL, and MICHAEL ANGELO, were not
born in republics. And tho' the LOMBARD school
was famous as well as the ROMAN, yet the VENE∣TIANS
have had the smallest share in its honours, and
seem rather inferior to the other ITALIANS, in their
genius for the arts and sciences. RUBENS established
his school at ANTWERP, not at AMSTERDAM; DRES∣DEN,
not HAMBURGH, is the centre of politeness in
GERMANY.</P>
<P>BUT the most eminent instance of the flourishing
of learning in despotic governments, is that of
FRANCE, which scarce ever enjoyed any established
liberty, and yet has carried the arts and sciences as
near perfection as any other nation. The ENGLISH
are, perhaps, better philosophers; the ITALIANS
better painters and musicians; the ROMANS were great∣er
orators: But the FRENCH are the only people,
except the GREEKS, who have been at once philoso∣phers,
poets, orators, historians, painters, architects,
<PB N="156" REF="155"/>
sculptors, and musicians. With regard to the stage,
they have excelled even the GREEKS, who have far
excelled the ENGLISH. And, in common life, they
have, in a great measure, perfected that art, the most
useful and agreeable of any, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Art de Vivre,</HI> the art
of society and conversation.</P>
<P>IF we consider the state of the sciences and polite
arts in our own country, HORACE'S observation, with
regard to the ROMANS, may, in a great measure, be
applied to the BRITISH.</P>
<Q><L>—Sed in longum tamen aevum</L>
<L>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nserunt, hodieque manent <HI>vestigia ruris.</HI></L></Q>
<P>THE elegance and propriety of stile have been very
much neglected among us. We have no dictionary
of our language, and scarce a tolerable grammar.
The first polite prose we have, was wrote by a man
who is still alive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. SWIFT.</NOTE>. As to SPRAT, LOCKE, and even
TEMPLE, they knew too little of the rules of art to
be esteemed very elegant writers. The prose of BA∣CON,
HARRINGTON, and MILTON, is altogether
stiff and pedantic; tho' their sense be excellent. Men,
in this country, have been so much occupied in the
great disputes of <HI>Religion, Politics</HI> and <HI>Philosophy,</HI>
that they had no relish for the seemingly minute
observations of grammar and criticism. And tho'
<PB N="157" REF="156"/>
this turn of thinking must have considerably improved
our sense and our talent of reasoning beyond those of
other nations; it must be confessed, that even in those
sciences above-mentioned, we have not any standard-book,
which we can transmit to posterity: And the
utmost we have to boast of, are a few essays towards
a more just philosophy; which, indeed, promise very
much, but have not, as yet, reached any degree of
perfection.</P>
<P>IT has become an established opinion, that com∣merce
can never flourish but in a free government;
and this opinion seems to be founded on a longer and
larger experience than the foregoing, with regard to
the arts and sciences. If we trace commerce in its pro∣gress
thro' TYRE, ATHENS, SYRACUSE, CARTHAGE,
VENICE, FLORENCE, GENOA, ANTWERP, HOLLAND,
ENGLAND, &amp;c. we shall always find it to have fixt its
seat in free governments. The three greatest trading
towns now in the world, are LONDON, AMSTER∣DAM,
and HAMBURGH; all free cities, and prote∣stant
cities; that is, enjoying a double liberty. It
must, however, be observed, that the great jea∣lousy
entertained of late, with regard to the com∣merce
of FRANCE, seems to prove, that this maxim
is no more certain and infallible, than the foregoing,
and that the subjects of an absolute prince may become
our rivals in commerce, as well as in learning.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="157"/>
DURST I deliver my opinion in an affair of so
much uncertainty, I would assert, that, notwithstand∣ing
the efforts of the FRENCH, there is something
pernicious to commerce inherent in the very nature of
absolute government, and inseparable from it: Tho'
the reason I would assign for this opinion, is some∣what
different from that which is commonly insisted
on. Private property seems to me almost as secure in
a civilized EUROPEAN monarchy, as in a republic;
nor is danger much apprehended in such a govern∣ment,
from the violence of the sovereign; more than
we commonly dread harm from thunder, or earth∣quakes,
or any accident the most unusual and extra∣ordinary.
Avarice, the spur of industry, is so obsti∣nate
a passion, and works its way thro' so many real
dangers and difficulties, that 'tis not likely it will be
scared by an imaginary danger, which is so small,
that it scarce admits of calculation. Commerce there∣fore,
in my opinion, is apt to decay in absolute go∣vernments,
not because it is there less <HI>secure,</HI> but be∣cause
it is less <HI>honourable.</HI> A subordination of ranks
is absolutely necessary to the support of monarchy.
Birth, titles, and place, must be honoured above in∣dustry
and riches. And while these notions prevail,
all the considerable traders will be tempted to throw
up their commerce, in order to purchase some of those
employments, to which privileges and honours are
annexed.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="158"/>
SINCE I am upon this head of the alterations which
time has produced, or may produce in politics, I
must observe, that all kinds of government, free and
despotic, seem to have undergone, in modern times,
a great change to the better, with regard both to fo∣reign
and domestic management. The <HI>balance of
power</HI> is a secret in politics, fully known only to
the present age; and I must add, that the internal
POLICE of the state has also received great improve∣ments
within the last century. We are informed by
SALLUST, that CATALINE'S army was much aug∣mented
by the accession of the highwaymen about.
ROME; tho' I believe, that all of that profession, who
are at present dispersed over EUROPE, would not
amount to a regiment. In CICERO'S pleadings for
MILO, I find this argument, among others, made use
of to prove, that his client had not assassinated CLO∣DIUS.
Had MILO, said he, intended to have killed
CLODIUS, he had not attacked him in the day time,
and at such a distance from the city: He had way∣laid
him at night, near the suburbs, where it might
have been pretended, that he was killed by robbers;
and the frequency of the accident would have fa∣voured
the deceit. This is a surprizing proof of the
loose police of ROME, and of the number and force
of these robbers; since CLODIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Asc. Ped. in Orat. pro Milone.</NOTE> was at that time
attended with thirty slaves, who were compleatly arm∣ed,
<PB N="160" REF="159"/>
and sufficiently accustomed to blood and danger
in the frequent tumults excited by that seditious tri∣bune.</P>
<P>BUT tho' all kinds of government be improved in
modern times, yet monarchical government seems to
have made the greatest advances towards perfection.
It may now be affirmed of civilized monarchies,
what was formerly said in praise of republics alone,
<HI>that they are a government of Laws, not of men.</HI> They
are found susceptible of order, method, and constancy,
to a surprizing degree. Property is there secure; in∣dustry
encouraged; the arts flourish; and the prince
lives secure among his subjects, like a father among
his children. There are perhaps, and have been for
two centuries, near two hundred absolute princes,
great and small, in EUROPE; and allowing twenty
years to each reign, we may suppose, that there have
been in the whole two thousand monarchs or tyrants,
as the GREEKS would have called them: Yet of these
there has not been one, note even PHILIP II. of SPAIN,
so bad as TIEERIUS, CALIGULA, NERO, or DOMI∣TIAN,
who were sour in twelve amonst the ROMAN
emperors. It must, however, be confessed, that tho'
monarchical governments have approached nearer to
popular ones, in gentleness and stability; they are
still much inferior. Our modern education and cus∣toms
instil more humanity and moderation than the
<PB N="161" REF="160"/>
ancient; but have not as yet been able to overcome
entirely the disadvantages of that form of govern∣ment.</P>
<P>BUT here I must beg leave to advance a conjecture,
which seems very probable, but which posterity alone
can fully judge of. I am apt to think, that in mo∣narchical
governments there is a source of improve∣ment,
and in popular governments a source of dege∣neracy,
which in time will bring these species of go∣vernment
still nearer an equality. The greatest abuses
which arise in FRANCE, the most perfect model of
pure monarchy, proceed not from the number or
weight of the taxes, beyond what are to be met with
in free countries; but from the expensive, une∣qual,
arbitrary, and intricate method of levying them,
by which the industry of the poor, especially of the
peasants and farmers, is, in a great measure, discou∣raged,
and agriculture rendered a beggarly and slavish
employment. But to whose advantage do these abuses
tend? If to that of the nobility, they might be
esteemed inherent in that form of government; since
the nobility are the true supports of monarchy; and
'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their interest should be more consulted,
in such a constitution, than that of the people. But
the nobility are, in reality, the principal losers by
this oppression; since it ruins their estates, and beg∣gars
their tenants. The only gainers by it are the
<HI>Finançiers,</HI> a race of men rather odious to the nobi∣lity
<PB N="162" REF="161"/>
and the whole kingdom. If a prince or minister,
therefore, should arise endowed with sufficient discern∣ment
to know his own and the public interest, and
with sufficient force of mind to break thro' ancient
customs, we might expect to see these abuses reme∣died;
in which case, the difference betwixt their ab∣solute
government and our free one, would not appear
so considerable as at present.</P>
<P>THE source of degeneracy, which may be remark∣ed
in free governments, consists in the practice of con∣tracting
debt, and mortgaging the public revenues,
by which taxes may, in time, become altogether in∣tolerable,
and all the property of the state be brought
into the hands of the public. This practice is of
modern date. The ATHENIANS, tho' governed by
a republic, paid near two hundred <HI>per Cent.</HI> for those
sums of money, which any emergent occasion made
it necessary for them to borrow; as we learn from
XENOPHON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. Among the moderns, the DUTCH
first introduced the practice of borrowing great sums
at low interest, and have well nigh ruined themselves
by it. Absolute princes have also contracted debt;
but as an absolute prince may play the bankrupt when
<PB N="163" REF="162"/>
he pleases, his people can never be opprest by his
debts. In popular governments, the people, and
chiefly those who have the highest offices, being com∣monly
the public creditors, 'tis difficult for the state
to make use of this remedy, which, however it may
be sometimes necessary, is always cruel and barbarous.
This, therefore, seems to be an inconvenience, which
nearly threatens all free governments; especially our
own, at the present juncture of affairs. And what a
strong motive is this, to increase our frugality of the
public money; lest, for want of it, we be reduced,
by the multiplicity of taxes, to curse our free govern∣ment,
and wish ourselves in the same state of servi∣tude
with all the nations that surround us?</P>

<P>THOSE, who consider the periods and revo∣lutions
of human kind, as represented in his∣tory,
are entertained with a spectacle full of plea∣sure
and variety, and see, with surprize, the manners,
customs, and opinions of the same species suscetptible
of such prodigious changes in different periods of
time. It may, however, be observed, that in <HI>civil</HI>
history there is found a much greater uniformity than
in the history of learning and science, and that the
wars, negotiations, and politics of one age resemble
more those of another, than the taste, wit, and spe∣culative
principles. Interest and ambition, honour
and shame, friendship and enmity, gratitude and re∣venge,
are the prime movers in all public transac∣tions;
and these passions are of a very stubborn and
intractable nature, in comparison of the sentiments
and understanding, which are easily varied by educa∣tion
and example. The GOTHS were much more in∣ferior
<PB N="166" REF="164"/>
to the ROMANS, in taste and science, than in
courage and virtue.</P>
<P>BUT not to compare together nations so widely
different, that they may almost be esteemed of a dif∣ferent
species; it may be observed, that even this
latter period of human learning, is, in many respects,
of an opposite character to the ancient; and that if
we be superior in philosopy, we are still, notwith∣standing
all our refinements, much inferior in elo∣quence.</P>
<P>IN ancient times, no work of genius was thought
to require so great parts and capacity, as the speak∣ing
in public; and some eminent writers have pro∣nounced
the talents, even of a great poet or philo∣sopher,
to be of an inferior nature to those requisite
for such an undertaking. GREECE and ROME pro∣duced,
each of them, but one accomplished orator;
and whatever praises the other celebrated speakers
might merit, they were still esteemed much inferior to
these great models of eloquence. 'Tis observable,
that the ancient critics could scare find two orators in
any age, who deserved to be placed precisely in the
same rank, and possessed the same degree of merit.
CALVUS, CAELIUS, CURIO, HORTENSIUS, CAESAR
rose one above another: But the greatest of that age
was inferior to CICERO, the most eloquent speaker,
who had ever appeared in ROME. Those of fine tafte,
<PB N="167" REF="165"/>
however, pronounced this judgment of the ROMAN
orator, as well as of the GRECIAN, that both of them
surpassed in eloquence all that had ever appeared,
but that they were far from reaching the prefection of
their art, which was infinite, and not only exceeded
human force to attain, but human imagination to
conceive. CICERO declares himself dissatisfied with
his own performances; nay, even with those of DE∣MOSTHENIES.
<HI>Ita sunt avidae capaces mese aures,</HI>
says he, <HI>semper aliquid immensum, infinitumque de∣siderant.</HI></P>
<P>THIS single circumstance is sulfficient to make us
apprehend the wide difference between ancient and
modern eloquence, and let us see how much the lat∣ter
is inferior to the former. Of all the polite and
and learned nations, BRITAIN alone possesses a po∣pular
government, or admits into the legislature such
numerous assemblies as can be supposed to lie under
the dominion of eloquence. But what has BRITAIN
to boast of in this particular? In enumerating all
the great men, who have done honour to our country,
we exult in our poets and philosophers; but what
orators are ever mentioned? Or where are the mo∣numents
of their genius to be met with? There are
found indeed, in our histories, the names of several,
who directed the resolutions of our parliament: But
neither themselves nor others have taken the pains to
preserve their speeches; and the authority which they
<PB N="168" REF="166"/>
possessed seems to have been owing to their experi∣ence,
wisdom, or power, more than to their talents
for oratory. At present, there are above half a dozen
speakers in the two houses, who, in the judgment of
the public, have reached very near the same pitch of
eloquence; and no man pretends to give any one the
preference to the rest. This seems to me a certain
proof, that none of them have attained much beyond
a mediocrity in their art, and that the species of elo∣quence,
which they aspire to, gives no exercise to the
sublimer faculties of the mind, but may be reached
by ordinary talents and flight application. A hun∣dred
cabinet-makers in LONDON can work a table or
a chair equally well; but no one poet can write verses
with such spirit and elegance as Mr. POPE.</P>
<P>WE are told, that when DEMOSTHENES was to
plead, all ingenious men flocked to ATHENS from
the most remote parts of GREECE, as to the most
celebrated spectacle of the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Ne illud quidem intelligunt, non modo ita memoriae pro∣ditum esse, sed ita necesse fuisse, cum DEMOSTHENES dicturus esset, ut concursds, audiendi causa, ex tota GRICIA fierent.

you may see men sauntering in the court of requests,
while the most important debate is carrying on in the
two houses; and many do not think themselves suff∣ciently
<PB N="169" REF="167"/>
compensated, for the losing of their dinners,
by all the eloquence of our most celebrated speakers.
When old CIBBER is to act, the curiosity of several
is more excited, than when our prime minister is to
defend himself from a motion for his removal or im∣peachment.</P>
<P>EVEN a person unacquainted with the noble remains
of ancient orators, may judge, from a few strokes,
that the stile or species of their eloquence was infi∣nitely
more sublime than that which modern orators
aspire to. How absurd would it appear, in our tem∣perate
and calm speakers, to make use of an <HI>Apostro∣phe,</HI>
like that noble one of DEMOSTHENES, so much
celebrated by QUINCTILIAN and LONGINUS, when,
justifying the unsuccessful battle of CHAERONEA, he
breaks out, <HI>No, my Fellow-Citizens, No: You have
not erred. I sawear by the</HI> manes <HI>of those heroes, who
fought for the same cause in the plains of</HI> MARATHON
and PLATAEA. Who could now endure such a bold
and poetical figure, as that which CICERO employs,
after describing in the most tragical terms the cruci∣fixion

<P>SUITABLE to this vehemence of thought and ex∣pression,

represented.</P>
<P>ONE is somewhat at a loss what cause we may
ascribe so sensible a decline of eloquence in latter
ages. The genius of mankind, at all times, is, per∣haps,
equal: The moderns have applied themselves,
with great industry and success, to all the other arts
and sciences: And one of the most learned nations
of the universe possesses a popular government; a cir∣cumstance
which seems requisite for the full display of
these noble talents: But notwithstanding all these ad∣vantages,
our progress in eloquence is very inconsi∣derable,
in comparison of the advances, which we
have made in all the other parts of learning.</P>
<P>SHALL we assert, that the strains of ancient elo∣quence
are unsuitable to our age, and not to be imi∣tated
by modern orators? Whatever reasons may be
made use of to prove this, I am persuaded they will
be found, upon examination, to be unsound and un∣satisfactory.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> IT may be said, that in ancient times, du∣ring
the flourishing period of the GREEK and ROMAN
learning, the municipal laws, in every state were
but few and simple, and the decision of causes
<PB N="172" REF="170"/>
was, in a great measure, left to the equity and com∣mon
sense of the judges. The study of the laws was
not then a laborious occupation, requiring the drudg∣ery
of a whole life to finish it, and utterly incom∣patible
with every other study or profession. The
great statesment and generals among the ROMANS were
all lawyers; and CICERO, to shew the facility of ac∣quiring
this science declares, that in the midst of all
his occupations, he would undertake, in a few days,
to make himself a compleat civilian. Now, where
a pleader addresses himself to the equity of his judges,
he has much more room to display his eloquence,
than where he must draw his arguments from strict
laws, statutes, and precedents. In the former case,
many circumstances must be taken in, many personal
considerations regarded; and even favour and inclina∣tion,
which it belongs to the orator, by his art and
eloquence, to conciliate, may be disguised under the
appearance of equity. But how shall a modern law∣yer
have leisure to quit his toilsome occupations, in
order to gather the flowers of PARNASSUS? Or
what opportunity shall he have of displaying them,
amidst the rigid and subtile arguments, objections, and
replies, which he is obliged to make use of? The
greatest genius, and greatest orator, who should pre∣tend
to plead before the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> after a month's
study of the laws, would only labour to make him∣self
ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="171"/>
I AM ready to own, that this circumstance, of the
multiplicity and intricacy of laws, is a discouragement
to eloquence in modern times: But I assert, that it
will not account entirely for the decline of that noble
art. It may banish oratory from WESTMINSTER-HALL,
but not from either house of parliament.
Among the ATHENIANS, the AREOPAGITES expresly
forbad all allurements of eloquence; and some have
pretended that in the GREEK orations wrote in the
<HI>judiciary</HI> form, there is not such a bold and rhetorical
stile, as appears in the ROMAN. But to what a pitch
did the ATHENIANS carry their eloquence in the <HI>de∣liberative</HI>
kind, when affairs of state were canvassed,
and the liberty, happiness, and honour of the nation
were the subject of debate? Disputes of this na∣ture
elevate the genius above all others, and give the
fullest scope to eloquence; and such disputes are very
frequent in this nation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT may be pretended, that the decline of
eloquence is owing to the superior good sense of the
moderns, who reject with disdain, all those rhetorical
tricks, employed to seduce the judges, and will admit
of nothing but solid argument in any debate or deli∣beration.
If a man be accused of murder, the fact
must be proved by witnesses add evidence; and the
laws will afterwards determine the punishment of the
criminal. It would be ridiculous to describe, in strong
colours, the horror and cruelty of the action: To in∣troduce
<PB N="174" REF="172"/>
the relations of the dead; and, at a signal,
make them throw themselves at the feet of the judges,
imploring justice with tears and lamentations: And
still more ridiculous would it be, to employ a picture
representing the bloody deed, in order to move the
judges by the display of so tragical a spectacle: Tho'
we know, that this poor artifice was sometimes prac∣tised
by the pleaders of old<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">QUINTIL. lib. 6. cap. 1.</NOTE>. Now, banish the pa∣thetic
from public discourses, and you reduce the
speakers merely to modern eloquence; that is, to
good-sense, delivered in proper expressions.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it may be acknowledged, that our mo∣dern
customs, or our superior good-sense, if you will,
should make our orators more cautious and reserved
than the ancient, in attempting to inflame the pas∣sions,
or elevate the imagination of their audience:
But, I see no reason, why it should make them de∣spari
absolutely of succeeding in that attempt. It
should make them redouble their art, not abandon it
intirely. The ancient orators seems also to have been
on their guard against this jealousy of their audience;
but they took a different way of eluding it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">LONGINUS, cap. 15.</NOTE>. They
hurried away with such a torrent of sublime and pa∣thetic,
that they left their hearers no leisure to per∣ceive
the artifice, by which they were deceived. Nay,
<PB N="175" REF="173"/>
to consider the matter aright, they were not deceived
by any artifice. The orator, by the force of his own
genius and eloquence, first inflamed himself with an∣ger,
indignation, pity, sorrow; and then communi∣cated
those impetuous movements to his audience.</P>
<P>DOES any man pretend to have more good sense than
JULIUS CAESAR? Yet that haughty conqueror, we
know, was so subdued by the charms of CICERO's
eloquence, that he was, in a manner, constrained to
change his settled purpose and resolution, and to ab∣solve
a criminal, whom, before that orator pleaded,
he was determined to condemn.</P>
<P>SOME objections, I own, notwithstanding his vast
success, may lie against some passages of the ROMAN
orator. He is too florid and rhetorical: His figures
are too striking and palpable: His divisions drawn
chiefly from the rules of the school: And his wit dis∣dains
not always the artifice even of a pun, rhyme, or
jingle of words. The GRECIAN addressed himself
to an audience much less refined than the ROMAN se∣nate
or judges. The lowest vulgar of ATHENS were
his sovereigns, and the arbiters of his eloquence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The orators formed the taste of the ATHENIAN people, not the people of the orators. GORGIAS LEONTINUS was very taking with them, till they became a cquainted with a better man∣ner. His figures of speech, says DIODORUS SICULUS, his anti∣thefis, his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which are now despised, had a great effect upon the audience. Lib. 12. page 106. <HI>ex edi∣tione</HI> RHOD: 'Tis in vain therefore for modern orators to plead the taste of their hearers as an apology for their lame performances. It would be strange prejudice in favour of antiquity, not to allow a BRITISH parliament to be naturally superior in judgment and delicacy to an ATHENIAN mob.</NOTE>
<PB N="176" REF="174"/>
Yet is his manner much more chaste and austere than
that of the other. Could it be copied, its success
would be infallible over a modern assembly. 'Tis ra∣pid
harmony, exactly adjusted to the sense: 'Tis ve∣hement
reasoning, without any appearance of art:
'Tis disdain, anger, boldness, freedom, involved in
a continued stream of argument: And of all human
productions, the orations of DEMOSTHENES present
to us the models, which approach the nearest to per∣fection.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> IT may be pretended, that the disorders
of the ancient governments, and the enormous crimes,
of which the citizens were often guilty, afforded much
ampler matter for eloquence than can be met with
among the moderns. Were there no VERRES or CA∣TALINE,
there would be no CICERO. But that this
reason can have no great influence, is evident. 'Twould
be easy to find a PHILIP in modern times; but where
shall we find a DEMOSTHENES?</P>
<P>WHAT remains, then, but that we lay the blame
on the want of genius, or of judgment in our speak∣ers,
<PB N="177" REF="175"/>
who either found themselves incapable of reaching
the heights of ancient eloquence, or rejected all such
endeavours, as unsuitable to the spirit of modern as∣semblies?
A few successful attempts of this nature might
rouze up the genius of the nation, excite the emulation
of the youth, and accustom our ears to a more sublime
and more pathetic elocution, than what we have been
hitherto entertained with. There is certainly some∣thing
accidental in the first rise and the progress of
the arts in any nation. I doubt whether a very satis∣factory
reason can be given, why ancient ROME, tho'
it received all its arts from GREECE, could attain only
to a taste or relish of statuary, painting and architec∣ture,
without reaching the practice of these noble
arts: While modern ROME has been excited, by a few
remains found among the ruins of antiquity, and has
carried these arts to the greatest perfection. Had such
a cultivated genius for oratory, as WALLER's for
poetry, arisen, during the civil wars, when liberty be∣gan
to be fully established, and popular assemblies to
enter into all the most material points of govern∣ment;
I am persuaded so illustrious an example would
have given a quite different turn to BRITISH elo∣quence,
and made us reach the perfection of the an∣cient
model. Our orators would then have done ho∣nour
to their country, as well as our poets and phi∣losophers,
and BRITISH CICEROS have appeared as
well as BRITISH PLUTARCHS and VIRGILS.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="176"/>
I HAVE confest that there is something accidental in
the origin and progress of the arts in any nation; and
yet I cannot forbear thinking, that if the other learned
and polite nations of EUROPE had possest the same ad∣vantages
of a popular government, they would pro∣bably
have carried eloquence to a greater height than
it has yet reached in BRITAIN. The FRENCH ser∣mons,
especially those of FLECHIER and BOSSUET,
are much superior to the ENGLISH in this parti∣cular;
and in both of them are many strokes of the
most sublime poetry. None but private causes, in
that country, are ever debated before their parliament
or courts of judicature; but notwithstanding this dis∣advantage,
there appears a spirit of eloquence in ma∣ny
of their lawyers, which, with proper cultivation
and encouragement, might rise to the greatest height.
The pleadings of PATRU are very elegant, and give
us room to imagine what so fine a genius could have
performed in questions concerning public liberty or
slavery, peace or war, who exerts himself with such
success, in debates concerning the price of an old horse,
or a gossiping story of a quarrel betwixt an abbess and
her nuns. For 'tis remarkable, that this polite writer,
tho' esteemed by all the men of wit in his time, was
never employed in the most considerable causes of their
courts of judicature, but lived and died in poverty:
From an ancient prejudice industriously propagated by
the dunces in all countries, <HI>That a man of genius is
unfit for business.</HI> The disorders produced by the fac∣tions
<PB N="179" REF="177"/>
against cardinal MAZARINE, made the parlia∣ment
of PARIS enter into the discussion of public af∣fairs,
and during that short interval, there appeared
many symptoms of the revival of ancient eloquence.
The <HI>avocat general</HI> TALON, in an oration, invoked
on his knees, the spirit of St. LOUIS to look down
with compassion on his divided and unhappy people,
and to inspire them, from above, with the love of con∣cord
and unanimity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De RETZ's Memoirs.</NOTE>. The members of the FRENCH
academy have attempted to give us models of elo∣quence
in their harangues at their admittance: But,
having no subject to discourse upon, they have run al∣together
into a fulsome strain of panegyric and flat∣tery,
the most barren of all subjects. Their stile,
however, is commonly, on these occasions, very ele∣vated
and sublime, and might reach the greatest
heights, were it employed on a subject more favour∣able
and engaging.</P>
<P>THERE are some circumstances, I confess, in the
ENGLISH temper and genius, which are disadvanta∣geous
to the progress of eloquence, and render all
attempts of that kind more dangerous and difficult
among them than among any other nation. The
ENGLISH are conspicuous for <HI>good-sense,</HI> which makes
them very jealous of any attempts to deceive them
by the flowers of rhetoric and elocution. They are
<PB N="180" REF="178"/>
also peculiarly <HI>modest;</HI> which makes them consider it
as a piece of arrogance to offer any thing but reason
to public assemblies, or attempt to guide them by
passion or fancy. I may, perhaps, be allowed to add,
that the people in general are not remarkable for de∣licacy
of taste, or for sensibility to the charms of the
muses. Their <HI>musical parts,</HI> to use the expression of
a noble author, are but indifferent. Hence their co∣mic
poets, to move them, must have recourse to ob∣scenity;
their tragic poets to blood and slaughter:
And hence their orators, being deprived of any such
resource, have abandoned altogether the hopes of
moving them, and have confined themselves to plain
argument and reasoning.</P>
<P>THESE circumstances, joined to particular acci∣dents,
may, perhaps, have retarded the growth of
eloquence in this kingdom; but will not be able to
prevent its success, if ever it appear amongst us:
And one may safely pronounce, that this is a field, in
which the most flourishing laurels may yet be gathered,
if any youth of accomplished genius, thoroughly ac∣quainted
with all the polite arts, and not ignorant of
public business, should appear in parliament, and ac∣custom
our ears to an eloquence more commanding
and pathetic. And to confirm me in this opinion,
there occur two considerations, the one derived from
ancient, the other from modern times.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="179"/>
'TIS seldom or never found, when a false taste in
poetry or eloquence prevails among any people, that
it has been preferred to a true, upon comparison and
reflection. It commonly prevails merely from igno∣rance
of the true, and from the want of perfect mo∣dels,
to lead men into a juster apprehension, and more
refined relish of those productions of genius. When
<HI>these</HI> appear, they soon unite all suffrages in their fa∣vour,
and, by their natural and powerful charms, gain
over, even the most prejudiced, to the love and admi∣ration
of them. The principles of every passion, and
of every sentiment, is in every man; and when
touched properly, they rise to life, and warm the
heart, and convey that satisfaction by which a work
of genius is distinguished from the adulterate beauties
of a capricious wit and fancy. And if this observa∣tion
be true, with regard to all the liberal arts, it
must be peculiarly so, with regard to eloquence;
which, being merely calculated for the public, and
for men of the world, cannot, with any pretext of
reason, appeal from the people to more refined judges;
but must submit to the public verdict, without re∣serve
or limitation. Whoever, upon comparison, is
deemed by a common audience the greatest orator,
ought most certainly to be pronounced such, by men
of science and erudition. And tho' an indifferent
orator may triumph for a long time, and be esteemed
altogether perfect by the vulgar, who are satisfied
with his accomplishments, and know not in what he
<PB N="182" REF="180"/>
is defective: Yet, whenever the true genius arises, <HI>he</HI>
draws to him the attention of every one, and imme∣diately
appears superior to his rival.</P>
<P>NOW to judge by this rule, ancient eloquence, that
is, the sublime and passionate, is of a much juster
taste than the modern, or the argumentative and ra∣tional;
and, if properly executed, will always have
more command and authority over mankind. We are
satisfied with our mediocrity, because we have had no
experience of any thing better: But the ancients had
experience of both, and, upon comparison, gave the
preference to that kind, of which they have left us
such applauded models. For, if I am not mistaken,
our modern eloquence is of the same stile or species
with that which ancient criticks denominated ATTIC
eloquence, that is, calm, elegant and subtile, which
instructed the reason more than affected the passions,
and never raised its tone above argument or common
discourse. Such was the eloquence of LYSIAS among
the ATHENIANS, and of CALVUS among the RO∣MANS.
These were esteemed in their time; but when
compared with DEMOSTHENES and CICERO, were
eclipsed like a taper when set in the rays of a meri∣dian
sun. Those latter orators possessed the same ele∣gance
and subtilty, and force of argument, with the
former; but what rendered them chiefly admirable,
was that pathetic and sublime, which, on proper oc∣casions,
<PB N="183" REF="181"/>
they threw into their discourse, and by which
they commanded the resolutions of their audience.</P>
<P>OF this species of eloquence we have scarce had any
instances in BRITAIN, at least in our public speakers.
In our writers, we have had some instances, which
have met with great applause, and might assure our
ambitious youth of equal or superior glory in attempts
for the revival of ancient eloquence. Lord BOLING∣BROKE's
productions, with all their defects in argu∣ment,
method, and precision, contain a force and
energy, which our orators scarce ever aim at; tho'
'tis evident, that such an elevated stile has much bet∣ter
grace in a speaker than in a writer, and is assured
of more prompt and more astonishing success. 'Tis
there seconded by the graces of voice and action:
The movements are mutually communicated betwixt
the orator and the audience: And the very aspect of
a large assembly, attentive to the discourse of one
man, must inspire him with a peculiar elevation, suf∣ficient
to give a propriety to the strongest figures and
expressions. 'Tis true, there is a great prejudice
against <HI>set-s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeches;</HI> and a man can scarce escape ridi∣cule,
who repeats a discourse as a school-boy his les∣son,
and takes no notice of any thing which has been
advanced in the course of the debate. But where is
the necessity of falling into this absurdity? A public
speaker must know beforehand the question under de∣bate.
<PB N="184" REF="182"/>
He may compose all the arguments, objections,
and answers, such as he thinks will be most proper
for his discourse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The first of the ATHENIANS, who composed and wrote his speeches, was PERICLES, a man of business and a man of sense, if ever there was one, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Suidas in <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. If any thing new occur, he may
supply it from his invention; nor will the difference
be very apparent between his elaborate and his ex∣temporary
compositions. The mind naturally conti∣nues
with the same <HI>impetus</HI> or <HI>force,</HI> which it has ac∣quired
by its motion; as a vessel, once impelled by
the oars, carries on its course for some time, when
the original impulse is suspended.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this subject with observing, that
even tho' our modern orators should not elevate their
stile or aspire to a rivalship with the antient; yet
there is a material defect in most of their speeches,
which they might correct, without departing from
that composed air of argument and reasoning, to
which they limit their ambition. Their great affecta∣tion
of extemporary discourses has made them reject
all order and method, which seems so requisite to ar∣gument,
and without which 'tis scarce possible to pro∣duce
an entire conviction on the mind. 'Tis not,
that one would recommend many formal divisions in
a public discourse, unless the subject very evidently
<PB N="185" REF="183"/>
offer them: But 'tis easy, without this formality, to
observe a method, and make that method conspicu∣ous
to the hearers, who will be infinitely pleased to
see the arguments rise naturally from one another,
and will retain a more thorough persuasion, than can
arise from the strongest reasons, which are thrown to∣gether
in confusion.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the RISE and PROGRESS of the ARTS and
SCIENCES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing which requires greater nicety,
in our enquities concerning human affairs,
than to distinguish exactly what is owing to <HI>chance,</HI>
and what proceeds from <HI>causes;</HI> nor is there any sub∣ject,
in which an author is more liable to deceive
himself, by false subtilties and refinements. To say,
that any event is derived from chance, cuts short all
farther enquiry concerning it, and Ieaves the writer
in the same state of ignorance with the rest of man∣kind.
But when the event is supposed to proceed
from certain and stable causes, he may then display his
ingenuity, in assigning these causes; and as a man of
any subtilty can never be at a loss in this particular,
he has thereby an opportunity of swelling his vo∣lumes,
and discovering his profound knowledge in
observing what escapes the vulgar and ignorant.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="185"/>
THE distinguishing between chance and causes
must depend upon every particular man's sagacity, in
considering every particular incident. But, if I were
to assign any general rule to help us in applying this
distinction, it would be the following, <HI>What depends
upon a few persons is, in a great measure, to be ascribed
to chance, or secret and unknown causes: What arises
from a great number, may often be accounted for by de∣terminate
and known causes.</HI></P>
<P>THERE may two very natural reasons be as∣signed
for this rule. <HI>First,</HI> If you suppose a dye to
have any byass, however small, to a particular side,
this byass, tho' perhaps, it may not appear in a few
throws, will certainly prevail in a great number, and
will cast the balance entirely to that side. In like
manner, when any <HI>causes</HI> beget a particular inclina∣tion
or passion, at a certain time, and among a cer∣tain
people; tho' many individuals may escape the'
contagion, and be ruled by passions peculiar to them∣selves;
yet the multitude will certainly be infected
with the common passion, and be governed by it in all
their actions.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THOSE principles or causes, which are
fitted to operate on a multitude, are always of a
grosser and more stubborn nature, less subject to acci∣dents,
and less influenced by whim and private fancy,
than those which operate on a few only. The latter
<PB N="189" REF="186"/>
are commonly so delicate and refined, that the small∣est
incident in the health, education, or fortune of a
particular person, is sufficient to divert their course,
and retard their operation; nor is it possible to re∣duce
them to any general maxims or observations.
Their influence at one time will never assure us con∣cerning
their influence at another; even tho' all the
general circumstances should be the same in both
cases.</P>
<P>TO Judge by this rule, the domestic and the gra∣dual
revolutions of a state, must be a more proper sub∣ject
of reasoning and observation, than the foreign
and the violent, which are commonly produced by
single persons, and are more influenced by whim, folly
or caprice, than by general passions and interests.
The depression of the lords, and rise of the commons
in ENGLAND, after the statutes of alienation, and the
increase of trade and industry, are more easily ac∣counted
for by general principles, than the depres∣sion
of the SPANISH, and rise of the FRENCH mo∣narchy,
after the death of CHARLES QUINT. Had
HARRY IV. Cardinal RICHELIEU, and LOUIS XIV.
been SPANIARDS; and PHILIP II, III, and IV, and
CHARLES II. been FRENCHMEN, the history of these
two nations had been intirely reversed.</P>
<P>FOR the same reason, 'tis more easy to account for
the rise and progress of commerce in any kingdom,
<PB N="190" REF="187"/>
than for that of learning; and a state, which should
apply itself to the encouragement of the one, would
be much more assured of success, than one which
should cultivate the other. Avarice, or the desire of
gain, is an universal passion, which operates at all
times, in all places, and upon all persons: But curi∣osity,
or the love of knowledge, has a very limited
influence, and requires youth, leisure, education, ge∣nius,
and example, to make it govern any person.
You will never want booksellers, while there are buy∣ers
of books: But there may frequently be readers,
where there are are no authors. Multitudes of peo∣ple,
necessity and liberty, have begot commerce in
HOLLAND: But study and application have scarce
produced any eminent writers.</P>
<P>WE may, therefore, conclude, that there is no sub∣ject,
in which we must proceed with more caution,
than in tracing the history of the arts and sciences;
lest we assign causes which never existed, and reduce
what is merely contingent to stable and universal
principles. Those, who cultivate the sciences in any
state, are always few in number: The passion, which
governs them, limited: Their taste and judgment
tender and easily perverted: And their application
disturbed with the smallest accident. Chance, there∣fore,
or secret and unknown causes, must have a great
influence on the rise and progress of all the refined
arts.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="188"/>
BUT there is a reason, which induces me not to
ascribe the matter altogether to chance. Tho' the
persons, who cultivate the sciences with such astonish∣ing
success, as to attract the admiration of posterity,
be always few, in all nations and all ages; 'tis im∣possible
but a share of the same spirit and genius must
be antecedently diffused thro' the people among whom
they arise, in order to produce, form, and cultivate,
from their earliest infancy, the taste and judgment of
those eminent writers. The mass cannot be altoge∣ther
insipid, from which such refined spirits are ex∣tracted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Est Deus in nobis; agitante calescimus illo: Impetus hic, sacrae semina mentis habet, OVID. <HI>Fast. Lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE>.
<HI>There is a God within us,</HI> says OVID, <HI>who
breathes that divine air by which we are animated.</HI>
Poets, in all ages, have advanced this claim to inspi∣ration.
There is not however any thing supernatural
in the case. Their fire is not kindled from heaven.
It only runs along the earth; is caught from one
breast to another; and burns brightest, where the
materials are best prepared, and most happily dispo∣sed.
The question, therefore, concerning the rise
and progress of the arts and sciences, is not altoge∣ther
a question concerning the taste, genius, and spirit
of a few, but concerning those of a whole people;
and may, therefore, be accounted for, in some mea∣sure,
by general causes and principles. I grant, that
a man, who should inquire, why such a particular
<PB N="192" REF="189"/>
poet, as HOMER, for instance, existed, at such a
place, in such a time, would throw himself headlong
into chimaera, and could never treat of such a subject,
without a multitude of false subtilties and refinements.
He might as well pretend to give a reason, why such
particular generals, as FABIUS and SCIPIO, lived in
ROME at such a time, and why FABIUS came into
the world before SCIPIO. For such incidents as
those, no other reason can be given but that of HO∣RACE.</P>
<Q><L>Scit genius, natale comes, qui temperat astrum,</L>
<L>Naturae Deus humanae, mortalis in unum—</L>
<L>—Qucdque caput, vultu mutabilis, albus &amp; ater.</L></Q>
<P>BUT I am persuaded, that in many cases very good
reasons might be given, why such a nation is more
polite and learned, at a particular time, than any of
its neighbours. At least, this is is so curious a sub∣ject,
that it were a pity to abandon it intirely, before
we have found, whether or not it be suscepible of
reasoning, and can be reduced to any general prin∣ciples.
I shall therefore proceed to deliver a few ob∣servations
on this subject, which I submit, with intire
deference, to the censure and examination of the
learned.</P>
<P><HI>MY first observation is,</HI> That it is impossible for the
arts and sciences to arise, at first, among any people, un∣less
<PB N="193" REF="190"/>
that people enjoy the blessing of a free govern∣ment.</P>
<P>IN the first ages of the world, when men are as
yet barbarous and ignorant, they seek no farther se∣curity
against mutual violence and injustice, than the
choice of some rulers, few or many, in whom they
place an implicite confidence, without providing any
security, by laws or political institutions, against the
violence and injustice of these rulers. If the autho∣rity
be centred in a single person, and if the people,
either by conquest, or by the ordinary course of pro∣pagation,
increase to a great multitude, the monarch,
finding it impossible, in his own person, to execute
every office of sovereignty, in every place, must dele∣gate
his authority to inferior magistrates, who preserve
peace and order in their particular districts. As expe∣rience
and education have not yet refined the judge∣ments
of men to any considerable degree, the prince,
who is himself unrestrained, never dreams of restrain∣ing
his ministers, but delegates his full authority to
every one, whom he sets over any portion of the peo∣ple.
All general laws are attended with inconve∣niencies,
when applied to particular cases; and it re∣quires
great penetration and experience, both to per∣ceive
that these inconveniencies are fewer than what
result from full discretionary powers in every magis∣trate;
and also, to discern what general laws are, upon
the whole, attended with fewest inconveniencies.
<PB N="194" REF="191"/>
This is a matter of so great difficulty, that men may
have made some advances, even in the sublime arts of
poetry and eloquence, where a rapidity of genius and
imagination assists their progress, before they have ar∣rived
at any great refinement in their municipal laws,
where frequent trials, and diligent observation, can
alone direct their improvements. It is not, there∣fore,
to be supposed, that a barbarous monarch, un∣restrained
and uninstructed, will ever become a legis∣lator,
or think of restraining his <HI>Bashaws</HI> in every
province, or even his <HI>Cadis</HI> in every village. We
are told, that the late <HI>Czar,</HI> tho' actuated with a no∣ble
genius, and smit with the love and admiration of
EUROPEAN arts; yet professed an esteem for the
TURKISH policy in this particular, and approved of
such summary decisions of causes, as are practised in
that barbarous monarchy, where the judges are not
restrained by any methods, forms, or laws. He did
not perceive, how contrary such a practice would have
been to all his other endeavours for refining his peo∣ple.
Arbitrary power, in all cases, is somewhat op∣pressive
and debasing; but 'tis altogether ruinous and
intolerable, when contracted into a small compass;
and becomes still worse, when the person, who pos∣sesses
it, knows that the time of his authority is limit∣ed
and uncertain. <HI>Habet subjectos tanquam suos; viles,
ut alienos</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TACIT. Hist. lib. 1.</NOTE>. He governs the subjects with full autho∣rity,
<PB N="195" REF="192"/>
as if they were his own; and with negligence
or tyranny, as belonging to another. A people go∣verned
after such a manner are slaves in the full and
proper sense of the word; and 'tis impossible they can
ever aspire to any refinements of taste or reason. They
dare not so much as pretend to enjoy the necessaries
of life in plenty or security.</P>
<P>TO expect, therefore, that the arts and sciences
should take their first rise in a monarchy, is to expect
a contradiction. Before these refinements have taken
place, the monarch is ignorant and uninstructed; and,
not having knowledge sufficient to make him sensible
of the necessity of balancing his government upon
general laws, he delegates his full powers to all infe∣rior
magistrates. This barbarous policy debases the
people, and for ever prevents all improvement. Were
it possible, that, before science was known in the
world, a monarch could possess so much wisdom as to
become a legislator, and govern his people by law,
not by the arbitrary will of their fellow subjects, it
might be possible for that species of government to be
the first nursery of arts and sciences. But in that sup∣position
there seems to be a manifest contradiction.</P>
<P>IT may happen, that a republic, in its infant state,
may be supported by as few laws as a barbarous mo∣narchy,
and may entrust as unlimited an authority to
its magistrates or judges. But, besides that the fre∣quent
<PB N="196" REF="193"/>
elections of these magistrates by the people, are
a considerable check upon their authority; 'tis im∣possible,
but, in time, the necessity of restraining the
magistrates, in order to preserve liberty, must at last
appear, and give rise to general laws and statutes.
The ROMAN Consuls, for some time, decided all cau∣ses,
without being confined by any positive statutes,
till the people, bearing this yoke with impatience,
created the <HI>decemvirs,</HI> who promulgated the <HI>twelve
tables;</HI> a body of laws, which, tho', perhaps, they
were not equal in bulk to one ENGLISH act of parlia∣ment,
were almost the only written rules which regu∣lated
property and punishment, for some ages, in that
famous republic. They were, however, sufficient,
together with the forms of a free government, to se∣cure
the lives and properties of the citizens; to ex∣empt
one man from the dominion of another; and
to protect every one against the violence or tyranny of
his fellow citizens. In such a situation the sciences
may raise their heads, and flourish: But never can
have being amidst such a scene of oppression and sla∣very,
as always results from barbarous monarchies,
where the people alone are restrained by the authority
of the magistrates, and the magistrates are not restrain∣ed
by any law or statute. An unlimited despotism of
this nature, while i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exists, effectually puts a stop to
all improvements, and keeps men from attaining that
knowledge, which is requisite to instruct them in the
<PB N="197" REF="194"/>
advanttages arising from a better police, and more
moderate authority.</P>
<P>HERE then are the advantages of republics. Tho'
a republic should be barbarous, it necessarily, by an
infallible operation, gives rise to LAW, even before
mankind have made any considerable advances in the
other sciences. From law arises security: From se∣curity
curiosity: And from curiosity knowledge. The
latter steps of this progress may be more accidental;
but the former are altogether necessary. A republic,
without laws, can never have any duration. On the
contrary, in a monarchical government, law arises
not necessarily from the forms of the government.
Monarchy, when absolute, contains even something
repugnant to law. Great wisdom and reflexion can
alone reconcile them. But such a degree of wisdom
can never be expected, before the greater refinements
and improvements of human reason. These refine∣ments
require curiosity, security, and law. The <HI>first</HI>
growth, therefore, of the arts and sciences can never
be expected in despotic governments.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the necessary progress of things,
law must precede science. In republics law may pre∣cede
science, and may arise from the very nature of
the government. In monarchies it arises not from
the nature of the government, and cannot precede
science. An absolute prince, who is barbarous, ren∣ders
<PB N="198" REF="195"/>
all his ministers and magistrates as absolute as
himself: And there needs no more to prevent, for
ever, all industry, curiosity, and science.</P>
<P>THERE are other causes which discourage the rise
of the refined arts in despotic governments; tho' I
take the want of laws, and the delegation of full
powers to every petty magistrate, to be the principal.
Eloquence certainly arises more naturally in popular
governments: Emulation too, in every accomplish∣ment,
must there be more animated and enlivened:
And genius and capacity have a fuller scope and ca∣reer.
All these causes render free governments the
only proper <HI>nursery</HI> for the arts and sciences.</P>
<P>THE next observation which I shall make on this
head, is, <HI>That nothing is more favourable to the rise of
politeness and learning, than a number of neighbouring
independent states connected together by commerce and
policy.</HI> The emulation, which naturally arises among
those neighbouring states, is an obvious source of
improvement: But what I would chiefly insist on is
the stop, which such limited territories give both to
<HI>power</HI> and to <HI>authority.</HI></P>
<P>EXTENDED governments, where a single person has
great influence, become soon despotic; but small
ones change naturally into commonwealths. A large
government is accustomed by degrees to tyranny;
<PB N="199" REF="196"/>
because each act of violence is at first performed up∣on
a part, which, being distant from the majority, is
not taken notice of, nor excites any violent ferment.
Besides, a large government, tho' the whole be dis∣contented,
may, by a little art, be kept in obedience;
while each part, ignorant of the resolutions of the
rest, is afraid to begin any commotion or insurrection.
Not to mention, that there is a superstitious reverence
for princes, which mankind naturally fall into when
they do not often see the sovereign, and when many
of them become not acquainted with him, so as to
perceive his weaknesses. And as large states can af∣ford
a great expence, in order to support the pomp,
of majesty; this is a kind of fascination on mankind,
and naturally contributes to the enslaving them.</P>
<P>IN a small government, any act of oppression is
immediately known thro' the whole: The murmurs
and discontents, proceeding from it, are easily commu∣nicated:
And the indignation rises the higher, that
the subjects are not apt to apprehend in such states,
that the distance is very wide between themselves and
their sovereign. “No man,” said the prince DE
CONDE, “is a hero to his <HI>Valet de Chambre.</HI>” 'Tis
certain, that admiration and acquaintance are altoge∣ther
incompatible towards any mortal creature. Sleep
and love convinced ALEXANDER that he was not a
God: But I suppose that such as attended him daily
could easily, from the numberless weaknesses to which
<PB N="200" REF="197"/>
he was subject, have given him many other still more
convincing proofs of his humanity.</P>
<P>BUT the divisions into small states are favourable to
learning, by stopping the progress of <HI>authority</HI> as well
as that of <HI>power,</HI> Reputation is often as great a fas∣cination
upon power as sovereignty, and is equally
destructive to the freedom of thought and examina∣tion.
But where a number of neighbouring states
have a great intercourse of arts and commerce, their
mutual jealousy keeps them from receiving too lightly
the law from each other, in matters of taste or of rea∣soning,
and makes them examine every work of art
with the greatest care and accuracy. The contagion
of popular opinions spreads not so easily from one
place to another. It readily receives a check in some
state or other, where it concurs not with the prevail∣ing
prejudices. And nothing but nature and reason,
or at least, what bears them a strong resemblance, can
force its way thro' all obstacles, and unite the most
rival nations into an esteem and admiration of it.</P>
<P>GREECE was a cluster of little principalities, which
soon became republics; and being united both by
their near neighbourhood, and by the ties of the
same language and interest, they entered into the clo∣sest
intercourse of commerce and of learning. There
concurred a happy climate, a soil not unfertile, and a
most harmonious and comprehensive language; so that
<PB N="201" REF="198"/>
every circumstance among that people seemed to fa∣vour
the rise of the arts and sciences. Each city pro∣duced
its several artists and philosophers, who refused
to yield the preference to those of the neighbouring
republics: Their contentions and debates sharpened
the wits of men: A variety of objects was presented
to the judgment, while each challenged the preference
to the rest: And the sciences, not being dwarfed by
the restraint of authority, were enabled to make such
considerable shoots, as are, even at this time, the ob∣jects
of our admiration. After the ROMAN <HI>christian</HI>
or <HI>catholic</HI> church had spread itself over the civilized
world, and had engrossed all the learning of the
times; being really one large state within itself, and
united under one head; this variety of sects imme∣diately
disappeared, and the PERIPATETIC philo∣sophy
was alone admitted into all the schools, to the
utter depravation of every kind of learning. But
mankind having, at length, thrown off this yoke,
affairs are now returned nearly to the same situation
as before, and EUROPE is at present a copy at large,
of what GREECE was formerly a pattern in minia∣ture.
We have seen the advantage of this situation in
several instances. What checked the progress of the
CARTESIAN philosophy, to which the FRENCH na∣tion
shewed such a strong propensity towards the end
of the last century, but the opposition made to it by
the other nations of EUROPE, who soon discovered
the weak sides of that philosophy? The severest scru∣tiny,
<PB N="202" REF="199"/>
which NEWTON's theory has undergone, pro∣ceeded
not from his countrymen, but from foreigners;
and if it can overcome the obstacles which it meets
with at present in all parts of EUROPE, it will pro∣bably
go down triumphant to the latest posterity.
The ENGLISH are become sensible of the scandalous
licentiousness of their stage, from the example of the
FRENCH decency and morals. The FRENCH are con∣vinced,
that their theatre has become somewhat ef∣feminate,
by too much love and gallantry; and begin
to approve of the more masculine taste of some
neighbouring nations.</P>
<P>IN CHINA there seems to be a pretty considerable
stock of politeness and science, which, in the course
of so many centuries, might naturally be expected to
ripen into something more perfect and finished, than
what has yet arisen from them. But CHINA is one
vast empire, speaking one language, governed by one
law, and sympathizing in the same manners. The
authority of any teacher, such as CONFUCIUS, was
propagated easily from one corner of the empire to
another. None had courage to resist the torrent of
popular opinion. And posterity were not bold enough
to dispute what had been universally received by their
ancestors. This seems to be one natural reason, why
<PB N="203" REF="200"/>
the sciences have made so slow a progress in that
mighty empire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it be asked how we can reconcile to the foregoing prin∣ciples the happiness, riches, and good police of the CHINESE, who have always been governed by a sole monarch, and can scarce form an idea of a free government; I would answer, that tho' the CHINESE government be a pure monarchy, it is not, properly speaking, absolute. This proceeds from a peculiarity of the situation of that country: They have no neighbours, ex∣cept the TARTARS, from whom they were, in some measure secured, at least seemed to be secured, by their famous wall, and by the great superiority of their numbers. By this means, mili∣tary discipline has always been much neglected amongst them; and their standing forces are mere militia, of the worst kind; and unfit to suppress any general insurrection in countries so ex∣tremely populous. The sword, therefore, may properly be said to be always in the hands of the people, which is a sufficient restraint upon the monarch, and obliges him to lay his <HI>manda∣rins</HI> or governors of provinces under the restraint of general laws, in order to prevent those rebellions, which we learn from history to have been so frequent and dangerous in that government. Perhaps, a pure monarchy of this kind, were it fitted for a de∣fence against foreign enemies, would be the best of all govern∣ments, as having both the tranquillity attending kingly power, and the moderation and liberty of popular assemblies.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF we consider the face of the globe, EUROPE, of
all the four parts of the world, is the most broken by
seas, rivers, and mountains; and GREECE of all
countries of EUROPE. Hence these regions were na∣turally
<PB N="204" REF="201"/>
turally divided into several distinct governments. And
hence the sciences arose in GREECE; and EUROPE
has been hitherto the most constant habitation of
them.</P>
<P>I HAVE sometimes been inclined to think, that in∣terruptions
in the periods of learning, were they not
attended with such a destruction of ancient books, and
the records of history, would be rather favourable to
the arts and sciences, by breaking the progress of au∣thority,
and dethroning the tyrannical usurpers over
human reason. In this particular, they have the same
influence, as interruptions in political governments
and societies. Consider the blind submission of the
ancient philosophers to the several masters in each
school, and you will be convinced, that no good could
ever be expected from an hundred centuries of such a
servile philosophy. Even the ECLECTIC<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who arose
about the age of AUGUSTUS, notwithstanding their
professing to chuse freely what pleased them from
every different sect, were yet, in the main, as slavish
and dependent as any of their brethren; since they
sought for truth, not in nature, but in the several
schools; where they supposed she must necessarily be
found, tho' not united in a body, yet dispersed in
parts. Upon the revival of learning, those sects of
STOICS and EPICUREANS, PLATONISTS, and PY∣THAGOREANS,
could never regain any credit or au∣thority;
and, at the same time, by the example of
<PB N="205" REF="202"/>
their fall, kept men from submitting, with such blind
deference, to those new sects, which have attempted
to gain an ascendant over them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>third</HI> observation, which I shall form on this
head, of the rise and progress of the arts and sciences,
is, <HI>That tho' the only proper</HI> Nursery <HI>of these noble
plants be a free government, yet they may be transplant∣ed
into any government; and that a republic is most
favourable to the growth of the sciences, and a civi∣lized
monarchy to that of the polite arts.</HI></P>
<P>To balance a large state or society, whether mo∣narchical
or republican, on general laws, is a work
of so great difficulty, that no human genius, how∣ever
comprehensive, is able, by the mere dint of rea∣son
and reflection, to effect it. The judgments of
many must unite in this work: Experience must guide
their labour: Time must bring it to perfection: And
the feeling of inconveniencies must correct the mis∣takes,
which they inevitabily fall into, in their first
trials and experiments. Hence the impossibility ap∣pears,
that this undertaking should be begun and
carried on in any monarchy; since such a form of
government, ere civilized, knows no other secret in
policy, than that of entrusting unlimited powers with
every governor or magistrate, and subdividing the
people into so many classes and orders of slavery.
From such a situation, no improvements can ever be
<PB N="206" REF="203"/>
expected in the sciences, in the liberal arts, in laws,
and scarce in the manual arts or manufactures. The
same barbarism and ignorance, with which the go∣vernment
commences, is propagated to all posterity,
and can never come to a period by the efforts or inge∣nuity
of such unhappy slaves.</P>
<P>BUT tho' law, the source of all security and hap∣piness,
arises late in any government, and is the slow
product of order and of liberty, it is not preserved
with the same difficulty, with which it is produced;
but when it has once taken root, is a hardy plant,
which will scarce ever perish thro' the ill culture of
men, or the rigour of the seasons. The arts of luxu∣ry,
and much more the liberal arts, which depend
on a refined taste or sentiment, are easily lost; be∣cause
they are always relished by a few only, whose
leisure, fortune and genius fit them for such amuse∣ments.
But what is profitable to every mortal, and
in common life, when once discovered, can scarce
ever perish, but by the total subversion of society,
and by such furious inundations of barbarous inva∣ders,
as obliterate all memory of former arts and
civility. Imitation also is apt to transport these
coarser and more useful arts from one climate to an∣other,
and make them precede the refined arts in
their progress; tho' perhaps they sprang after them
in their first rise and propagation. From these causes
proceed civilized monarchies, where the arts of go∣vernment,
<PB N="207" REF="204"/>
first invented in free states, are preserved
to the mutual advantage and security of sovereign
and subject.</P>
<P>HOWEVER perfect, therefore, the monarchical
form may appear to some politicians, it owes all its
perfection to the republican; nor is it possible, that
a pure despotism, established among a barbarous peo∣ple
can ever, by its native force and energy, refine and
polish itself. It must borrow its laws, and methods,
and institutions, and consequently its stability and
order, from free governments. These advantages are
the sole growth of republics. The extensive despo∣tism
of a barbarous monarchy, by entering into the
detail of the government, as well as into the princi∣pal
points of administration, for ever prevents all such
improvements.</P>
<P>IN a civilized monarchy, the prince alone is un∣restrained
in the exercise of his authority, and pos∣sesses
alone a power, which is not bounded by any
thing but custom, example, and the sense of his own
interest. Every minister or magistrate, however emi∣nent,
must submit to the general laws, which go∣vern
the whole society, and must exert the autho∣rity
delegated to him after the manner, which is pre∣scribed.
The people depend on none but their so∣vereign,
for the security of their property. He is
so far removed from them, and is so much exempt
<PB N="208" REF="205"/>
from private jealousies or interests, that this depen∣dence
is not felt. And thus a species of government
arises, to which, in a high political rant, we may
give the name of <HI>Tyranny,</HI> but which, by a just and
prudent administration, may afford tolerable security
to the people, and may answer most of the ends of
political society.</P>
<P>BUT tho' in a civilized monarchy, as well as in a
republic, the people have security for the enjoyment
of their property; yet in both these forms of go∣vernment,
those who possess the supreme authority
have the disposal of many honours and advantages,
which excite the ambition and avarice of mankind.
The only difference is, that in a republic, the can∣didates
for offices must look downwards, to gain the
suffrages of the people; in a monarchy, they must
turn their attention upwards to court the good graces
and favour of the great. To be successful in the
former way, 'tis necessary for a man to make him∣self
<HI>useful,</HI> by his industry, capacity, or knowlege:
To be prosperous in the latter way, 'tis requisite for
him to render himself <HI>agreeable,</HI> by his wit, com∣plaisance,
or civility. A strong genius succeeds best
in republics: A refined taste in monarchies. And
consequently the sciences are the more natural growth
of the one, and the polite arts of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="206"/>
NOT to mention, that monarchies, receiving their
chief stability from a superstitious reverence to priests
and princes, have almost always abriged the liberty
of reasoning, with regard to religion and politics,
and consequently metaphysics and morals. All these
form the most considerable branches of science. Ma∣thematics
and natural philosophy, which only re∣main,
are not half so valuable.</P>
<P>THERE is a very great connection among all the
arts, which contribute to pleasure; and the same
delicacy of taste, which enables us to make im∣provements
in one, will not allow the others to re∣main
altogether rude and barbarous. Amongst all
the arts of conversation, no one pleases more than
mutual deference or civility, which leads us to resign
our own inclinations to those of our companion, and
to curb and conceal that presumption and arrogance
so natural to the human mind. A good-natured man,
who is well educated, practises this civility to every
mortal, without premeditation or interest. But, in
order to render that valuable quality general among
any people, it seems necessary to assist the natural
dispositions by some general motive. Where power
rises upwards from the people to the great, as in
all republics, such refinements of civility are apt to
be little practised, since the whole state are, by that
means, brought near to a level, and every member
of it is rendered, in a great measure, independent of
<PB N="210" REF="207"/>
another. The people have the advantage, by the
authority of their suffrages: The great, by the su∣periority
of their station. But in a civilized mo∣narchy,
there is a long train of dependence from the
prince to the peasant, which is not great enough
to render property precarious, or depress the minds
of the people; but is sufficient to beget in every one
an inclination to please his superiors, and to form
himself upon those models, which are most accep∣table
to people of condition and education. Polite∣ness
of manners, therefore, arises most naturally in
monarchies and courts; and where that flourishes,
none of the liberal arts will be altogether neglected
or despised.</P>
<P>THE republics in EUROPE are at present noted for
want of politeness. <HI>The good manners of a</HI> SWISS
<HI>civilized in</HI> HOLLAND<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>C'est la politesse d' un Suisse</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n HOLLANDE civilisé.</L></NOTE>, is an expression for rusti∣city
among the FRENCH. The ENGLISH, in some
degree, fall under the same censure, notwithstanding
their learning and genius. And if the VENETIANS
be an exception to the rule, they owe it, perhaps,
to their communication with the other ITALIANS,
most of whose governments beget a dependence more
than sufficient for civilizing their manners.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="208"/>
'Tis difficult to pronounce any judgment concern∣ing
the refinements of the ancient republics in this
particular: But I am apt to suspect, that the arts of
conversation were not brought so near perfection a∣mong
them as the arts of writing and composition.
The scurrility of the ancient orators, in many in∣stances,
is quite shocking, and exceeds all belief.
Vanity too is often not a little offensive in authors
of that age<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">'Tis needless to cite CICERO or PLINY on this head: They are too much noted: But one is a little surprized to find ARRIAN, a very grave, judicious writer, interrupt the thread of his narration all of a sudden to tell his readers that he him∣self is as eminent among the GREEKS for eloquence as ALEX∣ANDER was for arms.

was certainly one of the politest gentlemen
of his age; and yet I must confess I have frequent∣ly
been shocked with the poor figure under which he
represents his friend ATTICUS, in those dialogues,
where he himself is introduced as a speaker. That
learned and virtuous ROMAN, whose dignity, tho'
he was only a private gentleman, was inferior to that
of no one in ROME, is there shewn in rather a
more pitiful light than PHILALETHES'S friend in our
modern dialogues. He is a humble admirer of the
orator, pays him frequent compliments, and receives
his instructions, with all the deference that a scholar
owes to his master<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ATT. Non mihi videtur ad beate vivendum satis esse vir∣tutem. MAR. At hercule BRUTO meo videtur; cujus ego ju∣dicium, pace tua dixerim, longe antepono tuo. TUSC. Quae. lib. 5.</NOTE>. Even CATO is treated in some∣what

And 't s remarkable, that CICERO, being a great
sceptic in matters of religion, and unwilling to de∣termine
any thing on that head among the diffe∣rent
sects of philosophy, introduces his friends dis∣puting
concerning the being and nature of the gods,
while he is only a hearer; because, forsooth, it would
have been an impropriety for so great a genius as
himself, had he spoke, not to have said something
decisive on the subject, and have carried every thing
before him, as he always does on other occa∣sions.
There is also a spirit of dialogue observed
in the eloquent books <HI>de Oratore,</HI> and a tolerable
equality maintained among the speakers: But then
these speakers are the great men of the age pre∣ceding
the author, and he recounts the conference
as only from hearsay.</P>
<P>ONE of the most particular details of a real dia∣logue,
which we meet with in antiquity is related
by POLYBIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 17.</NOTE>, when PHILIP, king of MACEDON,
a prince of wit and parts, met with TITUS FLA∣MININUS,
one of the politest of the ROMANS as
we learn from PLUTARCH<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In vita FLAMIN.</NOTE>, accompanied with
ambassadors from almost all the GREEK cities.
The AETOLIAN ambassador very abruptly tells the
<PB N="214" REF="211"/>
king, that he talked like a fool or a madman (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)
<HI>That's evident,</HI> says his majesty, <HI>even to a blind man;</HI>
which was a raillery on the blindness of his excellency.
Yet all this past not the usual bounds: For the confe∣rence
was not disturbed; and FLAMININUS was very
well diverted with these strokes of humour. At the
end, when PHILIP craved a little time to consult with
his friends, of whom he had none present, the RO∣MAN
general, being desirous also to shew his wit, as
the historian says, tells him, <HI>that perhaps the reason,
why he had none of his friends with him, was because
he had murdered them all;</HI> which was actually the case.
This unprovoked piece of rusticity is not condemned
by the historian, caused no farther resentment in
PHILIP, than to excite a SARDONIAN smile, or what
we call a grin, and hindered him not from renewing
the conference next day. PLUTARCH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In vita FLAMIN.</NOTE> too mentions
this raillery amongst the witty and agreeable sayings
of FLAMININUS.</P>
<P>'Tis but an indifferent compliment, which HO∣RACE
pays to his friend GROSPHUS, in the ode
addressed to him. <HI>No one,</HI> says he, <HI>is happy in every re∣spect.

that a modern poet would not have been guilty of
such an impropriety as that which may be observed
in VIRGIL'S address to AUGUSTUS, when, after a
great deal of extravagant flattery, and after having
deifyed the emperor, according to the custom of those
times, he, at last, places this god on the same level with
<PB N="216" REF="213"/>
himself. <HI>By your gracious nod,</HI> says he, <HI>render my un∣dertaking

<P>One would not say to a prince or great man, “When you and I were in such a place, we saw such a thing happen.” But, “When you were in such a place, I attended you: And such a thing happened.”</P>
<P>Here I cannot forbear mentioning a piece of delicacy observed in FRANCE, which seems to me excessive and ridiculous. You must not say, “That is a very fine dog, madam.” But, “Ma∣dam, that is a very fine dog.” They think it indecent that those words, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g</HI> and <HI>madam,</HI> should be coupled together in the sentence; tho' they have no reference to each other in the sense.</P>
<P>After all, I acknowlege, that this reasoning from single pas∣sages of ancient authors may seem fallacious; and that the fore∣going arguments cannot have great force, but with those who are well acquainted with these writers, and know the truth of the general position. For instance, what absurdity would it be to assert, that VIRGIL understood not the force of the terms he employs, and could not chuse his epithets with propriety? Be∣cause in the following lines, addressed also to AUGUSTUS, he has failed in that particular, and has ascribed to the INDIANS a quality, which seems, in a manner, to turn his hero into ridi∣cule.</P>

<PB N="217" REF="214"/>
age, been accustomed to observe such niceties, a writer
so delicate as VIRGIL would certainly have given a
different turn to this sentence. The court of AUGUS∣TUS,
however polite, had not yet, it seems, worn off
the manners of the republic.</P>
<P>CARDINAL WOLSEY apologized for his famous
piece of insolence, in saying, EGO ET REX MEUS, <HI>I
and my king,</HI> by observing, that this expression was
exactly conformable to the <HI>Latin</HI> idiom, and that a
ROMAN always named himself before the person to
whom, or of whom he spake. Yet this seems to have
been an Instance of want of civility among that people.
The ancients made it a rule, That the person of the
greatest dignity should be mentioned first in the dis∣course;
insomuch, that we find, the spring of a quar∣rel
and jealousy between the ROMANS and AETOLI∣ANS,
to have been a poet's naming the AETOLIANS
before the ROMANS, in celebrating a victory gained
by their united arms over the MACEDONIANS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLUT. in vita FLAMININI.</NOTE>. Thus
LIVIA disgusted TIBERIUS by placing her own name
before his in an inscription<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">TACIT▪ Ann▪ lib. 3. cap. 64.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No advantages in this world are pure and unmixed.
In like manner, as modern politeness, which is natu∣rally
so ornamental, runs often into affectation and
<PB N="218" REF="215"/>
foppery and disguise and insincerity; so the ancient
simplicity, which is naturally so amiable and affecting,
often degenerates into rusticity and abuse, scurrility and
obscenity.</P>
<P>If the superiority in politeness should be allowed to
modern times, the modern notions of <HI>gallantry</HI> and <HI>ho∣nour,</HI>
the natural product of courts and monarchies, will
probably be assigned as the causes of this refinement.
No one denies these inventions to be modern<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the <HI>Self-Tormentor</HI> of TERENCE, CLINIAS, whenever he comes to town, instead of waiting on his mistress, sends for her to come to him.</NOTE>: But
some of the most zealous partizans of the ancients,

a reproach, rather than a credit to the present age<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">My Lord SHAFT<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Y, see his <HI>Meralist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE>.
It may here be proper to examine this question, with
regard both to gallantry and honour. We shall begin
with gallantry.</P>
<P>NATURE has implanted in all living creatures an
affection between the sexes, which even in the fiercest
and most rapacious animals, is not merely confined to
the satisfaction of the bodily appetite, but begets a
friendship and mutual sympathy, which runs thro' the
whole tenor of their lives. Nay, even in those spe∣cies,
where nature limits the indulgence of this ap∣petite
<PB N="219" REF="216"/>
to one season and to one object, and forms a
kind of marriage or association between a single male
and female, there is yet a visible complacency and
benevolence, which extends farther, and mutually
softens the affections of the sexes towards each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Tutti gli altri animai, che sono in terra,</L>,
<L>O che vivon quieti &amp; stanno in pace;</L>
<L>O si vengon a rissa, &amp; si fan guerra,</L>
<L>A la femina il maschio non la face.</L>
<L>L'orsa con l'orso al bosco sicura erra,</L>
<L>La Leonessa apprésso il Leon giace,</L>
<L>Con Lupo vive il Lupa sicura.</L>
<L>Ne la Guivenca ha del Torel paura.</L>
<L>ARIOSTO, Canto 5.</L></Q></NOTE>.
How much more must this have place in man, where
the confinement of the appetite is not natural; but
either is derived accidentally from some strong charm
of love, or arises from reflections on duty and con∣venience?
Nothing, therefore, can proceed less from
affectation than the passion of gallantry. 'Tis <HI>natu∣ral</HI>
in the higest degree. Art and education, in the
most elegant courts, make no more alternation on it,
than on all the other laudable passions. They only
turn the mind more towards it; they refine it; they
polish it; and give it a proper grace and expression.</P>
<P>BUT gallantry is as <HI>generous</HI> as it is <HI>natural.</HI> To
correct such gross vices, as lead us to commit a real
injury to others, is the part of morals, and the ob∣ject
<PB N="220" REF="217"/>
of the most ordinary education. Where <HI>that</HI> is
not attended to, in some degree, no human society
can subsist. But in order to render conversation,
and the intercourse of minds more easy and agree∣able,
Good-manners have been invented, and have
carried the matter somewhat farther. Wherever na∣ture
has given the mind a propensity to any vice, or
to any passion disagreeable to others, refined breeding
has taught men to throw the byass on the opposite
side, and to preserve, in all their behaviour, the ap∣pearance
of sentiments contrary to those which they
naturally incline to. Thus, as we are commonly
proud and selfish, and apt to assume the preference
above others, a polite man learns to behave with de∣ference
towards those with whom he converses, and
to yield the superiority to them in all the common in∣cidents
of society. In like manner, wherever a per∣son's
situation may naturally beget any disagreable
suspicion in him, 'tis the part of good-manners to
prevent it, by a studied display of sentiments, directly
contrary to those of which he is apt to be jealous.
Thus, old men known their infirmities, and naturally
dread contempt from the youth: Hence, well-edu∣cated
youth, redouble the instances of respect and de∣ference
to their elders. Strangers and foreigners are
without protection: Hence, in all polite countries,
they receive the highest civilities, and are intitled to
the first place in every company. A man is lord in
his own family, and his guests are, in a manner, sub∣ject
<PB N="221" REF="218"/>
to his authority: Hence, he is always the lowest
person in the company; attentive to the wants of
every one; and giving himself all the trouble, in or∣der
to please, which may not betray too visible an
affectation, or impose too much constraint on his
guests<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The frequent mention in ancient authors of that ill-br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d custom of the master of the family's eating better bread or drink∣ing better wine at table, than he afforded his guests, is but an indifferent mark of the civility of those ages. See JUVENAL. fat. 5. PLINI<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, lib. 14. cap. 13. Also PLINI<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Epist. Lucian de mercede conductis, Saturnalia,</HI> &amp;c. There is scarce any part of EUROPE at present so uncivilized as to admit of such a custom.</NOTE>. Gallantry is nothing but an instance of the
same generous and refined attention. As nature has
given <HI>man</HI> the superiority above <HI>woman,</HI> by endowing
him with greater strength both of mind and body;
'tis his part to alleviate that superiority, as much as
possible, by the generosity of his behaviour, and by
a studied deference and complaisance for all her incli∣nations
and opinions. Barbarous nations display this
superiority, by reducing their females to the most ab∣ject
slavery; by con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ining them, by beating them, by
selling them, by killing them. But the male sex,
among a polite people, discover their authority in a
more generous, tho' not a less evident manner; by
civility, by respect, by complaisance, and, in a word,
by gallantry. In good company, you need not ask,
Who is the master of the feast? The man who sits in
<PB N="222" REF="219"/>
the lowest place, and who is always industrious in help∣ing
every one, is most certainly the person. We
must either condemn all such instances of generosity,
as foppish and affected, or admit of gallantry among
the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. The ancient MUSCOVITES wedded their
wives with a whip, instead of a wedding-ring. The
same people, in their own houses, took always the
precedency above foreigners, even<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Relation of three embassies,</HI> by the earl of CARLILE.</NOTE> foreign ambassa∣dors.
These two instances of their generosity and po∣liteness
are much of a piece.</P>
<P>GALLANTRY is not less consistent with <HI>wisdom</HI> and
<HI>prudence,</HI> than with <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture</HI> and <HI>generosity;</HI> and when
under proper regulations, contributes, more than any
other invention, to the <HI>entertainment</HI> and <HI>improvement</HI>
of the youth of both sexes. In all vegetables, 'tis
observable, that the flower and the seed are always
connected together; and in like manner, among
every species of animals, nature has founded on the
love between the sexes their sweetest and best enjoy∣ment.
But the satisfaction of the bodily appetite is
not alone of great value; and even among brute
creatu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, we find, that their play and dalliance, and
other expressions of fondness, form the greatest part
of the entertainment. In rational beings, we must
certainly admit the mind for a considerable share.
Were we to rob the feast of all its garniture of reason,
<PB N="223" REF="220"/>
discourse, sympathy, friendship, and gaiety, what re∣mains
would scarce be worth acceptance, in the judg∣ment
of the truly elegant and luxurious.</P>
<P>WHAT better school for manners, than the com∣pany
of virtuous women; where the mutual endea∣vour
to please must insensibly polish the mind, where
the example of the female softness and modesty must
communicate itself to their admirers, and where the
delicacy of that sex puts every one on his guard, lest
he give offence by any breach of decency?</P>
<P>I MUST confess, That my own particular choice
rather leads me to prefer the company of a few select
companions, with whom I can, calmly and peaceably,
enjoy the feast of reason, and try the justness of every
reflection, whether gay or serious, that may occur to
me. But as such a delightful society is not every day
to be met with, I must think, that mixt companies,
without the fair-sex, are the most insipid entertain∣ment
in the world, and destitute of gaiety and polite∣ness,
as much as of sense and reason. Nothing can
keep them from excessive dulness but hard drinking;
a remedy worse than the disease.</P>
<P>AMONG the ancients, the character of the fair-sex
was considered as altogether domestic, nor were they
regarded as part of the polite world, or of good com∣pany.
This, perhaps, is the true reason why the an∣cients
have not left us one piece of pleasantry, that
<PB N="224" REF="221"/>
is excellent, (unless one may except the banquet of
XENOPHON, and the dialogues of LUCIAN) tho' ma∣ny
of their serious compositions are altogether inimi∣table.
HORACE condemns the coarse railleries and
cold jests of PLAUTUS: But, tho' the most easy, agree∣able,
and judicious writer in the world, is his own
talent for ridicule very striking or refined? This,
therefore, is one considerable improvement, which the
polite arts have received from gallantry, and from
courts, where it first arose.</P>
<P>THE point of <HI>honour,</HI> or duelling, is a modern in∣vention,
as well as <HI>gallantry;</HI> and by some esteemed
equally usesul for the refining of manners: But how
it has contributed to that effect, I am at a loss to de∣termine.
Conversation, among the greatest rustics,
is not commonly infested with such rudeness as can
give occasion to duels, even according to the most
refined laws of this fantastic honour; and, as to the
other small indecencies, which are the most offensive,
because the most frequent, they can never be cured
by the practice of duelling. But these notions are
not only <HI>useless:</HI> They are also <HI>pernicious.</HI> By separat∣ing
the man of honour from the man of virtue, the
greatest profligates have got something to value them∣selves
upon, and have been able to keep themselves
in countenance, tho' guilty of the most shameful and
most dangerous vices. They are debauchees, spend∣thrists,
and never pay a farthing they owe: But they
<PB N="225" REF="222"/>
are men of honour; and therefore are to be received
as gentlemen in all companies.</P>
<P>THERE are some of the parts of modern honour,
which are the most essential parts of morality; such
as fidelity, the observing promises, and telling truth.
These points of honour Mr. ADDISON had in his eye,
when he made JUBA say,
<Q><L>Honour's a sacred tye, the law of kings,</L>
<L>The noble mind's distinguishing perfection,</L>
<L>That aids and strengthens virtue, when it meets her,</L>
<L>And imitates her actions where she is not:</L>
<L>It ought not to be sported with.</L></Q></P>
<P>These lines are very beautiful: But I am afraid, that
Mr. ADDISON has here been guilty of that impropriety
of sentiment, with which, on other occasions, he has
so justly reproached our poets. The ancients certainly
never had any notion of <HI>honour</HI> as distinct from <HI>vir∣tue.</HI></P>
<P>BUT,
to return from this digression, I shall advance
it as a <HI>fourth</HI> observation on this, of the rise and pro∣gress
of the arts and sciences, <HI>That when the arts and
sciences come to perfection in any state, from that moment
they naturally, or rather necessarily decline, and sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om
or never revive in that nation, where they formerly
flourished.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="223"/>
IT must be confessed, that this maxim, tho' co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣formable
to experience, may, at first sight, be esteem∣ed
very contrary to reason. If the natural genius of
mankind be the same in all ages, and in almost all
countries, (as I am of opinion it is) it must very much
forward and cultivate this genius, to be possessed of
exact patterns in every art, which may regulate the
taste, and fix the objects of imitation. The mo∣dels
left us by the ancients gave birth to all the arts
about 200 years ago, and have mightily advanced
their progress in every country of EUROPE: Why
had they not a like effect during the reign of TRAJAN
and his successors, when they were much more entire,
and were still admired and studied by the whole world?
So late as the emperor JUSTINIAN, the POET, by way
of distinction, was understood, among the GREEKS,
to be HOMER; among the ROMANS, VIRGIL. Such
admiration still remained for these divine geniuses;
tho' no poet had appeared for many centuries, who
could juftly pretend to have imitated them.</P>
<P>A MAN'S genius is always, in the beginning of his
life, as much unknown to himself as to others; and
'tis only after frequent trials, attended with success,
that he dares think himself equal to those undertak∣ings,
in which they who have succeeded, have fixed
the admiration of mankind. If his own nation be
already possessed of many models of eloquence, he na∣turally
compares his own juvenile exercises with these;
<PB N="227" REF="224"/>
and being sensible of the infinite disproportion betwixt
them, is discouraged from any further attempts, and
never aims at a rivalship with those authors, whom he
so much admires. A noble emulation is the source of
every excellence. Admiration and modesty naturally
extinguish this emulation. And no one is so liable to
an excess of admiration and modesty, as a truly great
genius.</P>
<P>NEXT to emulation, the greatest encourager of the
noble arts is praise and glory. A writer is animated
with new force, when he hears the applauses of the
world for his former productions; and, being rouzed
by such a motive, he often reaches a pitch of perfec∣tion,
which is equally surprizing to himself and to his
readers. But when the posts of honour are all occu∣pied,
his first attempts are but coldly received by the
public; being compared to productions, which are
both in themselves more excellent, and have already
the advantage of an established reputation. Were
MOLIERE and CORNEILLE to bring upon the stage
at present their early productions, which were for∣merly
so well received, it would discourage the young
poets, to see the indifference and disdain of the pub∣lic.
The ignorance of the age alone could have
given admission to the <HI>Prince of</HI> TYRE; but 'tis to
that we owe <HI>the Moo:.</HI> Had <HI>Every man in his humour</HI>
been rejected, we had never seen VOLPONE.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="225"/>
PERHAPS it may not be for the advantage of any
nation, to have the arts imported from their neigh∣bours
in too great perfection. This extinguishes emu∣lation,
and sinks the ardor of the generous youth.
So many models of ITALIAN painting brought into
BRITAIN, instead of exciting our artists, is the cause
of their small progress in that noble art. The same,
perhaps, was the case of ROME, when it received the
arts from GREECE. That multitude of polite pro∣ductions
in the FRENCH language, dispersed all over
GERMANY and the NORTH, hinder these nations
from cultivating their own language, and keep them
still dependent on their neighbours for those elegant
entertainments.</P>
<P>'TIS true, the ancients had left us models in every
kind of writing, which are highly worthy of admi∣ration.
But besides that they were wrote in lan∣guages,
which were known only to the learned; be∣sides
this, I say, the comparison is not so perfect nor
intire between modern wits, and those who lived in
so remote an age. Had WALLER been born in
ROME, during the reign of TIBERIUS, his first pro∣ductions
had been despised, when compared to the
finished odes of HORACE. But in this island the supe∣riority
of the ROMAN poet diminished nothing from
the fame of the ENGLISH. We esteemed ourselves
sufficiently happy, that our climate and language
<PB N="229" REF="226"/>
could produce but a faint copy of so excellent an
original.</P>
<P>IN short, the arts and sciences, like some plants,
require a fresh soil; and however rich the land
may be, and however you may recruit it by art or
care, it will never, when once exhausted, produce
any thing that is perfect or finished in the kind.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The EPICUR<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>AN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">OR, <HI>the man of elegance and pleasure.</HI> The intention of this and the three following essays is not so much, to explain ac∣curately the sentiments of the ancient sects of philosophy, as to deliver the sentiments of sects, that naturally form themselves in the world, and entertain different ideas of human life and of happiness. I have given each of them the name of the philo∣sophical sect, to which it bears the greatest affinity.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS a great mortification to the vanity of man,
that his utmost art and industry can never
equal the meanest of nature's productions, either for
beauty or value. Art is only the underworkman, and
is employed to give a few strokes of embellishment
to those pieces, which come from the hand of the
master. Some of the drapery may be of his drawing;
but he is not allowed to touch the principal figure.
Art may make a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit of clothes: But nature must pro∣duce
a man.</P>
<P>EVEN in those productions, which are commonly
denominated works of art, we find, that the noblest
<PB N="232" REF="228"/>
of the kind are beholden for their chief beauty to
the force and happy influence of nature. To the
<HI>Oestrum</HI> or native enthusiasm of the poets, we owe
whatever is admirable in their productions. The
greatest genius, where nature at any time fails him
(for she is not equal) throws aside the lyre, and hopes
not, from the rules of art, to reach that divine har∣mony,
which must proceed from her inspiration alone.
How poor are those songs, where a happy flow of
fancy has not furnished materials for art to embellish
and refine!</P>
<P>BUT of all the fruitless attempts of art, no one is
so ridiculous, as that which the severe philosophers
have undertaken, the producing an <HI>artificial hap∣piness,</HI>
and making us be pleased by rules of rea∣son,
and by reflection. Why did none of them
claim the reward, which XERXES promised to him,
who could invent a new pleasure? Unless, perhaps,
they invented so many pleasures for their own use, that
they despised riches, and stood in no need of any en∣joyments,
which the rewards of that monarch could
procure them. I am apt, indeed, to think, that
they were not willing to furnish the PERSIAN court
with a new pleasure, by presenting it with so new and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nusual an object of ridicule. Their speculations,
when confined to theory; and gravely delivered in the
schools of GREECE, might excite admiration in their
ignorant pupils: But the attempting to reduce such
<PB N="233" REF="229"/>
principles to practice would soon betray their ab∣surdity.</P>
<P>YOU pretend to make me happy by reason, and by
rules of art. You must, then, create me anew by
rules of art. For on my original frame and structure
does my happiness depend. But you want power to
effect this; and skill too, I am afraid: Nor can I en∣tertain
a less opinion of nature's wisdom than of yours.
And let her conduct the machine, which she has so
wisely framed. I find, that I should only spoil it by
my tampering.</P>
<P>TO what purpose should I pretend to regulate, re∣fine,
or invigorate any of those springs or principles,
which nature has implanted in me? Is this the road
by which I must reach happiness? But happiness im∣plies
ease, contentment, repose and pleasure; not
watchfulness, care, and fatigue. The health of my
body consists in the facility with which all its opera∣tions
are performed. The stomach digests the ali∣ments:
The heart circulates the blood: The brain
separates <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd refines the spirits: And all this without
my concerning myself in the matter. When by my
will alone I can stop the blood, as it runs with impe∣tuosity
along its canals, then may I hope to change
the course of my sentiments and passions. In vain
should I strain my faculties, and endeavour to receive
pleasure from an object, which is not fitted by nature
<PB N="234" REF="230"/>
to affect my organs with delight. I may give myself
pain by my fruitless endeavours, but shall never reach
any pleasure.</P>
<P>AWAY then with all those vain pretences of making
ourselves happy within ourselves, of feasting on our
own thoughts, of being satisfied with the conscious∣ness
of well-doing, and of despising all assistance and
all supplies from external objects. This is the voice
of PRIDE, not of NATURE. And it were well, if
even this pride could support itself, and communicate
a real <HI>inward</HI> pleasure, however melancholy or se∣vere.
But this impotent pride can do no more than
regulate the <HI>outside;</HI> and with infinite pains and at∣tention
compose the language and countenance to a
philosophical dignity, in order to deceive the ignorant
vulgar. The heart, mean while, is empty of all en∣joyment:
And the mind, unsupported by its proper
objects, sinks into the deepest sorrow and dejection.
Miserable but vain mortal! Thy mind be happy with∣in
itself! With what resources is it endowed to fill so
immense a void, and supply the place of all thy bo∣dily
senses and faculties? Can thy head subsist without
thy other members? In such a situation,
<Q><L>What foolish figure must it make?</L>
<L>Do nothing else but <HI>sleep</HI> and <HI>ake.</HI></L></Q>
Into such a lethargy, or such a melancholy, must thy
<PB N="235" REF="231"/>
mind be plunged, when deprived of foreign occupa∣tions
and enjoyments.</P>
<P>KEEP me, therefore, no longer in this violent con∣straint.
Confine me not within myself; but point out
to me those objects and pleasures, which afford the
chief enjoyment. But why do I apply to you, proud
and ignorant sages, to shew me the road to happiness?
Let me consult my own passions and inclinations. In
them must I read the dictates of nature; not in your
frivolous discourses.</P>
<P>BUT see, propitious to my wishes, the divine, the
amiable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dia V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luptas. LUCRET.</NOTE> PLEASURE, the supreme Love of GODS and
men, advances towards me. At her approach, my
heart beats with genial heat, and every sense and every
faculty is dissolved in joy; while she pours around me
all the embellishments of the spring, and all the trea∣sures
of the autumn. The melody of her voice
charms my ears with the softest music, as she invites
me to partake of those delicious fruits, which with a
smile that diffuses a glory on the heavens and the
earth, she presents to me. The sportive CUPIDS,
who attend her, or fan me with their odoriferous
wings, or pour on my head the most fragrant oils,
or offer me their sparkling nectar in golden goblets.
O! for ever let me spread my limbs on this bed of
<PB N="236" REF="232"/>
roses, and thus, thus feel the delicious moments, with
soft and downy steps, glide along. But cruel chance!
Whither do you fly so fast? Why do my ardent wishes,
and that load of pleasures, under which you labour,
rather hasten than retard your unrelenting pace? Suf∣fer
me to enjoy this soft repose, after all my fatigues
in search of happiness. Suffer me to satiate myself
with these delicacies, after the pains of so long and so
foolish an abstinence.</P>
<P>BUT it will not do. The roses have lost their
hue: The fruit its flavour: And that delicious wine,
whose fumes, so late, intoxicated all my senses with
such delight, now solicits in vain the sated palate.
<HI>Pleasure</HI> smiles at my languor. She beckens her sister,
<HI>Virtue,</HI> to come to her assistance. The gay, the fro∣lic
<HI>Virtue</HI> observes the call, and brings along the
whole troop of my jovial friends. Welcome, thrice
welcome, my ever dear companions, to these shady
bowers, and to this luxurious repast. Your presence
has restored to the rose its hue, and to the fruit its
flavour. The vapours of this sprightly nectar now
again play around my heart; while you partake of
my delights, and discover in your chearful looks, the
pleasure which you receive from my happiness and
satisfaction. The like do I receive from yours; and
encouraged by your joyous presence, shall again renew
the feast, with which, from too much enjoyment, my
senses were well nigh sated; while the mind kept not
<PB N="237" REF="233"/>
pace with the body, nor afforded relief to her over-burthened
partner.</P>
<P>IN our chearful discourses, better than in the for∣mal
reasonings of the schools, is true wisdom to be
found. In our friendly endearments, better than in
the hollow debates of statesmen and pretended patri∣ots,
does true virtue display itself. Forgetful of the
past, secure of the future, let us here enjoy the pre∣sent;
and while we yet possess a being, let us fix
some good, beyond the power of fate or fortune.
To-morrow will bring its own pleasures along with
it: Or should it disappoint our fond wishes, we shall
at least enjoy the pleasure of reflecting on the plea∣sures
of to-day.</P>
<P>FEAR not, my friends, that the barbarous dissonance
of BACCHUS, and of his revellers, should break in
upon this entertainment, and confound us with their
turbulent and clamorous pleasures. The sprightly
muses wait around; and with their charming sympho∣ny,
sufficient to soften the wolves and tygers of the
savage desert, inspire a soft joy into every bosom.
Peace, harmony, and concord reign in this retreat;
nor is the silence ever broke but by the music of our
songs, or the chearful accents of our friendly voices.</P>
<P>BUT hark! the favourite of the muses, the gentle
DAMON, strikes the lyre; and while he accompanies
<PB N="238" REF="234"/>
its harmonious notes with his more harmonious song,
he inspires us with the same happy debauch of fancy.
by which he is himself transported. “Ye happy
youth,” he sings, “Ye favoured of heaven<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>An imitation of the SYRENS song in TASSO.</L>

while the wanton spring pours upon you all her
blooming honours, let not <HI>glory</HI> seduce you, with
her delusive blaze, to pass in perils and dangers
this delicious season, this prime of life. Wisdom
points out to you the road to pleasure: Nature
too beckens you to follow her in that smooth and
flowry path. Will you shut your ears to their com∣manding
voice? Will you harden your heart to
their soft allurements? Oh, deluded mortals,
thus to lose your youth, thus to throw away so
invaluable a present, to trifle with so perish∣ing
a blessing. Contemplate well your recom∣pence.
Consider that glory, which so allures
your proud hearts, and seduces you with your own
praises. 'Tis an eccho, a dream, nay the shadow
of a dream, which is dissipated by every wind, and
lost by every contrary breath of the ignorant and
i l-judging multitude. You fear not, that even
death itself shall ravish it from you. But behold!
while you are yet alive, calumny bereaves you of it;
ignorance neglects it; nature enjoys it not; fancy
<PB N="239" REF="235"/>
alone, renouncing every pleasure, receives this airy
recompence, empty and unstable as herself.”</P>
<P>THUS the hours pass unperceived along, and lead
in their wanton train all the pleasures of sense, and all
the joys of harmony and friendship. Smiling <HI>inno∣cence</HI>
closes the procession; and while she presents her∣self
to our ravished eyes, she embellishes the whole
scene, and renders the view of these pleasures as trans∣porting,
after they have past us, as when, with laugh∣ing
countenances, they were yet advancing towards
us.</P>
<P>BUT the sun has sunk below the horizon; and
darkness stealing silently upon us, has now buried all
nature in an universal shade. “Rejoice, my friends,
continue your repast, or change it for soft repose.
Tho' absent, your joy or your tranquillity shall still
be mine.” <HI>But whither do you go? Or what new
pleasures call you from our society? Is there aught agree∣able
without your friends? And can aught please, in
which we partake not?</HI> “Yes, my friends; the joy,
which I now seek, admits not of your participa∣tion.
Here alone I wish your absence: And here
alone can I find a sufficient compensation for the
loss of your society.”</P>
<P>BUT I have not advanced far thro' the shades of
the thick wood, which spreads a double night around
<PB N="240" REF="236"/>
me, 'ere, methinks, I perceive thro' the gloom, the
charming CAELIA, the mistress of my wishes, who
wanders impatient thro' the grove, and preventing the
appointed hour, silently chides my tardy steps. But
the joy, which she receives from my presence, best
pleads my excuse; and dissipating every anxious and
every angry thought, leave room for nought but mu∣tual
joy and rapture. With what words, my fair
one. shall I express my tenderness, or describe the
emotions which now warm my transported bosom!
Words are too faint to describe my love; and if, alas!
you feel not the same flame within you, in vain
shall I endeavour to convey to you a just conception
of it. But your every word and every motion suffice
to remove this doubt; and while they express your
passion, serve also to enflame mine. How amiable
this solitude, this silence, this darkness! No objects
now importune the ravished soul. The thought, the
sense, all full of nothing but our mutual happiness,
wholly possess the mind, and convey a pleasure, which
deluded mortals vainly seek for in every other enjoy∣ment.—</P>
<P>BUT why does your bosom heave with these sighs,
while tears bathe your glowing cheeks? Why distract
your heart with such vain anxieties? Why so often
ask me. <HI>How long my love shall yet endure?</HI> Alas, my
CAELIA, Can I resolve this question? <HI>Do I know how
long my life shall yet endure?</HI> But does this also dis∣turb
<PB N="241" REF="237"/>
your tender breast? And is the image of our frail
mortality for ever present with you, to throw a damp
on your gayest hours, and poison even those joys
which love inspires. Consider rather, that if life be
frail, if youth be transitory, we should well employ
the present moment, and lose no part of so perishable
an existence. Yet a little moment and <HI>these</HI> shall be
no more. We shall be, as if we had never been.
Not a memory of us be left upon earth; and even
the fabulous shades below will not afford us a habi∣tation.
Our fruitless anxieties, our vain projects, our
uncertain speculations shall all be swallowed up and
lost. Our present doubts, concerning the original
cause of all things, must never, alas! be resolved.
This alone we may be certain of, that if any govern∣ing
mind preside over the universe, he must be pleased
to see us fulfil the ends of our being, and enjoy that
pleasure, for which alone we were created. Let this
reflection give ease to your anxious thoughts; but
render not your joys too serious, by dwelling for ever
upon it. 'Tis sufficient, once, to be acquainted with
this philosophy, in order to give an unbounded loose
to love and jollity, and remove all the scruples of a vain
superstition: But while youth and passion, my fair-one,
prompt our eager desires, we must find gayer
subjects of discourse, to intermix with these amorous
caresses.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The STOIC<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Or the man of action and virtue.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is this obvious and material difference
in the conduct of nature, with regard to man
and other animals, that having endowed the former
with a sublime celestial spirit, and having given him
an affinity with superior beings, she allows not such
noble faculties to lie lethargic or idle; but urges him,
by necessity, to employ, on every emergence, his ut∣most
<HI>art</HI> and <HI>industry.</HI> Brute creatures have many of
their necessities supplied by nature, being cloathed and
armed by this beneficent parent of all things: And
where their own <HI>industry</HI> is requisite on any occasion,
nature, by implanting instincts, still supplies them
with the <HI>art,</HI> and guides them to their good, by her
unerring precepts. But man, exposed naked and in∣digent
to the rude elements, rises slowly from that
helpless state, by the care and vigilance of his pa∣rents;
and having attained his utmost growth and
<PB N="244" REF="239"/>
perfection, reaches only a capacity of subsisting, by
his own care and vigilance. Every thing is sold to
skill and labour; and where nature furnishes the ma∣terials,
they are still rude and unfinished, till industry,
every active and intelligent, refines them from their
brute state, and fits them for human use and conve∣nience.</P>
<P>ACKNOWLEGE, therefore, O man, the beneficence
of nature: For she has given thee that intelligence
which supplies all thy necessities. But let not indo∣lence,
under the false appearance of gratitude, per∣suade
thee to rest contented with her presents. Would'st
thou return to the raw herbage for thy food, to the
open sky for they covering, and to stones and clubs for
thy defence against the ravenous animals of the de∣sert?
Then return also to thy savage manners, to thy
timorous superstition, to thy brutal ignorance; and
sink thyself below those animals, whose condition
thou admirest, and wouldest so fondly imitate.</P>
<P>THY kind parent, nature, having given thee art
and intelligence, has filled the whole globe with ma∣terials
for these talents to work upon: Hearken to her
voice, which so plainly tells thee, that thou thyself
shouldest also be the object of thy industry, and that
by art and attention thou canst alone acquire that abi∣lity,
which will raise thee to thy proper station in the
universe. Behold this artizan, who converts a rude
<PB N="245" REF="240"/>
and shapeless stone into a noble metal; and molding
that metal by his cunning hands, creates, as it were
by magic, every weapon for his defence, and every
utensil for his convenience. He has not this skill
from nature: Use and practice have taught it him:
And if thou wouldest emulate his success, thou must
follow his laborious footsteps.</P>
<P>BUT while thou <HI>ambitiously</HI> aspirest to the perfecting
thy bodily powers and faculties, wouldest thou <HI>meanly</HI>
neglect thy mind, and from a preposterous sloth,
leave it still rude and uncultivated, as it came from
the hands of nature? Far be such folly and negli∣gence
from every rational being. If nature has been
frugal in her gifts and endowments, there is the more
need of art to supply her defects. If she has been ge∣nerous
and liberal, know that she still expects industry
and application on our part, and revenges herself in
proportion to our negligent ingratitude. The richest
genius, like the most fertile soil, when uncultivated,
shoots up into the rankest weeds; and instead of vines
and olives for the pleasure and use of man, produces,
to its slothful owner, the most abundant crop of poi∣sons.</P>
<P>THE great end of all human industry, is the attain∣ment
of happiness. For this were arts invented, sci∣ences
cultivated, laws ordained, and societies model∣led,
by the profoundest wisdom of patriots and legis∣lators.
<PB N="246" REF="241"/>
Even the lonely savage, who lies exposed to
the inclemency of the elements, and the fury of wild
beasts, forgets not, for a moment, this grand object of
his being. Ignorant as he is of every art of life, he
keeps still in view the end of all those arts, and ea∣gerly
seeks for felicity amidst that darkness with which
he is environed. But as much as the wildest savage is
inferior to the polished citizen, who, under the
protection of laws, enjoys every convenience which
industry has invented; so much is this citizen himself
inferior to the man of virtue, and the true philo∣sopher,
who governs his appetites, subdues his pas∣sions,
and has learned, from reason, to set a just va∣lue
on every pursuit and enjoyment. For is there an
art and apprenticeship requisite for every other attain∣ment?
And is there no art of life, no rule, no pre∣cepts
to direct us in this principal concern? Can no
particular pleasure be attained without skill; and can
the whole be regulated without reflection or intelli∣gence,
by the blind guidance of appetite and instinct?
Surely then no mistakes are ever committed in this
a fair; but every man, however dissolute and negli∣gent,
proceeds in the pursuit of happiness, with as
unerring a motion, as that which the celestial bodies
observe, when, conducted by the hand of the Al∣mighty,
they roll along the ethereal plains. But if
mistakes be often, be inevitably committed, let us re∣gister
these mistakes; let us consider their causes; let
us weight their importance; let us inquire for their
<PB N="247" REF="242"/>
remedies. When from this we have fixed all the
rules of conduct, we are <HI>philosophers:</HI> When we have
reduced these rules to practice, we are <HI>sages.</HI></P>
<P>LIKE many subordinate artists, employed to form
the several wheels and springs of a machine: Such
are those who excel in all the particular arts of life. <HI>He</HI>
is the master workman who puts those several parts
together, moves them according to just harmony and
proportion, and produces true felicity as the result of
their conspiring order.</P>
<P>WHILE thou hast such an alluring object in view,
shall that labour and attention, which is requisite to
the attaining thy end, ever seem burdensome and into∣lerable?
Know, that this labour itself is the chief in∣gredient
of the selicity to which thou aspirest, and
that every enjoyment soon becomes insipid and dis∣tasteful,
when not acquired by fatigue and industry.
See the hardy hunters rise from their downy couches,
shake off the slumbers which still weigh down their
heavy eye-lids, and, ere <HI>Aurora</HI> has yet covered the
heavens with her flaming mantle, hasten to the forest.
They leave behind, in their own houses, and in the
neighbouring plaine, animals of every kind, whose
flesh furnishes the most delicious fare, and which of∣fer
themselves to the fatal stroke. Laborious man
disdains so easy a purchase. He seeks for a prey,
which hides itself from his search, or flies from his
<PB N="248" REF="243"/>
pursuit, or defends itself from his violence. Having
exerted in the chace every passion of the mind, and
every member of the body, he then finds the charms
of repose, and with joy compares its pleasures to those
of his engaging labours.</P>
<P>AND can vigorous industry give pleasure to the
pursuit even of the most worthless prey, which fre∣quently
escapes our toils? And cannot the same in∣dustry
render the cultivating our mind, the modera∣ting
our passions, the enlightening our reason, an
agreeable occupation; while we are every day sen∣sible
of our progress, and behold our inward features
and countenance brightening incessantly with new
charms? Begin by curing yourself of this lethargic
indolence; the task is not difficult: You need but
taste the sweets of honest labour. Proceed to learn
the just value of every pursuit; long study is not re∣quisite:
Compare, tho' but for once, the mind to the
body, virtue to fortune, and glory to pleasure. You
will then perceive the advantages of industry: You
will then be sensible what are the proper objects of
your industry.</P>
<P>IN vain do you seek repose from beds of roses: In
vain do you hope for enjoyment from the most deli∣cious
wines and fruits. Your indolence itself becomes
a fatigue. Your pleasure itself creates disgust. The
mind, unexercised, finds every delight insipid and
<PB N="249" REF="244"/>
loathsome; and ere yet the body, full of noxious
humours, feels the torment of its multiplied diseases,
your nobler part is sensible of the invading poison,
and seeks in vain to relieve its anxiety by new plea∣sures,
which still augement the fatal malady.</P>
<P>I NEED not tell you, that by this eager pursuit of
pleasure, you more and more expose yourself to for∣tune
and accidents, and rivet your affections on ex∣ternal
objects, which chance may, in a moment, ra∣vish
from you. I shall suppose, that your indulgent
stars favour you still with the enjoyment of your
riches and possessions. I prove to you, that even in
the midst of your luxurious pleasures, you are un∣happy;
and that, by too much indulgence, you are
incapable of enjoying what prosperous fortune still al∣lows
you to possess.</P>
<P>BUT surely the instability of fortune is a consider∣ation
not to be over looked or neglected. Happiness
cannot possibly exist, where there is no security; and
security can have no place, where fortune has any
dominion. Tho' that unstable deity should not exert
her rage against you, the dread of it would still tor∣ment
you; would disturb your slumbers, haunt your
dreams, and throw a damp on the jollity of your most
delicious banquets.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="245"/>
THE temple of wisdom is seated on a rock, above
the rage of the fighting elements, and inaccessible to
all the malice of man. The rolling thunder breaks
below; and those more terrible instruments of human
fury reach not to so sublime a height. The sage,
while he breathes that serene air, looks down with
pleasure, mixed with compassion, on the errors of
mistaken mortals, who blindly seek for the true path
of life, and pursue riches, nobility, honour, or
power, for genuine felicity. The greatest part he
beholds disappointed of their fond wishes: Some la∣ment,
that having once possessed the object of their
desires, it is ravished from them by envious fortune:
And all complain, that even their own vows, tho'
granted, cannot give them happiness, or relieve the
anxiety of their distracted minds.</P>
<P>BUT does the sage preferve himself always in this
philosophic indifference, and rest contented with la∣menting
the miseries of mankind, without ever em∣ploying
himself for their relief? Does he constantly
indulge this severe wisdom, which, by pretending to
elevate him above human accidents, does in reality
harden his heart, and render him careless of the in∣terests
of mankind, and of society? No: he knows
that in this sullen <HI>Apathy,</HI> neither true wisdom nor
true happiness are to be found. He feels too strong∣ly
the charm of the social affections ever the counteract
so sweet, so natural, so virtous a propensity. Even
<PB N="251" REF="246"/>
when, bathed in tears, he laments the miseries of
human race, of his country, of his friends, and un∣able
to give succour, can only relieve them by com∣passion;
he yet rejoices in the generous disposition,
and feels a satisfaction superior to that of the most in∣dulged
sense. So engaging are the sentiments of hu∣manity,
that they brighten up the very face of sorrow,
and operate like the sun, which, shining on a dusky
cloud or falling rain, paints on them the most glo∣rious
colours which are to be found in the whole
circle of nature.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis not here alone, that the social virtues dis∣play
their energy. With whatever ingredient you
mix them, they are still predominant. As sorrow can∣not
overcome them, so neither can sensual pleasure
obscure them. The joys of love, however tumult∣uous,
banish not the tender sentiments of sympathy
and affection. They even derive their chief influence
from that generous passion; and when presented alone,
afford nothing to the unhappy mind but lassitude and
disgust. Behold this sprightly debauchee, who pro∣fesses
a contempt of all other pleasures but those of
wine and jollity: Separate him from his companions,
like a spark from a fire, where before it contributed
to the general blaze: His alacrity suddenly extinguish∣es;
and tho' surrounded with every other means of
delight, he lothes the sumptuous banquet, and presers
<PB N="252" REF="247"/>
even the most abstracted study and speculation, as
more agreeable and entertaining.</P>
<P>BUT the social passions never afford such transport∣ing
pleasures, or make so glorious an appearance in
the eyes both of GOD and man, as when, shaking
off every earthly mixture, they associate themselves
with the sentiments of virtue, and prompt us to lau∣dable
and worthy actions. As harmonious colours
mutually give and receive a lustre by their friendly
union; so do these ennobling sentiments of the hu∣man
mind. See the triumph of nature in parental
affection! What selfish passion; what sensual delight
is a match for it! Whether a man exults in the pro∣sperity
and virtue of his offspring, or flies to their
succour, thro' the most threatening and tremendous
dangers?</P>
<P>PROCEED still in purifying the generous passion,
you will still the more admire its shining glories.
What charms are there in the harmony of minds, and
in a friendship founded on mutual esteem and gratitude!
What satisfaction in relieving the distressed, in
comforting the afflicted, in raising the fallen, and in
stopping the career of cruel fortune, or of more cruel
man, in their insults over the good and virtuous!
But what supreme joy in the victories over vice as
well as misery, when, by virtuous example or wife
exhortation, our fellow-creatures are taught to govern
<PB N="253" REF="248"/>
their passions, reform their vices, and subdue their
worst enemies, which inhabit within their own bo∣soms?</P>
<P>BUT these objects are still too limited for the hu∣man
mind, which, being of celestial origin, swells
with the divinest and most enlarged affections, and
carrying its attention beyond kindred and acquaint∣ance,
extends its benevolent wishes to the most dis∣tant
posterity. It views liberty and laws as the source
of human happiness, and devotes itself, with the ut∣most
alacrity, to their guardianship and protection.
Toils, dangers, death itself carry their charms, when
we brave them for the public good, and ennoble that
being, which we generously sacrifice for the interests
of our country. Happy the man, whom indulgent
fortune allows to pay to virtue what he owes to na∣ture,
and to make a generous gift of what must other∣wise
be ravished from him by cruel necessity!</P>
<P>IN the true sage and patriot are united whatever
can distinguish human nature, or elevate mortal man
to a resemblance with the divinity. The softest be∣nevolence,
the most undaunted resolution, the ten∣derest
sentiments, the most sublime love of virtue, all
these animate successively his transported bosom. What
satisfaction, when he looks within, to find the most
turbulent passions tuned to just harmony and concord,
and every jarring sound banished from this enchant∣ing
<PB N="254" REF="249"/>
music! If the contemplation, even of inanimate
beauty, be so delightful; if it ravishes the senses,
even when the fair form is foreign to us: What must
be the effects of moral beauty? And what influence
must it have, when it embellishes our own mind, and
is the result of our own reflection and industry?</P>
<P><HI>BUT where is the reward of virtue? And what
recompence has nature provided for such important sacri∣fices,
as those of life and fortune, which we must osten
make to it?</HI> Oh, sons of earth! Are you ignorant of
the value of this celestial mistress? And do you mean∣ly
inquire for her portion. When you observe her ge∣nuine
charms? But know, that nature has been in∣dulgent
to human weakness, and has not left this fa∣vourite
child naked and unendowed. She has pro∣vided
virtue of the richest dowry; but being careful,
left the allurements of interest should engage such
suitors, as were insensible of the native worth of so
divine a beauty, she has wisely provided, that this
dowry can have no charms but in the eyes of those
who are already transported with the love of virtue.
GLORY is the portion of virtue, the sweet reward of
honourable toils, the triumphant crown, which co∣vers
the thoughtful head of the disinterested patriot,
or the dusty brow of the victorious warrior. Elevated
by so sublime a prize, the man of virtue looks down
with contempt on all the allurements of pleasure, and
all the menaces of danger. Death itself loses its ter∣rors,
<PB N="255" REF="250"/>
when he considers, that its dominion extends
only over a part of him, and that, in spite of death
and time, the rage of the elements, and the endless
vicissitude of human affairs, he is assured of an im∣mortal
fame among all the sons of men.</P>
<P>THERE surely is a being who presides over the
universe; and, who, with infinite wisdom and power,
has reduced the jarring elements into just order and
proportion. Let speculative reasoners dispute, how
far this beneficent being extends his care, and whe∣ther
he prolongs our existence beyond the grave, in
order to bestow on virtue its just reward, and render it
fully triumphant. The man of morals, without de∣ciding
any thing on so dubious a subject, is satisfied
with that portion which is marked out to him by the
supreme disposer of all things. Gratefully he accepts
of that farther reward prepared for him; but if disap∣pointed,
he thinks not virtue an empty name; but
justly esteeming it it's own reward, he gratefully
acknowleges the bounty of his creator, who by call∣ing
him forth into existence, has thereby afforded
him an opportunity of once acquiring so invaluable a
possession.</P>

<P>TO some philosophers it appears matter of sur∣prize,
that all mankind, possessing the same
nature, and being endowed with the same faculties,
should yet differ so widely in their pursuits and incli∣nations,
and that one should utterly condemn what is
fondly sought after by another. To some it appears
matter of still more surprize, that a man should differ so
widely from himself at different times; and, after
possession, reject with disdain what, before, was the
object of all his vows and wishes. To me this feverish
uncertainty and irresolution, in human conduct, seems
altogether unavoidable; nor can a rational soul, made
for the contemplation of the supreme being, and of
his works, ever enjoy tranquillity or satisfaction, while
detained in the ignoble pursuits of sensual pleasure or
popular applause. The divinity is a boundless ocean
of bliss and glory: Human minds are smaller streams,
which arising at first from this ocean, seek still, amid
<PB N="258" REF="252"/>
all their wanderings, to return to it, and to lose them∣selves
in that immensity of perfection. When check∣ed
in this natural courte, by vice or folly▪ they be∣come
furious and enraged; and, swelling to a tor∣rent,
do then spread horror and devastation on the
neighbouring plains.</P>
<P>IN vain, by pompous phrase and passionate ex∣pression,
each recommends his own pursuit, and in∣vites
the credulous hearers to an imitation of his life
and manners. The heart belies the countenance,
and sensibly feels, even amid the highest success, the
unsatisfactory nature of all those pleasures, which de∣tain
it from its true object. I examine the volup∣tuo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
man before enjoyment; I measure the vehe∣mence
of his desire, and the importance of his object;
I find that all his happiness proceeds only from that
hurry of thought which takes him from himself, and
turns his view from his guilt and misery. I consider
him a moment after; he has now enjoyed the plea∣sure,
which he fondly sought after. The sense of
his guilt and misery returns upon him with double
anguish: His mind tormented with fear and remorse;
his body depressed with disgust and satiety.</P>
<P>BUT a more august, at least a more haughty per∣sonage,
presents himself boldly to our censure; and
assuming the title of a philosopher and man of mo∣rals▪
offers to submit to the most rigid examination.
<PB N="259" REF="253"/>
He challenges with a visible, tho' concealed impa∣tience,
our approbation and applause; and seems of∣fended,
that we should hesitate a moment before we
break out into admiration of his virtue. Seeing this
impatience, I hesitate still more: I begin to examine
the motives of his seeming virtue: But behold! ere
I can enter upon this inquiry, he flings himself from
me; and addressing his discourse to that crowd of
heedless auditors, fondly abuses them by his magni∣ficent
pretensions.</P>
<P>O PHILOSOPHER! thy wisdom is vain, and thy
virtue unprofitable. Thou seekest the ignorant ap∣plauses
of men, not the solid reflections of thy own
conscience, or the more solid approabation of that be∣ing,
who, with one regard of his all-seeing eye, pe∣netrates
the universe. Thou surely art conscious of
the hollowness of thy pretended probity, whilst call∣ing
thyself a citizen, a son, a friend, thou forgettest
thy higher sovereign, thy true father, thy greatest be∣nefactor.
Where is the adoration due to such infinite
perfection, whence every thing good and valuable is
derived? Where is the gratitude, owing to thy cre∣ator,
who called thee forth from nothing, who placed
thee in all these relations to thy fellow-creatures, and
requiring thee to fulfil the duty of each relation, for∣bids
thee to neglect what thou owest to himself, the
most perfect being, to whom thou art connected by
the closest tye?</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="254"/>
BUT thou art thyself thy own idol: Thou worship∣pest
thy <HI>imaginary</HI> perfections: Or rather, sensible of
thy <HI>real</HI> imperfections, thou seekest only to deceive
the world, and to please thy fancy, by multiplying
thy ignorant admirers. Thus, not contented with ne∣glecting
what is most excellent in the universe, thou de∣sirest
to substitute in his place what is most vile and
contemptible.</P>
<P>CONSIDER all the works of mens hands; all the
inventions of human wit, in which thou affectest so
nice a discernment: Thou wilt find, that the most
perfect production still proceeds from the most perfect
thought, and that 'tis MIND alone, which we admire,
while we bestow our applause on the graces of a well
proportioned statue, or the symmetry of a noble pile.
The statuary, the architect comes still in view, and
makes us reflect on the beauty of his art and contri∣vance,
which, from a heap of unformed matter, could
extract such expressions and proportions. This supe∣rior
beauty of thought and intelligence thou thyself
acknowlegest, while thou invitest us to contemplate,
in thy conduct, the harmony of affections, the dignity
of sentiments, and all those graces of a mind, which
chiefly merit our attention. But why stoppest thou
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort? Seest thou nothing farther that is valuable?
Amid thy rapturous applauses of beauty and order,
art thou still ignorant where is to be found the most
consummate beauty? the most perfect order? Com∣pare
<PB N="261" REF="255"/>
the works of art with those of nature. The one
are but imitations of the other. The nearer art ap∣proaches
to nature, the more perfect is it esteemed.
But still, how wide are its nearest approaches, and
what an immense interval may be observed between
them? Art copies only the outside of nature, leaving
the inward and more admirable springs and principles;
as exceeding her imitation; as beyond her compre∣hension.
Art copies only the minute productions of
nature, despairing to reach that grandeur and magni∣ficence,
which are so astonishing in the masterly
works of her original. Can we then be so blind, as
not to discover an intelligence and a design in the ex∣quisite
and most stupendous contrivance of the uni∣verse?
Can we be so stupid, as not to feel the warmest
raptures of worship and adoration, upon the contem∣plation
of that intelligent being, so infinitely good and
wife?</P>
<P>THE most perfect happiness, surely, must arise
from the contemplation of the most perfect object.
But what more perfect than beauty and virtue? And
where is beauty to be found equal to that of the uni∣verse?
Or virtue, which can be compared to the be∣nevolence
and justice of the deity? If aught can
diminish the pleasure of this contemplation, it must be
either the narrowness of our faculties, which conceals
from us the greatest part of these beauties and per∣fections;
or the shortness of our lives, which allows
<PB N="262" REF="256"/>
not time sufficient to instruct us in them. But 'tis our
comfort, that if we employ worthily the faculties here
assigned us, they will be enlarged in another state of
existence, so as to render us more suitable worship∣pers
of our maker: And that the task, which can ne∣ver

<HEAD>ESSAY XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The SCEPTIC.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE long entertained a great suspicion, with
regard to the decisions of philosophers upon all
subjects, and found in myself a greater inclination to
dispute, than assent to their conclusions. There is
one mistake, to which they seem liable, almost without
exception; they consine too much their principles, and
make no account of that vast variety, which nature
has so much affected in all her operations. When a
philosopher has once laid hold of a favourite prin∣ciple,
which perhaps accounts for many natural effects,
he will extend the same principle over the whole cre∣ation,
and reduce to it every phaenomenon, tho' by
the most violent and absurd reasoning. Our own
mind being narrow and contracted, we cannot ex∣tend
our conception to the variety and extent of na∣ture;
but imagine, that she is as much bounded in
her operations, as we are in our speculations.</P>
<P>BUT if ever this infirmity of philosophers is to be
suspected on any occasion, 'tis in their reasonings con∣cerning
<PB N="264" REF="258"/>
human life, and the methods of attaining
happiness. In that case, they are led astray, not
only by the narrowness of their understandings, but
also by that of their passions. Almost every one has
a predominant inclination, to which all his other de∣sires
and affections submit, and which governs him,
tho', perhaps, with some intervals, thro' the whole
course of his life. 'Tis difficult for him to apprehend,
that any thing, which appears totally indifferent to
him, can ever give enjoyment to any person, or can
possess charms, which altogether escape his observa∣tion.
His own pursuits are always, in his account,
the most engaging: The objects of his passion, the
most valuable: And the road which he pursues, the
only one that leads to happiness.</P>
<P>BUT would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a
moment, there are many obvious instances and argu∣ments,
sufficient to undeceive them, and make them
enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not
see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among
our species, where each man seems fully satisfied with
his own course of life, and would esteem it the great∣est
unhappiness to be confined to that of his neigh∣bour?
Do they not feel in themselves, that what
pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the
change of inclination; and that it is not in their
power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or
appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what
<PB N="265" REF="259"/>
now appears indifferent or disagreeable? What is the
meaning therefore of those general preferences of the
town or country life, of a life of action or one of
pleasure, of retirement or society; when, besides the
different inclinations of different men, every one's ex∣perience
may convince him, that each of these kinds
of life is agreeable in its turn, and that their variety
or their judicious mixture chiefly contributes to the
rendering all of them agreeable.</P>
<P>BUT shall this business be allowed to go altogether
at adventures? And must a man consult only his hu∣mour
and inclination, in order to determine his course
of life, without ever employing his reason to inform
him what road is preferable, and leads most surely to
happiness? Is there no difference then between one
man's conduct and another?</P>
<P>I ANSWER, There is a great difference. One man,
following his inclinations, in chusing his course of life,
may employ much surer means for succeeding than
another, who is led by his inclination into the same
course of life, and pursues the same object. <HI>Are
riches the chief object of your desires?</HI> Acquire skill in
your profession; be diligent in the exercise of it;
enlarge the circle of your friends and acquaintance;
avoid pleasure and expence, and never be generous,
but with a view of gaining more than you could save
by frugality. <HI>Would you acquire the public esteem?</HI>
<PB N="266" REF="260"/>
Guard equally against the extremes of arrogance and
fawning. Let it appear that you set a value upon
yourself, but without despising others. If you fall
into either of the extremes, you either provoke men's
pride by your insolence, or teach them to despise you
by your timorous submission, and by the mean opi∣nion
which you seem to entertain of yourself.</P>
<P>THESE, you say, are the maxims of common pru∣dence
and discretion; what every parent inculcates on
his child, and what every man of sense pursues in the
course of life, which he has chosen.—What is it then
you desire more? Do you come to a philosopher, as
to a <HI>cunning man,</HI> to learn something by magic or
witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common
prudence and discretion?—Yes; we come to a phi∣losopher
to be instructed, How we shall chuse our
ends, more than the means for attaining these ends:
We want to know what desires we shall satisfy, what
passions we shall comply with, what appetites we shall
indulge. As to the rest, we trust to common sense,
and the general maxims of the world, for our in∣struction.</P>
<P>I AM sorry, then, I have pretended to be a philo∣sopher:
For I find your questions very perplexing;
and am in danger, if my answer be too rigid and se∣vere,
of passing sor a pedant and scholastic; if it be
too easy and free, of being taken for a preacher of
<PB N="267" REF="261"/>
vice and immorality. However, to satisfy you, I shall
deliver my opinion upon the matter, and only de∣sire
you to esteem it of as little consequence as I do
myself. By that means you will neither think it
worthy of your ridicule nor your anger.</P>
<P>IF we can depend upon any principle, which we
learn from philosophy, this, I think, may be consi∣dered
as certain and undoubted, That there is nothing
in itself, valuable or despicable, desireable or hateful,
beautiful or deformed; but that these attributes arise
from the particular constitution and fabric of human
sentiments and affections. What seems the most deli∣cious
food to one animal, appears loathsome to ano∣ther:
What affects the feeling of one with delight,
produces uneasiness to another. This is confessedly
the case with regard to all the bodily senses: But if
we examine the matter more accurately, we shall find
that the same observation holds even where the mind
concurs with the body, and mingles its sentiments
with the exterior appetites.</P>
<P>DESIRE this passionate lover to give you a character
of his mistress: He will tell you that he is at a loss for
words to describe her charms, and will ask you very
seriously if ever you was acquainted with a goddess
or an angel? If you answer that you never was: He
will then say, That 'tis impossible for you to form a
conception of such divine beauties as those which his
<PB N="268" REF="262"/>
charmer possesses; so complete a shape; such propor∣tioned
features; so engaging an air; such sweetness
of disposition; such gaiety of humour. You can in∣fer
nothing▪ however, from all this discourse, but
that the poor man is in love; and that the general
appetite between the sexes, which nature has infused
into all animals, is in him determined to a particular
object by some qualities, which give him pleasure.
The same divine creature, not only to a different ani∣mal,
but also to a different man, appears a mere
mortal being, and is beheld with the utmost indif∣ference.</P>
<P>NATURE has given all animals a like prejudice in
favour of their offspring. As soon as the helpless in∣fant
sees the light, tho' in every other eye it appears
a despicable and a miserable creature, it is regarded by
its fond parent with the utmost affection, and is pre∣ferred
to every other object, however perfect or ac∣complished.
The passion alone, arising from the ori∣ginal
structure and formation of human nature, be∣stows
a value on the most insignificant object.</P>
<P>WE may push the same observation further, and
may conclude, that even when the mind operates
alone, and feeling the sentiments of blame or appro∣bation,
pronounces one object deformed and odious,
another beautiful and amiable; I say, that even in
this case, these qualities are not really in the objects,
<PB N="269" REF="263"/>
but belong entirely to the sentiments of that mind
which blames or praises. I grant, that it will be
more difficult to make this proposition evident, and
as it were, palpable, to negligent thinkers, because
nature is more uniform in the sentiments of the mind
than in most feelings of the body, and produces a
nearer resemblance in the inward than in the outward
part of human kind. There is something approach∣ing
to principles in mental taste; and critics can rea∣son
and dispute much more plausibly than cooks or
perfumers. We may observe, however, That this
uniformity among human kind, hinders not, but that
there is a considerable diversity in the sentiments of
beauty and worth, and that education, custom, pre∣judice,
caprice, and humour frequently vary our taste
of this kind. You will never convince a man, who
is not accustomed to ITALIAN music, and has not an
ear to follow its intricacies, that a SCOTCH tune is
not preferable. You have not even any single argu∣ment,
beyond your own taste, which you can employ
in your behalf: And to your antagonist, his particu∣lar
taste will always appear a much more convincing
argument to the contrary. If you be wise, each of
you will allow, that the other may be in the right;
and having many other instances of this diversity of
taste, you will both confess, that beauty and worth
are merely of a relative nature, and consist in an
agreeable sentiment, produced by an object on a par∣ticular
<PB N="270" REF="264"/>
mind, according to the peculiar structure and
constitution of that mind.</P>
<P>BY this diversity of sentiment, observable in human
kind, nature has, perhaps, intended to make us sen∣sible
of her authority, and let us see what surprizing
changes she could produce on the passions and de∣sires
of mankind, merely by the change of their in∣ward
fabric, without any alteration on the objects.
The vulgar may even be convinced by this argument:
But men accustomed to thinking may draw a more
convincing, at least a more general argument, from
the very nature of the subject.</P>
<P>IN the operation of reasoning, the mind does no∣thing
but run over its objects, as they are supposed
to stand in reality, without adding any thing to them,
or diminishing any thing from them. If I examine
the PTOLOMAIC and COPERNICAN systems, I endea∣vour
only, by my enquiries, to know the real situa∣tion
of the planets; that is, in other words, I endea∣vour
to give them, in my mind or conception, the
same relations which they bear towards each other in
the heavens. To this operation of the mind, there∣fore,
there seem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be always a real, tho' often an
unknown standard, in the nature of things; nor is truth
or falshood variable by the various apprehensions of
mankind. Tho' all human race should for ever con∣clude,
that the sun moves, and the earth remains at
<PB N="271" REF="265"/>
rest, the sun stirs not an inch from his place for all
these reasonings; and such conclusions are eternally
false and erroneous.</P>
<P>BUT the case is not the same with the qualities of
<HI>beautiful and deformed, desirable and odious,</HI> as with
truth and falshood. In the former case, the mind is
not contented with merely surveying its objects, as
they stand in themselves: It also feels a sentiment of
delight or uneasiness, approbation or blame, conse∣quent
to that survey: and this sentiment determines
it to pronounce the object <HI>beautiful or deformed, de∣sirable
or odious.</HI> Now, 'tis evident, that this senti∣ment
must depend upon the particular fabric or struc∣ture
of the mind, which enables such particular ob∣jects
to operate in such a particular manner, and pro∣duces
a sympathy or conformity between the mind
and the objects. Vary the structure of the mind or
inward organs, the sentiment no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onger follows, the'
the objects remain the same. The sentiment being
different from the object, and arising from its opera∣tion
upon the organs of the mind, an alteration upon
the latter must vary the effect, nor can the same ob∣ject,
presented to a mind totally different, produce the
same sentiment.</P>
<P>THIS conclusion every one is apt to form of him∣self,
without much philosophy, where the sentiment
is evidently distinguishable from the object. Who is
<PB N="272" REF="266"/>
not sensible, that power, and glory, and vengeance, are
not desirable of themselves, but derive all their value
from the structure of human passions, which begets a
desire towards such particular objects? But with re∣gard
to beauty, either natural or moral, the case is
commonly supposed to be different. The agreeable
quality is thought to lie in the object, not in the sen∣timent;
and that merely because the sentiment is not
so turbulent and violent as to distinguish itself, in an
evident manner, from the perception of the object.</P>
<P>BUT a very little reflection suffices to distinguish
them. A man may know exactly all the circles and
ellipses of the COPERNICAN system, and all the irre∣gular
spirals of the PTOLOMAIC, without perceiving
that the former is more beautiful than the latter.
EUCLID has very fully explained every quality of the
circle, but has not, in any proposition, said a word
of its beauty. The reason is evident. Beauty is not
a quality of the circle. It lies not in any part of the
line <HI>whose</HI> parts are all equally distant from a com∣mon
centre. It is only the effect, which that figure
operates upon the mind, whose particular fabric or
structure renders it susceptible of such sentiments. In
vain would you look for it in the circle, or seek i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
either by your senses, or by mathematical reasonings,
in all the properties of that figure.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="267"/>
THE mathematician, who took no other pleasure
in reading Virgil, but that of examining ENEAS'S
voyage by the map, might understand perfectly the
meaning of every Latin word, imployed by that di∣vine
author; and consequently, might have a distinct
idea of the whole narration. He would even have
a more distinct idea of it, than they could have who
had not studied so exactly the geography of the poem.
He knew, therefore, every thing in the poem: But
he was ignorant of its beauty; because the beauty,
properly speaking, lies not in the poem, but in the
sentiment or taste of the reader. And where a man
has no such delicacy of temper, as to make him feel
this sentiment, he must be ignorant of the beauty,
tho' possessed of the science and understanding of an
angel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WERE I not afraid of appearing too philosophical, I should remind my reader of that famous doctrine, supposed to be fully proved in modern times, “That tastes and colours, and all other sensible qualities, lie not in the bodies, but merely in the senses.” The case is the same with beauty and deformity, virtue and vice. This doctrine, however, takes off no more from the reality of the latter qualities, than from that of the former; nor need it give any umbrag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> either to critics or mora∣lists. Tho' colours were allowed to lie only in the eye, would dyers or painters ever be less regarded or esteemed? There is a sufficient uniformity in the senses and feelings of mankind, to make all these qualities the objects of art and reasoning, and to have the greatest influence on life and manners. And as 'tis certain, that the discovery above-mentioned in natural philosophy, makes no alteration on action and conduct; why should a like discovery in moral philosophy make any alteration?</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="268"/>
THE inference upon the whole is, that it is not
from the value or worth of the object, which any
person pursues, that we can determine his enjoyment,
but merely from the passion with which he pursues it,
and the success which he meets with in his pursuit.
Objects have absolutely no worth or value in them∣selves.
They derive their worth merely from the
passion. If that be strong, and steady, and success∣ful,
the person is happy. It cannot reasonably be
doubted, but a little miss, drest in a new gown for a
dancing-school ball, receives as compleat enjoyment
as the greatest orator, who triumphs in the splendor
of his eloquence, while he governs the passions and
resolutions of a numerous assembly.</P>
<P>ALL the difference, therefore, betwixt one man
and another, with regard to life, consists either in the
<HI>passion,</HI> or in the <HI>enjoyment:</HI> And these differences are
sufficient to produce the wide extremes of happiness
and misery.</P>
<P>To be happy, the <HI>passion</HI> must neither be too violent
nor too remiss. In the first case, the mind is in a
perpetural hurry and tumult; in the second, it sinks
into a disagreeable indolence and lethargy.</P>

To be happy, the passion must be benign and social;
not rough or fierce. The affections of the latter kind
are not near so agreeable, to the feeling, as those of
the former. Who will compare rancour and animo∣sity,
envy and revenge, to friendship, benignity, cle∣mency
and gratitude?</P>
<P>To be happy, the passion must be chearful and gay,
not gloomy and melancholy. A propensity to hope
and joy is real riches: One to fear and sorrow, real
poverty.</P>
<P>SOME passions or inclinations, in the <HI>enjoyment</HI> of
their object, are not so steady or constant as others,
nor convey such durable pleasure and satisfaction.
<HI>Philosophical devotion,</HI> for instance, like the enthusi∣asm
of a poet, is the transitory effect of high spirits,
great leisure, a fine genius, and a habit of study and
contemplation: But notwithstanding all these circum∣stances,
an abstracted, invisible object, like that which
<HI>natural</HI> religion alone presents to us, cannot long ac∣tuate
the mind, or be of any moment in life. To
render the passion of continuance, we must find some
method of affecting the senses and imagination, and
must embrace some <HI>historical</HI> as well as <HI>philosophical</HI>
accounts of the divinity. Popular superstition and
observances are even found to be of use in this par∣ticular.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="270"/>
THO' the tempers of men be very different, yet we
may safely pronounce in general, that a life of plea∣sure
cannot support itself so long as one of business,
but is much more subject to satiety and disgust. The
amusements, which are the most durable, have all a
mixture of application and attention in them; such as
gaming and hunting. And in general, business and
action fill up all the great vacancies of human life.</P>
<P>BUT where the temper is the best disposed for any
<HI>enjoyment,</HI> the object is often wanting: And in this
respect, the passions, which pursue <HI>external</HI> objects,
contribute not so much to happiness, as those which
rest in ourselves; since we are neither so certain of at∣taining
such objects, nor so secure of possessing them.
A passion for learning is preserable, with regard to
happiness, to one for riches.</P>
<P>SOME men are possessed of great strength of mind;
and even when they pursue <HI>external</HI> objects, are not
much affected by a disappointment, but renew their
application and industry with the greatest chearful∣ness.
Nothing contributes more to happiness than
this turn of mind.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this short and imperfect sketch of
human life, the happiest disposition of mind is the
<HI>virtuous;</HI> or, in other words, that which leads to ac∣tion-and
employment, renders us sensible to the so∣cial
<PB N="277" REF="271"/>
passions, steels the heart against the assaults of for∣tune,
reduces the affections to a just moderation,
makes our own thoughts an entertainment to us, and
inclines us rather to the pleasures of society and con∣versation,
than to those of the senses. This, in the
mean time, must be obvious to the most careless rea∣soner,
that all dispositions of mind are not alike fa∣vourable
to happiness, and that one passion or humour
may be extremely desirable, while another is equally
disagreeable. And indeed, all the difference between
the conditions of life depends upon the mind; nor is
there any one situation of affairs, in itself, preferable
to another. Good and ill, both natural and moral,
are entirely relative to human sentiment and affec∣tion.
No man would ever be unhappy, could he al∣ter
his feelings. PROTEUS-like, he would elude all
attacks, by the continual alterations of his shape and
form.</P>
<P>BUT of this resource nature has, in a great mea∣sure,
deprived us. The fabric and constitution of our
mind no more depends on our choice, than that of our
body. The generality of men have not even the
smallest notion, that any alteration in this respect can
ever be desirable. As a stream necessarily follows
the several inclinations of the ground, on which it
runs; so are the ignorant and thoughtless part of
mankind actuated by their natural propensities. Such
are effectually excluded from all pretensions to phi∣losophy,
<PB N="278" REF="272"/>
and the <HI>medicine of the mind,</HI> so much boasted.
But even upon the wise and thoughtful, nature has a
prodigious influence; nor is it always in a man's
power, by the utmost art and industry, to correct his
temper, and attain that virtuous character, to which he
aspires. The empire of philosophy extends over a
few: and with regard to these too, her authority is
very weak and limited. Men may well be sensible of
the value of virtue, and may desire to attain it; but
'tis not always certain, that they will be successful in
their wishes.</P>
<P>WHOEVER considers, without prejudice, the course
of human actions, will find, that mankind are almost
entirely guided by constitution and temper, and that
general maxims have little influence, but so far as they
affect our taste or sentiment. If a man have a lively
sense of honour and virtue, with moderate passions,
his conduct will always be conformable to the rules of
morality; or if he depart from them, his return will
be easy and expeditious. But on the other hand,
where one is born of so perverse a frame of mind, of
so callous and insensible a disposition, as to have no
relish for virtue and humanity, no sympathy with his
fellow-creatures, no desire of esteem and applause;
such a one must be allowed entirely incurable, nor is
there any remedy in philosophy. He reaps no satis∣faction
but from low and sensual objects, or from the
indulgence of malignant passions: He feels no remorse
<PB N="279" REF="273"/>
to controul his vicious inclinations: He has not even
that sense or taste, which is requisite to make him de∣sire
a better character: For my part, I know not how
I should address myself to such a one, or by what ar∣guments
I should endeavour to reform him. Should
I tell him of the inward satisfaction which results from
laudable and humane actions, the delicate pleasures of
disinterested love and friendship, the lasting enjoy∣ments
of a good name and an established character,
he might still reply, that these were, perhaps, plea∣sures
to such as were susceptible to them; but that,
for his part, he finds himself of a quite different turn
and disposition. I must repeat it; my philosophy af∣fords
no remedy in such a case, nor could I do any
thing but lament this person's unhappy condition.
But then I ask, If any other philosophy can afford a
remedy; or if it be possible, by any system, to render
all mankind virtuous, however perverse may be their
natural frame of mind? Experience will soon convince
us of the contrary; and I will venture to affirm, that
perhaps, the chief benefit, which results from philo∣sophy,
arises in an indirect manner, and proceeds
more from its secret, insensible influence, than from
its immediate application.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that a serious attention to the sci∣ences
and liberal arts, softens and humanizes the
temper, and cherishes those fine emotions, in which
true virtue and honor consists. It rarely, very rarely
<PB N="280" REF="274"/>
happens, that a man of taste and learning is not, at
least, an honest man, whatever frailties may attend
him. The bent of his mind to speculative studies
must mortify in him the passions of interest and ambi∣tion,
and must, at the same time, give him a greater
sensibility of all the decencies and duties of life. He
feels more fully a moral distinction in characters and
manners, nor is his sense of this kind diminished, but,
on the contrary, it is much encreased, by his specu∣lations.</P>
<P>BESIDES such insensible changes upon the temper
and disposition, 'tis highly probable, that others may
be produced by study and application. The prodi∣gious
effects of education may convince us, that the
mind is not altogether stubborn and inflexible, but
will admit of many alterations from its original make
and structure. Let a man propose to himself the mo∣del
of a character, which he approves of: Let him be
well acquainted with those particulars, in which his
own character deviates from this model: Let him
keep a constant watch over himself, and bend his
mind, by a continual effort, from the vices, towards
the virtues; and I doubt not but, in time, he will find,
in his temper, an alteration to the better.</P>
<P>HABIT is another powerful means of reforming
the mind, and implanting in it good dispositions
and inclinations. A man who continues in a course
<PB N="281" REF="275"/>
of sobriety and temperance, will hate riot and disor∣der:
If he engage in business or study, indolence
will seem a punishment to him: If he constrain him∣self
to practise beneficence and affability, he will soon
abhor all instances of pride and violence. Where one
is thorowly convinced, that the virtuous course of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife
is preferable; if he has but resolution enough, for
some time, to impose a violence on himself; his re∣formation
need not be despaired of. The misfortune
is, that this conviction and this resolution never can
have place, unless a man be, before-hand, tolerably
virtuous.</P>
<P>HERE then is the chief triumph of art and philo∣sophy:
It insensibly refines the temper, and it points
out to us those dispositions which we should endeavour
to attain, by a constant <HI>bent</HI> of mind, and by repeated
<HI>habit.</HI> Beyond this I cannot acknowlege it to have
great influence; and I must entertain doubts concern∣ing
all those exhortations and consolations, which are
in such vogue among all speculative reasoners.</P>
<P>WE have already observed, that no objects are, of
themselves, desirable or odious, valuable or despica∣ble;
but that objects acquire these qualities from the
particular character and constitution of the mind,
which surveys them. To diminish therefore, or aug∣ment
any person's value for an object, to excite or mo∣derate
his passions, there are no direct arguments or
<PB N="282" REF="276"/>
reasons, which can be employed with any force or
influence. The catching flies, like DOMITIAN, if it
give more pleasure, is preferable to the hunting wild
beasts, like WILLIAM RU<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>US, or conquering king∣doms,
like ALEXANDER.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the value of every object can be deter∣mined
only by the sentiments or passions of every in∣dividual,
we may observe, that the passions, in pro∣nouncing
their verdict, consider not the object simply,
as it is in itself, but survey it with all the circum∣stances,
which attend it. A man transported with
joy, on account of his possessing a diamond, confines
not his view to the glistering s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one before him: He
also considers its rarity, and from thence chiefly arises
his pleasure and exultation. Here therefore a philo∣sopher
may step in, and suggest particular views and
considerations, and circumstances, which otherwise
would have escaped us; and, by that means, he may
either moderate or excite any particular passion.</P>
<P>IT may seem unreasonable absolutely to deny the
authority of philosophy in this respect: But it must
be confessed, that there lies this strong presumption
against it, that if these views be natural and obvious,
they would have occured of themselves, without the
assistance of philosophy; if they be not natural, they
never can have any influence on the affections. <HI>These</HI>
are of a very delicate nature, and cannot be forced
<PB N="283" REF="277"/>
or constrained by the utmost art or industry. A con∣sideration,
which we seek for on purpose, which we
enter into with difficulty, which we retain with care
and attention, can never produce those genuine and
durable movements of passion, which are the result of
nature, and the constitution of the mind. A man
may as well pretend to cure himself of love, by view∣ing
his mistress thro' the <HI>artificial</HI> medium of a micros∣cope,
or prospect, and beholding there the coarseness
of her skin, and monstrous disproportion of her fea∣tures,
as hope to excite or moderate any passion by
the <HI>artificial</HI> arguments of a SENECA or an EPICTE∣TUS.
The remembrance of the natural aspect and
situation of the objects will, in both cases, still re∣turn
upon him. The reflections of philosophy are too
subtile and distant to take place in common life, or
eradicate any affection. The air is too fine to breathe
in where it is above the winds and clouds of the at∣mosphere.</P>
<P>ANOTHER defect of those refined reflections, which
philosophy presents to us, is, that commonly they can∣not
diminish or extinguish our vicious paessions, with∣out
diminishing or extinguishing such as are virtuous,
and rendering the mind totally indifferent and inac∣tive.
They are so the most part, general, and are
applicable to all our affections. In vain do we hope
to direct their influence only to one side. If by in∣cessant
study and meditation we have rendered them
<PB N="284" REF="278"/>
very intimate and present to us, they will operate
thro'out, and spread an universal insensibility over the
mind. When we destroy the nerves, we extinguish
the sense of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> leasure, together with that of pain.</P>
<P>IT will be easy, by one glance of the eye, to find
one or other of these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fects in most of those philoso∣phical
reflections, so much celebrated both in ancient
and modern times. <HI>Let not the injuries or violence of
men,</HI> say the philosophers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLUT. de ira cohibenda.</NOTE>, <HI>ever discon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se you by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nger or hatred. Would you be angry at the ape for its
malice, or the tyger for its ferocity?</HI> This reflection leads
us into a bad opinion of human nature, and must ex∣tinguish
the social affections. It tends also to remove
all remorse for a man's own crimes, when he con∣siders,
that vice is as natural to mankind, as the par∣ticular
instinct to brute creatures.</P>
<P><HI>ALL ills arise from the order of the universe, which
is absolutely perfect. Would you wish to disturb so di∣vine
an order for the sake of your own particular interest?</HI>
What if the ills I suffer arise from malice or oppres∣sion?
<HI>But the vices and imperfections of men are also
comprehend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the order of the universe,</HI>
<Q><L>If plagues and earthqu kes break not heav'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s design,</L>

<P><HI>NOTHING can be more destructive,</HI> says FONTE∣NELLE,
<HI>to ambition, and the passion for conquest, than
the true <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of astronomy. What a poor thing is even
the whole globe in comparison of the infinite extent of
nature?</HI> This consideration is evidently too distant
ever to have any effect. And if it had any, would
it not destroy patriotism as well as ambition? The
same gallant author adds with some reason, that the
bright eyes of the ladies are the only objects, which
lose nothing of their lustre or value from the most ex∣tensive
views of astronomy and philosophy, but stand
proof against every system. Would philosophers ad∣vise
us to limit our affection to them?</P>
<P><HI>EXILE,</HI> says PLUTARCH to a friend in banish∣ment,
<HI>is no evil: Mathematicians tell us, that the
<PB N="287" REF="281"/>
whole earth is but as a point, compared to the heavens.
To change one's country, then, is little more than to re∣move
from one street to another. Man is not a plant,
rooted to a certain spot of earth: All soils and all cli∣mates
are alike suited to him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De exilio.</NOTE>. These topics are ad∣mirable,
could they fall only into the hands of banish∣ed
persons. But what if they come also to the know∣ledge
of those employed in public affairs, and destroy
all their attachment to their native country? Or will
they operate like the quack's medicine, which is
equally good for a diabetes and a dropsy?</P>
<P>'TIS certain, were a superior being thrust into a
human body, that the whole of life would to him ap∣pear
so mean, contemptible and puerile, that he never
could be induced to take part in any thing, and would
scarcely give attention to what passes around him.
To engage him to such a condescension as to play
even the part of a PHILIP with zeal and alacrity,
would be much more difficult than to constrain the
same PHILIP, after having been a king and a con∣queror
during fifty years, to mend old shoes with pro∣per
care and attention; the occupation which LU∣CIAN
assigns him in the infernal regions. Now all
the same topics of disdain towards human affairs,
which could operate on this supposed being, occur also
to a philosopher; but being, in some measure, dis∣proportioned
to human capacity, and not being for∣tified
<PB N="288" REF="282"/>
with the experience of any thing better, they
make not a full impression on him. He sees, but he
feels not sufficiently their truth; and is always a su∣blime
philosopher, when he needs not; that is, as
long as nothing disturbs him, or rouzes his affections.
While others play, he wonders at their keenness and
ardour; but he no sooner puts in his own stake, than he
is commonly transported with the same passions, which
he had so much condemned while he remained a
simple spectator.</P>
<P>THERE are chiefly two considerations to be met
with in books of philosophy, from which any im∣portant
effect is to be expected, and that because
these considerations are drawn from common life,
and occur upon the most superficial view of human
affairs. When we reflect on the shortness and uncer∣tainty
of life, how despicable seem all our pursuits of
happiness? And even, if we would extend our con∣cern
beyond our own life, how frivolous appear our
most enlarged and most generous projects; when we
consider the incessant changes and revolutions of hu∣man
affairs, by which laws and learning, books and
governments are hurried away by time, as by a rapid
stream, and are lost in the immense ocean of matter?
Such a reflection certainly tends to mortify all our pas∣sions:
But does it not thereby counterwork the arti∣fice
of nature, who has happily deceived us into an
opinion, that human life is of some importance? And
<PB N="289" REF="283"/>
may not such a reflection be employed with success by
voluptuous reasoners, in order to lead us from the
paths of action and virtue, into the flowery fields of
indolence and pleasure?</P>
<P>WE are informed by THUCYDIDES, that, during
the famous plague of ATHENS, when death seemed
present to every one, a dissolute mirth and gaiety pre∣vailed
among the people, who exhorted one another
to make the most of life as long as it endured. The
same observation is made by BOCCACE with regard to
the plague of FLORENCE. A like principle makes
soldiers, during war, to be more addicted to riot and
expence, than any other race of men. Present plea∣sure
is always of importance; and whatever dimi∣nishes
the importance of all other objects must be∣stow
on it an additional influence and value.</P>
<P>THE <HI>second</HI> philosophical consideration, which may
often have an influence on the affections, is derived
from a comparison of our own condition with the
condition of others. This comparison we are conti∣nually
making, even in common life; but the mis∣fortune
is, that we are apt rather to compare our
situation with that of our superiors, than with that
of our inferiors. A philosopher corrects this na∣tural
infirmity, by turning his view to the other
side, in order to render himself easy in the situ∣ation
in which fortune has placed him. There are
few people, who are not susceptible of some consola∣tion
<PB N="290" REF="284"/>
from this reflection, tho' to a very good natured
man, the view of human miseries should rather pro∣duce
sorrow than comfort, and add to his lamenta∣tions
for his own misfortunes a deep compassion for
those of others. Such is the imperfection, even of
the best of these philosophical topics of consolation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The sceptic, perhaps, carries the matter too far, when he limits all philosophical topics and reflections to these two. There seem to be others, whose truth is undeniable, and whose natural tendency is to tranquilize and soften all the passions. Philosophy greedily seizes these, studies them, weighs them, commits them to the memory, and familiarizes them to the mind: and their influence on tempers, which are thoughtful, gentle, and mode∣rate, may be considerable. But what is their influence, you will say, if the temper be antecedently disposed after the same man∣ner which they pretend to form it? They may, at least, fortify that temper, and furnish it with views, by which it may enter∣tain and nourish itself. Here are a few examples of such philo∣sophical reflections.</P>
<P>1. Is it not certain, that every condition has concealed ills? Then why envy any body?</P>
<P>2. Every one has known ills; and there is a compensation throughout. Why not be contented with the present?</P>
<P>3. Custom deadens the sense both of the good and the ill, and levels every thing.</P>
<P>4. Health and humour all. The rest of little consequence, except these be affected.</P>
<P>5. How many other goods have I? Then why be vexed for one ill?</P>
<P>6. How many are happy in the condition of which I com∣plain? How many envy me?</P>
<P>7. Every good must be paid for: Fortune by labour, favour by flattery. Would I keep the price, yet have the commodity?</P>
<P>8. Expect not too great happiness in life. Human nature ad∣mits it not.</P>
<P>9. Propose not a happiness too complicated. But does that depend on me? Yes: The first choice does. Life is like a game: One may choose the game: And passion, by degrees, seizes the proper object.</P>
<P>10. Anticipate by your hopes and fancy future consolation, which time infallibly brings to every a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iction.</P>
<P>11. I desire to be rich. Why? That I may possess many fine objects; houses, gardens, equipage, &amp;c. How many fine ob∣jects does nature offer to every one without expence? If enjoyed, sufficient. If not: See the effect of custom or of temper, which would soon take off the relish of the riches.</P>
<P>12. I desire <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame. Let this occur: If I act well, I shall have the esteem of all my acquaintance. And what is all the rest to me?</P>
<P>These reflections are so obvious, that 'tis a wonder they oc∣cur not to every man: So convincing, that 'tis a wonder they persuade not every man. But perhaps they do occur to and per∣suade most men; when they consider human life, by a general and calm survey: But where any real, affecting incident hap∣pens; when passion is awakened, fancy agitated, example draws, and counsel urges; the philosopher is lost in the man, and he searches in vain for that persuasion, which before seemed so firm and unshaken. What remedy for this inconvenience? Assist yourself by a frequent perusal of the entertaining moralists: Have recourse to the learning of PLUTARCH, the imagination of LUCIAN, the eloquence of CICERO, the wit of SENECA, the gaiety of MONTAIGNE, the sublimity of SHAFTESBURY. Moral precepts, so couched, strike deep, and fortify the mind against the illusions of passion. But trust not altogether to ex∣ternal aid: By habit and study acquire that philosophic temper, which both gives force to reflection, and by rendering a great part of your happiness independent, takes off the edge from all disorderly passions, and tranquilizes the mind. Despise not these helps; but confide not too much in them neither; unless nature has been favourable in the temper, with which she has endowed you.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="285"/>
I SHALL conclude this subject with observing, That
tho' virtue be undoubtedly the best choice, when it is
<PB N="292" REF="286"/>
attainable; yet such is the disorder and confusion of
human affairs, that no perfect oeconomy or regular
distribution of happiness and misery is ever, in this
life, to be expected. Not only the goods of fortune,
and the endowments of the body (both which are of
great importance) not only these advantages, I say,
are unequally divided betwixt the virtuous and vici∣cus,
but even the mind itself partakes, in some de∣gree,
of this disorder, and the most worthy character,
by the very oeconomy of the passions, enjoys not al∣ways
the highest felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="287"/>
'Tis observable, that tho' every bodily disease or
pain proceeds from some disorder in the parts, yet the
pain is not always proportioned to the disorder; but
is greater or less, according to the greater or less sen∣sibility
of the part, upon which the noxious humours
exert their influence. A <HI>tooth-ach</HI> produces more vi∣olent
convulsions of pain than a <HI>ph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sis</HI> or a <HI>dro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sy.</HI>
In like manner, with regard to the constitution of the
mind, we may observe, that all vice is indeed perni∣cious;
but yet the disturbance or pain is not measured
out by nature with exact proportion to the degrees of
vice, nor is the man of highest virtue, even abstract∣ing
from external accidents, always the most happy.
A gloomy and melancholy disposition is certainly, <HI>to
our sentiments,</HI> a vice or imperfection; but as it may
be accompanied with great sense of honour and great
integrity, it may be found in very worthy character;
tho' 'tis sufficient alone to imbitter life, and render the
person affected with it compleatly miserable. On the
other hand, a selfish villain may possess a spring and
alacrity of temper, a certain <HI>gaiety of heart,</HI> which is
indeed a good quality, but which is rewarded much
beyond its merit, and when attended with good for∣tune,
will compensate the uneasiness and remorse aris∣ing
from all the other vices.</P>
<P>I SHALL add, as an observation to the same pur∣pose,
that if a man be liable to a vice or imperfection,
it may often happen, that a good quality, which he
posseses with it, will render him more miserable, than
<PB N="294" REF="288"/>
if he were completely vicious. A person of such im∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty
of temper, as to be easily broke by affeiction,
is more unhappy for being endowed with a generous
and friendly disposition, which gives him a lively con∣cern
for others, and exposes him the more to fortune
and accidents. A sense of shame, in an imperfect
character, is certainly a virtue, but produces great un∣easiness
and remorse, from which the abandoned vil∣lain
is entirely free. A very amorous complexion,
with a heart incapable of friendship, is happier than
the same excess in love, with a generosity of temper,
which transports a man beyond himself, and renders
him a total slave to the object of his passion.</P>
<P>IN a word, human life is more governed by for∣tune
than by reason; is to be regarded more as a
d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l pastime than as a serious occupation; and is more
influenced by particular humour than by general prin∣ciples.
Shall we engage ourselves in it with passion
and anxiety? It is not worthy of so much concern.
Shall we be indifferent about what happens? We lose all
the pleasure of the game by our phlegm and careless∣ness.
While we are reasoning concerning life, life is
gone; and death, tho' <HI>perhaps</HI> they receive him dif∣ferently,
yet treats alike the fool and the philosopher.
To reduce life to exact rule and method, is com∣monly
a painful, oft a fruitless occupation: And is it
not also a proof, that we overvalue the prize for
<PB N="295" REF="289"/>
which we contend? Even to reason so carefully con∣cerning
it, and to fix with accuracy its just idea,
would be over-valuing it, were it not that, to some
tempers, this occupation is one of the most amusing,
in which life could possibly be employed.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of POLYGAMY and DIVORCES.</HEAD>
<P>As marriage is an engagement entered into by
mutual consent, and has for its end the propa∣gation
of the species, 'tis evident, that it must be sus∣ceptible
of all the variety of conditions, which con∣sent
establishes, provided they be not contrary to this
end.</P>
<P>A MAN, in conjoining himself to a woman, is
bound to her according to the terms of his engage∣ment:
In begetting children, he is bound, by all the
ties of nature and humanity, to provide for their sub∣sistence
and education. When he has performed these
two parts of duty, no being can reproach him with
injustice or injury. And as the terms of his engage∣ment,
as well as the methods of subsisting his offspring,
may be very various, 'tis mere superstition to imagine,
that marriage can be entirely uniform, and will ad∣mit
only of one mode or form. Did not human laws
restrain the natural liberty of men, every particular
<PB N="298" REF="291"/>
marriage would be as different, as contracts or ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gains
of any other kind or species.</P>
<P>As circumstances vary, and the laws propose dif∣ferent
advantages, we find, that, in different times
and places, they impose different conditions on this
important contract. In TONQUIN 'tis usual for the
sailors, when the ships come into the harbour, to
marry for the season; and, notwithstanding this pre∣carious
engagement, they are assured, 'tis said of the
strictest fidelity to their bed, as well as in the whole
management of their affairs from those temporary
spouses.</P>
<P>I CANNOT, at present, recollect my authorities;
but I have somewhere read, That the republic of
ATHENS having lost many of its citizens by war and
pestilence, allowed every man to marry two wives, in
order the sooner to repair the waste which had been
made by these calamities. The poet EURIPIDES
happened to be coupled to two noisy Vixens, who so
plagued him with their jealousies and quarrels, that
he became ever after a professed <HI>woman-hater;</HI> and
is the only theatrical writer, perhaps the only poet,
who ever entertained an aversion against the whole
sex.</P>
<P>IN that agreeable romance, called <HI>the History of the</HI>
SEVARAMBIANS, where a great many men and a
<PB N="299" REF="292"/>
few women are supposed to be shipwrecked on a de∣sert
coast; the captain of the troop, in order to ob∣viate
those endless quarrels which arose, regulates
their marriages after the following manner: he takes
a handsome female to himself alone; assigns one to
every couple of inferior officers; and to five of the
lowest rank he gives one wise in common. Could the
greatest legislator, in such circumstances, have con∣trived
matters with greater wisdom?</P>
<P>THE ancient BRITONS had a very singular kind of
marriage, which is to be met with among no other
people. Any number of them, as ten or a dozen,
joined in a society together, which was perhaps re∣quisite
for mutual defence in those barbarous times.
In order to link this society the closer, they took an
equal number of wives in common, and whatever
children were born, were reputed to belong to all of
them, and were accordingly provided for by the whole
community.</P>
<P>AMONG the inferior creatures, nature herself, being
the supreme legislator, prescribes all the laws which
regulate their marriages; and varies those laws ac∣cording
to the different circumstances of the creature.
Where she furnishes, with ease, food and defence to
the new-born animal, the present embrace terminates
the marriage; and the care of the offspring is commit∣ted
entirely to the female. Where the food is of more
<PB N="300" REF="293"/>
difficult purchase, the marriage continues for one sea∣son,
till the common progeny can provide for itself;
and then the union immediately dissolves, and leaves
each of the parties free to enter into a new engagement
at the ensuing season. But nature having endowed man,
with reason, has not so exactly regulated every article of
his marriage contract, but has left him to adjust them,
by his own prudence, according to his particular cir∣cumstances
and situation. Municipal laws are a sup∣ply
to the wisdom of each individual; and, at the
same time, by restraining the natural liberty of men,
make the private interest submit to the interest of the
public. All regulations, therefore, on this head are
equally lawful, and equally conformable to the prin∣ciples
of nature; tho' they are not all equally conve∣nient,
or equally useful to society. The laws may
allow of polygamy, as among the <HI>Eastern</HI> nations; or
of voluntary divorces, as among the GREEKS and RO∣MANS;
or they may confine one man to one woman,
during the whole course of their lives, as among the
modern EUROPEANS. It may not be disagreeable to
consider the advantages and disadvantages which re∣sult
from each of these institutions.</P>
<P>THE advocates for polygamy may recommend it as
the only effectual remedy for the furies and disorders
of love, and the only expedient for freeing men from
that slavery to the females, which the natural violence
of our passions has imposed on us. By this means
<PB N="301" REF="294"/>
alone can we regain our right of sovereignty; and,
sating our appetite, re-establish the authority of reason
in our minds, and, of consequence, our own au∣thority
in our families. Man, like a weak sovereign,
being unable to support himself against the wiles and
intrigue, of his subjects, must play one faction against
another, and become absolute by the mutual jealousies
of the females. <HI>To divide and to govern</HI> is an univer∣sal
maxim; and by neglecting it, the EUROPEANS
undergo a more grievous and a more ignominious sla∣very
than the TURKS or PERSIANS, who are sub∣jected
indeed to a sovereign, who lies at a distance
from them, but in their domestic affairs rule with an
uncontroulable sway. An honest TURK, who should
come from his seraglio, where every one trembles be∣fore
him, would be surprised to see SYLVIA in her
drawing-room, adored by all the beaus and pretty fel∣lows
about town, and he would certainly take her for
some, mighty and despotic queen, surrounded by her
guard of obsequious slaves and eunuchs.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, it may be urged with better
reason, that this sovereignty of the male is a real
usurpation, and destroys that nearness of rank, not to
say equality, which nature has established between the
sexes. We are, by nature, their lovers, their▪ friends,
their patrons: Would we willingly change such en∣dearing
appellations, for the barbarous titles of master
and tyrant?</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="295"/>
IN what capacity shall we gain by this inhuman
proceeding? As lovers, or as husbands? The <HI>lover,</HI>
is totally annihilated; and courtship, the most agree∣able
scene in human life, can no longer have place,
where women have not the free disposal of themselves,
but are bought and sold, like the meanest animals.
The <HI>husband</HI> is as little a gainer, having found the
admirable secret of extinguishing every part of love,
except its jealousy. There is no rose without its
thorn; but he must be a foolish wretch indeed, who
throws away the rose and preserves only the thorn.</P>
<P>WOULD not willingly insist upon it as an advan∣tage
in our EUROPEAN customs, what was observed
by MEHEMET EFFENDI the last TURKISH ambassador
in FRANCE. <HI>We</HI> TURKS, <HI>says he, are great simpletons
in comparison of the christians. We are at the expence
and trouble of keeping a seraglio, each in his own house:
But you ease yourselves of this h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rden, and have your se∣raglio
in your friends houses.</HI> The known virtue of our
BRITISH ladies frees them sufficiently from this im∣putation:
And the TURK himself, had he travelled
among us, must have owned, that our free commerce
with the fair sex, more than any other invention,
embellishes, enlivens, and polishes society.</P>
<P>BUT the ASIATIC manners are as desructive to
friendship as to love. Jealousy excludes men from
<PB N="303" REF="296"/>
all intimacies and familiarities with each other. No
man dares bring his friend to his house or table, lest
he bring a lover to his numerous wives. Hence all
over the east, each family is as separate from another,
as if they were so many distinct kingdoms. No won∣der
then, that SOLOMON, living like an eastern prince,
with his seven hundred wives, and three hundred con∣cubines,
without one friend, could write so patheti∣cally
concerning the vanity of the world. Had he
tried the secret of one wife or mistress, a few friends,
and a great many companions, he might have found
life somewhat more agreeable. Destroy love and
friendship; what remains in the world worth accept∣ing?</P>
<P>THE bad education of children, especially children
of condition, is another unavoidable consequence of
these institutions. Those, who pass all the early part
of life among slaves, are only qualified to be, them∣selves,
slaves and tyrants; and in every future inter∣course,
either with their inferiors or superiors, are apt
to forget the natural equality of mankind. What
attention, too, can it be supposed a parent, whose se∣raglio
affords him fifty sons, will give to the instilling
principles of morality or science into a progeny, with
whom he himself is scarcely acquainted, and whom
he loves with so divided an affection? Barbarism,
therefore, appears, from reason as well as experience,
to be the inseparable concomitant of polygamy.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="297"/>
To render polygamy more odious, I need not re∣count
the frightful effects of jealousy, and the con∣straint
in which it holds the fair-sex all over the east.
In those countries men are not allowed to have any
commerce with the females, not even physicians,
when sickness may be supposed to have extinguished
all wanton passions in the bosoms of the fair, and, at
the same time, has rendered them unfit objects of
desire. TOURNEFORT tells us, That when he was
brought into the <HI>grand signior</HI>'s feraglio as a physician,
he was not a little surprized, in looking along a gal∣lery,
to see a great number of naked arms, standing
out from the sides of the room. He could not ima∣gine
what this could mean; till he was told, that
those arms belonged to bodies, which he must cure,
without knowing any more about them, than what
he could learn from the arms. He was not allowed
to ask a question of the patient, or even of her at∣tendants,
lest he might find it necessary to enquire
concerning circumstances, which the delicacy of the
seraglio allows not to be revealed. Hence the phy∣sicians
in the eastern countries pretend to know all
diseases from the pulse; as our quacks in EUROPE
undertake to cure a person merely from seeing his wa∣ter.
I suppose, had <HI>Monsieur</HI> TOURNEFORT been of
this latter kind, he would not, in CONSTANTINOPLE,
have been allowed by the jealous TURKS to be fur∣nished
with materials requisite for exercising his ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="298"/>
IN another country, where polygamy is also allowed,
they render their wives cripples, and make their feet
of no use to them, in order to consine them to their
own houses. But it will, perhaps, appear strange,
that in an EUROPEAN country, where polygamy is
not allowed, jealousy can yet be carried to such a
height, that 'tis indecent so much as to suppose, that
a woman of rank can have feet or legs. A SPA∣NIARD
is jealous of the very thoughts of those who
approach his wife; and, if possible, will prevent his
being dishonoured, even by the wantonness of ima∣gination.
Witness the following story, which we
have from very good authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs de la cour d'<HI>ESPAGNE</HI> par Madame d'<HI>AUNOY.</HI></NOTE>. When the mother
of the late king of SPAIN was on her road towards
MADRID, she passed thro' a little town in SPAIN, fa∣mous
for its manufactory of gloves and stockings.
The honest magistrates of the place thought they could
not better express their joy for the reception of their
new queen, than by presenting her with a sample of
those commodities, for which alone their town was
remarkable. The <HI>major-domo,</HI> who conducted the
queen, received the gloves very graciously: But when
the stockings were presented, he flung them away with
great indignation, and severely reprimanded the ma∣gistrates
for this egregious piece of indecency. <HI>Know,</HI>
says he, <HI>That a queen of</HI> SPAIN <HI>has no legs.</HI> The poor
young queen, who, at that time, understood the lan∣guage
<PB N="306" REF="299"/>
but very imperfectly, and had been often
frightened with stories of SPANISH jealousy, ima∣gined
that they were to cut off her legs. Upon
which she fell a crying, and begged them to conduct
her back to GERMANY; for that she never could en∣dure
that operation: And it was with some difficulty
they could appease her. PHILIP IV. is said never in
his life to have laughed heartily, but at the recital of
this story.</P>
<P>IF a SPANISH lady must not be supposed to have
legs, what must be supposed of a TURKISH lady?
She must not be supposed to have a being at all. Ac∣cordingly,
'tis esteemed a piece of rudeness and inde∣cency
at CONSTANTINOPLE, ever to make mention
of a man's wives before him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Marquis d'<HI>ARGENS</HI>▪</NOTE>. In EUROPE, 'tis
true, fine bred people make it also a rule never to
talk of their wives: But the reason is not founded on
our jealousy. I suppose it is because we should be apt,
were it not for this rule, to become troublesome to
company, by talking too much of them.</P>
<P>THE author of the PERSIAN letters has given a
different reason for this polite maxim. <HI>Men,</HI> says he,
<HI>never care to mention their wives in company, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they
should talk of them before people, who are better ac∣quainted
with them than themselves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="300"/>
HAVING rejected polygamy, and matched one man
with one woman, let us now consider what duration
we shall assign to their union, and whether we shall
admit of those voluntary divorces, which were in use
among the GREEKS and ROMANS. They who would
defend this practice, may employ the following rea∣sons.</P>
<P>How often does disgust and aversion arise after
marriage, from the most trivial accidents, or from an
incompatibility of humour; where time, instead of
curing the wounds proceeding from mutual injuries,
festers them every day the more, by new quarrels and
reproaches? Let us separate hearts, which are not
made for each other. Each of them may, perhaps,
find another, for which it is better fitted. At least,
nothing can be more cruel, than to preserve, by vio∣lence,
an union, which, at first, was made by mutual
love, and is now, in effect, dissolved by mutual
hatred.</P>
<P>BUT the liberty of divorces is not only a cure to
hatred and domestic quarrels: It is also an admirable
preservative against them, and the only secret for
keeping alive that love, which first united the mar∣ried
couple. The heart of man delights in liberty:
The very image of constraint is grievous to it: When
you would confine it by violence, to what would
otherwise have been its choice, the inclination im∣mediately
<PB N="308" REF="301"/>
changes, and desire is turned into aversion.
If the public interest will not allow us to enjoy in
polygamy that <HI>variety,</HI> which is so agreeable in love;
at least, deprive us not of that liberty, which is so
essentially requisite. In vain you tell me, that I had
my choice of the person, with whom I would conjoin
myself. I had my choice, 'tis true, of my prison;
but this is but a small comfort, since it must still be a
prison.</P>
<P>SUCH are the arguments, which may be urged in
favour of divorces: But there seem to be these three
unanswerable objections against them: <HI>First,</HI> What
must become of the children, upon the separation of
the parents? Must they be committed to the care of a
stepmother; and instead of the fond attention and
concern of a parent, feel all the indifference or hatred
of a stranger or an enemy? These inconveniences are
sufficiently felt, where nature has made the divorce by
the doom inevitable to all mortals: And shall we seek
to multiply these inconveniences, by multiplying di∣vorces,
and putting it in the power of parents, upon
every caprice, to render their posterity miserable?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IF it be true, on the one hand, that the
heart of man naturally delights in liberty, and hates
every thing to which it is confined; 'tis also true, on
the other hand, that the heart of man naturally sub∣mits
to necessity, and soon loses an inclination, when
<PB N="309" REF="302"/>
there appears an absolute impossibility of gratifying it. These
principles of human nature, you will say, are
contradictory: But what is man but a heap of con∣tradictions?
Tho' 'tis remarkable, that where prin∣ciples
are, after this manner, contrary in their ope∣ration,
they do not always destroy each other; but
the one or the other may predominate on any particu∣lar
occasion, according as circumstances are more or
less favourable to it. For instance, love is a restless
and impatient passion, full of caprices and variations;
arising in a moment from a feature, from an air, from
nothing, and suddenly extinguishing after the same
manner. Such a passion requires liberty above all
things; and therefore ELOISA had reason, when, in
order to preserve this passion, she refused to marry her
beloved ABELARD.</P>
<Q><L>How oft, when prest to marriage, have I said,</L>
<L>Curse on all laws but those which love has made:</L>
<L>Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,</L>
<L>Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.</L></Q>
<P>But <HI>friendship</HI> is a calm and sedate affection, conducted
by reason and cemented by habit; springing from
long acquaintance and mutual obligations; without
jealousies or fears, and without those feverish fits of
heat and cold, which cause such an agreeable torment
in the amorous passion. So sober an affection, there∣fore,
as friendship, rather thrives under constraint,
<PB N="310" REF="303"/>
and never rises to such a height, as when any strong
interest or necessity binds two persons together, and
gives them some common object of pursuit. Let us
consider then, whether love or friendship should most
predominate in marriage; and we shall soon deter∣mine
whether liberty or constraint be most favorable
to it. The happiest marriages, to be sure, are found
where love, by long acquaintance, is consolidated in∣to
friendship. Whoever dreams of raptures and ex∣tasies
beyond the honey-moon, is a fool. Even ro∣mances
themselves, with all their liberty of fiction,
are obliged to drop their lovers the very day of their
marriage, and find it easier to support the passion for
a dozen years under coldness, disdain and difficulties,
than a week under possession and security. We need
not, therefore, be afraid of drawing the marriage∣knot
the closest possible. The friendship between the
persons, where it is solid and sincere, will rather gain
by it: And where it is wavering and uncertain, this
is the best expedient for fixing it. How many fri∣volous
quarrels and disgusts are there, which people
of common prudence endeavour to forget, when they
lye under a necessity of passing their lives together;
but which would soon inflame into the most deadly
hatred, were they pursued to the utmost, under the
prospect of an easy separation?</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="304"/>
IN the <HI>third</HI> place, we must consider, that nothing
is more dangerous than to unite two persons so closely
in all their interests and concerns, as man and wife,
without rendering the union intire and total. The
least possibility of a separate interest must be the source
of endless quarrels and jealousies. What Dr. PARNEL
calls,
<Q>The little pilf'ring temper of a wife,</Q>
will be doubly ruinous; and the husband's selfishness,
being accompanied with more power, may be still
more dangerous.</P>
<P>SHOULD these reasons against voluntary divorces be
esteemed insufficient, I hope no body will pretend to
refuse the testimony of experience. At the time
when divorces were most frequent among the RO∣MANS,
marriages were most rare; and AUGUSTUS
was obliged, by penal laws, to force the men of
fashion into the married state: A circumstance which
is scarce to be found in any other age or nation.
The more ancient laws of ROME which prohibited
divorces, are extremely praised by DIONYSIUS HALY∣CARNASSAEUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2.</NOTE>. Wonderful was the harmony, says
the historian, which this inseparable union of inte∣rests
produced between married persons; while each
of them considered the inevitable necessity by which
<PB N="312" REF="305"/>
they were linked together, and abandoned all pro∣spect
of any other choice or establishment.</P>
<P>THE exclusion of polygamy and divorces suffi∣ciently
recommends our present EUROPEAN practice
with regard to marriage.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of SIMPLICITY and REFINEMENT in WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>FINE writing, according to Mr. ADDISON, con∣sists
of sentiments, which are natural, without
being obvious. There cannot be a juster, and more
concise definition of fine writing.</P>
<P>SENTIMENTS, which are merely natural, affect not
the mind with any pleasure, and seem not worthy of
our attention. The pleasantries of a waterman, the
observations of a peasant, the ribaldry of a porter or
hackney coachman; all these are natural, and disa∣greeable.
What an insipid comedy should we make
of the chit-chat of the tea-table, copied faithfully and
at full length? Nothing can please persons of taste,
but nature drawn with all her graces and ornaments,
<HI>la belle nature;</HI> or if we copy low life, the strokes
must be strong and remarkable, and must convey a
lively image to the mind. The absurd naivety of
<HI>Sancho Pancho</HI> is represented in such inimitable co∣lours
<PB N="314" REF="307"/>
by CERVANTES, that it entertains as much as
the picture of the most magnanimous hero or softest
lover.</P>
<P>THE case is the same with orators, philosophers,
critics, or any author who speaks in his own person,
without introducing other speakers or actors. If his
language be not elegant, his observations uncommon,
his sense strong and masculine, he will in vain boast
his nature and simplicity. He may be correct; but
he never will be agreeable. 'Tis the unhappiness of
such authors, that they are never blamed nor censured.
The good fortune of a book, and that of a man, are
not the same. The secret deceiving path of life,
which HORACE talks of, <HI>fallentis semita vitae,</HI> may
be the happiest lot of the one; but is the greatest
misfortune, which the other possibly can fall into.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, productions, which are merely
surprising, without being natural, can never give any
lasting entertainment to the mind. To draw chime∣ras
is not, properly speaking, to copy or imitate.
The justness of the representation is lost, and the
mind is displeased to find a picture, which bears no
resemblance to any original. Nor are such excessive
refinements more agreeable in the epistolary or philo∣sophic
stile, than in the epic or tragic. Too much
ornament is a fault in every kind of production. Un∣common
expressions, strong flashes of wit, pointed
<PB N="315" REF="308"/>
similies, and epigrammatic turns, especially when
they occur too frequently, are a disfigurement, rather
than any embellishment of discourse. As the eye, in
surveying a GOTHIC building, is distracted by the
multiplicity of ornaments, and loses the whole by its
minute attention to the parts; so the mind, in per∣using
a work overstocked with wit, is fatigued and
disgusted with the constant endeavour to shine and
surprize. This is the case where a writer over∣abounds
in wit, even tho' that wit, in itself, should be
just and agreeable. But it commonly happens to such
writers, that they seek for their favourite ornaments,
even where the subject affords them not; and by that
means, have twenty insipid conceits for one thought
which is really beautiful.</P>
<P>THERE is no subject in critical learning more co∣pious
than this of the just mixture of simplicity and
refinement in writing; and therefore, not to wander
in too large a field, I shall confine myself to a few
general observations on that head.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I observe, <HI>That tho' excesses of both kinds are
to be avoided, and tho' a proper medium ought to be
studied in all productions; yet this medium lies not in a
point, but admits of a very considerable latitude.</HI> Con∣sider
the wide distance, in this respect, between Mr.
POPE and LUCRETIUS. These seem to lie in the
two greatest extremes of refinement and simplicity, in
<PB N="316" REF="309"/>
which a poet can indulge himself, without being
guilty of any blameable excess. All this interval may
be filled with poets, who may differ from each other,
but may be equally admirable, each in his peculiar
stile and manner. CORNEILLE and CONGREVE,
who carry their wit and refinement somewhat farther
than Mr. POPE (if poets of so different a kind can be
compared together) and SOPHOCLES and TERENCE,
who are more simple than LUCRETIUS, seem to
have gone out of that medium, in which the most
perfect productions are found, and to be guilty of
some excess in these opposite characters. Of all the
great poets, VIRGIL and RACINE, in my opinion,
lie nearest the center, and are the farthest removed
from both the extremities.</P>
<P>MY <HI>second</HI> observation on this head is, <HI>That it is
very difficult, if not impossible, to explain by words,
where the just medium between the excesses of simplicity
and refinement lies, or to give any rule, by which we
can know precisely the bounds between the fault and the
beauty.</HI> A critic may not only discourse very judici∣ously
on this head, without instructing his readers, but
even without understanding the matter perfectly him∣self.
There is not a finer piece of criticism than <HI>the
dissertation on pastorals</HI> by FONTENELLE; where, by
a number of reflections and philosophical reasonings,
he endeavours to fix the just medium, which is suitable
to that species of writing. But let any one read the
<PB N="317" REF="310"/>
pastorals of that author, and he will be convinced
that this judicious critic, notwithstanding his fine
reasonings, had a false taste, and fixed the point of
perfection much nearer the extreme of refinement
than pastoral poetry will admit of. The sentiments
of his shepherds are better suited to the toilettes of
PARIS, than to the forests of ARCADIA. But this it
is impossible to discover from his critical reasonings.
He blames all excessive painting and ornament as
much as VIRGIL could have done, had <HI>he</HI> wrote a
differtation on that species of poetry. However dif∣ferent
the tastes of men may be, their general dis∣courses
on these subjects are commonly the same. No
criticism can be very instructive, which descends not
to particulars, and is not full of examples and illustra∣tions.
'Tis allowed on all hands, that beauty, as
well as virtue, lies always in a medium; but where
this medium is placed, is the great question, and can
never be sufficiently explained by general reasonings.</P>
<P><HI>I SHALL deliver it as a</HI> third <HI>observation on this
subject,</HI> That we ought to be more on our guard against
the excess of refinement than that of simplicity; and that
beacause the former excess is both less <HI>beautiful,</HI> and
more <HI>dangerous</HI> than the latter.</P>
<P>'TIS a certain rule, that wit and passion are intirely
inconsistent. When the affections are moved, there is
no place for the imagination. The mind of man be∣ing
<PB N="318" REF="311"/>
naturally limited, 'tis impossible, that all its fa∣culties
can operate at once: And the more any one
predominates, the less room is there for the others to
exert their vigour. For this reason, a greater degree
of simplicity is required in all compositions, where
men, and actions, and passions are painted, than in
such as consist of reflections and observations. And as
the former species of writing is the more engaging
and beautiful, one may safely, upon this account, give
the preference to the extreme of simplicity above that
of refinement.</P>
<P>WE may also observe, that those compositions,
which we read the oftenest, and which every man of
taste has got by heart, have the recommendation of
simplicity, and have nothing surprizing in the thought,
when divested of that elegance of expression, and
harmony of numbers, with which it is cloathed. If
the merit of the composition lies in a point of wit;
it may strike at first; but the mind anticipates the
thought in the second perusal, and is no longer affect∣ed
by it. When I read an epigram of MARTIAL,
the first line recalls the whole; and I have no pleasure
in repeating to myself what I know already. But
each line, each word in CATULLUS, has its merit;
and I am never tired with the perusal of him. 'Tis
sufficient to run over COWLEY once: But PARNEL,
after the fiftieth reading, is as fresh as at the firs.
Besides, 'tis with books, as with women, where a
<PB N="319" REF="312"/>
certain plainness of manner and of dress is more en∣gaging
than that glare of paint and airs and apparel,
which may dazzle the eye, but reaches not the affec∣tions.
TERENCE is a modest and bashful beauty, to
whom we grant every thing, because he assumes no∣thing,
and whose purity and nature make a durable,
tho' not a violent impression on us.</P>
<P>BUT refinement, as it is the less <HI>beautiful,</HI> so is it
the more <HI>dangerous</HI> extreme, and what we are the apt∣est
to fall into. Simplicity passes for dulness, when it
is not accompanied with great elegance and propriety.
On the contrary, there is something surprizing in a
blaze of wit and conceit. Ordinary readers are
mightily struck with it, and falsely imagine it to be
the most difficult, as well as most excellent way of
writing. SENECA abounds with agreeable faults, says
QUINTILIAN, <HI>abundat dulcibus vitiis;</HI> and for that
reason is the more dangerous, and the more apt to
pervert the taste of the young and inconsiderate.</P>
<P>I SHALL add, that the excess of refinement is now
more to be guarded against than ever; because<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tis
the extreme, which men are the most apt to fall into,
after learning has made great progress, and after
eminent writers have appeared in every species of
composition. The endeavour to please by novelty
leads men wide of simplicity and nature, and fills
their writings with affectation and conceit. It was
<PB N="320" REF="313"/>
thus the ASIATIC eloquence degenerated so much
from the ATTIC. It was thus the age of CLAUDIUS
and NERO became so much inferior to that of AU∣GUSTUS
in taste and genius: And perhaps there are,
at present, some symptoms of a like degeneracy of
taste, in FRANCE as well as in ENGLAND.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of NATIONAL CHARACTERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE vulgar are very apt to carry all <HI>national
characters</HI> to extremes; and having once esta∣blished
it as a principle, that any people are knavish,
or cowardly, or ignorant, they will admit of no excep∣tion,
but comprehend every individual under the
same character. Men of sense condemn these undis∣tinguishing
judgments: Tho' at the same time, they
allow, that each nation has a peculiar set of manners,
and that some particular qualities are more frequently
to be met with among one people than among their
neighbours. The common people in SWISSERLAND
have surely more probity than those of the same rank
in IRELAND; and every prudent man will, from that
circumstance alone, make a difference in the trust
which he reposes in each. We have reason to expect
greater wit and gaiety in a FRENCHMAN than in a
SPANIARD; tho' CERVANTES was born in SPAIN.
An ENGLISHMAN will naturally be supposed to have
<PB N="322" REF="315"/>
more knowledge than a DANE; tho' TYCHO BRAHE
was a native of DENMARK.</P>
<P>DIFFERENT reasons are assigned for these <HI>national
characters;</HI> while some account for them from <HI>moral</HI>
and others from <HI>physical</HI> causes. By <HI>moral</HI> causes, I
mean all circumstances, which are fitted to work on
the mind as motives or reasons, and which render a
peculiar set of manners habitual to us. Of this kind
are, the nature of the government, the revolutions
of public affairs, the plenty or penury in which the
people live, the situation of the nation with regard
to its neighbours, and such like circumstances. By
<HI>physical</HI> causes, I mean those qualities of the air and
climate, which are supposed to work insensibly on the
temper, by altering the tone and habit of the body,
and giving a particular complexion, which tho' re∣flection
and reason may sometimes overcome, yet will
it prevail among the generality of mankind, and have
an influence on their manners.</P>
<P>THAT the character of a nation will very much de∣pend
on <HI>moral</HI> causes, must be evident to the most su∣perficial
observer; since a nation is nothing but a col∣lection
of individuals, and the manners of individuals
are frequently determined by these causes. As po∣verty
and hard labour debase the minds of the com∣mon
people, and render them unfit for any science
and ingenious profession; so where any government
<PB N="323" REF="316"/>
becomes very oppressive to all its subjects, it must
have a proportional effect on their temper and ge∣nius,
and must banish all the liberal arts from among
them. Instances of this nature are very frequent in
the world.</P>
<P>THE same principle of moral causes fixes the cha∣racter
of different professions, and alters even that
disposition, which the particular members receive
from the hand of nature. A <HI>soldier</HI> and a <HI>priest</HI> are
different characters, in all nations, and all ages; and
this difference is founded on circumstances, whose
operation is eternal and unalterable.</P>
<P>THE uncertainty of their life makes soldiers lavish
and generous as well as brave: Their idleness, as
well as the large societies, which they form in camps
or garrisons, inclines them to pleasure and gallantry:
By their frequent change of company, they acquire
good breeding and an openness of behaviour: Being
employed only against a public and an open enemy,
they become candid, honest, and undesigning: And
as they use more the labour of the body than that of
the mind, they are commonly thoughtless and igno∣rant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'TIS a saying of MENANDER, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. MEN. apud STORAEU<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. '<HI>Tis not in the power even of God to make a polite soldier.</HI> The contrary observation with regard to the manners of soldiers takes place in cur days. This seems to me a presumption, that the ancients owed all their refinement and civility to books and study; for which, indeed, a soldier's life is not so well calcu∣lated. Company and the world is their sphere. And if there be any politeness to be learned from company, they will certainly have a considerable share of it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="317"/>
'TIS a trite, but not altogether a false maxim, that
<HI>priests of all religions are the same;</HI> and tho' the cha∣racter
of the profession will not, in every instance,
prevail over the personal character, yet it is sure al∣ways
to predominate with the greater number. For
as chymists observe, that spirits, when raised to a
certain height, are all the same, from whatever mate∣rials
they be extracted; so these men, being elevated
above humanity, acquire a uniform character, which
is intirely their own, and which, in my opinion, is,
generally speaking, not the most amiable that is to
be met with in human society. It is, in most points,
opposite to that of a soldier; as is the way of life,
from which it is derived<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Tho' all mankind have a strong propensity to religion at certain times and in certain dispositions; yet are there few or none, who have it to that degree, and with that constancy, which is requisite to support the character of this profession. It must, therefore, happen, that clergymen, being drawn from the common mass of mankind, as people are to other employ∣ments, by the views of profit, the greatest part, tho' no atheists or free-thinkers, will find it necessary, on particular occasions, to feign more devotion than they are, at that time, possessed of, and to maintain the appearance of fervor and seriousness, even when jaded with the exercises of their religion, or when they have their minds engaged in the common occupations of life. They must not, like the rest of the world, give scope to their natural movements and sentiments: They must set a guard over their looks and words and actions: And in order to support the veneration paid them by the ignorant vulgar, they must not only keep a remarkable reserve, but must promote the spirit of superstition, by a continued grimace and hypocrisy. This dissimulation often destroys the candour and ingenuity of their temper, and makes an irreparable breach in their character.</P>
<P>If by chance any of them be possessed of a temper more sus∣ceptible of devotion than usual, so that he has but little occasion for hypocrisy to support the character of his profession; 'tis so natural for him to over-rate this advantage, and to think that it atones for every violation of morality, that frequently he is not more virtuous than the hypocrite. And tho' few dare openly avow those exploded opinions, <HI>that every thing is lawful to the saints, and that they alone have property in their goods;</HI> yet we may observe, that these principles lurk in every bosom, and represent a zeal for religious observances as so great a merit, that it may compensate for many vices and enormities. This observation is so common, that all prudent men are on their guard, when they meet with any extraordinary appearance of religion; tho' at the same time, they confess, that there are many exceptions to this general rule, and that probity and superstition are not altogether incompatible.</P>
<P>Most men are ambitious; but the ambition of other men may commonly be satisfied, by excelling in their particular profession, and thereby promoting the interests of society. The ambition of the clergy can often be satisfied only by promoting ignorance and superstition and implicite faith and pious frauds. And hav∣ing got what ARCHIMEDES only wanted, (<HI>viz,</HI> another world, on which he could fix his engines) no wonder they move this world at their pleasure.</P>
<P>Most men have an over-weaning conceit of themselves; but <HI>these</HI> have a peculiar temptation to that vice, who are regarded with such veneration, and are even deemed sacred, by the igno∣rant multitude.</P>
<P>Most men are apt to bear a particular regard for members of their own profession; but as a lawyer, or physician, or mer∣chant does, each of them, follow out his business apart, the in∣terests of these professions are not so closely united as the interests of clergymen of the same religion; where the whole body gains by the veneration, paid to their common tenets, and by the sup∣pression of antagonists.</P>
<P>Few men can bear contradiction with patience; but the clergy too often proceed even to a degree of fury on this article: Be∣cause all their credit and livelihood depend upon the belief, which their opinions meet with; and they alone pretend to a divine and supernatural authority, or have any colour for repre∣senting their antagonists as impious and prophane. The <HI>Odium Thcologicum,</HI> or Theological Hatred, is noted even to a proverb, and means that degree of rancour, which is the most furious and implacable.</P>
<P>Revenge is a very natural passion to mankind; but seems to reign with the greatest force in priests and women: Because be∣ing deprived of the immediate exertion of anger, in violence and combat, they are apt to fancy themselves despised on that account; and their pride supports their vindictive disposition.</P>
<P>Thus many of the vices of human nature are, by fixed moral causes, inflamed in that profession; and tho' several individuals escape the contagion, yet all wise governments will be on their guard against the attempts of a society, who will for ever com∣bine into one faction, and while it acts as a society, will for ever be actuated by ambition, pride, revenge, and a persecuting spirit.</P>
<P>The temper of religion is grave and serious; and this is the character required of priests, which confines them to strict rules of decency, and commonly prevents irregularity and intemperance amongst them. The gaiety, much less the excesses of pleasure, is not permitted in that body; and this virtue is, perhaps, the only one, which they owe to their profession. In religions, indeed, founded on speculative priniciples, and where public discourses make a part of religious service, it may also be supposed that the clergy will have a considerable share in the learning of the times; tho' 'tis certain that their taste and eloquence will al∣ways be better than their skill in reasoning and philosophy. But whoever possesses the other noble virtues of humanity, meekness, and moderation, as very many of them, no doubt, do, is be∣holden for them to nature or reflection, not to the genius of his calling.</P>
<P>'Twas no bad expedient in the ROMANS, for preventing the strong effect of the priestly character, to make it a law that no one should be received into the sacerdotal office, till he was past fifty years of age, DION. <HI>Hal.</HI> lib. 1. The living a layman till that age, 'tis presumed, would be able to fix the character.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="318"/>
As to <HI>physical causes,</HI> I am inclined to doubt alto∣gether
of their operation in this particular; nor do I
<PB N="326" REF="319"/>
think, that men owe any thing of their temper or
genius to the air, food, or climate. I confess, that
<PB N="327" REF="320"/>
the contrary opinion may justly, at first sight, seem
very probable; since we find, that these circumstances
<PB N="328" REF="321"/>
have an influence over every other animal, and that
even those creatures, which are fitted to live in all
climates, such as dogs, horses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do not attain the
same perfection in all. The courage of bull-dogs
and game-cocks seems peculiar to ENGLAND. FLAN∣DERS
is remarkable for large and heavy horses:
SPAIN for horses light, and of good mettle. And
any breed of these creatures, transported from one
country into another, will soon lose the qualities,
which they derived from their native climate. It
may be asked, why not the same with men<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">CAESAR (<HI>de Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</HI> GALLICO, lib. 1.) says that the GAL∣LIC horses were very good; the GERMAN very bad. We find in lib. 7. that he was obliged to remount some GERMAN cavalry with GALLIC horses. At present, no part of EUROPE has so bad horses of all kinds as FRANCE: But GERMANY abounds with excellent war horses. This may beget a little suspicion, that even animals depend not on the climate; but on the differ∣ent breeds, and on the skill and care in rearing them. The north of ENGLAND abounds in the best horses of all kinds which are in the world. In the neighbouring counties, north side the TWEED, no good horses of any kind are to be met with. STRAEO, lib. 2. rejects, in a great measure, the in∣fluence of climate upon men. All is custom and education, says he. It is not from nature, that the ATHENIANS are learned, the LACEDEMONIANS ignorant, and the THEBA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S too, who are still nearer neighbours to the former. Even the difference of animals, he adds, depends not on climate.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="322"/>
THERE are few questions more curious than this,
or which will occur oftener in our inquiries concern∣ing
human affairs; and therefore it may be proper to
give it a serious examination.</P>
<P>THE human mind is of a very imitative nature;
nor is it possible for any set of men to converse often
together, without acquiring a similitude of manners,
and communicating to each other their vices as well
as virtues. The propensity to company and society
is strong in all rational creatures; and the same dispo∣sition,
which gives us this propensity, makes us enter
deeply into each other's sentiments, and causes like
passions and inclinations to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un, as it were by conta∣gion,
thro' the whole club or knot of companions.
Where a number of men are united into one political
body, the occasions of their intercourse must be so
frequent, for defence, commerce, and government,
that, together with the same speech or language, they
must acquire a resemblance in their manners, and
<PB N="330" REF="323"/>
have a common or national character, as well as a
personal one, peculiar to each individual. Now tho'
nature produces all kinds of temper and understand∣ing
in great abundance, it follows not that she always
produces them in like proportions, and that in every
society the ingredients of industry and indolence, va∣lour
and cowardice, humanity and brutality, wisdom
and folly, will be mixed after the same manner. In
the infancy of society, if any of these dispositions be
found in greater abundance than the rest, it will natu∣rally
prevail in the composition, and give a tincture to
the national character. Or should it be asserted, that
no species of temper can reasonably be presumed to
predominate, even in those contracted societies, and
that the same proportions will always be preserved in
the mixture; yet surely the persons in credit and au∣thority,
being a more contracted body, cannot always
be presumed to be of the same character; and their
influence on the manners of the people, must, at all
times, be very considerable. If on the first establish∣ment
of a republic, a BRUTUS should be placed in au∣thority,
and be transported with such an enthusiasm
for liberty and public good, as to overlook all the ties
of nature, as well as private interest, such an illus∣trious
example will naturally have an effect on the
whole society, and kindle the same passion in every
bosom. Whatever it be that forms the manners of
one generation, the next must imbibe a deeper tinc∣ture
of the same dye; men being more susceptible of
<PB N="331" REF="324"/>
all impressions during infancy, and retaining these
impressions as long as they remain in the world. I
assert, then, that all national characters, where they
depend not on fixed <HI>moral</HI> causes, proceed from such
accidents as these, and that physical causes have no dis∣cernible
operation on the human mind.</P>
<P>IF we run over the whole globe, or revolve all the
annals of history, we shall discover every where signs
of this sympathy or contagion of manners, none of
the influence of air or climate.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> We may observe, that where a very exten∣sive
government has been established for many cen∣turies,
it spreads a national character over the whole
empire, and communicates to every part a similitude
of manners. Thus the CHINESE have the greatest
uniformity of character imaginable; tho' the air and
climate, in different parts of those vast dominions,
admit of very considerable variations.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> In small governments, which are conti∣guous,
the people have notwithstanding a different
character, and are often as distinguishable in their
manners as the most distant nations. ATHENS and
THEBES were but a short day's journey from each
other; tho' the ATHENIANS were as remarkable for
ingenuity, politeness, and gaiety, as the THEBANS
for dulness, rusticity, and a phlegmatic temper.
<PB N="332" REF="325"/>
PLUTARCH, discoursing of the effects of air on the
minds of men, observes, that the inhabitants of the
PIRAEUM possessed very different tempers from those
of the higher town of ATHENS, which was distant
about four miles from the former: But I believe no
one attributes the difference of manners, in WAPPING
and St. JAMES's, to a difference of air or climate.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The same national character commonly
follows the authority of government to a precise
boundary; and upon crossing a river or passing a
mountain, one finds a new set of manners, with a
new government. The LANGUEDOCIANS and GAS∣CONS
are the gayest people of all FRANCE; but
whenever you pass the PYRENEES, you are among
SPANIARDS. Is it conceivable, that the qualities of
the air should change so exactly with the limits of an
empire, which depend so much on the accidents of
battles, negociations, and marriages?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> Where any set of men, scattered over
distant nations, have a close society or communi∣cation
together, they acquire a similitude of manners,
and have but little in common with the nations
amongst whom they live. Thus the JEWS in EU∣ROPE,
and the ARMENIANS in the east, have a pe∣culiar
character; and the former are as much noted
<PB N="333" REF="326"/>
for fraud, as the latter for probity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A small sect or society amidst a greater are commonly most regular in their morals; because they are more remarked, and the faults of individuals draw dishonour on the whole. The only exception to this rule is, when the superstition and preju∣dices of the large society are so strong as to throw an infamy on the smaller society, independent of their morals. For in that case, having no character either to save or gain, they become careless of their behaviour, except among themselves.</NOTE>. The <HI>Jesuites,</HI>
in all <HI>Roman-catholic</HI> countries, are also observed to
have a character peculiar to themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> Where any accident, as a difference of
language or religion, keeps two nations, inhabiting
the same country, from mixing with each other, they
will preserve, during several centuries, a distinct and even
opposite set of manners. The integrity, gravity, and
bravery of the TURKS, form an exact contrast to the
deceit, levity, and cowardice of the modern GREEKS.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> The same set of manners will follow a na∣tion,
and adhere to them over the whole globe, as
well as the same laws and language. The SPANISH,
ENGLISH, FRENCH and DUTCH colonies are all dis∣tinguishable
even between the tropics.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly.</HI> The manners of a people change very
considerably from one age to another; either by great
alterations in their government, by the mixtures of
new people, or by that inconstancy, to which all hu∣man
<PB N="334" REF="327"/>
affairs are subject. The ingenuity and industry
of the ancient GREEKS have nothing in common
with the stupidity and indolence of the present inha∣bitants
of those regions. Candour, bravery, and
love of liberty, formed the character of the ancient
ROMANS; as subtilty, cowardice, and a slavish dispo∣sition
do that of the modern. The old SPANIARDS
were restless, turbulent, and so addicted to war, that
many of them killed themselves, when deprived of
their arms by the ROMANS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TIT. LIVII, Lib. 34. Cap. 17.</NOTE>. One would find an equal
difficulty, at present, (at least one would have found
it fifty years ago) to rouze up the modern SPANIARDS
to arms. The BATAVIANS were all soldiers of for∣tune,
and hired themselves into the ROMAN armies.
Their posterity make use of foreigners for the same
purpose that the ROMANS did their ancestors. Tho'
some strokes of the FRENCH character be the same
with that, which CAESAR has ascribed to the GAULS;
yet what comparison between the civility, humanity,
and knowledge of the modern inhabitants of that
country, and the ignorance, barbarity, and grossness
of the ancient? Not to insist upon the great difference
betwixt the present possessors of BRITAIN, and those
before the ROMAN conquest; we may observe, that
our ancestors, a few centuries ago, were sunk into
the most abject superstition, last century they were
<PB N="335" REF="328"/>
inflamed with the most furious enthusiasm, and are
now settled into the most cool indifference with re∣gard
to religious matters, that is to be found in any
nation of the world.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly.</HI> Where several neighbouring nations have
a very close communication together, either by po∣licy,
commerce, or travelling, they acquire a simi∣litude
of manners, proportioned to the communica∣tion.
Thus all the FRANKS appear to have a uni∣form
character to the eastern nations. The differen∣ces
among them are like the particular accents of dif∣ferent
provinces, which are not distinguishable, ex∣cept
by an ear accustomed to them, and which com∣monly
escape a foreigner.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly.</HI> We may often remark a wonderful mix∣ture
of manners and characters in the same nation,
speaking the same language, and subject to the same
government: And in this particular, the ENGLISH
are the most remarkable of any people, that ever were
in the world. Nor is this to be ascribed to the mu∣tability
and uncertainty of their climate, or to any
other <HI>physical</HI> causes; since all these causes take place
in their neighbouring kingdom of SCOTLAND, with∣out
having the same effect. Where the government
of a nation is altogether republican, it is apt to beget
a particular set of manners. Where it is altogether
monarchical, it is more apt to have the same effect;
the imitation of superiors spreading the national
<PB N="336" REF="329"/>
manners faster among the people. If the governing
part of a state consists altogether of merchants, such
as HOLLAND, their uniform way of life will fix their
character. If it consists chiefly of nobles and landed
gentry, like GERMANY, FRANCE, and SPAIN, the
same effect follows. The genius of a particular sect
or religion is also apt to mould the manners of a peo∣ple.
But the ENGLISH government is a mixture of
monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. The people
in authority are composed of gentry and merchants.
All sects of religion are to be found among them.
And the great liberty and independency, which they
enjoy, allows every one to display the manners pe∣culiar
to him. Hence the ENGLISH, of any people
in the universe, have the least of a national character;
unless this very singularity may stand for such.</P>
<P>IF the characters of men depended on the air and
climate, the degrees of heat and cold should naturally
be expected to have a mighty influence; since no∣thing
has a greater effect on all plants and irrational
animals. And indeed there is some reason to think,
that all the nations, which live beyond the polar cir∣cles
or between the tropics, are inferior to the rest of
the species, and are utterly incapable of all the higher
attainments of the human mind. The poverty and
misery of the northern inhabitants of the globe, and
the indolence of the southern from their few neces∣sities,
may, perhaps, account for this remarkable dif∣ference,
<PB N="337" REF="330"/>
without having recourse to <HI>physical</HI> causes.
This however is certain, that the characters of nations
are very promiscuous in the temperate climates, and
that almost all the general observations, which have
been formed of the more southern or more northern
nations in these climates, are found to be uncertain
and fallacious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am apt to suspect the negroes, and in general all the other species of men (for there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites. There never was a civilized nation of any other complexion than white, nor even any indi∣vidual eminent either in action or speculation. No ingenious manufactures amongst them, no arts, no sciences. On the other hand, the most rude and barbarous of the whites, such as the ancient GERMANS, the present TARTARS, have still some∣thing eminent about them, in their valour, form of government, or some other particular. Such a uniform and constant differ∣ence could not happen, in so many countries and ages, if nature had not made an original distinction betwixt these breeds of men. Not to mention our colonies, there are NEGROE slaves dispersed all over EUROPE, of which none ever discovered any symptoms of ingenuity; tho' low people, without education, will start up amongst us, and distinguish themselves in every pro∣fession. In JAMAICA indeed they talk of one negroe as a man of parts and learning; but 'tis likely he is admired for very slender accomplishments, like a parrot, who speaks a few words plainly.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHALL we say, that the neighbourhood of the sun
inflames the imagination of men, and gives it a pe∣culiar
spirit and vivacity. The FRENCH, GREEKS,
<PB N="338" REF="331"/>
EGYPTIANS and PERSIANS are remarkable for gai∣ety.
The SPANIARDS, TURKS and CHINESE are
noted for gravity and a serious behaviour, without any
such difference of climate, as to produce this difference
of temper.</P>
<P>THE GREEKS and ROMANS, who called all other
nations barbarians, confined genius and a fine under∣standing
to the more southern climates, and pronoun∣ced
the northern nations incapable of all knowledge
and civility. But BRITAIN has produced as great
men, either for action or learning, as GREECE or
ITALY has to boast of.</P>
<P>'TIS pretended, that the sentiments of men be∣come
more delicate as the country approaches nearer
the sun; and that the taste of beauty and elegance re∣ceives
proportionable improvements in every latitude;
as we may particularly observe of the languages, of
which the more southern are smooth and melodious,
the northern harsh and untuneable. But this observ∣ation
holds not universally. The ARABIC is un∣couth
and disagreeable: The MUSCOVITE soft and
musical. Energy, strengh, and sometimes harshness
form the character of the LATIN tongue: The ITA∣LIAN
is the most liquid, smooth, and effeminate lan∣guage,
which can possibly be imagined. Every lan∣guage
will depend somewhat on the manners of the
people; but much more on that original stock of
<PB N="339" REF="332"/>
words and sounds, which they received from their an∣cestors,
and which remain unchangeable, even while
their manners admit of the greatest alterations. Who
can doubt, but the ENGLISH are at present a much
more polite and knowing people than the GREEKS
were for several ages after the siege of TROY? Yet
there is no comparison between the language of MIL∣TON
and that of HOMER. Nay, the greater are the
alterations and improvements, which happen in the
manners of a people, the less can be expected in their
language. A few great and resined geniuses will
communicate their taste and knowledge to a whole
people, and produce the greatest improvements:
But they fix the tongue by their writings, and pre∣vent,
in some degree, its farther changes.</P>
<P>LORD BACON has observed, that the inhabitants of
the south are, in general, more ingenious than those
of the north; but that, where the native of a cold
climate has genius, he rises to a higher pitch than can
be reached by the southern wits. This observation a
late writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Berkeley: Minute philosopher.</NOTE> confirms, by comparing the southern
wits to cucumbers, which are commonly all good of
their kind; but at best are an insipid fruit: While
the northern geniuses are like melons, of which not
one in fifty is good; but when it is good, it has an
exquisite relish, I believe this remark may be allow∣ed
just, when confined to the EUROPEAN nations, and
<PB N="340" REF="333"/>
to the present age, or rather to the preceding one:
But then I think it may be accounted for from mo∣ral
causes. All the sciences and liberal arts have been
imported to us from the south; and 'tis easy to ima∣gine,
that, in the first ardor of application, when ex∣cited
by emulation and by glory, the few, who were
addicted to them, would carry them to the greatest
height, and stretch every nerve, and every faculty, to
reach the pinnacle of perfection. Such illustrious
examples spread knowledge every where, and begot
an universal esteem for the sciences: After which,
'tis no wonder, that industry relaxes; while men
meet not with suitable encouragement, nor arrive at
such distinction by their attainments. The universal
diffusion of learning among a people, and the intire
banishment of gross ignorauce and rusticity, is, there∣fore,
seldom attended with any remarkable perfection
in particular persons. It seems to be taken for grant∣ed
in the dialogue <HI>de Oratoribus,</HI> that knowledge
was much more common in VESPASIAN'S age than in
that of CICERO or AUGUSTUS. QUINCTILIAN
also complains of the profanation of learning, by its
becoming too vulgar. “Formerly, says JUVENAL,
science was confined to GREECE and ITALY. Now
the whole world emulate ATHENS and ROME.
Eloquent GAUL has taught BRITAIN, knowing in
the laws. Even THULE entertains thoughts of
<PB N="341" REF="334"/>
hiring rhetoricians for its in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ruction<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>“Sed Cantaber unde</L>

<L>GALLIA causidicos docuit facunda BRITANNOS:</L>
<L>De conducendo loquitur jam rhetore THULE.” Satyr. 15.</L></Q></NOTE>.” This
state of learning is remarkable; because JUVENAL is
himself the last of the ROMAN writers, who possessed
any degree of genius. Those, who succeeded, are
valued for nothing but the matters of fact, of which
they give us information. I hope the late conversion
of MUSCOVY to the study of the sciences will not
prove a like prognostic to the present period of learn∣ing.</P>
<P>CARDINAL BENTIVOGLIO gives the preference to
the northern nations above the southern with regard
to candour and sincerity; and mentions, on the one
hand, the SPANIARDS and ITALIANS, and on the
other, the FLEMISH and GERMANS. But I am apt
to think, that this has happened by accident. The
ancient ROMANS seem to have been a candid sincere
people as are the modern TURKS. But if we must
needs suppose, that this event has arisen from fixed
causes, we may only conclude from it, that all ex∣tremes
are apt to concur, and are commonly attended
with the same consequences. Treachery is the usual
concomitant of ignorance and barbarism; and if civi∣lized
<PB N="342" REF="335"/>
nations ever embrace subtle and crooked poli∣tics,
'tis from an excess of resinement, which makes
them disdain the plain direct road to power and
glory.</P>
<P>MOST conquests have gone from north to south;
and hence it has been inferred, that the northern na∣tions
possess a superior degree of courage and fero∣city.
But it would have been juster to have said, that
most conquests are made by poverty and want upon
plenty and riches. The SARACENS, leaving the de∣serts
of ARABIA, carried their conquests northwards
upon all the fertile provinces of the ROMAN empire;
and met the TURKS half way, who were coming
southwards from the deserts of TARTARY.</P>
<P>AN eminent writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir WILLIA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> TEMPLE'S account of the Netherlands.</NOTE> has remarked, that all cou∣ragious
animals are also carnivorous, and that greater
courage is to be expected in a people, such as the
ENGLISH, whose food is strong and hearty, than in
the half-starved commonalty of other countries. But
the SWEDE<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, notwithstanding their disadvantages in
this particular, are not inferior, in martial courage,
to any nation that ever was in the world.</P>
<P>IN general, we may observe, that courage, of all
national qualities, is the most precarious; because it
<PB N="343" REF="336"/>
is exerted only at intervals, and by a few in every
nation; whereas industry, knowledge, civility, may
be of constant and universal use, and for several ages,
may become habitual to the whole people. If cou∣rage
be preserved, it must be by discipline, example,
and opinion. The tenth legion of CAESAR, and the
regiment of PICARDY in FRANCE were formed pro∣miscuously
from among the citizens; but having
once entertained a notion, that they were the best
troops in the service, this very opinion really made
them such.</P>
<P>AS a proof how much courage depends on opinion,
we may observe, that of the two chief tribes of the
GREEKS, the DORIANS, and IONIANS, the former
were always esteemed, and always appeared more
brave and manly than the latter; tho' the colonies of
both the tribes were interspersed and intermingled
thro' all the extent of GREEC<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the lesser ASIA, SI∣CILY,
ITALY, and the islands of the AEGEAN sea.
The ATHENIANS were the only IONIANS that ever
had any reputation for valour or military atchieve∣ments;
tho' even these were esteemed inferior to the
LACEDEMONIANS, the bravest of the DORIANS.</P>
<P>THE only observation, with regard to the differences
of men in different climates, on which we can rest
any weight, is the vulgar one, that people in the
northern regions have a greater inclination to strong
<PB N="344" REF="337"/>
liquors, and those in the southern to love and wo∣men.
One can assign a very probable <HI>physical</HI> cause
for this difference. Wine and distilled spirits warm
the frozen blood in the colder climates, and fortify
men against the injuries of the weather: As the ge∣nial
heat of the fun in the countries exposed to his
beams, inflames the blood, and exalts the passion be∣twixt
the sexes.</P>
<P>PERHAPS too, the matter may be accounted for
by <HI>moral</HI> causes. All strong liquors are rarer in the
north, and consequently are more coveted. DIO∣DORUS
SICU<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>US<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.</HI> 5. The same author ascribes taciturnity to that peo∣ple; a new proof that national characters may alter very much. Taciturnity, as a national character, implies unsociableness. ARISTOTEE in his Politics, book 2. chap. 9. fays that the GAULS are the only warlike nation, who are negligent of women.</NOTE> tells us, that the GAULS, in
his time, were great drunkards, and much addicted
to wine; chiefly, I suppose, from its rarity and no∣velty.
On the other hand, the heat in the southern
climates, obliging men and women to go half naked,
thereby renders their frequent commerce more dan∣gerous,
and inflames their mutual passion. This
makes parents and husbands more jealous and reserv∣ed;
which still farther inflames the passion. Not to
mention, that as women ripen sooner in the southern
<PB N="345" REF="338"/>
regions, 'tis necessary to observe greater jealousy and
care in their education; it being evident, that a girl
of twelve cannot possess equal discretion to govern this
passion, with one, who feels not its violence till she
be seventeen or eighteen.</P>
<P>PERHAPS too, the fact is false, that nature has, ei∣ther
from moral or physical causes, distributed these
different inclinations to the different climates. The
ancient GREEKS, tho' born in a warm climate, seem
to have been much addicted to the bottle; nor were
their parties of pleasure any thing but matches of
drinking among the men, who passed their time alto∣gether
apart from the fair sex. Yet when ALEXAN∣DER
led the GREEKS into PERSIA, a still more south∣ern
climate, they multiplied their debauches of this
kind, in imitation of the PERSIAN manners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BABYLON<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>I <HI>maxime in vinum,</HI> &amp; <HI>quae ebrietatem sequuntur, effusi sunt.</HI> QUINT. CUR. Lib. 5. Cap. 1.</NOTE>. So
honourable was the character of a drunkard among
the PERSIANS, that CYRUS the younger, soliciting
the sober LACEDEMONIANS for succour against his
brother ARTAXERXES, claims it chiefly on account
of his superior endowments, as more valorous, more
bountiful, and a better drinker<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PLUT. SYMP. Lib. 1. Quaest. 4.</NOTE>. DARIUS HYS∣TASPES
made it be inscribed on his tomb-stone,
among his other virtues and princely qualities, that
<PB N="346" REF="339"/>
no one could bear a greater quantity of liquor. You
may obtain any thing of the NEGROES by offering
them strong drink; and may easily prevail with them
to sell, not only their parents, but their wives and
mistresses, for a cask of brandy. IN FRANCE and
ITALY few drink pure wine, except in the greatest
heats of summer; and indeed, it is then almost as
necessary, in order to recruit the spirits, evaporated
by heat, as it is in SWEDEN, during the winter, in
order to warm the bodies congealed by the rigour of
the season.</P>
<P>IF jealousy be regarded as a proof of an amorous
disposition, no people were more jealous than the
MUSCOVITES, before their communication with EU∣ROPE
had somewhat altered their manners in this
particular.</P>
<P>BUT supposing the fact true, that nature, by phy∣sical
principles, has regularly distributed these two
passions, the one to the northern, the other to the
southern regions; we can only infer, that the climate
may affect the grosser and more bodily organs of our
frame; not that it can work upon those finer organs,
on which the operations of the mind and understand∣ing
depend. And this is agreeable to the analogy of
nature. The races of animals never degenerate when
carefully tended; and horses, in particular, always
show their blood in their shape, spirit, and swiftness:
<PB N="347" REF="340"/>
But a coxcomb may beget a philospher, as a man of
virtue may leave a worthless progeny.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this subject with observing, that
tho' the passion for liquor be much more brutal and
debasing than love, which, when properly managed,
is the source of all politeness and resinement; yet this
gives not so great an advantage to the southern cli∣mates,
as we may be apt, at first sight, to imagine.
When love goes beyond a certain pitch, it renders
men jealous, and cuts off the free intercourse between
the sexes, on which the politeness of a nation will al∣ways
much depend. And if we would subtilize and
refine upon this point, we might observe, that na∣tions,
in very temperate climates, stand the fairest
chance for all sorts of improvement; their blood not
being so inflamed as to render them jealous, and yet
being warm enough to make them set a due value on
the charms and endowments of the fair sex.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of TRAGEDY.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems an unaccountable pleasure, which the
spectators of a well wrote tragedy receive from
sorrow, terror, anxiety, and other passions, which are
in themselves disagreeable and uneasy. The more
they are touched and affected, the more are they de∣lighted
with the spectacle, and as soon as the uneasy
passions cease to operate, the piece is at an end. One
scene of full joy and contentment and security is the
utmost, that any composition of this kind can bear;
and it is sure always to be the concluding one. If in
the texture of the piece, there be interwoven any
scenes of satisfaction, they afford only faint gleams of
pleasure, which are thrown in by way of variety, and
in order to plunge the actors into deeper distress, by
means of that contrast and disappointment. The
whole art of the poet is employed, in rouzing and
supporting the compassion and indignation, the anxi∣ety
and resentment of his audience. They are plea∣sed
<PB N="350" REF="342"/>
in proportion as they are afflicted, and never are
so happy as when they employ tears, sobs, and crie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to give vent to their sorrow, and relieve their heart,
swoln with the tenderest sympathy and compassion.</P>
<P>THE few critics, who have had some tincture of
philosophy, have remarked this singular phaeno∣menon,
and have endeavoured to account for it.</P>
<P>L'ABBE DUBOS, in his reflections on poetry and
painting, asserts, that nothing is in general so disa∣greeable
to the mind as the languid, listless state of in∣dolence,
into which it falls upon the removal of
every passion and occupation. To get rid of this
painful situation, it seeks every amusement and pur∣suit;
business, gaming, shows, executions; whatever
will rouze the passions, and take its attention from
itself. No matter what the passion is: Let it be dis∣agreeable,
afflicting, melancholy, disordered; it is
still better than that insipid languor, which arises from
perfect tranquillity and repose.</P>
<P>IT is impossible not to admit this account, as being,
at least, in part satisfactory. You may observe, when
there are several tables of gaming, that all the company
run to those, where the deepest play is, even tho' they
find not there the best players. The view, or at
least, imagination of high passions, arising from great
loss or gain, affects the spectators by sympathy, gives
<PB N="351" REF="343"/>
them some touches of the same passions, and serves
them for a momentary entertainment. It makes the
time pass the easier with them, and is some relief to
that oppression, under which men commonly labour,
when left intirely to their own thoughts and medi∣tations.</P>
<P>WE find, that common lyars always magnify, in
their narrations, all kinds of danger, pain, distress,
sickness, deaths, murders, and cruelties; as well as
joy, beauty, mirth, and magnificence. It is an ab∣surd
secret, which they have for pleasing their com∣pany,
fixing their attention, and attaching them to
such marvellous relations, by the passions and emo∣tions,
which they excite.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, a difficulty of applying to the
present subject, in its full extent, this solution, how∣ever
ingenious and satisfactory it may appear. It is
certain, that the same object of distress, which pleases
in a tragedy, were it really set before us, would give
the most unfeigned uneasiness; tho' it be then the
most effectual cure of languor and indolence. Mon∣sieur
FONTENELLE seems to have been sensible of this
difficulty; and accordingly attempts another solution
of the phaenomenon; at least makes some addition to
the theory above mentioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reflexions sur la poetique, §. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>36.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="352" REF="344"/>
<P>“PLEASURE and pain,” says he, “which are two
sentiments so different in themselves, differ not so
much in their cause. From the instance of tick∣ling,
it appears, that the movement of pleasure
pushed a little too far, becomes pain; and that
the movement of pain, a little moderated, be∣comes
pleasure. Hence it proceeds, that there is
such a thing as a sorrow, soft and agreeable: It is a
pain weakened and diminished. The heart likes
naturally to be moved and affected. Melancholy
objects suit it, and even disastrous and sorrowful,
provided they are softened by some circumstance.
It is certain, that on the theatre, the representation
has almost the effect of reality; but yet it has not
altogether that effect. However we may be hur∣ried
away by the spectacle; whatever dominion
the senses and imagination may usurp over the rea∣son,
there still lurks at the bottom a certain idea
of falshood in the whole of what we see. This
idea, tho' weak and disguised, suffices to diminish
the pain which we suffer from the misfortunes of
those whom we love, and to reduce that affliction
to such a pitch as converts it into a pleasure. We
weep for the misfortune of a hero, to whom we
are attached. In the same instant we comfort our∣selves,
by reflecting, that it is nothing but a fiction:
And it is precisely that mixture of sentiments, which
composes an agreeable sorrow, and tears that de∣light
us. But as that affliction, which is caused by
<PB N="353" REF="345"/>
exterior and sensible objects, is stronger than the
consolation which arises from an internal reflection,
they are the effects and symptoms of sorrow, which
ought to prevail in the composition.”</P>
<P>THIS solution seems just and convincing; but per∣haps
it wants still some new addition, in order to
make it answer fully the phaenomenon, which we
here examine. All the passions, excited by eloquence,
are agreeable in the highest degree, as well as those
which are moved by painting and the theatre. The
epilogues of CICERO are, on this account chiefly, the
delight of every reader of taste; and it is difficult to
read some of them without the deepest sympathy and
sorrow. His merit as an orator, no doubt, depends
much on his success in this particular. When he had
raised tears in his judges and all his audience, they
were then the most highly delighted, and expressed
the greatest satisfaction with the pleader. The pa∣thetic
description of the butchery made by VERRES of
the SICILIAN captains is a master-piece of this kind:
But I believe none will affirm, that the being present
at a melancholy scene of that nature would afford any
entertainment. Neither is the sorrow here softened
by fiction: For the audience were convinced of the
reality of every circumstance. What is it then,
which in this case raises a pleasure from the bosom of
uneasiness, so to speak; and a pleasure, which still
<PB N="354" REF="346"/>
retains all the features and outward symptoms of dis∣tress
and sorrow?</P>
<P>I ANSWER: This extrordinary effect proceeds from
that very eloquence, with which the melancholy
scene is represented. The genius required to paint
objects in a lively manner, the art employed in col∣lecting
all the pathetic circumstances, the judgment
displayed in disposing them; the exercise, I say, of
these noble talents, together with the force of expres∣sion,
and beauty of oratorial numbers, diffuse the
highest satisfaction on the audience, and excite the
most delightful movements. By this means, the un∣easiness
of the melancholy passions is not only over∣powered
and effaced by something stronger of an op∣posite
kind; but the whole movement of those pas∣sions
is converted into pleasure, and swells the delight
which the eloquence raises in us. The same force of
oratory, employed on an uninteresting subject, would
not please half so much, or rather would appear alto∣gether
ridiculous; and the mind, being left in abso∣lute
calmness and indifference, would relish none of
those beauties of imagination or expression, which, if
joined to passion, give it such exquisite entertainment.
The impulse or vehemence, arising from sorrow, com∣passion,
indignation, receives a new direction from
the sentiments of beauty. The latter, being the
predominant emotion, seize the whole mind, and con∣vert
the former into themselves, or at least, tincture
<PB N="355" REF="347"/>
them so strongly as totally to alter their nature: And
the soul, being, at the same time, rouzed by passion,
and charmed by eloquence, feels on the whole a
strong movement, which is altogether delightful.</P>
<P>THE same principle takes place in tragedy; with
this addition, that tragedy is an imitation, and imi∣tation
is always of itself agreeable. This circum∣stance
serves still farther to smooth the motions of
passion, and convert the whole seeling into one uni∣form
and strong enjoyment. Objects of the greatest
terror and distress please in painting, and please more
than the most beautiful objects, that appear calm and
indifferent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Painters make no scruple of representing distress and sorrow as well as any other passion: But they seem not to dwell so much on these melancholy affections as the poets, who, tho' they copy every emotion of the human breast, yet pass very quick∣ly over the agreeable sentiments. A painter represents only one instant; and if that be passionate enough, it is sure to affect and delight the spectator: But nothing can furnish to the poet a variety of scenes and incidents and sentiments, except distress, terror, or anxiety. Compleat joy and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atisfaction is attended with security, and leaves no farther room for action.</NOTE>. The affection, rouzing the mind, ex∣cites
a large stock of spirit and vehemence; which is
all transformed into pleasure by the force of the pre∣vailing
movement. It is thus the fiction of tragedy
softens the passion, by an infusion of a new feeling,
<PB N="356" REF="348"/>
not merely by weakening or diminishing the sorrow.
You may be degrees weaken a real sorrow, till it to∣tally
disappears; yet in none of its gradations will it
ever give pleasure; except, perhaps, by accident, to
a man sunk under lethargic indolence, whom it rou∣zes
from that languid state.</P>
<P>TO confirm this theory, it will be sufficient to pro∣duce
other instances, where the subordinate move∣ment
is converted into the predominant, and gives
force to it, tho' of a different, and even sometimes
tho' of a contrary nature.</P>
<P>NOVELTY naturally excites the mind, and attracts
our attention; and the movements, which it causes,
are always converted into any passion, belonging to
the object, and join their force to it. Whether an
event excites joy or sorrow, pride or shame, anger or
good-will, it is sure to produce a stronger affection,
when new or unusual. And tho' novelty of itself be
agreeable, it enforces the painful, as well as agreeable
passions.</P>
<P>HAD you any intention to move a person extreme∣ly
by the narration of any event, the best method of
increasing its effect would be artfully to delay inform∣ing
him of it, and first excite his curiosity and impa∣tience
before you let him into the secret. This is the
artifice practised by IAGO in the famous scene of
<PB N="357" REF="349"/>
SHAKESPEARE; and every spectator is sensible, that
OTHELLO's jealousy acquires additional force from
his preceding impatience, and that the subordinate
passion is here readily transformed into the predo∣minant.</P>
<P>DIFFICULTIES increase passions of every kind;
and by rousing our attention, and exciting our active
powers, they produce an emotion, which nourishes
the prevailing affection.</P>
<P>PARENTS commonly love that child most, whose
sickly infirm frame of body has occasioned them the
greatest pains, trouble, and anxiety, in rearing him.
The agreeable sentiment of affection here acquires
force from sentiments of uneasiness.</P>
<P>NOTHING endears so much a friend as sorrow for
his death. The pleasure of his company has not so
powerful an influence.</P>
<P>JEALOUSY is a painful passion; yet, without some
share of it, the agreeable affection of love has diffi∣culty
to subsist in its full force and violence. Absence
is also a great source of complaint amongst lovers,
and gives them the greatest uneasiness: Yet nothing
is more favourable to their mutual passion than short
intervals of that kind. And if long intervals be per∣nicious,
it is only because, thro' time, men are ac∣customed
<PB N="358" REF="350"/>
to them, and they cease to give uneasiness.
Jealousy and absence in love compose the <HI>dolce pic∣cante</HI>
of the ITALIANS, which they suppose so essen∣tial
to all pleasure.</P>
<P><HI>THERE is a fine observation of the elder PLINY,

which poets, orators, and musicians give us, by ex∣citing,
grief, sorrow, indignation, compassion, is not
so extraordinary nor paradoxical, as it may at first
sight appear. The force of imagination, the energy
of expression, the power of numbers, the charms of
imitation; all these are naturally, of themselves, de∣lightful
to the mind: And when the object presented
lays also hold of some affection, the pleasure still rises
upon us, by the conversion of this subordinate move∣ment
into that which is predominant. The passion,
tho', perhaps, naturally, and when excited by the
simple appearance of a real object, it may be painful;
yet is so smoothed, and softened, and mollified, when
raised by the finer arts, that it affords the highest en∣tertainment.</P>
<P>To confirm this reasoning, we may observe, that
if the movements of the imagination be not predo∣minant
above those of the passion, a contrary effect
follows; and the former, being now subordinate,
is converted into the latter, and still farther increases
the pain and affliction of the sufferer.</P>
<P>WHO could ever think of it as a good expedient
for comforting an afflicted parent, to exaggerate, with
all the force of oratory, the irreparable loss, which
he has met with by the death of a favourite child?
The more power of imagination and expression you
<PB N="360" REF="352"/>
here employ, the more you increase his despair and
affliction.</P>
<P>THE shame, confusion, and terror of VERRES, no
doubt, rose in proportion to the noble eloquence and
vehemence of CICERO: So also did his pain and
uneasiness. These former passions were too strong
for the pleasure arising from the beauties of elocu∣tion;
and operated, tho' from the same principle,
yet in a contrary manner, to the sympathy, compas∣sion,
and indignation of the audience.</P>
<P>LORD CLARENDON, when he approaches the ca∣tastrophe
of the royal party, supposes, that his narra∣tion
must then become infinitely disagreeable; and
he hurries over the King's death, without giving us
one circumstance of it. He considers it as too horrid
a scene to be contemplated with any satisfaction, or
even without the utmost pain and aversion. He
himself, as well as the readers of that age, were too
deeply concerned in the events, and felt a pain from
subjects, which an historian and a reader of another
age would regard as the most pathetic and most in∣teresting,
and, by consequence, the most agreeable.</P>
<P>AN action, represented in tragedy, may be too
bloody and atrocious. It may excite such move∣ments
of horror as will not soften into pleasure; and
the greatest energy of expression, bestowed on descrip∣tions
<PB N="361" REF="353"/>
of that nature, serves only to augment our un∣easiness.
Such is that action, represented in the
<HI>Ambitious Stepmother,</HI> where a venerable old man,
raised to the height of fury and despair, rushes against
a pillar, and striking his head upon it, besmears it all
over with mingled brains and gore. The ENGLISH
theatre abounds too much with such images.</P>
<P>EVEN the common sentiments of compassion re∣quire
to be softened by some agreeable affection, in
order to give a thorough satisfaction to the audience.
The mere suffering of plaintive virtue, under the tri∣umphant
tyranny and oppression of vice, forms a
disagreeable spectacle, and is carefully avoided by all
masters of the theatre. In order to dismiss, the audi∣ence
with intire satisfaction and contentment, the vir∣tue
must either convert itself into a noble courageous
despair, or the vice receive its proper punishment.</P>
<P>MOST painters appear in this light to have been
very unhappy in their subjects. As they wrought for
churches and convents, they have chiefly represented
such horrible subjects as crucifixions and martyrdoms,
where nothing appears but tortures, wounds, execu∣tions,
and passive suffering, without any action or af∣fection.
When they turned their pencil from this
ghastly mythology, they had recourse commonly to
OVID, whose fictions, tho' passionate and agreeable,
are scarce natural or probable enough for painting.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="354"/>
THE same inversion of that principle, which is
here insisted on, displays itself in common life, as in
the effects of oratory and poetry. Raise so the sub∣ordinate
passion that it becomes the predominant, it
swallows up that affection, which it before nourished
and increased. Too much jealousy extinguishes love:
Too much difficulty renders us indifferent: Too
much sickness and infirmity disgusts a selfish and un∣kind
parent.</P>
<P>WHAT so disagreeable as the dismal, gloomy,
disastrous stories, with which melancholy people en∣tertain
their companions? The uneasy passion, be∣ing
there raised alone, unaccompanied with any spirit,
genius, or eloquence, conveys a pure uneasiness, and
is attended with nothing that can soften it into plea∣sure
or satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the STANDARD of TASTE.</HEAD>
<P>THE great variety of Tastes, as well as of opini∣ons,
which prevail in the world, is too obvious
not to have fallen under every one's observation. Men
of the most confined knowledge are able to remark a
difference in the narrow circle of their acquaintance,
even where the persons have been educated under the
same government, and have early imbibed the same
prejudices. But those who can enlarge their view to
contemplate distant nations and remote ages, are still
more surprized at the great inconsistence and contra∣diction.
We are apt to call <HI>barbarous</HI> whatever de∣parts
widely from our own taste and apprehension:
But soon find the epithet of reproach retorted on
us. And the highest arrogance and self-conceit is
at last startled, on observing an equal assurance on all
sides, and scruples, amidst such a contest of sentiments,
to pronounce positively in its own favour.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="356"/>
As this variety of taste is obvious to the most care∣less
enquirer; so will it be found, on examination,
to be still greater in reality than in appearance. The
sentiments of men often differ with regard to beauty
and deformity of all kinds, even while their general
discourse is the same. There are certain terms in
every language, which import blame, and others
praise; and all men, who use the same tongue, must
agree in their application of them. Every voice is
united in applauding elegance, propriety, simplicity,
spirit in writing; and in blaming sustian, affectation,
coldness, and a false brilliancy: But when critics come
to particulars, this seeming unanimity vanishes; and
it is found, that they had affixed a very different
meaning to their expressions. In all matters of opi∣nion
and science, the case is opposite: The difference
among men is there oftner found to lie in generals
than in particulars; and to be less in reality than in
appearance. An explication of the terms commonly
ends the controversy; and the disputants are surprized
to find, that they had been quarrelling, while at bot∣tom
they agreed in their judgment.</P>
<P>THOSE who found morality on sentiment, more
than on reason, are inclined to comprehend ethics un∣der
the former observation, and to suppose, that in all
questions, which regard conduct and manners, the
difference among men is really greater than at first
sight it appears. It is indeed obvious, that writers of
<PB N="365" REF="357"/>
all nations and all ages concur in applauding justice,
humanity, magnanimity, prudence, veracity; and in
blaming the opposite qualities. Even poets and other
authors, whose compositions are chiefly calculated to
please the imagination, are yet found, from HOMER
down to FENELON, to inculcate the same moral pre∣cepts,
and to bestow their applause and blame on the
same virtues and vices. This great unanimity is usu∣ally
ascribed to the influence of plain reason; which,
in all these cases, maintains similar sentiments in all
men, and prevents those controversies, to which the
abstract sciences are so much exposed. So far as the
unanimity is real, the account may be admitted as
satisfactory: But it must also be allowed, that some
part of the seeming harmony in morals may be ac∣counted
for from the very nature of language. The
word, <HI>virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> with its equivalent in every tongue,
implies praise; as that of <HI>vice</HI> does blame: And no
one, without the most obvious and grossest impropri∣ety,
could affix reproach to a term, which in general
use is understood in a good sense; or bestow applause,
where the idiom requires disapprobation. HOMER's
general precepts, where he delivers any such, will
never be controveted; but it is very obvious, that
when he draws particular pictures of manners, and
represents heroism in ACHILLES and prudence in
ULYSSES, he intermixes a much greater degree of
ferocity in the former, and of cunning and fraud in
the latter, than FENELON would admit of. The sage
<PB N="366" REF="358"/>
ULYSSES in the GREEK poet seems to delight in
lies and fictions, and often employs them without
any necessity or even advantage: But his more s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ru∣pulous
son in the FRENCH epic writer exposes him∣self
to the most imminent perils, rather than depart
from the exactest line of truth and veracity.</P>
<P>THE admirers and followers of the ALCORAN in∣sist
very much on the excellent moral precepts, which
are interspersed throughout that wild performance.
But it is to be supposed, that the ARABIC words,
which correspond to the ENGLISH, equity, justice,
temperance, meekness, charity, were such as, from
the constant use of that tongue, must always be taken
in a good sense; and it would have argued the great∣est
ignorance, not of morals, but of language, to
have mentioned them with any epithets, besides those
of applause and approbation. But would we know,
whether the pretended prophet had really attained a
just sentiment of morals? Let us attend to his nar∣ration;
and we shall soon find, that he bestows praise
on such instances of treachery, inhumanity, cruelty,
revenge, bigotry, as are utterly incompatible with
civilized society. No steady rule of right seems there
to be attended to; and every action is blamed or
praised, so far only as it is beneficial or hurtful to the
true believers.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="359"/>
THE merit of delivering true general precepts in
ethics is indeed very small. Whoever recommends
any moral virtues, really does no more than is implied
in the terms themselves. The people, who invented
the word <HI>charity,</HI> and used it in a good sense, incul∣cated
more clearly and much more efficaciously, the
precept, <HI>be charitable,</HI> than any pretended legislator
or prophet, who should insert such a <HI>maxim</HI> in his writ∣ings.
Of all expressions, those, which, together with
their other meaning, imply a degree either of blame
or approbation, are the least liable to be perverted or
mistaken.</P>
<P>IT is natural for us to seek a <HI>Standard of Taste;</HI> a
rule, by which the various sentiments of men may be
reconciled; or at least, a decision afforded, confirm∣ing
one sentiment, and condemning another.</P>
<P>THERE is a species of philosophy, which cuts off
all hopes of success in such an attempt, and represents
the impossibility of ever attaining any standard of
taste. The difference, it is said, is very wide between
judgment and sentiment. All sentiment is right; be∣cause
sentiment has a reference to nothing beyond it∣self,
and is always real, wherever a man is conscious
of it. But all determinations of the understanding
are not right; because they have a reference to some∣thing
beyond themselves, to wit, real matter of fact;
and are not always conformable to that standard.
<PB N="368" REF="360"/>
Among a thousand different opinions which dif∣ferent
men may entertain of the same subject,
there is one, and but one, that is just and true;
and the only difficulty is to fix and ascertain it.
On the contrary, a thousand different sentiments,
excited by the same object, are all right: Because
no sentiment represents what is really in the ob∣ject.
It only marks a certain conformity or rela∣tion
between the object and the organs or faculties of
the mind; and if that conformity did not really ex∣ist,
the sentiment could never possibly have a being.
Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists
merely in the mind which contemplates them; and
each mind perceives a different beauty. One person
may even perceive deformity, where another is sen∣sible
of beauty; and every individual ought to acqui∣esce
in his own sentiment, without pretending to re∣gulate
those of others. To seek the real beauty, or
real deformity is as fruitless an enquiry, as to pretend
to ascertain the real sweet or real bitter. According
to the disposition of the organs, the same object may
be both sweet and bitter; and the proverb has justly
determined it to be fruitless to dispute concerning
tastes. It is very natural, and even quite necessary,
to extend this axiom to mental, as well as bodily
taste; and thus common sense, which is so often at
variance with philosophy, especially with the scep∣tical
kind, is sound, in one instance at least, to agree
in pronouncing the same decision.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="361"/>
BUT though this axiom, by passing into a proverb,
seems to have attained the sanction of common sense;
there is certainly a species of common sense which op∣poses
it, or at least serves to modify and restrain
it. Whoever would assert an equality of genius and
elegance between OGILBY and MILTON, or BUNYAN
and ADDISON, would be thought to defend no less an
extravagance, than if he had maintained a molehill
to be as high as TENERIFFE, or a pond as extensive
as the ocean. Tho' there may be found persons, who
give the preference to the former authors; no one
pays attention to such a taste; and we pronounce
without scruple the sentiment of these pretended cri∣tics
to be absurd and ridiculous. The principle of the
natural equality of tastes is then totally forgot; and
while we admit of it on some occasions, where the
objects seem near an equality, it appears an extrava∣gant
paradox, or rather a palpable absurdity, where
objects so disproportioned are compared together.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that none of the rules of composition
are fixed by reasonings <HI>a priori,</HI> or can be esteemed
abstract conclusions of the understanding, from com∣paring
those habitudes and relations of ideas, which
are eternal and immutable. Their foundation is the
same with that of all the practical sciences, experi∣ence;
nor are they any thing but general observa∣tions,
concerning what has been universally found to
please in all countries and in all ages. Many of the
<PB N="370" REF="362"/>
beauties of poetry and even of eloquence are founded
on falshood and fiction, on hyperboles, metaphors, and
an abuse or perversion of expressions from their natu∣ral
meaning. To check the sallies of the imagination,
and to reduce every expression to geometrical truth
and exactness, would be the most contrary to the laws
of criticism; because it would produce a work, which,
by universal experience, has been found the most in∣sipid
and disagreeable. But tho' poetry can never sub∣mit
to exact truth, it must be confined by rules of art,
discovered to the author either by genius or observa∣tion.
If some negligent or irregular writers have
pleased, they have not pleased by their transgressions
of rule or order, but in spite of these transgressions:
They have possessed other beauties, which were con∣sormable
to just criticism; and the force of these beau∣ties
has been able to overpower censure, and give the
mind a satisfaction superior to the disgust arising from
the blemishes. ARIOSTO pleases; but not by his
monstrous and improbable fictions, by his bizarre
mixture of the serious and comic styles, by the want
of coherence in his stories, or by the continual inter∣ruptions
of his narration. He charms by the force and
clearness of his expression, by the readiness and vari∣ety
of his inventions, and by his natural pictures of
the passions, especially those of the gay and amorous
kind: And however his faults may diminish our satis∣faction,
they are not able entirely to destroy it. Did
our pleasure really arise from those parts of his poem,
<PB N="371" REF="363"/>
which we denominate faults, this would be no objec∣tion
to criticism in general: It would only be an ob∣jection
to those particular rules of criticism, which
would establish such circumstances to be faults, and
would represent them as universally blameable. If
they are found to please, they cannot be faults; let
the pleasure, which they produce, be ever so unex∣pected
and unaccountable.</P>
<P>BUT though all the general rules of art are founded
only on experience and on the observation of the com∣mon
sentiments of human nature, we must not ima∣gine,
that, on every occasion, the feelings of men
will be conformable to these rules. Those finer emo∣tions
of the mind are of a very tender and delicate
nature, and require the concurrence of many favour∣able
circumstances to make them play with facility
and exactness, according to their general and establish∣ed
principles. The least exterior hindrance to such
small springs, or the least internal disorder, disturbs
their motion, and confounds the operation of the
whole machine. When we would make an experi∣ment
of this nature, and would try the force of any
beauty or deformity, we must choose with care a pro∣per
time and place, and bring the fancy to a suitable
situation and disposition. A perfect serenity of mind,
a recollection of thought, a due attention to the ob∣ject;
if any of these circumstances be wanting our
<PB N="372" REF="364"/>
experiment will be fallacious, and we shall be unable
to judge of the catholic and universal beauty. The
relation, which nature has placed between the form
and the sentiment, will at least be more obscure; and
it will require greater accuracy to trace and discern it.
We shall be able to ascertain its influence not so much
from the operation of each particular beauty, as from
the durable admiration, which attends those works,
that have survived all the caprices of mode and fashion,
all the mistakes of ignorance and envy.</P>
<P>THE same HOMER, who pleased at ATHENS and
ROME two thousand years ago, is still admired at
PARIS and at LONDON. All the changes of climate,
government, religion, and language, have not been
able to obscure his glory. Authority or prejudice
may give a temporary vogue to a bad poet or orator;
but his reputation will never be durable or general.
When his compositions are examined by posterity or
by foreigners, the enchantment is dissipated, and his
faults appear in their true colours. On the contrary,
a real genius, the longer his works endure, and the
more wide they are spread, the more sincere is the admi∣ration
which he meets with. Envy and jealousy have
too much place in a narrow circle; and even familiar
acquaintance with his person may diminish the ap∣plause
due to his performances: But when these ob∣structions
are removed, the beauties, which are natu∣rally
fitted to excite agreeable sentiments, immedi∣ately
<PB N="373" REF="365"/>
display their energy; and while the world en∣dures,
they maintain their authority over the minds
of men.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that amidst all the variety and
caprice of taste, there are certain general principles
of approbation or blame, whose influence a careful
eye may trace in all operations of the mind. Some
particular forms or qualities, from the original struc∣ture
of the internal fabric, are culculated to please,
and others to displease; and if they fail of their ef∣fect
in any particular instance, it is from some appa∣rent
defect or imperfection in the organ. A man in
a fever would not insist on his palate as able to decide
concerning flavours; nor would one, affected with the
jaundice, pretend to give a verdict with regard to
colours. In each creature, there is a sound and a de∣fective
state; and the former alone can be supposed to
afford us a true standard of taste and sentiment. If
in the sound state of the organs, there be an entire or
a considerable uniformity of sentiment among men,
we may thence derive an idea of the perfect beauty;
in like manner as the appearance of objects in day∣light
to the eye of a man in health is denominated
their true and real colour, even while colour is allowed
to be merely a phantasm of the senses.</P>
<P>MANY and frequent are the defects in the internal
organs, which prevent or weaken the influence of
<PB N="374" REF="366"/>
those general principles, on which depends our senti∣ment
of beauty or deformity. Tho' some objects, by
the structure of the mind, be naturally calculated to
give pleasure, it is not to be expected, that in every
individual the pleasure will be equally felt. Particu∣lar
incidents and situations occur, which either throw
a false light on the objects, or hinder the true from
conveying to the imagination the proper sentiment
and perception.</P>
<P>ONE obvious cause, why many feel not the proper
sentiment of beauty, is the want of that <HI>delicacy</HI> of
imagination, which is requisite to convey a sensibility
of those finer emotions. This delicacy every one
pretends to: Every one talks of it; and would re∣duce
every kind of taste or sentiment to its standard.
But as our intention in this dissertation is to mingle
some light of the understanding with the feelings of
sentiment, it will be proper to give a more accurate
definition of delicacy, than has hitherto been at∣tempted.
And not to draw our philosophy from
too profound a source, we shall have recourse to a
noted story in Don QUIXOTE.</P>
<P>'TIS with good reason, says SANCHO to the squire
with the great nose, that I pretend to have a judg∣ment
in wine: This is a quality hereditary in our fa∣mily.
Two of my kinsmen were once called to give
their opinion of a hogshead, which was supposed to
<PB N="375" REF="367"/>
be excellent, being old and of a good vintage. One
of them tastes it; considers it, and after mature re∣flection
pronounces the wine to be good, were it not
for a small taste of leather, which he perceived in it.
The other, after using the same precautions, gives al∣so
his verdict in favour of the wine; but with the re∣serve
of a taste of iron, which he could easily dis∣tinguish.
You cannot imagine how much they were
both ridiculed for their judgment. But who laughed
in the end? On emptying the hogshead, there was
found at the bottom, an old key with a leathern thong
tied to it.</P>
<P>THE great resemblance between mental and bodily
taste will easily teach us to apply this story. Tho' it
be certain, that beauty and deformity, no more than
sweet and bitter, are not qualities in objects, but be∣long
entirely to the sentiment, internal or external;
it must be allowed, that there are certain qualities in
objects, which are fitted by nature to produce those
particular feelings. Now as these qualities may be
found in a small degree or may be mixed and con∣founded
with each other, it often happens, that the
taste is not affected with such minute qualities, or is
not able to distinguish all the particular flavours, amidst
the disorder, in which they are presented. Where
the organs are so fine, as to allow nothing to escape
them; and at the same so exact as to perceive every
ingredient in the composition: This we call delicacy
<PB N="376" REF="368"/>
of taste, whether we employ these terms in the na∣tural
or metaphorical sense. Here then the general
rules of beauty are of use; being drawn from esta∣blished
models, and from the observation of what
pleases or displeases, when presented singly and in a
high degree: And if the same qualities, in a con∣tinued
composition and in a smaller degree, affect not
the organs with a sensible delight or uneasiness, we
exclude the person from all pretensions to this deli∣cacy.
To produce these general rules or avowed
patterns of composition is like finding the key with the
leathern thong; which justified the verdict of SAN∣CHO's
kinsmen, and confounded those pretended judges
who had condemned them. Tho' the hogshead had
never been emptied, the taste of the one was still
equally delicate, and that of the other equally dull
and languid: But it would have been more difficult
to have proved the superiority of the former, to the
conviction of every by stander. In like manner, tho'
the beauties of writing had never been methodized,
or reduced to general principls; tho' no excellent
models had ever been acknowledged; the different de∣grees
of taste would still have subsisted, and the judg∣ment
of one man been preserable to that of another;
but it would not have been so easy to silence the bad
critic, who might always insist upon his particular sen∣timent,
and refuse to submit to his antagonist. But when
we show him an avowed principle of art; when we il∣lustrate
this principle by examples, whose operation, from
his own particular taste, he acknowledges to be conform∣able
<PB N="377" REF="369"/>
to the principle; when we prove, that the same
principle may be applied to the present case, where
he did not perceive nor feel its influence: He must
conclude, upon the whole, that the fault lies in him∣self,
and that he wants the delicacy, which is requisite
to make him sensible of every beauty and every ble∣mish,
in any composition or discourse.</P>
<P>'TIS acknowledged to be the perfection of every
sense or faculty, to perceive with exactness its most
minute objects, and allow nothing to escape its notice
and observation. The smaller the objects are, which
become sensible to the eye, the finer is that organ,
and the more elaborate its make and composition. A
good palate is not tried by strong flavours; but by a
mixture of small ingredients, where we are still sens∣ible
of each part, notwithstanding its minuteness and
its confusion with the rest. In like manner, a quick
and acute perception of beauty and deformity must be
the perfection of our mental taste, nor can a man be
satisfied with himself, while he suspects, that any ex∣cellence
or blemish in a discourse has passed him un∣observed.
In this case, the perfection of the man,
and the perfection of the sense or feeling, are found
to be united. A very delicate palate, on many oc∣casions,
may be a great inconvenience both to a man
himself and to his friends; but a delicate taste of wit
or beauty must always be a desirable quality; because
it is the source of all the finest and most innocent en∣joyments,
of which human nature is susceptible. In
<PB N="378" REF="370"/>
this decision the sentiments of all mankind are agreed.
Wherever you can fix or ascertain a delicacy of taste,
it is sure to be approved of; and the best way of
fixing it is to appeal to those models and principles,
which have been established by the uniform approba∣tion
and experience of nations and ages.</P>
<P>BUT tho' there be naturally a very wide difference
in point of delicacy between one person and another,
nothing tends further to encrease and improve this
talent, than <HI>practice</HI> in a particular art, and the fre∣quent
survey or contemplation of a particular species
of beauty. When objects of any kind are first pre∣sented
to the eye or imagination, the sentiment, which
attends them, is obscure and confused; and the mind
is, in a great measure, incapable of pronouncing con∣cerning
their merits or defects. The taste cannot per∣ceive
the several excellencies of the performance;
much less distinguish the particular character of each
excellency, and ascertain its quality and degree. If
it pronounce the whole in general to be beautiful or
deformed, 'tis the utmost which can be expected; and
even this judgment a person, so unpractised, will be
apt to deliver with great hesitation and reserve. But
allow him to acquire experience in those objects, his
feeling becomes more exact and nice: He not only
perceives the beauties and defects of each part, but
marks the distinguishing species of each quality, and
assigns it suitable praise or blame. A clear and dis∣tinct
<PB N="379" REF="371"/>
sentiment attends him through the whole sur∣vey
of the objects; and he discerns that very de∣gree
and kind of approbation or displeasure, which
each part is naturally fitted to produce. The mist
dissipates, which seemed formerly to hang over the
object: The organ acquires greater perfection in its
operations; and can pronounce, without danger of
mistake, concerning the merits of each performance.
In a word, the same address and dexterity, which
practice gives to the execution of any work, is also
acquired, by the same means, in the judging of it.</P>
<P>So advantageous is practice to the discernment of
beauty, that before we can pronounce judgment on
any work of importance, it will even be requisite,
that that very individual performance be more than
once perused by us, and be surveyed in different lights
with attention and deliberation. There is a flutter or
hurry of thought, which attends the first perusal of
any piece, and which confounds the genuine sentiment
of beauty. The reference of the parts is not dis∣cerned:
The true characters of style are little distin∣guished:
The several perfections and defects seem
wrapped up in a species of confusion, and present
themselves indistinctly to the imagination. Not to
mention, that there is a species of beauty, which, as
it is florid and superficial, pleases at first; but being
found incompatible with a just expression either of
<PB N="380" REF="372"/>
reason or passion, soon palls upon the taste, and is
then rejected with disdain, at least rated at a much
lower value.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to continue in the practice of con∣templating
any order of beauty, without being fre∣quently
obliged to form <HI>comparisons</HI> between the seve∣ral
species and degrees of excellency, and estimating
their proportion to each other. A man, who has had no
opportunity of comparing the different kinds of beau∣ty,
is indeed totally unqualified to pronounce an opi∣nion
with regard to any object presented to him.
By comparison alone we fix the epithets of praise or
blame, and learn how to assign the due degree of
each. The coarseft dawbing of a sign-post contains a
certain lustre of colours and exactness of imitation,
which are so far beauties, and would affect the mind
of a peasant or Indian with the highest admiration.
The most vulgar ballads are not entirely destitute of
harmony or nature; and none but a person, familia∣rized
to superior beauties, would pronounce their num∣bers
harsh, or narration uninteresting. A great in∣feriority
of beauty gives pain to a person conversant
in the highest excellency of the kind, and is for that
reason pronounced a deformity: As the most finished
object, with which we are acquainted, is naturally
supposed to have reached the pinnacle of perfection,
and to be entitled to the highest applause. A man,
who has had opportunities of seeing, and examining
<PB N="381" REF="373"/>
and weighing the several performances, admired in
different ages and nations, can alone rate the merits
of a work exhibited to his view, and assign its proper
rank among the productions of genius.</P>
<P>BUT to enable him the more fully to execute this
undertaking, he must preserve his mind free from all
<HI>prejudice,</HI> and allow nothing to enter into his conside∣ration,
but the very object, which is submitted to his
examination. We may observe, that every work of
art, in order to produce its due effect on the mind,
must be surveyed in a certain point of view, and can∣not
be fully relished by persons, whose situation, real
or imaginary, is not conformable to that required by
the performance. An orator addresses himself to a
particular audience, and must have a regard to their
particular genius, interests, opinions, passions, and
prejudices; otherwise he hopes in vain to govern their
resolutions, and inflame their affections. Should they
even have entertained some prepossessions against him,
however unreasonable, he must not overlook this dis∣advantage;
but before he enters upon the subject,
must endeavour to conciliate their affection, and ac∣quire
their good graces. A critic of a different age
or nation, who should peruse this discourse, must
have all these circumstances in his eye, and must place
himself in the same situation as the audience, in order
to form a true judgment of the oration. In like man∣ner,
<PB N="382" REF="374"/>
when any work is addressed to the public, tho'
I should have a friendship or enmity with the author,
I must depart from this particular situation; and con∣sidering
myself as a man in general, forget, if possible,
my individual being and my peculiar circumstances.
A person, influenced by prejudice, complies not with
this condition; but obstinately maintains his natural
position, without entering into that required by the
performance. If the work be addressed to persons of
a different age or nation, he makes no allowance for
their peculiar views and prejudices; but full of the
manners of his own times, rashly condemns what
seemed admirable in the eyes of those for whom alone
the discourse was calculated. If the work be executed
for the public, he never sufficiently enlarges his com∣prehension,
or forgets his interest as a friend or ene∣my,
as a rival or commentator. By this means, his
sentiments are perverted; nor have the same beauties
and blemishes the same influence upon him, as if he
had imposed a proper violence on his imagination, and
had forgot himself for a moment. So far his taste
evidently departs from the true standard; and of con∣sequence
loses all credit and authority.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that, in all questions, submitted
to the understanding, prejudice is most destructive of
sound judgment, and perverts all operations of the in∣tellectual
faculties: It is no less contrary to good taste;
nor has it less influence to corrupt our sentiments of
<PB N="383" REF="375"/>
beauty. It belongs to <HI>good sense</HI> to check its influ∣ence
in both cases; and in this respect, as well as in
many others, reason, if not an essential part of taste,
is at least requisite to the operations of this latter fa∣culty.
In all the nobler productions of genius, there
is a mutual relation and correspondence of parts; nor
can either the beauties or blemishes be perceived by
him, whose thought is not capacious enough to com∣prehend
all those parts, and compare them with each
other, in order to perceive the consistence and uni∣formity
of the whole. Every work of art has also
a certain end or purpose, for which it is calculated;
and is to be deemed more or less perfect, as it is more
or less fitted to attain this end. The object of elo∣quence
is to persuade, of history to instruct, of poetry
to please by means of the passions and the imagina∣tion.
These ends we must carry constantly in our
view, when we peruse any performance; and we must
be able to judge how far the means employed are
adapted to their respective purposes. Besides, every
kind of composition, even the most poetical, is no∣thing
but a chain of propositions and reasonings; not
always indeed the justest and most exact, but still
plausible and specious, however disguised by the co∣louring
of the imagination. The persons, intro∣duced
in tragedy and epic poetry, must be repre∣sented
as reasoning and thinking, and concluding
and acting, suitable to their characters and circum∣stances;
and without judgment, as well as taste and
<PB N="384" REF="376"/>
invention, a poet can never hope to succeed in so de∣licate
an undertaking. Not to mention, that the same
excellence of faculties which contributes to the im∣provement
of reason, the same clearness of concep∣tion,
the same exactness of distinction, the same vi∣vacity
of apprehension, are essential to the operations
of true taste, and are its infallible concomitants. It
seldom, or never happens, that a man of sense, who
has experience in any art, cannot judge of its beauty;
and it is no less rare to meet with a man, who has a
just taste, without a sound understanding.</P>
<P>THUS, tho' the principles of taste be universal, and
nearly, if not entirely the same in all men; yet few
are qualified to give judgment on any work of art, or
establish their own sentiment as the standard of beauty.
The organs of internal sensation are seldom so perfect
as to allow the general principles their full play, and
produce a feeling correspondent to those principles.
They either labour under some defect, or are vitiated
by some disorder; and by that means, excite a sen∣timent,
which may be pronounced erroneous. When
the critic has no delicacy, he judges without any dis∣tinction,
and is only affected by the grosser and more
palpable qualities of the object: The finer touches
pass unnoticed and disregarded. Where he is not
aided by practice, his verdict is attended with con∣fusion
and hesitation. Where no comparison has been
employed, the most frivolous beauties, such as rather
<PB N="385" REF="377"/>
merit the name of defects, are the objects of his admi∣ration.
Where he lies under the influence of preju∣dice,
all his natural sentiments are perverted. Where
good sense is wanting, he is not qualified to discern
the beauties of design and reasoning, which are the
highest and most excellent. Under some or other of
these imperfections, the generality of men labour;
and hence a true judge in the finer arts is observed,
even during the most polished ages, to be so rare a
character: Strong sense united to delicate sentiment,
improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and
cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to
this valuable character; and the joint verdict of such,
wherever they are to be found, is the true standard of
taste and beauty.</P>
<P>BUT where are such critics to be found? By what
marks are they to be known? How distinguish them
from pretenders? These questions are embarrassing;
and seem to throw us back into the same uncertainty,
from which, during the course of this essay, we have
endeavoured to extricate ourselves.</P>
<P>BUT if we consider the matter aright, these are
questions of fact, not of sentiment. Whether any
particular person be endowed with good sense and a
delicate imagination, free from prejudice, may often
be the subject of dispute, and be liable to great dis∣cussion
<PB N="386" REF="378"/>
and enquiry: But that such a character is va∣luable
and estimable will be agreed by all mankind.
Where these doubts occur, men can do no more than
in other disputable questions, which are submitted to
the understanding: They must produce the best ar∣guments,
which their invention suggests to them;
they must acknowledge a true and decisive standard
to exist somewhere, to wit, real existence and matter
of fact; and they must have indulgence to such as
differ from them in their appeals to this standard.
It is sufficient for our present purpose, if we have
proved, that the taste of all individuals is not upon
an equal footing, and that some men in general,
however difficult to be particularly pitched upon, will
be acknowledged by universal sentiment to have a
preference above others.</P>
<P>BUT in reality the difficulty of finding, even in
particulars, the standard of taste, is not so great as it
is represented. Tho' in speculation, we may readily
avow a certain criterion in science and deny it in sen∣timent,
the matter is found in practice to be much
more hard to ascertain in the former case than in the
latter. Theories of abstract philosophy, systems of
profound theology have prevailed during one age: In
a successive period, these have been universally ex∣ploded:
Their absurdity has been detected: Other
theories and systems have supplied their place, which
<PB N="387" REF="379"/>
again gave way to their successors: And nothing has
been experienced more liable to the revolutions of
chance and fashion than these pretended decisions of
science. The case is not the same with the beauties
of eloquence and poetry. Just expressions of passion
and nature are sure, after a little time, to gain public
vogue, which they maintain for ever. ARISTOTLE
and PLATO, and EPICURUS and DESCARTES, may
successively yield to each other: But TERENCE and
VIRGIL maintain an universal, undisputed empire
over the minds of men. The abstract philosophy of
CICERO has lost its credit: The vehemence of his
oratory is still the object of our admiration.</P>
<P>THO' men of delicate taste are rare, they are easily
to be distinguished in society by the soundness of their
understanding and the superiority of their faculties
above the rest of mankind. The ascendant, which
they acquire, gives a prevalence to that lively appro∣bation,
with which they receive any productions of
genius, and renders it generally predominant. Many
men, when left to themselves, have but a faint and
dubious perception of beauty, who yet are capable
of relishing any fine stroke, which is pointed out to
them. Every convert to the admiration of the real
poet or orator is the cause of some new conversion.
And tho' prejudices may prevail for a time, they ne∣ver
unite in celebrating any rival to the true genius,
<PB N="388" REF="380"/>
but yield at last to the force of nature and just senti∣ment.
And thus tho' a civilized nation may easily
be mistaken in the choice of their admired philoso∣pher,
they never have been found long to err, in
their affection for a favourite epic or tragic author.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding all our endeavours to fix a
standard of taste, and reconcile the various apprehen∣sions
of men, there still remain two sources of vari∣ation,
which are not sufficient indeed to confound all
the boundaries of beauty and deformity, but will
often serve to vary the degrees of our approbation or
blame. The one is the different humours of parti∣cular
men; the other, the particular manners and
opinions of our age and country. The general prin∣ciples
of taste are uniform in human nature: Where
men vary in their judgments, some defect of per∣version
in the faculties may commonly be remarked;
proceeding either from prejudice, from want of prac∣tice,
or want of delicacy; and there is just reason
for approving one taste, and condemning another.
But where there is such a diversity in the internal
frame or external situation as is entirely blameless on
both sides, and leaves no room to give one the pre∣ference
above the other; in that case a certain diver∣sity
of judgment is unavoidable, and we seek in vain
for a standard, by which we can reconcile the contrary
sentiments.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="381"/>
A YOUNG man, whose passions are warm, will be
more sensibly touched with amorous and tender
images, than a man more advanced in years, who
takes pleasure in wise and philosophical reflections
concerning the conduct of life and moderation of the
passions. At twenty, OVID may be the favourite
author; HORACE at forty; and perhaps TACITUS at
fifty. Vainly would we, in such cases, endeavour to
enter into the sentiments of others, and divest our∣selves
of those propensities, which are natural to us.
We chuse our favourite author as we do our friend,
from a conformity of humours and dispositions. Mirth
or passion, sentiment or reflection; which ever of
these most predominates in our temper, it gives us a
peculiar sympathy with the writer who resembles us.</P>
<P>ONE person is more pleased with the sublime; ano∣ther
with the tender; a third with raillery. One has
a strong sensibility to blemishes, and is extremely studi∣ous
of correctness: Another has a more lively feeling
of beauties, and pardons twenty absurdities and de∣fects
for one elevated or pathetic stroke. The ear of
this man is entirely turned towards conciseness and
energy; that man is delighted with a copious, rich,
and harmonious expression. Simplicity is affected by
one; ornament by another. Comedy, tragedy, sa∣tire,
odes have each their partizans, who prefer that
particular species of writing to all others. It is
plainly an error in a critic, to confine his approbation
<PB N="390" REF="382"/>
to one species or style of writing, and condemn all
the rest. But it is almost impossible not to feel a pre∣dilection
for that which suits our particular turn and
disposition. Such preferences are innocent and un∣avoidable,
and can never reasonably be the object of
dispute, because there is no standard, by which they
can be decided.</P>
<P>FOR a like reason, we are more pleased with pic∣tures
of characters, which resemble such as are found
in our own age or country, than with those which de∣scribe
a different set of customs. 'Tis not without some
effort, that we reconcile ourselves to the simplicity
of antient manners, and behold princesses drawing
water from a spring, and kings and heroes dressing
their own victuals. We may allow in general, that
the representation of such manners is no fault in the
author, nor deformity in the piece; but we are not
so sensibly touched with them. For this reason, co∣medy
is not transferred easily from one age or nation
to another. A FRENCHMAN or ENGLISHMAN is not
pleased with the ANDRIA of TERENCE, or CLITIA
of MACHIAVEL, where the fine lady, upon whom all
the play turns, never once appears to the spectators,
but is always kept behind the scenes, suitable to the
reserved humour of the antient GREEKS and modern
ITALIANS. A man of learning and reflection can
make allowance for these peculiarities of manners;
but a common audience can never divest themselves so
<PB N="391" REF="383"/>
far of their usual ideas and sentiments as to relish pic∣tures
which no way resemble them.</P>
<P>AND here there occurs a reflection, which may,
perhaps, be useful in examining the celebrated con∣troversy
concerning antient and modern learning;
where we often find the one side excusing any seeming
absurdity in the antients from the manners of the
age, and the other refusing to admit this excuse, or
at least, admitting it only as an apology for the au∣thor,
not for the performance. In my opinion, the
proper bounds in this subject have seldom been fixed
between the contending parties. Where any inno∣cent
peculiarities of manners are represented, such as
those abovementioned, they ought certainly to be ad∣mitted;
and a man who is shocked with them, gives
an evident proof of false delicacy and refinement.
The poets <HI>monument more durable than brass,</HI> must fall
to the ground like common brick or clay, were men
to make no allowance for the continual revolutions of
manners and customs, and would admit nothing but
what was suitable to the prevailing fashion. Must
we throw aside the pictures of our ancestors, because
of their ruffs and fardingales? But where the ideas
of morality and decency alter from one age to ano∣ther,
and where vicious manners are described, with∣out
being marked with the proper characters of blame
and disapprobation; this must be allowed to disfigure
the poem, and to be a real deformity. I cannot,
nor is it proper I should, enter into such sentiments;
<PB N="392" REF="384"/>
and however I may excuse the poet, on account of
the manners of his age, I never can relish the
composition. The want of humanity and of de∣cency,
so conspicuous in the characters drawn by
several of the antient poets, even sometimes by
HOMER and the GREEK tragedians, diminishes con∣siderably
the merit of their noble peformances,
and gives modern authors a great advantage over
them. We are not interested in the fortunes and
sentiments of such rough heroes: We are dis∣pleased
to find the limits of vice and virtue so con∣founded:
And whatever indulgence we may give the
writer on account of his prejudices, we cannot pre∣vail
on ourselves to enter into his sentiments, or bear
an affection to characters, which we plainly discover
to be blameable.</P>
<P>THE case is not the same with moral principles, as
with speculative opinions of any kind. These are in
continual flux and revolution. The son embraces a
different system from the father. Nay, there scarce
is any man, who can boast of great constancy and
uniformity in this particular. Whatever speculative
errors may be found in the polite writings of any age
or country, they detract but little from the value of
those compositions. There needs but a certain turn
of thought or imagination to make us enter into all
the opinions, which then prevailed, and relish the
<PB N="393" REF="385"/>
sentiments or conclusions derived from them. But a
very violent effort is requisite to change our judgment
of manners, and excite sentiments of approbation or
blame, love or hatred, different from those to which
the mind <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long custom has been familiarized.
And where a man is confident of the rectitude of that
moral standard, by which he judges, he is justly jea∣lous
of it, and will not pervert the sentiments of his
heart for a moment, in complaisance to any writer
whatever.</P>
<P>OF all speculative errors, those which regard reli∣gion,
are the most excusable in compositions of ge∣nius;
nor is it ever permitted to judge of the civility
or wisdom of any people, or even of single persons,
by the grossness or refinement of their theological
principles. The same good sense, that directs men
in the ordinary occurrences of life, is not hearkened
to in religious matters, which are supposed to be placed
entirely above the cognizance of human reason. Up∣on
this account, all the absurdities of the pagan sys∣tem
of theology must be overlooked by every critic,
who would pretend to form a just notion of antient
poetry; and our posterity, in their turn, must have
the same indulgence to their forefathers. No religi∣ous
principles can ever be imputed as a fault to any
poet, while they remain merely principles, and take
not such strong possession of his heart, as to lay him
under the imputation of <HI>bigotry</HI> or <HI>superstition.</HI> Where
<PB N="394" REF="386"/>
that happens, they confound the sentiments of mo∣rality,
and alter the natural boundaries of vice and
virtue. They are therefore eternal blemishes, accord∣ing
to the principle abovementioned: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or are the
prejudices and false opinions of the age sufficient to
justify them.</P>
<P>'TIS essential to the ROMAN catholic religion to in∣spire
a violent hatred to every other worship, and re∣present
all pagans, mahometans, and heretics as the
objects of divine wrath and vengeance. Such senti∣ments,
tho' they are in reality extremely blameable,
are considered as virtues by the zealots of that com∣munion,
and are represented in their tragedies and
epic poems as a kind of divine heroism. This bi∣gotry
has disfigured two very fine tragedies of the
FRENCH theatre, POLIEUCTE and ATHALIA; where
an intemperate zeal for particular modes of worship
is set off with all the pomp imaginable, and forms
the predominant character of the heroes. “What
is this,” says the heroic JOAD to JOSABET, finding
her in discourse with MATHAN, the priest of BAA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
“Does the daughter of DAVID speak to this traitor?
Are you not afraid, lest the earth should open and
pour forth flames to devour you both? Or lest
these holy walls should fall and crush you together?
What is his purpose? Why comes that enemy of
God hither to poison the air, which we breathe, with
<PB N="395" REF="387"/>
his horrid presence?” Such sentiments are received
with great applause on the theatre of PARIS; but at
LONDON the spectators would be full as much pleased
to hear ACHILLES tell AGAMEMNON, that he was a
dog in his forehead, and a deer in his heart, or JUPI∣TER
threaten JUNO with a sound drubbing, if she will
not be quiet.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS principles are also a blemish in any
polite composition, when they rise up to superstition,
and intrude themselves into every sentiment, however
remote from any connection with religion. 'Tis no
excuse for the poet, that the customs of his country
had burthened life with so many religious ceremonies
and observances, that no part of it was exempt from
that yoak. It must be for ever ridiculous in PE∣TRARCH
to compare his mistress, LAURA, to JESUS
CHRIST. Nor is it less ridiculous in that agreeable
libertine, BOCCACE, very seriously to give thanks to
God Almighty, and the ladies, for their assistance in
defending him against his enemies.</P>
