<HEAD>CHAPTER XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Ascent to the Glaciers.—Mountain-Prospects.—Hymn
written among the Alps.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a little village situated at the
foot of the Glaciers, and near the source
of the Rhine, we departed early the
next morning to scale the mountain that
led us to that mighty store-house of
winter. Our road lay along the side of
a torrent, part of which is applied to the
purpose of turning the mill belonging to
the hamlet, and watering the little en∣closures
around it. A path-way had been
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
formed by the people across the Glaciers,
in order to communicate with the in∣habitants
of the upper part of the valley
of Ragantz.</P>
<P>The mountain, like those we had just
left in the middle region, on the southern
side of St. Bernardin, produced a fine
short grass; and the peasants were spread∣ing
as we passed their scented harvest,
to the pleasant, but fleeting sun-beam,
eager to improve the precarious blessing,
and snatch the golden moments! Along
a fine amphitheatre of mountains, we
spied the inhabitants of the various cot∣tages
at this pastoral employment, hang∣ing
on the steeps like goats, to turn the
swath, and leaving us to wonder by what
ingenuity the grass was first mowed.
These <HI>chalets,</HI> or mountain cabins, are
fitted for the region where they are
placed, though of an order of architecture
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
of which Palladio gives no description.
They are in general built with the wood
of the pine, or the larch, but when not in
the neighbourhood of forests, are erected
with stone. To most of the chalets the
mountain itself affords one side ready con∣structed,
as they are usually placed in
such situations that when the avalanche
rolls from the top, it shall find no re∣sistance
from those habitations, shielded
by the friendly hill that rises abrupt be∣hind,
but passing harmless over the shel∣tered
dwelling, fling at a safe distance its
destructive mass.</P>
<P>In the last of these chalets we stopped
to repose ourselves, though we had halted
so often to botanize, as the hills abounded
in a rich variety of herbs and delicate
mountain-flowers, that we had hitherto
suffered little from the labor of the
ascent; but our ramble, together with the
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
morning breeze of the mountains, had
created no usual appetite; and we sat
down to a repast or dried fruits, and
coffee, before the door of the chalet, to
prepare us for the remainder of our enter∣prize.</P>
<P>The ascent to the Glaciers on the
opposite side of the valley appeared so
romantic, that we regretted for a mo∣ment
that we had not taken a route,
which seemed not only pleasanter, but
shorter; our mountain companions, how∣ever,
silenced our murmurs by assuring us
that every step we took, though appa∣rently
leading us further from the oppo∣site
mountain, would at length bring us
nearer. We had been so often deceived
in our ideas of distances in the Alps,
which it requires long usage and a moun∣tain-eye
to calculate accurately, that we
gave up our reason to the care of these
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
Grisons, persuaded that some mountain-miracle
would be wrought in our favor.</P>
<P>The latter part of our journey was ex∣treme
toil; at some distance from the
top, the mule which had hitherto carried
me was left tied to a rock, and our guides
supported me up the rugged steep; my
fellow travellers, who were furnished with
crampons, little machines buckled to the
feet, with points to enable the wearer to
keep his hold, purchased their security
by excessive fatigue from wearing them.</P>
<P>We were frequently overcome by the
extreme heat, as well as by the difficulty
of the path, and often stopped to cool our
fever at the torrent which we saw burst∣ing
above, from its icy source. No in∣convenience,
we were told, resulted from
taking this cooling draught; though far
from being convinced of the truth of this
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
assertion, we were glad to find an excuse
in the example of our Grison companions,
for quaffing this delicious beverage; and,
like our first parent, “when not deceiv'd,
but fondly overcome,” he tasted “of that
fair, enticing fruit,” so we, against our
better knowledge, scrupled not to drink
large libations of this tempting nectarious
water.</P>
<P>With an inexpressible sensation of
fatigue like the giddiness of delirium,
breathless, and burning with heat, we
threw ourselves, some time after mid-day,
on the grass, along the icy boundary,
from whose base rushed the torrent
whence we gathered the icicles that
again slackened our excessive thirst.
These feelings of parched heat were not
the effects of fatigue; we had taken as
violent exercise beneath the hot noon∣tide
rays in the Italian vallies, with less
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
feverish sensations than we now expe∣rienced
in those regions of winter. After
a slight interval of repose, however, we
found ourselves restored to that feeling of
serene, tranquil delight, for which the
philosophers who have written on the
theory of the Higher Alps, account, from
the purity of the atmosphere at that im∣mense
elevation; and which state of
soothing happiness Rousseau has described
with his usual eloquence, in a letter to
Julia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The general impression felt by those who scale the higher mountains, where the air is pure and subtile, is a greater easiness in breathing, more light∣ness in the body, and more serenity in the mind.—Meditation assumes, in those regions, something of a character great, and sublime, proportioned to the objects which strike us; something of tranquil rapture, remote from all that is selfish, or sensual. It seems as if, while raised above the haunts of men, we leave below all mean and earthly sentiments, and that, as we approach the etherial regions, the soul contracts some∣thing of their unchangeable purity. Upon the whole, this spectacle has something in it of magic and super∣natural, which overwhelms the mind and senses; we forget every thing, we forget ourselves, and have scarcely a consciousness of existence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15"/>
While my fellow travellers amused
themselves by wandering over that world
of ice, a difficult and dangerous enter∣prize,
I sat down on the border of the
Glacier, to enjoy the new and magnificent
vision around me. On the right, rocks
and mountains of ice, arose in dread
and sublime perspective; before me, St.
Bernardin lifted its barren and un∣covered
top; and nearly in the same di∣rection,
the eye wanders over a chain of
Glaciers which separates the valley of the
Rhine from the subject countries of the
Grisons, Bormeo, and the Valteline. These
were the Glaciers which, mid-way, we
regretted not having scaled, and which
our guides told us we should reach sooner
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
in the direction we had already taken.
So far as we might trust to the testimony
of our senses, they were not mistaken.
These Glaciers appeared to touch that on
which we were now placed; and it
seemed as if we had only to descend a
little from our present elevation, in order
to climb the savage and naked pyramids
of rocks which raised themselves up from
the far-spread desert of ice, like barren
islands from a troubled sea. We were,
however, separated from those objects by
a space of several miles, measured on the
ground; but the intervening gulph was
hid from our sight by the swell of the
mountains. On the left, the eye was
borne over the amphitheatre of hills,
green with pasturage, up to the ridge of
ice, stretching along its own sullen, and
perhaps incroaching boundary. The cattle
were cropping the herbage on the steep,
and the chamois bounding over the rocks,
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
for such the Grison-peasant told me
were a few playful animals I per∣ceived
at a great distance at the edge
of the Glacier, over which my fellow-travellers
were wandering. I employed
the hours of meditation in throwing to∣gether
the new images with which the
Alpine scenery had filled my mind,
into the form of an hymn, to the au∣thor
of nature; and no spot can surely
be more congenial to devotional feel∣ings,
than that theatre where the divi∣nity
has displayed the most stupendous
of his earthly works.</P>
<P>The lengthening shadow of the icy-wall
at the foot of which I was sit∣ting,
drew me from my meditations,
and I began to be seriously alarmed at
the absence of my friends. The oppo∣site
Glaciers were now lighted up with
that glowing rose-coloured hue, with
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
which they are tinged at parting day.
I gazed with rapture on this glorious
vision, which I had before seen at an
immense distance, and with feeble im∣pressions
compared to the enthusiastic,
the solemn emotion I now experienced.
The clouds were rolling high above
the valley, but remotely beneath the
spot where I stood, in gorgeously co∣loured
billows, as their upper surfaces
were tinged by the last rays of the
sun.</P>
<P>While I was contemplating these ma∣jestic
images, my fellow-travellers hailed
us from a distant part of the moun∣tain,
to which they had descended
from the Glacier. There was no time
left to listen to their
<Q><L>“Travels history,</L>
<L>Of Anters vast, and deserts idle,</L>
<L>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills, whose heads touch
heaven,”</L></Q>
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
all which I should have been very
seriously inclined to hear, if our guides
had not reminded us, that though the
tops of the mountains where we stood
were still rejoicing in the light of day,
darkness already brooded over the face
of the vallies.</P>
<P>The vapours gathered thicker as the
evening advanced; and from the brow
of the first slope where we descended,
we paused a moment to snatch a nearer
view of the tumultuous swelling tide
of clouds into which we were about
to plunge, rolling in silent but awful
discordance along the valley, between
the majestic streights of the Glaciers.</P>
<P>We had scarcely gained the spot
where we left our mule, before the
sun had taken his last leave of the
pointed rocks on the opposite Glacier,
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
and night seemed rising from the valley.
We found the bridle in the place where
we had tied it to the rock, but the
mule, in whose reputation for patience
we had placed too much confidence,
or who had formed a better judgment
of the fit hour of retreat than our∣selves,
had withdrawn his head, and ab∣sconded.
I had rather been borne,
than supported to this spot, between two
of our guides; a mode of conveyance
which was both disagreeable and incon∣venient.
To walk down to the valley
was for me impossible, to look for the
mule along the mountains would have
been a vain attempt, and to have sought
another from below, would have de∣layed
our return 'till midnight. In this
perplexity, one of our Grison-guides,
who had rambled a few paces in search
of the animal, returned with his arms
full of shrubs, which he placed in two
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
leathern girdles fastened to the long
poles that are the walking sticks of the
Glaciers, and tied them together, so as
to form a sort of chair, or litter; on
this I placed myself, not without some
apprehension, but was carried in perfect
safety down to the cottage where we
had breakfasted in the morning, and
where we found our mule, who had
been caught marching homewards early
in the evening, and detained by the
cottagers till our return.</P>
<P>The hours till midnight were filled
up by my fellow-travellers, with ac∣counts
of their wonderful visions. I
made a number of notes of what I
had myself seen, and heard of the
Glaciers; but after reading the glowing
description given of those stupendous
phoenomena, by Mr. Ramond, in his
elegant translation of Mr. Coxe's first
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
edition of his travels, I determined, in∣stead
of presumptuously intruding my
own imperfect observations, or intelli∣gence,
to seize this occasion of intro∣ducing
that finished essay to the Eng∣lish
reader<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For Mr. Ramond's observations on the Glaciers, and Glacieres, see the Appendix.</NOTE>. Leaving to this charming
writer the task of philosophical discus∣sion,
I shall here transcribe the hymn I
composed on those Alpine summits;
conscious how feebly it paints their
sublime imagery, and persuaded no
pen can define those sensations which
are felt by the lover of nature, who
wanders amidst those regions of stupen∣dous
greatness, and feels, mingled with
the thrill of astonishment, the trans∣port
of adoration.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Source of the Rhine.—Valley of the Rhine.—Splugen.—
Valley of Schams.—Via Mala.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we bid adieu to the Alpine
regions, we went up the valley to visit
the spot from whence the Rhine draws its
first and principal source, at the foot of
the Glacier which we had visited the
preceding day, but some miles nearer the
mass of mountains of which that Glacier
is a branch. There are three sources to
this celebrated river; one, called the
Lower Rhine, rises from that part of the
mountain of St. Gothard which stretches
behind the valley of Urscren, and flows
along the Grison valley of Tavelsch: the
middle source springs from the western
extremity of the Glacier of the Vogels∣berg,
and flowing through the valley of
Medels, joins the former, at the distance
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
of some leagues, near the Abbey of
Disentis; the Higher Rhine, which is
said to have been the only branch known
to the Antients, proceeding from the mass
of mountains formerly called the Adula,
runs from the eastern extremity of the
Vogelsberg, or Bird-mountain, below the
point called the Moschelhorn; and there,
it is said, was built a temple consecrated
to the guardian god of the stream, whose
tranquil slumbers Boileau describes in one
of his epistles:
<Q><L>“Au pièd du Mont Adule, entre mille roseaux,</L>
<L>Le Rhin, tranquille et fier du progrès de ses eaux,</L>
<L>Appuyé d'une main sur son urne penchante,</L>
<L>Dormoit au bruit de son onde naïssante.”</L></Q></P>
<P>Whether Boileau took part of his de∣scription
from the statue of this river-god
in the Tuilleries, or, what is more pro∣bable,
the Sculptor borrowed the idea of
his statue from the Poet, the place itself is
not unworthy of the divinity.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="29"/>
We were now at the source of that
river whose gentle current had heretofore
glided from its tranquil and solitary
abode, to witness the scenes of carnage
with which the ambition of monarchs has
so often crimsoned its waters, but which
then heard the songs of republican
triumph, resounding along its distant
banks. Happily these banks re-echo no
longer the din of war, or the shout of
victory; the thunder of the confederated
powers on the continent of Europe,
against the liberties of France, is hushed;
and the fate of this confederacy, like
that of Roman greatness, so elegantly de∣scribed
by Montesquieu, may be com∣pared
to the course of this river, which,
swollen by auxiliary streams to a tre∣mendous
flood, sinks at length, a sedgy
rivulet, into the boundless ocean.—Alas!
so long has the iron storm of war raged
around us, that the ear is become fa∣miliarized
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
to its sounds, and the heart is
grown callous to its desolation! While
the rest of Europe is safely sheltered from
its fury, why are two nations, formed for
mutual esteem and admiration, still fated
to brave its horrors, and remain the only
votaries at its unhallowed shrine? Ah,
when will Peace, with all her meek-eyed
beamy train, with all her blessed attri∣butes,
re-visit the earth, and begin, once
more, her holy, her universal empire!</P>
<P>The valley of the Rhine, which is ten
miles in length, from the foot of St. Ber∣nardin
to Splugen, is too lofty for any
other cultivation than that of pasturage;
on one side, the rocks hung over the river
clothed with woods; on the other, the
hills rose in successive lawns to the
Glaciers; and no scenes amidst the moun∣tains
we had traversed had presented a
series of objects more mildly picturesque.
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
At Splugen this character of soft and
placid beauty changes again to the wild
and the majestic. This town is the prin∣cipal
depôt of merchandize that passes
from Germany, and the Grisons, into
Italy; and is the place where the roads
divide that lead to the Valteline, and the
Swiss Italian Bailliwicks.</P>
<P>At a little distance from Splugen, the
piny forests which cover the mountains
along the shadowy way, and climb up
the lofty steeps, dark, wild, and impene∣trable,
are half-leafless, and withered on
the highest peaks; as if vegetation had
been worsted in struggling with nature
for existence. Here the Rhine, which
had hitherto rolled sometimes a placid,
and always an even current, begins first
to display its bold and daring character;
its waters now fall in one broad expanse
over the ledge of rocks that cross the
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
stream, down into the gulph; then, re∣bounding
from the abyss, glide swift as
light through the streights of granite that
open to admit their passage, or, where
the rocks oppose their way, lift high
their feathery surges, of which the great
mass fall foaming into the depths be∣neath,
and the rest are lost in air.</P>
<P>As we descended the mountains into
the valley of Schams, the savage per∣spective
of the forests softened into grace∣ful
scenery. Trees of milder climes di∣versify
the prospect, among which the
mountain-ash reddens the rocks, over
which it throws its beautiful clusters of
berries in lavish profusion. The valley of
Schams, along which the Rhine winds,
a slow and gentle stream, amidst a num∣ber
of scattered villages and hamlets,
abodes of tranquil existence, presents a
soft reposing landscape, peculiarly sooth∣ing
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
to the traveller, among the Alps, and
which unfolds itself from the midway of
a solitary mountain, with its wild ac∣companyment
of the dashing torrent.</P>
<P>At one of those villages where we
passed a day, we considered ourselves as
fortunate in finding a person by whom
we were understood; since the language
of this country is not Italian, like that of
the Valley of the Rhine, but a composition
of all the languages under heaven; as if
the emigrants from the tower of Babel had
formed their chief colony in this pleasant
spot, and in process of time had amal∣gamated
the confusion of tongues into
the jargon called the Romansh. In this
wild and uncouth assemblage of words,
several books are written; among which
we found, in the library of the good old
landlady of a village-inn, an huge silver-clasped,
and strongly brass-bound Bible,
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
printed in this dialect, and dedicated to
George the First. We were also shewn a
volume of hymns, some of which were
translated to me, and were not unpleasing
specimens of mountain-poetry, applied to
Alpine images and objects; chiefly those
of the vegetable, and flowery world, such
as the mountain-ash, the myrtle, the
harebell, and the sheltering pine.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this valley, and of
that of the Rhine, are Protestants. In
the middle of the fifteenth century they
were under the dominions of Nobles, and
Bishops, of whom they purchased their
freedom, and have since made a part of
the Grison government.</P>
<P>In this valley we were nearly on a
level with the rest of the world; but in
order to escape entirely from this wilder∣ness
of Alps, we had another mountain
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
expedition to make, which, if we had
judged from the name it bears, was more
perilous than all the past. Why the in∣habitants
of this country have given the
name of Via Mala to the best road among
the mountains of Switzerland, it is some∣what
difficult to conjecture; perhaps in∣deed
it might once have deserved this
epithet, and, like other bad reputations, is
still suspected, though its character is re∣formed.
We believed that we had al∣ready,
during our Alpine journey, ex∣hausted
every possible aspect of mountain
scenery, and that what remained, how∣ever
pregnant with the varying images of
beauty, or the rugged forms of horror,
could offer only the repetition of pre∣ceding
wonders; we found, however, as
we journeyed along the Via Mala, new
reasons to pause, and new objects to
admire.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="36"/>
After crossing the Rhine, which we
rejoined at our entrance on this road, we
lost at once all view of the fair and ample
valley, and found ourselves immured be∣tween
pine-covered rocks of enormous
height, while, in proportion to their per∣pendicular
and stupendous elevation, the
river descends into gulphs equally pro∣found.
Between these tremendous pre∣cipices
an excellent road is formed along
the side of the mountain, which we
passed in such perfect security as left us
full leisure to contemplate those mighty
cliffs above,
<Q><L>—“Whose highest woods, impenetrable</L>
<L>To star, or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad</L>
<L>And brown as evening;”</L></Q>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL>
while we listened to the roarings of the
ingulphed waters rising troublous from
the chasm in which the river had made
its channel. After proceeding two or
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
three miles along these precipices, we
caught a glimpse of a bridge which hung
light in air over the abyss, and seemed
more to deserve the reputation of having
been reared by supernatural agency than
any on which we had yet gazed.</P>
<P>We paused a considerable time on this
bridge, that we might fix the scene in
our remembrance; on that side of the
mountain along which the road we had
passed was suspended, rose a majestic
swell of pine-covered steeps; on the side
where we now crossed, the rock stood
abruptly perpendicular, leaving just space
enough for the passage, part of which
was excavated from the cliff that im∣pended
beyond our darkened path, over
the gulph. The Rhine, which had
hitherto rolled its ample volume, in∣creased
by torrents, and by the six rivers
from which the valley it had left takes
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
its Roman name, now shrunk on the eye
from the distance at which we gazed,
into a small rivulet, labouring at the
depth of many hundred feet beneath the
bridge, foaming dark between the narrow
clefts, sometimes struggling with the
rocks for day, and sometimes entirely hid
by their foldings from our view.</P>
<P>After passing some hours of contempla∣tion
amidst these scenes, where luxuriant
vegetation spreads her flowing veil over
the stern brow of terrific wildness, we
bade adieu to the withdrawing Rhine,
which, after mounting a hill that brought
us to a village on its summit, we again
beheld in the distance, transformed into a
placid expansive river. Descending into
the valley, we reached Tusis, the capital
of one of the high jurisdictions of the
Grison-League. This town, according to
the etymologists, was originally Tuscan,
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
which they prove in a very satisfactory
manner, from the name Tusis, Tusan,
with fifty more derivations, till they
arrive at Tuscana.</P>
<P>The road from Tusis to Coire lies along
a finely cultivated plain, with a soft
boundary of sloping hills, clothed with
fresh verdure, and woods of thick foliage,
and scattered over with villages, and
country seats; the Rhine glides tran∣quilly
along the valley, and far above its
pastoral banks, Glaciers, mingling with
clouds, form a distant horizon. There
was something deliciously soothing in
this still, quiet landscape, contrasted with
the savage chaos of Alpine scenery; it
was like reading Thompson's Autumn, or
Gray's Elegy, after Milton's battle of the
Angels.</P>
<P>We passed the beautiful and picturesque
mountain of Heigenberg, which stretches
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
six miles along the plain, is well peopled
with villages, and esteemed the most fer∣tile
spot in the Grison dominions.</P>
<P>At Rechinau, the residence of the Im∣perial
Envoy to the Grisons, the two
streams of the Rhine form their junction;
and they could not have chosen through∣out
the country a spot more delightful
for the friendly meeting that was now to
last the remainder of their course. The
principal branch was that which we had
accompanied from its spring; the other
flows along the valley of Sopra Silvas, or
the valley above the woods, which is the
most populous part of the Grison-League,
of which Flantz is the principal town,
and the place where the General Diet
of the three Leagues assembles every
three years. This valley is divided from
the Canton of Glarus by high mountains
and Glaciers, which form, as usual, a
magnificent back-ground to the pastoral
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
country beneath, and is separated at its
close, by a part of St. Gothard, from the
valley of Urscren. Over the two branches
of the Rhine, just above the confluence
of their streams, two bridges are built on
the same plan as that of Schaffhausen.
These bridges, we were told, are much
admired for their architecture, and what
is termed a sublime simplicity of con∣struction;
they may perhaps deserve
praise on account of their stability; but
surely nothing can be more offensive to
the eye than those huge masses, covered
with wood, heavy, and mishapen from
without; dismal, and dark within; such,
in my ignorance of mechanics, ap∣peared
to me those bridges which are
erected over the rivers of Switzerland in
the flat country; and the only archi∣tecture
of that kind which I thought ad∣mirable,
were the performances of the
Devil over the abysses of St. Gothard,
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
and the tremendous chasms of the Via
Mala.</P>
<P>The Rhine at its confluence, becomes
an important river, and flows through the
valley with calm majestic pace, under
rocks and wooded hills, which in other
countries would be respectable mountains,
but which shrink into insignificance be∣fore
the eye that has long been fixed on
the gigantic Alps. We passed some miles
through a piny forest, and at length, from
the pastoral valley of Rechinau, beheld
the antique towers of Coire, rising ma∣jestically
from the deep bosom of en∣circling
mountains.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Coire.—Sketch of Government in the Grisons.—Revolt
of the Valteline.—Reunion to the Cisalpine Republic.</HEAD>
<P>THE national convention of the Grisons
had suspended their sittings two or three
weeks before our arrival at Coire. As
revolutions were abroad in the earth, it
was not extraordinary that some efforts
were made to reform an oppressive go∣vernment,
when the means being com∣pletely
in the power of the oppressed,
the execution was neither difficult or
dangerous. The changes that had taken
place, however, we were informed by
some persons at Coire, did not merit
the name of a revolution; that what
had passed was little more than a strug∣gle
for power, and that the only ser∣vice
rendered to the country, was the
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
correction of a few avaricious indivi∣duals
of credit and influence, by sines
and forfeits, without any reformation of
the principles on which they had acted,
and in which it was probable they would
be imitated by their successors.</P>
<P>The government of this country is
democratic, that is a Swiss democracy,
where, under the name of liberty, the
greatest outrages are committed against
the principle. How, or when the Grisons
first shook off the yoke of their former
governors, is not well known; but the
union of the three leagues, of which
the Grison government is composed, took
place in the beginning of the sixteenth
century. The point of contact between
the thousand and one republics of this
country, for every community is a se∣parate
state, and has a different form of
government, is a general diet of their
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
chiefs, held once a year in the capital
of one of the three leagues; which diet
is formed of sixty-three deputies, sent
from the various communities in propor∣tion
to their extent or influence.</P>
<P>A disjointed government like this, must
necessarily be subject to the influence of
political intrigue. The deputy named to
the diet by a sovereign peasant of four∣teen
years of age, or in the direct and
unqualified manner in which he is
elected by the sovereign fathers, is most
commonly either a noisy intriguer,
whose pretentions have abashed the
man of modest merit, or what is more
likely to happen, the wealthy Lord who
has corrupted his constituents; bribing
being a practice universally admitted
amongst the rights of the people in
Swiss democracies.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="46"/>
Thus by intrigue and corruption these
democracies become not aristocracies,
composed of citizens skilled in legisla∣tion,
and endowed with principles that
tend to the amelioration of society,
but oligarchies framed of individuals
who consider the rights of the people
as their own privileges, and who en∣courage
those vices in the community
by which they increase their revenues,
instead of checking them by wise re∣gulations,
and salutary laws.</P>
<P>These evils would probably have been
longer borne without remonstrance, had
not the imprudent excess of avarice in
the governors at length awakened the
resentment of the plundered. In former
times, the cupidity of the magistrate
had been checked by the fear of the
summary punishment of the Strafgericht,
a kind of star-chamber, where not only
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
the guilt of the rich man was sure
to meet with expiation, but where even
wealthy innocence was insecure; since
the Radamanthus of this inexorable tri∣bunal
were sharers in the arbitrary pe∣nalties
they imposed.</P>
<P>The ascendency of the opulent citi∣zens
in the affairs of government has
long since brought this tribunal into
disuse. It was, indeed, often made the
instrument of private hatred, and fac∣tious
vengeance; but as it was also a
terror to evil doers, answered some
of the purposes for which it was in∣tended.
Since its abolition, says a wri∣ter
on this subject, “the chiefs make
treaties with foreign powers without the
consent of their constituents, and sell
justice by auction, and ruin those whom
they suspect to have interests hostile
to their own.” This accusation was
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
made against the fathers of the last ge∣neration,
and it is to be lamented, that
their sons not having the fear of the
star-chamber before their eyes, or the
love of any thing but money in their
hearts, have left this fatal propensity to
their children, the Grison governors of
the present day.</P>
<P>Over this community ignorance holds
its leaden sceptre, not the ignorance of
simplicity, arising from the want of
communication with the world, but
from a state of social degradation. In
vain some Eurylochus, who had escaped
the contagion, endeavoured to reclaim
his countrymen by introducing amongst
them those arts which soften our man∣ners,
and exalt our nature, instituting
a college for the instruction of youth
at a considerable expence; the gene∣rous
attempt failed, after a trial of
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
some years, and the day of reformation
and knowledge was deferred to a more
convenient season. In the mean time,
the places of authority are bestowed on
the highest bidder; the judges divide
amongst them the monies extorted from
the tortured prisoner; in some districts
the trials of criminals are days of festi∣vals
to the judges, at the expence of
the wretches they condemn; and crimes
over which a regard to public morals
should throw a veil, are made to
flaunt in the face of day, in order that
the number of convicts may swell the
purse of the tribunal.</P>
<P>The moral and political vices of these
democracies can furnish no arguments
against governments founded on the
rights of the people; since the abuse of
principles can never destroy the force
of the principle itself. It would be
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
inconclusive reasoning to assert that be∣cause
the <HI>democracies</HI> of Uri and the
Grisons are despotic, and corrupt, the
<HI>representative</HI> government of France, or
any other <HI>representative</HI> government, must
necessarily be infected with similar vices.
We might with the same truth assert,
that because the republics of Greece
and Rome, but half known to freedom,
were sometimes disturbed by faction,
liberty was therefore not made for man;
although, perhaps, ignorant of its true
principles, one of these republics sub∣dued
the world by its valour, and the
other dignified it with all that is great
in literature, and the arts.</P>
<P>Like the democracies, and other free
states of Switzerland, the democracy of
the Grisons had its ultramontane terri∣tories,
and its subjects, its proconsuls,
conquered provinces, tributes, homages,
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
and other distinguished marks of abso∣lute
sovereignty.</P>
<P>The Valteline, comprehending the pro∣vinces
of Bormio, and Chiavenna, now
forming part of the Cisalpine republic,
were, at the time of our visit to the
Grisons, a dependency of that govern∣ment.
The country of the Valteline is
separated from the Grisons on the north,
and from the states of Venice on the
east, and the south, by Alpine moun∣tains
and Glaciers, and is open on the
west to the plains of Milan; from which
government it was dismembered in the
beginning of the sixteenth century, when
the Grisons and the bishop of Coire,
the last of whom had pretentions in
right of some frivolous donation, and
the former reposing their pretentions on
those of their bishop, drove out the
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
French, and became the legitimate pos∣sessors.</P>
<P>The history of this country is little
more than a display of the worst pas∣sions
of mankind. The bishop was dis∣possessed
of his share of the sovereignty
soon after the conquest. In the begin∣ning
of the seventeenth century, the in∣habitants
stung to madness by the terri∣ble
oppression of their masters, who
attempted amongst other acts of ty∣ranny,
to introduce by force the re∣formation
which they had themselves
embraced, committed a general massacre
of such of their oppressors as were in
their power, threw off their yoke, and
placed themselves under the protection
of the king of Spain.</P>
<P>By the aid of the Swiss protestant
Cantons, and of France, during the ad∣ministration
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
of Richlieu, the Grisons
became again masters of these provinces,
but with powers more limited. Discon∣tented
at the privileges granted to their
subjects by the stipulations which they
were compelled to make with the French,
and which they considered as deroga∣tory
to their sovereign dignity, the
Grisons sought the aid of their former
enemies, the Spaniards, who not only
assisted them in expelling the French
from the Valteline, but delivered up
this unfortunate people whom they had
some years before taken under their
protection, after having excited them to
revolt, into the hands of their ancient
oppressors, under whose dominion they
have remained till the late epocha of
their history.</P>
<P>All that is vicious in the principle
of Swiss ultramontane government, was
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
reduced to rigorous practice by the
Grisons in the Valteline. The wretched
inhabitants were not only robbed with
impunity by codestas and bailiffs, who
had previously purchased the right of
plunder from their co-sovereigns the
Grisons, from whom collectively they
held their authority; but the history
of the shameless manner in which that
power was administered, is too disgust∣ing
for detail.</P>
<P>Although the inhabitants of the Valte∣line
have been compelled to submit by
force to this coarse tyranny, their spirit
has never been subdued. The indig∣nation
which has led them at the pre∣sent
moment to shake off the yoke
of their tyrants, they have inherited
in long succession from their fore-fathers,
of whose contempt of the Grisons the
Duke of Rohan treats in his Memoires
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
on the Valteline war; where, though
an ally of these democracies, he as∣serts,
that “their deplorable corruption
is become an incurable evil, proceeding
from the nature of the people who
have raked together all the vices of
Europe without collecting a single vir∣tue.”</P>
<P>The day of deliverance for these op∣pressed
subjects of the Grison democra∣cies
was, however, drawing nigh. The
shouts of liberty that filled the plains
of Lombardy, re-echoed amidst their
rocks, and roused into a noble and ge∣nerous
flame the smothered indignation
which power had so long compressed.
Placed near the spot where waved the
banners of the French Republic, the
Valtelines were not again compelled
to break their chains on the heads of
their oppressors, or seek refuge from their
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
slavery as heretofore, in the arms of
despotism. The will to be free was now
become the only price of freedom;
and the security of their independence
no more reposes on the caprice of
princes, who might again betray them,
as they have already been betrayed,
but is founded on those great and eter∣nal
principles, the imprescriptible rights
of mankind, which no sophistry can
controvert, and which no power can
destroy.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Grison Mode of negociating.—Deputation to Buonaparte.—Buonaparte.</HEAD>
<P>THE late insurrection of these pro∣vinces,
was not an ordinary revolt
such as had been often excited in these
subject States, and which the power of
the sovereign aided by that of the Can∣tons
always confederated to crush re∣bellions,
had till now been able to
subdue. The presence of French armies,
and the establishment of a new republic
in the neighbourhood, were circumstances
that wore so formidable an aspect, that
an alliance of the Cantons in the pre∣sent
instance was judged inexpedi∣ent,
and the Grisons were left to ar∣range
their own concerns with their re∣volted
subjects. The Grisons were not
inclined to try the fate of arms, but
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
satisfied themselves with requesting the
mediation of the French Republic to
bring back their rebellious children to
their duty. This mediation was accepted
by the revolted provinces, and it was
agreed that deputations should be sent
by both parties to Milan, where the
French General should hear and decide
between them. The subjects sent their
deputies immediately, and frequent mes∣sages
were dispatched to the Grisons, to
request the presence also of their am∣bassador.
Some time elapsed, and no
ambassador appearing, the French Gene∣ral
by means of the envoy of the
Republic at Coire, who had often urged
the Grisons to fulfil the engagement
they had made of accepting this me∣diation,
informed them that the fatal
term was fixed at a month from the
dispatch of the message. The Grisons
continued to keep a profound silence,
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
no answer was returned, and no depu∣ties
were sent. The French General
therefore undertook, with the help of
the Cisalpine Republic, to settle the bu∣siness
without their interposition; and
after recapitulating the causes of the
discontent of the governed, and the re∣fusal
of the governors to abide by their
own engagements, after decreeing that
“no people can be the subjects of
another people, without violating the
principles of public and natural right,
and that the provinces were dissolved
from every kind of allegiance, declared
the people of the Valteline, Chiavenna,
and Bormio, a free and independent
nation, and accepted the re-union which
they solicited to the Cisalpine Repub∣lic.”</P>
<P>The Grison governors, when they saw
of how little avail had been their dig∣nified
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
silence, began to reproach each
other bitterly for their conduct. The
people themselves gave louder tokens of
their discontent. Deputies from various
communes hastened to Coire, and de∣manded
the convocation of a general
diet, the dismission of the Congress,
the renewal of their friendship with
France, and the admission of the Valte∣line
to a part of their sovereignty.
These demands were submitted by the
Congress to all the communes of the
three leagues; their deputies assembled,
and after having deposed and arrested
the three chiefs, and the whole of the
members of the silent congress, and
appointed a commission of thirty to
reform abuses and complete the re∣volution,
decreed that ambassadors should
be sent to demand a revision of the sen∣tence
passed against them, to offer ex∣cuses
for the want of respect in their
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
government, and to give every kind of
satisfaction to Buonaparte.</P>
<P>Buonaparte!—the reflecting mind when
it looks back through past ages, sighs
with regret while it discerns how enor∣mous
is the list of the destroyers of their
race, which history presents under the
name of heroes; and how small the
proportional number of divine original,
who have blessed or amended mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>And all of God who bless mankind, or mend.”</P>
<P>POPE.</P></NOTE>.
Surely from some strange delusion in
our nature does it arise, that the strongest
passions which have agitated the human
breast are those of loose and frantic
ambition, delighted in making the world
groan under its chains; or of profligate
glory, quenching its insatiate thirst at
the torrent of tears which it forces hu∣manity
to shed. The lessons of temper∣ance
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
with which sfages have interposed
to calm the fury, or moderate the rage
of the conqueror, have sunk under the
genius of the poet; who, with confede∣rated
frenzy, has goaded on to new crimes,
by stringing to his immortal lyre the
praises of heroes who were past, and
extolling with frantic rapture those bril∣liant
actions which shrink from the test
of moral scrutiny.</P>
<P>Happily a new aera opens to the world;
the maddening charm of the poet is at
length dissolved by the mild wand of
philosophy, and the heroes meed arises
from other exploits than those of mul∣titudes
destroyed, and provinces desolated.
It is not Buonaparte scaling the Alps,
and chasing the imperial eagle back to
its haunts, after tearing from its beak
its choicest prey, that claims the trans∣port
of admiration; his acts of valour
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
may have been unequalled; the heroes
of ancient and modern times may sink
before him; “his penetrating mind,” to
use the animated language of the states∣man,
“may master fortune and enchain
futurity; his commanding genius may
be unrivalled as his courage;” but these
are not his loftiest honours; these are
not his proudest claims to glory; what
swells the heart with reverence, is not
the hero standing in the breach, it is
the benefactor of his race converting the
destructive lightening of the conqueror's
sword into the benignant rays of free∣dom,
and presenting to vanquished na∣tions

Phaenomena.</HEAD>
<P>THE road from Coire lies along the
banks of the Rhine, through an ample
valley, bounded by mountains which still
retain some features of the savage Alpine
character. The landscape softened its
rugged brow as we advanced through
pastoral meadows to Mayenfield, which
we went out of our road to visit. This
town is the boundary of the Grison
government, and, from some peculiarity
in the original contract of union, is at
once subject to the Grison league, and
co-sovereign. Returning back towards
Coire, we crossed a bridge over the
Rhine, and followed the road leading to
Ragatz, and the baths of Pffyffer. These
baths are resorted to by the sick, for the
cure of various maladies; and to the
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
lovers of nature in her most romantic
garb, no residence can be more delightful
than the habitation which is built for the
reception of visitors. The water is con∣ducted
to this dwelling by pipes; the
place where it takes its source, and where
with great inconvenience, and even dan∣ger,
the sick were formerly compelled to
descend, being now visited only by those
who are curious to see a gulph which
conveys an image of the more tremendous
abysses of the Alps.</P>
<P>The Abbey of Pffyffer is situated on
the hill rising from the Rhine, and com∣mands
a magnificent view over the
country beneath. The Abbot is Prince of
the Empire, and Seigneur, not only of
the baths, which are greatly indebted to
his munisicence and that of his prede∣cessors,
but also of all the country around.
The Abbey is of the order of St. Benedict,
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
and dates its origin from the eighth
century.</P>
<P>From Ragatz we journied on to Sar∣gans,
a Bailliwick belonging to the eight
original Cantons, who each in their turn
send a Bailiff, whose office lasts two years.
The town is situated on a gentle ascent,
beneath the lofty Schalberb, which forms
a chain of the mountains of Appenzell.
The castle, which was the constant re∣sidence
of the Counts of Sargans, is seated
on a rock that overlooks the town, and
presents a picturesque appearance from
the road. The inhabitants are of the
mixt religion, and have some sort of pri∣vilege
in the election of their magistrates
under the inspection of the Bailiff.</P>
<P>The town of Wallenstadt, subject to
the eight Cantons, and comprehended in
the Bailliwick of Sargans, is situated at
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
the head of the lake which bears its
name, and is one of the principal depôts
of merchandize passing between the Gri∣sons
and Switzerland. As almost the
whole of this region is subject-country,
there is little diversity in their forms of
government: some have more privileges
than others; but all are subject to the
sovereign will of the free Cantons, and
of the Bailiffs, their legitimate repre∣sentatives.</P>
<P>The weather was remarkably fine when
we arrived at Wallenstadt, although the
rain which had fallen during the night,
had spread over the mountains a thin
covering of snow. We concluded that in
two or three hours we should be trans∣ported
down the lake to Wesen, as we
came in time to take advantage of the
easterly wind which we were told blows
in that direction the first half of the
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
day. The morning of our arrival was,
however, an exception to the general
rule, and the wind blew obstinately from
the west. The boatmen seemed dis∣inclined
to venture; and the master of
the inn supporting their representations,
we discontinued our instances; and, fear∣ing
the wind might remain in the same
humour the next day, and the day after,
determined to render ourselves independ∣ent
of its caprice, by travelling along the
southern side of the lake, and over the
<HI>mountain,</HI> to Glaris.</P>
<P>The road, we were assured, was very
practicable; and such it might be deemed
by the inhabitants of those wild regions,
and by ourselves indeed, accustomed as
we now were to difficult enterprizes in
travelling; but as the common mode of
transport is by water, no attention was
paid to keep it in repair. In some places
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
we were obliged to descend into the
lake, in others to climb over rocks, trust∣ing
to the prudence and skill of our
horses, rather than to our own judgment.
But the dangers of the way were often
forgotten in admiration of the scene
through which it led.</P>
<P>On the southern side of the lake along
which we journied, the swelling hills are
covered with fine pasturage, and ro∣mantic
woods, interspersed with hamlets
and cottages up to the lofty snow-covered
steeps that form the mountains of Glaris.
Over the lake on the northern side, the
Glattewand reared its perpendicular head
near two thousand feet from the water,
and presenting along its edge a terrific
prolongation of inaccessible rampart, far
as the Ammon, from whose still loftier
summit the Ammenback rolls, in majestic
cataracts, its ample volume, whose sweep∣ing
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
grandeur and resounding roar, though
softened in their effect by the distance,
fixed us long to the spot from whence we
gazed.</P>
<P>After a ride of some hours, we quitted
the lake, and began to ascend the moun∣tains
of Kerenzen. Here the path became
still more dangerous, sometimes leading
us to the very edge of the precipice,
which hung over the distant mass of
waters, far beneath, and sometimes being
so perpendicularly steep, that we owed
our safety entirely to the goat-like habits
of climbing which our horses had ac∣quired
in their travels over the Alps.</P>
<P>The Swiss mountains seldom furnish
objects of perspective; but the prospect
from Kerenzen left us no regrets for the
westerly wind, or the difficulties of the
journey. We had now ascended the
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
mountains of Glaris; the views we had
hitherto enjoyed unfolded themselves in
more ample extent; and the enormous
ridge of rock on the northern side of the
lake, fell beneath our eyes, and seemed
only to skirt the waters. In the back∣ground
of the heights on which we stood,
the eye ranged over craggy peaks and
summits, far as the immensely distant
Alps and Glaciers of the Tyrol. Their
snows were tinged with the purple light
of the last beams of the sun, which, en∣circled
by a glorious canopy of clouds,
was descending on the lake of Zurich,
that lay before us in long perspective,
blazing like the orb which lent its lustre;
and when viewed through the telescope,
presenting its ruffled waters, and the
vessels gliding on their surface, like the
tremulations on the disk of that luminary,
and the spots within its circle.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="73"/>
We had loitered high up the moun∣tain,
led on by the majestic scenery both
of heaven and of earth, when we were in∣formed
by the knot of peasants who had
assembled around us from the little huts
in the neighbourhood, and had been
amusing themselves also in peeping oc∣casionally
through our glasses, that the
storm was rising from the lake, and might
reach us before we descended to the vil∣lage
where we had left our horses. We
could perceive no appearance of this
threatened tempest; but soon after we
heard the thunder rolling along the op∣posite
cliffs, and found that the moun∣taineers
were endowed with clearer per∣ceptions
of discovery than ourselves. We
had not proceeded far before our own
mountains became the seat of uproar, and
fantastic tortuous threads of lightning
twisted themselves around us, and flashed
before our eyes in forms of endless va∣riety.
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
The peasants having assured me
that those vivid lightnings played harm∣less
in that region, we descended still
further, and had taken leave of our
guides, as we were now within reach of
the village, when we stopped to gaze on
another phaenomenon, no less remarkable
than the former. This was the slow ap∣proach
of the genius of the storm, in his
habitation of pitchy darkness, and which
appeared as if one of the adjoining moun∣tains
was on its march. This immense,
and apparently ponderous body of clouds,
moved onwards to a spot not far distant
from us, before we could well appreciate
its substance; when the moon rising be∣hind
us suddenly, threw her bright beams
on the vaporous mass, and presented to
our gaze a perfect rainbow, chastened in
its colours by the soft reflection of lunar
light. This mountain of clouds remained
fixed in its station, from the dying away
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
of the breeze by which it had been im∣pelled,
till at length it sunk into air, and
no longer chained us to the spot by the
strong attraction of a new and sublime
image of nature.</P>

<P>THE next morning we crossed the
Walenberg, and descended into the valley
of Glaris, through forests of pine, and
pasturages, sprinkled over with cattle, the
road offering at every step rich prospects
of the lake of Zurich, and the country
rising from its banks. In the opening
of this valley are seated two or three
pleasant villages, of which Nefels is cele∣brated
for the victory gained over the
Austrian army, at the close of the four∣teenth
century, when about four hundred
men, by a Sampson-like manoeuvre, de∣feated
a numerous host, by rolling stones
from the mountains, and crushing the in∣vaders,
who were entangled in the ravins
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
beneath.—The town of Glaris is neatly
built, and the principal street is orna∣mented
with fountains. This indeed is a
decoration that belongs to most of the
towns of Switzerland; the streets are
usually purified, and enlivened by limpid
currents, which flow along their sides;
and the highest roads are often cheered
with the same lavish gift of nature. I
observed that wherever I wandered in
Switzerland, on mountain, or in valley, I
never ceased to hear the sound of waters;
the rill, the brook, the lake, the torrent,
the cascade, in all their rich variety of
tones, sometimes soft, sometimes loud,
strike successively upon the soul, or fill
up one mighty harmony. The appear∣ance
of Glaris, buried between lofty and
almost perpendicular mountains, which
were covered from the storm of the pre∣ceding
evening with a layer of snow, is
picturesque and romantic; but the city is
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
placed in the most inconvenient part of
the valley.</P>
<P>We ascended no further than Glaris,
and were therefore deprived of the grati∣fication
of seeing those parts of the Can∣ton
which are esteemed the most beauti∣ful
and interesting. Mr. Ramond ob∣serves,
that this country, secured by im∣pregnable
mountains, “seems to have
been destined by nature for the inviolable
asylum of liberty.” The mountains may
have been powerful auxiliaries in the
attainment of liberty; but without the
unconquerable mind, the firm purpose
to be free that first broke the chains
of servitude, mountains would have
proved but feeble ramparts. Those of
the “iron frontier of France” were
twice found insecure against the in∣vading
host; and it was on the plains
of Champagne, and Fleurus, that the
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
Genius of War bent before that of
Liberty.</P>
<P>The histories of these Cantons are
nearly the same; the same sovereignty
and the same servitude. Some of the
Cantons bore the yoke of Kings, some of
Nobles; that of Glaris was under the
tutorage of the Abbess and Nuns of
Seckingen, who transferred their privi∣leges
to the son of an Emperor. The
Swiss appear to have been treated with as
little ceremony in those days, as the
Poles in our own. There is, however,
one circumstance belonging to this spe∣cies
of traffic in which the refinement
of our civilized times claims the pre∣eminence
over the barbarous ages; the
rights of mankind were then the only ob∣jects
of barter, while one of the most pro∣fitable
branches of commercial specula∣tion
at present, is the sale of the species
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
itself. Yet from this monstrous, this co∣lossal
crime, many of the nations of
Europe turn away abhorrent; and the
execrable traffic belongs almost exclu∣sively
to that despotic country which first
discovered, and which still holds in her
feeble, but oppressive grasp, the western
hemisphere; and to that island which
was the birth-place, and the refuge of
liberty; but where now,
<Q><L>“Stern Independence from his glebe retires,</L>
<L>And anxious Freedom eyes her drooping fires;</L>
<L>By foreign wealth are British morals chang'd,</L>
<L>And Africk's sons, and India's, smile aveng'd.”</L></Q>
<BIBL>MRS. BARBAULD.</BIBL>
In the middle of the fourteenth century,
the neighbouring Cantons having driven
the Austrians out of their own country,
rendered the same service to the Canton
of Glaris; and the battle of Nefels con∣firmed
the quiet possession. The Govern∣ment
is purely democratical. A Council
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
of Regency, consisting of sixty-three
members, compose the executive power,
of which the officer called the Landam∣man,
is the chief. The legislative power
resides in the mass of the people, above
the age of sixteen, who meet in general
assembly, once a year, to propose laws, or
sanction regulations provisionally adopted
by the executive power; to make alli∣ances,
declare war, or peace, and name
their public officers. These assemblies
are held, for the most part, in the spring;
Mr. Ramond gives an interesting ac∣count
of one at which he was present
when the treaty with France was the sub∣ject
of discussion. A fall of rain had
swelled the torrents, and prevented the
greater part of the Sovereign people from
attending. The Canton, it seems, was di∣vided
into two parties, one of which was
in opposition to the reigning powers.
This party, being on the right side of the
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
torrents, were for proceeding immediately
to business, and catching the favourable
opportunity of the fall of rain which pre∣vented
the arrival of their opponents.
But, after long debate, this proposition
was over-ruled, and the meeting ad∣journed.</P>
<P>“During the Sunday,” continues Mr.
Ramond, “the Voters came into Schivan∣den
from all sides; and the number being
nearly complete, they assembled, the fol∣lowing
day, on a meadow of a few acres,
at the foot of a mountain and near the
village, where the general assembly is
held. A quadruple row of benches was
placed, and a circle formed of more than
three hundred feet in diameter. The ma∣gistrates
having taken their seats in the
inner part of the circle, the people, con∣sisting
of about four thousand men, all
armed, seated themselves on the other
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
benches, without distinction, except their
pastors, who were placed next their ma∣gistrates.
The President stood leaning on
the sword of Liberty, near the centre of
the circle, with the Secretary, and two
Serjeants, dressed in the livery of the
Canton. The women keep at a distance;
but boys not yet sixteen have a right
to go within the circle, provided they
remain seated, and do not disturb the
deliberations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“The President leans on a long and heavy cimeter, being one of those which were formerly employed in driving out the Austrians. It is without ornament, and was the sword of some valorous pa∣triot of the fourteenth century. What a sceptre is such a sword, when it is a Republican who wields it▪”—M. RAMOND.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>“The Assembly was opened by a dis∣course
from the President, who gave an
account, with noble simplicity, of the
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
details of his commission, and of the
reasons which had led him to sign the
treaty—He then proposed its ratifica∣tion,
for which the Ambassador of France
was waiting at Soleure. An object of
such importance should be decided by
the majority of voices; but the whole
Assembly cried out with one voice, that
it was useless to count them, and that
if there were a citizen present who was
not a friend to the French, it was better
he kept himself concealed. The ac∣clamations
were redoubled with a trans∣port
of which I explained the cause, and
not without some pride to my English
companions.”</P>
<P>This overflowing affection might pos∣sibly
have been founded on honourable
motives, yet it is difficult to discover at
first sight, what was the tie of sympathy
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>
between the two Governments. Habitual
intercourse sometimes changes repug∣nance
into friendship; and it was per∣haps
from those habits that the Demo∣cracy
of Glaris, like the other Democra∣cies
of Switzerland, became enamoured
of the despotism of France. But it is
singular enough, that when France, in
becoming free, deserved and claimed the
continuance of this faithful attachment,
we then saw no President of any Canton
of Switzerland “leaning on the sword
that had heretofore been the instrument of
repelling Austrians,” propose the renewal
of a treaty with France; we heard no
unanimous exclamation, that “If there
was a citizen not a friend to the French,
he had better keep himself concealed;”
and, no message proposed with bursts
of applause, to the French Ambassador
at Soleure. These republican allies of
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
France had driven him, in the moment
of her distress, to seek refuge in another
district.</P>
<P>The popular Assemblies of the little
Cantons have excited the enthusiasm of
generous minds, who fancied that they saw
in those democracies the return of the age
of the old Romans, and the republicans
of Greece. The elegant writer whom I
have quoted, admits however, that the
history of Switzerland furnishes terrible
examples of the furious passions at those
meetings.</P>
<P>We have already mentioned the pro∣ject
of the Opposition upon the swell of
the torrent. “The tumultuous menaces
and pressure of the turbulent groupe on
the President and Council,” adds M.
Ramond, “presented a spectacle fright∣ful
indeed to those who had been ac∣customed
<PB N="80" REF="87"/>
to peaceable assemblies.” Rous∣seau
had also probably overlooked those
inconveniencies of Democracy, when, in
his Social Contract, he treated representa∣tive
government as a political heresy, and
became the panegyrist of those lesser
tyrannies, from disgust, no doubt, at the
monotonous oppression of despotic go∣vernments.</P>
<P>This Canton presents a truly amiable
picture of religious toleration: while, in
the other governments of Switzerland,
the dominating religion
<Q>“Bears, like the Turk, no Brother near the throne,”</Q>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
here the diversity of faith makes no
distinction in charity, and the only dif∣ference
is in the preponderance of num∣bers.
The Protestants being the great
majority, the President of that profession
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>
remains in office three years, while the
Catholic holds his seat but two; the
Council of Regency is also chosen in
the proportion of the population. The
church is common to both sects; and no∣thing
is in disuse with both parties but
the organ, which, being an essential part
of divine service, cannot be supposed to
emit with equal harmony orthodox and
heretical sounds.</P>
<P>The love of dominion, in other re∣spects,
pervades this Canton, as it does
all the others of the Confederation. This
democracy has also its appropriate sub∣jects
in the country of Verdenberg, and
its share of different subject countries in
Switzerland, such as the Rhintal, Sar∣gans,
Thurgovia, and the dominions
beyond the Alps. So great is the purity
of manners in this Canton, that no ca∣pital
crimes are committed, and the
<PB N="82" REF="89"/>
name of a public execution is not
known. Twenty years since, we are
told, that a foreign executioner was
hired for this disagreeable office; yet I
heard from a respectable Magistrate of
Basil, that, not above ten years since, the
Judges of this Canton condemned an old
woman to death, under pretence of her
being a Witch.</P>

<P>FROM the Canton of Glaris we tra∣versed
part of the Canton of Schweitz
to Lachon, a port on the Lake of Zu∣rich,
for the merchandize consigned to
the Grisons or Italy. Here we em∣barked,
bidding adieu to Glaciers, rocks,
and torrents, for a landscape diversified
with all the milder beauties of nature;
such as pastoral hills, gardens, vines,
orchards, and fields of corn, and inter∣spersed
with country seats, and well
built handsome villages, which presented
themselves in graceful variety on each
side of the borders of this charming
Lake.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="91"/>
These inland seas not only form one
of the most interesting objects of Swiss
perspective, but also one of the most
convenient modes of communication.
A greater quantity of cultivated land,
and fewer lakes might, perhaps, be
more useful, though it would be less
picturesque; and it was, no doubt, with
this patriotic persuasion, that a citizen
of some eminence at Lucerne, while I
was dwelling with rapture on the ro∣mantic
beauties of his lake, observed to
me, that had they a King in Switzer∣land,
he would soon find means of
drying it up. How strange an idea this
republican had formed of the taste and
power of Kings!</P>
<P>The lake of Zurich is about thirty miles
long, and from two to three miles broad,
the bridge of Rapperschwill is built
across the narrowest part, and appeared
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>
as we past under it, to be upwards of
a mile in length.</P>
<P>Zurich enjoys a high pre-eminence
above the other towns of Switzerland
for private and domestic virtues; and is
also the principal seat of the sciences
and arts. This town has been called
the Athens of Switzerland, and there is
no place where literature is cultivated
with more ardour, or where the pub∣lic
mind is better informed.</P>
<P>This taste for letters, whatever ten∣dency
it may have had to purify their
manners, has been ineffectual to cor¦rect
the vices of the government. The
Canton of Zurich, like that of Basil, has
its great and little councils, and two
Burgo-masters; it contains upwards of
one hundred and seventy thousand souls,
but the sovereignty resides in a por∣tion
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
only of the citizens of Zurich not
exceeding two thousand; if, therefore,
the superior magnitude of this Canton
to that of Basil be considered, and the
disproportionate numbers who possess the
rights of sovereignity, Zurich will be
found the more despotic government.
Of these two thousand, two hundred
only are invested with power, the re∣mainder
having no other privilege than
that of being raised by the choice of
the councils to a share in the dignity
when a vacancy happens by death; so
that the government is nothing but a
mere oligarchy, incompatible with every
idea of a free political institution.</P>
<P>The system of monopolizing is prac∣tised
with greater severity in this town
than at Basil. In the former Canton,
all who are not of the number of the
elect, and within the pale of the two
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
thousand, are strangers, subjects or serfs,
and can engage in no commerce, exer∣cise
no profession, or even hope to ar∣rive
at the dignity of Burgher, which
confers these important privileges, it
being now near two centuries since this
corporation has permitted any accession
to its members. This civic degradation
is, however, but a negative kind of pu∣nishment
compared with the vexations
to which the unprivileged classes are
compelled to submit at the nod of the
Burghers their sovereigns. The peasant
is strictly prohibited transmitting the
object of his industry and labour across
the limits of his Canton, or in any
other direction than that of the town
of Zurich. To labour for the profit
of the Burgher is the occupation of his
life, and the end of his existence; to
murmur is treason, to resist is death.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="95"/>
The French revolution has numerous
advocates in the town of Zurich, men
highly enlightened and ardent in the
cause of liberty, and the veto of the
censor of the press is said to be less
rigid than in the other parts of Switzer∣land.
Whence then did it arise, that
no advocate but the pen of a foreigner
was found to plead the cause of the
subject towns of the Canton, when two
years since their representations of the
abuses under which they groaned, and
their demands of redress were answered
in the usual stile of reply to such trea∣sonable
petitions and remonstrances by
imprisonment, fines or banishment?</P>
<P>Were the boasted happiness of the
subject classes of Switzerland founded in
truth, it is not probable that revolts
against the sovereign would be so fre∣quent.
No people revolt against hap∣piness.
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
The insurrection in the middle
of the last century of the subject inha∣bitants
of four Cantons, known by the
name of the Peasant's War, when Berne
was besieged with their wooden cannon,
was certainly no rebellion against their
own prosperity; and the towns and vil∣lages
of the Canton of Zurich, when
in 1795, they produced their charters
in proof of the justice of their claims,
were in no conspiracy against comfort
and independence. It is true that the
insurgents were not beheaded like the
officer who some years since discovered
in the dust of the archives some musty
record of their ancient rights which he
communicated to a friend; but they
are smarting severely, at this moment,
under the effects of the insulted dignity
of the sovereign burghers.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="97"/>
We are told that at Zurich, more than
in any other town of Switzerland, that zeal
for liberty which distinguished the foun∣ders
of this brave nation, is still cherished;
But a hero of the fourteenth century
who chased the Austrians from the soil,
would, perhaps, frown with contempt
on this boasted spirit of freedom, could
he behold the recent severities which
these republican lovers of equal rights
have exercised against their oppressed
subjects. The municipal and internal
regulations of this city are highly worthy
of praise. The government has founded
various establishments for public relief
and instruction; amongst the former is
the orphan asylum, the institution for
apprenticing poor children, and fur∣nishing
their parents with money, clothes,
and religious books; the hospitals for in∣curables,
and also for the sick and dis∣eased
of every religion and country.
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
For the purposes of instruction several
academies are supported at the expence
of government, public education being
the affair of the State. Among other in∣stitutions,
are colleges for the classics,
and belles lettres, and arts, and also for
students in theology. Religious impres∣sions
are very early inculcated, and no∣thing
that I saw in Switzerland has left
a more pleasing impression on my mind
than a numerous audience which we
found assembled on entering a large
church at Zurich, and composed entirely
of children who were receiving instruction
from their ministers in their religious du∣ties.
It requires but little knowledge of the
human heart to feel the inestimable
advantage of impressing early on the
ductile mind those habits of virtue
and piety which shed a cheering and
steady light over the intricate mazes of
a turbulent world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Return to Lucerne.—Stantz.—Visit to the Abbot of
Engelberg.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER revisiting Basil, we returned
again to Lucerne. Our stay in this place
had been too short in our way over the
mountains to take more than a transient
view of the surrounding country; but
a still more powerful motive engaged
us to return; one of our fellow-travel∣lers
in crossing mount Albis to meet
us at Zurich, having had the misfor∣tune
to be thrown from his carriage,
was confined with a broken limb at
Lucerne. Though I am not permitted
to name the person to whom I allude,
those by whom he is known will ad∣mit,
that if any human being has a
claim to the sympathetic duties of friend∣ship,
it is he who unites with all the
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
higher qualities of the mind, a heart
glowing with the purest feelings of phi∣lanthropy,
and more unsullied by the
slightest taint of selfishness, than any
other character I have ever observed.</P>
<P>During our stay at Lucerne, we visited
various parts of the country bordering
on the lake. The first of our excursions
was directed towards the Canton of
Underwalden, into which we passed
across the branch of the lake that washes
the base of mount Pilate, from Winkel
to Stantzstad, the port belonging to the
capital of the Canton, which is the
town of Stantz.</P>
<P>This town, or rather great village, is
about two miles distant from the lake,
seated amidst charming meadows and
gardens, with a noble back ground of
well wooded mountains. The church is
<PB N="94" REF="101"/>
a fine building, supported by magnificent
columns in marble; and the town-house
is also a respectable edifice; but the
most illustrious ornament of the place
is the statue of the immortal Winkelried,
who stands erect on a pedestal before
the principal fountain, holding one of
the spears which was grasped by some
hero in the battle of Sempach.</P>
<P>The rain had confined us for some
hours at this town, and we were fearful
that the increase of the torrents would
prevent our expedition to Engelberg;
but a gleam of sunshine invited us to
proceed. After leaving Stantz, we passed
along a delicious valley thickly sown
with cottages, hamlets, and farm-houses,
agreeably shaded with fruit-trees. Five
miles beyond Stantz the valley closes,
and we ascended the mountain three
leagues to Engelberg. Our path lay
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
along a torrent stream over hung by
forests of pine, and the scenery, without
presenting the stupendous grandeur of
the Alps, was rich in the usual wild
and romantic appendages of Swiss moun∣tains.</P>
<P>Having attained the summit, we passed
by a winding descent into a valley
seated within a circle of lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty hills,
covered with wood, or pasture; beyond
which rise the majestic chain of moun∣tains,
whose tops are covered with per∣petual
snow. This valley, placed amidst
a chaos of rocks and Glaciers, is about
two miles in length, and one in breadth;
in the centre are situated the village
and abbey of Engelberg. The latter is
an edifice of fine construction, particu∣larly
the church, built in part with a
kind of black marble, quarries of which
are found in that country; this struc∣ture,
<PB N="96" REF="103"/>
displaying the elegance of art,
forms a striking contrast to the sur∣rounding
desarts of nature.</P>
<P>We arrived too late in the evening
to present our letters to the Abbot,
and therefore took up our residence at
the inn of the village, where, though
accustomed to mountain air and accom∣modation,
we passed a night of piercing
cold, arising probably from the re∣cent
fall of rain which had thrown a
veil of snow over the surrounding hills.</P>
<P>Early the next morning the Abbot,
who is a Prince of the Empire, sent
his chancellor to invite us to repair to
the monastery, where we accompanied
him, and were introduced to a venera∣ble
looking priest, who received us with
the most cordial hospitality, kindly re∣proaching
us for the late hour of our
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
arrival, and lamenting, with the polite∣ness
of a man of the world, that I had
been exposed to the inconveniences of
the homely inn.</P>
<P>As it was Sunday, the duties of the
morning, he informed us, compelled him
to remit his attentions towards us for a
short time, which we might employ in
viewing the library; this, however, we
deferred, and accompanied the chancel∣lor
to a gallery in the church which
was crouded with villagers.</P>
<P>In those elevated regions, beyond
which no human creature can exist,
and where nature itself seems to expire,
the inhabitant of the distant mountain,
and he that dwells in some remote glen
of the valley, secluded by their situa∣tion
from the world, and by their daily
occupations from the society of each
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>
other, hail the return of the day set
apart for religious observances, as a double
festival, as a means of intercourse with
earth, and with heaven. The pomp
and ceremonial of the worship must
also be peculiarly striking to the ima∣gination
of the peasant, who, confined
to a nook of his native hill, has never
formed any comparative ideas of splen∣dour
or magnificence; and the Abbot
has rendered the solemnities of the ser∣vice
still more affecting by the charm
of delightful music.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more congenial to
those finer emotions of the soul which
rise into devotion, than the harmonious
symphonies that thrilled upon the ear,
while the lifted eye fixed itself upon
the vast perspective sweep of snow-co∣vered
Alps that form the stupendous
horizon of the valley. In the fore∣ground
<PB N="99" REF="106"/>
of this gigantic mass stands the
bold impending mountain from which
the monastery takes its name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Engleberg, in the language of the country, signi∣fies the mountain of angels. Whatever intercourse his predecessors might have had with these heavenly messengers, the prince, citing a line from an epistle of Horace, declared to one of my fellow-travellers his doubts respecting this celestial consecration.</NOTE>; and on
which sublime orchestra, not unworthy
of the celestial choir, angels are fabled
to have tuned to their golden harps
the auspicious hymn of its consecra∣tion.</P>
<P>The Abbot is Sovereign Lord of En∣gleberg,
under the protection of the
four adjoining Cantons. The number of
his subjects, over whom he holds unli∣mited
jurisdiction, amounts to about
twelve hundred. The cares of his ex∣ecutive
government devolve on four or
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
five ministers and officers; and the ju∣dicial
power is entrusted to four judges,
whom he chuses out of twelve pre∣viously
named by the people; these,
with the ministers above mentioned,
form the civil and criminal tribunals of
his state, which are held in a room of
the Abbey, and of which his chancel∣lor
is secretary.</P>
<P>Such is the form of government in
this community; not indeed composed
in the newest stile of political organi∣zation,
but such as from the administra∣tion
of the present sovereign, is felt as
a blessing by all who live under its in∣fluence.
This prelate whom the united
voice of his people stamps with the
honourable name of father of his coun∣try,
has rendered tribunals civil and
criminal of little use, by cherishing in
his subjects the spirit of equity and
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>
forbearance, and reconciling their dif∣ferences
himself. The good Abbot is
not only the healer of divisions, but has
introduced a system of wealth and
comfort to the lower classes by em∣ploying
them in manufactures which
beguile the length and counteract the
severity of the savage winters.</P>
<P>This prince is a considerable manu∣facturer
himself, and carries on a very
extensive commerce in cheese. The
profits of his trade, and his other re∣venues,
which amount to upwards of
one hundred and thirty thousand livres,
are expended in acts of beneficence and
hospitality. Every wanderer has here
his claims to protection allowed, and
every visitor finds a welcome. We sat
down to table a numerous family,
composed of French emigrant priests,
the monks of the convent, and occa∣sional
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
visitors. The table was served
with plenty and hospitality; and the
chamois, the mountain venison, made a
part of the repast; but what was most
agreeable in the entertainment, was the
frank and courteous demeanour of the
venerable host.</P>
<P>Among the treasures of the convent,
the library holds a distinguished place,
and is valuable not so much for the
number of the volumes it contains,
which do not amount to more than
ten or twelve thousand, as the rarity
and early date of the editions. The
next valuable treasure of the Abbot was
the dairy, or repository of cheeses; for
we neither heard or saw any thing of
those miserable impositions on the faith
and understanding, commonly called
relicks, which had been so often shown
to us in catholic churches and convents
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
as objects of inestimable worth, compared
with which books, and even whole
magazines of cheese, would weigh no∣thing
in the balance. The Abbot, a
man of sense and literature, as well as
piety, has thought it better for the hap∣piness
of his flock to strengthen their
understanding, and amend their lives,
than to add to the stock of their pre∣judices
and follies.</P>
<P>We found the monks who formed his
society, and the students who receive
their education in the seminary, were
lovers of the liberal arts. For the entertain∣ment
of the latter, the Abbot has con∣verted
a portion of the upper part of the
convent into a theatre. It was not in
a monastery, placed amidst the rocks
and snows of Switzerland, that we should
have expected to find assembled so
<PB N="104" REF="111"/>
many of the properties of Parnas∣sus.</P>
<P>I had almost forgotten to mention that
the Abbot had a private treasure se∣parate
from the convent, which con∣sisted
in great varieties of artificial flow∣ers,
and other elegant works, which
were stowed in boxes in his apart∣ments.
These were the performances
of two emigrant nuns, to whom he had
given an asylum in the monastery,
and whom he rescued from the pains
and penalties of idleness by this exer∣cise
of their talents. A part of these
ornaments he reserves for presents to
his female visitors, the rest are disposed
of at Lucerne for the profit of the
artists.</P>
<P>The mineral productions of the moun∣tain
constituted another part of his
<PB N="105" REF="112"/>
treasure; many of the specimens were
rare and curious; as a female, the Abbot
ought to have given me a nosegay of
flowers, but, thinking probably the pre∣sent
more portable, he presented me
with two very fine specimens of the
purest rock-chrystal.</P>
<P>I should gladly have accepted the
pressing invitation of the Abbot, and
his household, to pass some time at the
monastery, but one of my fellow-tra∣vellers,
who is now an envoy to a
German Court, and who was then on
a private mission from the French go∣vernment
in Switzerland, had important
engagements which compelled him to
return. His presence, indeed, occasion∣ed
some little embarrassment to part of
the society; the emigrants discovered
him to be a Frenchman, but knew not
in what class of emigrants he deserved
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
to be ranked, while, every time he
took a pinch of snuff, he was careful
to slide hastily into his pocket the lid
of his box, on which was painted the
emblems of liberty, and the rights of
man. French politics here, as below
in the world, were the principal topics
of conversation. The emigrants were
loud in their invectives; but the Abbot
observed that things were returning to
order, and seemed more disposed to
sooth the minds, and heal by gentle
counsels and acts of beneficence the
rankling wounds of his guests, than to
animate them, like some of his bre∣thren
in Switzerland, to acts of despera∣tion
and revenge.</P>
<P>I have dwelt so long on this moun∣tain
of angels, that it is high time to
descend to the world. As it was found
impossible for my fellow-travellers to
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
prolong their visit, the Abbot insisted
that as my engagements were not so
pressing, I should be left in hostage
for their return. He promised me books,
torrents, piny forests, snows, and Glaciers
in profusion, expeditions even towards
Tetlis, which raised its snowy head
above the valley in the class of the
loftiest mountains; and the society of
the two French nuns, who appeared in∣teresting
and amiable.</P>
<P>I found it, indeed, a difficult task
to struggle against my own wishes, and
this kind and urgent invitation; but
compounded at length with both, by
consenting to return to the celebration
of the Abbot's festival, at some weeks
distance, and stay as long as he would
keep me.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="115"/>
This engagement I was unable to
fulfil; but if I ever return to Switzer∣land,
it is not the danger of doubling
the promontory on the Lake of Lu∣cerne,
which never having passed with∣out
a storm, I have called the promon∣tory
of tempests, or the fatigues of
the mountain-journey, that shall prevent
me from climbing up to Engelberg,
and paying my respects to its venerable
Abbot.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tell's Chapel.—Lake of Zug.—Zug.—Battle of Cappel.—
Government of Lucerne.—Literary Societies.</HEAD>
<P>WE had now visited every part of the
Lake of the four Cantons, except the Bay
which leads to Zug. On our return from
Engelberg, we embarked to take a cur∣sory
view of this little Canton, passing in
our voyage the monument erected by
Raynal to the memory of William Tell,
and the ruins of the Castle of Hapsburg,
from the Counts of which name the Im∣perial
House of Austria takes its descent.
On the neck of land that divides the
lake of Lucerne from that of Zug, is
erected a chapel on the spot where Tell
pierced with his arrow the Bailiff Geisler.
To those who think that all means against
tyrants are lawful, this spot will appear
the most sanctified place in Switzerland;
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
and if assassination can be justified in any
case, this has perhaps the greatest claims
to pardon; but the dexterous aim of the
archer is probably not the most laudable,
though esteemed one of the most brilliant
actions of William Tell.</P>
<P>The lake of Zug, around which “green
hills lift their dewy heads,” would ap∣pear
grand and picturesque to an ima∣gination
not filled with the images of the
lofty-wooded steeps, and dark-browed
rocks that bound the waters of Lucerne.
The town of Zug, placed near the end of
the lake, and at the foot of a mountain
covered with vines and fruit-trees, has
sufficient beauty of situation to charm
the lover of nature; and its size, propor∣tioned
to that of the Canton, is suffi∣ciently
large for the enjoyments of
society.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="118"/>
The government of the Canton is de∣mocratic,
like that of the other small
Cantons, with the same advantages, and
vices. Near the lake is the field where
was fought the battle of Cappel, between
the Reformers and the Catholics, in
which the latter triumphed, and where
the great enemy of the religion of their
fathers, Zuinglius, fell, fighting for the
cause of the Reformation, for which he
had so zealously contended.</P>
<P>The government of the Canton of Lu∣cerne,
the chief of the Catholic Cantons,
is purely oligarchical. There is indeed a
Council of one hundred, in whom the
sovereignty is nominally invested; but
the only efficient body is the senate, con∣sisting
of thirty-six members, compre∣hended
in that Council; to whom be∣longs
almost exclusively the exercise of
the power and authority of the State. As
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
this body is hereditary, the privilege of
governing descends lineally from father
to son; and no doubt whatever is ad∣mitted
with respect to the clearness of
the title. No one is rash enough to dis∣pute
the prerogatives of this privileged
class; and the present generation, and
the next that succeeds it, are consecrated,
and inviolable in the eyes of every can∣didate
for the rights of citizenship; who,
if by the payment of enormous sums, he
happily attains that honour for himself,
must leave the benefits to his posterity
yet unborn; since it is only to the third
generation of a citizen newly elected,
that the law grants the right of being
eligible to any offices, civil or eccle∣siastical,
of the State. Few individuals
aspire to the purchase of these distant and
uncertain advantages. He who plants a
tree may live to gather the fruit; but
the novice citizen of Lucerne knows that
<PB N="113" REF="120"/>
his honours will never blossom for him∣self,
and that probably they will never
even expand for his posterity.</P>
<P>The Senate being the principal ma∣chine
in the State, the Grand Council is
lightened of most of the cares of govern∣ment,
by its constant labours. In all
affairs, foreign and domestic, it is the
province of the Senate to decide; and the
wisdom of the Council is required, or
dispensed with, according to the will of
the former. There is only one hall for
the Assembly of both bodies; and for∣merly,
when the Senate prolonged its
meetings beyond the usual hour, the
great Council waited at the door till they
were admitted. This inadvertence, it
seems, has lately been corrected; but
that the distinction between senators and
simple counsellors may not be entirely
lost, the latter, when they speak, stand
<PB N="114" REF="121"/>
reverentially on their legs, while the
oracles of the senators are delivered, like
those of old, in a sitting posture.</P>
<P>By a happy confusion of powers, the
judicial authority is entrusted to the same
body who form and execute the laws.
As the Senate is in lawful possession, by
virtue of its office, of the titles of every
process that is brought before its tribunal,
if the affair is important, sufficient time
is allowed to this distinguished body, to
form its opinion; and as the chief is the
individual to whom the papers are sent, if
he or his friends are more immediately
interested in the decision, the same pre∣caution
is taken for the due preparation
of their opinions, before the affair is even
laid before the Senate. It is unn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessary
to observe by what means, under such
a system, a favourable, or unfavourable
decision may be obtained. An appeal
<PB N="115" REF="122"/>
may indeed be made to the great
Council; but the faith of the appellant
in the justice of his cause must be
strong indeed, if he expects redress,
when the Senate against whom his ap∣peal
is made, assist in the revision of
the case, and usually form the majority
of the Assembly.</P>
<P>While the senators of Lucerne take
this tender care of the property of their
subjects, they do not neglect to pay a due
attention to their own. In most other
countries, the client has permission to
name the counsel who is to plead his
cause before the tribunals; but here, the
paternal protection of the Senate steps in
to the aid of the citizens, and prevents
all ordinary extortions of law, by ad∣mitting
no other counsellors than the
senators themselves. At first sight, the
office of Judge and Advocate may seem
<PB N="116" REF="123"/>
incongruous; but who ought to be better
informed of the real state of a case than
he by whom it is to be decided? Vulgar
minds have also suggested the danger of
some bias in the heart of the Judge in
favour of his client, on account of the
fees accompanying the brief, which he
has previously accepted, as Advocate;
but who will believe that the noble
senators of Lucerne, actuated by the sor∣did
motives of common souls, are capable
of forgetting the higher considerations
of justice.</P>
<P>No less regard is paid to the lives of
their subjects by these conscript fathers,
than is snewn to their property. The
Gothic institutions of the Habeas Corpus
Act, and grand, or petty juries, are
here unknown. The prisoner is interro∣gated,
in criminal cases, by a member of
the Senate, by whom the examination
<PB N="117" REF="124"/>
is laid before the Assembly, who decide
in ordinary causes; but if it is a case
of some importance, an appeal may
be made to the grand Council. Before
the Council pass sentence, it is necessary
that the assent of the prisoner to the
truth of the deposition against him should
be taken; for which purpose, the Judge
or President, together with a small num∣ber
of the Council, repair to the prison,
to read the charges. If the prisoner ac∣knowledges
the truth of the deposition,
the affair is soon decided; but if he de∣nies
the facts, or hesitates to sign his con∣demnation,
the instruments of torture
are prepared!</P>
<P>In justification of this practice, it is
alledged that mercy and humanity re∣quire
that death, of all dreadful evils the
most dreadful, should not be inflicted till
the last evidence of crime is obtained,
<PB N="118" REF="125"/>
which is the confession of the criminal
himself. Whether death in any case
should be inflicted, has long been a ques∣tion
of criminal jurisprudence. France
has decreed its abolition at the peace;
and in many despotic countries this
punishment has become much less fre∣quent;
but the impolicy of the bar∣barous
use of torture to extort con∣fession,
has been so admirably exposed
by the irresistible arguments of the il∣lustrious
Beecaria, who, with the ac∣curacy
of an anatomist, has calculated
the comparative strength of the trem∣bling
nerve of innocence, and the
hardened fibre of guilt, that this prac∣tice
has been thrown aside by almost
every nation of Europe, but Switzer∣land:
—Is such a country the Temple
of Liberty? and are such sacrifices of∣fered
on her altars?”</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="126"/>
There is no inconsiderable number of
enlightened men in every Canton of
Switzerland, who are anxìous to see the
abuses of their government reformed, by
restoring to the community those privi∣leges
which are now the property of a
few individuals; who are desirous that
their country should deserve the character
it has long usurped, of being the most
free in Europe, and who wish to hail
the return of those days when litera∣ture
decorated the soil which valour
had won.</P>
<P>“Lucerne,” Mr. Cox observes, “is of
all places in Switzerland, that in which
literature is the least encouraged and
cultivated.” This observation seems to be
confirmed by the circumstance that this
town contains not one bookseller's shop;
and yet at Lucerne I found a select so∣ciety
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
of men of letters devoting their
time to those researches which were most
likely to prove beneficial to their country,
and who, united to each other by the
tie of sympathetic taste, usually passed
their evenings together, in the sooth∣ing
enjoyments of elegant and en∣lightened
conversation. While those titles
of which the noble senators of Lu∣cerne
are so tenacious, have scarcely
been ever heard beyond the walls of
their city, the names of Balthasar, and
Meyer, are known to every literary
circle of Paris.</P>
<P>Although the liberty of the press, the
palladium of all other liberty, is uni∣versally
proscribed in Switzerland, neither
the force of authority, nor the imprimatur
of a censor, have been able to impede
the gradual progress of that knowledge
<PB N="121" REF="128"/>
which will lead to freedom unsullied by
anarchy or violence, and restore to this
country its antient renown.</P>
<P>Trade, we are told, is under an inter∣dict
at Lucerne; and the priests are in
possession of nearly half the riches of
the Canton. It is probably a bad thing
to proscribe commerce; and yet, its
wealth has communicated no superior
charm to Basil; it must also be admitted
that it is unnecessary to leave half the
riches of a populous Canton in the pos∣session
of those who add nothing to its
force or industry, but, on the contrary,
are the chief instruments of enchain∣ing
both.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Lucerne have an
air of more chearful gaiety than we had
elsewhere observed. The features of the
women had here lost the flat German
<PB N="122" REF="129"/>
physiognomy, and assumed the soft con∣tour
of the Madona coutenance. The
ladies of Lucerne are remarked for their
beauty, and give an higher interest to
their personal charms, by cultivating the
graces of the mind.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Cabinets of Natural History in Switzerland.—Plan of

<P>AMONG the curiosities of Switzerland,
that merit the attention of travellers,
the cabinets of Natural History hold, in
the opinion of the natives, a distinguished
rank. The history of these cabinets,
which belong to individuals, and are
scattered in different Cantons, has been
accurately detailed by one of the Ber∣noullis,
in four octavo volumes; a con∣siderable
and valuable museum might be
formed of these collections, if they were
brought together for the service of the
public.</P>
<P>One of the most pleasing monuments
of topographical industry, is the plan in
relief of Switzerland, belonging to M. Meyer,
<PB N="124" REF="131"/>
of Arau; where we re-traced
with pleasure our journies amidst that
world of Glaciers on some of which no

more extensive than that of General
Pffyffer, which embraces only the Cantons
around the Lake of Lucerne, while that
of M. Meyer extends, or rather is in∣tended
when finished to extend, to all
Switzerland. But what claims the un∣wearied
meditation of the traveller in
Switzerland, is not the productions or

<PB N="125" REF="132"/>
their way, to Paris. Without pretending
to decide on the policy or the right of
the transfer, a question which has been
amply discussed, it must be admitted that
Paris, enriched by these master-pieces of
genius, may now lay claim to a more ho∣nourable
distinction than its former boast
of being the region of pleasure, the em∣porium
of elegance, and the arbiter of
fashion. Paris, arrayed in the spoils of
conquest, is now become the centre of
human attainments. Whatever is rare or
curious in the productions of nature,
magnificent in those of taste, inventive in
science, or precious in literature, is to be
found in Paris; and what merits the
highest eulogium is the extreme facility
of admission, or rather the invitation
which is given to enter these receptacles
of knowledge. Instead of the forbidding
inscription written over the Athenian
porch, “Let no unlearned person enter
<PB N="126" REF="133"/>
here,” the reading at Paris is, “Enter
all, both learned and unlearned. The
wise may add to their stores of know∣ledge,
and the ignorant may become
wise.”</P>
<P>Although the complete organization of
the establishment of public instruction
throughout the capital has not yet taken
place, the foundation is securely laid;
and surely the benevolent mind of every
country will exult in the idea of so many
fellow creatures rescued from vice and
slavery; for such are the necessary effects
of ignorance; since if knowledge, as
Bacon observed, be power, it is also vir∣tue,
freedom, and happiness.</P>
<P>The dissemination of instruction is ge∣neral
throughout France. Every capital
of the hundred and twenty departments
of the Republic has its Museum, Cabinet
<PB N="127" REF="134"/>
of Natural History, Botanic Garden, and
Philosophical Apparatus, and every Dis∣trict
or Canton its Public Library; but at
Paris these means of knowledge are found
in such magnificent profusion, that the
only hesitation of the inquirer is, amidst
the splendid variety, what part of science
he shall chuse.</P>
<P>Public Libraries are open in various
parts of Paris on particular days; but the
great National Library is at all times at
the disposition of the public. In that
region of books, immensely enriched by
manuscripts from Italy, a multitude of
persons of both sexes range themselves
in silence, at a long suite of tables, on
which implements of writing are placed,
and where they are attended by the
officers of the library, who are bound to
furnish them with the books they de∣mand.
The student of science may re∣pair
<PB N="128" REF="135"/>
to the National Garden of Plants,
where several hundred persons attend
Lectures on Chemistry, Natural History,
or Botany, amidst the finest specimens of
whatever is curious in either the animal,
vegetable, or mineral world. The col∣lection
of living animals is not yet very
extensive; it would have been con∣siderably
augmented by that of the Stadt∣holder,
had not a French Commissary
converted his menagerie into a farm∣yard,
where Indian curlews, pheasants of
Java, ostriches, and birds of the Tropic,
after being plucked of their fine feathers,
shared the fate of common poultry, and
were trussed, spitted, and devoured.
Happy for the camels and elephants that
they were at that time out of the reach
of the commissiary's cook!</P>
<P>Not long since, the fine Cabinet of
Natural History contained a curious spe∣cimen,
<PB N="129" REF="136"/>
which was the skeleton of the
great Turenne, stuck up between the
classes of monkeys and alligators. At
that sacrilegious period when the tombs
of the illustrious dead were ravaged by
those cannibals, who, fatally for the cause
of Liberty and Science, preyed so long
on the illustrious living, some French∣men,
penetrated with the generous feel∣ing
of national pride, snatched from these
savages the bones of this renowned Gene∣ral,
and placed them among these un∣couth
animals, as the surest and least
suspected asylum at that epoch of hosti∣lity
to man.</P>
<P>The most splendid monument that
Paris contains, is the gallery of paintings
called the National Museum. This gal∣lery
is formed by the whole length of
the Louvre, which is about the third of a
mile. The exhibition was perhaps un∣equalled
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
when first opened to the public,
and when it consisted only of the re∣union
of the masters which were scattered
through France; but since the conquest
of the Flemish and Italian Schools, it
may be said to contain almost the whole
of what is great or celebrated in the
History of the Arts.</P>
<P>The description of the far-famed pieces
which it now exhibits, already fills the
volumes of travellers, who have thought
the view of these precious relicks well
worth a pilgrimage to the separate shrines
where they were placed; but henceforth
that class of travellers whom Sterne de∣scribes
as failing and posting through the
politer kingdoms of the globe, in order to
see sights and look into discoveries, will
have an easier task to perform: they need
only journey as far as this vast Museum,
and run along the double rows of its
<PB N="131" REF="138"/>
gallery, hung thick with Raphaels,
Michael Angelos, Carraccis, Titians, Cor∣regios,
Guidos, Rubens, Claude Lorraines,
and Rosas. Those who are ambitious
of passing for connoisseurs, may here
learn, with little trouble, all the terms
of cognoscenti, and, like the director of
taste in the Vicar of Wakefield, never
want reasons for praising the works of
Pietro Perugino.</P>
<P>The real lover of the arts will find
ample gratification in contemplating these
sublime monuments of genius, this rich
assemblage of its collected powers! And
if the luxury of such sensations is dis∣turbed
by the ignorant comments of the
vulgar, he may, by an application seldom
refused, share the privileged hours of the
student, and indulge his feelings in the
calm of silent meditation.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="139"/>
The middle part of this extensive gal∣lery
is at present occupied by pieces of
Sculpture. For those, as well as the mo∣numents
now in their way from Italy
(among which is the Apollo Belvidere) the
Ground Gallery of the Louvre, which lies
under that of Painting, is in forward pre∣paration.
This Gallery of Sculpture will
not be less brilliant than its sister Gallery
above. The French School has been long
celebrated for the chisel; and the monu∣ments
of its labours are heaped in great
profusion in various repositories of Paris.
These pieces are now to be collected to∣gether
in this part of the Museum, of
which the Italian busts and statues will
form a splendid ornament.</P>
<P>While these delicate and more estimable
monuments are carefully protected from
the injuries of the seasons, the Govern∣ment
has decorated the Public Gardens
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
with numerous fine copies of the most
celebrated antique, and the Tuilleries
are become a walk no less agreeable to
the amateurs, than to the fashionable
world; and a further plan of embellish∣ment
is proposed, by forming a covered
Winter Garden in the Orange-walk, de∣corated
with hot-house plants, and dif∣fusing
the temperature of Spring. A re∣generated
statue of Liberty will be
erected on the Place of Concord, for∣merly
Place de Louis XV. and a column
of Victory three hundred feet in height,
crowned by a colossal statue of Fame,
will be placed at the end of the Vista
leading from the Tuilleries.</P>
<P>Various institutions are formed for the
progress of knowledge in France, among
which the Polytechnical School claims a
distinguished place. Of these institutions,
and of all that concerns the sciences, the
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>
members of the National Institute are the
guardians. Unlike most of the learned
societies of Europe, which confine them∣selves
almost exclusively to one branch of
science, the Institute is divided into
classes, which comprehend every depart∣ment
of human knowledge. The pesti∣lential
reign of terrorism has swept away
many who would have been among its
most illustrious ornaments; but the num∣ber
left is not inconsiderable of those
who would do honour to any age or
country. A certain portion of the re∣venue
of the State is appropriated to the
service of the Institute, whose members
receive a recompense for their labours,
which is neither adequate to their dig∣nity,
nor that of the Republic. This
narrow stipend will no doubt be aug∣mented
at the peace; and the Republic
will pay more liberally the debt she owes
to Literature, the parent of her existence.
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>
The Government has indeed observed the
most respectful attention towards this
learned body from its first institution;
and this homage, rendered to Science by
Power, is among the most pleasing fea∣tures
of its administration.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Autumnal Views on the Jura.—Soleure.—View of the
Chain of Alps.—Bienne.—Neufchatel.</HEAD>
<P>WE had consecrated the summer
months to journeying amidst the savage
alpine scenery of Switzerland, leaving
to the months of Autumn the view of
the milder landscapes of that enchant∣ing
country, where nature, when she
ceases to overwhelm the imagination
with her greatness, assumes the softest
smile of lavish beauty. We had yet
seen but an inconsiderable part of the
Canton of Berne, and none of the de∣licious
countries washed by the lake of
Geneva, and which are esteemed by
travellers the garden of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="144"/>
The year had now
<Q>“Fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf;”</Q>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL>
and after spending two or three weeks
at Basil on our return from Lucerne, we
once more crossed the mountains of
Jura. The last time we ascended those
romantic steeps, they were dressed in
all the rich gradations of colouring
which belong to Autumn. The
deep brown, and pale yellow, which
overspread in their various tints the fo∣liage
of the wooded cliffs, contrasted
with the fresh ever-green of the groves
of pine and fir, and the bright verdure
which still covered the pastoral lawns.
The rills seemed to flow in clearer cur∣rents;
there was a sort of spirit in the
air, and the whole scenery mingling
gay and luxuriant graces, with fading
forms, excited that soft and soothing
melancholy which, to some minds, is
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
so much dearer than all that the world
calls pleasure.</P>
<P>The town of Soleure, situated on the
Aar, in a beautiful and fertile coun∣try,
contains several fine edifices, of
which the new built church in the
principal street, ornamented with two
superb fountains in front, is the most
distinguished. The town is fortified,
and appears sufficiently strong to keep
out an army of revolted peasantry, the
only purpose to which sortifications in
Switzerland have for two or three cen∣turies
past been applied.</P>
<P>At the gate we were compelled to
undergo a long ceremonial of exami∣nation,
and were referred from one
committee of guards to another before
we were suffered to enter, though our
passports were in perfect order, and bore no
<PB N="139" REF="146"/>
mischievous traces of intelligence with
France. We had been previously told,
that persons coming from that country,
except such as came without passports,
had in this town been subjected to in∣sult,
and even danger; nor were we
surprized at this intelligence, having
heard from M. Barthelemy himself the
mode of his expulsion from the accus∣tomed
residence of the French ambas∣sadors
at Soleure.</P>
<P>The government of this Canton is an
oligarchy, like that of Lucerne, com∣posed
of a council of one hundred and
one, including the thirty-five members
of the senate who form the executive
power. There is something liberal in
the exercise of privilege in this Canton
compared with that of Lucerne; here
the places of honour or profit are dis∣tributed
amongst thirty families, while
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
at Lucerne the influence and principal
offices of the State are confined to ten
or twelve.</P>
<P>Although Soleure had relaxed some∣thing
of the severity of its features to∣wards
France since the retreat of the
coaleseed armies across the Rhine, and
the arrival of the Prussian envoy at
Basil to treat of peace, there was yet
no such demonstration of the return of
the old cordiality as could make even
a slight residence agreeable to those
who were friends to the cause of li∣berty;
and remaining but a sufficient
time to view the city, and its charm∣ing
environs, we continued our journey
to Bienne.</P>
<P>On the road to Bienne, which lies
along the foot of the Jura, we beheld
one of the grandest views which Swit∣zerland
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
had yet presented to our ad∣miration.
In most of its Cantons some
snowy mountain forms the background
of the picture; but here we saw dis∣played
in all their majesty the whole
chain of Alps from St. Gothard to the
Lake of Geneva; forming one vast world
of Glaciers, behind whose towering
peaks Mount Blanc reared its august
and sublimest head. Although but at
the distance of fifty or sixty miles, we
were so placed that the eye could take
in at one view this mighty range of
mountain. The sun lighted up the hills
by which we were separated from the
chain of Alps long after its setting orb had
sunk behind Mount Jura from our view;
but the shadowy gradations of twilight
had fallen both on hill and valley,
when the most vivid hue of the rose
from every alpine peak reflected the
solar beams, and flushed the wide he∣misphere
<PB N="142" REF="149"/>
with one bright tint of splen∣dour.</P>
<P>Bienne is a neat small town, situated
near the lake which bears its name,
celebrated in modern story as having
been the retreat of Rousseau, who lived
for some time on the island of St.
Pierre, and was compelled, at length,
to seek refuge in Paris from the per∣secution
of the Republics of Switzer∣land.
The French Government, in right
of the possession of the Bishoprick of
Basil, now the department of Mount
Terrible, is Sovereign of the State of
Bienne; but as objects of more impor∣tance
at that time occupied its attention,
the great and little councils to whom
the administration of State affairs be∣longs
of right, took care also, during
the inter-regnum, of the Sovereignty.
The Mayor of the town is the repre∣sentative
<PB N="143" REF="150"/>
of this Sovereign, whose power
is merely nominal, and whose revenues
are scarcely more than sufficient to
pay the salary of his treasurer. The
legislative power of the State is entrusted
to the great council, the little council
wield the seeptre; and, as in case of
vacancies, these two bodies name the
succeeding members, the government is
purely aristocratical.</P>
<P>It was our good fortune to alight at
an inn of which the master, Mr. Wizard,
is great counsellor and treasurer of the
State. The company at Mr. Wizard's
table, which was well furnished, con∣sisted
of senators of Bienne, and French
emigrants. Mr. Wizard was deeply
skilled in the political affairs of Europe;
and insinuated, that had his advice been
followed, matters would have been dif∣ferently
arranged between the Swiss
<PB N="144" REF="151"/>
Cantons and France. “I have observed,”
said this senator, “with great concern,
the part which our allies have taken
in this dispute, and have highly disap∣proved
of the conduct of our neigh∣bours
the Canton of Berne. We,” added
he, “have evinced very different dispo∣sitions;
when every power in Europe
was coalesced against the French Repub∣lic,
the town of Bienne took her by
the hand; and surely those who strug∣gle
for liberty ought not to fail for
want of assistance.” As Mr. Wizard
proclaimed these opinions before emi∣grants
and English, there could be no
hypocrisy in his sentiments; nor can
there be any impropriety in this testi∣mony
to his zeal.</P>
<P>No doubt, had his advice in favour
of the French Republic been followed,
he would have given his vote with
<PB N="145" REF="152"/>
alacrity for the augmentation of her
military force by the contingent of
Bienne, which, I believe, amounts to
fourteen men.</P>
<P>The journals of travellers in Switzer
land are filled with complaints of
heavy impositions at the inns, nor do
they murmur without caus; but the
sentiments of Mr. Wizard are, no doubt,
elevated in proportion to his rank; he
scorns to impose upon the traveller,
and his house is one of the cheapest
as well as the best in all Switzerland.
In making this declaration, I only add
my feeble testimony to that of a dis∣tinguished
croud, whose names were
contained in two enormous packets
which he produced in order to shew
me how many of my countrymen had
been his guests. Each person at his
departure had left a little certificate,
<PB N="146" REF="153"/>
stating that he who signed it was per∣fectly
satisfied with Mr. Wizard.</P>
<P>Old and young, patricians and plebeians,
lords and commons, were all satisfied
with Mr. Wizard; this was the burden
of the song from persons of all coun∣tries
and conditions; I never remember
to have met with so many uniform
opinions on the same subject. We had
examined a multitude of these testimo∣nies,
when Mr. Wizard, passing hastily
over Counts, Dukes and Princes, snatched
up eagerly a scrap of paper which he
exclaimed was a certificate that he
would not lose for twenty louis. From
the glow on the countenance of Mr.
Wizard, and the energy with which he
spoke, I guessed that it was at least
the tribute of an Emperor. “There,”
added he, throwing it with a look of
triumph on the table, “there is the
<PB N="147" REF="154"/>
name of the first man in Europe.”
We looked to discover who was thus
elevated in our host's opinion, and read,
with that sort of personal pride which we
feel in those powers of genius that give dis∣tinction
to our own country, the sig∣nature
of Charles Fox.</P>
<P>From the sovereignty of the French
Republic, we passed in a few hours
through a charming country, into that
of the King of Prussia; the respective
subjects of these two Powers were living
in good harmony with each other in
Switzerland, while their fellow-subjects
on the Rhine were employed in mutual
slaughter.</P>
<P>Neufchatel is pleasantly situated on
an ample lake, of which the waters,
agitated by a storm, were flushed with
deep tints of green and purple. This
<PB N="148" REF="155"/>
town forms part of the dominions of
the Prussian monarch, but from the
privileges which it possesses, is exempted
from engaging in any projects hostile
to its own opinions or interest. The
government of the town and district is
a confusion of powers not well defined;
but it would appear from the industry
and opulence of the inhabitants, com∣pared
with many other parts of Swit∣zerland▪
together with the works that
issued from the presses of Neuschatel
during the French monarchy, that
Prussian despotism did not weigh on
them with too heavy an hand. Since
the celebrated controversy, which arose
between Petit-pierre and his bre∣thren
the clergy of Neuschatel, res∣pecting
the eternity of hell torments.
in which opinion the former was sup∣ported
by Frederick the Great, no
centest respecting prerogative or privilege
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
has taken place. The King, Petit-pierre,
and Marshal Keith, with their doctrine
of final salvation, were, after long dis∣cussion,
obliged to quit the field; the
clergy maintained their privileges, and
the King declared that “puisqu'ils
avoient si fort à coeur d'etre damnés
eternellement,” he should no longer op∣pose
their determination.</P>

<P>AFTER making various excursions round
Neufchatel, to the villages of Locle,
Chaux, de Fond, and as far as Yverdun,
we returned by the lake to Morat, im∣mortalized

At Avenches, the classic ground of
Switzerland, we went to see the tesselated
pavement, which was shewn to us by a
peasant, who has the charge of this relick
of antiquity, or rather of the tobacco∣leaves
which overspread it; for there
they remain, in spite of the just re∣monstrances
of Mr. Cox. Every passing
stranger may take up as many fragments
as suits his humour of this curious pave∣ment,
which, in a country of taste, would
be preserved with religious care. We
also visited the remains of the Amphi∣theatre
in the Bailiss's Garden, the marble
pillar, and other monuments which de∣note
the former grandeur of the Capital
of antient Helvetia. Similar monuments
have been discovered in the neighbour∣hood
of the lake of Neufchatel, particu∣larly
at Cheyres.</P>
<P>From Avenches, we proceeded to Mou∣don,
which was the antient capital of
<PB N="153" REF="160"/>
the Pays de Vaud, before it fell under
the dominion of the Canton of Berne,
At present it only serves to yield a re∣venue
to some Sovereign Burgher of
Berne, who, under the name of Bailiss,
lives in a fine chateau, which, perched
on a rock, raises its spiral towers at
Larchens, about a league from Moudon,
and which once belonged to the dig∣nitaries
of the Pays de Vaud. Wherever
we met with palaces or castles in this
country, it was unnecessary to inquire
to whom they belonged, since the in∣habitant
never failed to be a Bailiff of
the sovereign Canton of Berne.</P>
<P>We passed some days in the Pays de
Vaud, which, rich in charming pasto∣ral
scenery, sloping lawns, embowering
groves, and lovely cultivated hills,
crowned with the bare peak of a wooded
cliff, half-veiled by clustering foliage, re∣minded
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>
me of the most beautiful parts
of England. The Pays de Vaud is not
only enchanting, in its soft perspectives,
to the lover of nature, but fertile in every
production for the support or enjoyment
of life. In such a country, Despotism
itself could scarcely weigh heavy enough
with its iron hand, to crush the inhabitant
beneath oppression. The fruitfulness of
the soil keeps pace with the exactions of
avarice; and the subject-peasant, though
robbed of his rights, finds some compensa∣tion
in the bounty of nature. We left these
Arcadian Vales, and ascended the chain
of hills that encircle the Lake of Geneva;
where, in strong contrast to the mild
picture of the Pays de Vaud, we gazed
once more on rocks and mountains,
rudely hanging over the opposite banks of
the lake, and whose tops were whitened
by new-fallen snow. In the back ground
rose the Alps, covered with their un∣varied
<PB N="155" REF="162"/>
shroud. As we descended the hills,
we beheld the spacious Lake stretching
its ample waters along the base of this
ridge of mountains, far as the eye could
reach; and our path to Lausanne, leading
along vine-covered hills, and displaying
at one view the luxuriant charms of
beauty, and the awful wildness of terrific
grandeur, furnished all those combina∣tions
of imagery which eroud the dreams
of the poet.</P>
<P>Probably no town of Europe is better
situated than Lausanne to delight the
traveller by its picturesque views, or more
inconveniently placed for a constant re∣sidence.
This town is, for the most part,
either abyss or mountain; the streets
communicate with each other by long
flights of steps, down which you descend
into what was formerly a ravin, in order
to ascend, on the other side, what must
<PB N="156" REF="163"/>
once have been a precipice. Since many
other spots might have been chosen for
a city, either nearer the lake for the
sake of commerce, or higher up for de∣fence,
it seems strange that the foundati∣ons
should have been laid in a place above
all others the least situated for habitual
accommodation. We found Lausanne
filled with emigrants from France, and
also from Geneva, the Jacobins of that
Republic having, at the close of the reign
of Robespierre, perpetrated some of those
atrocious acts which had so long deso∣lated
France.</P>
<P>The Republic of Geneva, by a general
insurrection in the beginning of 1789,
had thrown off the chains which a de∣spotic
magistracy, seven years before,
aided by the combined armies of France,
Berne, and Sardinia, had imposed on
their fellow citizens. Although, in this
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>
instance, she spoke the prologue to the
drama of the French Revolution, which
happened some months after, she has
since never failed to play the after-piece
to all its eventful transitions.</P>
<P>Of five classes of inhabitants belonging
to Geneva, two only, those of Citizens
and Burghers, composed the Sovereign
Assembly, improperly called, “General
Council.”—The classes of natives, in∣habitants,
and house-keepers, enjoyed no
political rights; these were the preroga∣tives
only of the two former. It may be
easily conceived that those three un∣privileged
classes could not behold with
indifference the establishment and con∣solidation
of the French Revolution.
They viewed its progress at first with
secret exultation, as a sure presage of
their own; and a society at length was
formed of the partizans of the new
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
system, under the name of the Circle of
Equality. The views of this society were
altogether directed towards the establish∣ment
of the just principles of liberty, in
despite of the opposition of the citizens,
in whom the exclusive sovereignty was
vested, and also of such of the un∣privileged
classes as were attached to the
existing government from different cir∣cumstances,
or who had nothing to gain
by a change. The demands of these ad∣vocates
for Equal Rights had hitherto
been only whispered; but when the
invasion of Savoy had taken place, at the
close of the first campaign, in 1792, the
neighbourhood of the Republican army
to Geneva emboldened these patriots to
make remonstrances which had the air
of authority, if not of menace. The
great, and little councils, finding that
a refusal or even delay under such circum∣stances
would be attended with con∣siderable
<PB N="159" REF="166"/>
danger, appeared to be con∣vinced
by the arguments of the peti∣tioners,
and passed a decree in favour of
Equal Rights, with certain slight restric∣tions;
and in order to give this decree
the sanction of the constitutional form,
they framed a sketch of a law which was
to be submitted to the General Council.
This preamble gave great offence to the
friends of Equality, who were unwilling
to receive as a gift what they felt was
their right. The two parties immediately
became exasperated against each other.
The Genevois who dreaded a Revolu∣tion,
being more numerous than those
who wished it, solicited the commander
of the military force to beat to arms, and
ring the alarm-bell, in order to awe their
adversaries into silence. The Syndic
of the Guard, Mr. Micheli Ducrest, to
avoid the effusion of blood, refused to
comply with this requisition; he not
<PB N="160" REF="167"/>
only invited the partizans of the govern∣ment,
who were on guard at their posts
in the city, to retire to their homes, but
put into the hands of the leaders of the
friends to Equal Rights the keys of the
Park of Artillery. They were not tardy
in taking advantage of this important ac∣quisition.
On the Ist of December they
made themselves masters of the place,
the Red Cap was hoisted, Trees of Liberty
were planted in different quarters of the
town, on the 5th the Revolution was
completed, and the triumphant party
named forty select men, in order to or∣ganize
the new system. On the 12th
of December, the Anniversary of the
Escaladi of 1602, Political Equality was
proclaimed in the General Council; and,
the 28th of the same month, the dis∣missal
of the great and little councils, pro∣mulgated
in the name of the Deputies
of the Nation, made way for two pro∣visional
<PB N="161" REF="168"/>
committees, with the names of
Committees of Safety, and Administra∣tion;
which election was confirmed, the
last day of the year, by a sovereign
assembly, composed of both the old and
newly-admitted citizens.</P>
<P>The Revolution being effected, the Ge∣nevois
were anxious to confirm it by a
constitution purely democratic. A Na∣tional
Assembly, composed of one hun∣dred
and twenty members, chosen among
the citizens of both parties, opened the
session the 25th of February, 1793. At
the close of the year, the plan of the
constitution was printed, and submitted
to the consideration of the people, and,
on the 5th of February, 1794, was ac∣cepted
by the citizens assembled in sove∣reign
council. This constitutional edict,
founded on the great principles of liberty,
consecrated the rights of man, the di∣vision
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>
of power, and the responsibility of
office, and though defective in many re∣spects,
and formed rather for a wealthy,
extensive state, than a small and circum∣scribed
republic, was gladly received by
the great mass of the people. The Gene∣vois
were anxious for the establishment
of a government which should protect
their persons and properties, an advan∣tage
of which both parties had not had
an equal enjoyment under the <HI>Pro∣visionary
Regime,</HI> where many acts of pil∣lage,
cruelty, and even murder, had re∣mained
unpunished through the weak∣ness
or connivance of those in power.
The new authorities who entered on
office the 13th of April, were acknow∣ledged
by the governments of Berne and
Zurich, who had refused to correspond
with the provisional committees; the
magistrates were respected, the prejudices
and hatred of the different parties ap∣peared
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
to be extinct, and order and har∣mony
completely restored, when this
happy state of calm and tranquillity was
disturbed by the insurrection of the 19th
of July, and the scenes to which it gave
birth.</P>
<P>The preceding evening, in a numerous
sitting of the general Club of the Revo∣lutionists,
some of the leaders of the
party announced a conspiracy formed
against the Patriots, by the <HI>Aristocrates,</HI>
and the <HI>Englués</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name given to those persons who had taken no part in the Revolution.</NOTE>. On hearing this de∣nunciation,
the most furious of the party
moved for an immediate call to arms, in
order to crush the conspiracy, and punish
the traitors, while those who were more
moderate, contended that the meeting of
the sovereign council, which was to as∣semble
<PB N="164" REF="171"/>
the next day to decide on im∣posing
some urgent taxes, ought not to
be disturbed by such a sudden, and pro∣bably
ill-founded alarm. While the Pre∣sident
was putting the question, about
thirty of the most vehement members
ran furiously out of the hall, calling to
arms, which gave an impulse to others,
and the whole tumultuously put them∣selves
in insurrection.</P>
<P>Before day-break, revolutionary patroles
had filled the streets, made domiciliary
visits, and arrested those of the <HI>Aristocrates,</HI>
and the <HI>Englués,</HI> who were the most
suspected. During the morning, the in∣surgents
made a proclamation, enjoining
every revolutionist to arm for the safety
of the country, and his own; the meet∣ing
of the sovereign council was de∣ferred,
the seals were put on the effects
and papers of many citizens, who were
<PB N="165" REF="172"/>
imprisoned or absent, various depreda∣dations
were committed in the houses
of individuals, both in the town and
country; and all those who had taken no
part in the Revolution were disarmed.</P>
<P>The revolutionary clubs, who corre∣sponded
at that time with the Jacobin
Society in France, and who had caught
the contagion of their spirit, named a
military commission, composed of seven
members, to organize the insurrection,
leaving every civil concern under the
direction of the constitutional laws, and
the legal authorities. The gates of the
city were instantly shut, divine worship
was suspended, and many of its ministers,
respectable for their age and services,
were dragged to houses of confinement,
where more than five hundred of their
fellow citizens were heaped together
during the most severish heat of summer.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="173"/>
On the demand of the military com∣mittee,
the insurrectionary clubs formed
a revolutionary tribunal composed of
twenty-one members to try the pri∣soners;
but the sentence of death could
not be put into execution till confirmed
by the majority of the revolutionists.
The tribunal sat publicly in one of the
halls of the Hotel de Ville, and brought
first to the bar those of the prisoners
who were enregistered under the deno∣mination
of the chief criminals, seven
of whom were condemned to die. In
conformity to this decree, the revolu∣tionists
assembled in arms in one of the
public walks of the city called the
National Lyceum, to sanction, or annul
in whole, or in part, the sentence of
the tribunal. The leaders expelled from
this assembly every person who was not
known for a decided revolutionist, and,
after this epuration, gave their votes by
<PB N="167" REF="174"/>
white and black balls, the former of
which denoted an acquittal, and the
latter death. Three of those who were
condemned by the tribunal were saved
by this operation; but as they were
members of patrician families, and had
held the first places in the State, se∣veral
of the revolutionists, heated by
wine which had been plentifully la∣vished
on the occasion, exclaimed in a
rage, that there was a plot to save
the aristocrats who ought all to perish.
Whilst others more moderate were en∣deavouring
to silence, or persuade them,
that they ought to yield to the decision o
the majority, a group of the most savage
amongst them withdrew from the ranks,
and ran to the prisons to seize the seven
victims, whom they brought <HI>au pas de
charge</HI> into the fatal circle. The mo∣derate
party were, by this time, con∣siderably
diminished; a square battalion
<PB N="168" REF="175"/>
was formed; the tribunal placed in the
centre pronounced sentence of death on
all the seven, who were immediately
shot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The four citizens condemned by the tribunal were <HI>Decembres,</HI> lieutenant colonel of the regiment of Ge∣neva, <HI>Murrier, Chenaud,</HI> and <HI>Viviors Decor,</HI> watch∣makers:—those acquitted by the people were <HI>Cayla,</HI> Ex∣Syndic, <HI>Prevest Cabanis,</HI> procureur generale, <HI>Deroch∣ment,</HI> counsellor.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some days after, two respectable ma∣gistrates,
a financier, and a reputable
tradesman, underwent the same punish∣ment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The citizens who were condemned by the tribunal were <HI>Fatio,</HI> Ex-Syndic, <HI>Naville,</HI> Ex-procureur, <HI>Andead,</HI> a banker, and <HI>De Lorme,</HI> a watch-maker.</NOTE>;
but the people were not con∣sulted
on this occasion, because at the
requisition of the revolutionary judges,
the clubs had decided that no further
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>
appeal should me made to the nation
to confirm any sentence; but that two-thirds
of the votes of the tribunal should
be sufficient for sentence of death. On
the 11th of August this fatal tribunal
ended its sittings, after having con∣demned
thirty-seven persons to death,
of which, twenty-six were absent; an
hundred to banishment; about three
hundred to imprisonment; some for
life; others for different terms, and
the remainder were discharged with a
few revolutionary admonitions.</P>
<P>One of the causes of the insurrection
had been the want of money: the
reign of terror came in aid of the ex∣hausted
finances, and the indigent jaco∣bins.
When the clubs named the mem∣bers
of the tribunal, they chose also a
revolutionary commission which de∣clared
<PB N="170" REF="177"/>
null and void every Notorial Act
passed since the 18th July; sequestered
the goods of those who were imprisoned,
or who being absent, were found guilty;
forbade the export of coin, goods, or
plate; decreed that all silver furniture
should be carried to the Mint; that
every person should declare the state of
his fortune; that heavy contributions
should be levied on the aristocrats;
others less exorbitant on the <HI>Engloués,</HI>
and some still more moderate on the
rich Patriots. The produce of these
taxes and seizures were employed for
the most part to salary the revolutionists
who had supported the insurrection,
the members of the military committee
of the tribunal and revolutionary com∣mission.
While the commission was de∣ciding
on, and levying the contributions
which the insurgents had declared due
<PB N="171" REF="178"/>
to the country by the enemies of the
revolution, it changed its financial occu∣pations
into functions far more dreadful,
and a second revolutionary tribunal was
soon after erected. For more than a
year past a popular society under the
name of <HI>“Mountaineers, Centinels of Li∣berty,”</HI>
had been formed at Geneva: the
views of the leaders in this society were
to destroy the constituted authorities,
and to disorganize the revolution: a
plan was distributed in the name of
these Mountaineers, and amongst the
different popular societies, containing
amongst other propositions, that of ar∣resting
all those citizens who had com∣posed
the Genevese authorities from
the 28th December, 1792, to the pre∣sent
period: this project included va∣rious
classes, from the first merchant
to the lowest tradesman; these ultra∣revolutionary
propositions alarmed the
<PB N="172" REF="179"/>
revolutionists, who immediately shut up
the club of Mountaineers, imprisoned
the leaders, and put the rest of the
members under arrest at their own
houses. The Patriots then ordered the
revolutionary commission to form itself
into a revolutionary tribunal, and to do
justice to the enemies of independence,
the sactions of anarchy, the aristocrats
and <HI>Engloués</HI> who had escaped the vi∣gilance
of the former tribunal. The
first who appeared at the bar of this
new tribunal, were the Anarchists, and
enemies of independence, leaders in the
insurrection of the 19th of July; four
of whom, after being heard in their
defence, were condemned to death as
traitors to their country; a few mem∣bers
of the Mountaineer-society were
sentenced to perpetual banishment;
others to the same punishment for dif∣ferent
periods; some were deprived of
<PB N="173" REF="180"/>
their political rights, and the greatest
number, who had only been misled,
were dismissed with a fraternal admo∣nition.
At this period a <HI>national com∣mission</HI>
was formed; the revolutionary com∣mission
was dissolved, and was succeeded
by a <HI>commission of liquidation,</HI> which un∣dertook
to weigh the purses of the
Genevois, and tax them according to
their weight, and the political opinions
of their possessors.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the country, who
had seen nothing in the Revolution of
1792, but an exemption from taxes, re∣fused
with obstinate perseverance to pay
any contribution, and concluded with
giving little. A revolt in the garrison of
the town was appeased, and punished
by the breaking of two companies of
cannoneers. Commerce, disengaged by
degrees from revolutionary requisitions,
<PB N="174" REF="181"/>
resumed a free course; a part of the pro∣duce
of the extraordinary taxes was use∣fully
applied to patriotic establishments,
to the advancement of the sciences and
arts, and the encouragement of literature.
All the titles of former citizenship, all
the parchments of the privileged orders,
were publicly burnt on the day of the
national festival; and the petitions of
numbers of citizens presented to the revo∣lutionary
clubs to obtain a revision of
their judgment, were favourably heard,
and justice became, as in France, once
more the order of the day.</P>
<P>Geneva, true to its prototype, as soon
as France had formed a constitution,
formed or changed its constitution also;
in which, however, there is this singular
distinction, that, whilst a catholic coun∣try,
France, admits partizans of every
religion, the Jew, Mahometan, and Pro∣testant,
<PB N="175" REF="182"/>
to an equal participation of rights,
the Genevan sauts the door sternly against
Catholics, and shrinks almost from its
liberality in having admitted the follower
of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. This narrow spirit of bigotry
is confined to the lower classes of the
people; and the attempts hitherto made
by its more enlightened citizens to change
the opinion that Catholicisin and slavery
are not necessarily connected, have been
unsuccessful. It is not unworthy of ob∣servation,
that the great religious Re∣former
of Geneva, who has given his
name to the most extensive portion of the
Protestant world, should have rivetted the
chains of religious despotism, while he
became, by his political institutions, the
father of civil liberty in Europe. These
spots in the constitution of Geneva will
perhaps vanish after a few years of inde∣pendence,
provided it can maintain the
due balance between its attractive and
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>
repulsive forces, when placed within the
orbit of so mighty a planet as the French
Republic.</P>
<P>Lausanne to Vevay lies along the bor∣der
of the lake, which, seen from its
level in the direction towards the valley
from which its waters flow, to that point
where they again become a river, appears
like a wide arm of the sea. On the
right, the dusky rocks of Chablais skirted
the opposite shores, while above our path
on the left, the pendant vines, though
now despoiled of their purple clusters,
spread their faded drapery along the
losty hills.</P>
<P>At the distance of a mile from Vevay,
our ears were struck with sounds which
we had not heard since our arrival in
Switzerland. These were the Marseillois
march, proceeding from a band of music,
<PB N="177" REF="184"/>
which the turn of an angle of the road
brought within our view, and which was
followed by a numerous band of young
men, who, with great good-humour and
gaiety, hailed us by the long unheard salu∣tations
of “Bon jour, citoyens; Bon jour,
citoyennes.” We answered these repub∣lican
compliments in the same style in
which they were made, and concluded
that this was a groupe of the new French
citizens of Mont Blanc, who had crossed
the lake for the purpose of a festival. The
day, alas! proved no festival to this gay
troop, as I shall have occasion to relate.</P>

<P>VEVAY is esteemed the most beauti∣ful
town in the Pays de Vaud. The
hills, fertile to their summits in corn
and wine, which had hitherto skirted
the lake, forming a rich and beautiful
amphitheatre, here rise into mountains,
which gradually swelled at no great
distance into part of that immense
chain of Alps that form the southern
barrier of Switzerland.</P>
<P>Vevay is the principal port for the
commerce of the Vallais, and formerly
of Savoy, with the latter of which, now
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
forming part of the French Republic,
there was no more friendly communi∣cation
than could be well avoided. The
country around Vevay, where Rousleau
has placed the scene of his charming
romance, is become classic ground.
On our left, as we journeyed towards
the Vallais, we passed the village of
Clarens, embosomed in trees at the
foot of a mountain; farther on is the
castle of Chillon, seated in the lake;
over which, on the opposite side, hang
the dark rocks of Meillerie. It would
be hopeless to attempt a new sketch of
these enchanting regions after the glow∣ing
description of Rousseau, which has
already been so often detailed by the
hundred sentimental pilgrims, who, with
Heloise in hand, run over the rocks and
mountains to catch the lover's inspira∣tion.
All in nature is still romantic,
wild, and graceful, as Rousseau has
<PB N="180" REF="187"/>
painted it; but the soothing charm as∣sociated
with the moral feeling, is in
some sort dissolved. The soft image of
the impassioned Julia no longer hovers
around the castle of Chillen; which is
now converted into a Swiss Bastile, and
guarded by a stern soldiery. The tear
of sensibility which has so often been
shed over this spot for the woes of
fiction, may now fall for sorrows that
have the dull reality of existence. It
is not the imaginary maternal shrick
that pierces the ear, it is the groan of
the patriot rising from the floor of his
damp dungeon that rends the heart.</P>
<P>We rambled through this romantic
scenery a considerable part of the day,
which, it being now the season when
the “teeth of the Jaman begin to
whiten,” had drawn quite to its close
<PB N="181" REF="188"/>
before we reached the village of Bex,
celebrated for its extensive salt-works.</P>
<P>We had now entered the lower Val∣lais,
that immense gulph which sepa∣rates
the double range of Alps and
Glaciers that divide Switzerland from
Italy; and which, branching off from
the mass that forms St. Gothard, slightly
diverge from each other for nearly an
hundred miles to the lake of Geneva,
formed by the Rhone that rises at the
farther extremity of the Vallais.</P>
<P>When we reached St. Maurice, we
had attained the furthest limits of Swiss
territory. Here begins the government
of the democracy of the Vallais. The
closing mountains are connected by a
wooden gate which locks up the Re∣public,
and forbids all entrance to those
who shrink from examination. A bridge
<PB N="182" REF="189"/>
of one arch thrown over the Rhone at
this pass is esteemed a fine monument
of Roman architecture. On the rocks
rising from the water is built the castle
of the Bailiff, to whom is committed
the important charge of excluding all
French principles, and all French news∣papers,
the Gazette of Berne excepted;
this we saw notified by a placard stuck
on the wall, which stated the various
degrees of corporal punishment to be in∣flicted
on those who should indulge
themselves in discussions on the prin∣ciples
of Government, or be guilty of the
overt act of receiving or reading the papers.</P>
<P>About two leagues beyond St. Maurice,
we came within the sound of the ca∣taract
of Salenche; which, on ascend∣ing
the little eminence that concealed
it from our view, we beheld pouring
from an enormous height its divided
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
streams which used to rush down the
perpendicular rock in one broad street,
producing a far sublimer effect; but the
artificer, whose little mill is placed
near the fall, informed us, that some
months before he had obtained per∣mission
of the Bailiff, or Abbot of St.
Maurice, to apply part of the torrent
to his use, which he contrived to do
by rolling rocks into the stream above,
and dividing its current.</P>
<P>Had the Abbot furnished the poor
cottager with the means of directing
part of the water to his mill after it
had descended, which, with a small ex∣pence
he could have done, his bene∣volence
would have deserved applause;
but to arrest with profane hand the
waters at their eagle-height, and turn
them from their headlong pathway, was
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>
a sacrilegious attempt on the majesty
of the cataract, never to be forgiven.</P>
<P>From the town of Martinach we pro∣ceeded
to Sion, the capital of the Vallais.
The Bishop's palace is pleasantly seated
on an eminence which commands a
noble view of the surrounding moun∣tains,
and finely cultivated plain, through
which the Rhone winds smoothly along.</P>
<P>The government of the Haut Vallais
is democratic, being divided into seven
departments, each of which sends a
member chosen by the whole body of
the male inhabitants, above the age of
fourteen years, to the congress, which
is held twice a year, and is composed
of these seven members, the Bishop and
President of the Republic, who is chosen
by this assembly for two years. As these
deputies are named annually, and can
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
never swerve from the instructions they
receive from their constituents, there
seems nothing in the institution that is
unfavourable to liberty; but, unfortu∣nately,
the same vices that prevail in
the democracies of Switzerland, and the
Grisons, have also their influence in
the Vallais. This liberty, such as it is,
belongs to the Haut Vallais alone. A
rivulet that flows from the mountains
at some little distance below Sion, marks
the difference between the sovereign
and the subject.</P>
<P>At the close of the fifteenth century
the inhabitants of both the upper and
lower Vallais had joined their forces
to overthrow the power of the Bishop;
but quarrelling afterwards for the di∣vision
of the spoil, a bloody combat
ensued, and ended in the discomfiture
of the lower Vallais, which has remained
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>
subject since that period, and is go∣verned,
like other subjects of the Swiss
Cantons, by Bailiffs. Of this subjection
the lower Vallais is sometimes very
sensibly reminded by their sovereigns
of the mountains. About four years
since, these Vassals had so far forgot∣ten
their allegiance, as to break out
into open revolt; the Bailiff of Mon∣they,
having thought fit to throw one of
these subjects into prison because he
refused to pay an extraordinary fine,
the people of the lower Vallais con∣ceived
an opinion that they had a
right to rid themselves of both Bailiff
and Sovereigns. This act of treason and
rebellion was, however, punished in a
very exemplary manner. The demo∣crats
of the higher Vallais no sooner
heard of this atrocious attempt of their
subjects, than without deigning to use
the military appareil of cannon, or
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
waiting to organize an army, they
poured down from their mountains with
pitchforks, spades, threshing flails, and
ropes, as the Syracusans armed with
whips marched against their slaves, and
fell upon the insurgents without mode∣ration
or mercy.</P>
<P>The fate of war hung doubtful, when
the sympathetic government of Berne,
displaying a just horror at this disloyal
conduct, the poor Vallaisans being placed
between two fires, were compelled to
yield unconditional submission; and the
Chiefs of these new assertors of the rights
of man, expiated their crimes against
their irritated sovereigns at the gallows.</P>
<P>We went no further than Sion, which
is only the entrance of the higher
Vallais, and had therefore no opportu∣nity
of contemplating the Golden Age,
<PB N="188" REF="195"/>
which is said to be in full bloom above.
I have often admired the charming
picture which Rousseau traces of the
inhabitants of those regions; but I con∣fess
that the knowledge of the hanging
scene in the lower Vallais has very sen∣sibly
diminished my respect for the So∣vereigns
of the mountain. The iron
hand of oppression is not the only evil
that is felt by this subject-race; from
whatever causes, physical or moral, it
proceeds, a number of the inhabitants
are afflicted by the most humiliating
of all the visitations of heaven, Idiotism.
This state, unfelt by the individual, is
not even by his family considered as a
misfortune. The poor object, whose
stupid stare, lolling tongue, distorted
laugh, and inarticulated sounds, affect
the traveller with horror, is, from some
kind superstition, cherished in this re∣gion
as the favourite of heaven, and
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
secure of receiving all the tender cares
of humanity. Another spectacle of dis∣gust
which this country presents, is the
excrescence on the neck, known by
the name of Goitres, and which is often
associated with Idiotism. The lower
Vallais, notwithstanding the habitual in∣dolence
of the inhabitants, seems well
cultivated wherever it is capable of cul∣tivation.
This plain is sometimes buried
beneath the overflowing waters of the
Rhone, which, when swollen by the
torrents, disdain other shores than the
chain of mountains which bounds the
country. But whatever may be the
national or moral defects of this re∣gion,
the inhabitants seem to feel a strong
persuasion that they enjoy the peculiar
favour of the Supreme Being, and have
expressed this sentiment by inscribing
from the psalms, on the portal of the
town-house, in broad letters, “The Lord
<PB N="190" REF="197"/>
loveth the gates of <HI>Sion</HI> more than all
the tabernacles of Jacob.”</P>
<P>We had intended, on our return to
Martinach, to visit the Fathers on the
summit of the great St. Bernard, but
were prevented by hearing that a con∣siderable
quantity of snow had just fallen;
which, according to our host's informa∣tion,
would require two or three days
previous treading by other passengers,
before we ought ourselves to ascend.
This honest Vallaisan amused us with
a long history of the Lords and Dukes
whom he had led across those losty
regions; and, in order to inspire us at

us he had even conducted a prince of

Nothing alarmed us more during the

had already been tolerably taxed at
Bellinzone in consequence of the mag∣nificent
ideas of expence which our
landlord had acquired by conducting
the charming Duchess of Devonshire
over St. Gothard. We were perfectly
aware that the imperial honours and
trophies which bloomed around our host
at Martinach, portended no good to
our plebeian purses, and therefore, with∣out
waiting till the snows were har∣dened,
we ordered our horses and re∣turned

Fate of the Insurgents.</HEAD>
<P>WE passed the last fine days of au∣tumn
on the delightful banks of the
lake of Geneva, and after various ex∣cursions
in the Pays de Vaud, returned
by the Canton of Fribourg to Berne.</P>
<P>The general aspect of this country
presents inexhaustible beauties to the
lover of landscape; but no part of it
is more romantic than the town and
neighbourhood of Fribourg itself. We
had imagined that the first inhabitants
of Lausanne had selected the most in∣convenient
spot in the country on
which to build their city; but found
that the genius of the ancient Fri∣burghers
<PB N="193" REF="200"/>
had far surpassed them in this
species of choice. A small part of the
town is built on level ground, the rest
is perched among rocks and cliffs, form∣ing
an assemblage of the most grotesque
situations. The houses are in general
spacious, and well built; many of the
public edifices are dedicated to religion,
this Canton being eminently devout
and catholic. The Cathedral is re∣markable
for its solidity and elegance;
but the town, however agreeable to the
passing traveller from its picturesque
situation, wears a solitary and chearless
aspect.</P>
<P>The government of Fribourg, like those
of Lucerne and Soleure, is a confirmed
aristocracy. The power is centered in
the hands of a council of two hun∣dred,
who, with various divisions, and
subdivisions of authority, hold the ab∣solute
<PB N="194" REF="201"/>
sovereignty. Some modifications
were made in their original constitution
fifteen or sixteen years since, when the
inhabitants of the Canton, irritated at
the various depredations committed on
their persons and properties by that
portion of the sovereign called Bailiffs,
assembled together and besieged Fribourg
itself.</P>
<P>It is somewhat remarkable, that in a
long and varied excursion through Swit∣zerland,
a country which has been said
to produce Arcadian wealth and happi∣ness
to the lower classes, we should
scarcely have passed over a territory
which had not been the scene of a
revolt.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Canton of Fri∣bourg,
like those of the lower Vallais,
had not to struggle with their own ty∣rants
<PB N="195" REF="202"/>
alone; the sovereign council cooped
within its walls, might have been com∣pelled
to capitulate to its subjects, had
not the sympathetic sovereign council
of Berne, struck again with horror at
this unparalleled and sacrilegious outrage
committed against their ally, assembled
instantly its forces and marched to their
relief. The insurgents were of course re∣duced
to reason. The chiefs saved
themselves from the shame of a public
execution by throwing themselves with
desperation upon the bayonets of the sa∣tellites
sent to apprehend them; and va∣rious
punishments were inflicted on the
rest. The French ministry kindly lend∣ing
its asistance towards the preserva∣tion
of regular governments in Europe,
although it had at that period disco∣vered
a different policy with respect to
America, condescended to become the
public executioner of the vengeance of
<PB N="196" REF="203"/>
the Fribourg-magistracy, and sent their
victims to the gallies, whence they were
released by order of the first National
Assembly.</P>
<P>The insurgents being thus severely
punished, it is natural to suppose that
the wrongs of which they complained
were totally disregarded. Some small
changes were made in their constitution
that gave a greater extension of power
to those families in the sovereign coun∣cil
who possessed little or none previous
to this insurrection. To them the re∣bellion
proved of advantage; but the
people were left in the same subject
state, and were permitted, according to
a received opinion among the privileged
orders of the present day, to know no∣thing
of the laws but to obey them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Arrival at Berne.—Berne.—Government.—Mode of
Election.—Authorities.</HEAD>
<P>ON our arrival at the gates of Berne,
we were questioned with stern severity
respecting our country, our names, our
professions, whence we came, whither
we were going, and above all, what were
the motives of our visit. Nothing can be
more calculated to destroy all impressions
of Swiss freedom than this absurd kind of
police, which has so completely the air
of despotism, and which is particularly
disagreeable to an English traveller, who
recollects that in his own country, strang∣ers
from every quarter of the globe are
received without inquiry or distrust; and
are not subject to the impertinent inter∣rogations
of officers civil or military. The
town of Berne, although the capital only
<PB N="198" REF="205"/>
of a Canton, may, from its elegance, rank
with the capitals of extensive States; but
the public buildings, beautiful walks,
and sublime prospects of this city, have
often been described.</P>
<P>The French Revolution has had a con∣siderable
influence on the political con∣cerns
of Berne. The sovereignty of this
Canton, like that of the other aristocrati∣cal
Cantons of Switzerland, is centered in
a great council, a senate, which is a
division of the former, and of magistrates
chosen out of this latter body. The great
council, called the two hundred, is in
absolute possession of the sole and un∣divided
authority of the state, the imme∣diate
exercise of which is committed to
the senate, composed of twenty-seven
members. The vacancies in the senate
are filled up by the great council, as those
which take place among the members of
<PB N="199" REF="206"/>
this body are filled up by individuals,
chosen principally among the burghers of
Berne. The power of the government of
this Canton is the least limited of any in
Switzerland. In the great and important
interests of the state, both foreign and
domestic, such as levying taxes, or mak∣ing
war and peace, the citizens of Lu∣cerne,
Fribourg, and Soleure, assemble to
deliberate and decide; but at Berne
nothing is less sovereign than the people,
to whom, in no case, is any appeal made,
either for approbation or authority. All
places of honour, authority, or profit,
belong exclusively to seventy-six families
of Berne, of whom the great council is
composed; but as some of the families
who possess those vast and important pri∣vileges,
furnish twelve, fourteen, and
even twenty members, it is found that
seventeen families share at present the
majority of votes.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="207"/>
In the space of ten years, a vacancy in
the council of seventy or eighty members
takes place by death. At this period, an
electoral assembly, consisting of the great
officers of state, the senate, and sixteen
members of the great council whom it
names, proceed to the important nomina∣tion.
The choice of the state-officers,
and the senate, may be supposed to have
been long fixed on the members of their
own families, but who shall be the happy
mortal on whom the choice of the yet
unelected, and unknown <HI>sixteeners</HI> shall
fall? If the sixteener has a son of full age,
the business is of course decided; but if
he be only blessed with a daughter, his∣torians
relax from their dignity to describe
with what ardour of passion twenty as∣piring
youths, who, till that eventful
moment, had gazed upon the nymph
without emotion, become suddenly en∣amoured
of her charms. It must indeed
<PB N="201" REF="208"/>
be allowed, that marriages founded on
that obsolete scheme of happiness arising
from congenial character, and sympathy
of soul, and disdaining all views of in∣terest
or ambition, are quite as remote
from the speculations of the young men
of other great cities, as from those of
Berne. The only peculiarity in this in∣stance,
is, that the courtship begins and
ends in the space of four days, that being
the interval between the election of the
<HI>sixteener</HI> by the council, and his nomina∣tion
of his daughter's favoured lover;
who immediately becomes a substantial
portion of the sovereign, incumbered only
with the supplement of a wife.</P>
<P>Mr. Cox mentions, that in his first visit
he found the people of Berne by no
means so well informed as those of the
other Cantons of Switzerland; but that
the young Burghers, in order to acquire
<PB N="202" REF="209"/>
a knowledge of the art of governing, had
formed a society called the <HI>External
State,</HI> composed of a council, senate, and
officers of every rank; and that all that
was done by their fathers, who held the
real power, was imitated by their aspiring
sons. The offices also of profit were not
forgotten, and Bailiffs were named to
preside over the ruins of old castles that
are scattered through the Canton, in
order to prepare their governors for the
enjoyment of those splendid Bailliwicks
which are in good repair in their neigh∣bourhood.</P>
<P>In his second journey, made ten years
afterwards, Mr. Cox congratulates him∣self,
and his readers, that rouzed from
their lethargy, the magistrates had sent
to London to purchase instruments of ex∣perimental
philosophy, and had bought a
building for the reception of books. These
<PB N="203" REF="210"/>
wise regulations would no doubt, in due
time, have produced their proper effects.
Science would by degrees have infused its
benignant rays, and the elegance of
literary acquirements would at length
have banished the barbarous dialect of
their theological school, hitherto the
most cultivated branch of their public
education.</P>
<P>But the ample page of a new volume

we shall probably no longer see these
young patricians toiling through this
insantine probation in the art of govern∣ment,
the juvenile mimics of great and
little councils, Ammans, Avoyers, Grand
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
Sautiers, Seizeniers, Bannerets, and Bai∣liffs.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the chief magistracy
in every department of the state is ex∣clusively
chosen among the members of
the senate, we are informed by Mr. Cox,
that this body is far from enjoying the
absolute authority with which other
aristrocratical senates of Switzerland are
invested; and that the great council is in
a continual state of watchfulness over its
steps; that although aristocratical consti∣tutions
are often above all others the most
oppressive to the people, who instead of
one despot, are governed by an hundred
tyrants, Berne, and all the aristocracies
of Switzerland, are an exception to this
rule; that nothing is more wise and more
moderate than the spirit of their govern∣ments,
and nothing more remote from
arbitrary power, than the scrupulous at∣tention
<PB N="205" REF="212"/>
with which they respect the pri∣vileges
of their subjects.</P>
<P>To this testimony may be added that of
Mr. Burke, who asserts, that the Repub∣lic
of Berne is one of the happiest, most
prosperous, and best governed countries
on earth.</P>
<P>Such were the the general ideas enter∣tained
of the state of Liberty in Switzer∣land,
before the event of the French
Revolution. Since that period, an host
of facts are cited to prove opinions of a
very different complexion. It is now
asserted, that the freedom of Swiss go∣vernments
has been the subject of eulo∣gium
only because compared with the
other Republics of Europe; the name be∣stowed
on the small number of oligarchies,
the most considerable of which have lately
disappeared; the inhabitants of Switzer∣land
<PB N="206" REF="213"/>
enjoyed relative advantages; as the
glow-worm becomes a luminary when all
around is darkness. This important ques∣tion
is at present not only the theme of
much animadversion in France, but of
keen enquiry amongst the discontented
subjects of Berne in the Pays de Vaud.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Reclamations of the Pays de Vaud—Usurpation and ar∣bitrary
Conduct of the Canton of Berne.—Discontent
of the Nobles.</HEAD>
<P>THE inhabitants of the extensive and
delightful country of the Pays de Vaud,
have long since discovered in the re∣searches
of their history, that formerly
they enjoyed the benefits of a free con∣stitution,
which they assert was main∣tained
in all its purity, and respected by
their princes, till the epoch of the junc∣tion
of their territory to the Canton of
Berne, in the year 1536. They insist,
that the rights inherent in the assemblies
of the States were incontestible proofs of
the liberty of the people; that the Princes
of the House of Savoy were little more
than their nominal chiefs; and that when
their authority was transferred to the Can∣tons
of Berne, and Fribourg, it was ex∣pressly
<PB N="208" REF="215"/>
stipulated that this country should
retain all the privileges which it then
possessed. Hence arises the conclusion,
that these Cantons ought not to pretend
to the exercise of any other prerogatives,
than those which belonged to their
princes, and that the government ought
to be held by no other tenor, than it was
held at the epoch of the treaty.</P>
<P>As the Government of Berne has been
far from admitting the justice of these
claims, it may be conjectured, that vari∣ous
are the acts of illegal authority of
which these subjects have had to com∣plain.
The first blow given to the con∣stitution
of their country, say they, was
the division of the Pays de Vaud between
the two Cantons; which, by destroying
the unity of their government, prevented
the convocation of the states. In order
to root out ancient prejudices and attach∣ments,
<PB N="209" REF="216"/>
after this first great division had
taken place, various subdivisions were
made of the government of districts; and
the single Bailiff, or representative of the
Duke of Savoy, with very limited power,
was quartered out into twenty-nine sove∣reign
Bailiffs from the Cantons of Berne,
and Fribourg.</P>
<P>The people of the Pays de Vaud assert,
that, in consequence of this disorganiza∣tion
of their constitution, their governors
have instituted the most illegal and arbi∣trary
customs; that they have made mili∣tary
contracts with the various princes
of Europe for troops which are annu∣ally
recruited from the Pays de Vaud;
the command of which is monopolized
by the patrician families of Berne; that
the militia of the country has not only
been raised and organized, without its
permission, but in several instances has
<PB N="210" REF="217"/>
been made the instrument of the venge∣ance
and tyranny of their governors, or
the Cantons their allies; and that the
lucrative civil employments which were
originally but few, instead of being dis∣tributed
as formerly, among the citizens
of the country, are now confined to the
seventy-six reigning families of Berne,
and increased at pleasure according to
their wants or their avarice.</P>
<P>Heretofore, they continue, the States
of the Pays de Vaud made treaties of al∣liance
offensive and defensive with the
neighbouring powers. Payerne, Avenche,
the capital of antient Helvetia, and the
Republic of Lausanne, have successively
concluded treaties of alliance with Berne,
and but ten years previous to their junc∣tion,
were styled, according to the letter
of those treaties, their good friends, and
dear neighbours. This sentiment of
<PB N="211" REF="218"/>
friendship, and good neighbourhood, has
indeed, long since, given place to a
more intimate connection of another kind,
though with fewer feelings of reciprocal
affection.</P>
<P>These patriots seem to have no such
clear perception of the benefits which
have resulted to their country from this
connection, as the historian of the refor∣mation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abraham Ruschat, abregé de l'histoire ecclesias∣tique de Pays de Vaud, Vol. v. p. 667.</NOTE>, who, with some naiveté, ob∣serves
to the good people of Lausanne,
“that although what were called regal
rights, such as the right of pardon, of coin∣ing,
of raising troops, and other acts of
sovereignty and independence, were trans∣ferred
to Berne; yet as the treasure of
the cathedral, and the episcopal archives
were also transported thither, after due
confiscation of the estates of the clergy,
<PB N="212" REF="219"/>
a great door was opened to the inhabi∣tants
of Lausanne to come to the truth;
and that they ought to rejoice in the ad∣vantages
they received in return for those
temporal treasures, by the establishment
of the Reformation, advantages infinitely
precious, as they refer to the life to
come.”</P>
<P>The indignant patriots of the Pays de
Vaud, date the evils of which they com∣plain
from this period, which they sarcas∣tically
call the “blessed reformation;”
which, by dividing the opinions of the
people, sunk them more easily into sub∣jection.
They also tell us, that the eccle∣siastical
benefices of their country were
secularized to make aristocratical bene∣fices;
that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The decrees of the National Assembly declaring the estates of the church the property of the nation, which raised against them from the protestant govern∣ments in Europe, for the catholics were better inform∣ed, the cry of sacrilege and impiety was no where more severely cenfured than at Berne. Dr. Cart amuses himself with imagining the tenor of the con∣versations respecting these atrocious acts of injustice, that sometimes passed between the French emigrant Bishops and the Bailiff of Lausanne, the present pos∣sessor of the episcopal palace, in right of such sacrilegi∣ous confiscations at the Reformation; with this dif∣ference, that the estates of the Church in France were appropriated to pay the debts of the Nation, while here they were consecrated to form revenues for pri∣vate families, who were strangers to the country.</P>
<P>Among the victims of the Reformation in the Pays de Vaud, was the rich Prior of Romainmoitiers. He had some other possessions in Franche Comté, and flhed thither, when a Burgher of Berne, as Bailiff, took possession of his estates. Two hundred and sixty years after, the French Revolution leads his successors to seek refuge in Berne. Finding the government petri∣fied with horror at the atrocious acts of the Revolu∣tion, and particularly those which regarded the Church, the Abbé Petit Jean, observed, that they could give no proof more convincing of their detesta∣tion, than by ordering the present Bailiff who hap∣pened to be a General, to vacate a seat which belonged in right to a monk. The Abbé gained permission to examine the archives of his house, which were tran∣sported to Berne; and finding charters which proved his right to the priory, whilst he was looking for other documents, he had the simplicity to write a pamphlet to prove that the Government had no right to deprive the Church of the estates of his priory, or to appropriate them to its own service. The Chan∣cellor of Berne attested the conformity of the copies to the original; but as to restitution, the Government still continued exceedingly indignant at the atrocious decree of the National Assembly, which had forced the Abbé to leave his priory in Franche Comté.</P></NOTE> the sacred vases, the saints
<PB N="213" REF="220"/>
of silver and gold, the precious decora∣tions
of the episcopal church, and of
<PB N="214" REF="221"/>
their monasteries, were transported to
Berne; and that those offerings which
the piety of their ancestors had conse∣crated
to God, but which the pious his∣torian
of the reformation calls spoils from
Satan, were converted into long chains of
gold, to decorate the persons, as the
<PB N="215" REF="222"/>
other precious effects of the church had
been taken for the use, and now remain
heir-looms of patrician families. They
complain how little they have gained by
exchanging a Bailiff, for a Bishop; a
Burgher, for a Prince; the ministers of
their religion, and their convents of pious
vestals, consecrating their holy lives to the
service of heaven, for the dissipation and
luxurious domination of arrogant usurpers.</P>
<P>It is no more true, however, as the
present writers in favour of the liberty
of the Pays de Vaud, pretend, that the
true cause of the zeal of the reformers of
Berne is to be found in the rich spoils of
the church, which they meditated seiz∣ing
and transporting to their city, than
it is true that the sublime effort which
effected the French Revolution, had, as
some assert, its origin in the delirious
ambition of demagogues. Both the Re∣formation
<PB N="216" REF="223"/>
and the Revolution were
founded on principles more generous
than the gratification of sordid or selfish
passions, although these noble causes have
been sometimes sullied by the conduct of
their respective adherents.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that the
disciples of the Romish church discovered
no less abhorrence of the innovations at
that period, than the descendants of the
reformers of Berne feel for the reformers
of the present day. Luther, and the
Reformation, were then objects of no less
horror, than are now the French Propa∣gande,
and the Rights of Man. Only ten
years before the junction of the Pays de
Vaud to Berne, the states of the former
country, assembled at Moudon, within
a few leagues of Berne, decreed, that if
any one should buy any book, or propa∣gate
any doctrine of that cursed and
<PB N="217" REF="224"/>
disloyal heretic, Martin Luther, “he
should, in case of hardness and obstinacy,
be burnt alive, with the books, if such
were in his possession.”.</P>
<P>The government of Berne is accused
not only of having deprived the Vaudois of
their liberties, but of having drained them
of their money, by extorting arbitrary
contributions under the most frivolous
pretences; it appears from these calcu∣lating
patriots, that the families who
compose the Council of two hundred,
being in possession of all the lucrative
offices of the state, among which are sixty
Bailliwicks, share, in the space of six
years, a profit of upwards of six millions
of livres, which, with other employments,
yielding four millions more, make up
ten millions, to be divided amongst these
families, independent of the salaries arising
from their offices at Berne.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="225"/>
In addition to these proconsular en∣dowments,
of which, according to the
usual rate of compensation for services
to governments, there is perhaps not
much reason to complain, and on which
the celebrated Haller was too severe,
when he asserted that “the treasures of
the Republic were become the private
purse of the patrician,” <HI>socages, lods,
droits de main-morte, guet, et garde, corvées,</HI>
and other taxes, admirably calculated, as
Boileau said of those of Lewis the Four∣teenth,
to impoverish subjects, and enrich
dictionaries, weigh heavy on the Pays de
Vaud, and have occasioned murmurs so
loud and frequent from the Communes,
that the Burghers of Berne, at the epoch
of the French Revolution, promised that
these remonstrances should be taken into
due consideration.</P>
<P>In answer to the defenders of the right
of the absolute government of Berne over
<PB N="219" REF="226"/>
the Pays de Vaud, from its being a con∣quered
country, these Vaudois maintain
that such conquest was never effected.
They assert that when the Duke of Savoy,
in violation of the treaty of 1530, called
the Treaty of St. Julian, which was
formed to guarantee Geneva from future
invasion, had again taken arms, the
government of Berne found the Pays de
Vaud faithful to its alliance; not only
renewing the treaty at the moment when
war was declared by this government
against the Duke of Savoy, their nominal
Sovereign, but zealous in supporting the
cause for which the contest took place.
They contend, that instead of opposing
the projects of the government of Berne,
they had espoused its interest with
warmth; without suspecting that their
confederation against a faithless Prince
would have been construed by their ally
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
into a conquest over themselves; that
even if the final expulsion of the Duke
could be deemed a conquest of his rigi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,
as Protector, the privileges of the states,
which were at all times independent of
his power, could not by this event be
annulled.</P>
<P>There are other readings in history re∣specting
this event. It is acknowledged
that the vexations exercised against the
Genevans by the Duke of Savoy, had
afforded a just pretence for the inter∣position
of the Canton of Berne; but that
at the time of this pretended conquest,
the Duke was too busily employed in
resisting the invasion of his states by
Francis the First, to think of acting the
oppressor with respect to Geneva. The
occasion was nevertheless too favourable
to be omitted by Berne; the Pays de
<PB N="221" REF="228"/>
Vaud became absolutely dependent on
the will of its new Protector; and Ge∣neva
would have shared the same fate,
had it not redeemed its independence at
the expence of its purse.</P>
<P>It is moreover contended, that, as the
constitution of the Pays de Vaud was
never renounced by the inhabitants of
the state, or annulled by any decree of
the Cantons, admitting such decrees to
have had any authority, the present sub∣jects
of the government of Berne are
authorised to insist on the re-establish∣ment
of the antient constitution, and de∣mand
the convocation of the states, as
their only lawful representatives.</P>
<P>This disaffection of the Pays de Vaud,
it appears from the account given by Mr.
Cox, existed twenty years since. “The
<PB N="222" REF="229"/>
exclusion,” he observes, “of the nobility
of the Pays de Vaud, and of course of
the other inhabitants, from any share in
the administration of the state, occasioned
so great a discontent with the mild and
equitable government under which they
lived, that the greater part of the upper
classes were very willing to change their
republican, into a monarchical consti∣tution.”
It is not easy to judge of the
mildness and equity of a government,
where the majority would wish to get rid
of their republican servitude, in order to
enjoy monarchical liberty. It appears
that the true rendering of the passage,
as well as the true interpretation given to
the discontent, should be, that on ac∣count
of the vexations to which they
were compelled to submit, instead of
wishing to turn their republican into a
monarchical constitution, they would be
<PB N="223" REF="230"/>
happy to find an opportunity of changing

Having consulted the trans∣lation of the Second Tour, printed in Paris in 1790, not having the means of consulting the original, I found that this important fact respecting the Pays de Vaud is omitted. As Mr. Cox is always cited as an authority, it is probable that the translator in this instance, has been unfaithful; for, as Mr. Cox in∣forms us in his preface, that he has not only compared and examined all he had before written, and read every critique on his former work, but had also employed the most distinguished characters in politics and litera∣ture in each principal town to correct his errors, it can scarcely be suspected that any grave senator of Berne would have drawn his pen across his former account of the seditious spirit of the Pays de Vaud, as an error; or that so accurate an historian would have left un∣noticed the increase of that spirit of discontent, the existence of which he had already mentioned, and which has risen to so great a height as by its effects to menace even the existence of government.</NOTE>.</P>

Discontent of the People of the Pays de Vaud.—Cele∣bration
of the Anniversary of the French Revolution.—
Revolutionary Tribunals.</HEAD>
<P>THE administration of the govern∣ments
of Switzerland have been repre∣sented
as more mild and forbearing in
general than other governments of similar
construction. Although seditions have
frequently been punished with great se∣verity,
yet the implicit obedience of the
subject never fails of being rewarded by
the paternal protection of the state, the
members of which, since the event of the
French Revolution, have earnestly in∣culcated
the doctrine, that happiness is
to be found rather in tranquillity, than in
the turbulent freedom of equal rights.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="232"/>
This language is said to have lulled
a great part of the peasantry into the
persuasion that there is always a suffici∣ent
quantity of liberty where there is
peace. The peasantry in every country
is the class least given to inquiry; they
are affected by no events that do not im∣mediately
interest themselves, and are
therefore the last to entertain the spirit
of revolutionary enterprise; unless, when
driven to despair, which has sometimes
been the case, by the rapacity of their
proconsular governors.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of towns, on the con∣trary,
who are better informed, who
have nicer feelings, and a more intimate
knowledge of the events that are passing
in the world, are more quick-sighted
in guarding against abuses and encroach∣ments;
and from frequent association are
<PB N="226" REF="233"/>
more prepared to take advantage of
every favourable circumstance that may
offer to correct them.</P>
<P>In some parts of Switzerland the pea∣santry
enjoy a certain rank in society
above the peasantry of other countries;
and though they have no rights as citi∣zens,
possess some privileges, such as
that of bearing arms, on which they set
no little value. In the German part of the
Canton of Berne, this class, by which
is understood not merely labourers, but
the inhabitants of the country in gene∣ral,
known in England under the name
of yeomanry, being particularly favoured
by the government, are taught to look
up to their excellencies of Berne with
reverential awe and respect.</P>
<P>The solicitude of the government
for the welfare of its subjects is, how∣ever,
<PB N="227" REF="234"/>
extended to few other classes.
The manufacturer, less docile than the
peasant, is far from holding an equal
share in its affection. There is a spirit
in that class in all countries more fa∣vourable
to inquiry, and consequently
more hostile to unconditional submis∣sion;
while, therefore, the peaceful la∣bourer
of the glebe enjoys a kind of
privileged protection, every prudent me∣thod
has been adopted to dry up the
turbulent source of national wealth
which springs from manufactures or
commerce.</P>
<P>Although the peasantry form a very
respectable body of auxiliaries, the go∣vernment,
since the event of the French
revolution, have not been inattentive
in framing other alliances, in order to
strengthen their authority among their
subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="235"/>
The nobles of the Pays de Vaud, who,
previous to the year 1782, had been
flattered by the prospect of an acces∣sion
at some future period to a parti∣cipation
of the sovereign power, and
who since that epocha had lost every
hope of raising themselves above the me∣chanic
and the peasant, were, on the
event of the French Revolution, called
to share in the honours of the State,
by a decree that whenever five of the
partician families became extinct, the
void should be filled up by three fami∣lies
taken from the German, and two
from the French part of the Canton.
This admission to the dignity of the
burgher is followed by no solid patri∣cian
benefit, since none of the newly
elected members can obtain any profit∣able
employment for the space of fifty
years; but it was yet believed, that
the hope of this splendid elevation, al∣though
<PB N="229" REF="236"/>
it must be confined to a few,
would have sufficient influence to con∣ciliate
the whole. Having attempted
to form this truce with the nobles, the
government, faithful to the long esta∣blished
maxim of dividing and ruling,
is said to have fomented differences
amongst its subjects, by infusing into
the peasantry of the Pays de Vaud, a
salutary jealousy of their own municipal
authorities, who, it was insinuated, were
likely to assume a dangerous influence,
from which nothing could rescue the
former class but their stedfast adherence
to the supreme government.</P>
<P>Thus with consummate skill have
these sagacious burghers steered their po∣litical
bark amidst the storm of revolu∣tionary
principles, which breaking loose
from France, has inundated all Europe;
yet, notwithstanding all the arts of
<PB N="230" REF="237"/>
courtesies, and divisions, those principles
of independence which are implanted
in the human heart, and know no geo∣graphical
boundaries, have overleapt the
dyke which separates Switzerland from
France; and the discontents of the Pays
de Vaud have kept pace with the in∣creasing
spirit of general liberty.</P>
<P>When the French, who had long
been the ridicule of Europe for their
boasted attachment to the person and
authority of their despotic monarchs,
had shaken off this prejudice, and be∣come
clamorous for rights which they
had so lately learnt to value, the re∣formers
of the Pays de Vaud, whose
disrespect for their governors had been
restrained only by the fear of their power,
thought that the auspicious moment
was arrived when they might venture
to suggest the expediency of a review
<PB N="231" REF="238"/>
of their constitutional privileges. The
commune of Morges, in 1790, addressed
a memorial to this effect, on occasion
of some municipal abuses, to the patri∣cians
of Berne, and in justification of
their claims cited the charters of
Lewis of Savoy, Baron of Vaud, of Isa∣bella
of Chalons, of Amadeus the fifth,
the sixth, the seventh, and onwards, of
Philiberts and Charleses, to prove the
validity of their pretensions.</P>
<P>The frowns of the government, at
the display of such musty titles, some∣what
chilled this patriotic ardour; but
the flight of Lewis the XVIth to the
frontier having been celebrated by festi∣vals,
both civil and religious, at Berne
and Fribourg, the Patriots of the Pays
de Vaud fondly believed that it would
be considered as no infraction of their
allegiance, if they commemorated with
<PB N="232" REF="239"/>
civic rejoicings the anniversary of the
memorable 14th of July. This meeting
was publicly advertised; and, although
the agents of government, it is asserted,
endeavoured to prompt the assembly to
indiscretions by exaggerated allusions and
propositions, the day passed in tranquillity:
patriotic toasts were drank: French airs
were sung; and the hat, the symbol of
Swiss liberty, affixed on all the public
monuments of the State, was paraded
with universal acclamation.</P>
<P>This commemoration, which took
place at the same time in many towns
of the Pays de Vaud, gave serious alarm
to the government. There was no po∣sitive
law against festivals; but the ce∣lebration
of the 14th of July was an
event too big with consequences to be
passed over without animadversion; and
it was judged necessary to crush the
<PB N="233" REF="240"/>
progress of these seditious propensities.
Accordingly, on the first of September
following, a special tribunal, composed of
four patricians of Berne, under the
name of the high commission, was sent
into the Pays de Vaud, attended by a
numerous military train, to bring the of∣fenders
to trial.</P>
<P>They had flattered themselves that
the last wreck of their liberty, the rights
of criminal judicature, would have been
held inviolate, and remembered that
under the protection of the prince of
Savoy, when any contest arose between
the inhabitants and their chief, he was
compelled to submit to the decision of
their tribunals.</P>
<P>The government of Berne had, indeed,
already betrayed symptoms of a dispo∣sition
to severity, when on the accusa∣tion,
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
and by order of the tythe-gatherer,
a venerable pastor of a church had been
sent to the prisons of Berne, on the
charge of high treason, for maintaining
before his consistory that potatoes were
not wheat, and therefore not titheable;
but, although a reclamation against
taxes might with an appearance of jus∣tice
be construed into treason, since it
was a seditious opposition to sovereign
authority, the celebration of a festival
which thousands of their countrymen
were, as an act of duty and obedience,
celebrating at the same time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">14th July, 1791.</NOTE> in France,
would scarcely, they had imagined, be
so misinterpreted.</P>
<P>Cannon charged with grape-shot, and
planted at the end of their principal
streets; the houses of the Patriots con∣verted
into barracks for the military,
<PB N="235" REF="242"/>
and the arbitrary orders issued for ar∣rests,
soon taught the inhabitants of
Lausanne that their sovereign had no
taste for such compliments to the French
nation so near their own territory. In
vain the people of the Pays de Vaud
inquired what was the crime of their
newly invaded country? Had they been
in insurrection? Had they taken arms
against the burghers of Berne? Had they
disobeyed any of their orders? Had
they shown any marks of disrespect to
their bailiffs? Had they sent to their
faithful ally of three hundred years, de∣putations
of congratulation like the po∣pular
societies of the English nation,
heretofore their natural enemies? None
of these extravagancies had they com∣mitted.
Something, indeed, like a spirit
of insubordination, though not to the ex∣tent
of the incredulity of the pastor of
Mezieres, had discovered itself in humble
<PB N="236" REF="243"/>
representations against certain abuses in
taxation; and they had drank to the
success of the French revolution, but
without ever conjecturing that those acts
could justify an arraignment before such
a tribunal.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Trial of the Members of the Festival.—Condemnation
of M. de La Harpe.—His subsequent History.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST those who had been most
industrious in promoting a spirit of in∣quiry
in the Pays de Vaud, relative to
the abuses of government, was M. de La
Harpe, Baron of Yens, and Mutens,
whose family had been always in the
number of those who had asserted, though
without effect, the independence of their
country.</P>
<P>The high court opened its commission
at Rolle, a little town on the Lake of
Geneva, and within a few steps of M. de
La Harpe's Chateau, and had already sent
two respectable citizens to the dungeons
of Chillon; when apprized of his own
<PB N="238" REF="245"/>
danger, he escaped at the very moment
that an armed boat appeared in view to
convey him to the same prison.</P>
<P>M. de La Harpe went to Geneva,
whence he wrote to the Bailiff of his
district, that having received the most
pressing warnings of his own personal
danger, and seeing little hope of establish∣ing
proofs of his innocence, when already
persons arbitrarily arrested had, without ac∣cusation
or proof, been sent to the prisons
of Chillon, he had thought it prudent to
withdraw himself in order to prevent the
same injustice from being exercised on his
own person; and that having also been
long afflicted with rheumatic pains, he
feared the damps of the dungeons of Chil∣lon
would prove fatal to his health. He
observed to the Governor, that his retir∣ing
to Geneva ought not to be construed
into flight from justice; that he had
<PB N="239" REF="246"/>
taken this step in order to silence the
calumnies of his enemies, who would
have construed his concealment in any
part of his country, now overwhelmed
with consternation and despair, into pro∣jects
of exciting insurrection; that he was
ready to appear before any legal tribunal
the moment assurances were given, that
protection would be afforded to inno∣cence,
and the lives and privileges of the
subject be preserved.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de La Harpe was probably of the opinion of Charles the Sixth's Confessor, to whom the unhappy Monarch expressed his astonishment, that justice had condemned his minister Montagne to death. “Sire, replied the Monk, he has not been tried <HI>by justice,</HI> but only by a <HI>commission.”</HI> Hist. de France, par Veltra, Vol. xiii. p. 31.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No other notice was taken of this let∣ter
by his judges, than summoning him
twice to appear before their tribunal.
<PB N="240" REF="247"/>
On his non-appearance, a bill for high
treason was found against him, to which
he answered by a memorial, stating that
he demanded neither favour or pardon,
since it was a criminal only who stood in
need of either; that secure in his inno∣cence,
he claimed again what he had at
first invoked, a just and legal tribunal;
and would continue to demand it to his
latest breath. This answer to the accusa∣tion
was accompanied with a copy of
the memorial, and a letter to the Avoyer
or President of the Government at Berne,
containing the same declarations which
he had already made to the Governor of
his own district.</P>
<P>The Burghers, after a deliberation of
nine months, and a thorough examina∣tion
of the evidence against him, found
M. de La Harpe guilty “of having, by
indirect means, shewn a disposition to
<PB N="241" REF="248"/>
persuade divers folk to make claims, of
which some, under <HI>specious</HI> appearances,
tended directly to overturn the present
constitution of the country;” and also
“of having celebrated the festival of the
14th of July, when the signals of insur∣rection
were displayed, in order to ex∣cite
and seduce our faithful subjects,”
and therefore condemned M. de La Harpe
to be beheaded, and ordered his property
to be confiscated to the profit of the
state. The high commission had pre∣viously
condemned some members of this
festival to the galleys, some to twenty-five
years imprisonment in the dungeons
of Chillon, and others to punishments less
severe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The company of young men whom, three years after this period, we met on our approach to Vevay, and supposed to be Frenchmen who had crossed the Lake to spend an holiday, were young citizens of Vevay, who presuming too much on the relaxed ener∣gies of the government, had amused themselves by singing revolutionary songs, and displaying the sig∣nals of French liberty, unmindful of the vigilant Bailiff, who, “broke the good meeting with most admired disorder,” and caused some of the party to be imprisoned, and others banished.</NOTE>.</P>

We will leave the Baroness of Auvin,
the wife of M. de La Harpe, with her
six children, at the feet of the council of
Berne, suffering the last sad aggravation
of calamity, while forced to implore, not
the repeal of the fatal sentence against
the life of her husband, which she had
invoked in vain, but to solicit the revoca∣tion
of that part only, which related to
the confiscation of his property, and
which, if put in force, must reduce her∣self
and her infants to all the horrors of
poverty. We will leave awhile this deso∣late
supplicant, and follow the convict to
the end of his career.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="250"/>
M. de la Harpe, receiving no answer to
his reclamations against the tribunals,
sought refuge in the French camp, where
he was hailed as a martyr, and named
Chief of a battalion of the volunteers of
the Seine and Oise, at the close of the
year 1791. In the following year, he
commanded the advanced posts at the
castle of Rodemak on the extreme fron∣tiers
of France, and, receiving the first at∣tacks
of the coalesced armies on their
march into the Republic, was exposed to
imminent danger by the sudden and un∣expected
surrender of the two frontier
towns of Longwy and Verdun. Without
hopes of making any effectual resistance,
La Harpe was resolved to give the first
example of that devotedness which the
friends of Liberty owe to her cause, and
found no difficulty in communicating
this enthusiasm to his soldiers. They all
swore on his sword, that they would never
<PB N="244" REF="251"/>
capitulate; and if, when reduced to the
last extremity, they could not force their
passage, that they would bury themselves
with the enemy under the ruins of the
castle, the subterraneous passages of which
they had converted into mines.</P>
<P>This generous resolution was prevented
from being carried into effect by General
Luckner, who ordered the post to be eva∣cuated,
and the artillery and ammunition
to be transported to Thionville. The
order was executed by La Harpe, in sight
of the enemy, who had possession of all
the surrounding posts; and the address
and courage with which it was executed
gained him the appellation of the “brave
La Harpe,” a title which was bestowed
on him by the General at the head of the
army.</P>
<P>After the expulsion of the coalesced
armies in the North, he fought for more
<PB N="245" REF="252"/>
active service, and took a command in
the army of the Alps. At the siege of
Toulon he was appointed to command
the attack on Fort Pharo, which he
carried by assault, and forced the English
to evacuate the post; upon which he was
made General of Brigade.</P>
<P>On his return to the army of Italy, he
took the command of the advanced guard,
and opened the communication with
Genoa, by defeating the Austrians at
Cairo, in 1794. In the beginning of the
following year he was appointed to con∣duct
the expedition which was destined
to relieve Corsica; but this plan being
relinquished, he resumed his former po∣sition
in the army of Italy, which, at
this period reduced to two thirds less
than the Austrian army, was compelled
to retreat. In this perilous situation, La
Harpe conducted himself with so much
<PB N="246" REF="253"/>
skill, as to defeat his pursuers at Vado,
and took such positions with his en∣feebled
force, that the Austrian General,
who had assured himself of the conquest
of Provence, was compelled to give up his
projected invasion.</P>
<P>La Harpe, now raised to the rank of
General of Division, kept possession of the
line of defence, which he had traced out,
till reinforcements arrived, and the com∣mand
of the army devolved on Buona∣parte.</P>
<P>That the military skill and valour of La
Harpe powerfully contributed to ensure
the first successes of that immortal cam∣paign,
has been recorded by Buonaparte
himself, and therefore belongs to history.
The Directory acknowledged the obliga∣tions
of the Republic to La Harpe for his
eminent services, in formal letters of con∣gratulation
<PB N="247" REF="254"/>
to himself, and his son, a
youth of sixteen years of age, who fought
at his side. But the most noble instance
of his magnanimity was the friendly and
cordial reception which he gave the
officers of the Swiss regiment of Stetler,
made prisoners at Mandovi, some of whom
had voted his proscription. “I hope,”
said this illustrious convict to his judges,
“that at no distant day, we shall meet
together in Switzerland as friends.”</P>
<P>That day, alas, will never arrive! In
the midst of his career of glory, La Harpe
fell by the hands of his own soldiers, who
mistook him and his troop, in the dark∣ness
of the night, on their return from
repelling a sudden attack of the enemy,
for the enemy themselves. The loss of
this brave officer overwhelmed the army
with consternation and sorrow. Buona∣parte,
in the relation he sent of this un∣happy
<PB N="248" REF="255"/>
event to the Directory, declared,
that “the Republic had lost a citizen
firmly attached to its interests, the army
one of its best generals, and every soldier
a comrade who was as intrepid in action,
as he was in discipline severe.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not unworthy of remark, that, among the Generals who have rendered themselves the most illustrious in the defence of the French Republic, we find the names of Italians, English, Scotch, Irish, and Germans; such as Kleber, Macdonald, Kilmain, Sherlock, and Massena. In the present instance, a Corsican pays the tribute of his praises and regrets to a Swiss. The friend of liberty, whatever may be his na∣tive soil, considers every free state as his country. It may also be observed, to the honour of foreigners, that amongst those who have devoted themselves to the cause of liberty, the instances are rare of such as have rendered themselves unworthy of the service. I have indeed, from being myself deceived, missed my readers in the first volume of my Letters on Revolutionary Government, respecting an officer once employed in the French service, and well known both in England and France. It is with keen regret that I am com∣pelled to retract those opinions, having since their pub∣lication received the most decisive evidence of that General's want of every principle of honour and integrity. This evidence has lately been confirmed by the relation given me by Mr. Muir, and other gentlemen, whose testimony, relying on facts col∣lected during their residence in the Spanish dominions in South America, leave me no alternative to the task, however painful, of undeceiving those whom I may heretofore have misled.</NOTE></P>

We have left Madame de La Harpe
at the feet of the burghers of Berne,
imploring their mercy for the support of
her children. Buonaparte, after the
death of her husband, became a suppliant
in the petition; and it was then readily
admitted that there was a mistake in
the sentence, and that the property of
General La Harpe had never been con∣fiscated.
Had the hero of Italy pushed
<PB N="250" REF="257"/>
the inquiry a little further, the govern∣ment

that the sentence was altogether

<P>THE severity of the government of
Berne towards the members of the festi∣val
of the fourteenth of July, by the in∣troduction
of cannon, and revolutionary
tribunals, called by one of their writers,
“The art of governing possessed in an
eminent degree by the administration of
Berne, and nearly lost in the rest of
Europe,” has added an inexhaustible stock
of fuel to that discontent, which, Mr.
Cox asserts, led the upper classes, twenty
years since, to wish for a monarchical
government. Their descendants, how∣ever,
partaking of the contagion of the
<PB N="252" REF="259"/>
times, openly demand, with no tempered
language or dissembled phrases, the aid of
a foreign power, to establish a system of
republican independence. With this view,
they claim the guarantee made by the
French nation in 1565, in confirmation
of the treaty of Lausanne, concluded the
preceding year between Philibert, the
successor of Charles the Third, Duke of
Savoy, and the Swiss Cantons.</P>
<P>In that treaty the Prince made a
formal renunciation of whatever title he
claimed to the Pays de Vaud, upon re∣gaining
possession of the Pays de Gex,
Bresse, and other districts, which con∣tinued
to enjoy those privileges under
the domination of Savoy and France, of
which their fellow subjects, the Vaudois,
were deprived under the paternal pro∣tection
of the government of Bernc. As
that engagement was cited in the treaty
<PB N="253" REF="260"/>
of 1582, so all foregoing intermediate
treaties were confirmed by the last
treaty of 1777, made at Soleure. France,
which, as well as the House of Savoy,
became by those treaties the guarantee
of the liberties of the Pays de Vaud, is
now the legal representative of that
house, by the late peace of 1796. The
popular party in the Pays de Vaud
therefore assert, that if France, when a
monarchy, protected for more than two
centuries the usurpation of the patricians,
France, now a republic, will fulfil her
engagements in favour of the rights of
the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The glory of giving independence to his country, if that event takes place, will chiefly belong to Colonel La Harpe, the cousin of the General. A re∣sidence of twelve years in the court of Russia, and the menaces of the government of Berne, seem only to have strengthened and confirmed in Colonel La Harpe the most ardent zeal for the cause of liberty.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="261"/>
To incite the government of France to
an examination of the treaties, by which
their liberties are said to be guaranteed,
they have been industrious in shewing, not
only how much it is the interest of the
Republic, that this information should
take place, but that its honour is engaged
to avenge the numerous insults and in∣juries
committed by these Cantons during
the present contest.</P>
<P>But of insults and injuries the Swiss
also complain; the massacre of a part of
their troops on the 10th of August; the
dismission of the rest; the withdrawing
the annual subsidy from the catholic Can∣tons;
the release of the Fribourg insur∣gents
from the gallies; the triumph of
the soldiers of the regiment of Chateau∣vieux;
and the <HI>propagande,</HI> have been
urged as grounds of discontent, and justi∣fications
even of enmity.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="262"/>
To these charges it has been answered,
that the massacre of the Swiss, admitting
it to be a massacre. was the consequence
of a popular insurrection, in which, as
the Swiss regiment of guards had been
dismissed by the assembly two months
previous to the catastrophe, they ought
not to have taken part. That the dis∣missal
of the remainder was become neces∣sary
for their own safety; that the hire∣ing
of foreign soldiers to fight in a cause
not their own, was contrary to every
principle of humanity; and that their
dismissal was accompanied with a strict
regard to justice in the full indemnities
and pensions paid to the officers and sol∣diers.
With respect to the other charges,
it is observed, that the Constituent As∣sembly,
in releasing the Fribourghers, had
only wiped off the stain of the old go∣vernment
which had sent them to the
gallies; that the soldiers of Chateau-vieux
<PB N="256" REF="263"/>
were the blind dupes of a faction,
and that the dreaded <HI>propagande</HI> never
existed.</P>
<P>If, notwithstanding these explanations, it
be contended, that the balance of national
wrongs were yet against the French, it is
asserted that the Swiss have amply settled
the account. From the beginning of the
Revolution, the governments, democra∣tical
as well as aristocratical, háave been
its decided enemies. Not only were the
Swiss soldiers in the service of France
compelled, on their temporary visits to
their country, to divest themselves of the
national cockade which formed a part of
their uniform, but Frenchmen themselves
were constrained to hide every symbol
of liberty, in order to avoid being ex∣posed
to insult. Although affording an
asylum to the unfortunate is a debt which
both governments and individuals owe to
<PB N="257" REF="264"/>
humanity, yet the warm welcome given
to the French emigrants by the Cantons
of Berne, Soleure, and Fribourg, might
be considered by France as an infringe∣ment
of national friendship, if not of
neutrality. It was in these Cantons that
the emigrant army took its rise, and
almost on the French frontier, under
the eyes of the officers of their govern∣ments,
that the most active agents of the
counter-revolution established their offices
of correspondence. The patricians of
those Cantons took part even in the
measures of the coalition, although their
instructions were framed in so indirect a
manner as to be disavowed according to
circumstances. The reality of the engage∣ments
they had taken ought further to be
presumed, from the indirect praises be∣stowed
on their conduct, in the famous
answer addressed by the French Princes
to Louis the Sixteenth, at the close of
<PB N="258" REF="265"/>
the year 1791, which contained a de∣tailed
enumeration of the powers on
which the Monarch might rely for the
re-establishment of his authority. Al∣though
complaints were made of this
publication, it is insisted that the adhe∣sion
was not the less founded, and that
the cession of certain portions adjoining
the Swiss territory, was promised to these
Cantons in the general division of France,
which, from the force of the coalition,
it was presumed would speedily take
place. These engagements, continue the
reformers, were kept secret till the inva∣sion
of Savoy by the French, when under
pretence of securing the independence of
Geneva, the patricians of Berne lined
the frontiers of the department of Ain,
and the Jura, with numerous armies,
intending to pour them into that quarter
as soon as the Prussians and Austrians,
who were then in Champagne, should
<PB N="259" REF="266"/>
have passed Chalons. This attempt was
discovered and defeated by the Minister
Claviere, to whom, it must be observed,
the Swiss attribute the design, not only
of invading Geneva, but of pursuing the
conquest into the territory of the Pays de
Vaud; which project they assert was pre∣vented
by the disobedience of Montes∣quieu,
who commanded the French army
in that quarter, and by the moderation of
the Ambassador<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>These warlike preparations on the part of the Canton of Berne, it is said, was a measure only of self-defence. Mr. Burke, who is in this case an un∣doubted authority, informs us, that the Canton of Berne began very early to act on the <HI>defensive.</HI> The import of this phrase is now pretty generally under∣stood. Of the notion which the leading patricians of Berne had of acting on the <HI>defensive,</HI> something may be learnt from a letter of M. Mallet du Pan, to Marshall Castries, dated Sept. 17, 1792. By this letter, intercepted and deposited in the Archives of the French Government, it appears that Swiss troops, on the deliverance of the King from his captivity, of which at that period no doubt was entertained, were to have the exclusive honour of guarding the royal person. The writer of this letter observes, that as military government must for some time necessarily be established in France, it was expedient to appoint such men to places of confidence, as had sufficient nerve to execute the trust; and that M. D' Erlach, the Bailiff of Lausanne, whom he regarded as the Providence of the Pays de Vaud, and with whom the French emigrants had found more than protection, had yielded to his representations, and demanded from the Count d' Artois the command of the guards.</P>
<P>It may be observed, that the actions of individuals ought not to be imputed to the Government, and that M. Mallet du Pan, and M. D' Erlach, might have formed plans and conspiracies against France, which the Government, had it discovered, would have disavowed and reprobated. To this observation it may be re∣joined, that although these plots and conspiracies were matters of the most public notoriety, they were never disavowed on the part of the Government of Berne; and therefore to prevent such <HI>providences,</HI> as M. D' Erlach, and M. Mallet du Pan, from acting on the <HI>defensive,</HI> and superintending affairs at Paris, would have justified the interposition of the French, admit∣ting that such interposition had ever been intended.</P></NOTE> of France.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267"/>
The popular party maintained, that the
Governors of these Cantons not only
<PB N="261" REF="268"/>
omitted no occasion of testifying their
hostile dispositions towards the French,
but were guilty of various intractions of
their neutrality. When the manifesto
of the coalition, say they, was answered
by the proclamation of the existence of
the Republic, not only were divers indi∣viduals
ordered to quit the Swiss territory,
but the French ambassador was compelled
to leave Soleure, and submit to be tole∣rated
at Baden. When Denmark, Swe∣den,
and even Prussia, and Spain, had
acknowledged the French Republic, the
patricians of those Cantons were stedfast
in their loyalty to what was called <HI>ex∣ternal
France,</HI> its political and ecclesias∣tical
<PB N="262" REF="269"/>
hierarchy, and its king; and the
existence of such a Republic was con∣sidered
as a capital heresy, till the victo∣rious
arguments of Moreau and Buona∣parte
removed these fondly cherished
scruples.</P>
<P>The arrest of the ambassador Semon∣ville,
on the territory of the Grisons, by
the Austrians, was a manifest violation
of the neutrality, which the French at
that time had not the means of resent∣ing.
This infraction had been preceded
by another, when, on the expulsion of
the Piedmontese troops from Savoy, a
Swiss regiment effected its escape across
the lake, and returned to join the main
army in the valley of Aoste, through the
territory of Berne, and the Vallais, with∣out
any punishment being inflicted on
the commanders, or the Bailiffs resident
in that territory. Encouraged by impu∣nity,
<PB N="263" REF="270"/>
these allies suffered a bolder stroke
to be attempted, when the defection of
Dumourier, in 1793, had opened the
northern frontier to the enemy, and the
Republic was torn on every side by inter∣nal
war and divisions, it was suggested that
the invasion of Savoy, where the French
army was considerably weakened, would,
independently of the recovery of the
territory, operate a powerful diversion, and
renew the theatre of war in that part
of France.</P>
<P>The plan of forcing the desiles of
Mount Cenis, and the post of St. Bernard,
by two strong columns, which should
penetrate into the Maurienne, and the
Tarentaise, and form their junction
towards Mont-Melian and Chamberry,
was concerted with the march of a third
column from the valley of Aoste to that
of Faussigny, which would render the
<PB N="264" REF="271"/>
defence of those desiles more difficult for
the French, and might even force them
to abandon their position. Two obstacles
seemed to impede this plan; a formida∣ble
Glacier, and the Swiss neutrality;
both to all appearance insurmountable:
for if the Glacier could not be scaled,
there was no means of reaching the
French but across the neutral territory.
The Glacier was inflexible in its neu∣trality,
but the King of Sardinia, it ap∣pears,
had discovered the dissolving tem∣perature
of the allies of France, and the
Piedmontese pilgrims, with their mules
loaded with arms, baggage and amuni∣tion,
shook the snows off their feet on the
Swiss side of the great St. Bernard, and
ascending by the Col de Balme, the last
boundary of the territory of the Vallais,
resumed the dress of the soldier, and
aided by the hunters of the country, sur∣prised
the French in the valley of Faus∣signy,
<PB N="265" REF="272"/>
penetrated to Bonneville, within
five leagues of Geneva, and in three days
were in the rear of the Republican army,
before the French had any knowledge of
the expedition. The success of this plan
would have been complete, and the
French magazines would have been ne∣cessarily
taken, had the enterprise been
supported by reinforcements of cavalry
to keep up the insurrection which had
previously been fomented in Savoy.</P>
<P>The want of address in the Sardinian
troops, and the valour of the French,
forced these pilgrims to a second journey
across the Swiss territory, over St. Ber∣nard,
which retreat was effected with
the same open violation of neutrality,
without opposition from the Swiss, or
pursuit by the French, although invited
by the people of the lower Vallais to
seize that opportunity of helping them
<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
to shake off their yoke, for which at∣tempt
ten of the insurgents had been
lately hanged, and seven sent to the
gallies. As that part of the Swiss terri∣tory,
in which these events took place,
belonged to the government of the
Vallais, the patricians of that district
took upon themselves the whole merit
of the enterprise, in which the go∣vernment
of Berne, as if succeeded so
ill, were not solicitous to claim their
share.</P>
<P>It is true that the Swiss soldiers who
were employed to aid this expedition,
struck with the dishonour of the action, re∣volted
against their commander, and
made complaints, which were prudently
hushed; it is true also that this officer
so far incurred the animadversion of his
government as to provoke a sentence
against him, which it is said, from its
<PB N="267" REF="274"/>
mildness, proved their assent and appro∣bation.
Mr. D' Erlach, the principal in
this project, received a box set in dia∣monds
from the King of Sardinia, and
was soon after raised to the dignity of
a senator of Berne.</P>
<P>These are a few among the nume∣rous
charges brought by the discontented
chiefs of the Pays de Vaud against the
governments of Switzerland, particularly
that of their own Canton, in order to
lead the government of France to the
examination how far such allies are
worthy of the continuance of its friend∣ship.
These popular leaders insist, at
the same time, that the Swiss nation
has been guilty of no other offence
against France than that of being passive
and involuntary instruments in the hands
of their masters; and that they have in
general displayed a lively interest in
<PB N="268" REF="275"/>
the fate of France, and the success of
the revolution.</P>
<P>Those Patriots, while they appear so
solicitous to prompt the French to
avenge their wrongs, do not forget what
is wanting to remedy their own; and
lest the French government should have
any hesitation respecting the propriety of
interposing in the internal concerns of
independent countries, or should not
seize the full force and meaning of these
antiquated charters, various precedents
are adduced of the interest taken by
the patricians of Berne in settling dis∣putes
between governors and subjects in
other states. Such was their interposi∣tion
in favour of the French monarchy,
against the Patriots of Geneva; in favour
of the patricians of Fribourg, against the
inhabitants of the Canton; in favour of
the governors of the upper Vallais, against
<PB N="269" REF="276"/>
their subjects; in favour of the bishop of
Basil, against the people of the bishop∣rick;
in favour of the King of Prussia,
against Neufchatel; in favour of the de∣mocrats
of Uri, against the Val de Le∣vantine;
and of the burghers of Zurich,
against the people of the lake.</P>
<P>What reasons can the government
of Berne produce why other powers
should not exercise also the same right
of interference with respect to their
subjects? especially when by written
treaties those powers have become secu∣rities
for the preservation of their rights?</P>
<P>Such is the long list of transgressions
against the privileges of equal freedom
which these Patriots of retentive memory
have brought forward against the go∣vernment
of Berne, and such the reme∣dies
which they propose for their poli∣tical
<PB N="270" REF="277"/>
evils. Whether the French Re∣public
will accede to this invitation, and
render the Pays de Vaud independent
of Berne, is a secret which the book of
destiny will perhaps are long unfold.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it is natural to con∣clude,
that the principles of that mighty
revolution which have already diffused
themselves over remote regions of the
globe, cannot fail to expand in those
countries which are placed immediately
within their influence. Since the period
of the French revolution, ages have flitted
before our eyes, and we have risen sud∣denly,
like the offspring of Deucalion,
from infancy to manhood, not without
indications it must be confessed, of the
hardened origin whence we sprung.
Like the traveller, who from the scorch∣ing
plains, climbs the rocks that lead
him to the regions of eternal snow,
<PB N="271" REF="278"/>
and finds that in the space of a few
hours he has passed through every suc∣cessive
latitude, from burning heat to
the confines of the frozen pole, the
journey of months; so the human mind,
placed within the sphere of the French
revolution, has bounded over the rug∣gedness
of slow metaphysical researches,
and reached at once, with an incredi∣ble
effort, the highest probable attain∣ments
of political discovery.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH, considered under cer∣tain
points of view, nothing can be more
defective than the governments of Swit∣zerland,
in which there are no consti∣tutions,
and no criminal laws; where
civil legislation is incomplete, inconstant
and complicated; where every thing is
arbitrary; where liberty, of which so
vain a boast has been made, is so lit∣tle
understood; where the absolute res∣traint
put on the press, and the into∣lerance
exercised with respect to reli∣gious
opinions, have stiflted every at∣tempt
to promote a more liberal edu∣cation,
and foster more benevolent and
enlarged sentiments; it must be re∣marked,
that the practice of these go∣vernments
has happily not always cor∣responded
with their theory. Some∣times,
<PB N="273" REF="280"/>
times, when the spirit of despotism
would have exercised its fury, the
means of execution have been wanting.
Although accustomed to the yoke, the
people who bear arms in their hands, a
privilege of no little value, have occa∣sionally
hinted to their governors that
they must not make that yoke too
heavy. The smallness of their towns,
the social connection of the inhabitants,
the union which exists between them
and the inhabitants of the country,
where no intrigue interrupts the har∣mony,
have kept alive some sparks of
public spirit sufficient to arrest the
march or interrupt the progress of those
governments towards absolute despotism,
independent of other considerations arising
from local or accidental circumstances,
which have often determined them to
moderation.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="281"/>
Hence we observe in Switzerland
more cultivation, ease and prosperity,
than we should see in arbitrary go∣vernments
where theory is strengthened
by pratice. But it must be remem∣bered
that this general effect is no evi∣dence
of security to the individual. In
a country where liberty is neither guard∣ed
by laws, nor by social institutions,
there may exist a sort of public mode∣ration
which spares the great mass, but
gives no positive protection.</P>
<P>The security of these governments
has arisen from the experience that pri∣vate
and insulated injustice have caused
no general murmur, and they have che∣rished,
like other governments, the false
principle, that because they are in mo∣tion,
they shall therefore never cease
to move. The French revolution has
displayed the fallacy of this belief; but
<PB N="275" REF="282"/>
the great changes which have lately
taken place in Italy, are said to have
had a far more powerful influence on
Switzerland, than all those by which
they were preceded; since the revo∣lution
itself only overthrew an absolute
monarchy, which admitted of sew points
of comparison with the constitutions of
Switzerland; but the subversion of those
aristocracies, which have always been re∣presented
as happy models of a part of
the Swiss governments, have awakened
new ideas in that country, of which the
effects are already sensibly perceived.
Should a spark from the blaze of French
liberty fall on those combustible mate∣rials,
it may kindle into a flame; and
if it be the policy of the French Re∣public
to give itself a moral as well as
a geographical frontier, its friendly in∣tercourse
with Switzerland will pro∣bably
mould the various governments of
<PB N="276" REF="283"/>
that country into forms of nearer simi∣litude
to its own.</P>
<P>In the preceding sketch, sufficiently
imperfect from the inability of the writer,
many voluntary omissions will also be
observed. I have said nothing of the
Confederation which binds the Cantons of
Switzerland together; of the barbarous
policy so well known, and so often re∣probated,
of selling the lives of their ci∣tizens
to foreign powers; and have en∣tered
into no detailed history of its go∣vernments,
because I wished carefully
to avoid telling what others have told
better.</P>
<P>With sincere reluctance I bade Swit∣zerland
farewell. Who can leave such a
country without regret? If we find its
governments defective, or its societies
dull, there is always a resource against
<PB N="277" REF="284"/>
every feeling of dislike, or of weariness,
in the meditation of that glorious scenery,
the view of which renders the mind in∣sensible
to human evils, by lifting it be∣yond
their reach. Switzerland has opened
to me a new world of ideas; its land∣scapes
are indelibly impressed upon my
memory; whenever the delighful images
of nature present themselves to my ima∣gination
I find that I have been thinking
only of Switzerland; and whenever I
amuse myself in that sort of visionary ar∣chitecture,
called castle-building, my cha∣teau
is always seated at the foot of an
Alpine hill, a torrent stream rolls invisibly
past the dwelling, and an enormous gla∣cier
lifts its snows in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>In that memorable winter, which
turned the waters of Holland into dry
ground, we passed through Franche
Comté, on our way to Paris; not without
<PB N="278" REF="285"/>
considerable danger from the wolves, which
the severity of the frost had brought down
from the Jura into the plains, and impelled
to attack the unguarded traveller.</P>
<Q><L>“Cruel as death, and hungry as the grave,</L>
<L>Burning for blood! bony, and gaunt, and grim!”</L></Q>
<P>A general thaw which took place the
night we reached Besanson, and rendered
the roads for some days impassable, de∣tained
us agreeably with the accomplished
and hospitable family of one of my fellow
travellers.</P>
<P>I returned to Paris, and to my family,
with feelings how different from those I
had felt on my departure! I had now only
scenes of gratulation to witness, and only
tears of luxury to shed!</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Observations on the Glacieres, and the Glaciers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Glacieres are central mountains, on which the snow first collects itself; the name of Glaciers is given to those ramifications of ice which branch from that centre.</NOTE> by M.
Ramond.</HEAD>
<P>TWENTY ages since, when Rome, for
the first time, cast a look towards those
unknown regions, whence issued the bar∣barous
nations who were most the ob∣jects
of her dread, she beheld, with asto∣nishment,
a chain of summits, bolder than
Caucasus, eternally covered with the snows
of winter. The civilized world, for a
while, believed that Italy was joined by
<PB N="280" REF="287"/>
the Alps to the frozen pole of the
North<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Polybius, Book II.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whilst the Romans were contemplating
these Mountains, Hannibal scaled them.
He found, as he had conjectured, that the
whole of their surface was not covered
with snows, and was led by their savage,
but free inhabitants, across their wild pas∣turages,
hidden amidst masses of rocks,
and the Romans discovered that they were
not invincible.</P>
<P>It is not yet precisely determined over
what parts of the mountains the Cartha∣ginians
passed; nor can we form any just
idea of the state of the Alps at the time
of their passage, since we know not to
what places we ought to apply the de∣scriptions
given by the historians who
<PB N="281" REF="288"/>
have transmitted to us the account of this
astonishing expedition. All that we can
conclude from what they have related, is,
that the Alps had at that time reached
their period of old age; hills had filled up
vallies; regular slopes had become abrupt
precipices; vast masses rent from their sides,
indicated their decay, and the regions of ice
which Hannibal crossed, were no doubt
the conquests made by the higher glaciers
over the territory beneath. This is all that
history records, but in what annals shall we
trace the youth of these eldest daughters
of the earth? To what remote period shall
we revert, to discover the infancy of what
for so many centuries has passed the boun∣daries
of old age? If a frail machine, the
work of an instant, which moves, which
feels, which suffers, which lives, which
with all its force and energies hastens to
decay; if man counts by years, by what
numbers or lapses of time shall those pas∣sive
<PB N="282" REF="289"/>
insensible masses be computed, which
are formed to resist, like the globe of
which they are a part, that desolation
which changes, without intermission, the
beautiful scenery of its external form?</P>
<P>Let us then no longer regret the loss of
facts which historians have omitted to
mention; what information should we
gain from annals of such recent date?
What are such points of comparison, at
the distance only of a few ages from each
other? But there is another history, in
which the records of nations occupies but
an imperceptible space, the history of
nature. The mind of genius, which can
read its characters, bounds, at one step,
over the limits of our short and dubious
page, and leaving at a remote distance both
nations, and their earliest convulsions,
plunges into antiquity far beyond their
ken; discovers its periods, and fixes the
<PB N="283" REF="290"/>
epochas of its revolutions. From the
shores of the sea he departs; there he col∣lects
those facts which are most recent;
he marks the yesterday of nature; for na∣tions
in his sight are but the beings of the
day. He then approaches the hills which
rise up from the shores, those which the
waters last formed when they finally with∣drew
from the land. Those are long pa∣rallel,
and but little elevated lines, the
work of the waters in their slow retreat,
for when the ocean left them behind, it
had lost its primitive fury, tending with
less impetuosity towards the hollow which
it now fills.</P>
<P>As he advances, the mountains raise their
heads, and branch off in different chains,
the various directions of which leave traces
of the struggles of the waters. Here,
broad and deep vallies mark the currents;
a raging sea has washed the cliffs and pre∣cipices
<PB N="284" REF="291"/>
above. Vast banks of shells and
vegetable productions, are proofs of the
long abode which the water has made,
and their petrifaction bears testimony to
the number of years which have clapsed
since the sea has left them.</P>
<P>In a loftier region, every object assumes
a bolder shape; every thing indicates more
violent convulsions, discovers mightier
operations, and leads us back to antiquity
still more remote. Every step of eleva∣tion
adds a century to the age of the
mountains, and when the observer arrives
at length a thousand fathoms above the
real level of the seas, he is at the greatest
height where traces of their abode are
found, and where the most distant period
of their known labours is discoverable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Late discoveries, made by M. Ramond, in the Pyrences, have led him to conclude, that the water have obtained a loftier height than he has here men∣tioned. I have lately received a letter from him on the subject of these discoveries, of which the following is an extract:</P>
<P>“Je poursuis maintenant ces observations, et si la lecture de celles que j' ai publiées, vous inspire de l' interet pour les montagnes que j' habite aujour d' huy, vous ne serez pas fachée d' apprendre que cette annee, je suis parvenûe à la partie moyenne du Montperdu, que l' on peut regarder comme le Mont∣blanc, des Pyrénées, et que personne encore n'avait tenté d'approcher, là j' ai trouvé des glaciers qui ne le cedent guēres à ce que les Alpes ont de plus mag∣nifique en ce genre. Mais ce que les Alpes ne vous ont point montré; ce qu' elles ne montreront proba∣blement, à aucun observateur, ce sont les formes etranges, l' aspect épouvantable des montagnes cal∣caires secondaires portées à une telle hauteur; ce sont les débris du regne organique gisans sur leur crimes; ce sont les ossemens des quadrupedes terrestres mlés aux coquilles des téstaces, et aux loges des Zoophytes, c' est le cimetiere des antédiluviens à quinze ou dix huit cens toises au dessus du niveau actuël de la mer.”</P></NOTE>.
<PB N="285" REF="292"/>
Nevertheless he is far from having reached
the highest points which bristle over the
<PB N="286" REF="293"/>
globe. From the bosom of the mountains
which he has just scaled, rises a formidable
chain of naked rocks, that seem to have
held perpetual dominion over the shoreless
seas which rolled around the globe. We
should seek in vain for comparisons, and
epochas between them, and those masses
of mountains, which the sea has formed;
the annals of nature here leave a vast
chasm; there is nothing common in their
respective operations; the spoils of the
animal and vegetable kingdom, which the
secondary mountains contain, prove that
our earth was then the theatre of life;
but who has witnessed the birth of the pri∣mitive
mountains, which conceal nothing
but the simplest aggregations of the mine∣ral
kingdom? when our planet brought
them forth, it was nothing but a dry so∣litude.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="294"/>
Such is the antiquity of these moun∣tains.
Their origin is co-eval with the
infancy of the globe, and must be left to
the same conjectures. If we believe in
the hypothesis of that conflagration of the
earth, which kept it so long in a state of
liquefaction, we may suppose them to
have been formed from the unequal con∣nection
of its parts, and the tumefactions
arising from its first cooling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Buffon's System.</NOTE> If, on the
contrary, we suppose that the seas were
able to maintain themselves for a series of
ages, at more than double the height
which has been commonly granted, we
may believe that their waters, as yet void
of inhabitants, rolled on a purely mineral
mud, and formed this enormous mass of
simple rocks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Such is the opinion of Mr. Saussure, in his excel∣lent work on the Alps. He is the first who has dis∣covered, or thinks he has discovered, regular strata, in the primitive mountains; which consequently cannot be the work of a revolution. These strata are not hori∣zontal, but, on the contrary, almost perpendicular. We may compare them to leaves piled against each other, so that every point of the high Alps, could be well represented by an artichoke.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="295"/>
But of what importance to us are these
different systems? The existence of the
primordial mountains, interests us no far∣ther
than from the epocha when they
proceeded from the bosom of the waters,
surrounded with their investiture of se∣condary
mountains, softening their forms,
smoothing their asperities, and serving as

<PB N="289" REF="296"/>
thing in these primitive chains is regular,
every thing bears the impression of the
first designs of nature. Their gentle, and
fruitful declivities offer all the gradations
of vegetation without confusion, answer∣ing,
with exactness, to the different strata
of the atmosphere, and passing, from the
lavish fertility of the plains, to the scanty
indigence of the lofty heights. The ve∣getable
kingdom is terminated by moss;
every thing beyond is absolute barren∣ness.</P>
<P>Although this barrier chain of primitive
rocks, which proudly dominate over the
habitable globe, as they rose above the de∣luge
by which it was covered, seems to
have escaped the common laws of nature,
it is only to wear her yoke in another
form. The summits of this vast chain
sustain an immense, and eternal load of
snows; and whilst their foundations, like
<PB N="290" REF="297"/>
those of the inferior mountains, augment
the surface of the earth, whilst they water
it with pure streams, divide the lower
stratum of the atmosphere into limited
portions, spread the clouds, and sever and
direct the winds, which, without so pow∣erful
an obstacle, would rush round the
globe in uniform direction with destructive
impetuosity; they keep up an immense
store-house of waters, the waste of which
is always proportioned to the warmth of
the summer, and which, far from drying
up by its scorching heat, would have
power to extinguish the conflagration of
an hemisphere.</P>
<P>But what is the cause of the cold which
reigns over these lofty heights? By what
caprice has nature accumulated, in the
abode of eternal serenity, those laborato∣ries
of ice, which ought to hold their
place only amidst the regions of fogs, and
in the dismal twilight of the polar world?

fire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In his note on Springs, Doctor Darwin informs us,“that the primary cause, why the summits of mountains are much colder than the plains is, their being in a manner insulated, or cut off from the common heat of the earth, which is always forty-eight degrees, and perpetually counteracts the ef∣fects of external cold beneath that degree.” In his note on the Glaciers, he observes, that“ the common heat of the interior parts of the earth being always forty-eight degrees, both in winter and summer, the snow which lies in contact with it is always in a thawing state; hence in ice-houses the external parts of the collection of ice is perpetually thawing, “so that it is necessary to lay up many tons for the preservation of one ton; hence, in Italy, consider∣able rivers have their source from beneath the eter∣nal glacrers, or mountains of snow and ice.”—This philosophic poet is so delighted in roving with his “Nymphs of Primeval Fire,” that he scarcely deigns to cast a glance on the no less interesting divi∣nities of the Glaciers. Had he visited the sublime scenery which they inhabit, he would not only have been enchanted with his icy rambles, and elevated us with his eagle song, but he would have made us under∣stand, more clearly, how, since the summits of the higher Alps are insulated, and cut off from the action of the central fire, it could melt, by its heat, the eternal glaciers into considerable rivers.</P>

He has thrown it into the last pages of his great work, without distinctly explaining the founda∣tion on which it rests; and though he affirms, that he can adopt no other system, after having made acquaint∣ance with mountains, I own that it is less from my own experience, than the confidence that I have in that of M. de Luc, that I should adhere to this system.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whatever, in fine, may be the various
systems framed to explain these phaeno∣mena,
I think we ought to look on that
as the most probable, which establishes
the most uniform and constant cause.
Nothing indeed is more regular than the
law of nature; and the law which sepa∣rates
the living world from the region of
<PB N="297" REF="304"/>
snow, is indicated in all latitudes, by an
imaginary surface, which is 2400 fathoms
higher than the level of the sea above
the equator, and which gradually ap∣proaching
the earth, cuts the real surface
near the eightieth degree of latitude.</P>
<P>If we apply this rule to the Alps, we
shall find that, situated at a distance
from the equator, which exceeds the
half of its distance from the pole, they
ought to meet the region of the snows
at a height less than half that of the
elevation of this region above the seas
of the equator; whence it follows, that
if the Alps had preserved their ori∣ginal
form, we should have seen their
chain covered with a stratum of snow, the
lower borders of which would be fairly cut
by the region of vegetation at 1100 fa∣thoms
above the level of the sea. The
situation alone of some summits, relatively
to the aspect of the sun, and the activity
<PB N="298" REF="305"/>
which the rays of this luminary acquire
from the reflection of certain surfaces on
their neighbouring bodies, would interrupt
by a small number of irregularities, the
unvaried whiteness of this long ridge of
frosts.</P>
<P>If this state has existed, it could only
have existed for a very short period, since
the forms are continually changing to
settle into a regular shape. The mass of
ice having begun to collect, must neces∣sarily
have augmented; and if there was
but one year in which these summits
harboured snows, part of which resisted
the action of the sun, this must be the
cause why, at that height, they should
not melt in proportion to their accumula∣tion.
Now the mass and weight of these
ices could not have increased, without de∣taching
from the main body enormous
portions, which, rolling down the slope of
the mountains, have carried winter into
<PB N="299" REF="306"/>
warmer regions, where they have pre∣served
themselves by means of their ex∣tent,
against the heats of summer. Tor∣rents
have multiplied in proportion to the
increase of the ice, and its approach to∣wards
the temperate zone; they have car∣ried
away the soil that covered the brow
of the hills, and made way for obscure
precipices, down which these rami<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ications
of ice have been lengthened from the
higher summits, and which are destined
to lay waste the lower mountains, and re∣unite
in a continued chain the glaciers,
till then fettered on their insulated tops.</P>
<P>Such is the present state of the Alps.
If it was possible to raise ourselves above
their summits, and take in at one view
the whole mass, the fertile parts would dis∣appear
before those which are uninha∣bitable.
Two principal seas of ice, bor∣dering
on each other, would at first fix
<PB N="300" REF="307"/>
our attention, the one to the north east,
and the other to the south west. In the
first we should perceive the mountains
linked together from St. Gothard, and the
Grimsel, on to the Shreek-horn, like
islands half deluged; on the other side.
we should distinguish, under an uniform
livery, the formidable range of those sum∣mits
which raise themselves from St. Ber∣nard,
and Mount-Velan, on to Mount
Blanc. From those two seas we should
see a multitude of arms branch off, which
by meeting again, mingling together and
uniting in different directions, bind the
great masses to those which are of less
magnitude, and invade every territory
which borders on these regions of frost.</P>
<P>In this uniformity of whiteness, we
should remark a few points of a different
colour, and which enchased in the ice,
seem to have kept their summits free;
<PB N="301" REF="308"/>
these summits, without doubt, were here∣tofore
covered; but their skeleton be∣coming
in course of time incapable of re∣taining
its cloathing, nature relieved their
old age from the common servitude. A
few black spots would indicate the places
of cultivation and pasturage; but we
should seek in vain for those imper∣ceptible
interstices through which men
have made passages; and the Valais, the
greatest interval which the ice has left,
would appear nothing more than a nar∣row
ribband, silvered by the Rhone.</P>
<P>If we look nearer, and observe its par∣tial
effects, this deluge of ice appears still
more formidable. We see it swallowing
up in succession these vast wrecks of
every age, each portion of which bears
evidence of the ravages of a century.
Stretched out like the veil of oblivion
over these records of nature, it threatens
<PB N="302" REF="309"/>
with destruction every vestige which time
has left in its passage. Into whatever
valley I penetrate, I see myself sur∣rounded
by ice; it menaces every com∣munication;
the most fruitful pasturages
are threatened with its invasions; and the
shepherds, hemmed in between the spaces
which remain, point out to us, with sighs,
those which have been subdued. Like
torrents, if it had their rapidity and in∣constancy;
or lavas, if it did not bring in
its train all the horrors of an eternal
winter, the ice follows every declivity,
accumulates in every depth, and presents
itself like an immense volume, the de∣scent
of which is determined by its
weight. The inhabitant of the plain be∣holds
with astonishment the invader pro∣truding
amidst his harvests, bid defiance
even to the sun by which they are
ripened; the shepherd, seeking refuge at
the foot of precipices, perceives it with
<PB N="303" REF="310"/>
terror, mounting the tops of the steep
which separated him from it, and de∣luging
his abode with torrents and ava∣lanches.</P>
<P>We must allow, however melancholy
be the fact, that the ice is gaining on the
whole surface of the high Alps, and is
tending to insulate the more temperate
vallies which they inclose. I will not
say that their increase is any proof of the
refrigeration of the globe; for the Glaciers
have in general gone far beyond the
colder region which has produced them,
and subsist by means of their extent in
a warmer zone; but the situation itself
of these Glaciers, in places which could
not have given them birth, is sufficient to
prove the extension of their original
mass<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When we attribute to the increase alone of the upper regions of snow, the extension of which is ob∣served in the lower Glaciers, and regard the system of the refrigeration of the earth as ill fitted to explain the abode of these masses in a temperate region, I am far from imagining that this manner of considering an in∣sulated fact is in contradiction to the most magnificent theory of the world which genius has ever produced. I think only that many phaenomena relative to the Glaciers and their increase, may be explained without having recourse to that theory.</NOTE> Those therefore who have ga∣thered

have touched that of Montanvert, and
with the other the corn ready for the
sickle, may have supposed that the
country of fruits is that of ice, and that
these masses have not descended from the
region above. Besides, what system, or what
particular observations, shall we oppose
to attested facts and uniform traditions?
We must have had but little knowledge
of these masses of ice, and been less con∣versant
with the shepherds who dwell in
<PB N="305" REF="312"/>

how many Glaciers bear the name of the
pasturages which they have recently in∣vaded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Glaciers of Rosenlaur, which are of the number of two at least in the centre of Berne, the Blumliss Glestscher, in the same Canton, and many others in the Valais, and the Faucigny, &amp;c.</NOTE>; how many passages were open,

And if to so much evidence it was ne∣cessary
to add an higher authority in a
case of this nature than any others which
have hitherto been cited, I should name
the illustrious Haller, the Pliny of Swit∣zerland;
this learned man, then four∣score
years of age, has affirmed to me,
that in his early youth he had seen from
Berne, mountains stript of their snows
during the greater part of the summer,
which are now constantly covered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de Haller, in 1777, has given this opinion on the subject in a preface which he composed for M. Wagner, the Editor of the finest collection extant, of Views in Switzerland. To the observation which I here just mentioned on the faith of this great man, I shall add another of the same kind, and which seems to be decisive. Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, placed, with respect to the Alps, in the same direction as the city of Berne, sees them also terminating the horizon to the south. The an∣cient inhabitants of this province, who appear not to have known the name of these mountains, have given them one descriptive of their appearance, that of Hohe∣Blauen—the High Blues; it is by this name of <HI>Blue Mountains</HI> that the distant chain is called which bounds the sight on the side of the Pacific Ocean and the Streights of Anian, in the continent of North America. This denomination of <HI>High Blues,</HI> which is still found in the perspective charts of Merian, is now fallen into disuse, because it is no longer suitable to masses of splendid whiteness, neatly bordered with the azure of the sky, and whose present appearance re∣sembles those thick clouds which we see on a summer day skirting the horizon.</NOTE>. It
<PB N="307" REF="314"/>
would be a strange abuse of a few par∣ticular
exceptions to oppose the im∣mobility
of the low Glaciers to these
facts. For many ages, it it true, that
some of these masses have not passed cer∣tain
limits; and their insensible aug∣mentations
having always been followed
by proportional diminutions, the extremes
of these variations have been constantly
restrained within a very narrow space.

their career, and have attained the
boundary towards which all the other

more or less success. To suppose, there∣fore,
that the other masses are subject
to the vici<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>situdes of these lower Glaciers,
<PB N="309" REF="316"/>
is to confound every idea. These last,
the inhabitants of our plains, and na∣turalized
in those variable regions, in∣crease
or decrease according to the ca∣pricious
circumstances which regulate
every thing in the lower world. But in
the higher regions, on the contrary, there
is scarcely any difference of seasons, few
circumstances and few accidents, the laws
are simple, the tendency is fixed, and the
increase depends invariably on the same
cause which has preserved the snows of
the first winter, in spite of the heats of
the first summer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When at these elevations the relation of the winter cold to the heats of summer has been found such, that, at the end of a year, the sum of snow fallen has somewhat exceeded that of the snow melted, the layer of snow which has resisted, could not but aug∣ment, because each year has covered it again with a new stratum. The proportion of the accumulation ought also to be an increasing ratio, because the cold which reigns at the summit of these mountains has necessarily augmented in the ratio of the annual thick∣ness of the icy covering; so that the snow of the hun∣dredth winter, supported by a soil already ice, has resisted with much more efficacy the heats of the fol∣lowing summer, than did those which the first winter had thrown over a country till then naked, and subject only to the natural cold of the aerial zone by which it is surrounded.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="317"/>
The influence which the accumulation
of the Glaciers of the high region has on
the lower Glaciers, is seen in the pro∣gressive
march of the latter. It is easy to
conceive the cause: a mass which weighs
on an inclined plane, has a necessary
tendency to descend; and this tendency
is favoured in the Glaciers by the shock
of torrents, which roll under their cavities,
by the humidity which their mass com∣municates
to the soil which supports
them; and finally by that innumerable
multitude of hollows which undermine
<PB N="311" REF="318"/>
their lower part, the effect of which is
the diminution of the friction by di∣minishing
the extent of the surfaces. It
is thus that the increase, which in reality
takes place only on the heights, feeds
the ramifications, which, being situated
in the temperate regions, lose much
without gaining, and also gradually aug∣ments
those Glaciers that have not yet
passed beyond the icy band of mountains,
which they one day will pass, to desolate
warmer countries. It is at Mareme, or
Moraine, to that mass of fragments of
rocks which bounds the foot of the Gla∣ciers,
that we are indebted for the dis∣covery
of their progress. It was observed
that this ridge was composed chiefly of
pieces of granite, although the rocks
around the Glacier were all calcareous,
and it was easily to be suspected that it
must have been from the place of its
origin that it has slowly transported these
<PB N="312" REF="319"/>
wrecks: of this circumstance the convic∣tion
was increased, when, on annually
comparing the situation of its transversal
crevices with the bordering rocks, it is
found that they imperceptibly advanced
towards its extremity, and that a mark
fixed above one of these crevices, had
in a short time overrun a considerable
space<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is in the Glaciers of Faucigny that these ob∣servations have been made, where firs, stuck in the crevices of the ice, have served as points of com∣parison. One of the most decisive experiments of this kind was made by M. Hennin, then French Minister at Geneva. It appears from all those that have hitherto been made, that the progress of the ice is about four∣teen feet every year. This progress is enormous; and it is easy to perceive that a tendency so decisive would be productive of the most terrible effects, if the elevation was every where the same, and if different causes did not unite to counteract it; but it is not possible for this law to be universal; it must vary according to the descent and the direction of the val∣lies of ice; and lastly, according to the pressure of the upper masses, and the direction of that pressure. Be∣sides, the temperature of the region of the Glaciers modifies in some measure their progress; the soil more or less moistened by the melting of the ice, favours more or less its descent; so that the lower ramifica∣tions, loaded with the enormous weight of the snows of the higher region, situated in vallies, the descent of which being long and steep, and undermined by the torrents which collect beneath their cavities, must proceed much more rapidly than those which inhabit the icy region; and this increase of rapidity, owing to their situation, is at the same time the means which nature has employed to repair the rapid losses to which they are subjected by their position, whilst the slow∣ness of the progress of the upper Glaciers prevents the prodigious increase which that position would admit. By these means, the mass of the high region, finding its extension more circumscribed on the side of the higher vallies, throws itself chiefly towards the lower outlets, where its extremities are sometimes kept in a state of dissolution; so that the annual increase of the snows, however great, produces but an imperceptible increase in the Glaciers, and is sometimes annihilated by the caprices of the seasons.</P>
<P>Dr. Darwin, alarmed by the increase of the ice at the northern pole, and on the Swiss mountains, has pointed out an ingenious and beneficent mode of re∣storing the equilibrium of heat and cold, by employ∣ing the fleets of Europe, now busied in devastation, in the more innocent occupation of navigating ice islands from the neighbourhood of the pole, to cool the feverish climates of the track of the sun. As the con∣tinential armies are about to cease their work of death, the Doctor might also have proposed their being en∣gaged in the removal of the Glaciers of St. Gothard, or Mont Blanc, had not M. Ramond, in his late ob∣servations on the Pyrenees, relieved us from any ap∣prehension on account of the threatened progressive refrigeration of the globe from the increase of the ice on the Glaciers. After having descanted on the causes of the variety, the breadth, and elevation of the icy zone on the Alps, and the Pyrenees, and which is only three hundred fathom on the latter, while it occupies a space of thirteen hundred fathom on the former; (a wonderful difference, he adds, if we reflect that the most elevated summits of these mountains differ only six hundred fathom in their height, and only three degrees and a half in their latitude.) M. Ramond draws the following inductions, that from the height which the peaks of a chain of mountains attain, from its mean latitude, and the extent of its icy zone, two points being given, a third may be concluded; and that if in a known chain, from a given mountain, two of these circumstances are ascertained, its height, the extent of its snows, or ice, and the place which it holds in the links of the chain, the third is a necessary consequence.</P>
<P>M. Ramond, after having established these rules, endeavours to prove that the Glaciers of the Alps, like those of the Pyrenees, are not susceptible of any durable increase beneath the icy zone. Let the Gla∣cier roll its waves towards every outlet—vain menace!—it is like the streamlet which rushes head∣long from the lofty precipice, and is le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in air. A carpet of flowers forms a boundary to the sea of ice which it cannot pass; the harvest of the husbandman waves in safety on its banks, and the shepherd's but need not fear its vicinity. The fury of the ocean is not more certainly restrained by the gently sloping beach, where the foaming waters, that shake the rocks, and dash against them like the slight canoe of the Indian, the stately vessel loaded with legions and their thunder, die away on the lightly-shifting sands, where they scarcely move the shell which they have thrown.</P></NOTE>.</P>

This mode of increasing and multiply∣ing

which they have taken perpetual posses∣sion.
New Glaciers are sometimes formed
in hollows, that are less exposed to the
sun, where the snow of winter is pre∣served
by the mass which the heat
<PB N="317" REF="324"/>
of summer loosens from the mountains
above. It is this last phaenomenon which
the inhabitants of the Alps refer to when
they advance it as an axiom, that a
Glacier springs up wherever a portion of
snow, however small, has remained for
the space of a year.</P>
<P>The regular steps which I have just
traced, the slow progress which draws
imperceptibly to the foot of the Alps,
the snow which their summits have col∣lected,
is at once the origin of the Gla∣ciers,
and the cause of their duration.
If the snows invariably remained in their
native region, and received no other in∣crease
than was sufficient to repair the
loss occasioned by evaporation, Switzer∣land
would have no ice, and would no
longer furnish to the four seas which sur∣round
Europe, the finest rivers of this
part of the world. If, on the contrary,
<PB N="318" REF="325"/>
these same snows fell suddenly into the
lower vallies, before they had taken the
consistence which they rèceive in the
middle region, by the succession of frost
and thaw, their dissolution would be as
rapid as their fall, and they would soon
disappear with the furious torrents they
would have formed. It is not thus that
nature acts. She has destined the most
elevated country of Europe to be the
waterer of its surface; but this watering,
in order to prove a benefit, must be regu∣lar.
The snows which accumulate in
these lofty regions ought to be slow and
uniform in melting. In order to melt,
they must descend into a lower region of
the atmosphere; to melt slowly, they
must be in great masses, and under a very
solid form; they must take the con∣sistence
of the hardest ice. Let us fol∣low
their singular transformation in its
details.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="326"/>
The highest mountains, those which
are properly known under the name of
<HI>Glacieres,</HI> are absolutly inaccessible; but
the experienced beholder distinguishes in
the brilliant whiteness of their covering,
that dazzling which is the characteristic
of snow. In reality, nothing falls from
the clouds but snow, and that which
adheres to these elevated points, never
having undergone a real thaw, must ne∣cessarily
remain in this form, or be co∣vered
only with a sight varnish of im∣perfect
ice, caused by the agglutination
of the parts of the surface most exposed
to the sun. It is this dazzling incrusta∣tion
which has deceived many observers,
with respect to the nature of the clothing
of these mountains. All the parts of this
clothing very easily separate from each
other, and fall often into icy dust at the
bottom of the neighbouring and surround∣ing
mountains. This is the first state of
<PB N="320" REF="327"/>
the upper snows, and the first step which
they take towards the inferior vallies.</P>
<P>Directly beneath these mountains, and
in that elevated hollow, which receives
at the same time their spoils, and the
snows of the atmosphere, the tempera∣ture
is less icy, the sun has some in∣fluence,
and a few days of thaw suspend
the rigours of winter; we then find the
snow more condensed, more adhesive; it
keeps from sinking, but the trace of the
foot is preserved. This is the immense
reservoir of the Glaciers. An infinity of
branches escape in every direction along
the steep vallies towards the plain. Their
snows elaborated in the hollow above,
and become solid, are fitted to bear the
trial which they undergo in a more tem∣perate
region. The second step is ac∣complished.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="328"/>
In this new abode, the snows are ex∣posed
to longer thaws, but the frosts are
scarcely less sharp; their masses are more
thoroughly penetrated with the water
which is produced by the dissolution of
some of its parts; but when it is duly
moistened, the cold seizes, and trans∣forms
it into a kind of half ice, which
already seems transparent; this is the ori∣gin
of the Glaciers.</P>
<P>The work is not yet finished, but it
goes on rapidly to perfection. Every
fathom of descent towards the lower re∣gion
gives the ice a greater degree of
hardness and transparency, and the Gla∣cier,
undergoing a thorough transforma∣tion
preserves nothing that bears a re∣semblance
of its original.</P>
<P>If, in the mean time, we cast an atten∣tive
look over the part where the trans∣formation
<PB N="322" REF="329"/>
is most perfect, namely, at the
foot of the Glacier, we shall perceive
that that is not absolutely homogeneous,
but composed of two very different kinds
of ice. That which forms the lower
stratum being more compact and more
transparent, is of an hardness surpassing
that of our most perfect ice; it is also
like it in other respects, terminated by
plane sufaces; but that which forms
itself into irregular rocks, the outward
surface of which is rugged, being more
white and light, as well as less solid, is
easily divided into globular fragments,
which are themselves only an aggrega∣tion
of similar parts. The lower bed of
ice is therefore the produce of water,
regularly crystallized, whilst the other is
nothing more than snow, the particles
of which are agglutinated by the succes∣sion
of thaws and frosts. This is, I be∣lieve,
the cause of that phaenomenon.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="330"/>
The snow, as it falls to the ground, is
a mass of little regular crystals, in the
form of very light and scooped out stars,
the six rays of which being flat, pointed,
and distant sixty degrees from each other,
present the form of the crystallization of
water. Let us imagine the effect which
the heat must necessarily have on their
accumulated flakes, we shall find that the
most unconnected parts are those which
yield the soonest, the points will drop off,
a little spherical nucleus is all that remains
of each star, and the whole mass will sink
by the union of these globules. It is in
this state that those snows are every where
found which have undergone a first thaw;
they then become less porous, and more
transparent. But if this thaw be succeeded
by frost, the little spherical icicles cling
together, and form an icy mass, which
breaks at each sinuous interstice, which the
elementary globules leave between them.
<PB N="324" REF="331"/>
Such is the ice which composes the upper
stratum of the glaciers. The lower stratum
is formed by the congelation of the waters,
which have filtered through the snow; it
takes the figure of perfect ice; its mass is
a series of flat and uniformly inclined
planes; it is hard, transparent, and breaks
into sharp fragments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among these lower strata of ice, some parts are found of a deeper blue, much harder, heavier, and more indissoluble, than the most solid ice we know of. These properties arise from their antiquity, and the continual succession of dissolution and congelation which they undergo. Their parts become gradually more con∣nected; they have expelled or dissolved all the particles of heterogeneous air, which disturbed their transparency, or diminished their adhesion; remaining therefore unmix∣ed with any foreign matter, they have acquired that blue colour which belongs to air and water, when they form a volume, and hold no other fluid in suspension. M. Plyffer has made several experiments on this ice, which I have not yet repeated. He asserts, that it retains its colour to its smallest fragments. He has also remarked its property of resisting heat. I have made the same observation, and have admired the wisdom of nature, which has given this ice hardness, and indissolubility, fitted to make it support the abode of the warm vallies into which it descends.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is not, as is commonly believed, dur∣ing
the heats of summer, that these trans∣formations
take place; they are only un∣dergoing
<PB N="325" REF="332"/>
preparation. The snow is satu∣rated
with water; but the cold of the
night is not sufficiently piercing to finish
the work; it penetrates but a little way;
the thaw is but slightly restrained, it is the
winter alone which fixes it, and freezes
what the summer has dissolved. Thence
it happens, that during the tempe∣rate
season a prodigious quantity of wa∣ter
escapes congelation; makes its way
on every side through the mass of snows;
its weight determines it towards the ex∣tremities;
there it finds either reservoirs,
<PB N="326" REF="333"/>
which distribute it into the bowels of
mountains to feed the springs, or decli∣vities
down which it rushes, dragging
along a part of the snow drowned in it,
and forcing a channel, to empty itself
into the plains. In vain are these pervi∣ous
snows afterwards changed into ice;
they preserve the form which has been
impressed on them; the torrent seizing on
its bed, and endued with an impetuosity
proportioned to the rapidity of its descent,
acquires the power of overcoming the
transitory obstacles which accident might
bring in its way. The glacier, in its pro∣gress,
is forced to preserve for it an outlet
which it would otherwise find the means
of opening for itself; or rather let me say,
that the glacier is formed by its current;
its descent is favoured by the shock, and
the rapidity of its waters; the torrent
traces out the places which it is to occupy▪
<PB N="327" REF="334"/>
and becomes the pioneer that prepares de∣serts
for its reception.</P>
<P>Whilst nature is making this external
expenditure, to fertilize our plains burnt
up by the heats of summer, she looks for∣ward
to winter to replenish her reservoirs;
it is in hollows deprived, to all appear∣ance,
of outlet, that she accumulates the
waters, which a thousand unknown pipes
convey into interior cavities, whence
they issue under the form of springs,
which not only have resisted the winter
cold, but have often acquired a heat fo∣reign
to their nature, the cause of which
is demonstrated by the numerous hot
springs we find in Switzerland. The same
subterraneous sources from which they
flow, those semi-volcanoes kept up by
the slow and gradual fermentation of the
vast magazines of minerals heaped up in
the bosom of the Alps, are the origin also
<PB N="328" REF="335"/>
of those accidental cavities, which are dug
under the glaciers already formed, and of
that verdure which we are sometimes sur∣prised
to find in places which ought to be co∣vered
with eternal snows; lastly, we are in∣debted
to them for a great number of rivulets,
kept up by the melting of the ice during the
sharpest cold of winter, and which seizing
on the bed of the torrents, sweep their
course, and keep their outlets free. It is
to these receptacles of heat, and by the
partial sinkings which they occasion in
the mass of the glaciers, that we must
attribute a part of the great crevices
which cross them in every direction, and
which receiving the waters of the upper
surface, carry them into the lower canals.
It is also to the vaults made by their hot
exhalations under the glaciers, that we
might attribute the formation of bridges
of ice, interior lakes, and a thousand
other accidents, which, because they are
<PB N="329" REF="336"/>
accidents, can have no constant cause,
and ought not therefore to be ranged in
the class of phaenomena arising from the
heat peculiar to the earth. This heat
is an uniform and universal cause, and
therefore can have only uniform and uni∣versal
effects.</P>
<P>If this heat acted only on the lower
part of the glaciers, it would act always
regularly, their mass would sink every
where in the same proportion, the waters
which should proceed from their melting
would give equal moisture to all the
countries they covered; they would run
off indifferently from all parts of the ice
which touch the ground, and would re∣unite
only after their fall. There would
be no partial and extraordinary cavities, no
separate reservoirs; none of those privi∣leged
places which rid themselves of their
snows, without owing it to the beam of
<PB N="330" REF="337"/>
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un, or their relative position to the
neighbouring heights.</P>
<P>The hollows which have been found at
the feet of the glaciers, and which serve
as outlets to the torrents, have been pro∣duced
as evidences of the melting of the
under strata of the snow; but as these hol∣lows
answer precisely to the deepest part
of the vallies, occupied by the glacier,
that is to say, at the very place where
the waters, left to their own weight and
fluidity, unite together, when no obstacle
occurs to prevent their tendency, and be∣ing
likewise only the mouth of a channel
which pierces the glacier through its
whole length, they prove nothing, except
the little resistance which the drench∣ed
snows have made to the draining of
the waters which proceeded from their
thaw, at a period when the mass had not
yet acquired its icy form. In fact, it is
<PB N="331" REF="338"/>
not, in the bottom of those hollows, as
some suppose, who have seen only the
extremities of the glaciers, that the tor∣rents
take their rise. Both the <HI>Lutschenis,</HI>
and the torrent that swells the Rhone,
near its source, do not belong to the masses
of ice in the <HI>Grendelwald, Lauterbrunnen,</HI>
and the <HI>Furca;</HI> their sources are in the
upper snows, but they owe to the chan∣nel
which receives them, and which con∣veys
them to the plains, after having for a
long time concealed them from sight,
those auxiliary waters which its numerous
crevices bring them from all parts of the
glacier; so that the increase of the tor∣rent
arises as much from the upper sur∣face
as from the lower part. We might
even conclude, that the produce of the
external thaw is not inconsiderable, if we
observe that the furrows, by which it is
hollowed, as well as its bristled points, are
the work of the currents which are formed
<PB N="332" REF="339"/>
in the first days of spring; and which
would continue running, if the cavities,
by giving way soon after, did not absorb
them as they arise, and conduct them
into the lower channel.</P>
<P>After having described the general
forms which the glaciers owe to their
origin, I shall not stop to paint the infi∣nite
varieties which distinguish them;
they are as numerous as the places where
they are situated, and the circumstances
by which they are attended.</P>
<P>In this spot, a band of ice, adhering to
a precipice, drops off in proportion as the
fun communicates warmth to its sup∣porter,
and presents itself, seen sideways,
like a transparent needle, so extremely
elevated, that its equilibrium appears a
miracle. On another side, a mass of ice,
on the edge of a precipice, leans like a
<PB N="333" REF="340"/>
penthouse over the depth, and turns itself
into a half circle. Sometimes this pent∣house
drops off from its weight, and leaves
a perpendicular wall of ice, of terrific
height. Between mountains, at little dis∣tance
from each other, the glacier is a
narrow streight; further on, it is an im∣mense
sea, overlooked only by a few points,
half swallowed up. In the upper regions,
the sea is calm, and furrowed only by vast
waves; if it escapes along a narrow valley,
it is a furious torrent, where one wave fol∣lows
rushing on another. Every thing
has the semblance of motion and noise;
but all around is stillness and peace.</P>
<P>I leave, without reluctance, particular
descriptions of objects, and frigid details,
to writers who make a point of explaining
every thing; but I regret that I have not
been able to bring back from this new
world the power of painting to the ima∣gination,
<PB N="334" REF="341"/>
as it was pictured before my
eyes; to retrace the sentiments with
which it inspired me, and the ideas to
which it gave birth. Let no one judge
of its solitudes by the solitudes of our
plains. Here below, every thing lives,
sensation pervades the whole. In the
most distant retreat, in deserts where I do
not find the footsteps of man, I find a fa∣mily
of birds, which is the emblem of our
own; a rèpublic of insects, which recalls
the idea of our nations; their industry,
their relations and antipathies. The
waving of a tree, the shaking of a shrub,
the rapid course, or murmuring flow of a
rivulet, every thing brings me back to the
sentiment of existence, by giving me the
idea of motion, the most soothing of all
ideas, because it is the most remote from
annihilation. But how different the im∣mense
deserts of the Alps! One uniform
carpet covers their icy labyrinths, from the
<PB N="335" REF="342"/>
proudest summits to the most unsearch∣able
abysses; it is the livery of the eternal
winters of the pole, a winding sheet which
enwraps the expiring earth.</P>
<P>An eternal silence reigns over this se∣cluded
region. If at remote distances an
avalanche falls amidst its precipices; if a
rock rolls over its ice, the noise will be in∣sulated;
no living creature answers it by a
cry of terror, no timid birds fly away af∣frighted;
the winding labyrinths of these
mountains, carpeted with snow, receive,
in silence, the sound, which is repeated
by no echo. Who, but the observer of
nature, would suspect that this vast tomb
contains its secret laboratory, and that
like the careful monarch who, in the
tranquil retirement of his palace, dwells
with anxiety on the happiness of his
people, the mother of the world pre∣pares
in this abode, defended by such
<PB N="336" REF="343"/>
terrible avenues, the flowers with which
she is to deck our plains.</P>
<P>The waste made by the icy mass, to
feed its lower branches, and the prodigi∣ous
loss occasioned by evaporation, would
not be sufficient to counterbalance the
continual increase which it receives, if
the upper snows did not descend into the
region where they are to be dissolved,
although with that slowness which cha∣racterises
their regular progress, and under
the solid form which they acquire by this
gradual descent, so that in a short space
the heights being overloaded with their
weight, and not having the faculty of
retaining them on their steep declivities,
precipitate them, under the form of <HI>la∣vanges,</HI>
into regions where the rays of the
sun have more active force.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="344"/>
Having by this means prematutely
reached the limit to which they all tend,
they are exposed, without shelter, to the
action of the heat, and melt with a cele∣sity
which soon re-establishes the balance
between the loss the increase. Dif∣ferent
causes contribute to favour the re∣moval
of these masses of snow, and the
inhabitants of the country give different
names to this phaenomenon, according to
their causes, and to the forms which it re∣ceives
from them. It is on this account
they are called lavanges of cold, lavanges
of heat, lavanges of wind, and lavanges of
dust<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>lavange</HI> is derived from the German term <HI>lavine,</HI> by which the inhabitants of the Swiss Alps distinguish this phaenomenon. That of <HI>Avalanche,</HI> which expresses the same thing, and which is more in use in the <HI>Romansh</HI> country, has for its etymology the old word <HI>avaler,</HI> to descend, which is no longer un∣derstood in this sense; or rather from the adverb a-val, from the Monkish Latin <HI>ad vallem,</HI> which is the origin of the word.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="345"/>
A mass of snow, which its own weight
alone detaches from the heights, on the
slope of which it was suspended, is what
is called a lavange of cold, because it is
generally in winter that the accumulation
of snow determines its descent. The fall
is always accompanied by a dreadful
crash, and nothing can resist its course.
Habitations, whole villages, are buried
under it; forests are levelled with the
ground; rocks-bend before the shock, and
are dragged on with the current. The air,
agitated by the precipitation of this enor∣mous
mass, carries the devastation into
places which the snows cannot reach; a
hurricane is less violent in its effects, and
sometimes the traveller, who journeys out
of the reach of the lavange, has been
thrown down headlong, or stifled by this
<PB N="339" REF="346"/>
impetuous blast, loaded with particles of
ice.</P>
<P>The lavange of <HI>heat</HI> or <HI>dust</HI> differs but lit∣tle
from the preceding. It has the same
origin, but is less compact; it falls less in
a mass, and by dividing itself, it covers a
greater extent of ground; the snow which
composes it, is an icy powder, extremely
fine and light. During the hot days of
summer, we frequently hear a noise like
that of thunder, or of a torrent which
throws itself from a considerable height
on a surface of rock; it is one of these
distant lavanges, which falls from rock to
rock, under the form of a cascade of wa∣ter
raised into foam. A hot wind, which
blows from the southern region, and
which the inhabitants of the Swiss Alps
call <HI>Foen,</HI> the same which from the first
days of the month of March changes at
once the temperature of the air in the
<PB N="340" REF="347"/>
neighbouring countries, which in one day
enamels the meadows with violets, and
gives him who breathes it the first feel∣ings
of spring; the Sirocco of the Italians
sweeps in a short time the summit of the
Alps. At that period lavanges follow one
another without intermission, the torrents
rush from every glacier; and the rivers,
suddenly swelled, overflow their banks.
When the wind rises, it finds a mass of
icy air above the Alps, which opposes its
passage, and with which it struggles, but
it is only at the end of two days that it
has power to take its place, and the in∣habitants
of the northern plains of Swit∣zerland
feel, for two days, a cold wind
which they know precedes the burning
wind they shall feel on the third day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This takes place in Suabia, and Alsace, though in a much less sensible manner. No where else is felt this sudden change of season, which has something ma∣gical in it, and which makes so delicious an impression on every being; the succession is slow and gradual, and the opposite temperature coming into contact by shades scarcely perceptible, give nature a monotonous progress, which affects the mind only with vague sen∣sations.</NOTE>.
<PB N="341" REF="348"/>
The lavange of <HI>wind</HI> is, of the number of
phaenomena of this kind, that which ap∣pertains
most to the high mountains of the
northerly parts of the globe. It is a shift∣ing
of snows, occasioned, during the win∣ter,
by violent hurricanes. These snows,
which the cold has preserved in their state
of lightness, are carried away by the
winds, and transported to a great dis∣tance.</P>
<P>The aspect of the region, where these
winds exercise their fury, is changed in an
instant; woe to those who are then wan∣dering
on their heights! the paths which
their footsteps have traced, disappear;
<PB N="342" REF="349"/>
the marks set up at regular distance to
point out the direction of the roads are
thrown to the ground; and if the un∣happy
traveller is not buried under this
furious sea, he throws his eyes with despair
over an immense ocean, with nothing to
direct his steps, and which offers no other
inequalities than the vast waves, the moving
surface of which has been ploughed by
the winds. It is thus that nature, in her
general views, overlooks partial evils. No
sacrifice is too great, when the preserva∣tion
of her original plan is concerned; and
while she is careful to conceal her un∣changeableness
under an inexhaustible va∣riety
of forms, of what importance is it
that one of her steps occasions the removal,
or annihilation of any of those beings,
which she scatters with so much profu∣sion
over the surface of the globe.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="350"/>
I shall confine to this rapid outline, the
picture of the objects which my abode,
amidst the Alps, has offered me.</P>
<P>Placed in the centre of the richest and
most temperate part of the globe, these
mountains bring us in contact with the most
savage and most frozen regions of the earth.
If we take a view of them relatively to their
constituent parts, we shall find a respecta∣ble
remnant of the first sketch of our
planet, an immoveable chain of simple
rocks, which have kept their seat amidst
the revolutions of the earth, and which
have witnessed around them the birth and
decay of those fortuitous and tumultuous
aggregations, those slow masses, the secon∣dary
mountains, children of the caprices
of nature, and fleeting as these caprices.
Within their bosom they conceal virgin
fossils, as antient as themselves, and
crystals, the faithful companions of gla∣ciers.
<PB N="344" REF="351"/>
It is only at their feet that we see
those calcarious, or argillaceous invest∣ments,
the strata of which contain wrecks
of beings, which live on the surface of
the earth, or in the gulphs of the sea;
those sinuous hills, that wind around their
basis, which cover the primitive vallies
with a foreign soil, the different states of
which bear evidence to the lapses of ages,
from which the primordial mountains
have received little injury, and of which
they preserve scarcely any traces.</P>
<P>If we consider the height of these
mountains, various other phaenomena pre∣sent
themselves to our minds. The height
of thirty fathoms raises you a degree
above the equator; and the same varia∣tions
of temperature which local circum∣stances,
such as the vicinity or the dis∣tance
of seas, the extent or absence of fo∣rests,
make in the temperature of climates,
<PB N="345" REF="352"/>
in a gradual progress towards the pole, are
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound as you pass through the different
successive strata of the atmosphere, repre∣sented
by the irregularities which are
caused by the exposure of mountains,
with respect to the sun, the reflection of
neighbouring surfaces, and the distance of
the ice, in the regular diminution of the
heat. In a greater elevation, such irre∣gularities
diminish as those local circumstances
have less influence nearer the poles.
At twelve or thirteen hundred fathoms
height, you are at the eightieth degree
of latitude, and in a walk of a few hours
you have felt the influence of all the sea∣sons;
seen the production of every cli∣mate;
ran through the whole scale of ve∣getation,
and compared the birds of Italy
with those of northern lakes and conti∣nents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A naturalist of Rome, Mr. Springlein, has formed, with considerable taste and expence, a complete col∣lection of the birds of the Alps, which consists of about five hundred specimens. It contains the species pecu∣liar to every climate from the south of Italy to the north of America.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="353"/>
To sum up all, you have passed the
bounds of the most frozen habitable zone.
At seventy-five degrees you meet with
vast forests; but they are not to be found
in the Alps at the height of eleven hundred
fathoms. Here the cold is attended with
a shortness of the column of air; there it
is maintained by the obliquity of the sun's
rays. It appears that vegetable life yields
foonest to the impression of the first of
these circumstances, and we should find
ourselves in the most horrid of all regions,
if a wonderfully serene sky, if the purest
splendour of the sun did not take place of
the eternal fogs which cover the polar
continent, and the pale glimmering which
trickles along its desolate frosts.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="354"/>
Let no one imagine that existance is
for a moment painful in the midst of these
deserts. A temperature, such as the pre∣sence
of a cloudless sun, is always an en∣joyment,
notwithstanding the cold of the
atmosphere; an air which is respirable
at the highest degree, notwithstanding its
rarefaction; waters which have preserved
the purity they have acquired, when raised
to the clouds, because in falling back on
the earth they have not crossed the pesti∣lential
vapours which hover over our
plains; those waters which, offering to the
parched traveller no perfidious beverage,
engage him to quench his burning thirst
without apprehension of the fatal effects
arising from their coolness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This quality of the waters which proceed from a glacier is proved, not only by the experience of all those who have made use of it, but still more by the opinions of the physicians of Switzerland. I am not well acquainted with the explanation they give of this phaenomenon; but for my own part, having often drank of it, I should be tempted to think that this in∣nocence is owing less to their quality, than to the dis∣position of the body, which finding a very rarefied at∣mosphere in the heights, does not receive from the friction of its own parts a degree of heat comparable to that of which it is susceptible in our plains. Be∣sides, in these regions we are never at rest, we are ever in activity, and the cooling being only momentary, cannot suspend the perspiration.</NOTE>; these things
<PB N="348" REF="355"/>
are what first strike the senses. The most
excessive fatigue vanishes in an instant;
strength is renewed; courage and tran∣quillity
take place of uneasiness; in a
word, the body and mind undergo a trans∣formation
which extends and multiplies
all their faculties. However wonderful
what I have advanced may appear, I shall
not want evidences of its truth, and shall
only find those incredulous, who have
never ascended above the plain. I call
these to witness, who have scaled some of
<PB N="349" REF="356"/>
the heights of the globe; is there a single
person who did not find himself regene∣rated;
who did not feel with surprise,
that he had left at the feet of the moun∣tains,
his weakness, his infirmities, his
cares, his troubles, in a word, the weaker
part of his being, and the ulcerated portion
of his heart? Who among them but will
acknowledge that at no moment of his
life, in the age even of his warmest pas∣sions,
in the midst of circumstances which
have given the greatest sorce to his ima∣gination,
he has never felt himself so dis∣posed
to that kind of enthusiasm which
kindles great ideas!</P>
<P>In fine, who, in beholding from that sta∣tion
the immensity of the celestial spheres,
and the nothingness of our planet, can
think without some feeling of contempt on
what we call great, or of pity on what we
<PB N="350" REF="357"/>
deem important? Let not this appear
wonderful; every thing in these regions is
of collossal magnitude: the eye lost in
the immense chaos of mountains which it
surveys, thinks it beholds an universe, and
this universe is but a point when it con∣templates
the azure space in which we
wander. Nothing distracts or misleads
the mind employed on these sublime ob∣jects.
The silence of these deserts, where
nothing breathes, or moves, beyond the
tumult of the habitable world; the view
of these profound abysses; of valleys
which those immoveable cliffs have be∣held
alternately desert and cultivated, peo∣pled
to-day, to-morrow desolated, the
asylum of so many alternately happy and
miserable mortals, the theatre of so many
changes; every thing concurs to make
our meditations more profound; to give
them that melancholy hue, that sublime
<PB N="351" REF="358"/>
character which they acquire, when the
soul, taking that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light which makes it con∣temporary
with every age, and co-existent
with all beings, hovers over the abyss of
time. In vain would reason strive to count
by years. The solidity of these enormous
masses, opposed to the accumulation of
their ruins, startles and con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds all its
calculations. Imagination seizes the reins
which Reason drops, and in that long suc∣cession
of periods, catches a glimpse of the
image of eternity, which she hails with
religious terror. How has every thing
vanished, which occupies, enchants, and
astonishes us here below, when we com∣pare
it with the objects of glory that are set
before us! Thus, our most extended ideas,
and our most elevated and noble senti∣ments
have their origin in the wanderings
of the imagination; but let us forgive its
chimeras, for what would there be great
<PB N="352" REF="359"/>
in our conceptions, or glorious in our ac∣tions,
if finite was not, through its illu∣sions,
continually changed into infinite,
space into immensity, time into eternity,
and fading laurels into immortal crowns!</P>
