<HEAD>A CHAIN of
PHILOSOSPHICAL REFLEXIONS
AND
INQUIRIES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FOR INTRODUCTION to the following
piece I assure the reader, that nothing
could, in my present situation, have in∣duced
me to be at the pains of writing
it, but a firm belief that it would prove a valua∣ble
present to the Public. What entertainment so∣ever
the reasoning or notional part may afford the
mind, I will venture to say, the other part seemeth
so surely calculated to do good to the body, that
both must be gainers. For if the lute be not well
tuned, the musician fails of his harmony. And in
our present state, the operations of the mind, so
far depend on the right tone or good condition of
it's instrument, that any thing which greatly con∣tributes
to preserve or recover the health of the
body, is well worth the attention of the mind.
These considerations have moved me to communi∣cate
to the Public the salutary virtues of Tar wa∣ter;
to which I thought myself indispensably
obliged, by the duty every man owes to mankind.
And, as effects are linked with their causes, my
thoughts on this low but useful theme led to far∣ther
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
inquiries, and those on to others remote, per∣haps,
and speculative, but, I hope, not altogether
useless or unentertaining.</P>
<P>1. IN certain parts of America, Tar water is
made by putting a quart of cold water to a
quart of tar, and stirring them well together in a
vessel, which is left standing till the tar sinks to
the bottom. A glass of clear water being poured
off for a draught is replaced by the same quantity
of fresh water, the vessel being shaken and left to
stand as before. And this is repeated for every
glass; so long as the tar continues to impregnate
the water sufficiently, which will appear by the
smell and taste. But as this method produceth tar
water of different degrees of strength, I chuse to
make it in the following manner: Pour a gallon
of cold water on a quart of tar, and stir and mix
them thoroughly with a ladle or flat stick for the
space of three or four minutes, after which the ves∣sel
must stand eight and forty hours that the tar
may have time to subside, when the clear water is
to be poured off and kept for use, no more being
made from the same tar, which may still serve for
common purposes.</P>
<P>2. This cold infusion of tar hath been used in
some of our colonies, as a preservative or prepara∣tive
against the small-pox, which foreign practice
induced me to try it in my own neighbourhood,
when the small pox raged with great violence. And
the trial fully answered my expectation: all those,
within my knowledge, who took the tar water
having either escaped that distemper, or had it
very favourably. In one family there was a re∣markable
instance of seven children, who came all
very well through the small-pox, except one young
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
child which could not be brought to drink tar-wa∣ter
as the rest had done.</P>
<P>3. Several were preserved from taking the small-pox
by the use of this liquor: others had it in the
mildest manner, and others that they might be able
to take the infection were obliged to intermit
drinking the tar-water. I have found it may be
drunk with great safety and success for any length
of time, and this not only before, but also during
the distemper. The general rule for taking it is,
about half a pint night and morning on an empty
stomach, which quantity may be varied, according
to the case and age of the patient, provided it be
always taken on an empty stomach, and about two
hours before or after a meal.</P>
<P>4. It seemed probable, that a medicine of such
efficacy in a distemper attended with so many pu∣rulent
ulcers, might be also useful in other foul∣nesses
of the blood, accordingly I tried it on seve∣ral
persons infected with cutaneous eruptions and
ulcers, who were soon relieved, and soon after cu∣red.
Encouraged by these Successes I ventured to
advise it in the foulest distempers, wherein it pro∣ved
much more successful than salivations and wood-drinks
had done.</P>
<P>5. Having tried it in a great variety of cases, I
found it succeed beyond my hopes; in a tedious
and painful ulceration of the bowels, in a consump∣tive
cough and (as appeared by expectorated pus) an
ulcer in the lungs; in a pleurisy and perpineumony.
And when a person, who for some years had been
subject to erysipelatous fevers, perceived the usual
fore-running symptoms to come on, I advised her
to drink tar-water which prevented the erysipelas.</P>
<P>6. I never knew any thing so good for the sto∣mach
as tar-water: it cures indigestion and gives
a good appetite. It is an excellent medicine in an
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
asthma. It imparts a kindly warmth and quick
circulation to the juices without heating, and is
therefore useful, not only as a pectoral and balsa∣mic,
but also as a powerful and safe deobstruent in
cachectic and hysteric cases. As it is both healing
and diuretic, it is very good for the gravel. I
believe it to be of great use in a dropsy, having
known it cure a very bad anasacra in a person
whose thirst, though very extraordinary, was in
a short time removed by the drinking of tar-water.</P>
<P>7. The usefulness of this medicine in inflamma∣tory
cases is evident, from what has been already
observed<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 5.</NOTE> And yet some perhaps may suspect
that, as the tar it self is sulphureous, tar-water
must be of a hot and inflaming nature. But it is
to be noted that all balsams contain an acid spirit,
which is in truth a volatile salt. Water is a men∣struum
that dissolves all sorts of salts, and draws
them from their subjects. Tar, therefore, being
a balsam, its salutary acid is extracted by water,
which yet is incapable of dissolving it's gross re∣sinous
parts, whose proper menstruum is spirit of
wine. Therefore tar-water, not being impregna∣ted
with resin, may be safely used in inflammatory
cases: and in fact it hath been found an admirable
febrifuge, at once the safest cooler and cordial.</P>
<P>8. The volatile salts separated by infusion from
tar, may be supposed to contain its specific vir∣tues.
Mr. Boyle and other later Chemists are a∣greed,
that fixed salts are much the same in all bo∣dies.
But it is well known that volatile salts do
greatly differ, and the easier they are separated
from the subject, the more do they possess of its
specific qualities. Now the most easy separation
is by infusion of tar in cold water, which to smell
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
and taste shewing it self well impregnated, may
be presumed to extract and retain the most pure
volatile and active particles of that vegetable
balsam.</P>
<P>9. Tar was by the ancients esteemed good
against poisons, ulcers, the bites of venomous
creatures, also for pthisical, scrophulous, paralitic
and asthmatic persons. But the method of ren∣dering
it an inoffensive medicine and agreeable to
the stomach, by extracting it's virtues in cold wa∣ter,
was unknown to them. The leaves and ten∣der
tops of pine and fir are in our times used for
diet-drinks, and allowed to be antiscorbutic and
diuretic. But the most elaborate juice, salt, and
spirit of those evergreens are to be found in tar;
whose virtues extend not to animals alone, but also
to vegetables. Mr. Evelyn in his treatise on forest
trees observes with wonder, that stems of trees,
smeared over with tar, are preserved thereby from
being hurt by the invenomed teeth of goats and
other injuries, while every other thing of an un∣ctuous
nature is highly prejudicial to them.</P>
<P>10. It seems that tar and turpentine may be had
more or less, from all sorts of pines and firs what∣soever;
and that the native spirits and essential
salts of those vegetables are the same in turpentine
and common tar. In effect this vulgar tar, which
cheapness and plenty may have rendered contemp∣tible,
appears to be an excellent balsam, contain∣ing
the virtues of most other balsams, which it
easily imparts to water, and by that means readily
and inoffensively insinuates them into the habit of
the body.</P>
<P>11. The resinous exsudations of pines and firs
are an important branch of the materia medica,
and not only useful in the prescriptions of physi∣cians,
but have been also thought otherwise con∣ducive
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
to health. Pliny tells us, that wines in the
time of the old Romans were medicated with pitch
and resin; and Jonstonus in his Dendrographia
observes, that it is wholesome to walk in groves of
pine trees, which impregnate the air with balsamic
particles. That all turpentines and resins are good
for the lungs, against gravel also and obstructions,
is no secret. And that the medicinal properties of
those drugs are found in tar water, without heat∣ing
the blood, or disordering the stomach, is con∣firmed
by experience: and particularly that pthisi∣cal
and asthmatic persons receive speedy and great
relief from the use of it.</P>
<P>12. Balsams, as all unctuous and oily medicines,
create a nauseating in the stomach. They cannot
therefore be taken in substance, so much or so
long, as to produce all those salutary effects, which,
if thoroughly mixed with the blood and juices,
they would be capable of producing. It must
therefore be a thing of great benefit, to be able to
introduce any requisite quantity of their volatile
parts into the finest ducts and capillaries, so as not
to offend the stomach, but, on the contrary, to
comfort and strengthen it in a great degree.</P>
<P>13. According to Pliny, liquid pitch (as he
calls it) or tar was obtained by setting fire to bil∣lets
of old fat pines or firs. The first running was
tar, the latter or thicker running was pitch. Theo∣phrastus
is more particular: he tells us the Mace∣donians
made huge heaps of the cloven trunks of
those trees, wherein the billets were placed erect
beside each other. That such heaps or piles of
wood were sometimes a hundred and eighty cubits
round, and sixty or even a hundred high: and
that having covered them with sods of earth to
prevent the flame from bursting forth (in which
case the tar was lost) they set on fire those huge
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
heaps of pine or fir, letting the tar and pitch run
out in a channel.</P>
<P>14. Pliny saith, it was customary for the anci∣ents,
to hold fleeces of wool over the steam of
boiling tar, and squeeze the moisture from them,
which watery substance was called pissinum. Ray
will have this to be the same with the pisselaeum
of the ancients; but Hardouin in his notes on Pli∣ny,
thinks the pisselaeum to have been produced
from the cones of cedars. What use they made
of these liquors anciently I know not: but it may
be presumed they were used in medicine, though
at present, for ought I can find, they are not used
at all.</P>
<P>15. From the manner of procuring tar<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sect. 13.</NOTE> it
plainly appears to be a natural production, lodged
in the vessels of the tree, whence it is only freed
and let lose (not made) by burning. If we may
believe Pliny, the first running or tar was called
cedrium, and was of such efficacy to preserve from
putrefaction, that in Egypt they embalmed dead
bodies with it. And to this he ascribes their mum∣mies
continuing uncorrupted for so many ages.</P>
<P>16. Some modern writers inform us that tar
flows from the trunks of pines and firs, when
they are very old, through incisions made in the
bark near the root; that pitch is tar inspissated;
and both are the oyl of the tree grown thick and
black with age and sun. The trees, like old men,
being unable to perspire, and their secretory ducts
obstructed, they are, as one may say, choaked and
stuffed with their own juice.</P>
<P>17. The method used by our colonies in Ame∣rica,
for making tar and pitch, is in effect the
same with that of the ancient Macedonians; as
appears from the account given in the Philosophical
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Transactions. And the relation of Leo Africanus,
who describes, as an eye witness, the making of
tar on Mount Atlas, agrees in substance, with the
methods used by the Macedonians of old, and the
people of New England at this day.</P>
<P>18. Jonstonus in his Dendrographia, is of opi∣nion,
that pitch was anciently made of cedar, as
well as of the pine and fir grown old and oily. It
should seem indeed that one and the same word
was used by the ancients in a large sense, so as to
comprehend the juices issuing from all those trees.
Tar and all sorts of exsudations from evergreens
are, in a general acceptation, included under the
name resin. Hard coarse resin or dry pitch is
made from tar, by letting it blaze till the moisture
is spent. Liquid resin is properly an oily viscid
juice oozing from the bark of evergreen trees, ei∣ther
spontaneously or by incision. It is thought to
be the oil of the bark inspissated by the sun. As,
it issues from the tree it is liquid, but becomes dry
and hard being condensed by the sun or by fire.</P>
<P>19. According to Theophrastus, resin was ob∣tained
by stripping off the bark from pines, and
by incisions made in the silver fir and the pitch
pine. The inhabitants of Mount Ida, he tells us,
stripped the trunk of the pine on the sunny side two
or three cubits from the ground. He observes
that a good pine might be made to yield resin
every year; an indifferent every other year; and
the weaker trees once in three years; and that
three runnings were as much as a tree could bear.
It is remarked by the same author, that a pine
doth not at once produce fruit and resin, but the
former only in its youth, the later in its old age.</P>
<P>20. Turpentine is a fine resin. Four kinds of
this are in use. The turpentine of Chios or Cy∣prus
which flows from the Turpentine tree; the
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Venice turpentine which is got by piercing the
Larch tree; the Strasburgh Turpentine which
Mr. Ray informs us is procured from the knots of
the silver fir; it is fragrant and grows yellow with
age: The fourth kind is common turpentine neither
transparent, nor so liquid as the former; and this
Mr. Ray taketh to flow from the mountain pine.
All these turpentines are useful in the same inten∣tions.
Theophrastus saith the best resin or turpen∣tine
is got from the Terebinthus growing in Syria
and some of the Greek islands. The next best
from the silver fir and pitch pine.</P>
<P>21. Turpentine is on all hands allowed to have
great medicinal virtues. Tar and it's infusion
contain those virtues. Tar-water is extremely pec∣toral
and restorative, and if I may judge, from
what experience I have had, it possesseth the most
valuable qualities ascribed to the several balsams
of Peru, of Tolu, of Capivi, and even to the balm
of Gilead; such is it's virtue in asthmas and pleu∣ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies,
in obstructions and ulcerous erosions of the
inward parts. Tar in substance mix'd with honey
I have found an excellent medicine for coughs.
Balsams as hath been already observed are apt to
offend the stomach. But tar-water may be taken
without offending the stomach. For the strength∣ening
whereof it is the best medicine I have ever
tried.</P>
<P>22. The folly of man rateth things by their
scarceness, but Providence hath made the most use∣ful
things most common. Among those liquid
oily extracts from trees and shrubs, which are
termed balsams, and valued for medicinal virtues,
tar may hold it's place as a most valuable balsam.
It's fragrancy sheweth, that it is possessed of ac∣tive
qualities, and it's oilyness, that it is fitted to
retain them. This excellent balsam may be pur∣chased
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
for a penny a pound, whereas the balsam of
Judaea, when most plenty, was sold on the very
spot that produced it, for double its weight in
silver, if we may credit Pliny; who also informs
us that the best balsam of Judaea flowed only from
the bark, and that it was adulterated with resin and
oyl of turpentine. Now comparing the vertues I
have experienced in Tar, with those I find ascribed
to the precious balm of Judaea, of Gilead, or of
Mecha (as it is diversly called) I am of opinion,
that the latter is not a medicine of more value or
efficacy than the former.</P>
<P>Pliny supposed amber to be a resin, and to distill
from some species of pine, which he gathered from
it's smell. Nevertheless it's being dug out of the
earth shews it to be a fossil, though of a very
different kind from other fossils. But thus much
is certain, that the medicinal virtues of amber are
to be found in the balsamic juices of pines and firs.
Particularly the virtues of the most valuable pre∣paration,
I mean salt of amber, are in a great
degree answered by Tar-water, as a detergent,
diaphoretic, and diuretic.</P>
<P>24. There is, as hath been already observed,
more or less oyl and balsam in all evergreen trees,
which retains the acid spirit, that principle of life
and verdure; the not retaining whereof in sufficient
quantity, causeth other plants to droop and wither.
Of these evergreen trees productive of resin, pitch,
and tar, Pliny enumerates six kinds in Europe;
Jonstonus reckons up thrice that number of the pine
and fir family. And, indeed, their number, their
variety, and their likeness makes it difficult to be
exact.</P>
<P>25. It is remarked both by Theophrastus and
Jonstonus, that trees growing in low and shady
places do not yield so good tar, as those which
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
grow in higher and more exposed situations. And
Theophrastus further observes, that the inhabitants
of mount Ida in Asia, who distinguish the Idaean
pine from the maritime, affirm, that the tar flow∣ing
from the former is in greater plenty, as well as
more fragrant than the other. Hence it should
seem, the pines or firs in the mountains of Scotland,
might be employed that way, and rendered valua∣ble;
even where the timber, by it's remoteness from
water-carriage, is of small value. What we call the
Scotch fir is falsly so called, being in truth a wild
forest pine, and (as Mr. Ray informs us) agreeing
much with the description of a pine growing on
mount Olympus in Phrygia, probably the only
place where it is found out of these islands; in
which of late years it is so much planted and culti∣vated
with so little advantage, while the cedar of
Lebanon might perhaps be raised, with little more
trouble, and much more profit and ornament.</P>
<P>26. The pines which differ from the firs in the
length and disposition of their leaves and hardness
of the wood, do not, in Pliny's account, yield so
much resin as the fir trees. Several species of both
are accurately described and delineated by the na∣turalists.
But they all agree so far as to seem related.
Theophrastus gives the preference to that resin
which is got from the silver fir and pitch tree
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) before that yielded by the pine,
which yet, he saith, is in greater plenty. Pliny,
on the contrary, affirms that the pine produceth
the smallest quantity. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>It shou'd seem therefore that
the interpreter of Theophrastus might have been
mistaken, in rendering <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> by pinus, as well as
Jonstonus, who likewise takes the pine for the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
of Theophrastus. Hardouin will have the pinus
of Pliny to have been by others called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but
by Theophrastus <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Ray thinks the common
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
fir, or picea of the Latins to be the male fir of
Theophrastus. This was probably the spruce fir;
for the picea according to Pliny, yields much resin,
loves a cold and mountainous situation, and is di∣stinguished,
tonsili facilitate, by its fitness to be
shorn, which agrees with the spruce fir, whereof I
have seen close shorn hedges.</P>
<P>27. There seems to have been some confusion in
the naming of these trees, as well among the an∣cients
as the moderns. The ancient Greek and
Latin names are by later authors applied very dif∣ferently.
Pliny himself acknowledgeth, it is not
easy even for the skilful to distinguish the trees by
their leaves, and know their sexes and kinds: and
that difficulty is since much encreased, by the dis∣covery
of many new species of that ever-green tribe,
growing in various parts of the globe. But des∣criptions
are not so easily misapplied as names.
Theophrastus tells us, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> differeth from
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, among other things, in that it is neither so
tall nor so streight, nor hath so large a leaf. The
fir he distinguisheth into male and female: the
latter is softer timber than the male, it is also a taller
and fairer tree, and this is probably the silver fir.</P>
<P>28. To say no more on this obscure business
which I leave to the criticks, I shall observe that
according to Theophrastus not only the turpentine
trees, the pines, and the firs yield resin or tar, but
also the cedars and palm trees; and the words pix
and resina are taken by Pliny in so large a sense as
to include the weepings of the Lentiscus and Cypress,
and the balms of Arabia and Judaea; all which
perhaps are near of kin, and in their most useful
qualities concur with common tar, especially the
Norvegian, which is the most liquid and best for
medicinal uses of any that I have experienced.
Those trees that grow on mountains, exposed to
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
the sun or the north wind, are reckoned by Theo∣phrastus
to produce the best and purest Tar: And
the Idaean pines were distinguished from those
growing on the plain, as yielding a thinner, sweeter,
and better scented tar, all which differences I think
I have observed, between the tar that comes from
Norway, and that which comes from low and
swampy countries.</P>
<P>29. Agreeably to the old observation of the Pe∣ripatetics,
that heat gathereth homogeneous things
and disperseth such as are heterogeneous, we find
chemistry is fitted for the analysis of bodies. But
the chemistry of nature is much more perfect than
that of human art, inasmuch as it joineth to the
power of heat that of the most exquisite mechanism.
Those who have examined the structure of trees and
plants by microscopes, have discovered an admira∣ble
variety of fine capillary tubes and vessels, fitted
for several purposes, as the imbibing or attracting
of proper nourishment, the distributing thereof
through all parts of the vegetable, the discharge
of superfluities, the secretion of particular juices.
They are found to have ducts answering to the
tracheae in animals, for the conveying of air; they
have others answering to lacteals, arteries, and
veins. They feed, digest, respire, perspire and
generate their kind, and are provided with organs
nicely fitted for all those uses.</P>
<P>30. The sap vessels are observed to be fine
tubes running up through the trunk from the root.
Secretory vessels are found in the bark, buds,
leaves, and flowers. Exhaling vessels for carrying
off excrementitious parts, are discovered through∣out
the whole surface of the vegetable. And
(though this point be not so well agreed) doctor
Grew in his Anatomy of plants, thinks there appears
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
a circulation of the sap, moving downwards in
the root, and feeding the trunk upwards.</P>
<P>31. Some difference indeed there is between
learned men, concerning the proper use of certain
parts of vegetables. But whether the discoverers
have rightly guessed at all their uses or no, thus
much is certain, that there are innumerable fine
and curious parts in a vegetable body, and a won∣derful
similitude or analogy between the mechanism
of plants and animals. And perhaps some will
think it not unreasonable to suppose the mechanism
of plants more curious than even that of animals,
if we consider not only the several juices secreted
by different parts of the same plant, but also, the
endless variety of juices drawn and formed out of
the same soil, by various species of vegetables;
which must therefore differ in an endless variety,
as to the texture of their absorbent vessels and se∣cretory
ducts.</P>
<P>32. A body, therefore, either animal or vege∣table,
may be considered as an organised system of
tubes and vessels, containing several sorts of fluids.
And as fluids are moved through the vessels of
animal bodies, by the systole and diastole of the
heart, the alternate expansion and condensation of
the air, and the oscillations in the membranes and
tunicks of the vessels; even so by means of air ex∣panded
and contracted in the tracheae or vessels
made up of elastic fibres, the sap is propelled
through the arterial tubes of a plant, and the ve∣getable
juices, as they are rarefied by heat or con∣densed
by cold, will either ascend and evaporate
into air, or descend in the form of a gross liquor.</P>
<P>33. Juices therefore, first purified by straining
through the fine pores of the root, are afterwards
exalted by the action of the air and the vessels of
the plant, but, above all, by the action of the sun's
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
light; which at the same time that it heats, doth
wonderfully rarefy and raise the sap; till it per∣spires
and forms an atmosphere, like the effluvia of
animal bodies. And though the leaves are suppos∣ed
to perform principally the office of lungs,
breathing out excrementitious vapours and draw∣ing
in alimentary; yet it seems probable, that the
reciprocal actions of repulsion and attraction, are
performed all over the surface of vegetables, as
well as animals. In which reciprocation, Hippo∣crates
supposeth the manner of nature's acting, for
the nourishment and health of animal bodies, chie∣fly
to consist. And, indeed, what share of a plant's
nourishment is drawn through the leaves and bark,
from that ambient heterogeneous fluid called air, is
not easy to say. It seems very considerable and al∣together
necessary, as well to vegetable as animal
life.</P>
<P>34. It is an opinion received by many, that the
sap circulates in plants as the blood in animals:
that it ascends through capillary arteries in the
trunk, into which are inosculated other vessels of
the bark answering to veins, which bring back to
the root the remainder of the sap, over and above
what had been deposited, during it's ascent by the
arterial vessels, and secreted for the several uses of
the vegetable throughout all it's parts, stem,
branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit. Others deny
this circulation, and affirm that the sap doth not
return through the bark vessels. It is nevertheless
agreed by all, that there are ascending and descend∣ing
juices; while some will have the ascent and de∣scent
to be a circulation of the same juices through
different vessels: others will have the ascending
juice to be one sort attracted by the root, and the
descending another imbibed by the leaves, or ex∣tremities
of the branches: lastly, others think that
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
the same juice, as it is rarefied or condensed by
heat or cold, rises and subsides in the same tube.
I shall not take upon me to decide this controversy.
Only I cannot help observing, that the vulgar ar∣gument
from analogy between plants and animals
loseth much of it's force, if it be considered, that
the supposed circulating of the sap, from the root or
lacteals through the arteries, and thence return∣ing,
by inosculations, through the veins or bark
vessels to the root or lacteals again, is in no sort
conformable or analogous to the circulation of the
blood.</P>
<P>35. It is sufficient to observe, what all must ac∣knowledge,
that a plant or tree is a very nice and
complicated machine<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">30, 31.</NOTE>; by the several parts and
motions whereof, the crude juices admitted through
the absorbent vessels, whether of the root, trunk,
or branches, are variously mixed, separated, alte∣red,
digested, and exalted in a very wonderful
manner. The juice as it passeth in and out, up
and down, through tubes of different textures,
shapes, and sizes, and is affected by the alternate
compression and expansion of elastic vessels, by the
vicissitudes of seasons, the changes of weather, and
the various action of the solar light, grows still
more and more elaborate.</P>
<P>36. There is therefore no chemistry like that of
nature, which addeth to the force of fire, the most
delicate, various, and artificial percolation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">29.</NOTE> The
incessant action of the sun upon the elements of
air, earth, and water, and on all sorts of mixed
bodies, animal, vegetable and fossil, is supposed
to perform all sorts of chemical operations. Whence
it should follow, that the air contains all sorts of
chemic productions, the vapours, fumes, oils, salts,
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
and spirits of all the bodies we know: from which
general aggregate or mass, those that are proper
being drawn in, through the fine vessels of the
leaves, branches, and stem of the tree, undergo
in its various organs, new alterations, secretions,
and digestions, till such time a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they assume the
most elaborate form.</P>
<P>37. Nor is it to be wondered, that the peculiar
texture of each plant or tree, co-operating with the
solar fire and pre-existing juices, should so alter the
fine nourishment drawn from earth and air,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">33.</NOTE> as
to produce various specific qualities of great effica∣cy
in medicine: especially if it be considered that
in the opinion of learned men, there is an influ∣ence
on plants derived from the sun, besides its
mere heat. Certainly doctor Grew, that curious
anatomist of plants, holds the solar influence to
differ from that of a mere culinary fire, otherwise
than by being only a more temperate and equal
heat.</P>
<P>38. The alimentary juice taken into the lacteals,
whether of animals or vegetables, consists of oily,
aqueous, and saline particles, which being dissolv∣ed,
volatilised, and diversly agitated, part thereof
is spent and exhaled into the air; and that part
which remains is by the oeconomy of the plant, and
action of the sun, strained, purified, concocted,
and ripened into an inspissated oil or balsam, and
deposited in certain cells placed chiefly in the
bark, which is thought to answer the panniculus
adiposus in animals, defending trees from the wea∣ther,
and, when in sufficient quantity, rendering
them evergreen. This balsam, weeping or sweat∣ing
through the bark, hardens into resin; and this
most copiously in the several species of pines and
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
firs, whose oil being in greater quantity, and more
tenacious of the acid spirit or vegetable soul (as
perhaps it may not improperly be called) abides the
action of the sun, and attracting the sun beams, is
thereby exalted and enriched, so as to become a
most noble medicine; such is the last product of a
tree, perfectly maturated by time and sun.</P>
<P>39. It is remarked by Theophrastus, that all
plants and trees while they put forth have most
humour, but when they have ceased to germinate
and bear, then the humour is strongest and most
sheweth the nature of the plant, and that, there∣fore,
trees yielding resin should be cut after ger∣mination.
It seems also very reasonable to sup∣pose
the juice of old trees, whose organs bring no
new sap, should be better ripened than that of
others.</P>
<P>40. The aromatic flavours of vegetables seem
to depend upon the sun's light, as much as colours.
As in the production of the later, the reflecting
powers of the object, so in that of the former,
the attractive and organical powers of the plant
co-operatate with the sun<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">36, 37.</NOTE> And as from Sir
Isaac Newton's experiments it appears, that all co∣lours
are virtually in the white light of the sun,
and shew themselves when the rays are separated
by the attracting and repelling powers of objects,
even so the specific qualities of the elaborate juices
of plants, seem to be virtually or eminently contain∣ed
in the solar light, and are actually exhibited
upon the separation of the rays, by the peculiar
powers of the capillary organs in vegetables, at∣tracting
and imbibing certain rays, which produce
certain flavours and qualities, in like manner as
certain rays being reflected, produce certain co∣lours.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
41. It hath been observed by some curious ana∣tomists,
that the secretory vessels in the glands of
animal bodies are lined with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine down, which in
different glands is of different colours. And it is
thought, that each particular down, being origi∣nally
imbued with it's own proper juice, attracts
none but that sort; by which means so many vari∣ous
juices are secreted in different parts of the body.
And perhaps there may be something analogous to
this, in the fine absorbent vessels of plants, which
may co-operate towards producing that endless va∣riety
of juices, elaborated in plants from the same
earth and air.</P>
<P>42. The balsam or essential oil of vegetables
contains a spirit, wherein consist the specific quali∣ties,
the smell and taste of the plant. Boerhaave
holds the native presiding spirit to be neither, oil,
salt, earth, or water; but somewhat too fine and
subtile to be caught alone and rendered visible to
the eye. This when suffered to fly off, for in∣stance,
from the oil of rosemary, leaves it desti∣tute
of all flavour. This spark of life, this spirit
or soul, if we may so say, of the vegetable departs
without any sensible diminution of the oil or water
wherein it was lodged.</P>
<P>43. It should seem that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orms, souls, or
principles of vegetable life, subsist in the light or
solar emanation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">40.</NOTE> which in respect of the mi∣crocosm
is what the animal spirit is to the micro∣cosm;
the interior tegument, the subtile instru∣ment
and vehicle of power. No wonder then that
the ens primum or scintilla spirituosa, as it is cal∣led,
of plants should be a thing so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine and sugaci∣cious
as to escape our nicest search. It is evident
that nature at the sun's approach vegetates; and
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
languishes at his recess; this terrestrial globe seeming
only a matrix disposed and prepared to receive life
from his light; whence Homer in his hymns styleth
earth the wife of heaven, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>44. The luminous spirit which is the form or
life of a plant, from whence it's differences and
properties flow, is somewhat extremely volatile.
It is not the oil, but a thing more subtile whereof
oil is the vehicle, which retains it from flying off,
and is lodged in several parts of the plant, parti∣cularly
in the cells of the bark and in the seeds.
This oil purified and exalted by the organical
powers of the plant, and agitated by warmth,
becomes a proper receptacle of the spirit; part of
which spirit exhales through the leaves and flowers,
and part is arrested by this unctuous humour that
detains it in the plant. It is to be noted this essen∣tial
oil animated, as one may say, with the fla∣vour
of the plant is very different from any spirit,
that can be procured from the same plant by fer∣mentation.</P>
<P>45. Light impregnates air,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">37, 4<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> air impregnates
vapour; and this becomes a watery juice by distil∣lation
having risen first in the cold still with a
kindly gentle heat. This fragrant vegetable water is
possessed of the specific odour and taste of the
plant. It is remarked that distilled oils added to
water for counterfeiting the vegetable water can
never equal it, artificial chemistry falling short of
the natural.</P>
<P>46. The less violence is used to nature the bet∣ter
its produce. The juice of olives or grapes is∣suing
by the light pressure is best. Resins that
drop from the branches spontaneously, or ooze
upon the slightest incision, are the finest and most
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
fragrant. And infusions are observed to act more
strongly than decoctions of plants, the more sub∣tile
and volatile salts and spirits, which might be
lost or corrupted by the latter, being obtained in
their natural state by the former. It is also obser∣ved
that the finest, purest, and most volatile part
is that which first ascends in destillation. And,
indeed, it should seem the lightest and most active
particles required least force to disengage them from
the subject.</P>
<P>47. The salts, therefore, and more active spirits
of the tar are got by infusion in cold water: but
the resinous part is not to be dissolved thereby
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7.</NOTE>. Hence the prejudice which some perhaps may
entertain against Tar-water, as a medicine, the
use whereof might inflame the blood by it's sul∣phur
and resin, appears to be not well grounded;
it being indeed impregnated with a fine acid spi∣rit,
balsamic, cooling, diuretic, and possessed of
many other virtues<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sect. 42, 44.</NOTE>. Spirits are supposed to
consist of salts and phlegm, probably too some∣what
of a fine oily nature, differing from oil in
that it mixeth with water, and agreeing with oil.
in that it runneth in rivulets by destillation. Thus
much is allowed, that the water, earth, and fixed
salt are the same in all plants; that, therefore,
which differenceth a plant or makes it what it is,
the native spark or form, in the language of the
chemists or schools, is none of those things, nor
yet the finest oil, which seemeth only it's recep∣tacle
or vehicle. It is observed by chemists, that
all sorts of balsamic wood afford an acid spirit,
which is the volatile oily salt of the vegetable:
Herein is chiefly contained their medicinal virtues,
and by the trials I have made it appears, that the
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
acid spirit in tar-water, possesseth the virtues, in
an eminent degree, of that of guaiacum, and other
medicinal woods.</P>
<P>48. Qualities in a degree too strong for human
nature to subdue, and assimilate to it self, must
hurt the constitution. All acids, therefore, may
not be useful or innocent. But this seemeth an
acid so thoroughly concocted, so gentle, bland, and
temperate, and withal a spirit so fine and volatile,
as readily to enter the smallest vessels, and be assi∣milated
with the utmost ease.</P>
<P>49. If any one were minded to dissolve some
of the resin, together with the salt or spirit, he
need only mix some spirit of wine with the water.
But such an intire solution of resins and gums, as
to qualify them for entering and pervading the
animal system, like the fine acid spirit that first
flies off from the subject, is perhaps impossible to
obtain. It is an apopthegm of the chemists, deri∣ved
from Helmont, that whoever can make myrrh
soluble by the human body, has the secret of pro∣longing
his days: and Boerhaave owns that there
seems to be truth in this, from it's resisting putre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>action.
Now this quality is as remarkable in tar,
with which the ancients embalmed and preserved
dead bodies. And though Boerhaave himself, and
other chemists before him, have given methods
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or making solutions of myrrh, yet it is by means
of alcohol which extracts only the inflammable
parts. And it doth not seem that any solution
of myrrh is impregnated with it's salt or acid spi∣rit.
It may not, therefore, seem strange if this
water should be sound more beneficial for procu∣ring
health and long life, than any solution of
myrrh whatsoever.</P>
<P>50. Certainly divers resins and gums may have
virtues, and yet not be able for their grossness to
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
pass the lacteals and other finer vessels, nor yet,
perhaps, readily impart those virtues to a men∣struum,
that may with safety and speed convey
them throughout the human body. Upon all
which accounts, I believe tar-water will be found
to have singular advantages. It is observed that
acid spirits prove the stronger, by how much the
greater degree of heat is required to raise them.
And indeed, there seemeth to be no acid more
gentle than this, obtained by the simple affusion of
cold water; which carries off from the subject the
most light and subtile parts, and, if one may so
speak, the very flower of it's specific qualities.
And here it is to be noted, that the volatile salt
and spirit of vegetables do, by gently stimulating
the solids, attenuate the fluids contained in them,
and promote secretions, and that they are pene∣trating
and active, contrary to the general nature
of other acids.</P>
<P>51. It is a great maxim for health, that the
juices of the body be kept fluid in a due propor∣tion.
Therefore, the acid volatile spirit in tar-water,
at once attenuating and cooling in a mode∣rate
degree, must greatly conduce to health, as a
mild salutary deobstruent, quickening the circula∣tion
of the fluids without wounding the solids,
thereby gently removing of preventing those ob∣structions,
which are the great and general cause
of most chronical diseases; in this manner answer∣ing
to the antihysterics, assa foetida galbanum,
myrrh, amber, and, in general, to all the resins
and gums of trees or shrubs useful in nervous
cases.</P>
<P>52. Warm water is it self a deobstruent. There∣fore
the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion of tar drank warm, is easier insi∣nuated
into all the nice capillary vessels, and acts,
not only by virtue of the balsam, but also by that
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
of the vehicle. It's taste, it's diuretic quality, it's
being so great a cordial, shew the activity of this
medicine. And at the same time that it quickens
the sluggish blood of the hysterical, it's balsamic
oily nature abates the too rapid motion of the sharp
thin blood in those who are hectic. There is a
lentour and smoothness in the blood of healthy
strong people; on the contrary, there is often an
acrimony and solution in that of weakly morbid
persons. The fine particles of tar are not only
warm and active, they are also balsamic and emol∣lient,
softening and enriching the sharp and vapid
blood, and healing the erosions occasioned thereby
in the blood-vessels and glands.</P>
<P>53. Tar-water possesseth the stomachic and car∣diac
qualities of elixir proprietatis, Stoughton's
drops, and many such tinctures and extracts, with
this difference, that it worketh it's effect more
safely, as it hath nothing of that spirit of wine,
which, however mixed and disguised, may yet be well
accounted a poison in some degree.</P>
<P>54. Such medicines are supposed to be diapho∣retic,
which being of an active and subtile nature,
pass through the whole system, and work their
effect in the finest capillaries and perspiratory
ducts, which they gently cleanse and open. Tar-water
is extremely well fitted to work by such an
insensible diaphoresis, by the sineness and activity
of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s acid volatile spirit. And surely those parts
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght to be very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, which can scour the per∣spiratory
ducts, under the scarf skin or cuticle,
i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it be true that one grain of sand, would co∣ver
the mouths of more than a hundred thou∣sand.</P>
<P>55. Another way wherein tar-water operates,
is by urine, than which perhaps none is more safe
and effectual, for cleansing the blood and carrying
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
off it's salts. But it seems to produce it's princi∣pal
effect as an alterative, sure and easy, much
safer than those vehement purgative, emetic, and
salivating medicines, which do violence to nature.</P>
<P>56. An obstruction of some vessels causeth the
blood to move more swiftly in other vessels, which
are not obstructed. Hence manifold disorders. A
liquor that dilutes and attenuates resolves the con∣cretions
which obstruct. Tar-water is such a li∣quor.
It may be said, indeed, of common water,
that it attenuates, also of mercurial preparations
that they attenuate. But it should be considered
that mere water only distends the vessels and there∣by
weakens their tone; and that Mercury by it's
great momentum may justly be suspected of hurt∣ing
the fine capillaries, which two deobstruents
therefore might easily overact their parts, and (by
lessening the force of the elastic vessels) remotely
produce those concretions they are intended to
remove.</P>
<P>57. Weak and rigid fibres are looked on by
the most able physicians, as sources of two differ∣ent
classes of distempers: a sluggish motion of the
liquids occasions weak fibres: therefore tar-water
is good to strengthen them as it gently accelerates
their contents. On the other hand, being an un∣ctuous
bland <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luid it moistens and so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tens the dry
and stiff <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibres: and so proves a remedy for both
extremes.</P>
<P>58. Common soaps are compositions of lixivial
salt and oil. The corrosive acrimony of the sa∣line
particles, being softened by the mixture of an
unctuous substance they insinuate themselves into
the small ducts with less difficulty and danger.
The combination of these different substances
makes up a very subtile and active medicine, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it∣ted
for mixing with all humours, and resolving
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
all obstructions. Soap therefore is justly esteemed
a most efficacious medicine in many distempers.
Alcaline soap is allowed to be cleansing, attenuat∣ing,
opening, resolving, sweetening; it is pectoral,
vulnerary, diuretic, and hath other good qualities
which are also to be found in Tar-water. It is
granted, that oyl and acid salts combined together
exist in vegetables, and that consequently there are
acid soaps as well as alcaline. And the sapona∣ceous
nature of the acid vegetable spirits, is what
renders them so diuretic, sudorific, penetrating,
abstersive and resolving. Such, for instance, is the
acid spirit of Guaiacum. And all these same virtues
seem to be in Tar-water in a mild and salutary
degree.</P>
<P>59. It is the general opinion that all acids coa∣gulate
the blood. Boerhaave excepts vinegar which
he holds to be a soap, inasmuch as it is found to
contain an oyl as well as an acid spirit. Hence it
is both unctuous and penetrating, a powerful anti∣phlogistic,
and preservative against corruption and
infection. Now it seems evident that Tar-water
is a soap as well as vinegar. For though it be
the character of resin, which is an inspissated gross
oyl, not to dissolve in water<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 47.</NOTE>, yet the salts at∣tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct
some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine particles of essential oyl: which fine
oyl serves as a vehicle for the acid salts, and shews
itself in the colour of the Tar-water: for all pure
salts are colourless. And though the resin will
not dissolve in water, yet the subtile oyl, in which
the vegetable salts are lodged, may as well mix
with water as vinegar doth, which contains both
oyl and salt. And as the oyl in Tar-water discovers
itself to the eye, so the acid salts do manifest
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
themselves to the taste. Tar-water therefore is a
soap, and as such hath the medicinal qualities of
soaps.</P>
<P>60. It operates more gently as the acid salts
lose their acrimony being sheathed in oyl, and
thereby approaching the nature of neutral salts,
are more benign and friendly to the animal sy∣stem:
and more effectually, as by the help of a vo∣latile
smooth insinuating oyl, those same salts are
more easily introduced into the capillary ducts.
Therefore in fevers and epidemical distempers it
is (and I have found it so) as well as in chroni∣cal
diseases, a most safe and efficacious medicine,
being good against too great fluidity as a balsa∣mic,
and good against viscidity as a soap. There
is something in the fiery corrosive nature of lixi∣vial
salts, which makes alcaline soap a dangerous
remedy in all cases where an inflammation is appre∣hended.
And as inflammations are often occasioned
by obstructions, it should seem an acid soap was
much the safer deobstruent.</P>
<P>61. Even the best turpentines, however famous
for their vulnerary and detergent qualities, have
yet been observed by their warmth to dispose to
inflammatory tumours. But the acid spirit<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7. 8.</NOTE> being
in so great proportion in Tar-water renders it a
cooler and safer medicine. And the aetherial oyl of
turpentine, though an admirable dryer, healer, and
anodyne, when outwardly applyed to wounds and
ulcers, and not less useful in cleansing the urinary
passages and healing their ulcerations, yet is known
to be of a nature so very relaxing as sometimes to
do much mischief. Tar-water is not attended with
the same ill effects, which I believe are owing in
a great measure to the aetherial oyls being deprived
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
of the acid spirit in distillation, which vellicating
and contracting as a stimulus might have proved
a conterpoise to the excessive lubricating and re∣laxing
qualities of the oyl.</P>
<P>62. Woods in decoction do not seem to yield so
ripe and elaborate a juice, as that which is depo∣sited
in the cells or loculi terebinthiaci, and spon∣taneously
oozes from them. And indeed though
the balsam of Peru obtained by boiling wood and
scumming the decoction, be a very valuable medi∣cine
and of great account in divers cases, particu∣larly
asthmas, nephretic pains, nervous colics and
obstructions, yet I do verily think (and I do not
say this without experience) that Tar-water is a
more efficacious remedy in all those cases than even
that costly drug.</P>
<P>63. It hath been already observed that the resto∣rative
pectoral antihysterical virtues of the most pre∣cious
balsams and gums are possessed in a high de∣gree
by Tar-water<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 9. 21. 22. 23.</NOTE>. And I do not know any
purpose answered by the wood drinks, for which
Tar-water may not be used with at least equal suc∣cess.
It contains the virtues even of Guaiacum
which seems the most efficacious of all the woods,
warming and sweetening the humours, diaphoretic
and useful in gouts, dropsies and rheums, as well
as in the foul disease. Nor should it seem strange,
if the virtues obtained by boiling an old dry wood
prove inferior to those extracted from a balsam.</P>
<P>64. There is a fine volatile spirit in the waters
of Geronster, the most esteemed of all the fountains
about Spa, but whose waters do not bear transport∣ing.
The stomachic, cardiac, and diuretic qualities
of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountain somewhat resemble those of Tar-water,
which, if I am not greatly mistaken, con∣tains
the virtues of the best chalibeat and sulphur∣eous
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
waters; with this difference, that those waters
are apt to affect the head in taking, which Tar-water
is not. Besides there is a regimen of diet
to be observed, especially with chalybeat waters,
which I never found necessary with this. Tar-water
layeth under no restraint either as to diet,
hours, or employment. A man may study, or
exercise or repose, keep his own hours, pass his
time either within or without, and take wholesome
nourishment of any kind.</P>
<P>65. The use of mineral waters, however excel∣lent
for the nerves and stomach, is often suspended
by colds and inflammatory disorders; in which they
are acknowledged to be very dangerous. Whereas
Tar-water is so far from hurting in those cases, or
being discontinued on that account, that it greatly
contributes to their cure<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>66. Cordials, vulgarly so called, act immedi∣ately
on the stomach, and by consent of nerves
on the head. But medicines of an operation too
fine and light to produce a sensible effect in the
primae viae, may, nevertheless, in their passages
through the capillaries, operate on the sides of those
small vessels, in such manner as to quicken their
oscillations, and consequently the motion of their
contents, producing in issue and effect, all the be∣nefits
of a cordial much more lasting and salutary
than those of fermented spirits, which by their
caustic and coagulating qualities do incomparably
more mischief than good. Such a cardiac medi∣cine
is Tar-water. The transient fits of mirth,
produced from fermented liquors, are attended
with proportionable depressions of spirit in their
intervals. But the calm chearfulness arising from
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
this water of health (as it may be justly called) is
permanent. In which it emulates the virtues of
that famous plant Gen Seng, so much valued in
China as the only cordial that raiseth the spirits
without depressing them. Tar-water is so far from
hurting the nerves as common cordials do, that it
is highly useful in cramps, spasms of the viscera,
and paralytic numbness.</P>
<P>67. Emetics are on certain occasions administred
with great success. But the overstraining and
weakening of nature may be very justly apprehend∣ed
from a course of emetics. They are nevertheless
prescribed and substituted for exercise. But it is
well remarked in Plato's Timaeus that vomits and
purges are the worst exercise in the world. There
is something in the mild operation of Tar-water,
that seems more friendly to the oeconomy, and
forwards the digestions and secretions in a way more
natural and benign, the mildness of this medicine
being such that I have known children take it, for
above six months together, with great benefit, and
without any inconvenience; and after long and
repeated experience I do esteem it a most excellent
diet drink fitted to all seasons and ages.</P>
<P>68. It is I think allowed that the origine of
the gout lies in a faulty digestion. And it is
remarked by the ablest physicians, that the gout
is so difficult to cure, because heating medicines
aggravate it's immediate, and cooling it's remote
cause. But Tar-water, although it contain active
principles that strenghten the digestion beyond any
thing I know, and consequently must be highly
useful, either to prevent or lessen the following
fit, or by envigorating the blood to cast it upon
the extremities, yet it is not of so heating a na∣ture
as to do harm even in the fit. Nothing is
<PB N="25" REF="32" MS="y"/>
more difficult or disagreeable than to argue men
out of their prejudices; I shall not therefore enter
into controversies on this subject, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dis∣pute
and object, shall leave the decision to time
and trial.</P>
<P>69. In the modern practice, soap, op<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um, and
mercury bid fairest for universal medicines. The
first of these is highly spoken of. But then those
who magnify it most, except against the use of it in
such cases where the obstruction is attended with a
putrefactive alkali, or where an inflammatory dis∣position
appears. It is acknowledged to be very
dangerous in a pthisis, fever, and some other
cases in which tar-water is not only safe but use∣ful.</P>
<P>70. Opium, though a medicine of great extent
and efficacy, yet is frequently known to produce
grievous disorders in hysterical or hypochondriacal
persons, who make a great part, perhaps the
greatest of those who lead sedentary lives in these
islands. Besides, upon all constitutions dangerous
errors may be committed in the use of opium.</P>
<P>71. Mercury hath of late years become a medi∣cine
of very general use. The extreme minuteness,
mobility, and momentum of its parts, rendering
it a most powerful cleanser of all obstructions,
even in the most minute capillaries. But then we
should be cautious in the use of it, if we consider,
that the very thing which gives it power or do∣ing
good above other deobstruents, doth also dis∣pose
it to do mischief. I mean its great momentum,
the weight of it being about ten times that of
blood, and the momentum being the joint pro∣duct
of the weight and velocity, it must needs
operate with great force; and may it not be justly
feared, that so great a sorce entring the minutest
<PB N="26" REF="33" MS="y"/>
vessels, and breaking the obstructed matter, might
also break or wound the fine tender coats of those
small vessels, and so bring on the untimely effects
of old age, producing more, perhaps, and worse
obstructions than those it removed? Similar conse∣quences
may justly be apprehended from other mi∣neral
and ponderous medicines. Therefore, upon
the whole, there will not perhaps be found any
medicine, more general in its use, or more salu∣tary
in its effects than tar-water.</P>
<P>72. To suppose that all distempers arising from
very different, and it may be from contrary
causes, can be cured by one and same medi∣cine
must seem chimerical. But it may with truth
be affirmed, that the virtue of tar-water extends to
a surprising variety of cases very distant and un∣like
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 3, 4, 5, 6▪ 21▪ <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> This I have experienced in my neigh∣bours,
my family, and myself. And as I live in a
remote corner among poor neighbours, who for
want of a regular physician have often recourse to
me, I have had frequent opportunities of trial,
which convince me it is of so just a temperament as
to be an enemy to all extremes. I have known it
do great good in a cold watery constitution, as a
cardiac and stomachic; and at the same time allay
heat and feverish thirst in another. I have known it
correct costive habits in some, and the contrary
habit in others. Nor will this seem incredible if
it be considered that middle qualities naturally re∣duce
the extreme. Warm water, for instance,
mixed with hot and cold will lessen the heat in
that, and the cold in this.</P>
<P>73. They who know the great virtues of com∣mon
soap, whose coarse lixivial salts are the pro∣duct
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
of culinary fire, will not think it incredible,
that virtues of mighty force and extent should be
found in a fine acid soap<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">58.</NOTE> the salts and oil
whereof, are a most elaborate product of nature
and the solar light.</P>
<P>74. It is certain tar-water warms, and therefore
some may perhaps still think it cannot cool. The
more effectually to remove this prejudice, let it be
farther considered, that, as on one the hand, opposite
causes do sometimes produce the same effect, for
instance, heat by rarefaction and cold by conden∣sation
do both increase the air's elasticity: so on
the other hand, the same cause shall sometime
produce opposite effects: heat for instance in one
degree thins, in another coagulates the blood. It
is not therefore strange that tar-water should warm
one habit, and cool another, have one good effect
on a cold constitution, and another good effect on
an inflamed one, nor, if this be so, that it should
cure opposite disorders. All which justifies to rea∣son,
what I have often found true in fact. The
salts, the spirits, the heat of tar-water are of a
temperature congenial to the constitution of a man
which receives from it a kindly warmth, but no
inflaming heat. It was remarkable that two chil∣dren
in my neighbourhood, being in a course of
tar-water, upon an intermission of it, never failed
to have their issues inflamed by a humour much more
hot and sharp than at other times. But its great
use in the small-pox, pleurisies, and fevers, is a
sufficient proof that tar-water is not of an inflam∣ing
nature.</P>
<P>75. I have dwelt the longer on this head, because
some gentlemen of the faculty have thought fit to
<PB N="28" REF="35" MS="y"/>
declare that tar-water must enflame, and that they
would never visit any patient in a fever, who had
been a drinker of it. But I will venture to affirm,
that it is so far from increasing a feverish inflam∣mation,
that it is on the contrary a most ready means
to allay and extinguish it. It is of admirable use
in fevers, being at the same time the surest, safest
and most effectual both paregoric and cordial; for
the truth of which, I appeal to any person's ex∣perience,
who shall take a large draught of it
milk warm in the paroxysm of a fever, even when
plain water or herb teas shall be found to have little
or no effect. To me it seems that it's singular and
surprizing use in fevers of all kinds, were there
nothing else, would be alone sufficient to recom∣mend
it to the public.</P>
<P>76. The best physicians make the idea of a fe∣ver
to consist in a too great velocity of the heart's
motion, and too great resistance at the capillaries.
Tar-water, as it softens and gently stimulates those
nice vessels, helps to propel their contents, and so
contributes to remove the latter part of the disor∣der.
And for the former, the irritating acrimony
which accelerates the motion of the heart is dilute∣ed
by watery, corrected by acid, and softened by
balsamic remedies, all which intentions are answer∣ed
by this aqueous acid balsamic medicine. Be∣sides
the viscid juices coagulated by the febrile heat
are resolved by tar-water as a soap, and not too far
resolved, as it is a gentle acid soap; to which we
may add, that the peccant humours and salts are
carried off by its diaphoretic and diuretic quali∣ties.</P>
<P>77. I found all this confirmed by my own expe∣rience
in the late sickly season of the year one thou∣sand
seven hundred and forty-one, having had
<PB N="29" REF="36" MS="y"/>
twenty-five fevers in my own family cured by this
medicinal water, drunk copiously. The same me∣thod
was practised on several of my poor neigh∣bours
with equal success. It suddenly calmed the
feverish anxieties, and seemed every glass to re∣fresh,
and in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use life and spirit into the patient.
At first some of those patients had been vomited;
but afterwards I found that without vomiting,
bleeding, blistering or any other evacuation or me∣dicine
whatever, very bad severs could be cured by
the sole drinking of tar-water milk warm, and in
good quantity, perhaps a large glass every hour
taken in bed. And it was remarkable, that such
as were cured by this comfortable cordial, reco∣vered
health and spirits at once, while those who
had been cured by evacuations often languished
long, even after the fever had left them, before
they could recover of their medicines and regain
their strength.</P>
<P>78. In peripneumonies and pleurisies I have ob∣served
tar-water to be excellent, having known
some pleuritic persons cured without bleeding, by
a blister early applied to the stitch, and the copi∣ous
drinking of tar-water, four or five quarts, or
even more in four and twenty hours. And I do
recommend it to farther trial, whether in all cases
of a pleurisy, one moderate bleeding, a blister on
the spot and plenty of tepid tar-water may not suffice,
without those repeated and immoderate
bleedings, the bad effects of which are perhaps
never got over. I do even suspect that a pleuritic
patient betaking himself to bed betimes, and
drinking very copiously of tar-water, may be cur∣ed
by that alone without bleeding, blistering, or
any other medicine whatever: certainly I have
found this succeed at a glass every half hour.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="37"/>
79. I have known a bloody flux of long conti∣nuance,
after divers medicine had been tried in
vain, cured by tar-water. But that which I take
to be the most speedy and effectual remedy in a
bloody flux, is a clyster of an ounce of common
brown rosin dissolved over a fire in two ounces of
oil, and added to a pint of broth, which not long
since I had frequent occasion of trying, when that
distemper was epidemical. Nor can I say that any
to whom I advised it miscarried. This experi∣ment
I was led to make by the opinion I had of
tar as a balsamic: and rosin is only tar inspis∣sated.</P>
<P>80. Nothing that I know corroborates the sto∣mach
so much as tar-water<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 68.</NOTE> Whence it fol∣lows,
that it must be of singular use to persons af∣flicted
with the gout. And from what I have observed
in five or six instances, I do verily believe it the
best and safest medicine either to prevent the gout,
or so to strengthen nature against the fit, as to
drive it from the vitals. Doctor Sydenham in his
treatise of the gout, delares that whoever finds a
medicine the most efficacious for strengthening di∣gestion,
will do more service in the cure of that
and other chronical distempers, than he can even
form a notion of. And I leave it to trial, whether
tar-water be not that medicine, as I myself am per∣suaded
it is, by all the experiments I could make.
But in all trials I wou'd recommend discretion; for
instance, a man with the gout in his stomach ought
not to drink cold tar-water. This essay leaves room
for future experiment in every part of it, not pre∣tending
to be a compleat treatise.</P>
<P>81. It is evident to sense, that blood, urine,
and other animal juices, being let to stand, soon
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
contract a great acrimony. Juices, therefore from
a bad digestion, retained and stagnating in the
body, grow sharp and putrid. Hence a ferment∣ing
heat, the immediate cause of the gout. The
curing this by cooling medicines, as they would
increase the antecedent cause, must be a vain at∣tempt.
On the other hand, spices and spirituous
liquors, while they contribute to remove the ante∣cedent
cause, or bad digestion, would by infla∣ming
the blood increase the proximate or immedi∣ate
cause of the gout, to wit, the fermenting heat.
The scope therefore must be, to find a medicine
that shall corroborate, but not inflame. Bitter
herbs are recommended; but they are weak in com∣parison
of tar-water.</P>
<P>82. The great force of tar-water, to correct the
acrimony of the blood, appears in nothing more
than in the cure of a gangrene, from an internal
cause; which was performed on a servant of my
own, by prescribing the copious and constant use
of tar-water for a few weeks. From my repre∣senting
tar-water as good for so many things, some
perhaps may conclude it is good for nothing. But
charity obligeth me to say, what I know, and what
I think, howsoever it may be taken. Men may
censure and object as they please, but I appeal to
time and experiment. Effects misimputed, cases
wrong told, circumstances overlooked, perhaps
too, prejudices and partialities against truth, may
for a time prevail and keep her at the bottom of
her well, from whence nevertheless she emergeth
sooner or later, and strikes the eyes of all who do
not keep them shut.</P>
<P>83. Boerhaave thinks a specific may be found,
for that peculiar venom, which infects the blood in
the small-pox, and that the prospect of so great
a public benefit should stir up men to search for it.
<PB N="32" REF="39" MS="y"/>
It's wonderful success in preventing and mitigating
that distemper,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2, 3.</NOTE> would incline one to suspect
that tar-water is such a specific. Some think an
Erysipelas and the Plague differ only in degree.
If so, tar-water should be useful in the Plague, for
I have known it cure an Erysipelas.</P>
<P>84. Tar-water, as cleansing, healing, and bal∣samic,
is good in all disorders of the urinary passa∣ges,
whether obstructed or ulcerated. Doctor
Lister supposeth, indeed, that turpentines act by
a caustic quality, which irritates the coats of the
urinary ducts to expel sand or gravel. But it
should seem this expelling diuretic virtue, consisted
rather in the salts than the resin, and consequently
resides in the tar-water, gently stimulating by it's
salts, without the dangerous force of a caustic.
The violent operation of Ipecacuanha lies in it's
resin, but the saline extract is a gentle purge and
diuretic, by the stimulus of it's salts.</P>
<P>85. That which acts as a mild cordial,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">66.</NOTE> nei∣ther
hurting the capillary vessels as a caustic, nor
affecting the nerves, nor coagulating the juices,
must in all cases be a friend to nature, and assist
the vis vitae in it's struggle against all kinds of
contagion. And from what I have observed, tar-water
appears to me an useful preservative in all
epidemical disorders, and against all other infecti∣on
whatsoever, as well as that of the small-pox.
What effects the animi pathemata have in humane
maladies, is well known, and consequently the ge∣neral
benefit of such a cardiac cannot be doubted.</P>
<P>86. As the body is said to cloath the soul, so
the nerves may be said to constitute her inner gar∣ment.
And as the soul animates the whole, what
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
nearly touches the soul relates to all. Therefore
the asperity of tartarous salts, and the fiery acri∣mony
of alcaline salts, irritating and wounding
the nerves, produce nascent passions and anxieties
in the soul; which both aggravate distempers,
and render men's lives restless and wretched, even
when they are afflicted with no apparent distem∣per.
This is the latent spring of much woe,
spleen, and taedium vitae. Small imperceptible
irritations of the minutest fibres or filaments cau∣sed
by the pungent salts of wines and sauces, do
so shake and disturb the microcosms of high liv∣ers,
as often to raise tempests in courts and senates.
Whereas the gentle vibrations that are raised in
the nerves, by a fine subtile acid, sheathed in a
smooth volatile oil<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">59, 61.</NOTE>, softly stimulating and bra∣cing
the nervous vessels and fibres, promotes a due
circulation and secretion of the animal juices, and
creates a calm satisfied sense of health. And ac∣cordingly
I have often known tar-water procure
sleep and compose the spirits in cruel vigils, occa∣sioned
either by sickness or by too intense applica∣tion
of mind.</P>
<P>87. In diseases sometimes accidents happen from
without by mismanagement, sometimes latent cau∣ses
operate within, jointly with the specific taint
or peculiar cause of the malady. The causes of
distempers are often complicated, and there may
be something in the idiosyncrasy of the patient
that puzzles the physician. It may therefore be
presumed that no medicine is infallible, not even
in any one disorder. But as tar-water possesseth
the virtues of fortifying the stomach, as well as
purifying and invigorating the blood, beyond any
medicine that I know, it may be presumed of great
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
and general efficacy in all those numerous illnesses,
which take their rise from soul or vapid blood, or
from a bad digestion. The animal spirits are ela∣borated
from the blood. Such therefore as the
blood is, such will be the animal spirit, more or
less, weaker or stronger. This sheweth the use∣fulness
of tar-water in all hysteric and hypocon∣driac
cases; which together with the maladies
from indigestion comprise almost the whole tribe
of chronical diseases.</P>
<P>88. The scurvy may be reckoned in these cli∣mates
an universal malady, as people in general
are subject to it, and as it mixes more or less in
almost all diseases. Whether this proceeds from
want of elasticity in our air, upon which the tone
of the vessels depends, and upon that the several
secretions: or whether it proceeds from the
moisture of our climate, or the grossness of our
food, or the salts in our atmosphere, or from all
these together; thus much at least seems not
absurd to suppose, that, as physicians in Spain and
Italy are apt to suspect the venereal taint to be a
latent principle, and bear a part in every illness,
so for as good reason the scurvy should be con∣sidered
by our physicians, as having some share
in most disorders and constitutions that fall in their
way. It is certain our perspiration is not so free
as in clearer air and warmer climates. Perspirable
humours not discharged will stagnate and putrify.
A diet of animal food will be apt to render the
juices of our bodies alcalescent. Hence ichorous
and corrosive humours and many disorders. Moist
air makes viscid blood; and saline air inflames this
viscid blood. Hence broken capillaries, extrava∣sated
blood, spots and ulcers, and other s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orbutic
symptoms. The body of a man attracts and im∣bibes
the moisture and salts of the air, and what∣ever
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
floats in the atmosphere, which, as it is com∣mon
to all, so it affects all more or less.</P>
<P>89. Doctor Musgrave thinks the Devonshire
scurvy a relique of the leprosy, and that it is not
owing to the qualities of the air. But as these in∣sulars
in general live in a gross saline air, and their
vessels being less elastic, are consequently less able
to subdue and cast off what their bodies as spongees
draw in, one would be tempted to suspect the air
not a little concerned, especially in such a situation
as that of Devonshire. In all these British islands
we enjoy a great mediocrity of climate, the effect
whereof is, that we have neither heat enough to
exalt and dissipate the gross vapours, as in Italy,
nor cold enough to condense and precipitate them,
as in Sweden. So they are left floating in the air,
which we constantly breath, and imbibe through
the whole surface of our bodies. And this toge∣ther
with exhalations from coal fires, and the va∣rious
fossils wherein we abound, doth greatly con∣tribute
to render us scorbutic and hypochondriac.</P>
<P>90. There are some who derive all diseases from
the scurvy, which indeed must be allowed to create
or mimic most other maladies. Boerhaave tells us,
it produceth pleuretic, cholic, nephritic, hepatic
pains, various fevers, hot, malignant, intermitting,
dysenteries, faintings, anxieties, dropsies, consump∣tions,
convulsions, palsies, fluxes of blood. In a
word, it may be said to contain the seeds and ori∣gine
of almost all distempers. Insomuch that a
medicine which cures all sorts of scurvy, may be
presumed good for most other maladies.</P>
<P>91. The scurvy doth not only in variety of
symptoms imitate most distempers, but also when
come to a height, in degree of virulence equal the
most malignant. Of this we have a remarkable
proof, in that horrible description of the scorbutic
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
patients in the hospitals of Paris, given by mon∣sieur
Poupart, in the Memoirs of the royal aca∣demy
of sciences, for the year one thousand six
hundred and ninety-nine. That author thinks he
saw some resemblance in it to the plague of Athens.
It is hard to imagine any thing more dreadful than
the case of those men, rotting alive by the scurvy
in it's supreme degree. To obviate such putre∣faction,
I believe the most effectual method would
be, to embalm (if one may so say) the living bo∣dy
with tar-water copiously drunk; and this belief
is not without experience.</P>
<P>92. It is the received opinion that the animal
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a sound body are of a neutral, bland and
benign nature: that is, the salts in the juices past
the primae viae are neither acid nor alcaline, hav∣ing
been subdued by the constitution, and changed
into a third nature. Where the constitution wants
force to do this, the aliment is not duly assimila∣ted;
and so far as the salts retain their pristine qua∣lities,
sickly symptoms ensue, acids and alkalies not
perfectly subdued, producing weak ferments in the
juices. Hence scurvy, cachexy, and a long train
of ills.</P>
<P>93. A Cachexy or ill habit is much of the same
kind with the scurvy, proceeds from the same cau∣ses
and is attended with like symptoms, which are
so manifold and various, that the scurvy may well
be looked on as a general cachexy, infecting the
whole habit and vitiating all the digestions. Some
have reckoned as many sorts of the scurvy, as there
are different faints of the blood. Others have sup∣posed
it a collection of all illnesses together. Some
suppose it an accumulation of several diseases in
fieri. Others take it for an assemblage of the re¦liques
of old distempers.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44"/>
94. But thus much is certain, the cure of the
scurvy is no more to be attempted by strongly
active medicines than (to use the similitude of an
ingenious writer) a thorn in the flesh, or pitch on
silk to be removed by force. The viscid humour
must be gently resolved and diluted, the tone of
the vessels recovered by a moderate stimulation,
and the tender fibres and capillary vessels gradually
cleared from the concreted stuff, that adheres and
obstructs them. All which is in the aptest manner
performed by a watery diluent, containing a fine
vegetable soap. And although a compleat cure
by alteratives, operating on the small capillaries,
and by insensible discharges, must require length
of time, yet the good effect of this medicine on
cachectic and scorbutic persons, is soon perceived,
by the change it produceth in their pale discolour∣ed
looks, giving a florid healthy countenance in
less time then perhaps any other medicine.</P>
<P>25. It is supposed by physicians, that the imme∣diate
cause of the scurvy lies in the blood, the
fibrous part of which is too thick and the serum
too thin and sharp: and that hence ariseth the
great difficulty in the cure, because in the corre∣cting
of one part, regard must be had to the other.
It is well known how extremely difficult it is to
cure on inveterate scurvy: how many scorbutic
patients have grown worse by an injudicious course
of evacuations: how many are even rendered in∣curable
by the treatment of inconsiderate physi∣cians:
and how difficult, tedious and uncertain the
cure is in the hands even of the best, who are
obliged to use such variety and change of medi∣cines,
in the different stages of that malady: which
nevertheless may be cured (if I may judge by what
I have experienced) by the sole, regular, constant,
copious use of Tar-water.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45"/>
96. Tar-water moderately inspissates with it's
balsamic virtue, and renders mild the thin and
sharp part of the blood. The same, as a soapy
medicine, dissolves the grumous concretions of the
fibrous part. As a balsam it destroys the ulcerous
acrimony of the humours, and as a deobstruent it
opens and cleans the vessels, restores their tone,
and strenghtens the digestion, whose defects are the
principle cause of scurvy and cachexy.</P>
<P>97. In the cure of the scurvy, the principal aim
is to subdue the acrimony of the blood and juices.
But as this acrimony proceeds from different causes,
or even opposite, as acid and alkaline, what is
good in one sort of scurvy proves dangerous, or
even mortal, in another. It is well known, that
hot antiscorbutics, where the juices of the body
are alcalescent, increase the disease. And sour
fruits and vegetables produce the like effect in the
scurvy, caused by an acid acrimony. Hence fatal
blunders are committed by unwary practitioners,
who, not distinguishing the nature of the disease,
do frequently aggravate, instead of curing it. If
I may trust what tryals I have been able to make,
this water is good in the several kinds of scurvy,
acid, alcaline, and muriatic, and I believe it the
only medicine that cures them all without doing
hurt in any. As it contains a volatile acid<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">7.</NOTE> with
a fine volatile oyl, why may not a medicine cool
in one part and warm in another be a remedy to
either extreme<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">72.</NOTE>? I have observed it to produce
a kindly genial warmth without heat, a thing to
be aimed at in all sorts of scurvy. Besides the
balsam in Tar-water sheaths all scorbutic salts
alike: and its great virtues as a digester and deob∣struent
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
are of general use in all scorbutic, and I
may add in all chronical cases whatsoever.</P>
<P>98. I cannot be sure that I have tried it in a scro∣phulous
case, though I have tried it succesfully
in one that I suspected to be so. And I appre∣hend
it would be very serviceable in such disorders.
For although Doctor Gibbs in his treatise of the
King's Evil derives that disease from a coagulat∣ing
acid, which is also agreeable to the opinion
of some other physicians, and although Tar-water
contain an acid, yet as it is a soap,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">58.</NOTE> it resolves
instead of coagulating the juices of the body.</P>
<P>99. For hysterical and hypocondriacal disorders
so frequent among us, it is commonly supposed
that all acids are bad. But I will venture to ex∣cept
the acid soap of Tar-water, having found
by my own experience and that of many others,
that it raiseth the spirits, and is an excellent anti∣hysteric,
nor less innocent than potent, which
cannot be said of those others in common use,
that often leave people worse than they found
them.</P>
<P>100. In a high degree of scurvy a mercurial sa∣livation
is looked on by many as the only cure.
Which by the vehement choque it gives the
whole frame, and the sensible secretion it produceth
may be thought to be more adequate to such an
effect. But the disorder occasioned by that vio∣lent
process, it is to be feared, may never be got
over. The immediate danger, the frequent bad
effects, the extreme trouble and nice care attend∣ing
such a course do very deservedly make people
afraid of it. And though the sensible secretion
therein to be so great, yet in a longer tract of
time the use of Tar-water may produce as great
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
a discharge of scorbutic salts by urine and by per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣piration,
the effect of which last, though not so
sensible, may yet be greater than that of saliva∣tion;
especially if it be true, that in common life
insensible perspiration is to nutrition, and all sen∣sible
excretions, as five to three.</P>
<P>101. Many hysteric and scorbutic ailments,
many taints contracted by themselves, or inherited
from their ancestors, afflict the people of condition
in these islands, often rendering them, upon the
whole, much more unhappy than those whom po∣verty
and labour have ranked in the lowest lot of
life; which ailments may be safely removed or re∣lieved
by the sole use of Tar-water; And those lives
which seem hardly worth living for bad appetite,
low spirits, restless nights, wasting pains and an∣xieties,
be rendered easy and comfortable.</P>
<P>102. As the nerves are instruments of sensation,
if follows that spasms in the nerves may produce
all symptoms, and therefore a disorder in the ner∣vous
systems shall imitate all distempers, and occa∣sion,
in appearance, an asthma for instance, a pleu∣risy,
or a fit of the stone. Now whatever is good
for the nerves in general, is good against all such
symptoms. But Tar-water, as it includes in an
eminent degree the virtues of warm gums and re∣sins,
is of great use for comforting and strengthen∣ing
the nerves,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">86.</NOTE> curing twitches in the nervous
fibres, cramps also, and numbness in the limbs, re∣moving
anxieties and promoting sleep, in all which
cases I have known it very successful.</P>
<P>103. This safe and cheap medicine suits all cir∣cumstances
and all constitutions, operating easily,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring without disturbing, raising the spirits wit∣hout
depressing them, a circumstance that deserves
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
repeated attention, especially in these climates,
where strong liquors so fatally and so frequently pro∣duce
those very distresses they are designed to re∣medy;
and, if I am not misinformed, even among
the Ladies themselves, who are truly much to be
pitied. Their condition of life makes them a prey
to imaginary woes, which never fail to grow up
in minds unexercised and unemployed. To get
rid of these, it is said, there are who betake them∣selves
to distilled spirits. And it is not improbable,
they are led gradually to the use of those poisons
by a certain complaisant pharmacy, too much used
in the modern practice, palsy drops, poppy cordial,
plague water, and such like, which being in truth
nothing but drams disguised, yet coming from the
apothecaries, are considered only as medicines.</P>
<P>104. The soul of man was supposed by many
ancient sages, to be thrust into the human body as
into a prison, for punishment of past offences. But
the worst prison is the body of an indolent Epi∣cure,
whose blood is inflamed by fermented liquors
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">66.</NOTE> and high sauces, or render'd putrid,
sharp, and corrosive, by a stagnation of the animal
juices through sloth and indolence; whose mem∣branes
are irritated by pungent salts, whose mind
is agitated by painful oscillations of the
nervous<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">86.</NOTE> system, and whose nerves are mutually
affected by the irregular passions of his mind. This
ferment in the animal o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conomy darkens and con∣founds
the intellect. It produceth vain terrours
and vain conceits, and stimulates the soul with mad
desires, which, not being natural, nothing in na∣ture
can satisfy. No wonder, therefore, there are
so many fine persons of both sexes, shining them∣selves,
and shone on by fortune, who are inwardly
miserable and sick of life.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="49"/>
105. The hardness of stubbed vulgar constitu∣tions,
renders them insensible of a thousand things,
that fret and gall those delicate people, who, as
if their skin was peeled off, feel to the quick every
thing that touches them. The remedy for this ex∣quisite
and painful sensibility is commonly sought
from fermented, perhaps from distilled, liquors,
which render many lives wretched, that would
otherwise have been only ridiculous. The tender ner∣ves,
and low spirits of such poor creatures, would
be much relieved by the use of Tar-water, which
might prolong and cheer their lives. I do there∣fore
recommend to them the use of a cordial, not
only safe and innocent, but giving health and spirit
as surely as other cordials destroy them.</P>
<P>106. I do verily think, there is not any other
medicine whatsoever, so effectual to restore a crazy
constitution, and cheer a dreary mind, or so likely
to subvert that gloomy empire of the spleen<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">103.</NOTE>
which tyraniseth over the better sort (as they are
called) of these free nations; and maketh them,
in spight of their liberty and property, more wretch∣ed
slaves than even the subjects of absolute power,
who breath clear air in a sunny climate. While
men of low degree often enjoy a tranquillity and con∣tent,
that no advantage of birth or fortune can
equal. Such, indeed, was the case, while the rich
alone could afford to be debauched; but when even
beggars became debauchees, the case was altered.</P>
<P>107. The public virtue and spirit of the British
legislature, never shewed itself more conspicuous
in any act, than in that for suppressing the
immoderate use of spirituous liquours among the
people, whose strength and numbers constitute
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
the true wealth of a nation: though evasive arts
will, it is feared, prevail so long as distilled spirits
of any kind are allowed, the character of English∣men
in general, being that of Brutus, Quicquid
vult valde vult. But why should such a canker be
tolerated in the vitals of a state, under any pre∣tence
or in any shape whatsoever? Better by far,
the whole present set of distillers were pensioners
of the public, and their trade abolished by law;
since all the benefit thereof put together would not
balance the hundredth part of its mischief.</P>
<P>108. To prove the destructive effects of such
spirits with regard both to the humane species and
individuals, we need not go so far as our colonies,
or the savage natives of America. Plain proof
may be had nearer home. For, albeit there is in
every town or district throughout England, some
tough dram-drinker, set up as the Devil's decoy,
to draw in proselytes; yet the ruined health and
morals, and the beggary of such numbers evident∣ly
shew that we need no other enemy to compleat
our destruction, than this cheap luxury at the lower
end of the state, and that a nation lighted up at
both ends must soon be consumed.</P>
<P>109. It is much to be lamented that our Insu∣lars,
who act and think so much for themselves,
should yet from grossness of air and diet, grow
stupid or doat sooner than other people, who by
virtue of elastic air, water-drinking, and light
food, preserve their faculties to extreme old age;
an advantage which may perhaps be approached,
if not equalled, even in these regions, by tar-water,
temperance, and early hours; the last is a
sure addition to life, not only in regard of time,
which, being taken from sleep, the image of
death, is added to the waking hours, but also in
regard of longevity and duration in the vulgar
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
sense. I may say too, in regard of spirit and viva∣city,
which, within the same compass of duration,
may, truly and properly be affirmed to add to
man's life: it being manifest, that one man,
by a brisker motion of his spirits and succession of
his ideas, shall live more in one hour, than ano∣ther
in two: and that the quantity of life is to be
estimated, not merely from the duration, but also
from the intenseness of living. Which intense
living, or, it I may so say, lively life, is not
more promoted by early hours as a regimen, than
by tar-water as a cordial; which acts, not only as
a slow medicine, but hath also an immediate and
cheerful<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">66.</NOTE> effects on the spirits.</P>
<P>110. It must be owned, the light attracted se∣creted
and detained in tar,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">8, 29, 40.</NOTE> and afterwards
drawn off in its finest balsamic particle, by the gentle
menstruum of cold water, is not a violent and sud∣den
medicine, always to produce its effect an once,
(such by irritating, often do more mischief than
good) but a safe and mild alterative, which pene∣trates
the whole system, opens, heals, and strength∣ens
the remote vessels, alters and propels their con∣tents,
and enters the minutest capillaries, and can∣not
therefore, otherwise, than by degree and in
time work a radical cure of chronic distempers.
It gives nevertheless speedy relief in most cases, as
I have found by my self and many others. I
have been surprised to see person fallen away and
languishing under a bad digestion, after a few
weeks recover a good stomach, and with it flesh and
strength, so as to seem renewed, by the drinking
of tar-water. The strength and quantity of this
water to be taken by each individual person is best
determined from experience. And as for the time
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
of taking, I never knew any evil ensue from its
being continued ever so long; but, on the con∣trary,
many and great advantages, which some∣times
would not perhaps begin to shew themselves
till it had been taken two or three months.</P>
<P>111. We learn from Pliny, that in the first fer∣ment
of new wine or mustum, the ancients were
wont to sprinkle it with powdered rosin, which
gave it a certain sprightliness, quaedam saporis acu∣mina.
This was esteemed a great improver of its
odour and taste, and was, I doubt not, of its fa∣lubrity
also. The brown old rosin, that it to say,
harden'd tar, as being more easily pulverized and
sifted, was most in request for this purpose. They
used likewise of season their wine-vessels with pitch
or rosin. And I make no doubt, that if our vint∣ners
would contrive to medicate their wines with
the same ingredients, they might improve and
preserve them, with less trouble and expence to
themselves, and less danger to others. He that
would know more particulars of this matter may
consult Pliny and Columella. I shall only add,
that I doubt not a similar improvement may be
made of malt liquor.</P>
<P>112. The <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of Theophrastus and resina of
Pliny are sometimes used in a general sense, to
signify all sorts of oily viscid exsudations from
plants or trees. The crude watery juice, that ri∣seth
early in the spring, is gradually ripened and
inspissated by the solar heat, becoming in orderly
succession with the seasons an oil, a balsam, and at
last a resin. And it is observed by chemists, that
turpentine dissolved over a gentle fire, is, by the
constant operation of heat, successively transform∣ed
into oil, balsam, pitch, and hard friable resin,
which will incorporate with oil or rectified spirit,
but not with water.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="53"/>
113. Sir John Floyer remarks, that we want a
method for the use of turpentine, and again, he
who shall hit, saith he, on the pleasantest method
of giving turpentine, will do great cures in the gout,
stone, catarrhs, dropsies and cold scurvies, rheu∣matisms,
ulcers, and obstructions of the glands.
Lastly, he subjoins, that for the use of altering and
amending the juices and fibres, it must be given
frequently, and in such small quantities at a time,
and in so commodious a manner, as will agree best
with the stomach<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">9.</NOTE> stay longest in the body, and
not purge itself off; for large doses (saith he) go
through too quick, and besides offend the head.
Now the infusion of tar or turpentine in cold wa∣ter
seems to supply the very method that was
wanted, as it leaves the more unctuous, and gross
parts behind<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">47.</NOTE> which might offend the stomach,
intestines and head; and as it may be easily taken,
and as often, and in such quantity and such degree
of strength, as suits the case of the patient. Nor
should it seem, that the fine spirit and volatile oil,
obtained by infusion of tar<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">7, 42, 58.</NOTE> is inferior to that
of turpentine, to which it supperadds the virtue
of wood soot, which is known to be very great
with respect to the head and nerves; and this ap∣pears
evident from the manner of obtaining tar
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">13.</NOTE>. And as the fine volatile parts of tar or tur∣pentine
are obtained by infusion in cold water and
easily conveyed throughout the whole system of
the human body; so it should seem the same me∣thod
may be used with all sorts of balsams or resins
whatsoever, as the readiest, easiest, and most in∣offensive,
as well as in many cases the most effectual
way of obtaining and imparting their virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="54"/>
114. After having said so much of the uses of
tar, I must farther add, that being rubb'd on them
it is an excellent preservative of the teeth and gums:
and that it clears and strengthens the voice. And,
as its effects are various and useful, so there is no∣thing
to be feared from the operation of an altera∣tive
so mild and friendly to nature. It was a wise
maxim of certain ancient philosophers, that dis∣eases
ought not to be irritated by medicines. But
no medicine disturbs the animal oeconomy less than
this, which, if I may trust my own experience,
never produces any disorder in a patient when
rightly taken.</P>
<P>115. I knew indeed a person who took a large
glass of tar-water just before breakfast, which gave
him an invincible nausea and disgust, although he
had before received the greatest benefit from it.
But if the tar-water be taken and made in the man∣ner
prescribed at the beginning of this essay, it will,
if I mistake not, have enough of the salt to be use∣ful,
and little enough of the oil to be inoffensive.
Persons more delicate than ordinary may render it
palatable, by mixing a drop of the chemical oil of
nutmegs, or a spoonful of mountain wine in each
glass. It may not be amiss to observe, that I have
known some, whose nice stomachs could not bear
it in the morning, take it at night going to bed
without any inconvenience; and that with some it
agrees best warm, with others cold.</P>
<P>116. In very dangerous and acute cases much
may be taken and often; as far as the stomach can
bear. But in chronical cases, about half a pint,
night and morning, may suffice. A medicine of so
great virtue in so many different disorders, and
especially in that grand enemy, the fever, must
needs be a benefit to mankind in general▪<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">103.</NOTE> There are
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
nevertheless three sorts of people to whom I would
peculiarly recommend it: Sea-faring persons, la∣dies,
and men of studious and sedentary lives.</P>
<P>117. To sailors and all sea-faring persons, who
are subject to scorbutic disorders and putrid fevers,
especially in long southern voyages, I am persua∣ded
this tar-water would be very beneficial. And
this may deserve particular notice in the present
course of marine expeditions, when so many of our
country-men have perished by such distempers,
contracted at sea and in foreign climates. Which,
it is probable, might have been prevented, by the
copious use of tar-water.</P>
<P>118. This same water will also give charitable
relief to the ladies,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">103.</NOTE> who often want it more
than the parish poor; being many of them never
able to make a good meal, and sitting pale, puny,
and forbidden like ghosts, at their own table, vic∣tims
of vapours and indigestion.</P>
<P>119. Studious persons also pent up in narrow
holes, breathing bad air, and stooping over their
books, are much to be pitied. As they are debar∣red
the free use of air and exercise, this I will ven∣ture
to recommend as the best succedaneum to both.
Though it were to be wished, that modern scholars
would, like the ancients, meditate and converse
more in walks and gardens and open air, which,
upon the whole, would perhaps be no hindrance to
their learning, and a great advantage to their
health. My own sedentary course of life had long
since thrown me into an ill habit, attended with ma∣ny
ailments particularly a nervous cholic, which
rendered my life a burthen, and the more so, be∣cause
my pains were exasperated by exercise. But
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
since the use of tar water, I find, though not a per∣fect
recovery from my old and rooted illness, yet
such a gradual return of health and ease, that I
esteem my having taken this medicine the greatest
of all temporal blessings, and am convinced that,
under providence, I owe my life to it.</P>
<P>120. In the distilling of turpentine and other
balsams by a gentle heat, it hath been observed,
that there riseth first an acid spirit<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">7.</NOTE> that will
mix with water; which spirit, except the fire be
very gentle, is lost. This grateful acid spirit
that first comes over, is, as a learned chymist
and physician informs us, highly refrigeratory,
diuretic, sudorific, balsamic or preservative from
putrefaction, excellent in nephritic cases, and for
quenching thirst, all which virtues are contained
in the cold infusion, which draws forth from▪ tar
only it's fine flower or quintessence, if I may so
say, or the native vegetable spirit, together with a
little volatile oil.</P>
<P>121. The distinguishing principle of all vege∣tables,
that whereon their peculiar smell, taste,
and specific properties depend, seems to be some
extremely fine and subtile spirit, whose immedi∣ate
vehicle is an exceeding thin volatile oil, which
is it self detained in a grosser and more viscid re∣sin
or balsam, lodged in proper cells in the bark
and seeds, and most abounding in autumn or win∣ter,
after the crude juices have been thoroughly
concocted, ripened, and impregnated with solar
light. The spirit it self is by some supposed to
be an oil highly subtilized, so as to mix with
water. But such volatile oil is not the spirit,
but only it's vehicle. Since a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omatic oils, be∣ing
long exposed to air, will lose their specific
smell and taste, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly off with the spirit or
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
vegetable salt, without any sensible diminution of
the oil.</P>
<P>122. Those volatile salts, that are set free and
raised by a gentle heat, may justly be supposed
essential<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">8.</NOTE>, and to have pre-existed in the ve∣getable;
whereas the lixivial fixed salts obtained
by the incineration of the subject, whose natural
constituent parts have been altered or destroyed by
the extreme force of fire, are by later chymists,
upon very good grounds, supposed not to have
pre-existed therein; all such salts appearing, from
the experiments of signor Redi, not to preserve
the virtues of the respective vegetable subjects;
and to be alike purgative and in an equal de∣gree,
whatsoever may be the shape of their points,
whether sharp or obtuse. But although fixed or
lixivious salts may not contain the original pro∣perties
of the subject; yet volatile salts raised by a
slight heat from vegetables are allowed to preserve
their native virtues: and such salts are readily im∣bibed
by water.</P>
<P>123. The most volatile of the salts, and the
most attenuated part of the oil, may be supposed
the first and readiest to impregnate a cold in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1, 7.</NOTE>. And this will assist us to account for
the virtues of tar water. That volatile acid in
vegetables, which resists putrefaction, and is their
great preservative, is detained in a subtile oil mis∣cible
with water, which oil is it self imprisoned in
the resin or grosser part of the tar, from which it
is easily set free and obtained pure by cold wa∣ter.</P>
<P>124. The mild native acids are observed more
kindly to work upon, and more thoroughly to
dissolve, metallic bodies, than the strongest acid
spirits produced by a vehement fire; and it may
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
be suspected, they have the same advantage as a
medicine. And as no acid, by the observation
of some of the best chymists, can be obtained
from the substance of animals thoroughly assimi∣lated,
it should follow, that the acids received
into a healthy body must be quite subdued and
changed by the vital powers: but it is easier to sub∣due
and assimilate<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">48.</NOTE> the gentler than the stronger
acids.</P>
<P>125. I am very sensible, that on such subjects
arguments fall short of evidence: and that mine
fall short even of what they might have been if I
enjoyed better health, or those opportunities of a
learned commerce, from which I am cut off in
this remote corner. I shall nevertheless go on as
I have begun, and proceed by reason, by con∣jecture,
and by authority, to cast the best light
I can on the obscure paths that lie in my way.</P>
<P>126. Sir Isaac Newton, Boerhaave, and Hom∣berg
are all agreed, that the acid is a fine subtile
substance, pervading the whole terraqueous globe;
which produceth divers kinds of bodies, as it is
united to different subjects. This according to
Homberg is the pure salt, salt the principle, in it
self similar and uniform, but never found alone.
And although this principle be called the salt of
the earth, yet it should seem it may more pro∣perly
be called the salt of the air, since earth
turned up and lying fallow receives it from the
air. And it should seem that this is the great
principle of vegetation, derived into the earth
from all sorts of manures, as well as from the
air. The acid is allowed to be the cause of fer∣mentation
in all fermented liquors. Why there∣fore,
may it not be supposed to ferment the earth,
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
and to constitute that fine penetrating principle,
which introduces and assimilates the food of plants,
and is so fugitive as to escape all the filtrations
and perquisitions of the most nice observers?</P>
<P>127. It is the doctrine of Sir Isaac Newton
and monsieur Homberg, that, as the watery acid
is that which renders salt soluble in water, so it is
that same which joined to the earthy part makes it
a salt. Let it therefore be considered, that the
organs<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">30, 31, 35.</NOTE> of plants are tubes, the filling, un∣folding,
and distending whereof by liquors, doth
constitute what is called the vegetation or growth
of the plant. But earth it self is not soluble in
water, so as to form one vegetable fluid there∣with.
Therefore the particles of earth must be
joined with a watery acid, that is, they must be∣come
salts in order to dissolve in water; that so,
in the form of a vegetable juice, they may pass
through the strainers and tubes of the root into
the body of the plant, swelling and distending
it's parts and organs, that is, increasing it's bulk.
Therefore the vegetable matter of the earth is in
effect earth changed into salt. And to render earth
fertile, is to cause many of it's particles to assume a
saline form.</P>
<P>128. Hence it is observed, there are more
salts in the root than in the bark, more salts in
vegetables during the spring, than in the autumn
or winter, the crude saline juices being in the
summer months partly evaporated, and partly ri∣pened
by the action and mixture of light. Hence
also it appears, why the dividing of earth, so as
to enlarge it's surface, whereby it may admit
more acid from the air, is of such use in pro∣moting
vegetation. And why ashes, lime, and
<PB N="61" REF="60"/>
burnt clay are found so profitable manures, fire
being in reality the acid, as is proved in the se∣quel
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">202.</NOTE>. Marls also and shells are useful, foras∣much
as those alcaline bodies attract the acid, and
raise an effervescence with it, thereby promoting
a fermentation in the glebe. The excrements of
animals and putrid vegetables do in like manner
contribute to vegetation, by increasing the salts of
the earth. And where fallows are well broken,
and lye long to receive the acid of the air into all
their parts; this alone will be sufficient to change
many terrene particles into salts, and consequently
render them soluble in water, and therefore fit ali∣ment
for vegetables.</P>
<P>129. The acid, saith Homberg, is always join∣ed
to some sulphur, which determines it to this or
that species, producing different salts, as it is the
vegetable, bituminous, or metallique sulphur. E∣ven
the alcaline, whether volatile or lixivial salts,
are supposed to be nothing but this same acid
strictly detained by oil and earth, in spight of
the extreme force of fire, which lodgeth in them,
without being able to dislodge some remains of the
acid.</P>
<P>130. Salts, according to sir Isaac Newton, are
dry earth and watery acid united by attraction,
the acid rendering them soluble in water<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">127.</NOTE>. He
supposeth the watery acid to flow round the ter∣restrial
part, as the ocean doth round the earth,
being attracted thereby, and compares each par∣ticle
of salt, to a chaos whereof the innermost
part is hard and earthy, but the surface soft and
watery. Whatever attracts and is attracted most
strongly is an acid in his sense.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="61"/>
131. It seems impossible to determine the figures
of particular salts. All acid solvents together with
the dissolved bodies are apt to shoot into certain
figures. And the figures, in which the fossil salts
crystallize, have been supposed the proper natural
shapes of them and their acids. But Homberg
hath clearly shewed the contrary: forasmuch as the
same acid dissolving different bodies, assumes dif∣ferent
shapes. Spirit of nitre, for instance, hav∣ing
dissolved copper, shoots into hexagonal crystals;
the same having dissolved iron, shoots into irregu∣lar
squares; and again, having dissolved silver,
forms thin crystals of a triangular figure.</P>
<P>132. Homberg nevertheless holds in general,
that acids are shaped like daggers, and alcalies like
sheaths: and that moving in the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iquor, the
daggers run into the sheaths fitted to receive them,
with such violence as to raise that effervescence ob∣served
in the mixture of acids and alcalies. But it
seems very difficult to conceive, how, or why the
mere configuration of daggers and sheaths, floating
in the same liquor, should cause the former to rush
with such vehemence, and direct their points so
aptly into the latter, any more than a parcel of spi∣gots
and fossets floating together in the same water,
should rush one into the other.</P>
<P>133. It should seem rather, that the vehement
attraction which Sir Isaac Newton attributes to all
acids, whereby he supposeth them to rush towards,
penetrate, shake, and divide the most solid bodies,
and to ferment the liquid of vegetables, could bet∣ter
account for this phaenomenon. It is in this at∣traction,
that Sir Isaac placeth all their activity,
and indeed it should seem, the figures of salts were
not of such e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icacy in producing their effects, as
the strong attractive powers whereby they are
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
agitated and do agitate other bodies. Especially if
it be true (what was before remarked) that lixivious
salts are alike purgative, whatever may be the
shape of their angles, whether more or less acute or
obtuse.</P>
<P>134. Sir Isaac Newton accounts for the watery
acid's making earthy corpuscles soluble in water, by
supposing the acid to be a mean between earth
and water, it's particles greater than those of wa∣ter,
and less than those of earth, and strongly to
attract both. But perhaps there is no necessary
reason, for supposing the parts of the acid grosser
than the parts of water, in order to produce this
effect; may not this as well be accounted for, by
giving them only a strong attraction or cohesion
with the bodies to which they are joined?</P>
<P>135. The acid spirit or salt, that mighty instru∣ment
in the hand of nature, residing in the air, and
diffused throughout that whole element, is discer∣nible
also in many parts of the earth, particularly in
fossils, such as sulphur, vitriol, and alum; it was
already observed from Homberg, that this acid is
never found pure, but hath always sulphur joined
with it, and is classed by the difference of it's sul∣phurs,
whether mineral, vegetable, or animal.</P>
<P>136. Salts are vulgarly reckoned the most active
of chymical principles. But Homberg derives all
their activity from the sulphurs joined with them.
From which also, as hath been said, he derives all
their kinds and differences,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">129.</NOTE> Salt, water, oil,
and earth seem to be originally the same in all ve∣getables.
All the difference, according to the
chymists, ariseth from a spirit residing in the oil,
called the Rector or Archaeus. This is otherwise
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
called by chymists, ens primum, or the native spi∣rit,
whereon depend, and wherein are contained,
the peculiar flavour and odour, the specific qualities
and virtues of the plant.</P>
<P>137. These native spirits or vegetable souls are
all breathed or exhaled into the air, which seems
the receptacle as well as source of all sublunary
forms, the great mass or chaos which imparts and
receives them. The air, or atmosphere, that sur∣rounds
our earth, contains a mixture of all the ac∣tive
volatile parts of the whole habitable world,
that is of all vegetables, minerals and animals.
Whatever perspires, corrupts, or exhales impreg∣nates
the air; which, being acted upon by the so∣lar
fire, produceth within itself all sorts of chy∣mical
operations, dispensing again those salts and
spirits in new generations, which it had received
from putrefactions.</P>
<P>138. The perpetual oscillations of this elastic and
restless element operate without ceasing, on all
things that have life, whether animal or vegetable,
keeping their fibres, vessels, and fluids in a mo∣tion
always changing; as heat, cold, moisture, dry∣ness,
and other causes alter the elasticity of the air.
Which accounts, it must be owned, for many ef∣fects.
But there are many more which must be de∣rived
from other principles or qualities in the air.
Thus iron and copper are corroded and gather rust
in the air, and bodies of all sorts are dissolved or
corrupted, which sheweth an acid to abound and
diffuse itself throughout the air.</P>
<P>139. By this same air fire is kindled, the lamp
of life preserved, respiration, digestion, nutrition,
the pulse of the heart and motion of all the mus∣cles
seem to be performed. Air therefore is a ge∣neral
agent, not only exerting it's own, but calling
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>
forth the qualities or powers of all other bodies, by
a division, comminution, and agitation of their
particles, causing them to fly off and become vo∣latile
and active.</P>
<P>140. Nothing ferments, vegetates, or putrefies
without air, which operates with all the virtues of
the bodies included in it; that is, of all nature;
there being no drug, salutary or poisonous, whose
virtues are not breathed into the air. The air there∣fore
is an active mass of numberless different prin∣ciples,
the general source of corruption and gene∣ration;
on one hand dividing, abrading, and car∣rying
off the particles of bodies, that is, corrupt∣ing
or dissolving them; on the other, producing
new ones into being; destroying and bestowing
forms without intermission.</P>
<P>141. The seeds of things seem to lye latent in
the air, ready to appear and produce their kind,
whenever they light on a proper matrix. The ex∣tremely
small seeds of fern, mosses, mushrooms,
and some other plants are concealed and wafted a∣bout
in the air, every part whereof seems replete
with seeds of one kind or other. The whole at∣mosphere
seems alive. There is every where acid
to corrode, and seed to engender. Iron will rust,
and mold will grow in all places. Virgin earth be∣comes
fertile, crops of new plants ever and anon
shew themselves, all which demonstrates the air to
be a common seminary and receptacle of all vivi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying
principles.</P>
<P>142. Air may also be said to be the seminary of
minerals and metals, as it is of vegetables. Mr.
Boyle informs us, that the exhausted ores of tin
and iron being exposed to the air become again im∣pregnated
with metal, and that ore of alum having
lost it's salt recovers it after the same manner.
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
The like is related of silver and iron ores. And
numberless instances there are of salts produced by
the air, that vast collection or treasury of active
principles, from which all sublunary bodies seem to
derive their forms, and on which animals depend
for their life and breath.</P>
<P>143. That there is some latent vivifying spirit
dispersed throughout the air common experience
sheweth; ina<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>much as it is necessary both to vege∣tables
and animals<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">138, 139.</NOTE> whether terrestrial or aquatic,
neither beasts, insects, birds nor fishes being able
to subsist without air. Nor doth all air suffice,
there being some quality or ingredient, of which
when air is deprived, it becometh unfit to main∣tain
either life or flame. And this even though the
air should retain it's elasticity; which, by the bye,
is an argument that air doth not act only as an an∣tagonist
to the intercostal muscles. It hath both
that and many other uses. It gives and preserves a
proper tone to the vessels: this elastic fluid pro∣motes
all secretions: it's oscillations keep every part
in motion: it pervades and actuates the whole ani∣mal
system, producing great variety of effects, and
even opposite in different parts, cooling at the same
time and heating, distending and contracting, co∣agulating
and resolving, giving and taking, sus∣taining
life and impairing it, pressing without and
expanding within, abrading some parts, at the
same time insinuating and supplying others, pro∣ducing
various vibrations in the fibres, and fer∣ments
in the fluids; all which must needs ensue
from such a subtile, active, heterogeneous and elastic
fluid.</P>
<P>144. But there is, as was before observed, some
one quality or ingredient in the air, on which life
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
more immediately and principally depends. What
that is, though Men are not agreed, yet it is agreed
it must be the same thing that supports the vital
and the common flame; it being found that when
air, by often breathing in it, is become unfit for
the one, it will no longer serve for the other. The
like is observable in poisonous damps or steams,
wherein flame cannot be kindled. As is evident in
the Grotto del cane near Naples. And here it oc∣curs,
to recommend the plunging them into cold
water, as an experiment to be tried on persons af∣fected
by breathing a poisonous vapour in old
vaults, mines, deep holes or cavities under ground.
Which, I am apt to think, might save the lives of
several, by what I have seen practised on a dog
convulsed and in all appearance dead, but instantly
reviving on being taken out of the abovementioned
grotto and thrown into a lake adjacent.</P>
<P>145. Air, the general menstruum and seminary,
seemeth to be only an aggregate of the volatile parts
of all natural beings, which variously combined
and agitated produce many various effects. Small
particles in a near and close situation strongly act
upon each other, attracting, repelling, vibrating.
Hence divers fermentations, and all the variety of
meteors, tempests, and concussions both of earth
and firmament. Nor is the microcosm less affected
thereby. Being pent up in the viscera, vessels, and
membranes of the body, by it's salts, sulphurs,
and elastic power, it engenders cholics, spasms,
hysteric disorders and other maladies.</P>
<P>146. The specific quality of air is taken to be
permanent elasticity. Mr. Boyle is expresly of this
opinion. And yet, whether there be any such
thing as permanently elastic air may be doubted,
there being many things which seem to rob the air
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
of this quality, or at least lessen and suspend it's
exertion. The salts and sulphurs, for instance, that
float in the air abate much of it's elasticity by their
attraction.</P>
<P>147. Upon the whole it is manifest, that air is
no distinct element, but a mass or mixture of things
the most heterogeneous and even opposite to each
other<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">137, 145.</NOTE> which become air, by acquiring an
elasticity and volatility from the attraction of some
active, subtile substance; whether it be called fire,
aether, light, or the vital spirit of the world; in
like manner as the particles of antimony, of them∣selves
not volatile, are carried off in sublimation
and rendered volatile, by cohering with the par∣ticles
of sal ammoniac. But action and reaction
being equal, the spring of this aethereal spirit is
diminished by being imparted. It's velocity and
subtilty are also less from it's being mixed with
grosser particles. Hence sound moves slower than
light, as mud than clear water.</P>
<P>148. Whether air be only freed and fixed, or
generated and destroyed, it is certain that air begins
and ceases to exert or shew itself. Much by expe∣riments
seems to be generated, not only from ani∣mals,
fruits, and vegetables, but also from hard
bodies. And it is observed by Sir Isaac Newton,
that air produced from hard bodies is most elastic.
The transmutation of elements, each into other,
hath been anciently held. In Plutarch we find it
was the opinion of Heraclitus, that the death of
fire was a birth to air, and the death of air a birth
to water. This opinion is also maintained by
Sir Isaac Newton. Though it may be questioned,
whether what is thought a change be not only a
disguise.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="68"/>
149. Fire seems the most elastic and expansive of
all bodies. It communicates this quality to moist
vapours and dry exhalations, when it heats and a∣gitates
their parts, cohering closely with them,
overcoming their former mutual attraction, and
causing them, instead thereof, reciprocally to re∣pel
each other and fly asunder, with a force pro∣portionable
to that wherewith they had cohered.</P>
<P>150. Therefore in air we may conceive two
parts, the one more gross which was raised and
carried off from the bodies of this terraqueous
mass: the other a fine subtile spirit by means where∣of
the former is rendered volatile and elastic.
Together they compose a medium, whose elasticity
is less than that of pure aether, fire, or spirit, in
proportion to the quantity of salts, vapours, and
heterogeneous particles contained therein. Hence
it follows, that there is no such thing as a pure sim∣ple
element of air. It follows also that on the high∣est
mountains, air should be more rare than in pro∣portion
to the vulgar rule, of the spaces being re∣ciprocally
as the pressures: and so in fact it is said
to have been found, by the Gentlemen of the
French Academy of Sciences.</P>
<P>151. Aether, fire, or spirit being attracted and
clogged by heterogeneous particles becometh less
active; and the particles cohering with those of
aether, become more active than before. Air there∣fore
is a mass of various particles, abraded and sub∣limated
from wet and dry bodies of all sorts, co∣hering
with particles of aether; the whole per∣meated
by pure aether, or light, or fire: for these
words are used promiscuously by ancient philoso∣phers.</P>
<P>152. This aether or pure invisible fire, the
most subtile and elastic of all bodies, seems to
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
pervade and expand it self throughout the whole
universe. If air be the immediate agent or instru∣ment
in natural things, it is the pure invisible fire
that is the first natural mover or spring, from
whence the air derives it's power<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">139, 149, 151.</NOTE>. This migh∣ty
agent is every where at hand, ready to break
forth into action, if not restrained and governed
with the greatest wisdom. Being always restless
and in motion, it actuates and enlivens the whole
visible mass, is equally fitted to produce and to
destroy, distinguishes the various stages of nature,
and keeps up the perpetual round of generations
and corruptions, pregnant with forms which it
constantly sends forth and resorbs. So quick in
it's motions, so subtile and penetrating in it's na∣ture,
so extensive in it's effects, it seemeth no o∣ther
than the vegetative soul or vital spirit of the
world.</P>
<P>153. The animal spirit in man is the instru∣mental
or physical cause both of sense and mo∣tion.
To suppose sense in the world, would be
gross and unwarranted. But loco-motive faculties
are evident in all it's parts. The Pythagoreans,
Platonists, and Stoics held the world to be an ani∣mal.
Though some of them have chosen to con∣sider
it as a vegetable. However the phaenomena
and effects do plainly shew there is a spirit that
moves, and a mind or providence that presides.
This providence, Plutarch saith, was thought to
be in regard to the world, what the soul is in re∣gard
to man.</P>
<P>154. The order and course of things, and the
experiments we daily make, shew there is a mind
that governs and actuates this mundane system,
as the proper real agent and cause. And that the
<PB N="71" REF="70"/>
inferior instrumental cause is pure aether, fire, or
the substance of light<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">29, 37, 136, 149.</NOTE> which is applied and de∣termined
by an infinite mind in the macrocosm or
universe, with unlimited power, and according
to stated rules; as it is in the microcosm, with
limited power and skill by the humane mind.
We have no proof, either from experiment or
reason, of any other agent or efficient cause than
mind or spirit. When therefore we speak of cor∣poreal
agents or corporeal causes, this is to be un∣derstood
in a different, subordinate, and improper
sense.</P>
<P>155. The principles whereof a thing is com∣pounded,
the instrument used in it's production,
and the end for which it was intended, are all in
vulgar use termed causes, though none of them be
strictly speaking agent or efficient. There is not
any proof that an extended corporeal or mecha∣nical
cause doth really and properly act, even mo∣tion
it self being in truth a passion. Therefore
though we speak of this fiery substance as acting,
yet it is to be understood only as a mean or in∣strument,
which indeed is the case of all mecha∣nical
causes whatsoever. They are nevertheless
sometimes termed agents and causes, although they
are by no means active in a strict and proper sig∣nification.
When, therefore, force, power, vir∣tue,
or action are mentioned as subsisting in an
extended and corporeal or mechanical being, this
is not to be taken in a true genuine and real, but
only in a gross and popular sense, which sticks
in appearances, and doth not analise things to
their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst principles. In compliance with esta∣blished
language, and the use of the world, we
must employ the popular current phrase. But
then in regard to truth we ought to distinguish
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
it's meaning. It may suffice to have made this
declaration once for all, in order to avoid mis∣takes.</P>
<P>156. The calidum innatum, the vital flame,
or animal spirit in man is supposed the cause of
all motions, in the several parts of his body, whe∣ther
voluntary or natural. That is, it is the in∣strument,
by means whereof the mind exerts and
manifests her self in the motions of the body. In
the same sense may not fire be said to have force,
to operate, and agitate the whole system of the
world, which is held together and informed by
one presiding mind, and animated throughout
by one and the same fiery substance, as an instru∣mental
and mechanical agent, not as a primary
real efficient?</P>
<P>157. This pure spirit or invisible fire is ever
ready to exert and shew it self in it's effects<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">152.</NOTE>,
cherishing, heating, fermenting, dissolving, shin∣ing
and operating in various manners, where a
subject offers to employ or determine it's force. It
is present in all parts of the earth and firmament,
though perhaps latent and unobserved, till some
accident produceth it into act, and renders it visi∣ble
in it's effects.</P>
<P>158. There is no effect in nature, great, mar∣vellous,
or terrible but proceeds from fire, that
diffused and active principle, which at the same
time that it shakes the earth and heavens, will en∣ter,
divide, and dissolve the smallest, closest, and
most compacted bodies. In remote cavities of the
earth it remains quiet, till perhaps an accidental
spark from the collision of one stone against an∣other
kindles an exhalation, that gives birth to an
earthquake or tempest, which splits mountains, or
overturns cities. This same fire stands unseen in
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
the focus of a burning glass, till subjects for it to
act upon come in it's way, when it is found to
melt, calcine, or vitrify the hardest bodies.</P>
<P>159. No eye could ever hitherto discern, and
no sense perceive, the animal spirit in a human
body, otherwise than from it's effects. The same
may be said of pure fire, or the spirit of the uni∣verse,
which is perceived only by means of some
other bodies, on which it operates, or with which
it is joined. What the chymists say, of pure acid's
being never found alone, might as well be said of
pure fire.</P>
<P>160. The mind of man acts by an instrument
necessarily. The <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or mind presiding
in the world, acts by an instrument freely. With∣out
instrumental and second causes, there could be
no regular course of nature. And without a re∣gular
course, nature could never be understood.
Mankind must always be at a loss, not knowing
what to expect, or how to govern themselves, or
direct their actions for the obtaining of any end.
Therefore in the government of the world physical
agents, improperly so called, or mechanical, or
second causes, or natural causes, or instruments,
are necessary to assist, not the governor, but the
governed.</P>
<P>161. In the human body the mind orders and
moves the limbs: but the animal spirit is sup∣posed
the immediate physical cause of their mo∣tion.
So likewise in the mundane system, a mind
presides, but the immediate, mechanical, or in∣strumental
cause, that moves or animates all it's
parts, is the pure elementary fire or spirit of the
world. The more fine and subtile part or spirit,
is supposed to receive the impressions of the first
mover, and communicate them to the grosser sen∣sible
parts of this world. Motion, though in me∣taphysical
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
rigor and truth a passion or mere effect,
yet, in physics, passeth for an action. And by this
action all effects are supposed to be produced.
Hence the various communications, determinati∣ons,
accelerations of motion constitute the laws of
nature.</P>
<P>162. The pure aether or invisible fire contains
parts of different kinds, that are impressed with
different forces, or subjected to different laws of
motion, attraction, repulsion and expansion, and
endued with divers distinct habitudes towards other
bodies, These seem to constitute the many vari∣ous
qualities<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">37, 40, 4.</NOTE>, virtues, flavours, odours, and co∣lour,
which distinguish natural productions. The
different modes of cohaesion, attraction, repulsion
and motion, appear to be the source from whence
the specific properties are derived, rather than diffe∣rent
shapes or figures. This, as hath been already
observed, seems confirmed by the experiment of
fixed salts operating one way, notwithstanding the
difference of their angles. The original particles
productive of odours, flavours, and other proper∣ties,
as well as of colours, are, one may suspect, all
contained and blended together in that universal and
original seminary of pure elementary fire; from
which they are diversly separated and attracted, by
the various subjects of the animal, vegetable, and
mineral kingdoms; which thereby become classed
into kinds, and endued with those distinct: proper∣ties,
which continue till their several forms, or spe∣cific
proportions of fire return into the common mass.</P>
<P>163. As the soul acts immediately on pure <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire,
so pure fire operates immediately on air. That is,
the abrasions of all terrestrial things being rendered
volatile and elastic by fire<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">149, 150, 152.</NOTE>, and at the same time
lessening the volatility and expansive force of the
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>
fire, whose particles they attract and adhere to<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">147.</NOTE>,
there is produced a new fluid, more volatile than
water or earth, and more fixed than fire. There∣fore
the virtues and operations imputed to air must
be ultimately attributed to fire, as that which im∣parts
activity to air it self.</P>
<P>164. The element of aethereal fire or light seems
to comprehend, in a mixed state, the seeds, the na∣tural
causes and forms<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">43.</NOTE> of all sublunary things.
The grosser bodies do separate, attract, and repel
the several constituent particles of that heterogene∣ous
element; which, being parted from the common
mass, make distinct essences, producing and com∣bining
together such qualities and properties, as are
peculiar to the several subjects, and thence often ex∣tracted
in essential oils or odoriferous waters, from
whence they exhale into the open air, and return
into their original element.</P>
<P>165. Blue, red, yellow, and other colours, have
been discovered by Sir Isaac Newton to depend on
the parted rays or particles of light. And in like
manner, a particular odour or flavour, seemeth to
depend on peculiar particles of light or fire<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">40.</NOTE>; as
appears from heats being necessary to all vegetation
whatsoever, and from the extreme minuteness and
volatility of those vegetable souls or forms, flying
off from the subjects without any sensible diminuti∣on
of their weight. These particles, blended in one
common ocean, should seem to conceal the distinct
forms, but, parted and attracted by proper sub∣jects,
disclose or produce them. As the particles
of light, which, when separated, sorm distinct co∣lours,
being blended are lost in one uniform ap∣pearance.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="75"/>
166. Agreeably thereto, an aethereal substance
or fire was supposed by Heraclitus to be the seed
of the generation of all things, or that from which
all things drew their original. The Stoics also
tanght, that all substance was originally fire, and
should return to fire: that an active subtile fire was
diffused or expanded throughout the whole uni∣verse;
the several parts whereof were produced,
sustained, and held together by it's force. And it
was the opinion of the Pythagoraeans, as Laertius
informs us, that heat or fire was the principle of
life animating the whole system, and penetrating
all the elements<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">152, 153.</NOTE>. The Platonists too, as well
as the Pythagoraeans, held fire to be the immedi∣ate
natural agent, or animal spirit; to cherish, to
warm, to heat, to enlighten, to vegetate, to pro∣duce
the digestions, circulations, secretions, and or∣ganical
motions in all living bodies, vegetable or
animal, being effects of that element, which, as
it actuates the macrocosm, so it animates the mi∣crocosm.
In the Timaeus of Plato, there is suppo∣sed
something like a net of fire, and rays of fire
in a human body. Doth not this seem to mean
the animal spirit, flowing, or rather darting through
the nerves?</P>
<P>167. According to the Peripatetics, the form
of heaven, or the fiery aethereal substance, contains
the forms of all inferior beings<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">43.</NOTE>. It may be said
to teem with forms, and impart them to subjects
sitted to receive them. The vital force thereof in
the Peripatetic sense is vital to all, but diversly re∣ceived
according to the diversity of the subjects.
So all colours are virtually contained in the light;
but their actual distinctions of blue, red, yellow,
and the rest, depend on the difference of the ob∣jects
<PB N="77" REF="76"/>
which it illustrates. Aristotle, in the book de
mundo, supposeth a certain fifth essence, an aethe∣real
nature unchangeable and impassive; and next
in order a subtile, flaming substance, lighted up,
or set on fire by that aethereal and divine nature.
He supposeth, indeed, that God is in heaven, but
that his power, or a force derived from him, doth
actuate and pervade the universe.</P>
<P>168. If we may credit Plutarch, Empedocles
thought aether or heat to be Jupiter. Aether by
the ancient philosophers was used to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignify promis∣cuously
sometimes fire and sometimes air. For
they distinguished two sorts of air. Plato in the
Timaeus speaking of air saith there are two kinds,
the one more fine and subtile, called aether, the o∣ther
more gross and replete with vapours! This
aether or purer medium seems to have been the air
or principle, from which all things according to
Anaximenes derived their birth, and into which
they were back again resolved at their death. Hip∣pocrates,
in his treatise de diaeta, speaketh of a
fire pure and invisible; and this fire, according
to him, is that which, stirring and giving move∣ment
to all things, causes them to appear, or,
as he stiles it, come into evidence, that is to ex∣ist,
every one in it's time, and according to it's
destiny.</P>
<P>169. This pure fire, aether, or substance of
light, was accounted in it self invisible and im∣perceptible
to all our senses, being perceived only
by it's effects, such as heat, flame, and rarefaction.
To which we may add, that the moderns pretend
farther to have perceived it by weight, inasmuch as
the aromatic oils which most abound with fire, as
being the most readily and vehemently enflamed,
are above all others the heaviest. And by an ex∣periment
of Mr. Homberg's, four ounces of regu∣lus
<PB N="78" REF="77"/>
of antimony, being calcined by a burning glass
for an hour together, were found to have imbibed
and fixed seven drams of the substance of light.</P>
<P>170. Such is the rarefying and expansive force
of this element, as to produce in an instant of time
the greatest and most stupendous effects: a suffici∣ent
proof not only of the power of fire, but also
of the wisdom with which it is managed, and with∣held
from bursting forth every moment to the ut∣ter
ravage and destruction of all things. And it is
very remarkable, that this same element, so fierce
and destructive, should yet be so variously temper∣ed
and applied, as to be withal the salutary warmth,
the genial, cherishing, and vital flame of all living
creatures. It is not therefore to be wondered that
Aristotle thought, the heat of a living body to be
somewhat divine and celestial, derived from that
pure aether to which he supposed the incorporeal
deity (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) to be immediately united, or
on which he supposed it immediately to act.</P>
<P>171. The Platonists held that intellect resided in
soul, and soul in an aethereal vehicle. And that as
the soul was a middle nature reconciling intellect
with aether; so aether was another middle nature,
which reconciled and connected the soul with grosser
bodies<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">152, 154.</NOTE>. Galen likewise taught that, admitting
the soul to be incorporeal, it hath for it's immedi∣ate
tegument or vehicle a body of aether or fire,
by the intervention whereof it moveth other bodies
and is mutually affected by them. This interior
clothing was supposed to remain upon the soul,
not only after death, but after the most perfect pur∣gation,
which in length of time according to the
followers of Plato and Pythagoras cleansed the soul,
—purumque reliquit</P>
<P>Aethereum sensum atque auräi simplicis ignem.
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>
This tunicle of the soul, whether it be called pure
aether, or luciform vehicle, or animal spirit seemeth
to be that which moves and acts upon the gross
organs, as it is determined by the soul from which
it immediately receives impression, and in which
the moving force truly and properly resides. Some
moderns have thought fit to deride all that is said of
aethereal vehicles, as mere jargon or words without
a meaning. But they should have considered, that
all speech concerning the soul is altogether, or for
the most part, metaphorical; and that, agreeably
thereunto, Plato speaketh of the mind or soul, as a
driver that guides and governs a chariot, which is,
not unfitly, stiled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a luciform aethereal ve∣hicle
or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, terms expressive of the purity,
lightness, subtilty and mobility of that fine celestial
nature, in which the soul immediately resides and
operates.</P>
<P>172. It was a tenet of the Stoics that the world
was an animal, and that providence answered to
the reasonable soul in man. But then the provi∣dence
or mind was supposed by them to be im∣mediately
resident or present in fire, to dwell there∣in,
and to act thereby. Briefly, they conceived
God to be an intellectual and fiery spirit, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Therefore though they looked
on fire<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">166.</NOTE> as the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or governing principle
of the world; yet it was not simply fire, but ani∣mated
with a mind.</P>
<P>173. Such are the bright and lively signatures of
a divine mind, operating and displaying itself in
fire and light throughout the world, that, as Ari∣stotle
observes in his book de mundo, all things
seem full of divinities, whose apparitions on all
sides strike and dazzle our eyes. And it must be
<PB N="80" REF="79"/>
owned, the chief philosophers and wise men of
antiquity, how much soever they attributed to se∣cond
causes and the force of fire, yet they supposed
a mind or intellect always resident therein, active
or provident, restraining it's force and directing it's
operations.</P>
<P>174. Thus Hippocrates in his treatise, de diaeta,
speaks of a strong but invisible fire<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">168.</NOTE>, that rules
all things without noise. Herein, saith he, resides
soul, understanding, prudence, growth, motion,
diminution, change, sleep and waking. This is
what governs all things and is never in repose. And
the same author, in his tract, de carnibus, after a
serious preface setting forth that he is about to de∣clare
his own opinion, expresseth it in these terms.
That which we call heat <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> appears to me
something immortal, which understands all things,
which sees and knows both what is present, and
what is to come.</P>
<P>175. This same is also what Hippocrates calls
nature, the author of life and death, good and evil.
It is farther to be noted of this heat, that he maketh
it the object of no sense. It is that occult, univer∣sal
nature, and inward invisible force, which actu∣ates
and animates the whole world, and was wor∣shiped
by the ancients under the name of Saturn;
which Vossius judges not improbably to be derived
from the Hebrew word Satar, to lye hidden or con∣cealed.
And what hath been delivered by Hip∣pocrates
agrees with the notions of other philoso∣phers:
Heraclitus,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">166.</NOTE> for instance, who held fire
to be the principle and cause of the generation of
all things, did not mean thereby an inanimate ele∣ment,
but, as he termed it, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, an ever∣living
fire.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="80"/>
176. Theophrastus, in his book, de igne;
distinguisheth between heat and fire. The
first he considers as a principle or cause, not
that which appeareth to sense as a passion or
accident existing in a subject, and which is in
truth the effect of that unseen principle. And
it is remarkable, that he refers the treating of
this invisible fire or heat, to the investigation
of the first causes. Fire, the principle, is nei∣ther
generated nor destroyed, is every where
and always present<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">157.</NOTE>: while it's effects in dif∣ferent
times and places shew themselves more or
less, and are very various, soft and cherishing,
or violent and destructive, terrible or agreeable,
conveying good and evil, growth and decay,
life and death, throughout the mundane system.</P>
<P>177. It is allowed by all, that the Greeks
derived much of their philosophy from the
Eastern nations. And Heraclitus is thought
by some to have drawn his principles from
Orpheus, as Orpheus did from the Aegyptians; or,
as others write, he had been auditor of Hippasus
a Pythagorean, who held the same notion of fire;
and might have derived it from Aegypt by his
master Pythagoras, who had travelled into Aegypt,
and been instructed by the Sages of that nation.
One of whose tenets it was, that fire was the
principle of all action; which is agreeable to the
doctrine of the Stoics, that the whole of things is
administered by a fiery intellectual Spirit. In the
Asclepian Dialogue, we find this notion, that all
parts of the world vegetate by a fine subtil aether,
which acts as an engine or instrument, subject to
the will of the supreme God.</P>
<P>178. As the Platonists held intellect to be
lodged in soul, and soul in aether<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">171.</NOTE>; so it passeth,
<PB N="82" REF="81"/>
for a doctrine of Trismegistus in the Pimander,
that mind is cloathed by soul, and soul by spirit.
Therefore as the animal spirit of man, being sub∣til
and luminous, is the immediate tegument of
the human soul, or that wherein and whereby she
acts; even so the spirit of the World, that active
fiery aethereal substance of Light, that permeates
and animates the whole system, is supposed to
cloath the soul, which cloaths the mind of the universe.</P>
<P>179. The Magi likewise said of God, that
he had light for his body and truth for his soul.
And in the Chaldaic oracles, all things are sup∣posed
to be governed by a <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or intellectu∣al
fire. And in the same oracles, the creative
mind is said to be cloathed with fire. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
which oriental reduplication of the word
fire, seems to imply the extreme purity and force
thereof. Thus also in the Psalms, Thou art clothed
with light as with a garment. Where, the word
rendered light might have been rendered fire, the
Hebrew letters being the same with those in the
word which signifies fire, all the difference being
in the pointing, which is justly counted a late in∣vention.
That other scripture sentence is remarka∣ble:
who maketh his ministers a flaming fire:
which might, perhaps, be rendered more agree∣ably
to the context, as well as consistently with
the Hebrew, after this manner: who maketh
flaming fire his ministers: and the whole might
run thus: who maketh the winds his messengers,
and flaming fire his ministers.</P>
<P>180. A notion of something divine in Fire,
animating the whole world, and ordering it's se∣veral
parts, was a tenet of very general extent<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">156, 157, 163, 166, 167, 168, 170, 172, 173, 174, 175, 177, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>,
<PB N="83" REF="82"/>
being embraced in the most distant times and
places, even among the Chinese themselves; who
make tien, aether, or heaven, the sovereign prin∣ciple,
or cause of all things, and teach that the
caelestial virtue, by them called li, when joined to
corporeal substance, doth fashion, distinguish, and
specificate all natural beings. This li of the Chi∣nese
seems to answer the forms of the peripatetics.
And both bear analogy to the foregoing philoso∣phy
of Fire.</P>
<P>181. The Heaven is supposed pregnant with
virtues and forms, which constitute and discrimi∣nate
the various species of things. And we have
more than once observed, that, as the light, fire,
or caelestial aether, being parted by refracting or
reflecting bodies, produceth variety of colours;
even so, that same apparently uniform substance
being parted and secreted by the attracting and re∣pelling
powers of the divers secretory ducts of
plants and animals, that is, by natural chemistry,
produceth or imparteth the various specific pro∣perties
of natural bodies. Whence the tastes and
odours and medicinal virtues so various in vegeta∣bles.</P>
<P>182. The tien is considered and adored by the
learned Chinese, as living and intelligent aether,
the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the Chaldaeans and the Stoics. And
the worship of things caelestial, the Sun and Stars,
among the Eastern nations less remote, was on ac∣count
of their fiery nature, their heat and light,
and the influence thereof. Upon these accounts,
the Sun was looked on by the Greek Theologers
as the spirit of the world, and the power of the
world. The cleansing quality, the light and heat
of fire are natural symbols of purity, knowledge,
and power, or, if I may so say, the things them∣selves
<PB N="84" REF="83"/>
so far as they are perceptible to our senses,
or in the same sense as motion is said to be action.
Accordingly, we find a religious regard was paid
to fire, both by Greeks and Romans, and indeed
by most if not all, the nations or the world.</P>
<P>183. The worship of Vesta at Rome was, in
truth, the worship of Fire.</P>
<P>Nec tu aliud Ves<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am quam vivam intellige flam∣mam,
Saith Ovid in his Fasti. And as in old Rome
the eternal Fire was religiously kept by virgins, so
In Greece, particularly at Delphi and Athens, it
was kept by widows. It is well known that
Vulcan or Fire was worshipped wish great di∣stinction
by the Aegyptians. The Zabii or Sa∣beans
are also known to have been worshippers
of Fire. It appears too from the Chaldaeans ora∣cles,
that Fire was regarded as divine by the sages
of that nation. And it is supposed that Ur of the
Chaldaeans was so called from the Hebrew word
signifying fire, because fire was publickly wor∣shiped
in that city. That a religious worship was
paid to fire by the ancient Persians and their Ma∣gi,
is attested by all antiquity. And the sect of
Persees, or old Gentils, of whom there are con∣siderable
remains at this day both in the Mogols
country and in Persia, doth testify the same.</P>
<P>184. It doth not seem that there prostrations
before the perpetual <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ires, preserved with great
care in their Pyreia, or fire temples, were merely
a civil respect, as Dr. Hyde would have it thought.
Although he brings good proof that they do not
invoke the fire on their altars, or pray to it, or
call it God: and that they acknowledge a supreme
invisible deity. Civil respects are paid to things
<PB N="85" REF="84"/>
as related to civil power: but such relation doth
not appear in the present case. It shou'd seem
therefore, that they worship God as present in
the fire, which they worship or reverence, not
ultimately or for it self, but relatively to the su∣preme
being. Which it is not unlikely was else∣where
the case at first; though the practice of
men, especially of the vulgar, might in length
of time degenerate from the original institution,
and rest in the object of sense.</P>
<P>185. Doctor Hyde, in his history of the re∣ligion
of the ancient Persians, would have it
thought, that they borrowed the use and reverence
or perpetual fires, from the Jewish practice pre∣scribed
in the Levitical law, of keeping a per∣petual
fire burning oh the altar. Whether that
was the case or not, thus much one may venture
to say, it seems probable that whatever was the
original of this custom among the Persians, the
like customs among the Greeks and Romans
ware derived from, the same, source.</P>
<P>186. IT must be owned there are many pas∣sages
in holy scripture<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">179.</NOTE>, that would make one
think, the supreme being was in a peculiar man∣ner
present and manifest in the element of fire.
Not to insist that God is more than once said to
be a consuming fire, which might be understood
in a metaphorical sense, the divine apparitions
were by fire, in the bush, at mount Sinai, on
the tabernacle, in the cloven tongues. God is
represented in the inspired writings, as descend∣ing
in fire, as attended by fire, or with fire going
before him. Caelestial things as Angels, chariots,
and such like phaenomena are invested with fire,
light, and splendor. Ezekiel in his visions beheld
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>
fire and brightness, lamps, burning coals of fire,
and flashes of lightening. In a vision of Daniel
the throne of God appeared like a siery flame,
and his wheels like burning fire. Also a siery
flame issued and came forth from before him.</P>
<P>187. At the transfiguration, the apostles saw
our saviour's face shining as the sun, and his r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ment
white as light, also a lucid cloud or body
of light, out of which the voice came; which
visible light and splendor was, not many centuries
ago, maintained by the Greek church, to have
been divine, and uncreated, and the very glory
of God: as may be seen in the history wrote by
the Emperor John Cantacuzene. And of late
years Bishop Patrick gives it as his opinio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that
in the beginning of the world, the Shecinah or
divine presence, which was then frequent and or∣dinary,
appeared by light or fire. In commenting
on that passage, where Cain is said to have gone
out form the presence of the Lord, the Bishop ob∣serves,
that If Cain after this turned a downright
idolater, as many think, it is very likely he in∣troduced
the worship of the sun, as the best re∣semblance
he could find of the glory of the Lord,
which was wont to appear in a flaming light. It
would be endless to enumerate all the passages of
holy scripture, which confirm and illustrate this
notion, or represent the Deity as appearing and
operating by fire. The misconstruction of which
might possibly have mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed the Gnostics, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
and other ancient Heretics into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n opinion, that
Jesus Christ was the visible corporeal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>188. We have seen, that in the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emote
ages and countries, the vulgar as well as the learn∣ed,
the institutions of lawgivers, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the
reasonings of philosophers, have ever considered
<PB N="87" REF="86"/>
the element of fire in a peculiar light, and treated
it with more than common regard, as if it were
something of a very singular and extraordinary
nature. Nor are there wanting authors of princi∣pal
account among the moderns, who entertain
like notions concerning fire, especially among those
who are most conversant in that element, and
should seem best acquainted with it.</P>
<P>189. Mr. Homberg the famous modern chemist,
who brought that art to so great perfection, holds
the substance of light or fire to be the true chemic
principal sulphur,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">129</NOTE> and to extend it self through∣out
the the whole universe. It is his opinion that
this is the only active principle. That mixed with
various things it formeth, several sorts of natural
productions, With salts making oyl, with earth
bitumen, with mercury metal. That this princi∣ple
of sulphur, fire, or the substance of light, is in
it self imperceptible, and only becomes sensible
as it is joined with some other principle, which
serves as a vehicle for it. That, although it be
the most active of all things, yet it is at the same
time the most firm bond and cement to combine
and hold the principles together, and give form to
the mixed bodies. And, that in the analysis of
bodies it is always lost, escaping the skill of the
artist, and passing, through the closest vessels.</P>
<P>190. Boe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>have, Niewenty't, and divers other
moderns are in the same way of thinking. They
with the ancients distinguish a pure, elementary,
invisible fire from the culinary, or that which ap∣pears
in ignited bodies<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">163▪ 166.</NOTE>. This last they will not
allow to be pure <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire. The pure fire is to be dis∣cerned
by it's effects alone; such as heat, dila∣tation
of all solid bodies, and rarefaction of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luids,
<PB N="88" REF="87"/>
the segregating heterogeneous bodies, and con∣gregating
those that are homogeneous. That
therefore which smokes and flames is not pure fire,
but that which is collected in the focus of a mir∣rour
or burning glass. This fire seems the source
of all the operations in nature: without it nothing
either vegetates, or putrefies, lives or moves or
ferments, is dissolved or compounded or altered
throughout this whole natural world in which we
subsist. Were it not for this, the whole wou'd
be one great stupid inanimate mass. But this
active element is supposed to be every where, and
always present, imparting different degrees of lise
heat and motion, to the various animals vegeta∣bles
and other natural productions, as well as to
the elements themselves, wherein they are pro∣duced
and nourished.</P>
<P>191. As water acts upon salt, or aqua fortis up∣on
iron, so fire dissolves all other bodies. Fire,
air, and water are all three menstruums: but the
two last seem to derive all their force and activity
from the first<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">149</NOTE>. And indeed there seems to be,
originall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or ultimately, but one menstruum in
nature, to which all other menstruums, may be
reduced. Acid salts are a menstruum, but their
force and distinct powers are from sulphur. Con∣sidered
as pure, or in themselves, they are all of
the same nature. But, as obtained by distilla∣tion,
they are constantly joined with some sul∣phur,
which characterizeth and cannot be sepa∣rated
from them. This is the doctrine of mon∣sieur
Homberg. But what is it that characteriz∣eth
or differenceth the sulphurs themselves? If
sulphur be the substance of light, as that author
will have it, whence is it that animal, vege∣table,
<PB N="89" REF="88"/>
and metallic sulphurs impart different qua∣lities
to the same acid salt? Can this be ex∣plained
upon Homberg's principles? And are
we not obliged to suppose, that light separated
by the attracting and repelling powers in the strain∣ers,
ducts, and pores of those bodies, doth form
several distinct kinds of sulphur, all which, be∣fore
such separation, were lost and blended toge∣ther,
in one common mass of light or fire seem∣ingly
homogeneous.</P>
<P>192. In the analysis of inflammable bodies, the
fire or sulphur lost, and the diminution of weight
sheweth the the loss<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">169.</NOTE>. Oil is resolved into wa∣ter,
earth, and salt, none of which is inflamma∣ble.
But the fire or vinculum which connected
those things, and gave the form of oil, escapes
from the artist. It disappears but is not destroyed.
Light or fire imprisoned made part of the com∣pound,
gave union to the other parts, and form
to the whole. But having escaped, it mingles
with the general ocean of aether, till being again
parted and attracted, it enters and specificates some
new subject, of the animal vegetable, or mineral
kingdom. Fire therefore in the sense of Philo∣sophers
is always fire, though not always flame.</P>
<P>193. Solar fire or light, in calcining certain
bodies, is observed to add to their weight. There
it therefore no doubt but light can be fixed, and
enter the composition of a body. And though it
should lye latent for a long time, yet, being set
free from it's prison, it shall still shew itself to be
fire. Lead, tin, or regulus of antimony, being
exposed to the fire of a burning glass, though they
lose much in smoke and steam, are nevertherless
found to be considerably increased in weight,
which proves the introduction of light or fire in∣to
<PB N="90" REF="89"/>
their pores. It is also observed, that urine pro∣duceth
no phosphorus, unless it be long exposed
to the solar light. From all which it may be
concluded, that bodies do attract and fix the
light, whence it should seem, as some have ob∣served,
that fire without burning is an ingredi∣ent
in many things, as water without wetting.</P>
<P>194. Of this there cannot be a better proof,
than the Experiment of monsieur Homberg, who
made gold of mercury by introducing light into
it's pores, but at such trouble and expence, that
I suppose no body will try the experiment for
profit. By this junction of light and mercury,
both bodies became fixed, and produced a third
different from either, to wit, real gold. For the
truth of which fact, I refer to the memoirs of the
French academy of Sciences. From the forego∣ing
experiment it appears, that Gold is only a
mass of Mercury penetrated and cemented by the
substance of light, the particles of those bodies
attracting and fixing each other. This seems to
have been not altogether unknown to former
Philosophers, Marsilius Ficinus the Platonist, in
his commentary on the first book of the second
Ennead of Plotinus. And others likewise before
him, regarding Mercury as the mother, and Sul∣phur
as the father of Metals; and Plato himself
in his Timaeus describing gold, to be a dense fluid
with a shining yellow light, which well suits a
composition of light and Mercury.</P>
<P>195. Fire or light mixeth with all bodies<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">157.</NOTE>,
even with water; witness the flashing lights in
the Sea, whose waves seem frequently all in
fire. It's operations are various according to it's
kind, quantity, and degree of vehemence. One
<PB N="91" REF="90"/>
degree keeps water fluid, another turns it into ela∣stic
air<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">149.</NOTE>. And air itself seems to be nothing
else but vapours and exhalations, rendered elastic
by fire. Nothing flames but oil: and sulphur
with water, salt, and earth compose oil; which
sulphur is fire: therefore fire enclosed attracts
fire, and causeth the bodies whose composition it
enters to burn and blaze.</P>
<P>196. Fire collected in the focus of a glass ope∣rates
in vacuo, and therefore is thought not to need air to
support it. Calx of lead hath gone
off with an explosion in vacuo, which Niewenty't
and others take for a proof that fire can burn
without air. But Mr. Hales attributes this effect
to air enclosed in the red lead, and perhaps to
in the receiver, which cannot be perfectly ex∣hausted.
When common lead is put into the fire
in order to make red-lead, a greater weight of
this comes out than was put in of common lead.
Therefore the red-lead should seem impregnated
with fire. Mr. Hales thinks it is with air. The
vast expansion of compound aqua fortis, Mr.
Niewenty't will have to proceed from fire alone.
Mr. Hales contends that air must necessarily co∣operate.
Though by Niewenty't's experiment it
should seem, the phosphorus burns equally,
with and without air.</P>
<P>197. Perhaps they who hold the opposite sides
in this question, may be reconciled by observing
that air is in reality nothing more than particles
of wet and dry bodies volatilised, and rendered
elastic by fire<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">147. 150, 151.</NOTE>. Whatever therefore is done
by air must be ascribed to fire, which fire is a
subtile invisible thing, whose operation is not to
be discerned but by means of some grosser body,
<PB N="92" REF="91"/>
which serves not for a pabulum to nourish the
fire, but for a vehicle to arrest and bring it into
view. Which seems the sole use of oil, air, or
any other thing, that vulgarly passeth for a pa∣bulum
or food of that element.</P>
<P>198. To explain this matter more clearly, it is
to be observed, that fire, in order to become sen∣sible,
must have some subject to act upon. This
being penetrated and agitated by fire affects us
with light, heat, or some other sensible alteration.
And this subject so wrought upon may be called
culinary fire. In the focus of a burning glass ex∣posed
to the sun, there is real actual fire, though
not discerned by the sense, till it hath somewhat
to work on, and can shew it self in it's effects,
heating, flaming, melting, and the like. Every
ignited body is, in the foregoing sense, culinary
fire. But it will not therefore follow, that it is
convertible into pure elementary fire. This, for
ought that appears, may be ingenerable and in∣corruptible
by the course of nature. It may be
fixed and imprisoned in a compound<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">169, 1920 193.</NOTE>, and yet
retain it's nature, though lost to sense, and though
it return into the invisible elementary mass, upon
the analysis of the compounded body: as is ma∣nifest
in the solution of stone lime by water.</P>
<P>199. It should seem, therefore, that what is said
of air's being the pabulum of fire, or being con∣verted
into fire, ought to be understood only in
this sense; to wit, that air being less gross than o∣ther
bodies, is of a middle nature, and therefore
more fit to receive the impressions of a fine aethe∣rial
fire<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">163.</NOTE>, and impart them to other things. Ac∣cording
to the antients, soul serveth for a vehicle to
<PB N="93" REF="92"/>
intellect<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">178.</NOTE>, and light or fire for a vehicle to the
soul; and, in like manner, air may be supposed a
vehicle to fire, fixing it in some degree, and com∣municating
it's effects to other bodies.</P>
<P>200. The pure invisible fire or aether doth per∣meate
all bodies, even the hardest and most solid
as the diamond. This alone, therefore, cannot as
some learned men have supposed, be the cause
of muscular motion, by a mere impulse of the
nerves communicated from the brain to the mem∣branes
of the muscles, and thereby to the enclosed
aether, whose expansive motion, being by that
means increased, is thought to swell the muscles
and cause a contraction of the fleshy fibres. This
it shou'd seem, the pure aether cannot do immedi∣ately,
and of itself, because, supposing it's expan∣sive
motion to be increased, it must still pass
through the membranes, and consequently not
swell them, inasmuch as aether is supposed freely
to pervade the most solid bodies. It should seem
therefore that this effect must be owing, not to
pure aether, but to aether in some part fixed and
arrested by the particles of air.</P>
<P>201. Although this aether be extremely elastic,
yet, as it is sometimes found by experience to be
attracted imprisoned and detained in gross bodies
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">169.</NOTE>, so we may suppose it to be attracted, and
it's expansive force diminished, though it should
not be quite fixed, by the loose particles of air,
which combining and cohering therewith may
bring it down, and qualify it for intercourse with
grosser things. Pure fire may be said to animate
air, and air other things. Pure fire is invisible;
therefore flame is not pure fire. Air is necessary
both to lise and flame. And it is found by experi∣ment,
<PB N="94" REF="93"/>
that air loseth in the lungs the power of
feeding flame. Hence it is concluded, that the
same thing in air contributes both to life and flame.
Vital flame survives culinary flame in vacuo:
therefore it requires less of that thing to sustain it.</P>
<P>202. What this may be, whether some certain
proportion, or some peculiar parts of aether, is
not easy to say. But thus much seems plain, that
whatever is ascribed to acid may be also ascribed
to fire or aether. The particles of aether fly asun∣der
with the greatest force: therefore, agreeably
to sir Isaac Newton's doctrine, when united they
must attract each other with the greatest force.
Therefore they constitute the acid. For whatso∣ever
strongly attracts and is attracted, may be cal∣led
an acid, as sir Isaac Newton informs us in his
tract de acido. Hence it should seem, that the
sulphur of Homberg and the acid of sir Isaac are
at bottom one and the same thing, to wit, pure
fire or aether.</P>
<P>203. The vital flame or aethereal spirit, being
attracted and imprisoned in grosser bodies, seem∣eth
to be set free and carried off, by the superior
attraction of a subtil and pure flame. Hence, per∣haps
it is, that lightening kills animals, and turns
spirituous liquors vapid in an instant.</P>
<P>204. Hippocrates in his book concerning the
Heart observeth, that the soul of man is not nou∣rished
by meats and drinks from the lower belly,
but by a pure and luminous substance darting it's
rays, and distributing a non natural nourishment,
as he terms it, in like manner as that from the in∣testines
is distributed to all parts of the body. This
luminous non natural nourishment, though it be
secreted from the blood, is expresly said not to
come from the lower belly. It is plain, therfore,
<PB N="95" REF="94"/>
he thought it came into the blood either by respi∣ration,
or by attraction through the pores. And it
must be acknowledged, that somewhat igneous or
aethereal brought by the air into the blood seems
to nourish, though not the soul it self, yet the in∣terior
tunicle of the soul, the aurai simplicis ignem.</P>
<P>205. That there is really such a thing as vital
flame, actually kindled, nourish'd, and extinguish'd
like common flame, and by the same means, is an
opinion of some moderns, particularly of Doctor
Willis in his tract de sanguinis accensione: that it
requires constant eventilation, through the trachaea
and pores of the body, for the discharge of a
suliginous and excrementitious vapour: and that
this vital flame, being extremely subtil, might
not be seen any more than shining flies or ignes
fatui by day-light. And yet it hath sometimes
become visible on divers persons, of which there
are undoubted instances. This is Dr. Willis's no∣tion:
and perhaps there may be some truth in this,
if it be so understood, as that light or fire might
indeed constitute the animal spirit or immediate
vehicle of the soul.</P>
<P>206. There have not been wanting those, who,
not content to suppose light the most pure and re∣fined
of all corporeal beings, have gone farther,
and bestowed upon it some attributes of a yet higher
nature. Julianus the Platonic philosopher, as
cited by Ficinus, saith it was a doctrine in the
theology of the Phaenicians, that there is diffused
throughout the universe, a pellucid and shining na∣ture
pure and impassive, the act of a pure intelli∣gence.
And Ficinus himself undertakes to prove,
that light is incorporeal, by several arguments:
Because it enlightens and fills a great sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce in an
instant, and without opposition: Because several
<PB N="96" REF="95"/>
lights meet without resisting each other: Because
light cannot be defiled by filth of any kind: Be∣cause
the solar light is not fixed in any subject:
Lastly, because it contracts and expands it self so
easily without collision, condensation, rarefaction,
or delay throughout the vastest space. These rea∣sons
are given by Ficinus, in his comment on the
first book of the second Ennead of Plotinus.</P>
<P>207. But it is now well known, that light
moves, and that it's motion is not instantaneous:
that it is capable of condensation, rarefaction, and
collision: that it can be mixed with other bodies,
enter their composition, and increase their weight
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">168, 192, 193.</NOTE>. All which seems sufficiently to overthrow
those arguments of Ficinus, and shew light to be
corporeal. There appears indeed some difficulty
at first sight, about the non resistance of rays or
particles of light occurring one to another, in
all possible directions or from all points. Par∣ticularly,
if we suppose the hollow surface of a
large sphere, studded with eyes looking inwards
one at another, it may perhaps seem hard to con∣ceive,
how distinct rays from every eye should
arrive at every other eye without justling, re∣pelling,
and confounding each other.</P>
<P>208. But these difficulties may be got over by
considering in the first place, that visible points
are not mathematical points, and consequently
that we are not to suppose every point of space a
radiating point. Secondly, by granting that
many rays do resist and intercept each other, not∣withstanding
which the act of vision may be
performed. Since as every point of the object
is not seen, so it is not necessary that rays from
every such point arrive at the eye. We often see
<PB N="97" REF="96"/>
an object, though more dimly, when many rays
are intercepted by a gross medium.</P>
<P>209. Besides we may suppose the particles of
light to be indefinitely small, that is as small as
we please, and their aggregate to bear as small a
proportion to the void as we please, there being
nothing in this that contradicts the phaenomena.
And there needs nothing more, in order to con∣ceive
the possibility of rays passing from and to
all visible points, although they be not incorpo∣real.
Suppose a hundred ports placed round a
circular sea, and ships sailing from each port to
every other; the larger the sea, and the smaller
the vessels are supposed, the less danger will there
be of their striking against each other. But as
there is by hypothesis no limited proportion be∣tween
the sea and the ships, the void and solid
particles of light, so there is no difficulty that can
oblige us to conclude the sun's light incorporeal
from it's free passage; especially when there are
so many clear proofs of the contrary. As for the
difficulty, therefore, attending the supposition of
a sphere studded with eyes looking at each other,
this is removed only by supposing the particles
of light exceeding small relatively to the empty
spaces.</P>
<P>210. Plotinus supposeth, that from the sun's
light which is corporeal, there springs forth ano∣ther
equivocal light which is incorporeal, and as
it were the brightness of the former. Marsilius
Ficinus also, observing it to be a doctrine in the
Timaeus of Plato, that there is an occult fire or
spirit diffused throughout the universe, intimates
that this same occult invisible fire or light is, as it
were, the sight of the mundane soul. And Plo∣tinus
in his fourth Ennead sheweth it to be his
opinion, that the world seeth it self and all it's
<PB N="98" REF="97"/>
parts. The Platonic philosophers do wonderfully
refine upon light, and soar very high: from coal
to flame; from flame to light; from this visible
light to the occult light of the celestial or mun∣dane
soul, which they supposed to pervade and
agitate the substance of the universe by it's vigo∣rous
and expansive motion.</P>
<P>211. If we may believe Diogenes Laertius, the
Pythagorean philosophers thought there was a
certain pure heat or fire, which had somewhat divine
in it, by the participation whereof men be∣came
allied to the Gods. And according to the
Platonists, Heaven is not defined so much by it's
local situation, as by it's purity. The purest and
most excellent fire, that is Heaven, saith Ficinus.
And again, the hidden fire that every where ex∣erts
it self, he calls celestial. He represents fire
as most powerful and active, dividing all things,
abhorring all composition or mixture with other
bodies. And, as soon as it gets free, relapsing
instantly into the common mass of celestial fire,
which is every where present and latent.</P>
<P>112. This is the general source of life, spirit,
and strength, and, therefore of health to all ani∣mals,
who constantly receive it's illapses cloathed
in air, through the lungs and pores of the body.
The same spirit imprisoned in food and medicines,
is conveyed into the stomach, the bowels, the
lacteals, circulated and secreted by the several
ducts, and distributed throughout the system<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">37, 42, 44.</NOTE>.
Plato in his Timaeus enumerating the ignited
juices, names wine in the first place, and tar in
the second. But wine is pressed from the grape,
and fermented by human industry. Therefore of
all ignited juices purely natural, tar or resin must
in his account be esteemed the first.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="98"/>
213. The vivifying luminous aether exists in all
places, even the darkest caverns, as is evident
from hence, that many animals see in those dark
places, and that fire may be kindled in them by
the collision or attrition of bodies. It is also
known that certain persons have fits of seeing in
the dark. Tiberius was said to have this faculty
or distemper. I my self knew an ingenious man
who had experienced it several times in himself.
And Doctor Willis in his tract de sanguinis ac∣censione
mentions another of his own knowledge.
This luminous aether or spirit is therefore said by
Virgil, to nourish or cherish the innermost earth,
as well as the heavens and celestial bodies.</P>
<P>Principio coelum ac terras, camposque liquentes.
Lucentemque globum Lunae, Titaniaque astra
Spiritus intus alit.</P>
<P>214. The principles of motion and vegetation
in living bodies seem to be delibations from the
invisible fire or spirit of the universe<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">43, 157, 164, 171.</NOTE>. Which,
though present to all things, is not nevertheless
one way received by all; but variously imbibed,
attracted, and secreted by the fine capillaries, and
exquisite strainers in the bodies of plants and ani∣mals,
whereby it becomes mixed and detained in
their juices.</P>
<P>215. It hath been thought by some observers
of nature, that the fine glandular vessels admit
from the common mass of the blood, only such
juices as are homogeneous to those, with which
they were originally imbued. How they came to
be so imbued doth not appear. But thus much
is plain; That fine tubes attract sluids, that the
glands are fine tubes, and that they attract very
<PB N="100" REF="99"/>
different juices from the common mass. The same
holds also with regard to the capillary vessels<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">30, 31, 33, 35.</NOTE>
of vegetables, it being evident that through the
fine strainers in the leaves and all over the body
of the plant, there be juices or fluids of a parti∣cular
kind drawn in, and separated from the com∣mon
mass of air and light. And that the most
elaborate spirit, whereon the character or distin∣guishing
virtue and properties of the plant depend,
is of a luminous<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">37, 43.</NOTE> and volatile nature, being
lost or escaping into air or aether, from essential
oils and odoriferous waters, without any sensible
diminution of the subject.</P>
<P>216. As different kinds of secreted light or fire
produce different essences, virtues, or specific pro∣perties,
so also different degrees of heat produce
different effects. Thus one degree of heat keeps
the blood from coagulating, and another degree
coagulates the blood. Thus a more violent fire
hath been observed to set free and carry off that
very light, which a more moderate fire had in∣troduced
and fixed in the calcined regulus of an∣timony.
In like manner, one kind or quantity
of this aetherial fiery spirit may be congenial and
friendly to the spirits of a man, while another
may be noxious.</P>
<P>217. And experience sheweth this to be true.
For the fermented spirit of wine or other liquors
produceth irregular motions, and subsequent de∣pressions
in the animal spirits. Whereas the lu∣minous
spirit lodged and detained in the native bal∣sam
of pines and firs, is of a nature so mild and
benign and proportioned to the human constitution,
as to warm without heating, to cheer but not ine∣briates,
<PB N="101" REF="100"/>
and to produce a calm and steady joy like the
effect of good news, without that sinking of spirits
which is a subsequent effect of all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermented cor∣dials.
I may add, without all other inconvenience,
except that it may like any other medicine be taken
in too great a quantity for too nice a stomach. In
which case it may be right, to lessen the dose, or
to take it only once in the four and twenty hours,
empty, going to bed (when it is found to be least
offensive,) or even to suspend the taking of it for
a time, till nature shall seem to crave it, and re∣joice
in it's benign and comfortable spirit.</P>
<P>218. Tar water serving as a vehicle to this spirit
is both diuretic and diaphoretic, but seems to work
it's principal effect by assisting the vis vitae, as an
alterative and cordial, enabling nature by an ac∣cession
of congenial spirit, to assimilate that which
could not be assimilated by her proper force, and
so to subdue the fomes morbi. And this should
seem in most cases the best and safest course. Great
evacuations weaken nature as well as the disease.
And it is to be feared that they who use saliva∣tions
and copious bleedings may, though they
should recover of the distemper, in their whole
life be never able to recover of the remedies.</P>
<P>219. It is true indeed, that in chronical cases
there is need of time to compleat a cure, and yet
I have known this tar water in disorders of the
lungs and stomach to prove a very speedy remedy,
and to allay the anxiety and heat of a fever in an
instant, giving ease and spirits to the patient.
This I have often experienced, not without sur∣prise
at seeing these salutary effects follow so im∣mediately
in a fever on taking a glass of tar wa∣ter.
Such is the force of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se active viv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fying
principles contained in this balsam.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="101"/>
220. Force or power, strictly speaking, in the
agent alone who imparts an equivocal force to the
invisible elementary sire, or animal spirit<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">153, 156, 157,</NOTE> of
the world, and this to the ignited body or visible
flame, which produceth the sense of light and
heat. In this chain the first and last links are al∣lowed
to be incorporeal: the two intermediate are
corporeal, being capable of motion, rarefaction,
gravity, and other dualities of bodies. It is fit
to distinguish these things, in order to avoid am∣biguity
concerning the nature of fire.</P>
<P>221. Sir Isaac Newton in his optics, asks; Is
not fire a body heated so hot as to emit light
copiously? for what else, adds he, is a red hot
iron than fire? Now it should seem, that to de∣fine
fire by heat, would be to explain a thing by it
self. A body heated so hot as to emit light is an
ignited body, that is, hath fire in it, is penetra∣ted
and agitated by fire, but is not it self fire.
And although it should in the third foregoing ac∣ceptation,
or vulgar sense pass for fire, yet it is
not the pure elementary<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">190.</NOTE> fire in the second or
philosophic sense, such as was understood by the
Sages of antiquity, and such as is collected in the
focus of a burning glass; much less is it the vis,
force, or power of burning, destroying, calcining,
melting, vitrifying, and raising the perceptions
of light and heat. This is truly and really in the
incorporeal agent, and not in the vital spirit of
the universe. Motion, and even power in an
equivocal sense, may be found in this pure aethe∣real
spirit, which ignites bodies, but is not it self
the ignited body, being an instrument or medium
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">160.</NOTE> by which the real agent doth operate on
grosser bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="102"/>
222. It hath been shewed in sir Isaac New∣ton's
optics, that light is not reflected by imping∣ing
on bodies, but by some other cause. And to
him it seems probable, that as many rays as im∣pinge
on the solid parts of bodies, are not re∣flected
but stifled and retained in the bodies. And
it is certain, the great porosity of all known bodies
affords room for much of this light or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire to be
lodged therein. Gold it self the most solid of all
metals, seems to have far more pores than solid
parts, from water being pressed through it in the
Florentine experiment, from magnetic effluvia
passing, and from mercury entering it's pores so
freely. And it is admitted that water though im∣possible
to be compressed hath at least sorty times
more pores than solid parts. And as acid par∣ticles,
joined with those of earth in certain pro∣portions,
are so closely united with them, as to
be quite hid and lost to all appearance, as in mer∣curius
dulcis and common sulphur, so also may
we conceive the particles of light or fire to be ab∣sorbed
and latent in grosser bodies.</P>
<P>123. It is the opinion of sir Isaac Newton, that
somewhat unknown remains in vacuo, when the
air is exhausted. This unknown medium he calls
aether. He supposeth it to be more subtil in it's
nature, and more swift in its motion, than light,
freely to pervade all bodies, and by it's immense
elasticity to be expanded throughout all the hea∣vens.
It's density is supposed greater in free and
open spaces, than within the pores of compact
bodies. And, in passing from the celestial bodies
to great distances, it it supposed to grow denser
and denser continually; and thereby cause those
great bodies to gravitate towards one another, and
their respective parts towards their centers, every
<PB N="104" REF="103"/>
body endeavouring to pass from the denser parts
of the medium towards the rarer.</P>
<P>224. The extreme minuteness of the parts of this
medium and the velocity of their motion, together
with it's gravity density and elastic <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orce, are
thought to qualify it for being the cause of all the
natural motions in the universe. To this cause are
ascribed the gravity and cohesion of bodies. The
refraction of light is also thought to proceed, from
the different density and elastic force of this aethe∣rial
medium in different places. The vibrations of
this medium alternately concurring with, or ob∣structing,
the motions of the rays of light, are
supposed to produce the fits of easy reflexion or
transmiffion. Light by the vibrations of this medi∣um
is thought to communicate heat to bodies. Ani∣mal
motion and sensation are also accounted for by
the vibrating motions of this aetherial medium, pro∣pagated
through the solid capillaments of the nerves.
In a word, all the phaenomena and properties of
bodies, that were before attributed to attraction,
upon later thoughts seem ascribed to this aether,
together with the various attractions themselves.</P>
<P>225. But in the philosophy of sir Isaac Newton;
the fits (as they are called) of easy transmission and
reflexion, seem as well accounted for by vibrations
excited in bodies by the rays of light, and the re∣fraction
of light by the attraction or bodies. To ex∣plain
the vibrations of light by those of a more sub∣til
medium, seems an uncouth explication. And
gravity seems not an effect of the density and elas∣ticity
of aether, but rather to be produced by some
other cause; which sir Isaac himself insinuates to
have been the opinion even of those ancients who
took vacuum, atoms, and the gravity of atoms for
the principles of their philosophy, tacitly attri∣buting
<PB N="105" REF="104"/>
(as he well observes) gravity to some o∣ther
cause distinct from matter, from atoms and,
consequently, from that homogeneous aether or
elastic fluid. The elasticity of which fluid is sup∣posed
to depend upon, to be defined and measured
by it's density; and this by the quantity of mat∣ter
in one particle, multiplied by the number of
particles contained in a given space; and the quan∣tity
of matter in any one particle or body of a
given size to be determined by it's gravity. Should
not therefore gravity seem the original property
and first supposed? On the other hand, if force
be considered as prescinded from gravity and mat∣ter,
and as existing only in points or centers, what
can this amount to but an abstract spiritual incor∣poreal
force?</P>
<P>226. It doth not seem necessary from the phae∣nomena,
to suppose any medium more active and
subtil than light or fire. Light being allowed to
move at the rate of about ten millions of miles in
a minute, what occasion is there to conceive ano∣ther
medium of still smaller and more moveable
parts. Light or fire seems the same with aether.
So the ancients understood, and so the Greek
word implies. It perv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>des all things<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">157.</NOTE>, is every
where present. And this same subtil medium ac∣cording
to it's various quantities, motions, and
determinations, sheweth itself in different effects
or appearances, and is aether, light, or fire.</P>
<P>227. The Particles of aether fly asunder with
the greatest force, therefore when united they
must (according to the Newtonian doctrine) at∣tract
each other with the greatest force; therefore
they are acids<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">130.</NOTE>, or constitute the acid; but
this united with earthy parts maketh alkali, as sir
Isaac teacheth in his tract de acido; alkali, as ap∣pears
<PB N="106" REF="105"/>
in cantharides and lixivial salts, is a caustic;
caustics are fire; therefore acid is fire; therefore
aether is fire; and if fire, light. We are not
therefore obliged to admit a new medium distinct
from light, and of a finer and more exquisite
substance, for the explication of phaenomena,
which appear to be as well explained without
it. How can the density or elasticity of aether
account for the rapid flight of a ray of light from
the Sun, still swifter as it goes farther from the
sun? or how can it account for the various mo∣tions
and attractions of different bodies? Why
oyl and water, mercury and iron repell, or why
other bodies attract each other? or why a parti∣cle
of light should repell on one side and attract
on the other, as in the case of the Islandic cry∣stal?
To explain cohesion by hamate atoms is ac∣counted
ignotum per ignotius. And is it not as
much so to account for the gravity of bodies by
the elasticity of aether?</P>
<P>228. It is one thing to arrive at general laws
of nature from a contemplation of the phaenome∣na;
and another to frame an hypothesis, and
from thence deduce the phaenomena. Those who
supposed epicycles, and by them explained the
motions and appearances of the planets, may not
therefore be thought to have discovered principles
true in fact and nature. And albeit we may from
the premises infer a conclusion, it will not follow,
that we can argue reciprocally, and from the
conclusion infer the premises. For instance,
supposing an elastic fluid, whose constituent mi∣nute
particles are equidistant from each other and
of equal densities and diameters, and recede one
from another with a centrifugal force which is in∣versly
as the distance of the centers, and admit∣ting
that from such supposition it must follow,
<PB N="107" REF="106"/>
that the density and elastic force of such fluid are
in the inverse proportion of the space it occupies
when compressed by any force; yet we cannot re∣ciprocally
infer, that a fluid endued with this pro∣perty
must therefore consist of such supposed equal
particles; for it would then follow, that the con∣stituent
particles of air were of equal densities and
diameters; whereas it is certain, that air is an he∣terogeneous
mass, containing in it's composition
an infinite variety of exhalations, from the dif∣ferent
bodies which make up this terraqueous
globe.</P>
<P>229. The phaenomena of light, animal spirit,
muscular motion, fermentation, vegetation, and
other natural operations, seem to require no∣thing
more than the intellectual and artificial fire
of Heraclitus, Hippocrates, the Stoics<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">166, 168.</NOTE>, and
other antients. Intellect, superadded to aetherial spi∣rit,
fire, or light, moves, and moves regularly,
proceeding, in a method as the Stoics, or increas∣ing
and diminishing by measure, as Heraclitus
expressed it. The Stoics held that Fire compre∣hended
and included the spermatic reasons or forms
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) of all natural things. As the
forms of things have their ideal existence in the
intellect, so it should seem that seminal principles
have their natural existence in the light<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">164.</NOTE>, a me∣dium
consisting of heterogeneous parts, differing
from each other in divers qualities that appear to
sense, and not improbably having many original
properties, attractions, repulsions and motions,
the laws and natures whereof are indiscernible to
us, otherwise than in their remote effects. And
this animated heterogeneous fire should seem a
more adequate cause, whereby to explain the phae∣nomena
<PB N="108" REF="107"/>
of nature, than one uniform aetherial me∣dium.</P>
<P>230. A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stotle indeed excepts against the ele∣ments
being animated. Yet nothing hinders why
that power of the soul, styled by him <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
or locomotive, may not reside therein, under the
direction of an intellect, in such sense and as
properly as it is said to reside in animal bodies.
It must nevertheless be owned, that albeit that
philosopher acknowledgeth a divine force or ener∣gy
in fire, yet to say that fire is alive, or that
having a soul it should not be alive, seem to him
equally absurd. See his second bock, de parti∣bus
animalium.</P>
<P>231. The laws of attraction and repulsion are
to be regarded as laws of motion, and these only
as rules or methods observed in the productions of
natural effects, the efficient and final causes where∣of
are not of mechanical consideration. Certain∣ly,
if the explaining a phaenomenon be to as∣sign
it's proper efficient and final cause<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">154, 155, 160.</NOTE>, it
should seem the mechanical philosophers never
explained any thing; their province being only to
discover the laws of nature, that is the general
rules and methods of motion, and to account for
particular phaenomena by reducing them under,
or shewing their conformity to such general rules.</P>
<P>232. Some corpuscularian philosophers of the
last age, have indeed attempted to explain the for∣mation
of this world and it's phaenomena, by a few
simple laws of mechanism. But if we consider
the various productions of nature, in the mine∣ral,
vegetable and animal parts of the creation,
I believe we shall see cause to affirm, that not any
<PB N="109" REF="108"/>
one of them has hitherto been, or can be account∣ed
for on principles merely mechanical; and that
nothing could be more vain and imaginary, than
to suppose with Descartes, that merely from cir∣cular
motions being impressed by the supreme
agent on the particles of extended substance, the
whole world with all it's several parts, appurte∣nances,
and phaenomena might be produced, by
a necessary consequence from the laws of mo∣tion.</P>
<P>233. Others suppose that God did more at the
beginning, having then made the seeds of all ve∣getables
and animals, containing their solid or∣ganical
parts in miniature, the gradual filling and
evolution of which, by the influx of proper juices,
doth constitute the generation and growth of a
living body. So that the artificial structure of
plants and animals daily generated, requires no
present exercise of art to produce it, having been
already framed at the origin of the world, which
with all it's parts hath ever since subsisted going
like a clock or machine by itself, according to
the laws of nature, without the immediate hand
of the artist. But how can this hypothesis explain
the blended features of different species in mules
and other mongrels? or the parts added or changed,
and sometimes whole limbs lost by marking in
the womb? or how can it account for the resur∣rection
of a tree from it's stump, or the vegeta∣tive
power in it's cuttings? in which cases we must
necessarily conceive something more than the mere
evolution of a seed.</P>
<P>234. Mechanical laws of nature or motion di∣rect
us how to act, and teach us what to expect.
Where intellect presides, there will be method and
order, and therefore rules, which if not stated
<PB N="110" REF="109"/>
and constant would cease to be rules. There is
therefore a constancy in things, which is styled
the course of nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">160.</NOTE>. All the phaenomena in
nature are produced by motion. There appears an
uniform working in things great and small, by
attracting and repelling forces. But the particu∣lar
laws of attraction and repulsion are various.
Nor are we concerned at all about the forces, nei∣ther
can we know or measure them otherwise than
by their effect, that is to say the motions, which
motions only, and not the forces, are indeed in
the bodies<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">155.</NOTE>. Bodies are moved to or from each
other, and this is performed according to different
laws. The natural or mechanic philosopher en∣deavours
to discover those laws by experiment and
reasoning. But what is said of forces residing in
bodies whether attracting or repelling, is to be
regarded only as a mathematical hypothesis, and
not as any thing really existing in nature.</P>
<P>235. We are not therefore seriously to suppose
with certain mechanic philosophers, that the mi∣nute
particles of bodies have real forces or powers
by which they Act on each other, to produce the
various phaenomena in nature. The minute cor∣puscles
are impelled and directed, that is to say,
moved to and from each other according to various
rules or laws of motion. The laws of gravity,
magnetism, and electricity are divers. And it
is not known, what other different rules or laws
of motion might be established, by the author of
nature. Some bodies approach together, others
fly asunder, and perhaps some others do neither.
When salt of tartar flows per deliquium, it is vi∣sible
that the particles of water floating in the air
<PB N="111" REF="110"/>
are moved towards the particles of salt, and joined
with them. And when we behold vulgar salt not
to flow per deliquium, may we not conclude that
the same law of nature and motion doth not ob∣tain
between it's particles and those of the floating
vapours? A drop of water assumes a round figure,
because it's parts are moved towards each other.
But the particles of oil and vinegar have no such
disposition to unite. And when flies walk in wa∣ter
without wetting their feet, it is attributed
to a repelling force or faculty in the fly's feet.
But this is obsure, though the phaenomenon be
plain.</P>
<P>236. It is not improbable, and seems not un∣supported
by experiments, that, as in algebra,
where positive quantities cease there negative begin,
even so in mechanics, where attracting forces cease
there repelling forces begin: or (to express it more
properly) where bodies cease to be moved towards,
they begin to be moved from each other. This
sir Isaac Newton infers from the production of air
and vapours, whose particles fly asunder with such
vehement force. We behold iron move towards
the loadstone, straws towards amber, heavy bodies
towards the earth. The laws of these motions are
various. And when it is said, that all the motions
and changes in the great world arise from attraction;
the elacticity of the air, the motion of water, the
descent of heavy, and the ascent of light bodies,
being all ascribed to the same principle; when from
insensible attractions of most minute particles at
the smallest distance, are derived cohefion, disso∣lution,
coagulation, animal secretion, fermenta∣tion,
and all chemical operations; and when it is
said, that with out such principles there never would
have been any motion in the world, and without
<PB N="112" REF="111"/>
the continuance thereof all motion would cease. In
all this we know or understand no more, than
that bodies are moved according to a certain order,
and that they do not move themselves,</P>
<P>237. So likewise, how to explain all those vari∣ous
motions and effects, by the density and elasti∣city
of aether, seems incomprehensible<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">153, 162.</NOTE>. For
instance, why should the acid particles draw those
of water and repell each other? why should some
salts attract vapours in the air, and others not?
why should the particles of common salt repell
each other, so as not to subside in water? why
should the most repellent particles be the most at∣tractive
upon contact? Or why should the re∣pellent
begin where the attractive faculty leaves
off. These, and numberless other effects seen in∣explicable
on mechanical principles, or otherwise
than by recourse to a mind or spiritual agent<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">154, 220.</NOTE>. Nor will it suffice from present phaenomena and
effects, through a chain of natural causes, and
subordinate blind agents, to trace a divine in∣tellect
as the remote original cause, that first crea∣ted
the world, and then set it a going. We can∣not
make even one single step in accounting for
the phaenomena, without admitting the immedi∣ate
presence and immediate action of an incorpo∣real
agent, who connects, moves, and disposes
all things, according to such rules, and for such
purposes as seem good to him.</P>
<P>238. It is an old opinion adopted by the moderns,
that the elements and other natural bodies are
changed each into other<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">148.</NOTE>. Now, as the particles
of different bodies are agitated by di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ferent forces,
attracting and repelling, or, to speak more accurate∣ly,
are moved by different laws, how can these forces
<PB N="113" REF="112"/>
or laws be changed, and this change accounted for
by an elastic aether? Such a medium distinct from
light or fire seemeth not to be made out by an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
proof, nor to be of any use in explaining the
phaenomena. But if there be any medium em∣ployed,
as a subordinate cause or instrument in
attraction, it would rather seem to be light<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">152, 156.</NOTE>;
since by an experiment of Mr. Boyle's, amber, that
shewed no sign of attraction in the shade, being
placed where the sun-beams shone upon it, imme∣diately
attracted light bodies. Besides, it hath been
discovered by sir Isaac Newton, and an admirable
discovery it was, that light is an heterogeneous me∣dium
<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">40, 181.</NOTE> consisting of particles endued with ori∣ginal
distinct properties. And upon these, if I may
venture to give my conjectures, it seemeth probable
the specific properties of bodies, and the force of
specific medicines may depend. Different sides of
the same ray shall, one approach and the other re∣cede
from the Islandic Crystal; can this be account∣ed
for by the elasticity of a fine medium, or by the
general laws of motion, or by any mechanical prin∣ciples
whatever? And if not, what should hinder
but there may be specific medicines, whose opera∣tion
depends not upon mechanical principles, how
much soever that notion hath been exploded of late
years?</P>
<P>239. Why may we not suppose certain idiosyn∣crasies,
sympathies, oppositions, in the solids or
fluids or animal spirit of a human body, with re∣gard
to the fine insensible parts of minerals or ve∣getables,
impregnated by rays of light of different
properties, not depending on the different size,
figure, number, solidity or weight of those particles,
<PB N="114" REF="113"/>
nor on the general laws of motion, nor on the den∣sity
or elasticity of a medium, but merely and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
together on the good pleasure of the Creator, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
original formation of things? From whence diver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
unaccountable and unforeseen motions may arise i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the animal oeconomy; from whence also variou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
peculiar and specific virtues may be conceived t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
arise, residing in certain medicines, and not to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
explained by mechanical principles. For althoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the general known laws of motion are to be deem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
mechanical, yet peculiar motions of the insensibl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
parts, and peculiar properties depending thereon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
are occult and specific.</P>
<P>240. The words attraction and repulsion may, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
compliance with custom, be used where, accurately
speaking, motion alone is meant. And in that sense
it may be said, that peculiar attractions or repulsion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in the parts, are attended with specific properties i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the wholes. The particles of light are vehement∣ly
moved to or from, retained or rejected by objects.
Which is the same thing as to say with sir Isaac
Newton, that the particles of acids are endued with
great attractive force<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">202.</NOTE>, wherein their activity
consists; whence fermentation and dissolution; and
that the most repellent are, upon contact, the most
attracting particles.</P>
<P>241. Gravity and fermentation are received for
two most extensive principles. From fermentation
are derived the motion and warmth of the hear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and blood in animals, subterraneous heat, fires, and
earthquakes, meteors and changes in the atmo∣sphere.
And, that attracting and repelling force<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
operate in the nutrition and dissolution or animal
and vegetable bodies, is the doctrine both of Hip∣pocrates
<PB N="115" REF="114"/>
and sir Isaac Newton. The former of
these celebrated authors, in his treatise concerning
diet or regimen, observes, that in the nourishment
of man, one part repells and another attracts.
And again in the same treatise two carpenters,
saith he, saw a piece of timber; one draws, the
other pushes: these two actions tend to one and the
same end, though in a contrary direction, one up,
the other down: This imitates the nature of man:
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>242. It is the general maxim of Hippocrates, that
the manner wherein nature acts consisteth in attract∣ing
what is meet and good, and in repelling
what is disagreeable or hurtful. He makes the
whole of the animal oeconomy to be administred by
the faculties or powers of nature. Nature alone,
saith he, sufficeth for all things to animals. She
knows of herself what is necessary for them.
Whence it is plain, he means a conscious intelligent
nature, that presides and moves the aetherial spi∣rit.
And though he declares all things are accom∣plished
on man by necessity, yet it is not a blind
fate or chain of mere corporeal causes, but a divine
necessity, as he himself expresly calls it. And what
is this but an over-ruling intelligent power that dis∣poseth
of all things?</P>
<P>243. Attraction cannot produce, and in that
sense account for the phaenomena, being itself one
of the phaenomena produced and to be accounted
for<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">160, 235.</NOTE>. Attraction is performed by different laws,
and cannot therefore in all cases be the effect of the
elasticity of one uniform medium. The phaenome∣na
of electrical bodies, the laws and variations of
magnetism, and, not to mention other kinds, even
<PB N="116" REF="115"/>
Gravity, is not explained by elasticity, a phaeno∣menon
not less obscure than itself. But then, al∣though
it shew not the agent, yet it sheweth a rule
and analogy in nature, to say, That the solid parts
of animals are endued with attractive powers, where∣by
from contiguous fluids they draw like to like; and
that glands have peculiar powers attractive of pe∣culiar
juices<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">41.</NOTE>. Nature seems better known and
explained by attractions and repulsions, than by
those other mechanical principles of size, figure, and
the like: that is by sir Isaac Newton, than Des∣cartes.
And natural philosophers excell, as they
are more or less acquainted with the laws and me∣thods
observed by the author of nature.</P>
<P>244. The size and shape of particles and general
laws of motion can never explain the secretions
without the help of attraction, obscure perhaps as
to it's cause, but clear as a law. Numberless in∣stances
of this might be given: Lemery the young∣er
thought himself obliged to suppose, the particles
of light or fire (contrary to all reason) to be of a
very gross kind, even greater than the pores of
the burnt limestone, in order to account for their
being detained or imprisoned therein; but this phae∣nomenon
is easily reduced to attraction. There
would be no end of enumerating the like cases.
The activity and force of aetherial spirit or fire by
the laws of attraction, is imparted to grosser par∣ticles
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">152, 163.</NOTE>, and thereby wonderfully supports the
oeconomy of living bodies. By such peculiar com∣positions
and attractions it seems to be effected,
that denser fluids can pass where air itself cannot,
(as oyl through leather) and therefore th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough
<PB N="117" REF="116"/>
the nicest and finest strainers of an animal or vege∣table.</P>
<P>245. The ancients had some general conception of
attracting and repelling powers<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">241, 242.</NOTE> as natural princi∣ples.
Galilaei had particularly considered the attrac∣tion
of gravity, and made some discovery of the
laws thereof. But sir Isaac Newton by his singu∣lar
penetration, profound knowledge in geometry
and mechanics, and great exactness in experiments,
hath cast a new light on natural science. The laws
of attraction and repulsion were in many instances
discovered, and first discovered, by him. He
shewed their general extent, and therewith as with
a key opened several deep secrets of nature, in the
knowledge whereof he seems to have made a grea∣ter
progress, than all the sects of corpuscularians
together had done before him. Nevertheless, the
principle of attraction itself is not to be explained
by physical or corporeal causes.</P>
<P>246. The Cartesians attempted to explain it
by the ni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us of a subtil element, receding from the
center of its motion, and impelling grosser bodies
towards it. Sir Isaac Newton in his later thoughts
seems (as was before observed) to have adopted
somewhat not altogether foreign from this notion,
ascribing that to his elastic medium<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">237, 238.</NOTE> which Des∣cartes
did to his second element. But the great
men of antiquity resolved gravity into the immediate
action of an intelligent incorporeal being. To which
also sir Isaac Newton himself attests and subscribes,
although he may perhaps sometimes be thought to
forget himself, in his manner of speaking of phy∣sical
agents, which in a strict sense are none at all;
and in supposing real forces to exist in bodies, in
<PB N="118" REF="117"/>
which, to speak truly, attraction and repulsion
should be considered only as tendencies or motions,
that is, as mere effects, and their laws as laws of
motion.</P>
<P>247. Though it be supposed the chief business
of a natural philosopher to trace out causes from
the effects, yet this is to be understood not of
agents<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">155.</NOTE> but of principles, that is, of component
parts, in one sense, or of laws or rules, in another.
In strict truth all agents are incorporeal, and as such
are not properly of physical consideration. The
Astronomer, therefore, the Mechanic, or the Chy∣mist,
not as such, but by accident only, treat of
real causes, agents or efficients. Neither doth it
seem, as is supposed by the greatest of mechanical
philosophers, that the true way of proceeding in
their science is, from known motions in nature to
investigate the moving forces. Forasmuch as force
is neither corporeal, nor belongs to any corporeal
thing<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">220.</NOTE>; nor yet to be discovered by experiments
or mathematical reasonings, which reach no farther
than discernible effects, and motions in things passive
and moved.</P>
<P>248. Vis or force is to the soul, what extension
is to the body, saith Saint Augustin, in his tract
concerning the quantity of the soul; and without
force there is nothing done or made, and consequent∣ly
there can be no agent. Authority is not to de∣cide
in this case. Let any one consult his own no∣tions
and reason, as well as experience, concerning
the origine of motion, and the respective natures,
properties, and differences of soul and body, and he
will, if I mistake not, evidently perceive, that there
is nothing active in the later. Nor are they natural
<PB N="119" REF="118"/>
agents or corporeal forces, which make the parti∣cles
of bodies to cohaere. Nor is it the business of
experimental philosophers to find them out.</P>
<P>249. The mechanical philosopher, as hath been
already observed, inquires properly concerning the
rules and modes of operation alone, and not con∣cerning
the cause, forasmuch as nothing mechanical
is or really can be a cause<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">236, 247.</NOTE>. And although a
mechanical or mathematical philosopher may speak
of absolute space, absolute motion, and of force as
existing in bodies, causing such motion and pro∣portional
thereto; yet what these forces are, which
are supposed to be lodged in bodies, to be impressed
on bodies, to be multiplied, divided, and commu∣nicated
from one body to another, and which seem
to animate bodies like abstract spirits or souls, hath
been found very difficult, not to say impossible, for
thinking men to conceive and explain, as may be
seen by consulting Borellus de vi percussionis, and
Torricelli in his lezioni academiche, among other
authors.</P>
<P>250. Nor, if we consider the proclivity of man∣kind
to realize their notions, will it seem strange
that mechanic philosophers and Geometricians should,
like other men, be misled by prejudice, and take
mathematical hypotheses for real beings existing in
bodies, so far as even to make it the very aim and
end of their science to compute or measure those
phantomes; whereas it is very certain that nothing
in truth can be measured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This subject is handled at large in my Latin tract de motu, published above twenty years ago.</NOTE> or computed, beside the
very effects or motions themselves. Sir Isaac New∣ton
asks, have not the minute particles of bodies
certain forces or powers by which they act on
<PB N="120" REF="119"/>
one another, as well as on the particles of light,
for producing most of the phaenomena in nature?
But in reality, those minute particles are only agi∣tated
according to certain laws of nature, by some
other agent, wherein the force exists and not in
them, which have only the motion; which motion
in the body moved, the Peripatetics rightly judge
to be a mere passion, but in the mover to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
or act.</P>
<P>251. It passeth with many, I know not how,
that mechanical principles give a clear solution of the
phaenomena. The Democritic hypothesis, saith
Doctor Cudworth, doth much more handsomely
and intelligibly solve the phaenomena, than that of
Aristotle and Plato. But things rightly considered,
perhaps it will be found not to solve any phaenome∣non
at all. For all phaenomena are, to speak tru∣ly,
appearances in the soul or mind; and it hath
never been explained, nor can it be explained, how
external bodies, figures and motions should pro∣duce
an appearance in the mind. Those principles,
therefore, do not solve, if by solving is meant assign∣ing
the real, either efficient or final cause of appear∣ances,
but only reduce them to general rules.</P>
<P>252. There is a certain analogy, constancy, and
uniformity in the phaenomena or appearances of na∣ture,
which are a foundation for general rules: and
these are a grammar for the understanding of na∣ture,
or that series of effects in the visible world,
whereby we are enabled to foresee what will come
to pass, in the natural course of things. Plotinus
observes, in his third Ennead, that the art of pre∣saging
is in some sort the reading of natural letters
denoting order, and that so far forth as analogy ob∣tains
in the universe, there may be vaticination.
And in reality, he that foretells the motions of the
<PB N="121" REF="120"/>
planets, or the effects of medicines, or the result,
of chymical or mechanical experiments, may be said
to do it by natural vaticination.</P>
<P>253. We know a thing when we understand it:
and we understand it, when we can interpret or tell
what it signifies. Strictly the sense knows nothing.
We perceive indeed sounds by hearing, and charac∣ters
by sight: but we are not therefore said to un∣derstand
them. After the same manner, the phae∣nomena
of nature are alike visible to all: but all
have not alike learned the connexion of natural
things, or understand what they signify, or know
how to vaticinate by them. There is no question,
saith Socrates, in Theaeteto, concerning that which
is agreeable to each person; but concerning what
will in time to come be agreeable, of which all men
are not equally judges. He who foreknoweth what
will be in every kind, is the wisest. According to
Socrates, you and the cook may judge of a dish on
the table equally well; but while the dish is making,
the cook can better foretell what will ensue from
this or that manner of composing it. Nor is this
manner of reasoning confined only to morals or po∣litics;
but extends also to natural science.</P>
<P>254. As the natural connexion of signs with the
things signified is regular and constant, it forms a
sort of rational discourse<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">152.</NOTE>, and is therefore the
immediate effect of an intelligent cause. This is
agreeable to the philosophy of Plato and other an∣cients.
Plotinus indeed saith, that which acts natu∣rally
is not intellection, but a certain power of mov∣ing
matter, which doth not know but only do.
And it must be owned, that, as faculties are multi∣plied
by philosophers according to their operations,
the will may be distinguished from the intellect.
<PB N="122" REF="121"/>
But it will not therefore follow, that the will, which
operates in the course of nature, is not conducted
and applied by intellect, although it be granted that
neither will understands, nor intellect wills. There∣fore,
the phaenomena of nature, which strike on
the senses and are understood by the mind, do form
not only a magnificent spectacle, but also a most
coherent, entertaining, and instructive discourse;
and to effect this, they are conducted, adjusted, and
ranged by the greatest wisdom. This language or
discourse is studied with different attention, and in∣terpreted
with different degrees of skill. But so far
as men have studied and remarked it's rules, and
can interpret right, so far they may be said to be
knowing in nature. A beast is like a man who
hears a strange tongue, but understands nothing.</P>
<P>255. Nature, saith the learned Doctor Cud∣worth,
is not master of art or wisdom: Nature is
ratio mersa &amp; confusa, reason immersed and plung∣ed
into matter, and as it were fuddled in it and con∣founded
with it. But the formation of plants and
animals, the motions of natural bodies; their vari∣ous
properties, appearances and vicissitudes, in a
word the whole series of things in this visible world,
which we call the course of nature, is so wisely
managed and carried on, that the most improved
human Reason cannot thoroughly comprehend even
the least particle thereof; so far is it from seeming
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> produced by fuddled or confounded reason.</P>
<P>2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Natural productions, it is true, are not all
equal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> perfect. But neither doth it suit with the
order <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings, the structure of the universe, or
the end▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> providence that they should be so.
General <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we have seen<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">24<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>, are necessary to
<PB N="123" REF="122"/>
make the world intelligible: and from the constant
observation of such rules, natural evils will some∣times
unavoidably ensue: things will be produced
in a slow length of time, and arrive at different de∣grees
of perfection.</P>
<P>257. It must be owned, we are not conscious of
the systole and diastole of the heart, or the motion
of the diaphragm. It may not nevertheless be
thence inferred, that unknowing nature can act re∣gularly,
as well as ourselves. The true inference
is, that the self, thinking individual, or humane per∣son,
is not the real author of those natural motions.
And in fact no man blames himself if they are
wrong, or values himself if they are right. The same
may be said of the fingers of a musician, which
some object to be moved by habit which understands
not; it being evident, that what is done by rule
must proceed from something that understands the
rule; therefore, if not from the musician himself,
from some other active intelligence, the same per∣haps
which governs bees and spiders, and moves
the limbs of those who walk in their sleep.</P>
<P>258. Instruments, occasions, and signs<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">160.</NOTE> do
occur in, or rather make up, the whole visible
course of nature. These, being no agents them∣selves,
are under the direction of one agent con∣certing
all for one end, the supreme good. All
those motions, whether in animal bodies or in other
parts of the system of nature, which are not effects
of particular wills, seem to spring from the same
general cause with the vegetation of plants, an
aetherial spirit actuated by a mind.</P>
<P>259. The first Poets and Theologers of Greece
and the East considered the generation of things,
<PB N="124" REF="123"/>
as ascribed rather to a divine cause, but the Physici
to natural causes subordinate to, and directed still
by a divine; except some Corporealists and Me∣chanics,
who vainly pretended to make a world with∣out
a God. The hidden force that unites, adjusts,
and causeth all things to hang together, and move
in harmony, which Orpheus and Empedocles styl∣ed
love; this principle of union is no blind prin∣ciple,
but acts with intellect. This divine love and
intellect are not themselves obvious to our view, or
otherwise discerned than in their effects. Intellect
enlightens, Love connects, and the soveraign Good
attracts all things.</P>
<P>260. All things are made for the supreme good,
all things tend to that end: and we may be said to
account for a thing, when we shew that it is so
best. In the Phaedon, Socrates declares it to be
his opinion, that he, who supposed all things to
have been disposed and ordered by a mind<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">154, 160</NOTE>,
should not pretend to assign any other cause of
them. He blames Physiologers for attempting to
account for phaenomena, particularly for gravity
and cohaesion, by vortexes and aether, overlooking
the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the strongest bond and
cement which holds together all the parts of the
universe, and not discerning the cause it self from
those things which only attend it.</P>
<P>261. As in the microcosm, the constant regular
tenor of the motions of the viscera and contained
juices doth not hinder, particular voluntary motions
to be impressed by the mind on the animal spirit;
even so in the mundane system, the steddy obser∣vance
of certain laws of nature, in the grosser masses
and more conspicuous motions, doth not hinder,
<PB N="125" REF="124"/>
but a voluntary agent may sometimes communicate
particular impressions to the fine aetherial medium,
which in the world answers the animal spirit in man.
Which two (if they are two) although invisible and
inconceivably small, yet seem the real latent springs,
whereby all the parts of this visible world are mov∣ed;
albeit they are not to be regarded as a true cause,
but only an instrument of motion; and the instru∣ment
not as a help to the Creator, but only as a
sign to the creature.</P>
<P>262. Plotinus supposeth that the soul of the uni∣verse
is not the original cause or author of the spe∣cies,
but receives them from Intellect, the true
principle of order and distinction, the source and
giver of forms. Others consider the vegetative soul
only as some lower faculty of a higher soul, which
animates the fiery aetherial spirit<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">178.</NOTE>. As for the
blots and defects which appear in the course of this
world, which some have thought to proceed from
a fatality or necessity in nature, and others from an
evil principle, that same philosopher observes, that
it may be the governing reason produceth and or∣daineth
all those things; and, not intending that all
parts should be equally good, maketh some worse
than others by design, as all parts in an animal are
not eyes: And in a city, comedy, or picture, all
ranks, characters, and colours are not equal or like;
even so excesses, defects, and contrary qualities,
conspire to the beauty and harmony of the world.</P>
<P>263. It cannot be denied, that with respect to
the universe of things, we in this mortal state are
like men educated in Plato's cave, looking on sha∣dows
with our backs turned to the light. But
<PB N="126" REF="125"/>
though our light be dim, and our situation bad,
yet if the best use be made of both, perhaps some∣thing
may be seen. Proclus, in his commentary
on the theology of Plato, observes there are two
sorts of philosophers. The one placed body first in
the order of beings, and made the faculty of think∣ing
depend thereupon, supposing that the principles
of all things are corporeal: that Body most really
or principally exists, and all other things in a secon∣dary
sense, and by virtue that. Others, making all
corporeal things to be dependent upon soul or mind,
think this to exist in the first place and primary
sense, and the being of bodies to be altogether de∣rived
from, and presuppose that of the mind.</P>
<P>264. Sense and experience acquaint us, with the
course and analogy of appearances or natural effects.
Thought, reason, intellect, introduce us into the
knowledge of their causes. Sensible appearances,
though of a flowing, unstable, and uncertain nature,
yet having first occupied the mind, they do by an
early prevention, render the after task of thought
more difficult: and as they amuse the eyes and
ears, and are more suited to vulgar uses and the
mechanic arts of life, they easily obtain a preference,
in the opinion of most men, to those superior prin∣ciples,
which are the later growth of the humane
mind arrived to maturity and perfection, but, not
affecting the corporeal sense, are thought to be so
far deficient in point of solidity and reality, sensible
and real to common apprehensions being the same
thing. Although it be certain, that the principles of
science are neither objects of sense nor imagination;
and that intellect and reason are alone the sure
guides to Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="126"/>
265. The successful curiosity of the present age,
in arts and experiments and new systems, is apt to
elate men, and make them overlook the ancients.
But notwithstanding that the encouragement and
purse of Princes, and the united endeavours of great
societies in these later ages, have extended experi∣mental
and mechanical knowledge very far, yet it
must be owned, that the ancients too were not
ignorant of many things<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">166, 167, 168, 241, 242, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, as well in physics as
metaphysics, which perhaps are more generally,
though not first known in these modern times.</P>
<P>266. The Pythagoreans and Platonists had a no∣tion
of the true system of the world. They allowed
of mechanical principles, but actuated by soul or
mind: they distinguished the primary qualities in
bodies from the secondary, making the former to
be physical causes, and they understood physical
causes in a right sense: they saw that a mind infi∣nite
in power, unextended, invisible, immortal,
governed, connected and contained all things: they
saw there was no such thing as real absolute space:
that mind, soul or spirit, truly and really exists:
that bodies exist only in a secondary and dependent
sense: that the soul is the place of forms: that the
sensible qualities are to be regarded as acts only
in the cause, and as passions in us: they ac∣curately
considered the differences of intellect, ra∣tional
soul, and sensitive soul, with their distinct
acts of intellection, reasoning, and sensation, points
wherein the Cartesians and their followers, who
consider sensation as a mode of thinking, seem to
have failed. They knew there was a subtil aether
pervading the whole mass of corporeal beings,
and which was itself actually moved and directed
<PB N="128" REF="127"/>
by a mind: and that physical causes were only
instruments, or rather marks and signs.</P>
<P>267. Those ancient philosophers understood the
generation of animals to consist, in the unfolding
and distending of the minute imperceptible parts of
pre-existing animalcules, which passeth for a modern
discovery: this they took for the work of nature, but
nature animate and intelligent<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">172.</NOTE>: they understood
that all things were alive and in motion: they sup∣posed
a concord and discord, union and disunion
in particles, some attracting, others repelling each
other: and that those attractions and repulsions, so
various, regular, and useful, could not be account∣ed
for, but by an intelligence presiding and direct∣ing
all particular motions, for the conservation and
benefit of the whole.</P>
<P>268. The Aegyptians, who impersonated nature,
had made her a distinct principle, and even deified
her under the name of Isis. But Osiris was under∣stood
to be mind or reason, chief and sovereign of
all. Osiris, if we may believe Plutarch, was the
first, pure, unmixed and holy principle, not discer∣nible
by the lower faculties; a glympse whereof
like lightening darting forth, irradiates the under∣standing;
with regard to which Plutarch adds, that
Plato and Aristotle termed one part of philosophy
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: to wit, when having soared above com∣mon
mixed objects, and got beyond the precincts
of sense and opinion, they arrive to contemplate
the first and most simple being, free from all mat∣ter
and composition. This is that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
of Plato, which employeth mind alone; which
alone governs the soul. And the soul is that which
immediately informs and animates nature.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="128"/>
269. Although the Aegyptians did symbolically
represent the supreme divinity sitting on a lotus,
and that gesture hath been interpreted to signify,
the most holy and venerable being to be utterly
at rest reposing within himself; yet, for any thing
that appears, this gesture might denote dignity as
well as repose. And it cannot be denied, that
Jamblicus, so knowing in the Aegyptian notions,
taught there was an intellect that proceeded to ge∣neration,
drawing forth the latent powers into
light in the formation of things. Nor was this to
be understood of an external world, subsisting in
real absolute space; For it was a doctrine of those
antient Sages, that Soul was the place of forms,
as may be seen in the twelfth book of the arcane
part of divine wisdom, according to the Aegyptians.
This notion was embraced by divers philosophers
of Greece, who may be supposed to have derived
it from the same source, from whence many of
their other opinions were drawn.</P>
<P>270. The doctrine of real absolute external
space, induced some modern philosophers to con∣clude
it was a part or attribute of God, or that
God himself was space; inasmuch as incommuni∣cable
attributes of the deity appeared to agree
thereto, such as infinity, immutability, indivisi∣bility,
incorporeity, being uncreated, impassive,
without beginning or ending; not considering that
all these negative properties may belong to no∣thing.
For nothing hath no limits, cannot be
moved or changed, or divided, is neither created
nor destroyed. A different way of thinking ap∣pears
in the Hermaic as well as other writings of
the ancients. With regard to absolute space, it is
observed in the Asclepian dialogue; that the
word Space or Place hath by it self no meaning;
and again, that it is impossible to understand what
<PB N="130" REF="129"/>
Space alone or pure Space is. And Plotinus ac∣knowledgeth
no place but soul or mind, expresly
affirming that the soul is not in the world, but the
world in the soul. And farther, the place of the
soul, saith he, is not body, but soul is in mind,
and body in soul. See the third chapter of the
fifth book of the fifth Ennead.</P>
<P>271. Concerning absolute space that phantome
of the mechanic and Geometrical Philosophers<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">250.</NOTE>,
it may suffice to observe, that it is neither per∣ceived
by any sense, nor proved by any reason,
and was accordingly treated by the greatest of the
ancients as a thing merely visionary. From the no∣tion
of absolute space springs that of absolute mo∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our judgment in these matters is not to be over∣born by a presumed evidence of mathematical notions and reasonings, since it is plain, the mathematicians of this age embrace obscure notions, and uncertain opinions, and are puzzled about them, contradicting each other and dis∣puting like other Men: witness their doctrine of Fluxions, about which, within these ten years, I have seen published about twenty tracts and dissertations, whose authors being utterly at variance, and inconsistent with each other, in∣struct by-standers what to think of their pretensions to evidence.</NOTE>;
and in these are ultimately founded the no∣tions
of external existence, independence, neces∣sity,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate. Which fate, the idol of many mo∣derns,
was by old philosophers differently under∣stood,
and in such a sense, as not to destroy the
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of God or man. Parmenides, who
thought all things to be made by necessity or fate,
understood justice and providence to be the same
with fate; which, how fixed and cogent soever
with respect to man, may yet be voluntary with
respect to God. Empedocles declared Fate to be
<PB N="131" REF="130"/>
a cause using principles and elements. Heraclitus
taught that Fate was the general reason that runs
through the whole nature of the universe: which
nature he supposed to be an aethereal body, the
seed of the generation of all things. Plato held
Fate to be the eternal reason or law of nature.
Chrysippus supposed that Fate was a spiritual pow∣er
which disposed the world in order; that it was
the reason and law of those things which are ad∣ministred
by providence.</P>
<P>272. All the forgoing notions of Fate, as re∣presented
by Plutarch, do plainly shew that those
antient philosophers did not mean by Fate a blind,
head-long, unintelligent principle, but an orderly
settled course of things conducted by a wise and
provident mind. And as for the Aegygtian doc∣trine,
it is indeed asserted in the Pimander, that
all Things are produced by Fate. But Jamblichus,
who drew his notions from Aegypt, affirms that
the whole of things is not bound up in Fate; but
that there is a principle of the soul higher than
nature, whereby we may be raised to an union
with the Gods and exempt ourselves from Fate.
And in the Asclepian dialogue it is expresly said
that fate follows the decrees of God. And indeed
as all the motions in nature are evidently the pro∣duct
of reason<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">154.</NOTE>, it should seem there is no room
for necessity, in any other sense than that of a
steady regular course.</P>
<P>273. Blind fate and blind chance are at bottom
much the same thing, and one no more intelligible
than the other. Such is the mutual relation, con∣nection,
motion, and sympathy of the parts of
this world, that they seem as it were animated and
held together by one soul: and such is their har∣mony,
<PB N="132" REF="131"/>
order, and regular course, as sheweth the
soul to be governed and directed by a mind. It
was an opinion of remote antiquity that the world
was an animol<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">153, 172.</NOTE>. If we may trust the Hermaic
writings, the Aegyptians thought all things did par∣take
of Life. This opinion was also so general and
current among the Greeks, that Plutarch asserts all
others held the world to be an animal, and govern∣ed
by providence, except Leucippus, Democritus,
and Epicurus. And although an animal, contain∣ing
all bodies within it self, could not be touched
or sensibly affected from without; yet it is plain
they attributed to it an inward sense and feeling,
as well as appetites and aversions; and that from
all the various tones, actions, and passions of the
universe, they supposed one symphony, one animal
act and life to result.</P>
<P>274. Jamblichus declares the world to be one
animal, in which the parts however distant each
from other, are nevertheless related and connected
by one common nature. And he teacheth, what is
also a received notion of the Pythagoreans and
Platonics that there is no chasm in nature, but a
chain or scale of beings rising by gentle uninter∣rupted
gradations from the lowest to the highest,
each nature being informed and perfected by the
participation of a higher. As air becomes igneous,
so the purest fire becomes animal, and the animal
soul becomes intellectual, which is to be understood
not of the change of one nature into another, but
of the connection of different natures, each lower
nature being, according to those philosophers, as it
were a receptacle or subject for the next above it
to reside and act in.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="132"/>
275. It is also the doctrine of Platonic philo∣sophers,
that intellect is the very life of living
things, the first principle and exemplar of all, from
whence by different degrees are derived the in∣ferior
classes of life; first the rational, then the
sensitive, after that the vegetal, but so as in the
rational animal there is still somewhat intellectual,
again in the sensitive there is somewhat rational,
and in the vegetal somewhat sensitive, and lastly
in mixt bodies, as metals and minerals, somewhat
of vegetation. By which means the whole is
thought to be more perfectly connected. Which
doctrine implies that all the faculties, instincts, and
motions of inferior beings, in their several respec∣tive
subordinations, are derived from, and depend
upon mind and intellect.</P>
<P>276. Both Stoics and Platonics held the world
to be alive, though sometimes it be mentioned as a
sentient animal, sometimes as a plant or vegetable.
But in this, notwithstanding what hath been sur∣mised
by some learned men, there seems to be no
Atheism. For so long as the world is supposed to
be quickened by elementary fire or spirit, which is
it self animated by soul, and directed by under∣standing,
it follows that all parts thereof originally
depend upon, and may be reduced unto, the same
indivisible stem or principle, to wit, a supreme
mind; which is the concurrent doctrine of Pytha∣goraeans,
Platonics, and Stoics.</P>
<P>277. There is according to those philosophers a
life infused throughout all things: the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
an intellectual and artificial fire<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">166, 168, 174, 175, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, an
inward principle, animal spirit, or natural life
producing and forming within as art doth without,
regulating, moderating and reconciling the various
motions qualities and parts of this mundane system.
<PB N="134" REF="133"/>
By virtue of this life the great masses are held
together in their orderly courses, as well as the
minutest particles governed in their natural motions,
according to the several laws of attraction, gravity,
electricity, magnetism, and the rest. It is this
gives instincts, teaches the spider her web, and the
bee her honey. This it is that directs the roots of
plants to draw forth juices from the earth, and the
leaves and cortical vessels to separate and attract
such particles of air, and elementary fire, as suit
their respective natures.</P>
<P>278. Nature seems to be not otherwise distin∣guished
from the anima mundi, than as life is from
soul, and upon the principles of the oldest phi∣losophers,
may not improperly or incongruously be
styled the Life of the world. Some Platonics in∣deed,
regard life as the act of nature, in like man∣ner
as intellection is of the mind or intellect. As
the first intellect acts by understanding, so natu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
according to them acts or generates by living. But
life is the act of the soul, and seems to be very
nature it self, which is not the principle, but the
result of another and higher principle, being a life
resulting from soul, as cogitation from intellect.</P>
<P>279 If nature be the life of the world, anima∣mated
by one soul, compacted into one frame,
and directed or governed in all parts by one mind;
This system cannot be accused of Atheism; though
perhaps it may of mistake or impropriety. And
yet, as one presiding mind gives unity to the infi∣nite
aggregate of things, by a mutual communion
of actions and passions, and an adjustment of
parts, causing all to concur in one view to one and
the same end, the ultimate and supreme good of
the whole, it should seem reasonable to say, with
Ocellus Lucanus the Pythagoraean, that as life
holds together the bodies of animals, the cause
<PB N="135" REF="134"/>
whereof is the soul; and as a city is held together
by concord, the cause whereof is law; even so
the world is held together by harmony, the cause
whereof is God. And in this sense, the world or
universe may be considered either as one animal<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">172, 277.</NOTE>
or one city.</P>
<P>280. Aristotle disapproves the opinion of those
who hold a soul to be diffused throughout the
world; and for this reason, because the elements
are not alive. Though perhaps it may not be easy to
prove, that blood and animal spirit are more alive in
man, than water and fire in the world. That Phi∣losopher,
in his books of the Soul, remarks upon
an opinion set forth in the Orphics, of the Soul's
entering from the universe into living creatures be∣ing
born by winds, that this cannot be true of plants or of
certain animals which do not breath.
But air vessels are by later experiments allowed to
be found in all plants and animals. And air may
in some sort not improperly be said, to be the car∣rier
or vehicle of the soul, inasmuch as it is the ve∣hicle
of fire, which is the spirit immediately moved
and animated by the soul<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">163, 171.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>281. The living fire, the living omniform semi∣nary
of the world, and other expressions of the
like nature occuring in the ancient and Platonic
Philosophy, how can they be understood exclu∣sive
of light or elemental fire, the particles of
which are known to be heterogeneous, and, for
ought we know, may some of them be organized,
and, notwithstanding their wonderful minuteness,
contain original seeds which, being formed and
sown in a proper matrix, do gradually unfold and
manifest themselves, still growing to a just propor∣tion
of the species.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="135"/>
282. May not this aethereal seminary, con∣sistently
with the notions of that philosophy, which
ascribed much of generation to celestial influence,
be supposed to impregnate plants and animals with
the first principles, the stamina, or those animal-cules
which Plato, in his Timaeus, saith are invi∣sible
for their smallness, but, being sown in a pro∣per
matrix, are therein gradually distended and ex∣plicated
by nourishment, and at length the animals
brought forth to light. Which notion hath been
revived and received of late years by many, who
perhaps are not aware of it's antiquity, or that it
was to be found in Plato. Timaeus Locrensis in
his book of the soul of the world, supposeth even
souls to be derived from the caelestial luminaries,
excepting only the rational or intellectual part.
But what influence or influx is there from the
caelestial bodies, which hath not light for it's ve∣hicle<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">43.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>283. What other nature there should be in∣termediate
between the soul of the world<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">171.</NOTE> and
this gross corporeal system, which might be the
vehicle of life, or, to use the language of philoso∣phers,
might receive or be impressed with the
forms of things, is difficult to comprehend. It is
a vulgar remark, that the works of art do not
bear a nice microscopical inspection, but the more
helps are used, and the more nicely you pry into
natural productions, the more do you discover
of the fine mechanism of nature, which is endless
or inexhaustible; new and other parts, more sub∣tile
and delicate than the precedent, still continu∣ing
to offer themselves to view. And these mi∣croscopical
observations have confirmed the ancient
theory concerning generation, delivered in the
Timaeus of Plato. But that theory or hypothesis,
<PB N="137" REF="136"/>
how agreeable soever to modern discoveries, is not
alone sufficient to explain the phaenomena, without
the immediate action of a mind. And Ficinus,
notwithstanding what himself and other Platonics
say of a plastic nature, is obliged to own, that
with the mundane force or soul it is to be under∣stood,
there is joined an intelligence, upon which
the seminal nature constantly depends, and by
which it is governed.</P>
<P>284. Alcinous in his tract of the doctrine of
Plato saith that God hath given the world both
mind and soul: others include both in the word
soul, and suppose the soul of the world to be God.
Philo appears to be of this opinion in several parts
of his writings. And Virgil, who was no stranger
to the Pythagoraean and Platonic tenets writes to
the same purpose.</P>
<Q><L>Deum namque ire per omnes</L>
<L>Terras que tractusque maris coelumque
pro∣fundum.</L>
<L>Hinc pecudes armenta, viros, genus omne fe∣rarum</L></Q>
<P>Quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas.
Thus much the schools of Plato and Pythagoras
seem agreed in, to wit, that the soul of the world
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">153, 172.</NOTE>, whether having a distinct mind of its own,
or directed by a superior mind<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">154, 279.</NOTE>, doth embrace
all it's parts, connect them by an invisible and in∣dissoluble
chain, and preserve them ever well ad∣justed
and in good order.</P>
<P>285. Naturalists, whose proper province it is
to consider phaenomena, experiments, mechanical
organs and motions, do principally regard the
visible frame of things or corporeal world, suppo∣sing
soul to be contained in body. And this
hypothesis may be tolerated in physics, as it is not
<PB N="138" REF="137"/>
necessary in the arts of dyalling or navigation to
mention the true system or earth's motion. But
those who, not content with sensible appearances,
would penetrate into the real and true causes (the
object of theology, metaphysics, or the philoso∣phia
prima) will rectify this errour, and speak
of the world as contained by the soul, and not the
soul by the world.</P>
<P>286. Aristotle hath observed there were in∣deed
some who thought so grosly, as to suppose
the universe to be one only corporeal and extend∣ed
nature: but in the first Book of his metaphy∣sics
he justly remarks they were guilty of a great
mistake; forasmuch as they took into their ac∣count
the elements of corporeal beings alone;
whereas there are incorporeal beings also in the
universe; and while they attempted to assign the
causes of generation and corruption, and account
for the nature of all things, they did at the same
time destroy the very cause of motion.</P>
<P>287. It is a doctrine among other speculations
contained in the Hermatic writings, that all things
are one. And it is not improbable that Orp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eus,
Parmenides, and others among the Greeks, might
have derived their notion of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> from Aegypt.
Though that subtil metaphysician Parmenides, in
his doctrine of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> seems to have added some∣thing
of his own. If we suppose, that one and the
same mind is the universal principle of order and
harmony throughout the world, containing and
connecting all it's parts, and giving unity to the
system, there seems to be nothing atheistical or
impious in this supposition.</P>
<P>288. Number is no object of sense: it is an
act of the mind. The same thing in a different
conception is one or many. Comprehending God
and the creatures in one general notion, we may
<PB N="139" REF="138"/>
say that all things together make one universe, or
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> But if we should say, that all things make
one God; this would, indeed, be an erroneous no∣tion
of God, but would not amount to Atheism,
so long as mind or interlect was admitted to be
the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the governing part. It is ne∣vertheless
more respectful, and consequently the
truer notion of God, to suppose him neither made
up of parts, nor to be himself a part of any
whole whatsoever.</P>
<P>289. All those, who conceived the universe to
be an animal, must in consequence of that notion,
suppose all things to be one. But to conceive God
to be the sentient Soul of an animal, is altoge∣ther
unworthy and absurd. There is no sense,
nor sensory, nor any thing like a sense or senso∣ry
in God. Sense implies an impression from
some other being, and denotes a dependence in the
Soul which hath it. Sense is a passion: and passions
imply imperfection. God knoweth all things, as
pure mind or intellect, but nothing by sense, nor
in nor through a sensory. Therefore to suppose
a sensory of any kind, whether space or any
other, in God would be very wrong, and lead us
into false conceptions of this nature. The presum∣ing
there was such a thing as real absolute uncrea∣ted
space, seems to have occasioned that mo∣dern
mistake. But this presumption was without
grounds.</P>
<P>290. Body is opposite to spirit or mind. We
have a notion of spirit from thought and action.
We have a notion of body from resistance. So
far forth as there is real power, there is spirit.
So far forth as there is resistance, there is inability
or want of power. That is, there is a negation of
spirit. We are embodied, that is, we are clogged
by weight, and hindered by resistance. But in
<PB N="140" REF="139"/>
respect of a perfect spirit, there is nothing hard
or impenetrable: there is no resistance to the de∣ity:
Nor hath he any body: Nor is the supreme
being united to the world, as the soul of an animal
is to it's body, which necessarily implieth defect,
both as an instrument and as a constant weight
and impediment.</P>
<P>291. Thus much it consists with piety to say,
that a divine agent doth by his virtue permeate
and govern the elementary fire or light,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">157, 172.</NOTE>
which serves as an animal spirit to enliven and
actuate the whole mass, and all the members of
this visible world. Nor is this doctrine less philo∣sophical
than pious. We see all nature alive or in
motion. We see water turned into air, and air ra∣refied
and made elastic<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">149, 152, 200.</NOTE> by the attraction of
another medium, more pure indeed, more subtil
and more volatile than air. But still, as this is a
moveable extended and, consequently, a corpo∣real
being,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">207.</NOTE> it cannot be it self the principle
of motion, but leads us naturally and necessarily
to an incorporeal spirit or agent. We are con∣scious
that a spirit can begin, alter, or determine
motion, but nothing of this appears in body. Nay
the contrary is evident, both to experiment and
reflection.</P>
<P>292. Natural phaenomena are only natural ap∣pearances.
They are, therefore, such as we see
and perceive them. Their real and objective na∣tures
are, therefore, the same; passive without any
thing active, fluent and changing without any
thing permanent in them. However, as these
make the first impressions, and the mind takes her
first flight and spring, as it were, by resting her
foot on these objects, they are not only first consi∣dered
by all men, but most considered by most
<PB N="141" REF="140"/>
men. They and the phantomes that result from
those appearances, the children of imagination
grafted upon sense, such for example as pure space
<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">270.</NOTE> are thought by many the very first in exi∣stence
and stability, and to embrace and compre∣hend
all other beings.</P>
<P>293. Now although such phantomes as corpo∣real
forces, absolute motions, and real spaces, do
pass in physicks for causes and principles<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">220, 249, 250.</NOTE>, yet
are they in truth but hypotheses, nor can they be
objects of real science. They pass nevertheless in
physics conversant about things of sense, and
confined to experiments and mechanics. But when
we enter the province of the philosophia prima,
we discover another order of beings, mind and it's
acts, permanent being, not depending on corpo∣real
things, nor resulting, nor connected, nor
contained; but containing, connecting, enlivening
the whole frame; and imparting those motions,
forms, qualities, and that order and symmetry to
all those transient phaenomena, which we term
the course of nature.</P>
<P>294. It is with our faculties as with our affe∣ctions:
what first seises, holds fast<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">264.</NOTE>. It is a
vulgar theme, that man is a compound of con∣trarieties,
which breed a restless struggle in his
nature, between flesh and spirit, the beast and the
angel, earth and heaven, ever weighed down and
ever bearing up. During which confflct the cha∣racter
fluctuates: when either side prevails, it is
then fixed for vice or virtue. And life from dif∣ferent
principles takes a different issue. It is the
same in regard to our faculties. Sense at first besets
and overbears the mind. The sensible appearan∣ces
are all in all, our reasoning are employed
about them: our desires terminate in them: we

look no farther for realities or causes; till intellect
begins to dawn, and cast a ray on this shadowy
scene. We then perceive the true principle of unity,
identity, and existence. Those things that before
seemed to constitute the whole of being, upon
taking an intellectual view of things, prove to be
but fleeting phantomes.</P>
<P>295. From the outward form of gross masses
which occupy the vulgar, a curious inquirer pro∣ceeds
to examine the inward structure and minute
parts, and from observing the motions in nature,
to discover the laws of those motions. By the
way, he frames his hypothesis and suits his Lan∣guage
to this natural philosophy. And these fit
the occasion and answer the end of a maker of
experiments or mechanic, who means only to ap∣ply
the powers of nature, and reduce the phaeno∣mena
to rules But, if proceeding still in his ana∣lysis
and inquiry, he ascends from the sensible into
the intellectual world, and beholds things in a new
light and a new order, he will then change his sy∣stem
and perceive, that what he took for substan∣ces
and causes are but fleeting shadows; that the
mind contains all, and acts all, and is to all crea∣ted
beings the source of unity and identity, har∣mony
and order, existence and stability.</P>
<P>296. It is neither acid, nor salt, nor sulphur,
nor air, nor aether, nor visible corporeal fire<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">155.</NOTE>,
much less the phantome fate, or necessity, that is
the real agent, but by a certain analysis, a regular
connection and climax, we ascend through all those
mediums to a glympse of the first mover, invisible,
incorporeal, unextended source of life and being.
There is, it must be owned, a mixture of obscuri∣ty
and prejudice in humane speech and reasonings.
This is unavoidable, since the veils of prejudice
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
and errour are slowly and singly taken off one by
one. But if there are many links in the chain
which connects the two extremes of what is grosly
sensible and purely intelligible, and it seem a tedi∣ous
work, by the slow helps of memory, imagi∣nation,
and reason, oppressed and overwhelmed,
as we are, by the senses, through erroneous prin∣ciples
and long ambages of words and notions, to
struggle upwards into the light of Truth, yet as
this gradually dawns, further discoveries still cor∣rect
the style and clear up the notions.</P>
<P>297. The mind, her acts and faculties, furnish
a new and distinct class of objects<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">163, 266.</NOTE>, from the
contemplation whereof arise certain other notions,
principles, and verities, so remote from, and even
so repugnant to, the first prejudices which surprise
the sense of mankind, that they may well be ex∣cluded
from vulgar speech and books, as abstract
from sensible matters, and more fit for the specu∣lation
of Truth, the labour and aim of a few, than
for the practice of the world, or the subjects of
experimental or mechanical inquiry. Nevertheless
though, perhaps, it may not be relished by some
modern readers, yet the treating in physical books
concerning metaphysical and divine matters can be
justified by great authorities among the ancients;
not to mention, that he, who professedly delivers
the elements of a science, is more obliged to me∣thod
and system, and tied down to more rigorous
laws, than a mere essay writer. It may, there∣fore,
be pardoned if this rude essay doth, by in∣sensible
transitions, draw the reader into remote
inquiries and speculations, that were not thought
of, either by him or by the Author, at first set∣ting
out.</P>

298. There are traces of profound thought a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well as
primaeval tradition in the Platonic, Pytha∣gorean,
Aegyptian, and Chaldaic philosophy<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">179, 266.</NOTE>▪
Men in those early days were not overlaid with
languages and literature. Their minds seem to
have been more exercised, and less burthened▪
than in later ages; and, as so much nearer the
beginning of the world, to have had the advantage
of patriarchal lights handed down thro' a few hands.
It cannot be affirmed indeed (how probable soever
it may seem) that Moses was that same Mochus,
with whose successors, priests and prophets, Py∣thagoras
is said to have conversed at Sidon. Yet
the study of philosophy appears to be of very
great antiquity and remote original; inasmuch as
Timaeus Locrensis, that ancient Pythagoraean, au∣thor
of the book concerning the soul of the world,
speaks of a most ancient philosophy, even in his
time, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, stirring up and reco∣vering
the soul from a state of ignorance to the
contemplation of divine things. And though the
books attributed to Mercurious Trismegistus were
none of them wrote by him, and are allowed to
contain some manifest forgeries; yet it is al∣so
allowed, that they contain tenets of the ancient
Aegyptian philosophy, though dressed perhaps in a
more modern garb. To account for which,
Jamblichus observes, that the books under his
name contain indeed mercurial opinions, though
often expressed in the style of the Greek Philoso∣phers;
as having been translated from the Aegyp∣tian
tongue into Greek.</P>
<P>299. The difference of Isis from Osiris<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">268.</NOTE>
resembles that of the moon from the sun, of the
female from the male, of natura naturata (as the
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
schoolmen speak) from natura naturans. But Isis,
though mostly taken for nature, yet (as the Pagan
divinities were very fluctuating things) it some∣times
signified <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And we find in Mount∣faucon
an Isis of the ordinary form with this In∣scription
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And in the mensa Isiaca, which
seems to exhibit a general system of the religion
and superstition of the Aegyptians, Isis on her
throne possesseth the center of the table. Which
may seem to signify, that the universe or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
was the center of the ancient secret religion of the
Aegyptians; their Isis or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> comprehending both
Osiris the author of nature and his work.</P>
<P>300. Plato and Aristotle considered God as ab∣stracted
or distinct from the natural world. But
the Aegyptians considered God and nature as ma∣king
one whole, or all things together as making
one universe. In doing which they did not exclude
the intelligent mind, but considered it as contain∣ing
all things. Therefore, whatever was wrong in
their way of thinking, it doth not, nevertheless,
imply or lead to Atheism.</P>
<P>301. The humane mind is so much clogged and
born downward, by the strong and early impres∣sions
of sense<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">264.</NOTE>, that it is wonderful, how the
antients should have made even such a progress,
and seen so far into intellectual matters, without
some glimmering of a divine tradition. Whoever
considers a parcel of rude Savages left to them∣selves,
how they are sunk and swallowed up in
sense and prejudice, and how unqualified by their
natural force to emerge from this state, will be apt
to think that the first spark of philosophy was de∣rived
from Heaven; and that it was (as a Heathen
writer expresseth it) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="147"/>
302. The lapsed state of Human kind is a thing
to which the ancient Philosophers were not strang∣ers.
The <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> shew that
the Aegyptians and Pythagoreans, the Platonists
and Stoics, had all some Notion of this doctrine,
the outlines of which seem to have been sketched
out in those tenets. Theology and philosophy
gently unbind the ligaments, that chain the soul
down to the earth, and assist her flight towards the
sovereign Good. There is an instinct or tenden∣cy
of the mind upwards, which sheweth a natural
endeavour to recover and raise ourselves, from our
present sensual and low condition, into a state of
light, order, and purity.</P>
<P>303. The perceptions of sense are gross: but
even in the senses there is a difference. Though
harmony and proportion are not objects of sense,
yet the eye and the ear are organs, which offer to
the mind such materials, by means whereof she
may apprehend both the one and the other. By
experiments of sense we become acquainted with
the lower faculties of the soul; and from them,
whether by a gradual<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">275.</NOTE> evolution or ascent, we
arrive at the highest. Sense supplies images to me∣mory.
These become subjects for fancy to work
upon. Reason considers and judges of the imagi∣nations.
And these acts of reason become new ob∣jects
to the understanding. In this scale, each
lower faculty is a step that leads to one above it.
And the uppermost naturally leads to the Deity,
which is rather the object of intellectual knowledge
than even of the discursive faculty, not to mention
the sensitive. There runs a chain throughout the
whole system of beings. In this chain one link
drags another. The meanest things are connected
with the highest. The calamity therefore is neither
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
strange nor much to be complained of, if a low
sensual reader shall, from mere love of the animal
life, find himself drawn on, surprised, and betray'd
into some curiosity concerning the intellectual.</P>
<P>304. There is according to Plato properly no
knowledge, but only opinion concerning things
sensible and perishing<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">263, 264.</NOTE>, not because they are
naturally abstruse and involved in darkness: but
because their nature and existence is uncertain, ever
fleeting and changing. Or rather, because they do
not in strict truth exist at all, being always gene∣rating
or in fieri, that is, in a perpetual flux, with∣out
any thing stable or permanent in them to con∣stitute
an object of real science. The Pythagore∣ans
and Platonics distinguish between <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that which is ever generated and that
which exists. Sensible things and corporeal forms
are perpetually producing and perishing, appearing
and disappearing, never resting in one state, but
always in motion and change; and therefore in
effect, not one being but a succession of beings▪
while <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is understood to be somewhat of an
abstract or spiritual nature, and the proper object
of intellectual knowledge. Therefore as there can
be no knowledge of things flowing and instable, the
opinion of Protagoras and Theaetetus, that sense
was science, is absurd. And indeed nothing is
more evident, than that the apparent sizes and
shapes, for instance, of things are in a constant
flux, ever differing as they are view'd at different
distances, or with glasses more or less accurate. As
for those absolute magnitudes and figures, which
certain Cartesians and other moderns suppose to be
in things, that must seem a vain supposition, to
whover considers, it is supported by no argument
of Reason, and no experiment of sense.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="149"/>
305. As Understanding perceiveth not, that is,
doth not hear or see or feel, so sense knoweth not:
And although the mind may use both sense and
phancy, as means whereby to arrive at knowledge,
yet sense or soul, so far forth as sensitive, knoweth
nothing. For, as it is rightly observed in the
Theaetetus of Plato, science consists not in the
passive perceptions, but in the reasoning upon
them, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>306. In the ancient philosophy of Plato and
Pythagoras, we find distinguished three sorts of
objects: In the first place a form or species that is
neither generated nor destroyed, unchangeable, in∣visible,
and altogether imperceptible to sense, be∣ing
only understood by the intellect. A second
sort there is ever fluent and changing<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">292, 293.</NOTE>, genera∣ting
and perishing, appearing and vanishing. This
is comprehended by sense and opinion. The third
kind is matter which, as Plato teacheth, being
neither an object of understanding nor of sense,
is hardly to be made out by a certain spurious way
of reasoning <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. See his
Timaeus The same doctrine is contained in the
Pythagoric treatise de anima mundi, which dis∣tinguishing
ideas, sensible things, and matter, ma∣keth
the first to be apprehended by intellect, the
second by sense, and the last, to wit, matter,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> whereof Themistius the Peripatetic
assigns the reason. For, saith he, that act is to be
esteemed spurious, whose object hath nothing posi∣tive,
being only a mere privation, as silence or
darkness. And such he accounteth matter.</P>
<P>307. Aristotle maketh a threefold distinction of
objects according to the three speculative sciences.
Physics he supposeth to be conversant about such
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
things as have a principle of motion in themselves,
mathematics about things permanent but not ab∣stracted,
and theology about being abstracted and
immoveable, which distinction may be seen in the
ninth book of his metaphysics. Where by ab∣stracted,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, he understands seperable from
corporeal beings and sensible qualities.</P>
<P>308. That philosopher held that the mind of
man was a tabula rasa, and that there were no
innate ideas. Plato, on the contray, held original
ideas in the mind, that is, notions which never
were or can be in the sense, such as being, beauty,
goodness, likeness, parity. Some perhaps may
think the truth to be this: that there are proper∣ly
no ideas or passive objects in the mind, but
what what were derived from sense: but that there
are also besides these her own acts or operations:
such are notions.</P>
<P>309. It is a maxim of the Platonic philosophy,
that the soul of Man was originally furnished with
native inbred notions, and stands in need of sen∣sible
occasions, not absolutely for producing them,
but only for awakening, rousing or exciting, into
act what was already preexistent, dormant, and
latent in the soul; as things are said to be laid up
in the memory, though not actually perceived,
untill they happen to be called forth and brought
into view by other objects. This notion seemeth
somewhat different from that of innate ideas, as
understood by those moderns who have atempted
to explode them. To understand and to be, are
according to Parmenides the same thing. And
Plato in his seventh letter makes no difference be∣tween
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, mind and knowledge.
Whence it follows that mind, knowledge, and
notions, either in habit or in act, always go to∣gether.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151"/>
310. And albeit Aristotle considered the soul
in it's original state as a blank paper, yet he held
it to be the proper place of forms, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">269.</NOTE>.
Which doctrine first main∣tained
by others he admits, under this restriction,
that it is not to be understood of the whole soul
but only of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; as is to be seen in his
third book de anima. Whence, according to The∣mistius
in his commentary on that treatise, it may
be inferred that all beings are in the soul. For,
saith he, the forms are the beings. By the Form
every thing is what it is. And he adds, it is the
soul that imparteth forms to matter; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Therefore they are first
in the soul. He further adds, that the mind is all
things, taking the forms of all things it becomes
all things by intellect and sense. Alexander
Aphrodisaeus saith as much, affirming the mind to
be all things <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And
this in fact is Aristotle's own doctrine in his third
book de anima, where he also asserts, with Plato,
that actual knowledge and the thing known are all
one. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Whence it follows that the things are
where the knowledge is, that is to say in the mind.
Or, as it is otherwise expressed, that the soul is all
things. More might be said to explain Aristotle's
notion, but it would lead too far.</P>
<P>311. As to an absolute actual existence<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">264, 292, 294.</NOTE> of
sensible or corporeal things, it doth not seem to
have been admitted either by Plato or Aristotle.
In the Theaetetus we are told, that if any one
saith a thing is or is made, he must withal say,
for what, or of what, or in respect of what, it is
or is made; for, that any thing should exist in it
self or absolutely, is absurd. Agreeably to which
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
doctrine it is also farther affirmed by Plato, that
it is impossible a thing should be sweet,
and sweet to no body. It must nevertheless be owned with
regard to Aristotle, that, even in his metaphysics
there are some expressions which seem to favour
the absolute existence of corporeal things. For
instance, in the eleventh book speaking of cor∣poreal
sensible things, what wonder, saith he, if
they never appear to us the same, no more than
to sick men, since we are always changing, and
never remain the same our selves? and again, he
saith, sensible things, although they receive no
change in themselves, do nevertheless in sick per∣sons
produce different sensations and not the same.
These passages would seem to imply a distinct and
absolute existence of the objects of sense.</P>
<P>312. But it must be observed, that Aristotle
distinguisheth a twofold existence potential and
actual. It will not, therefore, follow that, ac∣cording
to Aristotle, because a thing is, it must
actually exist. This is evident from the eighth
book of his metaphysics, where he animadverts
on the Megaric philosophers, as not admitting a
possible existence distinct from the actual: from
whence, saith he, it must follow, that there is no∣thing
cold or hot or sweet or any sensible thing
at all, where there is no perception. He adds,
that in consequence of that Megaric doctrine, we
can have no sense but while we actually exert it:
we are blind when we do not see, and therefore
both blind and deaf several times in a day.</P>
<P>313. The <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the Peripatetics,
that is, the sciences, arts and habits, were by
them distinguished from the arts or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and supposed to exist in the mind,
though not exerted or put into act. This seems to
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
illustrate the manner in which Socrates, Plato, and
their followers conceived innate<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">309.</NOTE> notions to be
in the soul of man. It was the Platonic doctrine,
that humane souls or minds descended from above,
and were sowed in generation, that they were stun∣ned,
stupified, and intoxicated by this descent and
immersion into animal nature. And that the soul,
in this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or slumber, forgets her original
notions, which are smothered and oppressed by
many false tenets and prejudices of sense. Inso∣much
that Proclus compares the soul, in her des∣cent
invested with growing prejudices, to Glaucus
diving to the bottom of the sea, and there con∣tracting
divers coats of sea weed, coral, and shells,
which stick close to him and conceal his true
shape.</P>
<P>314. Hence, according to this philosophy, the
mind of man is so restless to shake off that slum∣ber,
to disengage and emancipate herself from
those prejudices and false opinions, that so straitly
beset and cling to her, to rub off those covers, that
disguise her original form, and to regain her primae∣val
state and first notions: Hence, that perpetu∣al
struggle to recover the lost region of light, that
ardent thirst and endeavour after truth and intel∣lectual
ideas, which she would neither seek to at∣tain,
nor rejoice in, nor know when attained, ex∣cept
she had some praenotion or anticipation of
them, and they had lain innate and dormant like
habits and sciences in the mind, or things laid up,
which are called out and roused by recollection or
reminiscence. So that learning seemeth in effect
reminiscence.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154"/>
315. The Peripateticks themselves distinguish
between reminiscence and mere memory. The∣mistius
observes that commonly the best memories
go with the worst parts; but that reminiscence is
most perfect in the most ingenious minds. And
notwithstanding the tabula rasa<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">308.</NOTE> of Aristotle,
yet some of his followers have undertaken to make
him speak Plato's sense. Thus Plutarch the Peri∣patetic
teacheth as agreeable to his master's doc∣trine,
that learning is reminiscence, and that the
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is in children. Simplicius also, in
his Commentary on the third book of Aristotle
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, speaketh of a certain interiour reason
in the soul, acting of it self, and originally full of
it's own proper notions, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>316. And, as the Platonic philosophy supposed
intellectual notions to be originally inexistent or
innate in the soul<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">309, 314.</NOTE>, so likewise it supposed sen∣sible
qualities to exist (though not originally) in the
soul, and there only. Socrates saith to Theaetetus,
you must not think the white colour that you see
is in any thing without your eyes, or in your eyes,
or in any place at all. And in the Timaeus Plato
teacheth, that the figure and motion of the particles of
fire dividing the parts of our bodies produce that
painful sensation we call heat. And Plotinus, in the
sixth book of his second Aenead, observes that
heat and other qualities are not qualities in the
things themselves, but acts: that heat is not a
quality but act in the fire: that Fire is not really
what we perceive in the qualities light, heat, and
colour. From all which it is plain, that whatever
real things they supposed to exist independent of
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
the soul, those were neither sensible things, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
cloathed with sensible qualities.</P>
<P>317. Neither Plato nor Aristotle by matter,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, understood corporeal substance, whatever
the moderns may understand by that word. To
them certainly it signified no positive actual being.
Aristotle describes it as made up of negatives, ha∣ving
neither quantity nor quality nor essence. And
not only the Platonists and Pythagoreans, but also
the Peripateticks themselves declare it to be known,
neither by sense, nor by any direct and just rea∣soning,
but only by some spurious or adulterine
method, as hath been observed before. Simon
Portius, a famous Peripatetic of the sixteenth cen∣tury,
denies it to be any substance at all, for, saith
he, nequit per se subsistere quia sequeretur, id
quod non est in actu esse in actu. If Jamblichus
may be credited, the Aegyptians supposed matter
so far from including ought of substance or essence,
that, according to them, God produced it by a
separation from all substance, essence or being,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. That matter is
actually nothing, but potentially all things, is the
doctrine of Aristotle, Theophrastus, and all the
antient Peripatetics.</P>
<P>318. According to those philosophers, matter is
only a pura potentia, a mere possibility. But Anax∣imander,
successor to Thales, is represented as
having thought the supreme deity to be infinite
matter. Nevertheless though Plutarch calleth it
matter, yet it was simply <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which means
no more than infinite or indefinite. And although
the moderns teach that space is real and infinitely
extended: yet if we consider that it is no intellec∣tual
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
notion, nor yet perceived by any of our sen∣ses,
we shall perhaps be inclined to think with
Plato in his Timaeus, that this also is the result of
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or spurious reasoning, and a kind of
waking dream. Plato observes that we dream,
as it were, when we think of place, and believe
it necessary, that whatever exists should exist in
some place. Which place or space<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">250, 270.</NOTE> he also
observes is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to be felt
as darkness is seen, or silence heard, being a mere
privation.</P>
<P>319. If any one should think to infer the reality
or actual being of matter from the modern tenet,
that gravity is always proportionable to the
quantity of matter, let him but narrowly scan the
modern demonstration of that tenet, and he will
find it to be a vain circle, concluding in truth no
more than this, that gravity is proportionable to
weight, that is to it self. Since matter is conceived
only as defect and mere possibility; and since God
is absolute perfection and act; it follows there is
the greatest distance and opposition imaginable
between God and Matter. Insomuch that a ma∣terial
God would be altogether inconsistent.</P>
<P>320. The force that produces, the intellect
that orders, the goodness that perfects all things
is the supreme being. Evil, defect, negation, is
not the object of God's creative power. From
motion the Peripatetics trace out a first immo∣veable
mover. The Platonics make God au∣thor
of all good, author of no evil, and unchange∣able.
According to Anaxagoras there was a con∣fused
mass of all things in one chaos, but mind
supervening, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, distinguished and divided
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
them. Anaxagoras, it seems, ascribed the motive
faculty to mind, which mind some subsequent phi∣losophers
have accurately discriminated from soul
and life, ascribing to it the sole faculty of intellec∣tion.</P>
<P>321. But still God was supposed the first agent,
the source and original of all things, which he
produceth, not occasionally or instrumentally
but with actual and real efficacy. Thus, the rea∣tise,
De secretiore parte divinae sapientiae secundum
Aepyptios, in the tenth book, saith of God, that
he is not only the first agent, but also that he
it is who truly acts or creates, qui verè efficit.</P>
<P>322. Varro, Tully, and St. Augustin understand
the soul to be vis, the power, or force that acts,
moves, enlivens. Now although, in our con∣ception,
vis, or spirit might be distinguished from
mind, it would not thence follow, that it acts
blindly or without mind, or that it is not closely
connected with intellect. If Plutarch is to be
trusted in his account of the opinions of Philoso∣phers:
Thales held the mind of the world to be
God: Democrius held the soul of the world to be
an igniform deity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">166, 168, 277.</NOTE>: Pythagoras taught that
God was the monad and the good, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>:
Socrates also and Plato pronounced him to be
the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">287.</NOTE>, the single, self originate one,
essentially good. Each of which appellations and
forms of speech directly tends to, and determines
in mind, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> saith Plutarch.</P>
<P>323. Whence that author concludes, that in the sense
of those philosophers God is a mind, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
not an abstract idea compounded of inconsistencies
and prescinded from all real things, as some mo∣derns
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
understand abstraction; but a really existing
spirit, distinct or separate from all sensible and cor∣poreal
beings. And although the Stoicks are re∣presented
as holding a corporeal deity, or that the
very system of the world is God, yet it is certain
they did not, at bottom, dissent from the fore∣mentioned
doctrine; inasmuch as they supposed the
world to be an animal,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">276, 279.</NOTE> consisting of soul or
mind as well as body.</P>
<P>324. This notion was derived from the Pytha∣goreans,
who held the world, as Timaeus Locrus
teacheth, to be one perfect animal, endued with
soul and reason: but then they believed it to have
been generated: Whereas the Stoics looked on
the world as the supreme God, including therein
mind or intellect. For the elementary fire, or, if
one may so speak, the animal spirit of the world,
seemeth, according to them, to have been
the vehicle of the soul of the world<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">277, 284.</NOTE>,
and soul it self the vehicle of intellect or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; since
they styled the Divinity <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">272.</NOTE>, or intel∣lectual
fire.</P>
<P>325. The Aegyptians, if we may credit the Her∣maic
writings, maintained God to be all things,
not only actual but possible. He is styled by them,
that which is made and that which is unmade. And
therein it is said, shall I praise thee for those things
thou hast made manifest, or for the things thou
hast hidden? therefore, in their sense, to manifest,
was to create; the things created having been be∣fore
hidden in God.

326. Now whether the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> be abstracted from
the sensible world, and considered by it self, as
distinct from, and presiding over the created sys∣tem,
or whether the whole universe, including
mind together with the mundane body, is con∣ceived
to be God<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">300.</NOTE>, and the creatures to be
partial manifestations of the divine essence, there
is no atheism in either case, whatever misconcep∣tions
there may be; so long as mind or intellect
is understood to preside over, govern, and con∣duct
the whole frame of Things. And this was
the general prevailing opinion among the philoso∣phers.</P>
<P>327. Nor if any one, with Aristotle in his me∣taphysics,
should deny that God knows any thing
without himself; seeing that God comprehends all
things, could this be justly pronounced an atheistical
opinion. Nor even was the following notion
of the same author to be accounted atheism, to
wit, that there are some things beneath the know∣ledge
of God, as too mean, base, and vile; how∣ever
wrong this notion may be, and unworthy of
the divine perfection.</P>
<P>328. Might we not conceive that God may be
said to be all in divers senses; as he is the cause
and origine of all beings; as the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
a doctrine both of Platonics and Peripatetics<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">309, 310.</NOTE>;
as the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is the place of all forms, and as it is the
same which comprehends and orders<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">320.</NOTE> and sus∣tains
the whole mundane system. Aristotle de∣clares,
that the divine force or influence premeates
<PB N="159" REF="162"/>
the intire universe<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">173.</NOTE> and that what the Pilot is
in a ship, the driver in a chariot, the praecentor in
a choir, the law in a city, the general in an army,
the same God is in the world. This he amply sets
forth in his book de mundo, a treatise which ha∣ving
been anciently ascribed to him, ought not to
be set aside from the difference of style, which (as
Patricious rightly observes) being in a letter to
a King, might well be supposed to differ from the
other dry and crabbed parts of his writings.</P>
<P>329. And although there are some expressions to
be met with in the Philosophers, even of the Platonic
and Aristotelic sects, which speak of God as mix∣ing
with, or prevading all nature and all the ele∣ments;
yet this must be explained by force and
not by extension, which was never attributed to
the mind<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">290, 293, 297, 319.</NOTE> either by Aristotle or Plato. This
they always affirmed to be incorporeal: and, as
Plotinus remarks, incorporeal things are distant
each from other not by place, but (to use his ex∣pression)
by alterity.</P>
<P>330. These disquisitions will probably seem dry
and useless, to such readers as are accustomed to
consider only sensible objects. The employment
of the mind on things purely intellectual is to most
men irksome: whereas the sensative powers, by
constant use acquire strength. Hence, the objects
of sense more forcibly affect us<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">264, 294.</NOTE>, and are too
often counted the chief good. For these things men
fight, cheat and scramble. Therefore, in order to
tame mankind and introduce a sense of virtue, the
best humane means is to exercise their understand∣ing,
<PB N="160" REF="163"/>
to give them a glympse of another world,
superior to the sensible, and while they take pains
to cherish and maintain the animal life, to teach
them not to neglect the intellectual.</P>
<P>331. Prevailing studies are of no small conse∣quence
to a state, the religion, manners and civil
government of a country ever taking some bias
from it's philosophy, which affects not only the
minds of its professors and students, but also the
opinions of all the better sort and the practice of
the whole people, remotely and consequentially, in∣deed,
though not inconsiderably. Have not the
polemic and scholastic philosophy been observed
to produce controversies in law and religion? And
have not Fatalisin and Sadducism gained ground,
during the general passion for the Corpuscularian
and mechanical philosophy, which hath prevailed
for about a century? This indeed might usefully
enough have employed some share of the leisure
and curiosity of inquisitive Persons. But when it
entered the seminaries of learning as a necessary ac∣complishment,
and most important part of educa∣tion,
by engrossing men's thoughts, and fixing their
minds so much on corporeal objects, and the laws
of motion, it hath, however undesignedly, indi∣rectly,
and by accident, yet not a little indisposed
them for spiritual, moral, and intellectual matters.
Certainly had the philosophy of Socrates and Py∣thagoras
prevailed in this Age, among those who
think themselves too wise to receive the dictates of
the gospel, we should not have seen interest take
so general and fast hold on the minds of men, nor
public spirit reputed to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a ge∣nerous
folly among those who are reckoned to be
the most knowing as well as the most getting part
of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="164"/>
332. IT might very well be thought serious trifling
to tell my readers that the greatest men had ever an
high esteem for Plato; whose writings are the touch∣stone
of a hasty and shallow mind; whose philosophy
has been the admiration of ages; which supplied pa∣triots,
magistrates, and lawgivers to the most flourish∣ing
states, as well as fathers to the church, and
doctors to the schools. Albeit in these days, the
depths of that old learning are rarely fathomed, and
yet it were happy for these lands, if our young nobi∣lity
and gentry instead of modern maxims would im∣bibe
the notions of the great men of antiquity. But
in these free-thinking times many an empty head is
shook at Aristotle and Plato, as well as at the holy
scriptures. And the writings of those celebrated an∣cients
are by most men treated on a foot, with the
dry and barbarous lucubrations of the schoolmen. It
may be modestly presumed, there are not many
among us, even of those who are called the better
sort, who have more sense, virtue, and love of their
country than Cicero, who in a letter to Atticus could
not forbear exclaiming, O Socrates et Socratici viri!
nunquam vobis gratiam referam. Would to God
many of our countrymen had the same obligations to
those Socratic writers. Certainly where the people
are well educated, the art of piloting a state is best
learned from the writings of Plato. But among bad
men void of discipline and education, Plato, Py<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha∣goras
and Aristotle themselves, were they living,
could do but little good. Plato hath drawn a very
humorous and instructive picture of such a state; which
I shall not transcribe for certain reasons. But whoever
has a mind, may fee i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the seventy eighth page of
the second tome of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dus his edition of Plato's works.</P>
<P>333. PROCLUS, in the first book of his commentary
on the theology of Plato observes that, as in the my∣steries,
those who are initiated, at first meet with ma∣nifold
and multiform Gods, but being entered and
thoroughly initiated they receive the divine illumina∣tion
<PB N="162" REF="165"/>
and participate the very deity: in like manner, if
the soul look abroad she beholds the shadows and
images of things: but returning into herself she un∣ravels
and beholds her own essence: At first she
seemeth only to behold her self: But having pene∣trated
farther she discovers the mind. And again,
still farther advancing into the innermost sanctuary of
the soul she contemplates the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And this,
he saith, is the most excellent of all human acts, in
the silence and repose of the faculties of the soul to
tend upwards to the very divinity; to approach and
be closely joined with that which is ineffable and supe∣perior
to all beings. When come so high as the first
principle she ends her journey and rests. Such is the
doctrine of Proclus.</P>
<P>334. BUT Socrates in the first Alcibiades teacheth on
the other hand, that the contemplation of God is the
proper means to know or understand our own soul.
As the eye, saith he, looking stedfastly at the visive
part or pupil of another eye beholds it's self, even so
the Soul beholds and understands her self, while she
contemplates the deity which is wisdom and vertue or
like thereunto. In the Phaedon Socrates speaks of
God as being <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">260, 320.</NOTE>, the good and
the decent: Plotinus represents God as order: Aristo∣tle
as law.</P>
<P>335. IT may seem perhaps to those, who have
been taught to discourse about substratums, more rea∣sonable
and pious to attribute to the Deity a more sub∣stantial
being, than the notional entities of wisdom,
order, law, vertue, or goodness, which being only
complex ideas, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ramed and put together by the under∣standing,
are its own creatures, and have nothing sub∣stantial,
real, or independent in them. But it must
be considered, that in the Platonic system, order,
vertue, law, goodness, and wisdom are not creatures
of the soul of man, but innate and originally existent
therein, not as an accident in a substance, but as light
<PB N="163" REF="166"/>
to enlighten, and as a guide to govern. In Plato's
style, the term idea doth not merely signify an inert
inactive object of the understanding, but is used as
synonymous with <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, cause and principle.
According to that philosopher, goodness, beauty,
vertue and such like are not sigments of the mind,
nor mere mixed modes, nor yet abstract ideas in the
modern sense, but the most real beings, intellectual
and unchangeable; and therefore more real than the
fleeting transient objects of sense<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">306.</NOTE>, which wanting
stability cannot be subjects of science<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">264, 266, 297.</NOTE>, much less
of intellectual knowledge.</P>
<P>336. BY Parmenides, Timaeus, and Plato a di∣stinction
was made, as hath been observed already, be∣tween
genitum and ens. The former sort is always
a generating or in fieri<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">304, 306.</NOTE>, but never exists, because
it never continues the same, being in a constant
change, ever perishing and producing. By entia they
understand things remote from sense, invisible and in∣tellectual,
which never changing are still the same,
and may therefore be said truly to exist. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which
is generally translated substance, but more properly
essence, was not thought to belong to things sensible
and corporeal, which have no stability; but rather to
intellectual ideas though discerned with more difficulty,
and making less impression on a mind stupified and
immersed in animal life, than gross objects that con∣tinually
beset and sollicit our senses.</P>
<P>337. THE most refined humane intellect exerted to
it's utmost reach can only seize some imperfect glymp∣ses
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">313, 330.</NOTE> of the divine ideas, abstracted from all things
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orporeal, sensible, and imaginable. Therefore Py∣thagoras
and Plato treated them in a mysterious man∣ner,
concealing rather than exposing them to vulgar
eyes; so far were they from thinking▪ that those ab∣stract
things, although the most real, were the fittest
to influence common minds, or become principles of
<PB N="164" REF="167"/>
knowledge, not to say duty and virtue, to the gene∣rality
of Mankind.</P>
<P>338. ARISTOTLE and his followers have made a
monstrous representation of the Platonic ideas; and
some of Plato's own school have said very odd things
concerning them. But if that philosopher himself was
not read only, but studied also with care, and made
his own interpreter, I believe the prejudice that now
lies against him would soon wear off<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9, 313.</NOTE>, or be even
converted into a high esteem for those exalted notions
and fine hints, that sparkle and shine throughout his
writings; which seem to contain not only the most
valuable learning of Athens and Greece, but also a
treasure of the most remote traditions and early science
of the East.</P>
<P>339. IN the Timaeus of Plato mention is made of
ancient persons, authors of traditions, and the off∣spring
of the Gods. It is very remarkable, that in
the account of the creation contained in the same piece,
it is said that God was pleased with his work, and
that the night is placed before the day. The more
we think, the more difficult shall we find it to con∣ceive,
how mere man, grown up in the vulgar habits
of life, and weighed down by sensuality, should ever
be able to arrive at science, without some tradition<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">298, 301, 302.</NOTE>
or teaching, which might either sow the seeds of know∣ledge,
or call forth and excite those latent seeds that
were originally sown in the soul.</P>
<P>340. HUMANE souls in this low situation, bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣ing
on mere animal life, bear the weight and see
through the dusk of a gross atmosphere, gathered
from wrong judgments daily passed, false opinions
daily learned, and early habits of an older date than
either judgment or opinion. Through such a medium
the sharpest eye cannot see clearly<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">292, 293, 294.</NOTE>. And if by
some extraordinary effort the mind should surmount
this dusky region▪ and snatch a glympse of pure light,
<PB N="165" REF="168"/>
she is soon drawn backward and depressed by the hea∣viness
of the animal nature, to which she is chained.
And if again she chanceth, amidst the agitation of
wild fancies and strong affections, to spring upwards,
a second relapse speedily succeeds into this region of
darkness and dreams.</P>
<P>341. NEVERTHELESS, as the mind gathers strength
by repeated acts, we should not despond, but con∣tinue
to exert the prime and flower of our faculties,
still recovering, and reaching on, and struggling into
the upper region, whereby our natural weakness and
blindness may be in some degree remedied, and a
taste attained of Truth and Intellectual Life. Beside
the constant prevailing opinion of the greatest men of
antiquity, that there is both an universal spirit author
of life and motion, and an universal mind enlighten∣ing
and ordering all things, it was a rec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived tenet
among them, that there is also <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">322.</NOTE>,
which they looked on as the fons deitatis, the first hy∣postasis
in the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vinity.</P>
<P>342. THE one or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, being immutable and indivi∣sible,
always the same and entire, was therefore thought
to exist truly and originally, and other things only so
far as they are one and the same, by participation of
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. This give unity, stability, reality to things<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">264, 306.</NOTE>.
Plato describes God, as Moses, from his being. Ac∣cording
to both, God is he who truly is, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Change and division were esteemed defects or bad.
Evil scatters, divides, destroys. Good, on the con∣trary,
produceth concord and union, assembles, com∣bines,
perfects, and preserves entire. The several be∣ings
which compose the universe are parts of the same
system, they combine to carry on one end, and per∣fect
one whole. And this aptness and concurrence
thereunto furnishes the partial particular idea of Good
in the distinct creatures. Hence it might have come
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
to pass, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> were regarded as one
and the same.</P>
<P>343. LIGHT and sight (saith Plato in the sixth
book of his Republic) are not the Sun: even so truth
and knowledge are not the Good it self, although they
approach thereunto. And again, what the Sun is in
a visible place with respect to sight and things seen,
that same is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or Good in an intelligible place,
with respect to understanding and things understood.
Therefore the good or one is not the light that en∣lightens,
but the source of that light.</P>
<P>344. EVERY moment produceth some change in
the parts of this visible creation. Something is added or
diminished, or altered in essence, quantity, quality, or
habitude. Wherefore all generated beings were said
by the ancients to be in a perpetual flux<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">304, 336.</NOTE> And that
which, on a confused and general view, seems one
single constant being, shall upon a nearer inspection ap∣pear
a continued series of different beings. But God
remains for ever one and the same. Therefore God
alone exists. This was the doctrine of Heraclitus,
Plato, and other ancients.</P>
<P>345. IT is the opinion of Plato and his followers,
that in the soul of man, prior and superior to intellect,
there is somewhat of an higher nature, by virtue of
which we are one; and that by means of our one or
unite, we are most closely joined to the Deity. And,
as by our intellect we touch the divine intellect, even
so by our <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or unite the very flower of our essence,
as Proclus expresseth it, we touch the first one.</P>
<P>346. ACCORDING to the Platonic philosophy, ens
and unum are the same. And consequently our minds
participate so far of existence as they do of unity. But
it should seem that personality is the indivisible center
of the soul or mind, which is a monad so far <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth as
she is a person. Therefore Person is really that which
exists, inasmuch as it participates the divine unity.
<PB N="167" REF="170"/>
In man the monad or indivisible is the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the
self same self or very self, a thing, in the opinion of
Socrates, much and narrowly to be inquired into and
discussed, to the end that, knowing ourselves, we may
know what belongs to us and our happiness.</P>
<P>347. UPON mature reflexion the person or mind, of
all created beings, seemeth alone indivisible, and to
partake most of unity. But sensible things are rather
considered as one than truly so, they being in a per∣petual
flux or succession, ever differing and various.
Nevertheless, all things together may be considered
as one universe<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">287, 288.</NOTE>, one by the connexion, relation
and order of it's parts, which is the work of mind
whose unite is by Platonics, supposed a participation
of the first <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>348. SOCRATES, in the Theaetetus of Plato, speaketh
of two parties of philosophers, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
the flowing philosophers who held all
things to be in a perpetual flux, always a generating
and never existing; and those others who maintained
the universe to be fixed and immoveable. The diffe∣rence
seems to have been this, that Heraclitus, Pro∣tagoras,
Empedocles, and in general those of the for∣mer
sect, considered things sensible and natural;
whereas Parmenides and his party considered <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
not as the sensible but as the intelligible world<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">293, 294, 295.</NOTE>, ab∣stracted
from all sensible things.</P>
<P>349. IN effect if we mean by things the sensible
objects; these, it is evident, are always flowing; but
if we mean things purely intelligible, then we may say
on the other hand, with equal truth, that they are
immoveable and unchangeable. So that those, who
thought the whole or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a fixed or
permanent one, seem to have understood the whole of
real beings, which in their sense was only the intel∣lectual
world, not allowing reality of being to things
not permanent.</P>

350. THE displeasure of some readers may perhaps
be incurred, by surprising them into certain reflexions
and inquiries for which they have no curiosity. But
perhaps some others may be pleased, to find a dry
subject varied by digressions, traced through remote
inferences, and carried into ancient times, whose hoary
maxims<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">298, 301.</NOTE> scattered in this essay are not proposed as
principles, but barely as hints to awaken and exercise
the inquisitive reader, on points not beneath the atten∣tion
of the ablest men. Those great men, Pythagoras,
Plato, and Aristotle the most consummate in politics,
who founded states, or instructed princes, or wrote
most accurately on public government, were at the
same time most acute at all abstracted and sublime
Speculations; the clearest light being ever necessary to
guide the most important actions. And whatever the
world thinks, he who hath not much meditated upon
God, the Humane mind, and the Summum bonum,
may possibly make an able earthworm, but will most
indubitably make a sorry patriot and a sorry states∣man.</P>
<P>351. ACCORDING to the nice metaphysics of those
ancient philosophers <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, being considered as what
was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst and simplest in the deity, was prescinded even
from entity to which it was thought prior and superior▪
and is therefore by the Platonics styled super-essential.
And in the Parmenides it is said, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> doth not exist;
which might seem to imply a negation of the divine
being. The truth is, Zeno and Parmenides argued,
that a thing existing in time was older and younger
than it self; therefore the constant immutable <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> did
not exist in time; and if not in time, then in none of
the differences of time past, present, or to come;
therefore we cannot say that it was, is, or will be.
But nevertheless it is admitted in the same Parmenides,
that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is every where present to <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; that is,
instead of a temporary succession of moments, there
<PB N="169" REF="172"/>
is one eternal now, or, punctum Stans, as it is t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmed
by the Schoolmen.</P>
<P>352. THE simplicity of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (the father in the
Pythagoric and Platonic trinity) is conceived such as
to exclude intellect or mind, to which it is supposed
prior. And that hath created a suspicion of atheism
in this opinion. For, saith the learned Doctor Cud∣worth,
shall we say that the first hypostasis or person
is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, senseless and irrational, and alto∣gether
devoid of mind and understanding? or would
not this be to introduce a kind of mysterious atheism?
To which it may be answered, that whoever acknow∣ledgeth
the universe to be made and governed by an
eternal mind, cannot be justly deemed an atheist<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">154, 276, 279, 287.</NOTE>.
And this was the tenet of those ancient philosophers.
In the Platonic doctrine, the generation of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was not contingent but necessary, not temporary,
but from everlasting. There never was a time sup∣posed
wherein <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> subsisted without intellect, the
priority having been understood only as a priority of
order and conception, but not a priority of age.
Therefore, the maintaining a distinction of priority
between <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> doth not infer, that the one
ever existed without the other. It follows, therefore,
that the father or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> may, in a certain sense, be said
to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> without atheism, or without destroying the
notion of a deity; any more than it would destroy the
notion of a humane soul, if we should conceive a di∣stinction
between self and intellect, or intellect and
life. To which we may farther add, that it is a doc∣trine
of Platonics, and agrees with their master's te∣nets,
that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or the first hypostasis contains all ex∣cellence
and perfection whereof it is the original
Source, and is eminenter, as the Schools speak, intel∣lect
and life, as well as goodness; while the second
hypostasis is essentially intellect, and by participation
goodness and life; and the third, life essentially,
<PB N="170" REF="173"/>
and by participation goodness and intellect.</P>
<P>353. THEREFORE, the whole being considered,
it will not seem just, to fix the imputation of atheism
upon those philosophers, who held the doctrine of
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; whether it be taken in an abstracted or collec∣tive,
a metaphysical or merely vulgar, meaning<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">300.</NOTE>;
that is, whether we prescind unity from essence and
intellect, since metaphysical distinctions of the divine
attributes do not in reality divide them; or whether
we consider the universal system of beings as one,
since the union, connexion, and order of it's mem∣bers,
do manifestly infer a mind or intellect to be
cause thereof.</P>
<P>354. THE one, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> may be conceived either
by composition or division. For as, on the one hand,
we may say the world or universe is ONE whole or
ONE animal; so we may, on the other hand, consider
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> by division or abstraction, as somewhat in the or∣der
of things prior to mind. In either sense there is
no atheism, so long as mind is admitted to preside
and direct the animal; and so long as the unum or
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is supposed not to exist without mind,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">287, 288.</NOTE>. So
that neither Heraclitus nor Parmenides, nor Pythago∣ras
nor Plato, neither the Aegyptians nor Stoics, with
their doctrine of a divine whole or animal, nor Xeno∣phanes
with his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, are justly to be accounted
ath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ists. Therefore modern atheism, be it of Hobbes,
Spinosa, Collins, or whom you will, is not to be
countenanced by the learned and great names of anti∣quity.</P>
<P>355. PLATO teacheth, that the doctrine concerning
the one or unite is a means, to lead and raise the
mind<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">29<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 295.</NOTE> to the knowledge of him who truly is.
And it is a tenet both of Aristotle and Plato, that
identity is a certain unity. The Pythagoreans also, as
well as the Platonic philosophers, held unum and ens
<PB N="171" REF="174"/>
to be the same. Consistently with which that only
can be said to exist, which is one and the same. In
things sensible and imaginable, as such, there seems
to be no unity, nothing that may be called one prior
to all act of the mind; since they being in themselves
aggregates, consisting of parts or compounded of
elements▪ are in effect many. Accordingly it is re∣marked
by Themistius, the learned Interpreter of Ari∣stotle,
that to collect many notions into one, and to
consider them as one, is the work of intellect, and
not of sense or fancy.</P>
<P>356. ARISTOTLE himself, in his third book of the
Soul, saith it is the mind that maketh each thing to
be one, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. How this is
done, Themistius is more particular, observing, that
as being conferreth essence, the mind by virtue of her
simplicity conferreth simplicity upon compounded
beings. And, indeed, it seemeth that the mind, so
far forth as person, is individual<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">345, 346, 347.</NOTE> therein resembling
the divine one by participation, and imparting to
other things what it self participates from above.
This is agreeable to the doctrine of the ancients, how∣ever
the contrary opinion of supposing number to be
an original primary quality in things, independent of
the mind, may obtain among the moderns.</P>
<P>357. THE Peripatetics taught, that in all divisible
things there was somewhat indivisible, and in all com∣pounded
things somewhat simple. This they derived
from an act of the mind. And neither this simple
indivisible unite, nor any sum of repeated unites, con∣sequently
no number, can be separated from the things
themselves and from the operation of the mind. The∣mistius
goeth so far as to affirm, that it cannot be se∣parated
from the words or signs; and, as it cannot be
uttered without them, so saith he, neither can it be
conceived without them. Thus much upon the whole
<PB N="172" REF="175"/>
may be concluded, that distinct from the mind and
her operations, there is in created beings neither unite
nor number.</P>
<P>358. OF inferior beings the humane mind, self, or
person is the most simple and undivided essence<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>.
And the supreme father is the most perfect one. There∣fore
the flight of the mind towards God is called by
the Platonics <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The supreme being,
saith Plotinus, as he excludes all diversity, is ever
alike present. And we are then present to him, when,
recollected and abstracted from the world and sen∣sible
objects, we are most free and disengaged<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">268.</NOTE>
from all variety. He adds, that in the intuition of
the supreme deity the soul finds her wished for end
and repose; which that philosopher calls awaking out
of his body into himself.</P>
<P>359. IN the tenth book of the arcane, or divine
wisdom of the Aegyptians, we are taught that the
supreme being is not the cause of any created thing;
but that he produced or made the word; and that all
created beings were made by the word, which is ac∣cordingly
styled the cause of all causes: and that this
was also the doctrine of the Chaldaeans. Plato, like∣wise,
in his letter to Hermias, Erastus, and Coriscus,
speaks of God the ruler and cause of all things as hav∣ing
a father: And, in his Epinomis, he expresly
teacheth that the word or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> made the world. Ac∣cordingly
Saint Augustine in his commentary on the
beginning of Saint John's Gospel, having declared
that Christ is the wisdom of God by which all things
were made, observes that this doctrine was also found
in the writings of philosophers, who taught that
God had an only begotten Son by whom are all
things.</P>
<P>360. Now, though Plato had joined with an ima∣gination
the most splendid and magnificent, an intel∣lect
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
not less deep and clear; yet it is not to be sup∣posed,
that either he or any other philosophers of
Greece or the East, had by the light of nature attained
an adequate notion of the Holy Trinity, nor even that
their imperfect notion, so far as it went, was exactly
just; nor perhaps that those sublime hints, which dart
forth like flashes of light in the midst of a profound
darkness, were originally struck from the hard rock of
humane reason; but rather derived, at least in part,
by a divine tradition<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">298, 301.</NOTE> from the author of all things.
It seems a remarkable confirmation of this, what Plo∣tinus
observes in his fifth ennead, that this doctrine of
a Trinity, father, mind, and soul, was no late inven∣tion,
but an ancient tenet.</P>
<P>361. CERTAIN it is, that the notion of a Trinity is
to be found in the writings of many old heathen philo∣sophers,
that is to say, a notion of three divine hypo∣stases.
Authority, light, and life did, to the eye of
Reason, plainly appear to support, pervade, and ani∣mate
the mundane system or macrocosm. The same
appeared in the microcosm, preserving soul and body,
enlightening the mind, and moving the affections.
And these were conceived to be necessary universal
principles, coexisting, and co-operating in such sort,
as never to exist asunder, but on the contrary to con∣stitute
one Sovereign of all things. And, indeed,
how could power or authority avail or subsist without
knowledge? or either without life and action?</P>
<P>362. IN the administration of all things there is
authority to establish, law to direct, and justice to
execute. There is first the Source of all perfection, or
fons deitatis, secondly the supreme Reason, order, or
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and lastly the Spirit which quickens and inspires.
We are sprung from the father, irradiated or enlight∣ened
by the son, and moved by the spirit. Certainly,
that there is father, son, and spirit; that these bear
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>
analogy to the sun, light, and heat; and are other∣wise
expressed by the terms, principle, mind, and
soul; by one or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, intellect, and life; by good,
word, and love; and that generation was not attri∣buted
to the second hypostasis, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in re∣spect
of time,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">352.</NOTE>, but only in respect of origine and
order, as an eternal necessary emanation; these are
the express tenets of Platonists, Pythagoreans, Aegyp∣tians,
and Chaldaeans.</P>
<P>363. THOUGH it may be well presumed there is
nothing to be found on that sublime subject in hu∣mane
writings, which doth not bear the sure Signa∣ture
of humanity; yet it cannot be denied, that seve∣ral
fathers of the church have thought fit to illustrate
the christian doctrine of the holy trinity, by simi∣litudes
and expressions borrowed from the most emi∣nent
Heathens, whom they conceived to have been
no strangers to that mystery; as hath been plainly
proved by Bessarion, Eugubinus, and Doctor Cud∣worth.</P>
<P>364. THEREFORE, how unphilosophical soever
that doctrine may seem to many of the present age,
yet it is certain, the men of greatest fame and learn∣ing
among the ancient philosophers held a trinity in
the Godhead. It must be owned, that upon this
point some later Platonists of the Gentile world seem
to have bewilder'd themselves, (as many Christians
have also done) while they pursued the hints de∣rived
from their predecessors, with too much cu∣riosity.</P>
<P>365. BUT Plato himself considered that doctrine as
a venerable mystery, not to be lightly treated of or
rashly divulged. Wherefore in a letter to Dionysius
he writes (as he himself professeth) aenigmatically and
briefly in the following terms, which he giveth for a
summary of his notion concerning the supreme Being,
<PB N="175" REF="178"/>
and which being capable of divers senses, I leave to be
decyphered by the learned reader. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Plato enjoins Dionysius over and over,
with great earnestness not to suffer, what he commu∣nicates
concerning the mystery of the divine Nature,
to fall into illiterate or vulgar hands, giving it withal
as a reason for this caution, that nothing would seem
more ridiculous or absurd to the common run of man∣kind.
He adds, that in regard writings might mis∣carry,
the prudent way was to write nothing at all on
those matters, but to teach and learn them by word of
mouth: for which reason, saith he, I have never
wrote any thing thereon; nor is there, nor shall there
ever be any thing of Plato's, extant on that subject.
He farther adds, as for what hath been now said, it
belongs all to Socrates.</P>
<P>366. AND, indeed, what this philosopher in his
Phaedrus speaketh of the super-coelestial region, and
the divinity resident therein, is of a strain not to be
relished or comprehended by vulgar minds; to wit,
essence really existent, object of intellect alone, with∣out
colour, without figure, without any tangible qua∣lity.
He might very justly conceive that such a de∣scription
must seem ridiculous to sensual men.</P>
<P>367. As for the perfect intuition of divine things,
that he supposeth to be the lot of pure souls, behold∣ing
by a pure light, initiated, happy, free and un∣stained
from those bodies, wherein we are now im∣prisoned
like oysters. But in this mortal state, we
must be satisfy'd to make the best of those glympses
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">335, 337.</NOTE> within our reach. It is Plato's remark in his
Theaetetus, that while we sit still we are never the
wiser, but going into the river and moving up and
down, is the way to discover its depths and shallows.
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
If we exercise and bestir our selves, we may even here
discover something.</P>
<P>368. THE eye by long use comes to see even in the
darkest cavern: and there is no subject so obscure, but
we may discern some glympse of truth by long poring
on it. Truth is the cry of all but the game of a few.
Certainly where it is the chief passion, it doth not give
way to vulgar cares and views; nor is it contented
with a little ardour in the early time of life, active,
perhaps, to pursue, but not so fit to weigh and revise.
He that would make a real progress in knowledge,
must dedicate his age as well as youth, the later growth
as well as first fruits, at the altar of Truth.</P>
