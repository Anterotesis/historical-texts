<HEAD>CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Ver. 1.</HI> Introduction. Address. The earliest Ages knew nothing of Ridicule. The Rise and Progress of it. The present Age extremely addicted to it. Those most so who have no great Talents of their own. Ill Effects of it, in Religion, in common Life.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ver. 87.</HI> The Pretence on which our Fondness for Ridicule is founded, <HI>i. e.</HI> its being the Test of Truth. It is not the Test of Truth. There is nothing but what may be so disguised as to appear ridiculous. Examples of several Kinds.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ver. 163.</HI> Ridicule on the Sciences considered. A Fondness for a particular Science and Ignorance of the rest generally the Causes of it. All Arts useful, and therefore not to be ridiculed. Even just Ridicule on the Sciences attended with ill Effects.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ver. 215.</HI> Ridicule in common Life. To be handled cautiously. Personal Defects not the Object of it. Vice above Ridicule, and the Danger of laughing at it. The good Success of the middle Comedy. Made use of to ill Purposes, and despised. The new Comedy imitated by our Poets. The small Effects it has; the ill Effects it may have in making Men Hypocrites. Virtues and Vices sometimes so blended, that the one cannot be laughed at without injuring the other. Example.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ver. 334.</HI> Affectation the allowed Object of Ridicule. Those most Ridiculous who affect Follies and Vices. Affectations often found among great Virtues. To be repress'd however, but with Good-nature Goodnature the only thing that can make Ridicule use∣ful. Recommended to the Satirists. Conclusion.</ITEM>

<L>No hoarded Bliss the Soul at Home confin'd,</L>
<L>Self-center'd Views, the Famine of the Mind.</L>

<L>Keen Envy height'ning what weak Pride begun,<MILESTONE N="41"/></L>

<LG>
<L>Our mirthful Age, to all Extremes a Prey,</L>

<L>No Truth so sacred, Banter cannot hit,</L>
<L>No Fool so stupid, but he aims at Wit.</L>
<L>Ev'n those, whose Breasts ne'er plann'd one virtuous Deed,</L>

<L>No venial Slip our quick Attention scapes;</L>

<L>No Storms, no Tumults reach the sacred Fane,<MILESTONE N="95"/></L>

<L>Sly Fraud may reach it, and close Craft surprize.<MILESTONE N="100"/></L>
<L>Truth, drawn like Truth, must blaze divinely bright;</L>
<L>But, drawn like Error, Truth may cheat the Sight.</L>

<L>And keep with Caution what they can't forsake;</L>
<L>For Fear of Man, in his most mirthful Mood,<MILESTONE N="310"/></L>
<L>May make us Hypocrites, but seldom good.</L>
<L>And what avails that Seas confess their Bounds,</L>
<L>If subtler Insects sap the <HI>Belgian</HI> Mounds?</L>
<L>That no wing'd Mischief cleave the Mid-day Skies,</L>
<L>If thro' the Dark the baleful Venom flies?<MILESTONE N="315"/></L>
<L>Or these, more dire, their public Rage abate,</L>
<L>To stab in secret the unguarded State?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Besides, in Men have varying Passions made</L>
<L>Such nice Confusions, blending Light with Shade,</L>
<L>That eager Zeal to laugh the Vice away<MILESTONE N="320"/></L>
<L>May hurt some Virtue's intermingling Ray.</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="17"/>Men's Faults, like <HI>Martin</HI>'s broider'd Coat, demand</L>
<L>The nicest Touches of the steadiest Hand.</L>
<L>Some yeild with ease, while some their Posts maintain,</L>
<L>And Parts defective will at last remain.<MILESTONE N="325"/></L>
<L>There, where they best succeed, your Labours bend,</L>
<L>Nor render useless, what you strive to mend.</L>

<L>The youthful <HI>Curio</HI> blush'd whene'er he spoke,</L>
<L>His ill-tim'd Modesty the general Joke;</L>
<L>Sneer'd by his Friends, nor cou'd that Sneer endure—</L>
<L>Behold, sad Instance of their Skill to cure!</L>
<L>The conscious Blood, that fir'd his Cheek before,</L>
<L>Now leaves his Bosom cool, and warns no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Affectation —there, we all confess,</L>
<L>Strong are the Motives, and the Danger less.<MILESTONE N="335"/></L>
<L>No Nature's there, to melt our Manhood down,</L>
<L>No <HI>Gorgon</HI> Vice, to stare us into Stone.</L>
<L>Sure we may smile where Fools themselves have made,</L>
<L>As balk'd Spectators of a Farce ill play'd.</L>
<L>And laugh, if Satire's Breath shou'd rudely raise<MILESTONE N="340"/></L>
<L>The painted Plumes which Vanity displays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O fruitful Source of everlasting Mirth!</L>
<L>For Fools, like Apes, are Mimics from their Birth.</L>
<L>By Fashion govern'd, Nature each neglects,</L>
<L>And barters Graces for admir'd Defects.<MILESTONE N="345"/></L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="18"/>Some aim at Ignorance with matchless Skill,</L>
<L>And learn, in spite of Sense, to reason ill.</L>
<L>Some Vice affect, poor Folly's last Excess,</L>
<L>As <HI>Picts</HI> mistook Deformity for Dress,</L>
<L>And smear'd with so much Art their hideous Charms,</L>
<L>That the grim Beauty scar'd you from her Arms.</L>
<L>The artful Hypocrites, who Virtue wear,</L>
<L>Confess, at least, the sacred Form is fair;</L>
<L>And Apes of Science equally allow</L>
<L>The Scholar's Title to the laurel'd Brow;<MILESTONE N="355"/></L>
<L>But what have you 'gainst Satire's Lash to plead,</L>
<L>Who 'midst Conviction's pow'rful Blaze proceed?</L>
<L>What but that worst of Pangs you dare not own,</L>
<L>Who laugh abroad, but tremble when alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet oft these Follies bask in Virtue's Shine,<MILESTONE N="360"/></L>
<L>The wild Luxuriance of a Soil too fine.</L>
<L>But oh, repress them, wheresoe'er they rise—</L>
<L>And how perform it?—There the Danger lies.</L>
<L>Short are the Lessons taught in Nature's School,</L>
<L>Here, each Peculiar asks a sep'rate Rule.<MILESTONE N="365"/></L>
<L>Nice is the Task, be gen'ral if you can,</L>
<L>Or strike with Caution if you point the Man:</L>
<L>And think, O think, the Cause by all assign'd</L>
<L>To raise our Laughter, makes it most unkind.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="19"/>For tho' from Nature <HI>these</HI> no Strength receive,<MILESTONE N="370"/></L>
<L>We give them Nature when we bid them live.</L>
<L>Like <HI>Jove</HI>'s <HI>Minerva</HI> springs the gentle Train,</L>
<L>The genuine Offspring of each teeming Brain;</L>
<L>On which, like tend'rest Sires, we fondly doat,</L>
<L>Plan future Fame in Luxury of Thought,<MILESTONE N="375"/></L>
<L>And scarce at last, o'erpower'd by Foes or Friends,</L>
<L>Torn from our Breasts the dear Delusion ends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let Goodnature every Grace exert,</L>
<L>And, while it mends it, win th'unfolding Heart.</L>
<L>As in some Stream the Bank's projected Force<MILESTONE N="380"/></L>
<L>Not stops the Current, but directs its Course,</L>
<L>So let Goodnature o'er our Mirth preside,</L>
<L>Divert, not check; without impelling, guide.</L>
<L>Allur'd by this, the gath'ring Frown unbends,</L>
<L>The Laugh grows gen'ral, and ev'n Wits are Friends.</L>
<L>Touch'd with this trickling Balm, fair Virtue wakes,</L>
<L>And gen'rous Satire heals the Wound it makes.</L>
<L>Secur'd by this, ye <HI>British</HI> Bards, be bold,</L>
<L>Let copious Humour every Source unfold,</L>
<L>Inventive Wit its whole Artillery play,<MILESTONE N="390"/></L>
<L>Grave as <HI>Cervantes,</HI> or as <HI>Lucian</HI> gay.</L>
<L>In <HI>Clio</HI>'s number'd Prose teach Mirth to chide,</L>
<L><HI>Clio Britannia</HI>'s Censor, and her Pride:</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="20"/>Let, like <HI>Scarron</HI>'s, the strong Description glow,</L>
<L>To sink at once more eminently low:<MILESTONE N="395"/></L>
<L>With <HI>Butler</HI>'s Drollery, <HI>Garth</HI>'s Politeness vie,</L>
<L>And <HI>Rablais'</HI> Jest, without his Ribaldry:</L>
<L>Wear <HI>Phillips'</HI> pompous, <HI>Gay</HI>'s ingenuous Stile,</L>
<L><HI>Arbuthnot</HI>'s various, <HI>Swift</HI>'s unweary'd Smile;</L>

<L>Shares every Art that every Muse can give,</L>
<L>And, nobly conscious whence that Influence came,</L>
<L>To silence Envy, dares avow the Flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus shall my Friend by stealing Steps discern</L>
<L>That soft Humanity, he loves, return:<MILESTONE N="405"/></L>
<L>See moral Mirth a Face of Triumph wear,</L>
<L>Yet smile unconscious of th' extorted Tear.</L>
<L>See Vice, attended by his captive Train,</L>
<L>Confess its Justice, while he bites his Chain;</L>
<L>Deep in her Folds her Sting pale Envy hide,<MILESTONE N="410"/></L>
<L>And Worth, self-valuing, own an humbler Guide;</L>
<L>Pride, without Rancour, feel th' objected Fault,</L>
<L>And Folly blush, as willing to be taught;</L>
<L>Critics grow mild, Life's witty Warfare cease,</L>
<L>And true Goodnature breathe the Balm of Peace.<MILESTONE N="415"/></L>
