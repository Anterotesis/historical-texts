<HEAD>TO
JOHN *****, Es{que}</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>Feb. 21. 1749.</DATE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have my sincerest Thanks
for the kind Information you
sent me of the generous Scheme
that is form'd for the Printing Mrs. LEA∣POR'S
remaining Papers, for the Benefit of
her Father; and that the ingenious Gen∣tlemen
you mention, intend to give some
Account of the Author: For nothing can
give me more Pleasure than to hear of a
Design that may do Honour to her Me∣mory,
and be of Service to Him for whom
she always expressed a most affectionate
and dutiful Regard, particularly in her last
Moments.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="16"/>
I shall readily contribute any thing in
my Power, tho' I fear that is very little:
But, upon making a thorough Search
among my Papers, I have found Two or
Three of hers, that were mislaid when the
other were sent to Mrs. <HI>J</HI>—; which I here
send you, with two or three Copies wrote
in her Childhood, that have since been
alter'd as they now stand in the printed
Book.</P>
<P>Several of those sent to Mrs. <HI>J</HI>—were
likewise wrote when she was very young;
and were condemn'd to the Flames by
herself, but spared at my Intercession; so
that I am very dubious, whether they will
be thought worth printing or not; though I
must own myself fond of every thing that
was hers.</P>
<P>I remember I saw, two or three Years be∣fore
my Acquaintance with her commenced,
a Book about the Size of a common Copy-Book
(but something thicker) fill'd with
Poems of her writing, that much pleas'd
me. I thought them extraordinary Per∣formances
for a Girl of her Age, and one
<PB N="xix" REF="17"/>
that had so little Advantage (or rather
none at all) either from Books or Con∣versation:
But my bad State of Health
prevented me from making any further
Enquiry concerning this young Genius, till
about fourteen Months before her Death,
when I was inform'd she had wrote a
Tragedy.</P>
<P>I could not help smiling at this; think∣ing
it at least a very bold Attempt from a
Person in her Situation. But however, it
raised my Curiosity very much: And hap∣pening
to meet with her a Day or two
afterwards, I begg'd the Favour of seeing
it; which was readily granted. You may
easily guess how far it exceeded my Ex∣pectation.</P>
<P>Soon after I made her a Visit; and
expressing how much I lik'd the Play, de∣sir'd
she would give me Leave to see any
thing else she might have wrote; upon
which she brought a little Box, where
her Papers lay in a careless confus'd man∣ner,
and allow'd me to look them all over;
which I did with a great deal of Pleasure,
and no small Astonishment.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="18"/>
I then enquired for the little Book I
had seen before; but she told me she had
burnt it long ago, with several other Pa∣pers,
which she did not think worth pre∣serving.</P>
<P>This I could not help blaming her for,
as there were a great many pretty Things
in it; particularly a Poem, relating the
History of <HI>Isaac</HI>'s Courtship and Marriage
of <HI>Rebecca;</HI> which has since been much
enquir'd for by some that had seen it.</P>
<P>My mentioning a Subscription, I believe,
occasioned her Poem, call'd <HI>Mopsus,</HI> or,
<HI>The Castle-Builder;</HI> and I indulg'd my
Curiosity in calling upon her often, to see
how she carried it on. It was really amaze∣ing
to see how fast she advanc'd in it; her
Thoughts seeming to flow as fast as she
could put them upon Paper; and I am per∣suaded,
that many beautiful ones have been
lost for want of Leisure to write them.</P>
<P>My expressing some Fear of being trou∣blesome
in coming so frequently, occa∣sioned
a great Variety of Invitations, both
<PB N="xxi" REF="19"/>
in Verse and Prose; which I could seldom
resist: And indeed her whole Behaviour
to me was so extremely good-natur'd and
obliging, that I must have been the most
ungrateful Person in the World, if I had
not endeavour'd to make some Return.</P>
<P>From this Time to that of her Death,
few Days pass'd in which I did not either
see or hear from her; for she gave me the
Pleasure of seeing all her Poems as soon as
they were finish'd. And though I never
was extremely fond of Poetry, and don't
pretend to be a Judge of it, there was
something so peculiarly pleasing to my
Taste in almost every thing she wrote,
that I could not but be infinitely pleas'd
with such a Correspondent.</P>
<P>Nor did I admire her in her Poetical
Capacity only; but the more I was ac∣quainted
with her, the more I saw Reason
to esteem her for those virtuous Principles,
and that Goodness of Heart and Temper,
which so visibly appeared in her; and I
was so far from thinking it a Condescen∣sion
to cultivate an Acquaintance with a
<PB N="xxii" REF="20"/>
Person in her Station, that I rather esteem'd
it an Honour to be call'd a Friend to one
in whom there appear'd such a true Great∣ness
of Soul as with me far outweigh'd all
the Advantages of Birth and Fortune.
Nor do I think it possible for any body
that was as well acquainted with her as
myself, to consider her as a mean Person.</P>
<P>I have sent a List of the Poems that
were wrote since I was acquainted with
her; which, I think, will shew the Quick∣ness
of her Genius, especially when it is
consider'd how much she was engaged in
her Father's Affairs, and the Business of
his House, in which she had nobody to
assist her.</P>
<P>This, you may imagine, was some Mor∣tification
to a Person of her Turn; yet
she was always chearful: And as she
wanted none of the Necessaries of Life,
expressed herself thankful for that. Her
chief Ambition seem'd to be to have such
a Competency as might leave her at Li∣berty
to enjoy the Company of a Friend,
and indulge her scribbling Humour (as she
<PB N="xxiii" REF="21"/>
call'd it) when she had a mind, without
Inconvenience or Interruption.</P>
<P>I could not see how much she was
straiten'd in point of Time for her Writing,
without endeavouring to remove the Dif∣ficulty;
and therefore propos'd a Sub∣scription
to some of my Acquaintance;
which I hoped might be a Means of do∣ing
it. And here, Sir, I must gratefully
acknowlege your kind Assistance, without
which I am sensible all my Endeavours
had been ineffectual; but through your
Good-nature I had the Pleasure to see it
brought into a promising Way before the
Death of the Author; who unfortunately
did not live to receive that Benefit by it,
which has since accrued to her Father.</P>
<P>Since the Publication of her Poems, I
hear she has been accused of stealing from
other Authors; but I believe very unjust∣ly,
and imagine the Censure proceeds ra∣ther
from a random Conjecture that it
must be so, than any just Foundation. I
don't find that the Particulars are pointed
out; and if there are really any Lines in
<PB N="xxiv" REF="22"/>
her Book that bear so near a Resemblance
to what has been wrote by other Authors,
as to give room for such a Conjecture, I,
that was so well acquainted with her
Way of Thinking, dare venture to answer
for her, that it proceeded from the Im∣pression
the Reading those Passages some
time before happen'd to make upon her
Mind, without her remembring from
whence they came; and therefore she can
no more be reckon'd a Plagiary on that
Account, than a Person could justly be
accused of being a Thief, for making use
of a Shilling or two of another's Money
that happen'd to be mix'd with his own,
without his knowing it.</P>
<P>Besides, I don't believe it impossible for
two People to think exactly alike upon a
Subject, and even to express themselves al∣most
in the very same Words for a Line
or two, without ever having been ac∣quainted
with one another's Thoughts;
tho' I don't know that this was the Case
of <HI>Myra.</HI></P>
<P>I must beg Leave to give you an In∣stance
of her Probity in this respect.</P>
<P><PB N="xxv" REF="23"/>
I one Day shew'd her an old manu∣script
Pastoral of Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>'s, in Blank
Verse; with which she seem'd much
pleased, and desired Leave to take it home
with her, and amuse herself with putting
some Parts of it, that she most liked, into
Rhyme. She did so<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Poems, Vol. I. p. 183, 187, 192.</NOTE>; and in my Opinion
so greatly alter'd and improv'd them, that
when the Papers were first sent to you,
in order to be printed, I said I thought
there was no Occasion for mentioning Mr.
<HI>Newton</HI>'s Name: But she would not con∣sent
to have them put in her Book with∣out
that Distinction; and indeed had no
occasion to adopt other Peoples Produc∣tions.</P>
<P>Deceit and Insincerity of all Kinds she
abhorred; and (if I may be allowed to
give my Opinion) I really believe what
she wrote upon Serious and Divine Sub∣jects,
proceeded from the inmost Senti∣ments
of her Heart; which I take to be
one great Reason of their appearing so ex∣tremely
natural and beautiful.</P>
<P>As an Instance of her uncommon Man∣ner
of Thinking, give me Leave to acquaint
<PB N="xxvi" REF="24"/>
you with a Discourse that pass'd between
us, when the Proposal for a Subscription
was on foot. I very gravely told her, I
thought we must endeavour to find out
some great Lady to be her Patroness, and
desir'd her to prepare a handsome Dedi∣cation.</P>
<P>“But pray, what am I to say in this
same Dedication?”</P>
<P>“Oh, a great many fine Things, cer∣tainly.”</P>
<P>“But, Madam, I am not acquainted
with any great Lady, nor like to be.”</P>
<P>“No matter for that; 'tis but your
supposing your Patroness to have as
many Virtues as other Peoples always
have: You need not fear saying too
much; and I must insist upon it.”</P>
<P>“She really seemed shock'd, and said,
But, Dear Madam, could you in good
Earnest approve of my sitting down to
write an Encomium upon a Person I
<PB N="xxvii" REF="25"/>
know nothing of, only because I might
hope to get something by it?—No,
<HI>Myra!</HI>”</P>
<P>She always call'd it being idle, and in∣dulging
her whimsical Humour, when she
was employed in writing the humorous
Parts of her Poems; and nothing could
pique her more than Peoples imagining she
took a great deal of Pains, or spent a great
deal of Time, in such Composures; or that
she set much Value upon them.</P>
<P>She told me, that most of them were
wrote when cross Accidents happen'd to
disturb her, purely to divert her Thoughts
from dwelling upon what was disagreeable;
and that it generally had the intended Ef∣fect,
by putting her in a good Humour.</P>
<P>I must now come to the melancholy
Scene of her Death; which, to my inex∣pressible
Concern, happen'd on the 12th of
<HI>November</HI> 1746. and was occasioned by
the Measles.</P>
<P><PB N="xxviii" REF="26"/>
A Day or two before her Departure,
while her Senses remained perfect, she de∣sir'd
to speak to me alone; and after the
warmest Expressions of Gratitude for my
Goodness to her, as she call'd it, continued,
as near as I can remember, in this manner.</P>
<P>“But I have still one Favour to beg of
you.—I find I am going.—I always
lov'd my Father; but I feel it now
more than ever.—He is growing into
Years.—My Heart bleeds to see the
Concern he is in; and it would be the
utmost Satisfaction to me, if I could
hope any thing of mine could contri∣bute
to his comfortable Subsistence in
his old Age: I therefore beg of you to
take the Key of my Buroe; and if any
thing is to be made of my poor Papers,
that you will, for my sake, endeavour to
promote a Subscription for his Bene∣fit,
which you so kindly have propos'd
for mine.”</P>
<P>They must have had harder Hearts than
mine, that could have refus'd to comply
with such a Request. I promis'd to do
<PB N="xxix" REF="27"/>
the best I could (with which she seem'd
satisfied); and have endeavour'd to per∣form
it to the utmost of my Power.</P>
<P>Since I received your Letter, I have
applied to Mr. <HI>Leapor</HI> for what Informa∣tion
he could give me relating to his
Daughter.</P>
<P>He tells me, She was born at <HI>Marston
St. Laurence</HI> in this County, on the 26th
of <HI>February</HI> 1722. at which Time he was
Gardener to the late Judge <HI>Blencowe,</HI> and
continued five Years in the Family; and
then removed with his Wife and this only
Daughter to <HI>Brackley,</HI> where she spent the
remaining Part of her Life.</P>
<P>She was bred up under the Care of a
pious and sensible Mother, who died about
four Years before her.</P>
<P>He informs me she was always fond
of reading every thing that came in her
way, as soon as she was capable of it;
and that when she had learnt to write to∣lerably,
which, as he remembers, was at
<PB N="xxx" REF="28"/>
about ten or eleven Years old, She would
often be scribbling, and sometimes in
Rhyme; which her Mother was at first
pleas'd with: But finding this Humour
increase upon her as she grew up, when
she thought her capable of more profitable
Employment, she endeavour'd to break
her of it; and that he likewise, having no
Taste for Poetry, and not imagining it
could ever be any Advantage to her, join'd
in the same Design: But finding it im∣possible
to alter her natural Inclination,
he had of late desisted, and left her more
at Liberty.</P>
<P>He says, she never had any intimate
Companion, except one agreeable young
Woman in this Town, whom she men∣tions
in her Poem upon <HI>Friendship,</HI> by
the Name of FIDELIA; and that she al∣ways
chose to spend her leisure Hours in
Writing and Reading, rather than in those
Diversions which young People generally
chuse; insomuch that some of the
Neighbours that observ'd it, expressed
their Concern, lest the Girl should over∣study
herself, and be mopish. But to me
<PB N="xxxi" REF="29"/>
she always appeared rather gay, than me∣lancholy.</P>
<P>I think it is now high time to apolo∣gize
for this long Letter: But as I was
resolved to send the best Account I
could, I hope, Sir, you will excuse me.
It is not for me to pretend to do Justice
to the Memory of Mrs. LEAPOR; but if
you think any of the little Incidents I have
mention'd will be useful to the Gentlemen
who have so kindly form'd that Design,
and give them a true Idea of her, I shall
be much pleased; and am, with true Re∣spect,</P>
<CLOSER>Your ever affectionate and
obliged humble Servant,</CLOSER>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I must beg Leave to enter a <HI>Caveat</HI>
against printing the Poem call'd <HI>Myra</HI>'s
<HI>Picture;</HI> because tho' she may be sup∣pos'd
<PB N="xxxii" REF="30"/>
to have made very free with
herself, I think it may give the Reader
a worse Idea of her Person than it de∣serv'd,
which was very far from being
shocking; tho' there was nothing ex∣traordinary
in it. The Poem was oc∣casioned
by her happening to hear that
a Gentleman who had seen some of
her Poems, wanted to know what her
Person was.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Leapor</HI> has put down a Grave-Stone
in Memory of his Daughter; and I
should be glad if any of the ingenious
Gentlemen you mention would be so
good as to write a few Lines to be put
upon it.</P>
<P>Mrs. LEAPOR'S whole Library consisted
of about sixteen or seventeen single Vo∣lumes,
among which were Part of Mr.

<HEAD>POEMS
ON
SEVERAL OCCASIONS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>On PATIENCE. To Stella.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>TILL, <HI>Stella,</HI> still, you sigh, and you
complain;</L>
<L>And mourn with real, or imagin'd Pain:</L>
<L>But, <HI>Stella,</HI> say, shall Things like You and Me</L>
<L>Repine at Nature's and at God's Decree?</L>
<L>Whose Goodness plac'd us in a quiet State,</L>
<L>Above the Wretched, and below the Great.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="35"/>
“But who are wretched?”—Why, Experience tells,</L>
<L>Our Bliss or Woe exists within ourselves.</L>
<L>Small Comfort feels the discontented Breast</L>
<L>From the gay Splendor of a shining Vest;</L>
<L>While some, whose Bodies lie expos'd to Air,</L>
<L>Whose Meals are slender, and whose Feet are bare;</L>
<L>Who want the needful Aid of Cloaths and Fire;</L>
<L>Yet sing in Want, and laugh in Rags and Mire:</L>
<L>These, blest with Ignorance and thoughtless Ease,</L>
<L>Small Things content, and low-born Trifles please.</L>
<L>Reflection ne'er disturbs their vulgar Mirth:</L>
<L>They view alike a Burial, or a Birth.</L>
<L>If these are happy from the Want of Thought,</L>
<L>Then <HI>Stella</HI>'s Wisdom is too dearly bought;</L>
<L>If Knowlege only serves to make her find</L>
<L>Those Ills o'erlook'd by Hundreds of her Kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But gracious Heaven by its Law assign'd</L>
<L>More Griefs and Glories for the noble Mind;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="36"/>
Where awful Reason gives a piercing Ray,</L>
<L>And clears the Spirit for a brighter Day.</L>
<L>Those honest Beams if we attempt to shun,</L>
<L>How shall we bear with an immortal Sun?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Patience follows, still to Reason true;</L>
<L>The Saint's best Virtue, and his Comfort too;</L>
<L>Who smooths the Ills from which she can't defend;</L>
<L>The Sick-man's Cordial, and the Poor-man's Friend.</L>
<L>This, <HI>Stella,</HI> This, will chear the aking Breast,</L>
<L>And slope our Passage to the Realms of Rest.</L>
<L>This helps the Good to look Affliction through,</L>
<L>Tho' Friends forsake, and Enemies pursue.</L>
<L>'Tis this that makes the gentle Bosom glow,</L>
<L>And rise superior through its Weight of Woe.</L>
<L>Let this, O <HI>Stella,</HI> chear thy drooping Soul,</L>
<L>While o'er thy Roofs the swelling Tempests roll.</L>
<L>The scatter'd Griefs shall in their Season fail,</L>
<L>And smiling Fortune turn the shifting Gale:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="37"/>
Far from thy Head the banish'd Storm shall fly,</L>
<L>And thou rest happy in a fairer Sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>Stella</HI>'s Spirit shall be taught to know</L>
<L>Joy's proper Medium, and to smile in Woe;</L>
<L>When her still Passions know their due Degree;</L>
<L>Then teach! O teach the happy Art to me!</L>
<L>Me, who from Thought to frolic Fancy skim,</L>
<L>Now wrapt in Morals, and now lost in Whim;</L>
<L>While a strange Group of mingled Passions sway,</L>
<L>That rule by Changing, and by Turns obey:</L>
<L>Yet, not abandon'd, I would do the best,</L>
<L>To aid the Weakness of this changing Breast,</L>
<L>And catch a Thought, its Errors to controul,</L>
<L>Before the Woman rushes on my Soul.</L>
</LG>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="5" REF="38"/>
<HEAD>PHOEBUS to ARTEMISIA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TO <HI>Artemisia,</HI> softest of her Kind,</L>
<L>With Woman's Features, but a nobler Mind;</L>
<L>A manly Soul, that's charmingly refin'd;</L>
<L>All Hail to Her—whom mortal Swains obey!</L>
<L>All Hail from Me—the Monarch of the Day!</L>
<L>For thee (lov'd Mortal), for thy sake we show</L>
<L>(Once more) our Lustre to the World below:</L>
<L>For thee we bid the sprouting Leaves appear,</L>
<L>And blushing Infants of the tender Year:</L>
<L>For thee the Floods glide more serenely by,</L>
<L>And gentler Zephyrs on the Branches die.</L>
<L>So be thy Heart (releas'd from every Ill)</L>
<L>Calm as the Winds, and as the Waters still.</L>
<L>Hear the Birds warble in delightful Strains,</L>
<L>To call my Fair-one to the healthful Plains.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="39"/>
Haste then! O haste! to <HI>Mira</HI>'s rural Bow'rs,</L>
<L>And my glad Beams shall gild the chearful Hours.</L>
<L>No sickly Blast shall taint the purer Sky,</L>
<L>Nor rattling Tempest through the Groves shall fly.</L>
<L>Come, thou dear Nymph, so long ador'd by me;</L>
<L>For (trust me) <HI>Daphne</HI> never charm'd like thee.</L>
<L>Come then! O, come! and dread no piercing Wind:</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Phoebus</HI> self has promis'd to be kind:</L>
<L>Come, when yon Dial points to Number Three;</L>
<L>For that's the Hour mostly blest by me:</L>
<L>'Tis then I shine with more propitious Ray;</L>
<L>Dispel the Clouds, and give a brighter Day.</L>
<L>So may thy Verse through distant Ages run,</L>
<L>Still the bright Image of its Parent Sun;</L>
<L>Whilst I with Pleasure shall its Birth declare,</L>
<L>And guard my Offspring with a Father's Care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But see, alas!—where lonely <HI>Mira</HI> weeps,</L>
<L>And to her Bosom pale Despondence creeps,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="40"/>
Lest you refuse—Be merciful—for She</L>
<L>('Tis true) I <HI>pity,</HI> tho' I <HI>love</HI> but Thee.</L>
</LG>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MAN the MONARCH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AMaz'd we read of Nature's early Throes:</L>
<L>How the fair Heav'ns and pond'rous Earth
arose:</L>
<L>How blooming Trees unplanted first began;</L>
<L>And Beasts submissive to their Tyrant, Man:</L>
<L>To Man, invested with despotic Sway,</L>
<L>While his mute Brethren tremble and obey;</L>
<L>Till Heav'n beheld him insolently vain,</L>
<L>And check'd the Limits of his haughty Reign.</L>
<L>Then from their Lord the rude Deserters fly,</L>
<L>And, grinning back, his fruitless Rage defy;</L>
<L>Pards, Tygers, Wolves, to gloomy Shades retire,</L>
<L>And Mountain-Goats in purer Gales respire.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="41"/>
To humble Valleys, where soft Flowers blow,</L>
<L>And fatt'ning Streams in crystal Mazes flow,</L>
<L>Full of new Life, the untam'd Coursers run,</L>
<L>And roll, and wanton, in the chearful Sun;</L>
<L>Round their gay Hearts the dancing Spirits rise,</L>
<L>And rouse the Lightnings in their rolling Eyes:</L>
<L>To cragged Rocks destructive Serpents glide,</L>
<L>Whose mossy Crannies hide their speckled Pride:</L>
<L>And monstrous Whales on foamy Billows ride.</L>
<L>Then joyful Birds ascend their native Sky:</L>
<L>But where! ah! where, shall helpless Woman fly?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here smiling Nature brought her choicest Stores,</L>
<L>And roseat Beauty on her Fav'rite pours:</L>
<L>Pleas'd with her Labour, the officious Dame</L>
<L>With-held no Grace would deck the rising Frame.</L>
<L>Then view'd her Work, and view'd, and smil'd again,</L>
<L>And kindly whisper'd, Daughter, live, and reign.</L>
<L>But now the Matron mourns her latest Care,</L>
<L>And sees the Sorrows of her darling Fair;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="42"/>
Beholds a <HI>Wretch,</HI> whom she design'd a <HI>Queen,</HI></L>
<L>And weeps that e'er she form'd the weak Machine,</L>
<L>In vain she boasts her Lip of scarlet Dyes,</L>
<L>Cheeks like the Morning, and far-beaming Eyes;</L>
<L>Her Neck refulgent—fair and feeble Arms,</L>
<L>A Set of useless and neglected Charms.</L>
<L>She suffers Hardship with afflictive Moans:</L>
<L>Small Tasks of Labour suit her slender Bones.</L>
<L>Beneath a Load her weary Shoulders yield,</L>
<L>Nor can her Fingers grasp the sounding Shield;</L>
<L>She sees and trembles at approaching Harms,</L>
<L>And Fear and Grief destroy her fading Charms.</L>
<L>Then her pale Lips no pearly Teeth disclose,</L>
<L>And Time's rude Sickle cuts the yielding Rose.</L>
<L>Thus wretched Woman's short-liv'd Merit dies:</L>
<L>In vain to Wisdom's sacred Help she flies;</L>
<L>Or sparkling Wit but lends a feeble Aid:</L>
<L>'Tis all Delirium from a wrinkled Maid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="43"/>
<L>A tattling Dame, no matter where, or who;</L>
<L>Me it concerns not—and it need not you;</L>
<L>Once told this Story to the listening Muse,</L>
<L>Which we, as now it serves our Turn, shall use.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When our Grandsire<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Leapor frequently writes the Words <HI>Sire, Fire, Spire, Hour,</HI> &amp;c. each as if two Syllables.</NOTE> nam'd the feather'd Kind,</L>
<L>Pond'ring their Natures in his careful Mind,</L>
<L>'Twas then, if on our Author we rely,</L>
<L>He view'd his Consort with an envious Eye;</L>
<L>Greedy of Pow'r, he hugg'd the tott'ring Throne;</L>
<L>Pleased with Homage, and would reign alone;</L>
<L>And, better to secure his doubtful Rule,</L>
<L>Roll'd his wise Eye-balls, and pronounc'd her <HI>Fool.</HI></L>
<L>The regal Blood to distant Ages runs:</L>
<L>Sires, Brothers, Husbands, and commanding Sons,</L>
<L>The Sceptre claim; and ev'ry Cottage brings</L>
<L>A long Succession of Domestic Kings.</L>

<HEAD>MOPSUS; or, The Castle-Builder.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN Days of yore, ere <HI>Britons</HI> grew too wise</L>
<L>To court proud Fortune, or believe in Lyes,</L>
<L>A Youth was born, his Father's only Son</L>
<L>(Well for his Sire he had no more than one).</L>
<L>This good old Man with Pleasure us'd to range</L>
<L>O'er the small Limits of his peaceful Grange:</L>
<L>His Calves and Oxen were his only Care,</L>
<L>His homely Servants, and his smiling Heir.</L>
<L>Now tall and strait the pratling Infant grew;</L>
<L>A sprightly Boy, with Cheeks of crimson Hue.</L>
<L>His Father plac'd him in a Country School,</L>
<L>To learn <HI>Division,</HI> and the <HI>Golden Rule:</HI></L>
<L>But when the fair aspiring Youth began</L>
<L>To walk on Tiptoe to the Verge of Man;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="45"/>
His discontented Thoughts began to rove</L>
<L>Beyond the Prospect of his Father's Grove.</L>
<L>In vain the Hawthorn spreads her snowy Pride,</L>
<L>And the pale Lily gilds the Fountain-Side:</L>
<L>He loaths the Country, and his Fellow Swains;</L>
<L>For mighty Projects fill his working Brains:</L>
<L>And when black Shade invests the sleepy Sky,</L>
<L>And the still Herds on dewy Hillocks lie;</L>
<L>When restless Nature finds herself repos'd,</L>
<L>And lazy Eyelids are in Slumber clos'd;</L>
<L>Then Fancy bore the metamorphos'd Swain</L>
<L>Far from his Neat-herds, and despised Plain;</L>
<L>By Slaves attended; drawn by shining Wheels;</L>
<L>With flowing Purple at his graceful Heels;</L>
<L>With royal Gold his manly Temples crown'd;</L>
<L>And thus the <HI>Monarch</HI> took his awful Round;</L>
<L>Till spiteful Morning rais'd her Infant Brow,</L>
<L>And call'd the <HI>Prince</HI> to guide his slavish Plough.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>Pride is a fav'rite Passion of the Soul.</L>
<L>Some latent Sparks and some minute Degrees</L>

<L>This Vice, when planted in a gen'rous Soil,</L>

<L>Our Souls are much more nice, tho' not so daring,</L>

<L>And stir them up to Rapture, or Disdain;</L>

<HEAD>LETTERS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by Mrs. LEAPOR.</BYLINE>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The following Piece was written by the Author
when very young.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">U</SEG>PON my lately reading a Discourse,
wherein the Author seemed to reflect
with great Severity on the Errors and
Vices of wealthy People, and at the same time
to congratulate the Poor, in that their Poverty
secured them against various Temptations, espe∣cially
Pride; some little Contradiction arising
in my Mind, led me insensibly into a Train of
Thoughts, which I shall present to the Reader
without any further Apology.—If we con∣sider
the Behaviour of Mankind, from the
Prince to the Peasant, we shall find the Seeds
of the same Passions, the same Virtues and
<PB N="304" REF="334"/>
Vices, in all Ranks and Degrees of Peo∣ple:
Pride is a kind of epidemical Vice in
the Minds of Youth; with which, in different
Degrees, all are possess'd, and exert themselves
according to their different Circumstances. A
new Gown, a lac'd Mob, a Necklace, and a
Topknot, are Felicities courted with as much
Impatience, and pursued with as great Anxiety,
by ordinary Females, as rich Brocades, gilt
Chariots, and powder'd Footmen, are by those
in a more conspicuous Station. The same Ob∣servation
may be made in the Male World;
and, in my Opinion, a new Surtout, or a modish
Wig, are Motives full as worthy to engage the
Attention of a reasonable Creature, as a Silver-hilted
Sword, or an embroider'd Waistcoat.
Wealth is certainly a great Blessing, when it falls
into the Possession of worthy Persons: It gives
a Lustre to those Virtues and Attainments, that,
without it, dwindle away, and are lost in Ob∣scurity:
It adds Reverence to the Divine, Au∣thority
to the Philosopher, Honour to the Sol∣dier,
and at least, his usual Recompence, Praise
the Poet. On the other hand, altho' the
modest Virgin, the tender Mother, the agreeable
Friend, and the pious Matron, are Gems that
will shew themselves to Advantage, even in a
<PB N="305" REF="335"/>
Cottage; yet how much more amiable are these
Accomplishments in a higher Station, when
adorned with Generosity, Learning, and a re∣fined
Behaviour! But then, as Virtue appears
in a more majestic Form by the Addition of
Wealth and Power; so the Vices and ill Qua∣lities
of People of Condition appear with a Face
of double Deformity, by reason their Behaviour
has a sort of Influence on the rest of Mankind.
I have before observed, that there is a Tincture
of Ambition in all Degrees; and those who
cannot come up to the Wisdom and Sublimities
of their Superiors, can at least imitate their Vices
and Imperfections. How shocking then is the
Behaviour of some Persons blessed with plen∣teous
Fortunes, good Understanding, sprightly
Wit, and Talents which, if rightly applied,
would distinguish them more from the rest of
Mankind, than the Number of their Acres, or
the Insolence of their Power; yet, charmed
with the mock Homage of their silken Slaves,
and stupid with intoxicating Pleasure, he gives
a Loose to his long-struggling Passions, to take
in Luxury, with its licentious Train! Discarded
Reason having taken her Flight, charmed with
his new Companions, the intoxicated Idiot
scarce believes he is mortal; Pride, Tyranny,
<PB N="306" REF="336"/>
and Rapine, follow; and Innocence and Beauty
fall unpitied Victims at his lawless Altar. Thus,
if pamper'd Vice makes so terrible a Figure,
how careful ought those to be, whom Provi∣dence
has entrusted with a larger Share of what
we call the Goods of Fortune, that they may
not, by their Example, corrupt the Minds of
those below them! For altho', as I have before
hinted, there are the same Inclinations to Ill in
all sorts of People, yet the Vices, as well as
Virtues, of the Indigent are not so visible, nor
so much regarded in the Eye of the World,
tho' they are of the same Consequence to their
own Persons; and neither Wealth nor Power,
Poverty nor Subjection, can secure us from
those Passions and Inquietudes so natural and so
painful to a thinking Being. Ambition is the
constant Torment of sprightly and aspiring
Minds: It haunts the Wise thro' all their varied
Systems of Philosophy, and reigns within the
Bosom of the Satirist, even whilst he ridicules
it as an unsatisfying and empty Folly. Provi∣dence
does not think fit always to bestow
Wealth upon the greatest Minds; but, on the
contrary, People of the best Capacities are often
under the Frowns, or at least the Indifference,
of Fortune: It is a great Happiness, when such
<PB N="307" REF="337"/>
Persons can suit their Minds to their Condition.
It is not in every one's Power to be rich; but
it is in every one's Power to be content, if he
will endeavour it; unless the Party be under
the immediate Hand of great Poverty, or real
Sorrow; and then I believe it scarce possible for
a Person that has any Taste of Happiness or
Misery to be truly easy, while he is under the
dreadful Apprehension of wanting the com∣mon
Necessaries of Life: But where Poverty
does not appear in such a frightful Shape, it is
a great Absurdity to lose the Taste of present
Enjoyments, by grasping and mourning for
Things beyond all Possibility of our ever obtain∣ing.
Those who cannot shine in a partial and
ingrateful World, may despise it; and, con∣scious
of their Innocence and concealed Per∣fections,
may, with equal Temper, look down
on Censure and Applause. This happy Virtue
will bear the Person who enjoys it safe thro'
the tumultuous Waves of Sorrow, Disappoint∣ment,
Censure, and Derision; and open a Pro∣spect,
thro' the Gloom that hangs about him,
to a more more joyful Scene of Peace, Justice,
and Immortality.</P>

<HEAD>On the Essay on Woman in Vol. II. p. 64.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Madam,</OPENER>
<P>I Have read your agreeable Raillery with much
Pleasure.—I must own your Weapons are
pretty keen; and I can find no better Defence,
than by turning some of them back upon my
Accuser.—First, as to the Whole: You are
very well acquainted with the Christian System,
and must know, that as I turned out naked my
<HI>youngest and most neglected Child</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Essay on Woman.</HI></NOTE> to your Mer∣cy,
you ought to have given it a Garment this
cold Season, and not upbraid its Poverty.—
Next, great Letters are my Aversion: I could
never write them well; and they always look
like a Parcel of misshapen <HI>Dutchmen.</HI>—Not∣withstanding
your Compliment, of seeing my
Picture in <HI>Pamphilia,</HI> I must affirm it is not
so.—Now to the Feast: You are not to sup∣pose
a Woman of <HI>Corelia's</HI> Character would
admit of Two Dishes upon her Table at once:
No; they are separate Meals; and the Pota∣toes
are not introduced as Sawce to the Pye.—
<PB N="309" REF="339"/>
Now, dear Madam, if you consider this, you
will find nothing inconsistent there.—Now
to the Muses: I don't call them to fortisy my
Walls against Wealth itself, but against Wealth
in such a Shape as we had then described; and
you are not to think, that Poets, who love Ease
and Pleasure, and the most gay Delights of Life,
should hate the only Means of obtaining it.—You
will pardon this Remonstrance from</P>

<HEAD>On her Verses being sent to London.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Madam,</OPENER>
<P>I Yesterday received a Letter from my Aunt,
who commends the Verses, as a Boy would
do his Firmity: “They are very good, and I
desire some more.” She is very sententious,
but seems uneasy thro' too much Business; and
has concluded her Epistle with a Brace of Lines,
which I shrewdly suspect to be stolen from St.
<HI>Matthew.</HI> They are these: “So you see, my
“Dear, I am cumbered about many things;
and you have chosen the better Part.” I cast
a languishing Eye upon the Waggon Yesterday.
It is impossible to express the Hopes, the Fears,
the various Conjectures, and Reveries, that your
humble Servant must undergo this important
Season. I am like the unhappy Gentleman
mentioned in the <HI>Guardian;</HI> and can scarce en∣dure
the bare Pronunciation of the Letter S:
The hissing of the Tea-kettle distracts me; and
if I meet a Goose, I shun him as I would a
Lion, or a Crocodile. I intend speedily to pro∣vide
a Quantity of Hysteric Drops, being ap∣prehensive
<PB N="312" REF="342"/>
of Fits at the Sonnd of the Post-horn.
I can't hear the Playhouse spoke of
without trembling; and shall not dare to look
into a News-paper, for fear of meeting with
the Name of <HI>Cibber.</HI></P>
<P>Yet, after all, <HI>Mira</HI> has her gay Intervals,
and an excellent Knack at Castle-building. In
short, if our Scheme succeeds, I intend to shew
my Public Spirit: As, first, I shall open two or
three more Windows in the College-Chapel,
and perhaps add another Isle to it. I shall erect
a few Alms-houses; and have some Thoughts
of founding an Hospital for indigent or distracted
Poets. I presume this will take up as much of
my superfluous Wealth as I can spare from the
Extravagance of a gay Retinue and splendid
Equipage, in which I intend to abound. Amidst
all this, I shall not be ingrateful, tho' perhaps
somewhat haughty. Yet my Chariot or Lan∣dau
shall be ever at your Service, and ready to
convey you to my Country-seat, or to my
House in <HI>Hanover-square.</HI> But, till all this
shall happen, I am proud to subscribe myself</P>

<HEAD>On her Writings being to be printed.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Madam,</OPENER>
<P>I Am sorry to hear you are not well, and am
afraid you are uneasy about the Success of
my Writings; which I should be grieved to
think of. Let the worst happen, I am but as
I was before: I shall eat as long as I can, and
sleep when I am easy. There is the same Air
for me to breathe in, and the same all-chearing
Sun. And as my few Acquaintance did not
take to me upon the Account of Poetry, so
they will scarcely fall off upon its ill Success.</P>
<P>Dear Madam, I thank you for your kind
Admonition: Yet I believe you mistook my
Intention; which was not to meditate upon
<HI>Homer,</HI> but, out of an excessive Curiosity (pe∣culiar
to my Temper), to know the latter End;
tho' I intend to read and digest him at a more
proper time. I beg your Pardon for scribbling
to you twice in one Day; but, as it is a Pleasure
to me to be talking to you, I hope you will par∣don
this, and many such Faults, in</P>

<HEAD>On the same Subject.</HEAD>
<P>I Am obliged to the Gentleman for his Criti∣cisms
on my Verse, and think they are most
of them right; and if it is not led to the
Flames, like many of its Predecessors, those
Lines which he has taken Notice of shall be
altered.</P>
<P>But as to what he observes concerning <HI>Ste∣phen
Duck,</HI> I am of Opinion, that it was not
his Situation, but the Royal Favour, which
gained the Country over to his Side; and
therefore I think it needless to paint the Life
of a Person, who depends more upon the Cu∣riosity
of the World, than its Good-nature.
Besides, the seeing myself described in Print
would give me the same Uneasiness as being
stared at. For this Reason, whenever my
Verses shall appear amongst the Public, I hope
they will excuse the Author in this Particular. I
hope the Lines will not fall greatly short of the
first-mentioned Number; for I made but a
random Computation; and there have been se∣veral
Papers wrote since that was made.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="345"/>
I send these Verses, not upon Account of their
superior Merit, but that they are of a suitable
Length; for I suppose it will be proper to print
Two, that the Reader may have some Variety:
Yet, if all or either of these are not approved,
I shall very willingly submit to the Decision of
your better Judgment, and will change them
for any other. I have very little Notion of
what will please the Public: But, if I might
speak my own private Thoughts, it is this:
That there was no need of a Specimen: For I
am sure there is no Paper of mine has any Title
to Perfection: They are only a Parcel of che∣quer'd
Thoughts, scarce tolerable when toge∣ther;
but, if we part them, they make a sad
Figure. But whatever be the Fate of my
Verse, the Endeavours of my Friends will be
gratefully acknowledged, and all Informations
gladly accepted. For altho' Self-conceit be
reckon'd the inseparable Companion of an Au∣thor,
I hope it will never (justly) be laid to the

<OPENER>Dear Madam,</OPENER>
<P>I Did not think to have finished <HI>Mopsus</HI> To∣day:
But, hoping it may divert you, and
as I had but a few Lines to write, I have sent
him out to make his Court immediately. 'Tis
true, he is but an uncouth Gentleman: But,
dear Madam, let his constant Desire to please
the Fair make up his want of Merit. I am to
confess, that I have drawn my own Picture in
many Places where I have described this un∣lucky
Hero. But it is a kind of popular Piece,
and may serve for many a real <HI>Mopsus.</HI> It is
impossible to guess at the Fate of this new-born
Son: But, as he was produced under your
Smile, he cannnot but thrive. You are to ob∣serve,
that I send him to you, as to a private
School, in order to receive his first Principles,
before I trust him in the Hands of more severe
Teachers. I hope your Health will soon per∣mit
you to go abroad. In the mean time, if
any thing of mine will entertain you, I am

<HEAD>Sent with the Psalm inserted Page 299.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Madam,</OPENER>
<P>I Have, in Obedience to your Commands,
endeavoured to put this Psalm into Verse,
at least the Sense of it. The Imitation (for it
can be called no other) does not begin till the
Tenth Verse, the latter End being much the
same as the Beginning. Perhaps you may think
it short; but I would not push the Theme too
far, for fear you should not approve it, it being
the first I ever threw into the Shape of an Ode.
It is not for me to do Justice to that sublime
Prophet: But, such as it is, I commit it to your
Judgment, and am ready to correct its Errors.
The last Verse is taken out of another Psalm.
Mrs.—has took the Play, in order to
carry to Miss—. It is a foolish Temper
in me; but I cannot help being uneasy at part∣ing
with a Piece I most value.</P>
<P>I have great Apprehensions, that the Ladies
won't think it worth their Care. In this Tem∣per
of Mind I cannot help sighing, to think,
<PB N="318" REF="348"/>
that my Way of Life obliges me to seek the
Approbation of a giddy World, and People
whose manner of thinking I am a Stranger to,
as well as to their Friendship. Those Lines of
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> now occur to my Memory, where he
professes only to consult the End of his Being,
and resolves to</P>
<Q><L><HI>Maintain a Poet's Dignity and Ease,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And see what Friends, and read what Books I
please.</HI></L></Q>

<HEAD>On the Son of Sirach, and the Prayer
of Manasses.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Madam,</OPENER>
<P>THAT I have not spoke to you these
Two Days, Face to Face, is the Occa∣sion
of this Scrawl. I am, as I always was,
mightily pleased with that sublime Book, called
<HI>The Wisdom of the Son of</HI> Sirach; and have a
a Mind to collect the Sentences that best please
me, and suit my Purpose, and write them in
my Table-book, in order to form a Poem in
the manner of Mr. <HI>Pope Messiah:</HI>'s But it shall
wait for your Opinion. You may perhaps
wonder that I should take it into my Head to
ask Leave to do what I have done for Years with∣out:
But you will consider, that I was resolved
to write, but yet had nothing to say: So that,
unless you will suffer me to be impertinent, I
must be silent; an intolerable Punishment to a
prating Humour.</P>
<P>There is another Part in the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> which
strikes me vastly. It is the Prayer of <HI>Manasses</HI>
King of <HI>Israel,</HI> in his Captivity. I don't doubt but
you have observed it, and am sure you must ap∣prove.
<PB N="320" REF="350"/>
I wonder why it was not admitted into
our Church-Services; for, in my Opinion, there
never was any thing more moving: Not all the
sacred Authors I ever look'd into, not the finest
Sentence in a well-written Tragedy, ever left so
deep an Impression on my Spirits, as the Senti∣ments
of this repenting King; tho' I don't re∣member
to have seen it mentioned in any Author;
and that methinks is strange. But I suppose the
Doubt is, whether this Monarch was the Author
or not. Be that as it will, the thing is in itself
excellent: The Style is pleasant, and has some∣thing
in it of modern Eloquence; and those
agreeable Repetitions awaken the Reader's At∣tention,
and leave a pleasing Anguish on the
Mind. In the Whole, it is the perfect Picture
of a wounded Soul: And <HI>Manasses,</HI> in his Chains
and Afflictions, is a greater Favourite of mine,
than all the <HI>Caesars, Cicero,</HI> or <HI>Cato</HI> himself.</P>
<P>I would beg of you, if you please, to send me
the rest of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> for I long to know the End
of the Fable; and I have Leisure To-day from
dirty Work. O law! how the Word <HI>dirty</HI> looks

<HEAD>Sent to a Lady in the Illness of that Lady's Mother.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Madam,</OPENER>
<P>I Can find no Excuse for sending you a Par∣cel
of Nonsense t'other Day, but Igno∣rance
of your Mother's Condition. I am too
well acquainted with your Mother's Temper,
not to feel for you in your present Circum∣stances:
And, if I was Mistress of any tole∣rable
Eloquence, would endeavour to reconcile
your Spirits to what must certainly happen to
you, to me, and to all Mankind; <HI>viz.</HI> a Sepa∣ration
from our Friends, at least so far as con∣cerns
our present Life and Enjoyments. I,
who cannot boast of a Heart so susceptible and
delicate as yours, have at least felt the Strength
of Nature in the parting Pang; and can assure
you from Experience, that (to a Soul capable
of strong Ideas) the Apprehension of this for∣midable
Evil is more terrible than its real Ap∣proach;
tho' I hope there is no immediate Dan∣ger:
But I would prepare you for the worst:
And, if my Arguments are silly, they proceed
from a well-meant Sincerity. In spit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all our
<PB N="322" REF="352"/>
Sorrow for the Loss of a good and worthy Per∣son,
there is a Consolation that will shine thro'
the Cloud, and reproach our Grief, as proceed∣ing
from a self-interested Motive. This Con∣sideration,
with the Help of Time, is a great
Allay to this afflicting Passion. To say you
have enjoy'd a Parent much longer than you
could probably expect, is nothing to the Pur∣pose:
We know habitual Converse makes the
Link more strong: And 'tis easier to part
with a Friend at Nineteen, while we are full
of aspiring Hopes, and gay Desires, than at a
riper Age.</P>
<P>All this is Nature; yet it is not Reason. If,
amidst that Whirl of Passion, in which the Soul
at such a time is usually engaged, we had Power
to reflect, we should think in another manner.</P>
<P>Another aggravating Circumstance which I
know presents itself to your Imagination, is
this: That your last Friend is now at Stake:
That in her you lose all the Tenderness of a
Relation; at least all that is worthy to be called
so. This is true. And I cannot tell how to re∣concile
you to this Misfortune better, than to set
before you the Pictures of numberless miserable
<PB N="323" REF="353"/>
Orphans, exposed in their tender Years to Hun∣ger
and Cruelty. But these Examples seem too
wide to make any great Impression on your
Mind. We will therefore leave the Wretched,
and turn our Eyes to those who are more pro∣perly
styled the Unhappy. If I might be al∣lowed
to make the Comparison, our Conditions,
in this Place, seem a little parallel: But, should
I survive my Parent, the Event would be very
different. You lose a fond Parent, that doats
upon you, and all the tender Comforts that
flow from her: I lose both that, and all the
Necessaries of Life: Left naked and defenceless,
without Friend, and without Dependence;
with a weak and indolent Body to provide
for its own Subsistence; and a restless Mind,
rack'd with unprofitable Invention. This is
no very pleasing Prospect; but I seldom dwell
long upon it.</P>
<P>I am now to beg Pardon for this long Epistle.
Dear Madam, if you find I can be of any Use,
this whole Frame, such as it is, is at your Ser∣vice,
at any Hour.</P>
<P>That you may not want these Consolations,
but long enjoy Health, Happiness, and a Mo∣ther,

<L>REST, gentle Shade: Thy Virtue, Wit,
and Worth,</L>
<L>Survive the Tomb, and dignify thy Birth.</L>
<L>Living, thy Virtue eas'd a Parent's Care;</L>
<L>Dying, thy Works suspend his dropping Tear,</L>
<L>Wit, pure as flow'd from Infant Nature's Tongue;</L>
<L>Just—not severe; tho' inoffensive—strong.</L>
<L>Such Worth as points to Man, what Heav'n de∣sign'd,</L>
<L>True human Greatness, Dignity of Mind.</L>
