<HEAD>THE Secret HISTORY OF THE <HI>October</HI> CLUB:</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">With some Friendly Characters of the Illustrious Members of that Honourable SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>THO' the Original of the Name by which these Honest Gen∣tlemen have thought fit to distinguish themselves from the rest of their Neighbours, might be diverting enough; and the World seems very curious to enquire into the begin∣ning of a thing which they have heard more of, and know less of, than of most Publick things now upon the Stage. Yet as it seems rather an Acci∣dent than an Essential to the thing it self, we shall not amuse the World with a particular Enquiry of that Nature, but leave it to fall in with other things
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
as most necessarily it will in the Course of the Story.</P>
<P>We might carry back the Enquiry we are now upon to the beginning, not of the present Reign, but even to the Re∣volution, nay, even to the beginning of our Unhappy Divisions in this Na∣tion into Parties; the consequence of which Enquiry, would be chiefly to shew, how in every Reign, in every Age, nay almost in every Year, New Parties have risen up among us; distin∣guished by New Names, tho' perhaps, easily to be resolved into the same Ori∣ginal Grand Division which the late King <HI>James</HI> left this Nation in, when former petty Divisions, being as it were stifled, some thought Buryed in the Great Revolution Strife, the Nation seem'd only divided into the Two great Parties, <HI>these</HI> Patrons of <HI>Liberty, those</HI> of <HI>Slavery.</HI></P>
<P>It may be necessary for the continu∣ing a Chain of Story, and to shew you the Connexion of things present, with things past, or Consequences with their Causes, to enter here into some little Historical Account of the Changes from that time, how they have depended upon one another, as Links in a Chain, to the present period of things; and this shall be done with Brevity and Plainness.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
No sooner was the Blow struck in <HI>Britain,</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> being Fled, the Convention of Estates had declared the Throne Vacant, and had the placing the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> in the Seat of the Government in their view; but a Third Party rose up and violently opposed it. We knew not what at first to call these People, neither did they give themselves any Name; tho' they might have been call'd <HI>October-Men</HI> at that time, as truly and with as just a Derivation as any now bear that Name: They were as much Enemies to the Tyranny and Dispensing▪ Power of King <HI>James,</HI> as other Men: They were Zealous to prevent the Invasion of Po∣pery: many, yea most of them, had joyn'd in the taking up Arms against their Lawful Sovereign; and in the In∣vitation given to a Foreign Prince to come over in a Hostile manner, and In∣vade their King, in order to put a stop to his Designs against the Liberty and Religion of their Country: Whether they did it from a clear view of the Su∣premacy of the Peoples Right to those Laws, or whether <HI>Nature had rebelled in them against Principle,</HI> Authors have not agreed about it, nor shall we at∣tempt to solve that Difficulty at this time.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Be that as it will, these Gentlemen carryed their opposition to the Abdica∣tion, a great length; they Voted against Declaring the Throne Vacant; they Protested against the filling up that Va∣cancy; they Disown'd the Entailing the Crown upon the Persons mentioned in the Act of Settlement; and many of them refused to acknowledge, or take the Oaths of Allegiance to the King and Queen. It is true, most of them in time having consider'd of the matter, and the Terms of the Oath rather requi∣ring a Passive than an Active Allegi∣ance, they came into the Oaths; some upon the Distinctions of a Right <HI>De Fa∣cto</HI> and a Right <HI>De Jure:</HI> Some moved by Interest and Advantage; some with Wicked Reserves of their Allegiance to King <HI>James;</HI> some one way, some ano∣ther; and some <HI>by far the Honester,</HI> stood out to the last.</P>
<P>It would be too long to give you the Arguments here which were used on both sides, to perswade a Complyance, or to justify a Refusal. We may send the LAITY to Examine the Doctrines of Divine Right, Indefeazible Title, and the Illegality of any Human Power, Su∣perseding the Right of the King; that he derives from, and is only accountable to God; that as by the Law, the King
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
can do no Wrong, so he can forfeit no Right; <HI>and the like:</HI> Arguments often exploded by the practice of those that have made the loudest Profession of them; yet that are still carryed on, and may be now call'd <HI>October Principles,</HI> as being again espoused by the Gentlemen, who we are coming to talk of. As to the CLERGY, we may refer them to the Learned Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> who after he had by Example and Arguments, led many warm <HI>but well meaning</HI> Men, to espouse the same Principle, and lose their Livings for adhering to it, left them in the List of State Martyrs, but excused himself; and professing himself a Con∣vert to Dr. <HI>Overall,</HI> fac'd about, took the Oaths, and sav'd a good Living, af∣ter he had ruin'd half a Province of the Clergy.</P>
<P>From this Original, sprung the first unhappy Distinction among us, <HI>since the Revolution,</HI> known by the Name of<NOTE PLACE="marg">First Name of Distin∣ction, <HI>Non-Ju∣rors.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Non-Jurors;</HI> but to our great Misfortune it did not end here; For as we noted above, many of the complying Gentle∣men retain'd their Principles, tho' they had for the Reasons abovesaid, taken the Oaths; And in spight of the Sacred Obligation, they went on in all Com∣panies, on all Occasions, and with un∣usual Openness, to appear for the Inte∣rest
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
and Party of King <HI>James:</HI> they In∣sulted, Ridicul'd, Bought, Sold and Be∣tray'd, both the King, his Interest, his Business, and the whole Nation.</P>
<P>The World having in no Age been used to a People of such Amphibious Politicks as these, Men were at a loss what to call them a great while: <HI>Non-Jurors they were not,</HI> for no Parliament could frame Oaths of any kind, but they would take them: They submitted to Oaths of Allegiance, Recognition, Association, Abjuration, Assurance, and every thing you pleased, <HI>Williamites</HI> they could not be, King <HI>William</HI> was their Aversion, and they would Drink King <HI>James</HI>'s Health as openly, as if they had seen him upon the Throne: From these Practices, they came to di∣stinguish<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Second Distin∣ction, <HI>Jacobites</HI></NOTE> themselves as his more parti∣cular Partisans; and there began the first Mention of the word <HI>Jacobite,</HI> as a Title justly given them, and which they quickly grew fond of.</P>
<P>It is no part of the Design to enlarge here, either in a Description of, or a just Exclamation against the Practice of those Men. The <HI>Non-Jurors</HI> Contemn'd them, but held their Peace, because they found they (the <HI>Jacobites)</HI> did their work for them; the rest of the World stood at Gaze at them, and look'd on
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
them as Men of no Principle, neither fearing God or regarding Man.</P>
<P>In order to the Brevity, we profess you shall expect no farther account of the Conduct of these People during the whole Reign of King <HI>William;</HI> how upon all Occasions they Plagu'd and Perplex'd him, how they Betray'd him abroad, and Embarrass'd him at home; how they Ruffled him on the Partition Treaty, Suggested his Desire to Rule by a Standing Army, Bully'd him on his proposals of keeping his <HI>Dutch</HI> Guards, forc'd him to give up his best Friends to their Fury; and at last, how they Insulted his End. Triumph'd in the manner, Drank the Beasts Health that gave him the Fall by which he came to his Death; and have since, offer'd innu∣merable Injuries to his Glorious Memo∣ry: These are things we choose to omit, not caring <HI>renovare Dolorem,</HI> to look back upon them.</P>
<P>After the Decease of King <HI>William,</HI> Queen <HI>Anne</HI> succeeding, and making a Speech to Her Privy Council at Her Accession, gives the whole Nation an Assurance of Her Royal Concern for their Prosperity and Protection of their Liberty, whether Church or Dissenters, as the effects of Her just Government; but being her self Educated in the
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Church of <HI>England,</HI> tells the Gentlemen of that Church, <HI>That those of them who were most Zealous for the Welfare and Interest of that Church, would thereby most recommend themselves to Her; and as the other should have Her Protection, so these would be sure of Her especial Favour;</HI> and more to that purpose, as may be seen in the Printed Speech more at large.</P>
<P>This gave such a Loose to these Peo∣ple, many of them being at that time Advanc'd unwarily to Places and Trusts, that they thought this word ZEAL, was an Authority to them, to run into all the mad Excesses that the mistaken Zeal of most Men, generally leads them into. This, as in all such Cases it generally has done, shew'd it self more particularly among the Clergy, and appeared especially Pointed at the Dis∣senters of all Sorts.</P>
<P>The Queen, who, <HI>God Bless Her Majesty,</HI> little thought, a Word so well meant, should raise such a ferment among her People; and that when the general Quiet and Peace of all Her Sub∣jects was Her true Design, these Gentle∣men should so mistake Her, as, without Distinction, to fall together by the Ears, with all their Neighbours, whether Churchmen or Dissenters, that would
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
not come up to their Height; took se∣veral steps, <HI>tho' all in vain,</HI> for the Cure of this Mischief: And first, Her Majesty in several Speeches on Opening the re∣spective Sessions, of Parliament, passing Bills, Prorogations of Parliament, <HI>and the like,</HI> took occasion to explain Her self, to assure the Dissenters, of Her Preserving INVIOLABLY their Tolleration, pressing all Her People to Peace and Union, and shewing Her Dislike of the Extravagancies aforesaid.</P>
<P>Many of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and indeed the best, most Judicious, Chari∣table, and well designing People among them, fell heartily in with these Mo∣tions, and earnestly pressed to others, as well as practiced themselves, the Peace∣able Temper their Sovereign exhorted them to; these thus manifestly distin∣guishing<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Third Distin∣ction <HI>High-Flyers, Mode∣rate Men.</HI></NOTE> themselves from one another, introduced more New Names of Sepa∣ration; the first were from hence called <HI>High Flyers,</HI> the other <HI>Moderate Men:</HI> and when afterward these Names began to be more particularly confined to Church of <HI>England</HI> Men, and no other, they were Abridg'd into <HI>High Church</HI> and <HI>Low Church.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourth Distin∣ction, <HI>High-Church, Low-Church.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>High Church</HI> Men, <HI>for so we are now to call them,</HI> upon this Behaviour of their Sovereign, manag'd themselves
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
quite another way; for instead of Obey∣ing the Exhortations of their Prince, they fell upon Her Majesty Her self; Reproaching the Queen, with forsaking the Doctrine She was brought up in; giving up the Interest of the Establish'd Religion; abandoning the Church, <HI>and the like:</HI> and to such lengths they run things, that they obliged Her Majesty, in order to preserve that Peace She had so constantly exhorted Her People to, to change Hands, and <HI>turn them all out.</HI></P>
<P>They went on however, notwith∣standing these Discouragements, Insulted the Queen and the Ministry, with Libels, Memorials, and Lampoons; and at last, brought that most Exquisite Lampoon upon themselves, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Tacking the Occasional Bill.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fifth Distin∣ction, <HI>Tackers.</HI></NOTE> Here they got a Fifth Distinction, as an addition to their Titles of Honour, and were called TACKERS, a name which rendred them Odious, not to the Government only, but to the greatest part of the Nation; and so low it sunk them, that in the next Election for Par∣liament Men, which followed the Win∣ter after, they lost the Game, were di∣stanc'd in all places; and when they came up to the House, appear'd so weak,
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
that they could not make any attempt in favour of their own Principles for some Years.</P>
<P>In this condition they remain'd above Four Years; and the Nation began to enjoy the Pleasures, as well as the Ad∣vantages of Peace at Home: This In∣terval produc'd wonderful Events, a continued Series of Victory and Success Abroad; an exalted Credit at Home, to such a Degree, as might well amount to a Prodigy, and be counted Miraculous; and above all, the mighty Transaction of the Union with <HI>Scotland;</HI> a thing, which when Future Ages shall enquire into, when the many Attempts that have been formerly made to bring such a thing on, shall be remembred; and how all the Wit and Strength of the Nation could never compass it before; will be reckoned among the greatest Transacti∣ons of the World.</P>
<P>In this State we continued, till the Party weary of their outed-Circum∣stances, finding their Interest become weaker and weaker, and seeing no hores of raising their Fortunes again, or bring∣ing themselves into Play by their own strength, they fac'd about, play'd a very Subtle and Unhappy Game, and but with too much Success; the rela∣tion
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
of which Story, if there was nothing else in it, might very well entitle this Tract to the Face it bears, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of a <HI>Secret History.</HI></P>
<P>The Whigs were now uppermost, and managed with a great deal of Glory and Success, as is Noted;—But <HI>Humanum est Errare.</HI> The Whigs that were out of place, in Obedience to the Curse of Mans Nature, could no more see their own Cause carryed on without having a hand in the Profit, as well as honour of the Management, than they could submit to the Administration of their Enemies. This Created Two Evils.</P>
<P N="1">1. It divided the Whigs into two Factions, which we shall here tell you might more properly have been confin'd to this Distinction, <HI>Whigs out of Place,</HI> and <HI>Whigs in Place;</HI> but to give it you in the Popular Terms as both sides were<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sixth Distin∣ction,</HI> Old Whig, Modern Whig.</NOTE> fond of having it be, and as it was re∣ceiv'd in common, they were distin∣guish'd into <HI>Old Whig,</HI> and <HI>Modern Whig.</HI></P>
<P>To explain this Unhappy Distinction, it may be necessary to note to you, that the <HI>Modern Whig</HI> was under∣stood to be the Ministry and all their Dependants; together with all those, who by the Proceedings
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
of the Government since the last Change at Court, were <HI>come over</HI> to act upon the Principles of Liberty and the Revolution; whether from Conviction of their own Reason, or from Knowledge of their true Interest, it matters not.</P>
<P>By <HI>Old Whig</HI> was understood, no more than the word exprest, <HI>(viz.)</HI> those who had ever been low <HI>Whigs</HI> from their Original, or at least from their antient Practice, as far back as the Reign before.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other Evil which follow'd this New Change, was, that the <HI>Old Whig,</HI> and the turn'd out <HI>Tory</HI> Party, from Principles however remote, fell in together, and joyn'd their Forces against the <HI>Modern Whigs,</HI> or <HI>Whigs</HI> in <HI>Place, Anglice,</HI> the Ministry.</P>
<P>This unhappy League, as it had no view to the real Conjunction of their Interest, any more than it had of their Principles; so it appear'd to be altoge∣ther Political, either side making use of the other as Tools, the better to com∣pass the ruin of the Party they oppo∣sed, with Resolutions to be equally false to one another, when their own end should be brought to pass.</P>
<P>From this way of coming together,
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
as no good could be expected on either side, so indeed, none followed to either side: The Mischiefs which have hap∣pen'd since, have all had their Rise and Spring from this corrupted Fountain. And as to make this plain, will naturally explain to the Reader the whole <HI>Phe∣nomena</HI> of the Court Revolutions which have happen'd among us since that time; and lead us down directly to the very Birth and Original of the People now in our view; it cannot be unpleasant to the Reader, to dwell a little with what brevity we can on this particular, which hitherto the World has been so little acquainted with.</P>
<P>You are now to understand the Mi∣nistry, and its Dependants, as before, under the Title and Distinction of <HI>Modern Whig,</HI> carrying on the whole business of the Nation, and as has been noted, equally Envyed, and equally Push'd at, by the <HI>Old Whigs,</HI> or <HI>Whigs</HI> out of Place, as by the Dispossest <HI>High Flyers, Jacobites▪</HI> or <HI>Non-Jurors.</HI></P>
<P>It might be ask'd, whether made the first Motion towards any Union be∣tween these Two? And that Enquiry might be answer'd thus; that being mutually Male-content for the same Reasons, and at the same Persons, the
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
nature of the thing, without the help of the Devil, <HI>tho' we shall not injure Satan so much, as to exclude him wholly from his just share in the work,</HI> seem'd natu∣rally to bring them together.</P>
<P>They not only continually in all Company, and on all Occasions, ex∣claim'd against, and ridiculed the Pub∣lick Administration, the Ministry, and the Queen her self; but they made the same things the reasons of their Com∣plaint, tho' perfect <HI>Antipodes</HI> in the Design and End.</P>
<P>It is true, they might be said to aim at the same end in one sense, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Dis∣placing and Turning out the Ministry; but it is evident, their remotest aim was, getting themselves in; with an unshaken Resolution of excluding the other Party who they joyn'd with, as will be unan∣swerably proved by the sequel of the Story.</P>
<P>In the Prosecution of this Design, we found my Lord <HI>H</HI>—whom we shall for that reason begin with <HI>(an Old Whig)</HI> making Annual Speeches, and by Print∣ing those Speeches, making the Clamour against the Ministry become Popular; spreading the reasons of their Dis∣gusts into the Mouths of the Vulgar; the <HI>High Flyers</HI> universally chim'd in with the Noble Mutineer, and he always
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
Voted with them in things, which at another time, his common Principles would not have left us room to expect from him; as particularly, against the Union, and for Dr. <HI>Sacheverell; Sed de mortuis nil nisi bonum;</HI> let his mi∣stakes sleep in his Grave: His being Dead, forbids us to examine the latter part of his Life, so fruitful of Demon∣strations to this Argument.</P>
<P>The matter began to grow to a height towards the end of the Parliament, 1707, and had its Meridian Altitude at the Election of the next; and it was something diverting, as far as Men may make merry with their own Disasters, to hear the <HI>Old Whigs</HI> exclaiming against the Means used to keep out the Pretender; and the <HI>Jacobites</HI> reflecting upon our being in an ill posture to oppose him.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> was the Scene where this Tragi-Comedy was Acted; the Division there, was the same, but under different Names, and a Distinction not much heard of in <HI>England,</HI> and therefore need∣ful also to be explain'd, that things may be made clear as we go. The Names of Distinction there, were <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Squadroni;</HI> the thing meant the same, they were both <HI>Whigs,</HI> one side as much Modern and as much Original as
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
the other: but as their Breach began upon other Occasions, so they appear'd divided to our hands; yet as to the business of the day, they fell in, whole and unbroken, with the general Divi∣sion; the <HI>Court</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> with the Ministry, or Modern Whig in <HI>England;</HI> and the <HI>Squadroni</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the Old Whigs in <HI>England,</HI> or Whigs out of place.</P>
<P>The Invasion had been attempted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was blown over, and the Election of the Parliament approach'd: The Heads of the Parties had met, and concerted Measures in <HI>London:</HI> The <HI>Squadroni</HI> falling in with the <HI>Juncto,</HI> (as the Heads of the Old Whigs were called here) told them, that they had the Go∣verning Interest in <HI>Scotland;</HI> that they had been drawn in by fine Words and large Promises, to Joyn, or at least ac∣quiesce in the Union; that without them it could never have been effected: and that now it was made, and over, Scoundrels gain'd both the Honour of it, and were rewarded for what they had little or no hand in: That they (the <HI>Squadroni)</HI> were universally neglected, he Publick Affairs of their Country ntrusted all with Worthless and Up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art Tools of the Court, Men of no
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
Influence in, or at all beloved by the Country: and they who had the leading Interest in their Country, as well as the governing Estates, and who had more than once serv'd the Crown in the most weighty Concern, where that Interest was to be try'd, were lay'd by, as either suspected or slighted: that now they, the <HI>Juncto,</HI> should see, that they <HI>the Squadroni,</HI> would give a turn to the whole face of Affairs on that side, and that they would return the whole Five and Forty Commons, and Sixteen Peers, of their own Party.</P>
<P>These being proposed as strict Allies with the Old Whig Party in <HI>England,</HI> prompted some to go a greater length, and perhaps, discover themselves farther than Men of their Parts and Penetration could have been prevailed upon to do. And being fully confident of Success, they fear'd not on both hands to receive the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Malecontent and Tory, as Auxiliaries, to assist in over Ballancing the Court; just as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> does now with the <HI>Turks,</HI> upon a Re∣solution to dismiss them when the Game was play'd.</P>
<P>The Clamours now rise high, and the Party Storms blew hard at my Lord <HI>Tr—r,</HI> at the Duke of <HI>M—h,</HI> and
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
at the Administration in general. Com∣plaining how they Engrossed the whole Management of Affairs, Invested the Queen, and made Her Majesty Inacces∣sible, except through their Means; made themselves the Eyes, Ears, and Mouth, by which She saw, heard, or spoke; and in short, had the whole disposal of things in their hands: how they boasted of having Command of the Na∣tional Credit, and by the Immense Sums they had amassed of their own, which they thrust all into the Government, they possess'd the Funds, and aw'd the whole Nation. How they ingrossed vast Profits by Places, Preferments, and In∣numerable Sallaries, (Lists of which they Printed) and by taking Bribes for the Disposal of others, by which the Nation seem'd the Property of a Fa∣mily; and they were in a fair way to be too Great for the whole Kingdom, if ever an opportunity offer'd, which might bear a proportion to the Great∣ness of their Ambition.</P>
<P>These were the common places of the times: Freighted with this Cargo of Complaints, the <HI>Squadroni</HI> went into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the <HI>Old Whigs</HI> here sepa∣rated themselves to propagate their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terest in the approaching Elections.</P>
<P>Nay, to such a height things came,
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
that some Persons of Quality here, find∣ing the Northern Detachment began to meet with Difficulties more than they expected, sent them down a Letter, bidding them not be bullyed by the pretences of Court Interest, and great Names; for the Q—Her self could not support THAT FACTION long. Whether the Persons who wrote it directed them to expose that Letter, or they used them so ill as to do it without leave, History has not made mention; but it was made Publick in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Copies handed about to all that had a mind to see it.</P>
<P>The Election came on, the Tories were not Idle; they Voted in all pla∣ces for the Old <HI>Whigs,</HI> and the Old <HI>Whigs</HI> for them; but the Battle went against them on every side: The <HI>Squa∣droni</HI> where distanc'd every where; tho' they left no stone unturn'd, yet of the Forty Five they could return but Eleven; and of the Sixteen, but Five; and of those Eleven, Five were <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and Two of the other Five. Most despicably low did the poor <HI>Squadroni</HI> stoop to have carryed their point in this Election. Proud <HI>Ormistonio</HI> stoops to the Footstool of his Highness the Duke of <HI>Palaccio,</HI> to get himself Voted in; performing the most dishonou∣rable
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
Condition, of giving his Vote against his Principles, and against his Friends, for Count <HI>Cornwa,</HI> as the Equi∣valent. We might give you many such Instances out of the Histories of those times, but this may suffice to prove the Fact.</P>
<P>Being thus disappointed and doubly beaten at their own Weapon, they came up to <HI>England,</HI> where their Allies had not had the Success they expected, tho' much better than they. These made it up a little, by making loud Clamours at the Injustice and Partiality of the other Party, boasting that they would unravel it all again in the Houses: That in the Commons, they had Nine∣teen Petitions to bring in, and that in the Lords, they had such unanswe∣rable Arguments to bring, that they would turn out the whole number at once.</P>
<P>This Buoyed them up some time; their Friends, the <HI>Juncto,</HI> waited a while to see if they could make it good; for give the <HI>Juncto</HI> their due, they stood by them as long as they could, consistent with their Grand Design, <HI>(viz.)</HI> their Interest.</P>
<P>But when the matter came to the Parliament, the <HI>Squadroni</HI> moved the Pity almost of their very Enemies.
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
When they came into the House they had nothing to say, nor any body to second them; nay, as some say, the <HI>Whigs</HI> began to edge from them, and no body cared to sit close to them, till at last they were forced to sit on the other side in the Tory Corner; a place, the Scituation of which, most People who were acquainted with the Geo∣graphy of the House at that time, un∣derstood well enough.</P>
<P>The effect of all their Boasts ended in this; that in the Upper House they obtained the M. of <HI>L</HI>—to be put out, and the M. of <HI>A</HI>—to be brought in, but not this either, till the last had made a separate Peace with the other Party, and had made his Submission in form to the great Tefftedar of the Nation the Evening before.</P>
<P>In the Lower House, they throng'd in their Petitions as they promised, but came so late, or manag'd so ill, that not one of them could be mark'd for a hearing that Session, and consequently not that Parliament.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ormistonio</HI> made many a soft Speech, full of nothing, according to his excellent Talent; and the Palatine of <HI>Jeriswallia,</HI> in the other extream, spoke in his natural thunder; but neither the unpolite sense of the last, or the
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
polite emptyness of the first, avail'd at all.</P>
<P>This History hitherto may pass for a Comedy well enough; but the Tragi∣cal part is yet to come; and indeed it has been fruitful of fatal Events to this Nation, as will yet appear in the whole course of this relation.</P>
<P>First, you are to observe, that what ever other Event this Management had, it brought into Play, and into the House, a set of <HI>High Flyers</HI> or <HI>Jaco∣bites;</HI> who from this time, so riveted their Interest both there and here, that tho' the <HI>Whigs</HI> brought them in, those <HI>Whigs</HI> could never get them out again; but they (the <HI>Jacobites)</HI> so fixt their Alliances with the High Party here, that they have not only stood their ground against their Patrons, the <HI>Squadroni;</HI> but have Overthrown Court <HI>Whigs, Squadro∣ni Whigs,</HI> and all together; making good the Text, that a House, <HI>or Party,</HI> divided against it self cannot stand.</P>
<P>But the Old <HI>Whigs</HI> on this side play'd a wiser Game; for finding which way things went, that their left Wing <HI>(the Squadroni)</HI> was defeated, and if they <HI>(the Junto)</HI> fought it out, they should be the more fatally overthrown, they vailed, went over to the Enemy. The Tefftedar of the Nation open'd a back
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
door and took them all in, and they shutting the door behind them, shut all their Friends out.</P>
<P>Thus the War ended between Old Whig and Modern; and it was strange to think, how in a few Months, we heard no more of the Distinction.</P>
<P>This was a Tragedy indeed to the rest of the Party, and many honest Gentlemen who had sided with them upon the first prospect of Success, was left to be ruin'd by the fury of the Modern or Court Whigs, whom they had justly incensed in so open an at∣tempt to destroy them. But the mis∣chiefs of this Division did not end here; indeed this was rather the beginning of the Scene; many Ages to come, may not <HI>for ought we know,</HI> see the end of it.</P>
<P>The Ungenerous and Impolitic Con∣duct of the <HI>Juncto</HI> in this Case to their Friends, was remarkably Scandalous; for they hardly ever concern'd them∣selves so much as to enquire how they resented it. Their business was, to se∣cure to themselves that which, as was before noted, caused the first Discontent among them, <HI>(viz.)</HI> a share in the Ma∣nagement; and this being obtain'd, they made no more stir, provided for not one of their Friends that had espoused them, and hardly protected them from
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
the Consequences of their former ap∣pearing in it as above.</P>
<P>The universal regret at this treatment, laid the foundation of several Specula∣tions among Mankind.</P>
<P N="1">1. Their Friends saw that these were not Men to be trusted; that having thus used Men that had so faithfully serv'd them, there was nothing to be expected from them; accordingly these began every day more and more to fall off from them, as Men not worth ser∣ving, till at last they left them naked of a Party, by which they became an easy Prey to their Enemies, the High Flyers, who they themselves had unwarily brought into Play as above.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Treachery of it brought a Scan∣dal, not upon themselves only, but upon the whole Body of the Whigs in Gene∣ral, tho' the <HI>Squadroni</HI> have since wip'd off the Soil of it from themselves, by a steady Adherence to their former Prin∣ciples, and an unanimous Conjunction in the last Election against their Ene∣mies, the <HI>Jacobites; but it was too late.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The resentment at the Usage they met with in this Case, carryed many off
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
from the general Interest of the Whigs, and so strengthned the hands of the High Flying Party, that in the great Tryal of Skill about <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> that Case was lost by the Desertion of those who had been used ill in this very af∣fair; such as the D—kes of <HI>H</HI>—and of <HI>D</HI>—The M—quis's of <HI>L</HI>—and <HI>A</HI>—The E—Is of <HI>W—R—M</HI>—and many others.</P>
<P>Thus the whole overthrow of the Whig Interest, was owing to the Self-Interested Management of the Whigs themselves; and the letting in a Flood of <HI>High Flyers</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> became ne∣cessary to dismount those who were got in: even contrary to the true De∣sign and the first Scheme of the alterati∣on, which was only to have deposed the Exorbitance of a few Men, but to have continued the management of Af∣fairs in the Hands of the Disinterested Honestest Men of both sides, without respect to <HI>VVhig</HI> or <HI>Tory;</HI> and so all things had stood as they did before, and the Change had been no other but what the <HI>VVhigs</HI> themselves had declared necessary, by the attempt they made as above, to do the very same thing.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="30"/>
This is farther apparent, by the fre∣quent Applications made by the first Movers in this new Turn, to accommo∣date Matters, and settle the Administra∣tion with as few Changes as possible; in which it was apparent, not so many Alterations were design'd, as they themselves had proposed to make be∣fore; but they were Inflexible upon the Presumptions, that the Change could not be carryed on, but would run the Contrivers upon inextricable Labyrinths, Difficulties, and Distresses; and that the Queen would be driven back upon them again, by the Nature and Consequence of the thing. In which it is evident they have taken their Measures wrong also, and been disap∣pointed as much as before.</P>
<P>However, had they been wise enough to have harbour'd themselves in a timely manner before the Storm blew, they had saved the Nation, as well as them∣selves; an unhappy Proof, that the former has not been always the main view even of any Party, but that either have in their turn, thought fit to make some Sacrifices as they have thought their Interest has required.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="31"/>
From hence it is apparent, and it is one reason why we have been so plain and particular in this account, that the present change, being <HI>as it is for a while,</HI> Tory and High Flying, is not owing at all to the first Design, which was quite otherwise, but to the necessity which the untreatable Temper of some Men drove the new Gentlemen to, who were compell'd to take in one side, since the other had refused; and to act in concert with them, till the other shall come to themselves, that they might not expose the New Ministry in the Youth of its Administration, to be crush'd be∣tween Two Parties while it appear'd to joyn with neither.</P>
<P>If this looks a little like what a bitter Writer, <HI>the Review,</HI> calls making Tools of some Men, it is only of such who want temper to act from proper Mea∣sures, for the establishing their Country; and who being brought into Business, to act in the Sphere of Wise Men, cannot distinguish themselves from what they were in their own Country, with the Vicar, and among the unhappy Drink∣ers of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>It's plain, the new Schemes are built (however acted) on a right Principle,
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
so far as it may be made practicable in this unhappy Nation, <HI>(viz.) That Go∣vernment should be of no Party.</HI> We shall not enquire into the private tem∣per of the Persons brought in, but so far as they act upon the foundation above, so far they act right. If for the present they are driven to the ne∣cessity of sheltring under one Party more than another, the Power of Par∣ties been unhappily grown too great to be at first wholly neglected, it is either with a design wholly to throw them off at last, as a Man leaves off his Cloaths by degrees as the Summer advances, and the heat of the Season brings him out of danger of taking cold: OR, which we speak with concern, those who have so boldly pusht at this change, and hi∣therto have taken their aims so right, must faint in the carrying it on, and the whole must miscarry.</P>
<P>Having thus brought you down by many, and perhaps some of them, un∣trodden paths of the several Parties who have been accessary to the present Re∣volution of Affairs, it is necessary to enter a little into the other side of the story, and examine the conduct of the
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
<HI>High Flyers,</HI> so far as it may concern the affair in hand.</P>
<P>The Divisions and Animosities among the Whigs, having weaken'd their In∣terest, lessened their Number, disjointed and enervated their strength, and left them in no condition to defend them∣selves, the Attack is made, and they are overthrown as you have heard.</P>
<P>And now we have a new War be∣ginning among us: For the Tory Party, who as we noted, were taken in as Auxiliaries, for the securing this work, and striking this blow home; they find that the view they had in the proceedings, is not likely to be attain'd, and now they set up for Male contents. They see the Government begins to settle, that the grand Point is gain'd, and that the Plunder, the Blood, the Persecution, the Impeaching, and the Ruin of Families, Churches, &amp;c. which they hoped for, and promised them∣selves the pleasure of, is not in the Project. And they turn Chagrin, Un∣easy, and Discontent.</P>
<P>It was sometime that <HI>Picolomin,</HI> a Northern Hero of <HI>Gothic</HI> Original, had
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
waited in Town, big with expectation; that according to assurances given him, as soon as the Parliament came toge∣ther, the Commons would not fail to vote in the Pretender; and that the Queen coming to the House of Peers, should declare, she could no longer in Conscience detain the Rightful Domi∣nions of Her Brother, but that She had resolved to demit in his Favour. That at the same time, his Young Majesty should appear under the Protection of the Life Guard, and should forthwith be Proclaim'd by both Houses.</P>
<P>But finding things go quite contrary to his expectation, and that even his dear friends, on whom before their Ele∣ction he depended much for the cer∣tainty of this, were with the first, in Voting an Address to stand by the Queen, against all Her Opposers, and for carrying on the War, &amp;c. Finding the Pulse of the Court run high, as ever, against <HI>France,</HI> and no visible appearance in Her Majesty, of an Incli∣nation to Abdicate the Throne, he has walk'd about like a Ghost for some Weeks; he is observ'd as he goes, to mutter Old <HI>Greek</HI> Verses, and has some∣times
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
been over-heard in broken Sounds, to bring out <HI>Acheronta Movebo;</HI> he seldom stirs from the HOUSE, but walks much by Moon-light, talks to the Stars, calls frequently upon the Devil, and beats the Heels of his Shoes off against the ground: If he goes to the Coffee-House, they hide the Votes and Minutes from him immediately; for he never reads them, but he fastens his Teeth upon them, and gnaws them in pieces with the oddest Convulsions and Distortions in his face imaginable.</P>
<P>He happen'd some time since to be walking, whether to or from the House, the Learned are not agreed about it; but he meets not far from the place call'd HELL, an Old Friend of his of <HI>Saxon</HI> Race, Cousin <HI>German,</HI> about a thou∣sand times remov'd from King <HI>Edgar,</HI> and still bearing his Coat of Arms. They embrace with a great deal of warmth, but with something more so∣lemn than in usual Salutations; there sat upon both their faces, something of Fury and inexpressible Perturbation; and tho' they were hearty in their Ca∣resses to one another, yet to a critical Observer, it look'd a little like the Sa∣lutation
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
of Two Friends that happen after long absence to meet together at the Gallows.</P>
<P>After mutual Embraces, a By-Stander would have expected they should have spoke, but broken words interrupted with the strong firmentation of their Spirits, stifled one another; and they stood grining and making signs to one another like Two Mutes. At last, Dam 'em says <HI>Pico;</HI> Confound them says <HI>Edgar;</HI>—Shall we—says <HI>Pico?</HI> No says <HI>Edgar;</HI> Plague says <HI>Edgar;</HI> Devil, says <HI>Pico;</HI> and thus Rage and Curses took up the Conver∣sation for some time; and unable to speak out, they Hesitate a while, when recovering a little <HI>they go on.</HI> Will you meet us says <HI>Edgar?</HI> Where says <HI>Pico?</HI> At the <HI>Bell</HI> says <HI>Edgar?</HI> How strong are you says <HI>Pico?</HI> Twenty, and Increasing says <HI>Edgar.</HI> Have you any Members yet says <HI>Pico? Pox! Devil!</HI> says <HI>Ed∣gar, and shakes his head;</HI> we shall—what's the word says <HI>Pico? OCTOBER</HI> says <HI>Edgar,</HI> and so they part.</P>

From this small Original, is produc'd so Noble, so Honourable a Society as the <HI>October</HI> Club; they began at Hell, were <HI>at first</HI> composed of Rage, Fury, and Bitterness; but gradually proceed∣ing by Noble and Mutual Improve∣ments, <HI>they are come now</HI> to be the Hum∣blest, Tamest, and most Harmless Soci∣ety in the World.</P>
<P>At this happy Period I shall conclude the first part of this Story, as being an Interval proper enough to stop at, while some little Digressions may gra∣dually introduce Great and Momentous Affairs, upon which this Assembly have employed themselves.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>IT may seem reasonable to expect, upon so extraordinary a figure as these two forementioned Gentlemen made at their first Salutation, that their farther Conferences, would in some measure partake of the temper they ap∣pear'd then to be in. And we shall not be deceived in the Consequences, as will appear in the sequel of the Story; wherein the several Fermentati∣ons, Excesses, Extravagancies, and Di∣stractions, which appear'd in Miniature in these first Embraces, of our two aforesaid Members, will come to be seen in full Perspective; and the Na∣ture, Foundation, Progress, and per∣haps something of the fate of this Glo∣rious Society, be set in a clear view to the World.</P>
<P>Here we shall see at large their Prin∣ciples, their Pretensions, the Grounds and Reasons of their Discontents and
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
Exclamations; the Methods of their expressing their Resentment; of their proposed Remedy, the Schemes of their Wise Politicks, their Expectations from, and Disappointments in the new Re∣volution of Affairs.</P>
<P>Nor may it be unprofitable in the process of these Sheets, to enter a little into <HI>the Philosophy of this Society,</HI> and shew how, sometimes, by <HI>venting</HI> and giving a <HI>loose</HI> to the Rage and Passions that oppress Mens Souls, they arrive at a more happy power of Government of themselves <HI>than they had before:</HI> It is not unusual, as by the Experience of many Learned Physicians has been pro∣ved in the Cure of Lunaticks, that some kinds of Frenzy can only be cur'd by raising the Madness up to an height beyond all possible restraint; and then putting the Patient into a proper place where he can hurt no Body, nor him∣self, provoke him to rave at an ex∣cessive rate; and it is very usual, when that fit is over, <HI>the Person is reduc'd,</HI> recovers, and will seem perfectly well again for a considerable time.</P>
<P>This has been tryed most experimen∣tally
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
upon our Two Members above. Members! said Sir <HI>John Cautious,</HI> who stood by while this Story was a Copy∣ing for the Press; <HI>what do you mean?</HI> Upon my word, if you come to Refle∣ctions upon the Members of Parliament, I will not keep you Company; I am a Member of P—nt my self, and I know better than any of you, the Tem∣per of the House; they are all very honest Gentlemen, and I will no more hear any thing reflecting on them <HI>with∣out doors,</HI> than I will betray what is done <HI>within doors;</HI> much less, be ac∣cessary to the publishing any thing of that kind.</P>
<P>As this Gentlemans Rage was some∣thing surprizing, so the mistake was so obvious, that the whole Company fell a laughing at him; but knowing him to be of a temper something Revenge∣ful, they thought it was not Prudence to provoke him, so they told him they wondred he should take the word MEMBER in so restrain'd a Sense; that it did not at all follow, they must mean Members of Parliament every time they named that word; nor was it so in fact: that every body knew there
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
were several Clubs in the Nation, and made up of several sorts of People; such as the Calves-Head Club, the Ja∣cobite Club, the Scandalous Club, the Witty Club, the Merry Club, the Ugly Club, and the <HI>October</HI> Club, <HI>cum multis aliis,</HI> &amp;c. and that it could not be ta∣ken in that sence now, because it was well known there was no such thing as Members of P—nt among any of these.</P>
<P>These Arguments were so cogent, as pacifyed Sir <HI>John,</HI> and so we were suffer'd to proceed with our Two MEM∣BERS as aforesaid, who as is already observed, were so full, so warm, so eager, that when they met, they could do nothing but <HI>rave,</HI> bring out broken Curses, and shew all the signs of exas∣perated Spirits, that the fury of their Temper could bring forth.</P>
<P>It may be necessary for the far ther illustration of this History, to let you a little into the general conversation of the Society, and give some account of particular Passages occurring at some extraordinary meetings, and then we may touch at the Characters of some of their Persons.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="42"/>
You have heard from the abrupt meet∣ing of <HI>Pico,</HI> and the Old <HI>Saxon</HI> Count, <HI>Edgar,</HI> that they were Discontent, Sha∣grin, and Enrag'd; and that they met at a certain House, to vent and give ease to their Passions. It was not long in a time of such eminent Jealousies, but that a constant meeting of Gentle∣men of such good Figure and appear∣ing Interest, must occasion divers Spe∣culations; and the Town began to en∣quire who they were, what their Busi∣ness was, and on what Design; but particularly, as most natural to the temper of the time, <HI>what Party they were of.</HI> The word <HI>October</HI> being left always at the Bar, as the token of Ad∣mittance, was consequently the first thing belonging to them that became Publick: Which led the World into a small Error about them. The Occasion was this.</P>
<P>The Observator's Country-man, ha∣ving some Years ago worn that word thread-bare, in his very empty Witti∣cisms upon Friend or Enemy, it was <HI>from thence</HI> at first by way of Scandal given out, that this was a Whig Club. This in∣deed serv'd to let Wiser-Men know, that all the Torles were not of a Piece; and
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
that there were some in the World, who tho' they were far enough from Whigs, were not let into this Secret; that they knew nothing of the Design, and by consequence, had not Access to the Cabinet Councils of their own Party.</P>
<P>For as these Gentlemen had no De∣signs but what they had openly enough proclaim'd to the World, so it was far from being design'd to make their ha∣ving Associated together a Secret, or at least for any long time.</P>
<P>It is true, in the Infancy of the So∣ciety, they met frequently at several Houses; sometimes at the—in the <HI>Strand;</HI> sometimes at the <HI>V</HI>—some∣times at the <HI>D—l,</HI> sometimes at one place, sometimes at another; and after∣wards, separating into small Commit∣tees, they had their private and prepa∣ratory Meetings, in order both to en∣crease the number of the Society, and prepare business for the general days of their Assembling, that it might meet there with the greater Dispatch. At these separate Meetings, they frequently drank the <HI>Plebeian</HI> Juice of the Barly Corn,
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
prepar'd at proper Seasons in the latter end of the Summer, and carefully pre∣served for maturating it self by fermen∣tation, Setling, Fining, Sparkling, &amp;c. And from hence some have imagined, they received their <HI>Nomme de Guerre, (viz.) OCTOBER;</HI> But Authors of more Authority affirm the contrary; and that the original of this Honourable Title, was derived from that word be∣ing given by some of their leading Men, as the signal of their congrega∣ting together, and the term of Ad∣mission, of which more by and by.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, having thus brought them to their Collective State, it fol∣lows to enquire who they were that composed this Body; who the consti∣tuent Members, and what the Occasion of the meeting: We shall begin with the last; and perhaps, the Persons may best describe themselves by their beha∣viour, when we come to the subject matter of their wise Conferences.</P>
<P>We need not trouble the Reader with Negatives in this Affair, as that they <HI>mere not</HI> Whigs, <HI>not</HI> Papists, <HI>not</HI> Presby∣terians, <HI>not</HI> Non-Jurors, that met at this Assembly; that their profest Busi∣ness was neither Wine, Love, Game,
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
Music or Mirth. But to come directly to the Point: they met to consult on matters of State, Government, Poli∣ticks, Credit, War, Peace, Funds, Fa∣vourites, Parties, <HI>a little</HI> of Religion, <HI>much</HI> of Court Matters, more of Mini∣stry, and most of all, of Interest: in short, they met to consider in full As∣sembly, the State of the Nation.</P>
<P>It has been reported, that they took great pains to bring in among them, abundance of Parliament Men, but that not being able to bring that to pass in such a degree as they desired, they made themselves amends out of the Court; and that the Queen had the misfortune to find many of Her Majesties own Ser∣vants, who eat Her Bread, and depend∣ed on Her Royal Bounty, made Mem∣bers of this black Divan; and in close Consultation against both Her Person and Interest. The brief History of which, take as follows.</P>
<P>It has been noted in the first part of this Tract, that upon the late Revolu∣tion of Court Affairs, the Pulse of a certain Party run high, having given the Whigs a general overthrow, as in a pitch'd Battle, deposed the Ministry
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
disbanded the <HI>Juncto,</HI> and gotten the Mob on their side, they thought the Game all their own; nor were they in the least mistaken, for so it was.</P>
<P>But they had no sooner look'd over their hands, <HI>as they say at Cards,</HI> and found they had all the Trumps, Court Cards, and almost every thing they could wish, but elated with their good fortune, they began to throw their Cards away like Mad Men; and ac∣cording to their ancient wild Practise, to ruin their own game.</P>
<P>But some better Gamesters among them of their own side, seeing their Follies, clapt in, snatch'd the Cards out of their hands, and undertook to play the Game for them.</P>
<P>Ill luck was it for the Whigs, that these mad Gemesters were not permitted to go on, for they would have play'd away all their good Cards at first, and the cunning Whigs who play'd upon the reserve, and had husbanded their Game, would have come in at last, and have beat them all.</P>
<P>But wiser Gamesters taking up the Cards, they hold the advantage they
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
had gain'd, and the Whigs are in danger of being lurched.</P>
<P>But to leave Allegorizing, the Case is literal enough, and may be told as plain as we please. The Queen having thought fit to change Hands in the Administration of Publick Affairs, and to put the Ministry into the hands of a New Set of Men: Of which New Ministry, it is not the Business of this Paper to say any thing one way or another. This was the consequence.</P>
<P>The deposed Party strugled hard, and gave up their ground by Inches; defending every Step, every Point, dis∣puting every Post, and maintaining their Interest as long as possible.</P>
<P>The Party that Supplanted them, were not so much of the Old High Flying Principle, as they were upon a New System of Politicks, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of putting the Administration upon what they called an equal foot; that no Party should engross either the Queen or Government; that the Favours, and Employments, and Trust, should be promiscuously granted and bestow'd upon all Parties; and the best of all
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
Parties be employ'd while the Govern∣ment it self should be of no Party at all. This was called the new Scheme, and according to this Scheme, the new management began to work.</P>
<P>It happened rather as a consequence of things, than by choice of the new Management, that they were obliged to take in the assistance of all the High Party, to make good their ground against the Old Ministry, and their Friends, who as I said <HI>dyed hard,</HI> made an obstinate Defence, and would heark∣en to no terms of accommodation; ne∣ver yielding to take Quarter, tho' fre∣quently offered them upon very Advan∣tagious Conditions.</P>
<P>The New Managers being thus dri∣ven to the necessity of calling in help to make good their ground, were ob∣liged to treat with the other Party, <HI>viz.</HI> the hot High Flying hair Brain'd Tories, whom they thought in this Exigency, they might purely on the Principles of Hatred to the Whigs, bring in at demand.</P>
<P>To wheedle them into this, <HI>for they knew they were easily to be caught,</HI> they
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
baited their Hook with a roasted Priest, set him to cry Fire, and raise the whole Nation into a Flame; immediately the bubbled Party bit at the Bait, and away they run with it, without so much as feeling that the Hook hung in their Mouths.</P>
<P>The cunning Anglers play'd with them, as you do with a Trout; let them run on, let them raise Mobs, Tumults, break Windows, pull down Meeting-Houses, bully the Dissenters, rabble Elections, huzza the Tool a∣foresaid round the Country; and in short, put the whole Nation into a Flame.</P>
<P>Sometimes they would draw their line a little, and bring them nearer hand, and almost to their Net, putting several Mortifications upon them, with fine Speeches, Addresses to STAND-BY, &amp;c. Tryals of Rioters, Promises to keep the Peace, hints of Temper to fellow Christians and fellow Subjects, <HI>(Dissenters)</HI> Discouraging and Negle∣cting the Priest and his Friends, and the like. These things went against the Grain, and touching them to the quick, away the Party would fling
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
again, and flounce, and be in a rage, like a Lunatick. <HI>Well,</HI> then the State Anglers would try to tickle them <HI>still as you do a Trout;</HI> give them a Sugar∣plumb word or two, in an Address put in Faction, as an Equivalent to Popery, Exemption for an Equivalent to Tolle∣ration, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>This pleases them again, and they come to hand for a purpose, but it lasts but for a while; when feeling the Hook prick them a little, and the very thought of Moderation putting them into a fright, they take a run again, and away they go, carrying all before them; the cunning Workmen <HI>let them go,</HI> run out the line. Let them over-run the Presbyterian Judicatures, reverse Decrees, and let loose Bears upon the honest <HI>Scots</HI> Sheep; and in short, let them play the Devil till they run themselves out of breath a∣gain.</P>
<P>After this, they begin to draw them to hand again: And with many a lusty promise, they brought these furious People to be something tame, to come into Management, and to be true Aux∣illiaries. Many a Sugar-plumb, as be∣fore, was they fain to give them; ma∣ny an Opiate to doze and delude them;
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
they learn'd the Language of the Party, and cry'd, <HI>Hereditary-Right, Passive-Submission,</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> as fast as any of them: In Exchange for this, they the Managers, got their Auxillia∣ries to baul out <HI>Protestant Succession, House of Hannover,</HI> and the like; tho' it is true, they never lik'd the sound, and brought it out damnable rough. Thus our New Managers went on with them, and while they wanted the As∣sistance of their Croud and Clamours, they chim'd to one another. These cry'd, <HI>down with the Phanaticks;</HI> those answer'd, for <HI>they would pull down the Queen;</HI> these cry, <HI>Damn the Presbyte∣rians;</HI> those Eccho, <HI>for they will bring in the Pretender,</HI> tho' they knew they talk'd Nonsense all the while; and thus both sides speaking what neither of them design'd; they nevertheless, run with a joynt Current, and open Mouths upon the Whigs, till at last they effectually Overthrew and Dispos∣sessed them.</P>
<P>Now as they had various Designs and differing views in this, tho' both agreed in the Means, <HI>(viz.) Pulling down the Whigs</HI> as a Part, yet they could never go far together, because their End was not the same.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52"/>
The Managers had their end as before <HI>(viz.)</HI> to Establish themselves, to put the Administration upon a New Foot as to Persons, to secure their Interest, and have the Weight of Affairs run in the Channel aforesaid</P>
<P>But our Auxilliaries aim'd higher, Persecution in Religion, Tyranny in Government, the Ruine not of the Whiggs as a Party, but of the Whiggs of that Party in Person; Plunder, Ra∣pin, Devastation, Impeachments, Penal-Laws, Fines, Forfeitures, and the true Extremes of High-Church Fury, these were their Views; to this purpose no more War Abroad <HI>was the Word,</HI> Peace was to be made with <HI>France,</HI> whose assistance it was very probable they might stand in need of; and the Rein of Tyranny being put into their hands, they were to Drive over all, according to the Principles of their Party.</P>
<P>The Wiser Managers, tho' they had no Views of this kind, yet loth to lose the Assistance and Votes of those Cla∣mouring People, Sooth'd them as long as possible; and having led them some∣times by the Hand, and sometimes by the Nose, one step after another, now in Hopes of obtaining their Desire, then Doubting again, then reviving their hopes, till they have gotten them
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
a great length in the assistance they at first entertain'd them for, begin now to stand in less need of them than they did before.</P>
<P>The Case seems clear enough, the Managers who made meer Tools of those People, had no more mind to set them up with all their mad Principles in the Administration, than they had to continue the Whigs in the Ministry; nor had they any real View of Destroy∣ing the Whigs as a party; but having a necessity to put a High-flying Face up∣on their first Management, to Ballance the Whigs, who were as mad as other Men in their Turn, and who had got∣ten the Power in their hands; as they by Degrees got that Power out of the hands of the Whigs, by proportion'd Degrees they Checkt and Restrain'd the Fury of that Party.</P>
<P>The Managers in this acted very dexterously, and held the Party so in play that they never could see what Tools they were made of, or how they were fiddl'd in, to Dance in a Circle, out of which they were never like∣ly to move till they return'd back to their Primitive <HI>Turn'd-out</HI> Circumstan∣ces, which they were sure to do as soon as ever they should Dislike their present Employment, or push at any
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
thing agreeable to their Declared Prin∣ciples.</P>
<P>The Managers in this fell upon the Whiggs, just as the Confederates do upon the King of <HI>France, (viz.)</HI> not to Dethrone him as King not to Dis∣solve his Dominions from their settled posture as a Kingdom, not to pull him to pieces and to share his Posses∣sions among themselves; but to reduce him to Bounds and Limitations, to pull down his Exorbitant Greatness, and the Usurpt Dominion over his Neigh∣bour's Right, to gain Security for his being a quiet Neighbour, and in short to fix the Ballance of Power upon Due Equality, for the Settling and Preser∣ving the Peace of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Thus in treating the Whiggs, tho' with Rudeness and Rabble, with Noise and Clamour, and perhaps with some Injustice in some Cases; yet this was never with a View of Deposing the Being or Name of the Whiggs as a Party, Dissolving their Privileges as Subjects, and pushing them into Con∣fusion: The thing was only to reduce their Power, and take from them the Seat of Government, Deposing what they call'd the Exorbitance of the Party, and taking from them the Power to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppress other People.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55"/>
This was plain from the proceed∣ings of the Managers when they had obtain'd their victory over the Whigg Ministry; for they no sooner got the Power of the Administration out of the hands of the Whiggs, but they turn'd Whiggs themselves, making very little alteration of Method, only an alteration of Persons in Executing: <HI>For Example,</HI> They no sooner came to Administer the Publick Affairs, but they kept on foot the same Alliances, engag'd in the same War, resolved upon the same foot of Peace without abatements, made the same Capitula∣tions, paid the same Subsidies, decla∣red their Resolution to stand to the same Succession of the Crown, allow'd to the Dissenters the same Tolleration, Raised Money by the same Methods, and Lay'd Taxes and Funds of the same kind as the Old Ministry had done before them.</P>
<P>Nay even in the Manner of Carrying on the War, and the Persons entrusted with it, They made little or no altera∣tion, tho' at first, to please their new Auxiliaries, <HI>the Tories,</HI> they were fai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to make some Jingle with New Words and New Notions, such as removing the Generals, Removing the Seat of the War, Drawing away the Greatest
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
Body of the Troops from <HI>Flanders,</HI> and carrying on the War ESPECIALLY in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>But this was but a Feint, an artificial Wind, made to blow like a Storm for as long and no longer, as it serv'd the uses it was contriv'd for, and then like a Summer Breeze which ceases with the Setting of the Sun, it went off; the Morn∣ing Clear'd up, and all things went on as they were before: The General, the Army, the Seat of the War remain'd all as they were before, and rather receiv'd an Addition than a Diminution, either the first in Power, or the second in Number of Forces, and all things return'd just to the same Method of proceedings as they did before.</P>
<P>It is true, and nothing was Clearer from the Nature of the thing, than that this was absolutely necessary to be so, and could be no otherwise, and every Man whose Eyes were open saw it before; but our High-flyers, as it often happens with Men of too much Fire in their Politicks, continuing most conveniently blind, put their hands most chearfully to the assistance of the New Managers, upon the weakness and pre∣sumption of their own Designs being to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e put in Execution, as the Consequence of this Alteration.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57"/>
Nor were they the only <HI>Dupes</HI> of the Age neither, for the concealed Jaco∣bites among them, more stupidly blind than the rest, were so Infatuated as to think that certainly the New Managers were at bottom Friends to their Cause, and that they had a View at the Re∣storation of the Pretender. This went such a ridiculous length, that it was wonderful to see how effectual it was to bring those poor <HI>Out-of-fashion-People</HI> to discover themselves, several of them in the North part of <HI>Britain</HI> took the Oaths that had never taken them be∣fore; and when they Chose Members of Parliament, Declar'd those Mem∣bers had nothing to do but to Give their honest Vote for the Restoration of their Sovereign; That it should now be done in a Parliamentary way; That Legal Authority should Joyn in it; That the Ministry were to Joyn in it; And in short, flatter'd themselves with all the absurd and ridiculous No∣tions that poor Lunatics are wont to do, who fancy themselves to be Em∣perors and Monarchs, that they have their Guards, and their numerous Attendants round them, and are every way Equip'd like a Soveraign Prince; when their Ornaments are but real Chains, their Guards the Spectators
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
pitying their Disorder, and their Glo∣rious Pallace the unhappy Cell of an Hospital, or Mad-house: <HI>Qui Jupiter vult Perdere hos Dementat.</HI></P>
<P>Nay so far were these People led on in their State Frenzy, that they per∣swaded themselves to believe, that the Queen was to Joyn in the senseless and unnatural attempt; That Her Majesty had been Convinc'd that the Possession was not her Due, and being Touch'd in Conscience at the Injury done Her Brother, would remit the Crown, Come into the House, and make a voluntary Resignation in Favour of the Preten∣der; Contenting her self with an Ho∣nourable Appannage or Maintenance suitable to Her Birth, and then the Revolution was to be brought about quietly and without Blood by Consent of Parties.</P>
<P>Let no Man wonder, that where Mens Folly were run up to such an Extravagant height, the Disappoint∣ment of all these Glorious Gewgaws, leaves behind it a more than ordinary Chagrin and Discontent; and they that were Whimsy Mad before, turn Melancholly Mad now.</P>
<P>Some have excused them by say∣ing, the first Steps of the New Ma∣nagers were so Extravagant, and
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
look'd so apparently this way, that it was no wonder to find Men, whose Desires lay all to that point, fall into such a Delusion; and that many Honest Men, who apprehended the coming in of the Pretender as the Greatest Evil, were Drawn in as far by their Fears, as those were by their Hopes, verily believing, that the true Design of all this was aim'd at a New Revo∣lution, and that the New Party were all in a strict League with the Pre∣tender, since they thought that either the Design was to bring us all to a <HI>French</HI> Management, or that really the New Managers were Blind and Mad.</P>
<P>But when they saw the Wheel with∣in the Wheel; when they saw the Scheme Work, and that the Engineers of the State Gradually and Wisely dropt all their first appearances, and acted upon the same Revolution Foun∣dation that others had done before them, all those Fears vanish'd at once.</P>
<P>As this discovery eased the minds of one side, and shew'd them that their Case was not so Desperate as they Ima∣gin'd; that we were not all running into Toryisme, and King <HI>James</HI>'s days back again; so it had just the contra∣ry effect upon the other Party, who
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
found by degrees that they were really Deluded, that they had been cutting the Throat of their own Cause all this while, and that as soon as the New Measures were Establish'd, and the Wheel would move without them, they should be turn'd off, be slighted and neglected, and become the same despicable poor Wretches they were before.</P>
<P>Yet did not this Discovery come all at once on either side, their Illumina∣tions came slowly on; some wiser than some was the state of the World from the beginning of it, and will be so to the end: Among the Whiggs some saw into the Politicks of the New Managers early, and finding that the whole Scheme amounted only to put∣ting out and putting in, that the Ma∣nagement would be the same, that it must be so of necessity, and that they could act upon no other foot but that of the Revolution; these grew easie sooner than their Neighbours, and as∣sisted to make others so; whereas some harder to be satisfied, cannot yet per∣swade themselves to believe but the Design is still to Ruin our Constitu∣tion, Dethrone the Queen, Set up <HI>France,</HI> and Bring in the Pretender.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61"/>
On the other hand, among the High Gentlemen some see into things and cry out they are betray'd, that the New Ministry had Trick'd them, that they have only Chang'd the Men but not the Measures: That there has no∣thing been done for the Security of the Church: That the mismanage∣ments of the old Ministry are not en∣quir'd into: That the Treasurer is not Impeach'd: That <HI>Ma...bro'</HI> is still En∣trusted with the Army, that the War is to be carried on still as it was be∣fore, and ESPECIALLY in <HI>Flanders,</HI> not ESPECIALLY in <HI>Spain:</HI> That the Tolleration of Dissenters contrary to Agreement is Continued, and they called in publick <HI>Fellow Christians,</HI> whom they always were made be∣lieve should be esteemed worse than Papists: That Money is Raised by Funds and Loans as it was before, tho' that way was Condemn'd as fa∣tal to the Nation, and Entailing an Eternal Debt upon us that can never be paid: That the Whiggs have been Courted to uphold Credit, and the Bank Treated with by Parliament tho' they were told it should be Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦solv'd, and the Landed Men made th Fund of the Nations Credit.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62"/>
It is agreed that some are still under the old Delusion, and either go on hoodwink'd by the Artifice of their first Deluders; or are brought over to see that they were in the wrong to push at those things in that Manner they did, and that moderate steps are the only Methods to bring their De∣signs happily to pass; that Time and Patience only can effect things, and that to wait is the only way to obtain their ends.</P>
<P>However as the Clamouring Party generally obtains more Proselytes, so the first of these grow most Nume∣rous because they make most Noise.</P>
<P>It is but lately indeed that their Clamours have been made publick, tho' for some time they have made their Complaints to one another: The first that I find any Account of in the Modern Antiquities of this New turn of Affairs, was in Sir <HI>Robert Dandylyon</HI>'s Choice Manual, Entitled, <HI>Loyal Table Talk,</HI> where we have an Account of a Conference between two Country Gentlemen upon these State matters; There was <HI>Tom</HI> of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> an ancient Knight of great Renown for Zeal, But not according to Knowledge; and <HI>Jack</HI> of <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> a younger Man, but an older F—l, both stanch true
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
blue Bigots to <HI>Toryisme</HI> and the <HI>Dan∣ger of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>These met together, and beginning to talk freely, whether warm'd with Zeal or the Bottle, the Author has not thought fit to acquaint us, But they took this weighty Question into Considera∣tion <HI>(viz.)</HI> How they should do to settle the Nation.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> begins the Dialogue thus: <HI>Jack,</HI> What do you think of our Af∣fairs, how do you like things? Prithee tell me your Opinion.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I do not like things at-all, I think we are like to be Bub∣bled by our new Mi...ry, and I shall be glad you'll let us talk a little freely about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart: I have waited for an opportunity to do it a great while; for I am under great un∣easiness about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You know Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> when you and I were sent for to a secret Committee of Honest Gentlemen, how Warm, how Zealous, how much Con∣cern they shew'd for the <HI>Danger of th Church</HI>—How Earnestly they solicite<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us to come in and Joyn with them t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rescue the Church out of the Hands <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Party, who had Poison'd even th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Right Reverend and Reverend Guide
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
of the Church with Principles of Fa∣ction and Whiggisme; and had even Dosed the very Government it self into a stupid Lethargic humour of sitting still and seeing our Holy Church cast into Contempt, her Clergy become the reproach of the Street, and her Worship be ridicul'd by Innumerable swarms of Heresy, Faction and Schis∣matick Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How did they represent to us, that the original of all these mis∣chiefs lay in the mismanagement of the Ministry, who, to engratiate them∣selves with the <HI>Whiggs,</HI> had given up all Concern for the Church, per∣swading the World of her safety and flourishing Circumstances: That this was necessary to carry on their other Designs which the Whiggish Party upheld them in, and that therefore to rescue the Church from the Danger, it was absolutely necessary to give a Turn to the Party, and to bring Af∣fairs into a new Management.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it all, and the mighty good Words they gave us, to perswade us to joyn our Interest with them, to bring about such a desirable Revolution, and to Rescue the Queen,
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
the Church, and the Administration, out of the hands of the Whiggs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How did they promise us upon this, That they wou'd set up the Queen upon Her Majesty's only Glori∣ous and Firm Foundation or Title, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That of <HI>Hereditary Right,</HI> and thereby Recognize and Acknowledge the Ancient and Profess'd Principle of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and of every true Son of that Church <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Doctrines of <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And upon these Capitula∣tions we came over to them, put our selves into their hands, joyn'd our In∣terest with theirs, and brought up Ad∣dresses from every part of the Nation to concur with it, and thereby, as far as in us lay, to perswade Her Majesty and the World, that this was the se∣curity of the Nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and to go a length no Country Party ever went before <HI>(viz.)</HI> to Address her Majesty almost in so many Words to Dissolve the Parlia∣ment; without which, I believe the Court at that time of day had never come in to take such a step, which if we had not universally joyn'd in, must have gone a great way to have
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
Ruin'd the Confederacy, and hazard∣ed the whole Affairs of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All these things are so plain, and so lately done, none can forget them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In Consequence of these Measures we Joyn'd all our Interest, and by the Conduct of the Inferiour Clergy, animated by the Success of Dr. <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> we Rais'd our Party, push'd them upon all sorts of Violences, taught them to Insult the Whiggs, and to Rise in Mobs and Tumults up∣on the Dissenters almost all over the Kingdom; by which means we Bullied them out of their Elections in many Places, indeed in most parts of the Nation, and got Honest Gentlemen of our own Friends Return'd from all sides, and have now got such, so Loyal, so Zealous, so True a Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> Parliament, as has not sat in those Walls for these many Ages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And who could have thought, that after having serv'd them thus Zealously and Faithfull, and that after by their own acknowledg∣ment, they could never have done their Business without us; we could be denied any thing in reason, much less any thing for the real good of the Church; least of all any thing that had
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
been expresly Agreed upon and Capi∣tulated for by us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But I find those things all forgotten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As if they had never been talk'd of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And we grow neglected and slighted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As if we had never been useful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Or as if they had never stood in need of our Assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What one step have they taken to declare Her Majesty's Here∣ditary Right to the Crown, against the Commonwealth Principles that have Debauched our People?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Or have they once mov'd in Parliament to Establish the Known and Essential Principle of <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> which our Church has profess'd upon all occasions, and which is so much the safety of the Crown, against all the Disloyal and Fanatick Notions of the Original Right of the People?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What have they done for the Churches Security, or to let us see that we shall ever be able to say her Dangers are lessen'd?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What have they done to lessen the Power of the Schismaticks and Dissenters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Or have they not rather strengthned their hands, by giving to that abhorr'd Generation of Rebels, <HI>the Presbyterians,</HI> whom we look upon to be worse than <HI>Papists,</HI> the Titles of <HI>Prote∣stants</HI> and FELLOW CHRISTIANS.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My blood rises at these double-tongu'd proceedings, and I cannot but think we are betray'd; that we are all running back into Whig∣gisme and the Junto; for my part I can see nothing in it, no material Change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I neither: We only see new Faces, not one new step, at least of the Kind we ought to have seen, and had reason to expect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I could go on with Com∣plaints of this sort to the end of the Chapter, and observe to you how we are Cheated in the Affairs of the State, Management of the War, Modelling of the Court, the Affair of the Fleet, the Credit, the Bank, the Funds, and above all of the War: But I adjourn it, I have a Project in my Head how to bring this Matter into a more re∣gular method of Enquiry, and per∣haps put it in some way also of redress if you will concur with it.</P>

<P>With all my heart, pray olet's have your thoughts upon it: Let's

<P>It must indeed have the Concurrence of some of our Friends.</P>

<P>It shall not want mine, nor all the Interest and Friends I can procure, and I am not alone in the World.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why my Design is to Con∣cert our Grievances with all our Friends within Doors and without, and if pos∣sible, to make them sencible how both they and we are treated in this Case; and I am perswaded, if we are but u∣nanimous, we are able to give a Check to this new Party still.</P>

<P>I think it is an admirab method: But which way will you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

about it? We must have a few trusty Friends let into the Secret.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have had now a brief Hi∣story of the Original and Occa∣sion of this Wise Assembly, and how they came by the Name, <HI>The October Clubb:</HI> We shall make here but a very small Digression, and proceed to let you into some of their most Accurate and Political Debates.</P>
<P>The Digression I shall make, is only to remark how they lay'd their Design here of bringing with them each some of their Friends out of the Pa—nt House, Members of the present House of C.....s: How it came to pass that they failed mutually in that part of their Design Authors have not left up∣on Record; But this is certain, that this Disappointment did not at all Discourage the two Knights from go∣ing on with their Design, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of propagating a Discontented Society, which they soon effected to their full Content.</P>
<P>It was not long after the resolutions our two Knights took at parting, be∣fore they met according to appoint∣ment
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
with their Assistants: At which meeting their Grievances were at Large settled and lay'd down in Heads of Resolutions, such as these:</P>
<P N="1">I. Resolv'd, That having faithfully Joyn'd in with the New Party, both in their Councils and Assistance, for the overthrow of the late Ministry, and setting on foot new Schemes of Ma∣nagement; they found the said New Party were not true to their Preten∣sions: But that the Work being done for which their assistance it seems was wanted, they found the New Party began to drop them, and to proceed upon the same Model of Management, that they pretended to complain of before.</P>
<P N="2">II. Resolved, That the New Ma∣nagers were in a Plot, to throw en∣tirely off those who had thus faith∣fully assisted them, made their Court to the Whiggs on pretences of Mode∣ration, Carrying on the War, Raising Credit, and the like; and that if some speedy Course was not taken, High Churchmen would be soon as much out of Fashion as ever.</P>
<P N="3">III. Resolved, That the several Ca∣pitulations, on the Conditions of which they the High Gentlemen had assisted▪
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
both with their Councils and Clamour, were not at all regarded. For Ex∣ample,</P>
<P N="1">1. The War was not brought to an end, or the Treaty of Peace renewed with <HI>France,</HI> by which it might have been proved as they had alledged, That the Old Ministry continued it only to preserve their Superiority in the Ad∣ministration.</P>
<P N="2">2. The D ... of <HI>M</HI> ... <HI>h</HI> was not Disbanded, and the D .... of <HI>A</HI> .... <HI>le</HI> put into the Command of the Army, whereby it might be made appear, that not penetrating into the heart of <HI>France,</HI> was an Omission with Design to perpetuate the War.</P>
<P N="3">3. The War however pretended, and after Voted to be carried on ESPE∣CIALLY in <HI>Spain,</HI> is just directed as it was before; None of the old Troops, or but very few, brought over from <HI>Flanders;</HI> on the contrary more Ship∣ped over thither from hence, and the War in <HI>Spain</HI> carried on by new Troops and Imperialists as it was before, to the utter Disappointment of our Friends at St. <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Nothing had in the least been Voted as to the Succession, or the Queen's Declaring in favour of the Ex∣iled .... (Pretender)</P>

5. The Four Impeachments pro∣mised to be brought against the Whigg Ministry, such as the D .... of <HI>M</HI> .... <HI>h,</HI> the Lord <HI>Tr</HI> ... <HI>r,</HI> the Earls of <HI>W</HI> ... and <HI>S</HI> .... <HI>d</HI> was no more Discours'd of, but dropt in a feint, and they were put off with a Commission to State and Take the Publick Accounts.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Taxes were Lay'd, and Mo∣ney Rais'd by Funds and Loans just as before, notwithstanding former pre∣tences of Entailing Debts on the Na∣tion.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Whiggs were Courted to Raise Credit, the Whiggs Voted, and were joyn'd in those Votes for Raising Taxes, for Funds, and Borrowing Money by Loan; Whiggs were suf∣fer'd to Lend Money upon the said Funds, and Encourag'd to Raise Cre∣dit upon promises of Moderation and Temper in Management.</P>
<P N="8">8. Whiggish Funds were Voted to be made Good, and the Exorbitant Debts Contracted by Whiggish Ma∣nagement all to be paid, which it was agreed should all be wiped off with a Parliament SPUNGE, whereby all former Funds being re-assum'd, the Nation might have Carried on the War for Twenty year, if there had
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
been occasion, without any more Taxes.</P>
<P N="9">9. Tolleration and Exemption from Penal Laws continu'd to Dissenters, and that Factious Crew declared, even by Parliament, to be <HI>Fellow Christians</HI> with the true Sons of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> whereas we had agreed to Dissolve and Overthrow the pretended Tolleration, and to Extin∣guish the abhorr'd Name of Schisma∣tick from the Nation, by <HI>The shortest Way with the Dissenters.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. All the promised Measures for removing the Danger of the Church forgotten; and all the Methods for ta∣king away the Fears and Jealousies of her Zealous Clergy, which arise from the Uniting with Presbyterians, and establishing a Rebel Church in the North part of <HI>Britain,</HI> neglected.</P>
<P N="11">11. The solemn Recognition of the Doctrines of <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non∣resistance,</HI> which was agreed to be pro∣posed to all Her Majesty's Subjects, as a new Test of Admittance into Offices and Trusts, either in Parliament, Church, or State, forgotten; and no moreheard of about them.</P>
<P N="12">12. The Hereditary Right of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> not asserted,
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
in opposition to the Trayterous position of Parliamentary Limitation.</P>
<P>These Resolutions being Examin'd and Approv'd, the Measures for Re∣dressing these Grievances came next into Consideration, which were, after mature Deliberation, and many De∣bates and Meetings, Resolved into such as these:</P>
<P N="1">1. That all the Clamour, Noise, and Raillery, which they had former∣ly raised against the Whiggs and Dis∣senters should cease, for a while; and to employ that useful Talent; without which the very being and nature o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Cause would sink and be forgotten in the World, the whole Stream, with all the Sluces and Flood-gates thereo should be turn'd down, open'd, and let fly at the New Ministry, and the Managers under them.</P>
<P N="2">2. That upon all Occasions, the should endeavour to make their ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Complaints as popular as possible and principally on account of th Great Neglect of the promised Ze<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the Church, which instead of givin her ease from Schisme and Factio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is like to be fobb'd off with Buildi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
a few Churches, and Repairing her Liturgy, things they could willingly have parted with, for but one Vote against Tolleration and Exemption.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>Anthony</HI> Marquis <HI>de Guiscard</HI> should in all their Writings and Dis∣courses be Damn'd for a Poultrone and a Scoundrel, not for Assassinating or Stabbing Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> but for doing it by halves, and Stabbing him in the wrong place, since they have deter∣min'd in all their Assemblies and De∣bates, <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> That he has been the only, or most material ob∣stacle to all the true measures of High Church, and the great Cause of all their Grievances aforesaid, and that he has their constant ill-will, Back-bles∣ings, and Anathema's accordingly.</P>
<P N="4">4. That they should endeavour to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring as many of their Friends to this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew Society as is possible; who should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all Engag'd upon Parole of Honour <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pursue the just measures of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole, in order to obtain a redress of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Grievances aforesaid.</P>
<P N="5">5. That of these Friends and Assist∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, they should forthwith apply <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emselves with all their Interest, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, IF POSSIBLE, some of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbers of the H ... of C ....
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
to their Society, and as many as they could of the Dignified Clergy; as to the Inferiour Clergy, one of the Soci∣ety stood up and acquainted them, that he was empower'd from Dr. <HI>Sa∣cheverell</HI> to assure them, That both he and all his Disciples of the Inferiour Priests and Deacons, were with them heart and hand, and he immediately produc'd his Commission from the Doctor for his Credentials.</P>
<P N="6">6. Lastly, That some Honourable Name should be consider'd of for their Meeting, in order to perpetuate their Endeavours, and Record both it and their Persons to Posterity, <HI>in Perpetuam rei Memoriam.</HI></P>
<P>It fell out unhappily, that while the Society were deliberating upon the Eternizing their Memory in History, and to that end giving themselves a Name; a Gentleman of Quality comes into the Tavern, and coming up to the Bar, enquires for the Assembly by the word OCTOBER; accordingly the Master of the House sends th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Drawer up Stairs with the Gentleman to shew him the Room. The Drawer goes up to the first space in the Stairs when seeing another Drawer at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
top of the Stairs, he stopt; and calling up to the other Drawer, <HI>Will,</HI> says he, shew the Gentleman to the Club. What Club says <HI>Will?</HI> D—ye, the Fellow's a Fool, says the t'other, the <HI>October</HI> Club: So he carries him in.</P>
<P>In the very moment this happen'd, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>—sends his Footman to the Tavern, to see if the Company was met; <HI>Jack,</HI> says Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> Go to the <HI>Bell</HI> and enquire if the Gentlmen of the Club are come? If they don't understand you by that, give them the word, OCTOBER. <HI>Jack,</HI> a blundering West-country Booby comes up to the Bar decently enough, but asking once or twice, and the People being busy, and not minding him, he stood like a Mute a while; a Drawer by that time being a little at leisure, took notice of him, <HI>Who do you look for,</HI> says the Drawer? THE OCTOBER CLUBB, says the Innocent Clown, bawling it aloud. Up two pair of Stairs in the Great Room, says the Draw∣er, and up Stairs goes the Footman.</P>
<P>As the D—I would have it, who was certainly their G—d father, Three Gentlemen comes in at the very
<PB N="78" REF="81"/>
moment to ask for <HI>October,</HI> and they hears the Boy enquire as before, and up Stairs they go with him.</P>
<P>Just as they were come in, the Society were in Debate as above for some Ho∣nourable Designation to bestow on themselves to Eternise the memory of their Assembly, when the first Gentle∣man stands up, and Addressing himself merrily to Esq; <HI>H</HI>—the Chairman for the time being; Mr. Chairman, says he, I think we may save our selves the trouble of this Debate, for if I mistake not our Society is Christned already, and so tells them his story of the two Drawers. While he is speaking, Sir <HI>William</HI>—being one of the three Gen∣tlemen abovesaid, stands up, says he, I felicitate you all upon your new Title of Honour, Gentlemen, and so tells his story of Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Footman.</P>
<P>Several in the Society took offence at it, and moved that the Master of the House might be spoken to, that care might be taken of it; but it was got among the Drawers, and from thence it went among the Footmen, and it was to no more purpose to go about to stop it then, than my Lord <HI>Haver∣sham</HI>'s
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
Thumb to the Tide at <HI>Graves∣end.</HI>
<Q><L>Thus much for the Original of the Name.</L></Q></P>
<P>We thought to have given you a brief Historical Account here of the diligent Endeavours of the Members of this Club, <HI>for so we are now to call them,</HI> to Grace their Assembly with the Attendance of some of our Na∣tions Representatives: But they ha∣ving met with a great Mortification on that Head, not being able, ac∣cording to their Desire and Expecta∣tions, to bring any of that Body to Joyn with them, no, not one; and the Design of this being only to speak to the Honour and Advantage of the Society, we are unwilling to leave up∣on Record any thing so much to their Disadvantage and Discouragement.</P>
<P>The History of the many bright Ornaments of the Church who came dayly over to them, and of the En∣crease of their Number from two Originals, recited to near One Hun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red and Eighty MEMBERS; the constant Flux of Assistants from the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>either House</HI> of Con—ation, the farther proceedings of the Diligent Emissaries
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
they employ'd, and the like, these may afford a large Field of most use∣ful History, and which in time may be made more publick for the Informa∣tion of the Age, and the Caution of Posterity.</P>
<P>At present we shall only acquaint you, that in pursuance of the five Propositions mentioned above, the Gentlemen applied themselves with Great Diligence, and some say, with unexpected Success, to propagate the Cause they were Embark'd in, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to Erect a new Faction of Malecon∣tents among us, the Nation not be∣ing Divided enough before; and upon all occasions to go about Murmuring, Complaining, and raising Jealousies among the People, against the Queen and her new Administration:</P>
<P>For still omitting needful Security to the Church, which remains in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same Danger as before.</P>
<P>For Encouraging the Factious an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Evil principled Dissenters.</P>
<P>For Declining the Advantages of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hereditary Claim to the Crown.</P>
<P>For Carrying on the War with th same fury as formerly.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="84"/>
For setting up for a Moderate ma∣nagement of Affairs.
<Q><L>And the like.</L></Q></P>
<P>It happen'd one day, in the prose∣cution of these Affairs, three Gentle∣men were Introduc'd to their Society, whose Faces were not well known; on a suddain a certain Damp spread upon the Countenances of the rest, and they began to look upon one another; the Business of the Society seem'd to stop, and the Gentlemen all in little Com∣mittees, of two, three, five, seven, and the like, talking upon private matters, till Sir <HI>M</HI>—standing up mov'd the Chairman to call to the order of the Society, which was done, and some∣body mentioning the bringing in of three Strangers, <HI>G—L—C</HI>—stood up and answer'd for them, That they were three Honest Gentlemen of <HI>North-Britain,</HI> and all of his acquaintance: upon which all were satisfied and fell to Business again.</P>
<P>However this occasion'd a New Debate, started by Sir <HI>H—M</HI>—, a worthy Member of the Society, of what sort of People they should Admit or Exclude from their Society.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="85"/>
The previous Question took up some time, and occasion'd several very Learned Speeches, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Whether they should Exclude any kind of Peo∣ple or no? But this was carried in the affirmative for many Reasons; especially this, That tho' their Grie∣vances were to be made as popular, and the Reasons of their Discon∣tents as publick as possible, yet the Measures they were to take for the bringing it to pass, and the Persons and Engines they might emyloy, as well as their own Persons, it would be necessary should be concealed as much as possible.</P>
<P>This being Resolv'd, the next thing to be Consider'd was, What sort of People were to be Admitted, or Ex∣cluded; in which their Debates were very remarkable on many Accounts and we shall give you an Abstract o some of them, tho' the Learned Speeches made on this occasion, by Sir <HI>P</HI>—, Sir <HI>H</HI>—, Sir <HI>M</HI>—and others, are, for want of room i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Tract, purposely omitted, thing otherwise worthy of Eternal Remark especially as coming from Men know never to have spoken Sence befor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
and therefore certainly speaking by supernatural Inspiration now: A most sublime Testimony to the Goodness of their Cause, and a Token of the Great Success they expect to attend them.</P>
<P>The first proposal was about a <HI>Whigg;</HI> The Word was no sooner nam'd, but an universal Hiss begin∣ning among the Clergy at the upper end of the Room, spread it self throughout the whole Company: There was a Wiser Man than most among them, who Mov'd the Affir∣mative; he told them there were some High-flyers among the Whiggs, and as all Hot Principles was useful to their Designs, he thought it was a good piece of Policy to receive such, as Tools for their Work.</P>
<P>But it was answer'd those Tools might be made use of at second hand, and without doors, and so he was over-rul'd, and all manner of Whiggs, old Whiggs, or Modern Whiggs were Excluded, only with a reserve for my Lord—<HI>Haversham</HI>'s Ghost, if he thought fit to appear, <HI>W—P</HI>—, and Mr. <HI>R</HI>—, my Lord ∵ <HI>R</HI>—
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
<HI>W</HI>—, and the D—of <HI>A—ll,</HI> three <HI>Scots Presbyterians,</HI> and two <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>It was long indeed before those could be allow'd, but at last a Learn∣ed Distinction was accepted in their Favour, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That they were all Friends to the Pretender: So they were admitted as <HI>Jacobites,</HI> not as <HI>Whiggs,</HI> no Favour being allow'd to the latter upon any Terms what∣ever.</P>
<P>It was next Debated, whether <HI>Pa∣pists</HI> should be admitted into their Society, and it was carried for a per∣mission, after much Debate, with this Restriction: <Q>“”<HI>Provided, Nevertheless, and it is hereby Enacted by the Autho∣rity aforesaid, That no Papist be ad∣mitted into this Society who has abov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 300 <HI>s. a year Estate in Land within this Kingdom.</HI></Q> It may be matter <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Speculation why such an Exception a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this should be made: <HI>But the Case <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very plain,</HI> for it was alledg'd, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the <HI>Papists</HI> of greater Estates, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were willing enough to hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Revolution of this Nation u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ravell'd, and the Royal Line, as the
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
call it, restor'd; yet they see so much improbability in the Success, and how they are so certain to be ruin'd in the attempt by these sort of Men, that generally speaking, they are en∣clin'd to sit still and be quiet, till they have some surer Game to play; and therefore least these <HI>Wiser-Papists</HI> should make some prudent, moderate steps, to the prejudice of the High∣flying hairbrain'd Principles, and so prevent their ruining themselves, which they are resolv'd upon in spight of Common Sense; for this reason they Excluded such, at the same time Admitting all the <HI>Guiscardins, French</HI>-Spies, Desperadoes and Mad-men, as well <HI>Papists</HI> as others.</P>
<P>We should here have descended to the affirmative of the Debate, and given you some Distinguishing Cha∣racters of the sorts they have agreed to admit, and the manner of their admission: But this, together with the Characters of the Persons, we are obliged, for want of room, to adjourn to the farther History of their Pro∣ceedings, which is preparing to be made publick; in which Account, their Principles, Politicks and Persons,
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
may have justice done them more at large.</P>
<P>Mean time we hope these Historical and Authentick Memoirs of their Ori∣ginal may be to the satisfaction of the Reader, and may be allow'd to have answer'd its Title, <HI>(viz.) The Secret History of the</HI> October <HI>Clubb.</HI></P>
<P>We thought also to have given you a New Poem to the Honour and Glory of the Society, a true Original, by a Member of the Clubb: But we are oblig'd to reserve it for a farther op∣portunity.</P>
