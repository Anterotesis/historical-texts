<L>CHURCHILL, You have a Poem coming out▪</L>
<L>You've my best wishes; but I really fear</L>
<L>Your Muse in general is too severe,</L>
<L>Her Spirit seems her int'rest to oppose,</L>
<L>And, where she makes one friend, makes twenty foes.</L>
</LG>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your Lordship's fears are just, I feel their force,</L>
<L>But only feel it as a thing of course.</L>
<L>The man, whose hardy spirit shall engage</L>
<L>To lash the vices of a guilty age,</L>
<L>At his first setting forward ought to know,</L>
<L>That ev'ry rogue he meets must be his foe,</L>
<L>That the rude breath of Satire will provoke</L>
<L>Many who feel, and more who fear the stroke,</L>
<L>But shall the partial rage of selfish men</L>
<L>From stubborn Justice wrench the righteous pen,</L>
<L>Or shall I not my settled course pursue,</L>
<L>Because my foes, are foes to Virtue too?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<L>What is this boasted Virtue, taught in schools,</L>
<L>And idly drawn from antiquated rules?</L>
<L>What is her use? point out one wholesome end?</L>
<L>Will she hurt foes, or can she make a friend?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
When from long fasts fierce appetites arise,</L>
<L>Can this same Virtue stifle Nature's cries?</L>
<L>Can she the pittance of a meal afford,</L>
<L>And bid thee welcome to one great man's board?</L>
<L>When northern winds the rough December arm</L>
<L>With frost and snow, can Virtue keep thee warm?</L>
<L>Canst thou dismiss the hard unfeeling Dun</L>
<L>Barely by saying, Thou art Virtue's Son?</L>
<L>Or by base blundring Statesmen sent to jail,</L>
<L>Will MANSFIELD take this Virtue for thy bail?</L>
<L>Believe it not, the name is in disgrace,</L>
<L>Virtue and TEMPLE now are out of place.</L>
</SP>
<LG>
<L>Quit then this meteor, whose delusive ray</L>
<L>From wealth and honour leads thee far astray.</L>
<L>True Virtue means, let Reason use her eyes,</L>
<L>Nothing with Fools, and Int'rest with the Wise.</L>
<L>Would'st thou be great, her patronage disclaim,</L>
<L>Nor madly triumph in so mean a name:</L>
<L>Let nobler wreaths thy happy brows adorn,</L>
<L>And leave to Virtue poverty and scorn.</L>
<L>Let Prudence be thy guide; who doth not know</L>
<L>How seldom Prudence can with Virtue go?</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
To be successful try thy utmost force,</L>
<L>And Virtue follows as a thing of course.</L>

<L>HIRCO, who knows not HIRCO, stains the bed</L>
<L>Of that kind Master who first gave him bread,</L>
<L>Scatters the seeds of discord thro' the land,</L>
<L>Breaks ev'ry public, ev'ry private band,</L>
<L>Beholds with joy a trusting friend undone,</L>
<L>Betrays a Brother, and would cheat a Son:</L>
<L>What mortal in his senses can endure</L>
<L>The name of HIRCO, for the wretch is poor?</L>
<L>“Let him hang, drown, starve, on a dunghill rot,</L>
<L>By all detested live, and die forgot;</L>
<L>Let him, a poor return, in ev'ry breath</L>
<L>Feel all death's pains, yet be whole years in death,”</L>
<L>Is now the gen'ral cry we all pursue;</L>
<L>Let FORTUNE change, and PRUDENCE changes too,</L>
<L>Supple and pliant a new system feels,</L>
<L>Throws up her Cap, and spaniels at his heels,</L>
<L>Long live great HIRCO, cries, by int'rest taught,</L>
<L>And let his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oes, tho' I prove one, be nought.</L>

<L>Peace to such Men, if such Men can have peace,</L>
<L>Let their Possessions, let their State increase,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Let their base services in Courts strike root,</L>
<L>And in the season bring forth golden fruit,</L>
<L>I envy not; let those who have the will,</L>
<L>And, with so little Spirit, so much skill,</L>
<L>With such vile instruments their fortunes carve;</L>
<L>Rogues may grow fat, an honest man dares starve.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<L>These stale conceits thrown off, let us advance</L>
<L>For once to real life, and quit Romance.</L>
<L>Starve! pretty talking! but I fain would view</L>
<L>That man, that honest man, would do it too.</L>
<L>Hence to yon mountain which outbraves the sky,</L>
<L>And dart from pole to pole thy strengthen'd eye,</L>
<L>Thro' all that space you shall not view one man,</L>
<L>Not one, who dares to act on such a plan.</L>
<L>Cowards in calms will say, what in a storm,</L>
<L>The Brave will tremble at, and not perform.</L>
<L>Thine be the proof, and, spite of all you've said,</L>
<L>You'd give your Honour for a crust of bread.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<L>What Proof might do, what Hunger might effect,</L>
<L>What famish'd Nature, looking with neglect</L>
<L>On all she once held dear, what Fear, at strife</L>
<L>With fainting Virtue for the means of life,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Might make this coward flesh, in love with breath,</L>
<L>Shudd'ring at pain, and shrinking back from death,</L>
<L>In treason to my soul, descend to bear,</L>
<L>Trusting to Fate, I neither know, nor care.</L>
</SP>
<LG>
<L><HI>Once,</HI> at this hour those wounds afresh I feel,</L>
<L>Which nor prosperity nor time can heal,</L>
<L>Those wounds, which Fate severely hath decreed,</L>
<L>Mention'd, or thought of, must for ever bleed,</L>
<L>Those wounds, which humbled all that pride of man,</L>
<L>Which brings such mighty aid to Virtue's plan;</L>
<L><HI>Once,</HI> aw'd by Fortune's most oppressive frown,</L>
<L>By legal rapine to the earth bow'd down,</L>
<L>My credit at last gasp, my state undone,</L>
<L>Trembling to meet the shock I could not shun,</L>
<L>Virtue gave ground, and blank Despair prevail'd;</L>
<L>Sinking beneath the storm, my spirits fail'd,</L>
<L>Like PETER's Faith, 'till One, a Friend indeed,</L>
<L>May all distress find such in time of need,</L>
<L>One kind good man, in act, in word, in thought,</L>
<L>By Virtue guided, and by Wisdom taught,</L>
<L>Image of him whom Christians should adore,</L>
<L>Stretch'd forth his hand, and brought me safe to shore.</L>

<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<L><HI>Since,</HI> by good fortune into notice rais'd,</L>
<L>And for some little merit largely prais'd,</L>
<L>Indulg'd in swerving from prudential rules,</L>
<L>Hated by rogues, and not belov'd by fools,</L>
<L>Plac'd above want, shall abject thirst of wealth</L>
<L>So fiercely war 'gainst my soul's dearest health,</L>
<L>That, as a boon, I should base shackles crave,</L>
<L>And, born to Freedom, make myself a slave;</L>
<L>That I should in, the train of those appear,</L>
<L>Whom Honour cannot love, nor Manhood fear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That I no longer skulk from street to street,</L>
<L>Afraid lest Duns assail, and Bailiffs meet;</L>
<L>That I from place to place this carcase bear,</L>
<L>Walk forth at large, and wander free as air;</L>
<L>That I no longer dread the aukward friend,</L>
<L>Whose very obligations must offend,</L>
<L>Nor, all too froward, with impatience burn</L>
<L>At suff'ring favours which I can't return;</L>
<L>That, from dependance and from pride secure,</L>
<L>I am not plac'd so high to scorn the poor,</L>
<L>Nor yet so low, that I my Lord sould fear,</L>
<L>Or hesitate to give him sneer for sneer;</L>

That, whilst sage Prudence my pursuits confirms,</L>
<L>I can enjoy the world on equal terms;</L>
<L>That, kind to others, to myself most true,</L>
<L>Feeling no want, I comfort those who do,</L>
<L>And with the will have pow'r to aid distress;</L>
<L>These, and what other blessings I possess,</L>
<L>From the indulgence of the PUBLIC rise;</L>
<L>All private patronage my soul defies.</L>
<L>By Candour more inclin'd to save, than damn,</L>
<L>A gen'rous PUBLIC made me what I Am.</L>
<L>All that I have, They gave; just mem'ry bears</L>
<L>The grateful stamp, and what I am is Theirs.</L>

<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<L>To feign a red-hot zeal for Freedom's cause,</L>
<L>To mouthe aloud for liberties and laws,</L>
<L>For Public good to bellow all abroad,</L>
<L>Serves well the purposes of private fraud.</L>
<L>Prudence, by Public good intends her own;</L>
<L>If you mean otherwise, you stand alone.</L>
<L>What do we mean by Country and by Court,</L>
<L>What is it to Oppose, what to Support?</L>
<L>Mere words of course, and what is more absurd</L>
<L>Than to pay homage to an empty word!</L>

MAJORS and MINORS differ but in name,</L>

Doth Virtue in thy bosom brighter glow,</L>

<L>'Tis not thy Virtue, but thy Pride rebels.</L>

<L>Think, and confess thyself like other men;</L>
<L>Think but one hour, and, to thy Conscience led</L>
<L>By Reason's hand, bow down and hang thy head,</L>

<L>View thyself now, and own with strictest truth,</L>
<L>That SELF hath drawn thee from fair Virtue's way</L>
<L>Farther than Folly would have dar'd to stray,</L>

But let her, with more worthy objects caught,</L>

<L>Which Friends may pardon, but I never can?</L>
<L>Look back! a thought which borders on despair,</L>
<L>Which human nature must, yet cannot bear.</L>
<L>'Tis not the babbling of a busy world,</L>

Each circumstance of guilt; when stern, but true,</L>
<L>She brings bad actions forth into review;</L>
<L>And, like the dread hand-writing on the wall,</L>
<L>Bids late Remorse awake at Reason's call,</L>
<L>Arm'd at all points bids Scorpion Vengeance pass,</L>

<L><PB N="330" REF="317" MS="y"/>
Or conn the pages of his gaping <HI>Day,</HI></L>
<L>Where all his former Fame was thrown away,</L>
<L>Where all, but barren labour, was forgot,</L>
<L>And the vain stiffness of a <HI>Letter'd</HI> SCOT;</L>
<L>Let Them with ARMSTRONG pass the term of light,</L>
<L>But not one hour of darkness; when the Night</L>
<L>Suspends this mortal coil, when Mem'ry wakes,</L>
<L>When for our past misdoings Conscience takes</L>
<L>A deep revenge, when, by Reflexion led,</L>
<L>She draws his curtains, and looks comfort dead,</L>
<L>Let ev'ry Muse be gone; in vain He turns</L>
<L>And tries to pray for sleep; an Aetna burns,</L>
<L>A more than Aetna in his coward breast,</L>
<L>And Guilt, with vengeance arm'd, forbids him rest,</L>
<L>Tho' soft as Plumage from young Zephyr's wing,</L>
<L>His couch seems hard, and no relief can bring.</L>
<L>INGRATITUDE hath planted daggers there,</L>
<L>No Good Man can deserve, no brave Man bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, or in any better way They <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ease,</L>
<L>With these great Men, or with great Men like these,</L>
<L>Let Them their appetite for laughter feed;</L>
<L>I on my Journey all Alone proceed.</L>
