<P>THE PRINCIPAL and PROFES∣SORS
of the MARISCHAL COL∣LEGE
of ABERDEEN, having lately
made a very material alteration in the or∣der
of teaching Philosophy, they think it
incumbent upon them to lay before the
public, which is interested in every thing
that relates to education, the reasons which
determined them to deviate from the hi∣therto
received method.</P>
<P>THE order formerly observed in this
College, was that followed by most of the
antient Philosophers, which was afterwards
espoused by the Scholastics, and generally
adopted by all the Universities in Europe:
they began with Logic, then proceeded to
Ontology, Pneumatic, Morals, Politics;
and, last of all, taught Natural Philosophy.
The Peripatetic Philosophy, at least as far
as it was espoused by the commentators
and followers of Aristotle, was in great
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
measure made up of verbal subtleties, and
theories ill grounded, tho' ingeniously de∣vised.
These were supported by arguments
moulded into an artificial form; the me∣chanism
of which must first of all be under∣stood;
and it was laid open by the Logic
then in use. The chief business of that
Philosophy, was, to express opinions in
hard and unintelligible terms; the student
needed a dictionary or nomenclature of the
technical words and authorised distinctions;
experiment was quite neglected, science
was to be reasoned out from general prin∣ciples,
either taken for granted, or deduc∣ed
by comparison of general ideas, or
founded on very narrow and inadequate
observation: Ontology, which explained
these terms and distinctions, and laid down
these principles, was therefore introduced
immediately after Logic. By these two,
the student was sufficiently prepared for the
verbal, or at best, ideal inquiries of the o∣ther
parts.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5"/>
BUT Philosophy has been since that
time happily reformed, and is become an
image, not of human phantasies and con∣ceits,
but of the reality of nature, and truth
of things. The only basis of Philosophy is
now acknowledged to be an accurate and
extensive history of nature, exhibiting an
exact view of the various phoenomena for
which Philosophy is to account, and on
which it is to found its reasonings. This
being the reformed state of Philosophy,
great inconveniencies must be found in
prosecuting the scholastic order of the sci∣ences.
The student must make a transiti∣on
at once from words and languages to
Philosophy, without being previously intro∣duced
to the knowledge of facts, the sole
foundation of, and preparation for it; he
must be hurried, at the first, into the most
abstruse, difficult and subtle parts of it; he
must be put upon examining the nature,
foundation and different kinds of evidence
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
and reasoning, before he is acquainted with
any specimens of these kinds, by which
they may be illustrated. And in proporti∣on
as Philosophy is more improved, and
more thoroughly reformed, these inconve∣niencies
must become more sensible.</P>
<P>THE view of these induced the Masters
of the Marischal College to think of alter∣ing
the hitherto received order; and, after
the most mature deliberation, made them
at last resolve, that their students should,
after being instructed in languages and
classical learning, be made acquainted with
the Elements of History, Natural and Civil,
of Geography and Chronology, accompa∣nied
with the Elements of Mathematics;
that they should then proceed to Natural
Philosophy, and, last of all, to Morals, Po∣litics,
Logic and Metaphysics. And if, by
adopting this order, they avoid the incon∣veniencies
above-mentioned, and make the
sciences to follow one another, according
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
to the natural connexion of their subjects,
and the gradual openings of the human
mind, may they not expect the approbati∣on
of the public, and better fruits of their
labours, in forming the minds of youth, so
as they may be possessed of more real know∣ledge,
and that more useful for the various
purposes of human life? That this is the
case, the following pages are intended to
evince.</P>
<P>THAT Logic should be taught first, ap∣pears
to be supported by an argument, spe∣cious
enough on a transient view, viz.
“That as it professes to teach the method
and rules of reasoning, it is natural to
begin with learning these rules, and then
to apply them in the several sciences.”
But however plausible this argument may
at first sight seem, it will, on closer atten∣tion,
be found not at all solid or conclusive.</P>
<P>THE world is now pretty well satisfied
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
that the understanding cannot be aided in
the discovery of truth, by a Logic like the
Scholastic, founded on an arbitrary disposi∣tion
of all things under certain general
names, and consisting only of fine-spun ob∣servations
concerning the combination of
words in propositions, and of propositions
in artificial syllogisms. This may assist one
in disputing readily and artfully in defence
of either truth or error: but it can never
contribute to promote knowledge, and
guard us against mistakes. The Logic
that can answer this end, must accurately
examine and carefully ascertain the various
kinds of evidence, their foundations, their
laws, the subjects to which they belong,
the degree and species of assent which they
produce; it must lay open the sources of
error, the causes of false judgment, and the
conduct of the understanding by which it
may be prevented; it must explain the dif∣ferent
methods of invention, at once suited
to the constitution of the mind, and to the
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
varieties of the objects it is conversant with.</P>
<P>THIS is one of the most abstruse and
difficult branches of Philosophy, and there∣fore
quite improper to begin with. It has
a strict dependence on many parts of know∣ledge;
these must of consequence be pre∣mised,
before it can be rightly apprehend∣ed.
The natural history of the human un∣derstanding
must be known, and its phoe∣nomena
discovered; for without this, the
exertions of the intellectual faculties, and
their application to the various subjects of
science will be unintelligible. These phoe∣nomena
must be not only <HI>narrated,</HI> but
likewise, as far as possible, <HI>explained;</HI> for
without investigating their general laws,
no certain and general conclusions con∣cerning
their exercise can be deduced.</P>
<P>NAY, all sciences, all branches of know∣ledge
whatever, must be premised as a
ground-work to genuine Logic. History
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
has one kind of evidence; Mathematics,
another; Natural Philosophy, one still
different; the Philosophy of human nature,
another, distinct from all these: the sub∣ordinate
branches of these several parts,
have still minuter peculiarities in the evi∣dence
appropriated to them. An unpreju∣diced
mind will in each of these be convin∣ced
by that species of argument which is
peculiar to it, tho' it does not reflect how
it comes to be convinced. By being con∣versant
in <HI>them,</HI> one is prepared for the stu∣dy
of <HI>Logic;</HI> for <HI>they</HI> supply them with a
fund of materials; in <HI>them,</HI> the different
kinds of evidence and argument are exem∣plified;
from <HI>them</HI> only, those illustrations
can be taken, without which, <HI>its</HI> rules and
precepts must be unintelligible.</P>
<P>ALL just conclusions, concerning the
works of nature, must be founded on an in∣duction
of particulars. And as in <HI>Natu∣ral
Philosophy,</HI> these particulars are supplied
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
by observations and experiments on <HI>Natu∣ral
Bodies,</HI> so in <HI>Logic</HI> the particulars, of
which an induction must be made, are to
be learned only from the body of <HI>Arts and
Sciences.</HI> These are the subjects on which
observations must be made, in order to lay
down rules for investigating and proving
the truths of which they are made up; just
as the genuine performances of any art are
what must be considered and observed, in
laying down the rules of that art. No so∣lid
precept can be formed in Logic, except
by examining arts and sciences, and attend∣ing
to the method of reasoning used in
them, and to the evidence that accompa∣nies
it. In proportion as they are cultivat∣ed,
and no farther, Logic may be improv∣ed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Artem inveniendi cum invento adoles∣cere statuat.</P>
<P>Verulam de interpret. naturae Aphorism.</P></NOTE> And what is true of the invention of
Logic, is true likewise of the study of it.
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
It can be understood no farther than the se∣veral
sciences, which it reviews and criti∣cises,
are previously understood. Accord∣ingly
we find, that all the systems of Logic
which have not been compiled from a care∣ful
review and examination of the several
sciences, consist more of ingenious subtle∣ties,
than of useful precepts assisting to the
mind in the various parts of knowledge.
And when Logic has been learned before
the other sciences, the substantial parts of it
have been scarce attended to, or made any
use of, in the prosecution of <HI>them;</HI> nor so
much as understood, but in as far as the
mind was gradually opened, and brought
to recollect them in its progress thro' the
sciences. Let us illustrate this by a parallel
case.</P>
<P>LOGIC is precisely the same to <HI>Philoso∣phy,</HI>
that works of criticism are to <HI>Poetry.</HI>
The rules of criticism are formed by an ac∣curate
scrutiny and examination of the best
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
works of poetry. To one who had never
read a poem, these rules would be obscure
and useless; he could not comprehend
them, far less would he be able to form a
judgment of their justness, and of the rea∣sons
on which they are founded. If one
peruses the best poetical performances, he
will acquire some degree of taste, tho' he
has never professedly studied the rules of
criticism; and he will, at the same time,
lay in materials, and obtain a stock of ex∣amples,
which may render these rules in∣telligible
to him, and enable him to judge
whether they are just or not. And by af∣terwards
studying these rules, he improves,
refines and corrects his taste, perceives the
principles on which he has founded all his
judgments, tho' he did not in the mean
time, think of them, and gains additional
security against his judging wrong. This
may illustrate what has been said of the
place which Logic ought to hold among
the sciences. The observations made in
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
it, both concerning the methods of inven∣tion,
and of probation, are founded on, and
deduced from, the several sciences in which
these methods are used. Neither the ob∣servations
themselves, nor the reasons on
which they are built, can be fully compre∣hended
by one absolutely ignorant of these
sciences. In studying the particular scien∣ces,
reason will spontaneously exert itself:
if the proper and natural method of reason∣ing
is used, the mind will by the native
force of its faculties perceive the evidence
and be convinced by it, tho' it does not re∣flect
how this comes to pass, nor explicite∣ly
consider according to what general rules
the understanding is exerted. By after∣wards
studying these rules, one will be far∣ther
fitted for prosecuting the several sci∣ences;
the knowledge of the grounds and
laws of evidence will give him the security
of <HI>reflection,</HI> against employing wrong me∣thods
of proof and improper kinds of evi∣dence,
additional to that of <HI>instinct</HI> and <HI>na∣tural
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
genius.</HI> And thus Logic will great<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
contribute to improvement in knowledge;
and more so, when it is used as a <HI>review</HI> of
the method taken in the prosecution of sci∣ence,
of the foundations gone upon, and of
the general rules that have been observed,
than when it is applied as an <HI>introduction</HI>
to the elements of science: for in the for∣mer
case, its rules can be perfectly under∣stood,
sufficiently illustrated, and put in
practice as they are learned, which in the
latter is quite impossible.</P>
<P>THERE is one objection that may still
remain to what has been said, viz.
“That the elements of the other sciences
must be taught with disadvantage, when
the student is wholly unacquainted with
the rules of reasoning observed in them.”
But we have seen that Logic can scarce be
taught at all till these elements are learned,
at least not so as to produce any consider∣able
advantage in the study of Philosophy;
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
its rules being but ill understood, thro' ig∣norance
of the examples by which they are
to be illustrated, and of the particulars on
which they are founded, will be forgot be∣fore
there is occasion to apply them, or, if
they are remembred, the student having but
an indistinct conception of them, is incap∣able
of applying them. Besides, there will
not be found so great inconvenience as is
apprehended, in studying the elements of
science, without a previous knowledge of
the precepts of Logic. Man is naturally
possessed of reason and genius, and capable
of exerting it with tolerable justness on a
variety of subjects, before he is formally in∣structed
in the rules of reasoning; of him∣self,
he conforms to them, as it were by in∣stinct,
without reflecting or explicitely
knowing what they are. Lay before a
man of ordinary understanding a piece of
just reasoning in any of the sciences, and
he shall be convinced by it, tho' he never
heard of the artificial rules of reasoning, or
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
reflected on the nature and foundation of
the evidence that attends it. It is in fact
only by observing the natural reasonings of
mankind, that just <HI>rules</HI> of reasoning can be
discovered, or an useful theory of evidence
established. But if the natural force of
reason and genius is thought insufficient to
conduct the student thro' the elements of
science, it is easy in teaching them, to make
such occasional observations on the evi∣dence
used, as will be of much greater be∣nefit
than a system of Logic previously
learned, or rather conned by rote. Thus if
one were instructing a pupil to read Poe∣try
with something of taste, who were no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as yet sufficiently qualified for a formal
treatise of Criticism, he would in going thro'
some regular performance, point out its
beauties and faults, and make scattered ob∣servations
on the rules of composition,
which would be of much greater service
than if he had put into his hands a didac∣tic
treatise of precepts, before he had been
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
sufficiently prepared by a perusal of the
works of Poets. We have already observ∣ed
that the several sciences considered
with respect to their evidence form, as it
were, the <HI>sylva,</HI> the natural history of the
human intellect and its operations on
which Logic is built: and as the natural
histories on which the other sciences are
founded, need not confine themselves to
bare narration, but ought to intersperse oc∣casionally
general observations upon the
history, which will promote and prepare
for the philosophical interpretation of
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supersunt additamenta quaedam historiae naturalis utilia, quae eam magis commode in∣flectere et aptare possint ad opus interpretis, quod succedit.—Non abs re fuerit observa∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes quandoque aspergere.—E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iam cano∣nes (qui nil aliud sunt quam observationes generales et catholicae) optime ascribuntur. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erulam.

such observations may be introduced on
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
the arguments used in them and the evi∣dence
attending them, as will in a great
measure make the learner see, as he pro∣ceeds,
the foundations on which he reasons,
and the laws which he observes, and will
at the same time prove an excellent prepa∣ration
to the study of Logic.</P>
<P>LET it be further observed upon this
head, That, by the regulations now esta∣blished
in the Marischal College, all the stu∣dents
being obliged to apply themselves to
the study of Mathematics, how soon they
enter upon the second year of their course,
they are not only prepared by that study,
for understanding natural Philosophy, or
the science of bodies; but are gradually,
and as it were necessarily, led both into an
habit of close attention of mind, and like∣wise
of just and accurate reasoning, by ha∣ving
the most perfect examples of just rea∣soning
laid before them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Geometria partem fatentur esse uti∣lem teneris aetatibus: agitari namque animos, atque acui ingenia, et celeritatem percipiendi venire inde concedunt. Quint. Instit. Lib. 1. See also Mr. Locke on the conduct of the underst. Sect. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="20"/>
WHAT has been said will 'tis hoped a∣bundantly
show that genuine Logic may
with greater propriety and success be
taught as a critical review of the sciences,
than as an introduction to them, and that,
instead of being the first, it ought natural∣ly
to be the last.</P>
<P>IT will not however be improper far∣ther
to take notice of the prejudice that
may arise against the place assigned to Lo∣gic,
from the contrary practice of the
greatest part of the ancient Philosophers.
This will appear to be of small weight, if
we consider what was the nature and de∣sign
of the Logic adopted by them. It is
well known that the ancient Greeks were
above all nations talkative, and fond of ex∣temporary
disputes on either side of any
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
question. Logic was introduced by Zeno
the disciple of Parmenides, as is believed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diog. Laert. praef.</NOTE>
as a help in managing readily and copious∣ly
these disputations, and not as a mean of
discovering truth; accordingly it regarded
not things but words, and consisted of a
collection of observations made on human
conversations, and reduced to general rules
the heads of argument and discourse on a∣ny
subject. When this was the nature, and
this the design of Logic, it had no such de∣pendence
on the other parts of science, as
to require a previous knowledge of them,
and came in naturally enough among the
arts of kin to it, which likewise regarded
language. That this is a just account of
the ancient Logic, can scarce be disputed.
It was seldom applied by the best of the
ancients to the making of discoveries in
the other sciences; and when it was, it
only served to vitiate and fetter their in∣ventions:
its chief use was to serve as a
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
foundation for rhetorical invention and sub∣tlety,
and in this view we find it is al∣ways
considered by Cicero and the other
writers of institutions. Since then the Logic
commonly in use among the ancients re∣garded
only words, but that now introduc∣ed
(of which some of the ancients, especi∣ally
SOCRATES and his disciples, gave
some hints, and which has since been
greatly cultivated by LORD VERULAM,
Mr. LOCKE, and others) regards things
and real knowledge, no argument can be
drawn from the place assigned to that, for
the place which ought to be assigned to
this. But whatever has been the opinion
of Philosophers, it can have very little
weight, in opposition to reason, when men
are solicitous, not about the philosophy of
this or that particular man, but about the
philosophy of nature. The place of Lo∣gic
being once determined, it will be easy
to ascertain the order of the other sciences,
natural Philosophy, Pneumatics, Ethics,
and Politics.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23"/>
ETHICS, or moral Philosophy is founded
as well as Logic on Pneumatics, and must
therefore come after it. The constitution
of man, and his several active powers must
be explained, before his business, his duty,
and his happiness can be discovered. Juris∣prudence
and Politics, taking a more com∣plex
view of man than Morals, by consider∣ing
his various states, as well as his nature
and powers, cannot with any propriety be in∣troduced
till Morals have first been studied.</P>
<P>IT only remains then to determine whe∣ther
natural Philosophy or Pneumatology,
ought in the order of teaching to have the
preference. And many considerations seem
to require that the former should be studi∣ed
first. If it were not, Pneumatology
should be too far disjoined from the practi∣cal
sciences founded on it, one of which,
Logic, ought, as we have seen, to be
taught last of all. Besides, we ought al∣ways
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
to begin with the easiest and most
obvious subjects, and to proceed gradually
to the most difficult; and in order to this
we ought to comply as much as possible,
with the natural openings and progress of
the human mind. Now it is evident that
the mind receives first of all impressions
and ideas of those sensible things with
which it is surrounded. It is not till after
it has exercised its faculties about them
that it reflects on its own operations or ac∣quires
perceptions of them. We are from
our earliest infancy accustomed to observe
external things, tho' often transiently and
inattentively; they lie always in our view,
they force themselves upon us, and we can∣not
avoid regarding them more or less.
But we seldom attend to the operations of
our minds in our earlier years; it is late
before we acquire distinct notions of them,
or can easily and readily make them the
objects of our contemplation. Farther, ex∣ternal
sensation, by which bodies are per∣ceived,
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
is a more palpable kind of evidence,
than internal, from which all our know∣ledge
of spirits is derived; it strikes and
affects us more. The Philosophy of spi∣rits,
as well as that of bodies, is founded
solely on experiments and observations;
but in the latter it is much easier to make
these than in the former: we can put <HI>bo∣dies</HI>
in any situation that we please, and
observe at leisure their effects on one ano∣ther;
but the phoenomena of the <HI>mind</HI> are
of a less constant nature; we must catch
them in an instant, and be content to glean
them up by observing their effects, as they
accidentally discover themselves in the se∣veral
circumstances of life. The reason∣ings
also by which conclusions are deduced
concerning mind are of a more abstruse and
difficult nature than those employed in the
science of bodies; the ideas about which
they are conversant are apter to be con∣founded
with one another, and are with
greater difficulty kept distinct. On all
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
these accounts, natural Philosophy must be
to young minds easier than Pneumatology,
and consequently should be taught first.</P>
<P>THERE remains one part of the scholas∣tic
Philosophy not yet taken notice of, viz.
that part of their Metaphysic which is term∣ed
Ontology. The end it answered in their
system was mentioned already; and since
Philosophy has been set upon another footing,
it is become less necessary than formerly.
Any real knowledge which it contains may
be delivered after all the other sciences. Or
rather, in its place may be substituted a
more useful science,—including the First
Philosophy of Lord Verulam;—at the
same time tracing up the particular causes
of things, as far as possible, to the most ge∣neral
and simple principles, not by abstract
reasonings, or the comparison of general
ideas, but by a legitimate and careful in∣duction;
and vindicating the constitution
of nature by pointing out the final causes
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
of the general laws to which beings are
subjected;—and likewise giving an ac∣count
of the reasonings of learned men on
various subjects considered in an abstract
view, and their opinions and enquiries con∣cerning
questions of an abstruse nature,
such as the existence of matter, space, du∣ration,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>THESE observations will, 'tis hoped, be
sufficient to show that the Masters of the
Marischal College have consulted the na∣tural
connexion of things, in altering the
usual order of teaching Philosophy. On
these principles it is, that they have now e∣stablished
the following general Plan of E∣ducation.</P>
<P>I. THE FIRST year is spent as former∣ly
in Classical Learning under the <HI>Profes∣sor
of Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k;</HI> whose business it is, not only
to teach that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>legant language in which
the sciences were first delivered, and which,
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
by retaining their original terms, and by
being used by those great masters whose
works are still acknowledged standards in
them, must always be regarded as the
foundation of knowledge, but to open the
minds of youth, by explaining antiquity,
by acquainting them with the lives and
characters of the chief classic authors, and
by pointing out the uses of Literature, or
the various purposes it serves in life.</P>
<P>II. IN the NEXT Class, as much of the
student's time as the Professor thinks pro∣per,
is spent in reading the Greek and La∣tin
classics, both that they may still im∣prove
in these languages, the great condu∣its
thro' which ancient learning is commu∣nicated
to us, and that by being conversant
with the best authors, they may early ac∣quire
a taste for works of genius. 2. They
are to be instructed in <HI>History,</HI> both <HI>Na∣tural</HI>
and <HI>Civil,</HI> along with the Elements
of <HI>Geography</HI> and <HI>Chronology,</HI> on which Ci∣vil
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
History depends. The study of these is
judged to be a just intermediate step between
the study of languages and general reason∣ings
concerning things. History conveys
to a young mind instructions adapted to its
faculties, which at the same time open and
prepare it gradually for apprehending the
conclusions of Philosophy. Farther, on the
facts that History, especially natural, relates,
Philosophy, which is but a picture of the
real constitutions and laws of things, must
be entirely sounded. In the prosecution of
it there must be a perpetual intercourse be∣tween
the mind and nature. Philosophy
can never be further improved than in
proportion as History is perfected; our
knowledge in the one and the other must
keep pace, for History relates the phoeno∣mena,
and Philosophy explains and ac∣counts
for them. The study of History,
particularly Natural History, must there∣fore
be proper to precede that of Philoso∣phy,
not only as it opens the mind, but al∣so
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
as it furnishes it with the requisite ma∣terials.
These are parts of knowledge,
entirely omitted in the former method of
university education, tho' of the greatest u∣tility
and moment in life. And it is, they
apprehend, a considerable advantage in
their new plan of teaching, that by it these
useful branches of study are introduced in∣to
the scheme of Education. Natural his∣tory,
besides its advantages already menti∣oned,
is the immediate foundation of al∣most
all the arts of life, agriculture, garde∣ning,
manufactures, medicines, &amp;c. The
professor to whose share it falls, does not
confine it to mere descriptions of natural
bodies, their various classes, characters,
principles and parts; but gives an account
also of the various uses of these natural bo∣dies,
and of the principles of the several
arts in life which depend upon, and are
employed about them. Nor is Civil Histo∣ry
restricted to a narration of Epochs and
facts, tho' in that the foundation is laid,
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
but it extends to an explication of the cau∣ses
of the rise and fall of states, and of the
great revolutions that have happen'd in the
world, and to reflections on characters,
manners, customs, &amp;c. which constitutes
its usefulness in general, and must render
it peculiarly advantageous to young per∣sons,
by conveying moral instruction by
example; by forming a habit of attention
to the great transactions of men; by sup∣plying
their want of experience by that of
others, and by making them in a great
measure acquainted with the world, before
they come to act a part in it. 3. At the
same time the students in this Class attend
the Professor of Mathematics for the Ele∣mentary
parts, as the knowledge of the
mathematical sciences is an absolutely ne∣cessary
key to the Philosophy of bodies.</P>
<P>III. As material Objects are the most
familiar to young minds, and experiments
and reasonings concerning them are most
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
level to their capacities, the students
in the THIRD year of their course, enter on
the study of <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Experimental</HI> Phi∣losophy,
and are instructed in its several
branches, Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneu∣matics,
Optics, Astronomy, Magnetism,
Electricity, and any others which farther
discoveries may add to the parts already
cultivated. 2. They are, as far as time
will allow, instructed in the principles of
Criticism and the <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI> 3. They
at the same time continue their mathe∣matical
studies, so as they may go hand in
hand with their studies in the different
parts of Natural Philosophy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE professor of mathematics, the first year the students are under his care, ex∣plains to them the true principles of Arith∣metic, teaches Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lid's Elements of Geome∣try, plain Trigonometry, Practical Geome∣try, Geography, and the first principles of Algebra. The second year of their Course with him, he teaches Spherical Trigonome∣try, Spherical Geometry, Conic Sections, and Astronomy; and carries his pupils for∣ward to the higher parts of Algebra. The third year he teaches the highest parts of Algebra, the Doctrine of the Quadrature of Curves, and Fluxions, and some parts of Sir I. NEWTON's Principles of Philosophy.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="33"/>
IV. IN the LAST year of the Philoso∣phic
course, are taught, 1. Pneumatology,
or the Natural Philosophy of Spirits, in∣cluding
the doctrine of the nature, faculties,
and states of the human mind,—and Na∣tural
Theology. 2. Moral Philosophy,
containing Ethics, Jurisprudence and Poli∣tics,
the study of these being accompanied
with the perusal of some of the best of the
ancient Moralists. 3. Logic, or the laws
and rules of inventing, proving, retaining,
and communicating knowledge; along
with 4. Metaphysics.</P>
<P>THE three Professors of Philosophy,
and the Professor of Greek attend their
students, three hours a day as formerly, du∣ring
the whole of the session of College,
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
which commences on the first day of No∣vember,
and ends in April.</P>
<P>THE order of the sciences now esta∣blished
was pretty much observed by some
of the ancient Stoics, particularly PANAE∣TIUS
and POSSIDONIUS. EPICTE∣TUS
also in one particular instance insi∣nuates
that he look'd on it as the proper
method.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chirid. cap. 76.</NOTE> It in the main agrees with the
partitions of science laid down by LORD
VERULAM, and perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uits the ge∣nius
of his Philosophy. It appears to be
that in which the sciences will afford most
light to one another, and in which they
will have the most useful influence on life.
It is adapted to the natures and genuine
order of things, and tends to promote the
real knowledge of them. This the Mas∣ters
of the Marischal College have aimed
at in the alteration they have made.
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
They have already begun to experience
the public approbation, by the increase of
the number of their students. They have
now published the reasons which determin∣ed
them to it, and leave mankind to judge
of their solidity and strength.</P>
