<HEAD>AN ANSWER To a late PAMPHLET, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Have always had the utmost Contempt for insignifi∣cant, unreasoning, florid Declamations upon <HI>se∣rious Subjects.</HI> When the most important Concerns of a Nation are at Stake, I confess, it moves my Indignation to see a <HI>little Epigrammatical Politician,</HI> start up, with a Shool-boy's Conceit, dress'd out in the usual Ornaments of such Compositions; especially, when the Author's sordid Purpose stares us full in the Face through every Line.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> which lies before me and gives Occasi∣on to these Thoughts, is indeed such a pompous Jargon of Words, without answering any one Point, or aiming at any End, that it may seem beneath all Criticism; and I find the <HI>Gentlemen concern'd</HI> look upon it in this Light, by not having taken the least Notice of it; but, as many Things become considerable, by some particular Circum∣stances which attend them; so, perhaps, it may be thought that even this <HI>frothy Piece of Pedantry</HI> hath some Value stamp'd upon it by the Approbation of <HI>Those,</HI> who have order'd their <HI>Creatures</HI> to cry it up as an excellent Performance, and taken great Pains to propagate it through the Kingdom. This will, at least, be my Excuse for be∣stowing
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
a few cursory Remaaks upon it, without any Re∣gard to the <HI>Thing</HI> itself, or the <HI>Author</HI> of it.</P>
<P>One Way of exposing the Nothingness of <HI>such Producti∣ons,</HI> is by throwing back the <HI>Shuttlecock;</HI> and making Use of their own little Turns to condemn the Cause, which They mean to defend. That this frivolous Manner of Writing may appear in a stronger Light, I will begin with shewing that, in many Places, the same Sentence, with the Change or Omission only of a Word or two, will read much better on the contrary Side. I hope the <HI>Observator</HI> will not make any Objections to this Method of dallying with Him; since it hath been so often practis'd by his ingenious Brethen, the Writers against the <HI>Craftsman;</HI> and He will perceive, from the Sequel, that it is not my Design to dwell long upon such a trifling Way of answer∣ing an Adversary; but only to expose it, and for the Sake of reviving my Schoolboy's Talent of writing upon a <HI>Theme.</HI></P>
<P>For this Reason, I shall not trouble myself with the personal Circumstances of the <HI>Author.</HI>—Sometimes He <HI>hunts</HI> with the <HI>Minister.</HI> Sometimes, He turns over the mouldy Records of Philosophers, But, by his frequent <HI>Theological Allusions,</HI> and his favourite Peal of <HI>Bells,</HI> He seems to be a <HI>Divine;</HI> whom the Death of the Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> and the <HI>Train-Trow</HI> of Preferments, ensuing upon that Event, have affected with the warm Scent of some <HI>fat Benefice.</HI>—Poor <HI>Caleb!</HI> How the most ordinary Events are turn'd to thy Destruction?</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to the <HI>Author</HI>'s Words, with a few <HI>paraphrastical Alterations,</HI> distinguish'd in <HI>Italicks.</HI></P>
<P><Q>“I am not ignorant of the unequal Terms, upon which He enters the Lists in a Paper-War, who draws his Pen on the defensive Side. Those, who engage the <HI>Hopes,</HI> the <HI>Covetousness,</HI> and the <HI>Ambition</HI> of Mankind to their Party, will generally, I fear, lead more numer∣ous Troops and find much better Encouragement than Those, who sollicit the <HI>Love of their Country</HI> and appeal ”to Justice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“For as most Men have those Passions, whilst few are bless'd with a <HI>publick Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Men are generally more
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
fond of a</HI> PENSION <HI>than a</HI> PILLORY; so the Glare of <HI>Court-Favour,</HI> though nevet so <HI>basely acquir'd,</HI> will dazzle much greater Numbers than the clearest Reasoning and ”most conclusive Arguments will ever enlighten.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But notwithstanding the Disadvantages, which, from the <HI>self interested Disposition of</HI> Human Kind, They some∣times labour under, who undertake the juster Cause; as I flatter myself that on some Occasions, the Honesty of their Minds may recoil against their Propensity to <HI>Flattery,</HI> and will not suffer the Depravity of their Na∣tures <HI>to get the better of their Conciences;</HI> I shall not be deterr'd by the Discouragements I have enumerated from entering into a short Examination of the original Design, Progress and Effects of the Writings <HI>against</HI> the ”<HI>Craftsman.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The first Article of Impeachment is their having <HI>usurp'd a Right of circulating guarded Treasons and weekly Falshoods throughout the Kingdom.</HI>—But before We proceed to the <HI>Defence,</HI> it is necessary to define and settle the Meaning of the Terms made Use of in the <HI>Indict∣ment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> the Phrase, <HI>usurping,</HI> seems to accknowledge that there is an undoubted, indefeazeable Right of <HI>circulating Falshoods</HI> vested in <HI>some Persons;</HI> and that the <HI>Craftsman</HI> is only an <HI>Usurper</HI> of it: If this is really the Case, our Au∣thor is much to be commended for endeavouring to <HI>depose Him;</HI> and for my Part, I am ready to own the Right of <HI>Those,</HI> who have so long exercis'd this <HI>noble Imperfection</HI> with unlimited Authority.</P>
<P>The next remarkable <HI>Term,</HI> made Use of in the <HI>Indict∣ment,</HI> is the Word <HI>circulating;</HI> by which, I presume, We are to understand sending Papers about the Country; and I believe the best <HI>Circulators</HI> will be found on the Side of <HI>this Author</HI> and his <HI>Patrons;</HI> for They have the Clerks of the <HI>Post-Office, Customs</HI> and <HI>Excise;</HI> who are not only in∣dulg'd in the same Privilege with Members of Parliament to <HI>frank Letters,</HI> but may possibly be commanded to take off and disperse many Papers, even at the <HI>publick Expence;</HI> by which Means, They are become the most considerable <HI>Hawkers</HI> in the Kingdom. I am likewise told, that <HI>these Officers</HI> have been lately laid under some Restraints, and
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
prohibited, on Pain of Dismission, from getting a Penny in their Way, by <HI>circulating</HI> any of the <HI>Craftsman</HI>'s <HI>guar∣ded Treasons.</HI> Their chief Business, at present, consists in <HI>circulating weekly Falshoods</HI> and the <HI>unguarded, explicit Trea∣sons</HI> of the <HI>London Journal</HI> and the <HI>Free-Briton.</HI></P>
<P>In the last Place, the Term <HI>guarded Treasons</HI> deserves some Notice.</P>
<P>I never apprehended before, that there was any other Species of <HI>written Treason,</HI> but <HI>asserting the</HI> Pretender'<HI>s Right to the Crown,</HI> or <HI>denying That of his present Majesty King</HI> George, <HI>and the Succession in his Family.</HI> Is the <HI>Crafts∣man</HI> guilty, upon this Article, by constantly and clearly defending the <HI>Principles of the Revolution,</HI> and the <HI>Parlia∣mentary Right of limiting the Succession to the Crown?</HI> No; the <HI>Treason,</HI> with which he stands charg'd, is <HI>guarded Trea∣son.</HI> Guarded by <HI>what?</HI>—By the <HI>Law;</HI> that is, <HI>Treason,</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> hath not declared to be <HI>Treason.</HI> I don't like, by any Means, this new Species of <HI>Treason,</HI> which is not to be found in our <HI>Statute-Books. Guarded Treason,</HI> in the Hands of a <HI>guarded Minister,</HI> may prove very dange∣rous. I take <HI>this Term,</HI> according to its natural Interpre∣tation, to mean something, which might be wrested into <HI>Treason</HI> in a Court of Justice, if the <HI>Law</HI> did not <HI>guard</HI> the <HI>pretended Delinquent;</HI> something, which would be call'd <HI>Treason,</HI> if We had an <HI>Attorney-General,</HI> and <HI>no Law;</HI> but is not <HI>Treason,</HI> since we have <HI>Law,</HI> as well as an <HI>Attorney-General.</HI>—This same <HI>Law</HI> is a strange, uncourtly, uncom∣plaisant Sort of a Thing; and ties up the Hands of an <HI>an∣gry Minister,</HI> in a most unreasonable Manner.</P>
<P>But since <HI>this Writer</HI> hath thought fit to coin a new Species of <HI>Treason,</HI> I must put him in Mind, that there is not a more heinous Kind of Treason, than to undermine those Foundations of the Constitution, which equally sup∣port the <HI>Rights of the Crown,</HI> and the <HI>Liberties of the Peo∣ple.</HI> They are inseparably cemented together; and he, who attempts to shake the <HI>one,</HI> must of Course weaken the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>Before I leave this Head, I must just take Notice that the Case of poor Mr. <HI>D' Anvers,</HI> seems to be very odd and extraordinary. Whilst he is openly threaten'd with Cor∣rection by <HI>one Writer,</HI> who is a <HI>profess'd Nonjuring Parson,</HI> for being <HI>too much a Whig,</HI> and having spoken disrespect∣fully
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
of some of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> he is charg'd by <HI>another</HI> (I might say by <HI>several others</HI>) with being a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and ha∣ving a Design to set up the <HI>Pretender,</HI> who claims the Crown, as Heir of <HI>that Family.</HI>—This is somewhat like the Case of our Countrymen in the Reign of <HI>Harry the Eight;</HI> when they were <HI>hang'd</HI> for being <HI>Papists,</HI> and <HI>burn'd</HI> for being <HI>Protestants; Dij immortales!</HI> (cry'd a <HI>Fo∣reigner) quomodo vivunt Homines in istis Regionibus? Suspen∣duntur</HI> Papistici; <HI>comburuntur Anti-Papistici.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>Author of the Observations</HI> should likewise prove to be a <HI>Nonjuring Parson,</HI> (as the Town generally supposes him to be) I leave it to be consider'd whether his Resent∣ment against the <HI>Writings of the Craftsman,</HI> may not pro∣ceed from the <HI>same Motives,</HI> which actuate his Brother <HI>Earbery;</HI> and whether he might not think the most politick Way of venting his Spleen, was to take upon himself the Character of a <HI>Courtier,</HI> and write under the Disguise of an Advocate for the <HI>Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed in our Author's Strain.</P>
<P><Q>“P. 7. <HI>A certain,</HI> GREAT MAN hath, by a sort of Pa∣pal Authority, taken upon him to <HI>dictate to his Fellow-labourers in the Ministry,</HI> as dogmatically, as unfairly, and as ignorantly as his Holiness; <HI>and to impose his</HI> Opinions <HI>and</HI> Measures <HI>as infallible; and when</HI> Experience <HI>hath proved the</HI> one <HI>erroneous,</HI> and the <HI>other unsuccessful,</HI> his In∣vention supplies his <HI>Wisdom, endeavouring to correct</HI> the ”past Blunder <HI>with a</HI> fresh one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But unless he could contrive that the Reading of <HI>pub∣lick Papers</HI> should be prohibited to <HI>the English,</HI> as the Gospel is to the Followers of the Pope, his Frauds may chance to be detected; the Sect of <HI>political Jansenists</HI> in∣crease; ”and his <HI>Bills</HI> not received with implicit Faith.</Q></P>
<P>I had once resolved to pass over <HI>this Paragraph</HI> of our Author, which contains some indecent Reflections on our worthy Friend the <HI>Cardinal.</HI> Far be it from me, to di∣sturb that sacred and mysterious Union between <HI>two great Ministers;</HI> by which, at the same Time, the <HI>Papal Domi∣nion</HI> is strenghtened in <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Protestant Succession</HI> supported in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Craftsman</HI> treats the <HI>Minister</HI> too roughly; on which Occasion our <HI>Author</HI> makes the following Reflecti∣on.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>P. S. <Q>For as the Brutality of an Executioner does not “prove the Innocence of him who suffers; so it is possi∣ble for a Criminal to deserve his Punishment, though ”one abhors the Hand that inflicts it.</Q></P>
<P>It appears from hence, that it is the <HI>Brutality of the At∣tack,</HI> and not the <HI>Innocence of the Party attacked,</HI> which hath induced the <HI>Author</HI> to publish these notable <HI>Observa∣tions;</HI> but is not the <HI>Law</HI> to be put in Execution, because <HI>Jack Ketch</HI> may sometimes behave himself a little but∣cherly in his Office?—I confess, indeed, that <HI>Halters,</HI> and <HI>Axes,</HI> and <HI>Pillories,</HI> and <HI>Scaffolds,</HI> are not very agree∣able Objects either to a <HI>good-natur'd</HI> or a <HI>wicked Man;</HI> but whatever <HI>this Author</HI> may think of them, I am sure his <HI>Patron</HI> will allow that they have been of some Use to <HI>his Administration,</HI> and ought not to be laid intirely aside.</P>
<P>P. 9. <Q>Many pompous Professons <HI>are daily made for the “Design of their</HI> Undertaking. Private Views were the Mask or publick Good; the Spirit of <HI>Slavery affects the Dress and Language</HI> of the Spirit of Liberty; the Wel∣fare of the Nation, and Loyalty to the King, are made the plausible Pretences, for throwing amongst the Peo∣ple, <HI>such Doctrines as tend to the Destruction of his Govern∣ment.</HI>”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“For a little while, indeed, all the Arrows in <HI>their</HI> Quiver, seem'd to be directed solely at one Mark; <HI>a Gentleman, who happened to vent a Piece of</HI> guarded Trea∣son <HI>in the House of Commons; preferring the Safety of the</HI> ”Nation <HI>to the Preservation of the</HI> Minister.</Q></P>
<P>But if I am righly informed of that Affair, (which hath been so often exaggarated as a bloody-minded Vow) it was no more than a warm Expression, signifying his Re∣solution to do what in him lay, to destroy the Power of the <HI>Minister;</HI> for he immediately added, as a Reason, that he would otherwise destroy the Nation; and if all his At∣tempts to fulfil <HI>this Vow</HI> should prove unsuccessful, it is to be feared, that the <HI>prophetical Part</HI> of his Speech, will soon be too amply verify'd.</P>
<P>If <HI>this Gentleman</HI> made any additional Vow, not to <HI>eat</HI> or <HI>drink,</HI> till he had done the Nation this Piece of Service, the <HI>present, plump Condition</HI> of his Person, is a plain Proof that he hath broke it most flagrantly; and he hath only rais'd his Adversary to a Parallel with St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>What an Honour is it for St. <HI>Paul</HI> to be the Type of a <HI>first Minister</HI> of three Kingdoms? If the <HI>Sir</HI> does not come quite up to the <HI>Saint,</HI> can it be denied that he resembles him in <HI>some Circumstances?</HI> Hath not the <HI>Minister</HI> been in <HI>Prison,</HI> as well as the <HI>Saint?</HI>—Hath he not been in Perils amogst <HI>false Brethren?</HI>—Hath he not renounc'd the <HI>Prin∣ciples,</HI> which he once espous'd with great Zeal?—Is not this <HI>he,</HI> who formerly persecuted <HI>frenchify'd Ministers,</HI> and who now preacheth up the glad Tidings of a <HI>French Al∣lyance?</HI>—O, may the <HI>Sir Minister</HI> never stand in need of the <HI>Saint</HI>'s <HI>Basket?</HI>—How impotent is this <HI>Ananias</HI> of a <HI>Craftsman,</HI> who hath not been yet able to <HI>open his Eyes?</HI>— How thick and adherent must those <HI>Scales</HI> be, which scarce a <HI>Miracle</HI> can make to fall off?</P>
<P>P. 11. <Q>However <HI>as</HI> the whole Stream of their Ma∣lice, “for some Time, flow'd only in this Channel, to vi∣lify this <HI>great</HI> Minister's Name; <HI>so, on the other hand, no less Industry and Art were used to extoll</HI> his Conduct; <HI>to magnify</HI> his Services; <HI>to brighten</HI> his Character; <HI>and for∣tify</HI> his Credit with his Prince. All Hands were em∣ploy'd; and all Engines set at work. <HI>Letters were for∣ged and pretended to be intercepted at the Post-Office, in which the Continuance of his Administration was represented of the utmost Importance to publick Credit;</HI> the Press was loaded; Coffee-house <HI>Lyons,</HI> Table-<HI>Spies,</HI> and Bottle Compani∣ons had their Instructions given them; the grossest Fal∣shoods were inculcated in the grossest Terms; the sa∣cred <HI>Recesses of Families were invaded; the more sacred Re∣putation of the Fair Sex was violated; private Conversation was made the Subject of perjur'd Affidavits;</HI> and the Laws of Nature, Custom, Principle, Morality and Society ”trampled upon and broken.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Minerva<HI>'s,</HI> Fames with <HI>double Trumpet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</HI> and all the fa∣bulous Machinery of the Ancients, were introduced to oppose the <HI>Sejanus</HI>'s, and <HI>Wolsey</HI>'s <HI>of former Ages, and the</HI> Menzikoffs, Coscia's <HI>and</HI> Mackheaths <HI>of later Dates. Ita∣licks</HI> grew so familiar on both sides, that it occasioned even a ”new Foundery of those Letters.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But still the <HI>great Man</HI> was able to repel the Weapons of his Adversaries, by the <HI>Superior</HI> Temper of his <HI>Metal. His Quiet was invulnerable,</HI> (pardon the Impropriety of the Au∣thor's Expression, which is the Effect of his being already dry-brain'd
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
of Epithets) <HI>and he contemn'd Accusations, which his</HI> well-temper'd <HI>Conscience did not</HI> feel; <HI>he</HI> mistook <HI>the</HI> Voice of the People <HI>for the</HI> Voice of his personal Enemies; <HI>con∣sider'd all their Clamour as the Effect of Competition, Disappointment, and a Tax upon Royal Favour.</HI> Oh! may he place <HI>this Tax</HI> to the Account of the <HI>Sinking Fund</HI> ”in lieu of those Sums, which he hath taken from it!</Q></P>
<P>When our Author made his pretty Observation, that the most <HI>illuminated Bodies</HI> have the <HI>deepest Shadows,</HI> he seems to have had St. <HI>Peter</HI> in his Eye, whom the People follow'd in Crowds, to be <HI>bless'd with the Sweep of his Sha∣dow, as he pass'd by;</HI> and he wou'd, no doubt, have intro∣duc'd <HI>this Apostle,</HI> as well as St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in his Pangerick, had it not been for that unlucky Circumstance in the Hi∣story of his Life; <HI>Silver and Gold have I none.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing is more observable than the sudden Tran∣sitions of <HI>this Author,</HI> and his Skill in jumbling inco∣herent Metaphors together, as will appear from the fol∣lowing Paragraph.</P>
<P>P. 13. <Q>But when this Scent became so cold, that po∣litical “sportsmen grew weary of following a <HI>Pack of Ani∣mals, (now you see, they are</HI> Hounds) who were always barking at a Prey they could not wound, and following what they could not overtake; and that these Writers had <HI>rung the Changes (now they are</HI> Ringers) on the Words <HI>Corruption, Bribery, Male-Administration, Oppres∣sion</HI> and <HI>Injustice,</HI> till People were so habituated to the <HI>Vox &amp; praeterea nihil,</HI> that the <HI>Peal</HI> laid those to <HI>sleep,</HI> ”whom the <HI>Ringers</HI> propos'd it should <HI>alarm.</HI></Q></P>
<P>He might have added <HI>five more Bells</HI> to this Peal, and made it compleat; <HI>French-Allyances, Depredations, Dun∣kirk, Hessians, Irish-Recruits;</HI> and if He had been at a lit∣tle more Pains, He might have even furnish'd out a <HI>Dutch Chime.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>dear Sir,</HI> let me advise you to be a little more spar∣ing of your <HI>Metaphors,</HI> or to chuse them better. Take my Word for it, that the <HI>barking of Dogs,</HI> and the <HI>jangling o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bells,</HI> are two of the most unlikely Things you could hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possibly hit upon, to lull any Body a-sleep. Why, a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must read three or four Pages even of your <HI>own Works</HI> before he can possibly get a Nap, either in a <HI>Bell-fry</HI> or <HI>Dog-Kennel.</HI>—But if the <HI>Craftsman</HI>'s <HI>Bells</HI> have laid Thos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
to sleep, <HI>whom he propos'd to alarm,</HI> why so angry good Mr. <HI>Observator?</HI> And wherefore do you run the Risque of di∣sturbing the good People in their Slumbers, by these un∣necessary Remarks?—I am sure it is your Business to let them <HI>doze on</HI> as long as they please; and I think your <HI>Pa∣tron</HI> is much oblig'd to Mr. <HI>D' Anvers</HI> for <HI>ringing</HI> them in∣to such <HI>political Lethargy,</HI> just as Nurses <HI>sing</HI> their Children a-sleep, when they have a mind to be merry.</P>
<P>The succeeding Paragraphs ought to be treated with more Gravity and Respect, on Account of that <HI>sacred Name,</HI> which is introduc'd almost in every Line; though it is well known that his <HI>present Majesty</HI> had no Hand in those Measures, which brought the Nation into that <HI>dan∣gerous</HI> and <HI>uncertain Situation,</HI> which he lamented and com∣plain'd of in his <HI>Speech</HI> to his first Parliament. No Endea∣vours were spared, indeed, by the Authors of the Mis∣carriages of the former Reign, to shift the Burthen upon their new Master; a more severe Attack on his Honour, than all the misconstrued Allusions of the <HI>Craftsman,</HI> from the <HI>Conquest</HI> to this Moment; for notwithstanding the <HI>Au∣thor</HI>'s Dilemma, a King may be warn'd of the Iniquities of his <HI>Minister,</HI> without calling in question the Goodness either of his <HI>Heart</HI> or his <HI>Head;</HI> and to affirm the contra∣ry, is at once to overturn all the political Maxims of the <HI>Law,</HI> and the Constitution of <HI>England.</HI> Princes may have Reasons, which it is not proper to declare. I have known an <HI>Architect</HI> left to finish a Building, in a very bad Style of his own contriving; and a very unskilful <HI>Engineer</HI> kept to look after a <HI>Machine</HI> of his own framing, because no body else would undertake to correct its constant, erroneous Motions, when it was more proper to pull it to Pieces than endeavour to set it right.</P>
<P>The next Paragraph charges the <HI>Craftsman</HI> with <HI>flatter∣ing the King,</HI> and <HI>cajoling the Mob.</HI> As to the <HI>King,</HI> the greatest Respect that can be paid to any Prince, is to tell him <HI>Truth;</HI> and I do not remember that any other Art hath been made use of by the <HI>Craftsman.</HI> As to the <HI>Peo∣ple,</HI> whom this Author calls the <HI>Mob,</HI> I answer in the Syle of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> (and yet I protest I am no <HI>Parson) if this Counsel is not founded on Truth and Reason, it will come to nought.</HI> It is impossible to make People uneasy with <HI>Grie∣vances,</HI> which they do not <HI>feel. Faction</HI> is always impotent, when the Administration is <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>honest.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>It is remarkable, that all the Writers of <HI>this Stamp,</HI> are very angry with the People for reading and admiring the <HI>Craftsman.</HI> Our Author speaks of them; at the Begin∣ning of his Pamphlet, like brute Beasts, having no <HI>Under∣standing;</HI> though I shrewdly suspect that his Anger pro∣ceeds from their discovering <HI>too much Understanding,</HI> to be <HI>cajol'd</HI> by him and his Patrons. This puts me in mind of Mr. <HI>Sparkish</HI> in the Play, who being sensible that his Follies laid him open to <HI>Satire</HI> and <HI>Ridicule,</HI> took up an Aversion to <HI>all Writers,</HI> and breaks out into the following Exclama∣tion.—Damn all your silly Authors whatever; all Books and Boooksellers, by the World; and all Readers, cour∣teous and uncourteous.</P>
<P>Let us consider the Circumstances of the Writers of the <HI>Craftsman,</HI> as they are stated by the <HI>Author;</HI> and here it is proper to take notice, that he set out with telling us, that it was his Design to <HI>consider their Allegations, without entering into the</HI> Characters <HI>of Those, who advance them;</HI> though he begins, in the very next Line, with calling Names; and, in this Place, They are said to be a Set of <HI>idle, desperate</HI> Fellows, who have <HI>no Characters to lose,</HI> and <HI>nothing worse to fear; inured to</HI> Hanging; (which is one of the worst <HI>Habits</HI> a Man can be addicted to) <HI>perpetually declaring against the Pretender,</HI> and inculcating Principles absolutely destruc∣tive of his Interest; yet at the same Time incensing the <HI>present Government.</HI> I believe I may add, that <HI>these Writers</HI> have no <HI>Pensions, Salaries,</HI> or <HI>Gratuities</HI> for their Papers, besides the weekly Contributions of their <HI>loving Readers.</HI> —From whence then can their <HI>Expectations</HI> arise? The <HI>Great Man</HI> attack'd (however <HI>this Author</HI> may flatter Him) is far from being an Object of <HI>Envy</HI> to any of them (as much as they are <HI>inur'd to the Danger of</HI> Hanging) and, whatever he may imagine, of personal Hatred to none. From whence then arises their <HI>Zeal?</HI> In my Opinion, <HI>their Conduct,</HI> accor∣ding to this Description, seems to be more Apostolick than those of the <HI>Minister;</HI> for they must be whimsical Fellows beyond Imagination, who court <HI>Preferment</HI> by disobliging <HI>These,</HI> who can bestow it, and try to advance the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Interest, by preaching up <HI>Republican Principles;</HI> which is so far from being true, that it is the universal Opinion, that for <HI>one Jacobite</HI> the <HI>Craftsman</HI> hath made, <HI>a certain great Man</HI> hath made his <HI>Thousands;</HI> and whosoever deals in the Manu∣facture of <HI>Jacobite-making,</HI> the <HI>Minister</HI> must always supply the Materials.</P>

<Q>My Lord, you are in a wrong Way; long; im∣passable; “ill-accommodated; and beset with Robbers.

<P>I believe every Man, who is sufficiently informed, will allow the <HI>Prince,</HI> whom the Author mentions, to have all the good Qualities, which he hath enumerated, and ma∣ny more. What distinguishes him from most Persons of his high Rank, is Sincerity and Integrity; and one may truly affirm, that an <HI>honest Man</HI> is a greater Character than the <HI>greatest Monarch</HI> without those Virtues. But, at the same Time, I will say that the great, personal Qualities of the Prince, are the most injudicious Topicks in the World for a <HI>Minister</HI> to insist upon, when <HI>National Affairs</HI> are evidently in a <HI>bad Situation;</HI> for, in such a Case, as much as the Character of the <HI>Prince</HI> rises, so much must his <HI>own</HI> sink.—Let us consider this Matter quite specu∣latively, without affirming or denying any Thing; but by Way of Supposition only.

<HI>Ebbs</HI> and <HI>Flows, Vicissitudes</HI> and <HI>Fluctuations</HI> in the Affairs of <HI>Peace and War,</HI> under a Prince of known <HI>Constancy, and whose Abilities are equal to his Application;</HI> such an unusual Conjunction of <HI>Royal Virtues</HI> and <HI>Royal Beams,</HI> amidst so many <HI>national Misfortunes,</HI> will undoubtedly make the <HI>Shade of the Minister still deeper.</HI> The People may very justly complain, in such a Case, that their Business is car∣ried on, in a <HI>Congress,</HI> too much by the <HI>same Methods,</HI> by which it is managed <HI>at home;</HI> and that their Welfare hath been made too subservient to the Interest of <HI>another Nation;</HI> which (to use the Words of <HI>our Author) I am not able to name without blushing;</HI> for I must observe that these <HI>Ebbs</HI> and <HI>Flows of the Power and Interests of Europe,</HI> which he complains of, are so far from being any <HI>Excuse</HI> for bad Measures, that they are the properest <HI>Tools</HI> for an <HI>able Minister</HI> to work with; and are the most easily turn'd, by a Man of <HI>Parts</HI> and <HI>Dexterity,</HI> to the Advantage of his own Country; by never dipping it deep in any of the Quarrels of <HI>Europe;</HI> but keeping all its Princes in a De∣pendance on us, as their only <HI>Mediator</HI> and <HI>Resort</HI> in all Cases.—How weak is it therefore to urge that there have been <HI>no Errors and Defects in the Councils of Great-Britain;</HI> but that the <HI>Vicissitudes and Fluctuations of human Affairs,</HI> have been the Cause of our continuing, for so many Years together, in our present unhappy Situation, <HI>without any Vicissitude?</HI>—There is a <HI>certain Place</HI> in the World, where <HI>this Author's Friend</HI> knows very well how to turn the <HI>Ebbs</HI> and <HI>Flows</HI> of some Affairs, to his own Advan∣tage; and it is extremely unhappy for <HI>England,</HI> that his Genius does not extend farther than that <HI>narrow District.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Author</HI> seems to be very well acquainted with the Method of facilitating <HI>domestick Measures;</HI> and hath poin∣ted out the true Reason why they are more easily ma∣nag'd in <HI>Parliament,</HI> than <HI>foreign Transactions</HI> at a <HI>Congress;</HI> because, in the former Case, <HI>each Particular</HI> finds his di∣stinct <HI>Interest</HI> in a ready Compliance on the <HI>right Side</HI> of the Question.</P>
<P>One would imagine, indeed, by the Multiplicity of <HI>Treaties,</HI> which have been lately concluded, that they were as easily made as <HI>Acts of Parliament;</HI> and, perhaps, it would be happy for the Nation, if <HI>some</HI> of them could be as easily <HI>repeal'd.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>He tells us, in the next Paragraph, <HI>That our</HI> Credit <HI>is at as high a Mark as ever it was known to stand;</HI> and that our <HI>Trade,</HI> though it is at present in a very <HI>bad Way,</HI> will some Time or other be in a <HI>better.</HI> But does he want to be told, that the <HI>low Condition of our Trade</HI> is one of the principal Causes of the <HI>high Condition of,</HI> what he calls, <HI>our Credit?</HI> I mean, that since People cannot employ their Money in <HI>Trade,</HI> they are forc'd either to buy <HI>Stock,</HI> or let it lye dead? But what is our <HI>Credit?</HI> Why, the <HI>publick Debts;</HI> which are not the <HI>Riches,</HI> but the <HI>Poverty</HI> of the Nation; so that if this Observation is true, we have no Reason to rejoice at the high Condition of the <HI>one,</HI> and ought to lament the very low Condition of the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>Supposing we were to make <HI>two Inventories;</HI> the one of the <HI>Minister,</HI> and the other of the <HI>Nation,</HI> when it was de∣liver'd into his Hands; I am afraid we should find a pro∣digious Variation in the <HI>Ballance</HI> at present. It would seem too invidious a Task for me to expatiate on the sur∣prizing Increase of the <HI>former;</HI> and many People do not scruple to affirm, that the <HI>latter</HI> hath continued gradually declining in Proportion. They form, I hope without Reason, a long Bill of melancholy Particulars; <HI>Alliances</HI> inverted; exalting <HI>those Powers,</HI> which we ought to re∣duce, and depressing <HI>those,</HI> which we ought to support; impracticable Treaties; Hermorphrodite Measures, nei∣ther Peace nor War; Insults upon the Element, where we used to ride triumphant; Decay of Trade, without Abatement of Industry; Connivances at the Breach of the most solemn Stipulations; Complaints, where we us'd to threaten, and Supplications, where we were wont to compel; Troops, Taxes, and Increase of publick Debts; (the sole Fruits of <HI>eghteen Years Peace</HI>) and, to use the <HI>Author</HI>'s Ex∣pression, that we are reduc'd to the <HI>Option</HI> of breaking with the <HI>Emperor</HI> or <HI>Spain;</HI> and, by pauning our most va∣luable Concerns into the Hands of a proud, exasperated Nation, to purchase a War with our <HI>natural Allies.</HI></P>
<P>The next remarkable <HI>Observation</HI> of our Author, is a round Assertion, that the Charge of <HI>Corruption</HI> is intirely ground∣less. Perhaps, it might be dangerous for me to contra∣dict him in this Particular, if I had not the concurrent Testimony of the <HI>whole Legislature,</HI> that <HI>Corruption</HI> pre∣vail'd to a very great Degree <HI>without Doors,</HI> by the <HI>glorious
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Act,</HI> which they made to prevent it for the future; and the <HI>Bill,</HI> which afterwards passed our present, uncorrupt <HI>House of Commons,</HI> is a Proof of their Apprehensions that it might have imperceptibly insinuated itself even <HI>within Doors;</HI> for Persons never tye themselves up from Play, but when they are conscious of some natural Propensity of <HI>Gaming.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, our <HI>Author</HI> would willingly confine the Notion of <HI>Corruption,</HI> to the Practice of selling Employments for <HI>Money;</HI> and defies us to produce one <HI>single Instance</HI> of it.— <HI>Alas!</HI> what Occasion is there to give <HI>Money</HI> for Places, when we all know, that they are often got for a WORD speaking?—<HI>Aye</HI>—and a <HI>short one</HI> too?</P>
<P><Q>“But, <HI>says he,</HI> had all these Representations they had made of the <HI>Decline, Contempt</HI> and <HI>Corruption</HI> of our Situ∣ation been <HI>faithful Reports,</HI> where must the <HI>Odium</HI> have ”fallen but on the HEAD <HI>of our State.</HI></Q></P>
<P>How unfortunate is it for me, that I can hardly ever agree with <HI>this Writer?</HI> For supposing, as he does, that all these Representations of our Circumstances had been true, I think the <HI>Head of our State</HI> ought to be the last Person, on whom the <HI>Odium</HI> should fall. Whatever our Condition is at present, his Majesty found us in it. The <HI>Decline, Contempt, and Corruption of our Situation,</HI> were as loudly complain'd of, before he came to the Throne, as They have been since. It is therefore not only unjust, but monstrously insolent to tax Him with our Misfortunes, and mark him out to the People, as the proper Object of their <HI>Odium</HI> and <HI>Resentment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Where must the</HI> Odium <HI>have fallen but on the</HI> Head <HI>of our State?</HI>—I'll tell this Author. It ought, in my Opinion, to have fallen on the HEAD <HI>of the Ministry,</HI> or rather on THE <HI>Minister</HI> (if any such can be found) who had long ago, engrossed the sole Direction of all Affairs into his own Hands; who would admit of no Partner or Adviser in his Administration; but made himself answerable for the Consequence of his own wild Schemes; and, by a long Course of arbitrary Mismanagement, brought these Cala∣mities on the Nation.</P>
<P>Had our Affairs taken a <HI>prosperous Turn,</HI> no-body should have been more ready than my self, to ascribe the Glory of them to the <HI>Head of our State;</HI> but to fix the Odium of
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
<HI>unsuccessful Measures</HI> on the <HI>King,</HI> and say that the <HI>Deme∣rit</HI> would have been <HI>only his,</HI> is such an Insult upon the Throne, as I cannot think of without Horror. It is ma∣king a <HI>Screen</HI> of Majesty; an audacious Interposition of the sacred Character of the <HI>Prince,</HI> to protect the <HI>Minister;</HI> and all the <HI>dull Flattery</HI> that follows, is far from being any Extenuation of his <HI>Guilt.</HI></P>
<P>He proceeds thus. <Q>Nor hath the indefatigable Assi∣duity “of Mr. <HI>D' Anvers,</HI> for the Service of his Majesty, confin'd it self meerly to the Advancement of his Ho∣nour as a <HI>King,</HI> but with equal Good-will, extended it ”self even to the Care of his <HI>domestick Happiness.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“In this View (for in what other could it be?) he hath, with a <HI>Morality</HI> not inferiour to his <HI>Loyalty,</HI> not only da∣red to insult the Majesty of the <HI>best Queen,</HI> but endea∣voured to cast a Shade over the Virtues of the <HI>best Wo∣man.</HI>”</Q></P>
<P>He then sits down, like a great <HI>Apelles,</HI> to draw her Ma∣jesty's Picture, and very judiciously begins with those Qualities, which bear the nearest Relation to his own Cir∣cumstances; as her <HI>Liberality,</HI> or Readiness to <HI>give;</HI> her <HI>Affability,</HI> or Easiness to be <HI>solicited;</HI> and her <HI>Benevolence,</HI> or Good-nature to the <HI>Officious.</HI></P>
<P>I shall take no Notice of his other <HI>Familiarities</HI> with her Majesty's Character; which can receive no Advan∣tage from such course Daubing; but as all the Arrows, level'd at the <HI>Craftsman,</HI> have been taken out of this Qui∣ver; and he is constantly charg'd with a Design against the <HI>present Royal Family</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> I will endeavour to explain this Affair a little to Those, who have some <HI>Understanding,</HI> as well as <HI>Passions.</HI></P>
<P>The Government of <HI>England</HI> consists of <HI>three Parts,</HI> or <HI>Estates,</HI> (the <HI>King,</HI> the <HI>Lords,</HI> and the <HI>Commons</HI>) who have <HI>one Joint-interest,</HI> though their <HI>Powers</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> are se∣parate and distinct. This is call'd our <HI>Constitution;</HI> which every honest Man ought to regard in the <HI>first Place,</HI> and to consider each <HI>particular Branch</HI> of it in a <HI>secondary Light</HI> only. The separate Interest of the <HI>Parts</HI> is one Thing. The united Interest of the <HI>whole</HI> is another; and superi∣our to them all, when <HI>distinctly</HI> consider'd. Whoever con∣tends for the <HI>Constitution,</HI> in general, must be a Friend to all the <HI>Parts,</HI> of which it is compos'd; whereas Those,
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
who endeavour by Adulation, or other base Means, to ex∣alt the Power of any <HI>one</HI> Branch of it above the <HI>others,</HI> is an Enemy to the <HI>whole;</HI> which must be destroy'd, if his Endeavours succeed.—I will speak a little more plainly on this Subject; as every <HI>Englishman</HI> hath a Right to do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Craftsman</HI> hath asserted the Doctrine of <HI>Liberty,</HI> with a View to the Interest of the <HI>Nation in general,</HI> and without any <HI>particular Applications.</HI> He hath shewn that <HI>Liberty</HI> is the fundamental Basis of our Constitution; and that it cannot be preserv'd, without keeping the Spirit of it alive. He hath produc'd Instances, from History, of various Attempts, in various Reigns, against the <HI>Liberty</HI> of his Country; sometimes by <HI>Ministers;</HI> sometimes by <HI>Kings,</HI> and sometimes by <HI>Queens;</HI> which he hath apply'd to his <HI>general Doctrine;</HI> and shewn that when the <HI>Spirit of Liber∣ty</HI> hath been preserv'd, all these Attempts have proved vain and abortive.—To say that he does this with a <HI>Ja∣cobite View</HI> (as the little Fry of Scriblers against him have asserted) is trifling and insignificant.—It is done with a manifest View to preserve the <HI>Constitution,</HI> and <HI>the present Royal Family;</HI> which was placed at the Head of the Government, to preserve the Constitution upon <HI>these Prin∣ciples,</HI> and <HI>no other;</HI> for even the HEAD <HI>of our State</HI> (to use the <HI>Author</HI>'s Phrase) is but one <HI>Branch of our Constituti∣on,</HI> and ought to be look'd upon only in this Light. He is restrained by <HI>Laws</HI> as well as the <HI>others;</HI> and bound by an <HI>Oath</HI> to maintain Them?—I am sure This is the Principle of an <HI>honest Briton.</HI> It is the Principle of the <HI>present Establishment;</HI> and of the Revolution, upon which it is founded. Let it not be said, that I mention the <HI>Re∣volution,</HI> as a menacing Insinuation, or with any View to <HI>another.</HI> I mention it for the Honour of his <HI>present Maje∣sty,</HI> as his Title is establish'd upon that <HI>glorious Foundation;</HI> (which ought never to be forgot;) and, I hope, the Crown of these Realms will continue in his <HI>Royal Family,</HI> till Time shall be no more; but it must continue upon this <HI>Principle of Liberty;</HI> and <HI>Those Men,</HI> who endeavour to instill any other Notions into his Royal Breast, are the most dangerous Enemies to his Government. They are <HI>vile Flatterers,</HI> and <HI>detestable Sycophants;</HI> who have been the worst Bane of Princes in all Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/>The Argumentation of our Author, upon this Head, is therefore as awkard as his <HI>Panegyrick.</HI> He taxes the <HI>Craftsman</HI> with drawing a Parallel between <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth's <HI>Queen,</HI> and her <HI>present Majesty;</HI> and yet, at the same Time, gives the plainest Reason in the World, from the Matter of Fact mentioned by the <HI>Craftsman,</HI> that he could not mean it as such; <HI>because the Circumstances do not agree.</HI>—There is certainly a wide Difference between a Paralell, and an Example; between an Invective and an Admonition; between a Conduct, erroneous in some Par∣ticulars, and a Character absolutely vicious.—I will leave the World to judge, which of the <HI>two,</HI> most proba∣bly intends the <HI>Ship-wreck;</HI> he, who sets up the <HI>Beacon;</HI> or he, who takes it away?—Where the rough <HI>Spirit of Liberty</HI> hath hurt one Prince, the smooth, deceitful Voice of <HI>Flattery,</HI> hath destroy'd a Thousand.—<HI>Charnock, King,</HI> and <HI>Keys,</HI> (those execrable Conspirators against our im∣mortal Deliverer, King <HI>William</HI>) were not so dangerous as a <HI>Minister,</HI> who endeavours to persuade his Prince, that every Piece of <HI>extra-ministerial Advice,</HI> is an Arraignment of his Conduct; and that all <HI>Information from</HI> private <HI>Per∣sons</HI> reflects upon his <HI>own Circumspection.</HI></P>
<P>Upon reading over the <HI>Arret</HI> against the <HI>forty Advocates,</HI> who have lately made an Attempt to revive the Power of the Parliaments of <HI>France,</HI> I cannot help thinking, that <HI>our Author</HI> had a Sight of it, before it was publish'd, and made it the Model of his Observations; for it is observa∣ble, that They <HI>both</HI> run in the <HI>some Style;</HI> and that the Principles of <HI>Liberty,</HI> which They condemn, are not very unlike.—These <HI>Lawyers,</HI> for Instance, assert, that, <HI>by the Constitution of the Kingdom, the</HI> Parliaments <HI>are the Se∣nate of the Nation;</HI> the <HI>sovereign Tribunal,</HI> and <HI>Depositories of the Laws of the State;</HI> that They have the <HI>Representative Character of the publick Authority;</HI> and that the LAWS <HI>are true Conventions between Those, who</HI> govern, <HI>and Those, who are</HI> governed —These Doctrines are call'd, in the <HI>Ar∣ret, A criminal Attempt to lessen the Respect of</HI> the People, <HI>for the King's Supreme Authority; seditious; and tending to disturb the publick Tranquility.</HI> For this Reason, the <HI>Pam∣phlet,</HI> in which these pernicious Principles are contain'd, is order'd to be torn in Pieces; Mr. <HI>Lottin,</HI> the Printer (who seems to be the <HI>Francklin</HI> of <HI>France</HI>) is commanded
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
to produce the <HI>Written Copy;</HI> and the <HI>forty Advocates,</HI> who have subscribed it, have a Month allow'd them to sign a <HI>formal Recantation;</HI> in Default of which, They are to be suspended from all their <HI>Functions,</HI> and left to the <HI>farther Rigour</HI> and <HI>Severity of the Law,</HI> as the Importance of the Matter requires.</P>
<P>I need not draw any farther Parallel between this <HI>Arret</HI> and the <HI>Observations</HI> of our Author. The Reader will easily perceive that <HI>Authority</HI> supplies the want of <HI>Argu∣ment</HI> in Both; and that the <HI>Principles of Liberty</HI> are repre∣sented destructive of <HI>Government</HI> and the <HI>publick Tran∣quility.</HI></P>
<P>The only Passage, in this <HI>empty labour'd Declamation,</HI> which seems to have any Meaning or Design, besides <HI>Flattery</HI> and <HI>Abuse,</HI> is That, where the Author endea∣vours to fix a Contradiction upon the <HI>Craftsman.</HI> He charges Mr. <HI>D' Anvers</HI> with having said <HI>that the Spirit of</HI> Liberty <HI>and the Spirit of</HI> Fiction NEVER <HI>subsist together;</HI> and yet that, in the <HI>Craftsman</HI> of <HI>October the</HI> 3d, it is said, in Relation to the Case of the <HI>Yorkists</HI> and <HI>Lancastrians, though each Side contended to have a King of their own, nei∣ther Party would have a</HI> Tyrant. <HI>They sacrificed their Lives to</HI> Faction, <HI>but would not give up their</HI> Liberties.</P>
<P>Upon which, this <HI>exquisite Reasoner</HI> makes the following Observation.—<HI>This sure demonstrates that the Spirit of</HI> FACTION <HI>did reign, even among these Champions for</HI> LIBER∣TY.—And who, I pray, ever deny'd it?—I am sure the <HI>Craftsman</HI> and his Friend Mr. <HI>Oldcastle,</HI> have of∣ten made this Observation; particularly in the very Pa∣per, from whence our Author hath taken this Passage; it is directly said that <HI>We must not imagine, notwithstand∣ing all the contrary Appearances in this Period, that the Spirit of</HI> Liberty <HI>was absolutely extinguish'd. Though</HI> that Flame <HI>was lost, for the most Part, in the constant Glare of</HI> Faction, <HI>yet it was still alive; and, by living, preserved the Constitution of our Government during the whole Course of these</HI> Civil Wars.</P>
<P>Nay, to expose the Sophistry of this Author still far∣ther; the <HI>Observation,</HI> which He instances, as a Proof of the <HI>Craftsman</HI>'s <HI>Self-contradiction,</HI> is introduc'd in that very Paper, from whence He quotes it, as a memorable EX∣CEPTION to the general Proposition, <HI>that the Spirit of</HI> Liberty <HI>and the Spirit of</HI> Faction <HI>are incompatible and cannot</HI> LONG <HI>subsist together.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>I do not remember any Assertion of the <HI>Craftsman</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a <HI>Spirit of</HI> Liberty <HI>and a Spirit of</HI> Faction NEVER <HI>subsis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> together.</HI> I apprehend, on the Contrary, that the Desig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Argument for keeping up the <HI>Spirit of Liberty</HI> is to defeat the Ends of a <HI>Spirit of Faction.</HI></P>

<P>To treat this Subject in a familiar Light; I take <HI>Fac∣tion,</HI> to be a well-looking, rantipole Strumpet; who hap∣pening to resemble <HI>Liberty,</HI> in some Features, takes upon her to personate the virtuous Lady; as some Gentlewo∣men of the Town have done Maids of Honour. She affects her Dress, Mein and Voice; often frequents the same Walks, and sometimes gets into the same Company which is a plain Sign that the fair <HI>Lady,</HI> whom she repre∣sents, must be very amiable Herself; but though the Jade may draw in a <HI>Cully now and then,</HI> there is no In∣stance of her having ever impos'd on the <HI>whole Town.</HI></P>
<P>To sum up the <HI>Author</HI>'s whole Evidence, it appears that this same <HI>Craftsman,</HI> not having the Fear of God before his Eyes, hath wickedly plotted the Destruction of the <HI>Minister;</HI> and, proceeding in a Course of <HI>guarde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Treasons,</HI> is guilty of <HI>legal Conspiracy</HI> against the present Government, by preaching up the <HI>Principles of the Revo∣lution,</HI> and putting the People in mind of their ancient <HI>hereditary Liberties;</HI> that He hath for these four Years past, carried on an hellish Design of excluding the pre∣sent <HI>Royal Family,</HI> by constantly asserting their Right; and of introducing <HI>Popery</HI> and the <HI>Pretender,</HI> by <HI>continual∣ly delaring against them.</HI> In short, that He is a <HI>Republican</HI> Advocate for the <HI>present Constitution;</HI> a <HI>Popish Whig;</HI> an <HI>Hanoverian Jacobite;</HI> and in all Probability, the secret Director of the <HI>Incendiaries</HI> at <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>What can be done with such a mischievous and des∣perate Fellow:—He is so much <HI>inur'd to the Danger of</HI> HANGING, that to be sure He does not value an Halter a Straw; and our <HI>Laws</HI> are so strait-lac'd, that They will not allow us to deal with Him, as his <HI>seditious Brethren</HI> have been dealt with in <HI>Frnace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>But as all extraordinary Cases require extraoadinary Methods of Proceeding, I wonder our <HI>Author</HI> did not propose that all the Books, Pamphlets and Papers, which this <HI>wicked Incendiary</HI> hath dispers'd, should be carry'd to the <HI>Secretary of State's Office,</HI> to be torn in Pieces; that <HI>Richard Franklin,</HI> the Printer, shall be oblig'd to produce the <HI>written Copies,</HI> (if He hath not already burnt them;) and that <HI>Caleb D' Anvers</HI> shall, within the Space of one Month, sign a formal Retractation of all his pernicious Tenets; and submit Himself to the <HI>new Constitution</HI> of <HI>this Author</HI> and his <HI>Patron; That</HI> (as Duke <HI>Trincalo</HI> says) <HI>the Government may be suffer'd to drink in Quiet.</HI></P>
