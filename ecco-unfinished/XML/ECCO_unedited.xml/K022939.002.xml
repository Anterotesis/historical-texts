<HEAD>SAPPHO TO PHAON.</HEAD>

<L>SAY, lovely youth, that do'st my heart command,</L>
<L>Can Phaon's eyes forget his Sappho's hand?</L>
<L>Must then her name the wretched writer prove,</L>
<L>To thy remembrance lost, as to thy love?</L>
<L N="5">Ask not the cause that I new numbers chuse,</L>
<L>The Lute neglected, and the Lyric muse;</L>
<L>Love taught my tears in sadder notes to flow,</L>
<L>And tun'd my heart to Elegies of woe.</L>
<L>I burn, I burn, as when thro' ripen'd corn</L>
<L N="10">By driving winds the spreading flames are born!</L>
<L>Phaon to Aetna's scorching fields retires,</L>
<L>While I consume with more than Aetna's fires!</L>
<L>No more my soul a charm in music finds,</L>
<L>Music has charms alone for peaceful minds.</L>

<L>The Muses teach me all their softest lays,</L>
<L>And the wide world resounds with Sappho's praise,</L>
<L>Tho' great Alcaeus more sublimely sings,</L>
<L>And strikes with bolder rage the sounding strings,</L>
<L N="36">No less renown attends the moving lyre,</L>

<L>My music, then, you could for ever hear,</L>

<L>And found my kisses sweeter than my song.</L>
<L>In all I pleas'd, but most in what was best;</L>
<L>And the last joy was dearer than the rest.</L>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>ABELARD and Eloisa flourished in the twelfth Century; they were two of the most distin∣guished persons of their age in learning and beauty, but for nothing more famous than for their unfor∣tunate passion. After a long course of calamities, they retired each to a several Convent, and conse∣crated the remainder of their days to religion. It was many years after this separation, that a letter of Abe∣lard's to a Friend, which contained the history of his misfortune, fell into the hands of Eloisa. This awakening all her tenderness, occasioned those cele∣brated letters (out of which the following is partly extracted) which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature, virtue and passion. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

<P>THE following Translations were selected from many others done by the Author in his Youth; for the most part indeed but a sort of <HI>Exercises,</HI> while he was improving himself in the Languages, and car∣ried by his early Bent to <HI>Poetry</HI> to perform them rather in Verse than Prose. Mr. <HI>Dryden's Fables</HI> came out about that time, which occasioned the Translations from <HI>Chaucer.</HI> They were first separately printed in Miscellanies by J. Tonson and B. Lintot, and after∣wards collected in the Quarto Edition of 1717. The <HI>Imitations of English Authors,</HI> which are added at the end, were done as early, some of them at fourteen or fifteen years old; but having also got into Miscel∣lanies, we have put them here together to complete this Juvenile Volume. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>THE TEMPLE OF FAME.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN that soft season, when descending show'rs</L>
<L>Call forth the greens, and wake the rising flow'rs;</L>
<L>When op'ning buds salute the welcome day,</L>
<L>And earth relenting feels the genial ray;</L>
<L N="5">As balmy sleep had charm'd my cares to rest,</L>
<L>And love itself was banish'd from my breast,</L>
<L>(What time the morn mysterious visions brings,</L>
<L>While purer slumbers spread their golden wings)</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="55"/>
A train of phantoms in wild order rose,</L>
<L N="10">And, join'd, this intellectual scene compose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I stood, methought, betwixt earth, seas, and skies;</L>
<L>The whole creation open to my eyes:</L>
<L>In air self-balanc'd hung the globe below,</L>
<L>Where mountains rise and circling oceans flow;</L>
<L N="15">Here naked rocks, and empty wastes were seen,</L>
<L>There tow'ry cities, and the forests green:</L>
<L>Here sailing ships delight the wand'ring eyes:</L>
<L>There trees, and intermingled temples rise;</L>
<L>Now a clear sun the shining scene displays,</L>
<L N="20">The transient landscape now in clouds decays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er the wide Prospect as I gaz'd around,</L>
<L>Sudden I heard a wild promiscuous sound,</L>
<L>Like broken thunders that at distance roar,</L>
<L>Or billows murm'ring on the hollow shore:</L>
<L N="25">Then gazing up, a glorious pile beheld,</L>
<L>Whose tow'ring summit ambient clouds conceal'd.</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="56"/>
High on a rock of Ice the structure lay,</L>
<L>Steep its ascent, and slipp'ry was the way;</L>
<L>The wond'rous rock like Parian marble shone,</L>
<L N="30">And seem'd, to distant sight, of solid stone.</L>
<L>Inscriptions here of various Names I view'd,</L>
<L>The greater part by hostile time subdu'd;</L>
<L>Yet wide was spread their fame in ages past,</L>
<L>And Poets once had promis'd they should last.</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="57"/>
Some fresh engrav'd appear'd of Wits renown'd;</L>
<L N="36">I look'd again, nor could their trace be found.</L>
<L>Critics I saw, that other names deface,</L>
<L>And fix their own, with labour, in their place:</L>
<L>Their own, like others, soon their place resign'd,</L>
<L N="40">Or disappear'd, and left the first behind.</L>
<L>Nor was the work impair'd by storms alone,</L>
<L>But felt th'approaches of too warm a sun;</L>
<L>For Fame, impatient of extremes, decays</L>
<L>Not more by Envy than excess of Praise.</L>
<L N="45">Yet part no injuries of heav'n could feel,</L>
<L>Like crystal faithful to the graving steel:</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="58"/>
The rock's high summit, in the temple's shade,</L>
<L>Nor heat could melt, nor beating storm invade.</L>
<L>Their names inscrib'd unnumber'd ages past</L>
<L N="50">From time's first birth, with time itself shall last;</L>
<L>These ever new, nor subject to decays,</L>
<L>Spread, and grow brighter with the length of days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So Zembla's rocks (the beauteous work of frost)</L>
<L>Rise white in air, and glitter o'er the coast;</L>
<L N="55">Pale suns, unfelt, at distance roll away,</L>
<L>And on th'impassive ice the light'nings play;</L>
<L>Eternal snows the growing mass supply,</L>
<L>Till the bright mountains prop th'incumbent sky:</L>
<L>As Atlas fix'd, each hoary pile appears,</L>
<L N="60">The gather'd winter of a thousand years.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On this foundation Fame's high temple stands;</L>
<L>Stupendous pile! not rear'd by mortal hands.</L>
<L>Whate'er proud Rome or artful Greece beheld,</L>
<L>Or elder Babylon, its frame excell'd.</L>
<L N="65">Four faces had the dome, and ev'ry face</L>
<L>Of various structure, but of equal grace:</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="59"/>
Four brazen gates, on columns lifted high,</L>
<L>Salute the diff'rent quarters of the sky.</L>
<L>Here fabled Chiefs in darker ages born,</L>
<L N="70">Or Worthies old, whom arms or arts adorn,</L>
<L>Who cities rais'd, or tam'd a monstrous race;</L>
<L>The walls in venerable order grace:</L>
<L>Heroes in animated marble frown,</L>
<L>And Legislators seem to think in stone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="75">Westward, a sumptuous frontispiece appear'd,</L>
<L>On Doric pillars of white marble rear'd,</L>
<L>Crown'd with an architrave of antique mold,</L>
<L>And sculpture rising on the roughen'd gold.</L>
<L>In shaggy spoils here Theseus was beheld,</L>
<L N="80">And Perseus dreadful with Minerva's shield:</L>
<L>There great Alcides stooping with his toil,</L>
<L>Rests on his club, and holds th' Hesperian spoil.</L>
<L>Here Orpheus sings; trees moving to the sound</L>
<L>Start from their roots, and form a shade around:</L>
<L N="85">Amphion there the loud creating lyre</L>
<L>Strikes, and behold<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a sudden Thebes aspire!</L>

Cythaeron's echoes answer to his call,</L>
<L>And half the mountain rolls into a wall:</L>
<L>There might you see the length'ning spires ascend,</L>
<L N="90">The domes swell up, the wid'ning arches bend,</L>
<L>The growing tow'rs, like exhalations rise,</L>
<L>And the huge columns heave into the skies.</L>

<L>The Eastern front was glorious to behold,</L>
<L>With di'mond flaming, and Barbaric gold.</L>
<L N="95">There Ninus shone, who spread th' Assyrian fame,</L>
<L>And the great founder of the Persian name:</L>
<L>There in long robes the royal Magi stand,</L>
<L>Grave Zoroaster waves the circling wand,</L>
<L>The sage Chaldaeans rob'd in white appear'd,</L>
<L N="100">And Brachmans, deep in desert woods rever'd.</L>
<L>These stop'd the moon, and call'd th'unbody'd shades</L>
<L>To midnight banquets in the glimm'ring glades;</L>
<L>Made visionary fabricks round them rise,</L>
<L>And airy spectres skim before their eyes;</L>

Of Talismans and Sigils knew the pow'r,</L>

<L N="110">Of Aegypt's Priests the gilded niches grace,</L>

<L>Whom scepter'd slaves in golden harness drew:</L>
<L N="115">His hands a bow and pointed javelin hold;</L>
<L>His giant limbs are arm'd in scales of gold.</L>
<L>Between the statues Obelisks were plac'd,</L>

<LG>
<L>Of Gothic structure was the Northern side,</L>
<L N="120">O'erwrought with ornaments of barb'rous pride.</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="62"/>
There huge Colosses rose, with trophies crown'd,</L>
<L>And Runic characters were grav'd around.</L>
<L>There sate Zamolxis with erected eyes,</L>
<L>And Odin here in mimic trances dies.</L>
<L>There on rude iron columns, smear'd with blood,</L>
<L N="126">The horrid forms of Scythian heroes stood,</L>
<L>Druids and Bards (their once loud harps unstrung)</L>
<L>And youths that dy'd to be by Poets sung.</L>
<L>These and a thousand more of doubtful fame,</L>
<L N="130">To whom old fables gave a lasting name,</L>
<L>In ranks adorn'd the Temple's outward face;</L>
<L>The wall in lustre and effect like Glass,</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="63"/>
Which o'er each object casting various dyes,</L>
<L>Enlarges some, and others multiplies:</L>
<L N="135">Nor void of emblem was the mystic wall,</L>
<L>For thus romantic Fame increases all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Temple shakes, the sounding gates unfold,</L>
<L>Wide vaults appear, and roofs of fretted gold:</L>
<L>Rais'd on a thousand pillars, wreath'd around</L>
<L N="140">With laurel-foliage, and with eagles crown'd:</L>
<L>Of bright, transparent beryl were the walls,</L>
<L>The freezes gold, and gold the capitals:</L>
<L>As heav'n with stars, the roof with jewels glows,</L>
<L>And ever-living lamps depend in rows.</L>
<L N="145">Full in the passage of each spacious gate,</L>
<L>The sage Historians in white garments wait;</L>
<L>Grav'd o'er their seats the form of Time was found,</L>
<L>His scythe revers'd, and both his pinions bound.</L>
<L>Within stood Heroes, who thro' loud alarms</L>
<L N="150">In bloody fields pursu'd renown in arms.</L>
<L>High on a throne with trophies charg'd, I view'd</L>
<L>The Youth that all things but himself subdu'd;</L>

His feet on sceptres and tiara's trod,</L>

<L>Caesar, the world's great master, and his own;</L>

<L>Here ever shines the godlike Socrates:</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="65"/>
He whom ungrateful Athens could expell,</L>
<L>At all times just, but when he sign'd the Shell:</L>
<L>Here his abode the martyr'd Phocion claims,</L>
<L N="175">With Agis, not the last of Spartan names:</L>
<L>Unconquer'd Cato shews the wound he tore,</L>
<L>And Brutus his ill Genius meets no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But in the centre of the hallow'd choir,</L>
<L>Six pompous columns o'er the rest aspire;</L>
<L N="180"><PB N="63" REF="66"/>
Around the shrine itself of Fame they stand,</L>
<L>Hold the chief honours, and the fane command.</L>
<L>High on the first, the mighty Homer shone;</L>
<L>Eternal Adamant compos'd his throne;</L>
<L>Father of verse! in holy fillets drest,</L>
<L N="185">His silver beard wav'd gently o'er his breast;</L>
<L>Tho' blind, a boldness in his looks appears;</L>
<L>In years he seem'd, but not impair'd by years.</L>
<L>The wars of Troy were round the Pillar seen:</L>
<L>Here fierce Tydides wounds the Cyprian Queen;</L>
<L N="190">Here Hector glorious from Patroclus' fall,</L>
<L>Here dragg'd in triumph round the Trojan wall,</L>
<L>Motion and life did ev'ry part inspire,</L>
<L>Bold was the work, and prov'd the master's fire;</L>
<L>A strong expression most he seem'd t'affect,</L>
<L N="195">And here and there disclos'd a brave neglect.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A golden column next in rank appear'd,</L>
<L>On which a shrine of purest gold was rear'd;</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="67"/>
Finish'd the whole, and labour'd ev'ry part,</L>
<L>With patient touches of unweary'd art:</L>
<L N="200">The Mantuan there in sober triumph sate,</L>
<L>Compos'd his posture, and his look sedate;</L>
<L>On Homer still he fix'd a rev'rend eye,</L>
<L>Great without pride, in modest majesty.</L>
<L>In living sculpture on the sides were spread</L>
<L N="205">The Latian Wars, and haughty Turnus dead;</L>
<L>Eliza stretch'd upon the fun'ral pyre,</L>
<L>Aeneas bending with his aged sire:</L>
<L>Troy flam'd in burning gold, and o'er the throne</L>
<L>ARMS AND THE MAN in golden cyphers shone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="210">Four swans sustain a car of silver bright,</L>
<L>With heads advanc'd, and pinions stretch'd for flight:</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="68"/>
Here, like some furious prophet, Pindar rode,</L>
<L>And seem'd to labour with th'inspiring God.</L>
<L>Across the harp a careless hand he flings,</L>
<L N="215">And boldly sinks into the sounding strings.</L>
<L>The figur'd games of Greece the column grace,</L>
<L>Neptune and Jove survey the rapid race.</L>
<L>The youths hang o'er their chariots as they run;</L>
<L>The fiery steeds seem starting from the stone;</L>
<L N="220">The champions in distorted postures threat;</L>
<L>And all appear'd irregularly great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here happy Horace tun'd th'Ausonian lyre</L>
<L>To sweeter sounds, and temper'd Pindar's fire:</L>
<L>Pleas'd with Alcaeus' manly rage t'infuse</L>
<L N="225">The softer spirit of the Sapphic Muse.</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="69"/>
The polish'd pillar diff'rent sculptures grace;</L>
<L>A work outlasting monumental brass.</L>
<L>Here smiling Loves and Bacchanals appear,</L>
<L>The Julian star, and great Augustus here.</L>
<L N="230">The Doves that round the infant poet spread</L>
<L>Myrtles and bays, hung hov'ring o'er his head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here in a shrine that cast a dazling light,</L>
<L>Sate fix'd in thought the mighty Stagirite;</L>
<L>His sacred head a radiant Zodiac crown'd,</L>
<L N="235">And various Animals his sides surround;</L>
<L>His piercing eyes, erect, appear to view</L>
<L>Superior worlds, and look all Nature through.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
<L>With equal rays immortal Tully shone,</L>
<L>The Roman Rostra deck'd the Consul's throne:</L>
<L N="240">Gath'ring his flowing robe, he seem'd to stand</L>
<L>In act to speak, and graceful stretch'd his hand.</L>
<L>Behind, Rome's Genius waits with Civic crowns,</L>
<L>And the great Father of his country owns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These massy columns in a circle rise,</L>
<L N="245">O'er which a pompous dome invades the skies:</L>
<L>Scarce to the top I stretch'd my aking sight,</L>
<L>So large it spread, and swell'd to such a height.</L>
<L>Full in the midst proud Fame's imperial seat</L>
<L>With jewels blaz'd, magnificently great;</L>
<L N="250">The vivid em'ralds there revive the eye,</L>
<L>The flaming rubies shew their sanguine dye,</L>
<L>Bright azure rays from lively sapphyrs stream,</L>
<L>And lucid amber casts a golden gleam.</L>
<L>With various-colour'd light the pavement shone,</L>
<L N="255">And all on fire appear'd the glowing throne;</L>
<L>The dome's high arch reflects the mingled blaze,</L>
<L>And forms a rainbow of alternate rays.</L>
<L>When on the Goddess first I cast my sight,</L>
<L>Scarce seem'd her stature of a cubit's height;</L>
<L N="260"><PB N="68" REF="71"/>
But swell'd to larger size, the more I gaz'd,</L>
<L>Till to the roof her tow'ring front she rais'd.</L>
<L>With her, the Temple ev'ry moment grew,</L>
<L>And ampler Vista's open'd to my view:</L>
<L>Upward the columns shoot, the roofs ascend,</L>
<L N="265">And arches widen, and long iles extend.</L>
<L>Such was her form as ancient bards have told,</L>
<L>Wings raise her arms, and wings her feet infold;</L>
<L>A thousand busy tongues the Goddess bears,</L>
<L>And thousand open eyes, and thousand list'ning ears.</L>
<L N="270">Beneath, in order rang'd, the tuneful Nine</L>
<L>(Her virgin handmaids) still attend the shrine:</L>
<L>With eyes on Fame for ever fix'd, they sing;</L>
<L>For Fame they raise the voice, and tune the string;</L>
<L>With time's first birth began the heav'nly lays,</L>
<L N="275">And last, eternal, thro' the length of days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
<L>Around these wonders as I cast a look,</L>
<L>The trumpet sounded, and the temple shook,</L>
<L>And all the nations, summon'd at the call,</L>
<L>From diff'rent quarters fill the crouded hall:</L>
<L>Of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard;</L>
<L>In various garbs promiscuous throngs appear'd;</L>
<L>Thick as the bees, that with the spring renew</L>
<L>Their flow'ry toils, and sip the fragrant dew,</L>
<L>When the wing'd colonies first tempt the sky,</L>
<L N="285">O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly,</L>
<L>Or settling, seize the sweets the blossoms yield,</L>
<L>And a low murmur runs along the field.</L>
<L>Millions of suppliant crouds the shrine attend,</L>
<L>And all degrees before the Goddess bend;</L>
<L N="290">The poor, the rich, the valiant, and the sage,</L>
<L>And boasting youth, and narrative old-age.</L>
<L><PB N="70" REF="73"/>
Their pleas were diff'rent, their request the same:</L>
<L>For good and bad alike are fond of Fame.</L>
<L>Some she disgrac'd, and some with honours crown'd;</L>
<L N="295">Unlike successes equal merits found.</L>
<L>Thus her blind sister, sickle Fortune, reigns,</L>
<L>And, undiscerning, scatters crowns and chains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First at the shrine the Learned world appear,</L>
<L>And to the Goddess thus prefer their pray'r.</L>
<L>Long have we sought t'instruct and please mankind,</L>
<L>With studies pale, with midnight vigils blind;</L>
<L>But thank'd by few, rewarded yet by none,</L>
<L>We here appeal to thy superior throne:</L>
<L>On wit and learning the just prize bestow,</L>
<L N="305">For fame is all we must expect below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Goddess heard, and bade the Muses raise</L>
<L>The golden Trumpet of eternal Praise:</L>
<L>From pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound,</L>
<L>That fills the circuit of the world around;</L>
<L N="310">Not all at once, as thunder breaks the cloud;</L>
<L>The notes at first were rather sweet than loud:</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="74"/>
By just degrees they ev'ry moment rise,</L>
<L>Fill the wide earth, and gain upon the skies.</L>
<L>At ev'ry breath were balmy odours shed,</L>
<L N="315">Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread;</L>
<L>Less fragrant scents th'unfolding rose exhales,</L>
<L>Or spices breathing in Arabian gales.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next these the good and just, an awful train,</L>
<L>Thus on their knees address the sacred fane.</L>
<L N="320">Since living virtue is with envy curs'd,</L>
<L>And the best men are treated like the worst,</L>
<L>Do thou, just Goddess, call our merits forth,</L>
<L>And give each deed th'exact intrinsic worth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
<L>Not with bare justice shall your act be crown'd</L>
<L N="325">(Said Fame) but high above desert renown'd:</L>
<L>Let fuller notes th'applauding world amaze,</L>
<L>And the loud clarion labour in your praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This band dismiss'd, behold another croud</L>
<L>Prefer'd the same request, and lowly bow'd;</L>
<L N="330">The constant tenour of whose well-spent days</L>
<L>'No less deserv'd a just return of praise.</L>
<L>But strait the direful Trump of Slander sounds;</L>
<L>Thro' the big dome the doubling thunder bounds;</L>
<L>Loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies,</L>
<L N="335">The dire report thro' ev'ry region flies,</L>
<L>In ev'ry ear incessant rumours rung,</L>
<L>And gath'ring scandals grew on ev'ry tongue.</L>
<L>From the black trumpet's rusty concave broke</L>
<L>Sulphureous flames, and clouds of rolling smoke:</L>
<L N="340"><PB N="73" REF="76"/>
The pois'nous vapour blots the purple skies,</L>
<L>And withers all before it as it flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A troop came next, who crowns and armour wore,</L>
<L>And proud defiance in their looks they bore:</L>
<L>For thee (they cry'd) amidst alarms and strife,</L>
<L N="345">We sail'd in tempests down the stream of life;</L>
<L>For thee whole nations fill'd with flames and blood,</L>
<L>And swam to empire thro' the purple flood.</L>
<L>Those ills we dar'd, thy inspiration own,</L>
<L>What virtue seem'd, was done for thee alone.</L>
<L>Ambitious fools! (the Queen reply'd, and frown'd)</L>
<L>Be all your acts in dark oblivion drown'd;</L>
<L>There sleep forgot, with mighty tyrants gone,</L>
<L>Your statues moulder'd, and your names unknown!</L>
<L>A sudden cloud straight snatch'd them from my sight,</L>
<L N="355">And each majestic phantom sunk in night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then came the smallest tribe I yet had seen;</L>
<L>Plain was their dress, and modest was their mien.</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="77"/>
Great idol of mankind! we neither claim</L>
<L>The praise of merit, nor aspire to fame!</L>
<L N="360">But safe in deserts from th'applause of men,</L>
<L>Would die unheard of, as we liv'd unseen,</L>
<L>'Tis all we beg thee, to conceal from sight</L>
<L>Those acts of goodness, which themselves requite.</L>
<L>O let us still the secret joy partake,</L>
<L N="365">To follow virtue ev'n for virtue's sake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And live there men, who slight immortal fame?</L>
<L>Who then with incense shall adore our name?</L>
<L>But mortals! know, 'tis still our greatest pride</L>
<L>To blaze those virtues, which the good would hide.</L>
<L N="370"><PB N="75" REF="78"/>
Rise! Muses, rise! add all your tuneful breath,</L>
<L>These must not sleep in darkness and in death.</L>
<L>She said: in air the trembling music floats,</L>
<L>And on the winds triumphant swell the notes;</L>
<L>So soft, tho' high, so loud, and yet so clear,</L>
<L N="375">Ev'n list'ning Angels lean'd from heav'n to hear:</L>
<L>To farthest shores th' Ambrosial spirit flies,</L>
<L>Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies.</L>

<L>Next these a youthful train their vows express'd,</L>
<L>With feathers crown'd, with gay embroid'ry dress'd:</L>
<L N="380">Hither, they cry'd, direct your eyes, and see</L>
<L>The men of pleasure, dress, and gallantry;</L>
<L>Ours is the place at banquets, balls, and plays,</L>
<L>Sprightly our nights, polite are all our days;</L>
<L>Courts we frequent, where 'tis our pleasing care</L>
<L N="385">To pay due visits, and address the fair:</L>
<L>In fact, 'tis true, no nymph we could persuade,</L>
<L>But still in fancy vanquish'd ev'ry maid;</L>
<L>Of unknown Duchesses leud tales we tell,</L>
<L>Yet, would the world believe us, all were well.</L>

<L>The Queen assents, the trumpet rends the skies,</L>
<L>And at each blast a Lady's honour dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pleas'd with the strange success, vast numbers prest</L>
<L>Around the shrine, and made the same request:</L>
<L>What you (she cry'd) unlearn'd in arts to please,</L>
<L>Slaves to yourselves, and ev'n fatigu'd with ease,</L>
<L>Who lose a length of undeserving days,</L>
<L>Would you usurp the lover's dear-bought praise?</L>
<L N="400">To just contempt, ye vain pretenders, fall,</L>

<L>Straight the black clarion sends a horrid sound,</L>
<L>Loud laughs burst out, and bitter scoffs fly round,</L>
<L>Whispers are heard, with taunts reviling loud,</L>
<L N="405">And scornful hisses run thro' all the croud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Last, those who boast of mighty mischiefs done,</L>
<L>Enslave their country, or usurp a throne;</L>
<L>Or who their glory's dire foundation lay'd</L>
<L>On Sov'reigns ruin'd, or on friends betray'd;</L>
<L>Calm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix,</L>
<L>Of crooked counsels and dark politics;</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="80"/>
Of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne,</L>
<L>And beg to make th'immortal treasons known.</L>
<L N="415">The trumpet roars, long flaky flames expire,</L>
<L>With sparks, that seem'd to set the world on fire.</L>
<L>At the dread sound, pale mortals stood aghast,</L>
<L>And startled nature trembled with the blast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This having heard and seen, some pow'r unknown</L>
<L>Strait chang'd the scene, and snatch'd me from the throne.</L>
<L N="420"><PB N="78" REF="81"/>
Before my view appear'd a structure fair,</L>
<L>Its site uncertain, if in earth or air;</L>
<L>With rapid motion turn'd the mansion round;</L>
<L>With ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound;</L>
<L>Not less in number were the spacious doors,</L>
<L N="425">Than leaves on trees, or sands upon the shores;</L>
<L>Which still unfolded stand, by night, by day,</L>
<L>Pervious to winds, and open ev'ry way.</L>
<L>As flames by nature to the skies ascend,</L>
<L>As weighty bodies to the centre tend,</L>
<L N="430">As to the sea returning rivers roll,</L>
<L>And the touch'd needle trembles to the pole;</L>
<L>Hither, as to their proper place, arise</L>
<L>All various sounds from earth, and seas, and skies,</L>
<L>Or spoke aloud, or whisper'd in the ear;</L>
<L N="435">Nor ever silence, rest, or peace is here.</L>
<L>As on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes</L>
<L>The sinking stone at first a circle makes;</L>

<L N="440">Wide, and more wide, the floating rings advance,</L>
<L>Fill all the wat'ry plain, and to the margin dance:</L>

Thus ev'ry voice and sound, when first they break,</L>
<L>On neighb'ring air a soft impression make;</L>
<L>Another ambient circle then they move;</L>
<L N="445">That, in its turn, impels the next above;</L>
<L>Thro' undulating air the sounds are sent,</L>
<L>And spread o'er all the fluid element.</L>

<L N="450">Of loss and gain, of famine and of store,</L>
<L>Of storms at sea, and travels on the shore,</L>
<L>Of prodigies, and portents seen in air,</L>
<L>Of fires and plagues, and stars with blazing hair,</L>
<L>Of turns of fortune, changes in the state,</L>

Ease, health, and life, for this they must resign,</L>

From these, Petrarch and Chaucer frequently borrow the idea of their poems. See the <HI>Trionfi</HI> of the former▪ and the <HI>Dream, Flower and the Leaf,</HI> etc. of the latter.

The Magi and Chaldaeans (the chief of whom was Zoroaster) employed their studies upon magic and astrology, which was in a manner almost all the learning of the ancient Asian people.

VER. 110. <HI>Aegypt's priests etc.]</HI> The learning of the old Aegyptian Priests consisted for the most part in geometry and astronomy: they also preserved the History of their nation. Their greatest Hero upon record is Sesostris, whose actions and conquests may be seen at large in Diodorus, etc. He is said to have caused the Kings he vanquished to draw him in his Chariot.

of the northern nations lay more obscure than that of the rest; Zamolxis was the disciple of Pythagoras, who taught the immortality of the soul to the Scythians.

<L>THERE liv'd in Lombardy, as authors write,</L>
<L>In days of old, a wise and worthy knight;</L>
<L>Of gentle manners, as of gen'rous race,</L>
<L>Blest with much sense, more riches, and some grace▪</L>
<L N="5">Yet led astray by Venus' sost delights,</L>

<L>Whether pure holiness inspir'd his mind,</L>

<L>But his high courage prick'd him forth to wed,</L>

<L N="15"><PB N="88" REF="90"/>
This was his nightly dream, his daily care,</L>
<L>And to the heav'nly pow'rs his constant pray'r,</L>
<L>Once, ere he dy'd, to taste the blissful life</L>
<L>Of a kind husband and a loving wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These thoughts he fortify'd with reasons still,</L>
<L N="20">(For none want reasons to confirm their will.)</L>
<L>Grave authors say, and witty poets sing,</L>
<L>That honest wedlock is a glorious thing:</L>
<L>But depth of judgment most in him appears,</L>
<L>Who wisely weds in his maturer years.</L>

<L>To hope the future, or esteem the past:</L>
<L N="35">But vainly boast the joys they never try'd,</L>
<L>And find divulg'd the secrets they would hide.</L>
<L>The marry'd man may bear his yoke with ease,</L>

<L><PB N="89" REF="91"/>
And pass his inoffensive hours away,</L>
<L N="40">In bliss all night, and innocence all day:</L>
<L>Tho' fortune change, his constant spouse remains,</L>
<L>Augments his joys, or mitigates his pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what so pure, which envious tongues will spare?</L>
<L>Some wicked wits have libell'd all the fair.</L>
<L N="45">With matchless impudence they style a wife</L>
<L>The dear-bought curse, and lawful plague of life;</L>
<L>A bosom-serpent, a domestic evil,</L>
<L>A night-invasion, and a mid-day-devil.</L>
<L>Let not the wise these sland'rous words regard,</L>
<L N="50">But curse the bones of ev'ry lying bard.</L>
<L>All other goods by fortune's hand are giv'n,</L>
<L>A wife is the peculiar gift of heav'n.</L>
<L>Vain fortune's favours, never at a stay,</L>
<L>Like empty shadows, pass, and glide away;</L>

Beneath the weight of threescore years I bend,</L>
<L>And, worn with cares, am hast'ning to my end;</L>
<L>How I have liv'd, alas! you know too well,</L>
<L N="90">In worldly follies, which I blush to tell;</L>
<L>But gracious heav'n has ope'd my eyes at last,</L>
<L>With due regret I view my vices past,</L>

<L>Will take a wife, and live in holy ease.</L>
<L N="95">But since by counsel all things should be done,</L>
<L>And many heads are wiser still than one;</L>
<L>Chuse you for me, who best shall be content</L>
<L>When my desire's approv'd by your consent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One caution yet is needful to be told,</L>
<L>To guide your choice; this wife must not be old:</L>
<L N="101">There goes a saying, and 'twas shrewdly said,</L>
<L>Old fish at table, but young flesh in bed.</L>
<L>My soul abhors the tasteless, dry embrace</L>
<L>Of a stale virgin with a winter face:</L>
<L N="105">In that cold season Love but treats his guest</L>
<L>With bean-straw, and tough forage at the best.</L>
<L>No crafty widows shall approach my bed;</L>
<L>Those are too wise for batchelors to wed;</L>
<L N="109">As subtle clerks by many schools are made,</L>

But young and tender virgins, rul'd with ease,</L>
<L>We form like wax, and mold them as we please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Conceive me, Sirs, nor take my sense amiss;</L>
<L>'Tis what concerns my soul's eternal bliss;</L>
<L N="115">Since if I found no pleasure in my spouse,</L>
<L>As flesh is frail, and who (God help me) knows?</L>
<L>Then should I live in leud adultery,</L>
<L>And sink downright to Satan when I die.</L>
<L>Or were I curs'd with an unfruitful bed,</L>
<L>The righteous end were lost, for which I wed;</L>
<L N="121">To raise up seed to bless the pow'rs above,</L>
<L>And not for pleasure only, or for love.</L>
<L>Think not I doat; 'tis time to take a wife,</L>
<L>When vig'rous blood forbids a chaster life:</L>
<L N="125">Those that are blest with store of grace divine,</L>
<L>May live like saints, by heav'n's consent, and mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And since I speak of wedlock, let me say,</L>
<L>(As, thank my stars, in modest truth I may)</L>
<L>My limbs are active, still I'm sound at heart,</L>
<L N="130">And a new vigour springs in ev'ry part.</L>
<L>Think not my virtue lost, tho' time has shed</L>
<L>These rev'rend honours on my hoary head;</L>

<L>Such prudence, Sir, in all your words appears,</L>

<L>Let him not dare to vent his dang'rous thought,</L>
<L N="165">A noble fool was never in a fault.</L>
<L>This, Sir, affects not you, whose ev'ry word</L>
<L>Is weigh'd with judgment, and befits a Lord:</L>
<L>Your will is mine; and is (I will maintain)</L>
<L>Pleasing to God, and should be so to Man;</L>
<L>At least, your courage all the world must praise,</L>
<L N="171">Who dare to wed in your declining days.</L>
<L>Indulge the vigour of your mounting blood,</L>
<L>And let grey fools be indolently good,</L>
<L>Who, past all pleasure, damn the joys of sense,</L>

The venture's greater, I'll presume to say,</L>
<L>To give your person, than your goods away:</L>
<L>And therefore, Sir, as you regard your rest,</L>
<L N="185">First learn your Lady's qualities at least:</L>

<L>Meek as a saint, or haughty as the devil;</L>

<L N="190">'Tis true, perfection none must hope to find</L>
<L>In all this world, much less in woman-kind;</L>

<L>Ah, gentle Sir, take warning of a friend,</L>
<L>Who knows too well the state you thus commend;</L>
<L N="196">And spight of all his praises must declare,</L>
<L>All he can find is bondage, cost, and care.</L>
<L>Heav'n knows, I shed full many a private tear,</L>

<L N="200">While all my friends applaud my blissful life,</L>
<L>And swear no mortal's happier in a wife;</L>

<L>But, by th' immortal pow'rs, I feel the pain,</L>

Do what you list, for me; you must be sage,</L>

<L>Would busy the most vig'rous of us all.</L>
<L>And trust me, Sir, the chastest you can chuse</L>
<L>Will ask observance, and exact her dues.</L>
<L>If what I speak my noble Lord offend,</L>
<L N="215">My tedious sermon here is at an end.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis well, 'tis wondrous well, the Knight replies,</L>
<L>Most worthy kinsman, faith you're mighty wife!</L>
<L>We, Sirs, are fools; and must resign the cause</L>
<L>To heath'nish authors, proverbs, and old saws.</L>
<L>He spoke with scorn, and turn'd another way:—</L>
<L>What does my friend, my dear Placebo say?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I say, quoth he, by heav'n the man's to blame,</L>
<L>To slander wives, and wedlock's holy name.</L>
<L>At this the council rose, without delay;</L>
<L N="225">Each, in his own opinion, went his way;</L>
<L>With full consent, that, all disputes appeas'd,</L>
<L>The knight should marry, when and where he pleas'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who now but January exults with joy?</L>
<L>The charms of wedlock all his soul employ:</L>

Each nymph by turns his wav'ring mind possest,</L>
<L>And reign'd the short-liv'd tyrant of his breast;</L>
<L>While fancy pictur'd ev'ry lively part,</L>

<L>Thus, in some publick Forum fix'd on high,</L>
<L N="235">A Mirrour shows the figures moving by;</L>
<L>Still one by one, in swift succession, pass</L>
<L>The gliding shadows o'er the polish'd glass.</L>
<L>This Lady's charms the nicest could not blame,</L>
<L N="239">But vile suspicions had aspers'd her fame;</L>
<L>That was with sense, but not with virtue, blest;</L>
<L>And one had grace, that wanted all the rest.</L>
<L>Thus doubting long what nymph he should obey,</L>
<L>He fix'd at last upon the youthful May.</L>
<L>Her faults he knew not, Love is always blind,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Much in his prudence did our Knight rejoice,</L>
<L>And thought no mortal could dispute his choice:</L>

<L>And told them all, their pains were at an end.</L>
<L><PB N="98" REF="100"/>
Heav'n, that (said he) inspir'd me first to wed,</L>

<LG>
<L>A dame there is, the darling of my eyes,</L>

<L>Her will I wed, if gracious heav'n so please;</L>
<L>To pass my age in sanctity and ease:</L>

<L N="266">If you, my friends, this virgin can procure,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>One only doubt remains: Full oft I've heard,</L>
<L>By casuists grave, and deep divines averr'd;</L>
<L N="270">That 'tis too much for human race to know</L>
<L>The bliss of heav'n above, and earth below.</L>
<L>Now should the nuptial pleasures prove so great,</L>

<L>Those endless joys were ill exchang'd for these;</L>
<L>Then clear this doubt, and set my mind at ease.</L>

Sir Knight, he cry'd, if this be all you dread,</L>

<L>Good heav'n, no doubt, the nuptial state approves,</L>

<LG>
<L>Then be not, Sir, abandon'd to despair;</L>
<L N="285">Seek, and perhaps you'll find among the fair,</L>

<L>Provided still, you moderate your joy,</L>

<L>Their pigmy king, and little fairy queen,</L>
<L>In circling dances gambol▪d on the green,</L>
<L>While tuneful sprites a merry concert made,</L>
<L>And airy music warbled thro' the shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="465">Hither the noble knight would oft repair,</L>
<L>(His scene of pleasure, and peculiar care)</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="109"/>
For this he held it dear, and always bore</L>
<L>The silver key that lock'd the garden door.</L>
<L>To this sweet place in summer's sultry heat,</L>

<L><HI>Solus cum sola,</HI> with his sprightly May.</L>
<L>For whate'er work was undischarg'd a-bed,</L>
<L>The duteous knight in this fair garden sped.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="475">But ah! what mortal lives of bliss secure,</L>
<L>How short a space our worldly joys endure?</L>
<L>O Fortune, fair, like all thy treach'rous kind,</L>
<L>But faithless still, and wav'ring as the wind!</L>
<L>O painted monster, form'd mankind to cheat,</L>
<L N="480">With pleasing poison, and with soft deceit!</L>
<L>This rich, this am'rous, venerable knight,</L>
<L>Amidst his ease, his solace, and delight,</L>
<L>Struck blind by thee, resigns his days to grief,</L>
<L>And calls on death, the wretch's last relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="485">The rage of jealousy then seiz'd his mind,</L>
<L>For much he fear'd the faith of woman-kind.</L>
<L>His wife not suffer'd from his side to stray,</L>
<L>Was captive kept, he watch'd her night and day,</L>
<L>Abridg'd her pleasures and confin'd her sway.</L>

Full oft in tears did hapless May complain,</L>
<L>And sigh'd full oft; but sigh'd and wept in vain;</L>
<L>She look'd on Damian with a lover's eye;</L>
<L>For oh, 'twas fixt; she must possess or die!</L>
<L>Nor less impatience vex'd her am'rous Squire,</L>
<L N="495">Wild with delay, and burning with desire.</L>
<L>Watch'd as she was, yet could he not refrain,</L>
<L>By secret writing to disclose his pain:</L>
<L>The dame by signs reveal'd her kind intent,</L>
<L>Till both were conscious what each other meant.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="500">Ah, gentle knight, what would thy eyes avail,</L>
<L>Tho' they could see as far as ships can sail?</L>
<L>'Tis better, sure, when blind, deceiv'd to be,</L>
<L>Than be deluded when a man can see!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Argus himself, so cautious and so wise,</L>
<L N="505">Was over-watch'd, for all his hundred eyes:</L>
<L>So many an honest husband may, 'tis known,</L>

<L>Well sung sweet Ovid, in the days of yore,</L>

<L>And Pyramus and Thisbe plainly show</L>
<L>The feats true lovers, when they list, can do:</L>
<L>Tho' watch'd and captive, yet in spite of all,</L>
<L>They found the art of kissing thro' a wall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="520">But now no longer from our tale to stray;</L>
<L>It happ'd, that once upon a summer's day,</L>
<L>Our rev'rend Knight was urg'd to am'rous play:</L>
<L>He rais'd his spouse e'er Matin-bell was rung,</L>
<L>And thus his morning canticle he sung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="525">Awake, my love, disclose thy radiant eyes;</L>
<L>Arise, my wife, my beauteous lady, rise!</L>
<L>Hear how the doves with pensive notes complain,</L>

<L>And ambush'd close behind an arbour lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It was not long ere January came,</L>
<L N="540">And hand in hand with him his lovely dame;</L>
<L>Blind as he was, not doubting all was sure,</L>
<L>He turn'd the key, and made the gate secure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here let us walk, he said, observ'd by none,</L>
<L>Conscious of pleasures to the world unknown:</L>
<L N="545">So may my soul have joy, as thou, my wife,</L>
<L>Art far the dearest solace of my life;</L>
<L>And rather would I chuse, by heav'n above,</L>
<L>To die this instant, than to lose thy love.</L>
<L>Reflect what truth was in my passion shewn,</L>
<L N="550">When unendow'd, I took thee for my own,</L>
<L>And sought no treasure but thy heart alone.</L>
<L>Old as I am, and now depriv'd of sight,</L>
<L>Whilst thou art faithful to thy own true Knight,</L>
<L>Nor age, nor blindness rob me of delight.</L>
<L N="555">Each other loss with patience I can bear,</L>
<L>The loss of thee is what I only fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Consider then, my lady and my wife,</L>
<L>The solid comforts of a virtuous life.</L>
<L>As first, the love of Christ himself you gain;</L>
<L N="560">Next, your own honour undefil'd maintain;</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="113"/>
And lastly, that which sure your mind must move,</L>
<L>My whole estate shall gratify your love:</L>
<L>Make your own terms, and ere to-morrow's sun</L>
<L>Displays his light, by heav'n it shall be done.</L>
<L N="565">I seal the contract with a holy kiss,</L>
<L>And will perform, by this—my dear, and this—</L>
<L>Have comfort, spouse, nor think thy Lord unkind;</L>
<L>'Tis love, not jealousy that fires my mind.</L>
<L>For when thy charms my sober thoughts engage,</L>
<L N="570">And join'd to them my own unequal age,</L>
<L>From thy dear side I have no pow'r to part,</L>
<L>Such secret transports warm my melting heart.</L>
<L>For who that once possest those heav'nly charms,</L>
<L>Could live one moment absent from thy arms?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He ceas'd, and May with modest grace reply'd;</L>
<L>(Weak was her voice, as while she spoke she cry'd:)</L>
<L>Heav'n knows (with that a tender sigh she drew)</L>
<L>I have a soul to save as well as you;</L>
<L>And, what no less you to my charge commend,</L>
<L N="580">My dearest honour, will to death defend.</L>
<L>To you in holy Church I gave my hand,</L>
<L>And join'd my heart in wedlock's sacred band:</L>
<L>Yet after this, if you distrust my care,</L>
<L>Then hear, my Lord, and witness what I swear:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
<L N="585">First may the yawning earth her bosom rend,</L>
<L>And let me hence to hell alive descend;</L>
<L>Or die the death I dread no less than hell,</L>
<L>Sew'd in a sack, and plung'd into a well:</L>
<L>Ere I my fame by one lewd act disgrace,</L>
<L N="590">Or once renounce the honour of my race.</L>
<L>For know, Sir Knight, of gentle blood I came,</L>
<L>I loath a whore, and startle at the name.</L>
<L>But jealous men on their own crimes reflect,</L>
<L>And learn from thence their ladies to suspect:</L>
<L N="595">Else why these needless cautions, Sir, to me?</L>
<L>These doubts and fears of female constancy!</L>
<L>This chime still rings in ev'ry lady's ear,</L>
<L>The only strain a wife must hope to hear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus while she spoke a sidelong glance she cast,</L>
<L N="600">Where Damian kneeling, worshipp'd as she past.</L>
<L>She saw him watch the motions of her eye,</L>
<L>And singled out a pear-tree planted nigh:</L>
<L>'Twas charg'd with fruit that made a goodly show,</L>
<L>And hung with dangling pears was ev'ry bough.</L>
<L N="605">Thither th'obsequious Squire address'd his pace,</L>
<L>And climbing, in the summit took his place;</L>
<L>The Knight and Lady walk'd beneath in view,</L>
<L>Where let us leave them, and our tale pursue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
<L>'Twas now the season when the glorious sun</L>
<L N="615">His heav'nly progress thro' the Twins had run;</L>
<L>And Jove, exalted, his mild influence yields,</L>
<L>To glad the glebe, and paint the flow'ry fields.</L>
<L>Clear was the day, and Phoebus rising bright,</L>
<L N="619">Had streak'd the azure firmament with light;</L>
<L>He pierc'd the glitt'ring clouds with golden streams,</L>
<L>And warm'd the womb of earth with genial beams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It so befel, in that fair morning-tide,</L>
<L>The Fairies sported on the garden side,</L>
<L>And in the midst their Monarch and his bride.</L>
<L N="620">So featly tripp'd the light-foot ladies round,</L>
<L>The knights so nimbly o'er the greensword bound,</L>
<L>That scarce they bent the flow'rs, or touch'd the ground.</L>
<L>The dances ended, all the fairy train</L>
<L>For pinks and daisies search'd the flow'ry plain;</L>
<L N="625">While on a bank reclin'd of rising green,</L>
<L>Thus, with a frown, the King bespoke his Queen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis too apparent, argue what you can,</L>
<L>The treachery you women use to man:</L>
<L>A thousand authors have this truth made out,</L>
<L N="630">And sad experience leaves no room for doubt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
<L>Heav'n rest thy spirit, noble Solomon,</L>
<L>A wiser monarch never saw the sun:</L>
<L>All wealth, all honours, the supreme degree</L>
<L>Of earthly bliss, was well bestow'd on thee!</L>
<L N="635">For sagely hast thou said: Of all mankind,</L>
<L>One only just, and righteous, hope to find:</L>
<L>But should'st thou search the spacious world around,</L>
<L>Yet one good woman is not to be found.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus says the King who knew your wickedness;</L>
<L>The son of Sirach testifies no less.</L>
<L N="640">So may some wildfire on your bodies fall,</L>
<L>Or some devouring plague consume you all;</L>
<L>As well you view the leacher in the tree,</L>
<L>And well this honourable Knight you see:</L>
<L>But since he's blind and old (a helpless case)</L>
<L N="645">His Squire shall cuckold him before your face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now by my own dread majesty I swear,</L>
<L>And by this aweful sceptre which I bear,</L>
<L>No impious wretch shall 'scape unpunish'd long,</L>

<L N="650">I will this instant undeceive the Knight,</L>
<L>And, in the very act restore his sight:</L>
<L>And set the strumpet here in open view,</L>
<L>A warning to these Ladies, and to you,</L>
<L>And all the faithless sex, for ever to be true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
<L>And will you so, reply'd the Queen, indeed?</L>
<L N="656">Now, by my mother's soul it is decreed,</L>
<L>She shall not want an answer at her need.</L>
<L>For her, and for her daughters, I'll engage,</L>
<L>And all the sex in each succeeding age;</L>
<L N="660">Art shall be theirs to varnish an offence,</L>
<L>And fortify their crimes with confidence.</L>
<L>Nay, were they taken in a strict embrace,</L>
<L>Seen with both eyes, and pinion'd on the place;</L>
<L>All they shall need is to protest and swear,</L>
<L N="665">Breathe a soft sigh, and drop a tender tear;</L>
<L>Till their wise husbands, gull'd by arts liké these,</L>
<L>Grow gentle, tractable, and tame as geese.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tho' this sland'rous Jew, this Solomon,</L>
<L>Call'd women fools, and knew full many a one;</L>
<L N="670">The wiser wits of later times declare,</L>
<L>How constant, chaste, and virtuous women are:</L>

<L>What tho' this King (as ancient story boasts)</L>
<L>Built a fair temple to the Lord of hosts;</L>

<L>David, the monarch after heav'n's own mind,</L>

<LG>
<L>Well, I'm a Woman, and as such must speak;</L>
<L>Silence would swell me, and my heart would break.</L>

<L>Nay (quoth the King) dear Madam, be not wroth:</L>

That this much-injur'd Knight again should see;</L>
<L>It must be done—I am a King, said he,</L>

<L>And so has mine (she said)—I am a Queen:</L>

<L>We leave them here in this heroic strain,</L>

<L>Who in the garden, with his lovely May,</L>
<L>Sung merrier than the Cuckow or the Jay:</L>
<L>This was his song; "Oh kind and constant be,</L>
<L>"Constant and kind I'll ever prove to thee."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="715">Thus singing as he went, at last he drew</L>
<L>By easy steps, to where the Pear-tree grew:</L>
<L>The longing dame look'd up, and spy'd her Love</L>
<L>Full fairly perch'd among the boughs above.</L>
<L>She stopp'd, and sighing: Oh good Gods, she cry'd,</L>
<L>What pangs, what sudden shoots distend my side?</L>
<L N="721">O for that tempting fruit, so fresh, so green;</L>
<L>Help, for the love of heav'n's immortal Queen!</L>
<L>Help, dearest lord, and save at once the life▪</L>
<L>Of thy poor infant, and thy longing wife!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
<L>Sore sigh'd the Knight to hear his Lady's cry,</L>
<L>But could not climb, and had no servant nigh:</L>
<L>Old as he was, and void of eye-sight too,</L>
<L>What could, alas! a helpless husband do?</L>
<L>And must I languish then, she said, and die,</L>
<L N="730">Yet view the lovely fruit before my eye?</L>
<L>At least, kind Sir, for charity's sweet sake,</L>
<L>Vouchsafe the trunk between your arms to take;</L>
<L>Then from your back I might ascend the tree;</L>
<L>Do you but stoop, and leave the rest to me.</L>

<LG>
<L N="735">With all my soul, he thus reply'd again,</L>
<L>I'd spend my dearest blood to ease thy pain.</L>
<L>With that, his back against the trunk he bent,</L>
<L>She seiz'd a twig, and up the tree she went.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now prove your patience, gentle Ladies all!</L>
<L N="740">Nor let on me your heavy anger fall:</L>

Strait on the tree his eager eyes he bent,</L>
<L>As one whose thoughts were on his spouse intent;</L>

<L>Death! hell! and furies! what dost thou do there?</L>

<L>What ails my lord? the trembling dame reply'd;</L>
<L>I thought your patience had been better try'd:</L>
<L>Is this your love, ungrateful and unkind,</L>

But till your sight's establish'd, for a while,</L>

<L>Jove ne'er spoke oracle more true than this,</L>
<L>None judge so wrong as those who think amiss.</L>

<LG>
<L>With that she leap'd into her Lord's embrace,</L>
<L N="811">With well-dissembled virtue in her face.</L>
<L>He hugg'd her close, and kiss'd her o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>Disturb'd with doubts and jealousies no more:</L>
<L>Both, pleas'd and bless'd, renew'd their mutual vows,</L>
<L N="815">A fruitful wife, and a believing spouse.</L>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>OEDIPUS King of Thebes having by mistake slain his father Laius, and marry'd his mother Jocasta; put out his own eyes, and resign'd the realm to his sons, Eteocles and Polynices. Being neglected by them, he makes his prayer to the fury Tisiphone, to sow debate betwixt the brothers. They agree at last to reign singly, each a year by turns, and the first lot is obtain'd by Eteocles. Jupiter, in a council of the Gods, declares his resolution of punishing the Thebans, and Argives also, by means of a marriage betwixt Poly∣nices and one of the daughters of Adrastus King of Ar∣gos. Juno opposes, but to no effect; and Mercury is sent on a message to the shades, to the ghost of Laius, who is to appear to Eteocles, and provoke him to break the agreement. Polynices in the mean time departs from Thebes by night, is overtaken by a storm, and ar∣rives at Argos; where he meets with Tydeus▪ who had fled from Calydon, having kill'd his brother. Adrastus entertains them, having receiv'd an oracle from Apollo that his daughters should be marry'd to a Boar and a Lion, which he understands to be meant of these stran∣gers by whom the hides of those beasts were worn, and who arriv'd at the time when he kept an annual feast in honour of that God. The rise of this solemnity he re∣lates to his guests, the loves of Phoebus and Psamathe, and the story of Choroebus. He enquires, and is made acquainted with their descent and quality: The sacrifice is renew'd, and the book concludes with a Hymn to Apollo.</P>
<P>The Translator hopes he needs not apologize for his Choice of this piece, which was made almost in his Childhood. But finding the Version better than he expected, he gave it some Correction a few years afterwards.</P>

<L>THE fair Pomona flourish'd in his reign;</L>
<L>Of all the Virgins of the sylvan train,</L>
<L>None taught the trees a nobler race to bear,</L>
<L>Or more improv'd the vegetable care.</L>
<L N="5">To her the shady grove, the flow'ry field,</L>
<L>The streams and fountains, no delights could yield▪</L>
<L>'Twas all her joy the ripening fruits to tend,</L>
<L>And see the boughs with happy burthens bend.</L>
<L>The hook she bore instead of Cynthia's spear,</L>
<L N="10">To lop the growth of the luxuriant year,</L>
<L>To decent form the lawless shoots to bring,</L>
<L>And teach th' obedient branches where to spring.</L>
<L>Now the cleft rind inserted graffs receives,</L>
<L>And yields an offspring more than nature gives;</L>
