HUMPHRY CLINKER.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To DR. LEWIS.
DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>YOUR fable of the monkey and the
pig, is what the Italians call <HI>ben
trovata:</HI> but I shall not repeat it to my
apothecary, who is a proud Scotchman,
very thin skinned, and, for aught I know,
may have his degree in his pocket—A
right Scotchman has always two strings
to his bow, and is <HI>in utrumque paratus</HI>—
Certain it is, I have not 'scaped a scour∣ing;
but, I believe, by means of that
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
scouring, I have 'scaped something worse,
perhaps a tedious fit of the gout or rheu∣matism;
for my appetite began to slagg,
and I had certain croakings in the bowels,
which boded me no good—Nay, I am
not yet quite free of these remembrances,
which warn me to be gone from this
centre of infection—</P>
<P>What temptation can a man of my turn
and temperament have, to live in a place
where every corner teems with fresh ob∣jects
of detestation and disgust? What
kind of taste and organs must those peo∣ple
have, who really prefer the adulte∣rate
enjoyments of the town to the ge∣nuine
pleasures of a country retreat?
Most people, I know, are originally se∣duced
by vanity, ambition, and childish
curiosity; which cannot be gratified, but
in the <HI>busy haunts of men:</HI> but, in the course
of this gratification, their very organs of
sense are perverted, and they become ha∣bitually
lost to every relish of what is
genuine and excellent in it's own na∣ture.</P>
<P>Shall I state the difference between my
town grievances, and my country com∣forts?
At Brambleton-hall, I have el∣bow-room
within doors, and breathe a
clear, elastic, salutary air—I enjoy re∣freshing
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
sleep, which is never disturbed
by horrid noise, nor interrupted, but in
a-morning, by the sweet twitter of the
martlet at my window—I drink the vir∣gin
lymph, pure and crystalline as it
gushes from the rock, or the sparkling
beveridge, home-brewed from malt of my
own making; or I indulge with cyder,
which my own orchard affords; or with
claret of the best growth, imported for
my own use, by a correspondent on whose
integrity I can depend; my bread is sweet
and nourishing, made from my own
wheat, ground in my own mill, and
baked in my own oven; my table is, in a
great measure, furnished from my own
ground; my five-year old mutton, fed
on the fragrant herbage of the mountains,
that might vie with venison in juice and
flavour; my delicious veal, fattened with
nothing but the mother's milk, that fills
the dish with gravy; my poultry from
the barn-door, that never knew confine∣ment,
but when they were at roost; my
rabbits panting from the warren; my game
fresh from the moors; my trout and sal∣mon
struggling from the stream; oysters
from their native banks; and herrings,
with other sea-fish, I can eat in four hours
after they are taken—My sallads, roots,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
and pot-herbs, my own garden yields in
plenty and perfection; the produce of
the natural soil, prepared by moderate
cultivation. The same soil affords all
the different fruits which England may
call her own, so that my desert is every
day fresh-gathered from the tree; my
dairy flows with nectarious tides of milk
and cream, from whence we derive abun∣dance
of excellent butter, curds, and
cheese; and the refuse fattens my pigs,
that are destined for hams and bacon—I
go to bed betimes, and rise with the sun
—I make shift to pass the hours without
weariness or regret, and am not destitute
of amusements within doors, when the
weather will not permit me to go abroad
—I read, and chat, and play at billiards,
cards, or back-gammon—Without doors,
I superintend my farm, and execute plans
of improvement, the effects of which I
enjoy with unspeakable delight—Nor do
I take less pleasure in seeing my tenants
thrive under my auspices, and the poor
live comfortably by the employment
which I provide—You know I have one
or two sensible friends, to whom I can
open all my heart; a blessing which, per∣haps,
I might have sought in vain among
the crowded scenes of life: there are a
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
few others of more humble parts, whom
I esteem for their integrity; and their
conversation I find inoffensive, though
not very entertaining. Finally, I live in
the midst of honest men, and trusty de∣pendants,
who, I flatter myself, have a
disinterested attachment to my person—
You, yourself, my dear Doctor, can
vouch for the truth of these asser∣tions.</P>
<P>Now, mark the contrast at London—
I am pent up in frowzy lodgings, where
there is not room enough to swing a cat;
and I breathe the steams of endless pu∣trefaction;
and these would, undoubtedly,
produce a pestilence, if they were not
qualified by the gross acid of sea-coal,
which is itself a pernicious nuisance to
lungs of any delicacy of texture: but
even this boasted corrector cannot pre∣vent
those languid, sallow looks, that
distinguish the inhabitants of London
from those ruddy swains that lead a coun∣try-life
—I go to bed after mid-night,
jaded and restless from the dissipations of
the day—I start every hour from my
sleep, at the horrid noise of the watch∣men
bawling the hour through every
street, and thundering at every door; a
set of useless fellows, who serve no other
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
purpose but that of disturbing the repose
of the inhabitants; and by five o'clock I
start out of bed, in consequence of the
still more dreadful alarm made by the
country ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, and noisy rustics bellow∣ing
green pease under my window. If I
would drink water, I must quaff the
maukish contents of an open aqueduct,
exposed to all manner of defilement; or
swallow that which comes from the river
Thames, impregnated with all the filth
of London and Westminster—Human
excrement is the least offensive part of the
concrete, which is composed of all the
drugs, minerals, and poisons, used in me∣chanics
and manufacture, enriched with
the putrefying carcases of beasts and men;
and mixed with the scourings of all the
wash-tubs, kennels, and common sewers,
within the bills of mortality.</P>
<P>This is the agreeable potation, extolled
by the Londoners, as the finest water in
the universe—As to the intoxicating po∣tion,
sold for wine, it is a vile, unpalat∣able,
and pernicious sophistication, bal∣derdashed
with cyder, corn spirit, and the
juice of sloes. In an action at law, laid
against a carman for having staved a
cask of port, it appeared from the evi∣dence
of the cooper, that there were not
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
above five gallons of real wine in the
whole pipe, which held above a hundred,
and even that had been brewed and adul∣terated
by the merchant at Oporto. The
bread I eat in London, is a deleterious
paste, mixed up with chalk, alum, and
bone-ashes; insipid to the taste, and de∣structive
to the constitution. The good
people are not ignorant of this adultera∣tion;
but they prefer it to wholsome
bread, because it is whiter than the meal
of corn: thus they sacrifice their taste and
their health, and the lives of their tender
infants, to a most absurd gratification of
a mis-judging eye; and the miller, or the
baker, is obliged to poison them and their
families, in order to live by his profes∣sion.
The same monstrous depravity ap∣pears
in their veal, which is bleached by
repeated bleedings, and other villanous
arts, till there is not a drop of juice left
in the body, and the poor animal is pa∣ralytic
before it dies; so void of all taste,
nourishment, and savour, that a man
might dine as comfortably on a white
fricasee of kid-skin gloves, or chip hats
from Leghorn.</P>
<P>As they have discharged the natural
colour from their bread, their butchers∣meat,
and poultry, their cutlets, ragouts,
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
fricassees, and sauces of all kinds; so
they insist upon having the complexion of
their pot-herbs mended, even at the
hazard of their lives. Perhaps, you will
hardly believe they can be so mad as to
boil their greens with brass half-pence, in
order to improve their colour; and yet
nothing is more true—Indeed, without
this improvement in the colour, they have
no personal merit. They are produced in
an artificial soil, and taste of nothing but
the dunghills, from whence they spring.
My cabbage, cauliflower, and 'sparagus
in the country, are as much superior in
flavour to those that are sold in Covent∣garden,
as my heath-mutton is to that of
St. James's-market; which, in fact, is
neither lamb nor mutton, but something
betwixt the two, gorged in the rank fens
of Lincoln and Essex, pale, coarse, and
frowzy—As for the pork, it is an abomi∣nable
carnivorous animal, fed with horse∣flesh
and distillers grains; and the poul∣try
is all rotten, in consequence of a fever,
occasioned by the infamous practice of
sewing up the gut, that they may be
the sooner fattened in coops, in conse∣quence
of this cruel retention.</P>
<P>Of the fish, I need say nothing in this
hot weather, but that it comes sixty, se∣venty,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
fourscore, and a hundred miles
by land-carriage; a circumstance suffi∣cient,
without any comment, to turn a
Dutchman's stomach, even if his nose was
not saluted in every alley with the sweet
flavour of <HI>fresh</HI> mackarel, selling by re∣tail
—This is not the season for oysters;
nevertheless, it may not be amiss to men∣tion,
that the right Colchester are kept
in slime-pits, occasionally overflowed by
the sea; and that the green colour, so
much admired by the voluptuaries of this
metropolis, is occasioned by the vitriolic
scum, which rises on the surface of the
stagnant and stinking water—Our rab∣bits
are bred and fed in the poulterer's
cellar, where they have neither air nor
exercise, consequently they must be firm
in flesh, and delicious in flavour; and
there is no game to be had for love or
money.</P>
<P>It must be owned, that Covent-garden
affords some good fruit; which, how∣ever,
is always engrossed by a few indi∣viduals
of over-grown fortune, at an ex∣orbitant
price; so that little else than the
refuse of the market falls to the share of
the community; and that is distributed by
such filthy hands, as I cannot look at
without loathing. It was but yesterday
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
that I saw a dirty barrow-bunter in the
street, cleaning her dusty fruit with her
own spittle; and, who knows but some
fine lady of St. James's parish might ad∣mit
into her delicate mouth those very
cherries, which had been rolled and
moistened between the filthy, and, per∣haps,
ulcerated chops of a St. Giles's
huckster—I need not dwell upon the pal∣lid,
contaminated mash, which they call
strawberries; soiled and tossed by greasy
paws through twenty baskets crusted
with dirt; and then presented with the
worst milk, thickened with the worst
flour, into a bad likeness of cream: but
the milk itself should not pass unanalysed,
the produce of faded cabbage-leaves and
sour draff, lowered with hot water, froth∣ed
with bruised snails, carried through the
streets in open pails, exposed to foul
rinsings, discharged from doors and win∣dows,
spittle, snot, and tobacco-quids
from foot-passengers, over-flowings from
mud-carts, spatterings from coach-wheels,
dirt and trash chucked into it by roguish
boys for the joke's-sake, the spewings of
infants, who have slabbered in the tin∣measure,
which is thrown back in that
condition among the milk, for the bene∣fit
of the next customer; and, finally,
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
the vermin that drops from the rags of
the nasty drab that vends this precious
mixture, under the respectable denomi∣nation
of milk-maid.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this catalogue of Lon∣don
dainties, with that table-beer, guilt∣less
of hops and malt, vapid and nau∣seous;
much fitter to facilitate the opera∣tion
of a vomit, than to quench thirst and
promote digestion; the tallowy rancid
mass, called butter, manufactured with
candle-grease and kitchen-stuff; and their
fresh eggs, imported from France and
Scotland.—Now, all these enormities
might be remedied with a very little at∣tention
to the article of police, or civil
regulation; but the wise patriots of Lon∣don
have taken it into their heads, that
all regulation is inconsistent with liberty;
and that every man ought to live in his
own way, without restraint—Nay, as
there is not sense enough left among
them, to be discomposed by the nuisances
I have mentioned, they may, for aught
I care, wallow in the mire of their own
pollution.</P>
<P>A companionable man will, undoubt∣edly,
put up with many inconveniences
for the sake of enjoying agreeable society.
A facetious friend of mine used to say,
the wine could not be bad, where the
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
company was agreeable; a maxim which,
however, ought to be taken <HI>cum grano sa∣lis:</HI>
but what is the society of London,
that I should be tempted, for its sake, to
mortify my senses, and compound with
such uncleanness as my soul abhors? All
the people I see, are too much engrossed
by schemes of interest or ambition, to
have any room left for sentiment or
friendship—Even in some of my old ac∣quaintance,
those schemes and pursuits,
have obliterated all traces of our former
connexion—Conversation is reduced to
party-disputes, and illiberal altercation—
Social commerce, to formal vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its and
card-playing—If you pick up a diverting
original by accident, it may be dangerous
to amuse yourself with his oddities—He
is generally a tartar at bottom; a sharper,
a spy, or a lunatic. Every person you
deal with endeavours to over-reach you
in the way of business; you are preyed
upon by idle mendicants, who beg in the
phrase of borrowing, and live upon the
spoils of the stranger—Your tradesmen
are without conscience, your friends with∣out
affection, and your dependants without
fidelity.—</P>
<P>My letter would swell into a treatise,
were I to particularize every cause of of∣fence
that fills up the measure of my
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
aversion to this, and every other crowded
city—Thank Heaven! I am not so far
sucked into the vortex, but that I can
disengage myself without any great effort
of philosophy—From this wild uproar of
knavery, folly, and impertinence, I shall
fly with double relish to the serenity of re∣tirement,
the cordial effusions of unre∣served
friendship, the hospitality and pro∣tection
of the rural gods; in a word, the
<HI>jucunda oblivia vitae,</HI> which Horace him∣self
had not taste enough to enjoy.—</P>
<P>I have agreed for a good travelling-coach
and four, at a guinea a day, for
three months certain; and next week we
intend to begin our journey to the North,
hoping still to be with you by the lat∣ter
end of October—I shall continue to
write from every stage where we make
any considerable halt, as often as any
thing occurs, which I think can afford
you the least amusement. In the mean
time, I must beg you will superintend
the oeconomy of Barns, with respect to
my hay and corn harvests; assured that
my ground produces nothing but what
you may freely call your own—On any
other terms I should be ashamed to sub∣scribe
myself</P>

<LETTER>
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>IN my last, I mentioned my having
spent an evening with a society of authors,
who seemed to be jealous and afraid of
one another. My uncle was not at all
surprised to hear me say I was disappoint∣ed
in their conversation. “A man may
be very entertaining and instructive
upon paper, (said he) and exceedingly
dull in common discourse. I have ob∣served,
that those who shine most in
private company, are but secondary
stars in the constellation of genius—A
small stock of ideas is more easily ma∣naged,
and sooner displayed, than a
great quantity crowded together. There
is very seldom any thing extraordinary
in the appearance and address of a good
writer; whereas a dull author generally
distinguishes himself by some oddity or
extravagance. For this reason, I fancy,
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
an assembly of Grubs must be very di∣verting.”</P>
<P>My curiosity being excited by this hint,
I consulted my friend Dick Ivy, who un∣dertook
to gratify it the very next day,
which was Sunday last.—He carried me
to dine with S—, whom you and I have
long known by his writings.—He lives in
the skirts of the town, and every Sunday
his house is open to all unfortunate bro∣thers
of the quill, whom he treats with
beef, pudding, and potatoes, port, punch,
and Calvert's entire butt beer.—He has
fixed upon the first day of the week for
the exercise of his hospitality, because
some of his guests could not enjoy it on
any other, for reasons that I need not ex∣plain.
I was civilly received in a plain, yet
decent habitation, which opened backwards
into a very pleasant garden, kept in excel∣lent
order; and, indeed, I saw none of the
outward signs of authorship, either in the
house or the landlord, who is one of those
few writers of the age that stand upon
their own foundation, without patronage,
and above dependence. If there was no∣thing
characteristic in the entertainer, the
company made ample amends for his
want of singularity.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
At two in the afternoon, I found my∣self
one of ten mess-mates seated at table;
and, I question, if the whole kingdom
could produce such another assemblage of
originals. Among their peculiarities, I do
not mention those of dress, which may be
purely accidental. What struck me were
oddities originally produced by affecta∣tion,
and afterwards confirmed by habit.
One of them wore spectacles at dinner,
and another, his hat flapped; though (as
Ivy told me) the first was noted for hav∣ing
a seaman's eye, when a bailiff was in
the wind; and the other was never known
to labour under any weakness or defect of
vision, except about five years ago, when
he was complimented with a couple of
black eyes by a player, with whom he
had quarrelled in his drink. A third
wore a laced stocking, and made use of
crutches, because, once in his life, he
had been laid up with a broken leg,
though no man could leap over a stick
with more agility. A fourth had con∣tracted
such an antipathy to the country,
that he insisted upon sitting with his back
towards the window that looked into the
garden, and when a dish of cauliflower
was set upon the table, he snuffed up vo∣latile
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
salts to keep him from fainting;
yet this delicate person was the son of a
cottager, born under a hedge, and had
many years run wild among asses on a
common. A fifth affected distraction—
When spoke to, he always answered from
the purpose—sometimes he suddenly start∣ed
up, and rapped out a dreadful oath—
sometimes he burst out a-laughing—then
he folded his arms, and sighed—and then
he hissed like fifty serpents.</P>
<P>At first, I really thought he was mad,
and, as he sat near me, began to be under
some apprehensions for my own safety,
when our landlord, perceiving me alarm∣ed,
assured me aloud that I had nothing
to fear. “The gentleman (said he) is
trying to act a part, for which he is by
no means qualified—if he had all the
inclination in the world, it is not in his
power to be mad. His spirits are too
flat to be kindled into frenzy.” “'Tis
no bad p-p-puff, how-ow-ever (observ∣ed
a person in a tarnished laced coat):
aff-ffected m-madness w-will p-pass for
w-wit w-with nine-ninet-teen out of
t-twenty.”—“And affected stuttering
for humour: replied our landlord, tho',
God knows, there is no affinity betwixt
them.” It seems, this wag, after hav∣ing
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
made some abortive attempts in
plain speaking, had recourse to this de∣fect,
by means of which he frequently ex∣torted
the laugh of the company, without
the least expence of genius; and that im∣perfection,
which he had at first counter∣feited,
was now become so habitual, that
he could not lay it aside.</P>
<P>A certain winking genius, who wore
yellow gloves at dinner, had, on his first
introduction, taken such offence at S—,
because he looked and talked, and ate
and drank like any other man, that he
spoke contemptuously of his understand∣ing
ever after, and never would repeat
his visit, until he had exhibited the fol∣lowing
proof of his caprice. Wat Wyvil,
the poet, having made some unsuccessful
advances towards an intimacy with S—,
at last gave him to understand, by a third
person, that he had written a poem in his
praise, and a satire against his person;
that if he would admit him to his house,
the first should be immediately sent to
press; but that if he persisted in declining
his friendship, he would publish the satire
without delay. S—replied, that he
looked upon Wyvil's panegyrick, as in
effect, a species of infamy, and would re∣sent
it accordingly with a good cudgel;
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
but if he published the satire, he might
deserve his compassion, and had nothing
to fear from his revenge. Wyvil having
considered the alternative, resolved to
mortify S—by printing the panegyrick,
for which he received a sound drubbing.
Then he swore the peace against the ag∣gressor,
who, in order to avoid a prose∣cution
at law, admitted him to his good
graces. It was the singularity in S—'s
conduct on this occasion, that reconciled
him to the yellow-gloved philosopher,
who owned he had some genius, and
from that period cultivated his acquain∣tance.</P>
<P>Curious to know upon what subjects
the several talents of my fellow-guests
were employed, I applied to my commu∣nicative
friend Dick Ivy, who gave me to
understand, that most of them were, or
had been, understrappers, or journeymen,
to more creditable authors, for whom
they translated, collated, and compiled,
in the business of book-making; and that
all of them had, at different times, la∣boured
in the service of our landlord,
though they had now set up for them∣selves
in various departments of literature.
Not only their talents, but also their na∣tions
and dialects were so various, that
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
our conversation resembled the confusion
of tongues at Babel. We had the Irish
brogue, the Scotch accent, and foreign
idiom, twanged off by the most discor∣dant
vociferation; for, as they all spoke
together, no man had any chance to be
heard, unless he could bawl louder than
his fellows. It must be owned, however,
there was nothing pedantic in their dis∣course;
they carefully avoided all learn∣ed
disquisitions, and endeavoured to be
facetious; nor did their endeavours al∣ways
miscarry—some droll repartee
passed, and much laughter was excited;
and if any individual lost his temper so
far as to transgress the bounds of deco∣rum,
he was effectually checked by the
master of the feast, who exerted a sort of
paternal authority over this irritable
tribe.</P>
<P>The most learned philosopher of the
whole collection, who had been expelled
the university for atheism, has made great
progress in a refutation of lord Boling∣broke's
metaphysical works, which is said
to be equally ingenious and orthodox;
but, in the mean time, he has been pre∣sented
to the grand jury as a public nui∣sance,
for having blasphemed in an ale∣house
on the Lord's day. The Scotch∣man
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
gives lectures on the pronunciation
of the English language, which he is now
publishing by subscription.</P>
<P>The Irishman is a political writer, and
goes by the name of my Lord Potatoe.
He wrote a pamphlet in vindication of a
minister, hoping his zeal would be re∣warded
with some place or pension; but
finding himself neglected in that quarter,
he whispered about, that the pamphlet
was written by the minister himself, and
he published an answer to his own pro∣duction.
In this, he addressed the author
under the title of <HI>your lordship</HI> with such
solemnity, that the public swallowed the
deceit, and bought up the whole impres∣sion.
The wise politicians of the metro∣polis
declared they were both masterly
performances, and chuckled over the
flimsy reveries of an ignorant garretteer,
as the profound speculations of a veteran
statesman, acquainted with all the secrets
of the cabinet. The imposture was detect∣ed
in the sequel, and our Hibernian pam∣phleteer
retains no part of his assumed
importance, but the bare title of <HI>my lord,</HI>
and the upper part of the table at the po∣tatoe-ordinary
in Shoe-lane.</P>
<P>Opposite to me sat a Piedmontese, who
had obliged the public with a humorous
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
satire, intituled, <HI>The Balance of the English
Poets,</HI> a performance which evinced the
great modesty and taste of the author,
and, in particular, his intimacy with the
elegancies of the English language. The
sage, who laboured under the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
or <HI>horror of green fields,</HI> had just finished a
treatise on practical agriculture, though,
in fact, he had never seen corn growing in
his life, and was so ignorant of grain, that
our entertainer, in the face of the whole
company, made him own, that a plate of
hominy was the best rice pudding he had
ever eat.</P>
<P>The stutterer had almost finished his
travels through Europe and part of Asia,
without ever budging beyond the liberties
of the King's Bench, except in term-time,
with a tipstaff for his companion; and as
for little Tim Cropdale, the most face∣tious
member of the whole society, he
had happily wound up the catastrophe of
a virgin tragedy, from the exhibition of
which he promised himself a large fund
of profit and reputation. Tim had made
shift to live many years by writing novels,
at the rate of five pounds a volume; but
that branch of business is now engrossed
by female authors, who publish merely
for the propagation of virtue, with so
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
much ease and spirit, and delicacy, and
knowledge of the human heart, and all
in the serene tranquillity of high life, that
the reader is not only inchanted by their
genius, but reformed by their morality.</P>
<P>After dinner, we adjourned into the
garden, where, I observed, Mr. S—
gave a short separate audience to every in∣dividual
in a small remote filbert walk,
from whence most of them dropt off
one after another, without further cere∣mony;
but they were replaced by fresh
recruits of the same clan, who came to
make an afternoon's visit; and, among
other's, a spruce bookseller, called Bir∣kin,
who rode his own gelding, and made
his appearance in a pair of new jemmy
boots, with massy spurs of plate. It was
not without reason, that this midwife of
the Muses used exercise a-horseback, for
he was too fat to walk a-foot, and he un∣derwent
some sarcasms from Tim Crop∣dale,
on his unweildy size and inaptitude
for motion. Birkin, who took umbrage
at this poor author's petulance in presum∣ing
to joke upon a man so much richer
than himself, told him, he was not so un∣weildy
but that he could move the Mar∣shalsea
court for a writ, and even overtake
him with it, if he did not very speedily
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
come and settle accounts with him, re∣specting
the expence of publishing his last
Ode to the king of Prussia, of which he
had sold but three, and one of them was
to Whitefield the methodist. Tim affect∣ed
to receive this intimation with good
humour, saying, he expected in a post or
two, from Potsdam, a poem of thanks
from his Prussian majesty, who knew very
well how to pay poets in their own coin;
but, in the mean time, he proposed, that
Mr. Birkin and he should run three times
round the garden for a bowl of punch, to
be drank at Ashley's in the evening, and
he would run boots against stockings.
The bookseller, who valued himself upon
his mettle, was persuaded to accept the
challenge, and he forthwith resigned his
boots to Cropdale, who, when he bad
put them on, was no bad representation
of captain Pistol in the play.</P>
<P>Every thing being adjusted, they start∣ed
together with great impetuosity, and,
in the second round, Birkin had clearly
the advantage, <HI>larding the lean earth as he
puff'd along.</HI> Cropdale had no mind to
contest the victory further; but, in a
twinkling, disappeared through the back∣door
of the garden, which opened into a
private lane, that had communication
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
with the high road.—The spectators im∣mediately
began to hollow, “Stole away!”
and Birkin set off in pursuit of him with
great eagerness; but he had not advanced
twenty yards in the lane, when a thorn
running into his foot, sent him hopping
back into the garden, roaring with pain,
and swearing with vexation. When he
was delivered from this annoyance by the
Scotchman, who had been bred to surge∣ry,
he looked about him wildly, exclaim∣ing,
“Sure, the fellow won't be such a
rogue as to run clear away with my
boots!” Our landlord, having recon∣noitred
the shoes he had left, which, in∣deed,
hardly deserved that name, “Pray,
(said he) Mr. Birkin, wa'n't your boots
made of calf-skin?” “Claf-skin or
cow-skin, (replied the other) I'll find a
slip of sheep-skin that will do his busi∣ness
—I lost twenty pounds by his farce,
which you persuaded me to buy—I am
out of pocket five pounds by his damn'd
ode; and now this pair of boots, bran
new, cost me thirty shillings, as per re∣ceipt.
—But this affair of the boots is
felony—transportation.—I'll have the
dog indicted at the Old Bailey—I will,
Mr. S—. I will be reveng'd, even
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
though I should lose my debt in con∣sequence
of his conviction.”</P>
<P>Mr. S—said nothing at present, but
accommodated him with a pair of shoes;
then ordered his servant to rub him down,
and comfort him with a glass of rum∣punch,
which seemed, in a great measure,
to cool the rage of his indignation. “Af∣ter
all, (said our landlord) this is no
more than a <HI>humbug</HI> in the way of wit,
though it deserves a more respectable
epithet, when considered as an effort of
invention. Tim, being (I suppose) out
of credit with the cordwainer, fell upon
this ingenious expedient to supply the
want of shoes, knowing that Mr. Bir∣kin,
who loves humour, would him∣self
relish the joke upon a little recol∣lection.
Cropdale literally lives by his
wit, which he has exercised upon all his
friends in their turns. He once bor∣rowed
my poney for five or six days to
go to Salisbury, and sold him in Smith∣field
at his return. This was a joke of
such a serious nature, that, in the first
transports of my passion, I had some
thoughts of prosecuting him for horse∣stealing;
and even when my resent∣ment
had in some measure subsided, as
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
he industriously avoided me, I vowed, I
would take satisfaction on his ribs with
the first opportunity. One day, seeing
him at some distance in the street, coming
towards me, I began to prepare my cane
for action, and walked in the shadow of
a porter, that he might not perceive me
soon enough to make his escape; but,
in the very instant I had lifted up the
instrument of correction, I found Tim
Cropdale metamorphosed into a miser∣able
blind wretch, feeling his way with a
long stick from post to post, and roll∣ing
about two bald unlighted orbs in∣stead
of eyes. I was exceedingly shocked
at having so narrowly escaped the con∣cern
and disgrace that would have at∣tended
such a misapplication of ven∣geance:
but, next day, Tim prevailed
upon a friend of mine to come and sol∣licit
my forgiveness, and offer his note,
payable in six weeks, for the price of
the poney.—This gentleman gave me
to understand, that the blind man was
no other than Cropdale, who having
seen me advancing, and guessing my
intent, had immediately converted him∣self
into the object aforesaid.—I was so
diverted at the ingenuity of the evasion,
that I agreed to pardon his offence, re∣fusing
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
his note, however, that I might
keep a prosecution for felony hanging
over his head, as a security for his fu∣ture
good behaviour—But Timothy
would by no means trust himself in my
hands till the note was accepted—then
he made his appearance at my door as
a blind beggar, and imposed in such a
manner upon my man, who had been
his old acquaintance and pot-compa∣nion,
that the fellow threw the door in
his face, and even threatened to give
him the bastinado. Hearing a noise in
the hall, I went thither, and imme∣diately
recollecting the figure I had
passed in the street, accosted him by his
own name, to the unspeakable astonish∣ment
of the footmans.”</P>
<P>Birkin declared he loved a joke as well
as another; but asked if any of the com∣pany
could tell where Mr. Cropdale
lodged, that he might send him a propo∣sal
about restitution, before the boots
should be made away with. “I would
willingly give him a pair of new shoes,
(said he) and half a guinea into the bar∣gain,
for the boots, which fitted me
like a glove; and I shan't be able to
get the follows of them till the good
weather for riding is over.” The stut∣tering
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
wit declared, that the only secret
which Cropdale ever kept, was the place
of his lodgings; but, be believed, that,
during the heats of summer, he common∣ly
took his repose upon a bulk, or indul∣ged
himself, in fresco, with one of the
kennel-nymphs, under the portico of St.
Martin's church. “Pox on him! (cried
the bookseller) he might as well have
taken my whip and spurs—In that case,
he might have been tempted to steal
another horse, and then he would have
rid to the devil of course.”</P>
<P>After coffee, I took my leave of Mr.
S—, with proper acknowledgements
of his civility, and was extremely well
pleased with the entertainment of the day,
though not yet satisfied, with respect to
the nature of this connexion, betwixt a
man of character in the literary world, and
a parcel of authorlings, who, in all pro∣bability,
would never be able to acquire
any degree of reputation by their labours.
On this head I interrogated my conductor,
Dick Ivy, who answered to this effect—
“One would imagine S—had some view
to his own interest, in giving countenance
and assistance to those people, whom he
knows to be bad men, as well as bad
writers; but, if he has any such view,
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
he will find himself disappointed; for
if he is so vain as to imagine he can
make them subservient to his schemes
of profit or ambition, they are cun∣ning
enough to make him their proper∣ty
in the mean time. There is not one
of the company you have seen to-day
(myself excepted) who does not owe
him particular obligations.—One of
them he bailed out of a spunging-house,
and afterwards paid the debt—another
he translated into his family, and cloath∣ed,
when he was turned out half naked
from jail in consequence of an act for
the relief of insolvent debtors—a third,
who was reduced to a woollen night∣cap,
and lived upon sheeps trotters, up
three pair of stairs backward in But∣cher-row,
he took into present pay and
free quarters, and enabled him to ap∣pear
as a gentleman, without having
the fear of sheriff's officers before his
eyes. Those who are in distress he
supplies with money when he has it,
and with his credit when he is out of
cash. When they want business, he
either finds employment for them in his
own service, or recommends them to
booksellers to execute some project he
has formed for their subsistence. They
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
are always welcome to his table, (which,
though plain, is plentiful) and to his
good offices as far as they will go; and
when they see occasion, they make use
of his name with the most petulant fa∣miliarity;
nay, they do not even scruple
to arrogate to themselves the merit of
some of his performances, and have been
known to sell their own lucubrations as
the produce of his brain. The Scotch∣man
you saw at dinner once personated
him at an ale-house in West-Smithfield,
and, in the character of S—, had
his head broke by a cow-keeper, for
having spoke disrespectfully of the
Christian religion; but he took the
law of him in his own person, and the
assailant was fain to give him ten
pounds to withdraw his action.”</P>
<P>I observed, that all this appearance of
liberality on the side of Mr. S—was
easily accounted for, on the supposition
that they flattered him in private, and en∣gaged
his adversaries in public; and yet I
was astonished, when I recollected that I
often had seen this writer virulently abused
in papers, poems, and pamphlets, and not
a pen was drawn in his defence.—“But
you will be more astonished (said he)
when I assure you, those very guests
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
whom you saw at his table to-day, were
the authors of great part of that abuse;
and he himself is well aware of their
particular favours, for they are all
eager to detect and betray one ano∣ther.”
—“But this is doing the devil's
work for nothing (cried I). What
should induce them to revile their bene∣factor
without provocation?” “Envy
(answered Dick) is the general incite∣ment;
but they are galled by an addi∣tional
scourge of provocation. S—
directs a literary journal, in which their
productions are necessarily brought to
trial; and though many of them have
been treated with such lenity and fa∣vour
as they little deserved, yet the
slightest censure, such as, perhaps,
could not be avoided with any preten∣sions
to candour and impartiality, has
rankled in the hearts of those authors
to such a degree, that they have taken
immediate vengeance on the critic in
anonymous libels, letters, and lam∣poons.
Indeed, all the writers of the
age, good, bad, and indifferent, from
the moment he assumed this office,
became his enemies, either profes∣sed
or in petto, except those of his
friends who knew they had nothing to
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
fear from his strictures; and he must be
a wiser man than me, who can tell what
advantage or satisfaction he derives
from having brought such a nest of
hornets about his ears.”</P>
<P>I owned, that was a point which might
deserve consideration; but still I expressed
a desire to know his real motives for con∣tinuing
his friendship to a set of rascals
equally ungrateful and insignificant.—He
said, he did not pretend to assign any rea∣sonable
motive; that, if the truth must
be told, the man was, in point of conduct,
a most incorrigible fool; that, though he
pretended to have a knack at hitting off
characters, he blundered strangely in the
distribution of his favours, which were
generally bestowed on the most undeserv∣ing
of those who had recourse to his assist∣ance;
that, indeed, this preference was
not so much owing to want of discern∣ment
as to want of resolution, for he had
not fortitude enough to resist the impor∣tunity
even of the most worthless; and,
as he did not know the value of money,
there was very little merit in parting with
it so easily; that his pride was gratified in
seeing himself courted by such a number
of literary dependants; that, probably,
he delighted in hearing them expose and
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
traduce one another; and, finally, from
their information, he became acquainted
with all the transactions of Grub-street,
which he had some thoughts of compiling,
for the entertainment of the public.</P>
<P>I could not help suspecting, from Dick's
discourse, that he had some particular
grudge against S—, upon whose con∣duct
he had put the worst construction it
would bear; and, by dint of cross-exa∣mination,
I found he was not at all satis∣fied
with the character which had been
given in the Review of his last perfor∣mance,
though it had been treated civilly,
in consequence of the author's application
to the critic. By all accounts, S—is
not without weakness and caprice; but
he is certainly good-humoured and civi∣lized;
nor do I find, that there is any
thing over-bearing, cruel, or implacable
in his disposition.</P>
<P>I have dwelt so long upon authors,
that you will perhaps suspect I intend to
enroll myself among the fraternity; but,
if I were actually qualified for the profes∣sion,
it is at best but a desperate resource
against starving, as it affords no provision
for old age and infirmity. Salmon, at
the age of fourscore, is now in a garret,
compiling matter, at a guinea a sheet for
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
a modern historian, who, in point of age,
might be his grand-child; and Psalmo∣nazar,
after having drudged half a century
in the literary mill, in all the simplicity and
abstinence of an Asiatic, subsists upon the
charity of a few booksellers, just sufficient
to keep him from the parish—I think
Guy, who was himself a bookseller,
ought to have appropriated one wing or
ward of his hospital to the use of decayed
authors; though, indeed, there is nei∣ther
hospital, college, nor work-house,
within the bills of mortality, large enough
to contain the poor of this society, com∣posed,
as it is, from the refuse of every
other profession.</P>

<LETTER>
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
<OPENER>To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.
MY DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>THERE is something on my spirits,
which I should not venture to communi∣cate
by the post, but having the oppor∣tunity
of Mrs. Brentwood's return, I seize
it eagerly, to disburthen my poor heart,
which is oppressed with fear and vexation.
—O Letty! what a miserable situation it
is, to be without a friend to whom one
can apply for counsel and consolation in
distress! I hinted in my last, that one
Mr. Barton had been very particular in
his civilities: I can no longer mistake his
meaning—he has formally professed him∣self
my admirer; and, after a thousand
assiduities, perceiving I made but a cold
return to his addresses, he had recourse
to the mediation of lady Griskin, who has
acted the part of a very warm advocate in
his behalf:—but, my dear Willis, her
ladyship over-acts her part—she not only
expatiates on the ample fortune, the great
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
connexions, and the unblemished charac∣ter
of Mr. Barton, but she takes the trou∣ble
to catechise me; and, two days ago,
peremptorily told me, that a girl of my
age could not possibly resist so many con∣siderations,
if her heart was not pre-en∣gaged.</P>
<P>This insinuation threw me into such a
flutter, that she could not but observe
my disorder; and, presuming upon the
discovery, insisted upon my making her
the confidante of my passion. But, al∣though
I had not such command of my∣self
as to conceal the emotion of my
heart, I am not such a child as to disclose
its secrets to a person who would certainly
use them to its prejudice. I told her, it
was no wonder if I was out of counte∣nance
at her introducing a subject of con∣versation
so unsuitable to my years and
inexperience; that I believed Mr. Barton
was a very worthy gentleman, and I was
much obliged to him for his good opi∣nion;
but the affections were involuntary,
and mine, in particular, had as yet made
no concessions in his favour. She shook
her head with an air of distrust that made
me tremble; and observed, that if my af∣fections
were free, they would submit to
the decision of prudence, especially when
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
enforced by the authority of those who
had a right to direct my conduct. This
remark implied a design to interest my
uncle or my aunt, perhaps my brother,
in behalf of Mr. Barton's passion; and I
am sadly afraid that my aunt is already
gained over. Yesterday in the forenoon,
he had been walking with us in the Park,
and stopping in our return at a toy-shop,
he presented her with a very fine snuff∣box,
and me with a gold etuis, which I
resolutely refused, till she commanded
me to accept it on pain of her displea∣sure:
nevertheless, being still unsatisfied
with respect to the propriety of receiving
this toy, I signified my doubts to my
brother, who said he would consult my
uncle on the subject, and seemed to think
Mr. Barton had been rather premature in
his presents.</P>
<P>What will be the result of this consul∣tation,
Heaven knows; but I am afraid
it will produce an explanation with Mr.
Barton, who will, no doubt, avow his
passion, and sollicit their consent to a
connexion which my soul abhors; for,
my dearest Letty, it is not in my power to
love Mr. Barton, even if my heart was
untouched by any other tenderness. Not
that there is any thing disagreeable about
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
his person, but there is a total want of
that nameless charm which captivates and
controuls the inchanted spirit—at least,
he appears to me to have this defect; but
if he had all the engaging qualifications
which a man can possess, they would be
excited in vain against that constancy,
which, I flatter myself, is the characteristic
of my nature. No, my dear Willis, I may
be involved in fresh troubles, and I be∣lieve
I shall, from the importunities of this
gentleman and the violence of my re∣lations;
but my heart is incapable of
change.</P>
<P>You know, I put no faith in dreams;
and yet I have been much disturbed by
one that visited me last night.—I thought
I was in a church, where a certain person,
whom you know, was on the point of be∣ing
married to my aunt; that the clergy∣man
was Mr. Barton, and that poor for∣lorn
I stood weeping in a corner, half
naked, and without shoes or stockings.—
Now, I know there is nothing so childish
as to be moved by those vain illusions;
but, nevertheless, in spite of all my rea∣son,
this hath made a strong impression
upon my mind, which begins to be very
gloomy. Indeed, I have another more
substantial cause of affliction—I have some
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
religious scruples, my dear friend, which
lie heavy on my conscience.—I was per∣suaded
to go to the Tabernacle, where I
heard a discourse that affected me deeply.
—I have prayed fervently to be enlighten∣ed,
but as yet I am not sensible of these
inward motions, those operations of grace,
which are the signs of a regenerated spirit;
and therefore I begin to be in terrible
apprehensions about the state of my poor
soul. Some of our family have had very
uncommon accessions, particularly my
aunt and Mrs. Jenkins, who sometimes
speak as if they were really inspired; so
that I am not like to want for either ex∣hortation
or example, to purify my
thoughts, and recall them from the vani∣ties
of this world, which, indeed, I would
willingly resign, if it was in my power;
but to make this sacrifice, I must be en∣abled
by such assistance from above as hath
not yet been indulged to</P>

<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>THE moment I received your letter, I
began to execute your commission—With
the assistance of mine host at the Bull and
Gate, I discovered the place to which
your fugitive valet had retreated, and
taxed him with his dishonesty—The fel∣low
was in manifest confusion at sight of
me, but he denied the charge with great
confidence, till I told him, that if he
would give up the watch, which was a
family piece, he might keep the money
and the clothes, and go to the devil his
own way, at his leisure; but if he reject∣ed
this proposal, I would deliver him
forthwith to the constable, whom I had
provided for that purpose, and he would
carry him before the justice without fur∣ther
delay. After some hesitation, he
desired to speak with me in the next room,
where he produced the watch, with all
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
its appendages, and I have delivered it to
our landlord, to be sent you by the first
safe conveyance—So much for busi∣ness.</P>
<P>I shall grow vain, upon your saying you
find entertainment in my letters; barren,
as they certainly are, of incident and im∣portance,
because your amusement must
arise, not from the matter, but from the
manner, which you know is all my own
—Animated, therefore, by the approba∣tion
of a person, whose nice taste and
consummate judgment I can no longer
doubt, I will chearfully proceed with our
memoirs—As it is determined we shall
set out next week for Yorkshire, I went
to-day in the forenoon with my uncle to
see a carriage, belonging to a coach∣maker
in our neighbourhood—Turning
down a narrow lane, behind Longacre,
we perceived a crowd of people standing
at a door; which, it seems, opened into
a kind of a methodist meeting, and were
informed, that a footman was then hold∣ing
forth to the congregation within.
Curious to see this phoenomenon, we
squeezed into the place with much diffi∣culty;
and who should this preacher be,
but the identical Humphry Clinker. He
had finished his sermon, and given out a
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
psalm, the first stave of which he sung
with peculiar graces—But if we were
astonished to see Clinker in the pulpit,
we were altogether confounded at find∣ing
all the females of our family among
the audience—There was lady Griskin,
Mrs. Tabitha Bramble, Mrs. Winifred
Jenkins, my sister Liddy, and Mr. Bar∣ton,
and all of them joined in the psal∣mody,
with strong marks of devotion.</P>
<P>I could hardly keep my gravity on this
ludicrous occasion; but old Square-toes
was differently affected—The first thing
that struck him, was the presumption of
his lacquey, whom he commanded to
come down, with such an air of autho∣rity
as Humphry did not think proper
to disregard. He descended immediate∣ly,
and all the people were in commo∣tion.
Barton looked exceedingly sheep∣ish,
lady Griskin flirted her fan, Mrs.
Tabby groaned in spirit, Liddy changed
countenance, and Mrs. Jenkins sobbed
as if her heart was breaking—My uncle,
with a sneer, asked pardon of the ladies,
for having interrupted their devotion,
saying, he had particular business with
the preacher, whom he ordered to call a
hackney-coach. This being immediately
brought up to the end of the lane, he
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
handed Liddy into it, and my aunt and
I following him, we drove home, with∣out
taking any further notice of the rest
of the company, who still remained in
silent astonishment.</P>
<P>Mr. Bramble, perceiving Liddy in great
trepidation, assumed a milder aspect, bid∣ding
her be under no concern, for he was
not at all displeased at any thing she had
done—“I have no objection (said he) to
your being religiously inclined; but I
don't think my servant is a proper
ghostly director, for a devotee of your
sex and character—if, in fact, (as I
rather believe) your aunt is not the sole
conductress of this machine—” Mrs.
Tabitha made no answer, but threw up
the whites of her eyes, as if in the act of
ejaculation—Poor Liddy said she had
no right to the title of a devotee; that she
thought there was no harm in hearing a
pious discourse, even if it came from a
footman, especially as her aunt was pre∣sent;
but that if she had erred from ig∣norance,
she hoped he would excuse it,
as she could not bear the thoughts of liv∣ing
under his displeasure. The old gen∣tleman,
pressing her hand with a tender
smile, said she was a good girl, and that
he did not believe her capable of doing
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
any thing that could give him the least
umbrage or disgust.</P>
<P>When we arrived at our lodgings, he
commanded Mr. Clinker to attend him
up stairs; and spoke to him in these
words—“Since you are called upon by
the spirit to preach and to teach, it is
high time to lay aside the livery of an
earthly master; and, for my part, I
am unworthy to have an apostle in my
service—” “I hope (said Humphry)
I have not failed in my duty to your
honour—I should be a vile wretch if I
did, considering the misery from which
your charity and compassion relieved
me—but having an inward admonition
of the spirit—” “An admonition
of the devil—(cried the 'squire, in a
passion) What admonition, you block∣head?—What
right has such a fellow
as you to set up for a reformer?”
“Begging your honour's pardon, (re∣plied
Clinker) may not the new light
of God's grace shine upon the poor
and the ignorant in their humility, as
well as upon the wealthy, and the phi∣losopher
in all his pride of human
learning?” “What you imagine to be
the new light of grace, (said his ma∣ster)
I take to be a deceitful vapour,
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
glimmering through a crack in your
upper story—In a word, Mr. Clinker,
I will have no light in my family but
what pays the king's taxes, unless it
be the light of reason, which you don't
pretend to follow.”</P>
<P>“Ah, sir! (cried Humphry) the light
of reason, is no more in comparison to
the light I mean, than a farthing can∣dle
to the sun at noon—” “Very true,
(said uncle) the one will serve to shew
you your way, and the other to daz∣zle
and confound your weak brain—
Heark-ye, Clinker, you are either an
hypocritical knave, or a wrong-head∣ed
enthusiast; and, in either case, un∣fit
for my service—If you are a quack
in sanctity and devotion, you will
find it an easy matter to impose upon
silly women, and others of crazed un∣derstanding,
who will contribute la∣vishly
for your support—if you are re∣ally
seduced by the reveries of a di∣sturbed
imagination, the sooner you
lose your senses entirely, the better for
yourself and the community. In that
case, some charitable person might
provide you with a dark room and
clean straw in Bedlam, where it would
not be in your power to infect others
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
with your fanaticism; whereas, if you
have just reflection enough left to
maintain the character of a chosen ves∣sel
in the meetings of the godly, you
and your hearers will be misled by a
Will-i'the-wisp, from one error into
another, till you are plunged into re∣ligious
frenzy; and then, perhaps, you
will hang yourself in despair—”
“Which the Lord of his infinite mercy
forbid! (exclaimed the affrighted Clin∣ker)
It is very possible I may be under
the temptation of the devil, who wants
to wreck me on the rocks of spiritual
pride—Your honour says, I am either
a knave or a madman; now, as I'll
assure your honour I am no knave,
it follows that I must be mad; there∣fore,
I beseech your honour, upon my
knees, to take my case into considera∣tion,
that means may be used for my
recovery—”</P>
<P>The 'squire could not help smiling at
the poor fellow's simplicity, and pro∣mised
to take care of him, provided he
would mind the business of his place,
without running after the new-light of
methodism: but Mrs. Tabitha took of∣fence
at his humility, which she inter∣preted
into poorness of spirit and world∣ly
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
mindedness—She upbraided him with
the want of courage to suffer for con∣science-sake—She
observed, that if he
should lose his place for bearing testi∣mony
to the truth, Providence would not
fail to find him another, perhaps more
advantageous; and, declaring that it
could not be very agreeable to live in a
family where an inquisition was establish∣ed,
retired to another room in great agi∣tation.</P>
<P>My uncle followed her with a signifi∣cant
look, then, turning to the preacher,
“You hear what my sister says—If you
cannot live with me upon such terms
as I have prescribed, the vineyard of
methodism lies before you, and she
seems very well disposed to reward
your labour—” “I would not will∣ingly
give offence to any soul upon
earth (answered Humphry); her lady∣ship
has been very good to me, ever
since we came to London; and surely
she has a heart turned for religious
exercises; and both she and lady Gris∣kin
sing psalms and hymns like two
cherubims—But, at the same time,
I'm bound to love and obey your ho∣nour—It
becometh not such a poor
ignorant fellow as me, to hold dis∣pute
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
with gentlemen of rank and learn∣ing—As
for the matter of knowledge,
I am no more than a beast in compa∣rison
of your honour; therefore I sub∣mit;
and, with God's grace, I will
follow you to the world's end, if you
don't think me too far gone to be out
of consinement—”</P>
<P>His master promised to keep him for
some time longer on trial; then desired
to know in what manner lady Griskin and
Mr. Barton came to join their religious
society. He told him, that her ladyship
was the person who first carried my aunt
and sister to the Tabernacle, whither he
attended them, and had his devotion
kindled by Mr. W—'s preaching: that
he was confirmed in this new way, by the
preacher's sermons, which he had bought
and studied with great attention: that
his discourse and prayers had brought
over Mrs. Jenkins and the house-maid to
the same way of thinking; but as for Mr.
Barton, he had never seen him at service
before this day, when he came in com∣pany
with lady Griskin—Humphry,
moreover, owned that he had been en∣couraged
to mount the rostrum, by the
example and success of a weaver, who
was much followed as a powerful mini∣ster:
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
that on his first trial, he found him∣self
under such strong impulsions, as
made him believe he was certainly moved
by the spirit; and that he had assisted in
lady Griskin's, and several private houses,
at exercises of devotion.</P>
<P>Mr. Bramble was no sooner informed,
that her ladyship had acted as the primum
mobile of this confederacy, than he con∣cluded
she had only made use of Clinker
as a tool, subservient to the execution of
some design, to the true secret of which
he was an utter stranger—He observed,
that her ladyship's brain was a perfect
mill for projects; and that she and Tab∣by
had certainly engaged in some secret
treaty, the nature of which he could not
comprehend. I told him I thought it was
no difficult matter to perceive the drift
of Mrs. Tabitha, which was to ensnare
the heart of Barton, and that in all like∣lihood
my lady Griskin acted as her auxi∣liary:
that this supposition would account
for their endeavours to convert him to
methodism; an event which would occa∣sion
a connexion of souls that might be
easily improved into a matrimonial
union.</P>
<P>My uncle seemed to be much divert∣ed
by the thoughts of this scheme's
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
succeeding; but I gave him to under∣stand,
that Barton was pre-engaged: that
he had the day before made a present of
an etuis to Liddy, which her aunt had
obliged her to receive, with a view, no
doubt, to countenance her own accept∣ing
of a snuff-box at the same time: that
my sister having made me acquainted
with this incident, I had desired an ex∣planation
of Mr. Barton, who declared
his intentions were honourable, and ex∣pressed
his hope that I would have no ob∣jections
to his alliance: that I had thank∣ed
him for the honour he intended our
family; but told him, it would be ne∣cessary
to consult her uncle and aunt,
who were her guardians: and their appro∣bation
being obtained, I could have no
objection to his proposal; though I was
persuaded that no violence would be of∣fered
to my sister's inclinations, in a
transaction that so nearly interested the
happiness of her future life: that he had
assured me, he should never think of a∣vailing
himself of a guardian's authority,
unless he could render his addresses agree∣able
to the young lady herself; and that
he would immediately demand permission
of Mr. and Miss Bramble, to make Liddy
a tender of his hand and fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54"/>
The 'squire was not insensible to the
advantages of such a match, and declared
he would promote it with all his in∣fluence;
but when I took notice that
there seemed to be an aversion on the
side of Liddy, he said he would sound
her on the subject; and if her reluctance
was such as would not be easily overcome,
he would civilly decline the proposal of
Mr. Barton; for he thought that, in the
choice of a husband, a young woman
ought not to sacrifice the feelings of her
heart for any consideration upon earth—
“Liddy is not so desperate (said he)
as to worship fortune at such an ex∣pence.”
I take it for granted, this whole
affair will end in smoke; though there
seems to be a storm brewing in the quar∣ter
of Mrs. Tabby, who sat with all the
sullen dignity of silence at dinner, seem∣ingly
pregnant with complaint and ex∣postulation.
As she hath certainly mark∣ed
Barton for her own prey, she cannot
possibly favour his suit to Liddy; and
therefore I expect something extraordi∣nary
will attend his declaring himself my
sister's admirer. This declaration will
certainly be made in form, as soon as the
lover can pick up resolution enough to
stand the brunt of Mrs. Tabby's disap∣pointment;
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
for he is, without doubt,
aware of her designs upon his person—

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>THE deceitful calm was of short du∣ration.
I am plunged again in a sea of
vexation, and the complaints in my
stomach and bowels are returned; so
that I suppose I shall be disabled from
prosecuting the excursion I had planned
—What the devil had I to do, to come
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plague hunting with a leash of females
in my train? Yesterday my precious sister
(who, by the bye, has been for some time
a professed methodist) came into my a∣partment,
attended by Mr. Barton, and
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
desired an audience with a very stately
air—“Brother, (said she) this gentle∣man
has something to propose, which
I flatter myself will be the more accept∣able,
as it will rid you of a trouble∣some
companion.” Then Mr. Barton
proceeded to this effect—“I am, indeed,
extremely ambitious of being allied to
your family, Mr. Bramble, and I hope
you will see no cause to interpose your
authority.” “As for authority, (said
Tabby, interrupting him with some
warmth) I know of none that he has
a right to use on this occasion—If I
pay him the compliment of making
him acquainted with the step I intend
to take, it is all he can expect in rea∣son—This
is as much as I believe he
would do by me, if he intended to
change his own situation in life—In a
word, brother, I am so sensible of Mr.
Barton's extraordinary merit, that I
have been prevailed upon to alter my
resolution of living a single life, and to
put my happiness in his hands, by
vesting him with a legal title to my
person and fortune, such as they are.
The business at present, is to have the
writings drawn; and I shall be obli∣ged
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
to you, if you will recommend a
lawyer to me for that purpose—”</P>
<P>You may guess what an effect this
overture had upon me; who, from the
information of my nephew, expected that
Barton was to make a formal declaration
of his passion for Liddy; I could not help
gazing in silent astonishment, alternately
at Tabby, and her supposed admirer,
which last hung his head in the most auk∣ward
confusion for a few minutes, and
then retired on pretence of being sudden∣ly
seized with a vertigo—Mrs. Tabitha
affected much concern, and would have
had him make use of a bed in the house;
but he insisted upon going home, that he
might have recourse to some drops, which
he kept for such emergencies, and his in∣namorata
acquiesced—In the mean time I
was exceedingly puzzled at this adven∣ture,
(though I suspected the truth) and
did not know in what manner to demean
myself towards Mrs. Tabitha, when Jery
came in and told me, he had just seen Mr.
Barton alight from his chariot at lady
Griskin's door—This incident seemed to
threaten a visit from her ladyship, with
which we were honoured accordingly, in
less than half an hour—“I find (said she)
there has been a match of cross pur∣poses
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
among you good folks; and I'm
come to set you to rights—” So say∣ing,
she presented me with the follow∣ing
billet—</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“Dear Sir,</OPENER>
<P>I no sooner recollected myself from
the extreme confusion I was thrown in∣to,
by that unlucky mistake of your
sister, than I thought it my duty to
assure you, that my devoirs to Mrs.
Bramble never exceeded the bounds of
ordinary civility; and that my heart is
unalterably fixed upon miss Liddy
Melford, as I had the honour to de∣clare
to her brother, when he question∣ed
me upon that subject—Lady Griskin
has been so good as to charge herself,
not only with the delivery of this note,
but also with the task of undeceiving
Mrs. Bramble, for whom I have the
most profound respect and veneration,
though my affection being otherwise
engaged, is no longer in the power
of</P>
<CLOSER>Sir,
your very humble servant,
<SIGNED>RALPH BARTON.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59"/>
Having cast my eyes over this billet, I
told her ladyship, that I would no lon∣ger
retard the friendly office she had un∣dertaken;
and I and Jery forthwith re∣tired
into another room. There we soon
perceived the conversation grow very
warm betwixt the two ladies; and, at
length, could distinctly hear certain terms
of altercation, which we could no longer
delay interrupting, with any regard to de∣corum.
When we entered the scene of
contention, we found Liddy had joined
the disputants, and stood trembling be∣twixt
them, as if she had been afraid they
would have proceeded to something more
practical than words—Lady Griskin's
face was like the full moon in a storm of
wind, glaring, fiery, and portentuous;
while Tabby looked grim and ghastly,
with an aspect breathing discord and dis∣may.—Our
appearance put a stop to their
mutual revilings; but her ladyship turn∣ing
to me, “Cousin, (said she) I can't
help saying I have met with a very un∣grateful
return from this lady, for the
pains I have taken to serve her fami∣ly—”
“My family is much obliged
to your ladyship (cried Tabby, with a
kind of hysterical giggle); but we
have no right to the good offices of
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
such an honourable go-between.”
“But, for all that, good Mrs. Tabitha
Bramble, (resumed the other) I shall
be content with the reflection, That
virtue is its own reward; and it shall
not be my fault, if you continue to
make yourself ridiculous—Mr. Bram∣ble,
who has no little interest of his
own to serve, will, no doubt, contri∣bute
all in his power to promote a
match betwixt Mr. Barton and his
niece, which will be equally honour∣able
and advantageous; and, I dare
say, miss Liddy herself will have no
objection to a measure so well calcu∣lated
to make her happy in life—”
“I beg your ladyship's pardon, (exclaim∣ed
Liddy, with great vivacity) I have
nothing but misery to expect from such
a measure; and I hope my guardians
will have too much compassion, to bar∣ter
my peace of mind for any conside∣ration
of interest or fortune—” “Up∣on
my word, miss Liddy! (said she)
you have profited by the example of
your good aunt—I comprehend your
meaning, and will explain it when I
have a proper opportunity—In the
mean time, I shall take my leave—
Madam, your most obedient, and de∣voted
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
humble servant.” said she, ad∣vancing
close up to my sister, and curtsy∣ing
so low, that I thought she intended to
squat herself down on the floor—This
salutation Tabby returned with equal so∣lemnity;
and the expression of the two
faces, while they continued in this atti∣tude,
would be no bad subject for a pen∣cil
like that of the incomparable Ho∣garth,
if any such should ever appear
again, in these times of dulness and de∣generacy.</P>
<P>Jery accompanied her ladyship to her
house, that he might have an opportu∣nity
to restore the etuis to Barton, and
advise him to give up his suit, which
was so disagreeable to his sister, against
whom, however, he returned much irri∣tated—Lady
Griskin had assured him that
Liddy's heart was pre-occupied; and im∣mediately
the idea of Wilson recurring to
his imagination, his family-pride took the
alarm—He denounced vengeance against
that adventurer, and was disposed to be
very peremptory with his sister; but I
desired he would suppress his resentment,
until I should have talked with her in
private.</P>
<P>The poor girl, when I earnestly press∣ed
her on this head, owned, with a flood
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
of tears, that Wilson had actually come
to the Hot Well at Bristol, and even in∣troduced
himself into our lodgings as a
Jew pedlar; but that nothing had passed
betwixt them, further than her begging
him to withdraw immediately, if he had
any regard for her peace of mind: that
he had disappeared accordingly, after
having attempted to prevail upon my
sister's maid, to deliver a letter; which,
however, she refused to receive, though
she had consented to carry a message, im∣porting
that he was a gentleman of a good
family; and that, in a very little time, he
would avow his passion in that character
—She confessed, that although he had
not kept his word in this particular, he
was not yet altogether indifferent to her
affection; but solemnly promised, she
would never carry on any correspondence
with him, or any other admirer, for the
future, without the privity and approba∣tion
of her brother and me.</P>
<P>By this declaration, she made her own
peace with Jery; but the hot-headed boy
is more than ever incensed against Wil∣son,
whom he now considers as an im∣postor,
that harbours some infamous de∣sign
upon the honour of his family—As
for Barton, he was not a little mortified
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
to find his present returned, and his ad∣dresses
so unfavourably received; but he
is not a man to be deeply affected by such
disappointments; and I know not whe∣ther
he is not as well pleased with being
discarded by Liddy, as he would have
been with a permission to prosecute his
pretensions, at the risque of being every
day exposed to the revenge or machina∣tions
of Tabby, who is not to be slighted
with impunity.—I had not much time
to moralize on these occurrences; for the
house was visited by a constable and his
gang, with a warrant from justice Buz∣zard,
to search the box of Humphry
Clinker, my footman, who was just ap∣prehended
as a highwayman—This inci∣dent
threw the whole family into confu∣sion.
My sister scolded the constable for
presuming to enter the lodgings of a gen∣tleman
on such an errand, without having
first asked, and obtained permission; her
maid was frightened into fits, and Lid∣dy
shed tears of compassion for the un∣fortunate
Clinker, in whose box, how∣ever,
nothing was found to confirm the
suspicion of robbery.</P>
<P>For my own part, I made no doubt of
the fellow's being mistaken for some
other person, and I went directly to
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
the justice, in order to procure his dis∣charge;
but there I found the matter
much more serious than I expected—Poor
Clinker stood trembling at the bar, sur∣rounded
by thief-takers; and at a little
distance, a thick, squat fellow, a posti∣lion,
his accuser, who had seized him in
the street, and swore positively to his per∣son,
that the said Clinker had, on the
15th day of March last, on Blackheath,
robbed a gentleman in a post-chaise,
which he (the postilion) drove—This de∣position
was sufficient to justify his com∣mitment;
and he was sent accordingly to
Clerkenwell prison, whither Jery accom∣panied
him in the coach, in order to re∣commend
him properly to the keeper,
that he may want for no convenience
which the place affords.</P>
<P>The spectators, who assembled to see
this highwayman, were sagacious enough
to discern something very villanous in his
aspect; which (begging their pardon) is
the very picture of simplicity; and the
justice himself put a very unfavourable
construction upon some of his answers,
which, he said, savoured of the ambi∣guity
and equivocation of an old offender;
but, in my opinion, it would have been
more just and humane to impute them
to the confusion into which we may sup∣pose
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
a poor country lad to be thrown on
such an occasion. I am still persuaded he
is innocent; and, in this persuasion, I can
do no less than use my utmost endeavours
that he may not be oppressed—I shall, to∣morrow,
send my nephew to wait on the
gentleman who was robbed, and beg he
will have the humanity to go and see the
prisoner; that, in case he should find him
quite different from the person of the
highwayman, he may bear testimony in
his behalf—Howsoever it may fare with
Clinker, this cursed affair will be to me
productive of intolerable chagrin—I have
already caught a dreadful cold, by rush∣ing
into the open air from the justice's
parlour, where I had been stewing in the
crowd; and though I should not be laid
up with the gout, as I believe I shall, I
must stay at London for some weeks, till
this poor devil comes to his trial at Ro∣chester;
so that, in all probability, my
Northern expedition is blown up.</P>
<P>If you can find any thing in your phi∣losophical
budget, to console me in the
midst of these distresses and apprehen∣sions,
pray let it be communicated to</P>

<LETTER>
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR WAT,</OPENER>
<P>THE farce is finished, and another
piece of a graver cast brought upon
the stage.—Our aunt made a desperate
attack upon Barton, who had no other
way of saving himself, but by leaving her
in possession of the field, and avowing his
pretensions to Liddy, by whom he has been
rejected in his turn.—Lady Griskin acted
as his advocate and agent on this occasion,
with such zeal as embroiled her with Mrs.
Tabitha, and a high scene of altercation
passed betwixt these two religionists,
which might have come to action, had
not my uncle interposed. They are how∣ever
reconciled, in consequence of an
event which hath involved us all in trou∣ble
and disquiet. You must know, the
poor preacher, Humphry Clinker, is now
exercising his ministry among the felons
in Clerkenwell prison.—A postilion hav∣ing
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
sworn a robbery against him, no bail
could be taken, and he was committed to
jail, notwithstanding all the remonstrances
and interest my uncle could make in his
behalf.</P>
<P>All things considered, the poor fellow
cannot possibly be guilty, and yet, I be∣lieve,
he runs some risque of being hang∣ed.—Upon
his examination, he answered
with such hesitation and reserve, as per∣suaded
most of the people, who crowded
the place, that he was really a knave, and
the justice's remarks confirmed their opi∣nion.
Exclusive of my uncle and myself,
there was only one person who seemed in∣clined
to favour the culprit.—He was
a young man, well dressed, and, from
the manner in which he cross-examined
the evidence, we took it for granted,
that he was a student in one of the
inns of court.—He freely checked the
justice for some uncharitable inferences he
made to the prejudice of the prisoner,
and even ventured to dispute with his
worship on certain points of law.</P>
<P>My uncle, provoked at the uncon∣nected
and dubious answers of Clinker,
who seemed in danger of falling a sacri∣fice
to his own simplicity, exclaimed, “In
the name of God, if you are innocent,
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
say so.” “No, (cried he) God forbid,
that I should call myself innocent, while
my conscience is burthened with sin.”
“What then, you did commit this rob∣bery?”
resumed his master. “No,
sure, (said he) blessed be the Lord,
I'm free of that guilt.”</P>
<P>Here the justice interposed, observing,
that the man seemed inclined to make a
discovery by turning king's evidence, and
desired the clerk to take his confession;
upon which Humphry declared, that he
looked upon confession to be a popish
fraud, invented by the whore of Babylon.
The Templar affirmed, that the poor fel∣low
was <HI>non compos;</HI> and exhorted the
justice to discharge him as a lunatic.—
“You know very well, (added he) that
the robbery in question was not com∣mitted
by the prisoner.”</P>
<P>The thief-takers grinned at one an∣other;
and Mr. Justice Buzzard replied
with great emotion, “Mr. Martin, I desire
you will mind your own business; I
shall convince you one of these days
that I understand mine.” In short,
there was no remedy; the mittimus was
made out, and poor Clinker sent to prison
in a hackney-coach, guarded by the con∣stable,
and accompanied by your humble
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
servant. By the way, I was not a little
surprised to hear this retainer to justice
bid the prisoner to keep up his spirits,
for that he did not at all doubt, but that
he would get off for a few weeks confine∣ment.—He
said, his worship knew very
well that Clinker was innocent of the fact,
and that the real highwayman, who rob∣bed
the chaise, was no other than that
very individual Mr. Martin, who had
pleaded so strenuously for honest Hum∣phry.</P>
<P>Confounded at this information, I ask∣ed,
“Why then is he suffered to go
about at his liberty, and this poor
innocent fellow treated as a malefac∣tor?”
“We have exact intelligence
of all Mr. Martin's transactions; (said
he) but as yet there is not evidence
sufficient for his conviction; and as for
this young man, the justice could do
no less than commit him, as the posti∣lion
swore point-blank to his identity.”
“So if this rascally postilion should per∣sist
in the falsity to which he is sworn,
(said I) this innocent lad may be brought
to the gallows.”</P>
<P>The constable observed, that he would
have time enough to prepare for his trial,
and might prove an <HI>alibi;</HI> or, perhaps,
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
Martin might be apprehended and con∣victed
for another fact; in which case,
he might be prevailed upon to take this
affair upon himself; or, finally, if these
chances should fail, and the evidence
stand good against Clinker, the jury
might recommend him to mercy, in con∣sideration
of his youth, especially if this
should appear to be the first fact of which
he had been guilty.</P>
<P>Humphry owned, he could not pretend
to recollect where he had been on the
day when the robbery was committed,
much less prove a circumstance of that
kind so far back as six months, though he
knew he had been sick of the fever and
ague, which, however, did not prevent
him from going about—then, turning up
his eyes, he ejaculated, “The Lord's will
be done! if it be my fate to suffer, I
hope I shall not disgrace the faith, of
which, though unworthy, I make pro∣fession.”</P>
<P>When I expressed my surprize, that
the accuser should persist in charging
Clinker, without taking the least notice
of the real robber, who stood before him,
and to whom, indeed, Humphry bore not
the smallest resemblance; the constable
(who was himself a thief-taker) gave me
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
to understand, that Mr. Martin was the
best qualified for business of all the gentle∣men
on the road he had ever known;
that he had always acted on his own bot∣tom,
without partner or correspondent,
and never went to work, but when he
was cool and sober; that his courage and
presence of mind never failed him; that
his address was genteel, and his behaviour
void of all cruelty and insolence; that he
never encumbered himself with watches or
trinkets, nor even with bank-notes, but
always dealt for ready money, and that in
the current coin of the kingdom; and
that he could disguise himself and his
horse in such a manner, that, after the ac∣tion,
it was impossible to recognize either
the one or the other—“This great man
(said he) has reigned paramount in all
the roads within fifty miles of London
above fifteen months, and has done
more business in that time, than all
the rest of the profession put together;
for those who pass through his hands
are so delicately dealt with, that they
have no desire to give him the least dis∣turbance;
but for all that, his race is
almost run—he is now fluttering about
justice, like a moth about a candle—
there are so many lime-twigs laid in his
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
way, that I'll bett a cool hundred, he
swings before Christmas.”</P>
<P>Shall I own to you, that this portrait,
drawn by a ruffian, heightened by what I
myself had observed in his deportment,
has interested me warmly in the fate of
poor Martin, whom nature seems to have
intended for a useful and honourable
member of that community upon which he
now preys for subsistence? It seems, he
lived some time as a clerk to a timber-merchant,
whose daughter Martin having
privately married, was discarded, and his
wife turned out of doors. She did not
long survive her marriage; and Martin,
turning fortune-hunter, could not supply
his occasions any other way, than by tak∣ing
to the road, in which he has travelled
hitherto with uncommon success.—He
pays his respects regularly to Mr. Justice
Buzzard, the thief-catcher-general of this
metropolis, and sometimes they smoke a
pipe together very lovingly, when the
conversation generally turns upon the na∣ture
of evidence.—The justice has given
him fair warning to take care of himself,
and he has received his caution in good
part.—Hitherto he has baffled all the vi∣gilance,
art, and activity of Buzzard and
his emissaries, with such conduct as would
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
have done honour to the genius of a
Caesar or a Turenne; but he has one
weakness, which has proved fatal to all
the heroes of his tribe, namely, an in∣discreet
devotion to the fair sex, and, in
all probability, he will be attacked on
this defenceless quarter.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, I saw the body of
poor Clinker consigned to the gaoler of
Clerkenwell, to whose indulgence I re∣commended
him so effectually, that he
received him in the most hospitable man∣ner,
though there was a necessity for
equipping him with a suit of irons, in
which he made a very rueful appearance.
The poor creature seemed as much affect∣ed
by my uncle's kindness, as by his own
misfortune. When I assured him, that
nothing should be left undone for pro∣curing
his enlargement, and making his
confinement easy in the mean time, he fell
down on his knees, and kissing my hand,
which he bathed with his tears, “O
'squire! (cried he, sobbing) what shall I
say?—I can't—no, I can't speak—my
poor heart is bursting with gratitude to
you and my dear—dear—generous—
noble benefactor.”</P>
<P>I protest, the scene became so pathetic,
that I was fain to force myself away, and
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
returned to my uncle, who sent me in the
afternoon with a compliment to one Mr.
Mead, the person who had been robbed
on Black-heath. As I did not find him
at home, I left a message, in consequence
of which he called at our lodgings this
morning, and very humanely agreed to
visit the prisoner. By this time, lady
Griskin had come to make her formal
compliments of condolance to Mrs. Tabi∣tha,
on this domestic calamity; and that
prudent maiden, whose passion was now
cooled, thought proper to receive her
ladyship so civilly, that a reconcilia∣tion
immediately ensued. These two
ladies resolved to comfort the poor
prisoner in their own persons, and Mr.
Mead and I 'squired them to Clerkenwell,
my uncle being detained at home by
some slight complaints in his stomach and
bowels.</P>
<P>The turnkey, who received us at Clerk∣enwell,
looked remarkably sullen; and
when we enquired for Clinker, “I don't
care, if the devil had him; (said he)
here has been nothing but canting and
praying since the fellow entered the
place.—Rabbit him! the tap will be
ruined—we han't sold a cask of beer,
nor a dozen of wine, since he paid his
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
gentlemen get drunk with
nothing but your damned religion.—
For my part, I believe as how your
man deals with the devil.—Two or
three as bold hearts as ever took the air
upon Hounslow, have been blubbering
all night; and if the fellow an't speedi∣ly
removed by Habeas Corpus, or
otherwise, I'll be damn'd if there's a
grain of true spirit left within these
walls—we shan't have a soul to do cre∣dit
to the place, or make his exit like a
true born Englishman—damn my eyes!
there will be nothing but snivelling in
the cart—we shall all die like so many
psalm singing weavers.”</P>
<P>In short, we found that Humphry was,
at that very instant, haranguing the fe∣lons
in the chapel; and that the gaoler's
wife and daughter, together with my
aunt's woman, Win Jenkins, and our
house-maid, were among the audience,
which we immediately joined. I never
saw any thing so strongly picturesque as
this congregation of felons clanking their
chains, in the midst of whom stood orator
Clinker, expatiating, in a transport of
fervor, on the torments of hell, denoun∣ced
in scripture against evil-doers, com∣prehending
murderers, robbers, thieves,
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
and whoremongers. The variety of at∣tention
exhibited in the faces of those
ragamuffins, formed a groupe that would
not have disgraced the pencil of a Ra∣phael.
In one, it denoted admiration;
in another, doubt; in a third, disdain;
in a fourth, contempt; in a fifth, terror;
in a sixth, derision; and in a seventh, in∣dignation.—As
for Mrs. Winifred Jen∣kin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,
she was in tears, overwhelmed with
sorrow; but whether for her own sins, or
the misfortune of Clinker, I cannot pre∣tend
to say. The other females seemed
to listen with a mixture of wonder and de∣votion.
The gaoler's wife declared he
was a saint in trouble, saying, she wished
from her heart, there was such another
good soul, like him, in every gaol in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>Mr. Mead, having earnestly surveyed
the preacher, declared his appearance
was so different from that of the person
who robbed him on Black-heath, that he
could freely make oath he was not the
man: but Humphry himself was by this
time pretty well rid of all apprehensions
of being hanged; for he had been the
night before solemnly tried and acquitted
by his fellow-prisoners, some of whom he
had already converted to methodism. He
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
now made proper acknowledgements for
the honour of our visit, and was permit∣ted
to kiss the hands of the ladies, who
assured him, he might depend upon their
friendship and protection. Lady Griskin,
in her great zeal, exhorted his fellow-pri∣soners
to profit by the precious opportu∣nity
of having such a saint in bonds among
them, and turn over a new leaf for the
benefit of their poor souls; and, that her
admonition might have the greater effect,
she reinforced it with her bounty.</P>
<P>While she and Mrs. Tabby returned in
the coach with the two maid-servants, I
waited on Mr. Mead to the house of jus∣tice
Buzzard, who, having heard his de∣claration,
said his oath could be of no
use at present, but that he would be a ma∣terial
evidence for the prisoner at his trial;
so that there seems to be no remedy but
patience for poor Clinker; and, indeed,
the same virtue, or medicine, will be ne∣cessary
for us all, the 'squire in parti∣cular,
who had set his heart upon his
excursion to the northward.</P>
<P>While we were visiting honest Hum∣phry
in Clerkenwell prison, my uncle re∣ceived
a much more extraordinary visit at
his own lodgings. Mr. Martin, of whom
I have made such honourable mention,
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
desired permission to pay him his respects,
and was admitted accordingly. He told
him, that having observed him, at Mr.
Buzzard's, a good deal disturbed by what
had happened to his servant, he had come
to assure him he had nothing to apprehend
for Clinker's life; for, if it was possible
that any jury could find him guilty upon
such evidence, he, Martin himself, would
produce in court a person, whose deposi∣tion
would bring him off clear as the sun
at noon.—Sure, the fellow would not be
so romantic as to take the robbery upon
himself!—He said, the postilion was an
infamous fellow, who had been a dabbler
in the same profession, and saved his life at
the Old Bailey by impeaching his compa∣nions;
that being now reduced to great
poverty, he had made this desperate push,
to swear away the life of an innocent
man, in hopes of having the reward upon
his conviction; but that he would find
himself miserably disappointed, for the
justice and his myrmidons were deter∣mined
to admit of no interloper in this
branch of business; and that he did not
at all doubt but that they would find
matter enough to shop the evidence him∣self
before the next gaol-delivery. He
affirmed, that all these circumstances were
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
well known to the justice; and that his
severity to Clinker was no other than a
hint to his master to make him a present
in private, as an acknowledgement of his
candour and humanity.</P>
<P>This hint, however, was so unpalat∣able
to Mr. Bramble, that he declared,
with great warmth, he would rather con∣fine
himself for life to London, which he
detested, than be at liberty to leave it
to-morrow, in consequence of encouraging
corruption in a magistrate. Hearing▪
however, how favourable Mr. Mead's
report had been for the prisoner, he is re∣solved
to take the advice of counsel in
what manner to proceed for his imme∣diate
enlargement. I make no doubt,
but that in a day or two this troublesome
business may be discussed; and in this
hope we are preparing for our journey.

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.</OPENER>
<P>THANK Heaven! dear Lewis, the
clouds are dispersed, and I have now the
clearest prospect of my summer campaign,
which, I hope, I shall be able to begin
to-morrow. I took the advice of coun∣sel,
with respect to the case of Clinker, in
whose favour a lucky incident has inter∣vened.
The fellow who accused him,
has had his own battery turned upon him∣self.—Two
days ago, he was apprehend∣ed
for a robbery on the highway, and
committed, on the evidence of an accom∣plice.
Clinker, having moved for a writ
of <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> was brought before the
lord chief justice, who, in consequence
of an affidavit of the gentleman who had
been robbed, importing that the said Clink∣er
was not the person who stopped him on
the highway, as well as in consideration of
the postilion's character and present cir∣cumstances,
was pleased to order, that my
servant should be admitted to bail, and
he has been discharged accordingly, to
the unspeakable satisfaction of our whole
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
family, to which he has recommended
himself in an extraordinary manner, not
only by his obliging deportment, but by
his talents of preaching, praying, and
singing psalms, which he has exercised
with such effect, that even Tabby respects
him as a chosen vessel. If there was any
thing like affectation or hypocrisy in this
excess of religion, I would not keep him
in my service; but, so far as I can ob∣serve,
the fellow's character is downright
simplicity, warmed with a kind of enthu∣siasm,
which renders him very susceptible
of gratitude and attachment to his bene∣factors.</P>
<P>As he is an excellent horseman, and
understands farriery, I have bought a
stout gelding for his use, that he may at∣tend
us on the road, and have an eye to
our cattle, in case the coachman should not
mind his business. My nephew, who is
to ride his own saddle horse, has taken,
upon trial, a servant just come from
abroad with his former master, sir Wil∣liam
Strollop, who vouches for his ho∣nesty.
The fellow, whose name is Dut∣ton,
seems to be a petit-maitre.—He has
got a smattering of French, bows, and
grins, and shrugs, and takes snuff <HI>a la
mode de France,</HI> but values himself chiefly
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
upon his skill and dexterity in hair-dres∣sing.—If
I am not much deceived by ap∣pearance,
he is, in all respects, the very
contrast of Humphry Clinker.</P>
<P>My sister has made up matters with
lady Griskin; though, I must own, I
should not have been sorry to see that
connexion entirely destroyed: but Tabby
is not of a disposition to forgive Barton,
who, I understand, is gone to his seat in
Berkshire for the summer season. I can∣not
help suspecting, that in the treaty of
peace, which has been lately ratified be∣twixt
those two females, it is stipulated,
that her ladyship shall use her best endea∣vours
to provide an agreeable help-mate
for our sister Tabitha, who seems to be
quite desperate in her matrimonial de∣signs.
Perhaps, the match-maker is to
have a valuable consideration in the way
of brokerage, which she will most cer∣tainly
deserve, if she can find any man in
his senses, who will yoke with Mrs. Bram∣ble
from motives of affection or interest.</P>
<P>I find my spirits and my health affect
each other reciprocally—that is to say,
every thing that discomposes my mind,
produces a correspondent disorder in my
body; and my bodily complaints are re∣markably
mitigated by those considera∣tions
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
that dissipate the clouds of mental
chagrin.—The imprisonment of Clinker
brought on those symptoms which I men∣tioned
in my last, and now they are va∣nished
at his discharge.—It must be own∣ed,
indeed, I took some of the tinc∣ture
of ginseng, prepared according to
your prescription, and found it exceeding∣ly
grateful to the stomach; but the pain
and sickness continued to return, after
short intervals, till the anxiety of my
mind was entirely removed, and then I
found myself perfectly at ease. We have
had fair weather these ten days, to the
astonishment of the Londoners, who think
it portentous. If you enjoy the same in∣dulgence
in Wales, I hope Barns has got
my hay made, and safe cocked, by this
time. As we shall be in motion for some
weeks, I cannot expect to hear from you
as usual; but I shall continue to write
from every place at which we make any
halt, that you may know our track, in case
it should be necessary to communicate any

<P>HAVING the occasion of my cousin

yards of green ribbon, and a sarment
upon the nothingness of good works,
which was preached in the Tabernacle;
and you will also receive a horn-buck for
Saul, whereby she may learn her letters;
for I'm much consarned about the state of
her poor sole—and what are all the pur∣suits
of this life to the consarns of that
immortal part?—What is life but a veil
of affliction? O Mary! the whole family
have been in such a constipation!—Mr.
Clinker has been in trouble, but the gates
of hell have not been able to prevail
again him.—His virtue is like poor
gould, seven times tried in the fire. He
was tuck up for a rubbery, and had be∣fore
gustass Busshard, who made his mit∣tamouse;
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
and the pore youth was sent to
prison upon the false oaf of a willian, that
wanted to sware his life away for the
looker of cain.</P>
<P>The 'squire did all in his power, but
could not prevent his being put in chains,
and confined among common manufac∣tors,
where he stud like an innocent
sheep in the midst of wolves and tygers.—
Lord knows, what mought have happened
to this pyehouse young man, if master
had not applied to Apias Korkus, who
lives with the ould bailiff, and is, they
say, five hundred years ould, (God bless
us!) and a congeror: but, if he be, sure
I am he don't deal with the devil, other∣wise
he wouldn't have sought out Mr.
Clinker, as he did, in spite of stone walls,
iron bolts, and double locks, that flew
open at his command; for Ould Scratch
has not a greater enemy upon hearth than
Mr. Clinker, who is, indeed, a very
powerfull labourer in the Lord's vine∣yard.
I do no more than yuse the words
of my good lady, who has got the infec∣tual
calling; and, I trust, that even my∣self,
though unworthy, shall find grease
to be excepted.—Miss Liddy has been
touch'd to the quick, but is a little timor∣some:
howsomever, I make no doubt,
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
but she, and all of us, will be brought,
by the endeavours of Mr. Clinker, to
produce blessed fruit of generation and
repentance.—As for master and the
young 'squire, they have as yet had narro
glimpse of the new light.—I doubt as
how their harts are hardened by worldly
wisdom, which, as the pyebill saith, is
foolishness in the sight of God.</P>

<P>I CAN'T help thinking it very

from Bath, concerning the sour bear,
the gander, and the maids eating butter,
which I won't allow to be wasted.—
We are now going upon a long gurney

redouble your care and circumflexion,
that the family may be well manged

must render accunt, not only to your

the family of such vermine. I do suppose,
that the brindled cow has been had to the

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>THE very day after I wrote my last,
Clinker was set at liberty—As Martin
had foretold, the accuser was himself
committed for a robbery, upon unques∣tionable
evidence. He had been for some
time in the snares of the thief-taking so∣ciety;
who, resenting his presumption
in attempting to incroach upon their mo∣nopoly
of impeachment, had him taken
up and committed to Newgate, on the
deposition of an accomplice, who has
been admitted as evidence for the king.
The pos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilion being upon record as an
old offender, the chief justice made no
scruple of admitting Clinker to bail,
when he perused the affidavit of Mr.
Mead, importing that the said Clinker
was not the person that robbed him o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Blackheath; and honest Humphry was
discharged—When he came home, he ex∣pressed
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
great eagerness to pay his respects
to his master, and here his elocution fail∣ed
him, but his silence was pathetic; he
fell down at his feet, and embraced his
knees, sheding a flood of tears, which
my uncle did not see without emotion—
He took snuff in some confusion; and,
putting his hand in his pocket, gave him
his blessing in something more substantial
than words—“Clinker, (said he) I am
so well convinced, both of your ho∣nesty
and courage, that I am resolved
to make you my life-guard-man on the
highway.”</P>
<P>He was accordingly provided with a
case of pistols, and a carbine to be slung
a-cross his shoulders; and every other
preparation being made, we set out last
Thursday, at seven in the morning; my
uncle, with the three women in the
coach; Humphry, well mounted on a
black gelding bought for his use; my∣self
a-horseback, attended by my new
valet, Mr. Dutton, an exceeding cox∣comb,
fresh from his travels, whom I
have taken upon trial—The fellow wears
a solitaire, uses paint, and takes rappee
with all the grimace of a French marquis.
At present, however, he is in a riding-dress,
jack-boots, leather breeches, a
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
scarlet waistcoat, with gold binding, a
laced hat, a hanger, a French posting-whip
in his hand, and his hair <HI>en
queue.</HI></P>
<P>Before we had gone nine miles, my
horse lost one of his shoes; so that I was
obliged to stop at Barnet to have another,
while the coach proceeded at an easy
pace over the common. About a mile
short of Hatfield, the postilions, stopping
the carriage, gave notice to Clinker that
there were two suspicious fellows a-horse-back,
at the end of a lane, who seemed
waiting to attack the coach. Humphry
forthwith apprised my uncle, declaring
he would stand by him to the last drop
of his blood; and, unslinging his carbine,
prepared for action. The 'squire had
pistols in the pockets of the coach, and re∣solved
to make use of them directly; but
he was effectually prevented by his fe∣male
companions, who flung themselves
about his neck, and screamed in concert
—At that instant, who should come up
at a hand-gallop, but Martin, the high∣way-man,
who, advancing to the coach,
begged the ladies would compose them∣selves
for a moment; then, desiring
Clinker to follow him to the charge, he
pulled a pistol out of his bosom, and
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up together to give battle to
the rog<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, who, having fired at a great
distance, fled a-cross the common. They
were in pursuit of the fugitives when I
came up, not a little alarmed at the
shreiks in the coach, where I found my
uncle in a violent rage, without his peri∣wig,
struggling to disentangle himself
from Tabby and the other two, and
swearing with great vociferation. Before
I had time to interpose, Martin and
Clinker returned from the pursuit, and
the former payed his compliments with
great politeness, giving us to understand,
that the fellows had scampered off, and
that he believed they were a couple of
raw 'prentices from London. He com∣mended
Clinker for his courage, and
said, if we would give him leave, he
would have the honour to accompany us
as far as Stevenage, where he had some
business.</P>
<P>The 'squire, having recollected and ad∣justed
himself, was the first to laugh at
his own situation; but it was not without
difficulty, that Tabby's arms could be
untwisted from his neck, Liddy's teeth
chattered, and Jenkins was threatened
with a fit as usual. I had communicated
to my uncle the character of Martin, as
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
it was described by the constable, and he
was much struck with its singularity—
He could not suppose the fellow had any
design on our company, which was so nu∣merous
and well armed; he therefore
thanked him, for the service he had just
done them, said he would be glad of his
company, and asked him to dine with us
at Hatfield. This invitation might not
have been agreeable to the ladies, had
they known the real profession of our
guest, but this was a secret to all, ex∣cept
my uncle and myself—Mrs. Tabitha,
however, would by no means consent to
proceed with a case of loaded pistols in
the coach, and they were forthwith dis∣charged
in complaisance to her and the
rest of the women.</P>
<P>Being gratified in this particular, she
became remarkably good-humoured, and
at dinner behaved in the most affable
manner to Mr. Martin, with whose po∣lite
address and agreeable conversation
she seemed to be much taken. After
dinner, the landlord accosting me in the
yard, asked, with a significant look, if
the gentleman that rode the sorrel belong∣ed
to our company?—I understood his
meaning, but answered, <HI>no;</HI> that he had
come up with us on the common, and
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
helped us to drive away two fellows, that
looked like highwaymen—He nodded
three times distinctly, as much as to say,
he knows his cue. Then he inquired, if
one of those men was mounted on a bay
mare, and the other on a chesnut geld∣ing
with a white streak down his fore∣head?
and being answered in the affir∣mative,
he assured me they had robbed
three post-chaises this very morning—I
inquired, in my turn, if Mr. Martin was
of his acquaintance; and, nodding thrice
again, he answered, that <HI>he had seen the
gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Before we left Hatfield, my uncle, fix∣ing
his eyes on Martin with such expres∣sion
as is more easily conceived than de∣scribed,
asked, if he often travelled that
road? and he replied with a look which
denoted his understanding the question,
that he very seldom did business in that
part of the country. In a word, this ad∣venturer
favoured us with his company
to the neighbourhood of Stevenage, where
he took his leave of the coach and me,
in very polite terms, and turned off up∣on
a cross-road, that led to a village on
the left—At supper, Mrs. Tabby was ve∣ry
full in the praise of Mr. Martin's good∣sense
and good-breeding, and seemed to
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
regret that she had not a further oppor∣tunity
to make some experiment upon his
affection. In the morning, my uncle was
not a little surprised to receive, from
the waiter, a billet couched in these
words—</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“Sir,”</OPENER>
<P>“I could easily perceive from your
looks, when I had the honour to con∣verse
with you at Hatfield, that my
character is not unknown to you; and,
I dare say, you won't think it strange,
that I should be glad to change my
present way of life, for any other ho∣nest
occupation, let it be ever so hum∣ble,
that will afford me bread in mo∣deration,
and sleep in safety—Perhaps
you may think I flatter, when I say,
that from the moment I was witness to
your generous concern in the cause of
your servant, I conceived a particular
esteem and veneration for your per∣son;
and yet what I say is true. I
should think myself happy, if I could
be admitted into your protection and

or bailiff, for either of which
places I think myself tolerably well

qualified; and, sure I am, I should not
be found deficient in gratitude and
fidelity—At the same time, I am very
sensible how much you must deviate
from the common maxims of discre∣tion,
even in putting my professions to
the trial; but I don't look upon you
as a person that thinks in the ordinary
stile; and the delicacy of my situation,
will, I know, justify this address to a
heart warmed with beneficence and
compassion—Understanding you are
going pretty far north, I shall take an
opportunity to throw myself in your
way again, before you reach the bor∣ders
of Scotland; and, I hope, by that
time, you will have taken into consi∣deration,
the truly distressful case of,</P>
<CLOSER>honoured sir,
your very humble,
and devoted servant,
<SIGNED>EDWARD MARTIN.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The 'squire, having perused this letter,
put it into my hand, without saying a
syllable; and when I had read it, we
looked at each other in silence. From a
certain sparkling in his eyes, I discover∣ed
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
there was more in his heart, than he
cared to express with his tongue, in favour
of poor Martin; and this was precisely
my own feeling, which he did not fail to
discern, by the same means of communi∣cation—“What
shall we do (said he) to
save this poor sinner from the gallows,
and make him a useful member of the
commonwealth? and yet the proverb
says, Save a thief from the gallows,
and he'll cut your throat.” I told him,
I really believed Martin was capable of
giving the proverb the lie; and that I
should heartily concur in any step he
might take in favour of his so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licitation.
We mutually resolved to deliberate upon
the subject, and, in the mean time, pro∣ceeded
on our journey. The roads, hav∣ing
been broke up by the heavy rains in
the spring, were so rough, that although
we travelled very slowly, the jolting oc∣casioned
such pain to my uncle, that he
was become exceedingly peevish when
we arrived at this place, which lies about
eight miles from the post-road, between
Wetherby and Boroughbridge.</P>
<P>Harrigate-water, so celebrated for its
efficacy in the scurvy and other distem∣pers,
is supplied from a copious spring,
in the hollow of a wild common, round
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
which, a good many houses have been
built for the convenience of the drinkers,
though few of them are inhabited. Most
of the company lodge at some distance,
in five separate inns, situated in different
parts of the common, from whence they
go every morning to the well, in their own
carriages. The lodgers of each inn form
a distinct society, that eat together; and
there is a commodious public room,
where they breakfast in dishabille, at se∣parate
tables, from eight o'clock till ele∣ven,
as they chance or chuse to come in
—Here also they drink tea in the after∣noon,
and play at cards or dance in the
evening. One custom, however, pre∣vails,
which I look upon as a solecism in
politeness—The ladies treat with tea in
their turns; and even girls of sixteen are
not exempted from this shameful impo∣sition—There
is a public ball by sub∣scription
every night at one of the houses,
to which all the company from the others
are admitted by tickets; and, indeed,
Harrigate treads upon the heels of Bath,
in the articles of gaiety and dissipation—
with this difference, however, that here
we are more sociable and familiar. One
of the inns is already full up to the very
garrets, having no less than fifty lodgers,
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
and as many servants. Our family does
not exceed thirty-six; and I should be
sorry to see the number augmented, as
our accommodations won't admit of much
increase.</P>
<P>At present, the company is more agree∣able
than one could expect from an acci∣dental
assemblage of persons, who are
utter strangers to one another—There
seems to be a general disposition among
us to maintain good-fellowship, and pro∣mote
the purposes of humanity, in favour
of those who come hither on the score of
health. I see several faces which we left
at Bath, although the majority are of the
Northern counties, and many come from
Scotland for the benefit of these waters—
In such a variety, there must be some
originals, among whom Mrs. Tabitha
Bramble is not the most inconsiderable—
No place where there is such an inter∣course
between the sexes, can be dis∣agreeable
to a lady of her views and tem∣perament—She
has had some warm dis∣putes
at table, with a lame parson from
Northumberland, on the new birth, and
the insignificance of moral virtue; and
her arguments have been reinforced by
an old Scotch lawyer, in a tye periwig,
who, though he has lost his teeth, and the
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
use of his limbs, can still wag his tongue
with great volubility. He has paid her
such fulsome compliments, upon her
piety and learning, as seem to have won
her heart; and she, in her turn, treats
him with such attention as indicates a
design upon his person; but, by all ac∣counts,
he is too much a fox to be in∣veigled
into any snare that she can lay for
his affection.</P>
<P>We do not propose to stay long at Har∣rigate,
though, at present, it is our head∣quarters,
from whence we shall make
some excursions, to visit two or three of
our rich relations, who are settled in this
county.—Pray, remember me to all
our friends of Jesus, and allow me to be

<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
<OPENER>To DR. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>CONSIDERING the tax we pay for
turnpikes, the roads of this country con∣stitute
a most intolerable grievance. Be∣tween
Newark and Weatherby, I have
suffered more from jolting and swinging
than ever I felt in the whole course of my
life, although the carriage is remarkably
commodious and well hung, and the
postilions were very careful in driving.
I am now safely housed at the New Inn,
at Harrigate, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> came to satisfy my
curiosity, rather <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with any view of ad∣vantage
to my health; and, truly, after hav∣ing
considered all the parts and particulars
of the place, I cannot account for the con∣course
of people one finds here, upon any
other principle but that of caprice, which
seems to be the character of our nation.</P>
<P>Harrigate is a wild common, bare and
bleak, without tree or shrub, or the
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
least signs of cultivation; and the people
who come to drink the water, are crowd∣ed
together in paltry inns, where the few
tolerable rooms are monopolized by the
friends and favourites of the house, and
all the rest of the lodgers are obliged to
put up with dirty holes, where there is
neither space, air, nor convenience. My
apartment is about ten feet square; and
when the folding bed is down, there is
just room sufficient to pass between it and
the fire. One might expect, indeed, that
there would be no occasion for a fire at
Midsummer; but here the climate is so
backward, that an ash tree, which our
landlord has planted before my window,
is just beginning to put forth its leaves;
and I am fain to have my bed warmed
every night.</P>
<P>As for the water, which is said to have
effected so many surprising cures, I have
drank it once, and the first draught has
cured me of all desire to repeat the medi∣cine.—
Some people say it smells of rotten
eggs, and others compare it to the scour∣ings
of a foul gun.—It is generally sup∣posed
to be strongly impregnated with
sulphur; and Dr. Shaw, in his book
upon mineral waters, says, he has seen
flakes of sulphur floating in the well.—
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
<HI>Pace tanti viri;</HI> I, for my part, have never
observed any thing like sulphur, either
in or about the well, neither do I find
that any brimstone has ever been extract∣ed
from the water. As for the smell, if
I may be allowed to judge from my own
organs, it is exactly that of bilge-water;
and the saline taste of it seems to declare
that it is nothing else than salt water pu∣trified
in the bowels of the earth. I was
obliged to hold my nose with one hand,
while I advanced the glass to my mouth
with the other; and after I had made
shift to swallow it, my stomach could
hardly retain what it had received.—The
only effects it produced were sickness,
griping, and insurmountable disgust.—
I can hardly mention it without puking.—
The world is strangely misled by the af∣fectation
of singularity. I cannot help
suspecting, that this water owes its repu∣tation
in a great measure to its being so
strikingly offensive.—On the same kind
of analogy, a German doctor has intro∣duced
hemlock and other poisons, as
specifics, into the <HI>materia medica.</HI>—I am
persuaded, that all the cures ascribed to
the Harrigate water, would have been as
efficaciously, and infinitely more agree∣ably
performed, by the internal and ex∣ternal
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
use of sea-water. Sure I am, this
last is much less nauseous to the taste and
smell, and much more gentle in its opera∣tion
as a purge, as well as more exten∣sive
in its medical qualities.</P>
<P>Two days ago, we went across the
country to visit 'squire Burdock, who
married a first cousin of my father, an
heiress, who brought him an estate of a
thousand a year. This gentleman is a de∣clared
opponent of the ministry in parlia∣ment;
and having an opulent fortune,
piques himself upon living in the country,
and maintaining <HI>old English hospitality.</HI>—
By the bye, this is a phrase very much
used by the English themselves, both in
words and writing; but I never heard of
it out of the island, except by way of
irony and sarcasm. What the hospitality
of our fore-fathers has been I should be
glad to see recorded, rather in the me∣moirs
of strangers who have visited our
country, and were the proper objects and
judges of such hospitality, than in the
discourse and lucubrations of the modern
English, who seem to describe it from
theory and conjecture. Certain it is, we
are generally looked upon by foreigners,
as a people totally destitute of this vir∣tue;
and I never was in any country
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
abroad, where I did not meet with per∣sons
of distinction, who complained of
having been inhospitably used in Great
Britain. A gentleman of France, Italy,
or Germany, who has entertained and
lodged an Englishman at his house, when
he afterwards meets with his guest at
London, is asked to dinner at the Sara∣cen's-head,
the Turk's-head, the Boar's-head,
or the Bear, eats raw beef and
butter, drinks execrable port, and is
allowed to pay his share of the reckon∣ing.</P>
<P>But to return from this digression,
which my feeling for the honour of my
country obliged me to make—our
Yorkshire cousin has been a mighty fox∣hunter
<HI>before the Lord;</HI> but now he is too
fat and unwieldy to leap ditches and five∣bar
gates; nevertheless, he still keeps a
pack of hounds, which are well exercised;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> every night entertains
him with the adventures of the day's
chace, which he recites in a tone and
terms that are extremely curious and sig∣nificant.
In the mean time, his broad
brawn is scratched by one of his grooms.
—This fellow, it seems, having no in∣clination
to curry any beast out of the sta∣ble,
was at great pains to scollop his nails
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
in such a manner that the blood followed
at every stroke.—He was in hopes that
he would be dismissed from this disagree∣able
office, but the event turned out con∣trary
to his expectation.—His master de∣clared
he was the best scratcher in the
family; and now he will not suffer any
other servant to draw a nail upon his car∣case.</P>
<P>The 'squire's lady is very proud, with∣out
being stiff or inaccessible.—She re∣ceives
even her inferiors in point of fortune
with a kind of arrogant civility; but then
she thinks she has a right to treat them with
the most ungracious freedoms of speech,
and never fails to let them know she is
sensible of her own superior affluence.—
In a word, she speaks well of no living
soul, and has not one single friend in the
world. Her husband hates her mortally;
but, although the brute is sometimes so
very powerful in him that he will have
his own way, he generally truckles to her
dominion, and dreads, like a school-boy,
the lash of her tongue. On the other
hand, she is afraid of provoking him too
far, lest he should make some desperate
effort to shake off her yoke.—She, there∣fore,
acquiesces in the proofs he daily
gives of his attachment to the liberty of
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
an English freeholder, by saying and do∣ing,
at his own table, whatever gratifies
the brutality of his disposition, or contri∣butes
to the ease of his person. The
house, though large, is neither elegant
nor comfortable.—It looks like a great
inn, crowded with travellers, who dine
at the landlord's ordinary, where there is
a great profusion of victuals and drink,
but mine host seems to be misplaced;
and I would rather dine upon filberts with
a hermit, than feed upon venison with a
hog. The footmen might be aptly com∣pared
to the waiters of a tavern, if they
were more serviceable and less rapacious;
but they are generally insolent and inat∣tentive,
and so greedy, that, I think, I
can dine better, and for less expence, at
the Star and Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter in Pall mall, than at
our cousin's castle in Yorkshire. The
'squire is not only accommodated with a
wife, but he is also blessed with an only
son, about two and twenty, just returned
from Italy a complete fidler and <HI>dillet∣tante;</HI>
and he slips no opportunity of
manifesting the most perfect contempt
for his own father.</P>
<P>When we arrived, there was a family
of foreigners at the house, on a visit to
this virtuoso, with whom they had been
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
acquainted at the Spa: it was the count
de Melville, with his lady, on their way
to Scotland. Mr. Burdock had met with
an accident, in consequence of which
both the count and I would have retired,
but the young gentleman and his mother
insisted upon our staying dinner; and
their serenity seemed to be so little ruf∣fled
by what had happened, that we com∣plied
with their invitation. The 'squire
had been brought home over night in his
post-chaise, so terribly belaboured about
the pate, that he seemed to be in a state
of stupefaction, and had ever since re∣mained
speechless. A country apothe∣cary,
called Grieve, who lived in a
neighbouring village, having been called
to his assistance, had let him blood, and
applied a poulti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to his head, declaring,
that he had no fever, nor any other bad
symptom but the loss of speech, if he
really had lost that faculty. But the
young 'squire said this practitioner was an
<HI>ignorantaccio,</HI> that there was a fracture
in the <HI>cranium,</HI> and that there was a ne∣cessity
for having him trepanned without
loss of time. His mother, espousing this
opinion, had sent an express to York for
a surgeon to perform the operation, and
he was already come with his 'prentice
and instruments. Having examined the
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
patient's head, he began to prepare his
dressings; though Grieve still retained his
first opinion that there was no fracture,
and was the more confirmed in it as the
'squire had passed the night in profound
sleep, uninterrupted by any catching or
convulsion. The York surgeon said he
could not tell whether there was a frac∣ture,
until he should take off the scalp;
but, at any rate, the operation might be
of service in giving vent to any blood that
might be extravasated, either above or
below the <HI>dura mater.</HI> The lady and her
son were clear for trying the experiment;
and Grieve was dismissed with some
marks of contempt, which, perhaps, he
owed to the plainness of his appearance.
He seemed to be about the middle age,
wore his own black hair without any sort
of dressing; by his garb, one would have
taken him for a quaker, but he had none
of the stiffness of that sect, on the contra∣ry,
he was very submissive, respectful, and
remarkably taciturn.</P>
<P>Leaving the ladies in an apartment by
themselves, we adjourned to the patient's
chamber, where the dressings and instru∣ments
were displayed in order upon a
powter dish. The operator, laying aside
his coat and peri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vig, equipped himself
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
with a night-cap, apron, and sleeves,
while his 'prentice and footman, seizing
the 'squire's head, began to place it in a
proper posture.—But mark what fol∣lowed.—
The patient, bolting upright in
the bed, collared each of these assistants
with the grasp of Hercules, exclaiming,
in a bellowing tone, “I ha'n't lived so
long in Yorkshire to be trepanned by
such vermin as you;” and leaping on
the floor, put on his breeches quietly, to
the astonishment of us all. The surgeon
still insisted upon the operation, alledging
it was now plain that the brain was in∣jured,
and desiring the servants to put
him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto bed again; but no body would
venture to execute his orders, or even
to interpose: when the 'squire turned
him and his assistants out of doors, and
threw his apparatus out at the window.
Having thus asserted his prerogative, and
pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on his cloaths with the help of a va∣let,
the count, with my nephew and me,
were introduced by his son, and received
with his usual stile of rustic civility; then
turning to signor Macaroni, with a farcas∣tic
gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, “I tell thee what, Dick, (said
he) a man's scull is not to be bored
every time his head is broken; and I'll
convince thee and thy mother, that I
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
know as many tricks as e'er an old fox
in the West Riding.”</P>
<P>We afterwards understood he had quar∣relled
at a public house with an excise∣man,
whom he challenged to a bout
at single stick, in which he had been
worsted; and that the shame of this de∣feat
had tied up his tongue. As for ma∣dam,
she had shewn no concern for his
disaster, and now heard of his recovery
without emotion—She had taken some
little notice of my sister and niece, though
rather with a view to indulge her own
petulance, than out of any sentiment of
regard to our family.—She said Liddy
was a fright, and ordered her woman to
adjust her head before dinner; but she
would not meddle with Tabby, whose
spirit, she soon perceived, was not to be
irritated with impunity. At table, she
acknowledged me so far as to say she had
heard of my father; though she hinted,
that he had disobliged her family by
making a poor match in Wales. She
was disagreeably familiar in her enquiries
about our circumstances; and asked, if I
intended to bring up my nephew to the
law. I told her, that, as he had an inde∣pendent
fortune, he should follow no
profession but that of a country gentle∣man;
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
and that I was not without hopes
of procuring for him a seat in parliament.
—“Pray, cousin, (said she) what may
his fortune be?” When I answered,
that, with what I should be able to give
him, he would have better than two
thousand a year, she replied, with a dis∣dainful
toss of her head, that it would
be impossible for him to preserve his in∣dependence
on such a paltry provision.</P>
<P>Not a little nettled at this arrogant re∣mark,
I told her, I had the honour to sit
in parliament with her father, when he
had little more than half that income;
and I believed there was not a more in∣dependent
and incorruptible member in
the house. “Ay; but times are changed,
(cried the 'squire)—Country gentlemen
now-a days live after another fashion.
—My table alone stands me in a cool
thousand a quarter, though I raise my
own stock, import my own liquors,
and have every thing at the first hand.
—True it is, I keep open house, and
receive all comers, for the honour of
Old England.” “If that be the case,
(said I) 'tis a wonder you can maintain
it at so small an expence; but every
private gentleman is not expected to
keep a <HI>caravansera</HI> for the accommoda∣tion
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
of travellers: indeed, if every in∣dividual
lived in the same stile, you
would not have such a number of
guests at your table, of consequence
your hospitality would not shine so
bright for the glory of the West Rid∣ing.”
The young 'squire, tickled by
this ironical observation, exclaimed, “<HI>O
che burla!</HI>”—his mother eyed me in
silence with a supercilious air; and the
father of the feast, taking a bumper of
October, “My service to you, cousin
Bramble, (said he) I have always heard
there was something keen and biting in
the air of the Welch mountains.”</P>
<P>I was much pleased with the count de
Melville, who is sensible, easy, and po∣lite;
and the countess is the most amiable
woman I ever beheld. In the afternoon
they took leave of their entertainers, and
the young gentleman, mounting his horse,
undertook to conduct their coach through
the park, while one of their servants rode
round to give notice to the rest, whom
they had left at a public house on the
road. The moment their backs were
turned, the censorious daemon took pos∣session
of our Yorkshire landlady and our
sister Tabitha.—The former observed,
that the countess was a good sort of a
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
body, but totally ignorant of good breed∣ing,
consequently aukward in her address.
The 'squire said he did not pretend to the
breeding of any thing but colts; but
that the jade would be very handsome, if
she was a little more in flesh. “Hand∣some!
(cried Tabby) she has indeed a
pair of black eyes without any mean∣ing;
but then there is not a good fea∣ture
in her face.” “I know not what
you call good features in Wales; (re∣plied
our landlord) but they'll pass in
Yorkshire.” Then turning to Liddy,
he added, “What say you, my pretty
Redstreak?—what is your opinion of
the countess?” “I think (cried Lid∣dy,
with great emotion) she's an angel.”
Tabby chid her for talking with such
freedom in company; and the lady of
the house said, in a contemptuous t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne,
she supposed miss had been brought up
at some country boarding-school.</P>
<P>Our conversation was suddenly inter∣rupted
by the young gentleman, who
galloped into the yard all aghast, ex∣claiming,
that the coach was attacked by
a great number of highwaymen. My ne∣phew
and I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out, found his own
and his servant's horse ready saddled in the
stable, with pistols in the caps.—We
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
mounted instantly, ordering Clinker and
Dutton to follow with all possible expedi∣tion;
but notwithstanding all the speed
we could make, the action was over be∣fore
we arrived, and the count with his
lady, safe lodged at the house of Grieve,
who had signalized himself in a very re∣markable
manner on this occasion. At
the turning of a lane, that led to the vil∣lage
where the count's servants remained,
a couple of robbers a-horseback suddenly
appeared, with their pistols advanced:
one kept the coachman in awe, and the
other demanded the count's money, while
the young 'squire went off at full speed,
without ever casting a look behind. The
count desiring the thief to withdraw his
pistol, as the lady was in great terror, de∣livered
his purse without making the least
resistance; but not satisfied with this
booty, which was pretty considerable,
the rascal insisted upon rifling her of her
ear-rings and necklace, and the countess
screamed with affright. Her husband,
exasperated at the violence with which
she was threatened, wrested the pistol out
of the fellow's hand, and turning it upon
him, snapped it in his face; but the rob∣ber
knowing there was no charge in it,
drew another from his bosom, and in all
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
probability would have killed him on the
spot, had not his life been saved by a won∣derful
interposition. Grieve, the apotheca∣ry,
chancing to pass that very instant, ran
up to the coach, and with a crab-stick,
which was all the weapon he had, brought
the fellow to the ground with the first blow;
then seizing his pistol, presented it to his
colleague, who fired his piece at random,
and fled without further opposition. The
other was secured by the assistance of the
count and the coachman; and his legs
being tied under the belly of his own
horse. Grieve conducted him to the vil∣lage▪
whither also the carriage proceeded.
It was with great difficulty the countess
could be kept from swooning; but at
last she was happily conveyed to the house
of the apothecary, who went into the shop
to prepare some drops for her, while his
wife and daughter administered to her in
another apartment.</P>
<P>I found the count standing in the kitchen
with the parson of the parish, and expressing
much impatience to see his protector,
whom as yet he had scarce found time to
thank for the essential service he had done
him and the countess.—The daughter
passing at the same time with a glass of
water, monsieur de Melville could not
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
help taking notice of her figure, which
was strikingly engaging.—“Ay, (said the
parson) she is the prettiest girl, and
the best girl in all my parish; and if
I could give my son an estate of ten
thousand a year, he should have my
consent to lay it at her feet. If Mr.
Grieve had been as sollicitous about
getting money, as he has been in per∣forming
all the duties of a primitive
Christian, Fy would not have hung so
long upon his hands.” “What is her
name?” said I. “Sixteen years ago
(answered the vicar) I christened her by
the names of Seraphina Melvilia.”
“Ha! what! how! (cried the count
eagerly) sure, you said Seraphina Mel∣vilia.”
“I did; (said he) Mr. Grieve
told me those were the names of two
noble persons abroad, to whom he had
been obliged for more than life.”</P>
<P>The count, without speaking another
syllable, rushed into the parlour, crying,
“This is your god-daughter, my dear.”
Mrs. Grieve, then seizing the countess by
the hand, exclaimed with great agitation,
“O madam!—O sir!—I am—I am your
poor Elinor.—This is my Seraphina
Melvilia.—O child! these are the
count and countess of Melville, the
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
generous—the glorious benefactors of
thy once unhappy parents.”</P>
<P>The countess rising from her seat,
threw her arms about the neck of the
amiable Seraphina, and clasped her to
her breast with great tenderness, while
she herself was embraced by the weeping
mother. This moving scene was com∣pleted
by the entrance of Grieve himself,
who falling on his knees before the count,
“Behold (said he) a penitent, who at
length can look upon his patron with∣out
shrinking.” “Ah, Ferdinand!
(cried he, raising and folding him in
his arms) the play-fellow of my infan∣cy—the
companion of my youth!—
Is it to you then I am indebted for my
life?” “Heaven has heard my pray∣er,
(said the other) and given me an
opportunity to prove myself not alto∣gether
unworthy of your clemency and
protection.” He then kissed the hand
of the countess, while monsieur de Mel∣ville
saluted his wife and lovely daughter,
and all of us were greatly affected by this
pathetic recognition.</P>
<P>In a word, Grieve was no other than
Ferdinand count Fathom, whose adven∣tures
were printed many years ago. Be∣ing
a sincere convert to virtue, he had
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
changed his name, that he might elude
the enquiries of the count, whose generous
allowance he determined to forego, that
he might have no dependence but upon
his own industry and moderation. He
had accordingly settled in this village as a
practitioner in surgery and physic, and
for some years wrestled with all the mise∣ries
of indigence, which, however, he
and his wife had borne with the most ex∣emplary
resignation. At length, by dint
of unwearied attention to the duties of his
profession, which he exercised with equal
humanity and success, he had acquired a
tolerable share of business among the
farmers and common people, which ena∣bled
him to live in a decent manner. He
had been scarce ever seen to smile; was
unaffectedly pious; and all the time he
could spare from the avocations of his
employment he spent in educating his
daughter, and in studying for his own
improvement.—In short, the adventurer
Fathom was, under the name of Grieve,
universally respected among the common∣alty
of this district, as a prodigy of learn∣ing
and virtue. These particulars I
learned from the vicar, when we quitted
the room, that they might be under no re∣straint
in their mutual effusions. I make
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
no doubt that Grieve will be pressed to
leave off business, and re-unite himself to
the count's family; and as the countess
seemed extremely fond of his daughter,
she will, in all probability, insist upon Se∣raphina's
accompanying her to Scotland.</P>
<P>Having paid our compliments to these
noble persons, we returned to the 'squire's,
where we expected an invitation to pass the
night, which was wet and raw; but, it
seems, 'squire Burdock's hospitality reach∣ed
not so far for the honour of Yorkshire:
we therefore departed in the evening, and
lay at an inn, where I caught cold.</P>
<P>In hope of riding it down before it
could take fast hold on my constitution,
I resolved to visit another relation, one
Mr. Pimpernel, who lived about a dozen
miles from the place where we lodged.
Pimpernel being the youngest of four
sons, was bred an attorney at Furnival's-inn;
but all his elder brothers dying, he
got himself called to the bar for the ho∣nour
of his family, and soon after this
preferment, succeeded to his father's estate,
which was very considerable. He carried
home with him all the knavish chicanery
of the lowest pettifogger, together with a
wife whom he had purchased of a d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay∣man
for twenty pounds; and he soon
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
found means to obtain a <HI>Dedimus</HI> as an
acting justice of peace. He is not only
a sordid miser in his disposition, but his
avarice is mingled with a spirit of despo∣tism,
which is truly diabolical.—He is a
brutal husband, an unnatural parent, a
harsh master, an oppressive landlord, a li∣tigious
neighbour, and a partial magi∣strate.—
Friends he has none; and in
point of hospitality and good breeding,
our cousin Burdock is a prince in com∣parison
of this ungracious miscreant,
whose house is the lively representation of
a gaol. Our reception was suitable to the
character I have sketched. Had it de∣pended
upon the wife, we should have
been kindly treated.—She is really a good
sort of a woman, in spite of her low ori∣ginal,
and well respected in the county;
but she has not interest enough in her
own house to command a draught of ta∣ble-beer,
far less to bestow any kind of
education on her children, who run about,
like ragged colts, in a state of nature.—
Pox on him! he is such a dirty fellow,
that I have not patience to prosecute the
subject.</P>
<P>By that time we reached Harrigate, I
began to be visited by certain rheumatic
symptoms. The Scotch lawyer, Mr.
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
Micklewhimmen, recommended a hot
bath of these waters so earnestly, that I
was over-persuaded to try the experi∣ment.—
He had used it often with success,
and always stayed an hour in the bath,
which was a tub filled with Harrigate
water, heated for the purpose. If I could
hardly bear the smell of a single tumbler
when cold, you may guess how my nose
was regaled by the steams arising from a
hot bath of the same fluid. At night, I
was conducted into a dark hole on the
ground floor, where the tub smoaked and
stunk like the pot of Acheron, in one
corner, and in another stood a dirty bed
provided with thick blankets, in which
I was to sweat after coming out of the
bath. My heart seemed to die within me
when I entered this dismal bagnio, and
found my brain assaulted by such insuffer∣able
effluvia.—I cursed Micklewhimmen
for not considering that my organs were
formed on this side of the Tweed; but
being ashamed to recoil upon the thre∣shold,
I submitted to the process.</P>
<P>After having endured all but real suffo∣cation
for above a quarter of an hour in
the tub, I was moved to the bed and
wrapped in blankets.—There I lay a full
hour panting with intolerable heat; but
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
not the least moisture appearing on my
skin, I was carried to my own chamber,
and passed the night without closing an
eye, in such a flutter of spirits as render∣ed
me the most miserable wretch in be∣ing.
I should certainly have run distract∣ed,
if the rarefaction of my blood, occa∣sioned
by that Stygian bath, had not burst
the vessels, and produced a violent hae∣morrhage,
which, though dreadful and
alarming, removed the horrible disquiet.
—I lost two pounds of blood, and more,
on this occasion; and find myself still
weak and languid; but, I believe, a little
exercise will forward my recovery; and
therefore I am resolved to set out to mor∣row
for York, in my way to Scarbo∣rough,
where I propose to brace up my
fibres by sea-bathing, which, I know, is
one of your favourite specifics. There is;
however, one disease, for which you have
found as yet no specific, and that is old
age, of which this tedious unconnected
epistle is an infallible symptom:—<HI>what,</HI>
therefore, <HI>cannot be cured, must be endured,</HI>

</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>THE manner of living at Harrigate
was so agreeable to my disposition, that I
left the place with some regret—Our aunt
Tabby would have probably made some
objection to our departing so soon, had
not an accident embroiled her with Mr.
Micklewhimmen, the Scotch advocate,
on whose heart she had been practising,
from the second day after our arrival—
That original, though seemingly preclud∣ed
from the use of his limbs, had turned
his genius to good account—In short, by
dint of groaning, and whining, he had ex∣cited
the compassion of the company so
effectually, that an old lady, who occu∣pied
the very best apartment in the house,
gave it up for his ease and convenience.
When his man led him into the Long
Room, all the females were immediately
in commotion—One set an elbow-chair;
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
another shook up the cushion; a third
brought a stool; and a fourth a pillow,
for the accommodation of his feet—Two
ladies (of whom Tabby was always one)
supported him into the dining-room, and
placed him properly at the table; and
his taste was indulged with a succession
of delicacies, culled by their fair hands.
All this attention he repaid with a pro∣fusion
of compliments and benedictions,
which were not the less agreeable for be∣ing
delivered in the Scottish dialect. As
for Mrs. Tabitha, his respects were parti∣cularly
addressed to her, and he did not
fail to mingle them with religious reflec∣tions,
touching free grace, knowing her
biass to methodism, which he also pro∣fessed
upon a calvinistical model.</P>
<P>For my part, I could not help think∣ing
this lawyer was not such an invalid as
he pretended to be. I observed he ate
very heartily three times a-day; and
though his bottle was marked <HI>stomachic
tincture,</HI> he had recourse to it so often,
and seemed to swallow it with such pecu∣liar
relish, that I suspected it was not
compounded in the apothecary's shop, or
the chemist's laboratory. One day, while
he was earnest in discourse with Mrs.
Tabitha, and his servant had gone out
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
on some occasion or other, I dexterously
exchanged the labels, and situation of his
bottle and mine; and having tasted his
tincture, found it was excellent claret.
I forthwith handed it about to some of
my neighbours, and it was quite emptied
before Mr. Micklewhimmen had occasion
to repeat his draught. At length, turn∣ing
about, he took hold of my bottle,
instead of his own, and, filling a large
glass, drank to the health of Mrs. Tabi∣tha—
It had scarce touched his lips, when
he perceived the change which had been
put upon him, and was at first a little out
of countenance—He seemed to retire
within himself, in order to deliberate,
and in half a minute his resolution was
taken; addressing himself to our quarter,
“I give the gentleman cradit for his wit
(said he); it was a gude practical joke;
but sometimes <HI>hi joci in seria ducunt ma∣la</HI>—I
hope for his own sake he has na
drank all the liccor; for it was a vara
poorful infusion of jallap in Bourdeaux
wine; at its possable he may ha ta'en
sic a dose as will produce a terrible
catastrophe in his ain booels—”</P>
<P>By far the greater part of the contents
had fallen to the share of a young clo∣thier
from Leeds, who had come to make
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
a figure at Harrigate, and was, in effect
a great coxcomb in his way. It was with
a view to laugh at his fellow-guests, as
well as to mortify the lawyer, that he had
emptied the bottle, when it came to his
turn, and he had laughed accordingly:
but now his mirth gave way to his appre∣hension—He
began to spit, to make wry
faces, and writhe himself into various
contorsions—“Damn the stuff! (cried
he) I thought it had a villanous twang
—pah! He that would cozen a Scot,
mun get oop betimes, and take Old
Scratch for his counsellor—” “In
troth mester what d'ye ca'um, (replied
the lawyer) your wit has run you into a
filthy puddle—I'm truly cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rned for
your waeful case—The best advice I
can give you, in sic a delemma, is to
send an express to Rippon for doctor
Waugh, without delay, and, in the
mean time, swallow all the oil and but∣ter
you can find in the hoose, to de∣fend
your poor stomach and intastins
from the villication of the particles of
the jallap, which is vara violent, even
when taken in moderation.”</P>
<P>The poor clothier's torments had al∣ready
begun: he retired, roaring with
pain, to his own chamber; the oil was
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
swallowed, and the doctor sent for; but
before he arrived, the miserable patient
had made such discharges upwards and
downwards, that nothing remained to
give him further offence; and this dou∣ble
evacuation, was produced by imagi∣nation
alone; for what he had drank
was genuine wine of Bourdeaux, which
the lawyer had brought from Scotland
for his own private use. The clothier,
finding the joke turn out so expensive
and disagreeable, quitted the house next
morning, leaving the triumph to Mickle∣whimmen,
who enjoyed it internally,
without any outward signs of exultation
—on the contrary, he affected to pity
the young man for what he had suffered;
and acquired fresh credit from this shew
of moderation.</P>
<P>It was about the middle of the night,
which succeeded this adventure, that the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent of the kitchen chimney being foul,
the soot took fire, and the alarm was
given in a dreadful manner—Every body
leaped naked out of bed, and in a mi∣nute
the whole house was filled with cries
and confusion—There were two stairs in
the house, and to these we naturally ran;
but they were both so blocked up, by the
people pressing one upon another, that it
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
seemed impossible to pass, without throw∣ing
down and trampling upon the women.
In the midst of this anarchy, Mr. Mickle∣whimmen,
with a leathern portmanteau
on his back, came running as nimble as
a buck along the passage; and Tabby,
in her under-petticoat, endeavouring to
hook him under the arm, that she might
escape through his protection, he very
fairly pushed her down, crying, “Na,
na, gude faith, charity begins at hame!”
Without paying the least respect to the
shrieks and intreaties of his female friends,
he charged through the midst of the
crowd, overturning every thing that op∣posed
him; and actually fought his way
to the bottom of the stair-case—By this
time Clinker had found a ladder, by which
he entered the window of my uncle's
chamber, where our family was assem∣bled,
and proposed that we should make
our exit successively by that conveyance.
The 'squire exhorted his sister to begin
the descent; but, before she could re∣solve,
her woman, Mrs. Winifred Jen∣kins,
in a transport of terror, threw
herself out at the window upon the
ladder, while Humphry dropped upon
the ground, that he might receive
her in her descent—This maiden
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
was just as she had started out of bed,
the moon shone very bright, and a fresh
breeze of wind blowing, none of Mrs.
Winifred's beauties could possibly escape
the view of the fortunate Clinker, whose
heart was not able to withstand the united
force of so many charms; at least, I am
much mistaken, if he has not been her
humble slave from that moment—He re∣ceived
her in his arms, and, giving her
his coat to protect her from the weather,
ascended again with admirable dexte∣rity.</P>
<P>At that instant, the landlord of the
house called out with an audible voice,
that the fire was extinguished, and the
ladies had nothing further to fear: this
was a welcome note to the audience, and
produced an immediate effect; the shriek∣ing
ceased, and a confused sound of ex∣postulation
ensued. I conducted Mrs.
Tabitha and my sister to their own cham∣ber,
where Liddy fainted away; but was
soon brought to herself. Then I went to
offer my services to the other ladies, who
might want assistance—They were all
scudding through the passage to their se∣veral
apartments; and as the thoroughfair
was lighted by two lamps, I had a pret∣ty
good observation of them in their tran∣sit;
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
but as most of them were naked to
the smock, and all their heads shrowded
in huge night-caps, I could not distinguish
one face from another, though I recog∣nized
some of their voices—These were
generally plaintive; some wept, some
scolded, and some prayed—I lifted up
one poor old gentlewoman, who had been
overturned and sore bruised by a multi∣tude
of feet; and this was also the case
with the lame parson from Northumber∣land,
whom Micklewhimmen had in his
passage overthrown, though not with im∣punity,
for the cripple, in falling, gave
him such a good pelt on the head with
his crutch, that the blood followed.</P>
<P>As for this lawyer, he waited below till
the hurly burly was over, and then stole
softly to his own chamber, from whence
he did not venture to make a second sal∣ly
till eleven in the forenoon, when he was
led into the Public Room by his own ser∣vant
and another assistant, groaning most
woefully, with a bloody napkin round
his head. But things were greatly altered
—The selfish brutality of his behaviour
on the stairs had steeled their hearts against
all his arts and address—Not a soul of∣fered
to accommodate him with chair,
cushion, or footstool; so that he was ob∣liged
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
to sit down on a hard wooden
bench—In that position, he looked a∣round
with a rueful aspect, and, bowing
very low, said in a whining tone, “Your
most humble servant, ladies—Fire is
a dreadful calamity—” “Fire puri∣fies
gold, and it tries friendship.”
cried Mrs. Tabitha, bridling. “Yea,
madam (replied Micklewhimmen);
and it trieth discretion also—” “If
discretion consists in forsaking a friend
in adversity, you are eminently possess∣ed
of that virtue.” resumed our aunt—
Na, madam, (rejoined the advocate)
well I wot, I cannot claim any merit
from the mode of my retreat—Ye'll
please to observe ladies, there are twa
independent principles that actuate
our nature—One is instinct, which we
have in common with the brute crea∣tion,
and the other is reason—Noo, in
certain great emergencies, when the
faculty of reason is suspended, instinct
taks the lead, and when this predo∣minates,
having no affinity with rea∣son,
it pays no sort of regard to its
connections; it only operates for the
preservation of the individual, and that
by the most expeditious and effectual
means; therefore, begging your par∣don,
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
ladies, I'm no accountable in <HI>foro
conscientiae,</HI> for what I did, while un∣der
the influence of this irresistible
pooer.”</P>
<P>Here my uncle interposing, “I should
be glad to know, (said he) whether it
was instinct that prompted you to re∣treat
with bag and baggage; for, I
think, you had a portmanteau on your
shoulder—” The lawyer answered,
without hesitation, “Gif I might tell my
mind freely, withoot incuring the sus∣picion
of presumption, I should think
it was something superior to either rea∣son
or instinct which suggested that
measure, and this on a twafald ac∣coont:
in the first place, the port∣manteau
contained the writings of a
worthy nobleman's estate; and their
being burnt would have occasioned a
loss that could not be repaired; se∣condly,
my good angel seems to have
laid the portmantle on my shoulders, by
way of defence, to sustain the violence
of a most inhuman blow, from the
crutch of a reverend clergyman;
which, even in spite of that medium,
hath wounded me sorely, even unto
the pericranium.” “By your own
doctrine, (cried the parson, who chanced
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
to be present) I am not accountable
for the blow, which was the effect of
instinct.” “I crave your pardon, re∣verend
sir, (said the other) instinct ne∣ver
acts but for the preservation of the
individual; but your preservation was
out of the case—you had already re∣ceived
the damage, and therefore the
blow must be imputed to revenge,
which is a sinful passion, that ill be∣comes
any Christian, especially a pro∣testant
divine; and let me tell you,
most reverend doctor, gin I had a∣mind
to plea, the law would hauld
my libel relevant.” “Why, the da∣mage
is pretty equal on both sides
(cried the parson); your head is broke,
and my crutch is snapt in the middle
—Now, if you will repair the one, I
will be at the expence of curing the
other.”</P>
<P>This sally raised the laugh against
Micklewhimmen, who began to look
grave; when my uncle, in order to
change the discouse, observed, that in∣stinct
had been very kind to him in an∣other
respect; for it had restored to him
the use of his limbs, which, in his exit,
he had moved with surprising agility.—
He replied, that it was the nature of fear
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
to brace up the nerves; and mentioned
some surprising feats of strength and ac∣tivity
performed by persons under the
impulse of terror; but he complained,
that in his own particular, the effects
had ceased when the cause was taken
away—The 'squire said, he would lay a
tea-drinking on his head, that he should
dance a Scotch measure, without making
a false step; and the advocate grinning,
called for the piper—A fiddler being at
hand, this original started up, with his
bloody napkin over his black tye-peri∣wig,
and acquitted himself in such a man∣ner
as exerted the mirth of the whole
company; but he could not regain the
good graces of Mrs. Tabby, who did not
understand the principle of instinct; and
the lawyer did not think it worth his while
to proceed to further demonstration.</P>
<P>From Harrigate, we came hither, by
the way of York, and here we shall tar∣ry
some days, as my uncle and Tabitha
are both resolved to make use of the
waters. Scarborough, though a paltry
town, is romantic from its situation along
a cliff that over-hangs the sea The bar∣bour
is formed by a small elbow of land
that runs out as a natural mole, directly
opposite to the town; and on that side is
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
the castle, which stands very high, of
considerable extent, and, before the in∣vention
of gun-powder, was counted im∣pregnable.
At the other end of Scar∣borough
are two public rooms for the
use of the company, who resort to this
place in the summer, to drink the waters
and bathe in the sea; and the diversions
are pretty much on the same footing here
as at Bath. The Spa is a little way be∣yond
the town, on this side, under a cliff,
within a few paces of the sea, and thither
the drinkers go every morning in disha∣bille;
but the descent is by a great num∣ber
of steps, which invalids find very in∣convenient.
Betwixt the well and the
harbour, the bathing machines are ran∣ged
along the beach, with all their pro∣per
utensils and attendants—You have
never seen one of these machines—Image
to yourself a small, snug, wooden cham∣ber,
fixed upon a wheel-carriage, having
a door at each end, and on each side a
little window above, a bench below—
The bather, ascending into this apart∣ment
by wooden steps, shuts himself in,
and begins to undress, while the atten∣dant
yokes a horse to the end next the
sea, and draws the carriage forwards, till
the surface of the water is on a level with
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
the floor of the dressing-room, then he
moves and fixes the horse to the other
end—The person within, being stripped,
opens the door to the sea-ward, where he
finds the guide ready, and plunges head∣long
into the water—After having
bathed, he re-ascends into the apart∣ment,
by the steps which had been shift∣ed
for that purpose, and puts on his
clothes at his leisure, while the carriage
is drawn back again upon the dry land;
so that he has nothing further to do, but
to open the door, and come down as he
went up—Should he be so weak or ill as
to require a servant to put off and on his
clothes, there is room enough in the a∣partment
for half a dozen people. The
guides who attend the ladies in the wa∣ter,
are of their own sex, and they and
the female bathers have a dress of flan∣nel
for the sea; nay, they are provided
with other conveniences for the support
of decorum. A certain number of the ma∣chines
are fitted with tilts, that project
from the sea-ward ends of them, so as to
screen the bathers from the view of all
persons whatsoever—The beach is admir∣ably
adapted for this practice, the descent
being gently gradual, and the sand soft
as velvet; but then the machines can be
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
used only at a certain time of the tide,
which varies every day; so that some∣times
the bathers are obliged to rise very
early in the morning—For my part, I
love swimming as an exercise, and can
enjoy it at all times of the tide, without
the formality of an apparatus—You and
I have often plunged together into the
Isis; but the sea is a much more noble
bath, for health as well as pleasure. You
cannot conceive what a flow of spirits it
gives, and how it braces every sinew of
the human frame. Were I to enumerate
half the diseases which are every day cured
by sea-bathing, you might justly say you
had received a treatise, instead of a let∣ter,
from</P>

<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not found all the benefit I
expected at Scarborough, where I have
been these eight days—From Harrigate
we came hither by the way of York,
where we stayed only one day to visit the
Castle, the Minster, and the Assembly-room.
The first, which was heretofore a fortress,
is now converted to a prison, and is the
best, in all respects, I ever saw at home
or abroad—It stands in a high situation,
extremely well ventilated; and has a spa∣cious
area within the walls, for the health
and convenience of all the prisoners, ex∣cept
those whom it is necessary to secure
in close confinement—Even these last
have all the comforts that the nature of
their situation can admit. Here the
assizes are held, in a range of buildings
erected for that purpose.</P>
<P>As for the Minster, I know not how to
distinguish it, except by its great size and
the height of its spire, from those other
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
antient churches in different parts of the
kingdom, which used to be called mo∣numents
of Gothic architecture; but it is
now agreed, that this stile is Saracen ra∣ther
than Gothic; and, I suppose, it was
first imported into England from Spain,
great part of which was under the domi∣nion
of the Moors. Those British archi∣tects,
who adopted this stile, don't seem
to have considered the propriety of their
adoption. The climate of the country,
possessed by the Moors or Saracens, both
in Africa and Spain, was so exceedingly
hot and dry, that those who built places
of worship for the multitude, employed
their talents in contriving edifices that
should be cool; and, for this purpose,
nothing could be better adopted than
those buildings; vast, narrow, dark, and
losty, impervious to the sun beams, and
having little communication with the
scorched external atmosphere; but ever
affording a refreshing coolness, like sub∣terranean
cellars in the heats of summer,
or natural caverns in the bowels of huge
mountains. But nothing could be more
preposterous, than to imitate such a mode
of architecture in a country like Eng∣land,
where the climate is cold, and the
air eternally loaded with vapours; and
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
where, of consequence, the builder's in∣tention
should be to keep the people dry
and warm—For my part, I never entered
the Abbey church at Bath but once, and
the moment I stept over the threshold, I
found myself chilled to the very marrow
of my bones—When we consider, that
in our churches, in general, we breathe a
gross stagnated air, surcharged with
damps from vaults, tombs, and charnel∣houses,
may we not term them so many
magazines of rheums, created for the be∣nefit
of the medical faculty? and safely
aver, that more bodies are lost, than
souls saved, by going to church, in the
winter especially, which may be said to
engross eight months in the year. I
should be glad to know, what offence it
would give to tender consciences, if the
house of God was made more comfort∣able,
or less dangerous to the health of
valetudinarians; and whether it would
not be an encouragement to piety, as well
as the salvation of many lives, if the
place of worship was well floored, wain∣scotted,
warmed, and ventilated, and its
area kept sacred from the pollution of the
dead. The practice of burying in
churches was the effect of ignorant su∣perstition,
influenced by knavish priesta,
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
who pretended that the devil could have
no power over the defunct, if he was in∣terred
in holy ground; and this, indeed,
is the only reason that can be given for
consecrating all cemeteries, even at this
day.</P>
<P>The external appearance of an old ca∣thedral
cannot be but displeasing to the
eye of every man, who has any idea of
propriety and proportion, even though he
may be ignorant of architecture as a
science; and the long slender spire puts
one in mind of a criminal impaled, with
a sharp stake rising up through his
shoulder—These towers, or steeples, were
likewise borrowed from the Mahometans;
who, having no bells, used such mina∣rets
for the purpose of calling the people
to prayers—They may be of further use,
however, for making observations and
signals; but I would vote for their be∣ing
distinct from the body of the church,
because they serve only to make the pile
more barbarous, or Saracencial.</P>
<P>There is nothing of this Arabic archi∣tecture
in the Assembly Room, which
seems to me to have been built upon a de∣sign
of Palladio, and might be converted
into an elegant place of worship; but it
is indifferently contrived for that sort of
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
idolatry which is performed in it at pre∣sent:
the grandeur of the fane gives a
diminutive effect to the little painted di∣vinities
that are adored in it, and the
company, on a ball-night, must look like
an assembly of fantastic fairies, revelling
by moon-light among the columns of a
Grecian temple.</P>
<P>Scarborough seems to be falling off, in
point of reputation—All these places
(Bath excepted) have their vogue, and
then the fashion changes—I am persuad∣ed,
there are fifty spaws in England as
efficacious and salutary as that of Scar∣borough,
though they have not yet risen
to fame; and, perhaps, never will, un∣less
some medical encomiast should find
an interest in displaying their virtues to
the public view—Be that as it may, re∣course
will always be had to this place
for the convenience of sea-beathing, while
this practice prevails; but it were to be
wished, they would make the beach more
accessible to invalids.</P>
<P>I have here met with my old acquain∣tance,
H—t, whom you have often
heard me mention as one of the most
original characters upon earth—I first
knew him at Venice, and afterwards saw
him in different parts of Italy, where he
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
was well known by the nick-name of Ca∣vallo
Bianco, from his appearing always
mounted on a pale horse, like Death in
the Revelations. You must remember
the account I once gave you of a curious
dispute he had at Constantinople, with a
couple of Turks, in defence of the Chri∣stian
religion; a dispute from which he
acquired the epithet of Demonstrator—
The truth is, H—owns no religion
but that of nature; but, on this occasion,
he was stimulated to shew his parts, for
the honour of his country—Some years
ago, being in the Campidoglio at Rome,
he made up to the bust of Jupiter, and,
bowing very low, exclaimed in the Italian
language, “I hope, sir, if ever you get
your head above water again, you will
remember that I paid my respects to
you in your adversity.” This sally was
reported to the cardinal Camerlengo, and
by him laid before pope Benedict XIV.
who could not help laughing at the ex∣travagance
of the address, and said to the
cardinal, “Those English heretics think
they have a right to go to the devil in
their own way.”</P>
<P>Indeed H—was the only English∣man
I ever knew, who had resolution
enough to live in his own way, in the
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
midst of foreigners; for, neither in dress,
diet, customs, or conversation, did he
deviate one tittle from the manner in
which he had been brought up. About
twelve years ago, he began a Giro or cir∣cuit,
which he thus performed—At Na∣ples,
where he fixed his head-quarters,
he embarked for Marseilles, from whence
he travelled with a Voiturin to Antibes—
There he took his passage to Genoa and
Lerici; from which last place he pro∣ceeded,
by the way of Cambratina, to Pisa
and Florence—After having halted some
time in this metropolis, he set out with a
Vetturino for Rome, where he reposed
himself a few weeks, and then continued
his route for Naples, in order to wait for
the next opportunity of embarkation—
After having twelve times described this
circle, he lately flew off at a tangent to
visit some trees at his country-house in
England, which he had planted above
twenty years ago, after the plan of the
double colonnade in the piazza of St.
Peter's at Rome—He came hither to
Scarborough, to pay his respects to his
noble friend and former pupil, the M—
of G—, and, forgetting that he is now
turned of seventy, sacrificed so liberally
to Bacchus, that next day he was seized
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
a fit of the apoplexy, which has a little
impaired his memory; but he retains all
the oddity of his character in perfection,
and is going back to Italy, by the way
of Geneva, that he may have a confe∣rence
with his friend Voltaire, about giv∣ing
the last blow to the Christian super∣stition—He
intends to take shipping here
for Holland or Hamburgh; for it is a
matter of great indifference to him at
what part of the continent he first
lands.</P>
<P>When he was going abroad the last
time, he took his passage in a ship bound
for Leghorn, and his baggage was actu∣ally
embarked. In going down the river
by water, he was by mistake put on board
of another vessel under sail; and, upon
inquiry, understood she was bound to
Petersburgh—“Petersburgh,—Peters∣burgh—(said he)
I don't care if I go
along with you.” He forthwith struck
a bargain with the captain; bought a
couple of shirts of the mate, and was
safe conveyed to the court of Muscovy,
from whence he travelled by land to re∣ceive
his baggage at Leghorn—He is
now more likely than ever to execute a
whim of the same nature; and I will hold
any wager, that as he cannot be supposed
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
to live much longer, according to the
course of nature, his exit will be as odd
as his life has been extravagant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gentleman crossed the sea to France, visited and con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erred with Mr. de Voltaire at Fernay, re∣sumed his old circuit at Genoa, and died in 1767, at the house of Vanini in Florence. Being taken with a suppression of urine, he resolved, in imitation of Pomponius Atticus, to take himself off by abstinence; and this resolution he executed like an ancient Ro∣man. He saw company to the last, cracked his jokes, conversed freely, and entertained his guests with music. On the third day of his fast, he found him∣self entirely freed of his complaint; but refused tak∣ing sustenance. He said the most disagreeable part of the voyage was past, and he should be a cursed fool indeed, to put about ship, when he was just entering the harbour. In these sentiments he persisted, with∣out any marks of affectation, and thus finished his course with such ease and serenity, as would have done honour to the firmest Stoic of antiquity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, to return from one humorist to
another; you must know I have received
benefit, both from the chaly beate and the
sea, and would have used them longer,
had not a most ridiculous adventure, by
making me the town-talk, obliged me to
leave the place; for I can't bear the
thoughts of affording a spectacle to the
multitude—Yesterday morning, at six
o'clock, I went down to the bathing-place,
attended by my servant Clinker,
who waited on the beach as usual—The
wind blowing from the north, and the
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
weather being hazy, the water proved so
chill, that when I rose from my first
plunge, I could not help sobbing and
bawling out, from the effects of the cold.
Clinker, who heard me cry, and saw me
indistinctly a good way without the guide,
buffeting the waves, took it for granted
I was drowning, and rushing into the sea,
clothes and all, overturned the guide in
his hurry to save his master. I had swam
out a few strokes, when hearing a noise,
I turned about and saw Clinker, already
up to his neck, advancing towards me,
with all the wildness of terror in his a∣spect—
Afraid he would get out of his
depth, I made haste to meet him, when,
all of a sudden, he seized me by one ear,
and dragged me bellowing with pain up∣on
the dry beach, to the astonishment of
all the people, men, women, and chil∣dren
there assembled.</P>
<P>I was so exasperated by the pain of my
ear, and the disgrace of being exposed in
such an attitude, that, in the first tran∣sport,
I struck him down; then, run∣ning
back into the sea, took shelter in the
machine where my clothes had been de∣posited.
I soon recollected myself so far
as to do justice to the poor fellow, who,
in great simplicity of heart, had acted
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
from motives of fidelity and affection—
Opening the door of the machine, which
was immediately drawn on shore, I saw
him standing by the wheel, dropping like
a water-work, and trembling from head
to foot; partly from cold, and partly
from the dread of having offended his
master—I made my acknowledgments for
the blow he had received, assured him I
was not angry, and insisted upon his go∣ing
home immediately, to shift his
clothes; a command which he could
hardly find in his heart to execute, so
well disposed was he to furnish the mob
with further entertainment at my ex∣pence.
Clinker's intention was laudable
without all doubt, but, nevertheless, I
am a sufferer by his simplicity—I have
had a burning-heat, and a strange buz∣zing
noise in that ear, ever since it was so
roughly treated; and I cannot walk the
street without being pointed at, as the
monster that was hauled naked a shore
upon the beach—Well, I affirm that fol∣ly
is often more provoking than knavery,
aye and more mischievous too; and whe∣ther
a man had not better choose a sensi∣ble
rogue, than an honest simpleton for
his servant, is no matter of doubt with</P>

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR WATT,</OPENER>
<P>WE made a precipitate retreat from
Scarborough, owing to the excessive de∣licacy
of our 'squire, who cannot bear the
thoughts of being <HI>praetereuntium digito
monstratus.</HI></P>
<P>One morning, while he was bathing in
the sea, his man Clinker took it in his
head that his master was in danger of
drowning; and, in this conceit, plung∣ing
into the water, he lugged him out
naked on the beach, and almost pulled
off his ear in the operation. You may
guess how this atchievement was relish∣ed
by Mr. Bramble, who is impatient,
irascible, and has the most extravavant
ideas of decency and decorum in the
oeconomy of his own person—In the first
ebullition of his choler, he knocked
Clinker down with his fist; but he after∣wards
made him amends for this outrage,
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
and, in order to avoid the further notice
of the people, among whom this incident
had made him remarkable, he resolved
to leave Scarborough next day.</P>
<P>We set out accordingly over the
moors, by the way of Whitby, and be∣gan
our journey betimes, in hopes of
reaching Stockton that night; but in this
hope we were disappointed—In the after∣noon,
crossing a deep gutter, made by a
torrent, the coach was so hard strained,
that one of the irons, which connect the
frame, snapt, and the leather sling on the
same side, cracked in the middle—The
shock was so great, that my sister Liddy
struck her head against Mrs. Tabitha's
nose with such violence that the blood
flowed; and Win Jenkins was darted
through a small window, in that part of
the carriage next the horses, where she
stuck like a bawd in the pillory, till she
was released by the hand of Mr. Bram∣ble.
We were eight miles distant from
any place where we could be supplied
with chaises, and it was impossible to
proceed with the coach, until the da∣mage
should be repaired—In this dilem∣ma,
we discovered a black-smith's forge
on the edge of a small common, about
half a mile from the scene of our disaster,
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
and thither the postilions made shift to
draw the carriage slowly, while the com∣pany
walked a-foot; but we found the
black-smith had been dead some days;
and his wife, who had been lately deli∣vered,
was deprived of her senses, under
the care of a nurse, hired by the parish.
We were exceedingly mortified at this
disappointment, which, however, was
surmounted by the help of Humphry
Clinker, who is a surprising compound
of genius and simplicity. Finding the
tools of the defunct, together with some
coals in the smithy, he unscrewed the
damaged iron in a twinkling, and,
kindling a fire, united the broken pieces
with equal dexterity and dispatch—While
he was at work upon this operation, the
poor woman in the straw, struck with the
well-known sound of the hammer and
anvil, started up, and, notwithstanding
all the nurse's efforts, came running into
the smithy, where, throwing her arms a∣bout
Clinker's neck, “Ah, Jacob!
(cried she) how could you leave me in
such a condition?”</P>
<P>This incident was too pathetic to oc∣casion
mirth—it brought tears into the
eyes of all present. The poor widow was
put to bed again; and we did not leave
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
the village without doing something for
her benefit—Even Tabitha's charity was
awakened on this occasion. As for the
tender-hearted Humphry Clinker, he
hammered the iron and wept at the same
time—But his ingenuity was not confined
to his own province of farrier and black∣smith—it
was necessary to join the
leather sling, which had been broke; and
this service he likewise performed, by
means of a broken awl, which he new-pointed
and ground, a little hemp,
which he spun into lingels, and a few
tacks which he made for the purpose—
Upon the whole, we were in a condition
to proceed in little more than one hour;
but even this delay obliged us to pass the
night at Gisborough—Next day we cross∣ed
the Tees at Stockton, which is a neat
agreeable town; and there we resolved to
dine, with purpose to lie at Durham.</P>
<P>Whom should we meet in the yard,
when we alighted, but Martin the adven∣turer?
Having handed out the ladies,
and conducted them into an apartment,
where he payed his compliments to Mrs.
Tabby, with his usual address, he beg∣ged
leave to speak to my uncle in another
room; and there, in some confusion, he
made an apology for having taken the
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
liberty to trouble him with a letter at
Stevenage. He expressed his hope, that
Mr. Bramble had bestowed some consider∣ation
on his unhappy case, and repeated
his desire of being taken into his ser∣vice.</P>
<P>My uncle, calling me into the room,
told him, that we were both very well in∣clined
to rescue him from a way of life
that was equally dangerous and disho∣nourable;
and that he should have no
scruples in trusting to his gratitude and
fidelity, if he had any employment for
him, which he thought would suit his
qualifications and his circumstances; but
that all the departments he had men∣tioned
in his letter, were filled up by per∣sons
of whose conduct he had no reason
to complain; of consequence he could
not, without injustice, deprive any one
of them of his bread—Nevertheless, he
declared himself ready to assist him in
any feasible project, either with his purse
or credit.</P>
<P>Martin seemed deeply touched at this
declaration—The tear started in his eye,
while he said, in a faultering accent—
“Worthy sir—your generosity oppresses
me—I never dreamed of troubling you
for any pecuniary assistance—indeed I
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
have no occasion—I have been so lucky
at billiards and betting in different
places, at Buxton, Harrigate, Scar∣borough,
and Newcastle races, that
my stock in ready-money amounts to
three hundred pounds, which I would
willingly employ, in prosecuting some
honest scheme of life; but my friend,
justice Buzzard, has set so many
springs for my life, that I am under
the necessity of either retiring imme∣diately
to a remote part of the coun∣try,
where I can enjoy the protection
of some generous patron, or of quit∣ting
the kingdom altogether—It is
upon this alternative that I now beg
leave to ask your advice—I have had
information of all your route, since I
had the honour to see you at Steven∣age;
and, supposing you would come
this way from Scarborough, I came
hither last night from Darlington, to
pay you my respects.”</P>
<P>“It would be no difficult matter to
provide you with an asylum in the
country (replied my uncle); but a life
of indolence and obscurity would not
suit with your active and enterprizing
disposition—I would therefore advise
you to try your fortune in the East Indies
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
—I will give you a letter to a friend in
London, who will recommend you to
the direction, for a commission in the
company's service; and if that cannot
be obtained, you will at least be re∣ceived
as a volunteer—in which case,
you may pay for your passage, and I
shall undertake to procure you such
credentials, that you will not be long
without a commission.”</P>
<P>Martin embraced the proposal with
great eagerness; it was therefore resolv∣ed,
that he should sell his horse, and
take a passage by sea for London, to ex∣ecute
the project without delay—In the
mean time he accompanied us to Dur∣ham,
where we took up our quarters for
the night—Here, being furnished with
letters from my uncle, he took his leave
of us, with strong symptoms of gratitude
and attachment, and set out for Sunder∣land,
in order to embark in the first col∣lier,
bound for the river Thames. He
had not been gone half an hour, when
we were joined by another character,
which promised something extraordinary
—A tall, meagure figure, answering,
with his horse, the description of Don
Quixote mounted on Rozinante, ap∣peared
in the twilight at the inn door,
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
while my aunt and Liddy stood at a win∣dow
in the dining-room—He wore a coat,
the cloth of which had once been scar∣let,
trimmed with Brandenburgs, now
totally deprived of their metal, and he
had holster-caps and housing of the same
stuff and same antiquity. Perceiving la∣dies
at the window above, he endeavour∣ed
to dismount with the most graceful air
he could assume; but the ostler neglect∣ing
to hold the stirrup when he wheeled
off his right foot, and stood with his
whole weight on the other, the girth un∣fortunately
gave way, the saddle turned,
down came the cavalier to the ground,
and his hat and periwig falling off, dis∣played
a head-piece of various colours,
patched and plaistered in a woeful condi∣tion—
The ladies, at the window above,
shrieked with affright, on the supposition
that the stranger had received some not∣able
damage in his fall; but the greatest
injury he had sustained arose from the
dishonour of his descent, aggravated by
the disgrace of exposing the condition of
his cranium; for certain plebeians that
were about the door, laughed aloud, in
the belief that the captain had got either
a scald head, or a broken head, both
equally opprobrious.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="158"/>
He forthwith leaped up in a fury, and
snatching one of his pistols, threatened to
put the ostler to death, when another
squall from the women checked his re∣sentment.
He then bowed to the win∣dow,
while he kissed the butt-end of his
pistol, which he replaced; adjusted his
wig in great confusion, and led his horse
into the stable—By this time I had come
to the door, and could not help gazing
at the strange figure that presented itself
to my view—He would have measured
above six feet in height, had he stood
upright; but he stooped very much; was
very narrow in the shoulders, and very
thick in the calves of his legs, which
were cased in black spatterdashes—As for
his thighs, they were long and slender,
like those of a grasshopper; his face was,
at least, half a yard in length, brown and
shrivelled, with projecting cheek-bones,
little grey eyes on the greenish hue, a
large hook-nose, a pointed chin, a mouth
from ear to ear, very ill furnished with
teeth, and a high, narrow fore-head,
well furrowed with wrinkles. His horse
was exactly in the stile of its rider; a re∣surrection
of dry bones, which (as we af∣terwards
learned) he valued exceeding∣ly,
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
as the only present he had ever receiv∣ed
in his life.</P>
<P>Having seen this favourite steed pro∣perly
accommodated in the stable, he
sent up his compliments to the ladies,
begging permission to thank them in per∣son
for the marks of concern they had
shewn at his disaster in the court-yard—
As the 'squire said they could not de∣sently
decline his visit, he was shewn up
stairs, and paid his respects in the Scotch
dialect, with much formality—“Lad∣dies,
(said he) perhaps ye may be scan∣daleezed
at the appearance my heed
made, when it was uncovered by acci∣dent;
but I can assure you, the con∣dition
you saw it in, is neither the ef∣fects
of disease, nor of drunkenness;
but an honest scar received in the ser∣vice
of my country.” He then gave
us to understand, that having been
wounded at Ticonderoga, in America, a
party of Indians rifled him, scalped him,
broke his scull with the blow of a toma∣hawk,
and left him for dead on the field
of battle; but that being afterwards
found with signs of life, he had been
cured in the French hospital, though the
loss of substance could not be repaired; so
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
that the scull was left naked in several
places, and these he covered with patches.</P>
<P>There is no hold by which an English∣man
is sooner taken than that of com∣passion—We
were immediately interested
in behalf of this veteran—Even Tabby's
heart was melted; but our pity was
warmed with indignation, when we learn∣ed,
that in the course of two sanguinary
wars, he had been wounded, maimed,
mutilated, taken, and enslaved, without
ever having attained a higher rank than
that of lieutenant—My uncle's eyes
gleamed, and his nether lip quivered,
while he exclamed, “I vow to God, sir,
your case is a reproach to the service
—The injustice you have met with is
so flagrant—” “I must crave
your pardon, sir, (cried the other, in∣terrupting
him) I complain of no in∣justice—
I purchased an ensigncy thirty
years ago; and, in the course of ser∣vice,
rose to be a lieutenant, accord∣ing
to my seniority—” “But in such
a length of time, (resumed the 'squire)
you must have seen a great many
young officers put over your head—”
“Nevertheless, (said he) I have no cause
to murmur—They bought their pre∣ferment
with their money—I had no
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
money to carry to market—that was
my misfortune; but no body was to
blame—” “What! no friend to ad∣vance
a sum of money?” (said Mr.
Bramble) “Perhaps, I might have bor∣rowed
money for the purchase of a
company (answered the other); but
that loan must have been refunded;
and I did not chuse to incumber my∣self
with a debt of a thousand pounds,
to be payed from an income of ten
shillings a-day.” “So you have spent
the best part of your life, (cried Mr.
Bramble) your youth, your blood, and
your constitution, amidst the dangers,
the difficulties, the horrors and hard∣ships
of war, for the consideration of
three or four shillings a-day—a consi∣deration—”
“Sir, (replied the Scot,
with great warmth) you are the man
that does me injustice, if you say or
think I have been actuated by any
such paultry consideration—I am a
gentleman; and entered the service as
other gentlemen do, with such hopes
and sentiments as honourable ambition
inspires—If I have not been lucky in
the lottery of life, so neither do I think
myself unfortunate—I owe no man a
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
farthing; I can always command a
clean shirt, a mutton-chop, and a truss
of straw; and when I die, I shall leave
effects sufficient to defray the expence
of my burial.”</P>
<P>My uncle assured him, he had no in∣tention
to give him the least offence, by
the observations he had made; but, on
the contrary, spoke from a sentiment of
friendly regard to his interest—The lieu∣tenant
thanked him with a stiffness of ci∣vility,
which nettled our old gentleman,
who perceived that his moderation was
all affected; for, whatsoever his tongue
might declare, his whole appearance de∣noted
dissatisfaction—In short, without
pretending to judge of his military merit,
I think I may affirm, that this Caledoni∣an
is a self-conceited pedant, aukward,
rude, and disputacious—He has had the
benefit of a school-education, seems to
have read a good number of books, his
memory is tenacious, and he pretends
to speak several different languages; but
he is so addicted to wrangling, that he
will cavil at the clearest truths, and, in
the pride of argumentation, attempt to
reconcile contradictions—Whether his
address and qualifications are really of
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
that stamp which is agreeable to the taste
of our aunt, Mrs. Tabitha, or that inde∣fatigable
maiden is determined to shoot
at every sort of game, certain it is she
has begun to practise upon the heart of
the lieutenant, who favoured us with his
company to supper.</P>
<P>I have many other things to say of this
man of war, which I shall communicate
in a post or two; mean while, it is but
reasonable that you should be indulged
with some respite from those weary lu∣cubrations
of</P>

</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>IN my last I treated you with a high
flavoured dish, in the character of the
Scotch lieutenant, and I must present him
once more for your entertainment. It
was our fortune to feed upon him the
best part of three days; and I do not
doubt that he will start again in our way
before we shall have finished our nor∣thern
excursion. The day after our
meeting with him at Durham proved so
tempestous that we did not choose to
proceed on our journey; and my uncle
persuaded him to stay till the weather
should clear up, giving him, at the same
time, a general invitation to our mess.
The man has certainly gathered a whole
budget of shrewd observations, but he
brings them forth in such an ungracious
manner as would be extremely disgusting,
if it was not marked by that charac∣teristic
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
oddity which never fails to at∣tract
the attention.—He and Mr. Bram∣ble
discoursed, and even disputed, on dif∣ferent
subjects in war, policy, the belles
lettres, law, and metaphysics; and some∣times
they were warmed into such alter∣cation
as seemed to threaten an abrupt
dissolution of their society; but Mr.
Bramble set a guard over his own irasci∣bility,
the more vigilantly as the officer
was his guest; and when, in spite of all
his efforts, he began to wax warm, the
other prudently cooled in the same pro∣portion.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tabitha chancing to accost her
brother by the familiar diminutive of
Matt, “Pray, sir, (said the lieutenant)
is your name Matthias?” You must
know, it is one of our uncle's foibles to
be ashamed of his name Matthew, be∣cause
it is puritanical; and this question
chagrined him so much, that he answered,
“No, by G—d!” in a very abrupt
tone of displeasure.—The Scot took um∣brage
at the manner of his reply, and
bristling up, “If I had known (said he)
that you did not care to tell your name,
I should not have asked the question—
The leddy called you Matt, and I na∣turally
thought it was Matthias:—
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
perhaps, it may be Methuselah, or
Metrodorus, or Metellus, or Mathu∣rinus,
or Malthinnus, or Matamoros,
or—” “No, (cried my uncle
laughing) it is neither of those, captain:
—my name is Matthew Bramble, at
your service.—The truth is, I have a
foolish pique at the name of Matthew,
because it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avours of those canting hypo∣crites,
who, in Cromwell's time, christ∣ened
all their children by names taken
from the scripture.”—“A foolish
pique indeed, (cried Mrs. Tabby) and
even sinful, to fall out with your name
because it is taken from holy writ.—
I would have you to know, you was
called after great-uncle Matthew ap
Madoc ap Meredith, esquire, of Llan∣wysthin,
in Montgomeryshire, justice
of the <HI>quorum,</HI> and <HI>crusty ruttleorum,</HI> a
gentleman of great worth and property,
descended in a strait line, by the fe∣male
side, from Llewellyn, prince of
Wales.”</P>
<P>This genealogical anecdote seemed to
make some impression upon the North-Briton,
who bowed very low to the de∣scendants
of Llewellyn, and observed that
he himself had the honour of a scriptural
nomination. The lady expressing a de∣sire
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
of knowing his address, he said, he
designed himself Lieutenant Obadiah
Lismahago; and, in order to assist her
memory, he presented her with a slip of
paper inscribed with these three words,
which she repeated with great emphasis,
declaring, it was one of the most noble
and sonorous names she had ever heard.
He observed, that Obadiah was an adven∣titious
appellation, derived from his
great-grandfather, who had been one of
the original covenanters; but Lismahago
was the family surname, taken from a
place in Scotland so called. He likewise
dropped some hints about the antiquity
of his pedigree, adding, with a smile of
self-denial, <HI>Sed genus et proav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, et quae
non fecimus ipsi, vix ea nostra v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>co,</HI> which
quotation he explained in deference to the
ladies; and Mrs. Tabitha did not fail to
compliment him on his modesty in wav∣ing
the merit of his ancestry, adding,
that it was the less necessary to him, as he
had such a considerable fund of his own.
She now began to glew herself to his fa∣vour
with the grossest adulation.—She
expatiated upon the antiquity and virtues
of the Scottish nation, upon their valour,
probity, learning, and politeness.—She
even descended to encomiums on his own
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
personal address, his gallantry, good sense,
and erudition.—She appealed to her bro∣ther,
whether the captain was not the
very image of our cousin governor Grif∣fith.—
She discovered a surprising eager∣ness
to know the particulars of his life,
and asked a thousand questions concern∣ing
his atchievements in war; all which
Mr. Lismahago answered with a sort of
jesuitical reserve, affecting a reluctance to
satisfy her curiosity on a subject that con∣cerned
his own exploits.</P>
<P>By dint of her interrogations, however,
we learned, that he and ensign Murphy
had made their escape from the French
hospital at Montreal, and taken to the
woods, in hope of reaching some English
settlement; but mistaking their route,
they fell in with a party of Miamis, who
carried them away in captivity. The in∣tention
of these Indians was to give one
of them as an adopted son to a venerable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>achem, who had lost his own in the
course of the war, and to sacrifice the
other according to the custom of the
country. Murphy, as being the younger
and handsomer of the two, was designed
to fill the place of the deceased, not only
as the son of the sachem, but as the
spouse of a beautiful squaw, to whom his
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
predecessor had been betrothed; but in
passing through the different whigwhams
or villages of the Miamis, poor Murphy
was so mangled by the women and chil∣dren,
who have the privilege of torturing
all prisoners in their passage, that, by the
time they arrived at the place of the sa∣chem's
residence, he was rendered altoge∣ther
unfit for the purposes of marriage:
it was determined therefore, in the assem∣bly
of the warriors, that ensign Murphy
should be brought to the stake, and that
the lady should be given to lieutenant
Lismahago, who had likewise received
his share of torments, though they had
not produced emasculation.—A joint of
one finger had been cut, or rather sawed
off with a rusty knife; one of his great
toes was crushed into a mash betwixt two
stones; some of his teeth were drawn,
or dug out with a crooked nail; splinter∣ed
reeds had been thrust up his nostrils
and other tender parts; and the calves of
his legs had been blown up with mines
of gunpowder dug in the flesh with the
sharp point of the tomahawk.</P>
<P>The Indians themselves allowed that
Murphy died with great heroism, singing,
as his death song, the <HI>Drimmendoo,</HI> in
concert with Mr. Lismahago, who was
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
present at the solemnity. After the war∣riors
and the matrons had made a hearty
meal upon the muscular flesh which they
pared from the victim, and had applied a
great variety of tortures, which he bore
without flinching, an old lady, with a
sharp knife, scooped out one of his eyes,
and put a burning coal in the socket.
The pain of this operation was so exqui∣site
that he could not help bellowing,
upon which the audience raised a shout of
exultation, and one of the warriors steal∣ing
behind him, gave him the <HI>coup de
grace</HI> with a hatchet.</P>
<P>Lismahago's bride, the squaw Squin∣kina
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oosta, distinguished herself on this
occasion.—She shewed a great supe∣riority
of genius in the tortures which
she contrived and executed with her own
hands.—She vied with the stoutest war∣rior
in eating the flesh of the sacrifice;
and after all the other females were fud∣dled
with dram-drinking, she was not so
intoxicated but that she was able to play
the game of the platter with the conjur∣ing
sachem, and afterwards go through
the ceremony of her own wedding, which
was consummated that same evening.
The captain had lived very happily
with this accomplished squaw for two
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
years, during which she bore him a son,
who is now the representative of his mo∣ther's
tribe; but, at length, to his un∣speakable
grief, she had died of a fever,
occasioned by eating too much raw bear,
which they had killed in a hunting ex∣cursion.</P>
<P>By this time, Mr. Lismahago was
elected sachem, acknowledged first war∣rior
of the Badger tribe, and dignified
with the name or epithet of Occacanastao∣garora,
which signifies <HI>nimble as a wea∣sel;</HI>
but all these advantages and honours
he was obliged to resign, in consequence
of being exchanged for the orator of the
community, who had been taken prisoner
by the Indians that were in alliance with
the English. At the peace, he had sold
out upon half-pay, and was returned to
Britain, with a view to pass the rest of
his life in his own country, where he
hoped to find some retreat where his slen∣der
finances would afford him a decent
subsistence. Such are the out-lines of
Mr. Lismahago's history, to which. Ta∣bitha
<HI>did seriously incline her ear;</HI>—indeed,
she seemed to be taken with the same
charms that captivated the heart of
Desdemona, who loved the Moor <HI>for the
dangers he had past.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="172"/>
The description of poor Murphy's suf∣ferings,
which threw my sister Liddy into
a swoon, extracted some sighs from the
breast of Mrs. Tabby: when she under∣stood
he had been rendered unfit for mar∣riage,
she began to spit, and ejaculated,
“Jesus, what cruel barbarians!” and she
made wry faces at the lady's nuptial re∣past;
but she was eagerly curious to
know the particulars of her marriage∣dress;
whether she wore high-breast∣ed
stays or boddice, a robe of silk or
velvet, and laces of Mechlin or minio∣nette—she
supposed, as they were con∣nected
with the French, she used <HI>rouge,</HI>
and had her hair dressed in the Parisian
fashion. The captain would have de∣clined
giving a categorical explanation of
all these particulars, observing, in gene∣ral,
that the Indians were too tenacious
of their own customs to adopt the modes
of any nation whatsoever: he said,
moreover, that neither the simplicity of
their manners, nor the commerce of their
country, would admit of those articles of
luxury which are deemed magnificence in
Europe; and that they were too virtuous
and sensible to encourage the introduction
of any fashion which might help to render
them corrupt and effeminate.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173"/>
These observations served only to in∣flame
her desire of knowing the particu∣lars
about which she had enquired; and,
with all his evasion, he could not help
discovering the following circumstances—
that his princess had neither shoes, stock∣ings,
shift, nor any kind of linen—that
her bridal dress consisted of a petticoat of
red bays, and a fringed blanket, fastened
about her shoulders with a copper skewer;
but of ornaments she had great plenty.—
Her hair was curiously plaited, and inter∣woven
with bobbins of human bone—one
eye-lid was painted green, and the other
yellow; the cheeks were blue, the lips
white, the teeth red, and there was a
black list drawn down the middle of the
forehead as far as the tip of the nose—a
couple of gaudy parrot's feathers were
stuck through the division of the nostrils
—there was a blue stone set in the chin—
her ear-rings consisted of two pieces of
hickery, of the size and shape of drum∣sticks—her
arms and legs were adorned
with bracelets of wampum—her breast glit∣tered
with numerous strings of glass beads
—she wore a curious pouch, or pocket,
of woven grass, elegantly painted with
various colours—about her neck was
hung the fresh scalp of a Mohawk war∣rior,
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
whom her deceased lover had lately
slain in battle—and, finally, she was
anointed from head to foot with bear's
grease, which sent forth a most agreeable
odour.</P>
<P>One would imagine that these para∣phernalia
would not have been much ad∣mired
by a modern fine lady; but Mrs.
Tabitha was resolved to approve of all
the captain's connexions.—She wished,
indeed, the squaw had been better pro∣vided
with linen; but she owned there
was much taste and fancy in her orna∣ments;
she made no doubt, therefore,
that madam Squinkinacoosta was a young
lady of good sense and rare accomplish∣ments,
and a good christian at bottom.
Then she asked whether his consort had
been high-church or low-church, presby∣terian
or anabaptist, or had been favour∣ed
with any glimmering of the new light
of the gospel? When he confessed that
she and her whole nation were utter
strangers to the christian faith, she gazed
at him with signs of astonishment, and
Humphry Clinker, who chanced to be in
the room, uttered a hollow groan.</P>
<P>After some pause, “In the name of
God, captain Lismahago, (cried she)
what religion do they profess?” “As
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
to religion, madam, (answered the
lieutenant) it is among those Indians a
matter of great simplicity—they never
heard of any <HI>Alliance between Church and
State.</HI>—They, in general, worship two
contending principles; one the Foun∣tain
of all Good, the other the source
of evil.—The common people there,
as in other countries, run into the ab∣surdities
of superstition; but sensible
men pay adoration to a Supreme Being,
who created and sustains the universe.”
“O! what pity, (exclaimed the pious
Tabby) that some holy man has not
been inspired to go and convert these
poor heathens!”</P>
<P>The lieutenant told her, that while he
resided among them, two French missio∣naries
arrived, in order to convert them
to the catholic religion; but when they
talked of mysteries and revelations, which
they could neither explain nor authenti∣cate,
and called in the evidence of mira∣cles
which they believed upon hearsay;
when they taught, that the Supreme
Creator of Heaven and Earth had allow∣ed
his only Son, his own equal in power
and glory, to enter the bowels of a wo∣man,
to be born as a human creature,
to be insulted, flagellated, and even exe∣cuted
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
as a malefactor; when they pre∣tended
to create God himself, to swallow,
digest, revive, and multiply him <HI>ad infi∣nitum,</HI>
by the help of a little flour and
water, the Indians were shocked at the im∣piety
of their presumption.—They were
examined by the assembly of the sachems,
who desired them to prove the divinity
of their mission by some miracle.—They
answered, that it was not in their power.
—“If you were really sent by Heaven
for our conversion, (said one of the
sachems) you would certainly have
some supernatural endowments, at least
you would have the gift of tongues, in
order to explain your doctrine to the
different nations among which you are
employed; but you are so ignorant of
our language, that you cannot express
yourselves even on the most trifling
subjects.”</P>
<P>In a word, the assembly were convinced
of their being cheats, and even suspected
them of being spies:—they ordered them
a bag of Indian corn a piece, and ap∣pointed
a guide to conduct them to the
frontiers; but the missionaries having
more zeal than discretion, refused to quit
the vineyard.—They persisted in saying
mass, in preaching, baptizing, and squab∣bling
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
with the conjurers, or priests of the
country, till they had thrown the whole
community into confusion.—Then the
assembly proceeded to try them as im∣pious
impostors, who represented the Al∣mighty
as a trifling, weak, capricious be∣ing,
and pretended to make, unmake,
and reproduce him at pleasure: they
were, therefore, convicted of blasphemy
and sedition, and condemned to the stake,
where they died singing <HI>Salve regina,</HI> in a
rapture of joy, for the crown of martyr∣dom
which they had thus obtained.</P>
<P>In the course of this conversation, lieu∣tenant
Lismahago dropt some hints by
which it appeared he himself was a free∣thinker.
Our aunt seemed to be startled
at certain sarcasms he threw out against
the creed of saint Athanasius.—He dwelt
much upon the words, <HI>reason, philosophy,</HI>
and <HI>contradiction in terms</HI>—he bid defiance
to the eternity of hell-fire; and even
threw such squibs at the immortality of
the soul, as singed a little the whiskers of
Mrs. Tabitha's faith; for, by this time,
she began to look upon Lismahago as a
prodigy of learning and sagacity.—In
short, he could be no longer insensible to
the advances she made towards his affec∣tion;
and although there was something
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
repulsive in his nature, he overcame it so
far as to make some return to her civilities.
—Perhaps, he thought it would be no bad
scheme, in a superannuated lieutenant
on half-pay, to effect a conjunction with
an old maid, who, in all probability, had
fortune enough to keep him easy and
comfortable in the fag-end of his days.—
An ogling correspondence forthwith com∣menced
between this amiable pair of ori∣ginals.—
He began to sweeten the natural
acidity of his discourse with the treacle of
compliment and commendation.—He
from time to time offered her snuff, of
which he himself took great quantities,
and even made her a present of a purse of
silk grass, woven by the hands of the
amiable Squinkinacoosta, who had used
it as a shot-pouch in her hunting-expedi∣tions.</P>
<P>From Doncaster northwards, all the
windows of all the inns are scrawled with
doggrel rhimes, in abuse of the Scotch
nation; and what surprised me very
much, I did not perceive one line written
in the way of recrimination—Curious to
hear what Lismahago would say on this
subject, I pointed out to him a very scur∣rilous
epigram against his countrymen,
which was engraved on one of the win∣dows
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
of the parlour where we sat.—He
read it with the most starched composure;
and when I asked his opinion of the poe∣try,
“It is vara terse and vara poignant;
(said he) but with the help of a wat
dish-clout, it might be rendered more
clear and parspicous.—I marvel much
that some modern wit has not publish∣ed
a collection of these essays under
the title of the <HI>Glazier's Triumph over
Sawney the Scot</HI>—I'm persuaded it
would be a vara agreable offering to
the patriots of London and Westmin∣ster.”
When I expressed some sur∣prize
that the natives of Scotland, who
travel this way, had not broke all the
windows upon the road, “With submis∣sion,
(replied the lieutenant) that were
but shallow policy—it would only serve
to make the satire more cutting and
severe; and, I think, it is much better
to let it stand in the window, than
have it presented in the reckoning.”</P>
<P>My uncle's jaws began to quiver with
indignation.—He said, the scribblers
of such infamous stuff deserved to be
scourged at the cart's tail for disgracing
their country with such monuments of
malice and stupidity.—“These vermin
(said he) do not consider, that they are
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
affording their fellow-subjects, whom
they abuse, continual matter of self-gratulation,
as well as the means of ex∣ecuting
the most manly vengeance that
can be taken for such low, illiberal at∣tacks.
For my part, I admire the
philosophic forbearance of the Scots,
as much as I despise the insolence of
those wretched libellers, which is akin
to the arrogance of the village cock,
who never crows but upon his own
dunghill.” The captain, with an af∣fectation
of candour, observed, that men
of illiberal minds were produced in every
soil; that in supposing those were the
sentiments of the English in general, he
should pay too great a compliment to his
own country, which was not of conse∣quence
enough to attract the envy of such
a flourishing and powerful people.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tabby broke forth again in praise
of his moderation, and declared that
Scotland was the soil which produced eve∣ry
virtue under heaven.—When Lisma∣hago
took his leave for the night, she ask∣ed
her brother if the captain was not the
prettiest gentleman he had ever seen; and
whether there was not something wonder∣fully
engaging in his aspect?—Mr. Bram∣ble
having eyed her some time in silence,
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
“Sister, (said he) the lieutenant is, for
aught I know, an honest man, and a
good officer—he has a considerable
share of understanding, and a title to
more encouragement than he seems to
have met with in life; but I cannot,
with a safe conscience, affirm, that he
is the prettiest gentleman I ever saw; nei∣ther
can I discern any engaging charm
in his countenance, which, I vow to
Gad, is, on the contrary, very hard-favoured
and forbidding.”</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to ingratiate my∣self
with this North-Briton, who is really
a curiosity; but he has been very shy of
my conversation ever since I laughed at
his asserting that the English tongue was
spoke with more propriety at Edinburgh
than at London. Looking at me with a
double squeeze of souring in his aspect,
“If the old definition be true, (said he)
that risibility is the distinguishing cha∣racteristic
of a rational creature, the
English are the most distinguished for
rationality of any people I ever knew”
I owned, that the English were easily
struck with any thing that appeared ludi∣crous,
and apt to laugh accordingly; but
it did not follow, that, because they were
more given to laughter, they had more
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
rationality than their neighbours: I said,
such an inference would be an injury to
the Scots, who were by no means defec∣tive
in rationality, though generally sup∣posed
little subject to the impressions of
humour.</P>
<P>The captain answered, that this suppo∣sition
must have been deduced either from
their conversation or their compositions,
of which the English could not possibly
judge with precision, as they did not un∣derstand
the dialect used by the Scots in
common discourse, as well as in their
works of humour. When I desired to
know what those works of humour were,
he mentioned a considerable number of
pieces, which he insisted were equal in
point of humour to any thing extant in
any language dead or living.—He, in
particular, recommended a collection of
detached poems, in two small volumes,
intituled, <HI>The Ever-green,</HI> and the works
of Allan Ramsay, which I intend to pro∣vide
myself with at Edinburgh.—He ob∣served,
that a North-Briton is seen to a dis∣advantage
in an English company, because
he speaks in a dialect that they can't relish,
and in a phraseology which they don't un∣derstand.—
He therefore finds himself un∣der
a restraint, which is a great enemy to
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
wit and humour.—These are faculties
which never appear in full lustre, but
when the mind is perfectly at ease, and,
as an excellent writer says, enjoys <HI>her
elbow-room.</HI></P>
<P>He proceeded to explain his assertion
that the English language was spoken with
greater propriety at Edinburgh than in
London.—He said, what we generally
called the Scottish dialect was, in fact,
true, genuine old English, with a mixture
of some French terms and idioms, adopt∣ed
in a long intercourse betwixt the
French and Scotch nations; that the mo∣dern
English, from affectation and false
refinement, had weakened, and even cor∣rupted
their language, by throwing out
the guttural sounds, altering the pronun∣ciation
and the quantity, and disusing
many words and terms of great signifi∣cance.
In consequence of these innova∣tions,
the works of our best poets, such as
Chaucer, Spenser, and even Shakespeare,
were become, in many parts, unintelligi∣ble
to the natives of South-Britain, where∣as
the Scots, who retain the antient lan∣guage,
understand them without the help
of a glossary. “For instance, (said he)
how have your commentators been
puzzled by the following expression in
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
the <HI>Tempest—He's gentle, and not fearful;</HI>
as if it was a paralogism to say, that
being <HI>gentle,</HI> he must of course be <HI>cou∣rageous:</HI>
but the truth is, one of the
original meanings, if not the sole mean∣ing,
of that word was, <HI>noble, high-minded;</HI>
and to this day, a Scotch wo∣man,
in the situation of the young lady
in the <HI>Tempest,</HI> would express herself
nearly in the same terms—Don't pro∣voke
him; for being gentle, that is,
<HI>high spirited,</HI> he won't tamely bear an
insult. Spenser, in the very first stanza
of his <HI>Fairy Queen,</HI> says,”</P>
<P>A <HI>gentle</HI> knight was pricking on the plain;”
“which knight, far from being <HI>tame</HI> and
fearful, was so stout that”</P>
<P>“Nothing did he dread, but ever was ydr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.”</P>
<P>To prove that we had impaired the
energy of our language by false refine∣ment,
he mentioned the following words,
which, though widely different in signifi∣cation,
are pronounced exactly in the
same manner—<HI>wright, write, right, rite;</HI>
but among the Scots, these words are as
different in pronunciation, as they are in
meaning and orthography; and this is the
case with many others which he mention∣ed
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
by way of illustration.—He, more∣over,
took notice, that we had (for what
reason he could never learn) altered the
sound of our vowels from that which is
retained by all the nations in Europe; an
alteration which rendered the language
extremely difficult to foreigners, and
made it almost impracticable to lay
down general rules for orthography and
pronunciation. Besides, the vowels were
no longer simple sounds in the mouth of
an Englishman, who pronounced both <HI>i</HI>
and <HI>u</HI> as diphthongs. Finally, he affirmed,
that we mumbled our speech with our
lips and teeth, and ran the words toge∣ther
without pause or distinction, in such
a manner, that a foreigner, though he un∣derstood
English tolerably well, was often
obliged to have recourse to a Scotchman
to explain what a native of England had
said in his own language.</P>
<P>The truth of this remark was confirmed
by Mr. Bramble from his own expe∣rience;
but he accounted for it on another
principle.—He said, the same observa∣tion
would hold in all languages; that a
Swiss talking French was more easily un∣derstood
than a Parisian, by a foreigner
who had not made himself master of the
language; because every language had
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
its peculiar recitative, and it would always
require more pains, attention, and practice,
to acquire both the words and the music,
than to learn the words only; and yet no
body would deny, that the one was im∣perfect
without the other: he therefore
apprehended, that the Scotchman and the
Swiss were better understood by learners,
because they spoke the words only, with∣out
the music, which they could not re∣hearse.
One would imagine this check
might have damped the North-Briton;
but it served only to agitate his humour
for disputation.—He said, if every
nation had its own recitative or music,
the Scots had theirs, and the Scotchman
who had not yet acquired the cadence of
the English, would naturally use his own
in speaking their language; therefore, if
he was better understood than the native,
his recitative must be more intelligible
than that of the English; of consequence,
the dialect of the Scots had an advantage
over that of their fellow-subjects, and
this was another strong presumption that
the modern English had corrupted their
language in the article of pronunciation.</P>
<P>The lieutenant was, by this time, be∣come
so polemical, that every time he
opened his mouth out flew a paradox,
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
which he maintained with all the enthu∣siasm
of altercation; but all his paradoxes
savoured strong of a partiality for his own
country. He undertook to prove that
poverty was a blessing to a nation; that
<HI>oatmeal</HI> was preferable to <HI>wheat-flour;</HI> and
that the worship of Cloacina, in temples
which admitted both sexes, and every
rank of votaries promiscuously, was a fil∣thy
species of idolatry that outraged
every idea of delicacy and decorum. I
did not so much wonder at his broaching
these doctrines, as at the arguments,
equally whimsical and ingenious, which
he adduced in support of them.</P>
<P>In fine, lieutenant Lismahago is a cu∣riosity
which I have not yet sufficiently
perused; and therefore I shall be sorry
when we lose his company, though, God
knows, there is nothing very amiable in
his manner or disposition.—As he goes
directly to the south-west division of
Scotland, and we proceed in the road to
Berwick, we shall part to-morrow at a
place called Felton-bridge; and, I dare
say, this separation will be very grievous
to our aunt Mrs. Tabitha, unless she has
received some flattering assurance of his
meeting her again. If I fail in my pur∣pose
of entertaining you with these un∣important

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To DR. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now reached the northern
extremity of England, and see, close to
my chamber-window, the Tweed gliding
through the arches of that bridge which
connects this suburb to the town of Ber∣wick.—
Yorkshire you have seen, and
therefore I shall say nothing of that opu∣lent
province. The city of Durham ap∣pears
like a confused heap of stones and
brick, accumulated so as to cover a
mountain, round which a river winds its
brawling course. The streets are gene∣rally
narrow, dark, and unpleasant, and
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
many of them almost impassible in conse∣quence
of their declivity. The cathedral
is a huge gloomy pile; but the clergy are
well lodged.—The bishop lives in a
princely manner—the golden prebends
keep plentiful tables—and, I am told,
there is some good sociable company in
the place; but the country, when viewed
from the top of Gateshead Fell, which ex∣tends
to Newcastle, exhibits the highest
scene of cultivation that ever I beheld.
As for Newcastle, it lies mostly in a bot∣tom,
on the banks of the Tyne, and
makes an appearance still more disagree∣able
than that of Durham; but it is ren∣dered
populous and rich by industry and
commerce; and the country lying on both
sides the river, above the town, yields a
delightful prospect of agriculture and
plantation. Morpeth and Alnwick are
neat, pretty towns, and this last is fa∣mous
for the castle which has belonged so
many ages to the noble house of Piercy,
earls of Northumberland.—It is, doubt∣less,
a large edifice, containing a great
number of apartments, and stands in a
commanding situation; but the strength
of it seems to have consisted not so much
in its site, or the manner in which it is for∣tified,
as in the valour of its defendants.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190"/>
Our adventures since we left Scarbo∣rough,
are scarce worth reciting; and yet
I must make you acquainted with my
sister Tabby's progress in husband-hunt∣ing,
after her disappointments at Bath and
London. She had actually begun to
practise upon a certain adventurer, who
was in fact a highwayman by profession;
but he had been used to snares much more
dangerous than any she could lay, and
escaped accordingly.—Then she opened
her batteries upon an old weather-beaten
Scotch lieutenant, called Lismahago, who
joined us at Durham, and is, I think,
one of the most singular personages I ever
encountered.—His manner is as harsh as
his countenance; but his peculiar turn of
thinking, and his pack of knowledge
made up of the remnants of rarities, ren∣dered
his conversation desirable, in spite
of his pedantry and ungracious address.
—I have often met with a crab-apple in a
hedge, which I have been tempted to eat
for its flavour, even while I was disgust∣ed
by its austerity. The spirit of con∣tradiction
is naturally so strong in Lisma∣hago,
that I believe in my conscience he
has rummaged, and read, and studied
with indefatigable attention, in order to
qualify himself to refute established max∣ims,
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
and thus raise trophies for the grati∣fication
of polemical pride.—Such is the
asperity of his self-conceit, that he will
not even acquiesce in a transient compli∣ment
made to his own individual in parti∣cular,
or to his country in general.</P>
<P>When I observed, that he must have
read a vast number of books to be able to
discourse on such a variety of subjects,
he declared he had read little or nothing,
and asked how he should find books
among the woods of America, where he
had spent the greatest part of his life. My
nephew remarking that the Scots in ge∣neral
were famous for their learning, he
denied the imputation, and defied him to
prove it from their works.—“The Scots
(said he) have a slight tincture of let∣ters,
with which they make a parade
among people who are more illiterate
than themselves; but they may be said
to float on the surface of science, and
they have made very small advances
in the useful arts.” “At least, (cried
Tabby) all the world allows that the
Scots behaved gloriously in fighting
and conquering the savages of Ameri∣ca.”
“I can assure you, madam, you
have been misinformed; (replied the
lieutenant) in that continent the Scots
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
did nothing more than their duty, nor
was there one corps in his majesty's ser∣vice
that distinguished itself more than
another.—Those who affected to extol
the Scots for superior merit, were no
friends to that nation.”</P>
<P>Though he himself made free with his
countrymen, he would not suffer any
other person to glance a sarcasm at them
with impunity. One of the company
chancing to mention lord B—'s inglo∣rious
peace, the lieutenant immediately
took up the cudgels in his lordship's fa∣vour,
and argued very strenuously to
prove that it was the most honourable
and advantageous peace that England
had ever made since the foundation of the
monarchy.—Nay, between friends, he of∣fered
such reasons on this subject, that I
was really confounded, if not convinced.
—He would not allow that the Scots
abounded above their proportion in the
army and navy of Great-Britain, or that
the English had any reason to say his
countrymen had met with extraordinary
encouragement in the service.—“When
a South and North-Briton (said he) are
competitors for a place or commission,
which is in the disposal of an English
minister or an English general, it would
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
be absurd to suppose that the prefe∣rence
will not be given to the native
of England, who has so many advan∣tages
over his rival.—First and fore∣most,
he has in his favour that laudable
partiality, which, Mr. Addison says,
never fails to cleave to the heart of an
Englishman; secondly, he has more
powerful connexions, and a greater
share of parliamentary interest, by
which those contests are generally de∣cided;
and lastly, he has a greater
command of money to smooth the way
to his success. For my own part, (said
he) I know no Scotch officer, who has
risen in the army above the rank of a
subaltern, without purchasing every de∣gree
of preferment either with money
or recruits; but I know many gentle∣men
of that country, who, for want of
money and interest, have grown grey
in the rank of lieutenants; whereas
very few instances of this ill-fortune
are to be found among the natives of
South-Britain.—Not that I would in∣sinuate
that my countrymen have the
least reason to complain.—Preferment
in the service, like success in any other
branch of traffic, will naturally favour
those who have the greatest stock of
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
cash and credit, merit and capacity be∣ing
supposed equal on all sides.”</P>
<P>But the most hardy of all this original's
positions were these:—That commerce
would, sooner or later, prove the ruin of
every nation, where it flourishes to any ex∣tent—
that the parliament was the rotten
part of the British constitution—that the
liberty of the press was a national evil—
and that the boasted institution of juries,
as managed in England, was productive
of shameful perjury and flagrant injustice.
He observed, that traffick was an enemy
to all the liberal passions of the soul,
founded on the thirst of lucre, a sordid
disposition to take advantage of the ne∣cessities
of our fellow-creatures.—He
affirmed, the nature of commerce was such,
that it could not be fixed or perpetuated,
but, having flowed to a certain height,
would immediately begin to ebb, and so
continue till the channels should be left
almost dry; but there was no instance of
the tide's rising a second time to any con∣siderable
influx in the same nation. Mean
while the sudden affluence occasioned by
trade, forced open all the sluices of luxury
and overflowed the land with every spe∣cies
of profligacy and corruption; a total
pravity of manners would ensue, and this
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
must be attended with bankruptcy and
ruin. He observed of the parliament,
that the practice of buying boroughs, and
canvassing for votes, was an avowed
system of venality, already established on
the ruins of principle, integrity, faith,
and good order, in consequence of which
the elected and the elector, and, in short,
the whole body of the people, were
equally and universally contaminated and
corrupted. He affirmed, that of a par∣liament
thus constituted, the crown
would always have influence enough to
secure a great majority in its dependence,
from the great number of posts, places,
and pensions it had to bestow; that such
a parliament would (as it had already
done) lengthen the term of its sitting and
authority, whenever the prince should
think it for his interest to continue the
representatives; for, without doubt, they
had the same right to protract their au∣thority
<HI>ad infinitum,</HI> as they had to extend
it from three to seven years.—With a
parliament, therefore, dependent upon
the crown, devoted to the prince, and
supported by a standing army, garbled
and modelled for the purpose, any king
of England may, and probably some am∣bitious
sovereign will, totally overthrow
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
all the bulwarks of the constitution; for
it is not to be supposed that a prince of a
high spirit will tamely submit to be
thwarted in all his measures, abused and
insulted by a populace of unbridled fero∣city,
when he has it in his power to crush
all opposition under his feet with the con∣currence
of the legislature. He said, he
should always consider the liberty of the
press as a national evil, while it enabled
the vilest reptile to soil the lustre of the
most shining merit, and furnished the
most infamous incendiary with the means
of disturbing the peace and destroying the
good order of the community. He own∣ed,
however, that, under due restrictions,
it would be a valuable privilege; but af∣firmed,
that at present there was no law in
England sufficient to restrain it within
proper bounds.</P>
<P>With respect to juries, he expressed
himself to this effect:—Juries are ge∣nerally
composed of illiterate plebeians,
apt to be mistaken, easily misled, and open
to sinister influence; for if either of the
parties to be tried, can gain over one of
the twelve jurors, he has secured the ver∣dict
in his favour; the juryman thus
brought over will, in despight of all evi∣dence
and conviction, generally hold out
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
till his fellows are fatigued, and harrassed,
and starved into concurrence; in which
case the verdict is unjust, and the jurors
are all perjured: but cases will often oc∣cur,
when the jurors are really divided in
opinion, and each side is convinced in op∣position
to the other; but no verdict will
be received, unless they are unanimous,
and they are all bound, not only in con∣science,
but by oath, to judge and declare
according to their conviction.—What
then will be the consequence?—They
must either starve in company, or one side
must sacrifice their conscience to their
convenience, and join in a verdict which
they believe to be false, This absurdity
is avoided in Sweden, where a bare ma∣jority
is sufficient; and in Scotland, where
two thirds of the jury are required to
concur in the verdict.</P>
<P>You must not imagine that all these
deductions were made on his part, with∣out
contradiction on mine.—No—the truth
is, I found myself piqued in point of ho∣nour,
at his pretending to be so much
wiser than his neighbours.—I questioned
all his assertions, started innumerable ob∣jections,
argued and wrangled with un∣common
perseverance, and grew very
warm, and even violent, in the debate.—
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
Sometimes he was puzzled, and once or
twice, I think, fairly refuted; but from
those falls he rose again, like Antaeus,
with redoubled vigour, til at length I was
tired, exhausted, and really did not know
how to proceed, when luckily he dropped
a hint, by which he discovered he had
been bred to the law; a confession which
enabled me to retire from the dispute
with a good grace, as it could not be
supposed that a man like me, who had
been bred to nothing, should be able to
cope with a veteran in his own profession.
I believe, however, that I shall for some
time continue to chew the cud of reflec∣tion
upon many observations which this
original discharged.</P>
<P>Whether our sister Tabby was really
struck with his conversation, or is resolved
to throw at every thing she meets in the
shape of a man, till she can fasten the ma∣trimonial
noose, certain it is, she has
taken desperate strides towards the affec∣tion

that, for his part, his company would be
of very little service to us in our progress,
as he was utterly unacquainted with the
country, which he had left in his early youth,
consequently, he could neither direct us
in our inquiries, nor introduce us to any
family of distinction. He said, he was sti∣mulated
by an irresistible impulse to revisit
the <HI>paternus la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or <HI>patria domus,</HI> though he
expected little satisfaction, inasmuch as he
understood that his nephew, the present
possessor, was but ill qualified to support
the honour of the family.—He assured us,
however, as we design to return by the
west road, that he will watch our motions,
and endeavour to pay his respects to us at
Dumfries.—Accordingly he took his
leave of us at a place half way betwixt
Morpeth and Alnwick, and pranced away
in great state, mounted on a tall, meagre,
raw-boned, shambling grey gelding, with∣out
e'er a tooth in his head, the very
counter-part of the rider; and, indeed,
the appearance of the two was so pic∣turesque,
that I would give twenty gui∣neas
to have them tolerably represented on
canvas.</P>

Northumberland is a fine county, ex∣tending
to the Tweed, which is a pleasant
pastoral stream; but you will be surprised
when I tell you that the English side of
that river is neither so well cultivated nor
so populous as the other.—The farms are
thinly scattered, the lands uninclosed, and
scarce a gentleman's seat is to be seen in

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. at
Oxon.
DEAR WAT,</OPENER>
<P>IN my two last you had so much of
Lismahago, that I suppose you are glad
he is gone off the stage for the present.—
I must now descend to domestic occur∣rences.—Love,
it seems, is resolved to
assert his dominion over all the females
of our family.—After having practised
upon poor Liddy's heart, and played
strange vagaries with our aunt Mrs. Ta∣bitha,
he began to run riot in the affec∣tions
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
of her woman Mrs. Winifred Jen∣kins,
whom I have had occasion to men∣tion
more than once in the course of our
memoirs. Nature intended Jenkins for
something very different from the charac∣ter
of her mistress; yet custom and habit
have effected a wonderful resemblance
betwixt them in many particulars. Win,
to be sure, is much younger and more
agreeable in her person; she is likewise
tender-hearted and benevolent, qualities
for which her mistress is by no means re∣markable,
no more than she is for being
of a timorous disposition, and much sub∣ject
to fits of the mother, which are the
infirmities of Win's constitution: but
then she seems to have adopted Mrs. Tab∣by's
manner with her cast cloaths.—She
dresses and endeavours to look like her
mistress, although her own looks are much
more engaging.—She enters into her
scheme of oeconomy, learns her phrases,
repeats her remarks, imitates her stile in
scolding the inferior servants, and, finally,
subscribes implicitly to her system of de∣votion—This,
indeed, she found the
more agreeable, as it was in a great mea∣sure
introduced and confirmed by the mi∣nistry
of Clinker, with whose personal
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
merit she seems to have been struck ever
since he exhibited the pattern of his
naked skin at Marlborough.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, though Humphry had
this double hank upon her inclinations,
and exerted all his power to maintain the
conquest he had made, he found it im∣possible
to guard it on the side of vanity,
where poor Win was as frail as any fe∣male
in the kingdom. In short, my ras∣cal
Dutton professed himself her admirer,
and, by dint of his outlandish qualifica∣tions,
threw his rival Clinker out of the
saddle of her heart. Humphry may be
compared to an English pudding, compos∣ed
of good wholesome flour and suet, and
Dutton to a syllabub or iced froth, which,
though agreeable to the taste, has nothing
solid or substantial. The traitor not only
dazzled her with his second-hand finery,
but he fawned, and flattered, and cringed
—he taught her to take rappee, and pre∣sented
her with a snuff-box of <HI>papier ma∣ché</HI>—he
supplied her with a powder for
her teeth—he mended her complexion,
and he dressed her hair in the Paris fashion
—he undertook to be her French master
and her dancing-master, as well as friseur,
and thus imperceptibly wound himself
into her good graces. Clinker perceived
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
the progress he had made, and repined in
secret.—He attempted to open her eyes
in the way of exhortation, and finding it
produced no effect had recourse to prayer.
At Newcastle, while he attended Mrs.
Tabby to the methodist meeting, his rival
accompanied Mrs. Jenkins to the play.
He was dressed in a silk coat, made at
Paris for his former master, with a tawdry
waistcoat of tarnished brocard; he wore
his hair in a great bag with a huge soli∣taire,
and a long sword dangled from his
thigh. The lady was all of a flutter with
faded lutestring, washed gauze, and rib∣bons
three times refreshed; but she was
most remarkable for the frisure of her
head, which rose, like a pyramid, seven
inches above the scalp, and her face was
primed and patched from the chin up to
the eyes; nay, the gallant himself had
spared neither red nor white in improving
the nature of his own complexion. In
this attire, they walked together through
the high street to the theatre, and as they
passed for players ready dressed for act∣ing,
they reached it unmolested; but as
it was still light when they returned, and
by that time the people had got informa∣tion
of their real character and condition,
they hissed and hooted all the way, and
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
Mrs. Jenkins was all bespattered with
dirt, as well as insulted with the oppro∣brious
name of <HI>painted Jezabel,</HI> so that her
fright and mortification threw her into an
hysteric fit the moment she came home.</P>
<P>Clinker was so incensed at Dutton,
whom he considered as the cause of her
disgrace, that he upbraided him severely
for having turned the poor young wo∣man's
brain. The other affected to treat
him with contempt, and mistaking his
forbearance for want of courage, threaten∣ed
to horse-whip him into good manners.
Humphry then came to me, humbly beg∣ing
I would give him leave to chastise
my servant for his insolence—“He has
challenged me to fight him at sword's
point; (said he) but I might as well
challenge him to make a horse-shoe,
or a plough-iron; for I know no more
of the one than he does of the other.—
Besides, it doth not become servants to
use those weapons, or to claim the pri∣vilege
of gentlemen to kill one another
when they fall out; moreover, I would
not have his blood upon my conscience
for ten thousand times the profit or sa∣tisfaction
I should get by his death;
but if your honour won't be angry,
I'll engage to gee en a good drubbing,
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
that, may hap, will do 'en service, and
I'll take care it shall do 'en no harm.”
I said, I had no objection to what he pro∣posed,
provided he could manage matters
so as not to be found the aggressor, in
case Dutton should prosecute him for an
assault and battery.</P>
<P>Thus licensed, he retired; and that
same evening easily provoked his rival to
strike the first blow, which Clinker return∣ed
with such interest that he was obliged
to call for quarter, declaring, at the same
time, that he would exact severe and
bloody satisfaction the moment we should
pass the border, when he could run him
through the body without fear of the
consequence.—This scene passed in
presence of lieutenant Lismahago, who
encouraged Clinker to hazard a thrust of
cold iron with his antagonist. “Cold
iron (cried Humphry) I shall never use
against the life of any human creature;
but I am so far from being afraid of
his cold iron, that I shall use nothing
in my defence but a good cudgel, which
shall always be at his service.” In the
mean time, the fair cause of this contest,
Mrs. Winifred Jenkins, seemed over∣whelmed
with affliction, and Mr. Clinker
acted much on the reserve, though he
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
did not presume to find fault with her
conduct.</P>
<P>The dispute between the two rivals
was soon brought to a very unexpected
issue. Among our fellow-lodgers at Ber∣wick,
was a couple from London, bound
to Edinburgh, on the voyage of matri∣mony.
The female was the daughter and
heiress of a pawn-broker deceased, who
had given her guardians the slip, and put
herself under the tuition of a tall Hiber∣nian,
who had conducted her thus far in
quest of a clergyman to unite them in
marriage, without the formalities requir∣ed
by the law of England. I know not
how the lover had behaved on the road,
so as to decline in the favour of his inna∣morata;
but, in all probability, Dutton
perceived a coldness on her side, which
encouraged him to whisper, it was a pity
she should have cast her affections upon a
taylor, which he affirmed the Irishman to
be. This discovery completed her dis∣gust,
of which my man taking the advan∣tage,
began to recommend himself to her
good graces, and the smooth-tongued ras∣cal
found no difficulty to insinuate himself
into the place of her heart, from which
the other had been discarded—Their re∣solution
was immediately taken. In the
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
morning, before day, while poor Teague
lay snoring a-bed, his indefatigable rival
ordered a post-chaise, and set out with the
lady for Coldstream, a few miles up the
Tweed, where there was a parson who
dealt in this branch of commerce, and
there they were noosed, before the Irish∣man
ever dreamt of the matter. But
when he got up at six o'clock, and found
the bird was flown, he made such a noise
as alarmed the whole house. One of the
first persons he encountered, was the pos∣tilion
returned from Coldstream, where he
had been witness to the marriage, and
over and above an handsome gratuity, had
received a bride's favour, which he now
wore in his cap—When the forsaken lover
understood they were actually married,
and set out for London; and that Dut∣ton
had discovered to the lady, that he
(the Hibernian) was a taylor, he had like
to have run distracted. He tore the rib∣bon
from the fellow's cap, and beat it
about his ears. He swore he would pur∣sue
him to the gates of hell, and ordered a
post-chaise and four to be got ready as
soon as possible; but, recollecting that his
finances would not admit of this way of
travelling, he was obliged to countermand
this order.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209"/>
For my part, I knew nothing at all of
what had happened, till the postilion
brought me the keys of my trunk and
portmanteau, which he had received
from Dutton, who sent me his respects,
hoping I would excuse him for his abrupt
departure, as it was a step upon which his
fortune depended—Before I had time to
make my uncle acquainted with this event,
the Irishman burst into my chamber,
without any introduction, exclaiming,—
“By my soul, your sarvant has robbed
me of five thousand pounds, and I'll
have satisfaction, if I should be
hanged to-morrow.—” When I ask∣ed
him who he was, “My name (said
he) is Master Macloughlin—but it
should be Leighlin Oneale, for I am
come from Ter-Owen the Great; and so
I am as good a gentleman as any in
Ireland; and that rogue, your sarvant,
said I was a taylor, which was as big a
lie as if he had called me the pope—
I'm a man of fortune, and have spent
all I had; and so being in distress, Mr.
Coshgrave, the fashioner in Shuffolk∣street,
tuck me out, and made me his
own private shecretary: by the same
token, I was the last he bailed; for his
friends obliged him to tie himself up,
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
that he would bail no more above ten
pounds; for why, becaase as how, he
could not refuse any body that asked,
and therefore in time would have rob∣bed
himself of his whole fortune, and,
if he had lived long at that rate, must
have died bankrupt very soon—and so
I made my addresses to Miss Skinner,
a young lady of five thousand pounds
fortune, who agreed to take me for
better nor worse; and, to be sure, this
day would have put me in possession, if
it had not been for that rogue, your
sarvant, who came like a tief, and stole
away my property, and made her be∣lieve
I was a taylor; and that she was
going to marry the ninth part of a man:
but the devil burn my soul, if ever I
catch him on the mountains of Tullo∣ghobegly,
if I don't shew him that I'm
nine times as good a man as he, or e'er
a bug of his country.”</P>
<P>When he had rung out his first alarm, I
told him I was sorry he had allowed himself
to be so jockied; but it was no business of
mine; and that the fellow who robbed
him of his bride, had likewise robbed me
of my servant—“Didn't I tell you then,
(cried he,) that Rogue was his true
Christian name.—Oh if I had but one
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
fair trust with him upon the sod, I'd
give him lave to brag all the rest of his
life.”</P>
<P>My uncle hearing the noise, came in,
and being informed of this adventure,
began to comfort Mr. Oneale for the la∣dy's
elopement; observing that he seem∣ed
to have had a lucky escape, that it was
better she should elope before, than after
marriage—The Hibernian was of a very
different opinion. He said, “If he had
been once married, she might have
eloped as soon as she pleased; he would
have taken care that she should not
have carried her fortune along with
her—Ah (said he) she's a Judas Iscariot,
and has betrayed me with a kiss; and,
like Judas, she carried the bag, and
has not left me money enough to bear
my expences back to London; and so
as I'm come to this pass, and the rogue
that was the occasion of it has left you
without a sarvant, you may put me in
his place; and by Jasus, it is the best
thing you can do.—” I begged to be
excused, declaring I could put up with
any inconvenience, rather than treat as a
footman the descendant of Tir-Owen the
Great. I advised him to return to his
friend, Mr. Cosgrave, and take his pas∣sage
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
from Newcastle by sea, towards
which I made him a small present, and he
retired, seemingly resigned to his evil for∣tune.
I have taken upon trial a Scotchman,
called Archy M 'Alpin, an old soldier,
whose last master, a colonel, lately died at
Berwick. The fellow is old and wither∣ed;
but he has been recommended to me
for his fidelity, by Mrs. Humphreys, a
very good sort of a woman, who keeps
the inn at Tweedmouth, and is much re∣spected
by all the travellers on this road.</P>
<P>Clinker, without doubt, thinks himself
happy in the removal of a dangerous ri∣val,
and he is too good a Christian, to re∣pine
at Dutton's success. Even Mrs. Jen∣kins
will have reason to congratulate her∣self
upon this event, when she cooly re∣flects
upon the matter; for, howsoever
she was forced from her poise for a sea∣son,
by snares laid for her vanity, Hum∣phrey
is certainly the north-star to which
the needle of her affection would have
pointed at the long run. At present, the
same vanity is exceedingly mortified, up∣on
finding herself abandoned by her new
admirer, in favour of another innamorata.
She received the news with a violent burst
of laughter, which soon brought on a fit
of crying; and this gave the finishing
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
blow to the patience of her mistress, which
had held out beyond all expectation. She
now opened all those floodgates of repre∣hension,
which had been shut so long.
She not only reproached her with her le∣vity
and indiscretion, but attacked her on
the score of religion, declaring roundly
that she was in a state of apostacy and re∣probation;
and finally, threatened to send
her a-packing at this extremity of the
kingdom. All the family interceded for
poor Winifrid, not even excepting her
slighted swain, Mr. Clinker, who, on his
knees, implored and obtained her pardon.</P>
<P>There was, however, another conside∣ration
that gave Mrs. Tabitha some dis∣turbance.
At Newcastle, the servants
had been informed by some wag, that
there was nothing to eat in Scotland, but
<HI>oat-meal</HI> and <HI>sheep's-heads;</HI> and Lieutenant
Lismahago being consulted, what he said
served rather to confirm than to refute the
report. Our aunt being apprised of this
circumstance, very gravely advised her
brother to provide a sumpter horse with
store of hams, tongues, bread, biscuit,
and other articles for our subsistence, in
the course of our peregrination, and Mr.
Bramble as gravely replied, that he would
take the hint into consideration: but, find∣ing
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
no such provision was made, she now
revived the proposal, observing that there
was a tolerable market at Berwick, where
we might be supplied; and that my man's
horse would serve as a beast of burthen—
The 'squire, shrugging up his shoulders,
eyed her askance with a look of inef∣fable
contempt; and, after some pause,
“Sister, (said he) I can hardly per∣suade
myself you are serious.” She
was so little acquainted with the geo∣graphy
of the island, that she ima∣gined
we could not go to Scotland but by
sea; and, after we had passed through the
town of Berwick, when he told her we
were upon Scottish ground, she could
hardly believe the assertion—If the truth
must be told, the South Britons in gene∣ral
are woefully ignorant in this particu∣lar.
What, between want of curiosity,
and traditional sarcasms, the effect of an∣cient
animosity, the people at the other
end of the island know as little of Scot∣land
as of Japan.</P>
<P>If I had never been in Wales, I should
have been more struck with the manifest
difference in appearance betwixt the pea∣sants
and commonalty on different sides
of the Tweed. The boors of Northum∣berland
are lusty fellows, fresh comple∣xioned,
cleanly, and well cloathed; but
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
the labourers in Scotland are generally
lank, lean, hard-featured, sallow, soiled,
and shabby, and their little pinched blue
caps have a beggarly effect. The cattle
are much in the same stile with their driv∣ers,
meagre, stunted, and ill equipt.
When I talked to my uncle on this sub∣ject,
he said, “Though all the Scottish
hinds would not bear to be compared
with those of the rich counties of South
Britain, they would stand very well in
competition with the peasants of France,
Italy, and Savoy—not to mention the
mountaineers of Wales, and the red-shanks
of Ireland.”</P>
<P>We entered Scotland by a frightful
moor of sixteen miles, which promises
very little for the interior parts of the
kingdom; but the prospect mended as
we advanced. Passing through Dunbar,
which is a neat little town, situated on the
sea-side, we lay at a country inn, where
our entertainment far exceeded our ex∣pectation;
but for this we cannot give
the Scots credit, as the landlord is a native
of England. Yesterday we dined at Had∣dington,
which has been a place of some
consideration, but is now gone to decay;
and in the evening arrived at this metro∣polis,
of which I can say very little. It
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
is very romantic, from its situation on the de∣clivity
of a hill, having a fortified castle
at the top, and a royal palace at the bot∣tom.
The first thing that strikes the nose
of a stranger, shall be nameless; but
what first strikes the eye, is the unconscion∣able
height of the houses, which gene∣rally
rise to five, six, seven, and eight
stories, and, in some places, (as I am as∣sured)
to twelve. This manner of build∣ing,
attended with numberless inconve∣niences,
must have been originally owing
to want of room. Certain it is, the town
seems to be full of people: but their
looks, their language, and their customs,
are so different from ours, that I can
hardly believe myself in Great-Bri∣tain.</P>
<P>The inn at which we put up, (if it
may be so called) was so filthy and dis∣agreeable
in all respects, that my uncle be∣gan
to fret, and his gouty symptoms to
recur—Recollecting, however, that he
had a letter of recommendation to one
Mr. Mitchelson, a lawyer, he sent it by
his servant, with a compliment, import∣ing
that he would wait upon him next
day in person; but that gentleman visit∣ed
us immediately, and insisted upon our
going to his own house, until he could
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
provide lodgings for our accommodation.
We gladly accepted of his invitation, and
repaired to his house, where we were
treated with equal elegance and hospitali∣ty,
to the utter confusion of our aunt,
whose prejudices, though beginning to give
way, were not yet entirely removed. To∣day,
by the assistance of our friend, we are
settled in convenient lodgings, up four
pair of stairs, in the High-street, the
fourth story being, in this city, reckoned
more genteel than the first. The air is,
in all probability, the better; but it re∣quires
good lungs to breathe it at this dis∣tance
above the surface of the earth.—
While I do remain above it, whether high∣er
or lower, provided I breathe at all,</P>

</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>THAT part of Scotland contiguous
to Berwick, nature seems to have intend∣ed
as a barrier between two hostile na∣tions.
It is a brown desert of considera∣ble
extent, that produces nothing but
heath and fern; and what rendered it the
more dreary when we passed, there was
a thick fog that hindered us from seeing
above twenty yards from the carriage—
My sister began to make wry faces, and
use her smelling-bottle; Liddy looked
blank, and Mrs. Jenkins dejected; but in
a few hours these clouds were dissipated;
the sea appeared upon our right, and on
the left the mountains retired a little,
leaving an agreeable plain betwixt them
and the beach; but, what surprised us
all, this plain, to the extent of several
miles, was covered with as fine wheat as
ever I saw in the most fertile parts of
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
South Britain—This plentiful crop is
raised in the open field, without any in∣closure,
or other manure than the <HI>alga
marina,</HI> or sea-weed, which abounds on
this coast; a circumstance which shews
that the soil and climate are favourable;
but that agriculture in this country is not
yet brought to that perfection which it
has attained in England. Inclosures
would not only keep the grounds warm,
and the several fields distinct, but would al∣so
protect the crop from the high winds,
which are so frequent in this part of the
island.</P>
<P>Dunbar is well situated for trade, and
has a curious bason, where ships of small
burthen may be perfectly secure; but
there is little appearance of business in
the place—From thence, all the way to
Edinburgh, there is a continual succes∣sion
of fine seats, belonging to noblemen
and gentlemen; and as each is surround∣ed
by its own parks and plantation, they
produce a very pleasing effect in a coun∣try
which lies otherwise open and expos∣ed.
At Dunbar there is a noble park,
with a lodge, belonging to the Duke of
Roxburgh, where Oliver Cromwell had
his head-quarters, when Lesley, at the
head of a Scotch army, took possession
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
of the mountains in the neighbourhood,
and hampered him in such a manner,
that he would have been obliged to em∣bark
and get away by sea, had not the fa∣naticism
of the enemy forfeited the ad∣vantage
which they had obtained by their
general's conduct—Their ministers, by
exhortation, prayer, assurance, and pro∣phecy,
instigated them to go down and
slay the Philistines in Gilgal, and they
quitted their ground accordingly, not∣withstanding
all that Lesley could do to
restrain the madness of their enthusiasm
—When Oliver saw them in motion,
he exclaimed, “Praised be the Lord, he
hath delivered them into the hands of
his servant!” and ordered his troops to
sing a psalm of thanksgiving, while they
advanced in order to the plain, where
the Scots were routed with great slaugh∣ter.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Haddington,
there is a gentleman's house, in the build∣ing
of which, and the improvements a∣bout
it, he is said to have expended forty
thousand pounds: but I cannot say I was
much pleased with either the architec∣ture
or the situation; though it has in
front a pastoral stream, the banks of
which are laid out in a very agreeable
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
manner. I intended to pay my respects
to lord Elibank, whom I had the honour
to know at London many years ago. He
lives in this part of Lothian; but was
gone to the North, on a visit—You have
often heard me mention this nobleman,
whom I have long revered for his huma∣nity
and universal intelligence, over and
above the entertainment arising from the
originality of his character—At Mussel∣burgh,
however, I had the good-fortune
to drink tea with my old friend Mr. Car∣donel;
and at his house I met with Dr.
C—, the parson of the parish, whose
humour and conversation inflamed me
with a desire of being better acquainted
with his person—I am not at all surprised
that these Scots make their way in every
quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>This place is but four miles from
Edinburgh, towards which we proceeded
along the sea-shore, upon a firm bottom
of smooth sand, which the tide had left
uncovered in its retreat—Edinburgh,
from this avenue, is not seen to much
advantage—We had only an imperfect
view of the Castle and upper parts of the
town, which varied incessantly according
to the inflexions of the road, and exhibit∣ed
the appearance of detached spires and
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
turrets, belonging to some magnificent
edifice in ruins. The palace of Holy∣rood
house stands on the left, as you en∣ter
the Canongate—This is a street con∣tinued
from hence to the gate called Ne∣ther
Bow, which is now taken away; so
that there is no interruption for a long
mile, from the bottom to the top of the
hill on which the Castle stands in a most
imperial situation—Considering its fine
pavement, its width, and the lofty houses
on each side, this would be undoubtedly
one of the noblest streets in Europe, if
an ugly mass of mean buildings, called
the Lucken-Booths, had not thrust itself,
by what accident I know not, into the
middle of the way, like Middle-Row in
Holborn. The city stands upon two hills,
and the bottom between them; and, with
all its defects, may very well pass for
the capital of a moderate kingdom—It is
full of people, and continually resounds
with the noise of coaches and other carri∣ages,
for luxury as well as commerce.
As far as I can perceive, here is no want
of provisions—The beef and mutton are
as delicate here as in Wales; the sea af∣fords
plenty of good fish; the bread is
remarkably fine; and the water is excel∣lent,
though I'm afraid not in sufficient
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
quantity to answer all the purposes of
cleanliness and convenience; articles in
which, it must be allowed, our fellow-sub∣jects
are a little defective—The water is
brought in leaden pipes from a mountain
in the neighbourhood, to a cistern on the
Castle-hill, from whence it is distributed
to public conduits in different parts of
the city—From these it is carried in bar∣rels,
on the backs of male and female por∣ters,
up two, three, four, five, six, se∣ven,
and eight pair of stairs, for the use
of particular families—Every story is a
complete house, occupied by a separate
family; and the stair being common to
them all, is generally left in a very filthy
condition; a man must tread with great
circumspection to get <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>afe housed with
unpolluted shoes—Nothing can form a
stronger contrast, than the difference be∣twixt
the outside and inside of the door;
for the good-women of this metropolis
are remarkably nice in the ornaments and
propriety of their apartments as if they
were resolved to transfer the imputation
from the individual to the public. You
are no stranger to their method of dis∣charging
all their impurities from their
windows, at a certain hour of the night,
as the custom is in Spain, Portugal, and
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
some parts of France and Italy—A prac∣tice
to which I can by no mear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s be re∣conciled;
for notwithstanding all the care
that is taken by their scavengers to re∣move
this nuisance every morning by
break of day, enough still remains to of∣fend
the eyes, as well as other organs of
those whom use has not ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dened against
all delicacy of sensation.</P>
<P>The inhabitants seem insensible to these
impressions, and are apt to imagine the
disgust that we avow is little better than
affectation; but they ought to have some
compassion for strangers, who have not been
Used to this kind of sufferance; and consi∣der,
whether it may not be worth while to
take some pains to vindicate themselves
from the reproach that, on this account,
they bear among their neighbours. As to
the surprising height of their houses, it is
absurd in many respects; but in one par∣ticular
light I cannot view it without hor∣ror;
that is, the dreadful situation of all
the families above, in case the common
stair case should be rendered impassable
by a fire in the lower stories—In order to
prevent the shocking consequences that
must attend such an accident, it would be
a right measure to open doors of commu∣nication
from one house to another, on
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
every story, by which the people might
fly from such a terrible visitation. In all
parts of the world, we see the force of
habit prevailing over all the dictates of
convenience and sagacity—All the peo∣ple
of business at Edinburgh, and even
the genteel company, may be seen stand∣ing
in crowds every day, from one to two
in the afternoon, in the open street, at a
place where formerly stood a market∣cross,
which (by the bye) was a curious
piece of Gothic architecture, still to be
seen in lord Sommerville's garden in this
neighbourhood—I say, the people stand
in the open street from the force of cus∣tom,
rather than move a few yards to an
Exchange that stands empty on one side,
or to the Parliament-close on the other,
which is a noble square, adorned with a
fine equestrian statue of king Charles II.
—The company thus assembled, are en∣tertained
with a variety of tunes, played
upon a set of bells, fixed in a steeple hard
by—As these bells are well-toned, and
the musician, who has a salary from the
city, for playing upon them with keys,
is no bad performer, the entertainment
is really agreeable, and very striking to
the ears of a stranger.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="226"/>
The public inns of Edinburgh, are
still worse than those of London; but by
means of a worthy gentleman, to whom I
was recommended, we have got decent
lodgings in the house of a widow gentle∣woman,
of the name of Lockhart; and
here I shall stay until I have seen every
thing that is remarkable in and about
this capital. I now begin to feel the good
effects of exercise—I eat like a farmer,
sleep from mid-night till eight in the
morning without interruption, and enjoy
a constant tide of spirits, equally distant
from inanition and excess; but whatever
ebbs or flows my constitution may un∣dergo,
my heart will still declare that
I am,</P>

<OPENER>To Mrs. MARY JONES, at Bramble∣ton-hall.
DEAR MARY,</OPENER>
<P>THE 'squire has been so kind as to
rap my bit of nonsense under the kiver
of his own sheet—O, Mary Jones! Mary
Jones! I have had trials and trembula∣tion.
God help me! I have been a vixen
and a griffin these many days—Sattin has
had power to temp me in the shape of
van Ditton, the young 'squire's wally de
shamble; but by God's grease he did not
purvail—I thoft as how, there was no arm
in going to a play at Newcastle, with my
hair dressed in the Parish fashion; and as
for the trifle of paint, he said as how my
complexion wanted rouch, and so I let
him put it on with a little Spanish owl;
but a mischievous mob of colliers, and
such promiscous ribble rabble, that
could bare no smut but their own, attack∣ed
us in the street, and called me <HI>hoar</HI>
and <HI>painted Issabel,</HI> and splashed my
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
close, and spoiled me a complete set of
blond lace triple ruffles, not a pin the
worse for the ware—They cost me seven
good sillings, to lady Griskin's woman
at London.</P>
<P>When I axed Mr. Clinker what they
meant by calling me Issabel, he put the
byebill into my hand, and I read of van
Issabel a painted harlot, that vas thrown
out of a vindore, and the dogs came and
licked her blood—But I am no harlot;
and, with God's blessing, no dog shall
have my poor blood to lick: marry,
Heaven forbid, amen! As for Ditton,
after all his courting, and his compli∣ment,
he stole away an Irishman's bride,
and took a French leave of me and his
master; but I vally not his going a fart∣ing;
but I have had hanger on his ac∣count—Mistriss
scoulded like mad; thof
I have the comfit that all the family took
my part, and even Mr. Clinker pleaded
for me on his bended knee; thof, God he
knows, he had raisins enuff to com∣plain;
but he's a good sole, abounding
with Christian meekness, and one day will
meet with his reward.</P>
<P>And now, dear Mary, we have got to
Haddingborrough, among the Scots, who
are civil enuff for our money, thof I
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
don't speak their lingo—But they should
not go for to impose upon foreigners; for
the bills in their houses say, they have
different <HI>eas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ments</HI> to let; and behold
there is nurro geaks in the whole king∣dom,
nor any thing for poor sarvants,
but a barrel with a pair of tongs thrown
a cross; and all the chairs in the family
are emptied into this here barrel once a-day;
and at ten o'clock at night the
whole cargo is flung out of a back win∣dore
that looks into some street or lane,
and the maid calls <HI>gardy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to the passen∣gers,
which signifies <HI>Lord have mercy up∣on
you!</HI> and this is done every night in
every house in Haddingborrough; so you
may guess, Mary Jones, what a sweet sa∣vour
comes from such a number of pro∣fuming
pans; but they say it is wholsome,
and, truly, I believe it is; for being in
the vapours, and thinking of Issabel and
Mr. Clinker, I was going into a fit of
astericks, when this fiff, saving your pre∣sence,
took me by the nose so powerfully
that I sneezed three times, and found my∣self
wonderfully refreshed; and this to be
sure is the raisin why there are no sits in
Haddingborrough.</P>
<P>I was likewise made believe, that there
was nothing to be had but <HI>oat-meal</HI> and
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
<HI>seeps-heads;</HI> but if I hadn't been a fool,
I mought have known there could be no
<HI>heads</HI> without kerkasses—This very
blessed day I dined upon a delicate leg of
Velsh mutton and cully-flower; and as
for the oat-meal, I leave that to the sar∣vants
of the country, which are pore
drudges, many of them without shoes or
stockings—Mr. Clinker tells me here is a
great call of the gospel; but I wish, I
wish some of our family be not fallen off
from the rite way—O, if I was given to
tail-baring, I have my own secrets to dis∣cover—There
has been a deal of hug∣gling
and flurtation betwixt mistress and
an ould Scots officer, called Kismycago.
He looks for all the orld like the scare∣crow
that our gardener set up to frite a∣way
the sparrows; and what will come of
it, the Lord nows; but come what will,
it shall never be said that I menchioned a
syllabub of the matter—Remember me
kindly to Saul and the kitten—I hope
they got the horn-buck, and will put it to
a good yuse, which is the constant prayer
of,</P>

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUB>t</SUB>. of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>IF I stay much longer at Edinburgh,
I shall be changed into a down-right Cale∣donian—My
uncle observes, that I have
already acquired something of the coun∣try
accent. The people here are so soci∣al
and attentive in their civilities to stran∣gers,
that I am insensibly sucked into the
channel of their manners and customs,
although they are in fact much more dif∣ferent
from ours than you can imagine—
That difference, however, which struck
me very much at my first arrival, I now
hardly perceive, and my ear is perfectly
reconciled to the Scotch accent, which I
find even agreeable in the mouth of a
pretty woman—It is a sort of Doric dia∣lect,
which gives an idea of amiable sim∣plicity—You
cannot imagine how we
have been caressed and feasted in the
<HI>good town of Edinburgh,</HI> of which we are
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
become free denizens and guild bro∣thers,
by the special favour of the ma∣gistracy.</P>
<P>I had a whimsical commission from
Bath, to a citizen of this metropolis—
Quin, understanding our intention to vi∣sit
Edinburgh, pulled out a guinea, and
desired the favour I would drink it at a
tavern, with a particular friend and bot∣tle-companion
of his, one Mr. R—C—,
a lawyer of this city—I charged myself
with the commission, and, taking the
guinea, “You see (said I) I have pocket∣ed
your bounty.” “Yes (replied
Quin, laughing); and a head-ake in∣to
the bargain, if you drink fair.” I
made use of this introduction to Mr.
C—, who received me with open arms,
and gave me the rendezvous, according
to the cartel. He had provided a company
of jolly fellows, among whom I found
myself extremely happy; and did Mr.
C—and Quin all the justice in my
power; but, alas, I was no more than a
tiro among a troop of veterans, who had
compassion upon my youth, and convey∣ed
me home in the morning, by what
means I know not—Quin was mistaken,
however, as to the head-ake; the claret
was too good to treat me so roughly.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="233"/>
While Mr. Bramble holds conferences
with the graver literati of the place, and
our females are entertained at visits by
the Scotch ladies, who are the best and
kindest creatures upon earth, I pass my
time among the bucks of Edinburgh;
who, with a great share of spirit and vi∣vacity,
have a certain shrewdness and
self-command that is not often found
among their neighbours, in the high-day
of youth and exultation—Not a hint
escapes a Scotchman that can be inter∣preted
into offence by any individual in
the company; and national reflections are
never heard—In this particular, I must
own, we are both unjust and ungrateful
to the Scots; for, as far as I am able to
judge, they have a real esteem for the na∣tives
of South-Britain; and never men∣tion
our country, but with expressions of
regard—Nevertheless, they are far from
being servile imitators of our modes and
fashionable vices. All their customs and
regulations of public and private oecono∣my,
of business and diversion, are in their
own stile. This remarkably predomi∣nates
in their looks, their dress, and man∣ner,
their music, and even their cookery.
Our 'squire declares, that he knows not
another people upon earth, so strongly
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
marked with a national character—Now
we are upon the article of cookery, I
must own, some of their dishes are savou∣ry,
and even delicate; but I am not yet
Scotchman enough to relish their singed
sheep's-head and haggice, which were
provided at our request, one day at Mr.
Mitchelson's, where we dined—The first
put me in mind of the history of Congo,
in which I had read of negros' heads sold
publickly in the markets; the last, being
a mess of minced lights, livers, suet, oat-meal,
onions, and pepper, inclosed in a
sheep's stomach, had a very sudden effect
upon mine, and the delicate Mrs. Tabby
changed colour; when the cause of our
disgust was instantaneously removed at
the nod of our entertainer. The Scots,
in general, are attached to this composi∣tion,
with a sort of national fondness, as
well as to their oat-meal bread; which is
presented at every table, in thin triangu∣lar
cakes, baked upon a plate of iron,
called a girdle; and these, many of the
natives, even in the higher ranks of life,
prefer to wheaten-bread, which they have
here in perfection—You know we used to
vex poor Murray of Baliol-college, by
asking, if there was really no fruit but
turnips in Scotland?—Sure enough, I
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
have seen turnips make their appearance,
not as a desert, but by way of <HI>hors d'
oeuvres,</HI> or whets, as radishes are served
up betwixt more substantial dishes in
France and Italy; but it must be observ∣ed,
that the turnips of this country are
as much superior in sweetness, delicacy,
and flavour, to those of England, as a
musk-melon is to the stock of a common
cabbage. They are small and conical, of
a yellowish colour, with a very thin skin;
and, over and above their agreeable taste,
are valuable for their antiscorbutic qua∣lity—As
to the fruit now in season, such
as cherries, gooseberries, and currants,
there is no want of them at Edinburgh;
and in the gardens of some gentlemen,
who live in this neighbourhood, there is
now a very favourable appearance of apri∣cots,
peaches, nectarines, and even
grapes: nay, I have seen a very fine
shew of pine-apples within a few miles
of this metropolis. Indeed, we have no
reason to be surprised at these particulars,
when we consider how little difference
there is, in fact, betwixt this climate and
that of London.</P>
<P>All the remarkable places in the city
and its avenues, for ten miles around, we
have visited, much to our satisfaction. In
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
the Castle are some royal apartments,
where the sovereign occasionally resided;
and here are carefully preserved the re∣galia
of the kingdom, consisting of a
crown, said to be of great value, a scep∣tre,
and a sword of state, adorned with
jewels—Of these symbols of sovereignty,
the people are exceedingly jealous—A
report being spread, during the sitting of
the union-parliament, that they were re∣moved
to London, such a tumult arose,
that the lord commissioner would have
been torn in pieces, if he had not pro∣duced
them for the satisfaction of the po∣pulace.</P>
<P>The palace of Holyrood house is an
elegant piece of architecture, but sunk in
an obscure, and, as I take it, unwhole∣some
bottom, where one would imagine
it had been placed on purpose to be con∣cealed.
The apartments are lofty, but
unfurnished; and as for the pictures of
the Scottish kings, from Fergus I. to
king William▪ they are paultry daubings,
mostly by the same hand, painted either
from the imagination, or porters hired
to sit for the purpose. All the diversions
of London we enjoy at Edinburgh, in a
small compass. Here is a well-conduct∣ed
concert, in which several gentlemen
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
perform on different instruments—The
Scots are all musicians—Every man you
meet plays on the flute, the violin, or
violoncello; and there is one nobleman,
whose compositions are universally ad∣mired—Our
company of actors is very
tolerable; and a subscription is now on
foot for building a new theatre; but their
assemblies please me above all other pub∣lic
exhibitions.</P>
<P>We have been at the hunters ball,
where I was really astonished to see such
a number of fine women—The English,
who have never crossed the Tweed, ima∣gine
erroneously, that the Scotch ladies
are not remarkable for personal attrac∣tions;
but, I can declare with a safe con∣science,
I never saw so many handsome
females together, as were assembled on
this occasion. At the Leith races, the
best company comes hither from the re∣moter
provinces; so that, I suppose, we
had all the beauty of the kingdom con∣centrated
as it were into one focus;
which was, indeed, so vehement, that
my heart could hardly resist its power—
Between friends, is has sustained some
damage from the bright eyes of the
charming miss R—n, whom I had the
honour to dance with at the ball—The
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
countess of Melvile attracted all eyes,
and the admiration of all present—She
was accompanied by the agreeable miss
Grieve, who made many conquests; nor
did my sister Liddy pass unnoticed in the
assemby—She is become a toast at Edin∣burgh,
by the name of the Fair Cam∣brian,
and has already been the occasion
of much wine-shed; but the poor girl
met with an accident at the ball, which
has given us great disturbance.</P>
<P>A young gentleman, the express image
of that rascal Wilson, went up to ask her
to dance a minuet; and his sudden ap∣pearance
shocked her so much, that she
fainted away—I call Wilson a rascal, be∣cause,
if he had been really a gentleman,
with honourable intentions, he would
have, ere now, appeared in his own cha∣racter—I
must own, my blood boils with
indignation when I think of that fellow's
presumption; and Heaven confound me
if I don't—But I won't be so womanish as
to rail—Time will, perhaps, furnish oc∣casion—Thank
God, the cause of Lid∣dy's
disorder remains a secret. The lady
directress of the ball, thinking she was
overcome by the heat of the place, had
her conveyed to another room, where
she soon recovered so well, as to return
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
and join in the country-dances, in which
the Scotch lasses acquit themselves with
such spirit and agility, as put their par∣ners
to the height of their mettle—I be∣lieve
our aunt, Mrs. Tabitha, had en∣tertained
hopes of being able to do some
execution among <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he cavaliers at this as∣sembly—She
had been several days in
consultation with milliners and mantua∣makers,
preparing for the occasion, at
which she made her appearance in a full
suit of damask, so thick and heavy, that
the sight of it alone, at this season of the
year, was sufficient to draw drops of sweat
from any man of ordinary imagination—
She danced one minuet with our friend,
Mr. Mitchelson, who favoured her so far,
in the spirit of hospitality and politeness;
and she was called out a second time by
the young laird of Ballymawhawple, who,
coming in by accident, could not readily
find any other partner; but as the first
was a married man, and the second pay∣ed
no particular homage to her charms,
which were also over-looked by the rest
of the company, she became dissatisfied
and censorious—At supper, she observed
that the Scotch gentlemen made a very
good figure, when they were a little im∣proved
by travelling; and therefore it
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
was pity they did not all take the benefit
of going abroad—She said the women
were aukward, masculine creatures; that,
in dancing, they lifted their legs like so
many colts; that they had no idea of
graceful motion, and put on their clothes
in a frightful manner; but if the truth
must be told, Tabby herself was the most
ridiculous figure, and the worst dressed
of the whole assembly—The neglect of
the male sex rendered her malcontent
and peevish; she now found fault with
every thing at Edinburgh, and teized her
brother to leave the place, when she was
suddenly reconciled to it on a religious
consideration—There is a sect of fana∣ticks,
who have separated themselves
from the established kirk, under the name
of Seceders—They acknowledge no earth∣ly
head of the church, reject lay-patron∣age,
and maintain the methodist doctrines
of the new birth, the new light, the ef∣ficacy
of grave, the insufficiency of works,
and the operations of the spirit. Mrs.
Tabitha, attended by Humphry Clinker,
was introduced to one of their conven∣ticles,
where they both received much e∣dification;
and she has had the good
fortune to come acquainted with a pious
Christian, called Mr. Moffat, who is very
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
powerful in prayer, and often assists her
in private exercises of devotion.</P>
<P>I never saw such a concourse of gen∣teel
company at any races in England, as
appeared on the course of Leith—Hard
by, in the fields called the Links, the
citizens of Edinburgh divert themselves
at a game called golf, in which they use
a curious kind of bats, tipt with horn,
and small elastic balls of leather, stuffed
with feathers, rather less than tennis
balls, but of a much harder consistence
—This they strike with such force and
dexterity from one hole to another, that
they will fly to an incredible distance. Of
this diversion the Scots are so fond, that
when the weather will permit, you may
see a multitude of all ranks, from the se∣nator
of justice to the lowest tradesmen,
mingled together in their shirts, and fol∣lowing
the balls with the utmost eager∣ness—Among
others, I was shewn one
particular set of golfers, the youngest of
whom was turned of fourscore—They
were all gentlemen of independent for∣tunes,
who had amused themselves with
this pastime for the best part of a cen∣tury,
without having ever felt the least
alarm from sickness or disgust; and they
never went to bed, without having each
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
the best part of a gallon of claret in his
belly. Such uninterrupted exercise, co∣operating
with the keen air from the
sea, must, without all doubt, keep the
appetite always on edge, and steel the con∣stitution
against all the common attacks
of distemper.</P>
<P>The Leith races gave occasion to an∣other
entertainment of a very singular na∣ture—There
is at Edinburgh a society or
corporation of errand-boys, called caw∣dies,
who ply in the streets at night with
paper lanthorns, and are very service∣able
in carrying messages—These fellows,
though shabby in their appearance, and
rudely familiar in their address, are won∣derfully
acute, and so noted for fidelity,
that there is no instance of a cawdy's hav∣ing
betrayed his trust—Such is their in∣telligence,
that they know, not only eve∣ry
individual of the place, but also every
stranger, by that time he has been four
and twenty hours in Edinburgh; and no
transaction, even the most private, can
escape their notice—They are particular∣ly
famous for their dexterity in executing
one of the functions of Mercury; though,
for my own part, I never employed them
in this department of business—Had I oc∣casion
for any service of this nature, my
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
own man Archy M'Alpine, is as well
qualified as e'er a cawdie in Edinburgh;
and I am much mistaken, if he has not
been heretofore of their fraternity. Be
that as it may, they resolved to give a
dinner and a ball at Leith, to which they
formally invited all the young noblemen
and gentlemen that were at the races;
and this invitation was reinforced by an
assurance that all the celebrated ladies of
pleasure would grace the entertainment
with their company.—I received a card
on this occasion, and went thither with
half a dozen of my acquaintance.—In a
large hall the cloth was laid on a long
range of tables joined together, and here
the company seated themselves, to the
number of about fourscore, lords, and
lairds, and other gentlemen, courtezans
and cawdies mingled together, as the
slaves and their masters were in the time
of the Saturnalia in ancient Rome.—The
toastmaster, who sat at the upper end,
was one Cawdie Fraser, a veteran pimp,
distinguished for his humour and sagacity,
well known and much respected in his
profession by all the guests, male and fe∣male,
that were here assembled.—He had
bespoke the dinner and the wine: he had
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
taken care that all his brethren should ap∣pear
in decent apparel and clean linen;
and he himself wore a periwig with three
tails, in honour of the festival—I assure
you the banquet was both elegant and
plentiful, and seasoned with a thousand
sallies, that promoted a general spirit of
mirth and good humour.—After the de∣sert,
Mr. Fraser proposed the following
toasts, which I don't pretend to explain.—
“The best in Christendom.”—“Gibb's
contract.”—“The beggar's bennison.”
—“King and kirk.”—“Great-Britain
and Ireland.”—Then, filling a
bumper, and turning to me, “Mester
Malford, (said he) may a' unkindness
cease betwixt John Bull and his sister
Moggy.”—The next person he singled
out, was a nobleman who had been
long abroad.—“Ma lord, (cried Fraser)
here is a bumper to a' those noblemen
who have virtue enough to spend their
rents in their ain countray.”—He af∣terwards
addressed himself to a member
of parliament in these words:—“Mester
—I'm sure ye'll ha' nae objection to my
drinking, Disgrace and dule to ilka
Scot, that sells his conscience and his
vote.”—He discharged a third sarcasm
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
at a person very gaily dressed, who had
risen from small beginnings, and made a
considerable fortune at play.—Filling his
glass, and calling him by name, “Lang
life (said he) to the wylie loon that
gangs a-field with a toom poke at his
lunzie, and comes hame with a sack∣ful
of siller.”—All these toasts being
received with loud bursts of applause,
Mr. Fraser called for pint glasses, and
filled his own to the brim: then standing
up, and all his brethren following his ex∣ample,
“Ma lords and gentlemen (cried
he), here is a cup of thanks for the
great and undeserved honour you have
done your poor errand-boys this day.”
—So saying, he and they drank off their
glasses in a trice, and, quitting their seats,
took their station each behind one of the
other guests;—exclaiming, “Noo we're
your honours cawdies again.”</P>
<P>The nobleman who had bore the first
brunt of Mr. Fraser's satire, objected to
his abdication. He said, as the company
was assembled by invitation from the
cawdies, he expected they were to be en∣tertained
at their expence. “By no
means, my lord, (cried Fraser) I wad
na be guilty of sic presumption for the
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
wide warld—I never affronted a gen∣tleman
since I was born; and sure at
this age, I wonnot offer an indignity to
sic an honourable convention.” “Well,
(said his Lordship) as you have expend∣ed
some wit, you have a right to save
your money. You have given me good
counsel, and I take it in good part. As
you have voluntarily quitted your seat,
I will take your place with the leave of
the good company, and think myself
happy to be hailed, <HI>Father of the Feast.</HI>”
He was forthwith elected into the chair,
and complimented in a bumper in his new
character.</P>
<P>The claret continued to circulate with∣out
interruption, till the glasses seemed to
dance upon the table, and this, perhaps,
was a hint to the ladies to call for music—
At eight in the evening the ball began in
another apartment: at midnight we went
to supper; but it was broad day before I
found the way to my lodgings; and, no
doubt, his Lordship had a swinging bill
to discharge.</P>
<P>In short, I have lived so riotously for
some weeks, that my uncle begins to be
alarmed on the score of my constitution,
and very seriously observes, that all his
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
own infirmities are owing to such excesses
indulged in his youth—Mrs. Tabitha says
it would be more for the advantage of my
soul as well as body, if, instead of fre∣quenting
these scenes of debauchery, I
would accompany Mr. Moffat and her to
hear a sermon of the reverend Mr.
M'Corkindale.—Clinker often exhorts
me, with a groan, to take care of my
precious health; and even Archy M'Al∣pine,
when he happens to be overtaken,
(which is oftener the case than I could
wish) reads me a long lecture upon tem∣perance
and sobriety; and is so very wise
and sententious, that, if I could provide
him with a professor's chair, I would will∣ingly
give up the benefit of his admoni∣tions
and service together; for I was tutor∣sick
at alma mater.</P>
<P>I am not, however, so much engrossed
by the ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eties of Edinburgh, but that I
find time to make parties in the family
way.—We have not only seen all the vil∣las
and villages within ten miles of the ca∣pital,
but we have also crossed the Firth,
which is an arm of the sea seven miles
broad, that divides Lothian from the
shire, or, as the Scots call it, the
<HI>kingdom of Fife.</HI> There is a number of
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
large open sea-boats that ply on this pas∣sage
from Leith to Kinghorn, which is a
borough on the other side. In one of
these our whole family embarked three
days ago, excepting my sister, who, being
exceedingly fearful of the water, was left
to the care of Mrs. Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chelson. We had
an easy and quick passage into Fife, where
we visited a number of poor towns on the
sea-side, including St. Andrew's, which is
the skeleton of a venerable city; but we
were much better pleased with some noble
and elegant seats and castles, of which
there is a great number in that part of
Scotland. Yesterday we took boat again
on our return to Leith, with fair wind and
agreeable weather; but we had not ad∣vanced
half-way when the sky was sud∣denly
overcast, and the wind changing,
blew directly in our teeth; so that we
were obliged to turn, or tack the rest of
the way. In a word, the gale increased
to a storm of wind and rain, attended with
such a fog, that we could not see the
town of Leith, to which we were bound,
nor even the castle of Edinburgh, not∣withstanding
its high situation. It is not
to be doubted but that we were all alarm∣ed
on this occasion. And at the same
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
time, most of the passengers were seized
with a nausea that produced violent retch∣ings.
My aunt desired her brother to
order the boatmen to put back to King∣horn,
and this expedient he actually pro∣posed;
but they assured him there was no
danger. Mrs. Tabitha finding them ob∣stinate,
began to scold, and insisted upon
my uncle's exerting his authority as a
justice of the peace. Sick and peevish as
he was, he could not help laughing at this
wise proposal, telling her, that his com∣mission
did not extend so far, and, if it
did, he should let the people take their
own way; for he thought it would be
great presumption in him to direct them
in the exercise of their own profession.
Mrs. Winifred Jenkins made a general
clearance with the assistance of Mr. Hum∣phrey
Clinker, who joined her both in
prayer and ejaculation.—As he took it for
granted that we should not be long in this
world, he offered some spiritual consola∣tion
to Mrs. Tabitha, who rejected it with
great disgust, bidding him keep his ser∣mons
for those who had leisure to hear
such nonsense.—My uncle sat, recollected
in himself, without speaking; my man
Archy had recourse to a brandy-bottle,
with which he made so free, that I ima∣gined
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
he had sworn to die of drinking
any thing rather than sea-water: but the
brandy had no more effect upon him in
the way of intoxication, than if it had
been sea water in good earnest.—As for
myself, I was too much engrossed by the
sickness at my stomach, to think of any
thing else.—Meanwhile the sea swelled
mountains high, the boat pitched with
such violence, as if it had been going to
pieces; the cordage rattled, the wind
roa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed; the lightning flashed, the thun∣der
be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>owed, and the rain descended in
a deluge—Every time the vessel was put
about, we ship'd a sea that drenched us
all to the skin.—When, by dint of turn∣ing,
we thought to have cleared the pier
head, we were driven to leeward, and
then the boatmen themselves began to
fear that the tide would fail before we
should fetch up our lee-way: the next
trip, however, brought us into smooth wa∣ter,
and we were safely landed on the
quay, about one o'clock in the afternoon.
—“To be sure (cried Tabby, when she
found herself on <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rra firma,</HI>) we must
all have perished, if we had not been
the particular care of Providence.”—“
Yes, (replied my uncle) but I am much
of the honest highlander's mind—af∣ter
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
he had made such a passage as this:
his friend told him he was much in∣debted
to Providence;”—“Certainly,
(said Donald) but, by my saul, mon, I'se
ne'er trouble Providence again, so long
as the brig of Stirling stands.”—
You must know the brig, or bridge of
Stirling, stands above twenty miles up the
river Forth, of which this is the outlet—
I don't find that our 'squire has suffered
in his health from this adventure; but
poor Liddy is in a peaking way—I'm
afraid this unfortunate girl is uneasy in
her mind; and this apprehension distracts
me, for she is really an amiable creature.</P>
<P>We shall set out to-morrow or next day
for Stirling and Glasgow; and we pro∣pose
to penetrate a little way into the
Highlands, before we turn our course to
the southward—In the mean time, com∣mend
me to all our friends round Carfax,
and believe me to be, ever yours,</P>
