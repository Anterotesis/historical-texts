<HEAD TYPE="sub">TOWN AND CANTON OF BERNE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Berne, <DATE>Sept. 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS very much struck, upon my entrance into Berne,
with its singular neatness and beauty. The principal streets
are broad and long, not strait, but gently curved: the
houses are mostly uniform, built of a greyish stone upon ar∣cades.
Through the middle of the streets runs a lively
stream of the clearest water, in a stone channel, while several
fountains are not less ornamental to the place than beneficial
to the inhabitants. The river Aar almost surrounds the
town, winding its course over a rocky bed much below the
level of the streets; and for a considerable way forming by
its steep and craggy banks a kind of natural rampart. The
cathedral, a noble piece of Gothic architecture, stands upon
a platform raised at a great expence above the bed of the
river, and commands a most extensive view. The adjacent
country is richly cultivated, and agreeably diversified with
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
hills, lawns, wood, and water; the river flows rapidly below,
and an abrupt chain of rugged and snow-capt alps bounds
the horizon. Such an assemblage of wild and beautiful objects
would in any place present a most striking prospect; but its
effect becomes greatly heightened when seen from the midst
of a large town.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the native historians, Berne was built by
Berchtold the Fifth, duke of Zaeringen; and was, from its
foundation, an imperial city. Upon the death of Berchtold
in 1218, the emperor Frederic the Second conferred upon
the inhabitants considerable privileges, and compiled also a
code of legislation, which forms the basis of their present
civil laws. The liberty which this city enjoyed, attracted
many inhabitants from the adjacent country, who found a
safe asylum from the oppression of the nobles. Although
Berne from its first foundation was engaged in perpetual
wars with its neighbours, and for some time with the house
of Austria; yet it continued to aggrandise itself by degrees,
and considerably to enlarge its territory. In the year 1353,
Berne acceded to the Helvetic confederacy; and possessed
such great power, even at that early period, as to obtain
the second rank among the Swiss cantons. Since the ac∣quisition
of the Pays de Vaud, the domains of this can∣ton
form nearly the third part of Switzerland, and about
the fourth of the actual population; it contains about
370, 000 souls, exclusive of 11, 000 in the capital. At the
introduction of the reformation in 1528, government ac∣quired
a large increase of revenue by secularizing the eccle∣siastical
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
possessions. At the same period, the whole canton
followed the example of the capital; and the reformed reli∣gion
was permanently established.</P>
<P>THE canton is divided into two great divisions; the Pays
de Vaud, and the German district. The Pays de Vaud having
been conquered from the house of Savoy, and the German
district from the states of the empire; justice is administered,
and the taxes regulated in those two provinces by laws and
customs peculiar to each. Each of these divisions has its
treasurer and chamber of appeal resident in the capital: the
chamber of appeal belonging to the Pays de Vaud, judges in
the last resort; but the inhabitants of the German district
may again appeal from theirs to the Sovereign Council.</P>
<P>AT Berne the society is extremely agreeable, and foreign∣ers
are received with great ease and politeness. The men
do not meet in separate societies; and the women are the
life and ornament of their daily assemblies. These assem∣blies
begin about four or five in the afternoon, and con∣tinue
till about eight, when the parties retire to their re∣spective
houses. Dancing is a very frequent amusement at
Berne. There is a public ball every fortnight; and in
winter scarcely an evening passes without one. These diver∣sions
commence at so early an hour as five in the after∣noon,
on account of a standing order from government,
which prohibits their continuance after eleven. English
country dances are commonly introduced, but the <HI>walse</HI>
(which is a species of allemande) the favourite dance of the
natives, is most common. The parties arrange themselves in
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
distinct couples, and follow each other in a circular direction,
the gentleman turning his partner with great velocity. The
life and spirit of their dances strike a foreigner with astonish∣ment,
and can scarely be conceived by those who have never
seen them. The gaiety of these parties is still more enlivened
during the summer months, when the natives resort to a gar∣den
near the town, and dance under an open pavillion amid
scenes of rural festivity. The foreigner who prefers the con∣stant
intercourse of company to a more tranquil society, will
chuse the residence of Berne rather than that of any other
town in Switzerland.</P>
<P>THERE is but little trade in the capital: some few manu∣factures
indeed (chiefly of linen and silk) have been esta∣blished;
but are carried on by those only, who have no
prospect of being admitted into the Sovereign Council. For,
those families who enjoy any influence in public affairs
would hold themselves degraded, by engaging in any branch
of commerce; and as offices of the state, except bailliages,
are in general not very profitable, nor indeed numerous,
many enter, as their sole resource, into foreign armies. One
general advantage, however, is derived from this anti-com∣mercial
spirit: the members of government not being in∣terested
in laying restrictions on trade, do not, as at Zuric
and Basle, consine the exclusive right of establishing manu∣factures
to the burghers of the capital; but wisely extend
that permission to all their subjects, without distinction of rank
or place. From this circumstance, in conjunction with the
mildness and wisdom of government, arises that comfortable
state, and even wealth, which so peculiarly distinguishes the
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
peasantry in the whole canton of Berne; and to the natural
result of these wise regulations may be reasonably imputed
the attachment to government particularly observable in the
German district. It is worthy of remark, that the peasants,
who have acquired opulence either by manufactures or agri∣culture,
seldom quit their situation; they continue in the
same habits which they contracted in the earlier period of
life, and, however wealthy, never give their daughters in
marriage but to persons of their own description.</P>
<P>THE public buildings are constructed in a noble simpli∣city
of style, and announce the riches and grandeur of the
republic. The arsenal contains arms for sixty thousand
men, and a considerable quantity of cannon, which are cast
in the town. The granary, an excellent institution, similar
to that of Zuric, always contains a large provision of corn,
supplied in consequence of particular treaties by France
and Holland.</P>
<P>THE charitable institutions of Berne are numerous, liberal,
and well directed. The hospitals are in general large, clean,
and airy; and in the alms-house, for the reception of fifty
poor citizens, is a curious establishment similar to one which
I noticed at Basle. Distressed travellers are treated with a
meal and a lodging, if at night, and receive six-pence on
their departure. If sick or wounded, they are maintained
till their recovery is established.</P>
<P>THE house of correction, which, when the benevolent
Mr. Howard visited Berne, was in so deplorable a state, is
now extremely well regulated, and reflects great honour on
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
Mr. Manuel, member of the Great Council, to whose care and
attention this salutary change is chiefly owing. Formerly all
delinquents, without distinction of crime, were confined in
the same place; but they are now separated; and two houses
are established; one called the House of Correction for
greater crimes, and the other the House of Labour for smal∣ler
misdemeanors. The prisoners are also discriminated by
the appellations of <HI>brown</HI> and <HI>blue</HI> from the colour of their
clothes, with which they are supplied gratis during the term
of their confinement. The brown colour is appropriated to
the house of correction, the blue to the house of labour.
The men and women are lodged in separate apartments.
Both are constantly employed, sometimes in cleaning the
streets, and other servile occupations; at other times they are
taught to read and write, and are instructed in various
trades, which may assist them in gaining a maintenance at
the expiration of the time for which they were sentenced to
hard labour. By these means the expence of the establish∣ment
is nearly supported; and an honest livelihood assured
afterwards to those who would otherwise prove useless or
pernicious members of society. There are four tables, at
which the respective seats are a mark of distinction appro∣priated
to good behaviour, and a larger or lesser share of
provision is distributed to each in proportion to their indus∣try.
After having earned their food, the prisoners in the
house of labour receive ten per cent. those in the house of
correction eight per cent. for their extra work.</P>
<P>PUBLIC justice is wisely and impartially administered;
and the torture, which had for some time fallen into disuse,
is now formally abolished by a public act of government.
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
This humane and just act forms a distinguished aera in the
history of Swiss jurisprudence; as the example of so power∣ful
and wise a government cannot fail producing a general
influence; and it is to be hoped, will be the prelude to its
abolition throughout Switzerland. The solemnity used in
passing capital sentence on a criminal, deserves to be men∣tioned
and imitated. The trial being finished, the prisoner
is informed of his condemnation by the <HI>Grand Sautier,</HI> or
lieutenant of the police, and attended by two clergymen,
who prepare him for death. On the day appointed for exe∣cution,
a large scaffolding, covered with a black canopy, is
constructed in the middle of the principal street. The ad∣voyer,
with a sceptre in his hand, is seated on an elevated
kind of throne between two senators, and attended by the
chancellor and the lieutenant of the police, holding an iron
stick, called the <HI>rod of blood,</HI> all habited in their official robes.
The criminal being brought to the foot of the scaffolding
without chains, the chancellor reads aloud the sentence of
condemnation, at the conclusion of which the advoyer bids
the executioner approach, who instantly binds the arms of
the culprit, and leads him to the place of execution.</P>
<P>THE public library is a small but well-chosen collection,
and contains 20,000 volumes, a cabinet of Swiss coins and
medals, and many curious manuscripts: of these, Mr. Sinner,
a man of great erudition, has published a judicious cata∣logue.
He has not only set forth their titles, and ascertained
their age, but has also given a general and succinct account
of their respective subjects; and from many has published
extracts equally curious and interesting. Among these
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
MSS. are some of the thirteenth century, consisting of
several songs and romances of the Troubadours, written in
that and the preceding ages, which merit the attention of
those who are conversant in that species of antient poetry.</P>
<P>LEARNING is neither so universally encouraged, nor so
successfully cultivated here as at Zuric; the academical
studies are almost solely directed to those branches of know∣ledge
more essentially necessary for entering into the church.
The society for the promotion of agriculture, is almost the
only establishment that directly tends to the progress of the
arts and sciences; but meets with no great countenance
from government.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="postscript">
<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P><DATE>October 1786.</DATE></P>
<P>I FEEL a very sensible satisfaction on adding, that this
enlightened government no longer merits the reproach of
not sufficiently encouraging the arts and sciences. It is now
awakened from its former lethargy, and begins to perceive
that it is the interest of every wise government to esteem and
protect the sciences. The magistrates have lately purchased
and appropriated a large mansion for the public library; in∣creased
the collection of books; and procured from England
an extensive apparatus of experimental philosophy.</P>
<P>AMONG other undertakings which meet with their en∣couragement,
a new map of the canton is now preparing
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
under their auspices, by the professor of experimental philo∣sophy,
a great <HI>desideratum</HI> in the geography of Switzerland,
as the alps of the canton are unfaithfully delineated in all the
maps which have fallen under my observation. I am also
happy to add, that the Reverend Mr. Wyttenbach has lately
instituted a literary society for the promotion of physics
and natural history in general, and that of Switzerland in
particular. In January 1788, this society consisted of ten
members resident at Berne, of whom several possess, and
others are forming, collections agreeable to the plan of the
institution. The members have established regular corre∣spondence
in various parts of Europe, and are ready to an∣swer
the inquiries of foreign naturalists, who wish to be in∣formed
concerning any points which relate to the natural
history of this country. An institution founded on such
liberal and extensive principles, and having one object prin∣cipally
in view, cannot fail to render the most essential ser∣vice
to science.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 56.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOVERNMENT OF BERNE.</HEAD>
<P>WERE I to attempt entering into an exact disquisition
concerning the government of Berne; my letter
would not only exceed its proper limits, but would hardly be
contained within the extent of an ordinary pamphlet. I am
persuaded, therefore, you will readily excuse me from putting
your patience to so tedious a trial: but you would probably
think me very inconsistent indeed, if, after having already
descended into less interesting details, I should pass over in
silence a government, the wisdom of whose administration is
so justly admired. Let me endeavour then to sketch the ge∣neral
outlines of this constitution.</P>
<P>THE sovereign power resides in the Great Council of two
hundred; which when complete consists of two hundred and
ninety-nine members, chosen from the citizens; from
whom they are considered as deriving their power, and as
acting by deputation. The authority with which they are
invested, is in some respects the most absolute and uncon∣trouled
of any among the aristocratical states of Switzerland.
The government of Lucerne is called, indeed, the most ari∣stocratical
of all the cantons; and it may be so, perhaps,
with respect to the small number of families to which the
administration of affairs is entrusted: but no war can be de∣clared,
no peace concluded, no alliance made, no taxes im∣posed,
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
without the consent of the burghers in a general
assembly. At Friburgh and Soleure the burghers are likewise
convened upon particular occasions. Whereas the Great
Council of Berne, since 1682, when it was declared the sove∣reign,
is restrained by no constitutional check of this kind;
as a general assembly of the citizens is never convened on
any occasion.</P>
<P>THE executive powers of government are delegated by
this Sovereign Council to the Senate, chosen by themselves
from their own body: the former assembles ordinarily three
times a week, and extraordinarily upon particular occasions;
the Senate every day, Sundays excepted.</P>
<P>THE senate, comprising the two advoyers, or chiefs of
the republic, is composed of twenty-seven members; and
from this select body are drawn the principal magistrates of
the commonwealth. On a vacancy in the Senate, the mode
of election is as follows:—Twenty-six balls, three of which
are golden, are put into a box, and drawn by the several
members: those who draw the three golden balls, nominate
three electors out of their body. In the same manner of
balloting, seven members are chosen from the Great Council,
who also nominate seven electors out of their own body.
These ten electors fix upon a certain number of candidates,
not exceeding ten, nor less than six; and those among these
candidates, who have the fewest votes in the Sovereign
Council, retire till their number is reduced to four: then
four balls, two golden and two silver, are drawn by the
four remaining candidates; the two who draw the former
are put in nomination, and he who has the greatest number
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
of suffrages in the Sovereign Council, is chosen. But in
order to be eligible, the candidate must have been a mem∣ber
of the Great Council ten years, and must be married, or
a widower.</P>
<P>THE Great Council is generally filled up every ten years;
as within that period there is usually a deficiency of eighty
members to complete the whole number of two hundred and
ninety-nine: a new election can only be proposed on a va∣cancy
of eighty; and cannot be deferred when there is a
deficiency of a hundred. The time of election being deter∣mined
by vote, each advoyer nominates two of the new
members; each seizenier, and each member of the senate,
one each: two or three other officers of state enjoy the same
privilege. A few persons also claim, by virtue of their
offices, a right of being elected: and their claim is generally
admitted. These several nominations and pretensions, com∣monly
amount, in the whole, to about fifty of the new
members: the remaining vacancies are supplied by the
suffrages of the senate, and the seizeniers.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Seizeniers</HI> are sixteen members of the Great Council,
drawn yearly from the abbayes or tribes; two from each of
the four great tribes, and one from each of the remaining
eight. The candidates are generally<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I say <HI>generally,</HI> because it is not absolutely fixed that all the seizeniers must have been bailifs: for if it happens, that in one tribe there are two persons, one of whom has been a bailif, and the other is a member of the Great Council; they draw lots for the charge. And should a member of the Great Council be the only one of his tribe, he becomes sei∣zenier of course, provided he is eligible. In order to be seizenier, the candidate must be married, or a widower, and have neither his father or brother in the senate.</NOTE> taken from those who
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
have exercised the office of bailifs; and are elected by lot.
Every year during three days at Easter, all other employ∣ments
in the state are suspended, except those of the banne∣rets
and the seizeniers, who, during this suspension, are in∣vested
with a power similar to that of the Roman censors.
In case of mal-administration, they may remove any mem∣ber
from the Great Council, or from the Senate: but it is a
power which they never exercise; and should they think
proper to exert it, the sentence must be confirmed by
that council.</P>
<P>THE principal magistrates are, two advoyers, the two
treasurers, and the four bannerets: they are each of them
chosen by a majority of voices in the Sovereign Council, and
are yearly confirmed in their respective offices. The ad∣voyers
hold their post for life; the treasurers, six years; and
the bannerets, four. At Easter the advoyer in office delivers
up his authority, in full council, to his colleague. The <HI>reign∣ing</HI>
advoyer sits on an elevated feat, under a canopy, and the
seal of the republic lies upon the table before him. He never
delivers his opinion except it is demanded; he enjoys no
vote unless the numbers are equal; and in that case, he has
the casting voice. The advoyer out of office, is the first se∣nator
in rank, and president of the secret council.</P>
<P>THE two treasurers, one for the German district, and the
other for the Pays de Vaud, form, in conjunction with the
four bannerets, an oeconomical chamber, or council of
finances: this council examines and passes the accounts of
the bailifs, and receives the revenues of all those who are
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
accountable to government. The four bannerets, toge∣ther
with the advoyer out of office, the senior treasurer,
and two members of the Senate, compose a committee or
secret council; in which all state affairs, that require se∣crecy,
are discussed.</P>
<P>I HAVE only described these eight magistracies, as being
the chief offices of the state, and exercised by members of
the Senate. But although the general form of this consti∣tution
is entirely aristocratical; and the Senate possesses a
very considerable influence; yet it does not enjoy that almost
exclusive authority, which is observable in many aristocra∣tical
governments. For, by several wise and well-observed
regulations, the Sovereign Council, although it delegates the
most important concerns of government to the Senate, yet
assembles, at stated times, and superintends the administra∣tion
of public affairs.</P>
<P>IT may also be remarked, that although the antient houses
retain very considerable influence, and are more readily en∣trusted
with the administration of affairs; yet that the prin∣cipal
charges of government are not exclusively confined to
them: many new families being always admitted into the
Sovereign Council on every election. It must nevertheless
be acknowledged, that, as the citizens are continually dimi∣nishing,
and their vacancies are never supplied; it would
well become so wise a government to receive occasionally
new families into the burghership, in order to prevent the
ill effects arising from the partial and narrow spirit of too con∣sined
an oligarchy. Government is administered through∣out
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
its several departments with great precision, and
every ordinance is executed with as much dispatch as in
a monarchical state. The administration of affairs is car∣ried
on with great wisdom and moderation, and the rulers
are particularly cautious not to encroach upon the privi∣leges
of the subject.</P>
<P>THE canton of Berne is divided into a certain number of
districts, called bailliages; over which, bailifs are chosen
from the Sovereign Council: and, these posts being the most
profitable in the disposal of government, are the great objects
of general pursuit. Formerly the bailifs, taken indifferently
from the Senate or Great Council, were nominated by the
bannerets; but as this method rendered the members entirely
dependent upon those who had the chief credit and influence
in the commonwealth; the mode of election was altered in
1712, and they are now chosen by lot. No competitor, how∣ever,
can be received as a candidate, in opposition to a more
antient member of the Great Council: for instance, he who
was admitted in 1766, cannot stand against one who was
chosen in 1756. None but married men or widowers are
capable of being elected into this office; nor can any person
occupy more than once the principal bailliages: those of a
less profitable kind may be possessed three times.</P>
<P>THE several bailifs are representatives of the sovereign
power in their respective districts. They enforce the edicts
of government, collect the public revenues, act as justices of
the peace, and are judges in civil and criminal causes, except
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
where there is any local<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lord of the estate of Diesbach enjoys, within his own lands, the same powers, in criminal affairs, as are possessed by the bailifs in their respective districts.</NOTE> jurisdiction. In civil causes, be∣yond
a certain value, an appeal lies to the courts of Berne:
in criminal affairs, the process is made out in the bailif's
court, undergoes a revision in the Senate, and is referred to
the criminal chamber, which inflicts punishment for small
misdemeanors. In capital cases, the sentence must be con∣firmed
by the Senate, and by the Sovereign Council, if the
delinquent is a citizen of Berne. The bailif delivers his ac∣counts
to the oeconomical chamber, to which court an appeal
lies, in case of exaction, either on the part of the bailif, or of
his officers: and with respect to those misdemeanors that are
punishable by fine, and of which the bailif is entitled to a
share; the proportion of the respective penalties is settled by
the legislature with the most scrupulous exactness, and not
left to the arbitrary decision of an interested judge.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH from all these considerations it should seem,
that every possible precaution has been taken by govern∣ment
to prevent the extortions of the bailifs; yet instances
have not been wanting to prove, that these wise and strict
regulations may be eluded: but it is no less certain, that
where bailifs have been guilty of oppressions, frequent ex∣amples
occur of their being impartially and severely punish∣ed.
The profits of this office arise from the produce of the
demesnes, of the tythes, and certain duties paid to govern∣ment
in the respective bailliages. In some parts of the Ger∣man
division, the bailif is entitled, upon the death of every
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
peasant, to a determinate part of the inheritance: although
his share is very inconsiderable, yet in some situations it may
prove an oppressive tax upon the family. This tax is the
only instance that has fallen under my knowledge, where
the peasants of this canton are liable to any imposition,
which can justly be deemed grievous.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH there are no standing armies in Switzerland;
yet in many of the cantons, and particularly in Berne, the
militia is so well regulated, that government could assemble
a very considerable body of men at a moment's warning.
To this end, every male at the age of sixteen is enrolled in
the militia; and about a third of the whole number are
formed into particular regiments, composed of fusileers and
electionaries; the former consisting of batchelors, and the
latter of married men. Every person thus enrolled, is
obliged to provide himself, at his own expence, with an uni∣form,
a musket, and a certain quantity of powder and ball:
and no peasant is allowed to marry, unless he produces his
uniform and arms. Every year a certain number of officers,
who are called Land Majors, are deputed by the council of
war, throughout the canton, to inspect the arms of the sol∣diers;
to complete the regiments, and exercise the militia:
upon their return they make their report to that council.
Beside this annual review, the regiments are occasionally ex∣ercised
by veteran soldiers, appointed for that purpose.</P>
<P>BESIDE the arms in the arsenal of Berne, a certain quan∣tity
is also provided, in the arsenal of each bailliage, suffi∣cient
for the militia of that district; and likewise a sum of
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
money amounting to three months pay, which is appro∣priated
to the electionaries in case of actual service. The
dragoons are chosen from the substantial farmers; as each
person is obliged to provide his horse and accoutrements.
In time of peace, the advoyer out of office, is president of the
council of war, and a member of that council is commander
of the militia in the Pays de Vaud; but during war a general
in chief is nominated, who commands the forces of the re∣public.
A certain number of regiments being thus always in
readiness, signals are fixed on the highest part of each bail∣liage,
for assembling the militia at a particular place in each
district; where they receive orders for marching.</P>
<P>BEFORE I close this letter, I shall just mention an institu∣tion,
called the <HI>Exterior State,</HI> as remarkable for its singula∣rity
as its utility. It is a model of the Sovereign Council,
and is composed of those burghers, who have not attained the
age requisite for entering into that Council. It has a Great
Council, a Senate, two advoyers, treasurers, bannerets, and
seizeniers; all of whom are chosen in the usual manner, and
with the accustomed ceremonies. The post of advoyer in
this mimic community is solicited with great assiduity, and
sometimes obtained at a considerable expence; as the suc∣cessful
candidate is always admitted into the Great Council,
without any farther recommendation. This body possesses
a certain number of bailliages, which consist of several
ruined castles dispersed over the canton: it has also its com∣mon
treasure, and its debts. In this article, however, it by
no means resembles the actual government of Berne, which
is not only free from debts, but possessed of a very consider∣able
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
fund in reserve. This remarkable institution, may be
considered as a political seminary for the youth of Berne.
It renders them acquainted with the forms of the constitu∣tion;
and, as the members debate upon all kinds of political
subjects, affords them an opportunity of exercising and im∣proving
their talents, and by that means of becoming more
capable of serving the public, whenever they may be ad∣mitted
to a share in the administration of government.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">BIOGRAPHICAL AND LITERARY ANECDOTES
OF HALLER.</HEAD>
<P>BERNE has produced few men highly eminent in li∣terature;
but has established her glory in being the
birth-place of the celebrated Haller.</P>
<P>ALBERT HALLER<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The materials for this biographical sketch, are chiefly collected from the fol∣lowing lives of this great man, which, as I was informed, by his eldest son, since deceased, are those to which most credit may be given. 1. <HI>Leben des Herrn von Haller,</HI> by George Zimmerman. Zuric, 1755. The author was the disciple and friend of Haller. 2. <HI>Lobrede auf Herrn Albrecht von Haller, von Herrn von Bal∣thasar.</HI> Basel, 1778. The author was Haller's intimate friend, and was well ac∣quainted with the principal events of his life. He is the same gentleman whom I have mentioned in vol. i. Letter 23. 3. <HI>Lo∣brede auf Herrn Albert Haller.</HI> Durch, V. B. <HI>Tscharner des Grossen Raths, &amp;c.</HI> Berne, 1778. Mr. Tscharner, being a native of Berne, and an intimate acquaint∣ance of Haller, his account deserves implicit credit. He was author of several esteemed works on the topography and history of Switzerland. He died in 1778, a short time after he had pronounced this panegyric on his deceased friend. 4. <HI>Eloge Historique d'Albert de Haller, avec un Catalogue de ses Oeuvres.</HI> Geneve, 1778. Sennebier, the writer of this eulogium, is well known as the learned author of <HI>Bibliotheque de Geneve,</HI> and of <HI>Histoire Literaire de Geneve.</HI> He informs us, that he received several anec∣dotes from the family of Haller.
Many other panegyrics and lives of Haller have been published in various parts of Europe; but as they were mostly written by those who were not personally acquainted with him, I have not cited them as autho∣rities. His son mentions nineteen lives and panegyrics of his father, that had fallen under his notice in 1784. See Bibl. Schweit. Geshic. vol. ii. N° 882—906. I have been enabled to add several anecdotes which I procured at Berne, and from his eldest son the late bailif of Nyon.
The completest list of Haller's works is to be found in the 6th volume of “<HI>Epistolae ad Hallerum scriptae.</HI>” Berne, 1775. His subsequent publications may be supplied from Sennebier's catalogue.</NOTE>, the youngest of five brothers, was
born on the 16th of October 1708. His father, Emanuel
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
Haller, a citizen of Berne, practised the law as an advocate
with great success; and in 1713, removed from the capital
to Baden, where he was appointed secretary of that
bailliage.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH many accounts are usually related concern∣ing
the early genius of distinguished persons, which do not
always deserve implicit credit; yet the premature abilities
and application of Haller are incontestably proved. When
he had scarcely attained his fifth year he was accustomed to
write the new words, which he recollected to have heard in
the course of the day. His progress in the languages was so
rapid, that in his tenth year he could translate from the
Greek, and composed for his own private use a Chaldaic
grammar, a Greek and Hebrew lexicon. His passion for
letters was also so general and ardent, that, about the same
period, he abridged from Bayle and Moreri an historical
dictionary, comprising above two thousand lives, and dis∣tinguished
himself by a satire in Latin verse against his
preceptor Abraham Baillodz, a person of considerable learn∣ing,
but of a capricious and morose disposition.</P>
<P>SUCH unwearied application, and astonishing progress,
in a youth of his years, ought to have ensured the ap∣probation
and encouragement of his family. On the
contrary, his father, who had destined him to the law, re∣proved
his growing taste for polite literature, was particularly
offended at his inclination for poetry, as likely to draw him
from the severer occupations, and objected to the variety of
his pursuits as too desultory and superficial. He did not
consider, that, during childhood, the principal requisite of
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
education is to infuse a taste for application in general; and,
that when the base of education is rendered as broad as pos∣sible,
like a pyramid, it may always be reduced to a point.
But neither his father's repeated exhortations, nor his pre∣ceptor's
severe admonitions, could oblige the youth to confine
his studies to one object, or check his insatiable thirst for
general information. In this manner he was educated until
1721, when, on his father's death, he was removed to the
public school at Berne. He was placed in a class far above
his age; and usually wrote in Greek the exercise, which he
was expected to compose in the Latin tongue. In 1723, he
obtained permission to accompany a young friend to Bienne,
in order to be instructed in philosophy by the father of his
companion, who was a celebrated physician. But his new
preceptor being a bigot to the Cartesian school, Haller soon
rejected with disdain that logic and philosophy, which tended
to cramp his genius rather than extend his knowledge; and
continued to cultivate history, poetry, and polite literature,
but with as little order and method as might be expected
from his years.</P>
<P>HALLER, during his residence at Bienne, began a custom,
which he afterwards followed through life, that of writing
his opinion of the books which he perused, and making
large extracts from them. His genius being also awakened
by the romantic scenery of the country to poetical en∣thusiasm,
he composed various pieces in the epic, dramatic,
and lyric styles. He was at this time so entirely absorbed in
this favourite study, that, on a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire breaking out in the
house in which he resided, he rushed into his apartment,
and rescued his poetry from the flames, leaving his other
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
papers, with little regret, to destruction. Afterwards, when
a more mature age had ripened his judgment, he was fre∣quently
heard to say, that he had preserved from the flames
those compositions which he then thought the finest pro∣ductions
of human genius, in order at a future period to con∣sign
them to destruction as unworthy of his pen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many of his biographers have con∣founded these two facts; and, from a na∣tural proneness to exaggeration, have asserted, that at Bienne, Haller, with a greatness of mind above his years, burned his poetical compositions, from a strong conviction, that poetry tended to alienate his mind from the severer studies: whereas, the very contrary happened. He saved his poetical pieces in preference to his other papers, and burned them afterwards, because they would have disgraced his re∣putation: although, as juvenile productions, they were not wholly without merit. I have in this instance preferred the authority of his particular friends, Balthasar and Tscharner, to his other biographers, who had not such opportunities of obtaining the truth. Besides, as a confirmation of their evidence, Haller did not intermit his poetical studies; and wrote at Tubingen his <HI>Morgen-gedanken</HI> and <HI>Sehn-Sucht,</HI> which are the earliest specimens he ever gave to the public.</NOTE>. In this
period of life, Haller compares himself to a wild plant, which
is left to grow without pruning; and this very circumstance
was probably the principal cause of his future proficiency,
and the foundation of that universal knowledge, to which
he afterwards attained.</P>
<P>HE had been originally intended for the law: but his
active mind could not submit to follow a profession which
would limit his inquiries; which entirely depended on pre∣cedent
and authority; and which, to use his own quotation
from Horace, in a letter to his friend Bonnet, obliged him,
<Q>Jurare in verba magistri.</Q>
And although he could not submit to the shackles of that
narrow philosophy, so strongly recommended and enforced
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
by his new preceptor, yet he appears to have been prin∣cipally
determined by his advice to dedicate himself to
physic; the study of which comprehends such a variety of
literary pursuits, as seemed congenial to the zeal and activity
of his capacious mind. He had no sooner formed this re∣solution,
than he adopted a more regular and uniform plan,
than he had hitherto been able to pursue. For this purpose
he removed, towards the end of 1723, to the university of
Tubingen, where, under the professors Elias Camerarius and
Du Vernoy, he prosecuted his studies with that unwearied
application, which never forsook him. From Camerarius he
learned those sound principles of rational philosophy, which
teach us first to doubt, and afterwards to believe; and which
are as far removed from credulity on one hand, as from scep∣ticism
on the other. From the lectures of Du Vernoy he
imbibed his first taste for botany, and made so rapid a pro∣gress
in the study of anatomy, that his master predicted,
from several dissertations, his future proficiency in that
science. Notwithstanding his strong and invariable at∣tachment
to these two branches of natural history, he repre∣sents
himself as studying, <HI>invitâ minervâ,</HI> against nature;
anatomy though he could not support bad smells, and botany
though he was extremely short-sighted. At Tubingen he
also distinguished his knowledge in mineralogy by refuting
the error of Tournefort, in ascribing to fossils a vegetating
power.</P>
<P>DURING his continuance in that university, he gave an
instance of his early controul over his passions; a difficult
conquest for a young man of strong feelings and lively ima∣gination.
A single deviation into excess, into which he had
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
been hurried by the example of some of his fellow-pupils,
so greatly affected a person like him, no less enamoured of
virtue, than susceptible of ingenuous shame, that he instantly
formed a resolution to abstain from wine; and adopted a
strictness of morals, which renders highly probable the
assertion of his French encomiast, the Marquis de Condorcet,
that he was descended from a family, in which piety might
be said to be hereditary.</P>
<P>IN 1725, Haller repaired to Leyden, to which place he
was drawn by the great reputation of Boerhaave. Here he
sound a more ample field for the improvement of his mind,
and the display of his abilities. He became the favourite
scholar of Boerhaave, by whose example and encouragement
he strengthened his growing inclination for botany. He
noted down his master's lectures on the <HI>Institutes of Medicine</HI>
with such precision, as afterwards gave birth to one of his
most useful publications. He continued his anatomical
studies under Albinus, just then rising into same, and the
venerable Ruysch, who so highly improved the art of in∣jecting
anatomical preparations. The precarious state of
his health, probably occasioned, or at least increased, by his
intense application, induced him to accompany two of his
countrymen through part of Germany. On his return, in
1726, he received his doctor's degree, though only in the
nineteenth year of his age; and published on that occasion
his inaugural dissertation <HI>de Ductu salivali Coschwiziano.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1727 he visited England, was favourably received by
Cheselden, Douglas, and Sir Hans Sloane; and improved
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
his knowledge of medicine and surgery under the auspices
of those celebrated men, and by diligently attending the
hospitals. At Paris, whither he next directed his course,
he studied botany under Geoffroy and Jussieu; anatomy
under Le Dran and Winslow, a celebrated surgeon. Winslow
was indeed his favourite master, to whom he particularly
attached himself; whom he proposed to his disciples as the
best model for their imitation, as an anatomist, who, shackled
by no system, described simply and faithfully what he him∣self
observed in his dissections.</P>
<P>HALLER had proposed to continue his travels to Italy, that
country where medicinal knowledge first revived in the
darker ages, and where,
<Q>“Smit with the love of sacred song,”</Q>
he might indulge his enthusiasm and improve his taste in
classical literature. The uncertain state of his health, the
<HI>maladie du pays</HI> which so remarkably affects the Swiss in
foreign parts, and on which he has composed a poem,
together with the advice of his friends, prevailed over his
inclination, and induced him to return to his native city.</P>
<P>IN his way to Berne he stopped at Basle, in order to study
mathematics and algebra under the celebrated John Ber∣noulli;
and in this, as well as every other instance of his
life, applied with such indefatigable perseverance, as if those
sciences were to form the sole object of his future researches.
His proficiency in these studies is sufficiently proved by
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
several treatises still extant in manuscript, which he com∣posed
on arithmetic and geometry, and particularly by his
remarks on the Marquis de l'Hospital's Analysis of Infinite∣simals;
and his attachment to them by his being deeply
employed in a profound calculation on the day of his mar∣riage.
But though he made such a progress as astonished
Bernoulli himself, he continued his other pursuits, being
appointed to read lectures on anatomy during the sickness
of the professor: while he fulfilled the duties of that office,
he also attended the lectures of Tzinger on the practical parts
of medicine; thus at the same time displaying, with equal
propriety, the dignity of a professor, and the humility of
a pupil. During the summer of 1729, he, in company with
his friend John Gesner, made an excursion into the moun∣tains
of Switzerland; an excursion rendered memorable by
its suggesting to him the plan of a <HI>Flora Helvetica,</HI> and by
inspiring his poem on the Alps, which he composed in the
21st year of his age; a poem as sublime and immortal as the
mountains which are the subject of his song.</P>
<P>NOT to interrupt these biographical anecdotes with a
chronological detail of his poetical productions, I shall just
mention, that, not long after his poem on the Alps, he wrote
his ethic epistles, on the Imperfection of Human Virtue,
on Superstition and In<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idelity, on the Origin of Evil, on the
Vanity of Honour, Various Satires, Doris, a Pastoral on his
first wife, and his much admired Elegy on her death. It is
a convincing proof of Haller's versatile genius and extraor∣dinary
mental powers, that he should have so eminently
excelled in poetry, which, except in his early youth, he
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
never considered otherwise than as an amusement, either to
sooth him under afflictions, and in the bed of sickness, or
to console him for the envy and neglect of his contem∣poraries.</P>
<P>THE <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oundest German critics place Haller among the most
eminent of their poets; and consider sublimity as the grand
characteristic of his writings. They acknowledge, that he
improved the harmony and richness of his native tongue;
that he possessed the highest powers of invention and fancy;
great originality both in his ideas and language; that he is
the true colourist of nature; that he sounded the depths of
metaphysical and moral science; that he equally excels in
picturesque descriptions, in soft and delightful imagery, in
elevated sentiments, and philosophical precision. A few
supercilious critics have reproached his poetry with occa∣sional
obscurities; and accuse him of having introduced a
new language affectedly averse to the common modes of
diction. Cold criticism may censure; but twenty-two suc∣cessive
editions of his German poems, and the translation of
them into the principal languages of Europe, prove, that
they possess the great aim of poetry, that of pleasing and
interesting the reader. And it may be remarked with truth,
that although Haller's stupendous labours in erudition and
science render his poetical talents of inferior account; yet
that if he had confined himself to poetry, that alone would
have immortalized his name.</P>
<P>BUT it is time to accompany Haller to his native city,
where he returned, in 1729, expecting from his countrymen
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
that respect and patronage, he had so liberally received
abroad. But he had the mortification to experience that
neglect, and even envy, to which every man of genius is ex∣posed
in his own country, and which he seems to have aug∣mented
by his satirical compositions. He continued three
years without having the interest to procure any public em∣ployment;
and, though he prevailed on Government to esta∣blish
an anatomical theatre, and gave lectures gratis; he did
not succeed in obtaining the place of physician to the hospi∣tal,
which he much desired. He also solicited a professorship,
and was again repulsed. He seems to have sensibly felt these
disappointments, and expressed his impatience and indigna∣tion
in his satirical poems. Instead, however, of damping
his activity or abating the ardour of his genius, he redou∣bled
his application and services in order to force himself
into public notice.</P>
<P>THE first distinguishing tribute to his literary talents was
paid by the Royal Society of Upsala, which, in 1735, chose
him a member. This election was the prelude to more ho∣nourable
and beneficial employments. In the same year his
countrymen acknowledged his merit, by appointing him
director of the hospital, and public librarian. As director of
the hospital, he distinguished himself by his zeal and huma∣nity.
As librarian, he bestowed great pains in arranging the
books, and in forming the first catalogue. Scarcely any
branch of literature, however remote from his usual occupa∣tions,
was omitted by Haller, whenever an opportunity pre∣sented
itself, either of improving his general knowledge,
or of being useful to science. Finding in the public library
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
a collection of antient medals, which had been hitherto
neglected; he took considerable pleasure in classing them.
His love of history led him to pay great attention to the study
of medals, which he justly considered as the most authentic
documents of historical truth, and the most certain monu∣ments
to ascertain the ever-fluctuating state of language.</P>
<P>HIS literary reputation began now to spread itself by va∣rious
botanical, anatomical, and medical publications, and by
a collection of poems<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Versuch Schweitzerischer Gedichte.</HI> The best edition is printed at Berne, 1775.</NOTE>, which first made its appearance in
1732. At length, in 1736, he received, unsolicited on his part,
the offer of the professorship of physic, botany, and surgery,
in the university of Gottingen, newly established by George
the Second. Notwithstanding all the advantages and honours
which accompanied this offer, he, for some time, hesitated
whether he should accept it. He had, in 1731, espoused a
young lady of good family, whose great beauty and accom∣plishments
were rendered still more endearing by her
affectionate subserviency to his manner of life. She had
brought him three children; and these ties attached him
more strongly to his native place, where his merits had pro∣cured
him many sincere friends; and the air of which he
considered as in some respect necessary for the continuance
of his health. On the other hand, the honour of being in∣vited
by so great a monarch, the dignity of the establishment
to which he was called, and the consideration of having a
more ample theatre for the improvement of his knowledge,
induced him to remove to Gottingen.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="37"/>
HE quitted Berne with much regret; presaging, as it
were, the heavy stroke which overtook him soon after his
arrival in that university. He lost his wife. The death of
his beloved Marianne, whose memory he has celebrated in a
pathetic elegy, afflicted him so deeply, that it almost brought
him to the grave. In this crisis of despondency he redoubled
his application, as the most probable means of subduing his
sorrow; and the duties of his station forced him from the
contemplation of his own grief into public life. During
seventeen years, in which he resided at Gottingen, his abili∣ties
expanded in proportion as his opportunities of acquiring
knowledge increased; he obtained from government the
establishment of a botanical garden, which he superintended,
of an anatomical theatre, a school for midwifery, and a col∣lege
for the improvement of surgery. He formed the plan
for a Royal Society of Sciences, of which he was appointed
perpetual president.</P>
<P>THE comprehensive mind and versatile genius of Haller,
united with unremitting diligence and ardour in all his pur∣suits,
enabled him to cultivate with uncommon success, a
variety of knowledge. Had not the great Swede pre-occupied
the field, Haller would have stood the first among his con∣temporaries
as an improver of botanical knowledge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I should not have presumed to have given any detailed account of Haller's botanical, medical, or anatomical works, if I had not received assistance on these subjects from my very judicious friend Dr. Pulteney.</NOTE>. Yet
botany was not among his earliest pursuits, for he informs
us, that he had made no advances in it until his return from
his travels: during his residence at Basle, in the year 1728,
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
as if inspired, he says, by the genius of that place, which
had nurtured the Bauhins, and where at that period botany
was successfully cultivated by Staehlin, he laid the design of
his future Flora. From this time he made annual journies
into various parts of Switzerland, and principally among the
Alps. He cultivated the correspondence of the most eminent
botanists; particularly with Scheutzer, Ludwig, Linnaeus,
Van Royen, and Dr. John Gesner of Zuric, who had also
meditated a design to publish a Swiss Flora, and freely com∣municated
his materials to Haller.</P>
<P>HIS establishment at Gottingen afterwards enlarged his
views and opportunities; and at length, in 1742, his great
botanical work on the plants of Switzerland, the result of
fourteen years study, made its appearance. It was entitled,
<HI>Enumeratio Methodica Stirpium Helvetiae,</HI> in 2 vols. folio. It
was the most copious Flora the world had ever seen, com∣prising
1,840 species, and was enriched with several advan∣tages,
that rendered it singularly acceptable. The preface
contains a compendious geographical description of Swit∣zerland,
and of the Alps particularly; an account of all the
authors who had written on the plants of that country; the re∣cital
of his own journies; acknowledgments to those who had
assisted him; concluding with the order and method he means
to pursue in this work. After the preface follows a chro∣nological
account of 268 volumes, which he cites in the
work, each accompanied by a general character; in which,
with great candour and impartiality, he points out the merit or
demerit of the author, in the manner which he afterwards
pursued in the <HI>Methodus Studii Medici,</HI> and in the <HI>Bibliotheca
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
Medicinae.</HI> This is in reality a very useful and entertaining
part of his work, inasmuch as it forms almost a history of
the progress of the science, from the time of Brunfelsius to
his own.</P>
<P>HE next delineates his own system of botany, according
to which the plants are disposed. Throughout this great
work, Haller is entirely an original: not satisfying himself
with giving the descriptions of former writers, he appears
every where to have described the plant himself, and to have
formed new genera, and commonly new specifical characters
for the whole, accommodated to his own system. He in∣forms
us, that it was his custom to write down the natural
characters of each plant on the day he found it. In treating
on each species, he has not only added a most copious num∣ber
of synonymes, but, unsatisfied with Bauhin's Pinax, he
appears to have consulted all the old authors, extricated their
synonymes, with uncommon diligence and singular discrimi∣nation,
and arranged them, as much as possible, in chrono∣logical
order; a method highly worthy of imitation, as it
exhibits at one view, a brief history of the plant, by point∣ing
out the first discoverer, and the regions of its growth.
This to the curious botanist, is a very meritorious part of
Haller's labour. To each is subjoined a summary account,
from the best writers, of the qualities and uses, both oeconomi∣cal
and medical. The work is embellished with plates of some
rare species, remarkable for their exactness and delicacy.</P>
<P>HAVING, in 1741, obtained from the king of Great Bri∣tain
the establishment of the physic garden at Gottingen,
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
Haller published the following year a catalogue of its plants.
This was but a small volume, but the list served to shew the
diligence with which he had fulfilled the intention of the
royal founder. In 1753 he much enlarged it, and compre∣hended
the plants spontaneously growing in the environs,
especially those of the Black Forest. He informs us, that
this volume was the production of a three months vacation,
and laments, that the importance of his other employments
prevented him from fulfilling his intention of describing
the plants of Germany at large. This little work is curious,
since it exemplifies his system as extended to exotics, of
which the new and rare kinds are herein described. But the
small size of the volume precluded the introduction of the
generical characters.</P>
<P>IN 1745, he gratified the botanists by a new edition of the
<HI>Flora Jenensis</HI> of Ruppius; and, that he might do justice to
his author, he took a journey to Jena, where he gained access
to the papers and <HI>hortus siccus</HI> of the author. He prefixed
to this book anecdotes of this extraordinary man; and, by
reforming the whole, and augmenting it with many plants,
discovered by himself, he in some measure made it a <HI>Flora
Germanica.</HI> These performances were by no means the
termination of his botanical labours. On his return to Swit∣zerland
he continued his discoveries in this branch of na∣tural
history; he also sent, at his own expence, persons pro∣perly
qualified into the less frequented parts of Switzerland.
The result appeared in a new edition of the <HI>Enumeratio,</HI>
which was so much improved and altered, that he considers
it as a new work. It was published in three vol. fol. in 1768,
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
under the title of <HI>Historia Stirpium indigenarum Helvetiae,
inchoata.</HI> The subject is arranged in his own method, with
the alteration of inverting the order of the classes, beginning
with the <HI>Compositae,</HI> or the <HI>Syngenesia</HI> class of Linnaeus, and
ending with the <HI>Cryptogamia,</HI> which stood first in the <HI>Enu∣meratio;</HI>
both of which are objectionable, as subjecting the
student to the most difficult parts of the system at his en∣trance
on the study. Several interesting particulars of the
former publication are also omitted in these volumes, of
which curious botanists will much regret the loss: for
though he has inserted, with enlargement, the physical geo∣graphy
of Switzerland, together with the account of those
authors who had previously investigated the plants of the
country, and has recited his own excursions for that pur∣pose;
yet he has not introduced the critical catalogue of the
authors, satisfying himself with giving a bare list of all the
botanical writings, from the time of Theophrastus to the
year 1768. It is still more to be regretted, that Haller has
suppressed, in this edition, a great number of synonymes
under each plant; inserting only a few of those of later date.
It may further be remarked, that although in all possible in∣stances
he has introduced the synonymes of Linnaeus, yet he
has, unfortunately for such as use the works of both, omit∣ted
the trivial names; a circumstance which renders his
book much less useful to those who are conversant in the sex∣ual
system. Yet, if these are defects, they are doubtless
more than compensated, by the innumerable improvements
made in the descriptions, both of the genera and species, by
the great addition to the number of plants, which are ex∣tended
from 1840 to 2486, of which more than 800 are of the
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
Cryptogamia class; Haller having, after Micheli, beyond any
of his contemporaries, enlarged the order of Fungi, of which
he tells us, he had the paintings of more than 400 species
drawn under his own inspection. It is not, however, sur∣prising,
that Switzerland should produce a greater variety of
vegetables than the middle parts of Europe; when we reflect
that the alpine situations afford growth to the plants of the
arctic regions, and the warm vallies of the same country, to
many of those common to southern. The value of this
edition is much enhanced by enlarging the observations on
the uses of plants; and by referring to his authorities for
what is not his own, with his accustomed accuracy. As an
accession to this work, it may be added, that the author has,
in the notes, under each genus, introduced the plants of
Theophrastus and Dioscorides, in as many instances as they
admit of being ascertained.</P>
<P>FEW botanists have laboured more than Haller; and yet
his discoveries in botany occupied only a comparatively small
portion of his time. To such as feel not, in the fullest ex∣tent,
that enthusiasm which the love of science creates, it
may appear a paradox to assert, that the dissection of human
bodies could be a pleasurable employment; yet Haller, in
1742, pronounced an elegant and spirited eulogium, in the
university of Gottingen, to prove it; and his zeal in the pur∣suit
of anatomical discoveries was attended with uncommon
success. He seems early to have apprehended, that the
knowledge of the distribution of the arterial system, had not
kept pace with that of the bones, muscles, nerves, and vis∣cera,
which had been separately and ably treated by men of
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
eminence. Haller, therefore, wished to illustrate more per∣fectly
this part of the human body; and he gave to the world
a more complete system on the subject than had yet appear∣ed.
He published the first part of this great work in 1743,
and the last in 1756. His tracts on other parts of anatomy,
when collected in 1768, form three vols. in 4to. The cu∣rious
reader may see an enumeration of his many discoveries
in anatomy and physiology, at the head of the sixth volume
of his Physiology: and although some of these discoveries
may have been contested by his contemporaries; yet his
unalienable right to most of them, and the light particularly
which he threw upon incubation, ossification, irritability,
and several other parts of the animal oeconomy, will un∣questionably
secure to him a large and honourable share of
fame with posterity.</P>
<P>HALLER'S emoluments augmented as his merits were dis∣played;
and honours flowed upon him from all quarters. He
was elected, in 1748, into the Royal Society of Stockholm, into
that of London in 1749, and in 1754 chosen one of the eight
foreign members in the Academy of Sciences at Paris. In
1739 he was appointed physician to George the Second, and
king's counsellor in 1740. In 1749 the emperor Francis con∣ferred
on him letters of nobility at the request of George the
Second; and about the same time the king, in a visit which
he had paid to the university, distinguished Haller with par∣ticular
marks of approbation; an honour which the author
gratefully acknowledges, in an English publication, intitled,
“A short Narrative of the King's Journey to Gottingen,”
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
and in the dedication to George the Second, prefixed to his
edition of Boerhaave's <HI>Methodus Studii Medici.</HI></P>
<P>HE declined, in 1745, an invitation to Oxford, which
would probably have terminated in his nomination to the
professorship of botany, vacant by the death of the celebrated
Dillenius; a second from the university of Utrecht; and, in
1750, a third from the king of Prussia, with the offer of a
very considerable pension. But of all his promotions, none
gave him more real satisfaction, than his election into the
Great Council of Berne, as it ensured to him a retreat ac∣companied
with dignity, and probably with emolument, in
his native city, to which he looked forward with affection
and attachment.</P>
<P>AT length, in 1753, induced by the precarious state of his
health, by the desire of removing from Gottingen, which he
called the <HI>grave</HI> of his wives, and by his earnest anxiety to
dedicate the remainder of his days to the service of his coun∣try,
he took a journey to Berne, in order to procure an esta∣blishment,
which, though not adequate to his present ap∣pointments,
might place him in the bosom of his beloved
Switzerland. Soon after his arrival, he fortunately obtained
by lot the office of Amman: although this office was of small
emolument, yet, as it might be considered a prelude to future
appointments, and as it gave him an immediate opportunity
of serving his children, he resigned his professorship at Got∣tingen,
and settled at Berne. Such was the general joy of
his countrymen on this event, that Morikosof struck a medal
to commemorate his return.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="45"/>
HAVING formed this resolution, he could not be shaken
by the most splendid offers. He declined, in 1755, the pres∣sing
invitation of Frederic the Second, to superintend the
academies of Prussia, and to accept the chancellorship of the
university of Hall, vacant by the death of Wolfe. In 1767,
he rejected the offer of a very advantageous and honourable
settlement at St. Petersburgh, made by Catherine the Se∣cond;
and, in 1770, the still more dignified promotion to the
chancellorship of the university of Gottingen, with a very
considerable appointment; although George the Third
wrote not only to Haller, but to the Senate of Berne, request∣ing
their influence to persuade his acceptance of it. His
grateful country rewarded this disinterested attachment with
the most liberal and unbounded confidence, and employed
his talents in the public service. In 1757, he was sent to re∣form
the academy of Lausanne; and, in the following year,
was deputed by the Senate to examine some curious remains
of antiquity lately discovered at Culm. About the same
time he was appointed director of the salt-works at Bex and
Aigle, with an annual salary of £. 500. During the term of
this appointment, which continued six years, he resided at
La Roche. In this retirement, he employed himself in su∣perintending
and improving the salt-works, of which he has
given a short account; in making occasional excursions into
the neighbouring country, which he has likewise described;
but more particularly distinguished his retreat by preparing
and publishing his great work on physiology.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the amplitude and success of Hal∣ler's
labours in the various branches of medical knowledge,
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
it was principally on physiology, which seems to have been
his peculiar delight, that he displayed the whole force of his
genius, and founded his merit as an <HI>inventor</HI> in science.</P>
<P>HIS Outlines of Physiology, or <HI>Primae Lineae Physiologicae,</HI>
published at Gottingen in 1747, delineate the plan, and were
the prelude to his immortal work, which he modestly styles
<HI>Elements</HI> only, or <HI>Elementa Physiolygiae corporis humani,</HI> in
eight volumes in quarto, which successively made their ap∣pearance
from 1757 to 1766. In conformity to Boerhaave's
plan, this part of the science of physic is here emancipated
from theoretical subtlety, from metaphysical, mechanical,
and chymical hypotheses, with which, for ages, it had been
incumbered; and was, for the first time, built on the true basis
of anatomical knowledge. The exquisite knowledge which
he had displayed in relation to the structure of the human
body, his indefatigable researches into the facts and opi∣nions
of all his predecessors, the judicious selection of them
to establish his own, his skill in comparative anatomy, the
extent of his discoveries, and the application of the whole to
illustrate the use of the parts in the human frame, afford
such an instance of learning, industry, penetration, and ge∣nius,
as will undoubtedly transmit the author's name to po∣sterity
among the greatest contributors to useful knowledge.</P>
<P>ON his return to Berne he was elected member of the cham∣ber
of appeal for the German district, of the council of finan∣ces,
of the committees for matrimonial affairs, and for im∣proving
the small livings in the French district of the can∣ton:
he was also appointed perpetual assessor of the Council
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
of Health, with an annual salary of about £. 100, as a token
of his country's gratitude for having declined so many splen∣did
offers from foreign courts, and for preferring his native
place to the advancement of his fortune.</P>
<P>IN these several offices he performed essential services to
the state, by promoting the most useful institutions, propos∣ing
necessary alterations, and in framing new laws and ordi∣nances.
In his capacity of assessor to the Chamber of Health, he
was particularly useful in forwarding the most important re∣gulations;
such as the prohibition of empirics, the recovery
of drowned persons, and the means to prevent the spreading
of the infectious distemper then prevalent among the cattle
in various parts of Europe. He shewed himself a friend to
humanity, by the zeal with which he assisted in obtaining
from government a public establishment for orphans, by his
activity in providing it with a fund, and by drawing up the
plan. As a member of the Oeconomical Society, he laboured
much to improve the state of agriculture, and made many
experiments conducive to that end. In the meetings of the
Great Council he delivered, on important occasions, his opi∣nion
with a manly freedom and lively eloquence, the result
of the soundest judgment and the most feeling heart.</P>
<P>IN 1766, and the following years, this great man, who
had hitherto enlightened science from his closet, displayed in
the theatre of public life the more active and distinguished
parts of a patriot and politician. He re-established the har∣mony
and settled the disputes between the Vallais and the
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
canton of Berne by a successful negociation, in which he
fixed the new boundaries of the two states; he was associated
with the most enlightened characters of the republic in ter∣minating
the dissentions of Geneva; he drew up the princi∣pal
dispatches to the court of Versailles on the subject of the
changes which had been projected at Versoi, on which oc∣casion
he held a personal conference with the French ambas∣sador;
and was employed to prepare the plan of a treaty, which
the canton of Berne contracted with the Elector of Bavaria
relating to the purchase of salt.</P>
<P>ON the conclusion of these public employments, Haller,
who had now attained the sixty-second year of his age, with∣drew
himself again from the bustle of life, and lived in a
more retired manner, fulfilling the duties of a father, a citi∣zen,
and a magistrate; and, although his health gradually
declined, yet his activity still remained undiminished. He
resumed his literary labours, which had been necessarily in∣terrupted
amidst his other more important avocations. He
published, in 1768, his history of Swiss plants, mentioned
above; and, in 1771, the first part of his <HI>Bibliotheca Medicinae</HI>
or his Medical Library.</P>
<P>No part of Haller's writings affords a more striking ex∣ample
of the value of early and persevering industry, than
this publication. That habit which he had formed, so early
as from the eighteenth year of his age, of noting his opinion
of books and authors, necessarily accumulated a considerable
mass of materials; and thus enabled him to turn them to
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
very useful purposes. By these means the foundation of his
<HI>Medical Library</HI> was laid, even before he gave the improved
edition of Boerhaave's <HI>Methodus Studii Medici,</HI> in 1751.</P>
<P>BOERHAAVE used to recommend to his students the books
which they ought to consult on each subject: this catalogue
was, in 1726, surreptitiously and inaccurately printed, and
formed only a small volume in octavo; many necessary ob∣servations
were forgotten, and various authors both modern
and antient were omitted. Haller undertook to supply these
deficiences; and extended the publication to two volumes in
quarto. In order to appreciate the merits of this compila∣tion,
it is necessary to observe, that various lexicons and ca∣talogues
of medical authors were extant; but the writers had
merely given bare lists and titles, unaccompanied by that cri∣tical
discrimination of the design, doctrine, and general merit
of each author, which rendered these volumes so highly ac∣ceptable.
In this manner Haller has given, under that clas∣sical
method which Boerhaave had formed, his opinion of
more than 4, 000 volumes.</P>
<P>IN the prosecution of this plan, as it appears in his
own <HI>Bibliotheca,</HI> Haller traces the history of each branch of
medicine from its origin; and by following the history
of each in the several periods, has, in some measure,
made his publication a compendious history of physic. His
extensive acquaintance with antient and modern languages,
enabled him to comprehend a large field; and his indefa∣tigable
industry, united to great penetration in investigating
the doctrines of the antients, equally exhibits his erudition
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
and that sound judgment by which he has appreciated the
merit of those sages of physic, in a manner highly interest∣ing
and instructive. In his judgment of the moderns he is
candid and impartial; his great knowledge of his subjects
qualified him to distinguish all original doctrines, new facts,
and observations, and to guard against such errors as might
mislead young and incautious practitioners; who are but too
apt to be influenced in their practice, by imbibed theories,
and prejudice towards particular authors.</P>
<P>HE has given additional value to his work, by annexing
to the account of celebrated books, short biographical anec∣dotes
of the author. He mentions all the different editions,
that came to his knowledge, and particularly marks such as
were in his own library. And it is a matter of astonish∣ment,
that in this manner he notices and reviews not fewer
than 11,000 volumes. As the literary history of physic was
among the favourite objects of Haller, this publication can∣not
but be highly acceptable to such as possess a congenial taste;
while the general use and information they afford are suffici∣ently
obvious. Eight volumes of this work were published
between the years 1771 and 1778. The anatomical, including
the physiology, the botanical, and the chirurgical, were each
comprised in two volumes, and bring down the respective
subjects nearly to the present time. Two, on the practice of
physic, were published by Haller, a third after his decease by
Dr. Tribolet, and a fourth by Dr. Brandis of Childensheim,
from the manuscript of Haller, which the learned author has
considerably augmented.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51"/>
HALLER employed the latter period of his life in sending
extracts from eminent publications for the <HI>Bibliotheque Rai∣sonnee;</HI>
furnished many of the articles for the supplement to
the Paris Encyclopédie, for the quarto improved edition of
the same work published at Yverdun, and for the dictionary
of natural history printed at the same place. He meditated
also a new edition of his great physiological work, of which
he put forth the first volume in 1777, only a few months
before his death.</P>
<P>HIS active imagination brooding on the civil and politi∣cal
affairs, in which he had been lately engaged, produced,
between 1771 and 1774, his three political romances, Usong,
Fabius and Cato, and Alfred, which treat of the despotic, re∣publican,
and monarchical forms of government. In Usong
he sketches, with a masterly hand, the abuses of absolute
authority, and sets forth, in the character of the principal
personage, the happy effects which may be derived from a
virtuous and intelligent sovereign, even amidst the horrors
of oriental despotism. In Fabius and Cato he describes,
with an animation and spirit worthy of antient Rome, but
with a partiality natural to a republican, the aristocratical
government as most friendly to the display of patriotism,
and most congenial to the exertions of genius. In these ro∣mances
he discovers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound principles of legislation, great po∣litical
sagacity, a deep insight into human nature, and a most
extensive acquaintance with history. In Alfred he displays
the advantages of a limited monarchy, wherein the balance
of power is wisely distributed; and which, while it avoids
the extremes of either, enjoys the benefits of both.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="52"/>
WHEN we consider Haller as a man of piety and a Chris∣tian,
we observe him tracing, from a comprehensive view
of the creation in its grandest as well as in its minutest parts,
the <HI>necessary</HI> existence of a Supreme Being, and the great
principles of natural religion. We shall see him demon∣strating
the divine origin of Christianity from a profound
study of the New Testament, from the excellence of its
morality, its manifest influence over the happiness of man∣kind,
and its tendency to meliorate our nature; and we
shall find him proving himself, both in his life and writings,
a zealous friend and able advocate of the revealed doctrines.</P>
<P>HALLER, at a very early period of his life, undertook
the defence of natural and revealed religion on all occasions.
In 1732 he declared, in his preface to his poetry, that he was
firmly convinced of their truth; in 1747, he rejected with
horror the dedication which La Metrie offered to prefix to
his work entitled “<HI>L'Homme Machine;</HI>” and he declared,
in various literary journals, that he neither acknowledged as
his friend, or his disciple, a man who entertained such im∣pious
notions. In a preface which he published in 1751, to
Formey's abridgement of Crouzas's “<HI>Examen du Pyrrho∣nisme,</HI>”
he paints, in the strongest colours, the dreadful
effects of insidelity both on society and individuals. He put
forth, in the German tongue, “Letters to his Daughter, on
the Truth of the Christian Revelation;” he published an
extract from Ditton's “Truth of the Resurrection of Jesus
Christ,” which he acknowledges to have first cleared any
doubts he might entertain on that subject. He avows, at
the same time, that he received infinite satisfaction from the
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
study of the New Testament, because he was never more
certain of holding converse with the Deity, than when he
read his <HI>will</HI> in that divine book.</P>
<P>IN 1775, he finally gave to the public, also in the German
language, “Letters concerning several late Attempts of
Freethinkers yet living against Revelation.” In this work the
author examines and refutes the objections to Christianity,
advanced in so lively and dangerous a manner by Voltaire in
his <HI>Questions sur l'Encyclopedie.</HI> “If this latter publication,”
adds Sennebier, “may be considered as an Index to the
Doubts and Arguments against the Christian Religion, the
work of Haller may be entitled an Index to the Answers in
favour of the same Revelation, to be consulted by those
who wish impartially to discuss both sides of this important
question.” When learning and philosophy, instead of being
employed in supporting sceptical tenets by artful sophistry,
thus lend their united assistance to the cause of religion,
they truly become an honour to the professor, and a benefit
to society.</P>
<P>BUT even this great and good man was not exempt from
a too anxious solicitude for his welfare in a future state.
That depression of spirits, which ought justly to be considered
as the effects of disease, and the warmth of his imagination
conspiring perhaps with the narrow principles of Calvinism,
in which he had been educated, led him to reflect rather on
the <HI>justice</HI> than the <HI>mercy</HI> of the Deity, and to bewilder
himself in the endless mazes of predestination and grace.
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
In one of his desponding fits, he compared himself, as un∣certain
of salvation, to a man placed on the edge of a precipice
without any support, and expecting every instant to fall.
At another moment, animated with a passion for science,
he breaks out, in a letter to his friend Bonnet, into an ex∣clamation,
expressive of his regret to quit a world which he
had improved by his discoveries, and which he might still
further illuminate by his zeal and application. “O my poor
brain, which must return to dust; and all the knowledge
and information which I have been collecting with such un∣wearied
labour, will <HI>fade away</HI> like the dream of an infant.”</P>
<P>THESE little weaknesses of a great mind overpowered
by constitutional irritability, and struggling against early pre∣judices,
are more interesting to the man who feels and re∣spects
the imperfections of human nature, even in its most
exalted state, than the most pompous and exaggerated ac∣counts
of <HI>unerring</HI> wisdom, or <HI>uniform</HI> virtue which never
existed. It is, however, a pleasing satisfaction to learn, that
reason and religion rose superior to the gloomy despondency
of sickness; and that Haller met death with the calmness of
a philosopher, and the faith of a Christian. In the last letter
which he wrote, a few days before his decease, he speaks
indeed of the tremendous grandeur of eternity, but with
hopes rather than with fears; and looks back upon his past
life with satisfaction: amidst a few complaints uttered on
his painful sufferings, he mentions his country with the most
ardent affection, and offers up his last prayers for its pre∣servation
and welfare.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="55"/>
HE continued his literary labours, and preserved his
senses and composure to the last moment; he beheld his
end approaching without fear and regret; “My friend,” said
he to the physician who attended him, “I die, my pulse is
stopped,” and then expired. He expired on the 12th of De∣cember
1777, in the seventieth year of his age.—Thus lived,
and thus died, the great Haller; a man to whom Michaelis,
the eminent orientalist, justly applies an observation which
had been made on the genius of Aristotle; “<HI>Neque caelo,
neque terrâ, neque mari quicquam relinquere voluit incogni∣tum,
indole praeterea adeo mirabili, ut ad singula natum
praecipuè dicas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He left nothing unexplored, either in the heavens, on the earth, or in the sea, and was of such wonderful capacity, that he seemed born for the immediate object of his pursuit.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IN his person Haller was tall and majestic, of a serious
and expressive countenance; he had at times an open smile,
always a pleasing tone of voice, usually low, and seldom
elevated, even when he was most agitated. He was fond of
unbending himself in society, was on those occasions re∣markably
cheerful, polite, and attentive; he would con∣verse
with the ladies on fashions, modes of dress, and other
trifles, with as much ease as if he had never secluded him∣self
from the world.</P>
<P>MR. BONNET informed me, that Haller wrote with equal
facility the German, French, and Latin tongues; that he was
so well acquainted with all the European languages, except
the Russian, Polish, and Hungarian, as to speak with the
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
natives in their respective idioms. When he conversed on
any topic of literature, his knowledge was so extensive, that
he seemed to have made that subject his particular study.
His profound erudition in every branch of science, is well
known to all who are conversant with his works: but the
variety of his information, and the versatility of his talents,
are delineated by a person<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>charner Lobrede, &amp;c. p. 87.</NOTE> who was his particular friend.
“He possessed a fundamental knowledge of natural history;
was well read in history both antient and modern, universal
and particular; and uncommonly versed in the state of agri∣culture,
manufactures, trade, population, literature, and
languages of the respective nations of Europe: he had read
with attention the most remarkable voyages and travels; and
was particularly conversant in the late discoveries which
tend to illustrate the geography of the globe. He had even
perused many thousand novels and plays; and possessed
such an astonishing memory, that he could detail their con∣tents
with the utmost precision.”</P>
<P>As it was his custom to make extracts, and to give his
opinion of every book which came into his hands, as well
for his own private use, as for the Gottingen Review<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Haller reviewed, as his department for that literary journal, all publications on history, medicine, anatomy, natural history, and several miscellaneous works, particularly those which appeared in Italy.</NOTE>,
he read most new publications, and so eager was he usually
in the perusal, that he laid them upon the table even when
he was at dinner, occasionally looking into them, and mark∣ing
those parts with a pencil, which he afterwards extracted
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
or commented upon. He was accustomed to make his re∣marks
on small pieces of paper, of different sizes, which he
placed in order, and fastened together: a method he learned
from Leibnitz.</P>
<P>HE derived from nature extreme sensibility, or rather
irritability of temper, which is ever the child of genius. He
spoke therefore from his own experience, when, in a letter
to Voltaire he thus expressed himself:—“Providence holds
with an equal hand the balance of human happiness. He
has loaded you with riches, he has loaded you with glory;
but misfortune was necessary, and he preserved the equili∣brium
by giving you sensibility. If my wishes could take
effect, I would bestow upon you that <HI>tranquillity</HI> which
flies at the approach of genius, which is inferior to genius
in relation to society, but far superior in regard to ourselves:
then the most celebrated man in Europe should be at the
same time the most happy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Il faut bien que la providence veuille tenir la balance égale pour tous les humains. Elle vous a comblé de biens, elle vous a comblé de gloire; mais il vous salloit du malheur, elle a trouvé l'équilibre en vous rendant sensible.—Si les souhaits avoient du pouvoir, j'ajou∣terois aux biensaits du destin; je vous don∣nerois de la tranquillité, qui fuit devant le genie, qui ne le vaut pas par rapport à la soci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>té mais qui vaut bien davantage par rapport à nous-même: des-lors l'homme le plus célébre de l'Europe seroit aussi le plus heu∣reux.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>HE was always impatient under sickness as well from
his extreme susceptibility of pain, as because he was pre∣cluded
in that situation from his literary occupations. He
was fond, therefore, of taking violent remedies, more cal∣culated
to remove the immediate effects of pain, and to
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
check his disorder, than to cure it radically. In his latter
years he accustomed himself to opium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zimmerman informs us, that he took daily so large a quantity as eight grains. U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ber die Einsamkeit, p. 216. ed. Leips. 1784.</NOTE>, which, operating
as a temporary palliative, only increased his natural im∣patience.
This restlessness of temper, which occasionally
disturbed his tranquillity even in his younger days, and in
the full flow of his health and spirits, was considerably height∣ened
by the advances of age, and the disorders which
shattered his frame towards the close of his days.</P>
<P>HIS correspondence in every period of his life was ex∣tensive,
punctual, and carried on in the English, French,
German, Latin, and Italian languages. Six volumes of Latin
epistles, and three in the German tongue, addressed to him
from men of learning in various parts of Europe, have
been given to the public, but his own have never made their
appearance. It is much to be lamented, that he seldom
preserved any copies, being himself too much occupied for
that purpose; and never sufficiently rich to maintain a secre∣tary.
His two principal correspondents, to whom he opened
his heart, were Bonnet of Geneva, and John Gesner of
Zuric: to the latter he wrote either in German or Latin,
to Mr. Bonnet in the French tongue. This celebrated friend
of Haller possesses seven manuscript volumes of his letters:
it was an uninterrupted correspondence of twenty-three
years; begun in March 1754, and finishing only a few days
before his death, in December 1777. This epistolary com∣merce
comprehends a great variety of subjects, principally
concerning physiology, natural history, the structure of the
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
globe, politics, morality and religion. Haller being ac∣customed
to consult his friend on all occasions, to disclose
his most secret thoughts, and to relate his diurnal occupa∣tions;
these effusions of the moment discover the successive
train of his studies, the progress of his discoveries, and his
gradual advances in knowledge.</P>
<P>“THESE letters of my most respectable friend,” added
Bonnet, “display his genius, his understanding, and the
goodness of his heart, more fully than any of his publica∣tions.
His style, concise, energetic yet picturesque, corre∣sponds
with the strength and originality of his ideas; and he
speaks, with no less sublimity than conviction, of the great
truths of natural and revealed religion. Though he treats
the numerous advocates for infidelity, and particularly
Voltaire, with sufficient severity; yet his heat is the ardour
of conviction, and did not proceed from either pique or
spirit of contradiction: he seemed as if he was personally
interested in all questions on revelation, and pleaded its cause
as if it had been his own. He is no less severe against those
writers, who seem to exclude the intervention of a first in∣tellectual
cause in the creation and arrangement of the
universe, and particularly censures the materialists, who
endeavour to deduce mechanically the formation of organized
bodies. In a word, his philosophy was entirely practical,
because it was entirely Christian; and nothing secured his
approbation, but what tended to improve the understanding,
or to amend the heart.” I am concerned to find, that the
publication of this correspondence, between two such en∣lightened
and virtuous philosophers as Haller and Bonnet,
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
which in some works had been announced to the public,
should, on account of private reasons, be relinquished.
Religion, morality, philosophy, and learning, would be
greatly benefited by this epistolary commerce.</P>
<P>HALLER'S library, consisting of about 4, 000 volumes,
was purchased for £. 2, 000 by the emperor, for the public
library of Milan, where I examined it in 1785. The col∣lection
is particularly rich in books of natural history, and
is rendered invaluable from numerous annotations of Haller,
written on the margins.</P>
<P>HALLER was three times married, first to Marianne
Wytsen, in 1731, who died in 1736. 2. To Elizabeth
Buchers, in 1738, who died in childbed the same or the
following year; both natives of Berne. 3. In 1739, to
Amelia Frederica Teichmeyer, a German lady, who sur∣vived
him. He has written and published the lives of his
two first wives. He left eight children, four sons and four
daughters, all of whom he lived to see established. His
eldest Gotlieb Emanuel, who was born in 1735, followed
his father's example in dedicating himself to the service
of his country, and to the pursuits of literature. He
was elected member of the Great Council, and obtained
various employments under government, particularly the
bailliage of Nyon, in which situation he died in 1786. He
distinguished himself as an author by various publications
tending to illustrate the history and literature of Switzer∣land,
and particularly by his <HI>Schweilzer-bibliothek,</HI> or Swiss
Library, in six volumes 8vo. of which he lived to publish
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
only the first. In this work, deservedly esteemed for its
method and accuracy, the indefatigable author enumerates
all the books which treat of Switzerland, in all languages,
and all the works published by the Swiss on all subjects.
He even descends to the minutest articles which have ap∣peared
in reviews and journals; and in most instances,
where the publication deserves detail, analyses the contents,
corrects the errors, and gives his opinion on the merits of
the performance. I was personally acquainted with the
learned author, and am indebted to him for some curious
information on Switzerland, and for several anecdotes re∣lative
to his illustrious father, which I have introduced
into these biographical memoirs.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">MR. SPRUNGLI'S COLLECTION OF SWISS BIRDS—OF
THE BEARDED VULTURE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. SPRUNGLI'S cabinet of natural history, is remark∣able
for the collection of stuffed birds, both local
and migratory, that are found in Switzerland. In 1776 this
collection consisted of two hundred specimens; and when I
last visited Berne, in 1786, it had received an addition of fifty
species. As naturalists have long expected with impatience
an account of this invaluable collection, I obtained from Mr.
Sprungli the enclosed catalogue, which will assist me in at∣tempting
to form a <HI>Faunula Helvetica</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the end of this volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE of the most remarkable birds in Mr. Sprungli's col∣lection,
is the <HI>vultur barbatus</HI> of Linnaeus, the <HI>vultur aureus</HI>
of Gesner, or bearded vulture of the English ornithologists.
As many fabulous tales have been related concerning its un∣common
strength and rapaciousness; as great confusion has
arisen from the variety of names applied by different natu∣ralists
to the same bird; and as some travellers have doubted
whether this specimen is the large vulture of the Alps, or
the golden vulture of Conrad Gesner; I shall therefore sub∣join
a description from particulars principally communicated
to me by Mr. Sprungli himself, accompanied with a draw∣ing
<PB REF="63"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
of the head from the natural size. This specimen was a
female bird, caught in the canton of Glarus; it measured
from the tip of the beak to the extremity of the tail, six feet
six inches French<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Six feet eleven inches▪ English, and eight feet six inches <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>15.</NOTE> measure; and eight feet from the tip of
one wing to that of the other expanded. It weighed, when
first taken, eleven pounds. This bird, though always called
a vulture, yet differs from that genus, and is referable to the
eagle, in having the head and neck covered with feathers;
whereas one of the distinctions of the vulture, according to
Linnaeus, is that the head is destitute of feathers. Notwith∣standing
this distinguishing mark, by which it is referable
to the eagle or <HI>falco</HI> genus; yet Linnaeus was probably in∣duced
to class it with the vultures, from the general form of
the body, and shape of the beak, which is the <HI>first essential</HI>
characteristic in the genera of birds.</P>
<P>MR. SPRUNGLI, however, is of opinion, that it might be
classed between the vulture and the eagle; and Stor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Stor's Alpen Reisin, vol. i.</NOTE> pro∣poses
to form a new genus of it, under the name of GYPAE∣TUS,
by the following characters:
<Q><L>Rostrum rectum, basi cera instructum setis porrectis conser∣tissimis
barbatum; apice auctum unco sulcato.</L>
<L>Caput pennis tectum.</L></Q></P>
<P>The specific character he would define thus:
<Q>Gypaetus (grandis) albido-rutilus dorso fuscus, taenia nigra
supra et infra oculos.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="65"/>
IT inhabits the highest parts of the great chain of the
Alps which separates Switzerland from Italy, makes its nest
in clefts of rocks inaccessible to man, and usually produces
three young ones at a time, sometimes four, if we may judge
from that number accompanying the old birds, when they
descend into the lower regions for prey. They live on ani∣mals
which inhabit the Alps, such as the chamois, white
hares, marmots, snow hens, kids, and particularly lambs,
from which circumstance it is called <HI>lammer-geyer,</HI> or <HI>lamb</HI>
vulture. If common report may be credited, this rapacious
creature sometimes attacks even man, and carries off chil∣dren.
Mr. Sprungli, without absolutely denying the possibi∣lity
of this account, has, notwithstanding all his researches,
never been able to ascertain a well-authenticated instance;
and thence rather concludes it to be a fable invented by the
peasants to frighten their children. This species does not
appear but in small companies, usually consisting of the two
old birds and their young.</P>
<P>CONARD GESNER has given a short but accurate descrip∣tion
of this bird under the name of <HI>vultur aureus,</HI> or
goldgeyer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Hist. Avium, edit. Frank. <HI>p.</HI> 710.</NOTE>; and an engraving from a skin sent to him
from the Grisons. This figure, although rudely executed,
yet exhibits with sufficient accuracy the distinguishing cha∣racters
of the species and genus, such as the configura∣tion
of the beak, the legs feathered down to the claws, and
particularly the beard. In fine, a comparison with the spe∣cimen
in Mr. Sprungli's collection evidently proves that it is
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
the same bird. Since this great naturalist, no other person
seems to have described it from nature, except Edwards,
under the denomination of the bearded vulture. The de∣scription
of that bird, and the engraving given by Edwards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tab. 106. of his History.</NOTE>
from a specimen sent from Santa Cruz in Barbary, corre∣spond
exactly with the <HI>vultur barbatus</HI> of Sprungli; and the
head, if compared with the drawing annexed to this account,
will be found to answer sufficiently.</P>
<P>MR. SPRUNGLI favoured me with the following remarks,
in answer to those travellers who assert, that his specimen is
not the large vulture of the Alps, sometimes called, from its
<HI>yellowish</HI> plumage, the <HI>vautour jaune,</HI> but a smaller species;
because the larger sort measures sometimes fourteen feet, or
more, from the tip of one wing to that of the other. He
possesses two specimens of this bird; the one a full grown
female, from which my description and drawing are taken,
measuring eight French feet: the other is a male, but young,
and is somewhat less. He has also examined four specimens,
none of which measured more than nine feet; but as these
several specimens were not full grown males, he is ready to
allow, that an instance or two may possibly have occurred,
in which this bird may have measured near twelve feet from
tip to tip of the wing. Those who give it a greater expan∣sion,
have derived their information either from persons who
were not naturalists, or from uncertain and exaggerated re∣ports.
The same remark may also be applied to the fabu∣lous
stories recorded by the peasants, concerning its wonder∣ful
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
strength as well as size. It is likewise to be observed,
that the peasants do not confine the name of <HI>lammer-geyer</HI>
to this species; but extend it indiscriminately to several large
birds of prey, from whence has arisen great confusion of
names, and much uncertainty in the accounts of this bird.</P>
<P>SOME ornithologists seemed to have formed of it several
species, which on comparison will appear to be the same, or
only varieties of the same species. Thus the bearded vulture,
the cinereous vulture, and the fulvous vulture, which Mr. La∣tham
has described as three different species, are probably
the same bird as that in Mr. Sprungli's collection. Of the
first there can be no doubt, since Mr. Latham refers to the
bearded vulture of Edwards, which I have shewn to be that
of Mr. Sprungli. The cinereous vulture is described by La∣tham
after Brisson: “Beneath the throat hangs a kind of
beard, composed of very narrow feathers like hairs; legs
covered with feathers quite to the toes, which are yellow;
claws black<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Syn. <HI>vol.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 14.</NOTE>.” This description accords with the bird in
question, and particularly in the beard, which is the distin∣guishing
characteristic. The fulvous vulture of Latham is
the griffin of Buffon: and the French naturalist doubts whe∣ther
it is not a variety of Gesner's golden vulture, which is
proved to be the same as Mr. Sprungli's specimen.</P>
<P>WHILE the most celebrated ornithologists have thus given
to the bird different names, they have also in other instances
confounded it with other birds, to which it has no other re∣semblance
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
than that of size, strength, and voracity. Thus
Buffon erroneously conjectures the <HI>vultur gryphus</HI> of Lin∣naeus,
or the <HI>condor</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Latham, in his supplement to the General Synopsis of Birds, p. 1. seems also to adopt the conjecture of Buffon, in classing the Lammer-geyer and Condor under the same species; though he confesses, “that it still remains dubious, whether the Lammer∣geyer be the same with the Condor, or a mere variety of the Bearded Vulture” He adds also, with a candour which does him honour, “It is much to be feared, that other authors, as well as myself, have greatly confounded the species of Vultures; for being like the Falcon tribe, long lived, their plumage puts on a great variety of dress, suf∣ficient to deceive those who have hitherto at∣tempted to discriminate them.”</NOTE> of America, to be the same as the <HI>lam∣mer-geyer,</HI>
or vulture of the Alps; whereas the description
of the condor given by Linnaeus, as well as by those who had
seen it, differs entirely from that of the bearded vulture.
The condor is described by the Swede as having “the head
destitute of feathers, but covered with a slight brown co∣loured
down, with a comb reaching along the top of the
head, and having the throat naked and of a reddish colour.”
Frezier, in his Voyage to the South Seas, also thus describes
the condor:—“We one day killed a bird of prey called a
condor, which was nine feet from the end of one wing to
the end of the other, and had a brown comb or crest, but
not jagged like a cock's: the fore part of its throat is red
without feathers, like a turkey; and they are generally large
and strong enough to take up a lamb. In order to get them
from the flock, they draw themselves into a circle, and ad∣vance
towards them with their wings extended, that being
drove together, and too close, they may not be able to de∣fend
themselves; then they pick them out and carry them
off. Garcilasso says, there are some in Peru sixteen feet from
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
the point of one wing to the other, and that a certain nation
of Indians adored them.”</P>
<P>MR. LATHAM seems also to be no less mistaken, when, on
the authority of the translator of the Abbè Fortis's Travels into
Dalmatia, he conceives the <HI>vultur percnopterus</HI> of Linnaeus
to be the <HI>vautour des Alpes</HI> described by Conrad Gesner, and
the same as Mr. Sprungli's specimen; whereas, on the au∣thority
of Hasselquist, who saw great numbers of the <HI>per∣cnopteri</HI>
in Egypt, the head of that bird is “naked and
wrinkled,” and Ray says, the feet are naked; two characters
that essentially distinguish it from the bearded vulture, in
which the head is wholly covered with feathers, and also
the feet down to the ends of the claws.</P>
<P>THE bearded vulture, besides inhabiting those Alps
which separate Italy from Switzerland, is found in Corsica
and Sardinia. M. de Hahn informed Mr. Sprungli, that he
saw a bird in Corsica which was wounded in the wing, and
shewed as a sight, that was unquestionably the same as Mr.
Sprungli's stuffed specimen: and M. Lettel, in his Natural
History of Sardinia, gives a figure and description of the
same bird, under the name of <HI>bartgeyer,</HI> or bearded vulture.
It has also been found in the mountains of Africa, since Mr.
Edwards received his specimen from Santa Cruz in Barbary.
It is also frequent on Caucasus and the mountains of Dauria,
or the south-eastern part of Siberia, as we learn from the
travels of both Pallas and Gmelin.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="70"/>
You will perhaps be surprised not to find among the
Swiss birds in the annexed catalogue, the <HI>aigle blanc,</HI> or <HI>aquila
alba</HI> of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. p. 424.</NOTE> Brisson; the <HI>falco Italicus</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 336.</NOTE>, and the <HI>falco montanus</HI>
of the same<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 352.</NOTE>; as particularly <HI>zwitzer-falk,</HI> the German
name of the latter, seems necessarily to imply that it must be
a Swiss bird: Mr. Sprungli however assured me, that he
never had been able to discover any of these species in the
Alps; that probably the <HI>aigle blanc,</HI> if it exists, is a variety of
the chrysaetos; and that both Brisson and Willoughby do
not cite Gesner for their descriptions of the <HI>falco Italicus,</HI> but
those only who have never been in the Alps.</P>
<P>OF the crows it is worthy of observation, that the <HI>corvus
graculus</HI> of Linnaeus, or <HI>coracias</HI> of Brisson, is faithfully re∣presented
by Mr. Pennant, in his British Zoology, under the
denomination of the red-legged crow. It is the same bird of
which Conrad Gesner<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hist. Av. ed. Frank. <HI>p.</HI> 468.</NOTE> has given a figure, and to which he
applies the German appellations, <HI>taba, steintahen, steinkrae,</HI>
and which he justly suspects to be the <HI>cornix cornubiae,</HI> or the
red-legged crow. The <HI>pyrrhocorax</HI> of Gesner, which some
ornithologists seem to have confounded with the <HI>corvus gra∣culus,</HI>
is however very different, and is called by Linnaeus
<HI>corvus pyrrhocorax.</HI> Both these species inhabit the Alps,
but the pyrrhocorax is the most common; and these appear,
according to Mr. Sprungli's observations, to be the only spe∣cies
of the crow genus that prefer to all others alpine situa∣tions.
As to the <HI>corvus eremita</HI> of Linnaeus, Mr. Sprungli
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
acknowledges it is totally unknown to him. All the orni∣thologists
indeed mention this bird as an inhabitant of the
Alps, on the authority of Conrad Gesner, who describes it
under the name of <HI>corvus sylvaticus,</HI> accompanied with a
figure, which has not the least resemblance to a crow, but
rather to a curlew; yet Gesner's description of it is much too
imperfect to assist us in ascertaining the bird of which he
treats.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 59.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MR. WYTTENBACH'S COLLECTION—ACCOUNT OF
THE CHAIN OF HILLS AND ALPS SEEN FROM
THE ENVIRONS OF BERNE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reverend Mr. Wyttenbach of Berne, possesses a
very curious cabinet, principally relating to the natu∣ral
history of Switzerland, and of the canton of Berne in par∣ticular.
It contains specimens of several thousand plants,
among which is a large number of the alpine plants of Swit∣zerland;
and he has already began to arrange separately the
capsules, seeds, and fruits. It is still more interesting for the
great variety of fossils, stones, and petrifactions collected by
himself in the neighbourhood of Berne, and from the upper
and lower Alps. Mr. Wyttenbach also possesses various
shells, insects, and numerous drawings of the glaciers and
upper alps, which cannot fail of being highly pleasing to the
curious traveller.</P>
<P>BUT I was most struck with that part of his cabinet, com∣prehending
those objects of natural history, which in any de∣gree
influence agriculture, physic, arts and trades; and which
sufficiently prove the utility of that science in the progress and
improvement of human comfort and knowledge. On this
subject he has already published a dissertation in the Acts of
the Oeconomical Society at Berne. He has not formed this
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
ample collection from mere motives of curiosity, or from de∣sultory
views, but with a settled intention to illustrate the
natural history of Switzerland in general; to form a topo∣graphical
and mineralogical description of the canton of Berne
in particular; and to elucidate the original formation of
mountains, which is the favourite object of his researches,
and which his frequent visits to the Alps will assist him in
executing with fidelity and accuracy.</P>
<P>AT my request, this indefatigable observer favoured me
with a plan and description of that range of alps which is
seen from Berne, and of the intervening district; an extract
from which I now submit to your perusal.</P>
<P>THAT part of the chain of alps seen from Berne, distin∣guished
by the different names of Wetterhorn, Schreckhorn,
Eger, Jungfrauhorn, Lauter-Aar-Horn, Blumlis Alp, &amp;c. is
represented on the plan annexed to this letter. You will
there observe this immense amphitheatre, gradually rising
from the environs of Berne, to those elevated peaks, covered
with eternal snow, and hitherto inaccessible. The plains
and hills between Berne and Thun are composed of rounded
stones, and argillaceous stones called <HI>molasses,</HI> frequently
ranged in alternate strata. The <HI>molasse</HI> at Gurten, about
two miles from Berne, contains, though rarely, glassopetrae;
and the strata of Belpberg, about seven or eight miles from
the capital, are full of different species of chamites, ostracites,
globosites, selenites, strombites, and other similar petrifac∣tions.
The ridge of hills which border the high road be∣tween
Berne and Thun contains, in several places, and par∣ticularly
<PB REF="74"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
above Musingen, an extensive stratum of ostracites,
some pieces of which weigh more than fifteen pounds each.
The situation of the strata in these different hills, their direc∣tion,
their nature, and the bodies which they enclose, seem
to prove, that these hills formed antiently one great plain,
which has been since hollowed and divided by the waters,
particularly by those of the Aar.</P>
<P>ON the slopes and summits of these hills, which in some
places are of considerable elevation, are frequently found
those large masses of granite, which furnish materials for
the public works and buildings of Berne. These masses so
nearly resemble the granite of the Grimsel, and of the
mountains which compose the great central chain of the
alps, as to render it probable, that in the antient revolutions
of this globe, they have been brought by the waters to the
places where they are at present found, before the deep val∣lies,
which now separate them from their original moun∣tains,
existed. The same remark may be as justly applied to
the blocks of marble and other calcareous stones, which,
though now removed to a considerable distance from their
native situation, are also discovered in large quantities upon
the hills adjacent to Berne, and which likewise serve for the
buildings of that capital.</P>
<P>As we approach the town and lake of Thun, the view
opens and discovers, towards the south-east, that high calca∣reous
chain, of which the Stockhorn, the Neuneren, and the
Ganterish have been illustrated by the botanical labours of
the celebrated Haller. This chain, which joins that of
<PB N="68" REF="76"/>
Schwartzenburgh towards the canton of Friburgh, is chiefly
calcareous, and contains fewer petrifactions than the above∣mentioned
hills: it is not of sufficient elevation to be co∣vered
with snow in summer. The Niess, which is the last
mountain in this calcareous chain, stands on the borders of
the lake; and separates the valley of Frutingen from that
of Simme. It is peculiarly interesting to travellers, on ac∣count
of the fine view from its summit; and to naturalists,
because it joins to the alps. Towards its foot beds of slate
have been discovered; higher up it is of calcareous stone;
and near its top is found a species of pudding-stone, filled
with small fragments of broken petrifactions.</P>
<P>IN traversing the lake of Thun, its borders, which are
planted with vines, are composed of rounded stones, united
by a calcareous cement, as far as the mountains of St. Beat.
There, near Rallingen, the rocks are calcareous and rugged,
containing, in a few places, broken petrifactions, of which it
is often difficult to ascertain the species. On continuing my
route at the foot of the St. Beat, I observed the first rocks,
that are absolutely perpendicular, and even impending, and
which are marked at different elevations with furrows, occa∣sioned
by the waters of the lake, that, in former periods,
was probably several hundred feet above its present level.
I remarked the same furrows nearly at the same elevations,
in the vallies of Lauterbrunnen and Hasli, which coinci∣dence
seems to prove, that the lake of Thun once extended
over all these parts, covered the whole plain of Berne, and
reached as high as the Lengenberg, where Gruner disco∣vered
those petrifactions called Pholades.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="77"/>
HAVING traversed the lake of Thun, I entered the nar∣row
but agreeable valley of Unterseven and Interlachen, on
each side of which the mountains approach each other,
and form, if I may so express myself, the <HI>vestibule</HI> of the
alps. This valley, separating the lakes of Thun and Brientz,
which appear to have been once united, is entirely formed
by the stones which torrents have brought from the alps.
On the right is Abendberg covered with trees and herbage, and
stretching towards a group of mountains of considerable ex∣tent;
yet little known, though their tops may be seen at
Berne. The Ballenhoechst, Sulek, Schnabelhorn, Schwartz∣berg,
Schwalmern, Schilthorn, Kirchfluh, Latreyenfirst, and
Dreyspitz, are the most remarkable mountains in this group,
which on one side borders the valley of Lauterbrunnen, and
on the other towers opposite to the Niess, at the commence∣ment
of the valley of Frutingen. It is united by means of
the Sefinen alps with the Dents Rouges, and the great cen∣tral
chain of granitical mountains. The mountains of this
group stand on a base of argillaceous schistus, containing a
few petrifactions, which is rarely visible but at certain ele∣vations.
Towards Lauterbrunnen, particularly, a sine-grained
calcareous stone abounds.</P>
<P>To return to the valley of Unterseven. On the left is
another group of calcareous mountains, which extend along
the lake of Brientz towards Hasli, and stand also on an argil∣laceous
schistus, which is but rarely visible. And though
the granitical chain is at a very small distance, it is, however,
so entirely concealed by these secondary mountains, as to be
no where discovered, except between Unterseven and Inter∣lachen,
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
where the Jungfrau presents herself in all her ma∣jesty.
From these delightful plains I attempted to penetrate
towards the granitical chain of alps, through narrow vallies
enclosed between perpendicular rocks of an enormous
height; but every where I met with secondary mountains,
which, to a considerable height, conceal the primitive bed of
granite, and render the approach to it extremely dangerous,
if not impracticable. Thus the valley of Lauterbrunnen is
bordered by calcareous rocks even to its farther extremity.
At Sichellauinen the first masses of granite appear, forming
the base of the calcareous rocks, which are of a very great
height. As I continued my route towards the chain, which
stretches from the Jungfrau to the Grosshorn and Breithorn,
I observed a rock of steatite, in which some veins of lead
have been discovered and worked at Hohalp. Higher up is
the true granitical chain, which, however, even there is fre∣quently
covered with calcareous peaks.</P>
<P>I FOUND the approach to this chain less difficult at
Wengenalp, the last of a group of calcareous and schistous
mountains between Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, which
there joins the Jungfrau, the summits whereof appear to
be of granite. In the valley of Grindelwald I observed
only the argillaceous schistus and calcareous stone: the
external parts of the Eger of the Mettenberg, and of the
Wetterhorn, are chiefly calcareous, and cover the granite of
the central chain; and the only pieces of granite are the
fragments, which are brought into the valley by the two
glaciers. That chain, which is opposite to these glaciers,
and borders the northern side of the valley of Grindelwald,
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
has an argillaceous base, which in several places, particularly
towards Hasli, contains cornua ammones: this base is also
covered with calcareous rocks, through which it often pene∣trates
at different heights.</P>
<P>I WILL now take a nearer view of the primitive chain,
and trace the alps in the same order as they are marked upon
the annexed plan. I shall consider the Jungfrau as the
center, from which I will take my departure on one side to∣wards
the Gemmi, and on the other towards the Schreck∣horn,
Wetterhorn, and Grimsel.</P>
<P>THE Jungfrau, or Virgin, is one of the highest and most
beautiful mountains in the canton of Berne. The granite
does not appear till a very considerable elevation; its foot
being in most parts covered by rocks, which are of calcare∣ous
stone, called by the natives <HI>Staldenflub,</HI> of which an ele∣vated
peak is denominated the Monk. On following these
rocks to Sichellauinen, about two leagues from Lauterbrun∣nen,
I observed a red stratum, that seems to form the sepa∣ration
between the granite and the calcareous substance: it
is composed of an argillaceous slate of red colour, spotted
with brown and green, and of a fine-grained iron ore (as I
was surprised to find) containing anomites. I observed the
same stratum at the bottom of the Eger and Wetterhorn, and
of several mountains towards Hasli: I remarked it at different
heights; but as all access to them has been hitherto found
impracticable, I cannot attempt to explain a phaenomenon,
which merits a nearer investigation. The chain of the
Jungfrau stretches to the right by those inaccessible peaks
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
called the Gletscherhorn, Ebenfluh, Mittaghorn, Grosshorn,
Breithorn. I am entirely unacquainted with their structure,
except from the fragments, which I have observed at their
feet, or on the masses of ice descending from their tops.
Limestone occurs at very considerable heights; particularly
white marble, and a fine grey marble, which is the matrix of
a red hematite filled with innumerable small chrystals of
iron of an octagon figure, and attractable by the magnet.</P>
<P>BESIDES these stones, I noticed on the glaciers of Breit∣lauinen
and Breithorn, various species of granite, both fo∣liated
and in blocks, of iron-stone, of <HI>saxum fornacum,</HI> or
<HI>stelstein,</HI> and of argillaceous and micaceous schistus. All these
fragments sufficiently prove, that granite prevails in the
higher parts, although it is frequently covered with secon∣dary
mountains. To the right is the majestic Blumlis alp,
which is a fine object from the plains: a large glacier,
mentioned by no author, stretches at its feet. I first noticed
it from the opposite heights of Oeschenengrat, and at the
same time observed, that the feet of the Alpschelenhorn and
Blumlis alp are covered with black schistus, and that the
granite is not apparent, but at a great height.</P>
<P>A FEW days after this expedition, I mounted to the sum∣mit
of the glacier, called by the peasants Gamchigletscher,
where it forms a very steep ridge towards the valley of
Lauterbrunnen. From thence I beheld the vast amphitheatre
of the Luterbrunnen glaciers: I remarked also, that the valley
of Lauterbrunnen ends at this place; that it has only one
issue behind Blumlis alp, where a large glacier, with a plain
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
and unbroken surface, stretches towards the valley of Gaster.
Here then is the extremity of the valley of Lauterbrunnen,
which expands at the feet of the Eger and the Jungfrau,
continues almost in a strait line as far as Sichellauinen to the
foot of the Gletcher-horn and of the glacier of Stuffistein,
where it forms an angle, and bends towards Blumlis alp.
The ridge of the glacier of Gamchi is of a black calcareous
stone, which, in many places, is of a fine texture, and splits
into lamina of a rhomboidal form: in other parts it is coarsely
granulated, containing white and black spar. The sides of
the Blumlis alp, that border the glacier, are black slate, in
which I found several balemnites, and a fragment of a cornu
ammonis a foot in diameter. The pieces of granite which
are discovered upon the glacier, and which most probably
fell from the summits of the Blumlis alp and of the Dents
Rouges, is very similar to that granite, in which the veins
of lead are traced near Sichellauinen in the valley of Lau∣terbrunnen.
The granitical chain, which extends on the
right by the Alpschelenhorn, and the Altits, is entirely con∣cealed
and lost in Mount Gemmi, where only calcareous
stone and slate are discovered. As I have not yet had any
opportunity to examine the mountains of Simmenthal and
of Gessenay, I cannot inform you, if the granite appears
through any of their calcareous covering.</P>
<P>BUT let us return to the Jungfrau, and trace the moun∣tains
towards Grindelwald and the Grimsel. The two high
pyramids which tower near the Jungfrau are the two
Egers, called from their position Exterior and Interior. Cal∣careous
stone is visible to a great height. Many persons
indeed pretend, that the whole side of the Exterior Eger,
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>
towards Grindelwald is entirely calcareous; but I am con∣vinced,
from repeated observations, that the substance of
these mountains is granite, though it is covered with cal∣careous
stone lying on reddish slate, which in many places
forms a species of brescia, composed of an argillaceous base,
covered with calcareous fragments. You observe behind
the Exterior Eger two small peaks, which seem united by a
ridge: these are the Viescherhorn and Zesenberg, which
overlook the inferior glacier of Grindelwald. The stones
that have fallen on the glacier show, that their summits, as
well as that of the Schreckhorn, are of granite in blocks,
veined granite, and other lamellated rocks, which frequently
contain green steatites, amianthus, and chrystals of quartz.</P>
<P>THE high peak, which appears to stand near the Zesen∣berg,
is at a very considerable distance, and probably sepa∣rated
from it by large vallies of ice. This peak, that has
hitherto escaped the mention of travellers, seems to be the
Finster-aar-horn, which can only be approached from the
Grimsel; and by traversing the glacier of the Aar. I have
seen it from the summits of the St. Gothard, from one of the
heights which separate the valley of Grindelwald from the
lake of Brientz; I have been at its foot upon the glacier of
the Finster-aar; and on all sides, and in all places, its elevation
is stupendous, and appears to me to exceed even that of the
Schreckhorn, which has been hitherto considered as the
highest.</P>
<P>THE Schreckhorn, or peak of terror, rises between the
two glaciers of Grindelwald. Concealed by its base, the Met∣tenberg,
it is not seen from the valley of Grindelwald; and
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
the rugged paths which lead across the superior glacier to
its foot, are extremely difficult and dangerous. Part of it is
observed from that glacier. The tops of the Mettenberg are
of granite, and its lower parts of lamellated rock, blended
with mica and quartz. The piked summits of the Schreck∣horn,
which rise to an enormous height, appear to be of
pure granite and other primitive stones. The next in this
chain, is the Wetterhorn, or Stormy Peak, whose perpen∣dicular
sides border the superior glacier. The exterior part
of this mountain is of calcareous stone to a very considerable
elevation, but its summits are undoubtedly of primitive rock.
I noticed along its sides the same red stratum, which makes
its appearance on the Eger and at the foot of the Jungfrau.
Behind the Wetterhorn is seen an elevated rock, which is
said by the inhabitants of Grindelwald to border the glacier
of the Lauter-aar, and which from thence has been ascended
by several <HI>chasseurs.</HI> On examining the stones which have
been brought down by the superior glacier, I did not dis∣cover
much granite in mass, but often veined granite, and
lamellated rock, which frequently enclose pieces of the cor∣neus
spathosus mixed with steatites, pyrites, and quartz.
The foot of the Wetterhorn and that of the Mettenberg
contain, in several places, a fine species of white marble,
with red, green, and yellow veins: a quarry of which, now
covered by the inferior glacier, was formerly worked.</P>
<P>IN passing from Grindelwald to Meyringen, I traversed
the Scheidek, which entirely consists of black slate, that
stands on the foot of the Wetterhorn. This slate continues
to compose the chain that divides Grindelwald from the
<PB N="76" REF="84"/>
plains of Hasli and the lake of Brientz. As I descended the
Scheidek, I observed, on my right hand, the chain that joins
the Wetterhorn and runs towards the Grimsel. As I have
not particularly examined this chain, I shall only remark in
general, that from an investigation of the stones and frag∣ments
which strew the vallies and sides of the hills, it ap∣pears
to contain the same species of marble which I found
on the superior glacier of Grindelwald, also red slate, argil∣laceous
brescia, and various granites. But this much is cer∣tain,
that the front of these mountains is entirely concealed
by secondary substances; and the true region of granite was
not apparent, until I had passed Meyringen and ascended
the Grimsel, during the greatest part of which ascent I only
noticed lamellated rocks and granite. All the mountains
which form the Grimsel and the neighbouring chain, are
concealed in my plan by the Wetterhorn; they extend
behind the Schreckhorn as far as the Finster-aar-horn. This
is the true region of granite and other primitive rocks, the
heart of the central chain, and the great observatory of the
naturalist.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">EXCURSION TO THUN, WORBE, AND HINDELBANK—TOMB
OF MADAME LANGHANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE environs of Berne are in general extremely de∣lightful,
and no road exhibits a more pleasing variety
of hill and dale than that which leads to Thun. It runs
through an agreeable country; winds through fertile mea∣dows,
enriched with dark forests of pine and fir, and oc∣casional
groves of beech and oak. The cattle lately de∣scended
from the Alps, were browzing on the pastures, and
added to the animation of the scenery. The well-being
of the inhabitants is visible from the cultivation of the
grounds, and the number and neatness of the cottages and
farm-houses which are scattered about the fields, skirted by
trees, or half concealed amid tufts of wood.</P>
<P>THUN is distant about twelve miles from Berne: it oc∣cupies
the bottom and the brow of a hill, and stands on both
sides of the Aar. It contains twelve hundred souls, enjoys
considerable immunities, has its own magistrates and courts
of justice, in which the bailif from Berne always presides,
and from whose decision an appeal lies to the capital. The
inhabitants employ themselves in carding and spinning silk
for the manufactures of Basle. Some of the burghers possess
large herds of cattle. To the north-east stands, on an emi∣nence,
the church and the castle, which is the residence of
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>
the bailif, and occupies the highest point. From its windows
I enjoyed a most pleasing and extensive view, not inferior in
its kind to any prospect in Switzerland. Underneath is
the town, occupying both sides of the Aar, standing in a
rich plain of pasture, and bounded by a chain of hills, black
with forests of fir, which extend from Berne and join the
Niess, a brown and rugged mountain, that rises rapidly from
the edge of the lake. To the east, a small ridge covered
with vines and trees; and to the south-east, part of the lake
of Thun, bounded by hills rising to the mountains and alps
of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, “<HI>piled up to the clouds.</HI>”
The Aar flows from the lake between two level promon∣tories,
prettily sprinkled with trees, on one of which stands
the castle of Schadan. The lower parts of this view, con∣trasted
with the rugged rocks and mountains, resemble a
painting of Claude by the side of a Salvator Rosa.</P>
<P>FROM Thun I returned about six miles to the village of
Massic, where I quitted the high road and passed through
pleasant thickets of beech and oaks, over fields and enclo∣sures;
the cottages and hamlets agreeably situated in lawns,
and amid clumps of trees. In about an hour and a half I en∣tered
the road which leads from Berne to Langenau, and
ascended to the upper part of the village of Worbe, where I
passed a most agreeable day with an amiable family, who
favoured me with a most cordial and polite reception. The
view from their house, which stands in the midst of a
field, is not inferior to that from the castle of Thun: it com∣mands
a rich enclosed and well-wooded country, gently
broken into hill and dale, and watered by many lively
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>
streams; the huge white peaks of the Jungfrauhorn, Schreck∣horn,
and Wetterhorn, overtopping a hill embrowned with
sirs.</P>
<P>I MADE also an excursion to Hindelbank, a village about
four miles from Berne, in order to examine the tomb of
Madame Langhans, a most celebrated work of Nahl, a Saxon
sculptor. Being employed in constructing a sepulchre for
Count d'Erlach, he was lodged in the house of the clergy∣man,
his particular friend, whose wife, a woman of uncom∣mon
beauty, expired in childbed on Easter-eve. Struck with
the time of her death, animated by the recollection of her
beauty, and sympathising with the affliction of her husband,
he conceived and finished this affecting monument. It is
placed in the body of the church, sunk into the pavement like
a grave, and covered with two folding doors. When these
are opened a grave-stone appears as if just rent into three
fractures, through which is half discovered the figure of a
woman slightly veiled with a shroud. She is represented at
the moment of the resurrection, when “<HI>the graves are com∣manded
to yield up their dead.</HI>” With her right hand she is
gently raising that portion of the broken grave-stone which
lies over her head; and in the other holds a naked infant
struggling with its little hands to release itself from the
tomb. “<HI>Here am I, Lord, and the child whom thou gavest
me</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hier Herr bin ich; und das kind, so du mir gegeben hast.—An engraving of this monument is published by M. de Mechel of Basle.</NOTE>,”
are the sublime words which form the inscription.
Below is the name of the deceased, “Anna Magdalena Lang∣hans,
wife of the clergyman. Born 1723; died 1751.” The
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
workmanship is by no means inferior to the original design.
The artist has formed the whole sepulchre out of one block,
and so naturally expressed the swelling of the stone, that the
fragments seem as if they had just burst, and were in the act
of opening. The only circumstance to be regretted is, that
the materials are not so durable as such a monument de∣serves;
being of sand-stone, they are too soft to resist the ef∣fects
of time, and even now exhibit some symptoms of decay.
Nothing perhaps can more strongly display the superior ef∣fects
of simplicity over magnificence, than the comparison of
this tomb with the mausoleum of Count d'Erlach in the same
church. The latter consisting of several marble figures, exe∣cuted
in a masterly stile, and loaded with all the emblems of
rank and opulence, scarcely attracts a momentary attention;
while this simple grave-stone “<HI>speaks home</HI>” to the heart of
every person of taste and feeling.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VISIT TO MICHAEL SCHUPPACH, THE PHYSICIAN
OF LANGENAU.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Langenau, <DATE>Sept. 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have heard, perhaps, of Michael Schuppach, the
famous Swiss doctor; of whose sagacity in discovering
the seat of disorders, and applying suitable remedies to them,
many wonderful stories are recounted by travellers; and
which, like Virgil's Progress of Fame, have increased in the
marvellous in proportion as they receded from the scene of
action. I am now lodged in the house of this celebrated
Aesculapius, situated above the village of Langenau, on the
side of a steep acclivity; from which circumstance he is ge∣nerally
styled <HI>the physician of the mountain.</HI></P>
<P>UPON our arrival we found the doctor in his apartment,
surrounded by several peasants, who were consulting him
upon their respective complaints; each having brought with
him a small phial, containing some of his water: for, by
inspecting the urine, this medical sage pretends to judge of
the state of the patient. His figure is extremely corpulent;
he has a penetrating eye; and a good-humoured counte∣nance.
He seats himself opposite to the person who consults
him, one moment looks at the water, the next at the patient;
and continues examining alternately the one and the other
for some time, occasionally whistling during the intervals.
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
He then opens the state of the case, acquaints the consultant
with the nature of his complaints, and has sometimes the
good fortune to hit upon the true cause. In a word, his
knack of discovering disorders by urine, has gained such im∣plicit
faith in his skill, that we might as well question the
Pope's infallibility before a zealous catholic, as the doctor's in
the presence of his patients. He has certainly performed
several great cures; and the rumour of them hath brought
persons from all quarters of Europe, who come hither for his
advice.</P>
<P>MICHAEL SCHUPPACH was formerly a village surgeon, has
a slight knowledge of anatomy, and is tolerably versed in
botany and chemistry. His acquaintance with the theory of
physic is said to be inconsiderable: the greatest part of his
knowledge being derived from his extensive practice, not∣withstanding
he never stirs a quarter of a mile from his own
house; for he would not take the trouble of going to Berne,
even to attend the king of France. It is more than probable,
that much of this extraordinary man's success, is owing to
the great faith of his patients; to the benefit they receive
from change of climate; to the salubrious air of this place;
and to the amusement arising from the constant succession of
different company. But whatever may have been the causes
of his celebrity, it has come to him, as all accounts agree,
unsought for by himself. He has certainly many excellent
qualities; is humane and charitable to the highest degree,
he not only furnishes the indigent patients with medicines
graits, but generally makes them a present in money besides,
and always appropriates a certain portion of his gains to the
<PB N="83" REF="92"/>
poor of his parish. His wife and grand-daughters are dressed
like the peasant women of the country; and he has shewn
his good sense in giving his grand-children a plain educa∣tion:
the eldest he bestowed in marriage, when she was but
fifteen, upon one of his assistants, and with her £. 1, 300; no
inconsiderable portion for this country. He procured a
match for her so early, he said, to prevent her being spoiled
by the young gentlemen telling her that she was pretty,
and inspiring her with the ambition of marrying above
her rank.</P>
<P>IF domestic harmony, and the most perfect simplicity of
manners, have any pretensions to please, you would be
highly delighted with this rural family. The wife is a no∣table
active woman, superintends the household affairs with
remarkable cleverness; assists her husband likewise in pre∣paring
his medicines; and, as he talks no other language
than the German, serves occasionally as his interpreter. As
a proof of his confidence in her administration of his affairs,
she acts as his treasurer, and receives all his fees; which, in
the course of a year, amount to a considerable sum: for, al∣though
he never demands more than the price of his medi∣cines,
yet no persons of property consult him without giving
an additional gratuity. She has likewise received many
presents from those who have reaped benefit by her hus∣band's
prescriptions: several of these presents consist of va∣luable
trinkets, with which on days of ceremony she decks
herself to the best advantage, in the simple dress of the
country.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="93"/>
THE family sit down to table regularly at twelve o'clock:
there are always some strangers of the party, consisting not
only of those persons who are under the doctor's care, but of
travellers, like ourselves, who are led by motives of mere
curiosity. When the weather is fine, and their guests more
numerous than usual, dinner is served in an open shed, that
overlooks the adjacent country, with a distant view of the
glaciers beyond the lake of Thun. Yesterday some peasants,
whom the doctor had invited, formed part of our company;
after dinner, he gave some money to those that sate near
him, and ordered one of his grand-daughters to distribute his
bounty to the others. The benevolence of the old man, his
gaiety and good-humour, the cheerfulness of his family, the
gratitude of the poor peasants, the beauty of the prospect,
and the fineness of the weather, formed all together a most
agreeable and delightful scene; and I do not remember to
have ever partaken of any meal with a more sensible and
heart-felt satisfaction.</P>
<P>THIS singular man is very often employed in giving ad∣vice
from eight in the morning till six in the evening, with
no other intermission than during the time he is at table.
His drugs are of the best kind; for he collects the simples,
and distills them himself. His house, like those of the pea∣sants,
is constructed of wood; and though always full of
people, is remarkably neat and clean. In short, every thing
about him bears the appearance of the pleasing simplicity of
former ages. I had almost forgotten to tell you, that I con∣sulted
him this morning; and have reason to be highly sa∣tisfied
with his prescription: for, he told me I was in such
<PB N="85" REF="94"/>
good health, that the only advice he had to give me, was
“to eat and drink well, to dance, be merry, and take mode∣rate
exercise.”</P>
<P>IT is now Langenau fair; and the village is crowded
with the neighbouring peasants. Great numbers of the
men have long beards, and many of them cover their heads
with a woman's straw hat, extremely broad, which makes a
very grotesque appearance: their dress is chiefly a coarse
brown cloth jacket without sleeves; with large puffed
breeches of ticking. The women, who are remarkably
handsome, wear their hair plaited behind in tresses, with the
ribband hanging down below the waist; a flat plain straw
hat, which is very becoming; a red or brown cloth jacket
without sleeves; a black or blue petticoat bordered with red,
and scarcely reaching below the knees; red stockings with
black clocks, and no heels to their shoes; their shifts of ex∣tremely
fine linen, fastened close round the throat by a black
collar with red ornaments: the better sort have chains of
silver between the shoulders, brought round under each arm,
and fastened beneath the bosom, the ends hanging down
with some silver ornaments. I am so charmed with the
situation of this village, the cheerfulness and singularity of
this rustic and agreeable family, and the uncommon cha∣racter
of the humane doctor, that I could with pleasure con∣tinue
here some days longer; but I am pressed for time, and
have a long journey before me.</P>

<P>THIS celebrated empiric died in March 1781; and Lan∣genau,
which I again visited in August 1786, was no longer
the resort of the sick, the valetudinarian, the curious, and
the idle. The doctor had gained by his practice £. 10, 000;
of which sum his wife received a third, and the remainder
was distributed among his son-in-law and grand-children.
Langenau is situated at the commencement of the Emme∣thal,
a valley remarkable for its cultivation and beauty.
Many of the farmers are extremely rich: the people appear
in general contented and happy; the wooden cottages scat∣tered
about the fields, are uncommonly neat and comfortable,
and announce, in their general appearance, the well-being
of the peasantry.</P>

<P>I TOOK leave of my friends at Langenau, in order to pro∣ceed
to Avignon; where I am going to pay a visit to the
<HI>Abbé de Sade,</HI> author of the interesting memoirs of the life of
Petrarch. Monsieur de Vigur, a senator of Soleure, offered
me a place in his carriage to Berne: and, as my principal
object in travelling is to acquire intelligence, I very gladly
embraced this opportunity of leading my worthy and well-informed
companion into a conversation, not only concern∣ing
the government of Soleure in particular, but in relation
also to Switzerland in general; and I found him exceedingly
well-disposed to answer the several questions he allowed me
to propose to him. The next day I repassed through Morat
and Avenches, and slept at Payerne, a town in the canton of
Berne, which enjoys considerable privileges. Upon the
bridge over the Broye, is an antient Roman inscription: as I
was endeavouring to decypher it, a plain-looking man ac∣costed
me in a very solemn tone of voice, and said, he had
often tried to make out the inscription, but without success;
though he could read very well, and had a smattering in
Latin. “For,” added he, “what can be the meaning of N
and I and O, and all those great letters, which seem to have
no connection with each other? Give me a page of plain
Latin, and I will translate it from the beginning to the end;
<PB N="88" REF="97"/>
but for these Ns, Is and Os; take my word for it, notwith∣standing
all your pains, you will never be the wiser.” How∣ever,
as I did not seem disposed to follow his advice, but
continued decyphering the inscription (which was by no
means a difficult talk) he appeared astonished at my obsti∣nacy,
and left me, with an apparent air of pity, to my hope∣less
fortune.</P>
<P>MOUDON is an handsome town, the principal burgh of a
bailliage of the same name, and formerly the capital of all
that part of the Pays de Vaud, which belonged to the duke
of Savoy. It was also the ordinary residence of his chief
bailif, and the place where the assembly of the states were
accustomed to meet. The bailif appointed by the sovereign
council of Berne, resides in the castle of Lucens, built upon
the summit of a mountain, in a situation exceedingly pictu∣resque.
This castle formerly belonged to the bishops of
Lausanne, and was one of their favourite seats, before the
reformation was introduced into this country.</P>
<P>GENEVA lies upon the narrowest part of the lake, where
the Rhone issues in two large and rapid streams, which soon
afterwards unite. That river separates the city into two un∣equal
divisions, receives the muddy Arve in its course, and
flows through France into the Mediterranean. The adjacent
country is uncommonly picturesque, and abounds in magni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icent
views: the several objects which compose this en∣chanting
prospect, are, the town; the lake; the numerous
hills and mountains, particularly the Saleve and the Mole,
rising suddenly from the plain in a variety of fantastic forms,
<PB REF="98"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="89" REF="99"/>
backed by the glaciers of Savoy, with their frozen tops glist∣ening
in the sun; and the majestic Mont Blanc rearing its
head far above the rest.</P>
<P>GENEVA, which lies partly in the plain upon the borders
of the lake, and partly upon a gentle ascent, is irregularly
built; the houses are high, and many, which stand in the
trading part of the city, have arcades of wood, which are
raised even to the upper stories. These arcades, supported
by pillars, give a gloomy appearance to the street; but are
useful to the inhabitants in protecting them from the sun
and rain. Geneva is by far the most populous town in
Switzerland; and contains 24, 000 souls. This superiority of
numbers is undoubtedly owing to the great industry and ac∣tivity
of the inhabitants; to its more extensive commerce;
to the facility of purchasing the burghership; and to the pri∣vileges
which government allows to all foreigners. The
members of this city are distinguished into citizens and
burghesses, inhabitants and natives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the late revolution in 1782, there is a fifth class, called <HI>domiciliés,</HI> who receive from the magistrates an annual permission to remain in the city.</NOTE>. The citizens and
burghesses are alone admitted to a share in the government:
the inhabitants are strangers who are allowed to settle in the
town with certain privileges; and the natives are the sons of
those inhabitants, who possess additional advantages. The
two last classes form a large majority of the people. The
liberal policy of this government, in receiving strangers and
conferring the burghership, is the more remarkable as it is
contrary to the spirit and usage of the Swiss. It is here, in∣deed,
<PB N="90" REF="100"/>
more necessary; the territory of this state being so ex∣ceedingly
small, that its very existence depends upon the
number and industry of the people: for, exclusive of the
city, there are scarcely 16,000 souls in the whole district of
the Genevois.</P>
<P>THE reformed doctrines first preached at Geneva in 1533,
by William Farel, a native of Gap in Dauphiné, and Peter
Viret of Orbe, owed their final reception and establishment
to John Calvin. That celebrated reformer was born at
Noyon, in 1509, and being driven from France by the perse∣cutions
which Francis the First had raised against the protes∣tants,
made his first appearance in this city in 1536. Not∣withstanding
Zuingle, Oecolampadius, and Haller, had re∣formed
the greatest part of Switzerland, some years before
that period; yet Calvin, as Voltaire justly observes, has given
his name to the sectaries of the reformed religion, in the
same manner as the new continent took its appellation from
Americus Vespusius, although the original discovery was
made by Columbus. And although Calvin was not the first
reformer of Geneva; yet, as he gave additional strength and
solidity to the new establishment, and founded the ecclesiasti∣cal
form of government, he totally eclipsed the fame of his
friend William Farel, who first scattered seeds which Calvin
brought to maturity. In truth, so great was the ascendency
which Calvin, although a foreigner, acquired over the citi∣zens,
that he possessed considerable influence even in civil
matters; and bore a large share in settling the political con∣stitution.
Conscious that religion derives support from every
branch of knowledge, he liberally promoted the cultivation
<PB N="91" REF="101"/>
of science, and the study of elegant literature. To this end,
as well as to encourage theological erudition, he prevailed
upon government to establish a public academy: but with
singular disinterestedness declining the proposal of being ap∣pointed
perpetual president, he obtained that office for his
friend and fellow-labourer, Theodore Beza. In this new
seminary, Calvin, with Theodore Beza, and his other col∣leagues,
eminent for their superior knowledge, read lectures,
with such uncommon reputation and success, as attracted
students from all quarters.</P>
<P>THERE is such a striking splendour in the brighter parts
of this disinterested and celebrated reformer's character, as to
render us, at first glance, almost insensible to those dark spots
which in some instances have obscured its glory. Yet when
we reflect on his asperity and arrogance; and, above all, on
the cruel persecution of Servetus; we cannot but lament that
he did not rise superior to the intolerant principles of the
age, which in all other instances he helped to enlighten.
With regard to his intolerant principles, it must be acknow∣ledged,
that the same uncharitable spirit prevailed also among
many of the most celebrated reformers; who unaccountably
conceived, in opposition, not only to the genius, but to the
clearest precepts of the gospel, that persecution for consci∣ence
sake, although unchristian in every other ecclesiastical
establishment, was justifiable in their own. This absurd
and dangerous opinion, gave great advantage to their ad∣versaries
of the papal hierarchy; for, it is obvious to the
meanest understanding, that, if persecution is justifiable in
any particular church, it must be so universally.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="102"/>
THE republic of Geneva is, however, at present, the most
tolerating of all the reformed states in Switzerland; being
the only government in this country, which permits the
public exercise of the Lutheran religion. In this respect
the clergy, no less wisely, than suitably to the spirit as well
as the letter of the Christian revelation, have renounced the
principles of their great patriarch, Calvin: although they
still hold that able reformer in high veneration; yet they
know how to distinguish his virtues from his defects, and to
admire the one without being blindly partial to the other.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 63.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ON THE LITERATURE OF GENEVA.</HEAD>
<P>TO a man of letters Geneva is particularly interest∣ing:
learning is divested of pedantry, and philosophy
united with a knowledge of the world; the pleasures of so∣ciety
are mixed with the pursuits of literature, and elegance
and urbanity give a zest to the profoundest disquisitions.
Nor are letters confined in this city merely to those who en∣gage
in them as a profession, or to those whose fortune and
leisure enable them to follow where genius leads. Even the
lower class of people are exceedingly well informed; and
there is perhaps no city in Europe, where learning is more
universally diffused. I received great satisfaction in convers∣ing
even with several tradesmen upon topics both of litera∣ture
and politics; and was astonished to find, in this class of
men, so uncommon a share of knowledge. But the wonder
ceases, when we are told, that all of them were educated at
the public academy, where the children of the citizens are
taught, under the inspection of the magistrates, and at the
expence of government.</P>
<P>ONE circumstance in this seminary particularly contri∣butes
to excite the industry and emulation of the students:
prizes are annually distributed to those who have distin∣guished
themselves in each class. These rewards, consist∣ing
of small medals, are conferred with such solemnity, as
cannot fail of producing great effect. A yearly meeting of
<PB N="94" REF="104"/>
all the magistrates, professors, and principal inhabitants, is
held at the cathedral, when the first syndic himself distri∣butes,
in the most public manner, the honorary retributions.
I met this morning one of the scholars, and, seeing his me∣dal,
inquired its meaning? “<HI>Je la porte,</HI>” replied the boy,
scarcely eight years old, “<HI>parce que j'ai fait mon devoir.</HI>” I
required no stronger proof to convince me of the beneficial
influence upon young minds, from these encouraging and
judicious distinctions, than appeared from this sprightly spe∣cimen.
The citizens enjoy the advantage also of having
free access to the public library; and by this privilege, they
not only retain but improve that general tincture of learning
which they imbibe in their early youth.</P>
<P>THE public library owes its origin to Bonnivard, prior of
St. Victor, who was twice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page. 408, Vol. 1.</NOTE> imprisoned for having asserted,
against the dukes of Savoy, the independence of Geneva;
and who considered the hardships he had suffered, and the
perils he had escaped, as ties that indeared him more strongly
to a city, which he had adopted as his own. He was a prin∣cipal
promoter of the reformation by gentle means and gra∣dual
instruction. He closed his benefactions to his beloved
city by the gift of his valuable manuscripts and books, and
by bequeathing his fortune towards the establishment and
support of the seminary. His works, which chiefly relate to
the history of Geneva, are preserved with that care and re∣verence,
which are due to so eminent a benefactor. The
library contains 25, 000 volumes and many curious manu∣scripts,
of which an accurate and learned catalogue has been
<PB N="95" REF="105"/>
lately published by the Rev. Mr. Sennebier the librarian.
He has attempted to discriminate the ages of the several ma∣nuscripts;
he describes their form and size, the materials on
which they are written, the ornaments, the characteristic
phrases, and mentions the proofs on which he grounds his
opinions. He adds also the notes, and distinguishes those
which have never been printed. M. Sennebier has also fa∣voured
the world with “<HI>Histoire Literaire de Geneve,</HI>” ac∣companied
with biographical anecdotes of those natives who
have been celebrated for their learning. I should trespass too
much upon your time, were I to attempt sending you an ac∣count
of the principal men of letters in Geneva, I shall there∣fore
confine myself to those only, with whom I am person∣ally
acquainted.</P>
<P>CHARLES BONNET was born in 1720. His life has been
devoted to the pursuits of literature, and to the improvement
of philosophy and science. He has proved by his publica∣tions,
that his indefatigable industry in searching into the
phaenomena of the creation, is equalled only by his inge∣nuity
in explaining them. His works, printed at Neuchatel,
form nine volumes in quarto, or eighteen in octavo, and
contain divers subjects of natural history, many accurate ob∣servations
on insects, on the vegetation of plants, on the use
of leaves in plants, considerations on organized bodies, and
the contemplations of nature. By several treatises, and par∣ticularly
his Analytical Essay on the Faculties of the Soul, he
has shewn himself an acute metaphysician. Like his friend
Haller, he has also stood forth an able advocate for the great
<PB N="96" REF="106"/>
principles of natural and revealed religion. His<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A translation of his <HI>Recherches Philosophiques sur les Preuves du Christianisme,</HI> has been lately given to the public, by John Lewis Boissier, Esq. under the title of “Philoso∣phical and Critical Inquiries concerning Christianity.”</NOTE> Philoso∣phical
Researches on Christianity, and his treatise on the Ex∣istence
of God, prove, that an intimate knowledge of nature
necessarily tends to establish a rational belief of those great
truths. I had frequent opportunities of conversing with this
respectable philosopher: though now in the sixty-sixth year
of his age, he possesses an uncommon degree of vivacity and
animation, still retains his enthusiasm for the pursuits of
science, and speaks with the same perspicuity and elegance
as are observable in his writings.</P>
<P>I WAS no less ambitious of being known to his nephew
M. de Saussure. Born in 1740; he was elected professor of
philosophy in 1762; and has given to the public the follow∣ing
specimens of his indefatigable industry, and of the versa∣tility
of his talents: various remarks and experiments on
microscopic animals; observations on electricity; on basaltic
lavas and volcanic productions; on the physical geography
of Italy. He has invented an instrument for measuring
the degrees of magnetic force; and so much improved the
electrometer of Cavallo, that it may be almost considered as a
new instrument. But above all, his invention of the hair-hygrometer,
or an instrument for measuring the moisture of
the atmosphere, has enabled him to make many theoretical
and experimental researches that are detailed in his <HI>Essai sur
l'Hygrometre.</HI> And although a controversy is now subsisting
<PB N="97" REF="107"/>
between him and M. de Luc, concerning the propriety
of hair as an instrument for this purpose; yet it cannot de∣preciate
this invention; and new lights must be thrown on
that subject by the opposition of two such able naturalists.
His <HI>Voyages dans les Alpes,</HI> of which two volumes in quarto
have already made their appearance, treat of the physical
geography of the alps, the formation of mountains, the ori∣gin
of the glaciers, and various phaenomena of nature,
which peculiarly distinguish Switzerland. Unlike some phi∣losophers
of the present age, who from their cabinet, and
with no other knowledge of the earth than what is acquired
by books, peremptorily and presumptuously decide on the
theory of the globe, this indefatigable observer draws from
repeated travels, and incessant experience, a fund of facts,
which may enable him to complete the great design and ob∣ject
of all his researches, that of establishing a more perfect
theory of the earth.</P>
<P>THE cabinet of M. de Saussure is an object worthy of the
traveller's curiosity. It contains a collection of foreign and
Swiss butterflies; various petrifactions and fossils, more par∣ticularly
a large variety of basalts and volcanic productions;
numerous specimens of granites and other primitive stones;
which he has collected during his various expeditions, and
from parts which have been only visited by himself. M. de
Saussure has lately resigned the professorship of experimental
philosophy, and is succeeded by my very worthy and ingeni∣ous
friend Mr. Pictet Turretini, who has already distin∣guished
himself by various publications, which elucidate se∣veral
important branches of experimental philosophy.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="108"/>
PAUL Henry Mallet, born at Geneva in 1730, passed the
earlier part of his life at Copenhagen as preceptor to the
present king, Christian the Sixth. His introduction to the
history of Denmark, under the title of Northern Antiquities,
proves him a profound and accurate antiquarian; and his
histories of Hesse, Brunswic, and Denmark, shew him no
less eminent as an historian. I should on this occasion be
unmindful of the honour conferred on me, if I omitted
to mention, that his latest work is a translation of my Travels
into Poland, Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, to which he
has added many remarks, and a Journey into Norway.</P>
<P>M. DE LUC, reader to the queen of Great Britain, and
resident in England, is also a native of Geneva. He was born
in 1727, and published, in 1772, his celebrated work on the
modification of the atmosphere, and on the theory of baro∣meters
and thermometers: a performance which marks a
distinguished aera in the history of experimental philosophy,
and which we are happy to find he is still carrying on under
the title of <HI>Idées sur la Metéorologie.</HI> But in his <HI>Lettres Phy∣siques
et Morales sur l'Histoire, de la Terre et de l'Homme,</HI> M.
de Luc appears to singular advantage. In this extraordinary
performance, he has displayed a most extensive knowledge
of nature, and has applied it with great sagacity in forming
a new theory of the earth, and in a happy accommodation
of his hypothesis to the Mosaic account of the creation. The
cabinet of M. de Luc is not only remarkable for the number
and rarity of many specimens; but more particularly claims
the attention of the naturalist, as a systematic collection,
tending to illustrate his theory of the globe. With this view
<PB N="99" REF="109"/>
it may be divided into three principal parts. The first part
contains petrifactions and fossils; the second, the collection
of stones; and the third, lavas and volcanic productions. The
first part is arranged in such a manner, under three distinct
heads, as may enable the naturalist, 1. to compare the pe∣trifactions
of animals and vegetables with the same bodies,
which are still known to exist in our parts of the globe;
2. to compare those petrifactions of animals and vegetables
with the same bodies which are known to exist in distant
countries; 3. to consider the petrifactions of those bodies
which are no longer known to exist. The second part com∣prehends
the stones under three points of view; 1. those of
the primitive mountains, which contain no animal bodies;
2. those of the secondary mountains, which contain only
marine bodies; 3. those which contain terrestrial bodies. In
the third part, the lavas and other volcanic productions are
distinguished into, 1. those from volcanos now in a burning
state; 2. those from extinct volcanos.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 64.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOVERNMENT OF GENEVA IN 1776.</HEAD>
<P>THE city of Geneva and its territory were formerly
united to the German empire, under the successors
of Charlemagne: but as the power of the emperors, feeble
even in Germany, was still weaker in the frontier provinces,
the bishops of Geneva, like several other great vassals of the
empire, gradually acquired very considerable authority over
the city and its domains; which the emperor had no other
means of counterbalancing, than by increasing the liberties
of the people. During these times of confusion, constant dis∣putes
subsisted between the bishops and the counts of the
Genevois, although the counts at their first institution were
merely officers of the emperor, and considered as vassals of
the bishops, yet they claimed and asserted a right to the ex∣clusive
administration of justice. The citizens took ad∣vantage
of these quarrels, and, by siding occasionally with
each party, obtained an extension of their privileges from
both.</P>
<P>BUT the House of Savoy having purchased the Genevois,
and succeeded to all the prerogatives of the counts, with ad∣ditional
power; the bishops and the people firmly united, in
order to oppose encroachments, which were no less prejudi∣cial
to the authority of the one, than to the liberties of the
others. During this period, the respective pretensions of the
<PB N="101" REF="111"/>
counts, bishops, and citizens, were so various, as to form a
government equally singular and complicated. The har∣mony,
however, between the bishops and citizens, was at
length broken by the artful management of the counts of
Savoy, who had the address to procure the episcopal see for
their brothers, and even for their illegitimate children. By
these methods, their power in the city became so enlarged,
that, towards the commencement of the sixteenth century,
Charles the Third, duke of Savoy, (although the form of
government was entirely republican) obtained an almost
absolute authority over the citizens, and exercised it in the
most unjust and arbitrary manner. Hence arose perpetual
struggles between the duke and the citizens; the latter con∣tinually
opposing, either by open violence, or secret mea∣sures,
his tyrannical usurpation: thus two parties were
formed; the zealots for liberty were called <HI>eidgenossen,</HI> or
confederates; while the partisans of the duke were branded
with the appellation of <HI>mammelucs,</HI> or slaves.</P>
<P>THE treaty of alliance, which the town contracted with
Berne and Friburgh, in 1526, may be considered as the true
aera of its liberty and independence: for, not long after, the
duke was deprived of his authority; the bishop driven from
the city; a republican form of government established, and
the reformation introduced. From this time, Charles and
his successors waged incessant war against the town: but his
hostilities were rendered ineffectual, by the intrepid bravery
of the citizens, and the assistance of Berne. In 1584
Geneva concluded a treaty of perpetual alliance with Zuric
and Berne, by which it is allied with the Swiss cantons.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="112"/>
THE last attempt of the House of Savoy against Geneva,
was in 1602; when Charles Emanuel treacherously attacked
the town during a profound peace. Two hundred soldiers
scaled the walls in the night, while the inhabitants were re∣posed
in unsuspecting security; but being timely discovered,
were repulsed by the desperate valour of a few citizens, who
gloriously sacrificed their lives in defence of the liberties
of their country. As a tribute of public gratitude for their
glorious resistance, these brave Genevans were buried with
great pomp, and their names are recorded on a sepulchral
stone. In memory of this event, some of the scaling ladders,
by which the enemy entered the town, are preserved in
the arsenal; and also the petard, which was fastened to one
of the gates, when the gunner was killed before it could be
discharged. The war occasioned by this perfidy was con∣cluded
in the following year by a solemn treaty: since that
period, uninterrupted peace has been maintained between
the House of Savoy and Geneva; although the king of
Sardinia did not formerly acknowledge, till 1754, the inde∣pendence
of the republic.</P>
<P>No sooner was peace concluded with the House of Savoy,
than the flames of internal discord, so apt to kindle in po∣pular
governments, and which had been smothered by their
common danger from a foreign enemy, began to appear.
During the greatest part of the last century, to the present
period, the history of Geneva contains little more than a
narrative of contentions between the aristocratical and the
popular parties. These mutual struggles have been occa∣sionally
exerted with so much violence and animosity, as
<PB N="103" REF="113"/>
to threaten, for a moment, a total revolution in the state; but,
happily, they have been hitherto compromised without pro∣ducing
any fatal effects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will recollect that this letter was written in 1776, before the late Revo∣lution of 1782, which is related in the subsequent letter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of the present century, the power
of the Great Council was become almost absolute. In order
to restrain its authority, the popular party, in 1707, procured
an edict, that every five years a general council of the ci∣tizens
and burghers should be summoned, to deliberate
upon the affairs of the republic. Agreeably to this law, a
general assembly was convened in 1712; and the very first
act exerted by the people in this their collective capacity,
was the abolition of that edict. An event of so singular a
nature, can hardly be accounted for upon the general prin∣ciple
of popular fickleness and inconsistency: accordingly
Rousseau, in his <HI>Lettres ecrites de la Montagne,</HI> imputes it
to the artifices of the magistrates; and to the equivocal terms
marked upon the billets then in use. For, the question pro∣posed
to the people being, “Whether the opinion of the
councils, for abolishing the periodical general assemblies,
should pass into a law?” the words employed on the billets
delivered for that purpose, were, <HI>approbation, rejection;</HI> so
that whichever side was taken, it came to the same point.
If the billet of <HI>approbation</HI> was chosen, the opinion of the
councils which rejected the periodical assembly, was ap∣proved;
if that of <HI>rejection,</HI> then the periodical assembly was
abolished of course. Accordingly, several of the citizens
<PB N="104" REF="114"/>
complained that they had been deceived, as they never meant
to reject the general assembly, but only the opinion of the
councils<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Miscellaneous Works of Rousseau, Vol. iv. p. 279.</NOTE>. In consequence of this extraordinary repeal, the
power of the aristocracy continued increasing till within
these few years; when the citizens, by a singular conjunc∣tion
of favourable circumstances, joined to an uncommon
spirit of union and perseverance, have procured several
changes in the constitution of Geneva; by which the au∣thority
of the magistrates has been limited, and the rights
of the people enlarged. Happy! if they know where to
stop; lest, continuing to extend the bounds of their own pri∣vileges,
they shake the foundations of civil government, by
too much restraining the power of the magistrates.</P>
<P>THE present constitution of Geneva, may be considered
as a mean between that of the aristocratical and popular
cantons: more democratical than any of the former, in∣asmuch
as the sovereign and legislative authority entirely
resides in the general assembly of the citizens; and more
aristocratical than the latter, because the powers vested in
the Great and Little Councils are very considerable.</P>
<P>THE members of the Senate, or Little Council of twenty-five,
enjoy, in their corporate capacity, several preroga∣tives
almost as great as those which are possessed by that of
the most aristocratical states. They nominate half the
members of the Great Council, supply the principal magi∣strates
from their own body, convoke the Great Council and
<PB N="105" REF="115"/>
the General Council, and previously deliberate upon every
question which is to be brought before these councils: in
other words, in them is lodged the power of proposing;
consequently, as every act must originate from them, no law
can pass without their approbation. In this senate is vested
also the chief executive power, the administration of the
finances; and, to a certain degree, jurisdiction in civil and
criminal causes. They nominate, likewise, to most of the
smaller posts of government; and enjoy the sole privilege of
conferring the burghership. They compose, moreover, in
conjunction with thirty-five members of their own choosing,
the Secret Council, which never assembles but by their con∣voking,
and only upon extraordinary occasions.</P>
<P>THESE considerable prerogatives, however, are counter∣balanced
as well by the privileges of the Great Council, as
by the franchises of the General Council. The privileges of
the Great Council consist in choosing the members of the
Senate from their own body; in receiving appeals in all
causes above a certain value; in pardoning criminals; in dis∣posing
of the most important charges of government, those
excepted which are conferred by the General Council; and
in approving or rejecting whatever is proposed by the Senate
to be laid before the people.</P>
<P>THE General Council, or assembly of the people, is com∣posed
of the citizens and burghers of the town: their number,
in general, amounts to about 1, 500, but seldom more than 1, 200
meet at the same time; the remainder being either settled in
foreign countries, or usually absent. I ought to have ex∣plained
<PB N="106" REF="116"/>
to you sooner, the distinction between <HI>citizens</HI>
and <HI>burghers:</HI> the latter, are either the sons of citizens of
burghers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The children of those who are employed in foreign countries, in the service of the state, although born out of Geneva, are entitled to all the privileges of citizens.</NOTE>, born out of Geneva, or have obtained the burgh∣ership
by purchase; the former, are the sons of citizens or
burghers, born within the town of Geneva. The burghers
may be chosen into the council of two hundred, but the
citizens alone can enter into the Senate, and possess the
charges appropriated to that body.</P>
<P>THE General Council meets twice a year, chooses the
principal magistrates, assents to, or rejects, the laws and
regulations proposed by the councils, imposes taxes, con∣tracts
alliances, declares war or peace, and nominates half
of the members in the Great Council. All questions are
decided by the majority of voices; and each member de∣livers
his vote without having the liberty of debating. The
restriction is certainly reasonable; for, in a popular assembly,
like this of Geneva, composed of citizens, the meanest of
whom is well versed in the constitution of the common∣wealth,
and where the people in general have a strong pro∣pensity
to enter into political discussions; if every voter was
permitted to support and enforce his opinion by argument,
there would be no end of debate, and the whole time would
be consumed in petulant declamation.</P>
<P>BUT the principal check to the power of the Senate, arises
from the right of <HI>re-election,</HI> or the power of annually ex∣pelling
<PB N="107" REF="117"/>
four members from the Senate at the nomination of
the syndics, and from the privilege of <HI>representation.</HI> The
right of re-election may be exercised in the following man∣ner:
the four syndics, or chiefs of the republic, are chosen
annually out of the Senate by the General Council; and
there must be an interval of three years before the same
members can be again appointed. The usual mode of elec∣tion
is as follows:—The Senate nominates from its own
body eight candidates, who must be approved by the Great
Council; and out of these eight, the members of the General
Council choose the four syndics. They have it in their
power, not only to reject these eight candidates, but all the
other senators successively: and in that case, four mem∣bers
of the Senate retire into the Great Council, and an equal
number of the last-mentioned body occupy the places of
the degraded senators.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the second restraint I mentioned upon
the power of the Senate, the right of <HI>representation;</HI> every
citizen or burgher has the privilege of applying to the Se∣nate
in order to procure a new regulation, or of remonstrat∣ing
against any act of the magistracy. These representa∣tions
have, perhaps, proved one of the principal means of
securing the liberties of the people from the respective en∣croachments
of the two councils; as they have frequently
prevented the magistrates from stretching their authority to
the same extent as has been practised in some other com∣monwealths
of Switzerland. The magistrates are obliged to
give an explicit answer to these representations; for, when
the first is not considered as satisfactory, a second remon∣strance
is presented. According to the nature and impor∣tance
<PB N="108" REF="118"/>
of the complaint, the representation is made by a
greater or less number of citizens; and it has sometimes
happened, that each remonstrance has been accompanied by
several hundred, in different bodies.</P>
<P>THE salaries of the magistrates are so inconsiderable, as not
to offer any temptation on the side of pecuniary emolument:
a sense of honour, a spirit of ambition, the desire of serving
their country, together with that personal credit which is
derived from exercising any office in the administration, are
the principal motives which actuate the candidates to solicit
a share in the magistracy. Accordingly, the public posts are
generally filled with men of the first abilities, and of the
most respectable characters. The revenues of government,
at the highest calculation, scarcely amount to 30, 000 pounds
a year; a sum, however, which, by a well-regulated oeco∣nomy,
is more than sufficient to defray the current ex∣pences:
so that this republic is enabled to provide for the se∣curity
of its subjects, from an income which some individuals,
in other countries, squander in pomp and dissipation.</P>
<P>IT is very remarkable that, in a republic so free as this of
Geneva, and where the true principles of liberty are so well
and so generally understood, there should be no precise code
of penal laws: for although the form of the prosecution is
settled, yet the trial of the criminal is private, and the pu∣nishment
left to the decision of the magistrate. Nor are
the franchises of the people ascertained with that accuracy
which might be expected. Indeed, under Ademar Fabri,
bishop of Geneva in the fourteenth century, a certain num∣ber
<PB N="109" REF="119"/>
of political regulations, both civil and criminal, together
with several particular customs and franchises, were drawn
up in form; and the bishop took an oath to observe them.
These statutes, if they may be so called, were also confirmed
by Amadeus the eighth, duke of Savoy. This code, to
which the people appeal in all cases of controversy, is com∣piled
in a very inaccurate and confused manner, and the ma∣gistrates
refuse to submit to its authority, because it was
published before the independence of the republic was con∣firmed.
The people have repeatedly demanded a precise
code of municipal and penal laws, so express and determi∣nate,
as to prevent the arbitrary decision of the magi∣strate;
and although such a code was ordered to be com∣piled
in 1738 and 1768, yet its compilation has been hi∣therto
deferred.</P>
<P>THE code of civil law is the most perfect part of the con∣stitution;
all matters concerning commerce being well regu∣lated,
and private property securely guarded. It is unneces∣sary
to trouble you with a particular detail of the sumptuary
laws, which are much the same as those in most of the other
states of Switzerland, where restrictions of that kind are en∣forced.
But there is one law, relating to bankrupts, too sin∣gularly
severe not to be mentioned. If a member of either
council becomes a bankrupt, he is immediately degraded;
and from that moment is rendered incapable of holding any
post under government, until he shall have discharged all
the just demands of his creditors: even his children are
subjected to the same disgrace; and no citizen can exercise
any public employment, while the debts of his father re∣main
unpaid.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="120"/>
IN this city, as in all the other principal towns of Swit∣zerland,
a public granary is established. Magazines of this
kind, useful in all states, are more particularly necessary in so
populous a place as Geneva, which, if the neighbouring
powers were to prohibit the importation of corn, might be
exposed to the horrors of famine. This corn is dried by
means of machines well contrived for that purpose, and re∣tailed
to the inn-keepers and bakers: a considerable profit
accrues to government; and there is always, in case of
necessity, a sufficient quantity in reserve to support the inha∣bitants
during a year and an half.</P>
<P>GENEVA is strongly fortified on the side of Savoy, and a
garrison constantly maintained: but these fortifications, and
this garrison, are only sufficient to guard them from any
sudden attack; but could not be defended long against a re∣gular
siege. The great security of the republic consists in
its alliance with the Swiss cantons, by means of Zuric and
Berne: and, as it is the interest both of the kings of France
and Sardinia to be in friendship with the Swiss, and to pre∣serve
the independence of Geneva; it derives its greatest se∣curity
from a circumstance which, in some cases, would be
the source of danger; namely, that its territory borders upon
the dominions of such powerful neighbours. Geneva is the
only republic in Switzerland, which has no regular compa∣nies
in any foreign service; wisely prohibiting the enlisting
of mercenaries in every part of its territory.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ACCOUNT OF THE LATE REVOLUTION AT GE∣NEVA
—ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE IN∣TESTINE
TROUBLES—SIEGE AND SURRENDER
OF THE TOWN—CHANGES IN THE FORM OF
GOVERNMENT—EMIGRATION—PROJECT FOR
A GENEVAN SETTLEMENT IN IRELAND—RE∣LINQUISHED.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the preceding letter sketched the general
history of Geneva, and described the form of govern∣ment
existing in 1776; I shall now give an account of the
late troubles, and relate the changes of the constitution in
1782. In this narrative, instead of entering into the alterca∣tions
of party, I shall endeavour to develop the principal causes
which excited the people to take arms, to imprison several of
the magistrates, and, at length, to surrender the town, at the
moment when they seemed most determined to defend it to
the last extremity.</P>
<P>BY the edict of 1768, tranquillity was, apparently, re∣stored
to Geneva, and several alterations were introduced into
the antient constitution. By these changes, the intestine
troubles were only smothered, but not extinguished. The
<HI>Negatives,</HI> or aristocratical party, discontented at the right of
re-election extorted from them in 1768, which they consi∣dered
as a species of ostracism, were ready to seize the first
<PB N="112" REF="122"/>
opportunity of obtaining its abolition; while the <HI>Represen∣tants,</HI>
or partizans of the people, were inclined to push their
advantages to the utmost, and to secure their victory by a
precipitate exercise of this new privilege.</P>
<P>THE project for the compilation of a new code of laws,
which although ordered by the edict of 1738 and 1768, had
been hitherto delayed under various pretences, was another
cause of misunderstanding between the two parties, and was
the immediate occasion of the succeeding troubles. Many
reasons induced the Negatives to oppose its compilation.
First; An accurate statement of the customs and usages
would considerably diminish their prerogatives, by abridg∣ing
the great discretionary powers, which the want of a pre∣cise
code must necessarily entrust to the will of the magi∣strates.
—Secondly; As, in order to furnish materials for such
a work, it became absolutely necessary to search into the an∣tient
archieves; it was surmised, that many titles would be
exposed to the public eye, which would favour the preten∣sions
of the House of Savoy; and that others would be
brought forward by the democratical party, in order to
justify farther encroachments. The Representants, however,
continued to demand the compilation of a new code; and at
length, in January 1777, forced the Negatives to consent to
their demand, by excluding, according to their right of <HI>re∣election,</HI>
four members from the Senate or Little Council.
In consequence of this measure, a committee, for the pur∣pose
of forming a code of laws, was appointed by the con∣currence
of the Little, Great, and General Councils. This
committee was to exist two years; and the code was to be
<PB N="113" REF="123"/>
laid before the three Councils, for their joint approbation
or rejection.</P>
<P>AT length, on the first of September 1779, the committee
submitted a sketch of the first part of this code to the Little
and Great Councils, in order to profit by their observations,
before it was presented to the General Council. Many arti∣cles,
however, being considered by the Negatives as too de∣mocratical,
met with great opposition: the Senate proposed
to the Great Council, that the committee should be prorogued
for the purpose of amending the code; but the Negatives,
who formed the majority, decided, that the code should not
be accepted, and that the committee should be dissolved.</P>
<P>THIS measure was violently reprobated by one party as
unconstitutional, and supported as warmly by the other.
By the former it was argued, that the Great Council ex∣ceeded
its powers; because the Little Council having laid
before the Great Council the question, “Whether the
powers of the committee should be prolonged?” the Great
Council, instead of deciding that point, and <HI>that</HI> only; had
determined, “that the code itself should not be accepted.”—
The popular party considered this mode of proceeding as an
evident breach of the constitution: for it was argued, that
the Senate alone has the power of proposing, and the Great
Council the privilege of approving or rejecting the motion,
and not that of amending or altering it. Further, it was
urged, that as the committee had been appointed conjointly
by the three Councils, and the code was to be submitted to
<PB N="114" REF="124"/>
their approbation or rejection; the Great Council did not
possess the right of cancelling the code, although they had
that of dissolving the committee.</P>
<P>To these objections the Negatives answered, that the
Great Council did not dissolve the committee; because,
being appointed only for two years, it ceased of course at
the expiration of that term; and that as to the necessity of
submitting the approbation or rejection of the code proposed
by the committee to the three Councils, it might be urged,
that the Little and Great Councils had the sole prerogative
of framing a new code, and of laying it before the General
Council; that they had acted inconsistently in permitting
that Council to have any share in appointing the committee;
and, therefore, that they now only used their prerogative in
resuming those powers which they had unwarily granted to
others. Many persons, however, were of opinion, that al∣though
the Little and Great Councils possessed the un∣doubted
right of proposing to the General Council; yet, as
they had once admitted that Council to a share in appoint∣ing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strictly speaking, the names of the commissioners were not laid before the Ge∣neral Council; but simply the proposal of appointing a committee. The commission∣ers were privately settled by the two par∣ties; and the burghers acceded to the propo∣sition in general terms, as they previously knew, that the commissioners were mostly favourable to the popular party.</NOTE>
the committee, they were imprudent in rejecting the
code by their own authority; and ought, at the expiration
of two years, to have nominated, conjointly with the burgh∣ers,
a new committee, for the purposes of compiling a code
of laws, according to the edicts of 1738 and 1768.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="125"/>
IN consequence of these disputes, the body of citizens re∣monstrating
against this act of the Great Council, that assem∣bly
offered to undertake the compilation of the code; and to
submit it to the public examination. The opposite party
considering this offer as insidious, many debates took place,
and various negotiations were carried on between the two par∣ties,
which only served to widen rather than heal the dissen∣sions.
At length the <HI>Negatives,</HI> considering the public tran∣quillity
as endangered, appealed to their guarantees, France,
Zuric, and Berne, and entreated them to protect the laws and
constitution. But this appeal had no other effect than to heigh∣ten
the distrust and suspicion of both parties. In this crisis of
affairs, the <HI>Negatives</HI> redoubled their efforts to strengthen
themselves by the accession of the natives, and to spread the
seeds of jealousy between the natives and the citizens.</P>
<P>THE natives, sons of the inhabitants, who had purchased
the right of settling at Geneva, formed a numerous body, dis∣contented
and jealous of many exclusive privileges enjoyed by
the citizens, and inflamed with resentment against them, for
having, in 1770, banished eight of the principal natives, who,
asserting, that the rights of the burghership belonged to the
natives as well as to the citizens, demanded, that instead of
being purchased, it should be gratuitously conferred. With
a view of acquiring so considerable an accession to their own
party, the Negatives courted the natives by caresses, sub∣sidies,
and entertainments, and issued a public declaration,
that they were ready to confer upon them those privileges of
trade and commerce, which had been hitherto exclusively
confined to the citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="126"/>
THE count of Vergennes openly favoured the design of
the Negatives, and even wrote dispatches to the resident of
France at Geneva in order to be communicated to the prin∣cipal
natives, who sided with the Negatives. These dis∣patches
contained the highest expressions of approbation,
and strongly recommended them to persevere in their at∣tachment
to that party. The attorney-general conceiving
this interference contrary to the established mode of pro∣ceeding,
which required, that all dispatches from a foreign
minister should pass through the hands of government, de∣livered
to the Great Council a spirited remonstrance, display∣ing
the danger which resulted from a private correspondence
between the court of France and the natives. He artfully,
indeed, surmized, that the report of the dispatch from the
French minister to the natives, was false and insidious, and
calculated to raise a misunderstanding between France and
the Republic; and even advanced several arguments, which
tended to prove the impossibility, that such an extraordinary
correspondence could have been maintained. The irony
and spirit of this remonstrance were so offensive to the count
of Vergennes, that he instantly obtained the deposition of
the attorney-general; and this public step in favour of the
Negatives considerably increased their party among the
natives.</P>
<P>IN order to counterbalance the offers of the Negatives
and the favour of France, the Representants manifested the
most generous intentions in behalf of the natives; and even
promised, what they had hitherto reprobated in the strongest
manner, to facilitate the acquisition of the burghership, and
<PB N="117" REF="127"/>
to bestow it as the recompence of industry and good beha∣viour.
Thus the two parties striving who should offer the
highest terms, two factions were formed among the natives;
and it was easy to foresee, that the first opportunity of recur∣ring
to force would be seized by the populace; many of
whom had nothing to lose, and much to gain in times of tu∣mult
and confusion.</P>
<P>IN effect, such an opportunity presented itself on the 5th of
February 1781; when a particular quarrel brought on a gene∣ral
rising. Two neighbouring and opposite parties of na∣tives,
casually disputing, loaded each other with virulent re∣proaches;
and from reproaches would have immediately
proceeded to an assault, if the Syndics on one side, and the
chiefs of the Representants on the other, had not quelled, by
their presence, the rising tumult. The populace assembled
on the occasion began to disperse; when a discharge of mus∣ketry
was heard from the arsenal. Several youths, who
sided with the Negatives, having taken possession of the ar∣senal
had fired<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is but justice to the Negatives to add, that, according to the opinion of some, this first insurrection was concerted, and the Representants fired first.</NOTE>, by mistake, on some natives of their own
party, killed one of them and wounded another. This dis∣charge
was considered by the Representants as the signal of a
general insurrection. They instantly took arms, and
marched, in three columns, to the arsenal; where, finding
only a few young men, who had rashly fired without orders,
they prudently restrained their resentment, and permitted
the others to retire without molestation. They then con∣tinued
<PB N="118" REF="128"/>
under arms, and occupied the principal avenues
of the city.</P>
<P>THE next morning the committee of the Representants
being summoned by the natives to fulfil their promises of
granting additional privileges, and particularly of gratui∣tously
conferring the burghership, held several meetings
with the principal Negatives on that subject, but without
success: for the Negatives, while they readily consented to
the request of the natives respecting the augmentation of
their commercial privileges, positively refused to facilitate
the acquisition of the burghership. Notwithstanding this
refusal, the committee, embarrassed and alarmed at the
number and threats of the natives, determined to abide by
their promises, drew up an edict, which permitted the na∣tives
to carry on trade, and to hold the rank of officers in the
military associations; and conferred the burghership on
more than a hundred persons, taken from the natives and
inhabitants, and even from the peasants of the territory.
This edict was laid before and approved by the three Coun∣cils;
the Negatives absenting themselves on this occasion
from their apprehensions of the popular party, who had
made themselves masters of the city. By this measure the
Representants esteemed themselves secure of having invio∣lably
attached the natives to their interest, and concluded,
that nothing more remained than to enjoy the fruits of their
victory. Affairs turned out otherwise; deputies being dis∣patched
from Zuric and Berne in order to mediate between
the rival parties, prevailed on the Representants to lay down
<PB N="119" REF="129"/>
their arms; and before their departure declared the edict in
favour of the natives to be null and illegal. And when the
question for executing that edict was laid before the Senate,
it was repeatedly carried in the negative, under the just pre∣tence,
that the mediating powers had declared it to be ille∣gal;
that while the city was in the power of the Represen∣tants,
who were under arms, none of the members could
venture to oppose it; and that therefore their assent, which
had been extorted by fear, was absolutely null.</P>
<P>INFLAMED by this refusal, the opposite party tendered,
on the 18th of March 1782, another representation, in
which they again summoned the magistrates to confirm
the edict. The answer, expected with the most extreme
impatience, was at length returned on Sunday the 17th
of April, and concluded with declaring, that “Govern∣ment
was neither willing nor able to ratify the edict.”
Although the committee endeavoured first to conceal, and
when that was impossible, to soften and palliate its con∣tents,
yet the generality of the natives, who found them∣selves
excluded from the favourite object of their wishes,
at the moment when they seemed most secure of obtaining
it, crouded tumultuously in different parts of the city; re∣peating,
one after the other, in a kind of frenzy, “Govern∣ment
is neither able nor willing to ratify the edict.” As these
cries of despair were accompanied by the most violent me∣naces;
the popular chiefs, after several vain attempts to re∣strain
the rising commotions, acquainted the magistrates
with the general indignation; and endeavoured, though
without success, to persuade them to recal or mollify their
<PB N="120" REF="130"/>
fatal answer. Mean while, night approached, ever favour∣able
to tumults and insurrections, and brought on the crisis
which ruined the Republic.</P>
<P>SOME of the lowest populace having set fire to a wooden
barrack, cried out, “to arms;” on which signal the natives
assembled in a tumultuous manner, and were joined by the
most violent Representants. The most moderate among the
citizens, well convinced, that the fire was only a pretext,
and that such an ill-timed insurrection would greatly preju∣dice
their cause, dispersed themselves in various quarters of
the town, and tried to prevail on the mob to retire; but
without effect. Many were wantonly insulted; and a party,
in attempting to secure one of the gates, having fired on the
garrison who resisted, it became absolutely necessary for the
citizens either to abandon the natives, or to join them in the
insurrection. Having hastily adopted the latter measure,
the officers of the popular party made their appearance,
took possession of the town, and appeased the tumult. At
length, after various unsuccessful negotiations to prevail on
the Negatives to ratify the edict, the popular party arrested
and confined a few of the magistrates and the principal Ne∣gatives;
and the chiefs of the Representants, apprehensive
that an immediate appeal to France would be the first con∣sequence
of their liberty, detained them in prison as hos∣tages
for their farther security.</P>
<P>As this arrest and imprisonment of the principal magi∣strates
appeared a measure as daring and atrocious as contra∣dictory
to sound policy; it may be proper to consider on
<PB N="121" REF="131"/>
what principles the Representants acted, and by what argu∣ments
they defended their conduct. For this purpose it
will be necessary to view the political situation of Geneva in
the moment of this insurrection, with respect to the neigh∣bouring
states, and particularly in relation to France, of
whose assistance the aristocratical party was secure, as soon
as that power could interfere with effect and propriety.</P>
<P>THE act by which France, Zuric, and Berne guarantied
the constitution of Geneva, as new-modelled in 1768, was no
longer in force; a circumstance highly unfavourable to the po∣pular
party. For, as by this act, the king of France could not
publicly interfere in the affairs of Geneva, except in concert
with Zuric and Berne, he had only one voice; and consequently
could not effectuate any change in the government, provided
those two cantons were united against him. These shackles
being highly displeasing both to the Court of Versailles, and to
the Negatives, who were protected by that court, the count of
Vergennes, by a letter written on the 28th of September 1781,
declared to the cantons of Zuric and Berne, that Louis the
Sixteenth renounced the guarantee, because they had refused
to enter into views for the purpose of restoring peace to
Geneva; and in a dispatch to the Senate, bearing the same
date, and to the same effect, he added, that the king, in re∣nouncing
the guarantee, did not withhold his protection from
the commonwealth; but still reserved to himself the power
of punishing the disturbers of public tranquillity, and of sup∣porting
the constitution. The greatest number of the Re∣presentants,
weakly rejoiced at this measure, from an idle
persuasion, that the minister, fatigued with their trifling dis∣putes,
<PB N="122" REF="132"/>
and despairing to overcome the perserverance of the
citizens, abandoned them to themselves; and, thus in the
very act which inevitably prepared subjection, imagined,
that they saw the first gleam of absolute independence.</P>
<P>SOON after this renunciation, M. de Vergennes ordered a
regiment to march into the land of Gex, which borders on
the territory of Geneva; and the troops were still quartered
on the frontiers, when the refusal of the Senate to confirm
the edict gave rise to the insurrection. In this situation, the
popular leaders argued, that for a long time a pretext had
been wanted to appeal to Versailles; and it was now found:
they dreaded every moment to see the French troops at the
gates of the town; they thought it therefore most advise∣able
to arrest and confine the magistrates, in order to intimi∣date
them from calling in the succours of France, and to
render them responsible for the public security. Won over
by these specious arguments, the body of citizens continued
to act as if their power was likely to be permanent. They
deposed several members of the Great and Little Councils,
and appointed in their place an equal number of persons
who were favourable to the cause of the Representants.
The Great Council thus new-modelled, executed the edict
for conferring the burghership on the stipulated number of
natives; and appointed a committee of safety, composed of
eleven members, with very considerable authority. This
committee entirely re-established public tranquillity, ordered
the fortifications of the town to be repaired, and inspired the
people with the most dangerous confidence in their own
strength.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="133"/>
ZURIC and Berne, on the first news of the insurrection,
interdicted their subjects from all intercourse with a govern∣ment
founded on usurpation and violence, and strenuously
advised the Syndics to exhort the citizens to an immediate
restoration of the legal constitution: a moment's delay, they
urged, would be inevitable ruin. A few days afterwards the
French minister returned unopened the dispatches of the
new Senate, and reminded the citizens of the king's solemn
engagement to support the oppressed, and to protect the
antient form of government. The citizens of Geneva,
though thus deserted by their allies, were deaf to all ad∣monitions,
idly appealed to the justice of their cause, and
disclaimed all overtures of accommodation except on their
own terms.</P>
<P>DURING two months the citizens and natives, apparently
secure within their ramparts, convinced either, that France
durst not venture to attack them, or that the prisoners would
be the immediate victims of such an attempt, and that they
should be able to make a long and glorious resistance, would
not even listen to any proposal of re-establishing the deposed
magistrates; and could not be prevailed upon to sacrifice a
part of their privileges, and particularly the right of re∣election,
for the security of the remainder. At length, the
storm gathering from all quarters, slowly approached, and
hovered over the town. The king of Sardinia and the canton
of Berne, both seconding the views of France, dispatched
troops against Geneva; and their respective generals, Messrs.
de la Marmora and Lentulus, were ordered to act in concert
with the French commander M. de Jaucourt, who had ad∣vanced
<PB N="124" REF="134"/>
to the frontiers at the head of a considerable detach∣ment.</P>
<P>NOTHING occasioned more surprise and indignation than
the junction of Sardinia and Berne with the King of France;
and yet no measure was more consonant to the views of those
two powers. The Sardinian monarch was interested in the
preservation of a town, which is the chief source of industry
and wealth to his subjects of Savoy; and whose intestine
troubles had already caused a diminution of his revenue: and
as he could not in common policy permit the French to in∣crease
their influence in these parts, and to quell, without
his interference, the commotions of Geneva, he <HI>voluntarily</HI>
tendered his assistance towards the accomplishment of so
beneficial a purpose.</P>
<P>THE Canton of Berne, desirous to prevent the interposition
of foreign powers in the affairs of Switzerland, used, in a
letter to the Syndics, the following exhortations. “Re∣double
your efforts with your fellow-citizens; and exert
yourselves in order to compose the unhappy differences,
which must infallibly terminate in the destruction of the
Republic. A speedy re-establishment of the legal govern∣ment
will restore to them their faithful allies, who are
anxious to employ their good offices in behalf of the state.”
But when these well-timed admonitions proved ineffectual,
and the perseverance of the citizens had drawn upon them
the resentment of France and Sardinia; Berne could not
tamely behold two such powers thus interfering in a crisis,
so important to her own particular welfare, and to the
<PB N="125" REF="135"/>
general interests of the Helvetic union; and, as Zuric had
prudently declined to take an active part against her antient
ally, stood forth with that firmness and decision which cha∣racterise
all her councils, and joined her forces to the con∣federate
armies of France and Sardinia.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this powerful combination, and
even in the midst of these threatening appearances, the
Genevans continued to repair the ramparts with indefati∣gable
ardour. The peasants of the territory flocked of their
own accord, and without pay, to mount guard, and to work
at the fortifications; women, of all ranks, crouded to the
ramparts, as to a place of public amusement; encouraging
and animating the men to persevere in their labour, and some
even sharing in their fatigue assisted in transporting burdens,
or in planting cannon on the bastions. In the midst of this
almost universal confidence, a few prudent persons, who
foresaw the impossibility of resistance, sighed in secret; but
were obliged to disguise their real sentiments, and could not
venture in public but with an air of hope, serenity, and
fortitude.</P>
<P>MEAN while the besiegers advancing on all sides, the
three commanders held frequent consultations, and formed
a general plan of attack. At length, on the 29th of June
1782, M. de Jaucourt dispatched a message to the Syndics;
in which, after expatiating on the disinterested intentions of
the king his master, and protesting that he respected the in∣dependence
of the Republic, and was only desirous of intro∣ducing
good order, he added, that if they would not admit
<PB N="126" REF="136"/>
his troops, and accept the following preliminaries of peace,
he must force his way into the town. Among other con∣ditions,
he exacted, that no person should appear in the
streets, under pain of military punishment; that a certain
number of citizens, among whom were all the chiefs of the
Representants, should in twenty-four hours retire from
Geneva; that all arms should be delivered to the three
generals; that the deposed magistrates should be instantly
re-established; and that a final answer should be returned
in two hours. The generals Lentulus and de la Marmora
respectively insisted on the same conditions.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to express the rage, indignation, and
despair, which these humiliating conditions excited at
Geneva. Without the least deliberation every person re∣solved
to perish rather than accept them; and the moment
of danger had no other effect than to animate and rouse the
courage of the besieged. While they hurried to the ram∣parts,
and were preparing for resistance, the Syndics secretly
obtained from the three generals a delay of twenty-four
hours. In this interval not only the men of all ages pre∣pared
for defence; but even women and children tore the
pavement from the streets, and carried the stones to the
tops of the houses, in order to roll them down upon the
enemy, in case they should force their way into the town.</P>
<P>SUCH was the general ardour; that about eighty women
and girls, dressed in uniforms, offered to form themselves
into a company, for the purpose of defending their country.
The committee of safety accepted their services, and placed
<PB N="127" REF="137"/>
them in a barrack, which by its situation was covered from
the cannon of the besiegers. These amazons, with a spirit
above their sex, refused a station that was not sufficiently
exposed; and, as the town soon afterwards surrendered, they
had no opportunity of proving their patriotism by a display
of their valour. All these various signs of the most deter∣mined
resolution, flowing unanimously from every rank,
age, and sex, alarmed the Negatives, who never had sus∣pected,
that the people would carry matters to such desperate
extremities. Accordingly, their partisans conferred with the
most moderate among the Representants, in order to find
some means of reconciliation; but without success.</P>
<P>AT length the fatal hour arrived, in which the answer
was to be returned: it was to expire at ten on Sunday morn∣ing;
and at the first beat of the drum the ramparts were
covered with defenders. Although the most zealous had
only calculated on 3000, above 5000 made their appearance.
They seemed to be all animated with one and the same
spirit; and reminded each other of those brave citizens of
Geneva, who by sacrificing their lives had repulsed, in 1602,
the troops of Savoy, when the latter had treacherously
sealed the walls during a profound peace. No one ventured
even to hint at surrendering; and all awaited the attack
with the most determined intrepidity. In this crisis, the
French general, at the intercession of the Negatives, alarmed
for the fate of the prisoners, again prolonged the period
prescribed for the capitulation. The first effect of these re∣peated
delays was gradually to abate the enthusiasm of the
women: they could not but feel that they were wives and
<PB N="128" REF="138"/>
mothers; and began to figure to themselves all the horrors
of a town taken by assault, and a prey to a licentious and
enraged soldiery. In the next place, timid and prudent per∣sons
could venture to conceal their fears under various pre∣tences;
and at length the committee of safety, hitherto
strenuous in enforcing the necessity of resistance, suddenly
changed their resolution, but artfully disguised their senti∣ments
from the public, until it was too late to prevent the
surrender.</P>
<P>IN the present ferment of passions and prejudices, had
the leaders openly proposed a surrender, they would have
been considered as traitors; endangered their own persons,
and accelerated those calamities which they wished to avoid.
For the purpose, therefore, of gradually bringing matters to
the issue which they intended, they assembled the citizens in
the respective circles; and after warmly extolling their ge∣neral
zeal and patriotism, represented, that if the city should
be attacked in the night, it would be no longer possible to
convene them. For this reason they hinted, that it would
be highly advantageous to the common cause, if each circle
should nominate several deputies, with full authority to
decide in their stead; adding, that they ought rather to ap∣point
those persons, who, from their age and respectable cha∣racter,
could assist their country by advice, while others
were defending it by their valour.</P>
<P>THIS council, composed of about a hundred citizens, met
at six in the evening, on the first of July, a few hours before
the last term appointed for the surrender was about to ex∣pire.
<PB N="129" REF="139"/>
The chiefs opened the debate with long speeches, in
order to prepare the minds of the assembly for the object
which they had in view. After having represented the state
of the fortifications, which were judged by the most intel∣ligent
engineers to be only sufficient for resisting an attack
by storm, and not for maintaining a siege of more than
three or four days; they ventured to lay before them the
necessity of an immediate surrender. On the bare mention
of that word, the most violent of the assembly burst into
reproaches, and accused the committee with an intention of
betraying the Republic. They declared, that they would
instantly announce to their fellow-citizens the treachery of
their deputies, who were not appointed to deliberate upon a
surrender, but only upon the means of the most effectual re∣sistance.
Apprehending the ill consequences of such a pro∣ceeding,
one of the chiefs started from his seat, and barred
the doors; while some of those who wished to retire, drew
their swords, and shedding tears of despair, “To remain a
moment,” they cried out “was to share the treason, and
to destroy their country.” Every method was attempted to
appease them: cries and exhortations were heard from all
quarters.</P>
<P>AT length, when the question concerning the surrender
was proposed, a considerable majority voted for defending
the city to the last extremity. On this determination, many
of the most zealous, trusting to this decided majority, retired
from the assembly, in order to prepare themselves for the
hour of danger. Another consultation was then proposed by
those who remained; the danger of dividing into parties,
and of alienating the citizens from their leaders, was re∣presented
<PB N="130" REF="140"/>
in the strongest colours. These suggestions being
attended with effect; long debates re-commenced. One of
the youngest in the assembly, being affected with the pathetic
consideration of the distress of those widows and orphans,
whose husbands and fathers should fall by the hand of the
enemy, was of opinion, that only those who were unmarried,
and who had no children, should be permitted to defend
the ramparts. “We are not sufficient,” he added, “to
preserve the town from being taken; but enough to save
our honour, and to obtain a less humiliating capitulation.”
He was interrupted by an elderly citizen, who claimed for
fathers of families the glory of fighting for their country.
“I have six sons,” exclaimed he, with tears of exultation
sparkling in his eyes, “and who shall prevent me from
marching at their head to the ramparts?”</P>
<P>IT was then proposed to conduct the hostages in the
face of the French batteries, as a means of intimidating M.
de Jaucourt from firing against the ramparts; for it was to
be presumed, that he would not expose to certain destruc∣tion
those magistrates whom he came to deliver. This
opinion, which for a short time seemed likely to prevail,
gave place to the more generous resolution of restoring
the prisoners to liberty, permitting the Negatives to retire
to the enemy's camp, and then preparing for a vigorous re∣sistance.
It was urged, that such a noble mode of proceed∣ing,
in so alarming a moment, would probably soften the
resentment of the aristocratical party, and induce them to
obtain from the French general more favourable terms of ac∣commodation.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="141"/>
MANY hours were consumed in discussing these various
opinions. The fatal period approached: it was midnight;
and the chiefs, who had now contrived to strike the greatest
number with a panic, won over the assembly to their senti∣ments,
by proposing a general emigration; and consoled
them, in the midst of their despair, with the hopes of enjoy∣ing
that liberty in another country, which they could no
longer expect to find in their own. A declaration being
then drawn up, to be delivered to the Syndics at the same
time with the keys of the city; the hostages were conducted
to their respective houses; the chiefs summoned the princi∣pal
officers from their posts, ordered the cannon of several
batteries to be rendered unfit for service, and provided for
their own safety by retiring from the town before the entry
of the confederate troops.</P>
<P>WHEN the unexpected news of the surrender was an∣nounced
to the public, they became frantic with despair.
Some mutually embraced each other without uttering a
single word; others loaded their chiefs with the most dread∣ful
imprecations; while a few, still determined to resist, in∣effectually
summoned their fellow-citizens by beat of drum
to their standards. The greatest part, however, having dis∣charged
and broken their muskets, flung themselves with
their faces to the ground, and lay motionless for a consider∣able
time. At length a general retreat took place. The
roads were covered with persons of both sexes, who fled
hastily from the walls; and the Sardinians, who first en∣tered
the gates at five in the morning, found the city
almost deserted.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="142"/>
THE count de la Marmora, as if actuated by motives of
compassion for the degraded situation of Geneva, marched
in silence, and without an insulting display of military
pomp; and, having occupied the town-house and the maga∣zines
for powder, visited in person the different quarters of
the city, in order to dissipate all apprehensions of danger.
About noon the two other commanders made their entry:
they were accompanied by a large body of Negatives, and
marched at the head of their respective troops, with drums
beating and colours flying. Having joined the Sardinian
forces, the three generals conducted the magistrates, lately
delivered from prison, to the Great Council, and re-esta∣blished
them in their several charges, to the found of martial
music. The citizens were disarmed; each householder
obliged to furnish the officers with quarters; the edict of the
6th of February 1781, which had conferred the burghership
on above a hundred natives, was annulled. In the midst of
these arrangements, the Great Council laid, with all due
form, the foundation of a theatre: a troop of comedians
was introduced; and the aristocratical party celebrated
their triumph with balls, feasts, and every species of pub∣lic
diversion.</P>
<P>MEAN while a committee appointed by the Great and
Little Councils prepared, in concert with the three generals,
an edict for new modelling the constitution, which being ap∣proved
at the courts of Versailles and Turin, and by the can∣ton
of Berne, was confirmed by the Great and Little Councils.
But as it annulled many considerable rights hitherto enjoyed
by the citizens, it was not probable, that it would be ratified
<PB N="133" REF="143"/>
by the General Council, in which the party of the Represent∣ants
had still a great majority. In order, therefore, to ob∣tain
its final confirmation, it was enacted, that, when the
edict was laid before the General Council, those Represent∣ants,
who had taken up arms, should for that time be ex∣cluded;
under pretence, that the insurrection had rendered
them unworthy of exercising their rights; and, that they
might esteem themselves extremely fortunate in not being
exposed to the utmost rigour of the laws. Accordingly, on
the 15th of November 1782, the members of the General
Council assembled to the number of five hundred; above a
thousand being excluded from giving their votes. And yet
even this fantom of supreme power was surrounded with
troops. Notwithstanding, however, the exclusion of so
many, and the general panic, above a hundred Represent∣ants,
and even several Negatives, had the courage to reject the
edict; which appeared to many, even among the Negatives,
as establishing too rigorous an aristocracy.</P>
<P>THE citizens of Geneva have incurred much ridicule and
censure, for having so early and repeatedly expressed the
most determined resolution never to surrender the town,
and to resist until it was taken by assault. In a pamphlet,
styled “<HI>Lettre êcrite des ramparts de Geneve,</HI>” the author
combats all the arguments which might be urged in favour of
a capitulation, and vehemently asserts, that he, as well as his
fellow-citizens, are resolved to defend the town to the last ex∣tremity,
and rather to court death from the hands of the
enemy than survive the extinction of their liberties. These
assertions appeared mere ostentatious vaunts, as the pam∣phlet
<PB N="134" REF="144"/>
was not printed and dispersed until after the surrender;
and led the public to attribute vain-boasting and cowardice,
which are usually united, as essential characteristics of the
people of Geneva.</P>
<P>ON reviewing the history of the revolution with impar∣tiality,
it cannot admit a doubt; that the people were una∣nimously
against a surrender; that, till within a few hours
before the confederate troops entered the gates, they ex∣pected,
and were prepared for, an assault; that they had en∣trusted
the command to the committee of safety; that the
committee, alarmed at the near approach of danger, had sud∣denly
changed their opinion, had betrayed them into a sur∣render
against their intentions, and without their knowledge,
and had taken such measures as rendered all resistance im∣practicable.
As the committee has been greatly censured
for this sudden change of opinion; it is but justice to add,
that of eleven members and several adjuncts, who composed
the committee, two-thirds voted against the surrender. But,
in fact, of what avail was resistance at this period? Upon a
supposition that the siege could have been protracted for a
few days; the kings of France and Sardinia, and the canton
of Berne, had fresh troops ready to march; and in less than
a week so large a reinforcement would have been collected
before the gates of Geneva, that any further opposition
must have been madness. In a word, the popular leaders
acted wrong in buoying up the hopes of people, that resist∣ance
could be effectual; and by the reparation of the ram∣parts
only served to inspire the public with a dangerous con∣fidence,
which they were not afterwards able to allay.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="145"/>
SUCH is the history of this extraordinary revolution;
prepared for some time by the enmity of the two parties;
occasioned by the impolitic though just demand of a code of
laws; hastened by the two insurrections: and completed by
the intrigues and arms of France. It must be acknowledged,
that the Representants, or popular party, acted in a most im∣prudent
as well as unconstitutional manner; and parti∣cularly,
that no excuse can be admitted for the second insur∣rection,
and the imprisonment of the magistrates. The Re∣presentants,
by the edict of 1768, possessed great privileges,
which in time would have placed in their hands the whole
administration of government. As the greatest number in
the General Assembly, they enjoyed the right of annually
excluding four members from the Senate, and of filling half
the vacancies in the Great Council; they must, therefore,
in a few years, have inevitably obtained a decided majority.
The most prudent among them saw this advantage, and
were contented; but the greater part, and perhaps a few of
their leaders, eager to grasp immediately that power, of
which they had only a distant prospect, precipitated mea∣sures;
and acting diametrically opposite to the first princi∣ples
of their constitution, hastened its destruction. It must,
at the same time, be confessed, that however imprudently or
unconstitutionally the Representants behaved, yet that the
Negatives, secure of support from the Court of Versailles,
seemed to carry their confidence in their own strength to
such a degree, as almost to court the troubles which ensued;
and that they have availed themselves of their victory to a
degree only to be palliated by absolute necessity. A new
form of government introduced by force, must be supported
<PB N="136" REF="146"/>
by force; by calling in the assistance of France, they must
be entirely submissive to that power; and by annihilating
the first principles of liberty, in disarming the citizens and
forbidding all public meetings, they are in danger of extin∣guishing
that spirit of emulation and energy for which the
Genevans have long been distinguished. Having established
a rigorous aristocracy, they must necessarily adopt that
jealousy and suspicion which not unfrequently characterises
the magistrates under that species of government: and the
only question now remaining, is, Whether the above-men∣tioned
spirit of emulation and energy will be diminished by
the change of constitution; and if so, whether that diminu∣tion
will be counterbalanced by the introduction of a greater
degree of tranquillity than is usually to be found in de∣mocratical
states?</P>
<Q>THE changes in the form of government, introduced by
this revolution, are principally comprized in the fol∣lowing
articles:</Q>
<P>1. THE power granted in 1768 to the General Council,
of re-election, or of annually excluding four members from
the Senate, is abolished. 2. The privilege enjoyed by the
same assembly, of nominating half the vacancies in the
Great Council, is likewise annulled; and that body is now
supplied by the Senate and Great Council, according to the
following complicated mode of election:—In case of sixteen
vacancies, the Great Council selects eight members from
sixteen candidates proposed by the Senate; and in like man∣ner
the Senate chuses eight from the same number of can∣didates
<PB N="137" REF="147"/>
appointed by the Great Council. 3. The right of
<HI>representation,</HI> or remonstrating, is taken from the citizens at
large, and transferred to thirty-six adjuncts, who may be
present in the Great Council, on the first Monday of each
month: they enjoy the privilege of making representations,
and in that case have a deliberative voice. But, as they are
removeable every year; and are drawn by lot from all the
citizens in general, who may chuse to present themselves as
candidates; they are considered as so extremely dependent
on the will of the magistrates, and their representations have
such little weight, that they are called in derision, <HI>Les Images,</HI>
or The Shadows. 4. The introduction of the <HI>grabeau,</HI> or
annual confirmation of the members of the Senate, and of the
Great Council, exclusively vested in the last-mentioned body.
This law, which may be considered as the basis of the
new constitution, has transferred to the Great Council part
of the authority both of the Senate and of the General
Council. By subjecting the Senate to this annual revision,
it has rendered that body greatly dependent on the Great
Council, which by the present constitution is become, what
the Senate was according to the form of government esta∣blished
in 1738 and 1768, the center of the aristocracy.
5. The circles, or clubs, in which the citizens used to be
convened, and all public assemblies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One instance of the ill effects arising from this prohibition, fell under my obser∣vation: The Society of Arts in Geneva, many of whose members are persons of great abilities and learning, has already given to the world several interesting publications. But as all public assem∣blies are prohibited, government was sus∣picious lest this literary society should in∣dulge itself in political questions; and ac∣cordingly no meeting has been held since the late revolution. Indeed, when I was at Geneva, it was then in agitation to suffer the so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iety to assemble; but it was very un∣certain whether this permission would be granted; and if granted, whether it would not be greatly fettered by the diminution of the number of its members, and by several other restrictions, incompatible with the freedom of literary disquisitions. It is a matter of little consequence to Europe in general, whether the government of Ge∣neva is more or less aristocratical or demo∣cratical: but it is an object of general im∣portance, whether a literary society should be prevented, by political jealousy, from holding those assemblies, which will afford a means and opportunity of continuing to supply the world with learned and interest∣ing publications.</NOTE>, are prohibited; and
<PB N="138" REF="148"/>
they are only allowed to meet at coffee-houses. This pro∣hibition
was at first carried to an extreme degree of jealousy,
highly derogatory from every principle of free government;
but lately it has been somewhat modified; and assemblies are
permitted to be held in the country, though not within the
walls of Geneva. 6. The militia is abolished; firing at
marks, even with bows and arrows, prohibited; and the
guard of the town, instead of being consigned to the citizens,
is entrusted to a garrison of 1000 foreign soldiers, whose co∣lonel
and major are both foreigners: these troops take an
oath of fidelity to the Republic, and of obedience to the Great
Council, and to the Committee of War: they are under the
immediate command and inspection of the latter, and subject
to the superior controul of the former. This garrison may
be augmented to 1200, and reduced to 800 men, at the will
of the Great Council; but cannot be further enlarged or di∣minished
without the consent of the General Council.
7. No citizen, native, or inhabitant, is permitted to have
arms. It is not unworthy of remark on this article, that
although by the antient constitution every citizen was
obliged to provide himself with arms, under a certain
penalty; yet, that when these were delivered up, govern∣ment
did not reimburse the expence. 8. Several taxes were
<PB N="139" REF="149"/>
imposed without the consent of the General Council; but
for the future, every change or augmentation of the revenue
must be submitted to that body. 9. Various privileges, re∣specting
the equal rights to trade and commerce, formerly
possessed by the citizens alone, have been conferred on the
natives and inhabitants; a liberal concession, to which both
parties willingly acceded.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="postscript">
<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Genevans seemed so greatly to deplore the dimi∣nution
of that liberty to which they had long been ac∣customed,
and to which they ascribed the late remarkable
increase of their population and riches, that if we had judged
from the discontents and consternation of the citizens, we
might have concluded the change of government would
have been followed by an almost general emigration. The
event, however, has not justified this conclusion. Ex∣cepting
the principal leaders, those of the popular party who
were banished, and a few others who renounced their
country in compliance with their political principles; the
greatest part of the emigrants returned, and again settled in
the place of their nativity. And perhaps it may be affirmed
with truth, that the late revolution has scarcely driven six
hundred persons from Geneva. The emigrants have
principally established themselves at Brussels and Con∣stance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 3.</NOTE>;
where they have introduced manufactures of
printed linens and watch-making.</P>
<P>I CANNOT quit this subject without recalling to your re∣collection,
the plan for giving an asylum to the Genevan
<PB N="140" REF="150"/>
emigrants in Ireland, which so long engaged the public
attention. Soon after the revolution, a memorial signed by
above a thousand Genevans of both sexes, who were either
persons of some property, or versed in trade or manu∣factures,
expressing a desire of settling in Ireland, was pre∣sented
to Earl Temple (now Marquis of Buckingham) then
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His Excellency, conscious of
the advantage which must result to Ireland from the recep∣tion
of so many industrious artists, many of whom possessed
property in the English, Irish, and French funds, communi∣cated,
on the 27th of September 1782, the proposal to the
Privy Council of Ireland for giving an asylum to the Gene∣van
emigrants. This proposal, patronized by the Lord
Lieutenant, and unanimously consented to by the Privy
Council, was approved by the King. The nobility and
gentry of Ireland seemed to vie with each other in coun∣tenancing
the settlement; the Irish parliament voted
£. 50, 000 towards defraying the expences of their journey,
and building a town for their reception; lands were pur∣chased
for £. 8000 in a convenient situation near Waterford;
part of the New Geneva was actually completed, at the ex∣pence
of £. 10, 000; a charter was granted with very con∣siderable
privileges; the standard of gold was altered for
the accommodation of the watch-manufacturers; the foun∣dation
of an academy approved, upon an useful, extensive,
and oeconomical plan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The total expence of the academy would, at the highest calculation, have amounted to £. 4554 per annum, and at a more moderate valuation to only £. 3924. For this sum forty-four professors, assistants, and masters would have been maintained; a public library established; and the expen∣ces of a student, in the article of education, would not have exceeded £. 164. 18 <HI>s.</HI> for thirteen years, or about £. 12 per annum.</NOTE>; in July 1783, several Genevans
<PB N="141" REF="151"/>
landed in Ireland; and when the nation had expended near
£. 30,000, the project was suddenly relinquished, and the set∣tlement
finally abandoned.</P>
<P>THE failure of this project may be principally attributed
to the following cause.—If the settlement could have been
immediately carried into execution, the Genevans would
have emigrated in very considerable numbers; but many
necessary delays were occasioned by the arrangement of so
complicated a plan, by the high demands of the Genevan
commissioners, who, in drawing up the charter, required
many privileges which were contradictory to the laws of the
land, and by the building of the New Geneva. These delays
naturally giving time for the resentment of the Genevans to
subside, many returned and took the oaths of allegiance to
the new government. To this circumstance must be added,
the departure of Earl Temple, in May 1783, who was the
great patron and promoter of the settlement; that the pro∣ject,
as it lost its novelty, gradually became less popular;
that the few Genevans, who had prematurely landed in
Ireland, although maintained at the public expence, yet
were discontented, at not finding the new town prepared for
their immediate reception; and that particularly, as those
among the proposed emigrants who had most property had
withdrawn their names; the remainder did not possess a
sufficient capital to settle in a foreign country, and to esta∣blish
an expensive branch of manufacture without still far∣ther
assistance. In consequence of this deficiency, the Gene∣van
commissioners petitioned to appropriate £. 10,000 of the
<PB N="142" REF="152"/>
£. 50, 000 for the purpose of forming a capital. But, as that
sum had been voted by parliament for other purposes, this
petitioin was necessarily rejected; and the Genevans, in an
address to the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
relinquished the settlement; and soon afterwards quitted
that country.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ACCOUNT OF THE LATE TUMULTS AND REVOLU∣TION
OF GENEVA IN 1789.</HEAD>
<P>THE late revolution of 1789 having greatly changed
the form of government established in 1782, and de∣scribed
in the former letter, I here submit to your perusal a
short account of the causes and termination of those tu∣mults,
which have been the means of restoring Geneva
to its former liberty.</P>
<P>THE edict of pacification passed in 1782 succeeded to a
long series of dissensions between the popular and aristocra∣tical
parties. France, Sardinia, and Berne, by whose do∣minions
Geneva is encircled, beholding, with regret and dis∣pleasure,
the flames of civil discord occasionally smothered,
but continually bursting forth on the slightest occasion, had
combined in order to settle a <HI>fixed</HI> and <HI>permanent</HI> constitu∣tion,
and took such precautions as seemed calculated to pre∣vent
in future any effectual opposition to the government
which they thought proper to establish. By the combined
forces of the three powers, the far greater part of the Gene∣vans
were compelled to submit to the most grievous con∣ditions:
the exile of their popular chiefs, the prohibition of
carrying arms, and a foreign garrison quartered in barracks,
at the entire disposal of government, formed the basis which
<PB N="144" REF="154"/>
supported the new constitution. From that period a calm
of a few years, almost unknown to the Republic, succeeded;
but it was a sullen and a lowering calm: the people were
kept in order by the precaution of a military force, not cal∣culated
for a small republic; the taxes imposed for the
maintenance of that military force, and for building bar∣racks,
were heavy, and their burden was felt the more, be∣cause
they constantly reminded the Genevans of their hu∣miliation
and subjection.</P>
<P>DURING my subsequent visits to Geneva, in 1785 and the
following year, I found an almost general discontent prevail∣ing
among all parties; many of the Negatives disaffected;
the Representants submitting in silent and sullen despair;
and the people without spirit and energy. The wisdom of
many of the regulations passed in 1782 was overlooked, or
forgotten: those only which annihilated the first principles
of liberty were remembered; and almost the only sentiment
which prevailed, was the sentiment of degradation, arising
from the subjection of a free people to a military govern∣ment.
In this state of affairs and general disaffection to the
ruling party, many of the citizens secretly entertained hopes
of another revolution; either founding their expectations
on the embarrassed situation of France, or on the favourable
disposition of the Great and Little Councils, the members of
which had for some time fatally experienced many difficul∣ties
in supporting the authority of government. The minds
of the greatest part were ready to take advantage of every in∣cident
likely to effect a change of the constitution.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="155"/>
SUCH a general spirit of disaffection had gone forth
among the people, that administration had been compelled
to employ a military force in order to quell a tumult, which
took its rise in the theatre on the 12th of December 1783.</P>
<P>THE quelling of this tumult was only a temporary
remedy; and the popular discontents broke out uncontrouled
on the 26th of January, on account of the publication of an
edict raising the price of bread a farthing in the pound.
This augmentation, though justified by the scarcity of flour,
and passed principally with a view to prevent the exportation
of bread, was yet imprudently laid on in the present temper
of the people. An insurrection instantly took place; the
bakers shops were pillaged, and on the following day a car∣riage
laden with bread, and escorted by soldiers, was plun∣dered
in its way to the distribution-office in the quarter of
St. Gervais. The soldiers, firing at the populace, killed one
man and wounded another: the numbers and fury of the
rioters increased; they drove away the troops, and carried
the body of the deceased, in a kind of funeral procession,
before the town-house, as a memorial of violence and op∣pression.
The populace, roused to frenzy at this spectacle,
attacked and occupied two gates of the city, and danger∣ously
wounded the commanding officer, as he was en∣deavouring
to restrain the ardour of his soldiers and the fury
of the people.</P>
<P>IN all tumults and insurrections the first moments are
precious. The magistrates, instead of acting decisively, had
lost them in deliberation; and the position of government
<PB N="146" REF="156"/>
became more and more embarrassing. On the present oc∣casion
it was necessary either to retake the gates, which had
been occupied by the insurgents, or to confess, that the mili∣tary
force, by which they had hitherto kept the people in
awe, was no longer capable of enforcing obedience. The
military committee, charged with the command of the gar∣rison
for the security of the city, fluctuated between their
duty to quell the insurrection, and their repugnance to shed
the blood of their fellow-citizens. In this dilemma they
hesitated for some time, and at length ordered two bodies of
troops to force their passage over the two bridges of the
Rhone which separate the quarter of St. Gervais from the
remainder of the city, and to retake the gate on the side of
Switzerland. They flattered themselves, that the people
would retire at the first appearance of a considerable body of
soldiers. But it was now too late: the insurgents had
already formed a strong barricade, behind which they
played off two fire-pumps, filled with boiling water and
soap-lees, against the extremities of each bridge; the cross
sire of several small arms, which poured from the windows
and tops of the adjacent houses, wounded several soldiers
and killed the commanding officer; the pavement of the
streets was torn up, and carried to the tops of the houses,
in order to be hurled down upon the troops, if they forced
the barricades and penetrated into the town. Meanwhile
the tumult spread itself into the other parts of the city,
and was in danger of becoming universal. In this state of
affairs the magistrates, finding that they could not quell the
insurrection without great effusion of blood, found them∣selves
under the necessity of complying with the demands of
<PB N="147" REF="157"/>
the insurgents. One of the principal magistrates repaired in
person to the quarter of St. Gervais, proclaimed an edict for
lowering the price of bread, granted a general amnesty, and
released all the insurgents that had been taken into custody.
These concessions restored indeed a momentary calm; but
produced the very effect they were intended to avoid.
The leaders of the disaffected party, now convinced, either
of the inability or unwillingness of government to employ a
sufficient degree of force, and foreseeing that the moderation
which had been just adopted must be continued, held them∣selves
in readiness to take advantage of any opportunity
which presented itself of exciting or encouraging another
insurrection, in order to effect a change of government, and
a recovery of former privileges. Such an opportunity pre∣sented
itself on the 29th of January, at the interment of a
woman who had been casually killed by the discharge of the
military in the tumult of the 26th. An immense concourse
of people attended the funeral: and the magistrates impru∣dently
ordered the garrison to be ranged and posted with
cannon, for the security of the barracks and the city gates
against any attempts of the multitude. The populace, be∣lieving
that the garrison was drawn out in order to re-com∣mence
hostilities, rose instantly, with one accord directed
their fury against the soldiers, drove them from their posts,
disarmed them, and took possession of the city gates with∣out
opposition.</P>
<P>THIS second tumult convinced the magistrates that all
farther opposition was fruitless. For, as the generality of
the citizens and burghers, instead of taking an active part in
<PB N="148" REF="158"/>
quelling the tumults, had rather seemed to countenance and
encourage them, it was evident, that the loss of their li∣berties,
and the humiliation to which they were reduced by
the edict of 1782, had absorbed every sentiment of affection
and reverence for an administration, which, however just
and reasonable in its measures and conduct, was founded on
the principles of despotism, and supported by force. Im∣pressed
with these considerations, and finding by experience
that a military government was both inexpedient and in∣effectual,
the chiefs of the aristocratical party suddenly
changed the system, by which they had been hitherto
guided, and renounced, by a very extraordinary revolution
in their sentiments, that line of conduct to which they had
before so obstinately adhered. They now felt, that in so
small a republic, and with such new objects of ambition, the
only permanent recompence of their political labours could
be drawn from the esteem, attachment, and confidence of
their fellow-citizens; they felt also, that, acting from that
principle, the wisest conduct to be adopted on the present oc∣casion
was, to change a constitution which had been proved
to be essentially defective; and which, while it abridged or
annihilated the dearest rights and privileges of a freeborn
subject, was ineffectual in maintaining itself by the usual com∣panion
of despotism, the terror of a military force. When,
therefore, the Solicitor-General, in the name of the citizens
and burghers, solicited the recovery of their antient liberties,
the permission of bearing arms, the re-establishment of the
militia, and of their circles or political clubs, the removal of
the garrison from the barracks, and the recall of the Repre∣sentants,
who were banished in 1782; such moderate
<PB N="149" REF="159"/>
demands were received with complacency and even satis∣faction.</P>
<P>THE two parties, fatigued with past dissensions, and
anxious to re-unite in the common cause, consented to sa∣crifice
something of their respective claims, and to use the
power reserved to them in 1782, by the guaranties, of
amending and changing the laws, by a majority of three-fourths.
The preliminaries were settled without difficulty;
a committee was appointed to revise and amend the edict of
1782; the new edict of pacification, under the title of <HI>Mo∣difications
à l'Edit de</HI> 1782, was approved by the Senate,
Great Council, and General Council. Such was the almost
general unanimity with which this business was transacted,
that in the assembly of the General Council which met on
the 10th of February, the <HI>modifications</HI> were carried by 1321
suffrages against 52. The publication of the new edict was
followed by the loudest acclamations and general rejoicings,
and confirmed by the three guaranties.</P>
<P>THE edict of 1782 is valid in all the articles which are
not repealed or amended by the present <HI>modifications;</HI> or, to
use the words of the present amendments, “The edict of
the 21st of November 1782, with the modifications intro∣duced
by the present edict, and the political code published
on the 13th of June 1783, shall be the fundamental law of
the state, and shall form the complete collection of its po∣litical
statutes.” The constitution is now wisely modelled
into a mean between the too popular form established in
1768, and the too aristocratical form established in 1782. The
<PB N="150" REF="160"/>
magistrates have consented to repeal the most obnoxious
articles in the edict of 1782; which may be principally re∣duced
to the following heads:</P>
<P>1. THE garrison is subject, as before the edict of 1782, to
the orders of the Senate, of the Syndic of the Guard, and of
the members of the Great Council; and is to be no longer
quartered in barracks. The garrison is to be gradually re∣duced
to 600 men; but to be increased to 720, at the will of
the Great Council. The officers are to be chosen by the
Great Council, from the citizens, burghers, and natives.
2. The militia to be re-embodied, and the military exercises
to be renewed. A regiment of volunteers to be formed from
the citizens, burghers, natives, and inhabitants, under the
orders of the Senate and Syndic of the Guard. 3. All
citizens, burghers, natives, inhabitants, and subjects, are
permitted to bear arms; all other persons dwelling in the
city are prohibited from carrying fire-arms without per∣mission.
4. The circles, or political clubs, are re-established;
but are forbidden to deliberate or vote on the affairs of state
or the operations of government. 5. Some additional powers
are granted to the thirty-six adjuncts, which increase their
importance, and consequently the weight of their repre∣sentations.
6. All persons banished by the edict of 1782
are to be recalled, if the consent of France, Berne, and
Zuric can be obtained; and those who were deprived of
their burghership, on account of refusing to take the oath
of allegiance to the government established in 1782, are to
be reinstated in their rights.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="161"/>
IN return for these concessions on the part of the magi∣strates,
the popular party consent to the articles in the edict
of 1782, which abolished the right of re-election, and trans∣ferred
the right of representation to the thirty-six adjuncts.
They have acted wisely in renouncing the right of re-election,
that species of ostracism, and source of so
much jealousy and suspicion, which principally occasioned
the troubles that preceded the revolution of 1782. They
have no less prudently consented to abolish the right of re∣presentation,
as it was vested, before the edict, in every
citizen and burgher. The use, or rather the abuse, of this
right, occasioned frequent tumults and seditions, by the
promiscuous assembling of a large number without order;
and it was found to be a dangerous expedient to employ a
multitude as an engine for political purposes.</P>
<P>BY the edict of 1782 it was stipulated, in favour of the
natives, that during the term of ten years, five natives, and
after the expiration of the said term, three natives, should
be annually chosen burghers. On the present occasion a
farther clause was added in their favour; that the burgher∣ship
should be conferred on all natives of the fourth gene∣ration,
when they shall have attained their proper age.</P>
<P>TIME can only discover whether the present form of
government will be more permanent than the former con∣stitution;
or whether a few years may not bring about
another revolution. It bears, however, strong marks and
characters of permanency, if we may augur from the pre∣sent
temper and disposition of the parties. The alterations
<PB N="152" REF="162"/>
are just, reasonable, and even necessary. It is the first time
that all the orders of the state freely, and as it were unani∣mously,
consented, and that scarcely the least disaffection or
murmurs have followed. The revolution of 1768 was the
triumph of the popular over the aristocratical party; and of
1782, the still greater triumph of the aristocratical over the
popular party. But the present change of the government
was accompanied and followed by the triumph of neither
party. It was formed by the coalition of both; it was the
general sense of the whole republic united, in order to repeal
what experience had shewn to be defective and inconsistent
with republican freedom in the edict of 1782; and to retain
what experience had shewn to be expedient and analogous
to the spirit and principles of the constitution.</P>
<P>THE pacification was instantly followed by marks of cor∣diality
and attention, between the individuals of two parties,
never before experienced. The sons of the principal Nega∣tives
have frequented the circles of the burghers; the ma∣gistrates,
who could not be reproached with any abuse of
their power since the edict of 1782, obtained the confidence
of the people from the moment that they renounced the
support of a foreign garrison quartered in barracks, and ex∣pressed
their resolution of entrusting the preservation of the
state, to the citizens, burghers, and natives.</P>
<P>NO monument of that military force, so odious and yet
so useless, will remain. The barracks of the town-house are
already evacuated, and will be converted into a public li∣brary;
the new barracks, built at an enormous expence, and
<PB N="153" REF="163"/>
more calculated for the garrison of a powerful and despotic
kingdom than for a small and free commonwealth, will form
a building for the university. The reformation of the
studies, which have scarcely received any alteration since the
time of Calvin, is now in agitation. In a word, all things
seem at present to conspire for the general good; and it is to
be hoped that both parties, shocked at the recollection of
past troubles, will continue on as friendly terms as the
jealous nature of a free constitution will admit, and not
exhibit any more civil dissensions of such notoriety as to en∣danger
the ruin of the republic; dissensions which have
been hitherto, perhaps, almost unavoidable, but which, if
renewed in future, will stamp indelible disgrace on the
Genevans, as a restless and discontented people.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 67.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GENERAL REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in the course of my former letters, commu∣nicated
to you such observations as occurred to me
during my tour through Switzerland, concerning the laws,
government, and situation of each canton in particular; I
will now lay before you a few concluding remarks, in rela∣tion
to the state of that country in general.</P>
<P>NO part of Europe contains, within the same compass, so
many independent commonwealths, and such a variety of
different governments, as are collected together in this re∣markable
and delightful country: yet, with such wisdom
was the Helvetic union composed, and so little have the
Swiss, of late years, been actuated with the spirit of con∣quest,
that since the firm and complete establishment of
their general confederacy, they have seldom found occasion
to employ their arms against a foreign enemy; and have
been troubled with no civil commotions that were not soon
happily terminated. Perhaps there is not a similar instance
in antient or modern history, of a warlike people, divided
into little independent republics, closely bordering upon
each other, and occasionally interfering in their respective
interests, having continued, during so long a period, in an
almost uninterrupted state of tranquillity. And thus, while
the several neighbouring kingdoms suffer, by turns, all the
<PB N="155" REF="165"/>
horrors of war, this favoured nation enjoys the felicity
of looking down with security upon the various tempests
that shake the world around them.</P>
<P>BUT the happiness of a long peace, has neither broken
the spirit, nor enervated the arm of the Swiss. The youth
are diligently trained to martial exercises, such as running,
wrestling, and shooting with the cross-bow and the musket;
a considerable number of well-disciplined troops are always
employed in foreign services; and the whole people are en∣rolled,
and regularly exercised in their respective militia.
By these means they are capable of collecting a very re∣spectable
body of forces, which would prove formidable to
any enemy who should invade their country, or attack their
liberties. Thus, while most of the other states upon the
continent are tending towards a military government, Swit∣zerland
alone has no standing armies; and yet, from the
nature of its situation, from its particular alliances, and
from the policy of its internal government, is more secure
from invasion than any other European power.</P>
<P>THE felicity of Switzerland, however, does not consist
merely in this peculiar exemption from the burdens and
miseries of war; as there is no country in which happiness
and content more universally prevail among the people.
For, whether the government is aristocratical, democratical,
or mixed; a general spirit of liberty pervades and actuates
the several constitutions: even the oligarchical states, which
are usually the most tyrannical, are here peculiarly mild;
<PB N="156" REF="166"/>
and the property of the subject is in general securely guarded
against every kind of violation.</P>
<P>BUT one general defect prevails in the criminal jurispru∣dence
of the country. For although the Caroline code, as it
is styled, or the code of the Emperor Charles the Fifth,
forms in each of the republics the principal basis of their
penal laws, with particular modifications and additions in
different districts; yet much too great a latitude is allowed to
the respective judges, who are less governed in their deter∣minations
by this code, or any other written law, than by
the common principles of equity. How far long experience
may have justified the prudence of trusting them with this
extraordinary privilege, or how far the severity of the
Caroline code renders it necessary, I canot say; but dis∣cretionary
powers of this kind, are undoubtedly liable to
the most alarming abuse, and can never, without the greatest
hazard, be committed to the hands of the magistrate.</P>
<P>UPON this occasion, I cannot forbear reflecting on the
superior wisdom of our most invaluable constitution; and,
indeed, it is impossible for an Englishman to observe the
governments of other countries, without becoming a warmer
and more affectionate admirer of his own. In England, the
life and liberty of the subject does not depend upon the
arbitrary decision of his judge, but is secured by express
laws, from which no magistrate can depart with impunity.
This guarded precision, it is true, may occasionally be
attended with some inconveniences; but they are overba∣lanced
<PB N="157" REF="167"/>
by advantages of so much greater weight, as to be
scarcely perceptible in the scales of justice. I do not mean
to throw any imputation upon the officers of criminal juris∣diction
in Switzerland: as far as I could observe, they admi∣nister
justice with an impartial and equitable hand.</P>
<P>I REMARKED, with peculiar satisfaction, the excellent
state of the prisons, and the humane precautions which the
several legislatures have adopted in relation to felons: a cir∣cumstance
that struck me the more forcibly, as the con∣trary
is but too visible in England. In Switzerland, the cri∣minals
are confined in wholesome and separate wards; and
instead of languishing in prison, to the great injury of their
health, or total waste of their little remnant of money, are
almost immediately brought to trial. In England, an accused
person may be confined six months, or more, before his fate is
determined: and if he is proved innocent, and should be in
low circumstances; the loss of his time, together with the
expences of the jail-fees, may probably occasion his utter
ruin; while his morals are in no less danger, by being com∣pelled
to associate with a set of abandoned wretches, lost to
all sense of shame, and encouraging each other in their
common profligacy. How much is it to be regretted, that,
while our code of criminal jurisprudence is in general
formed upon principles, which distinguish us with honour
among the nations of Europe; that our courts of justice are
thrown open to the view of all the world; and that we en∣joy
the inestimable and almost peculiar privilege of being
tried by our equals; how much (I cannot forbear repeating)
is it to be lamented, that the same equitable and humane
<PB N="158" REF="168"/>
spirit should be found wanting in so important an article of
our penal laws! For a more particular account of the prisons
in Switzerland, I would refer you to my friend Mr. Howard's
publication<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The State of the Prisons in England and Wales, &amp;c. &amp;c. Third edition, 1784. And an account of some foreign prisons.</NOTE> on the subject. In this work the benevolent
author has given many melancholy instances, that the En∣glish
jails are much inferior to foreign prisons in cleanliness
and good government. He must, however, feel the most
sensible satisfaction in finding, that his labours have already
produced several advantageous regulations, particularly con∣cerning
the fees of prisoners who shall be acquitted, and the
prevention of the jail distemper. And although much still
remains to be effected, yet it may justly be hoped, that the
attention of the British Senate will be effectually fixed upon
an object so highly deserving the care of every wise and
humane legislature.</P>
<P>IT is a matter of astonishment, as well as of concern, to
find, that in a country where the true principles of civil go∣vernment
are so well understood, and so generally adopted
as in Switzerland, that the trial by torture is not yet abo∣lished:
for, in some particular cases, the suspected crimi∣nal
is still put to the rack. The inefficacy, no less than
the inhumanity, of endeavouring to extort the truth by the
several horrid instruments which too ingenious cruelty has
devised for that purpose, has been so often exposed by the
ablest writers, that it would be equally impertinent and su∣perfluous
to trouble you with any farther reflections upon
the subject: and, indeed, the whole strength of the several
<PB N="159" REF="169"/>
arguments urged upon this occasion, is comprised in the
very just and pointed observation of the admirable la Bru∣yere,
that <HI>la question est une invention merveilleuse &amp; tout-à-fait
sûre, pour perdre un innocent qui a la complexion foible,
&amp; sauver un coupable qui est né robuste</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caracteres, Vol. ii. p. 203.</NOTE>. I cannot, however,
but add, in justice to the Swiss, that zealous advocates have
not been wanting among them for the total abolition of tor∣ture;
but arguments of reason, and sentiments of humanity,
have been found, even in this civilised and enlightened coun∣try,
to avail little against inveterate custom and long-con∣firmed
prejudices<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Criminal justice is here, as in the greatest part of Europe, administered agree∣ably to the rules of the civil law. Accord∣ing to the maxims of that code, the crimi∣nal's confession is absolutely requisite for the infliction of capital punishment; and con∣sequently, all those nations, which have not established a new code of criminal juris∣prudence, retain the use of torture.</P>
<P>The present king of Prussia set the ex∣ample, in Germany, of abolishing this in∣human practice; but few, perhaps, are ap∣prised, that the first hint of this reformation was suggested to him by reading the History of England. For, one of the principal ar∣guments in support of this method of ex∣torting confession, being, that it affords the best means of discovering plots against government; the sagacious monarch re∣marked, that the British annals fully con∣fute the fallacy of that reasoning. Few kingdoms, he observed, had abounded more in conspiracies and rebellions than England; and yet the leaders and abettors had been more successfully traced and discovered, without the use of torture, than in any coun∣try where it was practised. “<HI>From thence,</HI>” added this wise politician, “<HI>I saw the ab∣surdity of torture, and abolished it accord∣ingly.</HI>”</P>
<P>This anecdote, which I received from very respectable authority, bears the most honour∣able testimony to the efficacy as well as the mildness of our penal laws, and to the su∣perior excellency of the process observed in our courts of criminal justice.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING my subsequent expeditions into Switzerland in
1785 and 1786, I was extremely happy to find, that the absurd∣ity
as well as inhumanity of torture was more generally ad∣mitted.
It has long been suppressed in Geneva; in many of
<PB N="160" REF="170"/>
the aristocratical cantons it is virtually, though not formally,
abandoned; and, as I have before had occasion to observe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 56.</NOTE>,
its public abolition in Berne forms a distinguished aera in the
history of Swiss jurisprudence, and, it is to be hoped, is the
prelude to its total disuse throughout Switzerland.</P>
<P>LEARNING is less generally diffused among the catholic
than the protestant states: but in both a man of letters will
find abundant opportunities of gratifying his researches and
improving his knowledge. To the natural philosopher,
Switzerland will afford an inexhaustible source of entertain∣ment
and information, as well from the great variety of phy∣sical
curiosities so abundantly spread over the country, as
from the considerable number of persons eminently skilled
in that branch of science. Indeed in every town, and al∣most
in every village, the curious traveller will meet with
collections worthy of his attention.</P>
<P>WITH respect to agriculture; there are, perhaps, few
countries, wherein the advantageous effects of unwearied
and persevering industry are more remarkably conspicuous.
In passing over the mountainous parts of Switzerland, I was
struck with admiration and astonishment, to observe rocks,
that were formerly barren, now planted with vines, or
abounding in rich pasture; and at marking the traces of the
plough along the sides of the steepest declivities. In a
word, the inhabitants seem to have surmounted every ob∣struction
of soil, situation, and climate; and to have spread
<PB N="161" REF="171"/>
fertility over various spots, which nature seemed to have
consigned to everlasting barrenness. In fine, a general sim∣plicity
of manners, an open and unaffected frankness, toge∣ther
with an invincible spirit of freedom, may justly be
mentioned, in the number of those peculiar qualities which
dignify the public character of this people; and distinguish
them with honour among the nations of Europe.</P>
<P>I HAVE now laid before you the principal observations
which occurred to me in my journey through Switzerland:
happy! if they may in any respect have contributed to your
information or amusement. They were originally intended
merely as a private memorial of friendship; but I have an

<HEAD TYPE="sub">COMO—MENDRISIO—LAKE OF COMO—PLINIANA—FORT
OF FUENTES—LAGHETTO DI CHIAVENNA—ENTRANCE
INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE GRISONS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Chiavenna, <DATE>July 21st 1779.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I travelled over part of Switzerland, it has been
my desire to make a tour through the remainder of that
country, particularly to visit the Grisons; and, being now on
my return to England, I shall take this opportunity of
indulging my curiosity, and propose to myself the satis∣faction
of continuing to send you, on this as on the former
occasion, all the information I am able to procure.</P>
<P>I QUITTED Milan last week, and proceeded through a
gently rising country, well wooded and fertile in corn and
vines, to Como. This town being the birth-place of Pliny
the younger, the inhabitants have placed his statue in a
niche on the outside of the church, with a Latin inscription
bearing the date of 1499. I need not remind you, with how
much rapture and enthusiasm Pliny mentions the delightful
situation of his native town, and the romantic scenery of the
environs, in those letters, of which you have given to the
public so accurate and elegant a translation.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="178"/>
COMO is indeed most pleasantly situated, in a narrow vale,
enclosed by fertile hills, upon the southern extremity of the
beautiful lake which bears the same name. The town is
surrounded by a wall defended with picturesque towers, and
backed by a conical eminence, on which stand the ruins of
an antient castle. The houses are neatly built of stone; and
the cathedral is a handsome edifice of white marble, hewn
from the neighbouring quarries. The inhabitants have esta∣blished
several manufactures of cotton and silk, and carry
on some trade with the Grisons.</P>
<P>FROM Como I made an excursion to Mendrisio, one of the
Italian bailliages belonging to the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appenzel is excluded from the co∣regency because the cession was made in 1512, the year before that republic was ad∣mitted into the Helvetic confederacy. Be∣side Mendrisio and Balerna, the other Italian bailliages are Locarno, Lugano, and Val-Maggia. Uri, Schwetz, and Underwal∣den, possess three bailliages, Bellinzona, Riviera, and Val-Brenna, which were equally dismembered from the Milanese.</NOTE> twelve cantons of Swit∣zerland.
These bailliages formed part of the Milanese, and
in 1512 were ceded to the cantons by Maximilian Sforza,
who was raised to the ducal throne by the Swiss, after they
had expelled the troops of Louis the Twelfth, and taken
possession of the duchy. Francis the first, successor of
Louis, having recovered the Milanese, and secured his con∣quest
by the victory of Marignano, purchased the friendship
of the Swiss by confirming their right to the ceded terri∣tory;
a right which the subsequent dukes of Milan have
been too prudent to dispute.</P>
<P>MENDRISIO and Balerna is one of the smallest of these
transalpine bailliages: the bailif or governor is appointed
<PB N="171" REF="179"/>
successively by each of the twelve cantons, and remains in
office two years. He is supreme judge in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In case of capital punishment, he is obliged to consult the secretary, notary, and the other officers of the district; but as they have no vote, his power is supreme.</NOTE> criminal affairs
without appeal: a power too great to be entrusted to a
stranger, commonly ignorant of the laws, and interested to
increase his revenue. In civil causes an appeal lies to the
syndicate of Switzerland. The inhabitants enjoy considerable
privileges, civil, ecclesiastical, and commercial. The district
is extremely fertile in vines, corn, and pasturage; and yields
a great quantity of excellent silk.</P>
<P>UPON my return to Como, I embarked upon the lake.
The banks near the town are richly wooded, and studded
with country houses and small villages, which lie upon the
gentle acclivities near the margin of the water. At first the
lake is scarcely a quarter of a mile broad, but it widened as
we turned round a neck of land upon which is situated the
small village of Turnio. The neighbourhood of Turnio,
and the districts bordering the lake of Como, supply, for the
most part, those Italian emigrants who wander through
Europe vending barometers and thermometers; of whom
numbers annually resort to England.</P>
<P>AFTER about an hour's rowing we came to Pliniana,
remarkable for a singular fountain, which is still to be seen
in the same state as described by Pliny. Pliniana, a villa
belonging to a Milanese nobleman, is constructed upon the
edge of the water, in a most romantic situation, backed by
<PB N="172" REF="180"/>
rocks covered with trees and pasture. The master of the
house received me with much civility and politeness, and
kindly accompanied me to the fountain. It is a spring,
which bursts from the rock close to the house, and falls in
natural cascades into the lake. I examined some of the
phaenomena alluded to in the following description, and re∣ceived
the others from the gentleman himself, who had re∣peatedly
made them the subject of his observation. The
spring ebbs and flows three times a day: this increase and
decrease is regular, excepting in bad weather. In the late
season, which has been remarkably fair, its changes were
more visible than usual. From being almost dry, it gradu∣ally
rises, until it forms a considerable stream; and then as
gradually subsides, till the period of its swell returns. I saw
it in its flow, and measured its increase by placing stones at
different distances, all of which it reached and covered in a
small space of time. The original passage, in which Pliny
describes the ebb and flow of this spring, is written upon the
wall of an adjoining apartment.</P>
<P>Fons oritur in monte, per saxa decurrit, excipitur caena∣tiunculâ
manu factâ; ibi paululùm retentus in Larium lacum
decidit. Hujus mira natura: ter in die statis auctibus ac
diminutionibus crescit, decrcscitque. Cernitur id palam, &amp;
cum summâ voluptate deprehenditur, juxtà recumbis, et
vescêris: atque etiam ex ipso fonte (nam est frigidissimus)
potas: interim ille certis dimensisque momentis vel subtrahitur
vel adsurgit, annulum seu quid aliud ponis in sicco, alluitur
sensim, ac novissimè aperitur: detegitur rursùs paulatimque
<PB N="173" REF="181"/>
deseritur: si diutiùs obsêrves utrumque iterum ac tertio
videas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin. Epist.</HI> lib. iv. Ep. xxx.—“There is a spring which rises in a neighbouring mountain; and running among the rocks is received into a little banquetting-room, from whence, after the force of its cur∣rent is a little restrained, it falls into the Latian lake. The nature of this spring is extremely surprizing; it ebbs and flows regularly three times a day. The in∣crease and decrease is plainly visible, and very entertaining to observe. You sit down by the side of the fountain, and whilst you are taking a repast and drinking its water, which is extremely cool, you see it gradually rise and fall. If you place a ring, or any thing else at the bottom when it is dry, the stream reaches it by degrees till it is entirely covered, and then again gently retires from it; and if you wait you may see it thus advance and recede three times successively.” <HI>Melmoth's Translation.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING gratified my curiosity at Pliniana, I embarked,
and continued to Clarice, where I passed the night. The
weather, which has lately been uncommonly sultry, is sud∣denly
changed; and this morning a violent thunder-storm
overtook us upon the lake. The water being so much
agitated, that we could not proceed without danger, we
landed at a small village upon the western side of the lake,
until the storm should subside. The navigation of these
lakes, which are enclosed between the mountains, is oc∣casionally
dangerous, according to Virgil's description of the
Benacus, or Lago di Guarda:
<Q><L>Tu, Lari maxime, tuque</L>
<L>Fluctibus et fremitu assurgens, Benace, marino.</L></Q>
Travellers who have visited these parts in calm weather are
apt to consider such expressions as exaggerated; but I am
convinced, from the storm to which I have just been wit∣ness,
that such a description is consonant to truth.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="182"/>
THE lake of Como is about thirty-six miles in length, in
general from two to three miles broad, and four at the widest
part, where it is divided into two branches. The great
branch leads directly to Como; and the smaller branch,
called the lake of Lecco, discharges the Adda, and commu∣nicates,
by means of that river and the canals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 88.</NOTE> of the Adda
and the Canale Vecchio, with Milan. The borders are high
hills covered with vines, Spanish chesnut, walnut, and
almond trees, and dotted with numerous villages and small
towns. The hills which bound the lake rise gradually higher
and higher, from those which encircle Como to the crags
which tower near its upper extremity.</P>
<P>THE storm at length subsiding, I embarked, and proceeded
to Bellano, whose streets are so narrow as scarcely to admit
the smallest cart. It is situated at the foot of a lofty pre∣cipice,
rent from top to bottom by a chasm, through which
a furious torrent forces its way. A bridge is thrown across
the chasm, from whence the spectator looks down with
terror into a gulph scarcely inferior in depth to that at the
Panton-bruck<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Letter 6.</NOTE>, in the canton of Glarus; and an aqueduct
is conducted along the precipitous sides of the rock. I again
embarked, and proceeding to Domasio, at Bellano waited
upon the governor, in order to obtain his permission to visit
the Fort of Fuentes: my request being readily complied with,
I crossed the lake, accompanied by a soldier from Domasio,
and landed at Collico.</P>
<P><PB REF="183"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="184"/>
A LITTLE above Domasio, on both sides of the lake,
begins the <HI>malaria,</HI> or unwholesome air. In these parts the
borders of the lake are no longer abrupt hills rising boldly
from the edge of the water; but a flat-swamp, which was
formerly covered with water. The inhabitants are subject
to intermitting fevers; on which account, during the heats
of summer, when the malignity of the atmosphere is at its
height, the greatest part of the inhabitants quit the plain,
and retire to the neighbouring mountains. We found
Collico and its neighbourhood almost entirely deserted; the
cottages were shut up; and, had it not been for the appear∣ance
of a straggling man and woman, we should have con∣cluded
this part of the country to have been quite unin∣habited.
After walking about two miles from Collico, we
came to the bottom of the rock, upon which stands the Fort
of Fuentes. But before we ascend, let me detain you a
moment with a short history of this fort, which at the begin∣ning
of the last century was so much celebrated in the
annals of Europe.</P>
<P>ONE of the articles in a treaty between Francis Sforza,
Duke of Milan, and the Grisons, expressly stipulating that
no fort should be constructed in the district of <HI>Piantedio,</HI>
was confirmed by the Spanish branch of the House of
Austria, which succeeded Charles the Fifth in the posses∣sion
of the Milanese. Notwithstanding, however, this agree∣ment,
when the religious disputes, occasioned by the intro∣duction
of the reformed religion into the Valteline, had
created a jealousy between the House of Austria and the
Grisons, and affairs seemed tending to a rupture; the count
de Fuentes, governor of Milan, laid, in 1603, the foundation
<PB N="176" REF="185"/>
of the fort, which he called after his own name, and saw it
completed in 1606. From this place, situated in the <HI>Pian∣tedio,</HI>
he introduced troops into the Valteline, and supported
the inhabitants in their hostilities against the Grisons.
Henry the Fourth of France, alluding to the construction
and situation of this fort upon the borders of Italy, and near
the confines of the Grisons, used to say, <HI>Il veut du même noeud
serrer la gorge de l'Italie et les pieds aux Grisons</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With the same knot he binds the neck of Italy and the feet of the Grisons.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF you are not fatigued with this preliminary account,
we will now mount to the fort, and take a view of its present
state. It is built upon an insulated rock, about a mile and
a half from the nearest ridge of mountains, and two miles
from the lake, so that it completely commands the only
great opening which leads into the Valteline, either from the
Milanese or the Grisons; a situation of great importance,
when the possession of the Valteline was an object of such
consequence to the House of Austria. The fortifications,
which are only a quarter of a mile in circumference, are
constructed with stone, and are very strong. The only
buildings are a few ruinous barracks for soldiers, and the
governor's house, which is in the most wretched condition.
The whole garrison consists of three soldiers, who at the ex∣piration
of three days, return to Domasio, and are relieved
by an equal number from the same place. The only in∣habitants
are a peasant and his wife, who have resided there
a year, and have been almost constantly afflicted with the
ague.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="186"/>
THE plain below the rock being entirely marshy and cover∣ed
with rushes, exhales a pestilential effluvia, which infects the
atmosphere, and occasions the unwholesomeness of the fort.
The Spaniards were accustomed to style this place, from its
peculiar situation, the <HI>yoke</HI> of the Grisons; while the Grisons,
in allusion to its bad air, termed it, with more propriety, the
<HI>grave</HI> of the Spaniards. The view from the fort is remark∣ably
fine and picturesque. On one side, the rich Valteline,
watered by the turbulent Adda; on the other, by the lakes of
Como and Chiavenna, beautifully encircled with numerous
town villages. The hills which skirt the Valteline and the lake
of Como present a variegated landscape of forests, corn-fields,
and pastures, finely contrasted, towards the Grisons, by the
rugged Rhetian Alps covered with eternal snow.</P>
<P>HAVING taken leave of the three soldiers, and bade adieu
to the peasant and his wife, I descended into the plain: the
soil of which is fertile, but being subject to frequent inunda∣tions,
is not capable of constant cultivation. That part
which lies between the fort and the lake is so marshy, that
although the strait line to the place, where the boat waited
for me, scarcely exceeded two miles, yet I was obliged to make
a circuit of five before I arrived. In my way, I passed a
range of square stones, which form the boundary between
the Milanese and the country of the Grisons; on one side of
each stone was inscribed <HI>Stato di Milano,</HI> on the other <HI>Gri∣gioni:</HI>
they were put up, as the date informed me, in 1763,
the year in which the treaty, or the <HI>capitulation</HI> of Milan,
was concluded between the Empress of Germany, as sove∣reign
of Milan, and the Grisons. By this treaty the limits of
<PB N="178" REF="187"/>
the two states were finally settled, and several other subjects
of dispute were amicably adjusted. I came to the Adda,
which, for a short space, makes the line of separation be∣tween
the Milanese and Grisons, and walked along its banks.
Its stream is muddy, and navigable only by rafts. Most of
the maps of the lake of Como are erroneous, in representing
that lake and the <HI>Laghetto</HI> di Chiavenna as one great piece
of water, and the Adda as flowing into the former; whereas
the two lakes are distinct, and the Adda joins a small stream
which issues from the <HI>Laghetto,</HI> and thus united falls into the
lake of Como.</P>
<P>I EMBARKED near Dacio, which is the last village in the
Milanese; at which place all boats laden with merchan∣dise
are obliged to land, and pay a small duty. Soon after∣wards
I entered the lake of Chiavenna, which belongs
to the Grisons. The views of this lake are extremely wild
and magnificent; surrounded as it is with barren rocks,
craggy, and rising into spires sprinkled with snow: the
bases of those dreadful precipices are lost in the dead and
overshadowed water, dangerous on account of its malignant
vapours, and affording no shelter, scarcely a landing-place,
to the crews of those frail boats, which are caught unwarily
in the violent storms to which it is subject. I landed at
Riva, which consists of a few scattered cottages and ware∣houses,
the miserable owners whereof are the only inhabi∣tants,
and having procured some horses, proceeded to Chia∣venna
by moon-light. The villages were almost entirely de∣serted,
and the inhabitants withdrawn to the mountains.
The people in general are so greatly alarmed at the un∣wholesome
<PB N="179" REF="188"/>
state of the air in this season, that the water∣men
who rowed me from Como, although exceedingly
fatigued, went back to Domasio; and exerted all their elo∣quence
to dissuade me from my first intention of remaining
in the plain: overcome by their repeated importunities, I
pursued my journey to Chiavenna. Indeed, no other proof
of the tainted air is requisite than a view of the inhabitants;
the few peasants whom I met in the villages, as well near the
Fort of Fuentes as in the valley of Chiavenna, were mostly
wan and livid. The narrow valley through which I passed
from the lake to Chiavenna, is enclosed between the first
and lowest chain of the Rhetian Alps; it is watered by the
torrent Maira, and produces Turkish wheat, pasturage, ches∣nuts,
and mulberry-trees, together with a great abundance
of willows. Near Chiavenna the ascent is rapid, and that
town is built in a higher and more wholesome situation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 69.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PLURS—ITS DESTRUCTION IN THE LAST CENTURY
BY A FALL OF A MOUNTAIN—VALLEY OF PRE∣GALIA.</HEAD>
<P><DATE>July 25th.</DATE></P>
<P>MY last letter left me at Chiavenna, of which town I
defer sending you any description, as I propose re∣turning
there in my way to Coire. The morning after my
arrival, I rode about four miles, to the spot formerly occu∣pied
by the town of Piuro, or Plurs, which was totally over∣whelmed
by the fall of mount Conto, under which it was
built. This terrible catastrophe happened August 25th,
1618.</P>
<P>PLURS was a large and flourishing town, subject, as well
as Chiavenna, to the Grisons. Contemporary writers men∣tion,
that it contained three churches, many large houses,
and a stone bridge over the Maira; and that its population
amounted to at least 1500 inhabitants, who carried on no
inconsiderable commerce. The valley in which it was situa∣ted
is very narrow, and the whole town was buried in one
undistinguished ruin. A contemporary account relates,
that the cloud of dust and rubbish was so great as to cover
the heavens like smoke, and even to extend as far as Chia∣venna:
the inhabitants of Chiavenna, alarmed at this un∣common
phenomena, were still more terrified at the disap∣pearance
<PB N="181" REF="190"/>
of the torrent Maira, which ceased to flow by that
town for near an hour; its course being stopped by the fal∣len
fragments of rock, until it forced its way over the ruins.
This event spread such an universal alarm among the inha∣bitants,
from an apprehension that the torrent had under∣mined
Chiavenna, and would burst out with such fury as to
deluge the whole place, that great numbers precipitately fled
into the mountains.</P>
<P>I WALKED over the spot where Plurs was built: parts of
the antient walls, and the ruins of a country house, which
belonged to the Franci, the richest family in the place, are
the only remains of its former existence; and these would not
be noticed by a passenger. A peasant, who has a cottage close
to the ruins, pointed out to me every place, as it had been ex∣plained
to him by his grandfather. He shewed me where
stood the churches and principal houses, the channel
through which the river then flowed, and where the bridge
was constructed. He informed me, that in digging, several
dead bodies had been found; and particularly the bones of
a priest, covered with shreds of garments, which indicated
that he was employed in divine service when the rock over∣whelmed
the town. Houshold utensils are frequently dug up;
the other day several corpses were discovered, and on the finger
bone of one were a silver and two gold rings. Vineyards, ches∣nut-trees,
and houses, cover the spot where this unfortunate
town was once situated. The valley in this part has an oval
appearance, and is skirted by a beautiful grove of chesnut-trees;
the surrounding mountains are steep and rugged, and
from the top of mount Savonne, <HI>l'acqua fragia,</HI> a consider∣able
<PB N="182" REF="191"/>
torrent, precipitates itself, at first in a full unbroken
stream, and afterwards divides into three separate falls,
highly ornamental to the beautiful scenery of the vale.</P>
<P>THE guide conducted me to the house of a gentleman
near Chiavenna, in order to see a drawing of Plurs before
it was overwhelmed; the ancestors of this person had large
possessions, and were the richest family in the town. The
master of the house shewed me the picture, and explained to
me the situation of the different buildings. He then politely
accompanied me through his grounds to a manufacture of
stone pots called <HI>Lavezzi,</HI> which are made near Chiavenna,
and are much used for kitchen utensils throughout these
countries, and some parts of Italy. This manufacture
is very antient: Pliny mentions the stone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lapis Ollaris.</HI>—Pliny's <HI>Lapis Comensis</HI> is classed by Wallerius among the steatites, by Linnaeus among the tales.—It is opake, unctuous to the touch, and composed of mica and steatites. When it is first taken from the quarry it is easily cut and turned; on being exposed to the air it hardens, but will take no polish.</NOTE> under the deno∣mination
of <HI>Lapis Comensis,</HI> because the pots were sent to
Como and there exported. These utensils are made by the
following process: the workmen hew from the quarry semi∣circular
blocks of stone, from which, with an instrument re∣sembling
that used by turners, they hollow a vessel about a
foot in diameter. From the mass which remains, by a simi∣lar
mode of proceeding, they frame another utensil of infe∣rior
dimensions, and continue their operation till they have
produced a series of semicircular pots, gradually decreasing
to the size of a small bason. From Plurs I continued along
the valley of Santa Croce, and entered the country of the
Grisons at the small village of Casta Segna, in Pregalia.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="192"/>
AT Bondo, which is a small village in the valley of Pre∣galia,
Count de Salis, formerly British envoy to the Grisons,
has constructed a large and commodious house, and entirely
fitted up in the English taste. It is situated at the extremity
of a small plain scarcely half a mile in length, and about four
hundred paces broad, bounded on each side by a chain of the
Rhetian Alps, whose sides are covered with forests intermixed
with luxuriant pasture. The plain is shut in by some rugged
rocks, behind which others shoot to an enormous height,
crowned with perpetual snow. The little plain produces ex∣cellent
pasture, barley, rye, vegetables of all sorts, and
some fruit-trees. Through it dashes the torrent Maira
over broken fragments of rock.</P>
<P>I RAMBLED about the valley of Pregalia and the neigh∣bouring
mountains; and observed the domestic oeconomy
of the peasants. Their chief food is salt meat, rye bread,
milk, cheese, polenta, and chesnuts, which are so plentiful at
this season of the year, that they make a principal ingredient
in all their meals: the most common methods of dressing
them are to boil, and serve them up with crumbs of bread;
or to grind them to a paste, and then heat them with some
milk. The peasants are well clothed. They manufacture
linen and coarse cloth at home, every family having a
loom, which is worked in the winter season. The finer
cloth, which they wear only on Sundays and festivals, is
procured from Germany.</P>
<P>THE valley of Pregalia reaches from the Podesteria of
Plurs to the consines of Upper Engadina, and contains
about 1800 inhabitants: it is a high jurisdiction in the league
<PB N="184" REF="193"/>
of God's House, and is divided into the two independent com∣munities
of <HI>Sopra</HI> and <HI>Sotto Porta;</HI> so denominated from a
wall with an opening called <HI>Porta,</HI> through which the road
passes, and which separates the valley into two equal parts.
These two communities enjoy a democratical form of
government: a short account of which will convey to you
some idea of the mode in which the administration of affairs
is carried on in these little states.</P>
<P>EACH community has its general assembly, in which the
sovereign power is vested; every male at the age of eighteen
has a vote: in each of these assemblies the magistrates and
representatives to the general diet are chosen by the majo∣rity
of voices; instructions are given to the representatives;
and all appeals from the diet decided in the last resort. For
civil causes, the two communities have separate tribunals,
composed of the <HI>Landamman,</HI> who is president, and twelve
assistants; and an appeal lies from one to the other. For
criminal affairs, there is one court of justice, composed of a
<HI>Podesta,</HI> and an equal number of judges from each community.
The Podesta is chosen in the following manner: each com∣munity
appoints two persons, who nominate nine others;
and these nine chuse two candidates, who draw lots for the
office. The same person is not unfrequently nominated Po∣desta
by both parties; and then the lot is cast, to ascertain to
which he belongs. This criminal court of justice is always
held at Vico Soprano, in Sopra Porta. In all delinquencies the
punishments are extraordinarily severe, and the remission or
alleviation is entirely left to the judges, who generally take a
commutation in fines; so that if the criminal is poor, he under∣goes
the punishment; if rich, he redeems himself by money.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 70.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">DESCRIPTION OF THE MARMOT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Marmot is extremely common in the mountains
of Switzerland, and particularly in this part of the
Grisons; and, as many erroneous accounts of this sagacious
little animal have been given, I shall send you the following
extract, selected from a description written in the German
tongue, by Dr. Girtaner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A French translation of this account is given in Rozier's Journal for 1786.</NOTE>; which cannot fail being highly
interesting to all, who love to search into the oeconomy of
nature.</P>
<P>DOCTOR AMSTEIN, of Zitzers, in the country of the Gri∣sons,
is the first naturalist who has narrowly inquired into
the oeconomy of the marmot. Since his description of this
animal in professor Schreber's work, he has himself made
several new observations, and obtained additional informa∣tion
from Messrs Aporta and Catani, two clergymen of the
Grisons.</P>
<P>THE marmot inhabits the highest and most inaccessible
mountains; prefers the small narrow valleys, and particu∣larly
the western or southern aspect, as the warmest, and
<PB N="186" REF="195"/>
avoids moist places. On the opening of spring, when he
issues from his hole, where he has slept during winter, he
descends to the lower regions, where vegetation is forward.
In summer he again ascends to the rocky heights, and into
solitary caverns. He feeds upon herbs and roots, and par∣ticularly
on the alpine plantain, mountain spignel, alpine
ladies mantle, mountain sorrel, alpine toad-flax, alpine tre∣foil,
and alpine starwort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plantago alpina, Phellandrium mutellina, Alchemilla alpina, Rumex digynus, Antirrhi∣num alpinum, Trifolium alpinum, Aster alpinus.</NOTE>. When tame, he eats almost
every thing except flesh. On drinking, he raises up his
head like fowls at every sip, looking on each side with a
timorous watchfulness. He drinks but little, to which
Dr. Amstein attributes his fatness. He is extremely fond of
butter and milk.</P>
<P>AT break of day the old marmots come out of their holes
and feed; afterwards they bring out their young ones; the
latter scamper on all sides, chase each other, sit on their hind
feet, and remain in that posture, facing the sun, with an air
expressive of satisfaction. They are all particularly fond of
warmth, and when they think themselves secure, will bask
in the sun for several hours. Before they collect the grass,
either for their food, or for their winter habitations, they
form themselves into a circle, sitting on their hind legs, and
reconnoitre on all sides. On the least alarm, the first gives
instantly a shrill cry, which is communicated from one to
the other, and they escape without repeating the noise.
<PB N="187" REF="196"/>
The chasseurs, by imitating these successive whistlings, ap∣proach
so near as to come within shot of them. The marmot
has a quick eye, discovers the enemy at a considerable
distance, and flies when he is pursued. When apprehensive
of being followed, whole families quit their dwellings, and
wander from mountain to mountain, although they must
again construct their habitations: but when flight is impos∣sible,
they defend themselves with spirit against men and
dogs, and attack all who approach them with their teeth
and claws.</P>
<P>THEY always live together in societies. They have both
summer and winter dwellings, which are easily distinguished.
The former remain open during the whole year; whereas the
latter are closed at the end of September. In the summer
dwellings is found dung in great abundance, but no hay: on
the contrary, the winter habitations never contain any dung,
but much hay. Near the latter is perceived a more consider∣able
quantity of earth, which annually increases according to
the size of the dwelling, and the augmentation of the family.
In the formation of their dwellings they scoop out the earth
with great dexterity and expedition: a small part they throw
away, and by beating the remainder close, render the passage
very compact and solid. The opening being scarcely more
than six or seven inches in diameter, is just large enough to
admit the animal. The interior is from eight to twenty feet
in length; it consists of a passage, which at about five or six
feet from the entrance, divides into two branches: the one
leading to a small cavity; the other to the chamber in
<PB N="188" REF="197"/>
which they repose. The passage, and two branches, are al∣ways
carried in a straight line, unless the intervention of a
rock, or any other impediment, obliges them to take
another direction. The chamber is round or oval, arched
at top, and in its form resembles the shape of an oven. It is
from three to seven feet in diameter, being larger or smaller
according to the number of the family. It is strewed with
hay, in which the marmots lie in a dormant state during
the whole winter.</P>
<P>ON retiring to this dwelling about the beginning of
October, they carefully close the entrance so as to exclude all
air, with a cement of earth mixed with stones and hay.
On opening this chamber three weeks after it is closed,
the marmots are discovered lying on the hay close to each
other, and rolled up like hedge-hogs, without the least ap∣pearance
of life. Usually from five to sixteen are found
together; sometimes, but rarely, two families occupy the
same dwelling; and occasionally, but very seldom, one has
been discovered alone. If exposed to warmth they awaken.
The tame marmots do not sleep during winter; but on the
approach of that season, excited by instinct, they collect ma∣terials
towards constructing their dwellings. The wild mar∣mots
occupy their winter habitation in October, and quit it
towards the latter end of March or the beginning of April.
In removing the cement which closes the opening, they do
not push it outwards, but draw it inwards, and probably
convey the materials, which would block up the principal
passage, into the small cavity. They copulate soon after
<PB N="189" REF="198"/>
coming out: in June or July young ones have been
observed, about the size of rats. It is probable that they do
not eat during their torpid state; for the same quantity of
hay is observed both in spring and autumn in their winter
habitations, and those which have been dug out in that
season are thin and perfectly empty. The flesh of the mar∣mot
is eatable, and its skin is used for furs.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PASSAGE OF THE MALLOGGIA—LAKE OF SIGLIO—SELVA
PIANA AND ST. MOREZZO—EXPEDITION
TO THE JULIAN COLUMNS—BEVIO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>St. Morezzo, <DATE>July 31st.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE road through Pregalia to Coire admits carriages,
but is very indifferently paved. I passed through
the village Promontogno, then through the Porta, to Stam∣pa,
Vico-Soprano, Borgo, Nuovo, and Casaucia. The houses in
this valley are of stone, plastered and white-washed; they are
not scattered, as in the small cantons of Switzerland; but
every half mile a cluster of habitations presents itself.</P>
<P>BEYOND Bondo the country produces no more chesnut-trees,
but principally larch and firs; it yields grass, barley,
and rye. Near Casaucia is the barren and lofty mountain of
Set. I here quitted the high road, which turns towards
Coire, and about a mile and a half further the valley ter∣minates,
and began to mount a very steep ascent, by the side
of the torrent Maira, which rushes amidst a forest of firs;
it descends from the glacier of the Malin, a ridge of Alps
separating the Valteline from the country of the Grisons. A
little further I reached the top of the Malloggia, and observed
the Orlenga, a glistening torrent, falling from the Lungin
mountain, and forming the remotest source of the Inn.
The Malloggia is the point of partition, dividing the waters
<PB N="191" REF="200"/>
which run towards the Black Sea, from those which flow
into the Adriatic. The tops of the circumjacent mountains
are mostly rugged, and covered with snow: lower down
they are enlivened with under-wood, firs, and pasture.</P>
<P>I STOPPED at a single house, a kind of inn, where travel∣lers
are accommodated. The landlord and his family speak
an Italian jargon, similar to the Milanese dialect, which is
common in Pregalia. The next place is Siglio in Upper En∣gadina,
where Romansh is the general tongue. On in∣quiring
whether it was similar to the Italian spoken in
Pregalia, the landlord informed me, that the two languages
are totally different; and the servant assured me, that she
could scarcely comprehend a word which was uttered by the
inhabitants of Siglio. From Malloggia I descended, and
crossed the Orlenga, and continued along the banks of the
lake of Siglio. The way was bad and craggy until I came
to the consines of Engadina, where an excellent road com∣menced.</P>
<P>THE small lake of Siglio is about five miles in circum∣ference,
and is finely situated between high perpendicular
rocks. It takes its name from Siglio, which we left at
a little distance on our right. I crossed the Inn soon after
it issues from the lake, and pursued my course over the
dry bed of the torrent Fait, which formerly flowed into the
Inn; but has lately changed its course, and now falls into
the lake of the Selva Piana. Nothing is more common than
for these torrents to shift their channels; and I could observe
evident traces, that some of them had at former periods
<PB N="192" REF="201"/>
watered the small plain between the lakes of Siglio and Selva
Piana. The village of that name stands pleasantly upon a
small rising ground; and the lake of Selva Piana, though
much smaller than that of Siglio, far surpasses it in the
beauty of its banks, which are fringed with hanging groves
of fir and larch. From this lake the Inn issues in a
larger stream, falls again at a little distance into the lake of
St. Morezzo; from whence it dashes through a deep rocky
channel into the plain of Celerina, where it runs in a more
tranquil current. These little plains, or valleys, are broader
and longer than that of Bondo, and produce as much grass,
which is now mowing.</P>
<P>AT Selva Piana, I attempted to converse with some of the
inhabitants, but could scarcely comprehend them. I have
been endeavouring also to talk with the inhabitants of this
place. Many speak Italian, as it is much frequented by
strangers for the sake of the waters; but the greatest part
could talk nothing but Romansh. This morning being Sun∣day
I attended divine service; the clergyman preached in the
language of the country, and I could understand little more
than that the text was in the 22d chapter of St. Luke. The
sermon, which is the principal part of the service, was about
an hour long; the prayers are very short; the girls sung
psalms; some of them had delightful voices, and performed
with great taste and propriety: a proof of their neighbour∣hood
to Italy.</P>
<P>ST. MOREZZO, or as it is most commonly called St. Mau∣rice,
stands agreeably upon the side of an hill, and overlooks
<PB N="193" REF="202"/>
a small lake, which lies in the bosom of the mountains, and
is bounded by rising banks, studded with wood and pasture.
It is a village in Upper Engadina, and is remarkable for a
plentiful spring of mineral water, much esteemed for its
efficacy in curing several disorders. It issues from the
ground, about the distance of half a mile on the other side
of the river Inn; is a very plentiful source, and strongly
impregnated with vitriol. Upon plunging Reaumur's ther∣mometer
into the source, it sunk from 12 to 4 ½. I was in∣formed
that a gentleman had lately ascertained, from re∣peated
observations, that the thermometer varied according
to the greater or less degree of rain; but that upon an
average the mercury generally stood between 4 and 7.</P>
<P>I AM lodged in one of the boarding houses, which abound
in this place, for the accommodation of persons who drink
the waters. The company at table consist, at present, of
only two merchants of Appenzel, who are established at
Genoa, and a clergyman of Lower Engadina. As I soon
discovered the clergyman to be an intelligent man, I
held frequent conversation with him upon the Romansh
tongue; but defer enlarging upon that subject until I shall
have gained further information. I also talked with him
upon the state of religion among the reformed part of the
Grisons, and particularly in relation to the <HI>Pietists,</HI> a sect
which has lately made great progress in these parts. From
the account given by the clergyman, who evidently leaned
towards their opinions, these Pietists appear similar to our
Methodists: for instance, they exalt faith above good works,
affect to be uncommonly rigid and pious, condemn all diver∣sions,
<PB N="194" REF="203"/>
card-playing, and assemblies, as criminal; frequently
despair of their salvation, fancy visions, enjoy supernatural
inward illuminations, and employ so much time in prayer
as to neglect their ordinary business. The clergymen of
this sect are for the most part ignorant and superficial, are
vehemently vociferous in the pulpit, thunder out reproba∣tion,
and expatiate upon justification, without explaining the
methods of avoiding the one, and of obtaining the other.
These preachers, notwithstanding their affectation of a total
indifference to worldly matters, do not confine their views
merely to theological speculations, but pay a considerable
degree of attention to political affairs: and as, by means of
their authority in religious concerns, they possess a consider∣able
influence over the votes of their parishioners, they are
on that account much caressed and countenanced by several
leading persons among the Grisons. In these parts the dress
of the women is singular, and not unbecoming: it consists
of a black or blue jacket with red sleeves, striped blue and
white petticoats, a small black velvet cap trimmed with gold
or silver lace, with a black or white lace border hanging
over the forehead.</P>
<P>I MADE an excursion to the Julian Columns, of which
Scheuzer has given a description and an engraving in his
<HI>Itinera Alpina:</HI> he supposes them to have been erected by
Julius Caesar, in order to mark the limits of his conquests in
these parts; and asserts that, <HI>Ne plus ultra,</HI> and <HI>Omitto Rhetos
indomitos,</HI> are inscribed upon them. From St. Morezzo I
went to Selva Piana, then turned up a path which leads
to the Julian Alps, and after continuing about two hours
<PB N="195" REF="204"/>
over rugged rocks, reached the Julian columns, if they de∣serve
so dignified an appellation. They are of a circular
shape, somewhat similar to the Roman mile-stones, placed
at the distance of about forty-feet from each other. Their
height above the ground is about four feet, and they seem
to be buried about a foot, or scarcely so much: their cir∣cumference
is about five feet. They have neither pedestals
nor capitals, and are flattish at top, with a small round
hole in the middle about four inches diameter and six deep.
They were formed by art, but in the rudest manner. I exa∣mined,
with great attention, if I could observe the inscriptions
of <HI>Ne plus ultra,</HI> and <HI>Omitto Rhetos indomitos,</HI> but I could
not discover the smallest traces of any letters. We have no
reason therefore to conclude, that these pillars were erected
by Julius Caesar in order to ascertain the boundary of his
conquests, or at least we have no proofs upon which we can
depend for the truth of this popular story: I do not how∣ever
regret, that I made the excursion; for although my
curiosity has been disappointed in a view of the pillars, yet it
has been gratified in visiting these wild and romantic alps.
The Julian Alps produce much pasture, but no wood, which
is a proof of their great elevation. Near the stones just now de∣scribed
is a piece of water called the Julian lake: it is supplied
from a glacier on a superincumbent mountain, and sends forth
a torrent that descends to Selva Piana, and falls into the lake
of that name: it may be considered as a source of the Inn.</P>
<P>I SOON afterwards stopped at a cottage, the only house
in the whole extent of these Alps: it is occupied only during
summer; the tenants every night house the cattle that graze
<PB N="196" REF="205"/>
upon these mountains, and make large quantities of butter
and cheese. Having taken a refreshing bowl of thick cream,
I began my descent, and observed numerous small streams;
some issuing from rocks, others falling from the glaciers,
and forming the first sources of the Little Rhine. The path
was so steep and craggy, that I gave my horse to the guide,
and preferred walking. About five miles from the pillars, I
arrived at Bevio, a small village upon the Little Rhine, in the
high road which leads to Coire. Every one being employed
in hay-making, I could not gain admittance into the inn: some
friars, however, offered me their house and dinner, and pre∣vented
me from returning to the cottage upon the Julian
Alps. On questioning these friars concerning the constitution
of the Republic of Bevio; they informed me, that Bevio and
Valmorara form one community, governed by eleven magi∣strates,
though the number of voters who appoint these ma∣gistrates
scarcely exceeds forty: the chief is called <HI>Ministrale,</HI>
and is confirmed every year; for which act of politeness
each voter annually receives a florin. About one-third of the
merchandise from Como to Coire passes by Bevio, but the
greatest part is sent by Splugen. After dinner I returned
over the Julian Alps to St. Morezzo.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Zutz, <DATE>August 2d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE ride from St. Morezzo to Zutz, through Celerina,
Samada, Ponto, and Madulein, is extremely pleasant.
These villages lie chiefly upon the sides of the mountains
gently rising above a plain, which in some parts is a mile
broad, in others so narrow as to be entirely occupied by the
river Inn. The valley is enclosed on both sides by a chain
of alps, covered for a considerable height with wood inter∣spersed
with pasture, and their tops capped with snow. The
river, which in this part is free from cataracts, is joined by
innumerable torrents, that rush down the sides of the rocks,
or burst from the ground.</P>
<P>THE Inn, during its progress in this part, is very unlike
most of the rivers which I traced in my former tour. The
Rhone, the Reuss, and the Aar, for instance, fall, near
their sources, in a continual cataract, over fragments of rock,
and through the most wild and uninhabited tracts of country;
while this river directs its course through a cultivated and
populous district, in an equable unbroken stream. The
country is picturesque, and its beauties are of a milder cast
than are usual in these Alpine regions. The burghs, or vil∣lages,
are pleasantly dotted about the plain, at the distance of
<PB N="198" REF="207"/>
about a mile from each other. Each village contains about
fifty or a hundred houses, standing contiguous; these habi∣tations
are of stone plastered and white-washed, and are in
such excellent repair, that they appear as if they had been
newly constructed. The spirit of neatness indeed is so gene∣ral
in Upper Engadina, that I scarcely observed one bad house
through the whole district; and even the barns are as good
as the cottages in many countries.</P>
<P>AS I was riding through Bever, the clergyman of that
place, who was smoking his pipe at his door, stopped me
with a compliment, and upon my entering into conversation
with him, invited me to see his library. I alighted accord∣ingly,
and looked over his collection. He shewed me some
English books, and many in the Romansh language, particu∣larly
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Bible is in the dialect of the Grey League.</NOTE> Bible printed at Coire, which is dedicated to
George the Second when Prince of Wales. He was also
so obliging as to accompany me a little way. About half a
mile from Bever he pointed out to me a single house called
Alles Angnes, where the deputies of the two communities of
Upper Engadina assemble for the purpose of deciding, in
the last resort, appeals in civil causes. A little further he
desired me to observe a small spring, which falls into the
Inn a few paces from its source. It is called Fontana Merla,
and would not, he added, be worthy of notice, if it did not
separate the two communities of Upper Engadina. Soon after∣wards
I took leave of the clergyman, mounted my horse,
and proceeding to Zutz, passed the Inn several times, over
<PB N="199" REF="208"/>
bridges of single arches, which have a very striking ap∣pearance.
They were constructed by scholars of the fa∣mous
Grubenman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. Lett. 2. and 13.</NOTE>, and in the same style of architecture as
the bridges of Schaffhausen and Wettingen, excepting that
they are not covered.</P>
<P>ZUTZ, although not the largest is esteemed the principal
place of Upper Engadina, because it contains the criminal
court of justice. The Landamman of Sotto Fontana Merla,
who always presides in this court, is chosen every other turn
from the family of Planta, established at Zutz: this peculiar
privilege, which gives to that family no inconsiderable
influence in the political affairs of this country, was for∣merly
granted by a bishop of Coire, who was uncle to
one of the Plantas. Upon my arrival at Zutz, I waited
upon Mr. Planta, formerly Envoy from the Republic of
the Grisons to that of Venice; he was appointed to that
embassy in order to renew the antient league which for∣merly
subsisted between the two states, but which had been
interrupted by the last treaty of 1763, between the Empress
of Germany and the Grisons; on which occasion the Vene∣tians
were so much enraged, that they expelled the Grisons
from their territories. This negotiation, however, though
conducted with great ability, was ineffectual. Mr. Planta
received me with great politeness and cordiality, and invited
me to supper; and as the evening was not set in, he accom∣panied
me to what is called the camp of Drusus, which I was
desirous of examining.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="209"/>
YOU recollect the campaign which Drusus, the adopted
son of Augustus, and brother of Tiberius, carried on against
the fierce inhabitants of these mountainous countries; and
which Horace, in compliment to his patron, has alluded to
in the following passages:
<Q><L>Videre Rhaeti bella sub Alpibus</L>
<L>Drusum gerentem et Vindelici;</L></Q>
and afterwards,
<Q><L>—arces</L>
<L>Alpibus impositas tremendas</L>
<L>Dejecit acer plus vice simplici.</L></Q>
This campaign of Drusus against the Rhetians was attended
with great success, and he defeated the barbarous inhabi∣tants,
before deemed unconquerable, (<HI>indomitosque Rhaetos</HI>)
with great slaughter. The supposed remains of his camp
consist of several deep pits, and a mound of earth about
thirty feet high and sixty paces in circumference. These
works did not appear to me to be of Roman construction;
probably they are nothing more than a rude fortification
thrown up during the turbulent times, when the barons
of the country were engaged in perpetual acts of hostility: a
desire to render them venerable by the remoteness of their
origin, and the splendour of the Roman name, seems the
only cause of their being attributed to Drusus. Having
satisfied my curiosity, I returned to Zutz, and passed an
agreeable evening with Mr. Planta.</P>

<P>THE little burghs in these parts are situated at such a
small distance from each other, that my daily journeys are
scarcely so much as a morning's walk; and I am so delighted
with the country and its inhabitants, that I could willingly
take up my abode here for some time longer. Upon my
arrival at Scampf, I carried a letter of recommendation
to Mr. Perini; who introduced me to Mr. Aporta, the
clergyman of the place. He is a native of Lower Engadina,
of the antient and illustrious family of Aporta. He studied<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He received his education, I believe, in the University of Basle.</NOTE>
some time at Deprezin, in Hungary; but returning to his
native country, was soon afterwards appointed pastor of
Scampf. His income is small, scarcely amounting to £. 20<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Considering the different modes of living, and different value of money, this sum is
perhaps equivalent to about £. 60 in England.</NOTE>
per annum, and yet his living is esteemed one of the best in
Engadina. With this moderate revenue he is able to main∣tain
a wife and large family. His chief work, which is a
sufficient proof of his extensive knowledge, and indefatigable
industry, is the History of the Reformation among the
Grisons, in two volumes quarto. It is written in Latin, and
compiled with great impartiality and exactness. The style is
classical and perspicuous. This excellent publication is not
merely confined to ecclesiastical transactions; for as the
affairs of religion are intimately blended with political
events, the latter make no inconsiderable figure in every
History of the Reformation. The reader will find in Mr.
Aporta's performance a minute and faithful account of the
<PB N="202" REF="211"/>
animosities between France and Spain, in relation to the
Grisons; of the rebellion in the Valteline; of the massacre
of the Protestants; and of the subsequent war carried on
under the semblance of religion. This interesting narrative
comprehends almost all the important events in the history
of the Grisons, from the beginning of the reformation to the
peace of the Valteline.</P>
<P>I LOOK up with reverence to this learned author, for his
unwearied industry in completing so laborious a work
with little encouragement, and under all the disadvantages
which arise from a difficulty of procuring books, and strait∣ened
circumstances. All that he ever obtained, beside fame,
was a present of twenty-five guineas, which enabled him to
bear his expences to Zurich, for the purpose of collecting
materials from the manuscripts in the public library. The
work, printed at Coire, at the expence of the typographical
society, has never produced any emolument to the author.
This respectable divine, beside a critical knowledge of the
learned languages, understands and speaks Italian and
German, is able to read French, and has some acquaintance
with the Hungarian and Wallachian tongues. During the
little time I passed in his company, I had frequent occasion
to be surprized at his profound erudition and comprehensive
abilities; and I am particularly indebted to him for much
exact information concerning the Romansh tongue, the
general purport of which I shall transmit to you in a future
letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 90.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="212"/>
UPPER ENGADINA is divided into two communities,
called Sotto and Sopra Fontana Merla, from their situation
above or below that spring. They have both the same court
of criminal justice, which is held at Zutz, and consists of the
Landamman of Sotto, who is president, and sixteen jurymen,
called Trouadors, taken equally from each district. Justice
is more equitably administered in this court than in any other
throughout the Grisons, excepting at Coire; a circumstance
which arises from the following causes. The code of cri∣minal
laws was composed in 1563 by one Juvalta, who had
been envoy from the Republic of the Grisons to Venice, and
had there imbibed more enlarged conceptions of jurispru∣dence,
than at that time prevailed among his rude country∣men.
This excellent code was drawn up in Latin, and in
1644 was translated into Romansh. The fines enjoined for
criminal offences do not belong to the judges, but to the
community. The expences of the process are defrayed, and
a salary is allowed to the judges from the public fund: the
judges by these means, being not so much interested to con∣vict
the prisoner, are not so ready to employ the horrid ex∣pedient
of torture for the purpose of enforcing confession.</P>
<P>ANOTHER cause of the equity observable in this court,
is the mode of electing the judges: they are not, as in many
of the other communities, chosen by the people collectively
assembled, but by sixteen deputies who represent the several
districts. By these means the election is carried on with more
prudence, and with a greater attention to the qualifications of
the judges, than can be expected amidst the confusion of a po∣pular
meeting. The same deputies chuse all the civil magi∣strates
<PB N="204" REF="213"/>
by a majority of voices; and finally decide all legisla∣tive
and political questions, which have before been separately
proposed to the several districts which they represent. Their
constituents have the power (which they frequently exercise)
of peremptorily directing their vote. It is, however, no incon∣siderable
alleviation of the mischiefs frequently attendant on
governments purely democratical, that the whole body of the
populace on no occasion assemble upon one spot, but discuss
matters in detached parties, and send the result of their
deliberation by their representatives.</P>
<P>UPPER ENGADINA is a very beautiful valley, yet, on
account of its elevation, produces nothing but pasture and a
small quantity of rye and barley. The winter sets in early
and ends late, during which time sledges are the ordinary
vehicles. The air, even at the present season, is cold and
piercing, and the corn in the midst of summer is occa∣sionally
much damaged by the hoar-frosts. Hence the
Italian proverb,
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Engadina would be a fine country if there was no frost.</NOTE>Engadina Terra Fina, se non fosse la pruina.</Q></P>
<P>As the district does not yield sufficient productions for
the sustenance of the inhabitants, many of them migrate
into foreign countries; the gentry in the military line, as
is common through Switzerland; others in the capacity of
mechanics, tradesmen, and merchants: their favourite oc∣cupation
is to keep coffee-houses or pastry-cook shops in dif∣ferent
<PB N="205" REF="214"/>
parts of Italy and France. Generally two persons enter
into partnership to carry on the same trade: one stays in his
own country, and the other attends the business for a year,
when he is relieved by his partner, and returns to his family
for the same term. These partners are commonly as
faithful as they are industrious; they annually bring con∣siderable
sums of money into this district, which is esteemed
the richest among the Grisons.</P>
<P>MANY of the inhabitants feed numerous herds of cattle in
the summer months upon the Upper Alps, and export large
quantities of cheese and butter. In the autumn, when
pasture begins to be scarce, they send great part of the cattle
for sale into the Tyrol. The inhabitants live very much
upon salted meat, particularly in winter, on account of the
dearness of fodder. The bread of the country is mostly
brownish; it is baked in little round cakes, only two or three
times in the year, and becomes so hard that it is sometimes
broken with the hatchet; it is not an unpleasant food with
cheese or butter, which are very common. The greatest
part of the butter is made on the Alps; it is afterwards
melted, put into bottles, and frequently continues good
during the whole year. The wine of the Valteline is much
esteemed, and is by no means scarce in this country: it bears
keeping to a very considerable age. I have tasted some wine
from the cask, of a very fine flavour, above fifty years old,
although it grows sour in the space of three years in the
warm climate of the Valteline.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="215"/>
THE people are, for the most part, remarkably polite
and well-bred; they bow to me as I pass with great civility,
and will perform any kind offices in the readiest and most
obliging manner. I am indeed no less delighted with the
manners of the inhabitants, their politeness and hospitality,
than with the romantic scenery of the country. Although
many of the natives spend a great portion of their time in
foreign parts, they seldom lose their attachment to Enga∣dina;
and return with great eagerness to their family and
friends, after their occasional absence. The inhabitants of
Upper Engadina are computed at about four thousand, and
out of these, four or five hundred, upon an average, earn
their livelihood in foreign countries.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Cernetz, <DATE>August 4th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE valley of Upper Engadina, from Celerina to a few
miles beyond Scampf, is nearly level; it is enclosed
between two ridges of mountains, which are highest at Ce∣lerina,
and gradually diminish in height and ruggedness.
About Zutz and Scampf is the finest part of the valley: it
there produces some rye and barley, and the mountains are
clothed with verdure to their very summits. Beyond Scampf
the plain ends; and the river Inn, which had hitherto
winded in a gentle course, is contracted into a narrow chan∣nel,
and falls in continual cataracts. The road ascends and
descends along the sides of the mountains: and the country
is thickly overspread with woods of fir and pines.</P>
<P>I PASSED through several villages, similar to those I have
described in the preceding letter; and near Brail I crossed
a small bridge thrown over a precipice, and overlooking a
foaming cataract. This bridge is called in the language of
the country <HI>Pont Alta,</HI> or High Bridge, and forms the sepa∣ration
between Upper and Lower Engadina. Even if the
limits of the two districts had not been thus marked out, the
<PB N="208" REF="217"/>
sudden alteration of the road, for the worse, would have led
me to suspect that I had quitted Upper Engadina. The road
from the lake of Siglio to Pont Alta is like our turnpikes in
England, and sufficiently broad to contain two or three car∣riages
abreast; no common circumstance in these moun∣tainous
regions. It has been lately made, in consequence of
a proposal from the House of Austria, at the late treaty of
Milan, to improve the roads leading through the Pregalia
and the two Engadinas, in order that the merchandise to and
from Pregalia might be transported this way through the
Tyrol, instead of being carried, as it is at present, through
Coire.</P>
<P>THE House of Austria offered to defray the whole ex∣pence
of this undertaking. The inhabitants of Upper En∣gadina,
although they declined, with a spirit of disinterested∣ness
rarely to be found in democratical states, the offer of
indemnification, immediately carried the plan into execution
within their own territories; but the intrigues of the citizens
of Coire, whose interest would have greatly suffered by the
new arrangement, together with an inveterate persuasion,
that good roads would render the country too accessible to the
neighbouring powers, prevented the people of Pregalia and
Lower Engadina from co-operating in this useful project;
accordingly that part of this road, which runs through their
districts, remains in its original state. After crossing Pont Alta,
I passed along a wild and almost uninhabited tract of forest
until I reached Cernetz, where I am now comfortably lodged
in the house of Mr. Planta. That gentleman is at his govern∣ment
of Morbegno, in the Valteline; but having accidentally
<PB N="209" REF="218"/>
met me at Chiavenna, kindly gave me a letter of recommen∣dation
to his uncle, who would not permit me to continue
at the inn.</P>
<P>CERNETZ is situated in a small rich plain, bounded by
two ridges of mountains converging at both extremities.
This plain produces wheat, barley, rye, flax, and abundance
of rich pasture. I feel an essential difference between the
climate of this little plain and that of Upper Engadina; it is
much warmer, and has all its natural productions much
farther advanced towards maturity. Large quantities of
wood are felled upon these mountains, and floated down
the Inn as far as Inspruck. In this plain the Inn is joined
by the large torrent Spaelg, that descends from the moun∣tains
of Bormio. By the side of this torrent, and at the ex∣tremity
of a narrow pass leading to Bormio and Munster, I
observed a square tower, which in 1624 the Marquis de
Caeuvres garrisoned with a body of French and Grison troops,
in order to check the motions of the Austrian army posted
at Munster. The pass is still further fortified by a stone
wall, carried from the foot of an inaccessible rock to the
tower, and from thence to the torrent.</P>
<P>THE Marquis de Caeuvres, to whom the guard of this
important pass was committed, was son of the Marquis
d'Etrées; he was bred up to the church, and created bishop
of Noyon; but upon the death of his elder brother re∣nounced
the ecclesiastical line, and embraced the profession
of arms. He distinguished himself in several campaigns
under Henry the Fourth, and was afterwards employed in
<PB N="210" REF="219"/>
the reign of Louis the Thirteenth as embassador to Turin
and Rome. In 1624 he was appointed embassador extraor∣dinary
to the Republic of the Grisons, and commander in
chief of an army, composed of French and Swiss troops,
sent to the assistance of the Grisons during the war of the
Valteline. He penetrated through Coire into Lower En∣gadina,
and seized, without delay, the important pass just
now described; by this manoeuvre he secured the only
avenue by which he could open a passage to Bormio, the
reduction of which place was followed by an almost im∣mediate
submission of the Valteline. For these important
services the Marquis, on his return to France, was created
Duc d'Etrées, and raised to the highest honours. He died
in 1670, in the 102d year of age.</P>
<P>I EMPLOYED the greatest part of this morning in making
extracts from Campel's account of the Grisons, esteemed the
best topographical and political history of this country yet
extant. It consists of three large folio volumes, and is
written in Latin. It has never been printed, and is very
rarely met with. I had the good fortune to find a copy in
the library of Count Firmian, at Milan, who with that rea∣diness
to oblige, which peculiarly distinguished his cha∣racter,
permitted me to consult it. My stay at Milan being
very short, and employed in other researches, I had
not made so good an use of this indulgence as I could
have wished; and as I have now found the same work
in Mr. Planta's library, I embrace this opportunity of pe∣rusing
the most interesting parts: it has given me a great
insight into the geography, history, and governments of
<PB N="211" REF="220"/>
this country, which are treated with the most circumstan∣tial
accuracy.</P>
<P>HULDRIC CAMPEL, the author of this valuable work, was
born, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, at Suss,
in Lower Engadina, and made a most uncommon proficiency
in every species of literature. He was one of the earliest re∣formers
in this country, and became, by his active zeal, as
well as by his extensive erudition, a great instrument in
spreading the reformation through this district. An event
of small consequence which happened in his family gave
rise to the sudden and wide dissemination of the new doc∣trines,
and ended in the abolition of the Roman Catholic
religion.</P>
<P>WHILE he was absent, in 1537, upon the prosecution of
his studies, his wife was delivered of a daughter, which was
so sickly and weak, as to seem upon the point of expiring.
Gaspar Campel, father of Huldric, a man strongly attached to
the reformed doctrines, refused to have the child christened
by the Popish priest of the parish, nor would suffer even the
midwives to sprinkle it, according to the custom of the
Romish church, with holy water; and, as there was no
reformed minister at hand, he performed the ceremony of
baptism himself. This act was looked upon in so abominable
a light by the Roman Catholics of Suss, that they assembled
in a tumultuous manner, and attacked Gaspar with such
fury, that he narrowly escaped assassination. His enemies
then brought an accusation against him before the diet,
which at first referred the cause to arbitration; but no satis∣factory
<PB N="212" REF="221"/>
decision being obtained from this mode of proceed∣ing,
a public conference was ordered to be held in the church
of Suss, before deputies from the several communities, upon
the following question, “Whether, if a child is born and
likely to die before a priest can be sent for, the baptism per∣formed
by a layman was preferable to that by midwives?”</P>
<P>THIS ridiculous inquiry led to discussions of great
moment. The reformed ministers refused to acknowledge
any authority but that of the Holy Scriptures, while the
Catholics considered the writings of the fathers and decrees
of the church as infallible: each party, thus regarding every
point through a different medium, could never be prevailed
on to adopt the arguments of its antagonist; and the dispute
lasted seven days with little prospect of any satisfactory con∣clusion.
Fortunately, however, a system of accommodation,
which this endless mode of reasoning could never even dis∣tantly
promise, was summarily attained by the moderation of
the deputies. They decided, that in cases of extreme ne∣cessity,
where no priest was present, either a layman or the
midwives might baptise, and that the former was preferable
to the latter: but what was of the greatest consequence, they
inculcated this rational position, that in regard to the other
controverted points of faith debated in the course of the ar∣gument,
every person might safely hold that doctrine, which
from full conviction he was persuaded to be the word of
God. This conference was productive of the most beneficial
effects; for the people, who flocked thither in great num∣bers,
were taught to consider the Holy Scriptures as the
only authority in controverted questions. The tendency
<PB N="213" REF="222"/>
of this maxim was obvious: in fact it produced such im∣mediate
and rapid effects, that within the space of twenty
years the Reformation was completely established throughout
Engadina<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Excepting the small village of Samun.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO return to Huldric Campel: he not only approved his
father's conduct in the affair of his daughter's baptism, but
became a zealous proselyte to the new doctrines. Having
entered into holy orders, he undertook the care of a re∣formed
church in the valley of Pretigau, where he was in∣defatigable
in the performance of his duty, and the propa∣gation
of the Protestant religion. In 1550 he was drawn to
Suss by the friends of the Reformation, as a person the most
qualified to combat the Roman Catholic church. His labours
were attended with such success, that, a short time after his
appearance in his native place, mass was abolished, and the
Reformation publicly adopted. Nor was Suss the sole thea∣tre
of his exertions; at Cernetz, and several other places, the
persuasion of his eloquence, and the force of his arguments,
gained a numerous train of converts. He passed the decline
of his life at Schlins, where he was pastor, and persevered to
the last period of his existence in disseminating and defend∣ing
the doctrine of the reformed churches, as ably with his
eloquence as he recommended it by his example. Amidst
the occupation of religious duties, he found leisure to con∣tinue
his history of the Grisons to 1580. He died the fol∣lowing
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Some authors place his death in 1582.</NOTE> years at Schlins, in an extreme old age, leaving a
<PB N="214" REF="223"/>
name highly respectable in the religious and literary annals
of this country.</P>
<P>THE history of Campel consists of three volumes. The
first dwells chiefly on the topography of the Grisons, and
describes the different districts and towns: it likewise deli∣neates
the nature of the several governments, and the
various forms of civil and criminal jurisprudence in the
petty republics into which this country is subdivided. The
second volume comprises the history of Rhaetia, from the
earliest period to the Suabian war in 1499, under the emperor
Maximilian I. The materials are chiefly drawn from
Tschudi, Stumpf, and other Swiss historians. The third
volume, in which the history is brought down to his own
times, is the most interesting and authentic. Campel hav∣ing
submitted his work to the examination and correction of
Bullinger and Simler, presented, in 1577, a copy to the diet
of the three leagues, and received public thanks. But as
his own fortune was inadequate to the expences of publica∣tion,
and as no bookseller would undertake to print so volu∣minous
a work, it has never been given to the world.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Remus, <DATE>August 4th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE road from Cernetz to Scuol is a continual ascent and
descent, and so rocky and bad, that I employed above eight
hours in riding only twenty miles. The small plain of Cer∣netz
soon ends, and is succeeded by a rude assemblage of
rocks and forests. Suss is situated in a narrow pass between
the river Inn and a contiguous ridge of rocks a little beneath
the ruins of an old castle: close to it is a small fertile plain,
<PB N="215" REF="224"/>
which agreeably diversified the wildness of the rocks and
forests.</P>
<P>THE road to Ardetz follows the course of the Inn, which
murmurs below in a deep narrow channel, heard but not
seen. From Ardetz (over which hangs, upon a lofty rock, a
ruined castle called Steinberg) I descended along a very steep
craggy path to the river Inn, which I crossed, and mounted a
rapid ascent, leaving on my right hand the valley of
Scharla, in which there are silver mines belonging to the
House of Austria: they were formerly very rich, and yielded
a considerable advantage, but are now exhausted. I passed
through the straggling village of Trasp, and close to a castle
of the same name, situated upon the highest point of a per∣pendicular
rock. Count Dietrichstein, as lord of the castle,
is a prince of the German empire: it was given to his family
by the emperor Leopold, on condition that its possessor
should always vote in the diet of the empire for the House of
Austria. The formality of a garrison is maintained in this
castle by a single Austrian soldier. From Trasp I again
descended to the river, crossed it, and ascended to Scuol. I
arrived there very late, and set off early this morning.</P>
<P>FROM Scuol to Remus the mountains on the left slope
gradually, and are richly cultivated: they produce great
quantities of wheat, rye, barley, flax, and hemp: the trees
are chiefly pines, firs, and small birch, intermixed with
underwood of nut-trees and wild roses. The corn-fields are
raised in gradations (if I may so express myself) along the
sides of the hills, like the vineyards in the Pays de Vaud.
<PB N="216" REF="225"/>
The ridges of mountains on the right beyond the Inn are
steep, and in many places perpendicular, with few appear∣ances
of vegetation. It is now harvest time: I have ob∣served
several clergymen employed in reaping the corn.
The clergy are very poor in Lower Engadina, and are more
numerous than in any other part of the Grisons. The in∣come
of the richest benefices amounts to about £. 20 per an∣num;
that of the inferior cures to little more than £. 8; and this
scanty pittance is sometimes subdivided among two or three
clergymen, or as many as happen to be unprovided for in
the same parish. I stopped at Remus to bait my horses. Near
it is a ruined castle, which formerly belonged to the bishop
of Coire, and was given by one of the former bishops to the
Plantas of Zutz; in right of which donation they claim the
privilege of administering the oath to the Landamman of
Sotto Tasna. The only remains of this castle are two square
towers, in one of which is a miserable apartment, where Mr.
Planta gives an annual dinner to the Landamman.</P>
<P>THE form of government in Lower Engadina is more
complicated than that of Upper Engadina, and it has cost me
no small degree of pains to comprehend and unfold it. I
shall not, however, trouble you with a circumstantial account
of every particular which struck me in the course of this
investigation, but shall comprise my account in as short a
compass as possible.</P>
<P>LOWER ENGADINA is divided into three communities,
which send three deputies to the general diet. The first
community is composed of the parishes of Cernetz, Suss,
<PB N="217" REF="226"/>
Lavin, Guarda, and Ardetz: The second comprises Vettan,
Scuol, and Sent; and the third contains Remus, Schlins, and
Samun. The two former communities make one High
Jurisdiction; and the third forms, with Bevio, Valmorara,
and Avers, another High Jurisdiction. In civil causes there
are two separate courts of justice, one for that part of the
country which lies to the north, the other for the dis∣trict
to the south of the torrent Tasna; from which tor∣rent
the two parts are called Sopra and Sotto Tasna:
from each of these courts there lies an appeal, in the last
resort, to the civil tribunal of Sotto Fontana Merla, in Up∣per
Engadina, or to the neighbouring community of the
valley of Munster. In criminal causes there are likewise two
distinct courts, but without appeal, one for the tract to the
north of the mountain Falon, another for the region to the
south: according to this division the two parts are denomi∣nated
Sopra and Sotto Montfalon. By this complicated ar∣rangement
Vettan is connected with Scuol and Sent in po∣litical
concerns; in civil affairs with Scuol, Sent, Remus,
Schlins, and Samun; in criminal causes with Cernetz, and
the other towns of the first community. This intermixture
of various interests creates such an intricacy in the election
of deputies, magistrates, judges, both civil and criminal, as
would be uninteresting for me to detail, or for you to read.</P>
<P>ONE circumstance, however, cannot fail to strike the
most inattentive inquirer; that although the mode of elect∣ing
the judges is nearly the same with that of Upper Enga∣dina,
yet that justice is by no means so impartially adminis∣tered
as in the latter district. I cannot forbear ascribing this
<PB N="218" REF="227"/>
material difference in an affair of such importance to the dif∣ferent
condition of the two people; the inhabitants of
Upper Engadina, being more enlightened and affluent than
their neighbours, are less open to the influence of illiberal
prejudices and petty corruption.</P>
<P>PARTY runs very high both in Upper and Lower Enga∣dina:
there are some considerable families in these districts,
of which the principal are those of Desalis and Planta, both
subdivided into numerous collateral branches. The history
of this country is full of the disputes and struggles between
these rival houses, and presents in many periods little more
than an uniform picture of domestic feuds. The two parties
are distinguished by the appellations of <HI>Scarbonada,</HI> black;
and <HI>Alba,</HI> white; the former devoted to the Plantas, the lat∣ter
to the Desalises. At the time of elections for deputies
and magistrates the inhabitants of Lower Engadina seldom
abstain from blows, which not unfrequently terminate in
bloodshed.</P>
<P>I HAVE more than once had occasion to mention the su∣periority
of politeness which distinguishes the inhabitants
of Upper Engadina from those of the lower district. This
pre-eminence probably arises from the constant emigration
of the former into other countries, and their intercourse with
foreigners. I find also a great difference in the comforts of
life in the two districts. Although Lower Engadina pro∣duces
necessaries abundantly sufficient for interior consump∣tion,
yet the inhabitants are less industrious, and conse∣quently
poorer. In Upper Engadina I was always able to
<PB N="219" REF="228"/>
procure at the commonest inns fresh meat, good oil, and ex∣cellent
wine, none of which I could obtain in the lower dis∣trict.
The villages are less commodious, and the houses of
the peasants are also far inferior in cleanliness, neatness, and
convenience. This difference probably proceeds, in a cer∣tain
degree, from the nature of the country: Upper En∣gadina
yielding but few productions, the inhabitants are
obliged to seek from without some means of subsistence;
and industry once excited, brings with it its usual companion
opulence. On the contrary, the soil of Lower Engadina,
fertile in all the fruits of the earth, lays the inhabitants
under no necessity of extraordinary exertion, nor obliges
them to have recourse to foreign trade.</P>

<P>IN my way from Remus to St. Martin's bridge, being
overtaken by a violent storm of rain, I took shelter in a cot∣tage;
and was cheerfully received by a well-looking old
woman; my horse was put under a shed, and myself safely
housed from the pelting of the shower. The house was
perfectly neat and clean, with much better furniture and ac∣commodations
than I expected from the external appearance.
The old woman talked, (beside the Romansh) German and
Italian, and the latter remarkably well. The storm con∣tinuing
two hours without intermission, I held a long con∣versation
with her, and was greatly pleased with the polite
and ready manner with which she expressed herself upon
different topics. Upon taking leave, I made several apolo∣gies
for having dirtied her house, thanked her for her kind
<PB N="220" REF="229"/>
reception, and endeavouring to slip a piece of money into
her hand, was surprized at her declining to accept it.</P>
<P>ALL these circumstances inciting my curiosity to obtain
some intelligence concerning this old woman, I collected
the following account. She is a native of Lower Engadina,
of a good family, and formerly possessed a tolerable fortune:
she married, when very young, a nobleman of the first fa∣mily
of Milan, who came into Engadina, renounced the
Roman Catholic religion, and embraced the Protestant doc∣trines.
They lived for many years in the greatest harmony,
till having dissipated almost all her fortune, he one day took
leave of her, with a promise of returning in a short time.
From that moment she never saw him, nor heard from him,
and she was afterwards informed that he was gone to Italy,
and, having reimbraced the Roman Catholic religion, had
turned monk: upon receiving this information, his wife
collected the scan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y remains of her fortune, and retired to
the spot where I found her.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the extremity of Lower Engadina I crossed the
Inn over St. Martin's bridge, at a little village of the same
name: on the other side I came into Tyrol, where that river
struggles through a very narrow channel, between two
ridges of high and rugged rocks. I now took a farewel of
the Inn, which I had accompanied from its source. At St.
Martin's bridge it forms the separation of Engadina and the
Tyrol; on receiving the torrent Schargenbach, it quits the
territory of the Grisons, and passing through the Tyrol and
<PB N="221" REF="230"/>
the Electorate of Bavaria, joins the Danube at Passau with so
large a body of water, as to equal, if not surpass, the cele∣brated
river in which it loses its name. Hence Scheutzer
has laboured to prove, that the Danube may be said to rise
in the Rhetian Alps with more justness than in the moun∣tains
of Suabia, because the proportion of waters, which de∣scend
from the former, is greater than what is supplied from
the latter.</P>
<P>IN the village of St. Martin Romansh is spoken; on the
other side of the bridge just mentioned German is the
language of the country. From the steep banks of the Inn I
ascended a high mountain, along an excellent road, lately
formed at the expence of the emperor, in order to facilitate
the communication between Milan and the Tyrol. Having
enjoyed from the top a fine view of the Inn and Lower En∣gadina,
I descended to Nauders, and dined upon a cold fowl,
which Mr. Planta had ordered my servant to put up for me,
without which precaution I should have made but a scanty
meal.</P>
<P>FROM Nauders I went along a small pleasant valley,
bounded on the left by a ridge of mountains which separate
the Tyrol from Engadina. The valley is about a quarter
of a mile broad, and almost level: it is covered with rich
pasture, and watered by a lively torrent that falls into the
Inn. At the end of this valley I came to a gentle ascent, on
the other side of which there is a lake, which is one of the
first sources of the Adige; beyond this is another lake, and
<PB N="222" REF="231"/>
further on a third: the banks of these lakes are prettily
skirted with villages, at one of which I passed the night.</P>
<P>HAVING a long day's journey from thence to Bormio, I
set out at five this morning, and proceeded by the side of the
torrent which flows from the lakes and forms the Adige.
The country is agreeable, and in high cultivation, especially
where it opens into a rich and extensive view beyond Mals,
which town I passed at a little distance on my left hand, and
turned short into the road that leads to the valley of Munster.
At the bottom of the first ascent I went through Laitch,
which is subject in spiritual affairs to the bishop of Coire, in
temporal to the House of Austria. From thence I mounted
through a rich rising valley to Santa Maria. Tauven is the
last village in the Tyrol where the inhabitants speak Ger∣man.
A little beyond that place I passed the barrier, and
again entered the territory of the Grisons, where the Ro∣mansh
is the common tongue. At Munster is a monastery
for women, from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monasterium.</NOTE> which the name of the town and of the
valley is derived. It is very antient, and said to have been
founded by Charlemagne: I was not, however, permitted to
examine it, as it is against the rules of all nunneries to admit
a male visitant within the walls. I proceeded to Santa Maria,
from whence I am now writing.</P>
<P>THIS valley of Munster contains Santa Maria, Munster,
Valdera, Cierfs, and several other villages, which form a
community in the league of God's House. Formerly the
<PB N="223" REF="232"/>
bishop of Coire had considerable influence and power in the
government of the valley. Justice was administered in his
name, and he received the amercements for criminal offences;
but having violent disputes with the inhabitants, he sold
these rights in 1727 to the emperor Charles the Sixth: the
republic of the Grisons, however, objecting to this transfer
of immunities, which they considered as unalienable, the
bishop was obliged to re-purchase, and dispose of them to
the inhabitants, who are now perfectly independent. The
people are divided into Catholics and Protestants; the Catho∣lics
inhabiting the town of Munster, with its immediate de∣pendencies,
the Protestants the remainder of the valley: the
magistrates and judges are chosen equally from both parties,
who live together in tolerable harmony. The common
language is the Romansh, the same as spoken in Lower En∣gadina,
though not quite so pure, as, on account of its proxi∣mity
and connection with the Tyrol, it is blended with a
great number of German words.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 74.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PASSAGE OF MOUNT BRALIO—COUNTY AND TOWN
OF BORMIO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bormio, <DATE>August 7th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE passage from Santa Maria to this place was very
tedious, and would have been attended with some
danger had I been detained a day later; as the great quantity
of rain, which has poured down without intermission, would
have rendered the Alpine paths extremely slippery. I conti∣nued
to ascend two hours from Santa Maria to the top of
Mount Bralio, which separates the valley of Munster from
the county of Bormio. This body of Alps is supposed to be
the same which Tacitus mentions under the name of <HI>Juga
Rhaetica</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. lib. i.</NOTE>. Ascending the whole way by the side of the
torrent Ramo, the same which flows by Laitch, and falls into
the Adige<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Or rather two torrents form by their junction the Adige.</NOTE> below Mals, I traced it to its source, where it
rushes from a glacier, amidst an enclosure of surrounding
rocks. A few paces further, on the summit of the Bralio,
another torrent falls from the same glacier in a contrary di∣rection,
which forms the first source of the Adda.</P>
<P>FROM this point a descent commences, and continues,
with little interruption, to Bormio. The tops of these
<PB N="225" REF="234"/>
mountains produce no wood, but yield excellent pasture;
they were covered with cattle. The most elevated parts are
of granite, but not near so fine grained as that which is ob∣served
upon the St. Gothard, and some of the other Swiss
Alps. I then went down a very narrow rugged path, and
in an hour entered the county of Bormio, and a small plain
about a mile in length, in the midst of which is a single
house, that is termed an inn; and which is the first habita∣tion
I met with since I quitted the valley of Munster. There
was no one within but a woman and two children, who
spoke a corrupt Italian: the woman was greatly affronted on
my inquiring if she talked Romansh; being a Roman Catho∣lic,
she seemed to consider it as a kind of heresy to understand
that language.</P>
<P>I FOLLOWED the course of the Adda, which flows
through the plain; it is at first a small torrent, but gra∣dually
increases, by a continued accession of water from
the neighbouring mountains. At the end of this small plain
the descent recommences, and the track from thence to Bor∣mio
is as craggy as the highest parts of Switzerland. Since
my entrance into the country of the Grisons, I have not yet
met with such astonishing scenes of wildness, horror, and
majesty, as occurred in this day's journey. Description ge∣nerally
fails in representing the most ordinary exhibitions of
nature; how inadequate then must it be to the singular
combination of sublime objects, which I shall now attempt
to delineate?</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="235"/>
ON quitting the small plain I entered suddenly into a most
barren and desolate region; on my right hand huge piles of
misshapen Alps; on my left a large mass of ice and snow.
Close to the path the Adda foams from precipice to precipice
in broken cataracts; lower down it shoots over a succession
of natural steps, which seem as if they had been hewn in the
rock by art; at the distance of about a mile, it is contracted
in a narrow channel, through which it labours with inces∣sant
fury. Over this tremendous gulph is a slight wooden
bridge, which is partly supported upon a detached fragment
of rock, and partly suspended upon the sides of the oppo∣site
mountains: as we passed over, it tottered with our
weight. I then continued upon the edge of a deep abyss, the
Adda roaring beneath, though no where visible, suggesting
to my imagination cataracts more stupendous than any I had
hitherto seen. Its channel is cut perpendicularly in the
rock, which has evidently been hollowed to the depth of
some hundred feet by the attrition of the waters.</P>
<P>I NOW arrived at a barren spot, where the vale was entirely
closed by an impassable mountain: a stream bursts from a small
opening in the rock, and then expanding as it falls, forms a
considerable torrent, foaming amidst vast fragments of stone.
Having turned suddenly to the left, by an opening through
which the Adda seems to have forced a passage, I discovered
some fertile fields lying upon the side of a distant mountain,
which beautifully contrasted with the wild and uncultivated
scenes we had just quitted: a few paces further was the
prospect of a fertile plain extending to Bormio, the Adda
<PB N="227" REF="236"/>
flowing in a milder stream, which a moment before roared
underneath our feet, over broken precipices. In about
half an hour I reached the baths of St. Martin, in the valley
of Premaglia; they are formed by several hot springs which
rise near Molina, and are much frequented at this season of
the year. They are of the same nature with those of Bath,
but did not appear so hot. From thence I descended into
the plain, which produces some corn, and yields excellent
pasture, and in short time arrived at Bormio. Every thing
now wears an Italian look: the villages are very inferior to
those in the Grisons. The houses are plastered, and have a
dirty appearance; and it was no bad remark of my servant,
that the villages looked as if the inhabitants were mostly
dead, and the place deserted. This road over the Bralio, al∣though
so indifferent, was formerly the principal passage for
the merchandise sent from the Tyrol, through the Valteline,
into the Milanese: at present it is much less frequented.</P>
<P>THE county of Bormio, subject to the Grisons, lies at the
foot and in the midst of the Rhetian Alps, and borders upon
Engadina, the valley of Munster, the Valteline, Tyrol,
Trent, and the Venetian territories. It is entirely enclosed
within the mountains, except a narrow opening, which con∣nects
it with the Valteline: the other accesses to it lie across
the rugged Alps, and are similar to the passage over the Bra∣lio:
in winter they are frequently impassable. This county,
once a part of the Milanese, became subject to the Grisons in
1512: the concurrence of extraordinary circumstances, which
occasioned this revolution, will be related in the subsequent
<PB N="228" REF="237"/>
letter, upon the Valteline; for, as the Valteline came under
the dominion of the Grisons at the same period, and from
the same causes, the two histories are so intimately blended,
that they cannot be separated.</P>
<P>THE county is divided into five districts, 1. Bormio,
which comprises the capital, and several dependent villages.
2. The valley of Furba. 3. The valley of Pedinosa. 4. The
valley of Cepino. 5. The valley of Luvino. The inhabi∣tants
of the Luvino possess several privileges, particularly the
power of judging civil causes within a certain value. They
do not, however, appoint any of the magistrates, who are all
chosen from the four other districts. The county of Bormio
enjoys very ample immunities, some of which are not ex∣tended
to the Valteline, or Chiavenna; in virtue of which,
the inhabitants are exempted from the oppressions so wan∣tonly
exercised by the Grison governors in the other sub∣ject
countries.</P>
<P>1. THE inhabitants pay a fixed contribution to the Gri∣sons,
which is very moderate, and cannot be increased.
2. They collect and enjoy their own duties upon exports
and imports, which secures them from injudicious and op∣pressive
taxes. 3. The fines for criminal offences belong
to the community; a circumstance very friendly to the ad∣ministration
of justice: for no part of them being assigned
to the governor, as is the case in the other subject provinces,
he is not interested to convict criminals. 4. But the princi∣pal
privilege which distinguishes this country from the Val∣teline,
<PB N="229" REF="238"/>
is the freedom of its government, and the limitation
of the podesta's authority.</P>
<P>BORMIO, like all the other subject countries, is governed
by a supreme magistrate called <HI>Podestà,</HI> who is sent from the
Grisons, and continues two years in office: his authority is so
exceedingly circumscribed, that he enjoys scarcely any
power, but with the concurrence of the councils. He pre∣sides
in these councils without giving a vote, except in case
of equality; he has neither the power of arresting a crimi∣nal,
nor of pardoning or lessening the punishment; he re∣ceives
a yearly stipend from the country of about £. 80, arising
partly from a payment in money, partly from an allowance
of rye, and partly from the costs of suit in civil and criminal
causes. But the restrictions laid on his authority will best
appear from the following short sketch of the established
government.</P>
<P>THE supreme authority resides in the podesta and coun∣cils,
which consist in a civil and criminal tribunal, whose
members are annually chosen by the people. The criminal
court, or the council of Sixteen, who are changed every four
months, is composed of two regents, the treasurer, the no∣tary,
and sixteen counsellors, ten of whom are taken from
the town, and two from each of the vallies of Furba, Pedi∣nosa,
and Cepino: of these members only the sixteen
counsellors have any vote. At the request of the two re∣gents,
this council is convened by the podesta. In order to
arrest a criminal, the whole council ought to assemble, or at
<PB N="230" REF="239"/>
least seven of the members; but in any case of importance,
the podesta and two regents may give an order of arrest;
this, however, being contrary to law, must be referred to the
first meeting of the council, which, if satisfied, decrees in
the words of their code, <HI>Male captus; bene detentus;</HI> the ar∣rest
was illegal, but expedient. The process is formed, and
the prisoner examined by the podesta and two regents, who
lay the proceedings before the council. If the criminal is
convicted, and will not confess his crime, the majority of the
council decide whether the proofs are strong enough to
justify torture: when that horrid expedient is deemed
requisite, it must be applied in the presence of the podesta,
the two regents, the treasurer, and notary.</P>
<P>THE fines are paid to the community, which (should the
prisoner be insolvent) defrays the expence of the process.
If the proofs against the prisoner appear insufficient for his
conviction, the podesta and counsellors receive nothing for
their attendance: this regulation, which was designed to
prevent frivolous prosecutions, is productive of this ill effect,
that it induces the judges to strain the slightest circumstances
into proofs of guilt, and not unfrequently occasions the in∣fliction
of torture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Little more is wanting to the reformation of criminal jurisprudence in Bormio, than to render the examinations public; to pay the judges for their attendance, whether the prisoner is innocent or guilty; and to abolish torture.</NOTE>. The civil tribunal consists of twelve
members, taken from the town of Bormio, who determine
all civil causes in the first instance: from their decision there
lies an appeal to the syndicate of the Grisons.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="240"/>
THE members of these councils are chosen annually in
the following manner, by the assembly of the people, con∣sisting
of, 1. All those who have been magistrates; 2. Of
sixty persons from the town, nominated by the two chiefs
of the people; 3. Of sixty persons chosen equally by the
three vallies; 4. Of three deputies from the valley of Lu∣vino.
All these representatives assemble on the 15th of
June, in the town-hall of Bormio: the election is carried on
in the most democratical manner, upon a plan calculated to
prevent all influence; which, however, can never be entirely
excluded by the most complicated mode of election ever in∣vented.
Without enlarging upon the form of voting by
ballot used at Bormio, I shall, on account of its singularity,
only briefly describe the ceremony of choosing the two
regents. After the nomination of the counsellors, the
regent last in office points to some person in the assembly.
At the same instant the treasurer mentions some number,
as for instance, ten, fifteen, &amp;c. This number is imme∣diately
counted by the regent, beginning from the person to
whom he is pointing: the last six of the persons counted
retire into a separate room, and chuse six members of the as∣sembly,
namely, three from the district of Bormio, and three
from the valleys, who appoint six candidates. The names
of the latter are thrown into six bags, and ballotted for, and
the two, who have the greatest number of ballots, are re∣gents.
They remain in office only four months, in order to
prevent their abusing their power, which is very great.</P>
<P>THE expences of government are regulated with demo∣cratic
jealousy; and the accounts are annually submitted to
the inspection of each district, in the following manner:
<PB N="232" REF="241"/>
When the regents retire from office, the treasurer delivers
in a summary of the expences and receipts incurred during
their administration, which is read to the council of Sixteen,
and cannot pass without their approbation. In October the
council elects three examiners, two of whom are always
taken from the inhabitants of the town, and one reciprocally
from each of the three valleys. These examiners make a
report, which is laid before a deputation from the town and
the valleys on the 3d of May, and five copies are distributed
to the several deputies, for the inspection of their respective
constituents: lastly, the report is read before the assembly of
representatives, who meet for the election of the magistrates,
when it is either finally approved or rejected.</P>
<P>THE revenue of the country of Bormio, however trifling,
is nearly adequate to the current expences; it arises in the

<P>IN this calculation a few occasional expences are omitted,
which render the general outgoings greater than the re∣ceipts:
the overplus is supplied by equal assessments. For
the purpose of assessing, there is a perpetual committee, con∣sisting
of twelve members chosen from the town, and two
from each valley, which is convoked by the regents. The
sum required being laid before them, they fix the quota ac∣cording
to a calculation of property.</P>
<P>THE mountainous parts of this country produce only
pasturage and wood: the lower district about Bormio yields
corn, but not sufficient for domestic consumption. The in∣habitants
export cattle, a small quantity of cheese, and iron:
the iron is obtained from the mine of Freli, in the valley of
Pedinoso, worked at the expence, and for the profit, of a
private person, who pays to the community a small annual
rent. Wine is imported from the Valteline, corn from the
Tyrol, corn and rice from Milan, linen from Bergamo and
Appenzel, and cloth from Germany.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="243"/>
THE Roman Catholic is the established religion of this
country, and the exercise of every other worship is prohi∣bited:
even the podesta himself, if a Protestant, is not en∣titled
to any indulgence in this particular<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the causes of this prohibition, which takes place in all the provinces subject to the Grisons, see the next letter.</NOTE>. Spiritual af∣fairs
are under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Coire, who
has a vicar's court at Bormio, in which all ecclesiastical causes
are tried. The priests have peculiar privileges, which are
even extended to those who wear a clerical dress. Although
many abuses result from those exorbitant immunities, yet,
from the nature of the government, they are more restrained
here than in the Valteline. Most of the peasants possess a
small portion of land, and, in consequence of the freedom of
the government, are much happier than the people of the
Valteline and Chiavenna.</P>
<P>THE town of Bormio is not unpleasantly situated, at the
foot of the mountains, close to the torrent Fredolfo, which
falls at a small distance into the Adda. It contains about a
thousand inhabitants, but has a desolate appearance. The
houses are of stone plastered: a few make a tolerable figure
amidst many with paper windows; several, like the Italian
cottages, have only wooden window-shutters. This fashion
may not be uncomfortable in the mild climate of Italy, but
cannot be very agreeable in this country, subject to sud∣den
changes of weather, and occasionally cold even in the
midst of summer, when the bleak winds blow keenly from
the Alps.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="244"/>
THE landlord of the inn in which I am lodged is one of
the regents, and appears a man of great consequence. I sit
down to table with him, the podesta, and his wife. The
podesta has been lately appointed to this government, and
it appears, from the conversation which has passed, that he
is perfectly ignorant of the laws and constitution of this
country; in all my questions he refers me to my landlord,
who is thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice
of the courts of justice, and well versed in the most minute
circumstances, relative to the administration of affairs.</P>
<P>IT has rained all day without intermission, and the
showers in these Alpine countries pour down with such un∣common
violence, that I esteem myself very fortunate in
being well sheltered. The bad weather, however, did not
prevent me from seeing every thing which is worthy of at∣tention
in Bormio, and in paying several visits to the prin∣cipal
families of the town, who consider an Englishman in
this country, as a kind of phaenomenon, and shewed me
every attention and civility in their power. The Palazzo,
or town-house, contains a suite of wretched apartments for
the residence of the podesta, a chamber for the courts of
judicature, and an apartment where the representatives of
the people assemble. In one of the rooms is an engine of
torture, which, in defiance of common sense, as well as hu∣manity,
is still used in these countries to force confession.</P>
<P>BEING desirous of seeing the archives, I found it occa∣sioned
more trouble than I at first apprehended. The door
of the apartment, in which they are deposited, has several
<PB N="236" REF="245"/>
locks; and it was necessary for all the magistrates, who are
entrusted with the different keys, to be present at the same
time: no objection, however, was made to my admission,
and all parties readily assembled upon this occasion. The ar∣chives,
which are in the greatest disorder, contain many re∣cords
relating to the history and constitution of Bormio, the
criminal and civil statutes, and several charters from the so∣vereigns
of Milan, confirming original privileges and adding
others. The earliest of these acts is dated 1378, and signed
by John Galeazzo Visconti.</P>
<P>THE most important of the papers is the charter, by
which the Grisons confirm, in the most ample manner, the
immunities granted to this country by the dukes of Milan:
it was passed in the diet of Ilantz, under Paul, bishop of
Coire, in 1513, the year subsequent to that in which the
Grisons annexed Bormio to their dominions. Many circum∣stances
have concurred to deter the Grisons from infringing
this charter: the two principal causes are, the situation of
Bormio, and the spirit of freedom which distinguishes the
inhabitants. By its situation upon the confines of the
Tyrol, the people, in case of the least discontent, would re∣ceive
encouragement and assistance from the House of
Austria. This local advantage procured them, while under
the government of Milan, much better treatment than
was experienced by their neighbours in the Valteline;
and a similar reason still continues to operate upon the
conduct of the Grisons. The spirit of freedom also, which
pervades the constitution, has no less materially contributed
to the security of their privileges: these people have al∣ways
<PB N="237" REF="246"/>
watched with a jealous eye the slightest advances of en∣croachment;
and have never failed to remonstrate with great
unanimity and resolution, whenever the podesta has disco∣vered
the least inclination to exceed the bounds of his autho∣rity.
Hence the Grisons have uniformly acted towards
them with great moderation, and have ever paid the readiest
attention to their representations and remonstrances.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 75.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TIRANO—SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE
VALTELINE.</HEAD>
<P>Tirano.</P>
<P>I QUITTED Bormio this morning about ten. The torrents
are considerably swelled with the late rains; and the
sides of the neighbouring mountains are sprinkled with yes∣terday's
snow. From Bormio I passed along the narrow val∣ley
of Cepino, through several wretched villages, among
which not the least wretched is Cepino itself, consisting of a
few straggling cottages, many of which are in a ruinous
state. Having crossed the Adda, and continued on the left
shore of that torrent, which dashes with great violence
through a rocky country, in three hours I came to a pass
called La Serra, where almost the whole space between the
impending rocks, excepting a small path, is occupied by
the Adda.</P>
<P>THE path runs under the gateway of an ancient tower,
and leads from the county of Bormio into the Valteline.
At Sondalo, which stands on the banks of the river upon an
eminence, under a richly cultivated mountain, the valley
widens, and becomes more and more fertile: in some places
it is about a mile, in others scarcely a hundred yards in
breadth. Near Tirano the valley exhibits an appearance of
extraordinary fertility. The left ridge of mountains is
<PB N="239" REF="248"/>
chiefly overspread with hanging groves of chesnut-trees,
intermixed with a few vines; above them are meadows
and forest of fir. The ridge fronting the southern sun
is richly covered with vines, which reach almost to the
summit, studded occasionally with clusters of large trees:
on both sides churches and houses half concealed by the
foliage enliven the prospect. Below runs the Adda. The
plain on each side of its banks produces abundance of corn
and pasture, mulberries, walnuts, and other fruit-trees, and
vines carried over the corn and pasture in beautiful festoons
from tree to tree.</P>
<P>TIRANO is the capital of the Upper Terzero, and the re∣sidence
of the podesta. Although the town contains seve∣ral
handsome buildings, yet, on account of the narrowness of
the streets, and number of ruinous houses, its general ap∣pearance
is desolate. The Adda divides it into two parts,
which are joined by a stone bridge of a single arch. I ob∣served
remains of stone walls, with which this place was
formerly surrounded. These walls, together with an ad∣joining
fortress, were built by Ludovico Sforza, against the
incursions of the Grisons; but were dismantled by the Gri∣sons,
when they acquired possession of the Valteline.
Tirano carries on but little trade, except during the time of
the fair. The staple commerce of the town consists in the ex∣portation
of wine and silk; the former article, which is the
most considerable, is sent in large quantities into the country
of the Grisons, to Bormio, and into the territories of Venice.
The silk, which is drawn from this district of the Valteline,
is not of the best quality, nor very abundant: part is sent
<PB N="240" REF="249"/>
to Venice, and the remainder, through Chiavenna, to
Germany.</P>
<P>ABOUT half a mile from the town, on the other side of
the Adda, is the church of the Madonna, or the Virgin Mary,
much visited by the Catholic pilgrims. It is a large hand∣some
building, constructed with marble, and stone stuccoed.
Part of the church is ancient, bearing a date of 1206: the
carved ornaments in this part are grotesque, but by no means
badly finished. The modern building is in an elegant style of
architecture. The principal entrance is formed by two Co∣rinthian
pillars ornamented with foliage and festoons of
flowers, while the pilasters are neatly adorned with <HI>basso re∣lievos,</HI>
in the style of the antique. The aera of the work∣manship,
as might be collected from an inscription over the
door, was 1533. In the large area before the church is held,
in the month of October, the fair of Tirano, remarkable for
the number of cattle which are brought for sale: they are
fed upon the highest Alps, where they continue until the
snow begins to fall, and are chiefly sent from hence into
Italy. The fair continues three days, during which time
the authority of the podesta is suspended; and the governor
of the Valteline has absolute jurisdiction over the town and
district.</P>
<P>I CANNOT describe to you how much I am perplexed
with a variety of languages. I speak Italian or French with
the principal gentry, and sometimes am obliged to hold a
conversation in Latin; talk a smattering of German with my
servant, who understands no other language, and, with my
guide and the common people, a kind of corrupt Italian,
<PB N="241" REF="250"/>
like the Milanese; write my notes in English, and during
my progress through Engadina, was employed in collecting
a vocabulary of the Romansh. You must not therefore be
surprised, should you find in my letters a confusion of
tongues.</P>
<P>THE Valteline, called by the inhabitants <HI>Valle-Telina,</HI> ex∣tends
from the confines of Bormio to the lake of Chiavenna,
about the length of fifty miles. It is entirely enclosed
between two chains of high mountains; the northern chain
separates it from the Grisons, the southern from the Venetian
territories: on the east it borders on the county of Bormio,
and on the west on the dutchy of Milan.</P>
<P>THE Valteline, together with the counties of Chiavenna
and Bormio (which had long been the constant source of
hostility between the bishops of Como and Coire) came in
1336 under the dominion of Azzo Visconti, sovereign of
Milan, who quietly transmitted them to his successors.
Upon the death of John Visconti, one of Azzo's successors,
his extensive territories were divided between his nephews
Galeazzo and Barnabas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not mention Matthias, the eldest brother, because he died soon afterwards.</NOTE>. Upon the demise of Galeazzo,
his son John Galeazzo secured the person of his uncle Bar∣nabas,
and having confined him in the castle of Trevio
until his death, which happened in 1395, annexed his do∣minions
to his own, and became by this union the greatest
and most powerful prince in Italy. Mastino, son of Bar∣nabas,
took shelter, upon his father's imprisonment, with
Hartman, bishop of Coire, and died in exile, without re∣covering
<PB N="242" REF="251"/>
covering any share of his inheritance. Previous to his death
he formally ceded all his right and title over the Valteline,
Chiavenna, and Bormio, to the bishop of Coire, as a mark
of gratitude for his protection. To this cession, at that time
of no avail, the Grisons owe the possession of these provinces.
The claim lay dormant for above half a century, until some
discontents arising in the Valteline in 1487, the Grisons made
an irruption into that country, in support of the bishop's
right; but their arms not being at that time attended with
success, they purchased a peace, by renouncing all preten∣sions
to the Valteline. They renewed, however, their claim
in 1512, when Ludovico, called the Moor, Duke of Milan,
was taken prisoner by Lewis the Twelfth, and the whole Mi∣lanese,
comprising the Valteline, occupied by that monarch.</P>
<P>UPON this revolution, the Grisons, in conjunction with
the bishop of Coire, entered the Valteline, and, having ex∣pelled
the French troops, took possession of the country:
they were received with joy by the inhabitants, who did
homage to their new sovereigns, and in return obtained
from them the confirmation of all their privileges. A com∣promise
was immediately entered into between the bishop
of Coire and the three leagues, to share between them the
sovereignty of this country. In the following year Maxi∣milian
Sforza, raised to the ducal throne of Milan upon the
expulsion of the French, ceded in perpetuity the possession
of the Valteline, Chiavenna, and Bormio, to the bishop of
Coire, and the Grisons; and this cession was ratified by
Francis the First, in the treaty of peace which he concluded
with the Swiss and their allies the Grisons in 1516, when he
obtained possession of the Milanese.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="252"/>
IN 1530 the Republic of the Grisons acquired the whole
dominion of the Valteline, to the exclusion of the bishop of
Coire; under pretence, that the bishop had not furnished his
quota of men and money in the war with James of Medici,
in defence of these ceded countries: accordingly they com∣pelled
the bishop to sell his share of the sovereignty over the
Valteline, Chiavenna, and Bormio, for a yearly income of
573 florins, to be paid to the bishop and his successors out of
the customs of Chiavenna. From that period these provinces
were possessed by the Grisons without molestation, until the
rival interests of France and Spain, the intrigues of the pope,
religious enthusiasm, the zeal of party, and the exactions
of the Grison governors, kindled an insurrection, which com∣menced
with a general massacre of the Protestants, and
raged for a series of years with the most savage and un∣remitting
fury.</P>
<P>IN no country has the spirit of discord been more pre∣valent,
or religious disputes been carried to a greater height.
The zeal of contending factions has communicated itself to
the historians of these transactions; each of whom is evi∣dently
enlisted in a party, and gives different representations
of the same facts, according to the interests he has espoused.
Under these disadvantages, there is no other method of ar∣riving
at the truth, than by comparing contradictory ac∣counts,
and rendering them mutually subservient to the de∣tection
of each other's imposition; and I am concerned to
find, that on both sides religion has been pleaded as a sanction
to the most atrocious actions, and been alledged by one party
as an excuse for tyranny, and for rebellion by the other.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="253"/>
As the Valteline, Chiavenna, and Bormio, originally
belonged to the Milanese, the sovereigns of that dutchy
always looked upon the Grisons with a jealous eye, and
secretly embraced every opportunity to foment the intestine
disturbances with which they, in common with all demo∣cratical
states, are occasionally convulsed. Upon the ex∣tinction
of the family of Sforza in the person of Francis the
Second, the emperor Charles the Fifth seized the Milanese
as a fief reverting to the empire, and disregarding the claims
of the French king, gave the investiture to his own son
Philip. With the possession of the Milanese Philip succeeded
to his pretensions upon the Valteline; and although both
he and his successor, Philip the Third, entered into treaties of
alliance with the three leagues, by which they resigned all
claims to this country, yet their renunciation was never
sincere. They never finally relinquished all intention of
recovering a province which had been once dismembered
from the Milanese, and which the contests between France
and Spain rendered more valuable to them, than to their pre∣decessors
in the dutchy of Milan.</P>
<P>DURING the constant wars, which from the accession of
Philip the Second the restless ambition of the Spanish
court entailed upon Europe, the German and Spanish
branches of the House of Austria were inseparably united;
and the councils of Vienna were directed by the cabinet of
Madrid. Under these circumstances the Valteline, which,
by connecting the Tyrol and the Milanese, afforded the
only secure passage for the junction of the Austrian and
Spanish troops, became of signal importance. Hence the
<PB N="245" REF="254"/>
Spanish governors of Milan, highly solicitous to acquire in∣fluence
among the people, secretly fomented the spirit of
disaffection, which the conduct of the Grison governors had
too justly provoked; promised their assistance to the ag∣grieved
inhabitants, and gained by these means a powerful
party in favour of their court. The minds of the inha∣bitants
being thus gradually won over to the Spanish inte∣rest,
the Count of Fuentes, governor of Milan, ventured, in
defiance of the Grisons, to construct the fort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 68.</NOTE> which bears his
name, for the purpose of commanding the passage of the
Valteline. The same reasons which rendered the Spaniards
desirous to secure the Valteline, induced the French to
obstruct their designs. Henry the Fourth, with his usual
vigour, zealously espoused the cause of the Grisons, and was
preparing to send effectual assistance against the attempts of
Fuentes, when he was cut off by sudden assassination; and
the intestine troubles, which took place upon his death, for
a time totally withdrew the attention of France from this
quarter. The Spaniards, thus freed from their most for∣midable
rival, pursued their projects upon the Valteline with∣out
opposition, and availed themselves of the domestic dis∣sensions
between the Grisons and the inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE Grisons had long attempted to introduce the Re∣formation
into the Valteline with the most injudicious zeal,
and without paying sufficient attention to the prejudices of
a superstitious people. Churches for the worship of the
Reformed religion were constructed, and ministers regularly
settled with a permanent salary. Schools for Protestant
<PB N="246" REF="255"/>
children were established at Sondrio, notwithstanding the
remonstrances of the Romish priests, and the opposition of
the people. Many privileges of the Popish ecclesiastics were
taken from them; privileges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They were (as they are at present) independent of the civil authority for all delin∣quencies, and amenable only to the bishop of Coire.</NOTE>, which though exorbitant,
and repugnant to every principle of sound government,
were sanctified by usage, and could not at once be abolished
without exciting general discontent.</P>
<P>To these religious grounds of dissatisfaction were added
others, arising from the tyrannical proceedings of the Grison
governors, whom the advocates for rebellion painted, and it
is to be feared with too much justice, in the most odious
colours. “A system,” they cried, “of avarice and extortion
is established by law; the magistrates purchase their offices,
and indemnify themselves by the plunder of the country.
All things are venal; life, honour, and even conscience itself,
has a price. It is not possible for the governors to be more
iniquitous, nor for the people to suffer a greater complica∣tion
of calamity.” These well-grounded complaints were
aggravated, and the crisis of rebellion accelerated, by an act
of flagrant injustice. Many inhabitants of the Valteline
suspected of favouring the Spanish court, and particularly
those, who had opposed with the greatest zeal the introduc∣tion
of the Reformed doctrines, were arrested, and conveyed
into the country of the Grisons. Mock courts of justice
were established in several places, by which the prisoners
were fined to a large amount; and some were even wantonly
sentenced to the torture.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="256"/>
AMONG the sufferers was Nicholas Rusca, a priest of
Sondrio, who had gained the universal esteem of the Catho∣lics,
by his unremitted resistance to the Protestant doctrines,
and who, for the rigid austerity of his manners, was revered
by the multitude as a saint. The death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 80.</NOTE> of this person so
much respected, amidst the most excruciating torments,
raised a spirit of fury among the people too violent to be
appeased. The emissaries of Spain did not fail to increase the
general ferment, and to suggest the most plausible motives
for immediate insurrection. They represented, that, as the
Grisons were convulsed by factions, and France disturbed by
intestine commotions, a most favourable opportunity pre∣sented
itself to shake off the yoke under which they groaned:
animated by these suggestions, the inhabitants determined
to commence hostilities by a general massacre of the Pro∣testants.</P>
<P>THE 20th of July, 1620, was the day appointed for the
perpetration of this horrid design. At dead of night Ro∣bustelli,
the leader of the conspiracy, accompanied by about
a hundred followers, arrived at Tirano, and having assem∣bled
the chief Catholics of the place, laid before them the
intention of extirpating the Protestants: the dreadful pro∣posal
was embraced with all the zeal of resentment, inflamed
by fanaticism. At break of day the signal for the massacre
being given by ringing the bells; great part of the inhabi∣tants
issued from their houses, and repaired to the market∣place
with terror and anxiety. In this moment of per∣plexity
<PB N="248" REF="257"/>
the conspirators fell upon the Protestants, and en∣couraged
the people to follow their example, by destroying
the enemies of the Catholic faith. Few words being ne∣cessary
to exasperate an incensed and superstitious multitude;
every person seizing the first arms which presented them∣selves,
scoured the streets, stormed the houses, and assassi∣nated
the Protestants.</P>
<P>DURING this dreadful scene, the podesta, his family, and
some of the principal Protestants took refuge in the town∣house,
and barricadoed the doors: the Catholics, however,
soon forced a passage, and burst into the apartments where
the fugitives were collected. Their fury was for a moment
suspended, at the affecting sight of the podesta and his wife
upon their knees, presenting their infant children with up∣lifted
arms. But such was the implacable barbarity of the en∣raged
multitude, who demanded with repeated instances the
death of the podesta and his family, that this short respite
was of no avail, and only served to embitter their fate: they
were first imprisoned, and then put to death, without distinc∣tion
of sex or age.</P>
<P>THE next scene of the massacre was exhibited at Teglio,
whither some of the conspirators were dispatched from
Tirano: they were dressed in red, as a signal to the inhabi∣tants
that the rising at Tirano had succeeded. The Catho∣lics
soon collected themselves into a body, and repaired to
the church, where the Protestants were assembled for the ce∣lebration
of divine service. One of them levelled his piece
against the minister, who was preaching; but missing his
<PB N="249" REF="258"/>
aim, the Protestants rose up, drove out the Catholics, and
barricadoed the doors. The assassins then climbed up to
the windows, and shot from the outside upon the crouded
audience; the doors at length being burst open, all the
Protestants were put to the sword, excepting those who re∣nounced
their religion.</P>
<P>ANOTHER party of Catholics made their way towards
Sondrio, where the governor of the Valteline resided. That
magistrate, being apprised of their design, ordered the
inhabitants to take arms, and summoned the people of the
neighbouring district to his assistance: in obedience to this
injunction, both Protestants and Catholics began to assemble,
but the former were intercepted, and destroyed. Some at∣tempting
to escape towards Engadina and Pregalia were
overtaken in their flight, and involved in the common ruin.
Even the women laid aside the natural softness of their sex,
and, hardened by superstition, practised every species of out∣rage
upon the bodies of the deceased. Mean while the
Catholic troops entered Sondrio, and exciting their partisans
with the cry of “<HI>Down with the enemies of the Catholic faith!</HI>”
made a general slaughter of the unhappy Protestants.
Mercy, however, was extended to the governor and his
family, in a manner which does honour to the chiefs of the
revolt who conducted the attack of Sondrio. He was first
imprisoned, but afterwards, in consideration that he had al∣ways
treated the Catholics with mildness, was dismissed with
his family, and escorted in safety to the confines of the
Valteline.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="259"/>
IT would be shocking to humanity to enumerate all the
particulars of this savage massacre, or to trace its devastation
in the several towns of the Valteline. It continued, without
intermission, for three successive days; nor were its horrid
effects confined merely to those who were assassinated upon
the spot. Many who had escaped into the country were
hunted down like wild beasts; others, after eluding the fury
of their pursuers, were consumed by hunger and fatigue;
and numerous dead bodies were discovered in the woods,
caverns, and torrents. Several Catholics, who were allied
to the Protestants, shared in the general disaster; even women
and infants were slain in the most deliberate manner. Some
Protestants saved their lives by abjuring their religion, and
many, who refused to purchase their safety by this con∣cession,
were burnt alive. In the midst of this dreadful
carnage, one instance of singular humanity deserves to be
recorded. Bartholemeo Peretti, the principal Catholic at
Berbeno, being exhorted to put all the Protestants of that
town to death, apprised them of their danger, and assisted
them in effecting an escape. But this act of clemency was
the occasion of his own destruction, and he was executed as
an enemy to religion. All the Protestants being either de∣stroyed
or driven out of the country, the remaining inhabi∣tants
renounced their allegiance to the Grisons, and framing a
new form of government, threw themselves under the protec∣tion
of the king of Spain, who sent an army to their sup∣port.
The people of Bormio followed the example of the
Valteline, with this difference, that they did not massacre,
but only expelled the Protestants. Having entered into an
offensive and defensive alliance with the inhabitants of this
<PB N="251" REF="260"/>
valley, they also erected themselves into an independent com∣monwealth.</P>
<P>THE Grisons, divided among themselves, were totally un∣equal
to the chastisement of their revolted subjects. The
Catholics were desirous of employing the mediation of Spain,
for the purpose of recovering the Valteline; the Protestants,
inclined to vigorous measures, proposed an application to
the Swiss cantons, Venice, and France. After violent dis∣sensions,
which were not terminated without bloodshed, the
Protestant interest prevailed, and a deputation was sent to
the powers above-mentioned.</P>
<P>ZURIC and Berne instantly dispatched a body of troops,
while the Catholic cantons refused to act against those of the
same persuasion with themselves. Venice, alarmed at the
growing power of the House of Austria, and desirous of a
passage through the Valteline, gave a flattering answer to the
request of the Grisons, but, with a spirit of delay natural to a
republic, deferred sending any actual succour. France too,
having just emerged from a civil war, was more disposed to ne∣gociate
than to act with decision. Bassompiere was dispatched
to Madrid to solicit the restitution of the Valteline; and al∣though
a league was concluded between the king of France,
the duke of Savoy, and the republic of Venice, to assist the
Grisons unless the Valteline was restored; yet all that could
be obtained from the Spaniards was, that the forts of the
valley should be placed in the hands of the pope: but as the
pope was a secret partisan of the House of Austria, and in∣clined
to favour the rebellion of the Valteline, it was evi∣dent
<PB N="252" REF="261"/>
that he would restore the forts to the Spaniards upon the
first opportunity. In this interval the united troops of the
Grisons, Zuric, and Berne, being defeated with great
slaughter; the Valteline seemed upon the point of being for
ever dismembered from the Grisons, when the French court
suddenly changed its plan of operation, entered into the war
with a zeal as sincere as it was politic, and vigorously inter∣posed
in behalf of the Grisons.</P>
<P>THIS revolution in the French politics was owing to the
ascendancy of Cardinal Richelieu, who no sooner began to
preside in the cabinet, than the kingdom seemed to awake
from that deep lethargy, into which it had sunk during the
feeble administrations of Ancres and Luynes. That great
minister instantly perceived the importance of the Valteline;
without wasting a moment in deliberation, he demanded an
immediate restitution of that country, and enforced this
demand by sending a detachment of troops to the assistance
of the Grisons, under the command of the marquis de
Couvres. The general, animated with the spirit of the new
minister, penetrated into these parts; joined his army to the
Swiss and Grisons, and in two campaigns drove the Spa∣niards
from the Valteline, Chiavenna, and Bormio. The
two latter provinces were immediately restored; but when
the Grison deputies repaired to the French general at Sondrio,
to demand the cession of the Valteline, Couvres proposed,
that the exercise of the Protestant religion should be abo∣lished
throughout the valley; that the inhabitants should
appoint their own magistrates, and pay a yearly tribute of
20, 000 crowns; and he shewed himself so strongly inclined
<PB N="253" REF="262"/>
to circumscribe the authority of the Grisons over the inhabi∣tants
of the Valteline, that he was suspected of being bribed
by the latter. But it soon appeared, that this conduct was
occasioned by directions from his court, and proceeded from
a reconciliation, which, unknown to the Grisons, had taken
place between the kings of France and Spain.</P>
<P>RICHELIEU, the soul of the French monarchy, having
now brought to maturity his project for subjugating the Hu∣gonots,
was too great a politician to be embarrassed with a
foreign war at the eve of a civil commotion; and well aware,
that he could not maintain possession of the Valteline without
an expence of troops, which he could ill spare, temporised
for the moment, and made overtures to Philip the Fourth.
Philip, harrassed by the long continuance of hostilities,
seemed equally desirous of an accommodation: accordingly
preliminaries of a new treaty were immediately adjusted by
the contracting powers, at Mosson in Arragon. It was
agreed that the Valteline should again be restored to the
Grisons under the following conditions: that no other re∣ligion
but the Roman Catholic should be tolerated; that
the inhabitants should elect their own governors and magis∣trates,
either from themselves or from the Grisons, but always
from persons of the Roman Catholic persuasion; that the
governors should be confirmed by the Grisons. In return
for these privileges, it was stipulated that the inhabitants
should pay an annual tribute, the amount of which was to
be settled by mediation. In consequence of this treaty,
concluded on the 5th of March, 1626, the French resigned
<PB N="254" REF="263"/>
the forts of the Valteline into the hands of the pope, and
evacuated the country.</P>
<P>IN conformity to this alliance, the inhabitants having
elected Robustelli, who began the massacre, for their gover∣nor,
and appointed twelve magistrates, sent a deputation to
Coire to demand the confirmation of the Grisons. The
Grisons, however, were by no means disposed to accede to a
treaty so destructive to the rights of sovereignty, which they
possessed over the Valteline. Openly excited by the Repub∣lic
of Venice, and secretly encouraged by the French minis∣ter,
they refused to acknowledge the treaty of Mosson. But
as they were not in a state to support their claims upon the
Valteline by force of arms, they could only remonstrate and
negociate, without producing any immediate effect.</P>
<P>AFFAIRS continued in this state for three years; until
Richelieu, having completed the reduction of the Hugonots
by the taking of Rochelle, found himself in a situation to
turn the whole force of France against the House of Austria;
the diminution of whose power he had long meditated. He
now threw off the mask: the dominions of the House of
Austria were invaded on all sides, and every part of Europe
became the theatre of his vast designs. Among other enter∣prises,
the Valteline engaged no inconsiderable share of his
attention. The duke of Rohan was dispatched to the
Grisons with a formidable army, and having worsted the
Spanish troops in various encounters, dispossessed them of
the Valteline.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="264"/>
UPON this decisive success, the French abated much of
their solicitude for the interests of the Grisons; and although
they began the war with a positive demand of an uncondi∣tional
restitution of the Valteline, yet they were no sooner
in possession of the country, than they again professed, as on
the former conquest, a great tenderness for the privileges of
the inhabitants. They refused to surrender their acquisition
to the Grisons, unless upon terms more favourable to the
people than had been offered even by the treaty of Mosson.
The Grisons having no prospect of assistance from any other
quarter, found themselves under a necessity of acceding to
these humiliating stipulations. The French, with a view
probably of retaining the Valteline in their own hands, con∣tinued
to delay its restitution, and clogged every subsequent
negociation for that purpose with conditions still more un∣favourable.</P>
<P>THE Spaniards, artfully availing themselves of these cir∣cumstances,
held out of the Grisons the most flattering over∣tures
of accommodation. Encouraged by these well-timed
offers, and incensed at the repeated instances of duplicity
they had lately experienced, the Grisons rose up in arms,
and drove the French from the Valteline. The treaty of
Milan was the consequence of this revolution; a close
alliance was concluded between the Spaniards and the Gri∣sons;
and the Valteline was restored, under the guarantie of
that very power, which had originally excited the inhabi∣tants
to revolt. This treaty, contracted in the year 1635,
secured to the Spaniards the passage of the valley, which
<PB N="256" REF="265"/>
had been the great object of the war, and restored the Val∣teline,
Chiavenna, and Bormio, to the Grisons, under the
following articles: An act of oblivion; the immunities of
the subject countries to be confirmed as they existed before
the revolution of 1620; no other religion but the Catholic to
be tolerated therein; no person of any other pesuasion to be
permitted to reside, excepting the governors, during the
two years they should continue in office, and the Protestants
possessed of lands, who should not be allowed to remain in
the country above three months in the year; the privileges
of the ecclesiastics to be restored in their full latitude.</P>
<P>A FEW alterations were made in the government of the
Valley, and some regulations introduced, for the purpose of
stemming the torrent of injustice and corruption, that
prevailed in the courts of justice before the revolution: they
consisted chiefly in a new method of nominating the gover∣nors,
and in the creation of the office of assessor. The ar∣ticles
were guarantied by Spain, and inserted in the capi∣tulation,
or treaty, ratified in 1639, at Milan, in the presence
of the deputies from the Valteline.</P>
<P>THE deputies reproached the Spaniards, for having sum∣moned
them to Milan, in order to be present, in silence and
with tears, at the subversion of their liberty; and when the
treaty was announced to the inhabitants of the Valteline, a
general despair spread itself through all ranks. The people
universally lamented that they had been deluded into a revolt
under a promise of protection; that they had expended,
<PB N="257" REF="266"/>
during this fatal war, above twenty-five millions of florins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Near £. 2, 000, 000 sterling.</NOTE>,
for no other purpose than to procure an alliance between
Spain and the Grisons, and to be restored to their original
masters, exasperated by their revolt, and preparing to renew
the former acts of injustice and tyranny which had driven
them to rebellion. Nor were these murmurs ill-grounded;
for, except the total exclusion of the Protestant religion, no
material alteration was made in the fate of this valley. Since
this treaty the laws have been no less perverted than before,
the exactions of the governors have continued as exorbitant,
and the courts of justice as iniquitous and corrupt. The
change in the administration of justice has proved no alle∣viation;
the creation fo the assessor's office served only to
give the sanction of law to the most iniquitous proceedings,
or to vary the mode of oppression. This innovation has
been moreover attended with this bad effect to the bulk of
the inhabitants, that whereas, before the rebellion, the
nobles were principally subject to the rapacity of the Grison
judges; since the pacification, the people have become
more exposed to exactions.</P>
<P>I HAVE thus brought down the history of the Valteline
to the pacification of 1637. Since that period no material
change has taken place in the situation of affairs. The so∣vereigns
of Milan have always cultivated the friendship of
the Grisons; and the inhabitants of this valley, having no
power to resort to for protection, have endured a regular
course of oppression under the government of a free state.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 76.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOVERNMENT OF THE VALTELINE.</HEAD>
<P>THE geographical division of the Valteline is into three
principal districts, and the political into five govern∣ments.
The three districts are, 1. <HI>Terzero di Sopra,</HI> or the
Upper District. 2. <HI>Terzero di Mezzo,</HI> or the Middle District.
3. <HI>Terzero di Sotto,</HI> or the Lower District. The five govern∣ments
are, 1. Of the Upper District. 2. Of the Middle Dis∣trict,
called also the Government of Sondrio. 3. Of Teglio.
4. Of Morbegno. 5. Of Traona.</P>
<P>EACH of these five governments is subject to a magistrate
appointed by the Grisons, who is changed every two years.
The magistrate over the Middle District is called <HI>governor</HI> of
the Valteline, and possesses in some respect a superior degree
of authority to the others, who are styled <HI>podestas.</HI> He is also
captain general of the Valteline.</P>
<P>BUT before I proceed to explain the form of government,
it may be necessary to lay before you the method of electing
the governor and podestas, to whom the Grisons delegate
their authority over the Valteline. In the year 1602, the
venality and injustice of these magistrates had arisen to such
an excessive height, that some remedy seemed absolutely
necessary. The cause of this injustice was evidently derived
<PB N="259" REF="268"/>
from the public sale of the governments, and the share of the
fines for criminal offences, which were partly appropriated to
the Grisons, and partly to the governors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is necessary to apprise the reader, that when I use the word <HI>governor</HI> simply, I ap∣ply it indiscriminately to the governor of the Valteline and the four podestas.</NOTE>. In order to pre∣vent
corruption in the distribution of the offices, and exac∣tion
in the governors, two important changes were made.
Instead of one person being appointed to fill the vacant
office, four candidates were nominated by the community,
to whom the turn of election belonged, and these four drew
lots for the charge. But this alteration would have been at∣tended
with few beneficial effects, if it had not been followed
by another, namely, that the stipend of the governors should
be tripled, and that they should have no share in the fines:
yet these salutary regulations, as they prevented the Grisons
from selling the governments at so high a price, were a few
years afterwards abolished by the diet. In order, however,
to preserve some appearances of impartiality in the choice
of the magistrates, it was stipulated in the treaty of Milan,
that three candidates should be nominated by the community
to whom the election belongs, and that one of these should
be appointed by the diet. Yet this mode is a mere for∣mality:
three are always presented; but the diet never fails
to nominate the person recommended by the community.
These magistracies are allowed to be openly purchased: in
general, part of the money is assigned to the public fund of
the community, and the remainder is distributed among the
body of the people, in whom the right of election is vested,
and whose votes are seldom obtained without additional
<PB N="260" REF="269"/>
bribes. It will easily be imagined what a dreadful scene of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>All authors, both natives and foreign∣ers, who have written upon the Grisons, have not failed to enumerate the ill effects resulting from this sale of governments, which is authorised by law; but none have expressed their disapprobation in stronger terms than Fortunatus Juvalta, in the fol∣lowing passage, from a manuscript account of the Grisons:</P>
<P>Qui ad honores et praesertim and quaestuo∣sas illus praesecturas aspirabant, non aliter quam ambitu et largitionibus voti compotes sierent. Omnia enim venalia prostabant, non <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>us ac aliae merces.</P>

Emtores isti emebant, ut carius vende∣rent, ideoque ubi spes aliqua lucri affulgebat, merces suas venales exponebant, et plus offeren∣tibus addicebant.</P></NOTE> corruption is opened by this mode of proceeding; and how
frequently persons are appointed to the governments, who
are totally inadequate to the discharge of their trust.</P>
<P>THESE magistrates, as representatives of the sovereign
state, enjoy the supreme authority, and are entrusted with
the power of life and death; and if they are apparently con∣trolled
by the laws, they devise means to evade them. But
their authority will be best understood from a detail of
the civil and criminal courts of justice established in this
country.</P>
<P>THE criminal tribunal is composed of the governor, vicar,
and assessor. The governor arrests, imprisons, and examines
the delinquent: though, according to the letter of the law,
no examination ought to be made but in the presence of the
vicar and assessor. The criminal being convicted, and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entence passed, the governor enjoys the power of remitting
<PB N="261" REF="270"/>
or diminishing the punishment, excepting in cases of high
treason, premeditated murder, or such enormous crimes.
He has a small annual stipend paid by the Valteline, but
the chief part of his income is derived from the fines for
criminal offences, of which he receives two-thirds. In all
trials he is bound to follow the penal statutes, which are
drawn up with great precision and clearness.</P>
<P>THE vicar is always a Grison; and he is chosen by rota∣tion
from the several communities, in the following man∣ner:
Three candidates are presented to the inhabitants of
the Valteline, who appoint one of them to the vacant office.
This mode was adopted in the treaty of 1639, in order to
check corruption, but it has not been attended with the de∣sired
effect. The community, in whose turn it is to elect the
three candidates, leaves to the person who has purchased the
office the power of nominating his two associates; and the
diet, in delivering in the three names, recommends the per∣son
who had been previously designed by the community,
and this recommendation is always accepted by the Valteline.
The vicar ought to attend in person all trials when the go∣vernor
examines the prisoners; but this custom is now
fallen into difuse, and in lieu of his attendance, he receives an
annual sum of 1127 Grison florins, about £. 83, from the
governor of the Valteline and each of the four podestas:
a shameful elusion, as the vicar was designed to be a kind of
counsel in favour of the prisoner, and to prevent injustice
in the mode of examination. When the prisoner is con∣victed,
an account of the process is laid before the vicar,
who must confirm the sentence. Torture, for the purpose
<PB N="262" REF="271"/>
or forcing confession, cannot be inflicted without his consent,
and in his presence, which is never dispensed with. Besides
a small salary, and the above-mentioned annual sum of 1127
florins, as a premium for not attending at the trials, he has a
stated allowance, as well for every consultation, as for every
time that he is present at the infliction of torture.</P>
<P>THE assessor must be an inhabitant of the Valteline: he is
nominated by the vicar from three candidates, chosen reci∣procally
from each of the three Terzeros. His vote is ne∣cessary
to concur with the vicar in ordering torture: he must
also attend when it is applied, and must confirm the sentence
passed against the convicted persons. He has no regular
salary, but his profits depend upon the number of processes
in which he is consulted. This is the only office which gives
to the inhabitants of the Valteline any share in the criminal
jurisprudence. The assessor, according to the original inten∣tion
of the statutes, ought to be a person well versed in the
laws of the country, and should be considered as an advocate
for the accused; but as he is obliged to the vicar for his no∣mination
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Usually the assessor either pays the vicar for his appointment, or else delivers him all his regular sees of office.</NOTE>, he is commonly his creature, and seldom gives
his vote in opposition to him. Nor indeed is it yet a decided
point, whether the concurrence of the assessor is absolutely
necessary for passing a definitive sentence. The case is with∣out
precedent, but was once very near being brought to a
decision. The assessor differed from the opinion of the go∣vernor
and vicar, and refused to give his concurrence for the
<PB N="263" REF="272"/>
conviction and punishment of a criminal. In this dilemma
the affair was referred successively to the two other can∣didates
for the assessorship, who had been presented to the
vicar for his nomination. Notwithstanding they agreed
with the assessor, it was still disputed whether the assessor, as
a servant of the vicar, could act in direct opposition to his
opinion, and prevail against him. The case was so extraor∣dinary,
that it was proposed to appeal to the diet; but some
of the chief nobles of the Valteline, concluding, that the Gri∣sons
would decide in favour of their own representatives, in∣duced
the vicar to drop the appeal; and the affair was com∣promised
without coming to a decision.</P>
<P>SUCH is the general theory of the criminal jurisprudence
in this country, by which it appears that the power of the
governor is limited as well by the strict letter of the law, as
by the interference of the vicar and assessor, whose concur∣rence
is necessary for passing a final sentence. But this li∣mitation
exists only in theory; for the laws are easily eluded,
and even made subservient to the conviction of the innocent
as well as the guilty. The vicar and assessor, be they ever so
upright, can hardly prevent the oppression of the judges;
and if they are themselves rapacious, they receive their share
of the plunder, by conniving at the governor's injustice.</P>
<P>HAVING gained some insight into the practice of the
courts of justice, I shall lay before you the general mode of
proceeding, from arresting the criminal to his final sentence,
interspersing the account with occasional remarks, which
<PB N="264" REF="273"/>
will serve to shew the abuses introduced into the admini∣stration
of justice.</P>
<P>THE governor sends out the order of arrest, and commits
the criminal to prison. He detains him in confinement as
long as he pleases, delaying or hastening the inquiry as he
thinks fit. The examination is secret, no one being present
but the governor, or his substitute, and the notary, who
writes down the process. It must be evident to all, with how
much ease persons versed in the arts of chicanery can brow∣beat
the ignorant, and perplex the prisoners, who are
allowed no counsel. When the criminal is found guilty,
whatever is his crime, he may make a composition with the
governor, before the case is referred to the vicar; or, in
other words, as the examination is secret, the governor can
dress out the process in the most favourable manner, and
may give what explanation to the affair he pleases.</P>
<P>IF no composition is made, the case is laid before the
vicar and the assessor, who are obliged to give their vote
according to the letter of the law; and as the statutes are
very severe, the penalties are either heavy fines or corporal
punishment. In the former circumstance, the governor re∣ceives
two-thirds of the fine; and, as in the latter, he has the
power of remitting the punishment, excepting for the most
atrocious crimes, he generally accepts a commutation in
money, if the prisoner is able to pay it. By these means
most offences may be easily compounded for; a circumstance
which empowers the rich to commit crimes with impunity.
It is, however, a matter of little consequence to the governor
<PB N="265" REF="274"/>
whether the prisoner is rich or poor: in the first instance he
may receive a composition from the prisoner himself, in the
latter from the parish. For, in case the punishment for
the crime is corporal, the expences attending it are consider∣able,
as the executioner of Coire must inflict it; for which
reason the governor generally remits the penalty, and re∣ceives
from the parish a composition in money, somewhat
less than the expences of inflicting corporal punishment
would have been attended with.</P>
<P>WE may add to the list of grievances abovementioned,
the power possessed by the magistrates of delegating their au∣thority
without residing in the government. If the delegate
is a Grison, he is called <HI>Assistente,</HI> if an inhabitant of the Val∣teline,
<HI>Tenente.</HI> He either purchases the fines and perquisites
upon a calculation of their average value, or is responsible
for them to the governor. In some places the delegation is
almost always bought by the same person, who resides upon
the spot, and becomes as it were a perpetual judge. In
others a society of persons join to purchase the profits of
the magistracy; they appoint the nominal delegate, and
secretly direct the processes. Such a delegation may be
called a settled tyranny, and according to the expression of
an elegant author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eden's Principles of Penal Law, p. 61.</NOTE>, “<HI>establishes a wholesale traffic between
criminals and courts of justice.</HI>”</P>
<P>FROM this general view of the criminal jurisprudence of
the Valteline, we may readily infer the wretched situation of
<PB N="266" REF="275"/>
the inhabitants; where the supreme magistrate purchases a
temporary office at an exorbitant price, and has an inadequate
salary; where the principal profits of his charge arise from
the fines for criminal offences; where it is his interest to
arraign and to convict; and where he is himself the interpre∣ter
of the laws, of which he is commonly ignorant, the ac∣cuser
of the party, and the judge.</P>
<P>I HAVE already mentioned the power which the governor
enjoys of pardoning all offences except the most atrocious
crimes. A pardon of this sort is called <HI>liberatione;</HI> and there
are printed papers that contain its form, in which blank
spaces are left for the name of the person, for the crime
committed, for the date, and for the signature of the judge.
I enclose a copy of a liberation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following is the form of a liberation:
<Q>Podestà Regente della Giurisdizione di Tirano,

<P>Dat. in Tirano dal Pretorio questo giorno anno</P></NOTE>: it brings to my recol∣lection
those acts of indulgence, which the Catholics obtain
<PB N="267" REF="276"/>
from Rome for the absolution of their sins: with this differ∣ence,
that the latter refers to a future state, the former
to this life. The price of these pardons varies according to
the magnitude of the crime, the condition of the person who
committed it, and more particularly the time in which it is
granted; for the sum is greater when a governor first enters
upon his office, than when he is retiring from it. Some∣times,
during the last two or three hours previous to the
expiration of the office, pardons may be procured at the
lowest rate; and I was assured from very good authority,
that a liberation for homicide has not unfrequently been
obtained for about four-pence.</P>
<P>Do not suppose that this account of the venality which
reigns throughout the Valteline is heightened, for I have
taken great pains to ascertain the truth, and it has been
confirmed to me by persons of all ranks, both in the Grison
and subject countries. Nor will you be led to imagine that
all the governors are equally rapacious and unjust. Like the
Roman proconsuls, some carry their rapine to the height,
others are less exacting, and a few are free even from the
most distant imputation of injustice.</P>
<P>THE civil courts of justice remain to be considered. Al∣though
the governor presides in these courts and passes
sentence, yet by a singular privilege the cause is not always
lest to his absolute decision. He examines the witnesses, and
makes out the process; but, at the request of either party,
the cause may be referred to an arbitrator, who is called
<HI>Savio.</HI> He is either nominated by the plaintiff and desen∣dant;
<PB N="268" REF="277"/>
or, if they cannot agree, is chosen by lot in the fol∣lowing
manner: The plaintiff and defendant appoint each
six persons; from the six appointed by the defendant the
plaintiff selects one; the defendant nominates one of the
six chosen by the plaintiff; and these two persons draw lots
who shall be arbitrator. He then examines the acts of the
process, gives his opinion, which is called in the statutes of
the country <HI>Il Consiglio del Savio,</HI> and the governor is bound
to submit to his decision. The obligation of the governor to
follow the opinion of the arbitrator is so strong, that accord∣ing
to the statutes, if he refuses to pass sentence, the opinion
of the Savio is <HI>ipso facto</HI> a decision.</P>
<P>FROM this decision there lies an appeal to two arbitrators
called <HI>Probi,</HI> who are appointed by the parties in the manner
abovementioned: should they disagree, then the two parties
amicably nominate a counsellor, who accedes to one of the
Probi; and this sentence is final, if it concurs with that of
the Savio; but otherwise, there lies a farther appeal either to
the syndicate or diet, and ultimately to the several communi∣ties
of the three leagues. When the governor decides in the
first instance he receives three <HI>per cent.</HI> of the contested pro∣perty,
but only one <HI>per cent.</HI> when recourse is had to arbi∣tration,
the other two <HI>per cent.</HI> being paid to the Savio. By
this singular privilege of referring to arbitration in all causes
of property, the civil courts of justice are not open to such
corruption as the criminal tribunals; and yet venality has
taken so deep a root in the affairs of this unhappy country,
that bribery finds its way even into the civil tribunals.
When the civil causes are brought in the governor's court,
<PB N="269" REF="278"/>
and decided by him, without the intervention of the Savio
and Probi, there lies an appeal to the syndicate, a body whose
office I shall now explain.</P>
<P>AT the end of every two years, when the magistracies
expire, syndicates are appointed by the Republic of the
Grisons, for the purpose of inquiring into the administration
of the several governors, and of hearing appeals from their
decisions. This court is composed of nine members, includ∣ing
the president; they are chosen reciprocally by the com∣munities,
three from each league. They make a circuit into
each of the subject provinces; send out proclamations, that
they are ready to receive all accusations against the governors,
examine witnesses, decide all appeals, and can mitigate all
fines imposed, without the concurrence of the vicar and
assessor. They do not, however, finally determine in civil
causes, in the last resort, which may be referred from their
decision to the diet. The syndicate, which was intended to
oppose corruption and injustice, is nevertheless the great sup∣port
of both. Nor can it be otherwise; for the syndics pur∣chase
their office from the several communities; and as
their salary is very small, they can only reimburse them∣selves
by receiving bribes from the judges or from the appel∣lants.
Their office is bought for a greater or smaller sum, as
there are more or less appeals of consequence to be submit∣ted
to their arbitration. And what is pregnant with still
greater abuses, when a cause of great importance is to be re∣ferred
to the syndicate, the governors frequently purchase
from the several communities, in whose right the election is
for that time vested, the power of nominating the syndics,
<PB N="270" REF="279"/>
and of course appoint their own creatures. Hence this
court is become so corrupt as to give rise to a proverb,
“<HI>as venal as the syndicate.</HI>”</P>
<P>HAVING thus endeavoured to draw a general sketch of
the civil and criminal jurisprudence in this country, I shall
now mention the domestic administration of affairs. All
public concerns, which do not fall under the jurisdiction of
the Grisons, are discussed and determined by a council composed
of five representatives, one from each district, which meet as
occasion requires at Sondrio. Previous to its sitting, the public
notary writes to the several parishes of the five governments,
informing them of the business to be transacted: each parish
has its meeting, in which every householder possesses a vote;
and each district has its assembly composed of deputies from
the several parishes, who choose the representatives. In all
affairs of importance, the representatives are bound to vote in
conformity to instructions received from their constituents,
and all transactions are decided by a majority of voices. The
council is empowered to demand a redress of grievances
from the Grisons, and to remonstrate against infractions of
the privileges granted to the inhabitants by the Capitulation
of Milan. The governor of the Valteline is present, but
has no vote.</P>
<P>THE tribute which the Valteline pays to the Grisons is so
small, the salaries of the governors so inconsiderable, and all
duties so trifling, that most writers, who have had occasion
to mention this valley, have described it as the most happy
and the least oppressed of all subject provinces; without re∣flecting,
<PB N="271" REF="280"/>
that notwithstanding these advantages, the country
is annually drained of a sum very disproportionate to the abi∣lity
of the inhabitants. It is difficult to ascertain the exact
amount of this sum, as it arises chiefly from the secret as
well as public profits of the courts of justice. But when we
consider that the greatest part is procured by extortion; that
scarcely any distinction is made between innocence and
guilt; that great crimes are committed with impunity, and
petty offences are severely punished; we may add, that the
mode of exaction is more detrimental to the country than
the loss of the specie itself; inasmuch as a corrupt adminis∣tration
of justice is the worst of all oppressions.</P>
<P>THE clergy of the Valteline are not responsible to the or∣dinary
courts of justice, their immunities being so exorbitant
as to render them almost independent of the civil authority.
They are only amenable to the court of the bishop of Como.
If a priest is guilty of any misdemeanor, his person cannot
be secured without the concurrence of the bishop, and go∣vernor
of the district in which the crime was committed.
It is therefore extremely difficult to bring an ecclesiastic to
justice, as impunity is easily purchased, either by securing
the favour of the bishop's vicar or of the magistrate. Nor
are these pernicious privileges confined merely to the clergy,
but extend to all persons wearing an ecclesiastical dress, by
the permission of the bishop of Como.</P>
<P>THE Grisons have frequently endeavoured to annihilate
these immunities, but always without effect. The nobles of
the Valteline are interested to support the privileges of the
<PB N="272" REF="281"/>
clergy, because they can easily procure the permission of
wearing the ecclesiastical dress, and because they can secure
their property, by leaving their estates to the clergy at the
extinction of all the heirs named in the succession. Such
estates, called <HI>beneficia gentilitia,</HI> are very common in the
Valteline, and cannot be seized for debt, or confiscated.
All civil causes of the clergy, below the value of two
hundred livres<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sixty-four Valteline livres = a pound sterling.</NOTE>, are decided by the vicar of the bishop of
Como: above that sum they are brought before the bishop.
An appeal from his decision lies to the pope's nuncio at Lu∣cern,
from him to the ecclesiastical tribunal at Aquilea, and
from thence to Rome.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 77.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TEGLIO—SONDRIO—ANECDOTES OF THE PAINTER
LIGARIO—MORBEGNO—DELEBIO.</HEAD>
<P>INSTEAD of proceeding by the nearest road from Ti∣rano
to Sondrio, I made a circuit by Teglio, passed
over the plain of Tirano, rich in all the productions of
nature, and continued for some way at the foot of the nor∣thern
ridge of mountains, which are highly cultivated to
their very summits. Lower towards the south-east, and
further towards the north-east, the tops of the rugged Alps
make their appearance, glistening with snow. The country
was a continued vineyard, and the soil is so fertile, that corn,
millet, flax, and hemp, are sown among the vines, which
hang over them in beautiful festoons. Every village is
adorned with a thick grove of chesnut-trees, whose rich and
dark foliage produces a pleasing effect.</P>
<P>TEGLIO, the capital of the government of the same
name, is situated upon the top of a mountain, about mine
miles from Tirano, and twelve from Sondrio. It is a long
straggling place, and contains about three hundred houses.
Close to the town are the ruins of a fortress standing upon
an insulated rock, and formerly esteemed of great strength.
This elevated spot commands a very rich and extensive
prospect from Tiano to the lower part of the valley beyond
Sondrio, as far as Morbegno. The government of Teglio is
<PB N="274" REF="283"/>
said to comprise the twelfth part of the Valteline: it is the
most populous district, and contains about eight thousand
souls. It produces in a good season much more corn than is
sufficient for the consumption of its inhabitants, and rivals
Sondrio and Tirano in the goodness of its wine. Finding
little at Teglio but the face of the country to excite curiosity,
I proceeded in my journey to Sondrio, through a tract
highly cultivated, and descended by a gentle slope to the bed
of the Adda, which roars through the plain, sometimes con∣fined
in a narrow channel, sometimes expanding itself in a
wider bed, and threatening the country with continual
inundations.</P>
<P>SONDRIO is the capital of the valley, the residence of
the governor of the Valteline and of the vicar; but, like all
the towns in this valley, it has a deserted aspect: there is
little appearance of trade, and no animation. The town,
partly built in a plain, and partly upon the sides of a rock, is
placed in a very romantic situation, at the extremity of a nar∣row
valley, and occupies both sides of the Malenco, a furious
torrent which frequently overflows its banks. Many of the
houses are very ancient; for I observed the arms of the Vis∣conti,
formerly the sovereigns of this country, painted upon
their walls; these arms, representing an enormous serpent
crushing a man between his teeth, are too remarkable to
escape observation.</P>
<P>THE Valteline, from its neighbourhood to Italy, has im∣bibed
a taste for the fine arts, and there are many collections
of pictures which are not unworthy of notice. This
<PB N="275" REF="284"/>
country, however, has produced few artists of any eminence.
Pietro Ligario is almost the only painter who deserves to be
mentioned, and his name is scarcely known beyond the li∣mits
of the Valteline.</P>
<P>LIGARIO was born at Sondrio in 1686, of the ancient fa∣mily
of Ligario, which took its name from a neighbouring
village of that appellation. Having discovered a lively ge∣nius,
and a taste for the elegant arts, he was sent when very
young to Rome, under the care of Lazaro Baldi, from whom
he learnt that exactness of design which characterises the
Roman school. From thence he repaired to Venice, where
he passed some time in studying that exquisite colouring,
for which the Venetian masters are so remarkably distin∣guished.
He made himself first known at Milan, where he
met with some encouragement; and in 1727 he returned to
the Valteline. He found, however, but little employment,
until he was honoured with the patronage of Count Desalis,
Envoy from Great Britain to the Republic of the Grisons.
As he rose in reputation, his business increased; but, being
always very poor, he was frequently compelled to finish his
productions with such haste, as rendered it impossible to
give all of them that perfection, which he was capable of
bestowing. Hence arises that inequality which is so remark∣able
in his paintings.</P>
<P>THERE is scarcely a church in the Valteline which does
not possess one of his pictures: the most capital of his pieces
are the martyrdom of St. Gregory, in one of the churches at
Sondrio, and St. Benedict, in the chapel of a nunnery near
<PB N="276" REF="285"/>
the town. These were his latest performances; and as they
were, contrary to his usual custom, finished with great la∣bour
and exactness, may be considered as the test, from
which we ought to estimate his abilities as a painter. The
figures are well grouped, the principal characters distinctly
marked, and the expression of the heads is admirable: the
style of colouring is lively without being gaudy, and chaste
without being dull. A few days after he had painted St. Be∣nedict,
he was seized with a violent fever, and expired in
1752, in the 67th year of his age.</P>
<P>LIGARIO is described by the connoisseurs as a painter
who united correctness of design to beauty of colouring.
He is remarkable for grouping his figures to the best advan∣tage,
and his heads are drawn with a noble simplicity. He is,
however, represented as too much inclined to an imitation of
the antique: his figures often resemble statues; and the
folds of his drapery fall with too much precision, like the wet
drapery in the sculpture of the ancients. The character of
his faces is chiefly Grecian; but it is remarked, that they are
too similar to each other, and look like the portraits of per∣sons
who are of the same family; a circumstance not un∣usual
to those, who too servilely copy the antique.</P>
<P>BESIDE painting, Ligario was skilled in music, mecha∣nics,
and agriculture, and has left behind him specimens of
no ordinary acquaintance with each of those arts. He made,
for his own amusement, an organ of very large dimen∣sions,
and constructed a clock with a cylindrical pendulum,
remarkable for the accuracy of its movements. He was fond
<PB N="277" REF="286"/>
of rearing plants and simples, and was so much attached to
the study of agriculture, that he wrote instructions to his
family, upon the cheapest and best method of cultivation.
He endeavoured to infuse into his son and daughter, Caesar
and Victoria, a fondness for the polite arts. They both
followed their father's profession, but although not without
some degree of merit, they failed of equalling his reputa∣tion.
Victoria was chiefly distinguished for her skill in vocal
and instrumental music.</P>
<P>I RODE this morning to see the painting of St. Benedict,
at the nunnery about a mile and an half from Sondrio. The
abbess, hearing that a foreigner was in the chapel, sent a
message, desiring the favour of my company. Upon enter∣ing
the parlour, I made my obeisance to the abbess, who, in
company with two nuns, was seated on the other side of the
grate. After the usual compliments, and inquiries if the pic∣ture
pleased me, wine and cakes were brought in. The wine
was the produce of their own vineyards, and was excellent.
The cakes were shaped like skulls and bones.</P>
<P>THE abbess and her companions behaved with great ease
and politeness; asked many questions relating to England,
natural to persons sequestered from society; and one of
them apologized for their curiosity, by remarking, that wo∣men
were not less inquisitive or less fond of talking, because
they were shut up in a nunnery. The person who made this
remark was pale, but not unhealthy; her figure was re∣markably
fine, and she had been very handsome; a disap∣pointment
in love, as I am informed, first induced her to
<PB N="278" REF="287"/>
take the veil, and to bury so much beauty and elegance in a
convent. Struck with her manner and address, I could not
help wishing she may never live to regret such a step, and
that she may feel all that ease and tranquillity of mind,
which are expected, but not always found, by those who
take the veil.</P>
<P>I AM just returned to Sondrio, from a small excursion to
Morbegno and towards the extremity of the Valteline as far
as Delebio. Near Sondrio the valley is about two miles in
breadth, and remarkably fertile in vines and all kinds of
grain. The right-hand chain of mountains is clothed al∣most
from the bottom to its summit with a continued vine∣yard,
which is esteemed to yield the best wine in the Valte∣line.
I rode along the plain which stretches, without inter∣ruption,
from Sondrio to the lake of Como. The middle
part of this plain is occupied, and frequently overflowed
by the unruly Adda, and being marshy yields nothing but
coarse pasturage. The sides rise gradually into gentle accli∣vities,
and display a rich variety of natural productions.</P>
<P>MORBEGNO lies on the left side of the Adda, at the foot
of the southernmost chain. It is the handsomest town in the
Valteline, and appears to have more shops, and to carry on
more trade, than all the others united. Mr. Planta the
present podesta of Morbegno, no sooner heard of my ar∣rival,
than he politely waited upon me at the inn, and in∣vited
me to his house. Finding that I was desirous of pro∣ceeding
to Delebio, he insisted upon accompanying me; and
having ordered his carriage without delay, proposed an im∣mediate
<PB N="279" REF="288"/>
departure, that we might return to his house by
supper. Mr. Planta is the same person to whom I was obliged
for so hospitable a reception at his house at Cernetz; and it
gives me much satisfaction to hear from all quarters, that he
may be reckoned among the few who act with honour and in∣tegrity
in this land of extortion. When vicar of the Valteline,
he discharged the duties of that important office with great
credit, and has entered upon his government with the same
spirit of integrity. There is a pleasure in receiving acts of
politeness in a foreign country; but it is a double satisfaction
to be obliged to persons whose characters are deserving of
the highest esteem.</P>
<P>THE road from Morbegno to Delebio runs along the foot
of the chain of mountains, which separate the Valteline from
the Venetian territories. This chain having a northern as∣pect
yields few vines, but is richly clad with hanging groves
of chesnut-trees, chequered with meadows and fields of corn.
The Valteline expands gradually as we advanced towards
the lake of Como: in this part the whole plain is chiefly a
morass, exposed to the inundations of the Adda, which flows
through it in a wide channel. The silk, which begins to be
of great importance in the trade of this valley, is chiefly
exported from Delebio, through Chiavenna, into Germany.
Upon my return to Morbegno, I supped with Mr. Planta, and
after the repast was entertained with an excellent concert.
In my return to Sondrio, I crossed the Adda opposite Mor∣begno,
over a handsome stone bridge, and proceeded along
a road carried at the foot, and along the sides of the northern
chain of mountains. It was almost a continued vineyard,
<PB N="280" REF="289"/>
with millet, Turkish corn, flax, and hemp, growing between
the ranges of vines.</P>
<P>THE romantic beauties of the Valteline are greatly
heightened by the numerous remains of ancient fortresses
and castles scattered throughout the country. They were all
dismantled soon after the capitulation of Milan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 89.</NOTE>, from a
recent experience, that the inability of the Grisons to
provide them with sufficient garrisons, exposed them to the
enemy, and rendered them for the most part of source
of annoyance rather than of protection. It might be ima∣gined,
that some of these fortresses ought to have been re∣tained
for the purpose of awing the inhabitants: such an
absolute confidence, however, is reposed by the Grisons in
the guaranty of the country by the House of Austria, that
they do not maintain a single soldier throughout the whole
Valteline.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">COMMERCE—PRODUCTIONS—POPULATION—OF THE
VALTELINE.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief commerce of the Valteline is carried on
with Milan and the Grisons. The principal exports
of the country are wine and silk, which turn the balance of
trade in its favour: they enable the inhabitants to exist with∣out
any manufactures, and help to supply the money which
is exacted by the governors.</P>
<P>THE wine is sent into the Grisons, Germany, the Venetian
states, Bormio, and occasionally to Milan. Upon a rough
calculation 73, 000 soma, or horse-loads, are annually ex∣ported:
this year the soma sold for a pound sterling, which
may be considered its average value. The silk is sent to Eng∣land,
Zuric, and Basle. The district of Delebio and Talo∣mara
produces the finest silk, the neighbourhood of Sondrio
the next in quality, and the district of Tirano supplies an
inferior sort. Three thousand pound of the finest sort,
which is esteemed as good as the silk procured from Pied∣mont,
is sent annually to England by way of Ostend. The
greatest part of the silk is wound in the Valteline, for which
purpose there are silk mills in the principal districts. Besides
these commodities, the Valteline exports planks, cheese,
butter, and cattle. The inhabitants receive from Milan
<PB N="282" REF="291"/>
corn, rice, salt, silken stuffs; from Germany and Switzerland
cloth and linen; from Genoa spices, coffee, and sugar.
There are no manufactures in the Valteline, and almost all
the menial trades are exercised by foreigners.</P>
<P>THE population of the Valteline may be estimated from

<P>THE cottages of the peasants, which are built of stone,
are large, but gloomy, generally without glass windows: I
entered several, and was every where disgusted with an
uniform appearance of dirt and poverty. The peasants are
mostly covered with rags, and the children have usually an
unhealthy look, which arises from their wretched manner
of living. Such a scarcity of provisions has been occasioned
by last year's drought, that the poor inhabitants have been
reduced to the most extreme necessity. The price of bread
was unavoidably raised so high, that in many parts the pea∣sants
could not purchase it; and their only food was for
some time a kind of paste, made by pounding the hulls and
stones of the grapes which had been pressed for wine, and
mixing it with a little meal. Famine, added to their op∣pressed
situation, reduced the inhabitants to the lowest con∣dition
<PB N="283" REF="292"/>
of human misery, and numbers perished from absolute
want. But it is a pleasure to reflect that they are in some
measure relieved by the plentiful harvest of the present
year.</P>
<P>PERHAPS no part of Europe is more fruitful than the
Valteline, and yet there is no country in which the peasants
are more wretched. Many reasons are to be assigned for the
misery to which they are reduced. The first and principal
cause is the form of government. The governors, as I have
shewn in a former letter, generally abuse the exorbitant
authority entrusted to them by the laws, the peasants are
imprisoned upon the slightest information; and as all trans∣gressions
are punished by fines, an accused person is seldom
found innocent; so that a considerable number of peasants
are annually ruined in the courts of justice. Beside the in∣dividuals
who are supposed to suffer for their own guilt, the
parishes are subject to continual assessments, towards defray∣ing
the expences for the trial and imprisonment of the poor
parishioners: if the latter are unable to pay the sum re∣quired,
it is demanded from the parish to which the criminal
belongs. In this case it frequently happens, that the assess∣ments,
instead of being laid upon the landholders, are im∣posed
upon each hearth, by which means the chief burden
falls upon the poor.</P>
<P>ANOTHER cause of wretchedness proceeds from the
present state of property. Few of the peasants are land∣holders;
as from the continual oppression under which the
people have groaned for above these two last centuries, the
<PB N="284" REF="293"/>
freeholds have gradually fallen into the hands of the nobles
and Grisons, the latter of whom are supposed to possess half
the estates in the Valteline. The tenants who take farms
do not pay their rent in money, but in kind; a strong proof
of general poverty. The peasant is at all the costs of cul∣tivation,
and delivers near half the produce to the landholder.
The remaining portion would ill compensate his labour and
expence, if he was not in some measure befriended by the
fertility of the soil. The ground seldom lies fallow, and
the richest parts of the valley produce two crops. The first
crop is wheat, rye, or spelt, half of which is delivered to the
proprietor; the second crop is generally millet, buck-wheat,
maaze, or Turkey corn, which is the principal nourish∣ment
of the common people: the chief part of this crop
belongs to the peasant, and enables him in a plentiful year
to support his family with some degree of comfort. The
peasants who inhabit the districts which yield wine are the
most wretched: for the trouble and charge of rearing the
vines, of gathering and pressing the grapes, is very conside∣rable;
and they are so very apt to consume the share of
liquor allotted to them in intoxication, that, were it not for
the grain intermixed with the vines, they and their families
would be left almost entirely destitute of subsistence.</P>
<P>BESIDES the business of agriculture, some of the pea∣sants
attend to the cultivation of silk. For this purpose they
receive the eggs from the landholder, rear the silk-worms,
and are entitled to half the silk. This employment is not
unprofitable; for although the rearing of the silk-worms is
attended with much trouble, and requires great caution, yet
<PB N="285" REF="294"/>
as the occupation is generally entrusted to the women, it
does not take the men from their work. With all the ad∣vantages,
however, derived from the fertility of the soil,
and the variety of its productions, the peasants cannot, with∣out
the utmost difficulty, and a constant exertion, maintain
their families; and they are always reduced to the greatest
distress, whenever the season is unfavourable to agriculture.</P>
<P>To the causes of penury among the lower classes above
enumerated, may be added the natural indolence of the
people, and their tendency to superstition, which takes
them from their labour. Upon the whole, I have not, in
the course of my travels, seen any peasantry, except in
Poland, so comfortless as the inferior inhabitants of this
valley. They enjoy indeed one great advantage over the
Poles, in not being the absolute property of the landholder,
and transferable, like cattle. They are therefore at liberty
to live where they chuse, to quit their country, and seek a
better condition in other regions; a relief to which distress
often compels them to have recourse.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Chiavenna, <DATE>August 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I QUITTED Sondrio yesterday after dinner, and went up
the valley of Malenco; yielding vines, chesnut-trees, rye,
oats, and pasturage. The sides of the mountains were
clothed with birch and firs; and their summits produced
nothing but a scanty herbage. The inhabitants of this
valley appear healthier, better clothed, and more industrious,
than the other peasants of the Valteline. In consequence
of their distance from the seat of government, or of being
<PB N="286" REF="295"/>
in general too poor to excite the rapaciousness of the Grison
governors, they are, perhaps, less oppressed, and for the most
part possess a small portion of land. The valley is narrow,
and watered by a torrent, which forms a continued cataract.
The road is a faint path, by the side of a precipice, and car∣ried
over huge fragments of rocks. I passed the night in a
solitary hut at the bottom of the Muret; the next morning
mounted a rugged ascent in the channel of a small stream;
observed nothing but bare rocks, without the least appear∣ance
of vegetation; came to the top of the Muret, and passed
over a large mass of snow and ice.</P>
<P>IN these alpine situations the traveller sees, within the
space of a few hours, nature in all her shapes. In the Valte∣line
she is rich and fertile; here she is barren and stupendous.
These regions are so dreary and desolate, that if it were not
for an occasional traveller, the flights of a few strange birds,
the goats browsing on the rugged alps, and the shepherds
who tend them, nature would appear quite inanimate. In
these elevated spots, while
<Q>“Placed above the storm's career,”</Q>
I noticed the pleasing effect produced by the vapours and
mists floating in mid-air beneath me; circumstances finely
felt and described by the author of The Minstrel.</P>
<Q><L>“And oft the craggy cliff he lov'd to climb,</L>
<L>When all in mist the world below was lost:</L>
<L>What dreadful pleasure there to stand sublime,</L>

<L>And view the enormous sea of vapour, tost</L>
<L>In billows lengthening to the horizon round,</L>
<L>Now scoop'd in gulphs, with mountains now emboss'd!”</L></Q>
<P>FROM the top of the Muret I descended about three hours
a craggy, desolate, and uninhabited country; and noticed the
gradual increase of vegetation as I approached the road leading
to Chiavenna, a little above Casazza. This passage over the
Muret, which serves for the transportation of wine and other
merchandise from the Valteline to the Grisons, is only open
about five months in the year.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Chiavenna, <DATE>Sept. 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY correspondence with you has been for some time
interrupted by a disorder which has detained me in
these parts above six weeks. The day after my arrival from
the Valteline, I was seized with a lassitude, which I attri∣buted
to the fatigue of the journey; it ended in a violent
pain and swelling of my right-hand, the effects of a rheu∣matism,
which probably seized me the night I passed at the
bottom of the Muret: not being able to procure a bed, I slept
in the hay-loft, and suffered much from the piercing north
wind, which blew from the glacier. I likewise imprudently
walked the next morning, without intermission or refresh∣ment,
for the space of seven hours, from the top of the
Muret to Bondo, so that the cold and fatigue brought on
a rheumatic complaint, which has detained me here six
weeks. During great part of the time I wore my arm in a
sling, and was incapable of writing a line. What I most re∣gret
in this delay is, my having been prevented from being
present at the general diet of the Grisons, which was held at
Davos the latter end of last month.</P>
<P>THE county of Chiavenna came under the sovereignty
of the Grisons in the same manner and at the same time with
<PB N="289" REF="298"/>
the Valteline. During the war of the Valteline it frequently
changed its masters, but at the peace of Milan was finally
restored to the Grisons. It is ruled, like the other subject
provinces, by a Grison governor, who is called Commissary,
and who in a few instances is even less limited in his power
than the judges of the Valteline.</P>
<P>THE criminal court of justice is formed by the commis∣sary
and the assessor. The assessor is appointed by the com∣missary,
from three candidates nominated by the county.
He must attend all examinations, concur in ordering torture
for the conviction of a criminal, be present when it is in∣flicted,
and ratify the final sentence: but as the assessor
owes his place to the commissary, and shares in his ex∣actions,
he is a mere cypher, and never ventures to exert his
right of interposing a negative. This circumstance renders
the courts of justice in Chiavenna more uniformly iniquitous
than even those of the Valteline: for the close union be∣tween
the commissary and assessor almost precludes the
chance of redress, and gives unbounded scope to oppression.
It would be unnecessary to describe the mode of proceeding
established in this court of justice, as it is similar to that of
the Valteline. In civil causes the commissary receives five
<HI>per cent.</HI> of the contested property; and an appeal from his
decision may be submitted to the syndicate.</P>
<P>CHIAVENNA, the capital of the county, is situated at the
foot and upon the side of a mountain, and contains about
3, 000 souls. The inhabitants carry on but little commerce.
The principal article of exportation (excepting the stone pots
<PB N="290" REF="299"/>
mentioned in a former letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 69.</NOTE>) is raw silk. The whole
country produces about 3, 600 pounds of that commodity.
A manufacture of silk stockings, the only one in the town,
has been lately established. The neighbouring country is
covered with vineyards; but the wine is meagre, and only a
small quantity is exported. The great support of Chiavenna
is the transport of merchandise, this town being the prin∣cipal
place of communication between the Milanese and
Germany. From hence the goods are sent either by Coire
into Germany, or through Pregalia and the Engadinas into
the Tyrol. There is a duty laid by the Grisons upon all the
merchandise which passes through Chiavenna; but this duty
is so small, that the whole customs, including those in the
Valteline, are farmed for 17, 000 florins, or about £. 1260
<HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P>THE principal object of curiosity in the environs of Chia∣venna
is the fortress in ruins, seated upon the summit of a
rock, which overlooks the town, and celebrated in the
history of the Grisons for its almost impregnable strength.
The only road which leads up to it is steep and craggy.
The walls occupy a large space of ground, and are now
partly covered with vines. The strongest part of the fortress
was constructed upon an insulated rock, rent, as some per∣sons
conjecture, by a violent convulsion of nature, from the
contiguous mountain. It is on all sides absolutely perpen∣dicular,
and its only communication with the castle was
formed by a draw-bridge thrown across the intervening
<PB N="291" REF="300"/>
chasm. Others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may, perhaps, reconcile these two opinions, by admitting that the opening was originally occasioned by a violent convulsion of nature, but was afterwards enlarged and fashioned by art.</NOTE> suppose the separation of this rock from the
remaining part of the fortress to have been the work of art,
and affirm, that it was excavated in 1343, by order of Galeaz∣zo
Visconti. Its length is above 250 feet, its height about
200, and its greatest distance from the adjoining rock about
20 feet. This fortification, though always deemed impreg∣nable,
has been taken at different periods, sometimes by
assault, but more frequently by famine or stratagem. It was
finally demolished by the Grisons themselves.</P>
<P>CLOSE to Chiavenna is a rock of asbestos, a species of mi∣neral
substance, of a greyish silver colour, which can be
drawn into longitudinal fibres as fine as thread, and is sup∣posed
to be indestructible by fire; the ancients manufactured
it into a species of cloth resembling linen. This species of
cloth is frequently mentioned by Pliny. It was principally
used for shrouds, in which the bodies of the great were en∣veloped
before they were placed upon the funeral pile; and
which, not being liable to be consumed by fire, preserved
the ashes of the body separate from those of the wood.
The art of weaving the asbestos into linen is not lost, as
some authors have asserted: but as it is very troublesome
and expensive, and as the custom of burning bodies, which
gave it a value, is no longer in use, the manufacture is dis∣continued.
Beside the rock of asbestos just mentioned,
near Chiavenna, several mountains in these parts yield the
<PB N="292" REF="301"/>
same substance. The best sort is found in the mountains
that border the valley of Malenco, of which I have seen
many very fine specimens.</P>
<P>UPON quitting Chiavenna, I entered the valley of St. Gia∣como,
which is narrow, and watered by the torrent Lira. It
is part of the county of Chiavenna, contains about ten
parishes, is under the jurisdiction of the commissary, and
possesses several important privileges, that preserve the inha∣bitants
from the oppression which their neighbours endure.
All causes are tried in the valley. The criminal statutes are
the same as those of Chiavenna, with this difference only,
that instead of the assessor the valley chuses four persons,
who are always present at the examination; and without
whose concurrence torture cannot be inflicted, nor sentence
passed. The valley has its own code of civil jurisprudence,
and courts independent of the commissary, from the decision
of which there lies an appeal to the diet. The lower part of
the valley produces vines and corn: the upper part rye, bar∣ley,
and pasture, mixed with large groves of fir and pine. I
passed on my left hand the church of St. Guglielmo, which I
mention because it is supposed to have been erected in ho∣nour
of William king of Sicily. This William was the last
sovereign of the male branch of the Norman line, which
commenced in Count Roger, who conquered Sicily from the
Saracens in the latter end of the eleventh century.</P>
<P>ROGER was twelfth son of Tancred of Hauteville, a Nor∣man
baron, and brother of the celebrated Robert Guiscard,
<PB REF="302"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="293" REF="303"/>
the bravest of those brave Norman adventurers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would refer the curious reader to Mr. Gibbon's ample and accurate narrative of the history and exploits of these Norman adventurers, in the fifth volume of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.</NOTE> who sallied
from their native country, formed a flourishing but tempo∣rary
establishment in the southern parts of Italy, and fur∣nished
by their exploits such ample materials for history and
romance. The son of Count Roger, who inherited the name
and spirit of his father, erected Sicily into a kingdom: at
the extinction of the male line of Robert Guiscard in the
person of William, duke of Apulia, he annexed Apulia and
Calabria to Sicily, and reigned over those territories, under
the title of the Two Sicilies, which now comprehend the
present kingdom of Naples and Sicily. The throne of
Roger was successively filled by his son William the First,
surnamed the <HI>Bad,</HI> and by his grandson William the Second,
distinguished by the name of <HI>Good.</HI> On the demise of the
latter without issue male, the Sicilians set aside Constantia,
daughter of Roger, and wife of the emperor Henry the
Sixth, and elected Tancred, illegitimate grandson of the first
king. Tancred died in 1193; and William, his only surviv∣ing
son, was crowned while an infant. Being dethroned by
the emperor Henry the Sixth, who claimed the Two Sicilies
in right of his wife Constantia, he was imprisoned, together
with his mother Sibilla, in the fortress of Ems, near Coire.
Some authors assert that he was deprived of his sight, others
that he was mutilated, by order of Henry. Some relate that he
died in prison, others that he was released, together with his
mother Sibilla; that he accompanied her to France, but grow∣ing
weary of the world retired to this spot, and passed the latter
<PB N="294" REF="304"/>
part of his days as an hermit, with such a reputation of
sanctity, that he was canonised after his death. Such con∣tradictory
accounts occur frequently in the history of the
dark ages. Muratori, who from his insight into the ancient
records is most capable of solving this difficulty, leaves the
question undecided; but seems rather inclined to believe,
that William was released from his captivity, and that he
afterwards turned hermit. As the genealogy of the Norman
line is very complicated and obscure, and erroneously repre∣sented
by many writers, I shall here subjoin a table of those
sovereigns and their principal descendants.</P>

<P>FROM Isola the ascent is steep and rugged to the top
of mount Splugen; and the torrent Lira roars from
precipice to precipice in several stupendous cataracts. The
road is hewn in the solid rock: in many parts it has the ap∣pearance
of steps, in others is perforated through the moun∣tains.
In pursuing my way over this dreary tract, I was
frequently reminded of the passage down the Gemmi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 33.</NOTE>.
Toward the summit of the Splugen there is an oval plain
about two miles long and one broad, encircled with craggy
points: it produces no trees, but yields rich pasturage.
Near the summit are several rude blocks of a whitish kind
of marble. I baited the horses at a small inn which stands at
the extremity of the oval plain, and is the only house be∣tween
the valley of St. Giacomo and Splugen. Before the
door there were at least a hundred horses laden with mer∣chandise.
Three hundred horses are said to pass daily in this
season of the year. Gently ascending from this oval plain, I
observed the source of the Lira, which falls into the lake of
Chiavenna, and soon afterwards crossed the highest ridge, on
the other side of which the torrents flow towards the Rhine.
The country is wild, and scarcely produces a single tree.
<PB N="298" REF="309"/>
Lower, firs began to make their appearance; at first thinly
scattered over the rocks, and gradually thickening into large
forests. This passage over mount Splugen is principally
used for the transport of merchandise to and from Coire: it
is kept open even in winter, though not without great diffi∣culty.
In that season the merchandises are chiefly trans∣ported
on sledges, of which forty or fifty pass in a day.</P>
<P>THE territory of the Grey League occupies all the eastern
tract of this mountainous country, and is by far the most
considerable, in extent as well as population, of the three
Grison leagues. The etymology of the word Grigia, or
<HI>Grey,</HI> which gives its name to this league and the whole
country, is extremely uncertain. Some authors have conjec∣tured,
that the people of this district were the original inha∣bitants
of the country, and were called <HI>Grey,</HI> in order to dis∣tinguish
them from the more modern inhabitants, by an al∣lusion
to <HI>grey</HI> hairs, an emblem of antiquity. Others, on the
contrary, dating this appellation from more modern times,
assert that the first authors of the revolution, which, in 1424,
gave liberty to the several communities in the Grey League,
were drest in the coarse <HI>grey</HI> cloth of the country; and that
in commemoration of this great event the league was called
<HI>Grey</HI> from their dress. It is certain, however, that this ap∣pellation
is of very high antiquity, and existed long before
the revolution. Tacitus calls the inhabitants of this country
<HI>Rhaetos Griseos, id est, canos;</HI> and Ammianus Marcellinus
styles the country about Coire, <HI>Canos campos,</HI> or the <HI>Grey</HI>
Fields. Hence it appears how very fruitless must be any
investigation concerning the true etymology of a word which
<PB N="299" REF="310"/>
lies hid in very remote antiquity, beyond the reach of our
most inquisitive researches. Without entering, therefore,
too minutely into etymological disquisitions, we may only
remark in general, that the term Grisons, or <HI>Grey</HI> people,
was the general name by which <HI>all</HI> the inhabitants of Rhetia
were distinguished, and was not confined to that particular
district now called the Grey League. The appropriation of
the term to that particular body, may be thus accounted for.
When the inhabitants of this district first rose in arms, for
the purpose of asserting their independence, they naturally
styled themselves, the League of the people called Grisons,
or the <HI>Grey</HI> League; while those of the two other leagues,
who afterwards formed similar associations, although equally
known by the name of Grisons, took different appellations
to distinguish themselves from the first confederacy.</P>
<P>THE territory now occupied by the Grey League, was
formerly subject to the abbot of Disentis, the counts of
Werdenberg, of Sax, of Masox, and the baron the Retzuns.
The people seem to have originally possessed considerable
privileges, which were gradually undermined, and occasion∣ally
violated by their chiefs and barons; engaged in perpetual
hostilities with each other, the barons laid great exactions
upon their subjects, in order to pay their troops, who could
only be prevented from disbanding by repeated largesses.
These exactions were at length carried to such an excess,
and the people so wantonly oppressed by the tyranny of
their despots, that, excited by the example of the neighbour∣ing
Swiss republics, they determined to deliver themselves
from the grievous subjection under which they had long
<PB N="300" REF="311"/>
laboured. But the meeting of the insurgents was by no
means attended with any unwarrantable excesses, naturally
to be expected from an enraged populace, but was conducted
with the greatest composure. The leading members of the
several communities having previously concerted the plan, a
solemn deputation was dispatched to the respective sove∣reigns,
who were assembled at Truns: the deputies laid
the grievances before the chiefs, from whom they not only
extorted redress, but procured a restitution of several obso∣lete
privileges, and the addition of many new immunities.
In consideration of these concessions, the chiefs were per∣mitted
to reserve to themselves certain prerogatives, which
some of their descendants or successors possess at this day; a
distinction which is now peculiar to this league, and renders
its general constitution in some respects more aristocratical
than that of the other two leagues.</P>
<P>THESE prerogatives consist in being present at the annual
diet of the league, and in alternately proposing three candidates
for <HI>Landrichter,</HI> or chief of the league, from whom one is no∣minated
by the deputies. The counts of Werdenberg being
extinct, these prerogatives are now confined to the emperor
of Germany, as baron of Rhetzuns, the abbot of Disentis,
and the temporary count of Sax. No real count of Sax now
exists; for, upon the extinction of that family, certain com∣munities
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These communities are Lungnets and Vals, Ilants and Grub, Flims and Castris.</NOTE> of the Grey League seized the domains, and
continue to exercise the rights which were formerly enjoyed
by the counts of Sax. The mode of creating a titular
<PB N="301" REF="312"/>
count for the purpose of exercising these rights, is as follows:
A few days before the meeting of the diet of the league
assembled at Truns, those communities elect a person who
represents the count. He is called in Romansh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Literally <HI>head</HI> of Sax. <HI>Cau</HI> is supposed to be a corruption from <HI>caput.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cau de Saxe</HI>
and, although not unfrequently a common peasant, sits, at
the diet, upon the same bench with the representative of the
House of Austria and the abbot of Disentis, is addressed by a
title equal to his supposed dignity, nominates the Land∣richter
every third year, and, having discharged his office,
sinks at the expiration of a few days into his ordinary rank.</P>
<P>ANOTHER distinction peculiar to the Grey League ought
not to be omitted. Like the other leagues, the particular
districts possess their courts of criminal justice in the last re∣sort;
but in all civil causes above a certain value an appeal
lies from the decision of the several courts to sixteen depu∣ties
annually assembled at Truns. I only mention the fact
in this place, but shall have occasion to enlarge upon it in a
future letter.</P>
<P>SPLUGEN, situated upon the rise of an hill, at the bottom
of a rugged chain of alps, is the principal place in the val∣ley
of Rheinwald which forms a high jurisdiction of the
Grey League. The Rheinwald is so called from the Hynder
Rhine, which takes its rise upon the Vogelsberg, about the
distance of twelve miles, and runs through this valley. It
was my intention to have visited this source, but my late in∣disposition
<PB N="302" REF="313"/>
will not permit me at present to take fatiguing
journeys.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the Rheinwald speak German, although
they are entirely surrounded by people who use a different
language. Towards the south, beyond the mountains of
Splugen and St. Bernardin, in the valleys of St. Giacomo and
Masox, Italian is the common tongue: towards the north and
east, in the valleys of Schams, of St. Peter, and of Lugnetz,
Romansh is spoken. This remarkable circumstance has
led many authors to conjecture that the people of this and
other districts of the Grisons, who talk German, are de∣scended
from the <HI>Lepontii,</HI> supposed to be a Celtic nation,
and considered as the original inhabitants of this country,
before the establishment of the Rhetians. As I shall have
occasion to examine this subject more fully in a future
letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 90.</NOTE> upon the languages of the Grisons, I shall for the
present only remark, that although the inhabitants of this
district are immediately encircled by people who talk Italian
and Romansh, yet the German language is spoken at Avers,
Cepina, Tusis, and Furstenau, which are only at a small
distance from the Rheinwald. I quitted, on the other side
of mount Splugen, the Italian climate and productions: the
air of this valley is so piercing, that we may agree with the
proverb, “There are nine months winter and three months
cold.” Two high roads meet at Splugen, one from Chia∣venna,
the other leads over the Bernard into Bellinzone.
<PB N="303" REF="314"/>
From Splugen to Arder the road continues by the side of the
Hynder Rhine, through a mountainous region, which pre∣sents
at every step the most awful magnificence of scenery.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of Suffers, the last village of the Rhein∣wald,
talk German; and at a small distance is the valley of
Schams, where the peasants speak Romansh. I made my∣self
tolerably understood by a kind of jargon, composed of
German, Italian, and Romansh; and taking out my voca∣bulary
of the Engadina language, compared the different
modes of expression and pronunciation. The inhabitants
call their language Romansh; but it differs widely from the
Romansh spoken in the valley of Surset, and still more
from that of the Engadinas. The Bible, and other books
used in this valley, are in the same dialect as those which
are read in the other parts of the Grey League, and the
language is similar, with a small variety in the pronun∣ciation.</P>
<P>THE valley of Schams, a community of the Grey League,
contains eight or nine inconsiderable burghs or villages situ∣ated
at small distances upon each side of the Rhine. It is
much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower and more fruitful than the Rheinwald. I
crossed the Rhine at Zillis, leaving on my left hand Donat,
where the collective body of people meet every year to chuse
their magistrates, and regulate all civil and political affairs,
and soon afterwards came into the <HI>Via Mala,</HI> so called from
the supposed difficulties and dangers of passing through it.
Such dreadful descriptions have been given by different tra∣vellers,
that I expected to have found it the worst road
<PB N="304" REF="315"/>
which I had hitherto travelled. But I was agreeably de∣ceived,
for it was not more incommodious than the way
from Splugen to Anders; nor was it once necessary even to
dismount from my horse, except when I stopped to take a
nearer view of any particular scene which struck my fancy:
the road even admits carriages. No reason occurs to me,
why this particular way should be distinguished by the ap∣pellation
of <HI>Via Mala,</HI> unless such descriptions allude to
former times, and modern writers have adopted them as the
mere echos of ancient travellers. Perhaps the peculiar gloom
of the valley, through which the road passes, may have
helped to convey these ideas of terror to persons not ac∣customed
to Alpine regions.</P>
<P>THE Via Mala runs through a dark and uninhabited
valley, overspread in many parts with thick forests, which
admit only a kind of twilight gloom, and so exceedingly
narrow, that the steep rocks, which enclose it, hang over,
and seem almost to meet towards their summits. The Rhine
foams at the bottom, sometimes not visible, and sometimes
faintly glimmering through
<Q><L>“—darksome pines, that, o'er the rocks reclin'd,</L>
<L>Wave high, and murmur to the hollow wind.” POPE.</L></Q></P>
<P>ABOUT three miles from the commencement of the Via
Mala we came to a stone bridge of a single arch, thrown
across a gulf; a sublime scene, which I stopped to admire,
and left with regret. The Rhine falls in a beautiful cascade,
rolls in a narrow channel at the depth of above four hundred
<PB REF="316"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="305" REF="317"/>
feet perpendicular, furiously dashes under the bridge, ex∣pands
itself into a wide bason, and then is lost under a rock,
through which it has forced a passage. The impending
mountains, partly bare, and partly embrowned with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irs,
cast an awful gloom over the gulf beneath. One circum∣stance,
which I examined with much attention, and which I
had observed in several other valleys of Switzerland, but
never in such perfection as in this place, particularly struck
me. The Rhine, which is at present about four hundred
feet below the bridge, seems evidently to have once flowed
as high, or even higher than the place where the bridge
now stands; to have gradually worn away the rock, and ex∣cavated
the deep channel in which it now runs.</P>
<P>HAVING passed the bridge, I went through a subterra∣neous
opening a few paces in length, which had been cut
through the overhanging rock, crossed a second bridge simi∣lar
to the first, and soon afterwards quitted the Rhine, and
began ascending. This part of the country is so entirely
uninhabited, that I did not meet with a single house until I
came to Roncalia, a village in the community of Tusis, upon
the top of a steep mountain. From thence I descended to
Tusis, situated near the torrent Nolla, at the beginning
of the valley of Tomliasca. This town is said by the anti∣quaries
to have been built by the Tuscans, when they took
refuge in these parts under Rhaetus.</P>
<P>TUSIS is well known in the history of the Grisons for the
<HI>Staffgericht,</HI> or court of justice, which sat in 1618, for the
trial of persons accused of holding a correspondence with
<PB N="306" REF="318"/>
Spain, and of opposing the introduction of the Protestant re∣ligion
into the Valteline. Amongst those who suffered in
this iniquitous tribunal, the most remarkable was Nicholas
Rusca, whom I had occasion to mention in my letter on the
troubles of the Valteline, the cruel circumstances of whose
death excited the general resentment of the Catholics, who
soon afterwards broke out into open rebellion. Nicholas
Rusca, a native of Bedano, in the bailliage of Locarno, was
educated in the Jesuits' college at Milan, at the expence of
cardinal Boromeo, and made so great a progress in his
studies, that, in 1589, he was appointed principal of the
church of Sondrio, although he was only in the 24th year of
his age. He immediately signalised himself by his zeal in
preaching against the reformed doctrines; and was one of
the disputants who supported the Roman Catholic faith
against the Protestant ministers, in two public conferences
held at Tirano in 1595, and the following year. His charac∣ter
has been placed in the most opposite lights by the re∣spective
historians of the two contending parties: by the
one he is represented a saint, and by the other an assassin.
But if we examine with impartiality, it will appear, that
though he was hurried on by a violent spirit of fanatical
zeal, yet he cannot be supposed guilty of the atrocious crimes
which his enemies have laid to his charge. Soon after
his promotion to the benefice of Sondrio, a misunderstand∣ing
broke out between him and the Protestants, which gra∣dually
increased during the violence of the religious disputes,
and was carried upon the following occasion to the highest
degree of animosity.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="319"/>
CHIAPPINUS, and three gondoliers of Venice, were ar∣rested
under suspicion of a design to assassinate Scipio
Calandrinus, the Protestant minister of Sondrio, at the insti∣gation
of Rusca; a confession of guilt and of Rusca's privity
being drawn from Chiappinus by the force of torture. The
governor of the Valteline referring the affair to the diet of
the Grisons, Rusca was cited before that assembly, but de∣clined
to appear; either, as his enemies pretend, from a
consciousness of guilt, or, as his friends alledge, from a dread
of putting himself in the power of the Grisons, so violently
incensed against him. Having escaped from the Valteline,
he waited at Bedano while his cause was publicly pleaded
before twelve judges deputed by the Grisons. Being acquit∣ted
of the charge, he returned to Sondrio, where his zeal,
inflamed by his late prosecution, continued to display itself
by an unremitting opposition to the establishment of a Pro∣testant
school at Sondrio; a favourite measure of the op∣posite
party.</P>
<P>HIS enemies, baffled in their first attempt, brought
against him a charge of a more public nature: they accused
him of counteracting the decrees of the Grisons, and of ex∣horting
the inhabitants of Morbegno not to bear arms
against the king of Spain, the protector of the Catholic re∣ligion.
In consequence of these insinuations, a troop of
sixty Grisons arrived at Sondrio by night, and, seizing Rusca,
carried him to Tusis, where he was not only impeached of
high treason in the temporary court of justice there assem∣bled,
but was likewise again examined, contrary to every
principle of equity, for having abetted the assassination of
<PB N="308" REF="320"/>
Calandrinus: as he preremptorily denied these charges, he
was condemned to be tortured; which horrid sentence was
three times inflicted in the dead of night. The execution
of the sentence failing to extort from him the smallest con∣fession
of guilt, he was, on the following night, twice sub∣jected
to the same dreadful process. Being of a weak frame,
and full of infirmities, he was overcome by excess of agony,
and expired amidst the torments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Die dominica, quae Augusti 23 erat, ter sine tamen pondere elevatus fuit; pers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ititque in negativa, saepius misericordiam Dei ac homi∣num implorans, quas voces dolor tormentorum ipse exprimebat, erat enim homo crebris febri∣bus vexatus, ac proinde sustinendi torturam impos erat.

Reform. Eccl. Raet. vol. II. p.</HI> 268, 269.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME writers have asserted, that Rusca died of poison,
which he had taken previous to his last examination; but
this supposition seems to be totally void of foundation, and
was only advanced in order to rescue the judges from the
odium of having tortured him to death. For when it is
considered, that, according to the common mode of applying
torture in this country, he was five times drawn up by a pulley,
with his arms tied behind, so as to occasion a dislocation of
his shoulders; that he remained in that excruciating position
above half an hour each time; and that he was in an infirm
state of body, unable to endure such extremity of pain, we
have no occasion to seek for any extraordinary cause of his
death. The advocates for the Protestant party in vain en∣deavour
to exculpate Rusca's judges from an intolerant spirit
of bigotry, by asserting that the whole transaction was a
<PB N="309" REF="321"/>
civil and not a religious process; for it is evident that theo∣logical
rancour, however disguised under the mask of patriot∣ism,
was the leading motive to this prosecution. Inde∣pendent
indeed of all theoretical reasoning, every rational
Christian, whatever his persuasion may be, must recoil with
horror from enormities so inconsistent with the first prin∣ciples
of humanity, and contradictory to the meekness of
that religion, which ought to be the rule of our actions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Aporta, with the impartiality of an honest historian, speaking of the iniqui∣tous acts of this tribunal, says,</HI> “Deum im∣mortalem!

<OPENER><DATELINE>Coire, <DATE>Sept. 21st.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FROM Tusis I continued my route along the valley of
Tomliasca, by the side of the Rhine, which here se∣parates
the Grey League from that of the House of God:
numerous towns, villages, and castles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guler, the historian of Rhetia, says, that no region of Europe contains such a number of ancient castles as the coun∣try of the Grisons; and adds, that in the small valley of Tomliasca, not more than a German mile long, and a quarter broad, there are more than seventeen castles.</NOTE>, lie agreeably scattered
through the vale in the most romantic situations. I passed
through Catzis, leaving on my left the fruitful mountain
of Henzenberg, called in Romansh Montagnia, and re∣markable
for its fertility and population; proceeded to
Retzuns, and turned a little out of my way to the castle of
that name, which makes so conspicuous a figure in the
history of the Grisons. Antiquarians derive the name of
Retzuns from <HI>Rhaetium</HI> or <HI>Rhaetia Ima</HI> (Lower Rhaetia), and
give the following account of its construction. In the
early ages of the Roman history a numerous army of Gauls
penetrated into Lombardy, and took possession of the greatest
part of that country, which was then occupied by the
Tuscans. A considerable body of Tuscans being driven from
their native country accompanied their leader, Rhaetus, and
established themselves in these regions. Rhaetus gave his
<PB REF="323"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="311" REF="324"/>
own name to the whole region, and constructed that fortress
which he called Rhaetia Ima, since corrupted into Retzuns.
Livy relates the emigration of the Tuscans into these parts
without mentioning the name of their leader, who is called
Rhaetus by Pliny and Justin; and the number of places still
existing in these alps, which bear a resemblance to that appel∣lation,
seem strong testimonies in favour of this account.</P>
<P>BUT as events of such high antiquity will always be liable
to much doubt, let us descend to later times, which admit
of no dispute. The castle was the residence of a baron,
who possessed the adjacent territory, and was called Baron of
Retzuns. His name frequently occurs in the ancient history
of this country, when the territory of the Grisons was divided
into several petty sovereignties. He is also mentioned among
the chiefs, who assembled in 1424 at Truns, and confirmed
and enlarged the privileges of the people, when the several
communities united and formed the Grey League. At that
time the baron reserved to himself certain prerogatives,
which are now possessed by his successors. In 1459, the
male line being extinct, the barony descended to a collateral
branch, and in 1470 came by purchase into the possession
of the emperor Maximilian the First. Ferdinand the First
mortgaged the barony for 14, 000 florins to John Planta, in
whose family it continued until the year 1679, when it was
redeemed by the emperor Leopold, and it now belongs to
his grand-daughter Maria Teresa, the present empress<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The empress was alive when this letter was written: on her decease it descended to Joseph II. and since his death to Leopold II. and Francis II.</NOTE>.
<PB N="312" REF="325"/>
The revenues of this territory are very small, amounting
to 2, 000 florins, or scarcely £. 200 <HI>per ann.;</HI> but by the pos∣session
of it the House of Austria enjoys considerable in∣fluence
in the political affairs of the Grisons. The delegate
of the empress, who is called Administrator, has a vote in
the diet of Truns, and nominates every third year the <HI>Land∣richter,</HI>
or Chief of the Grey League.</P>
<P>BEING desirous of seeing the castle, I sent my compli∣ments
to the Austrian delegate, who instantly made his ap∣pearance,
and politely attended me round the castle. The
present building was raised by Leopold, upon the foundation
of the ancient structure, of which there are scarcely any
remains. I could not, upon the closest inspection, discern
the slightest traces of Roman workmanship. This castle is
the usual residence of the Austrian Envoy to the Republic of
the Grisons; but as the present envoy dwells in his own
house at Reichenau, it is now occupied by the Austrian de∣legate.
It is situated upon an eminence, and commands a
fine view of the adjacent country. The rich plain, which
extends as far as Reichenau, is bounded on all sides by high
mountains, and yields, among other productions, abun∣dance
of wheat. The Lower Rhine flows through it in a
wide and stony channel.</P>
<P>THE delegate finding, during our conversation, that I had
a letter of recommendation from Count Firmian to the
Austrian Envoy at Reichenau, invited me to dinner, and
politely offered to accompany me in the afternoon to Reiche∣nau;
an invitation which I made no scruple to accept. The
<PB N="313" REF="326"/>
company at table consisted of the administrator, his wife,
and a capuchin friar. The lady spoke nothing but Romansh;
I was not able to enjoy much of her conversation; could only
drink her health, and make her a short compliment, which
I had learned by rote. But I held a long conversation, in the
French tongue, with the administrator, upon the barony of
Retzuns, on which subject he kindly gave me the following
information. As delegate of the empress of Germany, he
has a kind of territorial jurisdiction over the village and
district of Retzuns. The barony of Retzuns comprises the
villages of Retzuns, Bonadutz, Embs, and Feldsberg, which
form a High Jurisdiction in the Grey League, and send two
deputies to the general diet of the Grisons; the people are
free; they assemble annually in the court of the castle to
elect their magistrates, when every male at the age of four∣teen
has a vote. The delegate nominates the Landamman
from three candidates appointed by the people: the empress
receives the fines for criminal offences, and pays the expences
of the process; the prisoners are confined in the castle, but
are tried by judges chosen by the people.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner I accompanied my host through a rich and
fertile plain to Reichenau, and waited upon Mr. Buol, the
Austrian envoy, who received me with great attention and
politeness; and obligingly invited me to remain some time
at Reichenau: an invitation I declined for the present, through
my impatience of arriving at Coire, where I expected to
receive several letters from my friends in England, from
whom I had not heard since my departure from Milan. Reiche∣nau
is situated upon the conflux of the two branches which
<PB N="314" REF="327"/>
form the Rhine. The lower branch is the same which I fol∣lowed
during the greatest part of its course from Splugen;
the upper branch rises near the mountain of St. Gothard,
and flows through the valley of Sopra Selva. The castle, or
house of Mr. Buol, is placed in a most romantic situation
upon a small eminence, a little above the junction, and the
garden advances to the Rhine. At this place there are two
bridges, which were built by the nephew of Grubenman,
that deserve particular notice; one, which is thrown across
the lower branch of the Rhine, measured thirty-five paces,
or about a hundred and five feet. The second is built across
the Rhine below the point of union, and forms a most beau∣tiful
object. It is a wooden bridge of a single arch, covered
like that of Schaffhausen, and constructed upon the same
plan, with this difference however, that the road is not
carried in so perfect a level. The span of the arch is two
hundred and twenty feet in length. As the banks of the
Rhine in this spot are more elevated than those of the same
river at Schaffhausen, the bridge of Reichenau is raised con∣siderably
higher above the surface of the water than that of
Schaffhausen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 2. p. 6.</NOTE>. And as it presents also to the eye but a
single curve, its general appearance is far more picturesque,
and its effect more striking. But it is not near so beautiful
a piece of architecture as the bridge of Wettingen, which
is Grubenman's master-piece<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Letter 13.</NOTE>. The more I examine these
bridges, the more I am struck with the sublime simplicity
of the structure; the more I am astonished, that the person
who first conceived the plan was a common carpenter, totally
<PB REF="328"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="315" REF="329"/>
unacquainted with the theory of mechanics, and indebted
to a natural genius for having carried practical architecture
to such perfection. In my way from Reichenau to Coire I
stopped at Embs, in order to inquire if there are any remains
of an old castle, in which William, son of Tancred king of
Sicily, was confined. At present there is not the smallest
vestige of such a fabric; but according to the tradition of
the country it formerly stood upon a hill, whereon the
church is now erected.</P>
<P>THE valley from Reichenau to Coire is about two miles
broad, and produces corn, pasture, and some vines, which
begin to make their appearance near Embs. The Rhine
flows through it with the rapidity of a torrent. Several in∣sulated
rocks are scattered on the banks of the river, some
barren, others covered with wood, which greatly diversify
the scenery. The chain of mountains fronting the northern
aspect is overspread with groves of fir, while the opposite
ridge is richly clothed for some way with oaks, and its sum∣mits
crowned with firs and pines. A little way beyond I
entered the League of the House of God, and arrived in
good time at Coire.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LEAGUE OF GOD'S HOUSE—TOWN AND BISHOPRIC
OF COIRE—CONVENT OF ST. LUCIUS.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole territory, which is now comprised within
the League of the House of God, was under the
dominion of the bishop of Coire, until the people, oppressed
by their rulers, threw off the yoke, and having formed a
general league, compelled the bishop to ratify their inde∣pendence.
The aera of this important revolution is not
precisely marked in the annals of this country. Some histo∣rians
have even asserted, that it happened so early as the
latter end of the fourteenth century, and was anterior to the
formation of the Grey League. But this opinion does not
seem to be grounded upon sufficient evidence; as the facts
alledged in its support intimate little more than that the
bishop granted several immunities to the inhabitants, but
by no means prove, that the communities formed them∣selves
into a league at such an early period, and afforded the
<HI>first</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Campell espouses this notion, and his authority undoubtedly carries great weight: but we must consider that he grounds his opinion merely upon conjecture, and that, as a member of the League of God's House, he was inclined to give to that League the preference in point of antiquity over the Grey League.</NOTE> example of liberty in these parts. For that honour is
undoubtedly due to the Grey League. This revolution,
which finally exalted the league into its present state of
freedom, probably took place between 1424, the aera of the
<PB N="317" REF="331"/>
formation of the Grey League, and 1436, the year in which
the Ten Jurisdictions rose into independence.</P>
<P>This league is denominated in Romansh <HI>La Ligia de la
Chiada</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chiada,</HI> or as it is sometimes written, <HI>Ca-de,</HI> signifies cathedral. Hence the French call it <HI>La Ligue Cadd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE>; in German, <HI>Gottshausbund,</HI> from which we call it
the <HI>League of the House of God:</HI> it takes this appellation as
well from the cathedral situated in its capital, as from having
once been under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Coire. It
is divided into eleven districts; each of which (Coire except∣ed)
is subdivided into two little republics, or communities.
By this arrangement the league comprehends twenty-one
republics<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Introduction.</NOTE>, and sends twenty-two deputies to the general
diet.</P>
<P>FORMERLY the burgomaster of Coire was perpetual chief
of the league without election, but in the latter end of the
last century the other communities claimed a power of no∣minating
to this office in their turn. The affair being refer∣red
to the arbitration of Zuric, it was decided, that for the
future the twenty-two deputies of this league should choose
two candidates from the members of the senate of Coire;
and that these two candidates should draw lots for the
charge: a mode of election which is now in use. The chief
thus appointed is called <HI>Bunds-president,</HI> and has several
privileges which distinguish him from the chiefs of the two
other leagues. He receives all the letters addressed to the
Republic of the Grisons from foreign powers, and is also
<PB N="318" REF="332"/>
perpetual president of the Congress, because that assembly is
always held at Coire.</P>
<P>COIRE is situated at the foot of the Alps, in a rich plain
between two or three miles wide; a considerable breadth of
valley for this mountainous country. Opposite is the chain
of mountains which separate the country of the Grisons
from the canton of Glarus: of this chain the Calendar is
esteemed the highest point; but it is far inferior in elevation
to several of the Swiss and Savoy Alps I visited in my last
tour, and wants one certain criterion of great height, perpe∣tual
snow. The town lies partly in the plain, and partly
upon the steep side of a rock, and is surrounded with ancient
brick walls, with square and round towers, in the style of
fortification prior to the invention of powder. The streets
are narrow and dirty. Several towns of Upper Engadina,
although not so large, make a neater and more elegant ap∣pearance.
It contains about three thousand souls.</P>
<P>MANY fables are related concerning the foundation of
Coire: the most probable account seems to be, that it owes
its origin to the emperor Constantius, who, in the 355th
year of the Christian aera, penetrated into Rhetia, and fixed
his station for some time near the spot where Coire now
stands. A town, as it often happened on such occasions,
was perhaps constructed near the camp; and from the im∣perial
residence it is supposed to have derived the name
<HI>Curia,</HI> its ancient appellation, since corrupted into <HI>Coira</HI>
and <HI>Coire.</HI> The remains of two or three towers, which are
evidently of Roman construction, attest its antiquity, and
<PB N="319" REF="333"/>
serve to establish the truth of these conjectures concerning
its origin. The town of Coire was formerly a city of
the German empire, under the dominion of its own counts,
and came in the ninth century under the jurisdiction of the
bishop. Like many other cities of Germany, it obtained
considerable privileges from the different emperors; and
the inhabitants, having gradually circumscribed the autho∣rity
of the bishop, at length established an independent
republic.</P>
<P>THE government of Coire is of a mixed form, partly
aristocratical, partly democratical. The supreme legislative
authority resides in the citizens, whose number amounts to
two hundred and ninety-four, divided into five tribes.
Each citizen has a voice at the age of twenty. The suffrages
are never collected in a meeting of the whole body of the
people assembled together in one spot; but the object of de∣liberation
is separately laid before each tribe, and is decided
by the majority of the five tribes. The executive power is
entrusted to the council of seventy, composed of fourteen
members annually elected from each tribe. This sovereign
council is divided into several lesser departments, of which
the principal is the senate, or council of fifteen, who have
the chief direction of affairs, either solely or conjointly with
other members of the sovereign council. The chiefs of
Coire are two burgomasters taken from the members of the
senate, who, although liable to be removed, invariably con∣tinue
in office for life. These two magistrates enjoy the
supreme dignity by rotation, each for the space of a year;
during which term the acting chief, under the title of
<PB N="320" REF="334"/>
reigning burgomaster, presides in the usual councils. The
criminal tribunal is composed of the senate and fifteen other
members of the sovereign council. The prisoners are ex∣amined
and the process made out by the secret council,
formed of the seven oldest members of the senate. The
majority of these seven must concur, to order the infliction
of torture. After examination and conviction, the acts of
the process are laid before the criminal tribunal, which ul∣timately
passes sentence; and all offences, excepting great
crimes, are commonly punished by fines.</P>
<P>My curiosity led me this morning to the apartment in
which the general diet of the Grisons is held every three
years; although it contained no object worthy of description,
yet it did not fail to strike my attention, as being the place
where the parliament of a free nation is assembled. Coire
sends two deputies to this diet, who are generally the two
burgomasters; but if one of these should be chief of the
league, the other deputy is chosen by rotation in the five
tribes, with this condition, that he must be a member of the
council of seventy.</P>
<P>FROM the apartment in which the diet is held I went to
the town-hall, in order to see the form of administering the
oath to the new <HI>Bunds-president.</HI> In general the ceremony
takes place just before the meeting of the diet, in the pre∣sence
of the deputies of the League of God's House; but as
the person to whom the office now devolves was not present
at the diet, it was necessarily postponed. All the parties
being assembled, Mr. Tscharner, the last president, with the
<PB N="321" REF="335"/>
public notary, stood at the upper end of the room; the gen∣tleman
appointed to succeed him stood at the lower end, with
the <HI>Bunds-weiber,</HI> or secretary, dressed in a cloak half black
and half white, the livery of the League. Mr. Tscharner ad∣dressed
to his successor a speech of about ten minutes, in
German, acquainting him, that he was appointed by the de∣puties
of the League Bunds-president for the ensuing year,
giving him joy of his promotion, and congratulating the
League upon the nomination of a person so well calculated
by his integrity and abilities to fulfil the duties of the office.
At the conclusion of this speech, the public notary read the
oaths for the president, for himself, and the secretary. Mr.
Tscharner then told them to hold up three fingers of their
right-hand, and to repeat after him their several oaths;
which ceremony being concluded, the new president made a
short speech, that he was highly flattered with the honour
conferred upon him, and that he would strive, as far as his
abilities would permit him, to promote the welfare of the
League of which he had been elected president. Then the
former president bowing to the new chief, the latter walked
first out of the room; and thus ended the ceremony.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that although in the nomination of the
magistrates, president, and deputies, the aristocratical party
has the entire direction, yet that the appointment to the vacant
governments of the subject provinces should be left wholly
to chance. When the turn belongs to Coire, the five tribes
meet separately, and a candidate is appointed by lot from
each tribe. These five persons then draw lots for the office,
and the successful candidate may sell the turn; with this re∣striction,
<PB N="322" REF="336"/>
that the preference of purchasing it shall be given
first to a member of the same tribe, secondly to any citizen
of Coire, thirdly to an inhabitant of the League of God's
House. It frequently happens, that the five persons, who
are to draw lots for the government, agree to divide the
profits of the sale.</P>
<P>UPON the highest part of the town stands the bishop's pa∣lace,
the cathedral, and the houses belonging to the chapter.
The bishopric of Coire is very antient, and was probably
erected soon after the first establishment of Christianity in
these parts under Constantine, or his son. This diocese once
extended over the whole Roman province of Rhetia, which
comprehended the present country of the Grisons, Valteline,
Chiavenna, and Bormio, the eastern district of Switzerland as
far as the lake of Constance, and part of Tyrol. The bishop's
territorial possessions were also considerable, and his revenues
by no means inadequate to his power and dignity. It would
be uninteresting to trace the diminution of his authority,
and the gradual annihilation of his jurisdiction over the
town of Coire, and the commonwealths of this League. I
shall therefore observe, that his authority was principally
lessened by the formation of the League of God's House,
and the limitation of his prerogatives in 1527: by the
former he was compelled to ratify the independence of the
communities; by the latter the principal prerogatives, from
which he derived great influence in the political affairs of
the Grisons, were at once annihilated; and he was reduced
to the condition of a private person, in that country wherein
he had formerly been considered as a sovereign prince.
<PB N="323" REF="337"/>
These privileges consisted in having admission, and a voice
in the general diet of the Grisons; in appointing several de∣puties
for the same assembly; in nominating the chief ma∣gistrates
of several communities; and in receiving appeals in
civil causes from the decision of the provincial courts of jus∣tice.
All these prerogatives were abrogated by a general
diet of the Grisons in 1527; and the few remaining rights
have been either purchased or taken away. The introduc∣tion
of the Protestant religion gave the final blow to his
power; for his revenue suffered great diminution by the loss
of the tythes, which were seized by the reformed com∣munities.</P>
<P>THE bishop is prince of the Roman empire; a dignity
annexed to the see in 1170, by the emperor Frederic the
First, and is styled Lord of Furstenberg and Furstenau. His
annual revenues, which amount to about £. 2, 000, arise
chiefly from estates near Coire, and in the Tyrol. He re∣ceives
also the annual sum of about £. 70 from the customs
of Chiavenna, in return for having ceded his right over the
Valteline, Chiavenna, and Bormio, to the Republic of the
three leagues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 242.</NOTE>. The only prerogatives remaining are the
right of coining money, and an absolute jurisdiction both in
civil and criminal affairs within the small district in which
his palace and the chapter are situated. Beyond this district
he enjoys not the least power: so far from interfering in the
affairs of the town, he could not even enter it if the inhabi∣tants
chose to exclude him; a right which they asserted in
<PB N="324" REF="338"/>
1764, upon the following occasion. A Catholic, in order to
avoid being arrested for a crime of which he had been guilty,
took refuge from the hands of justice in the cathedral. The
inhabitants, inflamed by the bishop's refusal to deliver him
up, raised a gate close to the only opening which leads into
the episcopal district; by which means the avenue to the
palace was closed: this manoeuvre conquered the bishop's
obstinacy, and the criminal was delivered up. The gate still
exists, and is ready to be used upon another occasion.</P>
<P>THE bishop is chosen by the chapter. Many disputes re∣lating
to his election have arisen between the canons and
the League of God's House: the latter, in virtue of a treaty
contracted in 1541 with the bishop, protests, that only a na∣tive
of the League can be promoted to the see. This treaty
was observed until 1692, when a foreigner was elected; from
that period the canons have disregarded the right asserted by
the League, and have without reserve given their votes to
aliens: at every new election the League remonstrates, but
without effect. The present bishop is Francis Dionysius, of
the ancient family of Rost in the Tyrol.</P>
<P>THIS episcopal district is only a few hundred paces in cir∣cumference,
and is surrounded by high walls. The only
object of curiosity is a square tower, which forms part of the
bishop's palace, and is supposed to have been constructed by
the Romans. It is of strong but clumsy workmanship, and
is in no degree entitled to notice, except as a monument of
antiquity. The cathedral contains the bones of St. Lucius,
richly ornamented after the fashion of Roman Catholic
<PB N="325" REF="339"/>
relics. The chapter consists of twenty-four canons, of
whom six are resident. The inhabitants of this district are
all Catholics.</P>
<P>ABOVE the palace, and upon the highest extremity of the
town, is the convent of St. Lucius. It takes its name from
a small chapel dedicated to that saint, who, according to the
legends of the Romish church, was a king of England in the
latter end of the second century. Having embraced Christi∣anity,
and being inflamed with religious zeal, he quitted his
throne, and wandering into these parts built an hermitage
upon the spot where his chapel now stands, and by his
preaching and example converted numbers to a belief of the
gospel. He is styled the apostle of the Grisons, and is greatly
revered as a saint by the Catholics, while the Protestants of
the town pay him not the least veneration. Burnet, in his
Travels, relates, that he endeavoured “<HI>to shew the good old
bishop that the legend of Lucius was a fable in all the parts of
it, but most remarkable in that which related to the Grisons;
and that we had no kings in Britain at that time, but were a
province to the Romans; that no ancient authors speak of it,
Bede being the first that mentions it; and that the pretended
letter to pope Eleutherius, together with his answer, has evident
characters of forgery in it. All this,</HI> he adds, <HI>signified nothing
to the bishop, who assured me that they had a tradition of that
in their church, and it was inserted in their Breviary, which he
firmly believed.</HI>”</P>
<P>WELL aware, that my endeavours to convince the monk<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the falsity of the legend would have ended as unsuccess∣fully
<PB N="326" REF="340"/>
as the reasoning of Burnet, I did not imitate his ex∣ample;
but without entering into the merits or demerits of
the story, contented myself with admiring the beautiful
prospect, which was the motive that induced me to visit the
convent. The environs of Coire are delightful. The plain
is richly diversified with corn and pasture; the hills gra∣dually
sloping to the foot of the mountains are covered with
vines, which yield wine of an agreeable flavour, but not
strong. The points of view vary suprisingly, from agree∣able
to romantic, from romantic to wild. The Rhine, which
flows rapidly through the plain, about the distance of a mile,
begins here to be navigable by rafts, and merchandise is
transported toward Lindau and Zuric.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 83.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CASTLE OF HALDENSTEIN—SEMINARY OF
LITERATURE.</HEAD>
<P>I RODE this evening, in company with two gentlemen of
Coire, who have favoured me with great marks of atten∣tion
and politeness, to Haldenstein, which may be called the
smallest sovereignty in Europe. We passed along the side
of the hills, and at the bottom of the rugged rocks which
lead to the League of the Ten Jurisdictions; and enjoyed
the whole way a fine view of the rich plain, stretching from
the town of Coire as far as Embs. The beautiful verdure
of the meadows, the sloping hills clothed with vines, the
craggy mountains, partly covered with vines, partly over∣spread
with wood, and partly bare, formed altogether a
striking prospect. We crossed the Rhine to Haldenstein, a
small village consisting of about sixty houses, and proceeded
to the house occupied by the present baron, Rhodolph de
Salis, who received me with great politeness, and kindly in∣dulged
my curiosity, by shewing me his little territory, and
answering my inquiries with great readiness and exactness.
The baron, a gentleman of considerable learning and inde∣fatigable
industry, has formed a large collection of manu∣scripts
relative to the Grisons, from which he has drawn
ample materials for a publication, in which he is at present
engaged. His researches are chiefly biographical; and his
<PB N="328" REF="342"/>
work is intended to illustrate the memoirs of the principal
persons, who have rendered themselves conspicuous among
the Grisons by their actions and abilities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>This work is announced as not yet finished, in Haller's</HI> Schweitzer-Bibliothek, <HI>vol. II. p.</HI> 364, <HI>under the following titles:</HI> 1. Rhaetia Illustrata, contenant l'histoire ou les principaux évenemens de la vie des Hommes célébres qui ont paru au pais des Grisons. 2. Rhaetia Literaria, ou Catalogue de tous les auteurs Grisons, de leur vie, et de leurs ouvrages.</P>
<P>The baron is since dead, and I have not heard that these works have been published.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the barony of Haldenstein, he informed
me, that it was formerly under the protection of the seven
ancient cantons of Switzerland; that since the year 1568, it
has been an independent sovereignty, under the protection
of the three leagues; that in the middle of the sixteenth
century it was possessed in right of marriage by John de
Castron, French ambassador to the Republic of the Grisons,
and at his death, in 1565, came into the family of Schauen∣stein:
that the male line being extinct, it was divided be∣tween
two females of the collateral branches, one of whom
married a de Salis, and the other an Hartmannis. In the
beginning of this century the descendants of de Salis
purchased the other half, and again reunited it under one
person.</P>
<P>THE whole barony consists of a small semicircular plain,
which lies between the Rhine and the bottom of the Calendar,
about five miles in length, and scarcely one in breadth. It oc∣cupies
also part of the mountain, which is so steep as not to
be inhabited. It contains only two villages, that of Halden∣stein
and Sewils, and the whole number of subjects amount
<PB N="329" REF="343"/>
to no more than between three and four hundred. The
people were serfs or vassals, until the year 1701, when the
grandfather of the present baron gave to them several im∣munities.
At present the lord has territorial jurisdiction;
the exclusive privilege of hunting and fishing; a claim
of two days work annually from each of his subjects, and a
load of dung from each peasant. He appoints the judge in
the criminal court, receives the fines for offences, from
which he pays the expences of the process, and has the
power of pardoning. He nominates the president, and part
of the jury in civil causes, and in all cases of appeal judges in
the last resort. The baron shewed me several coins struck
by his predecessors: the most ancient was a gold piece of
1611, the year in which the emperor Matthias conferred the
right of coining money upon the baron of Haldenstein; a
privilege which he still enjoys.</P>
<P>THE ancient castle of Haldenstein, from which the barons
took their title, is now in ruins; but its remains are still vi∣sible
upon the sides of the mountain: above it is another
ruined castle called Lichtenstein, which was formerly inha∣bited
by an ancestor of prince Lichtenstein of Vienna, and
from which he is said to derive his title. The prince is so
convinced of his descent from the ancient possessors of this
castle, and so proud of their antiquity, that he was at the ex∣pence
of procuring a stone from these ruins, for the founda∣tion
stone of a superb palace which he has built at Vienna,
that it might be said to contain some materials of the origi∣nal
castle in which his ancestors once resided. The present
<PB N="330" REF="344"/>
house, occupied by the baron of Haldenstein, was built
in 1545, by James de Castrio; it is pleasantly situated near
the Rhine, and commands a fine view of the town of Coire,
and the adjacent country.</P>
<P>A FEW years ago the castle of Haldenstein was converted
into a seminary for the education of youth. An enquiry into
the origin of this institution, and the cause of its subsequent
decline, has led me to gain some insight into the general
state of literature in this country. It had long been a serious
cause of complaint, that in the whole country of the Grisons
there was no public seminary for completing the education
of youth; and that all who followed any of the learned pro∣fessions
were obliged to repair to foreign academies. M. de
Salis of Marchlins, and some other persons of the first conse∣quence
among the Grisons, considering this defect a disgrace
to their country, projected a plan for the institution of an
academy; and having obtained the ratification of the general
diet, which assembled at Davos in 1761, carried it into im∣mediate
execution at their own expence, with a zeal for lite∣rature
which reflects the highest honour upon their exer∣tions.
The plan was extensive and useful, and seemed well
calculated to secure success: for a short time it wore a flou∣rishing
appearance; but this prosperous beginning was not
succeeded by any beneficial consequences. Its decline was owing
to the little countenance given to literature; was hastened by
quarrels which arose between the professors; and in 1779,
within the space of fifteen years from its first establishment,
the institution was dissolved.</P>

THE general state of literature among the Grisons is at a
very low ebb. One of the most learned men in this country,
and who would be far from depreciating the knowledge of
his countrymen without sufficient foundation, thus ex∣presses
himself upon this head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Rhaetia nostra rerum administratio omnium a plebe dependet, cujus numerus potior non nisi quae ante nasum sunt, aut lucrum ad∣serunt, sapit, quicquid de reliquo agatur, lit∣teras politiores, cum omni gloria et commodis quae ex illis subsequuntur, quasi rejicienda contemnit; nullum carum professoribus pre∣mium, nullum meritum, laudem nullum tri∣buit; sic ut qui litteras ament, et excolant, ex generoso quopiam animi impetu id agant, sepa∣sito omni alio fine, et absque ullo ad cas calcari. Et his tamen non obstantibus, reperti et apud Nos qui generosi ediderunt pectoris documenta; reperti etiam, qui scientiarum culturam, ac amorem quibusvis aliis praetulerunt, licet il∣lorum labores ac memoria sere cum ipsis inte∣reat, nec sit qui eam ab interitu vindicet.

affairs is entirely in the hands of the people, the greatest part
considering nothing but their own profit, despise every spe∣cies
of polite learning, and are unwilling to allow any sala∣ries,
or bestow any honours upon the professors; so that all
persons who cultivate the sciences are incited merely by the
love of glory, and a disinterested zeal.” If this is the case,
it would be chimerical to expect the arts and sciences to
flourish in an ungrateful soil, where they meet with no en∣couragement:
but even amidst these obstacles to improve∣ment,
there have never been wanting, and there still are
to be found, men of superior souls, who have dedicated
their time to the cultivation of letters; and who merit the
highest praise, for labouring in the vineyard without hopes
of profit.</P>
<P>THE Protestants who receive a liberal education repair
for the most part to Zuric or Basle, and the Catholics to
Milan, Pavia, or Vienna. Each community has a small
<PB N="332" REF="346"/>
school, in which the children are taught to write, read, and
cast accounts; but which is only open in winter from the
9th of November to the 7th of March. Those parents who
wish to give their children a better education, and who can
support the expence, must either send them to foreign
parts, or have a private tutor at home. There is a Latin se∣minary
at Coire for the children of the burghers, and
another, instituted in 1763, for the education of persons in∣tended
for the church; and although these establishments
are poorly endowed, yet they have been productive of some
literary advantages to the country. There is also a typogra∣phical
society at Coire for Latin, German, and Romansh:
books in the latter tongue are also printed in the Lower En∣gadina,
and at Disentis.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LEAGUE OF TEN JURISDICTIONS—FATZEROL—BATHS
OF ALVENEW—DAVOS—VALLEY OF PRE∣TIGAU—MALANTZ—MAYENFIELD—BATHS OF
PFEFFERS.</HEAD>
<P>I QUITTED Coire yesterday morning, in order to make an
excursion into the League of the Ten Jurisdictions; but
before I proceed in my account of this expedition, I shall
send you a short abstract of this league, from its first founda∣tion
to its perfect independency. This league ought pro∣perly
to be called, and indeed is not unfrequently denomi∣nated
in this country, the League of the <HI>Eleven</HI> Jurisdic∣tions,
from the number of communities of which it is
composed; but as upon its first union it was formed of ten
jurisdictions, it still retains its original appellation, although
one of the jurisdictions has been since that period subdi∣vided
into two.</P>
<P>THE territory of this league was formerly under the do∣minion
of the barons of Vats, whose authority was limited,
as the people possessed very considerable privileges. Upon
the death of Donatus, the last baron, the count of Togge∣burg,
who had married his eldest daughter, succeeded to his
possessions; and Frederic, one of his descendants, dying in
1436 without issue, the several communities united, formed
an offensive and defensive alliance, and erected themselves
<PB N="334" REF="348"/>
into a league. But although by this alliance they increased
their immunities, yet they were by no means perfectly inde∣pendent;
for the male heirs of the count of Toggeburg ob∣tained
the lordship over these jurisdictions, after having
confirmed all their privileges, and added others. Afterwards
Sigismond, archduke of Austria and count of Tyrol, pur∣chased
the baronial rights. Upon his death they devolved
to his heir, Maximilian the First, and the successors of that
emperor. These prerogatives consisted in the appointment,
in several of the communities, of the criminal judge, in the
power of pardoning, in receiving part of the fines, in nomi∣nating
the principal magistrates from three candidates, and
in other similar privileges, which gave to the House of
Austria considerable influence in the interior admini∣stration
of affairs. These rights, exercised by means of a
governor who resided at Castels, but who could not be ap∣pointed
without the concurrence of the league, were gra∣dually
annihilated, either by purchase or concession; the
several communities became entirely independent; and this
independence was solemnly ratified by the emperor Ferdi∣nand
the Third, soon after the peace of Westphalia.</P>
<P>AFTER about half an hour's ascent from Coire, I entered
the League of the Ten Jurisdictions near Malix; passed
along the vale, and through the community of Churwalden,
in which the hamlets lie prettily scattered about the plain,
and upon the sides of the mountains. I made a small circuit
in order to pass through the village of Fatzerol, which con∣sists
only of five or six houses, and stands at the bottom of
some very high and rugged mountains; it is celebrated in
<PB N="335" REF="349"/>
the history of the Grisons as being the place where, in 1471,
the first perpetual alliance was ratified by the deputies of
the three leagues. I was accompanied to the spot by one of
the principal inhabitants, who was not displeased with the
enthusiasm I testified at beholding the birth-place of their
liberties. The house is now in ruins, and the apartment
which was remarkable for the meeting of the deputies no
longer remains. Having, with the assistance of my com∣panion,
traced its site, I considered with respect the spot
which was once sanctified by the ratification of the general
union; lamented that so venerable a pile of building should
be suffered to fall into decay; and felt disappointment, that
there was no inscription by public authority, in order to
consign to posterity the date of the transaction, and to con∣secrate
the place which had been witness to an event the
most memorable in the annals of this country.</P>
<P>HAVING satisfied my curiosity in viewing these re∣spectable
remains, I descended through Brientz to the baths
of Alvenew. The source which gives celebrity to Alvenew
is sulphureous, and resembles both in smell and taste the
waters of Harrowgate. The situation of these baths is highly
romantic, by the side of the torrent Albula, at the bottom of
the majestic Alps. Having passed through Alvenew and
Anderwisen, I mounted a very steep rugged ascent through a
thick forest, and then pursued a narrow path upon the side
of a rock called Zug, over a steep precipice, with a torrent
flowing beneath. This rock is mostly bare, excepting a few
stubbed sirs, the remains of a forest which was formerly de∣stroyed
by fire; hence it is called the <HI>Burnt Wood,</HI> and exhi∣bits
<PB N="336" REF="350"/>
a most desolate appearance. At the bottom of this rock,
close to the torrent, are mines of silver, which were formerly
worked. I entered the jurisdiction of Davos at the village of
Glarus, and took up my lodging in a neat cottage.</P>
<P>THE district of Davos is a long plain, about a quarter of a
mile broad, gradually rising into hills, which terminate in
high mountains. It is not unlike the valley of Upper Enga∣dina,
but is more fertile. Near the church of St. John there
is a small cluster of eight or ten houses contiguous to each
other: in the other parts the cottages are thickly strewed
over the plain, and upon the gentle acclivities, as in the can∣ton
of Appenzel, each with its little territory. The coun∣try
produces oats, rye, large quantities of rich pasture, and
yields two crops of hay in one season. It is now the second
harvest, and the fields are covered with mowers. The bor∣dering
mountains are overspread to their summits with
forests of fir and larch, intermixed with meadows: above
them tower the rugged Alps. A clear murmuring stream
flows through the midst of the plain, with a gentle though
lively course; its banks prettily ornamented with scattered
cottages, which are remarkably neat and commodious.
Some are built of trees piled one upon another; others have
stone foundations, and the upper part of wood; others are
constructed with stone plaistered and white-washed. I
walked to the valley of Diesma, leading to Scampf in Upper
Engadina, which is closed at some distance by a high
mountain covered with snow, said to be one of the most ele∣vated
in the country of the Grisons. It is called the Swart-Horn,
and is part of the Scaletta Alps, which communicates
<PB N="337" REF="351"/>
with the Julian Alps, the Set, and the chain that separates
the Valteline from Upper Engadina and Pregalia. Close to
my inn is the town-house, in which the deputies composing
the general diet of the Grisons are assembled every three
years. It is also the place of meeting for the deputies of this
league, who assemble annually in the month of May, for the
choice of the <HI>Bunds Landamman,</HI> or chief of the league, and
for the transacting of any particular business. It is plain
and simple, like the people themselves.</P>
<P>THE form of government established in this district of
Davos is similar to that of the small cantons of Switzerland,
and is entirely democratical. The people must be assembled
upon all extraordinary occasions, such as enacting new laws,
deciding upon appeals from the general diet, and raising
money. Every male at the age of fourteen has a vote. The
whole collective body of the people, however, do not meet in
order to chuse their magistrates, who are elected from depu∣ties
sent by each district. The administration of affairs resides
in the great council of eighty-two, and the council of fifteen,
which is included in the former. The great council regu∣lates
all affairs relating to finance; the fifteen superintend
the police, and are judges in the civil and criminal courts of
justice without appeal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that through the whole League of the Ten Jurisdictions there is no appeal from the decision of the civil courts of justice, excepting in the community of Alvenew. The inhabitants of that place being Catholic and Protestant, there lies an appeal to the civil tribunal ei∣ther of Churwalden or of Davos.</NOTE>. In criminal cases torture cannot
be inflicted without permission of the great council. The
Landamman is elected every two years, and is president of
<PB N="338" REF="352"/>
both these councils. This remote corner has produced se∣veral
persons eminent in literature; and particularly the
two historians of the Grisons, Guler and Sprecher.</P>
<P>JOHN GULER was born 1562, and died in 1637, at a very
advanced age. He was remarkable for his multifarious
knowledge; and published, in 1616, in the German tongue,
“an account of the three Grison Leagues, and other Rhe∣tian
people.” In this work, much esteemed by the natives,
the author gives a circumstantial detail of the origin of the
antient Rhetians, and of their emigration from Tuscany into
this country under their leader Rhaetus; traces their subse∣quent
history under the Romans, and in the dark ages, to
the beginning of the fifteenth century, when the union of
the three leagues was established. Guler has illustrated the
history of ancient and modern Rhetia by wooden engravings
of medals, towns, and battles; genealogical tables, coats of
arms, and maps; which, though rude, are curious for their
antiquity. The author had also meditated a second volume,
on the union of the three leagues, on the topography and
history of the whole country, and on the transactions of his
own times. For this part of the work Guler was eminently
qualified; as well from his extensive erudition, and for hav∣ing
carefully digested Campel's account of the Grisons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 73.</NOTE>, as
from the various offices to which he was raised both in
the civil and military line, and the repeated embassies
and negociations in which he was employed. It is,
however, uncertain whether this part was ever finished;
<PB N="339" REF="353"/>
and if finished, it is probably lost: as Mr. Aporta has
searched for it without success in the libraries and among
the manuscripts of his countrymen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Aporta Hist. Refor. Ecc. Raet. Praefat.—Haller, in his Schweit▪ Bib. N<SUP>o</SUP> 814. says, that it was already prepared for the press, but was unfortunately burnt.</NOTE> The deficiency of this
valuable performance, however, is fortunately supplied by
Fortunatus Sprecher, the contemporary, friend, and relation,
of Guler. Sprecher was born in 1584; and in 1617 gave to
the world <HI>Pallas Rhaetica armata et togata;</HI> or the military
and civil history of the Grisons from the earliest ages to the
aera in which the book was published. In this work, which
is a model for method and perspicuity, the author gives the
national history, in ten books. The first contains the emi∣gration
of the Tuscans, their settlement in this country, the
description of the antient Rhetians, and their transactions to
the time of Augustus. The second comprises the period
from the Augustan aera to the establishment of the empire of
the Franks. The third treats of the Grisons under the em∣pires
of the Franks and Germans, till 1476. The fourth details
the wars of the Grisons; namely, the Swabian war against
Maximilian the First, and the campaigns against James of
Medici, from 1525 to 1531. The fifth comprises the wars in
which the Grisons were engaged under the standards of
foreign powers. The sixth relates the union and political
state of the three leagues, and their alliances with the Swiss
and other powers. The seventh, eighth, and ninth, sepa∣rately
describe the Grey League; the bishopric of Coire, and
the League of God's House; and the League of Ten Juris∣dictions.
<PB N="340" REF="354"/>
The tenth concludes with an account of the Val∣teline,
Chiavenna, and Bormio. A second volume, which
appeared in 1629, under the title of, <HI>Historia Motuum et
Bellorum postremis hisce annis in Rhetia excitatorum et gesto∣rum,</HI>
relates the wars and troubles of the Grisons from 1617
to 1629; a period of turbulence and discord. A third
volume continued the history of the Grisons from 1627 to a
short time before the author's death, which happened in
1647; but has never been given to the public.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the extremity of the beautiful valley of Davos
is a small lake, about four miles in circumference, which is
remarkably deep and clear, and abounds with excellent
trout. It lies at the foot of the mountains, and supplies a
small stream, which being joined by one from the valley of
Flola, and by another from that of Diesma, forms the mur∣muring
brook that waters the valley of Davos, and falls into
the Albula above the baths of Alvenew: it is considered by
some writers as forming a source of the Rhine.</P>
<P>FROM the banks of this lake I descended to another, about
half a mile in circumference, that lies in a wild and romantic
situation, and supplies a small torrent, which is the source of
the Lanquart, traversed a small pleasant plain strewed with cot∣tages,
which compose the village of Lower Lera; at the extre∣mity
of which the descent was so steep and rugged, that I dis∣mounted
until I reached the vale of Pretigau. I passed through
Closter, Kublis, Jenatsch, and Schiers, following all the way
the torrent Lanquart. The country is delightful, and
<PB N="341" REF="355"/>
greatly diversified with all kinds of productions. It yields
different species of grain, rich pastures, abundance of fruit∣trees,
with large quantities of flax and hemp: the hemp is
much cultivated, and seems to be carried to great perfection.
The peasants manufacture coarse but very strong linen
from this hemp. The mountains on each side are in some
parts covered with forests; and so great is the abundance of
wood, that the fields are either studded or skirted with larch,
pines, and beech. The hamlets are scattered through the
plain, and along the declivities of the mountains, in a very
pleasing manner. The houses are mostly of wood, in the
Swiss mode of construction, and not less convenient. The
road through this vale descends gently all the way. I have
not for some time visited a more agreeable, fertile, and popu∣lous
district.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond Grusch, which lies under some bare
rocks in a fertile plain, the valley of Pretigau contracts; and
the road leads through a narrow pass between impending
rocks, just broad enough to admit the torrent and the road.
The sudden change from the fertility of the country to the
rugged barrenness of this spot, sufficiently striking of itself,
was still further heightened by the gloom of the evening,
which added to the horror of the scenery. The road was
carried for some way in continued ascent and descent along
the craggy precipices, sometimes above, and sometimes upon
a level with the torrent. The path was so narrow and rug∣ged,
that I gave my horse to the guide, and continued my
way on foot. I soon emerged from this obscure pass, and, as
<PB N="342" REF="356"/>
far as I could judge by the dim light of the stars, came into a
fine and rich country, and went through a series of vineyards
to Malantz, in the district of Mayenfield.</P>
<P>THE High Jurisdiction of Mayenfield is the most re∣markable
in the whole country of the Grisons, because the
inhabitants are respectively sovereign and subjects. They
are sovereign, because they form part of the League of the
Ten Jurisdictions, send deputies to the general diet of the
Grisons, and nominate to the governments of the subject pro∣vinces.
They are subject, because, like the subject provinces,
they are governed by a bailif sent from the Grisons, who is
changed every two years, and in whom resides the supreme
authority. This strange intermixture of privileges and sub∣jection
is derived from the following causes. The lordship of
Mayenfield was, like the whole territory of this league, sub∣ject
to the counts of Toggenburgh, and, in 1436, joined the
other communities to form a league. In 1509, the preroga∣tives
enjoyed by the count of Toggenburgh were sold, by his
heirs, for 20, 000 florins, to the three leagues, which confirm∣ed
the privileges of the inhabitants. In 1537, Malantz and
Jennins, the remaining part of this High Jurisdiction, were also
purchased by the three leagues for 10, 000 florins. Thus, while
the inhabitants of all the other jurisdictions, who came under
the dominion of the House of Austria, have purchased their
absolute independence, the people of Mayenfield and Malantz,
although making part of the sovereign power, have con∣tinued
in the same state as at the first formation of the
leagues. The bailif or governor is appointed by the com∣munities
<PB N="343" REF="357"/>
of the three leagues in rotation; and the inhabi∣tants
of this very High Jurisdiction nominate the bailif, when
it is their turn to present to the office.</P>
<P>THE prerogatives of the bailif, who resides at Mayenfield,
are as follow: he appoints the <HI>Stadvogt,</HI> or chief magistrate
of that town, with this condition, that he must be a member
of the senate; upon a vacancy in the senate or little council,
he nominates the new senator; the arrests criminals, ex∣amines
them, and makes a composition if he chuses; he
cannot order torture or pass sentence without the con∣currence
of the members of the criminal tribunal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The members of this tribunal consist of six judges from the district of Mayenfield, and six from that of Malantz, three from Jennins, and two from Flaesch.</NOTE>, and
when they pass sentence can pardon; he can give a libera∣tion,
in the same manner as the governor of the Valteline<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Letter 76.</NOTE>;
he receives part of the fines for criminal offences, and a cer∣tain
portion of the great tythes; at Malantz he appoints the
chief magistrate from three candidates presented by the peo∣ple,
who choose all the other magistrates. Both Mayenfield
and Malantz have their civil courts, from that of the former
there lies an appeal to the bailif.</P>
<P>FROM Malantz, a small but handsome town lying upon
the side of an hill, I descended into a rich plain of pasture,
about three miles in breadth, crossed the Rhine, and soon
afterwards ascended into the county of Sargans, through
hanging groves of larch, fir, birch, beech, and oak. The
eminence commands a fine view, on the other side of the
<PB N="344" REF="358"/>
Rhine, of hills gently rising from the bed of the river into
mountains. Upon this chain are situated Mayenfield, Ma∣lantz,
Jennins, and Flaesch, surrounded by corn-fields,
meadows, and vineyards: it seemed to me the richest part of
this country. I observed beyond the confines of the Grisons,
at a little distance, the road<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 5.</NOTE> which I passed in 1776, in
travelling from Appenzel to Wallenstadt.</P>
<P>HAVING reached Pfeffers, I left my horse at the village,
where there is an abbey of Benedictine monks, the abbot of
which is a prince of the empire, and took a guide to the
baths of the same name, which are distant about three miles.
I passed through a thick forest of beech, down a steep and
rugged path, to the house which the abbot has built for the
reception of the company. Formerly the accommodations
were extremely indifferent; and the descent into the baths
was attended with great inconvenience, if not with danger.
Affairs are now greatly changed: the waters are conveyed
by pipes into commodious baths; and the house, which is
not only commodious, but superb, hangs in a most roman∣tic
situation on the side of the mountain, amidst the gloom
of the forest, close to the lively Tamina.</P>
<P>BEING desirous of visiting the warm source, I crossed the
Tamina, over a wooden bridge, and entered in a chasm, or
narrow opening in a rock of lime-stone, through which that
torrent has forced its way. The chasm is from ten to
twenty feet broad, and from two to three hundred feet high.
<PB N="345" REF="359"/>
In some places it is open at top and overspread with shrubs;
in some its sides converge and almost touch; in others it is
quite closed with enormous masses of fallen rock, and
scarcely admits a feeble ray of light. The passage along this
chasm is quite dreadful; and my head almost turns giddy at
the bare recollection. I went along a kind of scaffolding erected
for the purpose of supporting a wooden aqueduct, through
which the waters are conveyed to the baths: the planks
upon which I walked, either resting upon long beams, or
suspended by iron cramps driven into the sides of the rock,
hang over the torrent. I was frequently obliged to stoop
for a considerable way, in order to avoid the impending
rock: in some places I traversed a single plank, which forms
a kind of bridge suspended over the gulf, tottering under
my weight, and so narrow that I walked sideways. In this
manner I continued for near a quarter of an hour before I
reached the warm springs, which gush abundantly from the
crevices of the rock. Here the baths were formerly con∣structed:
the houses for the reception of the sick were built
upon a platform, under the over-hanging crags; a situation
so dreary, that the description given by the writers of the last
century no longer appears in the least degree exaggerated.
Willing to convey a general idea of their gloominess, they
represent these dwellings as never receiving the rays of the
sun, and so dark that the inhabitants were accustomed to
use candles at mid-day. The approach to the baths was very
inconvenient: the company descended ranges of perpendi∣cular
ladders, or were let down by ropes. As the rocks have
fallen, and overwhelmed these subterraneous dwellings, I
<PB N="346" REF="360"/>
could observe no traces of them, except some holes in the
rock for the beams which supported the houses.</P>
<P>THESE baths have been so renowned for their efficacy in
curing the gout, rheumatism, and cutaneous disorders,
that, according to the general opinion, they contain a small
portion of gold; as if that metal would render them more
salutary for the cure of diseases. The waters are transpa∣rent,
perfectly free from smell or taste, and about the
warmth of milk immediately drawn from the cow. Persons
who have analysed them say, that they deposit no sediment,
are as light and pure as rain-water, are impregnated with a
small quantity of volatile alcali and iron, but contain no
sulphur. I returned from this source through the same
chasm, and along the same tottering scaffolding, and was not
displeased when I issued again into day. I then mounted to
the village of Pfeffers, descended into the plain of the Rhine,
and hastened to Coire.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">UNION OF THE THREE LEAGUES—DIET—CONSTI∣TUENT
PARTS—MODE OF CHOOSING THE DEPU∣TIES—ANALOGY
BETWEEN THE GRISON DIET
AND THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT, ACCORDING TO
THE PLAN OF EXTENDING TO THE PEOPLE AT
LARGE THE RIGHT OF ELECTING REPRESENTA∣TIVES—REMARKS
ON THE INEXPEDIENCY OF
THAT PLAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE country of the Grisons is divided into three
leagues, which unite and form one republic; the
Grey League, the Cadée, or the House of God, and the Ten
Jurisdictions. The respective communities of these three
leagues have their peculiar constitution, enjoy their muni∣cipal
laws and customs, and are independent commonwealths
in all concerns, which do not interfere with the general policy
of the whole republic, or the articles of the particular league
of which they form a part.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that the precise period at which the
three leagues formally united to compose one general re∣public
cannot be ascertained from any positive record in the
annals of this country. Campel, the best historian of the
Grisons, places this event about 1436<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sprecher, however, in his Pallas Rhaetica, sixes the union of the three leagues in 1471, p. 228. Elz. edit. Most of the Grison historians follow Sprecher.</NOTE>. For though the first
<PB N="348" REF="362"/>
articles of union which are transmitted to posterity were
drawn up in 1524; it is plain that there were others of an∣terior
date, because it is therein expressly mentioned, that
the said articles were compiled from a former treaty, with
great additions. This union has since been frequently re∣newed
at different periods; but the same articles remain
without any alteration.</P>
<P>THE connection between the three leagues is maintained
by means of an annual diet, of the congress, and of the three
chiefs. The diet is composed of sixty-three deputies, and
the three chiefs. Of these deputies the Grey League send
twenty-seven, the House of God twenty-two, and the Ten
Jurisdictions fourteen. They are chosen in the several com∣munities
by every male of a stated age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The age which entitles them to vote is not exactly the same in all communities; in some it commences as early as fourteen.</NOTE>. The diet assembles
annually about the beginning of September at Ilants, Coire,
and Davos, by rotation, and continues sitting about three
weeks or a month. The chief of that league, in whose dis∣trict
the diet is held, is president for that turn, and has the
casting voice in case of equal suffrages. The supreme au∣thority
is not absolutely and finally vested in the diet, but
in the communities at large; for in all affairs of importance,
such as declaring war, making peace, enacting laws, con∣tracting
alliances, and imposing taxes, the deputies either
bring positive instructions from their constituents, or refer
those points, concerning which they have no instructions, to
the decision of the several communities; so that in effect the
<PB N="349" REF="363"/>
supreme power constitutionally resides in the body of the peo∣ple,
and not in their representatives at the diet. All questions
in the diet are carried or rejected by a majority of voices: the
mode of voting is as follows. In all cases where the commu∣nities
send instructions, the deputies deliver them to the secre∣tary,
who reads them aloud: if these instructions are obscurely
worded, as sometimes happens, either through accident or
design, the diet determines by a majority, in what sense they
shall be taken. In resolutions, which, for want of instruc∣tions,
are subject, after the decision of the diet, to the revisal
of the communities, each member is at liberty to vote as he
chooses. The three chiefs have no suffrage, when the com∣munities
send their instructions, because they are not repre∣sentatives:
but in all cases which are either not referable to
the communities, or which are afterwards to be submitted
to the communities, they vote in the same manner as the
deputies.</P>
<P>IT is worthy of remark, that although each deputy has
the power of bringing in any bill, or proposing any ques∣tion;
yet he can only communicate it to the assembly
through the medium of the president: the latter may lay
it before the assembly, without any previous notice, at any
time before its dissolution; a privilege, which necessarily in∣vests
him with great influence in promoting or opposing the
success of a motion. The deputies receive, for their attend∣ance,
a small salary from the public treasury, which never
exceeds five shillings a day.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="364"/>
EXTRAORDINARY diets are convoked at the request of
any foreign court, who will discharge the expence of its sit∣tings,
and upon other important emergencies. This extra∣ordinary
assembly is sometimes composed of all the deputies,
at other times of only half the number: in the latter
instance it is called a half diet. The deputies are chosen in
the same manner as at the election of a general diet, and its
powers are the same.</P>
<P>THE aristocratical party is still further strengthened
by the power delegated to the congress; an assembly
formed by the three chiefs, and three deputies from each
league. In the Grey League these deputies are nominated
by the Landrichter; in each of the other leagues they are
chosen by rotation from the several communities. This
congress generally meets in February or March, and always
at Coire, for which reason the chief of the League of God's
House is president: its office is to receive the votes of the
several communities, relative to the questions referred
to their deliberation at the last diet, and to communicate to
each of them the result of the general decision. Whenever
the answer of a community is not clearly worded, the con∣gress
determines the meaning of that vote by the majority;
and this circumstance gives an opening to much intrigue.
For, if the leading persons in any community do not chuse
to form a positive decision, they have it obscurely worded,
provided they are certain, that a majority of the congress
will affix that interpretation which they desire. This as∣sembly
sends out decrees to the subject countries: if such
<PB N="351" REF="365"/>
decrees are agreeable to the governors, they put them into
execution; but if otherwise, and they can secure a majority
at the approaching diet, they reject them, alledging that
congress has exceeded its power. The three chiefs, as well as
each of the other members of the congress, receive as a
defrayment of their expences 54 florins, or about £. 4.</P>
<P>THE three chiefs assemble regularly three times in the
year at Coire, and upon any emergency may be also sum∣moned
by the chief of the League of God's House. The
principal meeting is in the month of May, when they write
circular letters to the several communities, concerning the
questions which are to be laid before the general diet. All
the circular letters are written in German, and are translated
into Italian or Romansh by the notaries of the district where
those languages are spoken. All public acts and documents
are compiled in German: at the diet all bills are proposed
in that language; but the deputies, who do not understand
German, may speak Italian.</P>
<P>THOSE theorists, who are so anxious to reform the Eng∣lish
House of Commons by transferring to <HI>the people at
large</HI> the election of their representatives in parliament,
might, on examining with attention the features of the
Grison diet, fondly imagine, that an <HI>annual</HI> assembly, in
the choice of whose members <HI>every male</HI> of the state should
have a vote, and which, in all material occurrences, should
be liable to <HI>be directed by its constituents,</HI> must <HI>necessarily</HI> be
the purest sanctuary of general freedom. In this instance,
however, their conjectures are by no means consonant to
<PB N="352" REF="366"/>
fact and experience; as corruption and influence are not in
any national parliament more conspicuous than in the diet
of the Grisons.</P>
<P>FOR although, in general, those deputies, <HI>annually chosen
by every male of a stated age, are subject to be controuled in
their votes by written orders from their constituents,</HI> yet they
frequently contrive to elude this restriction. Sometimes the
instructions are drawn up, with the consent of the com∣munity,
under the sole direction of the deputy himself; at
other times an exemption from positive instructions, and
the power of voting at his own pleasure, is purchased by the
deputy from his constituents. Sometimes again the deputy,
although he may not have interest sufficient to gain either of
these points, has still sufficient address to get his instructions
so obscurely worded as to admit a doubtful interpretation.
By various intrigues of this kind the greatest part of the de∣puties
ultimately acquire the power of voting as they please;
and as they chiefly obtain this power by corrupting their
constituents, most of them in return sell their vote to the
leading members of the diet. For most questions are carried,
and most causes decided by bribery. Nor can it well be
otherwise, when the electors are persons in needy circum∣stances;
and the members, who have purchased their seats,
are not themselves exalted by their possessions above
temptation.</P>
<P>THUS then the leading members secure an unbounded
sway in the affairs of the diet. But still it should seem, that
whatever influence they may obtain by corrupting the de∣puties;
<PB N="353" REF="367"/>
yet as that assembly itself does not in many cases de∣cide
finally, they could not acquire the same authority in
those concerns, which must be referred to the determination
of the communities at large. Here at least we might expect
the unbiassed sense of the majority of the people. But it
may be universally remarked, that the delegation of delibe∣rative
authority to the people at large unavoidably tends to
introduce an actual, though not an acknowledged aristo∣cracy.
For a <HI>numerous</HI> populace summoned to determine
upon political, legislative, and judicial questions, <HI>far above
their comprehensions,</HI> must necessarily resign themselves to the
direction of more informed men, especially when aided by the
recommendation of superior wealth. As the deputies are ge∣nerally
the chiefs of those communities which they represent,
they must of course have the principal influence, and easily
find means to incline the opinion of the people to the side
which they have espoused. In fact, without this aristocra∣tical
influence, the excess of freedom would often dege∣nerate
into anarchy, and public deliberations would be at∣tended
with endless disputes and factions.</P>
<P>IF therefore corruption and aristocratical influence alone
diminish factions and prevent anarchy in so poor a country
as that of the Grisons, and in a republic scarcely known
among the nations of Europe; to what a dreadful excess
must the same evils prevail, if the <HI>same</HI> mode of electing,
and giving instructions to, members of parliament, sub∣sisted
in a kingdom like England; where riches and luxury
are continually advancing with such rapid strides; where
the most important political and commercial debates are
<PB N="354" REF="368"/>
agitated without restraint; and where the decisions of pub∣lic
affairs frequently affect the peace and interests of all Eu∣rope!
Theoretical reasoners may, indeed, attempt to prove
that the best method of preventing corruption is to augment
the number of electors, from the chimerical idea, that <HI>large
numbers</HI> cannot be bribed. But if we appeal from uncertain
theory to more certain experience, we shall find, that this
argument is contradicted by the history of all ages. Among
the Grecian republics, those commonwealths in which the
magistrates were chosen by the <HI>people at large,</HI> were the
most venal. Among the Romans, the most effectual means
which Julius Caesar, the most able politician of his age, em∣ployed
to subjugate his country, was to extend the privileges
and votes of Roman citizens to <HI>all</HI> the inhabitants of Italy.
The members of the Polish diet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Travels into Poland, Russia, &amp;c. Vol. I. B. 1. c. vi. &amp; viii.</NOTE>, which is no less venal
than the diet of the Grisons, are chosen by needy and <HI>nume∣rous</HI>
electors, of whom far the greatest part possess no pro∣perty;
and whose <HI>numbers,</HI> instead of preventing, necessa∣rily
tend to increase influence and corruption.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VALLEY OF SOPRA SELVA—ILANTS—TRUNS—DISENTIS—TAVETCH.</HEAD>
<P>IMPATIENT to return to England, after so long an ab∣sence
from my friends, I yesterday morning quitted
Coire, and passed by Embs, and over the bridge of Reiche∣nau,
which I again stopped to admire, as it boldly projected
over the Rhine. I then rode along the side of the moun∣tains
which separate the Grisons from the canton of Glarus,
went through Tamins, and left Flims on my right, situated
about a quarter of a mile from the road, in a pleasant plain.
The houses of these towns are not scattered like those of
Davos, but stand in separate clusters, like the burghs of En∣gadina.
Having traversed thick forests of pines, and a
very wild country, richly diversified with grain and pas∣ture,
I descended to the deep bed of the Rhine, and crossed
it to Ilants.</P>
<P>ILANTS, the capital of the Grey League, is a small town,
containing about sixty houses, and partly surrounded by walls;
a circumstance which serves to distinguish it, as it is the
only walled town, excepting Coire, among the Grisons. It
is also remarkable for being the place, where the general
diet of the three leagues assembles every third year. The
adjacent country is fertile in every species of grain and pas∣ture.
The points of view are uncommonly fine, exhibiting
<PB N="356" REF="370"/>
a small plain skirted by cultivated mountains, and backed by
a ridge of barren rocks which bound the valley of Lungnets.
The Romansh, which is spoken in these parts, differs consi∣derably,
both as to pronunciation and orthography, from
that of Engadina. By the assistance of some persons to
whom I had letters of recommendation, I procured several
books written in the dialect of this league; these, in addition
to others which I obtained in Engadina, have so considerably
swelled my travelling library, that if I continue to increase
the collection, I must hire an additional horse for the pur∣pose
of carrying my baggage of information.</P>
<P>THIS tract of country, stretching from Reichenau to the
mountain of St. Gothard, is called the valley of Sopra Selva,
and is the most populous part of the Grey League. On
quitting Ilants I pursued my route at the foot of the moun∣tains,
through a plain covered with pasture and forest by the
side of the Rhine, which is rapid and shallow. Afterwards I
passed through a rocky country, continually ascending and
descending through large tracts of forest. I crossed the
Rhine several times during the last four or five miles: that
river formed repeated cataracts, as I judged from the roaring
sound, for the evening was so dark, that no objects could be
distinguished.</P>
<P>I ARRIVED very late at Truns, remarkable in the history
of this country as the place where the independence of the
league was first ratified, and an alliance concluded between
the chiefs and the communities. I observed an aged oak,
which, according to tradition, is the same tree under which
<PB N="357" REF="371"/>
the three chiefs confirmed the liberties of the league; and
near it a chapel, whose walls are painted with a representation
of the ceremony. My curiosity led me to the town-house, in
which the diet of the Grey League is annually assembled.
The room is well adopted for the purpose, and is hand∣fomely
painted with the arms of the several Landrichters,
beginning from those of John of Lambris, the first person
appointed to that office when the Grey League was formed.
From this place of its meeting the assembly is always called
the Diet of Truns. It consists of the same twenty-seven de∣puties
who are appointed for the general diet of the three
leagues, the two Landrichters, the abbot of Disentis, the re∣presentative
of the House of Austria, as baron of Retzuns,
and the Cau de Sax. All affairs relating to legislation, po∣litics,
and expenditure, which concern the general interest of
the league, are agitated in this assembly; and the questions
are decided by the majority of voices. At the same place is
also assembled a court of appeal composed of sixteen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These deputies are taken from the eight High Jurisdictions of the Grey League, in the following proportions:

certain sum, which are brought by appeal from the de∣cision
of the civil courts in the several communities of the
Grey League.</P>
<P>DISENTIS, from whence I am now writing, takes its ap∣pellation
from an abbey of that name, whose abbot was
formerly sovereign over this part of the Grey League, and
who, although his prerogatives have been gradually dimi∣nished,
yet, as one of the chiefs of the league, still possesses
no inconsiderable influence in the general administration of
affairs. At the diet of Truns he not only votes, but has such
weight, that few acts can pass in opposition to his will. In
the court of appeal, although he is not present, he may be
said to possess four votes, as the four deputies from the High
Jurisdiction of Disentis are generally nominated through
his interest. Nor is his ascendancy confined to the Grey
League; by the nomination of the Landrichter every third
year, he secures four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He proposes for Landrichter three candidates, from whom one is nominated by the deputies, but the latter always appoint the person he recommends; and as the Landrichter appoints the three deputies to the congress, and is himself a member of the same assembly, the abbot may justly be said in that year to influence <HI>four</HI> votes in the congress.</NOTE> votes in the congress for that sitting,
and has also much power in the general diet of the Grisons
by his influence over the deputies of the Grey League. His
present revenue is very small, scarcely amounting to £. 100
<HI>per ann.;</HI> in addition he receives a pension from the House
of Austria, interested to secure his concurrence. He is
chosen by the Benedictine monks, who compose the chap∣ter;
and is a prince of the German empire.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="373"/>
THE abbey, which is situated upon the side of the moun∣tain,
is a large quadrangular building, and makes a magnifi∣cent
apearance, as it overlooks the village. I was much dis∣appointed
at the absence of the abbot, whom I had the plea∣sure
of meeting at Coire: he is a man of considerable infor∣mation,
and had in his possession the key of the archives,
which are said to contain several curious records of high an∣tiquity.
The monks who politely accompanied me over the
abbey were able to give me but little intelligence. Besides
the great church, they carried me to a small chapel, which is
esteemed the most antient in the whole country of the Gri∣sons.
Having been previously informed, that books in the
Romansh tongue, for the use of the Roman Catholics, are
frequently printed in this abbey, I procured several from
the monks, particularly a vocabulary of the Romansh spoken
in the valley of Sopra Selva.</P>
<P>DISENTIS is a straggling village lying upon a gentle de∣clivity,
which slopes gradually from the foot of the moun∣tains
to the banks of the Rhine. The sides of the mountains
are clothed with groves of firs and small birch; the lower
parts yield rich pasture, a small quantity of wheat, rye, and
millet. Opposite Disentis is the valley of Medels, from
which descends a torrent called the Middle Rhine, and joins
the upper branch that flows from the chain of the St. Go∣thard.
The communities of Disentis and Tavetch, which
form a High Jurisdiction, occupy the western extremity of
the valley of Sopra-Selva, stretching as far as the consines of
Uri. The whole body of people assemble every two years at
Disentis in the open air, for the choice of the Landamman,
<PB N="360" REF="374"/>
and for the confirmation of their magistrates, as well as for
the purpose of enacting laws. They nominate also to the
governments of the subject provinces. The courts of judica∣ture
are established at Disentis; and the judges are chosen
by the people in the separate districts. The general admini∣stration
of affairs is entrusted to a council of sixteen, which
gives instructions to their deputies, sent by the two commu∣nities
to the general diet of the three leagues. The Land∣amman
is president, and has the casting voice. The abbot
enjoys the privilege of being present at all political ques∣tions,
and of giving his vote. He has considerable influence
in these communities. Formerly the fines for criminal of∣fences
belonged to him; but one of his predecessors
having disposed of that right to the community, they are
now divided among the judges.</P>
<P>September 30th.</P>
<P>I QUITTED Disentis this morning, and in about two
hours entered the pleasant valley of Tavetch, lying at the
foot of the Alps, which separate the Grisons from the canton
of Uri. The villages of this valley are numerous, and con∣sist
of scattered cottages chiefly constructed of wood, and re∣sembling
the Swiss hamlets in the small cantons. I met
many large herds of cattle just descended from the higher
Alps, and driving towards the fairs of Tirano and Lugano.</P>
<P>THE valley of Tavetch produces pasture, hemp, and flax,
and a small quantity of rye and barley. The trees growing
in these parts are chiefly sirs and pines, and their number
gradually diminishes towards the extremity of the vale.
<PB N="361" REF="375"/>
From Tavetch I ascended a very narrow path, and passed
through Selva and Cimut, the last village in the country of
the Grisons, where I took my farewel of the Romansh. The
country became more and more wild as I ascended; and
the Upper Rhine gradually diminished as I approached its
source. A little beyond Cimut I came into a small plain of
pasture, watered by two streams which unite and form the
Upper Rhine. I had once intended to have visited the
source of the principal stream, that precipitates from mount
Badus; but finding, upon inquiry from the inhabitants of
Selva, that it would employ at least five hours in going and
returning; as the day was far advanced, and as my late
illness has disqualified me for such fatiguing journeys, I
thought it most prudent to pursue my route to Urseren.
At Cimut, a peasant, who had frequently visited the spot,
informed me, that the chief source of the Rhine descends
from a glacier upon the summit of the Badus; and forms a
piece of water about half a mile in circumference, called the
lake of St. Thomas. From this lake issues a torrent, which
precipitates itself from the mountain, and being joined by
many springs and currents forms the largest of the two
streams, which unite in the above-mentioned plain of pasture.
On quitting this plain I ascended by the side of the smaller
stream, until I traced it falling from a glacier close to the
confines of the canton of Uri. The ascent, though abrupt
and craggy, was not so difficult as the passage of the Braglio
or the Muret. These Alps produce no trees, but are covered
to a great height with herbage.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="376"/>
AFTER two hours continued ascent from the valley of
Tavetch, I reached the highest point of the chain, which
separates the country of the Uri: a few paces further I passed
a post without any inscription, which marks the boundary
between the two respective territories. Soon afterwards I
arrived at a lake of an oblong shape, about a mile and a half
in circumference. It is formed principally by a torrent that
falls from the northern side of the same chain, which gives
rise to the Rhine: the lake supplies a stream that may be
called one of the sources of the Reuss. I followed it as it
runs through a narrow plain until I came to a steep descent,
where the beautiful valley of Urseren suddenly burst upon
my view.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 87.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GENERAL IDEA OF THE COURTS OF JUSTICE—RELIGION—REVENUES—POPULATION.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the course of my correspondence I have oc∣casionally
mentioned the judicial proceedings in some
of the communities. I shall here remark in general, that
throughout the three leagues the Roman law prevails, modi∣fied
by the municipal customs. The courts of justice in each
community are composed of the chief magistrate, who pre∣sides,
and a certain number of jurymen chosen by the people:
they have no regular salaries, but receive for their attend∣ance
a small sum, arising in some communities from the ex∣pences
of the process, which are defrayed by the criminals,
in others from a share of the fines. They enjoy the power
of pardoning or diminishing the penalty, and of receiving a
composition in money. This mode of proceeding supposes,
what is as absurd in theory as it is contrary to experience,
that judges will incline to mercy when it is their <HI>interest</HI> to
convict; or will impartially inflict punishment, even when
injurious to their own private advantage. The prisoners are
examined in private; frequently tortured, for the purpose of
forcing confession, when the judges either divide the sines,
or remit the punishment for a composition. In some
districts a criminal prosecution is a kind of festival to the
<PB N="364" REF="378"/>
judges, for whom a good repast<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A specifie sum is allowed for the expence of the dinner, amounting in general to about 48 florins.</NOTE> is provided at the expence
of the prisoner if convicted; and thus the allusion, in Garth's
Dispensary, applied with more wit than truth to our courts
of justice, is literally fulfilled:
<Q>“And wretches hang, that jurymen may <HI>DINE.</HI>”</Q>
Capital punishments, however, are extremely rare; a cir∣cumstance
arising not from any peculiar lenity in the penal
statutes, or from a propensity to mercy in the judges; but
because the judges draw more advantages from fining
than executing an offender. In a word, to use the ex∣pression
of Burnet, which is no less true at present than it
was in his time, “Many crimes go unpunished, if the
persons who commit them have either great credit or
much money.”</P>
<P>IT is remarkable that torture is more frequently applied,
and for smaller delinquencies, in these independent republics,
than in the subject provinces. The infliction of it depends
entirely upon the arbitrary will of the judges, a majority of
whom may order it to obtain the confession of an offence
which is not capital, nor even punishable by corporal penal∣ties.
Thus it is not uncommon, in those communities
where fines are divided among the judges, to torture women
of loose conduct, for the purpose of compelling them to
confess with whom they have been connected; for as in∣continence
<PB N="365" REF="379"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>
<ITEM>In many of the communities incontinence between married persons <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is punished by a fine of 200 florins.</ITEM>

</LIST></NOTE> is punishable by fines, the more persons are
convicted, the larger share of money is distributed among
the judges. Even in the districts, where the fines are paid
to the community, torture is often no less wantonly in∣flicted,
because when the prisoner is not found guilty, the
expences of the process fall upon the public, and the judges
receive less emolument.</P>
<P>EVEN in the civil courts most causes are decided by brib∣ing
the judges; and appeals in those communities, wherein
they are admitted, scarcely serve any other end than to en∣large
the sphere of corruption: Coire and a few other
places are excepted from this general reflection. This de∣scription
comprehends the course of jurisprudence through∣out
the Grisons; and how can it be expected, that the gover∣nors
of the subject provinces should impartially administer
justice, when their power is enlarged, and they enjoy greater
means of enriching themselves; since they have such continual
examples of injustice and venality in their own country?</P>
<P>BEFORE I close the account of the courts of judicature, it
may be necessary to mention the <HI>Straffgericht</HI><NOTE N="dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Paschal, the French embassador from Henry the Fourth to the Grisons, gives, in his</HI> Rhaetica Legatione, <HI>the following de∣finition of a Straffgericht:</HI> Straffgerich∣tum, est is hominum, paucis exceptis, imperi∣torum, ac truculentorum consessus, qui rebus turbidis a mot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, et lasciviente, multitudine edu∣citur in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oc, ut saeviat in personas, et fortunas <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rum, quos velsua pravitas, si sacinorosi homi∣nes sint, aut siboni, sua inselicitas, his duris ca∣pitibus m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctandos objicit: igitur <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a omnia ibi aspere et violenter ex tumore et libidine plebis et partis iratae agit, hanc saeviendi occasionem jamdiu aucupantis.</NOTE>, or public

chamber of justice, which was established upon particular
occasions, and in the most alarming crisis of affairs, by the
consent of the general diet; and which, during its sittings,
had jurisdiction over the three leagues. It was chiefly held
in cases of high treason, and is thus justly described by Bur∣net,
“There is a part of this constitution that is very ter∣rible,
and which makes the greatest men in it tremble:
the peasants come sometimes in great bodies, and demand
a chamber of justice from the general diet, and they are
bound to grant it always when it is thus demanded, which
comes about generally once in twenty years; commonly this
tumult of the peasants is set on by some of the mal-con∣tented
gentry, and generally there are a great many sa∣crifices
made. This court is composed of ten judges out
of every league, and twenty advocates, who manage
such accusations as are presented to them; this court is
paramount to law, and acts like a court of inquisition,
they give the question, and do every thing that they think
necessary to discover the truth of such accusations as are
presented to them; and the decisions of this court can
never be brought under a second review; though there is
an exception to this, for about a hundred years ago one
court of justice reversed all that another had done; but
that is a single instance.”</P>
<P>THESE meetings, very usual in the last century, were al∣ways
attended with such dreadful effects as nearly to en∣danger
<PB N="367" REF="381"/>
the ruin of the republic. The present generation,
grown wiser by experience, and either aware of the dreadful
effects of such licentious proceedings, or less agitated with
intestine dissensions, have never had recourse to these san∣guinary
measures: accordingly these courts are now so to∣tally
fallen into disuse, that they may be considered as
obsolete, although they have never been abolished by public
authority.</P>
<P>THE religion of the Grisons is divided into Catholic and
Reformed, the only two persuasions which are tolerated in
this country. By the reformed is meant what we call Cal∣vinism,
although it is not the same as was established at
Geneva. For as the reformation was introduced into this
country by the disciples of Zuingle, the religion of the Pro∣testant
Grisons bears a greater resemblance to that settled at
Zuric, than to the church of Geneva; although the differ∣ence
between these two sects is so trifling, that they may be
considered as holding the same tenets. Among the Grisons
the Protestants are more numerous than the Catholics, the
former being estimated at about two-thirds of the inha∣bitants;
and Stanyan justly asserts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State of Switzerland. p. 228.</NOTE>, that “as all their
elections are decided by the plurality of voices, the repub∣lic
of the Grisons may be deemed a Protestant state.”</P>
<P>THE reformation was introduced very early into this
country: the new doctrines were first preached about the
<PB N="368" REF="382"/>
year 1524, and received at Flaesch, a small village in the Ten
Jurisdictions, upon the confines of Sargans; from thence
they were extended to Mayenfield and Malantz, and soon
afterwards through the whole valley of Pretigau. The
reformed opinions spread with such celerity, that before the
end of the sixteenth century they were embraced by the
whole league of the Ten Jurisdictions, (excepting part of
the community of Alvenew), the greatest part of the House
of God, and a few communities in the Grey League.</P>
<P>THE difference of religion nearly excited a civil war be∣tween
the two sects, as well at the first introduction of the
reformation, as at the beginning of the troubles in the Val∣teline.
In the latter instance the two parties rose in arms,
but the Catholics being overpowered by the Protestants, mat∣ters
were amicably adjusted. Since that period, all religious
concerns have been regulated with perfect cordiality. Ac∣cording
to the general consent of the three leagues, each
community, being absolute within its little territory, has the
power of appointing its own particular worship, and the in∣habitants
are free to follow either the Catholic or Reformed
persuasion. In the administration of civil affairs religion
has no interference: the deputies of the general diet may
be members of either communion, as chosen by the commu∣nities
which they represent. By this moderate and tolerating
principle, all religious dissentions have been suppressed as
much as possible; and the most perfect amity subsists
between the two sects.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="383"/>
IN spiritual concerns the Catholics for the most part are un∣der
the jurisdiction of the bishop of Coire. For the affairs
of the Reformed churches, each league is divided into a
certain number of districts, the ministers whereof assemble
twice every year: these assemblies are called <HI>colloquia.</HI>
Each <HI>colloquium</HI> has its president, and each league a superin∣tendent,
called a dean. The supreme authority in spiritual
concerns is vested in the synod, which is composed of the
three deans, and the clergy of each league: the synod
assembles every year reciprocally in each of the three
leagues. Candidates for holy orders are examined before
the synod. The necessary qualification for admission into
the church ought to be the knowledge of Hebrew, Greek,
and Latin: but this rule is not strictly adhered to; many
being ordained without the least acquaintance with either of
those languages. Formerly Latin was solely used, as well in
the debates of the synod as for the purpose of examining the
candidates; but at present that tongue grows more and more
into disuse, and German is employed in its stead.</P>
<P>THE number of reformed parishes in the whole three
Leagues amount to 135, in the following proportion. In the
Grey League 46, in that of God's House 53, and in the League
of Ten Jurisdictions 36. The ministers of these churches
enjoy but very small salaries. The richest benefices do not
perhaps yield more than £. 20, or at most £. 25 <HI>per ann.</HI> and
the poorest sometimes scarcely £. 6. This scanty income is
attended with many inconveniences. It obliges the clergy,
who have families, to follow some branch of trassic, to the
neglect of their ecclesiastical studies, and to the degradation
<PB N="370" REF="384"/>
of the professional character. Another inconvenience is
superadded to the narrowness of their income. In most
communities the ministers, though confirmed by the synod,
are chosen by the people of the parish, and are solely
dependent on their bounty. For these reasons the candidates
for holy orders are generally extremely ignorant. They can∣not
support that expence which is requisite to pursue their
studies; they are not animated with the expectation of a
decent competence; and, from the dependent mode of their
election, are not encouraged to deserve their promotion by a
consistent dignity of character. But there are not wanting a
few men of great knowledge and eminence, as well in their
professional studies as in other branches of polite learning.
Beside Mr. Aporta, whom I look up to as a kind of phaeno∣menon
in the literary world, I have met with two or three
clergymen who are greatly distinguished for their erudition,
and who would do credit to any church.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that the liturgies of these Reformed
churches are not exactly the same; a diversity owing to
the independence of so many small commonwealths, which
are absolute, within their little territories, in all concerns that
do not affect the political union of the three Leagues. The
churches of the German communities use the liturgy of
Zuric; but as this form of prayer was amended and refined
in 1766, some of the ministers admit the new, and others
still retain the antient liturgy.</P>
<P>STEPHEN GABRIEL, pastor of Ilantz, a person of great
learning in the beginning of the last century, translated into
<PB N="371" REF="385"/>
the Romansh of the Grey League the liturgy of Zuric; and
the same form of prayer is used in Upper and Lower Enga∣dina,
adapted to their respective idioms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the Romansh spoken in Upper and Lower Engadina, see Letter 90.</NOTE>. The ministers of
the Italian churches employ a translation of the Genevan
liturgy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In 1749 a new service was introduced into the churches of Pregalia; but, on account of its length, soon fell into disuse.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE old style is in use among the Protestants, the new
style among the Catholics; a few years ago an attempt was
made to introduce the latter among the Protestants. The
inhabitants of Pregalia admitted it, and those of Upper En∣gadina
offered also to receive it, if the town of Coire would
set the example. Its admission, however, being strongly op∣posed
by a party on religious scruples, it was absolutely re∣jected,
and the inhabitants of Pregalia again adopted the
old style<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I am informed, that since my depar∣ture from the Grisons the new style has been adopted by several Protestant commu∣nities.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE revenues of the three Leagues arise from the fol∣lowing
articles: 1. The duties upon the merchandise which
passes through the Grisons, the Valteline, and Chiavenna:
they are farmed at the annual rate of 17, 000 florins, or about
£. 1259. 2. A third of the fines laid upon delinquents in
the subject countries: the fluctuating state of this article
cannot be ascertained. 3. A tribute of 500 philips<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">A philip = <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><HI>s.</HI></NOTE> from
the Valteline, and 100 from Chiavenna. 4. A small fund,
<PB N="372" REF="386"/>
the principal part of which is only £. 4, 000, vested in the
English stocks. The public expenditure is very trifling,
being chiefly confined to the expences incurred by the
sittings of the diet, and the salary assigned to the deputies for
their attendance. Besides this public treasury, each League
has its own fund. The pensions received from the foreign
powers are paid annually at the meeting of the diet, when
they are equally divided between the three Leagues; and
each deputy delivers the share to the community which
he represents.</P>
<P>MANY disputes have occasionally arisen among the
Grisons in regard to the power of coining, and several of the
communities have asserted their claim to the exercise of that
right. The fact is, that each community might doubtless
coin money, and order it to be taken within its own little
territory; but as it could not make it pass in the other parts,
the right is merely nominal. According to the general con∣sent
of the three Leagues, this privilege is vested in the town
of Coire, in the bishop of that diocese, and in the baron of
Haldenstein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And I believe in the abbot of Disentis.</NOTE>. No money is, however, struck in the Gri∣sons,
excepting a small copper coin called blutsger, which is
somewhat less than a halfpenny. The gold and silver cur∣rent
in the country is chiefly Austrian and French.</P>
<P>I HAVE bestowed no inconsiderable degree of pains in
order to ascertain the population of the Grisons, but my
labours have not been attended with the success which I had
<PB N="373" REF="387"/>
reason to expect. I have not been able to procure any par∣ticular
and certain detail of the number of inhabitants, and
can only subjoin the following rough calculation:
<LIST>
<LABEL>The Grey League is supposed to contain about</LABEL>
<ITEM>54, 000 souls.</ITEM>
<LABEL>League of God's House</LABEL>
<ITEM>29, 000</ITEM>
<LABEL>League of Ten Jurisdictions</LABEL>
<ITEM>15, 000</ITEM>
<LABEL></LABEL>
<ITEM>98, 000</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>IF we add 87, 000, the number of inhabitants in the Val∣teline,
Chiavenna, and Bormio, the whole population of the
Grisons, and the subject countries, will amount to only
185, 000 souls; and allowing for deficiencies will scarcely
exceed 200, 000.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 88.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">COMMERCE OF THE GRISONS—CANAL OF THE
ADDA.</HEAD>
<P>THE commerce of the Grisons is extremely contracted.
The only exports (exclusive of those from the subject
provinces) being cheese and cattle. They import grain, rice,
salt, and silk stuffs, from Milan; grain from Suabia and
Tyrol; salt from Tyrol and Bavaria; fine cloth, chiefly Eng∣lish,
French, and Silesian, through Germany; fine linen
and muslins from Switzerland: and as the only manufacture
throughout the whole country is that of cotton established at
Coire, it is evident that the balance of trade must turn con∣siderably
against them. They are enabled to support this
difference by means of the estates which the Grisons possess
in the subject provinces, by the sums which the governors
draw from those provinces, by public and private pensions
from France and Austria, by money saved in foreign ser∣vices,
and by the duties upon the merchandise passing
through their territories.</P>
<P>As most of the Grison peasants weave cloth and linen for
the use of their families; it would be no difficult under∣taking
to introduce manufactures in different districts. But
it is remarkable, that in these little republics a strange pre∣judice
prevails against commerce; and that the project of
establishing manufactures is opposed by many leading men
<PB N="375" REF="389"/>
of the country. It is difficult to discover the occasion of
these illiberal principles; it has been imputed to a suspicion,
that if the people should become opulent by commerce,
they would be less open to influence; and the powerful fa∣milies,
who now direct the public affairs, would lose their
ascendancy. Besides these reasons, which are of too delicate
a nature to be openly acknowledged, other motives of a more
generous complexion have been assigned.</P>
<P>THE advocates against extending commerce assert, that as
the true riches of every country consist in the products of
agriculture, all occupations, which turn the attention of the
people from that one great object, are detrimental to the
general good of society; and particularly, that in free states
manufactures tend to enervate the inhabitants, to introduce
the baneful effects of luxury, to depress the spirit of free∣dom,
and to destroy the general simplicity of manners.
These arguments, however specious in appearance, will
prove fallacious upon mature consideration. If in a country,
which subsists chiefly by agriculture, manufactures are pur∣sued
to the total neglect of husbandry, they then become de∣trimental:
but this is seldom the case; as, by adding to the
general consumption, manufactures usually tend to increase,
instead of diminishing, the products of the earth. Such have
been the effects in the mountains of Neuchatel, where the
forests have been cleared, and the country converted into
pasture, or sown with grain. Manufactures and commerce
are still farther serviceable by encouraging an increase of
inhabitants, which form the true riches of a country. For
whenever constant opportunities of employing a number of
<PB N="376" REF="390"/>
hands occur, children will not be a burden to the peasants,
the contrary of which must happen in those districts which
afford little occupation.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the Grisons in particular; their terri∣tory
being entirely mountainous will not yield sufficient
produce for the inhabitants, consequently some means of
supplying the deficiency must be adopted. Now surely it
would be far more honourable to pursue commerce, even if
attended with some unavoidable inconveniences, than to
depend for their subsistence upon foreign subsidies, to op∣press
and exhaust the subject provinces, and to exhibit a re∣gular
system of venality, which almost pervades the whole
mass of people. Nor does the establishment of manufactures
tend to enervate the inhabitants, and to diminish the spirit of
freedom. In fact, the manufactures in these democratical
states are by no means similar to those introduced into large
towns, where a number of individuals are collected in the
same spot: on the contrary, the work is divided, and distri∣buted
among the peasants, who, with their wives and chil∣dren,
weave the cloth at home. By this method they pre∣serve
(as I had occasion to remark in the canton of Ap∣penzel)
their original simplicity of manners, and maintain
the spirit of freedom, even to a greater degree, than in
those parts where there is no commerce. Examples are not
wanting among the Grisons themselves: the natives of
Upper Engadina, who are so much inclined to trade, are in
reality more free and less influenced than the people of the
other communities; nor is it observed, that the inhabitants
of the valley of Pretigau have become more enervated, since
<PB N="377" REF="391"/>
they have been employed in preparing cotton for the manu∣facture
at Coire. In fact, that kind of occupation does not
always take the peasants from more active employments.
In summer they are at leisure to cultivate the earth, while
their wives and children attend principally to the manu∣factures:
during the long winters, which last in these Al∣pine
regions for six months without intermission, agricul∣ture
is necessarily suspended; and these occupations succeed
the more laborious exertions of the field.</P>
<P>As the principal commerce of the Grisons and the subject
provinces is carried on across the lake of Como with Milan, I
shall give you an account of the inland navigation, which
has been lately established for the purpose of facilitating that
commerce; the several parts of which I had the curiosity to
visit. The water communication between the country of the
Grisons and Milan is formed by the lake of Como, by its
branch the lake of Lecco, by the Adda, by the canals of the
Adda and Trezzo. The canal of Trezzo, called also <HI>Canale
della Martesana,</HI> begins at Trezzo, situated on the Adda,
and is carried to Milan. This cut, which is 24 miles in
length, begun in 1457, under the reign of Francis Sforza,
and completed in 1460, did not at first serve for the purpose
of navigation more than two days in the week; being prin∣cipally
used for overflowing the low grounds with water, ne∣cessary
for the cultivation of rice. In 1573, during the admi∣nistration
of the duke of Aberquerque, Spanish governor of
Milan, the cut was enlarged, and the body of water so much
increased, as to admit the passage of vessels every day.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="392"/>
STILL, however, the Adda was not navigable during the
whole way between the lake of Lecco and Trezzo; and con∣sequently
there was no water communication between the
lake of Como and Milan. The navigation of that river was
interrupted by a succession of cataracts for about a mile,
during which space the fall of water is equal to the perpen∣dicular
height of about 80 feet.</P>
<P>IN order to obviate this inconvenience, a canal was pro∣jected,
in 1519, but no part was carried into execution, ex∣cepting
a mole, which was thrown across the Adda. In
1591 the work was undertaken, and the canal completed in
1599. But the stream of the Adda was no sooner admitted
into the cut, than the banks broke down, for so considerable
a way, as to render all repairs impracticable. This breach,
generally imputed to the violence of the current, was princi∣pally
owing to the nature of the rock, in which the cut was
excavated, and to an error in the original plan. The rock is
a composition of gravel and sand, or a species of pudding-stone,
of loose texture and unequal solidity; and as the cut
was made too near the precipice, which overhangs the Adda,
that part of the rock which formed the banks of the canal
was not sufficiently strong to support the sluices and the
weight of water. From that time the canal was considered
an impracticable work, and abandoned; until a few years
ago it was again undertaken by order of the emperor Joseph
the Second, and carried on with such expedition, as to be
finished within the space of three years.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="393"/>
THE canal is about a mile in length, and is excavated in
the rocks, which form the precipitous banks of the Adda.
In some places the rock has been hollowed to the depth of
100 feet, and the breadth of 200. The fall of water, which is
equal to the perpendicular height of about 80 feet, is broken
by six sluices; and the water is supplied by the running
stream of the Adda. The breadth of the canal is 70 feet.
The expence has already amounted to near £. 100, 000. The
engineers, however, seem to have fallen into the same error
which attended the original plan; by forming the cut too
near the precipice. In consequence of this inadvertence,
the water lately forced down the banks of the canal; and the
damage was not repaired without much difficulty and a con∣siderable
expence. Notwithstanding the precaution of let∣ting
out the superfluous water by flood-gates, there is reason
to apprehend, that these breaches will be frequent; and that
the recent labours may be rendered as ineffectual as those of
the Spaniards. But should the canal continue in its present
state, and the navigation not be interrupted; yet the advan∣tages
will hardly compensate for the expence of making and
keeping it in repair. The commerce between the Grisons
and inhabitants of Milan is so extremely contracted, that if
all the merchandise which passes between these two people
was conveyed along the canals, the tolls and duties would be
very inadequate to the expence.</P>
<P>BUT the navigation from the lake of Como to Milan
is attended with so many difficulties, that the greatest part of
the merchandise is sent by land, as the most commodious
and less hazardous way. The current of the Adda is so
<PB N="380" REF="394"/>
rapid, that the vessels cannot be towed up without great ex∣pence
and delay, and is in some parts so extremely dange∣rous,
that boats are not unfrequently overset. The only
persons, therefore, who forward their merchandise along the
Adda and the canals to the lake of Lecco are the contractors,
who furnish the Grisons with corn and salt, and who are
compelled by the government of Milan to send those com∣modities
by water. And when it is considered that Milan
receives from the Grisons only planks, stones for building,
and coals, and supplies them with corn, rice, and salt; the ar∣ticles
of export evidently exceed those of import; and the
navigation from Milan to the lake of Como is of more
consequence than that from the lake of Como to Milan.
The canal of the Adda, therefore, which has only facilitated
the inland navigation from the Grisons to Milan, and not
from Milan to the Grisons, though a work of extreme diffi∣culty,
and redounding greatly to the honour of the sove∣reign
who completed it, will scarcely produce advantages
equal to its original cost and frequent repairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The curious reader is referred to the Abbe Frisi's account of the Canals of the Adda, and Trezzo, and of the other navigable canals in the Milanese.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ALLIANCES OF THE GRISONS WITH THE SWISS
CANTONS—FRANCE—VENICE—AND THE HOUSE
OF AUSTRIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE alliances of the Grisons with foreign powers come
next under consideration.</P>
<P>THE Three Leagues, though always esteemed allies of
the Swiss, yet are not, strictly speaking, in confederacy with
all the cantons. In 1497 the Grey League, and in the fol∣lowing
year the League of God's House, entered into a per∣petual
treaty with Zuric, Lucern, Uri, Schweitz, Under∣walden,
Zug and Glaris. Although the League of Ten
Jurisdictions was not included in the same treaty, yet it was
afterwards declared that, in consequence of its connection
with the other two leagues, it should be entitled to the same
assistance and good offices. The Three Leagues are in close
alliance with Berne and Zuric, to whose mediation they have
frequently had recourse in points of disagreement. By these
treaties the Grisons are called allies of the Swiss; and, in
consequence of a request from the particular cantons, with
which they are united, would, in case of invasion or rebellion,
be supplied with succours from all the Swiss Republics.</P>
<P>THE Grisons contracted the first alliance with France in
1509 with Lewis the Twelfth, and in 1516 were comprised
<PB N="382" REF="396"/>
in the treaty of perpetual peace between Francis the First
and the Helvetic body. Since that period they have, as oc∣casion
offered, renewed their private confederacy with the
kings of France; but they were not comprehended in the late
treaty of Soleure, concluded between Louis the Sixteenth
and the other states of Switzerland. The king of France
maintains an envoy in this country, and has two Grison re∣giments
in his service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is probable, however, that they have since contracted a separate treaty with France.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN 1707 a treaty was formed between the Grisons on the
one side, queen Anne and the United Provinces on the
other, for permitting the free passage of troops marching
into Italy. This is the only alliance by which the Grisons,
as a particular state, are connected with England. Our court
formerly had a minister in the country, but for some time
the English envoy to the Swiss cantons resident at Berne, has
transacted business with this republic.</P>
<P>THE Venetians, for the purpose of procuring the free
passage of the Valteline, had often solicited an alliance with
the Grisons; but their projects were always defeated by the
influence of the Spanish monarch, who possessed the Mila∣nese;
nor were they able to effectuate the accomplishment
of their design, until the Spanish branch of the House of
Austria became extinct in the person of Charles the Second.
Soon after that event, when Milan was the object of conten∣tion
between the emperor and the French, the Venetians
obtained the consent of the Grisons to enter into a treaty of
<PB N="383" REF="397"/>
alliance offensive and defensive, which was ratified at Coire
the 17th of December 1706. By this accommodation it was
stipulated, among other articles on the side of the Venetians,
to pay an annual pension of 711 Spanish doubloons, and to
furnish the Grisons in time of war with a thousand Venetian
ducats per month: in return, the Grisons agreed to permit
the passage of the Venetian troops through the Valteline,
and to make a road leading from Morbegno over the moun∣tain
of St. Mark into the Venetian territories, by which ac∣commodation
the merchandise might be conveyed to and
from Venice to Germany without going through the Tyrol.</P>
<P>THIS treaty, concluded for twenty years, was to continue
in force for the same additional period, unless one of the
contracting parties should withdraw before the expiration of
the first term; but though obtained by the Venetians with
much trouble and expence, it was not long fulfilled by either
of the negociating powers. In a few years the Venetians
omitted payment of the annual pension, and the Grisons
neglected to make the road over the mountain of St. Mark.
The two republics, however, continued upon terms of amity;
and the Venetians, soon after the expiration of the forty
years, desirous of renewing the treaty, offered to discharge
the arrears of the pension, if the Grisons would open the pro∣posed
communication over the mountain of St. Mark. For
this purpose an envoy was dispatched to the Grisons in 1759,
and no promises were spared to promote the negociation: it
failed, however, through the influence of the empress of
Germany. The Grisons rejected the proposals of Venice,
and still further alienated that republic by the capitulation of
<PB N="384" REF="398"/>
Milan. In consequence of this conduct, the Venetians were
so incensed as to banish the Grisons who were settled within
their territories; and all connection is now interrupted be∣tween
the two republics.</P>
<P>THE treaties with the House of Austria, as sovereigns
of the Milanese, remain to be considered. It is not my
purpose to mention any treaties which the Grisons con∣tracted
with the dukes of Milan of the house of Sforza,
or those by which Philip the Second and his successors ac∣knowledged
their claim to the Valteline, Chiavenna, and
Bormio; but I shall begin with the celebrated alliance, or,
as it is called, the <HI>Capitulation</HI> of Milan in 1639; because it
superseded all others, and established that close connection
between the Grisons and the House of Austria, which has
since continued with little interruption.</P>
<P>THE following are the principal articles in this capitula∣tion,
concluded between Philip the Fourth, king of Spain, as
duke of Milan, and the Three Leagues: An hereditary and
perpetual peace between the two contracting powers:
Weekly fairs to be established in the neighbouring towns of
the Milanese, in which the Grisons may purchase grain, and
also enjoy a free trade, for the purpose of importing and ex∣porting
all kinds of merchandise and arms, upon paying
only the accustomed duties: A free passage through the ter∣ritories
of the Grisons for the Spanish troops, with a reserve,
that no more than a company of 150 infantry, and a troop of
60 cavalry, shall march through the same day: Free pas∣sage
of the Grison troops through the Milanese, upon con∣dition
<PB N="385" REF="399"/>
that they do not march against the allies of Spain,
and that more than two or three companies do not pass
at one time. The king may levy at his own expence, in
cases of necessity, a body of troops not exceeding 6000 nor
less than 2000, for his service against all his enemies, except
the confederates of the Grisons, and particularly the republic
of Venice. All Grison troops in the service of any state or
sovereign, intending to attack the territories of the king of
Spain shall be immediately recalled; and all officers and sol∣diers,
who enroll themselves in any foreign service, shall be
forbidden to invade his majesty's territories. Should the Gri∣sons
be engaged in war, the king obliges himself to furnish,
within fifteen days, 2000 infantry and 200 cavalry; but if
they prefer assistance in money, to pay 1000 scudi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Milanese scudo = to about 4 s. 6 d.</NOTE> per
month as long as the war lasts; also to send into the country
of Chiavenna six pieces of campaign artillery, with ammuni∣tion
sufficient for the service of the war. No troops shall be
allowed to pass through the respective territories to the
disadvantage of the two contracting parties. To each league
the king promises an annual pension of 1500 scudi; and also
to pay for the education of two students from each league
at Pavia or Milan, besides a donation of sixty scudi to each
student.</P>
<P>ALL ancient alliances with any other powers are permit∣ted
to remain in force on both sides, and on the part of the
Grisons, the continuance of their treaty with France is parti∣cularly
stipulated: they promise, however, that they will not
<PB N="386" REF="400"/>
renew it in case of a rupture between the two crowns; and
if renewed, they will declare at the same time that it is to be
suspended during such a rupture, and that they will not for
the future contract an alliance with any foreign power to
the prejudice of this perpetual peace. Should either par∣ties
be attacked, the other, without any regard to the sti∣pulations
in favour of their ancient allies, is bound to give
assistance, except however on his majesty's part, the German
branch of the House of Austria; if that house should engage
in war with the Grisons, for the maintenance of its rights in
the territory of the Grisons.</P>
<P>THE causes which gave rise to this capitulation, as well as
the articles respecting the Valteline, having been already
related<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 75.</NOTE>; it will be necessary only to remark, that the Spa∣niards
guaranteed to the Grisons the possession of their sub∣ject
provinces, and to the subjects the confirmation of their
privileges. In case of any dissention between the Grisons
and their subjects, the dispute is to be referred to the media∣tion
of the king of Spain.</P>
<P>THIS treaty, signed at Milan on the 3d of September 1639,
by the marquis de Legnes, governor of Milan, on the part of
the Spanish king, and on the other by the deputies of the
Three Leagues, was preserved inviolate, and a good under∣standing
maintained between the contracting powers, until
the extinction of the Spanish branch of the House of Austria
in the person of Charles the Second. During the war of
<PB N="387" REF="401"/>
the succession, which followed his death, the Milanese
frequently changed its masters, until it was secured to the
emperor Charles the Sixth by the peace of Utrecht. Charles
had no sooner firmly established his power in his new domi∣nions,
than he turned his attention to the Grisons, and pre∣vailed
upon them to renew the capitulation of Milan. One
of the principal arguments which gave success to his nego∣ciation,
was the promise, not only of continuing the annual
pension, but even of discharging the arrears, which
amounted to twenty-nine payments. This new treaty, in
which the German branch of the House of Austria succeeded
to the place of the Spanish, was concluded on the 24th of
October 1726, by count Daun, governor of Milan, in the
name of Charles the Sixth, and the deputies of the Three
Leagues. It confirmed and ratified the ancient capitulation
of 1639, with a few modifications and additions, of which
the principal are the following. The duties upon corn pur∣chased
by the Grisons in the Milanese are lowered two-thirds.
The tenth article in the first treaty, by which all
Grison troops in the service of any state designing to attack
the territories of the House of Austria are subject to
immediate recall, is annulled; and the Grisons are free to
serve any foreign prince in time of war without incurring
the breach of this capitulation. The number of students
educated at the expence of the emperor is increased to
twelve. On the 8th of February 1763, this hereditary
league was renewed by count Firmian, minister plenipoten∣tiary,
in the name of the empress of Germany as sovereign
of Milan, and the deputies of the Three Leagues. By this
treaty the capitulations of 1639 and 1726 are ratisied, and
<PB N="388" REF="402"/>
serve as the basis of the present union; they are also aug∣mented
by the following articles. The empress renounces all
right to the lake of Chiavenna, together with a small portion
of the adjacent territory, and cedes them in perpetuity to the
Grisons. The limits between the Milanese and the territory
of the Grisons are accurately fixed. In return for this
cession, the Grisons agree to erect no fortifications upon the
ceded territory, impose no new taxes upon the transport of
merchandise, make no new roads; and, according to the
former capitulation, no troops shall be permitted to pass to
the prejudice of the state of Milan. The empress promises
to obtain from the pope an abolition of several ecclesiastical
privileges in the Valteline, highly detrimental to society;
also to prevent the bishop of Como from granting ec∣clesiastical
privileges to those who, without entering into
orders, assume the clerical dress, and are thereby entitled to
the immunities of the church; also to correct several other
abuses, which render the clergy of the Valteline independent
of secular authority, and in civil and criminal causes only
amenable to the bishop of Como. The weekly fairs for the
purchase of grain are abolished, and in their stead the House
of Austria agrees to supply the Grisons with a certain quan∣tity
for themselves and for the subject countries, according
to the current price of corn in the Milanese. The duties
upon merchandise exported from the Milanese are lowered,
and the customs both in that country and in the territory
of the Grisons are established upon a permanent footing,
for which purpose a table of the duties is annexed to the
treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="403"/>
AT present the House of Austria directs all the affairs of
the Grisons with the most unbounded authority. That
power has acquired this sway by regularly discharging the
public pensions, by holding the leading members of the diet
in its pay, by being a guarantee of the Valteline, and media∣tor
in all the disputes between the Grisons and their sub∣jects.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LANGUAGES OF THE GRISONS—PARTICULARLY
THE ROMANSH—ITS ANTIQUITY—ORIGIN—
AND TWO PRINCIPAL DIALECTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE languages of the Grisons are the Italian, German,
and Romansh. The Italian, which is a jargon similar
to the Milanese dialect, is spoken by the inhabitants of Pre∣galia
and Puschiavo, and in the vallies of Masox and Ca∣lanca.</P>
<P>THE German is spoken throughout the whole League of
the Ten Jurisdictions, a few villages excepted; in the League
of God's House, at Avers, Coire, and the four villages; and
in the Grey League, at Splugen, Cepina, and other villages
of the Rheinwald, at Valts, in the valley of St. Pedro, at
Tusis, Reichenau, Feldsperg, Tamins, Meyerhof, Versam,
and Valendros.</P>
<P>SOME of the earliest and most authentic writers upon the
Grisons have asserted, that the natives of the Rheinwald
speak a Celtic idiom, a language neither German or Ro∣mansh,
but more similar to the German; although they are
entirely surrounded by people of a different tongue, and are
neither contiguous, nor have any great intercourse, with the
<PB N="391" REF="405"/>
German inhabitants. From this remarkable circumstance
they are led to conjecture, that the natives of the Rheinwald
are descended from the <HI>Lepontii,</HI> a Celtic nation, and consi∣dered
as the original inhabitants of this country before the
influx of the Tuscans; and they ground the proofs of this
assertion upon the numerous names of many castles which
seem to be derived from a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cluverius and other authors have er∣roneously supposed the Gothic and Celtic nations to have been the <HI>same,</HI> and their language to have given rise to the Teuto∣nic or German: but the learned translator (Dr. Percy, bishop of Dromore) of Mallet's Northern Antiquities, has established, be∣yond a doubt, that the Celtic and Gothic na∣tions were originally different, and that there was not the least affinity between the lan∣guages; the Celtic having given rise to the old Gallic, British, Erse, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the Gothic to the German. See Translator's Preface to Mallet's Northern Antiquities.</NOTE> Celtic or German origin. This
hypothesis, however, rests upon a wrong basis, and is
grounded upon two mistakes. For in the first place, the lan∣guage
of the Rheinwald is German; and, secondly, although
the inhabitants of this district are immediately surrounded
by persons speaking the Italian and Romansh, yet they are
within half a day's journey of Roncaglia, Tusis, and Furste∣nau,
where German is the common language. It is more
probable, therefore, that the Rheinwald was peopled by a
German colony, which penetrated into these regions in the
darker ages, when the Germans issued from their forests, and
spread themselves over Europe. With respect to the German
names of castles and towns we may remark, that many of
them are corrupted from the Romansh, that others have been
adopted in later times; and as a proof, that the Romansh is
more ancient in this country than the German, the greatest
part of the mountains, vallies, and oldest castles, have Ro∣mansh
<PB N="392" REF="406"/>
appellations, even in the districts inhabited by the
Germans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The German names adopted from the Romansh are very numerous; such as <HI>Chur</HI> from <HI>Curia</HI> or <HI>Coire, Splugen</HI> or <HI>Speluga, Ce∣pina, Tusis</HI> or <HI>Tossan, Davos, Pretigau</HI> or <HI>Rhetigoua, Castles,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The following German names are evi∣dently of a very late date: <HI>Furstenau, Fur∣stenberg, Haldenstein, Lichtenstein, Hein∣zenberg, Reichenau, Rheinwald,</HI> &amp;c. as will easily be allowed by any one conversant in that tongue.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS circumstance leads me to the consideration of the
Rhetian, or as it is more commonly called, the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>It is called by the natives</HI> Arumau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, Rumauns<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, Romansch, Lingua Romanscha.</NOTE> Romansh,
which is the vernacular tongue among the greatest part of
the Grisons; a language in former times more extensively
diffused than it is at present, being spoken at Coire and the
adjacent districts, and through the Tyrol, as far as Innspruck.
I had the good fortune to meet with a German translation of
Mr. Planta's excellent Treatise upon the Romansh of the Gri∣sons,
of which I had before seen the original in the Philoso∣phical
Transactions for 1775. The perusal of this treatise
first excited my inquiries; and although I am obliged to dif∣fer
from the ingenious author in a few instances, yet I hold
myself indebted to him, for having greatly facilitated my re∣searches,
and for a more accurate knowledge of the subject
than I could otherwise have obtained.</P>
<P>THE Romansh of this country is divided into two princi∣pal
dialects, the one spoken in the Grey League, and the
other in that of God's House. These two dialects, although
materially varying as to pronunciation and orthography, are
yet sufficiently similar in the general arrangement and ex∣pressions,
<PB N="393" REF="407"/>
to be comprised within the same inquiry. It must
always be extremely difficult to trace the origin of any lan∣guage:
for etymologists are too apt to build a favourite
system, by mistaking a partial for a general resemblance; and
finding a few similar expressions in two languages, which in
other respects are essentially different, conclude them to be
derived from the same stock. The Grison writers, however,
pretend, that the proofs of the antiquity and origin of their
language are too well founded to admit of the least doubt.
They assert that the Rhetian tongue is derived from the
Latin, or from a dialect of the Latin; and the arguments
upon which they ground their assertion may be reduced to
three principal heads. 1. The history of the country.
2. The names of places which have evidently a Latin origin.
3. Its similarity to the Latin, and to other languages derived
mediately or immediately from the Latin.</P>
<P>1. THE history of the country. Livy, who has given
the earliest account of these Alps, informs us, that under the
reign of Tarquinius Priscus, a colony of Tuscans, driven
from Lombardy by the Gauls, settled in these mountainous
regions; and the same historian adds, that in his time the
Rhetians, who were descended from these first colonists, still
retained some traces of the Tuscan pronunciation, although
vitiated by lapse of time and change of situation. Since
that period, we have no positive documents of any sub∣sequent
emigration, although it is probable, that upon many
occasions in which the Italians quitted their country, they
retired to these Alps, and mixed with the natives. In some
of these excursions it is likely, that the inhabitants of La∣tium,
<PB N="394" REF="408"/>
or others, who spoke the Latin, or at least a dialect of
that tongue, which must have had a considerable affinity to
the Tuscan, established themselves in these regions; but
whether this settlement happened during the invasion of
Hannibal, or at any subsequent period, cannot be exactly
ascertained. About the time of the Caesars, Rhetia became
an object of Roman conquest; and frequent expeditions
were made into these parts, until the whole country was
reduced to a Roman province, and governed by a praetor re∣sident
at Coire. During that period, many Roman families
established themselves in these Alps, and diffused the know∣ledge
of their language. On the decline of the Roman power,
Rhetia came under the dominion of the Franks, a German
nation. The new people introduced their own tongue into
many places; and in others, gave a new turn and modi∣fication
to the Latin, by the addition of auxiliary verbs, and
by the frequent use of the articles.</P>
<P>2. THE second proof of the derivation of the Romansh
from the Latin rests upon the numerous names of moun∣tains,
rivers, towns, and castles, which evidently seem to
have a Roman origin. To use the words of the ecclesiastical
historian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aporta, Hist. I. p. 6.</NOTE>, whom I have so often quoted; “Persons versed
in classic antiquity, who travel among the Grisons, will,
from the frequency of Latin appellations, conceive that they
are passing through Latium, Etruria, and Campania. They
will trace the ancient names <HI>Ardeates, Vettones, Sentinates,
Samnites,</HI> in Ardets, Vettan, Sent, and Samnun. They will
<PB N="395" REF="409"/>
meet with mount <HI>Umbria,</HI> the river <HI>Albula,</HI> the towns <HI>An∣tium,
Susa, Lavinium, Tutium, Seaptia, Silium, Cernetia,</HI> and
many others: derivations so plain and so frequently occur∣ring
evidently certify their origin.”</P>
<P>3. THE affinity of the Romansh, as well to the Latin,
as to the languages immediately derived from the Latin.
First, a collateral argument in favour of its derivation from
the Latin may be deduced from the word <HI>Romansh,</HI> the
general appellation of the language, and the particular
dialect of Engadina, called <HI>Ladin;</HI> both these terms having
in effect the same signification, <HI>Latin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Latin and Ladin are the same words, only differently pronounced: for it must be evident to any one the least conversant with different languages, how often the <HI>t</HI> and the <HI>d</HI> are substituted for each other. Quinti∣lian says that the old Romans frequently wrote a <HI>t,</HI> before they had any fixed rules of orthography, instead of a <HI>d;</HI> for Alexander—Alexanter.</NOTE> and <HI>Roman</HI> being
synonymous. But without insisting too much on this con∣jecture,
we need only refer to a book written in the Grison
tongue, to perceive the general affinity of its vocabulary to
that of the Latin. In this comparison, however, great allow∣ance
must be made for the variation, which must have taken
place between a mother tongue, as written in the best
authors, and its offspring, which for many centuries was
merely colloquial, and which has not only been occasionally
intermixed with other languages, but has suffered a change
in its general modification by the admission of the German
syntax.</P>
<P>YET it by no means follows, that the Romansh, although
the undoubted offspring of the Latin, should have been
<PB N="396" REF="410"/>
derived immediately from that language, such as it is found
in the best authors, or as configned to writing during any
period of the Roman aera; but rather, that it owed its origin
to the vulgar tongue, as it was spoken by the people, or to
some provincial dialect of Italy. In all living tongues there
is a colloquial as well as a written language: for how
different are the English and Scottish idioms, and even the
dialects of Lancashire and Norfolk? In France the Parisian
accent varies essentially from the provincial pronunciation;
and the several Patois of Provence, Lorraine, and Gascony,
cannot be understood without respective glossaries. The
same circumstance prevails in Germany, where the idioms
of the Saxons, Austrians, and Suabians, are scarcely in∣telligible
to each other. That this was equally the case with
the Latin, we may collect not only from the general analogy
of language, but likewise from the testimony of the best
authors.</P>
<P>THE origin of the Italian and of the other dialects,
which are derived principally from the Latin, is frequently
attributed to the invasion of the Goths under Alaric; when a
new language was introduced throughout Italy and the Ro∣man
provinces. But this is not precisely the truth; for these
several dialects arose from a corruption, or at least a va∣riation,
in the primitive Latin, antecedent to the irruption of
the Goths, or even to the times of the Caesars. Italy was oc∣cupied
by many people originally independent: the <HI>Umbri,
Osci, Samnites, Etrusci,</HI> and <HI>Piceni,</HI> all of whom differed in
dialect, and many in language from the Romans. But
the latter had no sooner conquered Italy, than the Latin
<PB N="397" REF="411"/>
language came into general use, though in the several
provinces it was not uniformly pronounced in the same
manner; as the natives of every district varied in their mode
of articulation. Cicero mentions several<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amongst other examples he says, that the people instead of <HI>diem hanc</HI> pronounced <HI>di hanc,</HI> and <HI>cauneas</HI> instead of <HI>cave ne cas.</HI></NOTE> corruptions of the
Latin which he could scarcely comprehend; and Horace al∣ludes
to the people of Canusium, in <HI>Graecia Magna,</HI> as speak∣ing
a mixed language<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Cum Pedius caussas exsudet Poplicola atque</L>
<L>Corvinus, patriis intermiscere petita</L>
<L>Verba foris malis, Canusini more <HI>BILINGUIS?</HI></L>
<L>Lib. I. Sat. x. v. 30.</L></Q></NOTE>. Canusium contained, besides the
original Greek natives, many inhabitants from different
parts of Italy, who spoke Latin. Hence their language
was a mixture of both Greek and Latin; but so extremely
impure, as to give rise to the proverb, <HI>Canusini more bi∣linguis.</HI></P>
<P>IN Italy there must have been many idioms of this sort,
which were for a long time unobserved. For while Rome
flourished, the language of that capital was the standard of
purity; and all other dialects of the Latin were disregarded.
Yet, even at Rome itself, the Latin was corrupted at a very
early period. Suetonius<NOTE N="Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Non literas modo sed syllabas permutat aut praeterit. Communis hominum error.</NOTE> relates, that Augustus frequently af∣fected
to write words as they were pronounced, without any
regard to orthography; and to abridge them, by the change
or omission of syllables. If this was the practice of the sove∣reign
himself, in the purity of the Augustan age, and in the
<PB N="398" REF="412"/>
capital, we may be assured, that the same custom was still
more prevalent among the people, in the distant provinces,
and particularly towards the decline of the empire. Thus
the Latin tongue was growing gradually more corrupt, and
would, in process of time, have almost totally varied from its
primitive purity, even if Rome had continued to be the seat
of empire; yet it may be allowed, that its decline was
hastened by the irruption of the Goths.</P>
<P>SHOULD these remarks be founded on fact, the Romans
must have left traces of their language throughout the dif∣ferent
provinces of their vast empire; and the several
dialects derived from the colloquial Latin, before they were
refined and polished, must have borne a resemblance to each
other, in some places more striking, in others more faint and
distant. And although these dialects were in some measure
changed and modified by the introduction of the Gothic or
German idiom, which the conquerors gradually established
throughout the Roman provinces; yet the same affinity
must have been still observed: those changes affected <HI>all</HI> the
dialects, and consisted not so much in varying the expressions,
as in giving a new modification to the general syntax, by
the introduction of the auxiliary verbs, by the indeclen∣sion
of the cases, and by the necessary use of prepositions
and articles.</P>
<P>IF therefore the Romans established themselves in the
country of the Grisons so effectually as to introduce their
own language; and if that tongue, derived from the collo∣quial
Latin, and still further modified by the adoption of the
<PB N="399" REF="413"/>
German syntax, is, from the peculiar situation of the natives,
and from its not having been consigned to writing till within
these last two hundred years, little changed from its primi∣tive
state; we have reason to expect, that it should bear
evident marks of affinity to those dialects which have ori∣ginated
from the colloquial Latin, and were equally modified
by the German syntax; it follows also, that the resemblance
will be greater in proportion as we can trace earlier and
ruder specimens: and this analogy is consonant to expe∣rience.
The earliest language, which undoubtedly draws its
origin from the colloquial Latin, is the ancient Romansh,
called <HI>Lingua Romana,</HI> the mother of the French tongue. It
was understood in Italy, in the Morea, and Constantinople,
and was universally diffused throughout the southern parts
of Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Mr. Planta,
in the treatise to which I alluded at the beginning of this
letter, has unquestionably proved that this tongue and the
Romansh of the Grisons are the same language.</P>
<P>WE cannot expect, perhaps, the same evident affinity
between the Romansh of the Grisons and any other lan∣guage
now existing; but in comparing it with the Italian,
and particularly some provincial dialects of Italy, the
Spanish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In comparing it with the Spanish, we must exclude those words which have a strong guttural pronunciation, and are evidently derived from the Arabic.</NOTE>, the Patois of Provence, Languedoc, Gascony,
and Lorraine, we shall easily perceive, that they originated
from the same stock, with the difference which time, a va∣riety
of pronunciation, and the mixture of other tongues,
<PB N="400" REF="414"/>
must necessarily occasion in all languages. With respect to
the Italian, it is remarkable that the Romansh less resem∣bles
the pure Tuscan idiom than the provincial dialects; a
circumstance easily accounted for. The Tuscan has been
gradually purified and refined, until it has undergone a total
change from its original state; and the provincial dialects,
being less committed to writing, have not been subject to
such variation.</P>
<P>To these languages I may add that spoken by the
Vaudois, inhabiting the valleys of Piedmont, in the sixteenth
century, of which Leger has printed specimens, the ori∣ginals
whereof are now extant in the public library at
Cambridge, and also the Wallachian tongue. The latter is
derived from the Latin, introduced by the colony of Ro∣mans,
which Trajan established in those parts. The present
natives, descendants of that colony, although surrounded by
people speaking the Hungarian and Sclavonian, talk a lan∣guage
in which evident traces of the original Latin are
still preserved. It bears a general resemblance to the Italian;
and Mr. Aporta, who passed some time in Hungary, in∣formed
me, that, allowing for the variety of pronuncia∣tion,
he comprehended the natives, and found in their
expressions no inconsiderable degree of assinity to the
Romansh.</P>
<P>THE Romansh of the Grisons, as I have before observed,
is divided into two principal dialects, that of the Grey League
and the <HI>Ladin</HI> of Engadina; for it is needless to mention se∣parately
the Romansh spoken in the valleys of Munster and
<PB N="401" REF="415"/>
Surset. The two dialects perfectly agree in the grammatical
arrangement, but differ widely in the pronunciation and or∣thography:
of the two, the <HI>Ladin,</HI> being less intermixed
with foreign words, is the purest; the Romansh of the Grey
League, from the number of German colonies blended with
the natives, abounds more in German expressions.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ladin</HI> is divided into the two idioms of Upper and
Lower Engadina: the vocabulary of both is the same, with a
small variety of accent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To give an instance of this difference.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Lower Engadina pronounce the <HI>a</HI> open as we do in <HI>war,</HI> while those of Upper Engadina use an <HI>ae</HI> instead of the <HI>a.</HI>

chiefly from the different manner of articulating the vowels.
The inhabitants of Lower Engadina speak with a broader
accent, like the Dorians among the Greeks; while those of
Upper Engadina, like the Ionians, use a softer pronunciation.
Hence is derived a variety in the orthography of the two
idioms: and books, although perfectly understood by both,
are printed somewhat differently in the two districts.</P>
<P>BEFORE the introduction of the reformation among the
Grisons, the Romansh was esteemed so barbarous a jargon as
to be thought incapable of being reduced to grammatical ac∣curacy
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aporta, lib. 2. p. 403.</NOTE>. It is no wonder, that the monks, whose interest it
<PB N="402" REF="416"/>
was to keep the people in the grossest ignorance, should have
favoured this opinion; but it is a matter of astonishment,
that the most learned among the native laics, and such in∣telligent
foreigners as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rhaetica lingua tam perplexa et impe∣dita est, ut scribi nequeat; unde omnes literae ab antiquis consectae, Latine scriptae sunt, et quas hodie parant, Germanice scribi procu∣rant. <HI>See Tschudi Alp.

supported a notion so contradictory to common sense. For
although it is an evident axiom, that all living tongues may
be reduced to certain principles, and consigned to writing;
yet the barbarism of the Romansh was so universally preva∣lent,
that no attempt was made to write it before the sixteenth
century. The person to whom the Grisons owe the first
production in their native tongue, was John de Travers; a
man who blending the characters of the soldier, politician,
scholar, and divine, performed the most essential services
to his country; by his valour in arms, by his skill in ne∣gociation,
by cultivating and protecting letters, and by fa∣vouring
and assisting the introduction of the reformed
religion.</P>
<P>THIS respectable person, of a noble and opulent family
of Zutz in Upper Engadina, was born in 1483: before the
eighth year of his age he was sent for his education to
Munich, and from thence into Transylvania. Being there
seized with a desire of travelling, he remained absent thir∣teen
years: and returned to Zutz about the 28th year of his
<PB N="403" REF="417"/>
age. Highly distinguished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ille quidem anno 1483 natus, bis Vallis Tellinae Gubernator, Episcopalis Aulae Cura∣tor, plurimis ad exteros Principes legationibus clarus, in Patria vero omnibus honoris gra∣dibus nactus, eruditione, dexteritate, et auc∣toritate unus in Raetia florebat; ut Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pub∣licae lumen, sidus, et decus merito habeatur.

I. p.</HI> 229.</NOTE> for integrity, learning, and
abilities, he acquired universal esteem; and was raised to
every honour which his grateful country was capable of
bestowing. Indeed such was the respect generally shewn
to his superior talents, that no affair of moment was trans∣acted
by the Republic of the Grisons in which he was not
consulted. His acquaintance with foreign languages, his
knowledge of the world, and the politeness of his address,
rendered him the fittest instrument to negotiate with foreign
powers; and he always acquitted himself with honour of
the trust which was reposed in him. In a military line he
greatly signalized himself as commander of the Grison forces
against James of Medicis, for the rapidity of his movements,
his personal valour, and cautious conduct; and by laying siege
to the fortress of Musson<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Situated near the Lake of Como, not far from Gravedona.</NOTE>, he brought the campaign to a
speedy and successful issue.</P>
<P>HE was greatly instrumental in forwarding the progress
of the reformation. Although inclined to favour the new
doctrines, yet he was never hurried away by a misguided
zeal. Averse to renounce the religion in which he had been
educated, without the strongest conviction of its superstitious
<PB N="404" REF="418"/>
tendency, he studied the controversy between the two sects,
and weighed the arguments on both sides with the utmost
deliberation; but he no sooner became a proselyte to the
reformed opinions, than he shewed himself as zealous in
promoting, as he had previously been circumspect in adopt∣ing
them. Nor did he only favour the reformation by his
example and authority, but he even promulgated its doc∣trines.
As few natives of Engadina were qualified, by
their learning and theological knowledge, to preach in the
Ladin, the progress of the reformation was considerably
retarded. For these reasons John de Travers, who had cri∣tically
studied and written in his own tongue, condescended
to instruct the people. Having obtained permission of the
church, he ascended the pulpit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stupuit tunc ordo Evangelicus, stupuit tota Raetia contemplans eximium inclitumque Heroa, inter Raetiae gentis optimates, diu principem habitum, summis etiam, patriae honoribus, debito virtutibus premio insignitum, senio nunc confec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um suggestu in publica sacra aede conscenso, populum docere, et alia Ecclesia∣stica munia, quando res poscebat, operam suam cum ordinario Ministro conjungendo, et labo∣rem participando, summo audientium applausu undique ex locis cirea vicinis, integris turmis ad ejus sermones audiendos confluentibus, obiit. <HI>Aporta, tom. p.</HI> 239.</NOTE>, and explained in the most
perspicuous manner the Christian doctrines. His distin∣guished
abilities, his exalted rank, his venerable age, and his
amiable character, drew from all quarters a numerous au∣dience;
while his discourses, delivered with a noble simpli∣city
of eloquence, made the deepest impression, and never
failed to increase the number of proselytes. This respect∣able
man finished his career, which had been so useful to
his country, and so honourable to himself, in 1563, and in
the 80th year of his age. His writings in the Ladin, which
<PB N="405" REF="419"/>
gave rise to this digression, were, a poem in rhyme, de∣scribing
the war of Musson; many sermons; and several
sacred dramas in verse.</P>
<P>THE example of committing the Ladin to writing was
next followed by Philip Salutz, called Gallicius, one of the
earliest reformers among the Grisons; who, in 1534, trans∣lated
the Lord's prayer, the Apostles' creed, and the deca∣logue,
into the dialect of Lower Engadina; and not long
afterwards, from the Hebrew into the same language, some
chapters of Genesis, and the Athanasian Creed; which
were distributed in manuscript among the natives. Huldric
Campel wrote several sacred dramas, in the representation of
which he himself assisted; and also turned some of the
psalms into verse.</P>
<P>BUT these compositions, being only to be found in manu∣script,
were too scarce to be of general use; and James Tuts∣chet,
of Samada, more known by the name of Biveronius,
was the first who ventured to publish in his native tongue.
That celebrated reformer finding, from experience, that the
want of religious books in the colloquial language was a
great obstruction to the progress of the reformation, printed
at Puschiavo, in 1560, a small work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I possess a copy of this scarce work, re∣printed at Zuric 1621, but without the title page. At my request the learned M. Aporta favoured me with an accurate cata∣logue of all the books printed in the Romansh of Engadina and of the Grey League, ac∣companied with many critical remarks, which I have made use of in this letter.</P>
<P>I once proposed to have printed this catalogue; which gives the titles of 82 books printed in the Ladin, and 26 in the Romansh of the Grey League; but relin∣quished it on considering that it would have swelled this work too much; and would be uninteresting to the generality of my readers. I shall, therefore, only insert, at the end of this letter, the titles of the Bibles, and of the books printed in the 16th century; together with a vocabulary of the language.</P></NOTE>, which contained an al∣phabet,
<PB N="406" REF="420"/>
the Lord's prayer, the Apostles' creed, the Ten
Commandments, and several occasional prayers. This little
publication being well received, was followed by a work of
the greatest importance, a translation of the New Testa∣ment
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N° 1.</NOTE>. In 1562 Huldric Campel printed the Psalms<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">N° 3.</NOTE>
of David, and other hymns done into verse, for the use of
the reformed churches: this publication afforded a striking
proof of the author's genius and taste, that he was able to
give so much harmony of metre and variety of rhymes to
the language in so rude a state. Besides the benefits which
this psalter produced in a religious light, it was serviceable
in a literary view, as it contributed to diffuse a taste for po∣etical
composition among his countrymen; and convinced
them that divine truths might be inculcated in a pleasing
diction. Mr. Aporta, in his excellent History of the Refor∣màtion
among the Grisons, says that the language of Bive∣ronius
is (like infant dialects) so rude and unpolished, both
as to the mode of expression and orthography, that it is
scarcely understood at present; that Campel greatly refined
it, and endeavoured as much as possible to reduce the words
and orthography to a similarity with the Latin, which was
the original mother tongue. Hence we may observe, that
the publications of Biveronius afford the most curious spe∣cimen
<PB N="407" REF="421"/>
of the Ladin, as it existed in its most ancient state,
when it was chiefly a colloquial language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I shall insert as a specimen of his language in the end of this letter, the Apostles' Creed, published in 1571. N° 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE possibility of writing and printing the Ladin was no
sooner proved by such authorities, than the press teemed
with productions calculated to disseminate the reformed
opinions. These publications, however, (not excepting
even the performance of Campel) as well as all which ap∣peared
in the fifteenth and in the beginning of the sixteenth
century, are now obsolete; and, without a glossary, almost
unintelligible to the natives themselves, who have not made
them the object of their particular study.</P>
<P>No version of the whole Bible was published in the
Ladin before the year 1679: it was printed at Scuol<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">N° 5.</NOTE>, in the
dialect of Lower Engadina; and republished, with various
explanations and a new index, in 1743. Besides the trans∣lation
of the New Testament by Biveronius, which is obsolete,
a new<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">N° 6.</NOTE> version was printed in 1640 in the dialect of Upper
Engadina, and is in common use. But the natives of this
district have no other version of the Old Testament than
that of Lower Engadina.</P>
<P>As it would be uninteresting to send you a dry catalogue
of the several publications in the Ladin, I shall therefore
only remark in general, that except a history<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">N° 7.</NOTE> of the Gri∣sons,
compiled from various authors by Aporta, the books
<PB N="408" REF="422"/>
in this tongue solely treat of religious subjects. Some of our
theological tracts, particularly written by our divines of the
last century, are translated into their language; of these I
observed, among the list of books in my possession, Bayley's
Practice of Piety, and Baxter on Vows.</P>
<P>THE Romansh of the Grey League remains to be con∣sidered.
The earliest publication in this dialect is a cate∣chism
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N° 8.</NOTE>, translated from the German by Daniel Boniface,
pastor of Furstenau, and printed in 1601. It was soon fol∣lowed
by a metrical version of several psalms<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">N° 9.</NOTE>, accompanied
with other hymns, published at Coire in 1611. The author
of this useful psalter was Stephen Gabriel, a native of Vet∣tan,
in Lower Engadina, and pastor of Ilants: he was a man
of considerable learning; and his zeal for the reformed re∣ligion
exposed him to the fury of the Catholics, who, in 1620,
plundered his house, burnt his library, and hanged him in
effigy. Gabriel having escaped to Zuric, drew up, during
his retirement, an account of that controversy between the
Protestants and Roman Catholics, which in those turbulent
times nearly excited a civil war among the Grisons. This
polemic treatise, written in the Romansh, was printed at
Zuric in 1625; and was answered in 1630 by a Roman
Catholic priest, in the same tongue: a work which is proba∣bly
the first production printed by the Catholics in the
Romansh. Upon the cessation of the civil commotions
Gabriel returned to Ilants, where he passed the remainder of
his days in tranquillity.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="423"/>
STEPHEN was succeeded in his preferment and literary
pursuits by his son Lucius Gabriel, who, in 1648, gave a
version of the New Testament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N° 10.</NOTE>; a work much wanted, as
the inhabitants of the Grey League were mostly ignorant of
any but their own language, and could with difficulty
comprehend the translation in the dialect of Engadina. It
is remarkable, that this version, which was printed only
forty-eight years after the Romansh of the Grey League
became a written language, should still continue in use; a
proof either, that the language has not received that degree
of refinement which the Ladin has experienced; or that
the first persons who wrote in this idiom took great pains to
settle the orthography, and arrange the grammatical con∣struction.
The list of books published in this dialect are,
for the most part, far inferior, both as to number and merit,
to those written in the Ladin; for, excepting the two Ga∣briels,
the Grey League has furnished few men who have
distinguished themselves by superior learning.</P>
<P>A COMPLETE translation of the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">N° 11.</NOTE> Bible was not given before
the year 1718: it was published at Coire, at the expence of
the Clergy of the Grey League, and dedicated by the printer
to George the First, who sent in return a present of fifty
guineas. This sum being delivered to the printer, and
claimed by him as his own property, occasioned a law-suit
between him and the editors: the latter, however, although
in equity they had the sole right, were never able to obtain
any part of the donation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 91.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FROM DAVID PENNANT, ESQ. TO THE AUTHOR.
ON THE ITALIAN BAILLIAGES OF SWITZERLAND—
JOURNEY FROM THE TOP OF THE ST. GOTHARD
TO MILAN—THE LEVANTINE VALLEY—BELLIN∣ZONE
—LOCARNO—TOWN AND LAKE OF LUGANO—
LAGO MAGGIORE—BOROMEAN ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LITTLE is wanting to complete your description of
Switzerland and its dependencies; that chasm I now en∣deavour
to fill up. Youth and inexperience must serve as
excuses for errors and omissions. Happy if this hasty sketch
may excite the curiosity of yourself, or any other traveller
equally intelligent, whose observations may amuse and in∣struct
mankind. The route which I here attempt to
describe, is connected with your work; a route which would
afford satisfaction to the curious of all nations who take you
as their guide.</P>
<P>THE highest parts of the principal Alpine passes are
usually occupied by a small plain or bason; as the St. Ber∣nard,
the Gemmi, the Splugen, and the St. Gothard. From
the summit of the St. Gothard I commenced my route on
the 2d of August 1786. I followed the course of the Tesino,
which you mention in your letters: it passes by the Capuchin
convent, and is soon after joined by two other rills from the
<PB N="414" REF="428"/>
neighbouring mountains. Near this spot the Levantine
valley begins, and Switzerland, properly so called, may be
said to terminate. The descent on the side of Italy is much
steeper, and the views more savage and picturesque, than in
the ascent from Urseren; and the road is conducted with
equal skill. The majestic scenery is heightened by the
Tesino tumbling in an almost uninterrupted cataract; some∣times
pent up in a narrow channel, or piercing its way
through the remains of Avalanches, still unmelted though
fully exposed to the rays of a meridian sun. These enor∣mous
masses obstruct the road; and workmen are conti∣nually
employed in promoting their dissolution; as the ag∣gregate
of unmelted snows, for a few summers, would bar
all communication between Switzerland and Italy: with
such difficulty are the few passes kept open!</P>
<P>AFTER descending rapidly for three miles through this
scene of desolation, bounded on all sides by precipices, or im∣pending
rocks, the river foaming over blocks of granite, the
ruins of the surrounding mountains; we crossed the <HI>Ponte
Tremolo,</HI> or trembling bridge; where the view enlarged, and
extended over a verdant valley sprinkled with numerous
houses. Airolo, the first small burgh, stands at the bottom
of the steep descent; to the right is the passage over mount
Grias to Munster in the Upper Vallais, practicable only from
the middle of July to October, when 300 horses transport
weekly the cheese from the various parts of Switzerland.</P>
<P>AT Dacio we found comfortable accommodations: that
village consists only of a few houses, seated at the entrance
<PB N="415" REF="429"/>
of a pass, capable of being defended with ease against the
whole force of Italy. A wall and gate is added to its natural
strength, but their principal use is to prevent contraband
trade, and to exact also a small toll for the merchandise
which passes that way. For half a league from hence is a
succession of striking and romantic scenery; the perpen∣dicular
rocks scarcely affording room for the steep road, and
transparent waters of the Tesino, which, thundering over the
vast fragments, rises in a white foam, and subtle mist, visible
only from refracting the rays of the sun. We crossed the
torrent, in that short space, over three bridges thrown from
rock to rock, whose span and boldness of execution might
vie with the boasted, because better known, Devil's Bridge.
Faido is the residence of the bailif, nominated by the canton
of Uri. He remains in office four years, and his power is
almost unlimited. Unfortunate insurrections in 1712, and in
1755, have been attended with the loss of the few remaining
privileges to a people who struggled for perfect liberty.
Giornico, called by the Germans Irnis, is famous for the
victory which 600 Swiss gained, in 1478, over the troops of
the duke of Milan, amounting to 15, 000 men; a victory
which ensured to the Swiss an honourable and advantageous
peace. In this neighbourhood we first perceived the effects
of a southern sun, and a lesser elevation above the sea, by the
frequent appearance of vineyards, and the walnut and
chesnut-trees of a very large size; the girth of several among
the latter was not less than thirty feet. At Polegio, this bail∣liage
ends.</P>
<P>THE Levantine Valley, or <HI>Valle Levantina,</HI> is supposed to
retain, by its name, traces of the <HI>Lepontii,</HI> the antient inha∣bitants
<PB N="416" REF="430"/>
of the surrounding regions. Its length, counting from
the summit of the passage on the St. Gothard, is about eight
leagues: the breadth very inconsiderable. The lower part
is extremely populous, rich in pasturage, and produces much
hemp and flax. In the neighbourhood of such lofty moun∣tains,
its climate must be variable, and liable to frequent
rains. In order to prevent these rains from damaging their
crops, the inhabitants suspend and dry the corn and grass on
several bars supported by two high poles about fifteen feet
asunder. The houses are entirely of wood, and have exter∣nally
the appearance of Swiss cottages; but a neglect of
cleanliness proves the vicinity and greater similarity to the
Italians. The Tesino is here joined by the Bromio, a torrent
which takes its rise in mount Uccello, or the Vogelsberg,
near Splugen; a bridge over it is the boundary of the two
bailliages of the valleys Levantine and Polese, and leads into
that of Riviera. The valley now becomes perfectly flat, and
of course subject to violent inundations; the few villages
are scattered on the sides of the steep mountains; below all
is desolate. Ossogna, the residence of the bailif, consists only
of a few houses. The country soon improved; the ground
rose gently from the bed of the river, when we came in
sight of the beautiful town of Bellinzone, situated in a de∣lightful
plain, encircled with ancient walls and battlements
in good repair: to the right, rise majestically the ruins of
an ancient castle; to the left, separately embosomed in trees,
are the castles of the bailifs of the three regent cantons, Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden.</P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of the fifteenth century, the Swiss,
at peace with the House of Austria, seem first to have been sti∣mulated
<PB N="417" REF="431"/>
with the ambition of extending their dominions
towards the south. In 1410, the whole Helvetic body, ex∣cepting
the canton of Berne, passed their natural barriers,
plundered the town of Domo d'Oscella, and the adjacent
country, and returned laden with spoil to pass the winter in
their humble cottages. Elevated by success, the ensuing
summer saw them again descend into the plains of Italy, and
ravage the duchy of Milan, then subject to the Viscontis.
They again retired, but without attempting to make a settle∣ment.
Bent on these enterprises, we are not surprised, that,
in 1422, the three original cantons purchased the town of
Bellinzone from its owners the counts of Sax; or that Philip
Maria, duke of Milan, exerted himself to prevent from
falling into their hands a town so important, from its situa∣tion
and natural strength, to check their inroads, and cover
his dominions. Having therefore taken possession of it by
force of arms; a body of 8000 Swiss passed the Alps. The
forces of both nations met; the Italians were led on by
Carmagnola; a bloody battle ensued, of which both sides
claimed the victory; the Swiss retired with a standard taken
from the enemy, who remained masters of the town.</P>
<P>EXCEPTING some inroads, nothing of importance was
again transacted to the south till the year 1466, when Ga∣leazzo
Maria Sforza, the new duke of Milan, formed an
alliance with his transalpine neighbours; the first article was
the cession of the Levantine Valley to the canton of Uri, for
which he was annually to receive three hawks and a cross∣bow.
Yet ten years after, when Charles duke of Burgundy
threatened the total destruction of the republic by his power∣ful
<PB N="418" REF="432"/>
invasions, the treacherous duke of Milan sent a body of
troops to his assistance, who were intercepted in the Vallais
and worsted. On the defeat and death of Charles at the
battle of Nancy, they again resolved to make an attempt on
Bellinzone: but as the season was too far advanced to under∣take
the siege, a body of 600 Swiss resolved to winter at
Giornico. The duke collected an army of 15, 000 men, and
attacked them in their entrenchments, but was repulsed
with the loss of 1400 of his best troops. The mountaineers
were enriched with the spoils; but no regular attack was
made on the object of their invasion.</P>
<P>FROM this period the wars in which the Swiss engaged
no ways concerned themselves: they sacrificed their blood
in foreign quarrels, and the contending parties made use of
their superior valour to attempt or establish conquests in
Italy. In 1500 the three cantons obtained what they had so
long contended for. The inhabitants of Bellinzone, vexed
by the frequent changes in the Milanese, voluntarily sur∣rendered
to them. The French, when they had conquered
the duchy, in vain reclaimed it; the Swiss retained pos∣session;
and the seven Italian bailliages were formally ceded
to them by Maximilian Sforza, in gratitude for their having
reinstated him in the ducal seat. Courted or feared by all
parties, those valuable territories were confirmed to them by
the French, and finally by the House of Austria.</P>
<P>THE bailif remains in office two years; he is nominated
reciprocally by the three cantons, and is generally removed
from Riviera the poorest, to Bellinzone the most lucrative of
<PB N="419" REF="433"/>
the three governments. An appeal lies from his decision to
the syndicate, and from that court to the three cantons. In
ecclesiastical affairs, the inhabitants are cognizable to the
bishop of Como, excepting three parishes. Most of the
natives understand Italian, but the language is a corrupt
German.</P>
<P>THE interior of Bellinzone by no means corresponds with
its external beauty and situation; the streets are narrow, and
the houses ill built. We continued our journey south on the
banks of the Tesino, which we crossed in a bad ferry; that
river is here increased to a very considerable size, by the nu∣merous
additions it has received in its course, particularly by
the Musa, a torrent which takes its rise in the St. Bernardin,
and flowing down the Val Masox, forms a junction above
Bellinzone. The valley is level, and laid waste by numerous
torrents: the road runs along the sides of the hills through
continued vineyards. We proceeded at the foot of the
western chain of hills; a similar ridge bounds the view to
the East, both clothed to their summits with woods of chesnut
and walnut trees, half concealing frequent spires and nume∣rous
hamlets. Before us the view extended to a part of the
Milanese over the lake of Locarno, or Lago Maggiore.
Having reached its north-western extremity, we coasted its
banks for two or three miles; and arrived at the town from
which it derives its name. Locarno contains about 1500 in∣habitants.
Part of the town is built on piazzas in form
of a crescent with two wings; in front is a row of trees, and
a public walk; the old part of the town is dirty, and the
streets narrow. It contains three convents, and a small Fran∣ciscan
<PB N="420" REF="434"/>
monastery, perched on a rock overhanging the valley,
and commanding a superb view of the lake, and its magnifi∣cent
boundaries. The canopy, in the church of the Ca∣puchins,
deserves to be mentioned for its beautiful execu∣tion:
it is of straw-work, and almost rivals velvet and
gold fringe.</P>
<P>OF the four transalpine bailliages which belong to the
twelve cantons, Lugano holds the princpal rank; Locarno
the second. The governor or commissary, as he is called, is
sent in succession by all the cantons except Appenzel; he
remains in office two years; in criminal affairs his deci∣sion
is absolute, in civil an appeal lies to the annual syndicate
from the regent cantons, and from thence to the Helvetic
body assembled at the diet. The emoluments of this post
are not great; but the profits unfortunately depend too
much on the virtue of the man, as they arise principally
from fines exacted for criminal offences. The people enjoy
some privileges, and hold an annual assembly in the month
of January, in which they elect twenty counsellors; twelve
out of the town, three from Ascona, the remainder from the
country at large. These counsellors have the charge of watch∣ing
over the interests of the republic, as far as does not inter∣fere
with the superior powers, of settling the public expences,
and of raising the supplies paid to the governor. These
bailliages do not raise corn sufficient for their domestic con∣sumption;
that grain is furnished by treaty from the duchy
of Milan, and is weekly imported from Livino, a village on
the opposite shore. The chief food of the peasants is a cake
made with maize and millet: the inhabitants on the banks
<PB N="421" REF="435"/>
of the lake are well supplied with fish. The fisheries give
employment to a great number of hands, although they are
in some degree subject to monopolies. In the months of May
and June, from 200 to 250 lb. weight are taken in a day;
trout of 40 lb. and perch of 9 lb. are found in the lake.</P>
<P>IN 1555, the doctrines of the reformation had made con∣siderable
progress in these parts: but the Catholic cantons, at
the general diet, obtained an edict, that those who refused to
return to the antient faith should quit the town and pro∣vince.
Numbers, thus driven from their native country,
were received with open arms by the canton of Zuric,
which was benefited by their industry, and owes to them
the introduction of their silk manufactures.</P>
<P>LOCARNO once was situated on the lake, and had a port
capable of receiving large barks: at present it stands at the
distance of a quarter of a mile; a circumstance owing to
the accumulation of sand brought down by the torrent
Maggia. The little voyage from hence to Magadino is de∣lightful:
we crossed the upper part of the lake in an hour;
the banks of this noble piece of water rise boldly, and are
well wooded; Locarno forms a fine object, to the south of it
is the opening into the Val Maggia, terminated by moun∣tains
covered with eternal snow. The spot where we
landed consists only of a few scattered houses, for the
purpose of receiving the merchandize, which is put on
shore and sent on horses to Bellinzone. Old Magadino is
more inland, and owed its origin to the vicinity of the lake,
<PB N="422" REF="436"/>
the retiring of which has caused its ruin: from thence the
road winds up the steep sides of the mountain Cenero,
through woods of walnut and chesnut-trees, interspersed
with oak and holly; on the summit of the passage is a small
oval plain, the boundary of the bailliages of Locarno and
Lugano. Our descent lay between the hills, through lux∣uriant
and verdant vallies, peopled with numerous villages,
and rich in every production. The vines, laden with fruit,
are conducted in elegant festoons from tree to tree; a con∣stant
variety of scenery, softened by the glow of a setting
sun, and next silvered by the moon glimmering on the dis∣tant
lake, heightened the charms of our journey through
this Elysian country.</P>
<P>THE situation of Lugano is delightful: it is built round
the gentle curve of a bay, and backed by a fine succession of
hills, rising in gentle swells to a considerable height: in
front, a bold mountain clothed with forest projects into the
lake, of which a noble branch extends to its right and left.
To that spot boats of every size are continually passing
and repassing, its base being perforated with <HI>cantine,</HI> or ca∣verns,
to which the inhabitants send their meat, and all
sorts of provision, where it is kept untainted for seven or
eight days, and the wine preserved with a delicious coolness.
Enjoying the advantages of a southern climate, it has few of
its inconveniences: the heats are moderated by the sur∣rounding
hills and the cool breezes from the lake. It is no
less sheltered from the Alpine blasts, which, chilled by the
neighbouring snows, would otherwise descend with vio∣lence,
<PB REF="437"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="423" REF="438"/>
and destroy the temperature of this equal climate.
Olive, almond, and all the southern fruits, ripen here to
perfection.</P>
<P>LUGANO is the emporium of the greatest part of the
merchandize which passes from Italy over the St. Gothard,
or the Bernardin. At the end of autumn, the Swiss moun∣taineers
bring down numerous herds of cattle for sale; and
return with less bulky commodities. The town contains
about 8000 inhabitants. Most of the houses are built of
tuf-stone: the residence of the <HI>capitano,</HI> or governor, is a
low building; on the walls are the arms of the twelve
regent cantons. On an eminence above the town, stands
the principal church, remarkable only for the beautiful
carving in stone round the doors, and rose window, and for
the delicious prospect from its terrace. In the cloisters of the
Recollets is a capital picture attributed to Luvino: their
church is handsome, and the skreen is ornamented with
the painting of the Passion by the same master. The palace
of the Marquis de Riva contains a few good pictures.</P>
<P>WE then embarked upon the lake of Lugano<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lake of Lugano is about 190 feet perpendicular higher than the lake of Como and Lago Maggiore. The two last-mentioned lakes are of the same level, and about 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 feet higher than the city of Milan. <HI>Veri sto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia di Milan,</HI> p. 5. <HI>Abb. Frist Dei Camali Navig. di Lombardia.</HI> 4to. p. 465.</NOTE>, which is
about twenty-five miles in length, and from two to four in
breadth; its form is irregular and bending into continued
sinuosities. The town forms a fine object, backed by the
<PB N="424" REF="439"/>
amphitheatre of hills; the banks on each side bordered with
a succession of gardens and villas. After being rowed to see
the noble branch pointing northward, we crossed to the
Cantine, and continued our voyage under the precipitous
rocks, whose bases are lost in the depths of the lake. We
landed at Porto, a small village in the duchy of Milan,
situated at its southern extremity. From this point, an arm
of the lake points northward, and discharges itself into the
Lago Maggiore, by means of the river Trisa. It is scarcely
possible to imagine a more perfect or greater variety of
beauties than this noble piece of water affords; the vast
over-hanging woods, the bold precipices, the transparency of
the water, unite to form a scenery in the highest degree
luxuriant. From Porto the traveller may observe, with sa∣tisfaction
mingled with compassion, the strong contrasts
effected by the influence of a free and of an arbitrary go∣vernment:
the borders of the lake subject to Switzerland
studded with a succession of villages, houses, and gardens;
this part of the Milanese desolate, and almost unpeopled.</P>
<P>ON leaving Porto, the hills begin to diminish, and in the
course of three miles are totally lost in the rich plain of
Lombardy. Varese is entirely composed of the seats of the
Milanese nobility. The principal palazzo is the residence
of the dutchess dowager of Modena; the gardens are laid
out in the old taste, the artificial mount commands a fine
view over a rich flat country, a small lake, and bounded by
the long chain of Alps. In the magnificent saloon are
some tolerable portraits of the families of Modena and
<PB N="425" REF="440"/>
Austria. The emperor, as duke of Milan, has exerted him∣self
in the suppression of convents; a rich Franciscan mona∣stery
has fallen a sacrifice to his plans of reformation.</P>
<P>THE road from hence to Laveno, a small burgh on the
Lago Maggiore, is varied, and the country very rich; to
the right, on an eminence, is San Sacramento; to the left
we passed near some lesser lakes. From Laveno we were
rowed across the delightful passage to Isola Bella, one of the
famous enchanted islands so particularly described, and with
such pleasure, by Bishop Burnet and Keysler; the latter can
compare it to nothing but “<HI>a pyramid of sweetmeats, orna∣mented
with green festoons and flowers.”</HI> But as the taste of
mankind alters with the succession of years, I therefore
considered it only as a monument of expence and folly:
terrace rises above terrace in regular gradations, bordered
with flower-pots, or gigantic statues of horses, gods, and
goddesses. The whole is raised upon arches; and the soil
has been brought from the shore to cover them. The
palace is magnificent, and contains a profusion of marbles
and paintings: the lower part of the house overhangs the
lake on one side; where several apartments are furnished
in the stile of grottos; the floors, pillars, and walls, are
inlaid with various-coloured stones, marbles, and shells;
the view and the coolness united make this part a delicious
summer retreat.</P>
<P>IF any thing justly gives this island the appellation of
enchanted, it is the prospect from the terrace. The gradual
diminution of the mountains from the regions of eternal
<PB N="426" REF="441"/>
snow to the rich plain, the sinuosity of the lake, its varied
banks, the bay of Marzozzo bounded by vast hills, the
neighbouring burgh of Palanza, and more distant view of
Laveno, the numerous villages, the Isola Madre, on which
is a palace of the Borromean family, and another island
sprinkled with fishermen's huts, form a delightful assem∣blage.
These islands, and the whole western coast of the
lake to the bailliage of Locarno, was ceded to the king of
Sardinia, by the late empress queen, at the treaty of Worms,
in consideration of the assistance which she had received
from that monarch.</P>
<P>WE re-entered our boat, troubled by the importunities
of the beggars, whose miserable huts adjoining to the palace
disgrace the island. Belgeritta is a neat village, containing
some excellent houses, and a handsome church. From
thence we continued our voyage down the lake. The tract
of country to our right, from near Palanza to ten miles
south of Arona, pays a small contribution to the Borromean
family for seignorial rights. That family receives a toll for
the merchandize which passes, grants the privilege of
fishing, and appoints eleven judges in the respective vil∣lages;
but an appeal lies from their decision to a superior,
nominated by the king of Sardinia, and resident at Palanza,
and again to Turin. The riches of this opulent house are
now increasing from the product of the gold mines, which
lie amongst the most inaccessible parts of the mountains,
thirty miles from Margozzo. Above Arona is a seminary
for forty boys, founded by San Carlo Borromeo; near it is
the colossal statue of that saint, sixty feet in height, placed
<PB N="427" REF="442"/>
on a pedestal of just proportions. He is represented in his
cardinal's habit; the right hand extended, a book under the
left arm. The statue is of bronze, was cast at Milan, and
brought in separate pieces. San Carlo, nephew to Pope
Pius the Fourth, was born near this spot; he passed with
early credit through his studies, and the dignities of the
church; was made a cardinal, and archbishop of Milan.
His charity and pious exertions, during the plague which
ravaged his diocese, the subject of so many fine pictures at
Milan, insure him more general renown than his canon∣ization
in 1610.</P>
<P>ARONA is a small town, with a neat port; above it rises a
ruined castle, which, in the earlier part of the Milanese his∣tory,
seems to have been considered as a place of the utmost
importance; at the period when the great contests arose
between the families of Visconti and Torriani, this castle was
the perpetual object of capture and reprisal. Otho Visconti,
the archbishop, who at length gained the ascendancy, was
twice repulsed and driven from hence. Two promontories
project into the lake at this spot; the eastern is crowned
with the castle of Anghiera, which gives name to this valua∣ble
province, which in 1397, to gratify Galeazzo, the second
duke of Milan, was erected into a county by the emperor
Wenceslaus, and has since been transferred to the king of
Sardinia. On doubling the promontory of Arona, the lake
again enlarges, and forms a bay; the banks are very low.
Soon after entering the Tesino we landed at the dirty village
of Sesto; hired another boat, and were hurried with great
rapidity down that river, between high banks of gravel, to
<PB N="428" REF="443"/>
the commencement of the <HI>Naviglio Grande,</HI> the great canal
which forms the junction between the Po and the Adda,
calculated not less for conveying merchandize and wood
to Milan, than for benefiting the neighbouring country
with partial inundations, and for the purpose of laying the
rice fields under water. Its breadth at first is great; but
narrows as we advance, and the stream becomes almost a
dead water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to the Abbé Frisi, the length of the Naviglio is 86, 000 braccia, or 14 Italian miles (60 to a degree); its breadth at the entrance 70, which gradually dimi∣nishes to 20; and the perpendicular height of the fall of water is 58; at first 5 brac∣cia per mile, gradually decreasing for the first twelve miles, until it is no more than one braccin is a mile; then increasing for the five next miles to a little more than five braccia in a mile.—See <HI>Canal. Navig. di Lomb. C.</HI> 1. A Milanese braccio is to an English foot nearly as 22 to 11, without con∣sidering a small fraction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF bad weather and other circumstances had not pre∣vented
me from extending my tour, I had purposed visiting
the bay of Margozzo, Domo, d'Oscella, Varallo, and the gold
mines in its neighbourhood; an excursion, which, from
the reports I have heard, could not fail of affording the
highest satisfaction to the naturalist, and the lover of nature
in her great features.</P>

<P>FAUNULA HELVETICA;
OR,
A CATALOGUE
OF THE
<HI>Quadrupeds, Birds, Amphibia, Fishes, and Testaceous Animals</HI>
OF
SWITZERLAND;
Arranged and denominated according to the System of LINNAEUS:
With References to PENNANT's British Zoology, BRISSON'S Works,
and other Authors.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="445"/>
IN no part of Europe does nature invite the naturalist with attractions
stronger than in Switzerland; a country so remarkably distinguished,
by sublime alps, stupendous glaciers, beautiful mountains, vallies,
and lakes, and affording a most comprehensive scope for variety, in
the vegetable world, in the mineral kingdom, and in animal life;
nor have the ingenious and learned of this nation neglected to avail
themselves of their peculiar situation. Let the genius of the
Gesners, the names of Haller, of Saussure, and many others, bear
testimony to this truth. Nevertheless, of these various branches of
knowledge, Zoology seems to have made less progress among this
ingenious people, than any other natural science, if compared with
its advancement in several other parts of Europe; since there is yet
no complete <HI>Fauna,</HI> or description of the animals of this country.
It is true, the writings of the indefatigable Conrad Gesner, contain
a great number of valuable observations on the animals of Switzer∣land;
but so diffused throughout his works, that they are of little
use to such as wish for a connected view of its animal productions.
Neither can the scanty and vague accounts of Wagner, gratify the
accuracy of the modern zoologist. The industry, however, and in∣genuity
of several naturalists, have been of late employed in accurate
investigations of the respective parts of Switzerland regarding the
animal kingdom; and their kindness has enabled me to lay before
the English naturalist the following <HI>Faunula Helvetica.</HI></P>
<P>THE reader is, however, originally indebted to Thomas Pen∣nant,
Es{que} for this catalogue. That ingenious naturalist, having
communicated to me a list of the Swiss birds drawn from Mr.
<PB N="431" REF="446"/>
Sprungli's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 58.</NOTE> much-admired cabinet, advised me to obtain from the
collector himself an account of such additional birds as he had pro∣cured
since 1776, the year in which Mr. Pennant visited Switzer∣land.
I accordingly applied to Mr. Sprungli, who obligingly gave
me an accurate catalogue of the Swiss birds and fishes, drawn up in
the Linnaean method, illustrated with observations and remarks.
On returning from my travels, Mr. Pennant, at my request, fa∣voured
me with the English names of the said birds, and with re∣ferences
to the British Zoology, Linnaeus, and Brisson, which are
preserved in the following catalogue. On a subsequent expedition
to Switzerland in 1786, I endeavoured to obtain a catalogue of the
quadrupeds and amphibia, for the purpose of forming a <HI>Faunula
Helvetica,</HI> a great desideratum in the natural history of Switzer∣land.</P>
<P>FROM the Rev. Mr. Wyttenbach<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Letter 59.</NOTE>, the same gentleman to
whom I was already indebted for a description of the Alps and hills
seen from Berne, I received a list of the quadrupeds and amphibia;
and from M. Van Berchem<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Letter 41.</NOTE>, of Lausanne, whom I have men∣tioned
in my account of the bouquetin, a catalogue of the fishes
found in the lake of Neuchatel, and of the amphibia, which agreed
with those communicated to me by Mr. Wyttenbach.</P>
<P>To the obliging communication of Mr. Studer, minister of the
great hospital at Berne, I owe the remaining part of this <HI>Faunula.</HI>
As no marine species of shells could enter into this list, it will be
an ample proof of the diligence and ingenuity of the collector,
that his cabinet actually contains all the land and fresh-water
shells here enumerated; among which are many totally unnoticed
by former writers. Mr. Studer, having collected all these species
<PB N="432" REF="447"/>
in the recent state, with a view to describe the animal, as well as its
covering, was hence led to arrange them, not by the system of
Linnaeus, which is adapted rather to the shell than to its inhabitant,
but by that of the late learned and indefatigable Mr. Muller, pub∣lished
under the following title, “<HI>Vermium terrestrium, et fluviati∣lium
seu Animalium infusoriorum, Helminthicorum, et Testaceorum,
non marinorum, succincta Historia. Auctore Oth. Frid.</HI> MUL∣LER.
Hauniae &amp; Lips. 1773. 4°.” The French names he has
taken from M. Geoffroy's work “on the Testaceous Animals of
the Environs of Paris;” the German, from the Berlin Magazine
conducted by Dr. Martini, and from the works of Mr. Schroeter.
To the new species he has himself given trivial names; and
proposes shortly to publish an ample description of his cabinet.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Faunula,</HI> in the order in which it now stands, was ar∣ranged
and digested by Dr. Pulteney, who collected the English
names, and references to Linnaeus, Pennant, and Brisson, in the ca∣talogues
of the quadrupeds and amphibia. He also subjoined to the
list of birds several references and illustrations, in addition to those
communicated by Mr. Pennant; and Mr. Sprungli, having reviewed
the birds and fish since these additions were made, has expressed his
entire approbation of them. I cannot conclude without gratefully
expressing my obligation to those gentlemen, who have thus en∣abled
me to give the first connected, though brief, account of
the Swiss Zoology.</P>

is found also in Corsica, Sardinia, and probably in Barbary, as well as
on mount Caucasus and in Dauria, or the south-eastern parts of Si∣beria.
It connects the Vultures with the Eagles. In the form of
the beak and of the body it resembles the Vulture, but differs from
that genus in having the head, like that of the Eagles, covered with
feathers. It is now so well defined, especially by M. Sprungli, that
it can no longer be mistaken<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 58.</NOTE>. The German peasants of Switzer∣land
name this bird, by way of eminence, the <HI>Lammer-geyer,</HI> and re∣late
incredible tales of its size and voraciousness: The peasants of the
French district frequently call it <HI>Le Vautour Jaune.</HI></P></ITEM>

<P>IUSED my utmost endeavours to render the General Map of Switzerland,
which accompanies this work, as complete as possible; and as there was no
accurate delineation of the whole country yet given to the public, I collected the
best maps of the various parts of Switzerland, which I was able to procure.
From these authorities, which are here enumerated, Messrs. Palmer and Baker
compiled the present engraving; and to their merit the public is indebted for
what, I hope, will be deemed the best general map of Switzerland yet extant.</P>

OF
Four Tours through Switzerland, in 1776, 1779, 1785, and 1786;
With the Distances marked in leagues and English miles.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be necessary to apprise the traveller, that although I spared no pains
in order to ascertain the respective distances, yet in many places, and parti∣cularly
in the mountainous districts, it was impossible to obtain that degree of
accuracy which I could have desired. For in those parts, the distances being
not measured, can only be conjectured from the time employed in tra∣versing
them.</P>
