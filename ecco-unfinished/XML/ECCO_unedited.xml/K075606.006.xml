<HEAD>THE WISH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM DUNCOMBE, ESQ <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Younger son of John Duncombe esq. of Stocks in Hert∣fordshire. In 1722 he published a translation of Racine's "Athaliah," which was well received by the publick, and has gone through three editions. In 1724 he was editor of the Works of Mr. Needler; in 1735 of the Poems of his de∣ceased brother-in-law Mr. Hughes, in two volumes, 12mo; in 1737 of the Miscellanies of his younger brother Mr. Jabez Hughes, for the benefit of his widow, in one volume, 8vo; and in 1745 of the Works of the Rev. Mr. Samuel Say, in one volume, 4to. In 1726 he married the only sister of John Hughes esq. whom he long survived. In 1734 his tragedy of "Lucius Junius Brutus" was acted at Drury Lane Theatre; see "Letters of Eminent Persons," vol. III. p. 144. It was published in 1735, and again in 1747. "The Works of Ho∣race, in English Verse, by several Hands," were published by him in two volumes 8vo. with notes, &amp;c. in 1757. A second edition, in four volumes 12mo. with many imitations, was published in 1762. In 1763 he collected and republished
<Q>“Seven Sermons by Archbishop Herring, on public Oc∣casions, with a biographical Preface.”</Q>
He died Feb. 26, 1769, aged 80; leaving one son, John, M. A. one of the six preachers in Christ-Church, Canterbury, &amp;c. who was his assistant in the translation of Horace; and to whom I ac∣knowledge myself indebted, not only for these poems and the portrait of his father, but for much useful assistance in this and other publications.

<L>And in their shady walks, and silent bowers,</L>

<L>Of Deity immense th' abyss profound,</L>
<L>Yet learn enough their Maker to adore,</L>
<L>His bounties bless, and humbly hope for more.</L>

<L>The ancient Sages' moral page peruse,</L>
<L>And sometimes listen to the chearful Muse:</L>
<L>Here Nature through her various windings chase,</L>
<L>And to the fountain-head with wonder trace:</L>
<L>Here trim my lamp, my faculties refine,</L>
<L>And deck my soul with every grace divine;</L>
<L>Till fit to join in heavenly hymns above,</L>
<L>By humble Virtue, and victorious Love,</L>
<L>This mouldering clay, contented, I might leave,</L>
<L>And at the last a fadeless crown receive!</L>

<L>Through the high arches, as in perspective,</L>

<L>A hanging wood; whose close-embowering trees</L>

<L>The hill commands a lovely vale, which yields</L>
<L>A various prospect to the wandering eye.</L>

<L>Content with what kind Providence bestows,</L>

<L>Close on the West a little garden lies,</L>

<L>A level green; from whence a theatre</L>
<L>Of hills we view: part crown'd with lofty woods,</L>
<L>Part cloath'd with turf, and spread with bleating flocks,</L>

<L>Cooes to his mate in melancholy strains:</L>
<L>Here darkling sings the wakeful nightingale,</L>
<L>The various wood-lark, and the tuneful thrush;</L>
<L>Music, to Reason's ear more charming far</L>

HENRY NEEDLER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the Navy-office, a young man of genius and science, piety and virtue; the grandson of Colonel Needler, a Roy∣alist, who served under General Monck, about the time of the Restoration. His faculties were impaired, and his death (which happened in 1718, when he was only twenty-eight years of age) accelerated, by his sedentary life, and intense application, principally to the mathematicks. A small vo∣lume of his works was collected and published by his friend Mr. Duncombe in 1724, of which there have been three editions.

<HEAD>TO THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would have been an acceptable present to the publick if I had been able to have prefixed to one of these volume a portrait of this amiable peer. I cannot, however, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> submit to my readers some curious particulars on the subject which have been kindly communicated by a gentleman whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> name I am not at liberty to disclose:
<Q>“Mr. Grange makes no mention of any print of Lord Roscommo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor can I find any account of a picture of him; but Dr. Chetwode's Ms. Life of him says, if I remember right, that the print prefixed to his Poems [I suppose he means some edition of his Poems in the latter end of the last or the beginning of the present century] was very like him; and that Lord Roscommon very strongly resembled the famous Lord Strafford. By the bye, all the Biographers seem to have been ignorant as to the degree of relationship between these two persons; and, what is very extraordinary, Dr. Chetwode himself does not appear to have known how nearly they were related. The fact is, that Lord Roscommon was Lord Strafford's <HI>nephew</HI>; his father, Sir James Dillon, the third earl of Roscommon, having married Elizabeth the youngest daughter of Sir William Wentworth, of Wentworth Woodhouse, in the county of York, sister to the Earl of Strafford. Hence Lord Roscommon was chris∣tened <HI>Wentworth</HI>; and probably was born in 1633, when Lord Strafford was in Ireland. His father died at Lime∣rick in 1649. The Poet, on the second of November, 1674, married, as his second wife, Isabella daughter of Matthew Boynton, esq. of Yorkshire. This, I believe, has not been mentioned. As to what the Biographers say of Lord Stras∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d's sending over for him, <HI>after the breaking out of the civil wars</HI>, and placing him near his country-seat in Yorkshire, it must be a mistake. If Lord Strafford sent for him at all, it must have been at some earlier period; for he himself was beheaded <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore</HI> the civil war can properly be said to have begun. Probably he brought his nephew with him from Ireland in 1640, on his return from his government. It is not, I believe, generally known that all the particulars of Lord Roscommon, related by Fenton, are taken from Chetwode's <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> of that nobleman, with which he pro∣bably was furnished by Mr. Thomas Baker, who left them, with many other Manuscripts, to the Library of St. John's College, Cambridge.

<BYLINE>BY GEORGE JEFFREYS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gentleman, who was educated at Westminster school under Dr. Busby, was the son of Christopher Jeffreys, es{que} of Weldron in Northamptonshire, and nephew to James the 8th lord Chandos. He was admitted of Trinity College, Cam∣bridge, in 1694, where he took the degrees in arts, was elected fellow in 1701, and presided in the philosophy-schools as mo∣derator in 1706. He was also sub-orator for Dr. Ayloffe, and not going into orders within eight years, as the statutes of that college require, he quitted his fellowship in 1709. Though Mr. Jeffreys was called to the bar, he never practised the law, but, after acting as secretary to Dr. Hartstonge bishop of Derry, at the latter end of queen Anne's and the beginning of George the First's reign, spent most of the remainder of his life in the families of the two last dukes of Chandos, his re∣lations. In 1754 he published, by subscription, a 4to volume of "Miscellanies, in Verse and Prose," among which are two tragedies, (viz. "Edwin" and "Merope," both acted at the theatre-royal in Lincoln's-Inn-fields) and "The Tri∣umph of Truth," an oratorio. "This collection (as the author observes in his dedication to the present duke of Chan∣dos, then marquess of Carnarvon,) includes an uncommon length of time, from the verses on the duke of Gloucester'i death in 1700 to those on his lordship's marriage in 1753." Mr. Jeffreys died in 1755, aged 77. See Letters of Emi∣nent Persons, vol. II. p. 17.—In Sir John Hawkins's "His∣tory of Music," vol. IV. p. 64. his grandfather, George, is recorded as King Charles the First's organist at Oxford, 1643, and servant to Lord Hatton in Northamptonshire, where he had lands of his own; and also his father, Christopher, of Weldron in Northamptonshire. p. 323, as "a student of Christ-Church, who played well on the organ."

<HEAD>TO MR. CONGREVE, ON HIS PLAYS AND POEMS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MRS. ELIZABETH TOLLET <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daughter of George Tollet, esq. who, as a commissioner of the navy, had a house in the Tower in the reigns of King William and Queen Anne. Sir Isaac Newton honoured both him and his daughter with his friendship, and was much pleased with some of her first essays. She has paid a grateful tribute to the memory of that great man in a copy of verses, [p. 69.] Her works (published after her death, which happened in 1754) abound with sentiment and simplicity (beauties rarely to be found in modern poems), and yet are far from being destitute of spirit and poetical ornament. Some of the poems indeed have such a philosophical cast, and so great a depth of thought, that they will scarcely be understood by the <HI>beau monde</HI>. The worthy author's head and heart con∣curred in promoting the cause of Good-manners, Virtue, and Religion. She would not suffer her poems to appear till she herself was beyond the reach of envy or applause. They are very incorrectly printed. The writer of this note has them corrected, with contents prefixed. She left her estate (a pretty good one) to her youngest nephew. Her eldest, George Tollet esq. of Betley Hall in Staffordshire, a gentleman of letters and fortune, well known by his curious illustrations of Shakspeare, died October 22, 1779. D.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>THE MICROCOSM <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This essay of mine was occasioned by an ingenious poem called "The Universe;" [by Mr. H.

I refer the whole of this argument to Psalm viii. where it is expressed with a significant and elegant brevity. On this subject I first in∣tended a larger introduction: but, as I design not controversy, but contrast, shall content myself with what I have pre∣mised.

<HEAD>HORACE, BOOK I. EP. VIII.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ISAAC HAWKINS BROWNE, ESQ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This very ingenious and elegant poet, born at Burton upon Trent, Jan. 21, 1705-6, was educated first at Litch∣field, and then at Westminster, where he soon became a peculiar favourite of Dr. Freind, the head master. After staying more than a year in the upper form, he was re∣moved, when little more than sixteen, to Trinity College, Cambridge, and continued at the University till he had taken the degree of M.A. Having been always intended for the bar, he settled in Lincoln's Inn about 1727, and prosecuted for seve∣ral years with great attention the study of the law, in which he obtained a great degree of professional knowledge; but his fortune enabled him to decline the pursuit of practice long before his death. His application to business both at Cam∣br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge and at Lincoln's Inn was occasionally diversified by the exercise of his poetical talents; of which an excellent collection was given to the publick by his son in 1768. Mr. Browne married Feb. 10, 1743-4, Jane daughter of Arch∣deacon Trimnell, by whom he had one son, the present Isa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hawkins Browne esq. He was twice elected into parliament f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wenlock in Shropshire, in 1744 and 1748; and died Feb. 14. 1760, in the fifty-fifth year of his age. A good account of him is given in the Biographia Britannica, 1780, vol. II. p. 647; where Dr. Kippis observes, that several of Mr. Browne's poems remain in manuscript, but that "many of them would do him no small honour, and afford strong proofs of the wit and humour which he so eminently possessed." Several of his poems are in Mr. Dodsley's Collection. N.</NOTE>. F. R. S. NOT PRINTED IN HIS WORKS.</BYLINE>

He was an excellent scholar, having been thoroughly grounded in the Classicks at Eton School, whence he was removed to King's College, Cambridge. He afterwards applied himself in Lincoln's Inn to the study of the law (his father and grandfather having been of the same profession). He spent the last 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> years of his life principally at Turrick; died on a vis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t at his friend Mr. Richardson's at Parson's Green, the 3d of Jan. 1757, aged 58; and was buried at Ellesborough in Buckinghamshire. His nephews (sister's sons) were h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heirs. He was equally distinguished for his genius and the goodness of his heart. His "Canons of Criticism" did him great credit, both as a critic and as a scholar, and of course provoked the vengeance of Dr. Warburton, which he wreak∣ed very illiberally in a note on the Dunciad (IV. 567); of which Mr. Edwards was more susceptible than he need have been, deeming his gentility impeached by the words "<HI>a Gentle∣man</HI>, as he is pleased to call himself, of Lincoln's Inn, but, in reality, a Gentleman only of the Dunciad," &amp;c. Thirteen of his Sonnets are printed in Dodsley's, eight in Pearch's, and four in this Collection. Twenty-seven others may be seen in the last edition of his "Canons of Criticism, 1765." He was also author of a pamphlet called "Free and candid Thoughts on the Doctrine of Predestina∣tion." See Dr. Akenside's and Mrs. Chapone's Odes to him. N.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<HEAD>VERSES BY MR. STILLINGFLEET<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grandson to the well-known bishop of Worcester, and equally distinguished as a naturalist and a poet. His father Edward was fellow of St. John's College in Cambridge, F. R. S. M. D. and Gresham Professor of Physic; but, mar∣rying in 1692, lost his lucrative offices, and the bishop's favour: a misfortune that affected both him and his posterity. However, going into orders, he obtained, by his father's means, the living of Newington-Butts, which he immediately exchanged for those of Wood-Norton and Swanton in Nor∣folk. He died in 1708. Benjamin, his only son, was edu∣cated at Norwich school, which he lest in 1720, with the character of an excellent scholar. He then went to Trinity College in Cambridge, at the request of Dr. Bentley, the master, who had been private tutor to his father, domestic <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haplain to his grandfather, and was much indebted to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amily. Here he was a candidate for a fellowship; but was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ejected by the master's influence. This was a severe and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nexpected disappointment; and but little alleviated after∣wards by the Doctor's apology, that it was a pity that a gen∣tleman of Mr. Stillingfleet's parts should be buried within the walls of a college. Perhaps, however, this ingratitude of Dr. Bentley was not of any real disservice to Mr. Stillingfleet. By being thrown into the world, he formed many honourable and valuable connections. The late Lord Barrington gave him, in a very polite manner, the place of master of the bar∣racks at Kensington; a favour to which Mr. Stilling∣fleet, in the dedication of his "Calendar of Flora" to that nobleman, alludes with great politeness, as well as the warmest gratitude. His "Calendar" was formed at Stratton in Norfolk, in 1755, at the hospitable seat of Mr. Marsham, who had made several observations of that kind, and had communicated to the publick his curious
<Q>“Obser∣”vations on the Growth of Trees.</Q>
But it was to Mr. Wyndham, of Felbrig in Norfolk, that he appears to have had the greatest obligations: he travelled abroad with him; spent much of his time at his house; and was appointed one of his executors; with a considerable addition to an annuity which that gentleman had settled upon him in his life-time, Mr. Stillingfleet's genius seems, if we may judge from his works, to have led him principally to the study of natural history, which he prosecuted as an ingenious philosopher, an useful citizen, and a good man. In this walk of learning he mentions, as his friends, Dr. Watson, Mr. (now Dr.) So∣lander, Mr. Hudson, Mr. Price of Foxley, and some others. Mr. Gray makes the following favourable mention of him, in one of his letters dated from London, in 1761; "I have lately made an acquaintance with this philosopher, who lives in a garret in the winter, that he may support some near re∣lations who depend upon him. He is always employed, con∣sequently (according to my old maxim) always happy, always chearful, and seems to me a worthy honest man. His present scheme is to send some persons, properly qualified, to reside a year or two in Attic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to make themselves acquainted with the climate, productions, and natural history of the country, that we may understand Aristotle, Theophrastus, &amp;c. who have been Heathen Greek to us for so many ages; and this he has got proposed to Lord Bute, no unlikely person to put it in execution, as he is himself a botanist." A beautiful elo∣gium on him, by Mr. Pennant, is prefixed to the fourth vo∣lume of the "British Zoology." An epistle by Mr. Stillingfleet, in 1723, is printed in the Poetical Magazine, 1764, p. 224. He published, about 1733, an anonymous pam∣phlet, intituled, "Some Thoughts concerning Happiness;" and in 1759 appeared a volume of "Miscellaneous Tracts," which is in much esteem, and does great honour both to his head and heart. They are chiefly translations of some essays in the "Amoenitates Academicae," published by Lin∣naeus, interspersed with some observations and additions of his own. In this volume he shews a taste for classical learn∣ing, and entertains us with some elegant poetical effusions. He annexed to it some valuable "Observations on Grasses," and dedicated the whole to George Lord Lyttelton. A second edi∣tion of it appeared in 1762; a third in 1775. Mr. Stillingsteet likewise published "Some Thoughts occasioned by the late Earthquakes, 1750," a poem in 4to. "Paradise Lost, an Oratorio, set to Music by Stanley, 1760," 4to. and "The Principles and Powers of Harmony, 1771," 4to. a very learned work, built on Tartini's <HI>Trattato di Musica secondo la verra Sci∣enza dell' Armonia</HI>. These, and his "Essay on Conversation," in the first volume of Dodsley's Collection of Poems, en∣title him to a distinguished rank among our English poets. The "Essay" is addressed to Mr. Wyndham with all that warmth of friendship which distinguishes Mr. Stillingfleet. As it is chiefly didactic, it does not admit of so many orna∣ments as some compositions of other kinds. However, it contains much good-sense, shews a considerable knowledge of mankind, and has several passages that, in point of harmony and easy versification, would not disgrace the writings of our most admired poets. Here more than once Mr. Stillingfleet shews himself still sore from Dr. Bentley's cruel treatment of him; and towards the beautiful and moral close of it (where he gives us a sketch of himself) seems to hint at a mortifi∣cation of a more delicate nature, which he is said to have suffered from the other sex. This too may perhaps account for the asperity with which he treats the ladies in the
<Q>“Ver∣ses”</Q>
here printed. To these disappointments it was perhaps owing that Mr. Stillingfleet neither married, nor went into orders. His London residence was at a sadler's in Pic∣cadilly, where he died in 1771, aged above seventy, leaving several valuable papers behind him. To these Mr. Pennant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lludes, when he says,
<Q>“I received the unfinished tokens of his regard by virtue of his promise; the only papers that were rescued from the flames to which his modesty had de∣voted all the rest.”</Q>
He was buried in St. James's church, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout the slightest monument of his having e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded. See <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Gentleman's Magazine, for 1776, p. 162, 496; for 1777, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 440; whence this note is principally taken.

THIRLBY <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Styan Thirlby, LL.D. son of Mr. Thirlby, vicar of St. Margaret's in Leicester; and born, it is supposed, about 1692. He published, when only B. A. of Jesus College, Cambridge, "An Answer to Mr. Whiston's Seventeen Suspicions concern∣ing Athanasius, in his Historical Preface, by Styan Thirlby, 1712" In 1723 he was editor of "Justin Martyr," the dedi∣cation to which has always been considered as a masterly pro∣duction, in style particularly. The late learned Dr. Jortin, who was one of his pupils, was very early in life recommended by him to translate some of Eustathius's notes for the use of Pope's Homer; (see a letter of Mr. Fenton's, in the Additions to Pope, vol. II. p. 106.). He left college many years before his death, and resided in London, first at Sir Edward Wal∣pole's, and afterwards in private lodgings. He was fond of the common law, and studied it; and, after he came to Lon∣don, had thoughts of being entered at one of the Inns of Court, and being called to the bar; but that scheme he after∣wards declined, and lived very retired, seeing only a few of his friends. Dr. Thirlby once had a design to publish Shak∣speare; and Dr. Jortin undertook to read over that poet, with a view to mark the passages where he had either imitated Greek or Latin writers, or at least had fallen into the same thoughts and expressions. Dr. Thirlby dropt the design; but left a Shakspeare, with many marginal notes and corrections, which is at present in the possession of Sir Edward Walpole, to whom he bequeathed all his books and papers. In the last edition of that matchless dramatist, Dr. Thirlby's name occurs early in the list of commentators. He was appointed a king's waiter in the port of London, in May 1741, a sinecure place worth about 100l. per annum, procured for him by Sir Edward Walpole. He died December 19, 1753.

<L>Marching o'er Edom's plain, the shrinking earth</L>
<L>Shiver'd with fear, the conscious Heavens alarm'd</L>

<HEAD>SONG, ON THE TWO MISS CRADDOCKS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE LATE SIR THOMAS BURNET <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Youngest son of the Bishop. He was author of "A se∣cond Tale of a Tub; or, the History of Robert Powe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Puppet-show-man;" (under which character Archbishop Sharp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was satir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.) He wrote also many political pamphlets against the last ministry of Queen Anne, for one of which he was taken into custody by a messenger. He was bred to the law; but wrote many other <HI>jeux d'esprit</HI> before he cultivated with success those severer studies. One of his sallies, when very young, was the following epigram, which was found in his father's episcopal throne in Sarum cathedral;
<Q><L>"A Bishop sits here,</L>
<L>Which may seem very odd,</L>
<L>Who has two thousand neat,</L>
<L>To drink and to eat,</L>
<L>And to give us the Peace of God."</L></Q>
He was the editor of his Father's "History of his own Times;" and, as an author, was concerned in a weekly paper called "The Grumbler;" but the publication, which induced Mr. Pope to expose him with severity in the Dun∣ciad, (III. 179.) was a travestie of the first book of the Iliad, intituled "Homerides, by Sir Iliad Doggrel," written in con∣junction with Mr. Ducket, and printed in 1715. It is recorded of Mr. Burnet, that, in the days of his levity, his father one day seeing him uncommonly grave, asked what he was meditating?
<Q>“A greater work, replied the son, than your Lordship's History of the Reformation.”</Q>
<Q>“What is that, Tom?”</Q>
"My own reformation, my Lord."
<Q>“I shall be heartily glad to see it, said the Bishop, but al∣most despair of it.”</Q>
It was, however, accomplished. Being consul at Lisbon when the late Lord Tyrawley was ambassa∣dor, upon some dispute between them, in which the merchants took part with the former, happening to employ the same taylor, he learned what suit, &amp;c. his Lordship had ordered for a birth-day, and arrayed his servants in the same, while he himself appeared dressed quite plain. This occasioned their both being recalled. Mr. Burnet then applied himself to the study of his profession, in which it is needless to say his advancement did not exceed his merit. He was appoint∣ed king's serjeant, 1740; a judge of the common pleas, 1741; knighted Nov. 23, 1745; and died Jan. 8, 1753. A thin vo∣lume of his poems was published in 1777, 4to.—The following has been related as an instance of his evenness of temper. Din∣ing at a friend's where the coachman was one of the atten∣dants, in lifting a dish he spilt it awkwardly on the Judge's cloaths, who only said facetiously, while he was rubbing down,
"Friend, I advise you for the future to grease nothing but your wheels.

<HEAD>CORNARO AND THE TURK. A TALE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. WHALEY.</BYLINE>
<L>WHERE, mid' Italia's ever sunny lands,</L>
<L>Fast by the streams of Po Ferrara stands,</L>
<L>At manhood's full increase now just arriv'd,</L>
<L>In splendid leisure young Cornaro liv'd;</L>
<L>Of a full bed the first and best belov'd,</L>
<L>Each gift kind Nature lent him Art improv'd.</L>
<L>He knew and lov'd his city; yet would know</L>
<L>What other cities different had to show;</L>
<L>Eager to gratify his stretching mind,</L>
<L>In one small realm too narrowly confin'd.</L>
<L>To tell his sire his wish, was to succeed;</L>
<L>The son but hinted, and the sire agreed.</L>
<L>Then, as became him, full supplied he went,</L>
<L>And to Livorno <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leghorn, a great and rich city and sea-port in Italy. W.</NOTE> first his way he bent;</L>
<L>On whose fair shore each distant nation meets,</L>
<L>And fills, with various tongues, her peopled streets.</L>
<L>Each object there his strict attention drew,</L>
<L>Much he observ'd, yet still found something new;</L>
<L>And sought it still, for, knowledge all his end,</L>
<L>Him, who could that advance, he thought his friend;</L>
<L>To rich and poor alike he cast his eye,</L>
<L>As 'twas a treasure they might both enjoy;</L>
<L>And he might teach him who the vessel steer'd,</L>
<L>What the rich freighter thought not worth regard.</L>
<L>Of graceful presence and inviting mien,</L>
<L>He in each place of full resort was seen,</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="179"/>On the throng'd quay, or in the busy hall,</L>
<L>And, skill'd in tongues, seem'd countryman to all;</L>
<L>To observation deep reflection join'd,</L>
<L>And fix'd the gather'd honey in his mind.</L>
<L>His lodging on a large quadrangle's side,</L>
<L>To him still thinking, farther thought supplied;</L>
<L>And as each hour of passing day went by,</L>
<L>Some scene worth note still met his curious eye.</L>
<L>Yet one among the rest he long had weigh'd,</L>
<L>And oftenest seen the stronger mark it made;</L>
<L>For the sad sigh that keen Misfortune drew</L>
<L>Still to his breast an easy passage knew.</L>
<L>As he each morn the rising sun beheld,</L>
<L>Ere yet the moving square with crowds was fill'd,</L>
<L>On one same spot as still he look'd around,</L>
<L>One solitary wretch he always found;</L>
<L>A porter's garb declar'd his present yoke,</L>
<L>But his whole mien a birth far different spoke.</L>
<L>In his swoln breast sighs, spite of shame, would rise,</L>
<L>And tears, kept back, flow'd faster from his eyes,</L>
<L>Which with the knotted rope he wip'd away,</L>
<L>Sad ensign of his fortune's deep decay!</L>
<L>The youth, who pitying saw the frequent grief,</L>
<L>Thought Pity blameful carrying no relief;</L>
<L>So, generously curious, sought to know,</L>
<L>In hopes to ease the cause of so much woe;</L>
<L>And call'd him from his melancholy stand:</L>
<L>He came, and silent waited his command;</L>
<L>Thinking some errand would a mite assord,</L>
<L>Just to support a being he abhorr'd,</L>
<L><PB N="175" REF="180"/>Which yet he durst not of himself destroy,</L>
<L>Since Heaven might change the grief it sent to joy.</L>
<L>But other business fill'd Cornaro's breast,</L>
<L>And his kind suit in tenderest terms he prest,</L>
<L>Wish'd that his cause of grief he would impart</L>
<L>To one who lov'd to sooth an aching heart,</L>
<L>And always thought, however low his sphere,</L>
<L>A man who felt affliction worth his care;</L>
<L>Yet here believ'd the stroke of fickle Fate</L>
<L>Was fall'n on one had known a happier state.</L>
<L>"Then speak, he said, nor let false shame conceal</L>
<L>Whate'er with truth a sufferer may reveal;</L>
<L>And, if my happier lot may ease thy woes,</L>
<L>Whate'er a stranger's ear may learn, disclose."</L>
<L>The listening wretch each word with wonder heard,</L>
<L>Perceiv'd them Virtue's dictates, and was cheer'd,</L>
<L>Ventur'd to throw his slavish badge aside,</L>
<L>And thus with manly confidence replied:</L>
<L>"I was not always what I now appear;</L>
<L>But truths, thy nobleness has challeng'd, hear:</L>
<L>First, I 'm a Mussulman, yet here confin'd</L>
<L>Must wish thee, as thy milder doctrines, kind.</L>
<L>Oh! love thy faith, yet hate not me for mine,</L>
<L>Which had, hadst thou been born a Turk, been thine:</L>
<L>Next know, ere fall'n to this most abject state,</L>
<L>Smyrna once saw me happy, though not great;</L>
<L>By merchandize with sumptuous affluence blest,</L>
<L>And sweet content, which great ones seldom taste.</L>
<L>But oh! to have been blest, brings no relief,</L>
<L>But adds a stronger bitterness to grief;</L>
<L><PB N="176" REF="181"/>Forgive my tears, that utter, as they flow,</L>
<L>A son's, a father's, and a husband's woe:</L>
<L>To swell each sigh these various sorrows join,</L>
<L>For all those dear relations once were mine.</L>
<L>Nor was it hope of adding to my store</L>
<L>By lawless plunder sent me from my shore,</L>
<L>To gain in bleeding fields a cruel name,</L>
<L>Or wish on slaughter'd heaps to build my fame.</L>
<L>'Twas duty bid me watch the favouring gale,</L>
<L>And filial love that hoisted every sail.</L>
<L>'Twas to a father's fond embrace I went,</L>
<L>Ere yet his lamp of life was wholly spent;</L>
<L>While still a kneeling son might please his eye,</L>
<L>And swell his aged heart with tender joy.</L>
<L>For Cyprus then I sail'd — what since befell</L>
<L>Let these hard chains and this vile habit tell;</L>
<L>Which with for-ever growing grief I bear,</L>
<L>And now the fourth sad winter sees me wear;</L>
<L>And years may roll on years, unstopp'd my grief,</L>
<L>Till welcome Death shall bring his last relief,</L>
<L>In whose cold arms, by some dire chance betray'd,</L>
<L>My friends may long ere this believe me laid.</L>
<L>My fond old sire perhaps, my fate unknown,</L>
<L>Wailing my ravish'd life, consum'd his own;</L>
<L>And oh! what pangs my orphan children feel!</L>
<L>Hast thou a tender parent, thou canst tell."</L>
<L>He stopp'd—tears drown'd his accents, and the rest</L>
<L>A silence far beyond all words express'd.</L>
<L>Nor spoke Cornaro more—he too was mute,</L>
<L>Nor language found his fellow grief to suit;</L>
<L><PB N="177" REF="182"/>But struggling with a tear-attended sigh,</L>
<L>Just mutter'd out — "Friend, take this small supply,</L>
<L>'Twill give thee some relief—were Freedom mine</L>
<L>And Happiness to give, they both were thine.</L>
<L>He took the gold, and bow'd, and slow return'd,</L>
<L>And, as was wont, in hopeless sadness mourn'd.</L>
<L>Cornaro see, in other guise appear!</L>
<L>Sudden he stopp'd the commendable tear,</L>
<L>"And be, he said, my soul, thy joy express'd,</L>
<L>"'Tis in thy power to make the wretched bless'd.</L>
<L>"Now I am bless'd indeed, since on my wealth</L>
<L>"Depends another's being, freedom, health.</L>
<L>"'Tis I can bid the sun of mercy shine;</L>
<L>"This man's peace, life, and liberty, are mine.</L>

<L>"His country, children, wives, are mine to give;</L>
<L>"Now India's Lord, amidst his hoarded store,</L>
<L>"And endless mines, compar'd with me is poor.</L>
<L>"Quick then, Cornaro, to his ransom flee,</L>
<L>"And let this morning's sun behold him free.</L>
<L>Strait to the lordly governor's he went,</L>
<L>His name, his rank, his cause of coming sent;</L>
<L>Nor need he long to wait, his errand told,</L>
<L>Bringing, that ne'er-refus'd credential, Gold.</L>
<L>The price requir'd for liberty he gave,</L>
<L>And quick return'd to find the now but fancied slave,</L>
<L>And said, — "Be free:" his transports who can tell?</L>
<L>Prostrate before him in wild joy he fell,</L>
<L>Which only his who caus'd it could excel.</L>
<L><PB N="178" REF="183"/>Gladness and wonder in his bosom wrought,</L>
<L>With labouring gratitude his soul was fraught,</L>
<L>Nor had he power to utter half he thought.</L>
<L>"Yet, oh! my great deliverer, he cried,</L>
<L>Can such amazing worth in man reside?</L>
<L>Or can it be that Christian doctrines teach</L>
<L>Virtues beyond our sacred Prophet's reach?</L>
<L>But oh! whate'er the wondrous cause, receive</L>
<L>As much of gratitude as words can give;</L>
<L>Nor let these bursting tears its force destroy,</L>
<L>Slaves late of Grief, soft offspring now of Joy.</L>
<L>And how my deeds shall with my words agree,</L>
<L>Let me once reach my country, thou shalt see,</L>
<L>And find thy mighty bounty is not lost:</L>
<L>I scorn to ask thee what my freedom cost,</L>
<L>That to my gratitude has no regard,</L>
<L>Up to thy worth I 'll measure the reward.</L>
<L>Yet can that be?" — "Stop there, Cornaro said,</L>
<L>If thou art happy, I am more than paid.</L>
<L>But that thy happiness meet no delay,</L>
<L>There 's gold wherewith to speed thee on thy way.</L>
<L>If grateful thou would'st be, at thy return,</L>
<L>Amid the crowds that there in bondage mourn,</L>
<L>Search out some Christian from the wretched band,</L>
<L>Who best shall merit freedom at thy hand;</L>
<L>Then think 'tis in thy power to pay my debt,</L>
<L>By shewing him the mercy thou hast met."</L>
<L>He said, and to his lodging back return'd,</L>
<L>(Honour's bright lamp within him gently burn'd)</L>
<L>Felt and enjoy'd the riot of his breast,</L>
<L>While Conscience furnish'd out the noble feast.</L>
<L><PB N="179" REF="184"/>As free as air from prison just broke out,</L>
<L>The Turk with rapid speed the harbour sought;</L>

<L>Smyrna her port; with prosperous winds she flies,</L>
<L>And gives him to his home and former joys.</L>
<L>Livorno now, as his Ferrara, known,</L>
<L>Her trade, her arts, her pleasures all his own,</L>

<L>For a soul's banquet far he need not fly,</L>
<L>Venice, old Ocean's fairest child, so nigh;</L>
<L>O'er the proud Adriatick where she stood,</L>
<L>Which swells unenvious of the Tuscan flood,</L>
<L>Though Naples, Florence, on his banks he names,</L>
<L>And to him Tiber pours from Rome his streams.</L>
<L>When o'er the continent fell Slavery flew,</L>
<L>Hither the goddess Liberty withdrew;</L>
<L>Here plac'd her cap, her staff, her armour here,</L>
<L>And, as her own fierce Sparta, held it dear.</L>
<L>Each art and science this their dwelling own,</L>
<L>As guardians to their goddess Freedom's throne;</L>
<L>And as her hand-maid busy Commerce toils,</L>
<L>Her sister-goddess Plenty cheerful smiles.</L>

<L>Whate'er might please a knowledge-loving mind,</L>
<L>Or where the columns rose with beauteous wreath,</L>
<L>Or sculpture seem'd to speak, or paint to breathe;</L>
<L>And though each day increas'd his curious store,</L>
<L>Thought his capacious soul had room for more;</L>
<L>And little deem'd the moment was so nigh.</L>
<L>When all these pleasures of his breast should die,</L>
<L><PB N="180" REF="185"/>The beams of science from his soul retire</L>
<L>And fade, extinguish'd by a nobler fire;</L>
<L>As kindled wood, howe'er its flames may rise,</L>

<L>Minerva sudden from his soul was fled,</L>

<L>A thousand fair-ones, of her frolic train,</L>

<L>Launch'd from the wanton eye they sought his heart,</L>

<L>Nor all their force nor poison need he fear,</L>
<L>Virtue must tip the point that enter'd there;</L>
<L>As diamonds scorn the power of keenest steel,</L>
<L>And touch'd alone by fellow-gems can feel.</L>
<L>One glance at last an easy passage found,</L>

<L>Ev'n this the lovers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore, each other near,</L>

<L>'Twas there his gold must have its wanton vent.</L>
<L>How should Delphina 'scape his prying sight?</L>
<L>Too fatally, in spite of anguish, bright!</L>
<L>Her breast took beauty from the heaving sigh,</L>
<L>Nor could the tear, that drown'd, eclipse her eye,</L>

<L>He sunk beneath his sorrow's wondrous load,</L>

<L>Full on his face he fix'd his stedfast eye,</L>

<L>His nerves all trembling with the glad surprise,</L>
<L>To heaven he stretch'd his hands, and rais'd his eyes,</L>
<L>And then—"I thank thee, Mahomet, he said,</L>
<L>Hither by thy divine direction led."</L>
<L>Sounds struck Cornaro's ear he ought to know,</L>
<L>And wak'd him from his dismal trance of woe;</L>
<L>He saw the Turk prepar'd for his embrace,</L>
<L>Mark'd the glad transport sparkling in his face,</L>
<L><PB N="184" REF="189"/>Saw 'twas the very slave he once set free,</L>
<L>And cry'd aloud—"Great God of Hosts, 'tis he!"</L>
<L>Then folded in each others arms they stood,</L>

<L>The Turk at length recovering, rear'd his head—</L>
<L>"And now he cry'd, my mighty debt be paid;</L>
<L>Which, wert not thou the slave I here survey,</L>
<L>Peruvian mines were much too poor to pay."</L>
<L>To the man-merchant then he stretch'd his hand,</L>
<L>"And take, he said, whate'er thy wants demand;</L>
<L>Quick set my friend, and his companions, free,</L>
<L>Name you the price, unbartering I agree."</L>
<L>The ransom'd home he led in bounteous state,</L>
<L>His swelling soul with godlike joy elate,</L>
<L>Joy such as fill'd the great Creator's breast,</L>

<L>Amidst them all he then Cornaro led,</L>

<L>"Ye of my licens'd bed the partners fair,</L>
<L>Who my divided love yet equal share;</L>
<L>With whom so many pleasing moons I've spent,</L>

<L>If, in my absence, ye not falsely mourn'd,</L>

<L>Now more adore them, prostrate praise their power,</L>
<L>Admire their bounties still increasing shower;</L>
<L>But now from chains I free'd this captive's hands,</L>
<L>And here—Cornaro, my deliverer, stands."</L>
<L>All prostrate at that sacred name they fell,</L>
<L>How touch'd, great Gratitude alone can tell;</L>
<L>Great Gratitude, that dictated their joy,</L>
<L>Smil'd on each cheek, and spoke from every eye.</L>
<L>The Turk with rapture saw the pleasing scene,</L>
<L>The home-felt joy ran warm through every vein.</L>
<L>Their gratitude his inmost soul approv'd,</L>
<L>That loudly told how much himself was lov'd.</L>
<L>"Come then, he said, the sumptuous feast prepare,</L>

<L>How faintly will it his soul's worth express!</L>
<L>Come then, my friend: but why that downcast eye,</L>
<L>That cheek yet pale, and that still heaving sigh!</L>
<L><PB N="186" REF="191"/>Freedom thou hast, and what else wealth can give,</L>
<L>Is my blest task—yours only to receive."</L>
<L>Cornaro blush'd, and sigh'd, and would have spoke,</L>
<L>But, as he strove, grief still his accents broke.</L>
<L>The uncle saw, yet silent, his distress,</L>
<L>And what he could not, ventur'd to express;</L>
<L>Told the whole tale of love—the fair pourtray'd,</L>

<L>Ere that perhaps some Turk's abandon'd prey,</L>
<L>Torn from Cornaro's arms for e'er away;</L>
<L>Cornaro doom'd no farther joy to prove,</L>
<L>But Life's and Freedom's slave bereft of Love.</L>
<L>The Turk with anguish heard the fatal tale,</L>
<L>Fearing his utmost bounty here must fail;</L>
<L>Fearing he never could the maid restore,</L>
<L>Already slave to some lewd tyrant's power;</L>
<L>Immers'd already in some cruel grove,</L>
<L>Where brutal Lust usurps the name of Love;</L>
<L>Some close seraglio's gloom, from whose sad bourn</L>
<L>No maid did e'er inviolate return.</L>
<L>But as this thought perplex'd his working brain,</L>
<L>And every hope that rose he still found vain;</L>
<L>His son all sudden smil'd, and rear'd his head</L>
<L>(The eldest blessing of his fruitful bed),</L>
<L>Then bow'd again, and smote his breast, and said:</L>
<L>"Thee first, Creator Alha, I adore,</L>
<L>Untrac'd, mysterious, wonder-working power!</L>
<L>How could thy lowest servant's untry'd noon</L>
<L>Of useless life deserve so vast a boon?</L>
<L>Be hush'd, all grief, and open'd every ear,</L>
<L>My words with rapture let Cornaro hear;</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="192"/>Let too my sire his genuine offspring own,</L>
<L>While I nor vainly boast I am his son.</L>
<L>My heart how moulded, let my actions prove,</L>
<L>And rise victorious Gratitude o'er Love.</L>
<L>If my exulting soul aright divine,</L>
<L>To make Cornaro bless'd is only mine.</L>
<L>For know these walls contain the pictur'd fair,</L>
<L>Chaste yet as snow, and pure as spring-tide air."</L>
<L>Then, go ye slaves, he said, and quick return</L>
<L>With the fair Christian whom I bought this morn.</L>
<L>Return'd — Delphina bless'd their eager eyes,</L>
<L>And on each breast shed wild ecstatic joys,</L>
<L>Bright as the sun, with stronger light array'd,</L>
<L>When rescued from the moon's eclipsing shade.</L>
<L>Then thus again the Turk, with gracious air,</L>
<L>(As to her lord he led the blushing fair):</L>
<L>"My friend, in this blest moment be it mine,</L>
<L>Taught by thyself, to show a soul like thine;</L>
<L>Forgive a vaunt, 'tis Virtue sends it forth,</L>
<L>A soul that strives with ev'n Cornaro's worth.</L>
<L>In thy gay paradise, great Prophet, hear,</L>
<L>By Mecca's ever sacred shrine I swear;</L>
<L>Were all the treasures now before my sight,</L>
<L>That fill'd Damascus' glittering plains with light,</L>
<L>When in fierce triumph furious Caled rode,</L>
<L>And drench'd the Syrian soil with Grecian blood,</L>
<L>Would some great Sultan say, 'That maid resign,</L>
<L>And the whole wealth of all the East is thine!'</L>
<L>From him unhesitating would I turn,</L>
<L>And look upon his trifling bribe with scorn.</L>
<L><PB N="188" REF="193"/>Beauty like this, which wondering we survey,</L>
<L>'Tis Virtue only in exchange can pay.</L>
<L>'Tis thee, great goddess Virtue, I pursue,</L>

<L>Thus kneeling thy almighty power I own,</L>
<L>And sacrifice my passions at thy throne;</L>
<L>To thy Cornaro, lo! this hand restores</L>
<L>What most, thyself except, his soul adores."</L>
<L>So saving, with a smile their hands he join'd,</L>
<L>And his rich prize without a sigh resign'd.</L>
<L>Virtue was pleas'd, and own'd in Heaven above,</L>
<L>How deeds like these ev'n gods with pleasure move;</L>
<L>Gentle Compassion shed a tear of joy,</L>
<L>And Gratitude loud shouted through the sky.</L>
<L>What joy the lovers ravish'd souls possess'd,</L>

<P>Theseus, the valiant son of Aegeus king of Athens, for a long while knew not his father; till travelling into At∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea, he by great fortune there discovered him. But soon after, out of a principle of honour, he left the Athenian court to go to Crete, on a dangerous expedition. Minos was king of that place, whose daughter Ariadne at first sight fell unhappily in love with the beautiful stranger; and assisted him in killing the Minotaur, a monster that was inclosed in the middle of a large labyrinth. It seems she presented him with a cloe of thread, by which, after the conquest of the beast, he guided his steps back through the many windings of the grove. After this signal ser∣vice, he promised to carry her with him to Athens; but in his passage home left her on a desert island called Dia. She prays all the Gods to avenge her; which they do, by making Theseus, when he comes within sight of Attica, forget to give the appointed signal of success at a distance, by which means Aegeus, thinking his son dead, threw him∣self into the sea, and perished. Ariadne was afterwards carried into Heaven by Bacchus, and made a constellation.</P>

<L>Such trivial cares, alas! no room can find,</L>

<L>CAELIA, a rural nymph, but wondrous fair,</L>
<L>Each shepherd's wish, and Venus' chiefest care,</L>
<L>For scornful Fopling felt a lover's flame;</L>
<L>But what she felt, her sex forbad to name.</L>
<L>If fondness (much as modest nymphs may show)</L>
<L>Could win to tender love a scornful beau;</L>
<L>If eyes have language (and I 've heard in love</L>
<L>The fair-one's eyes have eloquence to move);</L>
<L>Ten thousand times fair Caelia spoke her pain,</L>
<L>Ten thousand times the fair-one spoke in vain.</L>
<L>But, ah! how hard a scornful beau to move,</L>
<L>When courted by the fair to tender love!</L>
<L>Fopling with pride her captive beauty view'd,</L>
<L>Beauty which none but Fopling e'er withstood.</L>
<L><PB N="249" REF="254"/>Full well he knew the ardent maid's intent,</L>
<L>And what those eyes, and what that fondness meant;</L>
<L>Yet could that fondness and those eyes behold,</L>
<L>Yet be perversely dull, unmov'd, and cold:</L>
<L>Till thus the nymph, with indignation fir'd,</L>
<L>Nor more by rage than slighted love inspir'd,</L>
<L>In angry tone rebuk'd the heedless beau,</L>
<L>Who such contempt for such a nymph could show:</L>
<L>"And is it thus you treat a tender maid,</L>
<L>Is thus my fondness, thus my love repaid?</L>
<L>Obdurate man! I was not wont to sue,</L>
<L>Nor ever knelt to any swain but you.</L>
<L>No; at my feet would prostrate Damon lie,</L>
<L>And on his Caelia gaze with wishful eye;</L>
<L>At Caelia's feet has suppliant Thyrsis bow'd;</L>
<L>And gay Damaetas, 'midst the rival crowd,</L>
<L>Ador'd fair Caelia as a power divine,</L>
<L>An altar rais'd, and call'd it Caelia's shrine.</L>
<L>Thus reign'd I long the mistress of the plain,</L>
<L>Envy'd by nymphs, and lov'd by every swain;</L>
<L>Till, most ungrateful, but resistless man!</L>
<L>From seeing thee, my harder fate began.</L>
<L>And canst thou still refuse my proffer'd love?</L>
<L>And has poor Caelia lost her art to move?"</L>
<L>Thus spoke the nymph; and thus, with usual pride</L>
<L>And usual sense, the scornful beau reply'd:</L>
<L>"What babbling's this!—impertinence of chat!</L>
<L>Of love, shrines, shepherds, nymphs, and Gad knows what!</L>
<L>Pr'ythee, fond girl, give o'er this odious tale,</L>
<L>Nor think thy rustic charms can e'er prevail.</L>
<L><PB N="250" REF="255"/>What fancies to the mind can pride impart?</L>
<L>And canst thou hope to win Sir Fopling's heart?</L>
<L>No; let thy Strephons and thy Damons die;</L>
<L>Thou may'st be wondrous fair in Thyrsis' eye,</L>
<L>But, for a beau to love!—In faith, not I."</L>
<L>He said; and rapt his box with scornful air,</L>
<L>Turn'd lightly on his heel, and left the fair;</L>
<L>Who thus in tears invok'd the Powers above,</L>
<L>But most besought the gentle Queen of Love.</L>
<L>"Venus! if e'er you view'd an injur'd maid,</L>
<L>If pity e'er your tender breast essay'd,</L>
<L>At length attend to injur'd Caelia's prayer,</L>
<L>By instant death remove this anxious care,</L>
<L>Or punish him who caus'd my sad despair.</L>
<L>Destroy that form, ye Gods, whence sprung my grief,</L>
<L>And let revenge supply sincere relief!"</L>
<L>Thus ardent pray'd the nymph, nor pray'd in vain;</L>
<L>The Powers of Heaven consent. The Paphian queen</L>
<L>Swift to her aid descended in a cloud,</L>
<L>Which might from mortal ken the goddess shroud;</L>
<L>A powerful phial in each hand she bore,</L>
<L>Charg'd with black poison from Cocytus' shore.</L>
<L>Just then Sir Fopling at his mirror stood,</L>
<L>And thus bespoke the image that he view'd:</L>
<L>"Sure from those eyes no mortal nymph can fly,</L>
<L>The luckless fair that views them once must die.</L>
<L>Those lips, that shape, that mien, must surely move,</L>
<L>(If e'er Adonis did) the Queen of Love."</L>
<L>Venus o'erheard his boast: "And, for thy pride,</L>
<L>This instant lose that boasted form," she cry'd;</L>
<L><PB N="251" REF="256"/>"Hence (if a goddess may aright presage)</L>
<L>Pent in the narrow confines of a cage,</L>
<L>Thou, by whose pride so many nymphs despair,</L>
<L>Shalt live the toy, the pastime of the fair."</L>
<L>Quick o'er his limbs the powerful juice she threw,</L>
<L>As quick the sudden transformation grew.</L>
<L>At first how startled was the beau, to see</L>
<L>In various colours glow his smart toupee!</L>
<L>Fast to his head it grew; and, as he strove</L>
<L>With eager arms the wonder to remove,</L>
<L>To pinions chang'd his arms (for chang'd they were)</L>
<L>Bore the unthinking Fopling into air.</L>
<L>In talons lost, his feet forsake the ground,</L>
<L>His oval face, by sudden change, grew round.</L>
<L>Just in the midst, a horny beak took place,</L>
<L>And stood the crooked gnomon of his face:</L>
<L>Quick to a tail his length of ribbons grew,</L>
<L>But in the tail retain'd their various hue.</L>
<L>O'er every point the metamorphose ran,</L>
<L>And in a tawdry parrot hid the man.</L>
<L>Thus much could Venus to the outward frame;</L>
<L>His passions and his mind are still the same:</L>
<L>Still he delights in emptiness of show,</L>
<L>And chatters still by rote—like any beau.</L>

<BYLINE>BY SIR WILLIAM YONGE <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir William Yonge was representative for Honiton, in the first parliament called by King George I. and constantly served in the house of commons till his death. On the second of July 1717, he was appointed one of the commissioners for taking, examining, and stating the debts due to the army. On the second of April 1724, he was constituted one of the lords commissioners of the treasury, in which commission he continued till the accession of his late Majesty; and was elected one of the knights-companions of the Bath, on the revival of that most honourable order, in 1725. On the first of June 1728, he was made one of the commissioners of the admiralty, wherein he continued till May 11, 1730, when he was again made one of the commissioners of the treasury: and in 1735 was constituted secretary at war, and sworn of his Majesty's most honourable privy-council. In July 1739, he was appointed custos rotulorum of the county of Car∣narvon; in May 1746, one of the joint vice-treasurers of Ireland; and the same year was one of the committee of the house of commons for managing the impeachment against Lord Lovat; in 1747, he was elected to parliament for Bodmin and Tiverton, but took his seat for the latter. He was also ranger of Hampton Court. He first married Mary, daughter of Samuel Heathcote, of Hackney in the county of Mid∣dlesex, Esq. from whom he was divorced, without issue by her, 1724, and enabled, by act of parliament, to marry again. On Sept. 14, 1729, he married, secondly, Anne, daughter and coheir of Thomas Lord Howard of Essingham, by whom he had issue four sons and six daughters. He died August 10, 1755, and was succeeded in title and estate by his son, Sir George Yonge, the present baronet. He assisted Roome in writing a ballad opera, called "The Jovial Crew," acted at Drury Lane in 1731; and in his political character, if he did not possess the first-rate abilities, he was considered as an useful man by Sir Robert Walpole, with whom he was strictly united. The late Lord Chesterfield, who seems to have had some prejudice against him, represents him in a very unfavourable light. In the 273d letter to his son, he says,
<Q>“Sir William Yonge, with not a quarter of your parts, and not a thousandth part of your knowledge, has, by a glibness of tongue singly, raised himself successively to the best employments of the kingdom: he has been lord of the admiralty, lord of the treasury, secretary at war. and is now vice-treasurer of Ireland; and all this, with a most sullied, not to say blasted character.”</Q>
A song by Sir William is in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for 1736, p. 103; but the subject renders it improper to be inserted here. Those by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Sir William Yonge, in the sixth volume of Mr. Dodsley's Col∣lection, are well known. N.</NOTE>, BART. K.B. LL.D. F.R.S.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO A FRIEND, TRANSLATED FROM THE LATIN, BEING THE CHARACTER OF A TOWN LIFE. FROM FENTON'S COLLECTION.</HEAD>
<L>AT last the grateful Muse presumes to send</L>
<L>A present to her patron and her friend:</L>
<L>And, that the present might be sure to please,</L>
<L>She sends it cloath'd in a poetic dress:</L>
<L>Satire inspires, and she attempts to soar,</L>
<L>As dauntless as old Dryden did before,</L>
<L>For who can sit to see a modern scene,</L>
<L>Or if he sits, not almost burst with spleen?</L>
<L>How can he bear the novices of rhyme,</L>
<L>Who murther sense in vile ungodly chime,</L>
<L>That once has tasted what the ancients wrote,</L>
<L>How vast their genius, how sublime their thought,</L>
<L>Where perfect beauty charms in every line,</L>
<L>Where every single letter sounds divine?</L>
<L>Tell me, if when you read great Dryden o'er,</L>
<L>Or search the riches of Roscommon's store,</L>
<L>Do you not feel such transport in your mind,</L>
<L>As if all human cares were cast behind?</L>
<L>Have not those charms on your disease prevail'd,</L>
<L>When all their alkils and their acids fail'd?</L>
<L>O that like them I could presume to fly,</L>
<L>Full of their tuneful, godlike energy!</L>
<L><PB N="267" REF="272"/>That I like them might with my verses heal!</L>
<L>Who but repeat them, and the patient 's well.</L>
<L>But, oh! my sluggish blood that task denies,</L>
<L>And backward to my heart confus'dly flies:</L>
<L>The sickly Muse no longer dares to soar,</L>
<L>Since spiteful Phoebus has refus'd the power.</L>
<L>But, lest by this I wholly seem to want</L>
<L>Sense to pursue what I 'm oblig'd to grant,</L>
<L>I send you this, in hopes that you 'll approve</L>
<L>What comes not from my wit, but from my love.</L>
<L>You ask to know, since you have left the town,</L>
<L>What course I take to drive my minutes on.</L>
<L>At six I rise, and studiously withdraw</L>
<L>T' explore some quirks and quibbles of the law.</L>
<L>Till twelve (no very pleasing task you 'll say)</L>
<L>I turn o'er Coke and Hobart for a plea,</L>
<L>With many more as pert and dull as they:</L>
<L>Names which were never known to Muse before,</L>
<L>But yet, by learning such a thriving lore,</L>
<L>I may at last some wealthy honour get,</L>
<L>As a reward for all my toil and sweat:</L>
<L>Whilst poets, as the vermin best deserve,</L>
<L>Must be content to be admir'd and starve.</L>
<L>At twelve I lay aside my books, and dine,</L>
<L>And, if my pockets liberally incline,</L>
<L>I toast your health in many a glass of wine.</L>
<L>But if my mind 's contracted in itself,</L>
<L>Which always sympathises with my pelf;</L>
<L>My business done; when shades obscure the hills,</L>
<L>And poets great and small repair to Will's;</L>
<L><PB N="268" REF="273"/>Which is the best inspirer of a theme,</L>
<L>For when a rhymer will vouchsafe to dream,</L>
<L>It yields as learned liquor as Parnassus' stream,</L>
<L>I make up one to crack a sprightly jest,</L>
<L>And am as dull and spiteful as the rest:</L>
<L>Or else, my thoughtful gravity to show,</L>
<L>I ponder a Gazette, earnest to know</L>
<L>How matters are at Mantua or Cracow;</L>
<L>Whilst the sour critics who have never writ,</L>
<L>At once combin'd in damning judgement sit,</L>
<L>On Shakspeare's tragic, and Ben's comic wit;</L>
<L>That nothing can their rigid censures please,</L>
<L>But Sophocles or Aristophanes.</L>
<L>Their taunts great Dryden almost dies to hear,</L>
<L>Which wound his soul, and fire his patient ear:</L>
<L>Ev'n his own works must bear the grand inquest,</L>
<L>Though claiming equal honour with the best:</L>
<L>At last he puts on a resenting frown,</L>
<L>Which saves their fame, and vindicates his own.</L>
<L>Here Dons of wit with one another jar,</L>
<L>Eager to triumph in the learned war:</L>
<L>The tiny bards and critics flock around,</L>
<L>To glean their scraps, and echo what they sound:</L>
<L>Tom D'Urfey shows his phiz among the rest,</L>
<L>Fam'd for a thousand songs and many a jest:</L>
<L>Had he but sense to keep his asses safe,</L>
<L>The man might now and then provoke a laugh;</L>
<L>For if he can but stifle the buffoon,</L>
<L>He 'll thread a proverb nicely, nay and pun.</L>
<L>But, if these tedious brawls displease my ear,</L>
<L>I travel to the neighbouring theatre:</L>
<L><PB N="269" REF="274"/>And, if some noted monster 's to be shown,</L>
<L>I enter, take my place, and sit me down,</L>
<L>To fill the circle of that various crown.</L>
<L>On my right hand the Bona Robas sit,</L>
<L>Who hide their faces to betray their wit:</L>
<L>For unseen blushes make their clappers bold,</L>
<L>To repartee, or scandalise, or scold:</L>
<L>On my left hand a gay, spruce crowd appears,</L>
<L>Shaking a huge immoderate length of hairs:</L>
<L>Such clouds of odour from their heads distil,</L>
<L>We 're buried in perfumes which all the circle fill:</L>
<L>After three wretched tunes the curtain 's drawn,</L>
<L>The mimic crew begins to play the town,</L>
<L>Where a compendium of the world is shown.</L>
<L>Here an old father by a slave is fool'd,</L>
<L>Back'd by a lover-son to steal his gold:</L>
<L>There a fat, lowering, reverend coxcomb stares,</L>
<L>Of voice severe, and prodigal of ears:</L>
<L>His worship says as little as he can,</L>
<L>Because he writes himself an alderman.</L>
<L>Here stands Narcissus with a careless air,</L>
<L>In face and dress compos'd to wound the fair:</L>
<L>With so much grace his words and actions move,</L>
<L>If he but speak or walk, some Phyllis dies for love.</L>
<L>There in his pride a purple emperor stands,</L>
<L>And with a nod imagin'd worlds commands:</L>
<L>The badge of empire on his forehead reigns,</L>
<L>He seems to feel the burthen which he seigns.</L>
<L>There stalks a hero reeking from the wars,</L>
<L>Boasting his laurels and dishonest scars;</L>
<L><PB N="270" REF="275"/>Tells how his courage stemm'd the raging flood,</L>
<L>And gain'd the shore, and drown'd the fields in blood.</L>
<L>The females too are mingled in the scene;</L>
<L>One daub'd with tinsel, of a lofty mien,</L>
<L>Affects to stride in state, and struts a queen.</L>
<L>One innocent as a young virgin shows,</L>
<L>Another 's a coquette, and bites the beaux.</L>
<L>One takes a freedom not to be excus'd,</L>
<L>And one shews how hard mothers should be us'd.</L>
<L>The plot now thickens, where at once I view</L>
<L>In miniature whatever mortals do:</L>
<L>Their councils, manners, plotting, and affairs,</L>
<L>Their follies, vices, affectations, wars:</L>
<L>But if the play grows dull, and not yet dark,</L>
<L>I seek my female friends, and 'squire them to the park;</L>
<L>Where, with some chearful chat or amorous play,</L>
<L>We help to shift the lazy hours away.</L>
<L>Sometimes we talk of love, and what 's its cause,</L>
<L>How wild it wanders unrestrain'd by laws;</L>
<L>How strange its motions leap about the heart,</L>
<L>And please us most, when most they make us smart:</L>
<L>How it must act to propagate desire,</L>
<L>And burn our vitals with a secret fire.</L>
<L>Hence to the ladies lodgings we retreat,</L>
<L>And take a game at cribbage or picquet;</L>
<L>Or bring some reputation to the test,</L>
<L>Or gaul our neighbours with some glancing jest:</L>
<L>Tea in the midst we drink and repartee</L>
<L>(For scandal always goes along with tea).</L>
<L>Thus we beguile the hours in full delight,</L>
<L>Till day turns up the genial time of night:</L>
<L><PB N="271" REF="276"/>Then tir'd with what I can no more enjoy</L>
<L>(For pleasure 's luscious, and will quickly cloy),</L>
<L>I seek my home, and to relieve my pain,</L>
<L>Swop into bed, and snore till six again.</L>
<L>Whilst you, my friend, the dearest in my love,</L>
<L>Imhibe the health of some sweet country grove,</L>
<L>And far from town, remote from noise and care,</L>
<L>Refresh your lungs with truly vital air;</L>
<L>O! may the Gods release you from your pain,</L>
<L>And give you to my widow'd arms again!</L>
<L>Thus mourn'd Achilles for Patroclus slain.</L>
<L>Grant that the town may yet enjoy your sight,</L>
<L>As once you were, all healthful, vigorous, bright,</L>
<L>To pass with pleasing chat the tedious night.</L>
<L>O! grant me many such without an end,</L>
<L>As that, in which dear you and one more friend,</L>
<L>Drank, like the famous bards of yore, in wine,</L>
<L>Health and prosperity to all the Nine:</L>

<HEAD>THE VISION OF PATIENCE, AN ALLEGORICAL POEM, SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF MR. ALEXANDER CUMING <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. A. Cuming was first supercargo of the Suecia, a Swedish East India ship, which was wrecked on a rock about two miles E. of the island of North Ronalsha, the nor∣thermost of the Orkney islands, Nov. 18, 1740. Immedi∣ately on the ship's striking, Mr. Cuming went off in the barge, accompanied by the surgeon and six of the boldest seamen, in order to discover what the island was, but were never more heard of. Thirty-one of the sailors were saved out of 100, the ship's compliment. C.—He was an elder brother of my worthy friend <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cuming of Dorchester, the <HI>Lycidas</HI> of p. 333, and to whom the Ode in p. 340 was addressed by Mr. Boyse. N.</NOTE>, A YOUNG GENTLEMAN UNFORTUNATELY LOST IN THE NORTHERN OCEAN ON HIS RETURN FROM CHINA, 1740.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. S. BOYSE <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For an account of this ingenious writer, the reader is referred to the IId volume of this collection, p. 163; and to vol. VIII. p. 288, 289. I will now add an extract from an original letter which in July 1741 he sent to a friend, with some citations from his poem called "Deity."—"I have no great reason to brag of the success of the poem, though "The Champion" early recommended it. Divine poetry is not the taste of the age, but I hope it shall be the support of mine. It is the only subject I now take pleasure in. I have all last summer been employed by Mr. Cave in French tran∣slation, a province highly agreeable to me, and the most pro∣fitable business stirring. I have been since last September al∣most constantly with Dr. Douglas in the slavish work of in∣dex-making, alias word-catching: and am only now interrupt∣ed by his "Osteology," which takes up his whole attention, and will soon be published; the plates, which are the noblest of the kind I ever saw, being taken from the life. I have the prospect of having a new translation from the French in a few days; but Booksellers are so undistinguishing, and Au∣thors, or rather Scriblers, so plenty, that Learning, unless sup∣ported, bids fair to starve between them. I hope the best, as I begin to be a little known, and would endeavour, as far as I could, to support a good character in the literary way. —All I am sorry for, is, that the taste runs strong against every thing that is just and sensible—unless it is consecrated by the infallibility of a Pope, whose <HI>ipse dixit</HI> is as much revered as that of his Holiness at Rome."—To the same gen∣tleman, in June 1747, he affectingly laments the loss of his first wife Emilia, and describes his situation as "not whol∣ly uncomfortable." He was then at Reading, and employed by Mr. Henry in compiling "An Historical Review of the Transactions of Europe." — "My salary," he says, "is wretchedly small (half a guinea a week) both for writing the history and correcting the press; but, I bless God, I enjoy a greater degree of health than I have known for many years, and a serene melancholy, which I prefer to the most poignant sensations of pleasure I ever knew.—All I sigh for, is a settlement with some degree of independence, for my last stage of life, that I may have the comfort of my poor dear girl to be near me, and close my eyes. I should be glad to know if you have seen my <HI>History</HI>, from which you must not expect great things, as I have been overpersuaded to put my name to a composure, for which we ought to have had at least more time and better materials, and from which I have neither profit nor reputation to expect. I am now beginning 'The History of the Rebellion,'. a very difficult and invidious task. All the accounts I have yet seen are either defective, confused, or heavy. I think myself, from my long residence in Scotland, not unqualified for the attempt, but I apprehend it is premature; and, by waiting a year or two, better materials would offer. Some account, I think, will probably be pub∣lished abroad, and give us light into many things we are now at a loss to account for. I am about a translation (at my leisure hours) of an invaluable French work, intituled, 'L' H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stoire Universelle,' by the late M Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux, and preceptor to the Dauphin▪ eldest son of Lewis XIV. I propose only to give his Dissertations on the An∣cient Empires, viz. the Egyptian, Assyrian, Grecian, and Roman, which he has described with surprising conciseness, and with equal judgement and beauty. I design to inscribe it to the Right Honourable Mr. Lyttelton, one of the Lords of the Treasury, one of the most amiable men I have ever known, and to whose uncommon goodness if you knew my obligations, you would esteem him as much as he deserves."</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>EPISTLE TO HENRY BROOKE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In 1738," says the gentleman to whom I am obliged for this poem, "Mr. Boyse did me a real favour by intro∣ducing me to the acquaintance of the amiable and ingenious. Mr. Brooke, the author of 'Gustavus Vasa.' I visited Mr. Brooke almost every day while he was composing that tra∣gedy; I perused it, scene by scene, as it was written. On that account perhaps, and the esteem which I bear to the author, I may be biassed in its favour; but I do not think that a tragedy of equal merit has appeared since that time. I have now by me the four first acts of it in manuscript, given me by the author, before the fifth was finished. During our ac∣quaintance, poor Boyse, by his irregularities, somehow gave offence to Mr. Brooke, who for a time declined his visits. Boyse, sensible of his fault, (for no man's repentance was more poignant for the time, but, alas! it was brief and fleeting) addressed to Mr. Brooke this penitentiary epistle, which, with a solemn promise of amendment, restored him to favour. —Boyse was a man of no party: whatever were his private sen∣timents, his public political creed was influenced by his ne∣cessities. In regard to his person, he was of a middle size, of a thin habit, slovenly in his dress, which was increased by his necessities, very near-sighted, and his hearing imper∣fect; these circumstances, added to his natural diffidence, and his not having been accustomed to appear in good com∣pany but as necessitous, and a mendicant, gave him an awk∣ward sheepish air, which by no means prejudiced strangers in his favour. His liberal translation of Voltaire's three epistles on Happiness, Freedom of Will, and Envy, are well execu∣ted. They were published, without his name, in the year 1738; but I am a good witness they were written by him; for, when finished, as his cloaths were then deposited at the pawn∣broker's, I treated with the late Mr. Dodsley for the manu∣script, of whom I could only obtain a poor two guineas." The sheets were sent to me from the press for correction." C.</NOTE>, ESQ.</HEAD>

<P>VOL. V. p. 302. "Dr. Brady attempted in blank verse a transla∣tion of the Eneid, which, when dragged into the world, did not live long enough to cry. I have never seen it; but that such a version there is, or has been, perhaps some old catalogue informed me.—With not much better success, Trapp, when his Tragedy and his Prelections had given him reputation, attempted another blank version of the Eneid; to which, notwithstanding the slight regard with which it was treated, he had afterwards perseverance enough to add the Eclogues and Georgies. His book may continue its existence as long as it is the clandestine refuge of schoolboys." DR. JOHNSON.</P>
<P>VOL. VI. p. 82. Since the account of Mr. Hardinge was printed, his son has obliged the learned world with a curious little volume of his father's "Latin Verses;" amongst which is a corrected copy of the Ode in p. 85 of <HI>this</HI> volume. It was written at Knowle Hill in 1739, and addressed
<Q>“"to Stephen Poynte, Esq. Preceptor to the Duke of Cumber∣land.”</Q>
The correction consists of the following enlarge∣ment of the sixth and seventh stanzas into four:

Mr. Hardinge, it is said, translated this Ode, and at the same time engaged Dr. Davies to make another transla∣tion. Both are preserved, and printed in a volume of Eng∣lish verses which I have not had the pleasure of seeing. The Latin poems are of various dates; some of them school exercises at Eton in 1717, 1718; others at Cam∣bridge 1719—1722; a poem on the death of his eldest son, 1746; an epitaph on his father (George Hardinge, M. A.) 1750; one small poem in 1754; and epistles to several of his friends between 1730 and 1750. I mention these so mi∣nutely, as the volume in which they are printed has been circulated only among a few friends.</P>
