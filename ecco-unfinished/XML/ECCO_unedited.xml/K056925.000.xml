<HEAD>THE
REPRESENTATION
OF THE
Lower House of Convocation of the
English-Clergy Examined, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pious Zeal and just Concern of the Re∣verend
Members of the Lower House of
Convocation, express'd against the late Ex∣cessive
Growth of <HI>Infidelity, Heresy,</HI> and <HI>Pro∣phaneness,</HI>
in their late Representation, and
otherwise, can never be sufficiently Commended,
or Encouraged. It is hoped no Reader of these
Remarks, will be so Uncharitable to imagine,
that we are entring the Lists against the Convo∣cation,
in Defence of the aforesaid Abhor'd and
Abominable Crimes of <HI>Infidelity, Heresie and Pro∣faneness.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not either, concern these Papers in any
part of the Reasons given by the Right Reverend
the Upper House of Convocation, for their dis∣agreeing
with the Lower House in the said Re∣presentation,
which in the Title of the Repre∣sentation
is called <HI>Rejecting it by the Ʋpper-House;</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
otherwise than just to Note in Defence of the said
Upper House; that however I do not enquire
what their Lordships Reasons <HI>were</HI> for the said Dis∣agreeing
with the Lower House, which I doubt
not were very good, it may yet be allow'd to
say Negatively what they <HI>were not,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) Not for
any want of Zeal in their Lordships against the
aforesaid Crimes, or that their Lordships were
in the least willing to Favour or Encourage <HI>Infide∣lity,
Heresie</HI> or <HI>Prophaneness,</HI> which they are very
sensible, have of late excessively increased in these
Nations, and which they have on all occasions
given Testimony both of their Concern about,
and their Zeal against: Nor was it, as is hum∣bly
advanc'd in their Lordship's behalf, that they,
the Upper House, should not be very willing
upon all Occasions to join in a regular manner,
and as far as they think their Duty, with the
Lower House, in duly Representing to Her
Majesty the State of Religion, with respect as
well to these, as all other Evils that obstruct
the Growth of the true Christian Religion in
these Nations; altho' they could not join in the
several Additions, as well as some Circumstances
in the manner, which their Lordships thought
they had just Reason to dislike in the said Repre∣sentation.</P>
<P>If any Man pleases to Revise the Two Differ∣ing
Representations as they are Published, and
as they both passed in the respective House of
Convocation, they need not be at much Difficul∣ty
to find out the Point in which the Two Houses
Disagreed. And tho' the said Disagreement is
perhaps the Principal Reason why the said Re∣presentations
were respectively printed, by way
of Appeal to the World; and to give them op∣portunity
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
to judge of the said Difference; yet I
shall rather take notice of some things wherein
the said Representatation differs from the true
State of Religion in <HI>England,</HI> which it is said to
Represent, than of such things wherein it differs
from the Opinion of the Upper House. Nor shall
I take this by way of Paragraph, as if we were
going to give a particular Answer to the Repre∣sentation,
but rather Examine, agreeable to our
Title, what is the true State of Religion in this
Nation in the Case Repre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ented; and say some∣thing,
which, had the Reverend Convocation
look'd with an Impartial Eye, into the Circumstan∣ces
of the Church, they would have seen great
Cause to have added in the Body of their Re∣presentation,
or to have alter'd the Substance of
it, so as that it might have Included these things
with (or perhaps instead of) some of those on
which they lay the Great Stress of their humble
Complaint.</P>
<P>All Men will grant the Truth of the first Asser∣tion
in the Representation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that “a De∣luge
of Impiety and Licentiousness hath broken
in upon us, and overspread the Face of this
Church and Kingdom, and also that this is Mat∣ter
of Unspeakable Grief.”</P>
<P>But it is humbly Referr'd to the Consideration
of all Impartial Men, that the Source of this De∣luge
is not thorowly Traced by the Convoca∣tion;
and that had the Reverend Members of
the Committee not fainted in their Search, they
might have gone much farther back than the late
Rebellion, and indeed might have come to a full
stop, even at the Native, True, Undoubted
Spring, and Original, to which we all owe the
Progress of Satan's Kingdom, and the Mon∣strous
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Eruption of all manner of Wickedness i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Nation.</P>
<P>This the Reverend Committee seems to own
themselves sensible of, when in speaking of the
<HI>Source</HI> aforesaid, they say with great Modesty▪
as far back as we have Trac'd it, signifying, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they could have Trac'd it farther back; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
being rather willing to have it fix'd upon those
Times, than Convinc'd that it ought not to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
look'd for somewhere else, they set down thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for its Original; reserving nevertheless a Doo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of Escape at this Cautious Parenthesis, (as fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
back as we have Trac'd it.) To which it had been
very happy, if they had thought fit to have sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
subjoin'd some Reasons, as no doubt they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
many very good ones to produce, why they Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ced it no farther.</P>
<P>This had serv'd to Silence those Unquiet Pha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
naticks, who alledge that the Convocation have
been Partial in fixing the Source of our <HI>Impiety</HI>
and <HI>Licentiousness</HI> at a wrong Period, in order
to blacken their Party, and the Times when they
had the Reins in their hands; while they (th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Convocation) knew the true Spring of them lay
father back, where they did not care to look
and that they did not Trace it back farther, for
fear of finding it where it was, and therefore
look for it, where it was not. At the same time
giving no other Reason why they place the sai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Source of our Evil there, than this, viz. (not that
they could not) but that have not Traced <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
farther back.</P>
<P>Wherefore I humbly crave leave to Remar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
that in Justice to Truth, the Reverend the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mittee of the Convocation, ought, and in Dut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the Nature of a True Representation, we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
oblig'd, besides their Debt of Sincerity to their
Sovereign, before whom they were laying the
True State of Religion in this Nation, to have
Trac'd the Deluge of these Impieties, not to a
Supposed, but to a True and Real <HI>Source.</HI> And I
<HI>think, with Submission,</HI> that it is not a sufficient
Evidence to prove the <HI>Source</HI> of those Impieties is
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in the late long unnatural Rebellion, to say
that they have Trac'd it no farther, <HI>since by that
Rule,</HI> for any thing that appears in this Represen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation,
the said Source may be any where else,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s well as there; and perhaps may be somewhere
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e and not there.</P>
<P>And that I may with the most Impartial Care
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther Represent the Injustice of this placing our
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pieties at the Period aforesaid, it is humbly
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffered,</HI> That the true <HI>Source</HI> of all this <HI>Deluge of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>piety,</HI> is rather to be plac'd at that Wretched
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Unhappy Time, when Iniquity was Estab∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed
by a Law; when the Sword of Authority,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ish God for <HI>the terror of Evil doers,</HI> had put in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>the
Hands of the Supreme Magistrate, and
which he ought not to <HI>have born in vain,</HI> being
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>trusted by his Sovereign Lord and Maker, to

Pleasurers were the Exercise of God's Holy Day

the high places of the Earth, and feed thee with
the heritage of Jacob thy Father; for the mouth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Lord hath spoken it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Instead of these strict observings of the Sab∣bath,
the fore<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid Impious Proclamation pulls
down the Sacred Sense of God's Command, and
lays the Sabbath open to the Licentious and A∣bominable
Practise of Sport and Pastimes; giving
License to the People to meet together for the
profess'd Publick horrid Insulting of their Mak∣er
in these very words.</P>
<P>“Our Pleasure likewise is that after the end
of Divine Service, our good People be not Dis∣turbed,
Letted or Discouraged from any Law∣ful
Recreations on Sundays, or other Holidays;
such as Dancing, Men or Women, archery
Leaping Vaulting: nor from having may
Games, Whitson-ales, and Morrie Dancing and
setting up May-poles, and other Sports there∣with
used, so as the same be had in Convenient
time, without Impediment or neglect of Di∣vine
Service. <HI>Vid. Book of Sports, P. 6.”</HI></P>
<P>We should cause more of this to be Quoted
but that the thing is so abominable, it seems grie∣vous
to write, and a Melancholly thing to be
handed down to Posterity.</P>
<P>Let our Reverend Fathers of the Convocation
be Judges for the Justice of this present Remon∣strance,
that this is the most palpable period of
time; and indeed the only one to which the
Source of the Great Deluge of Impiety and Li∣centiousness
that is broke in upon us ought to be
trac'd. Nor can they Adjourn the beginning of
those things from this time, to the late <HI>Ʋnnatural
Rebellion,</HI> unless it be, because that K. <HI>Ch—s</HI> I. the
Son of the aforesaid King <HI>Ja—s</HI> renew'd the same
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
War against Heaven, which his Father had
wickedly begun, by Reprinting the said Procla∣mation,
and adding his own Authority to renew
those Sports and Pastimes, in the Ninth Year of
his Reign; which abominable Practise was not,
as may be justly thought, the least occasion of the
dreadful Plague of Civil War, and Rebellion
which broke out in a few Years after, and which
ended in the Destruction of that King, and for a
while in the Subversion of the Government.</P>
<P>I can not therefore but referr back to those
Miserable Times, when all manner of Wicked∣ness,
Profaness, Contempt of God, and of his
Sabbath, broke in upon this Nation, partly by
the Connivance, and partly by the open Autho∣rity
of the Crown.</P>
<P>From this wicked Practice we can not won∣der,
if either on the one hand, Licentious People
the restraint of the Law being taken away, took
their ful Liberty to provoke God with open Im∣moralities,
or that the Enemies of Revealed Re∣ligion
took an Advantage from hence to mock
and make a jest of Religion in General; or that
all manner of Error crept in, where so gross an
Error led the way, under the shelter of Royal
Authority.</P>
<P>From hence began the General Debauching of
the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> the Sober,
Pious, Diligent and Learned Ministers being
every where Turn'd out of their Livings; which
they willingly and chearfully forsook, rather
than Submit to Read that Abominable Book in
their Churches which they foresaw would be <HI>the
Source of all Impiety and Licentiousness</HI> (the Con∣vocations
own words) and likewise to be found
in Mr. <HI>Perkins</HI> Reason of the Separation of the
Puritans, <HI>pag.</HI> 16.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
It was, <HI>says that good Old Christian,</HI> an inex∣pressible
Grief of Soul to those good Men, to
see the same Pulpits, where they had with
Labour, Conscience, and Diligence Unweari∣ed,
Preached to their People the Sound Do∣ctrines
of the Gospel of Christ, and thundred
out the Curses of God's Righteous Law a∣gainst
<HI>Sabbath-Breakers,</HI> Riotous Persons, and
Profaners of God's Holy Ordinances, made
the Trumpetters to Proclaim Satan's King∣dom,
to License what God had strictly for∣bidden,
under Severe Comination, and the
People Invited to Wickedness from the same
Places, and by the Mouths of the same Mi∣nisters
that used to Invite them to Holiness,
and Christian Purity; and therefore many
good Men chose to Suffer the loss of their
Livings, and forsake their Churches; which
were now become the <HI>Source</HI> of <HI>Impiety</HI> and
<HI>Licentiousness.</HI></P>
<P>How unhappy now was it for our Convocati∣on,
that being to Represent to Her Majesty the
State of Religion, in their Enquiry into, and
Search after the Source of Impiety and Profane∣ness,
they should stop short at the late Rebellion,
never look back to the true beginning of the
thing, and FOB Her Majesty off, only with tel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling

the True Original and Source of our Impiety and

But the other Absurdities of this Representation,
call me off from this needful Work, so that I

<P>What the State of Religion in <HI>England</HI> was

in the words of the Representation it self, (<HI>Viz.</HI>)
<HI>That</HI> England <HI>was Eminent for Purity of Faith,

those Eminent Divines of the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
who were overwhelmed by the First Eruption

and as I quoted before, were cast out of their Li∣vings,

which then ran through the Kingdom,

to Debauch the Morals of the People. As
to the King himself, those Devout Christians,
who put up their daily Prayers in his House of
Revels, now the Royal Chappel, can not when
they cast up their Eyes Ejaculatorily to Heaven,
but see the Image of the Sovereign of those
Times, Crown'd with Garlands, and Celebrat∣ing
the Baccanalian Triumphs of Drunkenness

<HI>The Church,</HI> formerly the pure Temple of Di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ine
Adoration, and the Place where True Re∣ligion
was <HI>Taught;</HI> the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
<HI>Propagated,</HI> Youth <HI>Catechised</HI> and <HI>Instructed,</HI> and
God <HI>Honoured;</HI> now became the Theatre of
Strife, filled with the Farce Additional Ceremo∣nies
Unprescribed by the Connon, and with con∣tinued
Railery at those, who were not able to le∣vel
their Principles to the loosness of the Times.</P>
<P><HI>The Church-Yards</HI> were Throng'd every Lord's
Day with the Youths of the Country, <HI>just like a
Market, place or a Fair;</HI> who stood ready, assoon
<HI>as the blessing was out of the Minister's Mouth,</HI> to
call as Loudly for that Curse that God has pro∣nounced
against those that break his Command∣ments:
The Joyful shout of the Congregation
Singing Praises to God <HI>at the Conclusion of his
Worship,</HI> was immediately Eccho'd <HI>from without,</HI>
by the Rabble shouting to the <HI>Ring,</HI> and to the
<HI>Dance,</HI> to the <HI>Wrestling</HI> and the <HI>Cudgel playing;</HI>
and the Ministers who had but just before Reve∣rently
prayed to God <HI>for the People,</HI> joyns in pro∣voking
God <HI>with them.</HI> No sooner was the Ser∣vice
Ended, but the Bells began to Ring, the
Ale-House open, the People, fall to Dancing, and
Revelling—<HI>the blessed Equivolent to Queen</HI>
Elizabeth's <HI>Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>The Sober Religious, Godly Family's who
with their old Ministers, abhored this way of
Prophaning God's Day, <HI>Retired;</HI> shut themselves
up in their Houses, and spent the rest of the Day
in Reading God's Word, Instructing their Chil∣dren
and Servants, and Praying with their Fami∣lies;
for which they were <HI>Damn'd as Schismaticks,</HI>
Reproch'd as <HI>Puritans,</HI> and Precise People their
Windows often broke, and they Branded as Dis∣loyal,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
and Disaffected, being they would not o∣bey
the Commands of their Prince, to go to the
Devil the Shortest Way.</P>
<P>Two things had their beginning at this Period;
and tho' I do not descend to the Proof of it, for
want of room in this Tract, yet I offer my self to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
prove the Fact at any time.</P>
<Q><P>1. <HI>Dissenting began here;</HI> and had it not been
for this Abominable Step, there had been no
such thing known in this Nation, <HI>as a breaking<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
off from the Church;</HI> For the Old <HI>Puritans,</HI> al∣tho'
they did Dislike some things, yet they
made it a point of Conscience, not to break
off in Communion from the Church; and
probably never had broken off, if this Vil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Attempt, of setting up an Allowed Prophana
tion of the Lord's Day had not been made
and they push'd at to join in it; which the
refus'd to do, from the very same Principle
that the Glorious Mrtyrs in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>
Days refused Popery; at the price of their
Lives, and the Penalty of Fire and Faggot.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Deluge of Impiety and Licentiousness</HI> be∣gan
here, which has since overspread the
Face of this Nation; and here the Convoca∣tion
<HI>might have found it,</HI> If they had thought
fit to have <HI>Trac'd it farder back.</HI> And a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
these Reverend Gentlemen, cannot be igno
rant of the Fact, there is no doubt, but th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Knowledge they had of its being to be found<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
here, was one principal Reason, why the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<HI>Trac'd it no farther back</HI> than the late Rebe∣lion.</P></Q>
<P>Come we next to Enquire Concerning the Pe∣riod
where these Gentlemen have placed it
(<HI>Viz.</HI>) The late Rebellion; from which it ma
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
be allowed it had an Addition; tho' I cannot al∣low
the Source or beginning to be there, as the
Convocation has alledged; Now, tho' in strict Rea∣soning,
this is nothing to the purpose; because,
when People are Tracing a Stream to its Source,
the additional Channels that may add to and en∣large
that Stream, are nothing to the Main En∣quiry;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) its Source or beginning, which is
the Question in hand; yet having first prov'd un∣denyably,
that the Source or Original of these
things was not rightly placed; and this I think
is plain, <HI>I shall not stick to grant them,</HI> that those
beginnings of Mischief, <HI>tho' risen to a Deluge be∣fore
the said War,</HI> yet receiv'd a Great Addition
from the Accident of the said <HI>Rebellion.</HI></P>
<P>But then it would be Natural to Enquire from
which Party, or from which Side, either of
King or Parliament, during that Unnatural Re∣bellion,
the <HI>Deluge of Impiety</HI> aforesaid, receiv'd
the greatest Addition: And tho' the mighty
Cry of <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> and <HI>Puritanism</HI> which was raised
against the Parliament Party, seems to carry an
acknowledgement with it, that they had at least
a greater shew of Religion, and restraint of Man∣ners
than ordinary, <HI>whether sincere or not, is not
to my purpose;</HI> Yet it must be own'd, the King's
Party were no Hypocrites, but gave themselves
a Liberty in all manner of avowed Wickedness,
Blasphemy, Oaths, Drunkenness, and Debauch∣ry;
which all their Writers acknowledge, and
the King himself often spoke of with regret, <HI>but
could never restrain:</HI> This had certainly some
share in the Addition <HI>to the Deluge</HI> aforesaid;
since tho' there may be but little True Religion,
where there is <HI>a great show</HI> of it, yet there is cer∣tainly
less, where there is <HI>no show at all:</HI> And it
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
is better for a Nation, <HI>if one of the two Misfor∣tunes
must befall it,</HI> to have a false appearance of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Religion, than no Vestiges or appearance of Re∣ligion
at all; For they that pretend to Religion,
tho' falsly, will put on a shew of Sanctity, and
some appearance of Morals, whereas the other
with their pretences to Religion, cast off all pre∣tences
to Sobreity of Manners, or to the Rule
of Humanity it self.</P>
<P>Much of this was the Case in the late Unnatu∣ral
War; one Side pretended to Religion, '<HI>tis
nothing to me in this Enquiry, whether they did any<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
more than pretend or no,</HI> let that lie as it will<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
but the other pretended to nothing, but gave an
entire Loose to all manner of Profaneness and
Impiety.</P>
<P>Now whether of these Contributed most to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the Encreasing the Deluge, <HI>for that it was a De∣luge
before, has been clearly proved,</HI> of Impiety and<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Licentiousness which is broke in upon this Nati∣on,
is for any body to determine.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Matter therefore seems to lie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
thus, and had the Convocation thought fit to
have acted Impartially, they would have Con∣cluded
 it so.</P>
<Q>That the Original and <HI>Source</HI> of that <HI>Deluge</HI> of
Impiety and Licentiousness which is broken in
upon this Nation, is to be found in the letting<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
loose the People to all manner of Liberty, in the
Prophanation of the Lords Day, and taking
off the Restraint of the Laws from them, by the
<HI>Book of Sports;</HI> by which, the Wicked Na
ture of Men being left to its own full swing, run
out into all manner of E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cess, and that the
same being Encreased on both sides, during the
late Ʋnnatural Rebellion, has produc'd in the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
Minds of Men, a disregard to the very ap∣pearances
of Religion, and is ended in a Spirit of
down right Libertinism and Profaneness,
which have ever since too much prevail'd upon
us.</Q>
<P>Had the Reverend the Committee thought fit
to have given this honest account of the thing,
Her Majesty had then had a True and Im∣partial
State of Religion in the Nation, and
all Men would have acquiesced in the Justice of
it, as what every good Man acknowledges with
regret.</P>
<P>But this is Prevaricating with Her Majesty, giv∣ing
a partial Representation of the Thing, assign∣ing
it to a false, and apparently wrong Original,
concealing the Truth, and endeavouring to A∣buse
Her Majesty, by Loading those People with
the Beginnings and Cause of this Mischief, who
had no hand in it; and confidently giving such a
Reason for their fixing it there, as consists nei∣ther
with Justice to the Case it self, <HI>or good Man∣ners
to the QƲEEN;</HI> seing to say they <HI>have
Traced it but so far,</HI> is to imply, they did not
think themselves obliged <HI>to Trace it thoroughly for
Her Majesties Satisfaction,</HI> but so far only as
might be for their Purpose, in imposing upon her
Majesty, and the whole Nation.</P>
<P>After having thus found them Deficient in the
Searching or <HI>Tracing</HI> this Evil to its True <HI>Source;</HI>
it could not reasonably be expected they should
give a True Account of its Progress, or Restraint,
<HI>neither indeed have they done so.</HI></P>
<P>In the First Place, the Representation drops
the Subject, and as a thing, which indeed they
foresaw would lie too heavy at last, where they
did not desire to feel the weight, they leave the
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
Subject of their <HI>Inexpressible Grief</HI> (viz.) the <HI>De∣luge
of Impiety, Licentiousness and Profaneness,</HI> and
lay the whole stress of their Complaint, upon
the Publishing Blasphemous and Heretical Books
&amp; Notions in the World, in prejudice of the Fun
damentall Doctrine of the Christian Faith.</P>
<P>But they Err in the first Step, Concerning
what has already, and would again put a check
to this Evil, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Laying it all upon Restrain∣ing
the Liberty of the Press.</P>
<P>This is so Gross a Mistake, and is aproved so
by Experience and by the Temper and Customs
of the People of this Nation, that on the contra∣ry,
the Liberty of the Press, so far as it is Legal∣ly
a Liberty, both is and may be the best step to
pull down and put a stop to Error, Heresie and
Blasphemous Principles.</P>
<P>The Christian Religion, which is founded u∣pon
Truth, and seeks Demonstration, has in all
Ages Flourished by the Liberty of the Press; and
the Restraining the Press at this Day in Popish
Countries, by the great Labour of the Inquisiti∣on,
is the Reason why the Reformation can get
no footing in <HI>Spain,</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> or
in <HI>Italy.</HI> It has in all those Places been the Com∣plaint
of the Protestants, as it was of St. <HI>Augusting</HI>
in former times, That Christians were not al∣lowed
to Defend their Doctrine by Writing, and
by force of Reason and Argument; believing that
the Christian, as also the Protestant Faith, would
ever gain ground of Error and Heresies, if they
were admitted to Print freely, and disperse their
Writings in its Defence; and Publish their Expo∣sitions;
by which the Eyes of the Common Peo∣ple
would be Enlighned, and their Understand∣ings
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
freed from the Mists of Darkness, Supersti∣tion
and Error.</P>
<P>This was the very Case in the first Reformati∣on
in <HI>England;</HI> and the Papists finding that the
Doctrine of the <HI>Lollards,</HI> as they call them, or
<HI>Waldenses,</HI> spread among the Common People,
by the Reading of the Books of that Famous Man
<HI>John Wicklif,</HI> they immediatly applyed them∣selves
to the same Work now proposed (and
perhaps for the same Reason) (<HI>viz.</HI>) putting a
Restraint upon the Press, and destroying all
those Books, as far as they could lay their hands
upon them.</P>
<P>Our Clergy are not insensible, that putting
Legal Restraints upon the Press in <HI>Spain,</HI> and in
<HI>Portugal,</HI> is the Reason that the Bible is kept from
the Laity, and the People kept from the Know∣ledge
of the Scriptures; and the having but an
Heretical Book in a Family in those Countries,
is enough to bring the Master of that Family in∣to
the Inquisition.</P>
<P>Therefore there is no doubt but putting such
Restraints upon the Press, would suppress very
much the PRINTING: But I must tell them,
it might not suppress at all the Publishing those
Blasphemous Errors of which they now Com∣plain.</P>
<Q><P>1. Because they could by no Power in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
ever expect a Law to prevent Peoples
Reading such Books, or keeping them in
their Houses, they could never get leave to
Search Houses for them, and punish the
People where they were found; unless they
could set up a kind of Protestant Inquisition
here.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
2. The Temper of our People being so Curi∣ous
after Books, and particularly so after
such as are Prohibit or forbid, the Searching
for such Books, would be the readiest Step
they could take, to make People put a Va∣lue
upon them, Enquire for them, and Pur∣chase
them, whatever they Cost: As was
Experienced by the Papists, in the Case of
<HI>Wickliff, Bilney,</HI> and <HI>Tindal</HI>'s Books, in the
14th, 15th, and 16th Century.</P></Q>
<P>But what are these Legal Restraints they want
We may very well understand what they mean,
by their telling us what the Success was of those
they had. It is Evident, the Legal Restraint
they had, was a LICENSER; that is, a
Tyrant of the Press. This was crush'd after∣ward,
on the following Reasons.</P>
<Q><P>1. Because it was Illegal in its Nature, being
against the Right of the English Nation, to
be forbidden freedom of Speech, in their
own Lawful and Just Defence. Since were
a Book ever so Necessary, or Just, Useful or
Profitable in a Publick on a Private Case, it
lay in the Breast of such LICENSER to
Suppress it, and Silence the Author.</P>
<P>2. Because the Management of the English
Government so often shifting Hands, it may
come to pass, that the Press may come whol∣ly
into such Hands, which may put the
same Oppressive Injurious Restraint upon
the CHURCH, as was likely to have hap∣pen'd,
if King <HI>James</HI> had continued.</P></Q>
<P>3. Because it Deprives the Subject of making
the National Oppressions and Grievances, when
such happen, known to the People.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
4. If error and Heresie should ever get the
redominancy in the Government in <HI>England</HI>
which God forbid) the True Religion may
Suffer the same Yoak.</P>
<P>But after all, we say farther.</P>
<Q><P>1. There are Sufficient Legal Restraints upon
the Press already; since every Error, Schism
and Heresie maintained in Print, may be
Prosecuted by our Laws, may be condemn'd
and the Person Censured for the same, and
Punished, whether Author, or Publisher,
or both, as is evident in the Governments
daily Prosecuting Seditious Books; the same
Law being in Force against Heretical Blas∣phemous
Libels; and the Fault is rather the
Church not putting such Laws in Executi∣on,
and duly Prosecuting such People, ra∣ther
than want of Laws to Prosecute upon.</P>
<P>2. This is all a kind of a Tacit Acknowledg∣ment
of the weakness of the Christian Do∣ctrine,
or the Incapacity of the Church of
<HI>England's</HI> Divines to Defend it; and the
Jealousie they seem to have, that Error and
Heresie should get Ground of them by Dis∣putation.
The contrary to which is, what
our Divines of the Church of <HI>England</HI> have
all along pretended to; witness Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI>'s
Challenge to the Dissenters, wherein he
says, All the Church of <HI>England</HI> Divines de∣sire
is, to have People come fairly and pro∣pose
their Doubts, and make due Enquiry
after Truth, that they may hear what both
Sides have to say, and Determine for them∣selves.</P></Q>
<P>But this Pretence of having the Press Restrain∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is
Declaring the Church, of <HI>England</HI> is not
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
able to stand her Ground against Heresie an
Schism in Matters of Dispute; and therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
like Monsieur <HI>Jurieu</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> Disputi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
with Mr. S—<HI>is,</HI> when he found his Adversa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
was too hard for him, he Petition'd the STATE
that Mr. <HI>S—is</HI> might not be permitted to Wri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
any more against him. Or, as the Examin∣lately
against the <HI>Medley;</HI> who finding himself
Oppress'd with the <HI>Medly's</HI> Arguments, Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out
to have the Ministry punish him for it.</P>
<P>Just thus the Fam'd Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI> (a∣bove-mentioned)
did by Mr. <HI>Delaun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
who Accepted the Doctor's Challenge
which, as I have Noted, he made t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> to come and have
their Doubts fairly Discussed. But
when the Dr. found his Challenge was
Accepted, by a Man of Superior Learn∣ing
to himself, Caused the Book to be
Crused at the Printing-House, by the
same Legal Restraint upon the Press
which the Convocation now are Desi∣ring,
and his Antagonist was most Ef∣fectually
Silenced, by Perishing in a
Jayle.</P>
<Q>This was the way that <HI>Stephen Gard∣ner</HI>
Disputed with Archbisho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Cranmer, Bonner,</HI> with <HI>John</HI> Phil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>pot;</HI> Bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> with <HI>Prinn</HI> and
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
<HI>Bastiwick; Calamy,</HI> with <HI>Delaune;
Obadiah Walker,</HI> with Dr. <HI>Hough;</HI>
King <HI>James,</HI> with the <HI>Seven Bishops,</HI>
and <HI>Sacheverel</HI> with <HI>D' Foe.</HI> And
this it seems is the way our Con∣vocation
earnestly desires to Dis∣pute
with the Schismaticks.</Q>
<P>But they that know the Strength of
the <HI>Protestant Doctrine,</HI> the Orthodox
Foundation of the Church of <HI>England
Principles,</HI> and the Ability of her D I∣VINES
to <HI>Defend it,</HI> Contemn the
Assistance of Force to Suppress Error;
and to Answer Arguments with Vio∣lence.</P>
<P>For this Reason, they have on all
Occasions, powerfully Resisted, and
Successfully also, all the Errors of the
Times, to this Day; and have now set
about that most Effectual Step to fix a
good Foundation of RELIGION
in Posterity, as the best Means to fix
them in the Truth, and Fortifie them
against Heresie; <HI>and this is,</HI> the Early
Instruction of Youth, Breeding Chil∣dren
up in a clear Understanding of the
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
first Principles of the Christian Religi∣on;
which, <HI>if well pursued,</HI> there would
be less Danger of the Corruption of Er∣ror
taking Place among them. And
this will do more towards Establishing
the Minds of the People, against the
Contagion of Heresie, than all the
Empty Negatives of keeping Ill Book
out of their Hands.</P>
<P>To this, <HI>they might have joyned</HI> a steady
Prosecution of the Law against every
Erroneous Book, either in the Name o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
themselves, or in the Name and Autho∣rity
of the Government, which no
doubt would agree to it; which if Profecuted, as the Law does already su∣ficiently
Direct and allow; would in
a few Years be totally and effectually
Discouraged, and Suppress'd.</P>
<P>One Thing more might be added
here; and which, <HI>next to the Instruction
of the Youth,</HI> is the most Effectual Step
that can be taken; towards the taking
away all Danger of the Peoples being
Debauched into Error; and the Omis∣sion
of which, perhaps is at present the
Chief Reason why they are so easily led
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
away from the Church. <HI>And this is</HI> the
Effectual Reformation of the Clergy of
the Church of <HI>England;</HI> which howe∣ver
the Convocation have thought fit to
leave wholly out of their Representation
of the <HI>State of Religion,</HI> is the Great
thing which is now wanting, to Sup∣press
Flagrant Errors, Blasphemies,
Heresies, and Atheistical Writings; and
the want of which, is at present the
Grief of all Good Man in the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> as well as the Triumph of her Enemies.</P>
<P>I am not here preparing a Satyr upon
the Vices of the Clergy of the <HI>Church
of England;</HI> the Author of this is one,
who rather Mourns for the want of
their Reformation, than Rejoyees over
their Falling; but at the same time▪
cannot but wonder how the Reverend
Convocation could leave it out of a Re∣presentation
of the State of RELIGION;
especially if they had a Design by it, to
have a Stop put to the Deluge of Im∣piety
and Licentiousness, which is broke∣n
upon us, and which, the Reforming
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
the Clergy, is the first and best Step t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Deliver us from.</P>
<P>Wherefore, if the Author Lives <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to pursue this Argument, he shall E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
deavour to lay down the True Method
how the State of Religion, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
present thus Declining, may be Re∣stored; the Number of Dissenters Le∣sened,
the Blasphemy, Errors and In∣fidelity
of the Age Suppress'd, without
Running such Lengths as the Represen∣tation
seems to Aim at.</P>
