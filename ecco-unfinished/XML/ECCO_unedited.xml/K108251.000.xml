<HEAD>A
DISSERTATION.</HEAD>
<P>NATIONS, small in their beginnings and slow in their progress
to maturity, cannot, with any degree of certainty, be traced
to their source. The first historians, in every country, are, therefore,
obscure and unsatisfactory. Swayed by a national partiality, natural
to mankind, they adopted uncertain legends and ill-fancied fictions,
when they served to strengthen a favourite system, or to throw lustre on
the antient state of their country. Without judgment or discernment
to separate the probable and more antient traditions, from ill-digested
tales of late invention, they jumbled the whole together, in one
mass of anachronisms and inconsistencies. Their accounts, how∣ever,
though deduced from aeras too remote to be known, were re∣ceived
with that partial credulity which always distinguishes an un∣polished
age. Mankind had neither abilities nor inclination to dis∣pute
the truth of relations, which, by throwing lustre on their an∣cestors,
flattered their own vanity.—Such were the historians of
Europe, during the dark ages, which succeeded the subversion of
the Roman empire. When learning began to revive, men looked
into antiquity with less prejudiced eyes. They chose rather to trust
their national fame to late and well-attested transactions, than draw
it from ages, dark and involved in fable.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
THE Romans give the first and, indeed, the only authentic ac∣counts
of the northern nations. Destitute of the use of letters,
they themselves had no means of transmitting their history to po∣sterity.
Their traditions and songs were lost, or altogether corrupt∣ed,
in their revolutions and migrations, which were so frequent and
universal, that no kingdom in Europe is now possessed by its origi∣nal
inhabitants. Societies were formed, and kingdoms erected,
from a mixture of nations, who, in process of time, lost all know∣lege
of their own origin.</P>
<P>IF tradition could be depended upon, it is only among a people,
from all time, free of intermixture with foreigners. We are to
look for these among the mountains and inaccessible parts of a
country: places, on account of their barrenness, uninviting to an
enemy, or whose natural strength enabled the natives to repel in∣vasions.
Such are the inhabitants of the mountains of Scotland.
We, accordingly, find, that they differ materially from those who
possess the low aud more fertile part of the kingdom. Their lan∣guage
is pure and original, and their manners are those of an an∣tient
and unmixed race of men. Conscious of their own antiquity,
they long despised others, as a new and mixed people. As they
lived in a country only fit for pasture, they were free of that toil
and business, which engross the attention of a commercial people.
Their amusement consisted in hearing or repeating their songs and
traditions, and these intirely turned on the antiquity of their nation,
and the exploits of their forefathers. It is no wonder, therefore,
that there are more remains of antiquity among them, than among
any other people in Europe. Traditions, however, concerning re∣mote
periods, are only to be regarded, in so far as they co-incide
with cotemporary writers of undoubted credit and veracity.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
No writers began their accounts from a more early period, than
the historians of the Scotch nation. Without records, or even tra∣dition
itself, they give a long list of antient kings, and a detail of
their transactions, with a scrupulous exactness. One might natu∣rally
suppose, that, when they had no authentic annals, they
should, at least, have recourse to the traditions of their country,
and have reduced them into a regular system of history. Of both
they seem to have been equally destitute. Born in the low country,
and strangers to the antient language of their nation▪ they content∣ed
themselves with copying from one another, and retailing the
same fictions, in a new colour and dress.</P>
<P>JOHN FORDUN was the first who collected those fragments of the
Scotch history, which had escaped the brutal policy of Edward I. and
reduced them into order. His accounts, in so far as they concerned
recent transactions, deserved credit: beyond a certain period, they
were fabulous and unsatisfactory. Some time before Fordun wrote,
the king of England, in a letter to the pope, had run up the antiquity
of his nation to a very remote aera. Fordun, possessed of all the national
prejudice of the age, was unwilling that his country should yield,
in point of antiquity, to a people, then its rivals and enemies.
Destitute of annals in Scotland, he had recourse to Ireland, which,
according to the vulgar errors of the times, was reckoned the first
habitation of the Scots. He found, there, that the Irish bards had
carried their pretensions to antiquity as high, if not beyond any
nation in Europe. It was from them he took those improbable
fictions, which form the first part of his history.</P>
<P>THE writers that succeeded Fordun implicitly followed his sys∣tem,
tho' they sometimes varied from him in their relations of par∣ticular
transactions, and the order of succession of their kings.
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
As they had no new lights, and were, equally with him, unac∣quainted
with the traditions of their country, their histories contain
little information concerning the origin of the Scots. Even Bu∣chanan
himself, except the elegance and vigour of his stile, has
very little to recommend him. Blinded with political prejudices,
he seemed more anxious to turn the fictions of his predecessors to
his own purposes, than to detect their misrepresentations, or inves∣tigate
truth amidst the darkness which they had thrown round it.
It therefore appears, that little can be collected from their own his∣torians,
concerning the first migration of the Scots into Britain.</P>
<P>THAT this island was peopled from Gaul admits of no doubt.
Whether colonies came afterwards from the north of Europe is a
matter of mere speculation. When South-Britain yielded to the
power of the Romans, the unconquered nations to the north of the
province were distinguished by the name of <HI>Caledonians.</HI> From
their very name, it appears, that they were of those <HI>Celts,</HI> or
<HI>Gauls,</HI> who possessed themselves originally of Britain. It is com∣pounded
of two <HI>Celtic</HI> words, <HI>Caël</HI> signifying <HI>Celts,</HI> or <HI>Gauls,</HI> and
<HI>Dun</HI> or <HI>Don, a hill;</HI> so that <HI>Caël-don,</HI> or Caledonians, is as much
as to say, the <HI>Celts of the hill country.</HI> The Highlanders, to this
day, call themselves <HI>Caël,</HI> and their language <HI>Caëlic,</HI> or <HI>Galic.</HI>
This, of itself, is sufficient to demonstrate, that they are the ge∣nuine
descendents of the antient Caledonians, and not a pretended
colony of <HI>Scots,</HI> who settled first in the north, in the third or
fourth century.</P>
<P>FROM the double meaning of the word <HI>Caël,</HI> which signifies
<HI>strangers,</HI> as well as <HI>Gauls,</HI> or <HI>Celts,</HI> some have imagined, that the
ancestors of the Caledonians were of a different race from the rest
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
of the Britons, and that they received their name upon that ac∣count.
This opinion, say they, is supported by Tacitus, who,
from several circumstances, concludes, that the Caledonians were of
German extraction. A discussion of a point so intricate, at this
distance of time, could neither be satisfactory nor important.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the latter end of the third, and beginning of the
fourth century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Hierom. ad Ctesiphon.</NOTE> we meet with the <HI>Scots</HI> in the north. Porphyrius
makes the first mention of them about that time. As the <HI>Scots</HI>
were not heard of before that period, most writers supposed them
to have been a colony, newly come to Britain, and that the <HI>Picts</HI>
were the only genuine descendents of the antient Caledonians.
This mistake is easily removed. The Caledonians, in process of
time, became naturally divided into two distinct nations, as pos∣sessing
parts of the country, intirely different in their nature
and soil. The western coast of Scotland is hilly and barren; to∣wards
the east the country is plain, and fit for tillage. The inhabi∣tants
of the mountains, a roving and uncontrouled race of men,
lived by feeding of cattle, and what they killed in hunting.
Their employment did not fix them to one place. They removed
from one heath to another, as suited best with their convenience
or inclination. They were not, therefore, improperly called, by
their neighbours, SCUITE, or, <HI>the wandering nation;</HI> which is evi∣dently
the origin of the Roman name of <HI>Scoti.</HI></P>
<P>ON the other hand, the Caledonians, who possessed the east coast
of Scotland, as their division of the country was plain and fertile,
applied themselves to agriculture, and raising of corn. It was
from this, that the Galic name of the <HI>Picts</HI> proceeded; for they
are called, in that language, <HI>Cruithuich,</HI> i. e. <HI>the wheat or corn∣eaters.</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
As the Picts lived in a country so different in its nature
from that possessed by the Scots, so their national character suffered
a material change. Unobstructed by mountains, or lakes, their
communication with one another was free and frequent. Society,
therefore, became sooner established among them, than among the
Scots, and, consequently, they were much sooner governed by civil
magistrates and laws. This, at last, produced so great a difference
in the manners of the two nations, that they began to forget their
common origin, and almost continual quarrels and animosities sub∣sisted
between them. These animosities, after some ages, ended in
the subversion of the Pictish kingdom, but not in the total extirpa∣tion
of the nation, according to most of the Scotch writers, who
seemed to think it more for the honour of their countrymen to
annihilate, than reduce a rival people under their obedience. It is
certain, however, that the very name of the Picts was lost, and
those that remained were so compleatly incorporated with their
conquerors, that they soon lost all memory of their own origin.—</P>
<P>THE end of the Pictish government is placed so near that period,
to which authentic annals reach, that it is matter of wonder, that
we have no monuments of their language or history remaining.
This favours the system I have laid down. Had they originally
been of a different race from the Scots, their language of course
would be different. The contrary is the case. The names of places
in the Pictish dominions, and the very names of their kings, which
are handed down to us, are of Galic original, which is a convincing
proof, that the two nations were, of old, one and the same, and
only divided into two governments, by the effect which their situa∣tion
had upon the genius of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
THE name of <HI>Picts</HI> was, perhaps, given by the Romans to the
Caledonians, who possessed the east coast of Scotland, from their
painting their bodies. This circumstance made some imagine, that
the Picts were of British extract, and a different race of men from the
Scots. That more of the Britons, who fled northward from the tyranny
of the Romans, settled in the low country of Scotland, than among the
Scots of the mountains, may be easily imagined, from the very nature
of the country. It was they who introduced painting among the Picts.
From this circumstance proceeded the name of the latter, to distin∣guish
them from the Scots, who never had that art among them, and
from the Britons, who discontinued it after the Roman conquest.</P>
<P>THE Caledonians, most certainly, acquired a considerable know∣ledge
in navigation, by their living on a coast intersected with ma∣ny
arms of the sea, and, in islands, divided, one from another, by
wide and dangerous firths. It is, therefore, highly probable, that
they, very early, found their way to the north of Ireland, which
is within sight of their own country. That Ireland was first
peopled from Britain is certain. The vicinity of the two islands;
the exact correspondence of the antient inhabitants of both, in
point of manners and language, are sufficient proofs, even if we
had not the testimony of authors of undoubted veracity to confirm
it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dio. Sic. l. 5.</NOTE> The abettors of the most romantic systems of Irish antiquities
allow it; but they place the colony from Britain in an improbable
and remote aera. I shall easily admit, that the colony of the <HI>Fir∣bolg,</HI>
confessedly the <HI>Belgae</HI> of Britain, settled in the south of Ire∣land,
before the <HI>Caël,</HI> or Caledonians, discovered the north: but it
is not at all likely, that the migration of the Firbolg to Ireland
happened many centuries before the incarnation.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
OSSIAN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temora, Book II.</NOTE> in the poem of Temora, throws considerable light
on this subject. His accounts agree so well with what the antients
have delivered, concerning the first population and inhabitants of
Ireland, that every unbiassed person will confess them more probable,
than the legends handed down, by tradition, in that country.
From him, it appears, that, in the days of Trathal, grandfather to
Fingal, Ireland was possessed by two nations; the <HI>Firbolg</HI> or <HI>Belgae</HI>
of Britain, who inhabited the south, and the <HI>Caël,</HI> who passed over
from Caledonia and the Hebrides to Ulster. The two nations, as
is usual among an unpolished and lately settled people, were di∣vided
into small dynasties, subject to petty kings, or chiefs, inde∣pendent
of one another. In this situation, it is probable, they
continued long, without any material revolution in the state of the
island, until Crothar, Lord of Atha, a country in Connaught, the
most potent chief of the <HI>Firbolg,</HI> carried away Conlama, the daugh∣ter
of Cathmin, a chief of the <HI>Cael,</HI> who possessed Ulster.</P>
<P>CONLAMA had been betrothed, some time before, to Turloch, a
cheif of her own nation. Turloch resented the affront offered him by
Crothar, made an irruption into Connaught, and killed Cormul, the
brother of Crothar, who came to oppose his progress. Crothar
himself then took arms, and either killed or expelled Turloch.
The war, upon this, became general, between the two nations:
and the Caël were reduced to the last extremity.—In this situation,
they applied, for aid, to Trathal king of Morven, who sent his
brother Conar, already famous for his great exploits, to their relief.
Conar, upon his arrival in Ulster, was chosen king, by the unani∣mous
consent of the Caledonian tribes, who possessed that coun∣try.
The war was renewed with vigour and success; but the <HI>Fir∣bolg</HI>
appear to have been rather repelled than subdued. In su∣ceeding
<PB N="ix" REF="11"/>
reigns, we learn from episodes in the same poem, that the
chiefs of Atha made several efforts to become monarchs of Ireland,
and to expel the race of Conar.</P>
<P>To Conar succeeded his son Cormac,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book III.</NOTE> who appears to have reign∣ed
long. In his latter days he seems to have been driven to the
last extremity, by an insurrection of the <HI>Firbolg,</HI> who supported the
pretensions of the chiefs of Atha to the Irish throne. Fingal, who
then was very young, came to the aid of Cormac, totally defeated
Colc-ulla,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book IV.</NOTE> chief of Atha, and re-established Cormac in the sole
possession of all Ireland. It was then he fell in love with, and took
to wife, Ros-crana, the daughter of Cormac, who was the mother
of Ossian.</P>
<P>CORMAC was succeeded in the Irish throne by his son, Cairbre;
Cairbre by Artho, his Son, who was the father of that Cormac, in
whose minority the invasion of Swaran happened, which is the sub∣ject
of the poem of <HI>Fingal.</HI> The family of Atha, who had not
relinquished their pretensions to the Irish throne, rebelled in the mi∣nority
of Cormac,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book I.</NOTE> defeated his adherents, and murdered him in the
palace of Temora. Cairbar, lord of Atha, upon this, mounted
the throne. His usurpation soon ended with his life; for Fingal
made an expedition into Ireland, and restored, after various vicissi∣tudes
of fortune, the family of Conar to the possession of the king∣dom.
This war is the subject of Temora; the events, tho' cer∣tainly
heightened and embellished by poetry, seem, notwithstand∣ing,
to have their foundation in true history.</P>
<P>OSSIAN has not only preserved the history of the first migration
of the Caledonians into Ireland, he has also delivered some impor∣tant
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
facts, concerning the first settlement of the <HI>Firbolg,</HI> or <HI>Belgae of
Britain,</HI> in that kingdom, under their leader Larthon, who was an∣cestor
to Cairbar and Cathmor, who, successively, mounted the Irish
throne, after the death of Cormac, the son of Artho. I forbear to
transcribe the passage, on account of its length. It is the song of
Fonar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book VII.</NOTE> the bard; towards the latter end of the seventh book of
Temora. As the generations from Larthon to Cathmor, to whom
the episode is addressed, are not marked, as are those of the family
of Conar, the first king of Ireland, we can form no judgment
of the time of the settlement of the Firbolg. It is, however,
probable, it was some time before the <HI>Caël,</HI> or Caledonians, settled
in Ulster.—One important fact may be gathered from this history
of Ossian, that the Irish had no king before the latter end of the
first century. Fingal lived, it is certain, in the third century; so
Conar, the first monarch of the Irish, who was his grand-uncle,
cannot be placed farther back than the close of the first. The esta∣blishing
of this fact, lays, at once, aside the pretended antiquities
of the Scotch and Irish, and cuts off the long list of kings which
the latter give us for a millennium before.</P>
<P>OF the affairs of Scotland, it is certain, nothing can be depended
upon, prior to the reign of Fergus, the son of Erc, who lived in
the fifth century. The true history of Ireland begins somewhat
later than that period.<NOTE PLACE="marg">War. de an∣tiq. Hybern. prae. p. 1.</NOTE> Sir James Ware, who was indefatigable in
his researches after the antiquities of his country, rejects, as mere
fiction and idle romance, all that is related of the antient Irish,
before the time of St. Patrick, and the reign of Leogairc. It is
from this consideration, that he begins his history at the introduc∣tion
of christianity, remarking, that all that is delivered down,
concerning the times of paganism, were tales of late invention,
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>
strangely mixed with anachronisms and inconsistencies. Such being
the opinion of Ware, who had collected, with uncommon industry
and zeal, all the real and pretendedly antient manuscripts, concern∣ing
the history of his country, we may, on his authority, reject the
improbable and self-condemned tales of Keating and O'Flaherty.
Credulous and puerile to the last degree, they have disgraced the
antiquities they meant to establish. It is to be wished, that some
able Irishman, who understands the language and records of his
country, may redeem, ere it is too late, the genuine antiquities of
Ireland, from the hands of these idle fabulists.</P>
<P>BY comparing the history preserved by Ossian with the legends of
the Scotch and Irish writers, and, by afterwards examining both by
the test of the Roman authors, it is easy to discover which is the
most probable. Probability is all that can be established on the au∣thority
of tradition, ever dubious and uncertain. But when it fa∣vours
the hypothesis laid down by cotemporary writers of undoubted
veracity, and, as it were, finishes the figure of which they only
drew the out-lines, it ought, in the judgment of sober reason, to
be preferred to accounts framed in dark and distant periods, with
little judgment, and upon no authority.</P>
<P>CONCERNING the period of more than a century, which inter∣venes
between Fingal and the reign of Fergus, the son of Erc or
Arcath, tradition is dark and contradictory. Some trace up the fa∣mily
of Fergus to a son of Fingal of that name, who makes a
considerable figure in Ossian's poems. The three elder sons of Fin∣gal,
Ossian, Fillan, and Ryno, dying, without issue, the succession,
of course, devolved upon Fergus, the fourth son and his posterity.
This Fergus, say some traditions, was the father of Congal, whose
<PB N="xii" REF="14"/>
son was Arcath, the father of Fergus, properly called the first king of
Scots, as it was in his time the <HI>Caël,</HI> who possessed the western
coast of Scotland, began to be distinguished, by foreigners, by the
name of <HI>Scots.</HI> From thence forward, the Scots and Picts, as dis∣tinct
nations, became objects of attention to the historians of other
countries. The internal state of the two Caledonian kingdoms
has always continued, and ever must remain, in obscurity and fable.</P>
<P>IT is in this epoch we must fix the beginning of the decay of
that species of heroism, which subsisted in the days of Ossian.
There are three stages in human society. The first is the result of
consanguinity, and the natural affection of the members of a fa∣mily
to one another. The second begins when property is esta∣blished,
and men enter into associations for mutual defence, against
the invasions and injustice of neighbours. Mankind submit, in the
third, to certain laws and subordinations of government, to which
they trust the safety of their persons and property. As the first is
formed on nature, so, of course, it is the most disinterested
and noble. Men, in the last, have leisure to cultivate the mind,
and to restore it, with reflection, to a primaeval dignity of senti∣ment.
The middle state is the region of compleat barbarism and
ignorance. About the beginning of the fifth century, the Scots
and Picts were advanced into the second stage, and, consequently,
into those circumscribed sentiments, which always distinguish bar∣barity.—The
events which soon after happened did not at all con∣tribute
to enlarge their ideas, or mend their national character.</P>
<P>ABOUT the year 426, the Romans, on account of domes∣tic
commotions, entirely forsook Britain, finding it impossible to
defend so distant a frontier. The Picts Scots, seizing this fa∣vourable
<PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>
opportunity, made incursions into the deserted province.
The Britons, enervated by the slavery of several centuries, and those
vices, which are inseparable from an advanced state of civility, were
not able to withstand the impetuous, tho' irregular attacks of a bar∣barous
enemy. In the utmost distress, they applied to their old
masters, the Romans, and (after the unfortunate state of the Em∣pire
could not spare aid) to the Saxons, a nation equally barbarous
and brave, with the enemies of whom they were so much afraid.
Tho' the bravery of the Saxons repelled the Caledonian nations for
a time, yet the latter found means to extend themselves, consider∣ably,
towards the South. It is, in this period, we must place the
origin of the arts of civil life among the Scots. The seat of go∣vernment
was removed from the mountains to the plain and more
fertile provinces of the South, to be near the common enemy, in
case of sudden incursions. Instead of roving thro' unfrequented
wilds, in search of subsistance, by means of hunting, men applied
to agriculture, and raising of corn. This manner of life was the
first means of changing the national character.—The next thing
which contributed to it was their mixture with strangers.</P>
<P>IN the countries which the Scots had conquered from the Bri∣tons,
it is probable the most of the old inhabitants remained.
These, incorporating with the conquerors, taught them agriculture,
and other arts, which they themselves had received from the Ro∣mans.
The Scots, however, in number as well as power, being the
most predominant, retained still their language, and as many of
the customs of their ancestors, as suited with the nature of the
country they possessed. Even the union of the two Caledonian
kingdoms did not much affect the national character. Being ori∣ginally
descended from the same stock, the manners of the Picts and
<PB N="xiv" REF="16"/>
Scots were as similar as the different natures of the countries they
possessed permitted.</P>
<P>WHAT brought about a total change in the genius of the Scots
nation, was their wars, and other transactions with the Saxons.
Several counties in the south of Scotland were alternately possessed
by the two nations. They were ceded, in the ninth age, to the
Scots, and, it is probable, that most of the Saxon inhabitants re∣mained
in possession of their lands. During the several conquests
and revolutions in England, many fled, for refuge, into Scotland, to
avoid the oppression of foreigners, or the tyranny of domestic usurp∣ers;
in so much, that the Saxon race formed perhaps near one half
of the Scottish kingdom. The Saxon manners and language daily
gained ground, on the tongue and customs of the antient Caledoni∣ans,
till, at last, the latter were entirely relegated to inhabitants
of the mountains, who were still unmixed with strangers.</P>
<P>IT was after the accession of territory which the Scots received,
upon the retreat of the Romans from Britain, that the inhabitants
of the Highlands were divided into clans. The king, when he
kept his court in the mountains, was considered, by the whole na∣tion,
as the chief of their blood. Their small number, as well as
the presence of their prince, prevented those divisions, which, af∣terwards,
sprung forth into so many separate tribes. When the
seat of government was removed to the south, those who remain∣ed
in the Highlands were, of course, neglected. They naturally
formed themselves into small societies, independent of one another.
Each society had its own <HI>reg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> who either was, or, in the suc∣cession
of a few generations, was regarded as chief of their blood.—The
nature of the country favoured an institution of this sort.
<PB N="xv" REF="17"/>
A few valleys, divided from one another by extensive heaths and
impassible mountains, form the face of the Highlands. In these
valleys the chiefs fixed their residence. Round them, and almost
within sight of their dwellings, were the habitations of their re∣lations
and dependents.</P>
<P>THE seats of the Highland chiefs were neither disagreeable nor
inconvenient. Surrounded with mountains and hanging woods,
they were covered from the inclemency of the weather. Near them
generally ran a pretty large river, which, discharging itself, not far
off, into an arm of the sea, or extensive lake, swarmed with va∣riety
of fish. The woods were stocked with wild-fowl; and the
heaths and mountains behind them were the natural seat of the red∣deer
and roe. If we make allowance for the backward state of agri∣culture,
the valleys were not unfertile; affording, if not all the
conveniences, at least the necessaries of life. Here the chief lived,
the supreme judge and law-giver of his own people; but his sway
was neither severe nor unjust. As the populace regarded him as the
chief of their blood, so he, in return, considered them as members
of his family. His commands, therefore, tho' absolute and deci∣sive,
partook more of the authority of a father, than of the rigor of
a judge.—Tho' the whole territory of the tribe was considered as
the property of the chief, yet his vassals made him no other consi∣deration
for their lands than services, neither burdensome nor fre∣quent.
As he seldom went from home, he was at no expence.
His table was supplied by his own herds, and what his numerous
attendants killed in hunting.</P>
<P>IN this rural kind of magnificence, the Highland chiefs lived, for
may ages. At a distance from the seat of government, and se∣cured,
<PB N="xvi" REF="18"/>
by the inaccessibleness of their country, they were free and
independent. As they had little communication with strangers, the
customs of their ancestors remained among them, and their lan∣guage
retained its original purity. Naturally fond of military fame,
and remarkably attached to the memory of their ancestors, they
delighted in traditions and songs, concerning the exploits of their
nation, and especially of their own particular families. A succession
of bards was retained in every clan, to hand down the memorable
actions of their forefathers. As the aera of Fingal, on account of
Ossian's poems, was the most remarkable, and his chiefs the most
renowned names in tradition, the bards took care to place one of
them in the genealogy of every great family.—That part of the
poems, which concerned the hero who was regarded as ancestor,
was preserved, as an authentic record of the antiquity of the fami∣ly,
and was delivered down, from race to race, with wonderful ex∣actness.</P>
<P>THE bards themselves, in the mean time, were not idle. They
erected their immediate patrons into heroes, and celebrated them in
their songs. As the circle of their knowledge was narrow, their
ideas were confined in proportion. A few happy expressions, and
the manners they represent, may please those who understand the
language; their obscurity and innacuracy would disgust in a tran∣slation.—It
was chiefly, for this reason, that I kept wholly to the
compositions of Ossian, in my former and present publication. As
he acted in a more extensive sphere, his ideas are more noble and
universal; neither has he so many of those peculiarities, which are
only understood in a certain period or country. The other bards
have their beauties, but not in that species of composition in which
Ossian excels. Their rhimes, only calculated to kindle a martial
<PB N="xvii" REF="19"/>
spirit among the vulgar, afford very little pleasure to genuine taste.
This observation only regards their poems of the heroic kind; in
every other species of poetry they are more successful. They ex∣press
the tender melancholy of desponding love, with irresistible sim∣plicity
and nature. So well adapted are the sounds of the words to
the sentiments, that, even without any knowledge of the language,
they pierce and dissolve the heart. Successful love is expressed with
peculiar tenderness and elegance. In all their compositions, except
the heroic, which was solely calculated to animate the vulgar, they
give us the genuine language of the heart, without any of those
affected ornaments of phraseology, which, tho'intended to beautify
sentiments, divest them of their natural force. The ideas, it is
confessed, are too local, to be admired, in another language; to
those, who are acquainted with the manners they represent, and the
scenes they describe, they must afford the highest pleasure and sa∣tisfaction.</P>
<P>IT was the locality of his description and sentiment, that, pro∣bably,
kept Ossian so long in the obscurity of an almost lost lan∣guage.
His ideas, tho' remarkably proper for the times in which
he lived, are so contrary to the present advanced state of society,
that more than a common mediocrity of taste is required, to
relish his poems as they deserve.—Those who alone were capable
to make a translation were, no doubt, conscious of this, and chose
rather to admire their poet in secret, than see him received, with
coldness, in an English dress.</P>
<P>THESE were long my own sentiments, and, accordingly, my first
translations, from the Galic, were merely accidental. The publi∣cation,
which soon after followed, was so well received, that I was
<PB N="xviii" REF="20"/>
obliged to promise to my friends a larger collection. In a journey
thro' the Highlands and isles, and, by the assistance of correspon∣dents,
since I left that country, all the genuine remains of the
works of Ossian have come to my hands. In the publication of
last year compleat poems were only given. Unfinished and imper∣fect
poems were purposely omitted; even some pieces were rejected,
on account of their length, and others, that they might not break
in upon that thread of connection, which subsists in the lesser
compositions, subjoined to <HI>Fingal.</HI>—That the comparative merit of
pieces was not regarded, in the selection, will readily appear to those
who shall read, attentively, the present collection.—It is ani∣mated
with the same spirit of poetry, and the same strength of
sentiment is sustained throughout.</P>
<P>THE opening of the poem of Temora made its appearance in the
last collection. The second book, and several other episodes, have
only fallen into my hands lately. The story of the poem, with
which I had been long acquainted, enabled me to reduce the broken
members of the piece into the order in which they now appear.
For the ease of the reader, I have divided it myself into books, as
I had done before with the poem of <HI>Fingal.</HI> As to the merit of
the poem I shall not anticipate the judgment of the public. My
impartiality might be suspected, in my accounts of a work, which,
in some measure, is become my own. If the poem of Fingal met
with the applause of persons of genuine taste, I should also hope,
that Temora will not displease them.</P>
<P>BUT what renders Temora infinitely more valuable than Fingal,
is the light it throws on the history of the times. The first po∣pulation
of Ireland, its first kings, and several circumstances, which
<PB N="xix" REF="21"/>
regard its connection of old with the south and north of Britain,
are presented to us, in several episodes. The subject and catastrophe
of the poem are founded upon facts, which reagarded the first
peopling of that country, and the contests between the two Bri∣tish
nations, which originally inhabited it.—In a preceding part of
this dissertation, I have shewn how superior the probability of Os∣sian's
traditions is to the undigested fictions of the Irish bards, and
the more recent and regular legends of both Irish and Scotch his∣torians.
I mean not to give offence to the abettors of the high
antiquities of the two nations, tho' I have all along expressed my
doubts, concerning the veracity and abilities of those who deliver
down their antient history. For my own part, I prefer the na∣tional
fame, arising from a few certain facts, to the legendary and
uncertain annals of ages of remote and obscure antiquity. No
kingdom, now established in Europe, can pretend to equal antiqui∣ty
with those of Ireland and Scotland, even according to my system,
so that it is altogether needless to fix their origin a fictitious millen∣nium
before. This subject I have only lightly touched upon, as it
is to be discussed, with more perspicuity, and at a much greater
length, by a gentleman, who has thoroughly examined the anti∣quities
of Britain and Ireland.</P>
<P>SINCE the publication of the last collection of Ossian's poems,
many insinuations have been made, and doubts arisen, concerning
their authenticity. I shall, probably, hear more of the same kind
after the present poems shall make their appearance. Whether
these suspicions are suggested by prejudice, or are only the effects of
ignorance of facts, I shall not pretend to determine.—To me they
give no concern, as I have it always in my power to remove them.
An incredulity of this kind is natural to persons, who consine all
<PB N="xx" REF="22"/>
merit to their own age and country. These are generally the weak∣est,
as well as the most ignorant, of the people. Indolently con∣fined
to a place, their ideas are narrow and circumscribed.—It is ri∣diculcus
enough to see such people as these are, branding their an∣cestors,
with the despicable appellation of barbarians. Sober rea∣son
can easily discern, where the title ought to be fixed, with more
propriety.</P>
<P>As prejudice is always the effect of ignorance, the knowing, the
men of true taste, despise and dismiss it. If the poetry is good,
and the characters natural and striking, to them it is a matter of
indifference, whether the heroes were born in the little village of
Angles in Juteland, or natives of the barren heaths of Caledonia.
That honour which nations derive from ancestors, worthy, or re∣nowned;
is merely ideal. It may buoy up the minds of individu∣als,
but it contributes very little to their importance in the eyes of
others.—But of all those prejudices which are incident to narrow
minds, that which measures the merit of performances by the vul∣gar
opinion, concerning the country which produced them, is cer∣tainly
the most ridiculous. Ridiculous, however, as it is, few have
the courage to reject it; and, I am thoroughly convinced, that a
few quaint lines of a Roman or Greek epigrammatist, if dug out of
the ruins of Herculaneum, would meet with more cordial and uni∣versal
applause, than all the most beautiful and natural rhapsodies of
all the Celtic bards and Scandinavian Scalders that ever existed.</P>
<P>WHILE some doubt the authenticity of the compositions of Ossian,
others strenuously endeavour to appropriate them to the Irish nation.
Tho' the whole tenor of the poems sufficiently contradict so absurd an
opinion, it may not be improper, for the satisfaction of some, to examine
the narrow foundation, on which this extraordinary claim is built.</P>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="23"/>
OF all the nations descended from the antient <HI>Celtae,</HI> the Scots
and Irish are the most similar in language, customs, and man∣ners.
This argues a more intimate connection between them,
than a remote descent from the great Celtic stock. It is evident,
in short, that, at some one period or other, they formed one
society, were subject to the same government, and were, in all
respects, one and the same people. How they became divided,
which the colony, or which the mother nation, does not fall now
to be discussed. The first circumstance that induced me to disregard
the vulgarly-received opinion of the Hibernian extraction of the
Scotch nation, was my observations on their antient language. That
dialect of the Celtic tongue, spoken in the north of Scotland, is
much more pure, more agreeable to its mother language, and more
abounding with primitives, than that now spoken, or even that
which has been writ for some centuries back, amongst the most un∣mixed
part of the Irish nation. A Scotchman, tolerably conversant
in his own language, understands an Irish composition, from that
derivative analogy which it has to the <HI>Galic</HI> of North-Britain. An
Irishman, on the other hand, without the aid of study, can never
understand a composition in the <HI>Galic</HI> tongue.—This affords a proof,
that the <HI>Scotch Galic</HI> is the most original, and, consequently, the
language of a more antient and unmixed people. The Irish, how∣ever
backward they may be to allow any thing to the prejudice of
their antiquity, seem inadvertently to acknowledge it, by the very
appellation they give to the dialect they speak.—They call their own
language <HI>Caëlic Eirinach,</HI> i. e. <HI>Caledonian Irish,</HI> when, on the con∣trary,
they call the dialect of North-Britain <HI>a Chaëlic,</HI> or the <HI>Cale∣donian
tongue,</HI> emphatically. A circumstance of this nature tends
more to decide which is the most antient nation, than the united
<PB N="xxii" REF="24"/>
testimonies of a whole legion of ignorant bards and senachies, who,
perhaps, never dreamed of bringing the Scots from Spain to Ire∣land,
till some one of them, more learned than the rest, discovered,
that the Romans called the first <HI>Iberia,</HI> and the latter <HI>Hibernia.</HI> On
such a slight foundation were probably built those romantic fictions,
concerning the Milesians of Ireland.</P>
<P>FROM internal proofs it sufficiently appears, that the poems pu∣blished
under the name of Ossian, are not of Irish composition.
The favourite chimaera, that Ireland is the mother-country of the
Scots, is totally subverted and ruined. The fictions, concerning the
antiquities of that country, which were forming for ages, and grow∣ing,
as they came down, on the hands of successive <HI>senachies</HI> and
<HI>fileas,</HI> are found, at last, to be the spurious brood of modern and
ignorant ages. To those who know how tenacious the Irish are, of
their pretended <HI>Iberian</HI> descent, this alone is proof sufficient, that
poems, so subversive of their system, could never be produced by
an Hibernian bard.—But when we look to the language, it is so
different from the Irish dialect, that it would be as ridiculous to
think, that Milton's Paradise Lost could be wrote by a Scotch pea∣sant,
as to suppose, that the poems ascribed to Ossian were writ in
Ireland.</P>
<P>THE pretensions of Ireland to Ossian proceed from another quar∣ter.
There are handed down, in that country, traditional poems,
concerning the <HI>Fiona,</HI> or the heroes of <HI>Fion Mac Comnal.</HI> This
<HI>Fion,</HI> say the Irish annalists, was general of the militia of Ireland,
in the reign of Cormac, in the third century. Where Keating and
O'Flaherty learned, that Ireland had an <HI>embodied</HI> militia so early, is
not easy for me to determine. Their information certainly did not
<PB N="xxiii" REF="25"/>
come from the Irish poems, concerning <HI>Fion.</HI> I have just now, in
my hands, all that remain, of those compositions; but, unluckily
for the antiquities of Ireland, they appear to be the work of a very
modern period. Every stanza, nay almost every line, affords strik∣ing
proofs, that they cannot be three centuries old. Their allu∣sions
to the manners and customs of the fifteenth century, are so
many, that it is matter of wonder to me, how any one could dream
of their antiquity. They are entirely writ in that romantic taste,
which prevailed two ages ago.—Giants, enchanted castles, dwarfs,
palfreys, witches and magicians form the whole circle of the
poet's invention. The celebrated <HI>Fion</HI> could scarcely move from one
hillock to another, without encountering a giant, or being entangled
in the circles of a magician. Witches, on broomsticks, were con∣tinually
hovering round him, like crows; and he had freed enchant∣ed
virgins in every valley in Ireland. In short, <HI>Fion,</HI> great as he
was, had but a bad sort of life of it.—Not only had he to engage
all the mischiefs in his own country, foreign armies invaded him,
assisted by magicians and witches, and headed by kings, as tall as
the main-mast of a first rate.—It must be owned, however, that
<HI>Fion</HI> was not inferior to them in height.</P>
<Q><L>A chos air <HI>Cromleach,</HI> druim-ard,</L>
<L>Chos eile air Crom-meal dubh,</L>
<L>Thoga <HI>Fion</HI> le lamh mhoir</L>
<L>An d'uisge <HI>o Lubhair</HI> na sruth.</L></Q>
<P>“<HI>Fion,</HI> says the Irish bard, sometimes placed one foot on the moun∣tain
<HI>Cromleach,</HI> his other foot on the hill of <HI>Crommal,</HI> and, in that
position, washed his hands, in the river <HI>Lubar,</HI> which ran thro' the
intermediate valley.” The property of such a monster as this <HI>Fion,</HI>
<PB N="xxiv" REF="26"/>
I should never have disputed with any nation. But the bard himself,
in the poem, from which the above quotation is taken, cedes him
to Scotland.
<Q><L>FION O ALBIN, siol nan laoich.</L>
<L><HI>FION</HI> from <HI>ALBION,</HI> race of heroes!</L></Q>
Were it allowable to contradict the authority of a bard, at this dis∣tance
of time, I should have given, as my opinion, that this enor∣mous
<HI>Fion</HI> was of the race of the Hibernian giants, of Ruanus, or
some other celebrated name, rather than a native of Caledonia,
whose inhabitants, now at least, are not remarkable for their sta∣ture.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Fion</HI> was so remarkable for his stature, his heroes had also
other extraordinary properties. <HI>In weight all the sons of strangers</HI> yield∣ed
to the celebrated Ton-iosal; and for hardness of skull, and, per∣haps,
for thickness too, the valiant Oscar stood <HI>unrivalled and alone.</HI>
Ossian himself had many singular and less delicate qualifications, than
playing on the harp; and the brave Cuchullin was of so diminutive
a size, as to be taken for a child of two years of age, by the gi∣gantic
Swaran. To illustrate this subject, I shall here lay before
the reader, the history of some of the Irish poems, concerning
<HI>Fion Mac Comnal.</HI> A translation of these pieces, if well executed,
might afford satisfaction to the public. But this ought to be the
work of a native of Ireland. To draw forth, from obscurity, the
poems of my own country, has afforded ample employment to me;
besides, I am too diffident of my own abilities, to undertake such a
work. A gentleman in Dublin accused me to the public, of com∣mitting
blunders and absurdities, in translating the language of my
<PB N="xxv" REF="27"/>
own country, and that before any translation of mine appeared<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Faulkner's Dublin Journal, of the 1st December, 1761, appeared the following Advertisement:</P>
<P>Speedily will be published, by a Gentleman of this kingdom, who hath been, for some time past, employed in translating and writing Historical Notes to
<Q>FINGAL, A POEM,</Q>
Originally wrote in the Irish or Erse language. In the preface to which, the translator, who is a perfect master of the Irish tongue, will give an account of the manners and customs of the antient Irish or Scotch; and, therefore, most humbly intreats the pub∣lic, to wait for his edition, which will appear in a short time, as he will set forth all the blunders and absurdities in the edition now printing in London, and shew the ig∣norance of the English translator, in his knowlege of Irish grammar, not understand∣ing any part of that accidence.</P></NOTE>.
How the gentleman came to see my blunders before I committed
them, is not easy to determine; if he did not conclude, that, as a
Scotsman, and, of course, descended of the Milesian race, I might
have committed some of those oversights, which, perhaps very un∣justly,
are said to be peculiar to them.</P>
<P>FROM the whole tenor of the Irish poems, concerning the <HI>Fiona,</HI>
it appears, that <HI>Fion Mac Comnal</HI> flourished in the reign of Cormac,
which is placed, by the universal consent of the senachies, in the
third century. They even fix the death of Fingal in the year 286,
yet his son Ossian is made cotemporary with St. Patrick, who
preached the gospel in Ireland about the middle of the fifth age.
Ossian, tho', at that time, he must have been two hundred and fif∣ty
years of age, had a daughter young enough to become wife to
the saint. On account of this family connection, <HI>Patrick of the
Psalms,</HI> for so the apostle of Ireland is emphatically called in the
poems, took great delight in the company of Ossian, and in hearing
<PB N="xxvi" REF="28"/>
the great actions of his family. The saint sometimes threw off the
austerity of his profession, drunk freely, and had his soul properly
warmed with wine, in order to hear, with becoming enthusiasm,
the poems of his father-in-law. One of the poems begins with this
piece of useful information.</P>
<Q><L>Lo don rabh PADRIC na mhúr,</L>
<L>Gun <HI>Sailm</HI> air uidh, ach a gól,</L>
<L>Ghluais é thigh <HI>Ossian</HI> mhic <HI>Fhion,</HI></L>
<L>O san leis bu bhinn a ghloir.</L></Q>
<P>The title of this poem is, <HI>Teantach mor na Fiona.</HI> It appears to
have been founded on the same story with the <HI>battle of Lora,</HI> one of
the poems of the genuine Ossian. The circumstances and cata∣strophe
in both are much the same; but the <HI>Irish Ossian</HI> discovers
the age in which he lived, by an unlucky anachronism. After de∣scribing
the total route of Erragon, he very gravely concludes with
this remarkable anecdote, that none of the foe escaped, but a few,
who were allowed to go on a pilgrimage to the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> This
circumstance fixes the date of the composition of the piece some
centuries after the famous croisade; for, it is evident, that the poet
thought the time of the croisade so antient, that he confounds it
with the age of Fingal.—Erragon, in the course of this poem, is
often called,
<Q><L>Riogh <HI>Lochlin</HI> an do shloigh,</L>
<L>King of Denmark of two nations,</L></Q>
which alludes to the union of the kingdoms of Norway and Den∣mark,
a circumstance which brings down the date of the piece to
<PB N="xxvii" REF="29"/>
an aera, not far remote. Modern, however, as this pretended Os∣sian
was, it is certain, he lived before the Irish had dreamded of ap∣propriating
<HI>Fion,</HI> or <HI>Fingal,</HI> to themselves. He concludes the poem,
with this reflection:
<Q><L>Na fagha se comhthróm nan n' arm,</L>
<L>Eragon Mac Annir nan lánn glas</L>
<L>'San n' ALBIN ni n' abairtair Triath</L>
<L>Agus ghlaoite an n'<HI>Fhiona</HI> as.</L></Q>
“Had Erragon, son of Annir of gleaming swords, avoided the
equal contest of arms (single combat) no chief should have after∣wards
been numbered in ALBION, and the heroes of Fion should
no more be named.”</P>
<P>THE next poem that falls under our observation is <HI>Cath-cabhra,</HI>
or, <HI>The death of Oscar.</HI> This piece is founded on the same story
which we have in the first book of Temora. So little thought the
author of <HI>Cath-cabhra</HI> of making Oscar his countryman, that, in
the course of two hundred lines, of which the poem consists, he
puts the following expression thrice in the mouth of the hero:
<Q><L>ALBIN an sa d' roina m' arach.—</L>
<L><HI>ALBION</HI> where I was born and bred.</L></Q>
The poem contains almost all the incidents in the first book of Te∣mora.
In one circumstance the bard differs materially from Ossian.
Oscar, after he was mortally wounded by Cairbar, was carried by
his people to a neighbouring hill, which commanded a prospect of
<PB N="xxviii" REF="30"/>
the sea. A fleet appeared at a distance, and the hero exclaims with
ioy,
<Q><L>Loingeas mo shean-athair at' án</L>
<L>'S iad a tiächd le cabhair chugain,</L>
<L>O ALBIN na n' ioma stuagh.</L></Q>
“It is the fleet of my grandfather, coming with aid to our field,
from ALBION of many waves!”—The testimony of this bard is
sufficient to confute the idle fictions of Keating and O'Flaherty;
for, tho' he is far from being antient, it is probable, he flourished
a full century before these historians.—He appears, however, to
have been a much better christian than chronologer; for <HI>Fion,</HI>
tho' he is placed two centuries before St. Patrick, very devoutly re∣commends
the soul of his grandson of his Redeemer.</P>
<P><HI>Duan a Gharibh Mac-Starn</HI> is another Irish poem in high repute.
The grandeur of its images, and its propriety of sentiment, might
have induced me to give a translation of it, had not I some expec∣tations
of seeing it in the collection of the Irish Ossian's poems,
promised, more than a year since, to the public. The author de∣scends
sometimes from the region of the sublime to low and inde∣cent
description; the last of which, the Irish translator, no doubt,
will choose to leave in the obscurity of the original.—In this piece
Cuchullin is used with very little ceremony, for he is oft called,
the <HI>dog of Tara,</HI> in the county of Meath. This severe title of the
<HI>redoubtable Cuchullin,</HI> the most renowned of Irish champions, pro∣ceeded
from the poet's ignorance of etymology. Cu, <HI>voice,</HI> or
<HI>commander,</HI> signifies also a <HI>dog.</HI> The poet chose the last, as the
most noble appellation for his hero.</P>
<P><PB N="xxix" REF="31"/>
THE subject of the poem is the same with that of the epic poem
of Fingal. <HI>Garibh Mac-Starn</HI> is the same with Ossian's Swaran,
the son of Starno. His single combats with, and his victory
over all the heroes of Ireland, excepting the <HI>celebrated dog of Tara'</HI>
i. e. Cuchullin, afford matter for two hundred lines of tolerable
poetry. <HI>Garibh</HI>'s progress in search of Cuchullin, and his intrigue
with the gigantic Emir-bragal, that hero's wife, enables the poet
to extend his piece to four hundred lines. This author, it is true,
makes Cuchullin a native of Ireland; the gigantic Emir-bragal he
calls, <HI>the guiding star of the women of Ireland.</HI> The property of
this enormous lady I shall not dispute with him, or any other. But,
as he speaks with great tenderness of the <HI>daughters of the convent,</HI>
and throws out some hints against the English nation, it is pro∣bable
he lived in too modern a period to be intimately acquainted
with the genealogy of Cuchullin.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Irish Ossian (for there were many, as appears from
their difference in language and sentiment) speaks very dogmati∣cally
of <HI>Fion Mac Comnal,</HI> as an Irishman. Little can be said for
the judgment of this poet, and less for his delicacy of sentiment.
The history of one of his episodes may, at once, stand as a speci∣men
of his want of both. Ireland, in the days of <HI>Fion,</HI> happened
to be threatned with an invasion, by three great potentates, the
kings of Lochlin, Sweden, and France. It is needless to insist up∣on
the impropriety of a French invasion of Ireland; it is sufficient
for me to be faithful to the language of my author. <HI>Fion,</HI> upon
receiving intelligence of the intended invasion, sent Ca-olt, Ossian,
and Oscar, to watch the bay, in which, it was apprehended, the
enemy was to land. Oscar was the worst choice of a scout that
could be made, for, brave as he was, he had the bad property of
falling very often asleep on his post, nor was it possible to awake
<PB N="xxx" REF="32"/>
him, without cutting off one of his fingers, or dashing a large
stone against his head. When the enemy appeared, Oscar, very
unfortunately, was asleep. Ossian and Ca-olt consulted about the
method of wakening him, and they, at last, fixed on the stone, as
the less dangerous expendient.</P>
<Q><L>Gun thog Caoilte a chlach, nach gán,</L>
<L>Agus a n' aighai' chiean gun bhuail;</L>
<L>Tri mil an tulloch gun chri', &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>“Ca-olt took up a heavy stone, and struck it against the hero's
head. The hill shook for three miles, as the stone rebounded and
rolled away.” Oscar rose in wrath, and his father gravely desired
him to spend his rage on his enemies, which he did to so good pur∣pose,
that he singly routed a whole wing of their army. The con∣federate
kings advanced, notwithstanding, till they came to a narrow
pass, possessed by the celebrated Ton-iosal. This name is very sig∣nificant
of the singular property of the hero who bore it. Ton∣iosal,
tho' brave, was so heavy and unwieldy, that, when he sat
down, it took the whole force of an hundred men to set him up∣right
on his feet again. Luckily for the preservation of Ireland, the
hero happened to be standing when the enemy appeared, and he
gave so good an account of them, that <HI>Fion,</HI> upon his arrival, found
little to do, but to divide the spoil among his soldiers.</P>
<P>ALL these extraordinary heroes, Fion, Ossian, Oscar and Ca∣olt,
says the poet, were
<Q><L>Siol ERIN na gorm lánn.</L>
<L>The sons of <HI>ERIN</HI> of blue steel.</L></Q>
<PB N="xxxi" REF="33"/>
Neither shall I much dispute the matter with him: He has my
consent also to appropriate to Ireland the celebrated Ton-iosal. I
shall only say, that they are different persons from those of the
same name, in the Scotch poems; and that, tho' the stupenduous
valour of the first is so remarkable, they have not been equally
lucky with the latter, in their poet. It is somewhat extraordinary,
that <HI>Fion,</HI> who lived some ages before St. Patrick, swears like a
very good christian:
<Q><L>Air an Dia do chum gach <HI>case.</HI></L>
<L>By God, who shaped every case.</L></Q>
It is worthy of being remarked, that, in the line quoted, Ossian,
who lived in St. Patrick's days, seems to have understood something
of the English, a language not then subsisting. A person, more
sanguine for the honour of his country than I am, might argue,
from this circumstance, that this pretendedly Irish Ossian was a
native of Scotland; for my countrymen are universally allowed
to have an exclusive right to the second-sight.</P>
<P>FROM the instances given, the reader may form a compleat idea
of the Irish compositions concerning the <HI>Fiona.</HI> The greatest part
of them make the heroes of <HI>Fion,</HI>
<Q><L>Siol ALBIN a n'nioma caoile.</L>
<L>The race of <HI>ALBION</HI> of many firths.</L></Q>
The rest make them natives of Ireland. But, the truth is, that
their authority is of little consequence on either side. From the in∣stances
I have given, they appear to have been the work of a very
<PB N="xxxii" REF="34"/>
modern period. The pious ejaculations they contain, their allusions
to the manners of the times, fix them to the fifteenth century.
Had even the authors of these pieces avoided all allusions to their
own times, it is impossible that the poems could pass for ancient, in
the eyes of any person tolerably conversant with the Irish tongue.
The idiom is so corrupted and so many words borrowed from the
English, that that language must have made considerable progress in
Ireland before the poems were writ.</P>
<P>IT remains now to shew, how the Irish bards begun to appropri∣ate
Ossian and his heroes to their own country. After the English
conquest, many of the natives of Ireland, averse to foreign yoke,
either actually were in a state of hostility with the conquerors, or at
least, paid little regard to their government. The Scots, in those
ages, were often in open war, and never in cordial friendship with
the English. The similarity of manners and language, the tradi∣ons
concerning their common origin, and above all, their having to
do with the same enemy, created a free and friendly intercourse be∣tween
the Scotch and Irish nations. As the custom of retaining
bards and senachies was common to both; so each, no doubt, had
formed a system of history, it matters not how much soever fabalous,
concerning their respective origin. It was the natural policy of the
times, to reconcile the traditions of both nations together, and, if
possible, to deduce them from the same original stock.</P>
<P>The Saxon manners and language had, at that time, made great pro∣gress
in the south of Scotland. The ancient language, and the tradi∣tional
history of the nation, became confined entirely to the inhabitants
of the Highlands, then fallen, from several concurring circumstances,
into the last degree of ignorance and barbarism. The Irish, who,
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="35"/>
for some ages before the conquest, had possessed a competent share
of that kind of learning, which then prevailed in Europe, found it
no difficult matter to impose their own fictions on the ignorant
Highland senachies. By flattering the vanity of the Highlanders,
with their long list of Heremonian kings and heroes, they, without
contradiction, assumed to themselves the character of being the mo∣ther-nation
of the Scots of Britain. At this time, certainly, was esta∣blished
that Hibernian system of the original of the Scots, which af∣terwards,
for want of any other, was universally received. The Scots, of
the low-country, who, by losing the language of their ancestors, lost,
together with it, their national traditions, received, implicitly, the
history of their country, from Irish refugees, or from Highland sena∣chies,
persuaded over into the Hibernian system.</P>
<P>THESE circumstances, are far from being ideal. We have re∣maining
many particular traditions, which bear testimony to a fact,
of itself abundantly probable. What makes the matter incontestible
is, that the antient traditional accounts of the genuine origin of the
Scots, have been handed down without interruption. Tho' a few
ignorant senachies might be persuaded out of their own opinion, by
the smoothness of an Irish tale, it was impossible to eradicate, from
among the bulk of the people, their own national traditions. These
traditions afterwards so much prevailed, that the Highlanders con∣tinue
totally unacquainted with the pretended Hibernian extract of
the Scots nation. Ignorant chronicle writers, strangers to the an∣tient
language of their country, preserved only from falling to the
ground, so improbable a story.</P>
<P>IT was, during the period I have mentioned, that the irish be∣came
acquainted with, and carried into their country, the composi∣tions
of Ossian. The seene of many of the pieces being in Ireland,
suggested first to them a hint, of making both heroes and poet na∣tives
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="36"/>
of that Island. In order to do this effectually, they found it
necessary, to reject the genuine poems, as every line was pregnant
with proofs of their Scotch original, and to dress up a fable, on the
same subject, in their own language. So ill qualified, however, were
their bards to effectuate this change, that amidst all their desires to
make the <HI>Fiona</HI> Irishmen, they every now and then call <HI>Siol Albin.</HI> It
was, probably, after a succession of some generations, that the
bards had effrontery enough to establish an Irish genealogy for <HI>Fion,</HI>
and deduce him from the Milesian race of kings. In some of the
oldest Irish poems, on the subject, the great-grand-father of <HI>Fion</HI> is
made a Scandinavian; and his heroes are often called SIOL LOCHLIN
NA DEUM; <HI>i. e. the race of Lochlin of wounds.</HI> The only poem
that runs up the family of <HI>Fion</HI> to Nuades Niveus, king of Ireland, is
evidently not above a hundred and fifty years old; for, if I mistake
not, it mentions the Earl of Tyrone, so famous in Elizabeth's time.</P>
<P>THIS subject, perhaps, is pursued further than it deserves;
but, a discussion of the pretensions of Ireland to Ossian, was become
in some measure necessary. If the Irish poems, concerning the <HI>Fi∣ona,</HI>
should appear ridiculous, it is but justice to observe, that they
are scarcely more so than the poems of other nations, at that period.
On other subjects, the bards of Ireland have displayed a genius worthy
of any age or nation. It was, alone, in matters of antiquity, that
they were monstrous in their fables. Their love-sonnets, and their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egies on the death of persons worthy or renowned, abound with
such beautiful simplicity of sentiment, and wild harmony of num∣bers,
that they become more than an attonement for their errors, in
every other species of poetry. But the beauty of these pieces, depend
so much on a certain <HI>curiosa selicitas</HI> of expression in the original,
that they must app<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar much to disadvantage in another language.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q><P>CAIRBAR, the son of Borbar-duthul, lord of Atha in Connaught, the most potent
chief of the race of the Firbolg, having murdered, at Temora the royal palace,
Cormac the son of Artho, the young king of Ireland, usurped the throne. Cormac
was lineally descended from Conar the fon of Trenmor, the great grandfather of
Fingal, king of those Caledonians who inhabited the western coast of Scotland.
Fingal resented the behaviour of Cairbar, and resolved to pass over into Ireland, with
an army, to re-establish the royal family on the Irish throne. Early intelligence of
his designs coming to Cairbar, he assembled some of his tribes in Ulster, and at the
same time ordered his brother Cathmor to follow him speedily with an army, from
Temora. Such was the situation of affairs when the Caledonian fleet appeared on
the coast of Ulster.</P>
<P>THE poem opens in the morning. Cairbar is represented as retired from the rest
of the army, when one of his scouts brought him news of the landing of Fingal.
He assembles a council of his chiefs. Foldath the chief of Moma haughtily despises
the enemy; and is reprimanded warmly by Malthos. Cairbar, after hearing their
debate, orders a feast to be prepared, to which, by his bard Olla, he invites Oscar
the son of Ossian; resolving to pick a quarrel with that hero, and so have some pre∣text
for killing him. Oscar came to the feast; the quarrel happened; the followers
of both fought, and Cairbar and Oscar fell by mutual wounds. The noise of the
battle reached Fingal's army. The king came on, to the relief of Oscar, and the
Irish fell back to the army of Cathmor, who was advanced to the banks of the river.
Lubar, on the heath of Moilena. Fingal, after mourning over his grandson, or∣dered
Ullin the chief of his bards to carry his body to Morven, to be there interred.
Night coming on, Althan, the son of Conachar, relates to the king the particulars
of the murder of Cormac. Fillan, the son of Fingal, is sent to observe the mo∣tions
of Cathmor by night, which concludes the action of the first day. The scene
of this book is a plain, near the hill of Mora, which rose on the borders of the
heath of Moilena, in Ulster.</P></Q>

<HEAD>TEMORA:
AN
EPIC POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The first book of Temora made its appearance in the collection of lesser pieces, which were subjoined to the epic poem of Fingal. When that collection was print∣ed, little more than the opening of the present poem came, in a regular connec∣tion, to my hands. The second book, in particular, was very imperfect and con∣fused. By means of my friends, I have since collected all the broken fragments of Temora, that I formerly wanted; and the story of the poem, which was accurately preserved by many, enabled me to reduce it into that order in which it now appears. The title of Epic was imposed on the poem by myself. The technical terms of criticism were totally unknown to Ossian. Born in a distant age, and in a country re∣mote from the seats of learning, his know∣ledge did not extend to Greek and Roman literature. If therefore, in the form of his poems, and in several passages of his dic∣tion, he resembles Homer, the similarity must proceed from nature, the original from which both drew their ideas. It is from this consideration that I have avoided, in this publication, to give parallel passages from other authors, as I had done, in some of my notes, on the former collection of Ossian's poems. It was far from my in∣tention to raise my author into a competi∣tion with the celebrated names of antiqui∣ty. The extensive field of renown affords ample room to all the poetical merit which has yet appeared in the world, without overturning the character of one poet, to raise that of another on its ruins. Had Ossian even superior merit to Homer and Virgil, a certain partiality, arising from the same deservedly bestowed upon them by the sanction of so many ages, would make us overlook it, and give them the prefe∣rence. Tho' their high merit does not stand in need of adventitious aid, yet it must be acknowledged, that it is an ad∣vantage to their fame, that the posterity of the Greeks and Romans, either do not at all exist, or are not now objects of contempt or envy to the present age.</P>
<P>Tho' this poem of Ossian has not per∣haps all the <HI>minutiae,</HI> which Aristotle, from Homer, lays down as necessary to the con∣duct of an epic poem, yet, it is presumed, it has all the grand essentials of the epo∣poea. Unity of time, place, and action is preserved throughout. The poem opens in the midst of things; what is necessary of preceding transactions to be known, is in∣troduced by episodes afterwards; not for∣mally brought in, but seemingly rising im∣mediately from the situation of affairs. The circumstances are grand, and the diction animated; neither descending into a cold meanness, nor swelling into ridiculous bom∣bast.</P>
<P>The reader will find some alterations in the style of this book. These are drawn from more correct copies of the original which came to my hands, since the former publication. As the most part of the poem is delivered down by tradition, the style is sometimes various and interpolated. After comparing the different readings, I always made choice of that which agreed best with the spirit of the context.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

<HEAD>BOOK FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>THE blue waves of Ullin roll in light. The green hills are
covered with day. Trees shake their dusky heads in the
breeze. Grey torrents pour their noisy streams.—Two green hills,
with aged oaks, surround a narrow plain. The blue course
<PB N="4" REF="42"/>
of a stream is there; on its banks stood Cairbar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cairbar, the son of Borbar-duthul, was descended lineally from Larthon the chief of the Firbolg, the first colony who settled in the south of Ireland. The Caël were in possession of the northern coast of that kingdom, and the first monarchs of Ireland were of their race. Hence arose those differences between the two nations, which terminated, at last, in the murder of Cormac, and the usurpation of Cairbar, lord of Atha, who is mentioned in this place.</NOTE> of Atha.—His
spear supports the king: the red eyes of his fear are sad.
Cormac rises in his soul, with all his ghastly wounds. The grey
form of the youth appears in darkness; blood pours from his airy
sides.—Cairbar thrice threw his spear on earth; and thrice he stroked
<PB N="5" REF="43"/>
his beard. His steps are short; he often stops: and tosses his si∣newy
arms. He is like a cloud in the desart; that varies its form
to every blast: the valleys are sad around, and fear, by turns, the
shower.</P>
<P>THE king, at length, resumed his soul, and took his pointed
spear. He turned his eyes to Moi-lena. The scouts of blue ocean
came. They came with steps of fear, and often looked behind.
Cairbar knew that the mighty were near, and called his gloomy
chiefs.</P>
<P>THE sounding steps of his warriors came. They drew, at once,
their swords. There Morlath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mór-lath, <HI>great in the day of battle.</HI> Hidalla', <HI>mildly looking hero.</HI> Cor-mar, <HI>ex∣pert at sea.</HI> Málth os, <HI>slow to speak.</HI> Fol∣dath, <HI>generous.</HI></P>
<P>Foldath, who is here strongly marked, makes a great figure in the sequel of the poem. His <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ierce, uncomplying character is sustained throughout. He seems, from a passage in the second book, to have been Cairbar's greatest confident, and to have had a principal hand in the conspiracy against Cormac king of Ireland. His tribe was one of the most considerable of the race of the Fir-bolg.</P></NOTE> stood with darkened face. Hidal∣la's
long hair sighs in wind. Red-haired Cormar bends on his spear,
and rolls his side-long-looking eyes. Wild is the look of Mal∣thos
from beneath too shaggy brows.—Foldath stands like an oozy
rock, that covers its dark sides with foam. His spear is like Slimo∣ra's
fir, that meets the wind of heaven. His shield is marked with
the strokes of battle; and his red eye despises danger. These and
a thousand other chiefs surrounded car-borne Cairbar, when the
scout of ocean came, Mor-annal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mór-annal, <HI>strong-breath;</HI> a very pro∣per name for a scout.</NOTE>, from streamy Moi-lena.—His
eyes hang forward from his face, his lips are trembling, pale.</P>

Do the chiefs of Erin stand, he said, silent as the grove of even∣ing?
Stand they, like a silent wood, and Fingal on the coast?
Fingal, who is terrible in battle, the king of streamy Morven.—Hast
thou seen the warrior, said Cairbar with a sigh? Are his he∣roes
many on the coast? Lifts he the spear of battle? Or comes
the king in peace?</P>
<P>IN peace he comes not, Cairbar. I have seen his forward spear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mor-annal here alludes to the parti∣cular appearance of Fingal's spear.—If a man, upon his first landing in a strange country, kept the point of his spear for∣ward, it denoted in those days that he came in a hostile manner, and accordingly he was treated as an enemy; if he kept the point behind him, it was a token of friend∣ship, and he was immediately invited to the feast, according to the hospitality of the times.</NOTE>.
It is a meteor of death: the blood of thousands is on its steel.—He
came first to the shore, strong in the grey hair of age. Full
rose his sinewy limbs, as he strode in his might. That sword is
by his side which gives no second<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This was the famous sword of Fingal, made by Luno, a smith of Lochlin, and after him poetically called the <HI>son of Luno:</HI> it is said of this sword, that it killed a man at every stroke; and that Fingal never used it but in times of the greatest danger.</NOTE> wound. His shield is terrible,
like the bloody moon ascending thro' a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>torm.—Then came Ossian
king of songs; and Morni's son, the first of men. Connal leaps
forward on his spear: Dermid spreads his dark-brown locks.—Fillan
bends his bow, the young hunter of streamy Moruth<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In some traditions Fergus the son of Fingal, and Usnoth chief of Etha, imme∣diately follow Fillan in the list of the chiefs of Morven; but as they are not afterwards mentioned at all in the poem, I look upon the whole sentence to be an interpolation, and have therefore rejected it.</NOTE>.—But
who is that before them, like the terrible course of a stream!
It is the son of Ossian, bright between his locks. His long hair
falls on his back.—His dark brows are half-inclosed in steel. His
<PB N="7" REF="45"/>
sword hangs loose on his side. His spear glitters as he moves. I
fled from his terrible eyes, king of high Temora!</P>
<P>THEN fly, thou feeble man, said Foldath's gloomy wrath: fly
to the grey streams of thy land, son of the little soul! Have not
I seen that Oscar? I beheld the chief in war. He is of the
mighty in danger: but there are others who lift the spear.—Erin
has many sons as brave, king of Temora of Groves! Let Foldath
meet him in the strength of his course, and stop this mighty
stream.—My spear is covered with the blood of the valiant; my
shield is like the wall of Tura.</P>
<P>SHALL Foldath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The opposite characters of Foldath and Malthos are strongly marked in subse∣quent parts of the poem. They appear al∣ways in opposition. The feuds between their families, which were the source of their hatred to one another, are mentioned in other poems.</NOTE> alone meet the foe? replied the dark-browed
Malthos. Are they not numerous on our coast, like the waters
of many streams? Are not these the chiefs who vanquished Swa∣ran,
when the sons of Erin fled? And shall Foldath meet their
bravest hero? Foldath of the heart of pride! take the strength
of the people; and let Malthos come. My sword is red with
slaughter, but who has heard my words?<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That is, who has heard my vaunting? He intended the expression as a rebuke to the self-praise of Foldath.</NOTE></P>
<P>SONS of green Erin, said Hidalla<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hidalla was the chief of Clonra, a small district on the banks of the lake of Lego. The beauty of his person, his elo∣quence and genius for poetry are afterwards mentioned.</NOTE>, let not Fingal hear your
words. The foe might rejoice, and his arm be strong in the land.—Ye
are brave, O warriors, and like the tempests of the desart;
<PB N="8" REF="46"/>
they meet the rocks without fear, and overturn the woods.—But
let us move in our strength, slow as a gathered cloud.—Then
shall the mighty tremble; the spear shall fall from the hand of the
valiant.—We see the cloud of death, they will say, while shadows
fly over their face. Fingal will mourn in his age, and see his fly∣ing
fame.—The steps of his chiefs will cease in Morven: the moss
of years shall grow in Selma.</P>
<P>CAIRBAR heard their words, in silence, like the cloud of a
shower: it stands dark on Cromla, till the lightning bursts its side:
the valley gleams with red light; the spirits of the storm rejoice.—So
stood the silent king of Temora; at length his words are
heard.</P>
<P>SPREAD the feast on Moi-lena: let my hundred bards attend.
Thou, red-hair'd Olla, take the harp of the king. Go to Oscar
chief of swords, and bid him to our feast. To-day we feast and
hear the song; to-morrow break the spears. Tell him that I have
raised the tomb of Cathol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cathol the son of Maronnan, or Moran, was murdered by Cairbar, for his attachment to the family of Cormac. He had attended Oscar to the <HI>war of Inis-thona,</HI> where they contracted a great friendship for one an∣other.

him that Cairbar has heard his fame at the stream of resounding

Cathmor was successful in the war, but, in the course of it, Conmor was either killed, or died a natural death. Cairbar, upon intelligence of the designs of Fingal to dethrone him, had dispatched a messenger for Cathmor, who returned into Ireland a few days before the opening of the poem.</P>
<P>Cairbar here takes advantage of his bro∣ther's absence, to perpetrate his ungenerous designs against Oscar; for the noble spirit of Cathmor, had he been present, would not have permitted the laws of that hospitality, for which he was so renowned himself, to be violated.

<PB N="9" REF="47"/>
He is not here with his thousands, and our arms are weak. Cath∣mor
is a foe to strife at the feast: his soul is bright as that sun.
But Cairbar shall fight with Oscar, chiefs of the woody Temora!
His words for Cathol were many; the wrath of Cairbar burns. He
shall fall on Moi-lena: my fame shall rise in blood.</P>
<P>THEIR faces brightened round with joy. They spread over Moi∣lena.
The feast of shells is prepared. The songs of bards arise.
We heard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Fingal's army heard the joy that was in Cairbar's camp. The character given of Cathmor is agreeable to the times. Some, through ostentation, were hospitable; and other sell naturally into a custom handed down from their ancestors. But what marks strongly the character of Cathmor, is his aversion to praise; for he is represented to dwell in a wood to avoid the thanks of his guests; which is still a higher degree of generosity than that of Axylus in Ho∣mer: for the poet does not say, but the good man might, at the head of his own table, have heard with pleasure the praise bestowed on him by the people he enter∣tained.</P>
<P>No nation in the world carried hospitality to a greater length than the ancient Scots. It was even infamous, for many ages, in a man of condition, to have the door of his house shut at all, LEST, as the bards express it, THE STRANGER SHOULD COME AND BEHOLD HIS CONTRACTED SOUL. Some of the chiefs were possessed of this hospi∣table disposition to an extravagant degree; and the bards, perhaps upon a private ac∣count, never failed to recommend it, in their eulogiums, <HI>Cean uia' na dai',</HI> or <HI>the point to which all the roads of the strang∣ers lead,</HI> was an invariable epithet given by them to the chiefs; on the contrary, they distinguished the inhospitable by the title of <HI>the cloud which the strangers shun.</HI> This last however was so uncommon, that in all the old poems I have ever met with, I found but one man branded with this ignomini∣ous appellation; and that, perhaps, only founded upon a private quarrel, which sub∣sisted between him and the patron of the bard, who wrote the poem.</P>
<P>We have a story of this hospitable na∣ture, handed down by tradition, concern∣ing one of the first Earls of Argyle. This nobleman, hearing that an Irishman, of great quality, intended to make him a vi∣sit, with a very numerous retinue of his friends and dependants, burnt the castle of Dunora, the seat of his family, lest it should be too small to entertain his guests, and received the Irish in tents on the shore. Extravagant as this behaviour might seem in our days, it was admired and applauded in those times of hospitality, and the Earl acquired considerable fame by it, in the songs of the bards.</P>
<P>The open communication with one an∣other, which was the consequence of their hospitality, did not a little tend to improve the understanding and enlarge the ideas of the ancient Scots. It is to this cause, we must attribute that sagacity and sense, which the common people, in the highlands, pos∣sess, still, in a degree superior even to the vulgar of more polished countries. When men are crowded together in great cities they see indeed many people, but are ac∣quainted with few. They naturally form themselves into small societies, and their knowledge scarce extends beyond the alley or street they live in: add to this that the very employment of a mechanic tends to contract the mind. The ideas of a pea∣sant are still more confined. His know∣ledge is circumscribed within the com∣pass of a few acres; or, at most, extends no further than the nearest market-town. The manner of life among the inhabitants of the highlands is very different from these. As their fields are barren, they have scarce any domestic employment. Their time is spent therefore in an extensive wilderness, where they feed their cattle, and these, by stray∣ing far and wide, carry their keepers after them, at times, to all the different settle∣ments of the clans. There they are re∣ceived with hospitality and good cheer, which, as they tend to display the minds of the hosts, afford an opportunity to the guests to make their observations on the different characters of men; which is the true source of knowledge and acquired sense. Hence it is that a common high∣lander is acquainted with a greater number of characters, than any of his own rank living in the most populous cities.</P></NOTE> the voice of joy on the coast: we thought that mighty

Cathmor came. Cathmor the friend of strangers! the brother of
red-haired Cairbair. Their souls were not the same. The light
<PB N="11" REF="49"/>
of heaven was in the bosom of Cathmor. His towers rose on the
banks of Atha: seven paths led to his halls. Seven chiefs stood on
the paths, and called the stranger to the feast! But Cathmor dwelt
in the wood to avoid the voice of praise.</P>
<P>OLLA came with his songs. Oscar went to Cairbar's feast.
Three hundred warriors strode along Moi-lena of the streams. The
grey dogs bounded on the heath, their howling reached afar. Fin∣gal
saw the departing hero: the soul of the king was sad. He
dreaded Cairbar's gloomy thoughts, amidst the feast of shells.</P>
<P>MY son raised high the spear of Cormac: an hundred bards met
him with songs. Cairbar concealed with smiles the death that was
dark in his soul. The feast is spread, the shells resound: joy bright∣ens
the face of the host. But it was like the parting beam of the
sun, when he is to hide his red head, in a storm.</P>
<P>CAIRBAR rose in his arms; darkness gathered on his brow. The
hundred harps ceased at once. The clang<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When a chief was determined to kill a person already in his power, it was usual to signify, that his death was intended, by the sound of a shield struck with the blunt end of a spear; at the same time that a bard at a distance raised the <HI>death-song.</HI> A ceremony of another kind was long used in Scotland upon such occasions.

<P>SHALL I yield, Oscar replied, the gift of Erin's injured king:

came to Cormac's halls of joy, when Swaran fled from Fingal.
Gladness rose in the face of youth: he gave the spear of Temora.
Nor did he give it to the feeble, O Cairbar, neither to the weak in

THEIR people saw the darkening chiefs. Their crowding steps
are heard around. Their eyes roll in fire. A thousand swords are
half unsheathed. Red-haired Olla raised the song of battle: the

Morlath falls: Maronnan dies: Conachar trembles in his blood.
Cairbar shrinks before Oscar's sword; and creeps in darkness be∣hind
his stone. He lifted the spear in secret, and pierced my Os∣car's
side. He falls forward on his shield: his knee sustains the
chief. But still his spear is in his hand.—See gloomy Cairbar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The Irish historians place the death of Cairbar, in the latter end of the third cen∣tury: they say, he was killed in battle a∣gainst Oscar the son of Ossian, but deny that he fell by his hand. As they have nothing to go upon but the traditions of their bards, the translator thinks that the account of Ossian is as probable: at the worst, it is but opposing one tradition to another.</P>
<P>It is, however, certain, that the Irish his∣torians disguise, in some measure, this part of their history. An Irish poem on this subject, which, undoubtedly, was the source of their information, concerning the battle of Gabhra, where Cairbar fell, is just now in my hands. The circumstances are less to the disadvantage of the character of Cairbar, than those related by Ossian. As a translation of the poem (which, tho' evidently no very ancient composition, does not want poetical merit) would extend this note to too great a length, I shall only give the story of it, in brief, with some extracts from the original Irish.</P>
<P>Oscar, says the Irish bard, was invited to a feast, at Temora, by Cairbar king of Ireland. A dispute arose between the two heroes, concerning the exchange of spears, which was usually made, between the guests and their host, upon such occasions. In the course of their altercation, Cairbar said, in a boastful manner, that he would hunt on the hills of Albion, and carry the spoils of it into Ireland, in spite of all the efforts of its inhabitants. The original words are;
<Q><L>Briathar buan sin; Briathar buan</L>
<L>A bheireadh an Cairbre rua',</L>
<L>Gu tuga' se sealg, agus creach</L>
<L>A h'ALBIN an la'r na mhaireach.</L></Q>
Oscar replied, that, the next day, he him∣self would carry into Albion the spoils of the five provinces of Ireland; in spite of the opposition of Cairbar.</P>
<Q><L>Briathar eile an aghai' sin</L>
<L>A bheirea' an t'Oscar, og, calma</L>
<L>Gu'n tugadh se sealg agus creach</L>
<L>Do dh'ALBIN an la'r na mhaireach, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>Oscar, in consequence of his threats, be∣gun to lay waste Ireland; but as he re∣turned with the spoil into Ulster, thro' the narrow pass of Gabhra (<HI>Caoil ghlen-Gha∣bhra</HI>) he was met, by Cairbar, and a bat∣t'e ensued, in which both the heroes sell by mutual wounds. The bard gives a very curious list of the followers of Oscar, as they marched to battle. They appear to have been five hundred in number, com∣manded, as the poet expresses it, by <HI>five heroes of the blood of kings.</HI> This poem mentions Fingal, as arriving from Scot∣land, before Oscar died of his wounds.</P></NOTE> falls!
<PB N="14" REF="52"/>
The steel pierced his forehead, and divided his red hair behind. He
lay, like a shattered rock, which Cromla shakes from its shaggy side.
But never more shall Oscar rise! he leans on his bossy shield. His
spear is in his terrible hand: Erin's sons stood distant and dark.
Their shouts arose, like crowded streams, and Moi-lena echoed
wide.</P>
<P>FINGAL heard the sound; and took his father's spear. His steps
are before us on the heath. He spoke the words of woe. I hear
the noise of war. Young Oscar is alone. Rise, sons of Morven;
join the hero's sword.</P>
<P>OSSIAN rushed along the heath. Fillan bounded over Moi-lena.
Fingal strode in his strength, and the light of his shield is terrible.
<PB N="15" REF="53"/>
The sons of Erin saw it far distant; they trembled in their souls.
They knew that the wrath of the king arose: and they foresaw
their death. We first arrived; we fought; and Erin's chiefs with∣stood
our rage. But when the king came, in the sound of his
course, what heart of steel could stand! Erin fled over Moi-lena.
Death pursued their flight.</P>
<P>WE saw Oscar on his shield. We saw his blood around. Si∣lence
darkened every face. Each turned his back and wept. The
king strove to hide his tears. His grey beard whistled in the wind.
He bends his head above his son. His words are mixed with sighs.</P>
<P>AND art thou fallen, Oscar, in the midst of thy course? the
heart of the aged beats over thee! He sees thy coming wars.
The wars which ought to come he beholds, but they are cut off
from thy fame. When shall joy dwell at Selma? When shall
grief depart from Morven? My sons fall by degrees: Fingal shall
be the last of his race. The fame which I have received shall
pass away: my age will be without friends. I shall sit a grey
cloud in my hall: nor shall I hear the return of a son, in the midst
of his sounding arms. Weep, ye heroes of Morven! never more
shall Oscar rise!</P>
<P>AND they did weep, O Fingal; dear was the hero to their souls.
He went out to battle, and the foes vanished; he returned, in peace,
amidst their joy. No father mourned his son slain in youth; no
brother his brother of love. They sell, without tears, for the chief
of the people was low! Bran<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bran was one of Fingal's dogs.—He was so remarkable for his fleetness, that the poet, in a piece which is not just now in the translator's hands, has given him the same properties with Virgil's Camilla.

<PB N="16" REF="54"/>
is sad, for he had often led them to the chace; to the bounding
roe of the desart.</P>
<P>WHEN Oscar saw his friends around, his white breast rose with
sighs.—The groans, he said, of aged chiefs; the howling of my
dogs: the sudden bursts of the song of grief, have melted Oscar's
soul. My soul, that never melted before; it was like the steel of
my sword.—Ossian, carry me to my hills! Raise the stones of my
renown. Place the horn of the deer, and my sword within my
narrow dwelling.—The torrent hereafter may raise the earth:
the hunter may find the steel and say, “This has been Oscar's
sword.”</P>
<P>AND fallest thou, son of my fame! And shall I never see thee,
Oscar! When others hear of their sons, I shall not hear of thee.
The moss is on thy four grey stones; the mournful wind is there.
The battle shall be fought without him: he shall not pursue the
dark-brown hinds. When the warrior returns from battles, and
tells of other lands; I have seen a tomb, he will say, by the roaring
stream, the dark dwelling of a chief. He fell by car-borne Oscar,
the first of mortal men.—I, perhaps, shall hear his voice; and a
beam of joy will rise in my soul.</P>
<P>THE night would have descended in sorrow, and morning re∣turned
in the shadow of grief: our chiefs would have stood like
cold dropping rocks on Moi-lena, and have forgot the war, did not
the king disperse his grief, and raise his mighty voice. The chiefs,
as new-wakened from dreams, lift up their heads around.</P>
<P>How long on Moi-lena shall we weep; or pour our tears in Ullin?
The mighty will not return. Oscar shall not rise in his strength.
<PB N="17" REF="55"/>
The valiant must fall one day, and be no more known on his hills.—Where
are our fathers, O warriors! the chiefs of the times of
old? They have set like stars that have shone, we only hear the
sound of their praise. But they were renowned in their day, the
terror of other times. Thus shall we pass, O warriors, in the day
of our fall. Then let us be renowned when we may; and leave
our fame behind us, like the last beams of the sun, when he hides
his red head in the west.</P>
<P>ULLIN, my aged bard! take the ship of the king. Carry Oscar
to Selma of harps. Let the daughters of Morven weep. We shall
fight in Erin for the race of fallen Cormac. The days of my years
begin to fail: I feel the weakness of my arm. My fathers bend
from their clouds, to receive their grey-hair'd son. But, before I
go hence, one beam of fame shall rise: so shall my days end, as
my years begun, in fame: my life shall be one stream of light to
bards of other times.</P>
<P>ULLIN rais'd his white sails: the wind of the south came forth.
He bounded on the waves towards Selma.—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poet speaks in his own person.</NOTE> I remained in my
grief, but my words were not heard.—The feast is spread on
Moi-lena: an hundred heroes reared the tomb of Cairbar: but no
song is raised over the chief; for his soul had been dark and bloody.
The bards remembered the fall of Cormac! what could they say in
Cairbar's praise?</P>
<P>THE night came rolling down. The light of an hundred oaks
arose. Fingal sat beneath a tree. Old Althan<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Althan, the son of Conachar, was the chief bard of Arth king of Ireland.

star looked from behind its edge.—I stood in the wood alone, and
saw a ghost on the darkening air. His stride extended from hill to
hill: his shield was dim on his side. It was the son of Semo: I
knew the warrior's face. But he passed away in his blast; and all
was dark around.—My soul was sad. I went to the hall of shells.
A thousand lights arose: the hundred bards had strung the harp.
Cormac stood in the midst, like the morning star, when it rejoices
on the eastern hill, and its young beams are bathed in showers.—The
sword of Artho<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Arth, or Artho, the father of Cormac king of Ireland.</NOTE> was in the hand of the king; and he looked
with joy on its polished studs: thrice he attempted to draw it, and
thrice he failed; his yellow locks are spread on his shoulders: his
cheeks of youth are red.—I mourned over the beam of youth, for
he was soon to set.</P>
<P>ALTHAN! he said, with a smile, hast thou beheld my father?
Heavy is the sword of the king, surely his arm was strong. O that
I were like him in battle, when the rage of his wrath arose! then
<PB N="19" REF="57"/>
would I have met, like Cuchullin, the car-borne son of Cantéla!
But years may come on, O Althan! and my arm be strong.—Hast
thou heard of Semo's son, the chief of high Temora? He might
have returned with his fame; for he promised to return to-night.
My bards wait him with songs; my feast is spread in Temora.</P>
<P>I HEARD the king in silence. My tears began to flow. I hid
them with my aged locks; but he perceived my grief.</P>
<P>SON of Conachar! he said, is the king of Tura<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuchullin is called the king of Tura from a castle of that name on the coast of Ulster, where he dwelt, before he under∣took the management of the affairs of Ire∣land, in the minority of Cormac.</NOTE> low? Why bursts
thy sigh in secret? And why descends the tear?—Comes the car∣borne
Torlath? Or the sound of the red-haired Cairbar?—They
come!—for I behold thy grief. Mossy Tura's king is low!—Shall
I not rush to battle?—But I cannot lift the spear!—O had mine
arm the strength of Cuchullin, soon would Cairbar fly; the fame
of my fathers would be renewed; and the deeds of other times!</P>
<P>HE took his bow. The tears flow down, from both his sparkling
eyes.—Grief saddens round: the bards bend forward, from their
hundred harps. The lone blast touched their trembling strings.
The sound<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That prophetic sound, mentioned in other poems, which the harps of the bards emited before the death of a person wor∣thy and renowned. It is here an omen of the death of Cormac, which, soon af∣ter, followed.</NOTE> is sad and low.</P>

had forgot the war, for he, their fire, was seen no more.</P>
<P>BUT who, said the soft-voiced Carril, come like the bounding

They had just arrived in Ulster when the news of Cuchullin's death arrived. Nathos, the eldest of the three brothers, took the com∣mand of Cuchullin's army, and made head against Cairbar the chief of Atha. Cair∣bar having, at last, murdered young king Cormac, at Temora, the army of Nathos shifted sides, and the brothers were obliged to return into Ulster, in order to pass over into Scotland.

comest thou in thy arms to Temora, Cairbar of the

<P>HE passed on in his darkness, and seized the hand of the king.
Cormac foresaw his death, and the rage of his eyes arose.—Retire,

his thousands to Ullin; to aid the red-haired Cairbar: and now he
comes to revenge his death, O king of woody Morven.—</P>

His soul is great; his arm is strong, his battles are full of
fame.—But the little soul is a vapour that hovers round the mar∣shy

it there: its dwelling is in the cave, it sends forth the dart of death.</P>
<P>OUR young heroes, O warriors, are like the renown of our fa∣thers.—They
fight in youth; they fall: their names are in the
song. Fingal is amidst his darkening years. He must not fall, as
an aged oak, across a secret stream. Near it are the steps of the
hunter, as it lies beneath the wind. “How has that tree fallen?”
He, whistling, strides along.</P>
<P>RAISE the song of joy, ye bards of Morven, that our souls may

king; go to Mora's dark-brown side. Let thine eyes travel over
the heath, like flames of fire. Observe the foes of Fingal, and

falling of rocks in the desart.—But strike thou thy shield, at
times, that they may not come through night, and the fame of
Morven cease.—I begin to be alone, my son, and I dread the fall of
my renown.</P>
<P>THE voice of the bards arose. The king leaned on the shield
of Trenmor.—Sleep descended on his eyes, and his future battles
rose in his dreams. The host are sleeping around. Dark-haired
Fillan observed the foe. His steps are on a distant hill: we hear,
at times, his clanging shield.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>THIS book opens, we may suppose, about midnight, with a soliloquy of Ossian, who
had retired, from the rest of the army, to mourn for his son Oscar. Upon hearing
the noise of Cathmor's army approaching, he went to find out his brother Fillan,
who kept the watch, on the hill of Mora, in the front of Fingal's army. In the con∣versation
of the brothers, the episode of Conar, the son of Trenmor, who was the
first king of Ireland, is introduced, which lays open the origin of the contests be∣tween
the Caël and Firbolg, the two nations who first possessed themselves of that
island. Ossian kindles a fire on Mora; upon which Cathmor desisted from the de∣sign
he had formed of surprising the army of the Caledonians. He calls a council of
his chiefs; reprimands Foldath for advising a night-attack, as the Irish army were
so much superior in number to the enemy. The bard Fonar introduces the story of
Crothar, the ancestor of the king, which throws further light on the history of Ire∣land,
and the original pretensions of the family of Atha, to the throne of that king∣dom.
The Irish chiefs lie down to rest, and Cathmor himself undertakes the watch.
In his circuit, round the army, he is met by Ossian. The interview of the two he∣roes
is described. Cathmor obtains a promise from Ossian, to order a funeral elegy to
be sung over the grave of Cairbar; it being the opinion of the times, that the souls of
the dead could not be happy, till their elegies were sung by a bard. Morning comes.
Cathmor and Ossian part; and the latter, casually meeting with Carril the son of
Kinfena, sends that bard, with a funeral song, to the tomb of Cairbar.</Q>

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Addresses to the spirits of deceased warriors are common, in the compositions of Ossian. He, however, expresses them in such language as prevents all suspicion of his paying divine honours to the dead, as was usual among other unenlightened nations.—From the sequel of this apostro∣phe, it appears, that Ossian had retired from the rest of the army to mourn, in secret, over the death of his son Oscar. This indirect method of narration has much of the nature of the Drama, and is more forcible than a regular historical chain of circumstances. The abrupt manner of Ossian may often render him obscure to in∣attentive readers. Those who retain his poems, on memory, seem to be sensible of this; and usually give the history of the pieces minutely before they begin to re∣peat the poetry.</P>
<P>Tho' this book has little action, it is not the least important part of Temora. The poet, in several episodes, runs up the cause of the war to the very source. The first po∣pulation of Ireland, the wars between the two nations who originally possessed that island, its first race of kings, and the revolutions of its government, are impor∣tant facts, and are delivered by the poet, with so little mixture of the fabulous, that one cannot help preferring his accounts to the improbable fictions of the Scotch and Irish historians. The Milesian fables of those gentlemen bear about them the marks of a late invention.

In this situation were affairs when Ossian, upon hearing the noise of the ap∣proaching enemy, went to find out his brother. Their conversation naturally in∣troduces the episode, concerning Conar the son of Trenmor the first Irish monarch, which is so necessary to the understanding the foundation of the rebellion and usurpa∣tion of Cairbar, and Cathmor.—Fillan was the youngest of the sons of Fingal, then living. He and Bosmina, mentioned in the <HI>battle of Lora,</HI> were the only children of the king, by Clatho the daughter of Cathul∣la king of Inis-tore, whom he had taken to wise, after the death of Ros-crana, the daughter of Cormac Mac-Conar king of Ireland.</NOTE> is not heard.

the storm.—My steps are forward on the heath: the spear of Oscar
in my hand. Red stars looked from high. I gleamed, along the
night.—I saw Fillan silent before me, bending forward from Mora's
rock. He heard the shout of the foe; and the joy of his soul
arose. He heard my sounding tread, and turned his lifted spear.</P>

Tho' the epi∣sode, which follows, may seem to flow naturally enough from the conversation of the brothers, yet I have shewn, in a pre∣ceding note, and, more at large, in the dis∣sertation prefixed to this collection, that the poet had a farther design in view.

<P>CONAR<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Conar, the first king of Ireland, was the son of Trenmor, the great-grand-fa∣ther of Fingal.

The most probable opinion concerning him is, that he was the first, who united the tribes of the Caledonians, and commanded them, in chief, against the incursions of the Romans. The genealogists of the North have traced his family far back, and given a list of his ancestors to <HI>Cuan-mór nan lan,</HI> or Con∣mor of the swords, who, according to them, was the first who crossed the <HI>great sea,</HI> to Caledonia, from which circum∣stance his name proceeded, which signifies <HI>Great ocean.</HI> Genealogies of so ancient a date, however, are little to be depended upon.</NOTE> was the brother of Trathal, first of mortal men.

<P>THEY came forth, like the streams of the desart, with the roar
of their hundred tribes. Conar was a rock before them: broken
they rolled on every side. But often they returned, and the sons of
Ullin fell. The king stood, among the tombs of his warriors, and
darkly bent his mournful face. His soul was rolled into itself; and

so Colgar descended to battle, and wasted the echoing field. His
father rejoiced over the hero: but an arrow came. His tomb was
raised, without a tear. The king was to revenge his son.—He
lightened forward in battle, till Bolga yielded at her streams.</P>
<P>WHEN peace returned to the land, and his blue waves bore the
king to Morven: then he remembered his son, and poured the
silent tear. Thrice did the bards, at the cave of Furmono, call the
soul of Colgar. They called him to the hills of his land; and
he heard them in his mist. Trathal placed his sword in the cave,
that the spirit of his son might rejoice.</P>

her head, midst her wandering locks. The moon looked in, at
night, and saw the white-tossing of her arms; for she thought of
the mighty Crothar, in the season of her dreams.</P>
<P>THREE days feasted Crothar with Cathmin. On the fourth
they awaked the hinds. Con-lama moved to the chace, with all
her lovely steps. She met Crothar in the narrow path. The bow
fell, at once, from her hand. She turned her face away, and half∣hid
it with her locks.—The love of Crothar rose. He brought
the white-bosomed maid to Atha.—Bards raised the song in her
presence; and joy dwelt round the daugther of Ullin.</P>
<P>THE pride of Turloch rose, a youth who loved the white∣handed
Con-láma. He came, with battle, to Alnecma; to Atha
of the roes. Cormul went forth to the strife, the brother of car∣borne
Crothar. He went forth, but he fell, and the sigh of his
people rose.—Silent and tall, across the stream, came the dark∣ening
strength of Crothar: he rolled the foe from Alnecma, and
returned, midst the joy of Con-láma.</P>
<P>BATTLE on battle comes. Blood is poured on blood. The
tombs of the valiant rise. Erin's clouds are hung round with
ghosts. The chiefs of the south gathered round the echoing
shield of Crothar. He came, with death, to the paths of the foe.

heard his song with joy. His tears come rolling down: the winds

<P>ERIN sleeps around. No sleep comes down on Cathmor's eyes.
Dark, in his soul, he saw the spirit of low-laid Cairbar. He saw
him, without his song, rolled in a blast of night.—He rose. His
steps were round the host. He struck, at times, his echoing shield.
The sound reached Ossian's ear, on Mora of the hinds.</P>
<P>FILLAN, I said, the foes advance. I hear the shield of war.

<P>I STRODE, in all my rattling arms; wide-bounding over a stream
that darkly-winded, in the field, before the king of Atha. Green
Atha's king, with lifted spear, came forward on my course.—Now
would we have mixed in horrid fray, like two contending ghosts, that
bending forward, from two clouds, send forth the roaring winds;
did not Ossian behold, on high, the helmit of Erin's kings. The
Eagle's wing spread above it, rustling in the breeze. A red star

<P>THE helmet of kings is before me! Who art thou son of night?
Shall Ossian's spear be renowned, when thou art lowly-laid?—

At once he dropt the gleaming lance. Growing before me seemed
the form. He stretched his hand in night; and spoke the words
of kings.</P>
<P>FRIEND of the spirits of heroes, do I meet thee thus in shades?
I have wished for thy stately steps in Atha, in the days of feasts.—Why
should my spear now arise? The sun must behold us, Ossian;
when we bend, gleaming, in the strife. Future warriors shall mark
the place: and, shuddering, think of other years. They shall
mark it, like the haunt of ghosts, pleasant and dreadful to the
soul.</P>
<P>AND shall it be forgot, I said, where we meet in peace? Is the
remembrance of battles always pleasant to the soul? Do not we
behold, with joy, the place where our fathers feasted? But our
eyes are full of tears, on the field of their wars.—This stone shall
rise, with all its moss, and speak to other years. “Here Cathmor
and Ossian met! the warriors met in peace!”—When thou, O

In the recitative or narrative part of the poem, the original is rather a measured sort of prose, than any regular versification; but it has all that variety of cadences, which suit the different ideas, and passions of the speakers.—This book takes up only the space of a few hours.</NOTE> WHO comes from Lubar's vale? From the folds of the
morning mist? The drops of heaven are on his head. His steps
<PB N="42" REF="80"/>
are in the paths of the sad. It is Carril of other times. He comes
from Tura's silent cave. I behold it dark in the rock, thro' the
thin folds of mist. There, perhaps, Cuchullin sits, on the blast
which bends its trees. Pleasant is the song of the morning from
the bard of Erin!</P>
<P>THE waves crowd away for fear: they hear the sound of thy
coming forth, O sun!—Terrible is thy beauty, son of heaven,
when death is folded in thy locks; when thou rollest thy vapors
before thee, over the blasted host. But pleasant is thy beam to
the hunter, sitting by the rock in a storm, when thou lookest
from thy parted cloud, and brightenest his dewy locks; he looks
down on the streamy vale, and beholds the descent of roes.—How
long shalt thou rise on war, and roll, a bloody shield, thro'
heaven? I see the deaths of heroes dark-wandering over thy
face!—Why wander the words of Carril! does the sun of
heaven mourn! he is unstained in his course, ever rejoicing in
his fire.—Roll on, thou careless light; thou too, perhaps,
must fall. Thy dun robe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the <HI>dun robe</HI> of the sun, is proba∣bly meant an eclipse.</NOTE> may seize thee, struggling, in thy
sky.</P>
<P>PLEASANT is the voice of the song, O Carril, to Ossian's
soul! It is like the shower of the morning, when it comes
through the rustling vale, on which the sun looks thro' mist,
just rising from his rocks.—But this is no time, O bard, to
sit down, at the strife of song. Fingal is in arms on the vale.
<PB N="43" REF="81"/>
Thou seest the flaming shield of the king. His face darkens be∣tween
his locks. He beholds the wide rolling of Erin.—</P>
<P>DOES not Carril behold that tomb, beside the roaring stream?
Three stones lift their grey heads, beneath a bending oak. A king
is lowly laid: give thou his soul to the wind. He is the brother
of Cathmor! open his airy hall.—Let thy song be a stream of joy
to Cairbar's darkened ghost.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>MORNING coming on, Fingal, after a speech to his people, devolves the command
on Gaul, the son of Morni; it being the custom of the times, that the king should
not engage, till the necessity of affairs required his superior valour and conduct.—The
king and Ossian retire to the rock of Cormul, which overlooked the field of
battle. The bards sing the war-song. The general conflict is described. Gaul, the
son of Morni, distinguishes himself; kills Tur-lathon, chief of Moruth, and other
chiefs of lesser name.—On the other hand, Foldath, who commanded the Irish
army (for Cathmor, after the example of Fingal, kept himself from battle) fights
gallantly; kills Connal, chief of Dun-lora, and advances to engage Gaul himself.
Gaul, in the mean time, being wounded in the hand, by a random arrow, is co∣vered
by Fillan, the son of Fingal, who performs prodigies of valour. Night comes
on. The horn of Fingal recalls his army. The bards meet them, with a congra∣tulatory
song, in which the praises of Gaul and Fillan are particularly celebrated. The
chiefs sit down at a feast; Fingal misses Connal. The episode of Connal and Duth∣caron
is introduced; which throws further light on the ancient history of Ireland.
Carril is dispatched to raise the tomb of Connal.—The action of this book takes
up the second day, from the opening of the poem.</Q>

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This sudden apostrophe, concerning Fingal, the attitude of the king, and the scenery in which he is placed, tend to elevate the mind to a just conception of the succeeding battle. The speech of Fin∣gal is full of that magnanimous generosity which distinguishes his character through∣out. The groupe of figures, which the poet places around his father, are pictu∣resque, and described with great propriety. The silence of Gaul, the behaviour of Fillan, and the effect which both have on the mind of Fingal, are well imagined.—His speech upon the occasion is very beautiful in the original. Broken and unequal, the num∣bers represent the agitation of his mind, divided between the admiration excited by the silence of Gaul, (when others boasted of their own actions) and his natural af∣fection for Fillan, which the behaviour of that valiant youth had raised to the high∣est pitch.</NOTE> WHO is that, at blue-streaming Lubar; by the bending
hill of the roes? Tall, he leans on an oak torn from
high, by nightly winds.—Who but Comhal's son, brightening in
the last of his fields? His grey hair is on the breeze: he half un∣sheaths
the sword of Luno. His eyes are turned to Moi-lena, to
<PB N="48" REF="85"/>
the dark rolling of foes.—Dost thou hear the voice of the king?
It is like the bursting of a stream, in the desart, when it comes,
between its echoing rocks, to the blasted field of the sun.</P>
<P>WIDE-SKIRTED comes down the foe! Sons of woody Morven,
arise. Be ye like the rocks of my land, on whose brown sides are
the rolling of waters. A beam of joy comes on my soul; I see
them mighty before me. It is when the foe is feeble, that the
sighs of Fingal are heard; lest death should come, without renown,
and darkness dwell on his tomb.—Who shall lead the war, against
the host of Alnecma? It is, only when danger grows, that my
sword shall shine.—Such was the custom, heretofore, of Trenmor
the ruler of winds: and thus descended to battle the blue-shielded
Trathal.</P>
<P>THE chiefs bend towards the king: each darkly seems to claim
the war. They tell, by halves, their mighty deeds: and turn their
eyes on Erin. But far before the rest the son of Morni stood: si∣lent
he stood, for who had not heard of the battles of Gaul? They
rose within his soul. His hand, in secret, seized the sword. The
sword which he brought from Strumon, when the strength of Mor∣ni
failed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Strumon, <HI>stream of the hill,</HI> the name of the seat of the family of Gaul, in the neighbourhood of Selma. During Gaul's expedition to Tromathon, mentioned in the <HI>poem of Oithona,</HI> Morni his father died. Morni ordered the <HI>sword of Strumon,</HI> (which had been preserved, in the family, as a re∣lique, from the days of Colgach, the most renowned of his ancestors) to be laid by his side, in the tomb: at the fame time, leaving it in charge to his son, not to take it from thence, till he was reduced to the last extremity. Not long after, two of his brothers being slain, in battle, by Colda∣ronnan, chief of Clutha, Gaul went to his father's tomb to take the sword. His address to the spirit of the deceased hero, is the only part now remaining, of a poem of Ossian, on the subject. I shall here lay it before the reader.</P>

ON his spear stood the son of Clatho<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Clatho was the daughter of Cathulla, king of Inistore. Fingal, in one of his expeditions to that island, fell in love with Clatho, and took her to wife, after the death of Ros-crána, the daughter of Cor∣mac, king of Ireland.</P>
<P>Clatho was the mother of Ryno, Fillan, and Bosmina, mentioned in the <HI>battle of Lora,</HI> one of the lesser poems published in the former collection. Fillan is often cal∣led the son of Clatho, to distinguish him from those sons which Fingal had by Ros∣crána.</P></NOTE>, in the wandering of his
locks. Thrice he raised his eyes to Fingal: his voice thrice failed
him, as he spoke.—Fillan could not boast of battles: at once he
strode away. Bent over a distant stream he stood: the tear hung
in his eye. He struck, at times, the thistle's head, with his inverted
spear.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="87"/>
NOR is he unseen of Fingal. Sidelong he beheld his son. He
beheld him, with bursting joy; and turned, amidst his crowded soul.
In silence turned the king towards Mora of woods. He hid the
big tear with his locks.—At length his voice is heard.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gaul, the son of Morni, next to Fin∣gal, is the most renowned character intro∣duced by Ossian in his poems. He is, like Ajax in the Iliad, distinguished by his man∣ly taciturnity. The honourable epithets bestowed on him here, by Fingal, are a∣mazingly expressive in the original. There is not a passage in all Temora, which loses so much in the translatin as this. The first part of the speech is rapid and irregu∣lar, and is peculiarly calculated to animate the soul to war.—Where the king addres∣ses Fillan, the versification changes to a re∣gular and smooth measure. The first is like torrents rushing over broken rocks; the second like the course of a full-flowing river, calm but majestic. This instance serves to shew, how much it assists a poet to alter the measure, according to the par∣ticular passion, that he intends to excite in his reader.</NOTE> FIRST of the sons of Morni; thou rock that defiest the storm!
Lead thou my battle, for the race of low-laid Cormac. No boy's
staff is thy spear: no harmless beam of light thy sword. Son of
Morni of steeds, behold the foe; destroy.—Fillan, observe
the chief: he is not calm in strife: nor burns he, heedless, in bat∣tle;
my son, observe the king. He is strong as Lubar's stream,
but never foams and roars.—High on cloudy Mora, Fingal shall be∣hold
the war. Stand, Ossian<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ullin being sent to Morven with the body of Oscar, Ossian attends his father, in quality of chief bard.</NOTE>, near thy father, by the falling
stream.—Raise the voice, O bards; Morven, move beneath the
sound. It is my latter field; clothe it over with light.</P>
<P>AS the sudden rising of winds; or distant rolling of troubled
seas, when some dark ghost, in wrath, heaves the billows over an
isle, the seat of mist, on the deep, for many dark-brown years: so
terrible is the sound of the host, wide-moving over the field.
<PB N="51" REF="88"/>
Gaul is tall before them: the streams glitter within his strides.
The bards raised the song by his side; he struck his shield between.
On the skirts of the blast, the tuneful voices rose.</P>
<P>ON Crona, said the bards, there bursts a stream by night. It
swells, in its own dark course, till morning's early beam. Then
comes it white from the hill, with the rocks and their hundred
groves. Far be my steps from Crona: Death is tumbling there.
Be ye a stream from Mora, sons of cloudy Morven.</P>
<P>WHO rises, from his car, on Clutha? The hills are troubled
before the king! The dark woods echo round, and lighten at his
steel. See him, amidst the foe, like Colgach's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are some traditions, but, I be∣lieve, of late invention, that this Col∣gach was the same with the Galgacus of Tacitus. He was the ancestor of Gaul, the son of Morni, and appears, from some, really ancient, traditions, to have been king, or Vergobret, of the Caledonians; and hence proceeded the pretensions of the family of Morni to the throne, which created a good deal of disturbance, both to Comhal and his son Fingal. The first was killed in battle by that tribe; and it was after Fin∣gal was grown up, that they were reduced to obedience. Colgach signifies <HI>sicrcely∣looking;</HI> which is a very proper name for a warrior, and is probably the origin of Gal∣gacus; tho' I believe it a matter of mere conjecture, that the Colgach here men∣tioned was the same with that hero.—I cannot help observing, with how much pro∣priety the song of the bards is conducted. Gaul, whose experience might have ren∣dered his conduct cautious in war, has the example of his father, just rushing to bat∣tle, set before his eyes. Fillan, on the other hand, whose youth might make him impetuous and unguarded in action, is put in mind of the sedate and serene behaviour of Fingal upon like occasions.</NOTE> sportful ghost;

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ossian is peculiarly happy, in his de∣scriptions of still life; and these acquire double force, by his placing them near busy and tumultuous scenes. This antithesis serves to animate and heighten the features of poetry.</NOTE>SELMA is opened wide. Bards take the trembling harps.
Ten youths carry the oak of the feast. A distant sun-beam marks
the hill. The dusky waves of the blast fly over the fields of grass.—Why
art thou so silent, Morven?—The king returns with all his
fame. Did not the battle roar; yet peaceful is his brow? It
roared, and Fingal overcame.—Be like thy father, Fillan.</P>
<P>THEY moved beneath the song.—High waved their arms, as
rushy fields, beneath autumnal winds. On Mora stood the king in
arms. Mist flies round his buckler broad; as, aloft, it hung on a
bough, on Cormul's mossy rock.—In silence I stood by Fingal, and
turned my eyes on Cromla's<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The mountain Cromla was in the neighbourhood of the scene of this poem; which was nearly the same with that of Fingal.</NOTE> wood: lest I should behold the host,
and rush amidst my swelling soul. My foot is forward on the
heath. I glittered, tall, in steel: like the falling stream of Tromo,
which nightly winds bind over with ice.—The boy sees it, on high,
gleaming to the early beam: towards it he turns his ear, and wond∣ers
why it is so silent.</P>
<P>NOR bent over a stream is Cathmor, like a youth in a peaceful
field: wide he drew forward the war, a dark and troubled wave.—But
when he beheld Fingal on Mora; his generous pride arose.
“Shall the chief of Atha fight, and no king in the field? Fol∣dath
lead my people forth. Thou art a beam of fire.”</P>
<P>FORTH-ISSUED the chief of Moma, like a cloud, the robe of
ghosts. He drew his sword, a flame, from his side; and bade the

around. Haughty is his stride before them: his red eye rolls in
wrath.—He called the chief of Dunratho<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dun-ratho, <HI>a hill, with a plain on its top.</HI> Corm-uil, <HI>blue eye.</HI> Foldath dis∣patches, here, Cormul to lie in ambush behind the army of the Caledonians. This speech suits well with the character of Foldath, which is, throughout, haughty and presumptuous. Towards the latter end of this speech, we find the opinion of the times, concerning the unhappiness of the souls of those who were buried without the funeral song. This doctrine, no doubt, was inculcated by the bards, to make their order respectable and necessary.</NOTE>; and his words were
heard.</P>
<P>CORMUL, thou beholdest that path. It winds green behind the
foe. Place thy people there; lest Morven should escape from my
sword.—Bards of green-valleyed Erin, let no voice of yours arise.
The sons of Morven must fall without song. They are the foes of
Cairbar. Hereafter shall the traveller meet their dark, thick mist
on Lena, where it wanders, with their ghosts, beside the reedy
lake. Never shall they rise, without song, to the dwelling of
winds.</P>
<P>CORMUL darkened, as he went: behind him rushed his tribe.
They sunk beyond the rock: Gaul spoke to Fillan of Moruth; as
his eye pursued the course of the dark-eyed king of Dunratho.</P>
<P>THOU beholdest the steps of Cormul; let thine arm be strong.
When he is low, son of Fingal, remember Gaul in war. Here I
fall forward into battle, amidst the ridge of shields.</P>
<P>THE sign of death arose: the dreadful sound of Morni's shield.
Gaul poured his voice between. Fingal rose, high on Mora. He
<PB N="54" REF="91"/>
saw them, from wing to wing, bending in the strife. Gleaming,
on his own dark hill, the strength<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the <HI>strength of Atha,</HI> is meant Cathmor. The expression is common in Homer, and other ancient poets.</NOTE> of Atha stood.—They<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The two kings.</NOTE> were
like two spirits of heaven, standing each on his gloomy cloud;
when they pour abroad the winds, and lift the roaring seas. The
blue-tumbling of waves is before them, marked with the paths of
whales. Themselves are calm and bright; and the gale lifts their
locks of mist.</P>
<P>WHAT beam of light hangs high in air? It is Morni's dread∣ful
sword.—Death is strewed on thy paths, O Gaul; thou foldest
them together in thy rage.—Like a young oak falls Tur-lathon<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tur-lathon,</HI> broad trunk of a tree. <HI>Móruth,</HI> great stream. <HI>Oichaoma,</HI> mild maid. <HI>Dun lora,</HI> the hill of the noisy stream. <HI>Duth-caron,</HI> dark-brown man.</NOTE>,
with his branches round him. His high-bosomed spouse stretches
her white arms, in dreams, to the returning king, as she sleeps by
gurgling Moruth, in her disordered locks. It is his ghost, Oicho∣ma;
the chief is lowly laid. Hearken not to the winds for Tur∣lathon's
echoing shield.—It is pierced, by his streams, and its sound
is past away.</P>
<P>NOT peaceful is the hand of Foldath: he winds his course in
blood. Connal met him in fight; they mixed their clanging steel.—Why
should mine eyes behold them! Connal, thy locks are grey.—Thou
wert the friend of strangers, at the moss-covered rock of
Dun-lora. When the skies were rolled together; then thy feast
was spread. The stranger heard the winds without; and rejoiced
at thy burning oak.—Why, son of Duth-caron, art thou laid in
blood! The blasted tree bends above thee: thy shield lies broken
<PB N="55" REF="92"/>
near. Thy blood mixes with the stream; thou breaker of the
shields!</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poet speaks in his own person.</NOTE> I TOOK the spear, in my wrath; but Gaul rushed forward
on the foe. The feeble pass by his side; his rage is turned on Mo∣ma's
chief. Now they had raised their deathful spears: unseen an
arrow came. It pierced the hand of Gaul; his steel fell sound∣ing
to earth.—Young Fillan came<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fillan had been dispatched by Gaul to oppose Cormul, who had been sent by Foldath to lie in ambush behind the Caledo∣nian army.

The poet being intent upon the main action, passes over slightly this seat of Fillan.</NOTE>, with Cormul's shield, and
stretched it large before the king. Foldath sent his shout abroad,
and kindled all the field: as a blast that lifts the broad-winged flame,
over Lumon's<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lumon, <HI>bending hill;</HI> a mountain in Inis-huna, or that part of South-Britain which is over-against the Irish coast.</NOTE> echoing groves.</P>

not too far, my hero, I cannot lift the spear to aid.
I stand harmless in battle: but my voice shall be poured abroad.—The
sons of Morven shall hear, and remember my former deeds.</P>
<P>HIS terrible voice rose on the wind, the host bend forward in the
fight. Often had they heard him, at Strumon, when he called
them to the chace of the hinds.—Himself stood tall, amidst the
war, as an oak in the skirts of a storm, which now is clothed,
<PB N="56" REF="93"/>
on high, in mist: then shews its broad, waving head; the musing
hunter lists his eye from his own rushy field.</P>
<P>MY soul pursues thee, O Fillan, thro' the path of thy fame.
Thou rolledst the foe before thee.—Now Foldath, perhaps, would
fly; but night came down with its clouds; and Cathmor's horn
was heard from high. The sons of Morven heard the voice of
Fingal, from Mora's gathered mist. The bards poured their song,
like dew, on the returning war.</P>
<P>WHO comes from Strumon, they said, amidst her wandering
locks? She is mournful in her steps, and lifts her blue eyes towards
Erin. Why art thou sad, Evir-choma<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Evir-choama, <HI>mild and stately maid,</HI> the wife of Gaul. She was the daughter of Casdu-conglas, chief of I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dronlo, one of the Hebrides.</NOTE>? Who is like thy chief in
renown? He descended dreadful to battle; he returns, like a light
from a cloud. He lifted the sword in wrath: they shrunk before
blue-shielded Gaul!</P>
<P>JOY, like the rustling gale, comes on the soul of the king. He
remembers the battles of old; the days, wherein his fathers fought.
The days of old return on Fingal's mind, as he beholds the renown
of his son. As the sun rejoices, from his cloud, over the tree his
beams have raised, as it shakes its lonely head on the heath; so joy∣ful
is the king over Fillan.</P>
<P>AS the rolling of thunder on hills, when Lara's fields are still

ear. They return with their sound, like eagles to their dark∣browed

friends.—The head of one tree is low: the squally wind pours in
on Selma.—Where is the chief of Dun-lora? Ought he to be

It is certain, that every province, if not every small district, had its own king. One of these petty princes assumed, at times, the title of king of Ireland, and, on account of his supe∣rior force, or in cases of publick danger, was acknowledged by the rest as such; but the succession, from father to son, does not appear to have been established.—It was the divisions amongst themselves, aris∣ing from the bad constitution of their go∣vernment, that, at last, subjected the Irish to a foreign yoke.</NOTE> shone in his own strife, bright as the

forms of his fathers. But, far before the rest, Duth-caron hewed
down the foe. Nor slept the arm of Connal, by his father's side.
Atha prevailed on the plain: like scattered mist, fled the people of
Ullin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants of Ullin or Ulster, who were of the race of the Caledonians, seem, alone, to have been the firm friends to the succession in the family of Conar. The Firbolg were only subject to them by constraint, and embraced every oppor∣tunity to throw off their yoke.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEN rose the sword of Duth-caron, and the steel of broad∣shielded
Connal. They shaded their flying friends, like two rocks
with their heads of pine.—Night came down on Duth-ula: silent
strode the chiefs over the field. A mountain-stream roared across
the path, nor could Duth-caron bound over its course.—Why stands
my father? said Connal.—I hear the rushing foe.</P>
<P>FLY, Connal, he said; thy father's strength begins to fail.—I
come wounded from battle; here let me rest in night.—“But thou
shalt not remain alone, said Connal's bursting sigh. My shield is an
eagle's wing to cover the king of Dun-lora.” He bends dark above
the chief; the mighty Duth-caron dies.</P>
<P>DAY rose, and night returned. No lonely bard appeared, deep∣musing
on the heath: and could Connal leave the tomb of his fa∣ther,
<PB N="60" REF="97"/>
till he should receive his fame?—He bent the bow against
the roes of Duth-ula; he spread the lonely feast.—Seven nights he
laid his head on the tomb, and saw his father in his dreams. He
saw him rolled, dark, in a blast, like the vapor of reedy Lego.—At

Part of an old poem, on the loves of Fingal and Ros-crana, is still pre∣served, and goes under the name of this Colgan; but whether it is of his compo∣sition, or the production of a latter age, I shall not pretend to determine. Be that as it will, it appears, from the obsolete phrases which it contains, to be very an∣cient; and its poetical merit may perhaps excuse me, for laying a translation of it be∣fore the reader. What remains of the poem is a dialogue, in a lyric measure, be∣tween Fingal and Ros-cràna, the daughter of Cormac. She begins with a soliloquy, which is overheard by Fingal.</P>

<P>Fingal, as we learn from the episode, with which the fourth book begins, un∣dertook an expedition into Ireland, to aid Cormac Mac-conar against the insurrec∣tions of the Fir-bolg. It was then he saw, fell in love with, and married Ros-crána, the daughter of Cormac.—Some tradi∣tions give this poem to Ossian; but, from several circumstances, I conclude it to be an imitation, but a very happy one, of the manner of that poet.—The elegance of the sentiment, and beauty of the imagery, however, refer the composition of it to an aera of remote antiquity; for the nearer we approach to our own times, the less beautiful are the compositions of the bards.</P>

Duth-caron received his fame, and brightened, as he rose on the

<P>PLEASANT to the ear, said Fingal, is the praise of the kings
of men; when their bows are strong in battle; when they soften
at the sight of the sad.—Thus let my name be renowned, when
bards shall lighten my rising soul. Carril, son of Kinfena; take
the bards and raise a tomb. To night let Connal dwell, within his
narrow house: let not the soul of the valiant wander on the winds.—Faint
glimmers the moon on Moi-lena, thro' the broad-headed
groves of the hill: raise stones, beneath its beams, to all the fallen
in war.—Tho' no chiefs were they, yet their hands were strong
in fight. They were my rock in danger: the mountain from which
I spread my eagle-wings.—Thence am I renowned: Carril forget
not the low.</P>
<P>LOUD, at once, from the hundred bards, rose the song of the
tomb. Carril strode before them, they are the murmur of streams
<PB N="62" REF="99"/>
behind him. Silence dwells in the vales of Moi-lena, where each,
with its own dark stream, is winding between the hills. I heard
the voice of the bards, lessening, as they moved along. I leaned
forward from my shield; and felt the kindling of my soul. Half∣formed
the words of my song, burst forth upon the wind. So
hears a tree, on the vale, the voice of spring around: it pours its
green leaves to the sun, and shakes its lonely head. The hum of
the mountain bee is near it; the hunter sees it, with joy, from the
blasted heath.</P>
<P>YOUNG Fillan, at a distance stood. His helmet lay glittering on
the ground. His dark hair is loose to the balst: a beam of light
is Clatho's son. He heard the words of the king, with joy; and
leaned forward on his spear.</P>
<P>MY son, said car-borne Fingal; I saw thy deeds, and my soul was
glad. The fame of our fathers, I said, bursts from its gathered
cloud.—Thou art brave, son of Clatho; but headlong in the strife.
So did not Fingal advance, tho' he never feared a foe.—Let thy peo∣ple
be a ridge behind; they are thy strength in the field.—Then
shalt thou be long renowned, and behold the tombs of thy fathers.
The memory of the past returns, my deeds in other years: when
first I descended from ocean on the green-valleyed isle.—We bend
towards the voice of the king. The moon looks abroad from her
cloud. The grey-skirted mist is near, the dwelling of the ghosts.</P>

<Q>THE second night continues. Fingal relates, at the feast, his own first ex∣pedition
into Ireland, and his marriage with Ros-crána, the daughter of Cor∣mac,
king of that island.—The Irish chiefs convene in the presence of Cath∣mor.
The situation of the king described. The story of Sul-malla, the daughter
of Conmor, king of Inis-huna, who, in the disguise of a young warrior, had fol∣lowed
Cathmor to the war. The sullen behaviour of Foldath, who had commanded
in the battle of the preceding day, renews the difference between him and Malthos;
but Cathmor, interposing, ends it. The chiefs feast, and hear the song of Fonar
the bard. Cathmor returns to rest, at a distance from the army. The ghost of his
brother Cairbar appears to him in a dream; and obscurely foretels the issue of the
war.—The soliloquy of the king. He discovers Sul-malla. Morning comes. Her
soliloquy closes the book.</Q>

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This episode has an immediate con∣nection with the story of Connal and Duth∣caron, in the latter end of the third book. Fingal, sitting beneath an oak, near the palace of Selma, discovers Connal just land∣ing from Ireland. The danger which threatened Cormac king of Ireland induces him to sail immediately to that island.—The story is introduced, by the king, as a pattern for the future behaviour of Fillan, whose rashness in the preceding battle is reprimanded.</NOTE> BENEATH an oak, said the king, I sat on Selma's streamy
rock, when Connal rose, from the sea, with the broken
spear of Duth-caron. Far-distant stood the youth, and turned away
his eyes; for he remembered the steps of his father, on his own
green hills. I darkened in my place: dusky thoughts rolled over
my soul. The kings of Erin rose before me. I half-unsheathed
my sword.—Slowly approached the chiefs; they lifted up their silent
eyes. Like a ridge of clouds, they wait for the bursting forth of
my voice: it was, to them, a wind from heaven to roll the mist
away.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="103"/>
I BADE my white sails to rise, before the roar of Cona's wind.
Three hundred youths looked, from their waves, on Fingal's bossy
shield. High on the mast it hung, and marked the dark-blue sea.—But
when the night came down, I struck, at times, the warning
boss: I struck, and looked on high, for fiery-haired Ul-erin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ul-erin, <HI>the guide to Ireland,</HI> a star known by that name in the days of Fin∣gal, and very useful to those who sailed, by night, from the Hebrides, or Caledonia, to the coast of Ulster. We find, from this passage, that navigation was conside∣rably advanced, at this time, among the Caledonians.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOR wanting was the star of heaven: it travelled red between
the clouds: I pursued the lovely beam, on the faint-gleaming deep.—With
morning, Erin rose in mist. We came into the bay of
Moi-lena, where its blue waters tumbled, in the bosom of echoing
woods.—Here Cormac, in his secret hall, avoided the strength of
Colc-ulla. Nor he alone avoids the foe: the blue eye of Ros-crana
is there: Ros-crana<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Ros-crána, <HI>the beam of the rising sun;</HI> she was the mother of Ossian. The Irish bards relate strange fictions concerning this princess. The character given of her here, and in other poems of Ossian, does not tally with their accounts. Their stories, however, concerning Fingal, if they mean him by <HI>Fion Mac-Comnal,</HI> are so inconsist∣ent and notoriously fabulous, that they do not deserve to be mentioned; for they evi∣dently bear, along with them, the marks of late invention.</P></NOTE>, white-handed maid, the daughter of
the king.</P>
<P>GREY, on his pointless spear, came forth the aged steps of Cor∣mac.
He smiled, from his waving locks, but grief was in his
soul. He saw us few before him, and his sigh arose.—I see the
arms of Trenmor, he said; and these are the steps of the king!
Fingal! thou art a beam of light to Cormac's darkened soul.—Early
<PB N="67" REF="104"/>

like the roar of streams in the land, son of car-borne Comhal.</P>
<P>YET they may be rolled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cormac had said that the foes were <HI>like the rear of streams,</HI> and Fingal conti∣nues the metaphor. The speech of the young hero is spirited, and consistent with that sedate intrepidity, which eminently distinguishes his character throughout.</NOTE> away, I said in my rising soul. We
are not of the race of the feeble, king of blue-shielded hosts.
Why should fear come amongst us, like a ghost of night? The
soul of the valiant grows, as foes increase in the field. Roll no
darkness, king of Erin, on the young in war.</P>
<P>THE bursting tears of the king came down. He seized my hand
in silence.—“Race of the daring Trenmor, I roll no cloud be∣fore
thee. Thou burnest in the fire of thy fathers. I behold thy
fame. It marks thy course in battles, like a stream of light.—But
wait the coming of Cairbar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cairbar, the son of Cormac, was af∣terwards king of Ireland. His reign was short. He was succeeded by his son Ar∣tho, the father of that Cormac who was murdered by Cairbar the son of Borbar∣duthul.—Cairbar, the son of Cormac, long after his son Artho was grown to man's estate, had, by his wife Beltanno, another son, whose name was Ferad-artho.—He was the only one remaining of the race of Conar the first king of Ireland, when Fin∣gal's expedition against Cairbar the son of Borbar-duthul happened. See more of Ferad-artho in the eighth book.</NOTE>: my son must join thy sword.
He calls the sons of Ullin, from all their distant streams.”</P>
<P>WE came to the hall of the king, where it rose in the midst of
rocks: rocks, on whose dark sides, were the marks of streams of old.
Broad oaks bend around with their moss: the thick birch waves
its green head. Half-hid, in her shady grove, Ros-crana raised the
song. Her white hands rose on the harp. I beheld her blue-roll∣ling

eyes. She was like a spirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The attitude of Ros-crana is aptly illustrated by this simile; for the ideas of those times, concerning the spirits of the deceased, were not so gloomy and dis∣agreeable, as those of succeeding ages. The spirits of women, it was supposed, re∣tained that beauty, which they possessed while living, and transported themselves, from place to place, with that gliding mo∣tion, which Homer ascribes to the gods. The descriptions which poets, less ancient than Ossian, have left us of those beautiful figures, that appeared sometimes on the hills, are elegant and picturesque. They compare them to the <HI>rain-bow on streams;</HI> or, <HI>the gliding of sun-beams on the hills.</HI> I shall here translate a passage of an old song, where both these beautiful images are men∣tioned together.</P>
<P>A chief who lived three centuries ago, returning from the war, understood that his wife or mistress was dead. The bard introduces him speaking the following so∣liloquy, when he came, within sight of the place, where he had left her, at his depar∣ture.</P>
<P>“My soul darkens in sorrow. I be∣hold not the smoak of my hall. No grey dog bounds at my streams. Silence dwells in the valley of trees.</P>
<P>“Is that a rain-bow on Crunath? It flies:—and the sky is dark. Again, thou movest, bright, on the heath, thou sun∣beam cloathed in a shower!—Hah! it is she, my love: her gliding course on the bosom of winds!”</P>
<P>In succeeding times the beauty of Ros-crana passed into a proverb; and the high∣est compliment, that could be paid to a woman, was to compare her person with <HI>the daughter of Cormac.</HI></P>

of a cloud.</P>
<P>THREE days we feasted at Moi-lena: she rose bright amidst my
troubled soul.—Cormac beheld me dark. He gave the white-bo∣somed
maid.—She came with bending eye, amidst the wandering
of her heavy locks.—She came.—Straight the battle roared.—Colc-ulla
came: I took my spear. My sword rose, with my peo∣ple,
against the ridgy foe. Alnecma fled. Colc-ulla fell. Fingal
returned with fame.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="106"/>
HE is renowned, O Fillan, who fights, in the strength of his
people. The bard pursues his steps, thro' the land of the foe.—But
he who fights alone; few are his deeds to other times. He
shines, to-day, a mighty light. To-morrow, he is low. One song
contains his fame. His name is on one dark field. He is forgot,
but where his tomb sends forth the tufts of grass.</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of Fingal, on Mora of the roes. Three
bards, from the rock of Cormul, poured down the pleasant song.
Sleep descended, in the sound, on the broad-skirted host. Carril
returned, with the bards, from the tomb of Dun-lora's king. The
voice of morning shall not come, to the dusky bed of the hero.
No more shalt thou hear the tread of roes, around thy narrow
house.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poet changes the scene to the Irish camp. The images introduced here are magnificent, and have that sort of <HI>terrible beauty,</HI> if I may use the expression, which occurs so frequently in the compo∣sitions of Ossian. The troubled motion of the army, and the sedate and careless attitude of Cathmor, form a contrast, which, as I have before remarked, height∣ens the features of description, and is cal∣culated to enliven poetry.</NOTE> As roll the troubled clouds, round a meteor of night, when
they brighten their sides, with its light, along the heaving sea: so
gathered Erin, around the gleaming form of Atha's king. He, tall
in the midst, careless lifts, at times, his spear: as swells or falls the
sound of Fonar's distant harp.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In order to illustrate this passage, I shall give, here, the history on which it is founded, as I have gathered it from other poems. The nation of the Firbolg who inhabited the south of Ireland, being originally descended from the Belgae, who possessed the south and south-west coast of Britain, kept up, for many ages, an ami∣cable correspondence with their mother-country; and sent aid to the British Belgae, when they were pressed by the Romans or other new-comers from the continent. Con-mor, king of Inis-huna, (that part of South-Britain which is over-against the Irish coast) being attacked, by what ene∣my is not mentioned, sent for aid to Cair∣bar, lord of Atha, the most potent chief of the Firbolg. Cairbar dispatched his brother Cathmor to the assistance of Con-mor. Cathmor, after various vicissitudes of fortune, put an end to the war, by the total defeat of the enemies of Inis huna, and returned in triumph to the residence of Con-mor. There, at a feast, Sul-malla, the daughter of Con-mor, fell desperately in love with Cathmor, who, before her passion was disclosed, was recalled to Ire∣land by his brother Cairbar, upon the news of the intended expedition of Fingal, to re-establish the family of Conar on the Irish throne.—The wind being contrary, Cath∣mor remained, for three days, in a neigh∣bouring bay, during which time Sul-malla disguised herself in the habit of a young warrior, and came to offer him her service, in the war. Cathmor accepted of the pro∣posal failed for Ireland, and arrived in Ulster a few days before the death of Cair∣bar.</NOTE> NEAR him leaned, against a rock, Sul-malla<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sul-malla, <HI>slowly-rolling eyes.</HI> Caon mór, <HI>mild and tall.</HI> Inis-huna, <HI>green island.</HI></NOTE> of blue eyes, the
white-bosomed daughter of Conmor king of Inis-huna. To his
<PB N="70" REF="107"/>
aid came blue-shielded Cathmor, and rolled his foes away. Sul∣malla
beheld him stately in the hall of feasts; nor careless rolled
the eyes of Cathmor on the long-haired maid.</P>
<P>THE third day arose, and Fithil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fithil, <HI>an inferior bard.</HI> It may ei∣ther be taken here for the proper name of a man, or in the literal sense, as the bards were the heralds and messengers of those times. Cathmor, it is probable, was ab∣sent, when the rebellion of his brother Cairbar, and the assassination of Cormac, king of Ireland, happened. The tradi∣tions, which are handed down with the poem, say, that Cathmor and his followers had only arrived, from Inis-huna, three days before the death of Cairbar, which suffi∣ciently clears his character from any impu∣tation of being concerned in the conspi∣racy, with his brother.</NOTE> came from Erin of the
streams. He told of the lifting up of the shield<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The ceremony which was used by Fingal, when he prepared for an expedi∣tion, is related, by Ossian, in one of his lesser poems. A bard, at midnight, went to the hall, where the tribes feasted upon solemn occasions, raised the <HI>war-song,</HI> and thrice called the spirits of their de∣ceased ancestors to come, <HI>on their clouds,</HI> to behold the actions of their children. He then fixed the <HI>shield of Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nmor,</HI> on a tree on the rock of Selma, striking it, at times, with the blunt end of a spear, and singing the war-song between. Thus he did, for three successive nights, and, in the mean time, messengers were dispatched to convene the tribes; or, as Ossian ex∣presses it, <HI>to call them from all their streams.</HI> This phrase alludes to the situation of the residences of the clans, which were ge∣nerally fixed in valleys, where the torrents of the neighbouring mountains were col∣lected into one body, and became <HI>large streams</HI> or rivers.—<HI>The listing up of the shield,</HI> was the phrase for beginning a war.</NOTE> on Morven,
<PB N="71" REF="108"/>
and the danger of red-haired Cairbar. Cathmor raised the sail at
Cluba: but the winds were in other lands. Three days he re∣mained
on the coast, and turned his eyes on Conmor's halls.—He
remembered the daughter of strangers, and his sigh arose.—Now
when the winds awaked the wave: from the hill came a youth in
arms; to lift the sword with Cathmor in his echoing fields.—It
was the white-armed Sul-malla: secret she dwelt beneath her hel∣met.
Her steps were in the path of the king; on him her blue
eyes rolled with joy, when he lay by his roaring streams.—But
Cathmor thought, that, on Lumon, she still pursued the roes; or,
fair on a rock, stretched her white hand to the wind; to feel its
course from Inis-fail, the green dwelling of her love. He had pro∣mised
to return, with his white-bosomed sails.—The maid is near
thee, king of Atha, leaning on her rock.</P>
<P>THE tall forms of the chiefs stood around; all but dark-browed
Foldath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The surly attitude of Foldath is a proper preamble to his after-behaviour. Chaffed with the disappointment of the victory which he promised himself, he be∣comes passionate and over-bearing. The quarrel which succeeds between him and Malthos was, no doubt, introduced by the poet, to raise the character of Cath∣mor, whose superior worth shines forth, in his manly manner of ending the difference between the chiefs.</NOTE>. He stood beneath a distant tree, rolled into his haughty

of a song.—He struck the tree, at length, in wrath; and rushed
before the king.</P>

his fathers; when he touched the harp, in the hall, near his roar∣ing
streams.</P>
<P>KING of Erin, said the youth, now is the time of feasts. Bid
the voice of bards arise, and roll the night away. The soul returns,
from song, more terrible to war.—Darkness settles on Inis-fail: from
hill to hill bend the skirted clouds. Far and grey, on the heath,
the dreadful strides of ghosts are seen: the ghosts of those who
fell bend forward to their song.—Bid thou the harps to rise, and
brighten the dead, on their wandering blasts.</P>
<P>BE all the dead forgot, said Foldath's bursting wrath. Did not
I fail in the field, and shall I hear the song? Yet was not my course
harmless in battle: blood was a stream around my steps. But the
feeble were behind me, and the foe has escaped my sword.—In Clon∣ra's
vale touch thou the harp; let Dura answer to thy voice; while
some maid looks, from the wood, on thy long, yellow locks.—Fly
from Lubar's echoing plain: it is the field of heroes.</P>
<P>KING of Temora<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This speech of Malthos is, through∣out, a severe reprimand to the blustering behaviour of Foldath.

The vulgar, who had no great ability to judge for themselves, received the charac∣ters of their princes, entirely upon the faith of the bards.

did not hear his praise. He lay at the roar of a stream. The

<P>CAIRBAR came to his dreams, half-seen from his low-hung

See the second book, towards the end. In all the poems of Os∣sian, the visit of ghosts, to their living friends, are short, and their language ob∣scure, both which circumstances tend to throw a solemn gloom on these superna∣tural scenes. Towards the latter end of the speech of the ghost of Cairbar, he for∣tels the death of Cathmor, by enumerating those signals which, according to the opi∣nion of the times, preceded the death of a person renowned. It was thought that the ghosts of deceased bards sung, for three nights preceding the death (near the place where his tomb was to be raised) round an unsubstantial figure which represented the body of the person who was to die.</NOTE>.—A blast sustained his dark-skirted cloud; which he seized

words.</P>
<P>Joy meet the soul of Cathmor: his voice was heard on Moi∣lena.
The bard gave his song to Cairbar: he travels on the wind.
My form is in my father's hall, like the gliding of a terrible light,
which winds thro' the desart, in a stormy night.—No bard shall be
wanting at thy tomb, when thou art lowly laid. The sons of
song love the valiant.—Cathmor, thy name is a pleasant gale.—The
mournful sounds arise! On Lubar's field there is a voice!—Louder
still ye shadowy ghosts! the dead were full of fame.—Shrilly swells
the feeble sound.—The rougher blast alone is heard!—Ah, soon is
Cathmor low!</P>
<P>ROLLED into himself he flew, wide on the bosom of his blast.
The old oak felt his departure, and shook its whistling head. The
king started from rest, and took his deathful spear. He lifts his
eyes around. He sees but dark-skirted night.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The soliloquy of Cathmor abounds with that magnanimity and love of fame which constitute the hero. Tho' staggered at first with the prediction of Cairbar's ghost, he soon comforts himself with the agreeable prospect of his future renown; and, like Achilles, prefers a short and glo∣rious life, to an obscure length of years in retirement and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase.</NOTE> IT was the voice of the king; but now his form is gone.

Erin rose around him like the sound of eagle-wings.—Sul-malla

<Q>OSSIAN, after a short address to the harp of Cona, describes the arrangement of both
armies on either side of the river Lubar. Fingal gives the command to Fillan; but,
at the same time, orders Gaul, the son of Morni, who had been wounded in the
hand in the preceding battle, to assist him with his counsel. The army of the Fir-bolg is
commanded by Foldath. The general onset is described. The great actions of
Fillan. He kills Rothmar and Culmin. But when Fillan conquers, in one wing,
Foldath presses hard on the other. He wounds Dermid, the son of Duthno, and puts
the whole wing to flight. Dermid deliberates with himself, and, at last, resolves to
put a stop to the progress of Foldath, by engaging him in single combat.—When the
two chiefs were approaching towards one another, Fillan came suddenly to the re∣lief
of Dermid; engaged Foldath, and killed him. The behaviour of Malthos to∣wards
the fallen Foldath. Fillan puts the whole army of the Fir-bolg to flight. The
book closes with an address to Clatho, the mother of that hero.</Q>

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These abrupt addresses give great life to the poetry of Ossian. They are all in a lyric measure. The old men, who retain, on memory, the compositions of Ossian, shew much satisfaction when they come to those parts of them, which are in rhime, and take great pains to explain their beauties, and inculcate the meaning of their obsolete phrases, on the minds of their hearers. This attachment does not pro∣ceed from the superior beauty of these ly∣ric pieces, but rather from a taste for rhime which the modern bards have established among the highlanders. Having no ge∣nius themselves for the sublime and pathe∣tic, they placed the whole beauty of poetry in the returning harmony of similar sounds. The seducing charms of rhime soon wean∣ed their countrymen from that attach∣ment they long had to the recitative of Ossian: and, tho' they still admired his compositions, their admiration was found∣ed more on his antiquity, and the detail of facts which he gave, than on his poe∣tical excellence. Rhiming, in process of time, became so much reduced into a sys∣tem, and was so universally understood, that every cow-herd composed tolerable verses. These poems, it is true, were a description of nature; but of nature in its rudest form; a group of uninteresting ideas dressed out in the flowing harmony of mo∣notonous verses. Void of merit as those vulgar compositions were, they fell little short of the productions of the regular bards; for when all poetical excellence is confined to sounds alone, it is within the power of every one possessed of a good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar.</NOTE> THOU dweller between the shields that hang, on high,
in Ossian's hall, descend from thy place, O harp, and let

awake the soul of the bard. The murmur of Lora's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lora is often mentioned; it was a small and rapid stream in the neighbour∣hood of Selma. There is no vestige of this name now remaining; tho' it ap∣pears from a very old song, which the translator has seen, that one of the small rivers on the north-west coast was called Lora some centuries ago.</NOTE> stream has
rolled the tale away.—I stand in the cloud of years: few are its
openings towards the past, and when the vision comes it is but
dim and dark.—I hear thee, harp of Cona, my soul returns, like
a breeze, which the sun brings back to the vale, where dwelt the
lazy mist.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From several passage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the poem we may form a distinct idea of the scene of the action of Temora. At a small dis∣tance from one another rose the hills of Mora and Lona; the first possessed by Fin∣gal, the second by the army of Cathmor. Through the intermediate plain ran the small river Lubar, on the banks of which all the battles were fought, excepting that between Cairbar and Oscar, related in the first book. This last mentioned engage∣ment happened, to the north of the hill of Mora, of which Fingal took possession, after the army of Cairbar fell back to that of Cathmor. At some distance, but with∣in sight of Mora, towards the west, Lu∣bar issued from the mountain of Crommal, and, after a short course thro' the plain of Moi-lena, discharged itself into the sea near the field of battle. Behind the moun∣tain of Crommal ran the small stream of Lavath, on the banks of which Ferad-ar∣tho, the son of Cairbre, the only person remaining of the race of Conar, lived con∣cealed in a cave, during the usurpation of Cairbar, the son of Borbar-duthul.</NOTE> LUBAR is bright before me, in the windings of its vale. On
either side, on their hills, rise the tall forms of the kings; their
people are poured around them, bending forward to their words;
as if their fathers spoke, descending from their winds.—But the
<PB N="85" REF="121"/>
kings were like two rocks in the midst, each with its dark head of
pines, when they are seen in the desart, above low-sailing mist.
High on their face are streams, which spread their foam on blasts.</P>
<P>BENEATH the voice of Cathmor poured Erin, like the sound of
flame. Wide they came down to Lubar; before them is the stride
of Foldath. But Cathmor retired to his hill, beneath his bending
oaks. The tumbling of a stream is near the king: he lifts, at
times, his gleaming spear. It was a flame to his people, in the
midst of war. Near him stood the daughter of Con-mor, leaning
on her rock. She did not rejoice over the strife: her soul de∣lighted
not in blood. A valley<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was to this valley Sul-malla retired, during the last and decisive battle between Fingal and Cathmor. It is described in the seventh book, where it is called the vale of Lona, and the residence of a Druid.</NOTE> spreads green behind the hill,
with its three blue streams. The sun is there in silence; and the
dun mountain-roes come down. On these are turned the eyes of
Inis-huna's white-bosomed maid.</P>
<P>FINGAL beheld, on high, the son of Borbar-duthul: he saw the
deep-rolling of Erin, on the darkened plain. He struck that warn∣ing
boss, which bids the people obey; when he sends his chiefs
before them, to the field of renown. Wide rose their spears to the
sun; their echoing shields reply around.—Fear, like a vapor, did
not wind among the host: for he, the king, was near, the strength
of streamy Morven.—Gladness brightened the hero, we heard his
words of joy.</P>
<P>LIKE the coming forth of winds, is the sound of Morven's sons!
They are mountain waters, determined in their course. Hence is
Fingal renowned, and his name in other lands. He was not a
<PB N="86" REF="122"/>
lonely beam in danger; for your steps were always near.—But never
was I a dreadful form, in your presence, darkened into wrath. My
voice was no thunder to your ears: mine eyes sent forth no death.—When
the haughty appeared, I beheld them not. They were
forgot at my feasts: like mist they melted away.—A young beam
is before you: few are his paths to war. They are few, but he is
valiant; defend my dark-haired son. Bring him back with joy:
hereafter he may stand alone. His form is like his fathers: his
soul is a flame of their fire.—Son of car-borne Morni, move be∣hind
the son of Clatho: let thy voice reach his ear, from the skirts
of war. Not unobserved rolls battle, before thee, breaker of the
shields.</P>

The foe may behold it, and think I lift the spear. If I shall fall,
let my tomb be hid in the field; for fall I must without my fame:

between her locks.—Fillan, the mighty behold us; let us not for∣get
the strife. Why should they come, from their hills, to aid our

HE strode onward, with the sound of his shield. My voice pur∣sued
him, as he went. Can the son of Morni fall without his fame
in Erin? But the deeds of the mighty forsake their souls of fire.
They rush careless over the fields of renown: their words are never
heard.—I rejoiced over the steps of the chief: I strode to the
rock of the king, where he sat in his wandering locks, amidst the
mountain-wind.</P>
<P>IN two dark ridges bend the hosts, towards each other, at Lubar.
Here Foldath rose a pillar of darkness: there brightened the youth
of Fillan. Each, with his spear in the stream, sent forth the voice
of war.—Gaul struck the shield of Morven; at once they plunge in
battle.—Steel poured its gleam on steel: like the fall of streams
shone the field, when they mix their foam together, from two dark∣browed
rocks.—Behold he comes the son of fame: he lays the peo∣ple

The places of worship among the Scandi∣navians were originally rude and unadorned. In after ages, when they opened a commu∣nication with other nations, they adopted their manners, and built temples. That at Upsal, in Sweden, was amazingly rich and magnificent. Haquin, of Norway, built one, near Drontheim, little inferior to the former; and it went always under the name of Loden. <HI>Mallet, introduction a l'histoire de Da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>memar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> falls,

earth in their wrath; so fell blue-shielded Rothmar.</P>
<P>NEAR are the steps of Culmin; the youth came, bursting into
tears. Wrathful he cut the wind, ere yet he mixed his strokes
with Fillan. He had first bent the bow with Rothmar, at the rock
of his own blue streams. There they had marked the place of
the roe, as the sun-beam flew over the fern.—Why, son of Cul∣allin,
dost thou rush on that beam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poet, metaphorically, calls Fillan a beam of light. Culmin, mentioned here, was the son of Clonmar, chief of Strutha, by the beautiful Cul-allin.

The attitude of the fallen youth, and Fillan's reflexions over him, are natural and judicious, and come sorci∣bly back on the mind, when we consider, that the supposed situation of the father of Culmin, was so similar to that of Fingal, after the death of Fillan himself.</NOTE> are howling in their

<P>AS a roe, pierced in secret, lies panting, by her wonted streams,
the hunter looks over her feet of wind, and remembers her stately
bounding before; so lay the son of Cul-allin, beneath the eye of
Fillan. His hair is rolled in a little stream: his blood wandered on
his shield. Still his hand held the sword, that failed him in the
midst of danger.—Thou art fallen, said Fillan, ere yet thy fame
was heard.—Thy father sent thee to war: he expects to hear thy
deeds. He is grey, perhaps, at his streams, and his eyes are to∣wards
Moi-lena. But thou shalt not return, with the spoil of the
fallen foe.</P>
<P>FILLAN poured the flight of Erin before him, over the echo∣ing
heath.—But, man on man, fell Morven before the dark-red
rage of Foldath; for, far on the field, he poured the roar of half
his tribes. Dermid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Dermid is, probably, the same with <HI>Dermid O duine,</HI> who makes so great a figure in the fictions of the Irish bards.</NOTE> stood before him in wrath: the sons of

on earth. Beside some fen shall his tomb be seen. It shall rise
without a song. His ghost shall hover in mist over the reedy
pool.</P>
<P>MALTHOS heard, with darkening doubt; he rolled his silent
eyes.—He knew the pride of Foldath, and looked up to the king

In the days of Conar, the son of Trenmor, the first king of Ireland, Clono passed over into that kingdom, from Cale∣donia, to aid Conar against the Fir-bolg. Being remarkable for the beauty of his per∣son, he soon drew the attention of Sulmin, the young wise of an Irish chief. She dis∣closed her passion, which was not properly returned by the Caledonian. The lady sickened, thro' disappointment, and her love for Clono came to the ears of her husband. Fired with jealousy, he vowed revenge. Clono, to avoid his rage, de∣parted from Temora, in order to pass over into Scotland; and, being benighted in the valley mentioned here, he laid him down to sleep. <HI>There,</HI> (to use the words of the poet) <HI>Lethmal descended in the dreams of Clono; and told him that danger was near.</HI> For the reader's amusement I shall translate the vision, which does not want poetical merit.</P>

<P>As Clono prepared to depart, the hus∣band of Sulmin came up, with his nu∣merous attendants. Clono defended him∣self, but, after a gallant resistance, he was overpowered and slain.

<P>HE took his spear, with dreadful joy. The son of Morni came.
—“Stay, son of Duthno, stay thy speed; thy steps are marked

The incidents which Ossian has chosen to diversify his battles, are interesting, and never fail to awaken our attention. I know that want of particula∣rity in the wounds, and diversity in the fall of those that are slain, have been among the objections, started, to the poe∣tical merit of Ossian's poems. The criticism, without partiality I may say it, is unjust, for our poet has introduced as great a variety of this sort, as he, with proprie∣ty, could within the compass of so short poems. It is confessed, that Homer has a greater variety of deaths than any other poet that ever appeared. His great know∣ledge in anatomy can never be disputed; but, I am far from thinking, that his bat∣tles, even with all their novelty of wounds, are the most beautiful parts of his poems. The human mind dwells with disgust upon a protracted scene of carnage; and, tho' the introduction of the terrible is necessary to the grandeur of heroic poetry, yet I am convinced, that a medium ought to be ob∣served.</NOTE>.</P>

HE slowly rose against the hill, and saw the troubled field.
The gleaming ridges of the fight, disjoined and broken round.—As
distant fires, on heath by night, now seem as lost in smoak,
then rearing their red streams on the hill, as blow or cease the
winds: so met the intermitting war the eye of broad-shielded Der∣mid.
—Thro' the host are the strides of Foldath, like some dark
ship on wintry waves, when it issues from between two isles, to
sport on echoing seas.</P>
<P>DERMID, with rage, beheld his course. He strove to rush
along. But he failed in the midst of his steps; and the big tear
came down.—He sounded his father's horn; and thrice struck his
bossy shield. He called thrice the name of Foldath, from his roar∣ing
tribes.—Foldath, with joy, beheld the chief: he lifted high his
bloody spear.—As a rock is marked with streams, that fell troubled
down its side in a storm; so, streaked with wandering blood, is the
dark form of Moma.</P>
<P>THE host, on either side, withdrew from the contending of
kings.—They raised, at once, their gleaming points.—Rushing
came Fillan of Moruth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rapidity of this verse, which in∣deed is but faintly imitated in the transla∣tion, is amazingly expressive in the origi∣nal. One hears the very rattling of the armour of Fillan. The intervention of Fillan is necessary here; for, as Dermid was wounded before, it is not to be sup∣posed, he could be a match for Foldath▪ Fillan is often, poetically, called the <HI>son of Moruth,</HI> from a stream of that name in Morven, near which he was born.</NOTE>. Three paces back Foldath withdrew;

cloud, to save the wounded hero.—Growing in his pride he stood,

<P>As meet two broad-winged eagles, in their sounding strife, on
the winds: so rushed the two chiefs, on Moi-lena, into gloomy
fight.—By turns are the steps of the kings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fingal and Cathmor.</NOTE> forward on their
rocks; for now the dusky war seemed to descend on their swords.—Cathmor
feels the joy of warriors, on his mossy hill: their joy in
secret when dangers rise equal to their souls. His eye is not turned
on Lubar, but on Morven's dreadful king; for he beheld him, on
Mora, rising in his arms.</P>
<P>FOLDATH<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The fall of Foldath, if we may be∣lieve tradition, was predicted to him, be∣fore he had left his own country to join Cairbar, in his designs on the Irish throne. He went to the cave of Moma, to enquire of the spirits of his fathers, concerning the success of the enterprise of Cairbar. The responses of oracles are always attended with obscurity, and liable to a double meaning: Foldath, therefore, put a favour∣able interpretation on the prediction, and pursued his adopted plan of aggrandizing himself with the family of Atha. I shall, here, translate the answer of <HI>the ghosts of his ancestors,</HI> as it is handed down by tra∣dition. Whether the legend is really an∣cient, or the invention of a late age, I shall not pretend to determine, tho', from the phraseology, I should suspect the last.</P>

<P>Cloncath, or <HI>reflected beam,</HI> say my tra∣ditional authors, was the name of the sword of Fillan; so that it was, in the la∣tent signification of the word <HI>Clon-cath,</HI> that the deception lay. My principal rea∣son for introducing this note, is, that if this tradition is equally ancient with the poem, which, by the bye, is doubtful, it serves to shew, that the religion of the Fir-bolg differed from that of the Caledo∣nians, as we never find the latter enquiring of the spirits of their deceased ancestors.</P></NOTE> fell on his shield; the spear of Fillan pierced the

youth, the love of heroes lay. Dark-bending, from the skirts of
the wood, her wounded father came. He appeared, at times, then
seemed as hid in mist.—Bursting into tears she rose: she knew
that the chief was low. To her came a beam from his soul when
folded in its storms. Thou wert the last of his race, blue-eyed

There is a sort of elo∣quence, in silence with propriety. A mi∣nute detail of the circumstances of an im∣portant scene is generally cold and insipid.

<P>The address to Clatho, the mother of Fillan, which concludes this book, if we regard the versification of the original, is one of the most beautiful passages in the poem.

<P>DEEP-FOLDED in red war, the battle rolls against his side. Or,

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>THIS book opens with a speech of Fingal, who sees Cathmor descending to the assist∣ance
of his flying army. The king dispatches Ossian to the relief of Fillan.
He himself retires behind the rock of Cormul, to avoid the sight of the engage∣ment
between his son and Cathmor. Ossian advances. The descent of Cathmor
described. He rallies the army, renews the battle, and, before Ossian could arrive,
engages Fillan himself. Upon the approach of Ossian, the combat between the two
heroes ceases. Ossian and Cathmor prepare to fight, but night coming on prevents
them. Ossian returns to the place where Cathmor and Fillan fought. He finds
Fillan mortally wounded, and leaning against a rock. Their discourse. Fillan dies:
his body is laid, by Ossian, in a neighbouring cave.—The Caledonian army return
to Fingal. He questions them about his son, and, understanding that he was killed,
retires, in silence, to the rock of Cormul.—Upon the retreat of the army of Fingal,
the Fir-bolg advance. Cathmor finds Bran, one of the dogs of Fingal, lying on the
shield of Fillan, before the entrance of the cave, where the body of that hero lay.
His reflexions thereupon. He returns, in a melancholy mood, to his army. Mal∣thos
endeavours to comfort him, by the example of his father Borbar-duthul. Cath∣mor
retires to rest. The song of Sul-malla concludes the book, which ends about
the middle of the third night, from the opening of the poem.</Q>

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have, in a preceding note, observed that the abrupt manner of Ossian partakes much of the nature of the Drama. The opening of this book is a confirmation of the justness of this observation. Instead of a long detail of circumstances delivered by the poet himself, about the descent of Cathmor from the hill, whereon he sat to behold the battle, he puts the narration in the mouth of Fingal. The relation ac∣quires importance from the character of the speaker. The concern which Fingal shews, when he beholds the <HI>rising of Cath∣mor,</HI> raises our ideas of the valour of that hero to the highest pitch. The apostro∣phes's which are crowded on one ano∣ther, are expressive of the perturbation of Fingal's soul, and of his fear for his son, who was not a match for the king of Ireland. The conduct of the poet in removing Fingal from the sight of the engagement, is very judicious; for the king might be induced, from seeing the inequa∣lity of the combat between Fillan and Cath∣mor, to come to battle himself, and so bring about the catastrophe of the poem prematurely. The removal of Fingal af∣fords room to the poet for introducing those affecting scenes which immediately succeed, and are among the chief beauties of the poem.—They who can deny art to Ossian, in conducting the catastrophe of Temora, are certainly more prejudiced against the age he lived in, than is consistent with good sense. I cannot finish this note, without observing the delicacy and proprie∣ty of Fingal's address to Ossian. By the appellation of the <HI>father of Oscar,</HI> he raises, at once, in the mind of the hero, all that tenderness for the safety of Fillan, which a situation so similar to that of his own son, when he fell, was capable to suggest.</NOTE> CATHMOR rises on his echoing hill! Shall Fingal take
the sword of Luno? But what should become of thy fame,
son of white-bosomed Clatho? Turn not thine eyes from Fingal,
daughter of Inistore. I shall not quench thy early beam; it shines
<PB N="100" REF="136"/>
along my soul.—Rise, wood-skirted Mora, rise between the war
and me! Why should Fingal behold the strife, lest his dark∣haired
warrior should fall!—Amidst the song, O Carril, pour the
sound of the trembling harp: here are the voices of rocks, and
bright tumbling of waters. Father of Oscar lift the spear; defend
the young in arms. Conceal thy steps from Fillan's eyes.—He must
not know that I doubt his steel.—No cloud of mine shall rise, my
son, upon thy soul of fire!</P>
<P>HE sunk behind his rock, amidst the sound of Carril's song.—Brightening,
in my growing soul, I took the spear of Temora<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>spear of Temora</HI> was that which Oscar had received, in a present, from Cormac, the son of Artho, king of Ire∣land. It was of it that Cairbar made the pretext for quarrelling with Oscar, at the feast, in the first book. After the death of Oscar we find it always in the hands of Ossian. It is said, in another poem, that it was preserved, as a relique, at Te∣mora, from the days of Conar, the son of Trenmor, the first king of Ireland.</NOTE>
I saw, along Moi-lena, the wild tumbling of battle, the strife of
death, in gleaming rows, disjoined and broken round. Fillan is a
beam of fire; from wing to wing is his wasteful course. The
ridges of war melt before him. They are rolled, in smoak, from
the fields.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="137"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The appearance of Cathmor is mag∣nificent: his unconcerned gait, and the effect which his very voice has upon his flying army, are circumstances calcu∣lated to raise our ideas of his superior me∣rit and valour. Ossian is very impartial, with regard to his enemies: this, how∣ever, cannot be said of other poets of great eminence and unquestioned merit. Mil∣ton, of the first class of poets, is undoubt∣edly the most irreprehensible in this re∣spect; for we always pity or admire his Devil, but seldom detest him, even tho' he is the arch enemy of our species. Man∣kind generally take sides with the unfortu∣nate and daring. It is from this disposition that many readers, tho' otherwise good christians, have almost wished success to Satan, in his desperate and daring voyage from hell, through the regions of chaos and night.</NOTE>Now is the coming forth of Cathmor, in the armour of kings!
Dark-rolled the eagle's wing, above his helmet of fire. Uncon∣cerned
are his steps, as if they were to the chace of Atha. He
raised, at times, his terrible voice; Erin, abashed, gathered round.
—Their souls returned back, like a stream: they wondered at the
steps of their fear: for he rose, like the beam of the morning on a
haunted heath: the traveller looks back, with bending eye, on the
field of dreadful forms.</P>
<P>SUDDEN, from the rock of Moi-lena, are Sul-malla's trembling
steps. An oak took the spear from her hand; half-bent she loosed the
lance: but then are her eyes on the king, from amidst her wander∣ing
locks.—No friendly strife is before thee; no light contending of
bows, as when the youth of Cluba<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Clu-ba, <HI>winding bay;</HI> an arm of the sea in Inis-huna, or the western coast of South-Britain. It was in this bay that Cathmor was wind-bound when Sul-mal∣la came, in the disguise of a young war∣rior, to accompany him in his voyage to Ireland. Conmor, the father of Sul-malla, as we learn from her soliloquy, at the close of the fourth book, was dead before the departure of his daughter.</NOTE> came forth beneath the eye
of Conmor.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="138"/>
As the rock of Runo, which takes the passing clouds for its
robe, seems growing, in gathered darkness, over the streamy heath;
so seemed the chief of Atha taller, as gathered his people round.
—As different blasts fly over the sea, each behind its dark-blue
wave, so Cathmor's words, on every side, poured his warriors forth.
—Nor silent on his hill is Fillan; he mixed his words with his
echoing shield. An eagle he seemed, with sounding wings, calling
the wind to his rock, when he sees the coming forth of the roes,
on Lutha's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lutha was the name of a valley in Morven, in the days of Ossian. There dwelt Toscar the son of Conloch, the fa∣ther of Malvina, who, upon that account, is often called <HI>the maid of Lutha.</HI> Lu∣tha signifies <HI>swift stream.</HI></NOTE> rushy field.</P>
<P>Now they bent forward in battle: death's hundred voices rose;
for the kings, on either side, were like fires on the souls of the
people.—I bounded along; high rocks and trees rushed tall between
the war and me.—But I heard the noise of steel, between my clang∣ing
arms. Rising, gleaming, on the hill, I beheld the backward
steps of hosts: their backward steps, on either side, and wildly-look∣ing
eyes. The chiefs were met in dreadful fight; the two blue∣shielded
kings. Tall and dark, thro' gleams of steel, are seen the
striving heroes.—I rushed.—My fears for Fillan flew, burning across
my soul.</P>
<P>I CAME; nor Cathmor fled; nor yet advanced: he sidelong
stalked along. An icy rock, cold, tall he seemed. I called forth
all my steel.—Silent awhile we strode, on either side of a rushing
stream: then, sudden turning, all at once, we raised our pointed
spears.—We raised our spears, but night came down. It is dark
<PB N="103" REF="139"/>
and silent round; but where the distant steps of hosts are sound∣ing
over the heath.</P>
<P>I CAME to the place where Fillan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The scenery of the place where Fil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an fought, and the situation of that hero, are picturesque and affecting. The dis∣tress, which succeeds, is heightened by Ossian's being ignorant, for some time, that his brother was wounded. This kind of suspence is frequent in Ossian's poems. The more unexpected a thing is, the great∣er impression it makes on the mind when it comes.</NOTE> fought. Nor voice, nor
sound is there. Abroken helmet lay on earth; a buckler cleft in twain.
Where, Fillan, where art thou, young chief of echoing Morven?
He heard me leaning against a rock, which bent its grey head over
the stream. He heard; but sullen, dark he stood. At length I
saw the hero.</P>
<P>WHY standest thou, robed in darkness, son of woody Selma?
Bright is thy path, my brother, in this dark-brown field. Long
has been thy strife in battle. Now the horn of Fingal is heard.
Ascend to the cloud of thy father, to his hill of feasts. In the
evening mist he sits, and hears the voice of Carril's harp. Carry
joy to the aged, young breaker of the shields.</P>
<P>CAN the vanquished carry joy? Ossian, no shield is mine. It
lies broken on the field. The eagle-wing of my helmet is torn.
It is when foes fly before them that fathers delight in their sons.
But their sighs burst forth, in secret, when their young warriors
yield.—No: Fillan will not behold the king. Why should the
hero mourn?</P>
<P>SON of blue-eyed Clatho, why dost thou awake my soul? Wert
thou not a burning fire before him; and shall he not rejoice?—
<PB N="104" REF="140"/>
Such fame belonged not to Ossian; yet was the king still a sun to
me. He looked on my steps, with joy: shadows never rose on his
face.—Ascend, O Fillan, to Mora: his feast is spread in the folds
of mist.</P>
<P>OSSIAN, give me that broken shield: these feathers that are
rolled in the wind. Place them near to Fillan, that less of his
fame may fall. Ossian, I begin to fail.—Lay me in that hollow
rock. Raise no stone above: lest one should ask about my
fame. I am fallen in the first of my fields; fallen without renown.
Let thy voice alone send joy to my flying soul. Why should the
bard know where dwells the early-fallen Fillan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In this, as well as the former publica∣tion, I have only admitted into the text compleat poems, or independent episodes: the fragments which remain of the compo∣sitions of Ossian, I have chosen to throw, occasionally, into the notes.

Is thy spirit on the eddying winds, blue-eyed king of shields?
Joy pursue my hero, thro' his folded clouds. The forms of thy
fathers, O Fillan, bend to receive their son. I behold the spread∣ing
of their fire on Mora; the blue-rolling of their misty wreaths.
—Joy meet thee my brother.—But we are dark and sad. I be∣hold
the foe round the aged, and the wasting away of his
fame. Thou art left alone in the field, grey-haired king of
Selma.</P>
<P>I LAID him in the hollow rock, at the roar of the nightly stream.
One red star looked in on the hero: winds lift, at times, his locks.
I listened: no sound is heard: for the warrior slept.—As light∣ning
on a cloud, a thought came rushing over my soul.—My eyes
rolled in fire: my stride was in the clang of steel.</P>

beam? Kindle your meteors on your hills, my fathers, to light

my daring steps. I will consume in wrath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the sentence is designedly left unfinished by the poet. The sense is, that he was resolved, like a destroying fire, to consume Cathmor, who had killed his bro∣ther. In the midst of this resolution, the situation of Fingal suggests itself to him, in a very strong light. He resolves to return to assist the king in prosecuting the war.—But then his shame for not defending his brother, recurs to him—He is determined again to go and find out Cathmor.—We may consider him, as in the act of advancing towards the enemy, when the horn of Fingal sounded on Mora, and called back his people to his presence.—This soliloquy is natural: the resolu∣tions which so suddenly follow one ano∣ther, are expressive of a mind extremely agitated with sorrow and conscious shame; yet the behaviour of Ossian, in his execution of the commands of Fingal, is so irrepre∣hensible, that it is not easy to determine where he failed in his duty. The truth is, that when men fail in designs which they ardently wish to accomplish, they naturally blame themselves, as the chief cause of their disappointment. The comparison, with which the poet concludes his soliloquy, is very fanciful; and well adapted to the ideas of those, who live in a country, where light∣ning is extremely common.</NOTE>—Should I not re∣turn!
the king is without a son, grey-haired amidst his foes. His
arm is not as in the days of old: his fame grows dim in Erin.
Let me not behold him from high, laid low in his latter field.—But
can I return to the king? Will he not ask about his son? “Thou
oughtest to defend young Fillan.”—I will meet the foe.—Green
Inisfail, thy sounding tread is pleasant to my ear: I rush on thy
ridgy host, to shun the eyes of Fingal.—I hear the voice of the
king, on Mora's misty top!—He calls his two sons; I come, my
father, in my grief.—I come like an eagle, which the flame of night
met in the desart, and spoiled of half his wings.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This scene is solemn. The poet al∣ways places his chief character amidst ob∣jects which favour the sublime. The face of the country, the night, the broken re∣mains of a defeated army, and, above all, the attitude and silence of Fingal himself, are circumstances calculated to impress an awful idea on the mind. Ossian is most successful in his night-descriptions. Dark images suited the melancholy temper of his mind. His poems were all composed after the active part of his life was over, when he was blind, and had survived all the com∣panions of his youth: we therefore find a veil of melancholy thrown over the whole.</NOTE> DISTANT, round the king, on Mora, the broken ridges of
Morven are rolled. They turned their eyes: each darkly bends,

on his own ashen spear.—Silent stood the king in the midst.
Thought on thought rolled over his soul. As waves on a secret
mountain-lake, each with its back of foam.—He looked; no son
appeared, with his long-beaming spear. The sighs rose, crowding,
from his soul; but he concealed his grief.—At length I stood
beneath an oak. No voice of mine was heard. What could I say
to Fingal in his hour of woe?—His words rose, at length, in
the midst: the people shrunk backward as he spoke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The abashed behaviour of the army of Fingal proceeds rather from shame than fear. The king was not of a tyrannical disposition: <HI>He,</HI> as he professes himself in the fifth book, <HI>never was a dreadful form, in their presence, darkened into wrath. His voice was no thunder to their ears: his eye sent forth no death.</HI>—The first ages of so∣ciety are not the times of arbitrary power. As the wants of mankind are few, they retain their independence. It is an ad∣vanced state of civilization that moulds the mind to that submission to government, of which ambitious magistrates take advan∣tage, and raise themselves into absolute power.</P>
<P>It is a vulgar error, that the common Highlanders lived, in abject slavery, under their chiefs. Their high ideas of, and at∣tachment to, the heads of their families, probably, led the unintelligent into this mistake.—When the honour of the tribe was concerned, the commands of the chief were obeyed, without restriction: but, if individuals were oppressed, they threw themselves into the arms of a neighbour∣ing clan, assumed a new name, and were encouraged and protected. The fear of this desertion, no doubt, made the chiefs cautious in their government. As their consequence, in the eyes of others, was in proportion to the number of their people, they took care to avoid every thing that tended to diminish it.</P>
<P>It was but very lately that the authority of the laws extended to the Highlands. Be∣fore that time the clans were governed, in civil affairs, not by the verbal commands of the chief, but by what they called <HI>Clechda,</HI> or the traditional precedents of their an∣cestors. When differences happened be∣tween individuals, some of the oldest men in the tribe were chosen umpires between the parties, to decide according to the <HI>Clechda.</HI> The chief interposed his autho∣rity, and, invariably, enforced the decision.—In their wars, which were frequent, on account of family-feuds, the chief was less reserved in the execution of his authority; and even then he seldom extended it to the taking the life of any of his tribe.—No crime was capital, except murder; and that was very unfrequent in the highlands. No corporal punishment, of any kind, was inflicted. The memory of an affront of this sort would remain, for ages, in a fa∣mily, and they would seize every opportu∣nity to be revenged, unless it came imme∣diately from the hands of the chief himself; in that case it was taken, rather as a fa∣therly correction, than a legal punishment for offences.</P></NOTE>.</P>

WHERE is the son of Selma, he who led in war? I behold not
his steps, among my people, returning from the field. Fell the
young bounding roe, who was so stately on my hills?—He fell;—for
ye are silent. The shield of war is broke.—Let his armour
be near to Fingal; and the sword of dark-brown Luno. I am

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This rock of Cormul is often men∣tioned in the preceding part of the poem. It was on it Fingal and Ossian stood to view the battle. The custom of retiring from the army, on the night prior to their en∣gaging in battle, was universal among the kings of the Caledonians.—Trenmor, the most renowned of the ancestors of Fingal, is mentioned as the first who instituted this custom. Succeeding bards attributed it to a hero of a latter period.—In an old poem, which begins with <HI>Mac-Arcath na ceud sról,</HI> this custom of retiring from the army, before an engagement, is numbered, among the wise institutions of Fergus, the son of Arc or Arcath, the first king of Scots. I shall here translate the passage; in some other note I may, probably, give all that remains of the poem. <HI>Fergus of the hundred streams, son of Arcath who fought of old: thou didst first retire at night: when the so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rolled before thee, in echoing fields. Nor bending in rest is the king: he gathers battles in his soul. Fly, son of the stranger; with morn he shall rush abroad.</HI> When, or by whom, this poem was writ, is uncertain. It has much of the spirit of the ancient composition of the Scottish bards; and seems to be a close imitation of the manner of Ossian.</NOTE> HIGH on Cormul's rock, an oak flamed to the wind. The
grey skirts of mist are rolled around; thither strode the king in his

wrath. Distant from the host he always lay, when battle burnt
within his soul. On two spears hung his shield on high; the
gleaming sign of death; that shield, which he was wont to strike,
by night, before he rushed to war.—It was then his warriors knew,
when the king was to lead in strife; for never was this buckler
heard, till Fingal's wrath arose.—Unequal were his steps on high,
as he shone in the beam of the oak; he was dreadful as the form of the
spirit of night, when he cloaths, on hills, his wild gestures with mist,
and, issuing forth, on the troubled ocean, mounts the car of
winds.</P>
<P>NOR settled, from the storm, is Erin's sea of war; they glittered,
beneath the moon, and, low-humming, still rolled on the field.—Alone
are the steps of Cathmor, before them on the heath; he
hung forward, with all his arms, on Morven's flying host. Now
had he come to the mossy cave, where Fillan lay in night. One
tree was bent above the stream, which glittered over the rock.—There
shone to the moon the broken shield of Clatho's son; and
near it, on grass, lay hairy-footed Bran<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This circumstance, concerning Bran, the favourite dog of Fingal, is, perhaps, one of the most affecting passages in the poem. I remember to have met with an old poem, composed long after the time of Ossian, wherein a story of this sort is very happily introduced. In one of the inva∣sions of the Danes, Ullin-clundu, a consi∣derable chief, on the western coast of Scot∣land, was killed in a rencounter with a fly∣ing party of the enemy, who had landed, at no great distance, from the place of his residence. The few followers who attend∣ed him were also slain.—The young wife of Ullin-clundu, who had not heard of his fall, fearing the worst, on account of his long delay, alarmed the rest of his tribe, who went in search of him along the shore. They did not find him; and the beautiful widow became disconsolate. At length he was discovered, by means of his dog, who sat on a rock beside the body, for some days.—The poem is not just now in my hands; otherwise its poetical merit might induce me to present the reader with a trans∣lation of it. The stanza concerning the dog, whose name was Du-chos, or <HI>Black∣foot,</HI> is very descriptive.</P>
<P>“Dark-sided Du-chos! feet of wind! cold is thy seat on rocks. He (the dog) sees the ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: his ears are high; and half he bounds away. He looks around; but Ullin sleeps; he droops again his head. The winds come past; dark Du-chos thinks, that Ullin's voice is there. But still he beholds him silent, laid amidst the waving heath. Dark-sided Du-chos, his voice no more shall send thee over the heath!”</P></NOTE> He had missed the chief

on Mora, and searched him along the wind. He thought that the
blue-eyed hunter slept; he lay upon his shield. No blast came
over the heath, unknown to bounding Bran.</P>
<P>CATHMOR saw the white-breasted dog; he saw the broken
shield. Darkness is blown back on his soul; he remembers the
falling away of the people. They come, a stream; are rolled
away; another race succeeds.—“But some mark the fields, as they
pass, with their own mighty names. The heath, thro' dark∣brown
years, is theirs; some blue stream winds to their fame.—Of
these be the chief of Atha, when he lays him down on earth.
Often may the voice of future times meet Cathmor in the air:
when he strides from wind to wind, or folds himself in the wing of
a storm.”</P>
<P>GREEN Erin gathered round the king, to hear the voice of his
power. Their joyful faces bend, unequal, forward, in the light of
the oak. They who were terrible were removed: Lubar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In order to illustrate this passage, it is proper to lay before the reader the scene of the two preceding battles. Between the hills of Mora and Lona lay the plain of Moi-lena, thro' which ran the river Lu∣bar. The first battle, wherein Gaul, the son of Morni, commanded on the Cale∣donian side, was fought on the banks of Lubar. As there was little advantage ob∣tained, on either side, the armies, after the battle, retained their former positions.</P>
<P>In the second battle, wherein Fillan commanded, the Irish, after the fall of Foldath, were driven up the hill of Lona; but, upon the coming of Cathmor to their aid, they regained their former situation, and drove back the Caledonians, in their turn: so that <HI>Lubar winded again in their host.</HI></P></NOTE> winds

shewed; no stranger he to war!</P>
<P>WHY is the king so sad, said Malthos eagle-eyed?—Remains
there a foe at Lubar? Lives there among them, who can lift the
spear? Not so peaceful was thy father, Borbar-duthul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Borbar-duthul, the father of Cath∣mor, was the brother of that Colc-ulla, who is said, in the beginning of the fourth book, to have rebelled against Cormac king of Ireland. Borbar-duthul seems to have retained all the prejudice of his family against the succession of the posterity of Conar, on the Irish throne. From this short episode we learn some facts which tend to throw light on the history of the times. It appears, that, when Swaran in∣vaded Ireland, he was only opposed by the Caël, who possessed Ulster, and the north of that island. Calmar, the son of Ma∣tha, whose gallant behaviour and death are related in the third book of Fingal, was the only chief of the race of the Fir-bolg, that joined the Caël, or Irish Caledonians, during the invasion of Swaran. The in∣decent joy, which Borbar-duthul expressed, upon the death of Calmar, is well suited with that spirit of revenge, which subsisted, universally, in every country where the seudal system was established.—It would appear that some person had carried to Bor∣bar-duthul that weapon, with which, it was pretended, Calmar had been killed.</NOTE>, king

fallen foes was great.—Three days feasted the grey-haired hero,
when he heared that Calmar fell: Calmar, who aided the race of
Ullin, from Lara of the streams.—Often did he feel, with his
hands, the steel which, they said, had pierced his foe. He felt it
<PB N="112" REF="148"/>
with his hands, for Borbar-duthul's eyes had failed.—Yet was the
king a sun to his friends; a gale to lift their branches round. Joy
was around him in his halls: he loved the sons of Bolga. His
name remains in Atha, like the awful memory of ghosts, whose
presence was terrible, but they blew the storm away.—Now let
the voices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The voices of Erin,</HI> a poetical ex∣pression for the bards of Ireland.</NOTE> of Erin raise the soul of the king; he that shone when
war was dark, and laid the mighty low.—Fonar, from that grey∣browed
rock, pour the tale of other times: pour it on wide-skirted
Erin, as it settles round.</P>
<P>To me, said Cathmor, no song shall rise; nor Fonar sit on the
rock of Lubar. The mighty there are laid low. Disturb not their
rushing ghosts. Far, Malthos, far remove the sound of Erin's
song. I rejoice not over the foe, when he ceases to lift the spear.
With morning we pour our strength abroad. Fingal is wakened
on his echoing hill.</P>

voice of the king. Deep-rolled into the field of night, they spread
their humming tribes. Beneath his own tree, at intervals, each
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Not only the kings, but every petty chief, had their bards attending them, in the field, in the days of Ossian; and these bards, in proportion to the power of the chiefs, who retained them, had a number of inferior bards in their train. Upon solemn occasions, all the bards, in the ar∣my, would join in one chorus; either when they celebrated their victories, or lamented the death of a person, worthy and renowned, slain in the war. The words were of the composition of the arch-bard, retained by the king himself, who generally attained to that high office on account of his superior genius for poetry. As the per∣sons of the bards were sacred, and the emoluments of their office considerable, the order, in succeeding times, became very numerous and insolent.

<Q>THIS book begins, about the middle of the third night from the opening of the poem.
The poet describes a kind of mist, which rose, by night, from the lake of Lego,
and was the usual residence of the souls of the dead, during the interval between their
decease and the funeral song. The appearance of the ghost of Fillan above the cave
where his body lay. His voice comes to Fingal, on the rock of Cormul. The
king strikes the shield of Trenmor, which was an infallible sign of his appearing in
arms himself. The extraordinary effect of the sound of the shield. Sul-malla,
starting from sleep, awakes Cathmor. Their affecting discourse. She insists with
him, to sue for peace; he resolves to continue the war. He directs her to retire to
the neighbouring valley of Lona, which was the residence of an old Druid, until the
battle of the next day should be over. He awakes his army with the sound of his
shield. The shield described. Fonar, the bard, at the desire of Cathmor, relates
the first settlement of the Firbolg in Ireland, under their leader Larthon. Morning

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>No poet departs less from his subject than Ossian. No far-fetched ornaments are introduced; the episodes rise from, and are indeed essential to, the story of the poem. Even his lyric songs, where he most in∣dulges the extravagance of fancy, natural∣ly spring from his subject. Their propriety and connection with the rest of the poem, shew that the Celtic bard was guided by judgment, amidst the wildest slights of ima∣gination. It is a common supposition among mankind, that a genius for poetry and sound sense seldom centre in the same person. The observation is far from being just; for true genius and judgment must be inseparable. The wild slights of fan∣cy, without the guidance of judgment, are, as Horace observes, like the dreams of a sick man, irksome and confused. Fools can never write good poems. A warm imagination, it is true, domineers over a common portion of sense; and hence it is that so few have succeeded in the poetical way. But when an uncommon strength of judgment, and a glowing fancy, are properly tempered together, they, and they only, produce genuine poetry.</P>
<P>The present book is not the least inte∣resting part of Temora. The awful images, with which it opens, are calculated to pre∣pare the mind for the solemn scenes which are to follow. Ossian, always, throws an air of consequence on every circumstance which relates to Fingal. The very sound of his shield produces extraordinary effects; and these are heightened, one above ano∣ther, in a beautiful climax. The distress of Sul-malla, and her conference with Cathmor, are very affecting. The de∣scription of his shield is a curious piece of antiquity; and is a proof of the early knowledge of navigation among the inha∣bitants of Britain and Ireland. Ossian, in short, throughout this book, is often su∣blime, and always pathetic.</P>
<P>As a specimen of the harmony of Galic versification without rhime, I shall lay a few lines, of the opening of this book, before those who understand the origi∣nal. The words are not, after the Irish manner, bristled over with unnecessary quiescent consonants, so disagreeable to the eye, and which rather embarass than assist the reader.</P>

<P>Lego, so often mentioned by Ossian, was a lake, in Connaught, in which the river Lara emptied itself. On the banks of this lake dwelt Branno, the father-in-law of Ossian, whom the poet often visited before and after the death of Evir-allin. This circumstance, perhaps, occasioned the partiality, with which he always men∣tions Lego and Lara; and accounts for his drawing so many of his images from them. The signification of Leigo, is, <HI>the lake of disease,</HI> probably so called, on account of the morasses which surrounded it.</P>
<P>As the mist, which rose from the lake of Lego, occasioned diseases and death, the bards feigned, as here, that it was the residence of the ghosts of the deceased, during the interval between their death, and the pronouncing of the funeral elegy over their tombs; for it was not allowable, without that ceremony was performed, for the spirits of the dead to mix with their ancestors, <HI>in their airy halls.</HI> It was the business of the spirit of the nearest relation to the deceased, to take the mist of Lego, and pour it over the grave. We find here Conar, the son of Trenmor, the first king of Ireland, according to the Ossian, perform∣ing this office for Fillan, as it was in the cause of the family of Conar, that that he∣ro was killed. The description of the ap∣pearance of the ghost is picturesque and solemn, imposing a still attention to the speech that follows it, which, with great propriety, is short and awful.</P></NOTE> FROM the wood-skirted waters of Lego, ascend, at times,

the dusky night. Often, blended with the gale, to some warrior's
<PB N="119" REF="155"/>
grave, they roll the mist, a grey dwelling to his ghost, until the
songs arise.</P>
<P>A SOUND came from the desart; it was Conar, king of Inis∣fail.
He poured his mist on the grave of Fillan, at blue-winding
Lubar.—Dark and mournful sat the ghost, in his grey ridge of
smoak. The blast, at times, rolled him together: but the form
returned again. It returned with bending eyes: and dark winding
of locks of mist.</P>
<P>IT is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It has been observed, that Ossian takes great delight in describing night-scenes. This, in some measure, is to be attributed to his melancholy disposition, which de∣lighted to dwell upon solemn objects. Even other poets, of a less serious turn than Os∣sian, have best succeeded in descriptions of this sort. Solemn scenes make the most lasting impressions on the imagination; gay and light objects only touch the sur∣face of the soul, and vanish: The human mind is naturally serious: levity and chear∣fulness may be amiable, but they are too often the characteristics of weakness of judgment, and a deplorable shallowness of soul.—The night-descriptions of Ossian were in high repute among succeeding bards. One of them delivered a sentiment, in a distich, more favourable to his taste for poetry, than to his galantry towards the ladies. I shall here give a translation of it.</P>
<P>“More pleasant to me is the night of Cona, dark-streaming from Ossian's harp; more pleasant it is to me, than a white-bosomed dweller between my arms; than a fair-handed daughter of heroes, in the hour of rest.”</P>
<P>Tho' tradition is not very satisfactory concerning the history of this poet, it has taken care to inform us, that he was <HI>very old</HI> when he wrote the distich.

season of night?”</P>
<P>WHY dost thou mix, said the king, with the dreams of thy fa∣ther?

Not such come the deeds of the valiant on the soul of Fingal.
They are not there a beam of lightning, which is seen, and is then no

<P>THE king took his deathful spear, and struck the deeply-sound∣ing
shield: his shield<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Succeeding bards have recorded many fables, concerning this wonderful shield. They say, that Fingal, in one of his expeditions into Scandinavia, met, in one of the islands of Juteland, with Luno, a celebrated magician. This Luno was the Vulcan of the north, and had made com∣pleat suits of armour for many of the heroes of Scandinavia. One disagreeable circum∣stance was, that every person who wanted to employ Luno to make armour for him, was obliged to overcome him, at his own magic art.—Fingal, unskilled in spells or enchantments, effected with dint of prow∣ess, what others failed in, with all their supernatural art. When Luno demanded a trial of skill from Fingal, the king drew his sword, cut off the skirts of the magi∣cian's robe, and obliged him, bare as he was, to fly before him. Fingal pursued, but Luno, coming to the sea, by his ma∣gic art, walked upon the waves. Fingal pursued him in his ship▪ and, after a chace of ten days, came up with him, in the isle of Sky, and obliged him to erect a furnace, and make him this shield, and his famous sord, poetically called, <HI>the son of Luno.</HI>—Such are the strange fictions which the modern Scotch and Irish bards have formed on the original of Ossian.</NOTE> that hung high in night, the dismal sign

The harps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was the opinion of the times, that, on the night preceding the death of a per∣son worthy and renowned, the harps of those bards, who were retained by his family, emmited melancholy sounds. This was at∣tributed, to use Ossian's expression, to <HI>the light touch of ghosts;</HI> who were supposed to have a fore-knowledge of events. The same opinion prevailed long in the north, and the particular sound was called, <HI>the warn∣ing voice of the dead. The voice of deaths,</HI> mentioned in the preceding sentence, was of a different kind. Each person was sup∣posed to have an attendant spirit, who assumed his form and voice, on the night preceding his death, and appeared, to some, in the attitude, in which the person was to die. The VOICES OF DEATH were the foreboding shri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks of those spirits.</NOTE> of the bards, untouched, sound mourn∣ful over the hill.</P>

Blue-shielded kings descend to war. Backward-looking armies fly;

<P>BUT when the third sound arose: deer started from the clefts
of their rocks. The screams of fowl are heard, in the desart, as
each flew, frighted, on his blast.—The sons of Morven half-rose,
and half-assumed their spears.—But silence rolled back on the host: they knew the shield of the king. Sleep returned to their eyes;
the field was dark and still.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>A bard, several ages more modern than Ossian, was so sensible of the beauty of this passage, as to give a close imitation of it, in a poem, concerning the great ac∣tions of Keneth Mac-Alpin, king of Scot∣land, against the Picts. As the poem is long, I shall only give here the story of it, with a translation of that paragraph, which bears the nearest resemblance to the passage of Temora just now before me. When Keneth was making preparations for that war, which terminated in the sub∣version of the Pictish kingdom, Flathal, his sister, had demanded permission from him, of attending him in the expedition; in order to have a share in revenging the death of her father Alpin, who had been barbarously murdered by the Picts. The king, tho' he, perhaps, approved of the gallant disposition of his sister, refused, on account of her sex, to grant her request. The heroine, however, dressed herself in the habit of a young warrior; and, in that disguise, attended the army, and perform∣ed many gallant exploits. On the night preceding the final overthrow of the Picts, Keneth, as was the custom among the kings of Scots, retired to a hill, without the verge of the camp, to meditate on the dispositions he was to make in the ap∣proaching battle. Flathal, who was anxi∣ous about the safety of her brother, went, privately, to the top of an adjoining rock, and kept watch there to prevent his being surprized by the enemy.—Keneth fell asleep, in his arms; and Flathal observed a body of the Picts surrounding the hill, whereon the king lay.—The sequel of the story may be gathered form the words of the bard.</P>
<P>“Her eyes, like stars, roll over the plain. She trembled for Alpin's race. She saw the gleaming foe. Her steps arose: she stopt.—“Why should he know of Fla∣thal? he the king men!—But hark! the sound is high.—It is but the wind of night, lone-whistling in my locks.—I hear the echoing shields!”—Her spear fell from her hand. The losty rock resounds.—He rose, a gathered cloud.</P>
<P>Who wakes Conad of Albion, in the midst of his secret hill? I heard the soft voice of Flathal. Why, maid, dost thou shine in war? The daughters roll their blue eyes, by the streams. No field of blood is theirs.</P>
<P>Alpin of Albion was mine, the father of Flathal of harps. He is low, mighty Conad, and my soul is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire. Could Flathal, by the secret stream, behold the blood of her foes? I am a young eagle, on Dura, king of Drum-albin of winds.”—</P>
<P>In the sequel of the piece, the bard does not imitate Ossian, and his poem is so much the worse for it.—Keneth, with his sister's assistance, forced his way thro' the advanced parties of the enemy, and re∣joined his own army. The bard has given a catalogue of the Scotch tribes, as they marched to battle; but, as he did not live near the time of Keneth, his accounts are to be little depended on.</P></NOTE> No sleep was thine in darkness, blue-eyed daughter of Con∣mor!

of years. There let thy rest be, Sul-malla, until our battle cease.
Until I return, in my arms, from the skirts of the evening mist,
that rises, on Lona, round the dwelling of my love.</P>
<P>A LIGHT fell on the soul of the maid; it rose kindled before
the king. She turned her face to Cathmor, from amidst her wav∣ing
locks. Sooner<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>In after ages, the allusions of the bards, to particular passages of the works of Ossian, were very numerous. I have met with a poem, which was writ three centuries age, in which the bard recom∣mends, to a lady of his own times, the behaviour of Sul-malla, in this place. The poem has little to recommend it, except∣ing the passage, of which I am to give a translation here. The bards, when they alluded to the works of Ossian, seem to have caught some portion of his fire: upon other occasions, their compositions are lit∣tle more than a group of epithets reduced into measure. Only their poems, upon martial subjects, fall under this censure. Their love sonnets, and pastoral verses, are far from wanting their beauties; but a great deal of these depend upon a certain <HI>curiosa felicitas</HI> of expression in the original; so that they would appear greatly to their disadvantage in another language. What the modern bards are most insupportable in, are their nauseous panegyrics upon their patrons. We see, in them, a petty ty∣rant, whose name was never heard, be∣yond the contracted limits of his own valley, stalking forth in all the trappings of a finished hero. From their frequent al∣lusions, however, to the entertainments which he gave, and the <HI>strength of his cups,</HI> we may easily guess from whence proceeded the praise of an indolent and effeminate race of men: for the bards, from the great court paid, originally, to their or∣der, became, at last, the most flagitious and dispirited of all mortals. Their compo∣sitions, therefore, on this side of a certain period, are dull and trivial to the highest degree. By lavishing their praises upon unworthy objects, their panegyricks be∣came common and little regarded; they were thrust out of the houses of the chiefs, and wandered about, from tribe to tribe, in the double capacity of poet and harper. Galled with this usage, they betook them∣selves to satire and lampoon, so that the compositions of the bards, for more than a c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntury back, are almost altogether of the sarcastical kind. In this they suc∣ceeded well; for, as there is no language more copious than the Gali<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, so there is scarcely any equally adapted to those quaint turns of expression which belong to satire.—Tho' the chiefs disregarded the lam∣poons of the bards, the vulgar, out of mere fear, received them into their habitations, entertained them, as well as their circumstances would allow, and kept existing, for some years, an order, which, by their own mismanagement, had deserv∣edly fallen into contempt.</P>
<P>To return to the old poem, which gave occasion to this note. It is an address to the wife of a chief, upon the departure of her husband to war. The passage, which alludes to Sul-malla, is this:—</P>
<P>“Why art thou mournful on rocks; or lifting thine eyes on waves? His ship has bounded towards battle. His joy is in the murmur of fields. Look to the beams of old, to the virgins of Ossian of harps. Sul-malla keeps not her eagle, from the field of blood. She would not tear thee, O Cathmor, from the sounding course of renown.”</P></NOTE> shall the eagle of heaven be torn, from
<PB N="126" REF="162"/>
the stream of his roaring wind, when he sees the dun prey, before
him, the young sons of the bounding roe, than thou, O Cathmor,
be turned from the strife of renown.—Soon may I see thee, war∣rior,
from the skirts of the evening mist, when it is rolled around
me, on Lona of the streams. While yet thou art distant far, strike,
Cathmor, strike the shield, that joy may return to my darkened
soul, as I lean on the mossy rock. But if thou should fall—I
am in the land of strangers;—O send thy voice, from thy cloud,
to the maid of Inis-huna.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="163"/>
YOUNG branch of green-headed Lumon, why dost thou shake
in the storm? Often has Cathmor returned, from darkly-rolling
wars. The darts of death are but hail to me; they have often
bounded from my shield. I have risen brightened from battle,
like a meteor from a stormy cloud. Return not, fair beam, from
thy vale, when the roar of battle grows. Then might the foe
escape, as from my fathers of old.</P>
<P>THEY told to Son-mor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Són-mor, <HI>tall handsome man.</HI> He was the father of Borbar-duthul, chief of Atha, and grandfather to Cathmor himself. The propriety of this episode is evident.

The story is alluded to in other poems.</NOTE>, who was slain by Cormac
in fight. Three days darkened Son-mor, over his brother's
fall.—His spouse beheld the silent king, and foresaw his steps to
war. She prepared the bow, in secret, to attend her blue-shielded
hero. To her dwelt darkness, at Atha, when he was not there.—From
their hundred streams, by night, poured down the sons of
Alnecma. They had heard the shield of the king, and their rage
arose. In clanging arms, they moved along, towards Ullin of the
groves. Son-mor struck his shield, at times, the leader of the
war.</P>
<P>FAR behind followed Sul-allin<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Suil-alluin, <HI>beautiful eye,</HI> the wise of Son-mor.</NOTE>, over the streamy hills. She
was a light on the mountain, when they crossed the vale below.
Her steps were stately on the vale, when they rose on the mossy
hill.—She feared to approach the king, who left her in echoing
<PB N="128" REF="164"/>
Atha. But when the roar of battle rose; when host was rolled on
host; when Son-mor burnt, like the fire of heaven in clouds, with
her spreading hair came Sul-allin; for she trembled for her king.
—He stopt the rushing strife to save the love of heroes.—The foe
fled by night; Clunar slept without his blood; the blood which
ought to be poured upon the warrior's tomb.</P>
<P>NOR rose the rage of Son-mor, but his days were silent and
dark. Sul-allin wandered, by her grey streams, with her tearful
eyes. Often did she look, on the hero, when he was folded in his
thoughts. But she shrunk from his eyes, and turned her lone steps
away.—Battles rose, like a tempest, and drove the mist from his
soul. He beheld, with joy, her steps in the hall, and the white
rising of her hands on the harp.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poet returns to his subject. The description of the shield of Cathmor is va∣luable, on account of the light it throws on the progress of arts in those early times. Those who draw their ideas of remote an∣tiquity from their observations on the man∣ners of modern savage nations, will have no high opinion of the workmanship of Cathmor's shield. To remove some part of their prejudice, I shall only observe, that the Belgae of Britain, who were the ancestors of the Firbolg, were a commercial people; and commerce, we might prove, from many shining examples of our own times, is the proper inlet of arts and sciences, and all that exalts the human mind. To avoid multiplying notes, I shall give here the signification of the names of the stars, engraved on the shield. Cean∣mathon, <HI>head of the bear.</HI> Col-derna, <HI>siant and sharp beam.</HI> Ul-oicho, <HI>ruler of night.</HI> Cathlin, <HI>beam of the wave.</HI> Reul-durath, <HI>star of the twilight.</HI> Berthin, <HI>fire of the hill.</HI> Tonthéna, <HI>meteor of the waves.</HI> These etymologies, excepting that of Cean∣mathon, are pretty exact. Of it I am not so certain; for it is not very probable, that the Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bolg had distinguished a constella∣tion, so very early as the days of Larthon, by the name of the bear.</NOTE> IN his arms strode the chief of Atha, to where his shield
hung, high, in night: high on a mossy bough, over Lubar's streamy
roar. Seven bosses rose on the shield; the seven voices of the king,
<PB N="129" REF="165"/>
which his warriors received, from the wind, and marked over all
their tribes.</P>
<P>ON each boss is placed a star of night; Can-mathon with beams
unshorn; Col-derna rising from a cloud: Uloicho robed in mist;
and the soft beam of Cathlin glittering on a rock. Laughing, on
its own blue wave, Reldurath half-sinks its western light. The
red eye of Berthin looks, thro' a grove, on the hunter, as he returns,
by night, with the spoils of the bounding roe.—Wide, in the
midst, arose the cloudless beams of Ton-thena, that star which
looked, by night, on the course of the sea-tossed Larthon: Larthon,
the first of Bolga's race, who travelled on the winds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To travel on the winds,</HI> a poetical expression for sailing.</NOTE>.—White-bosomed
spread the sails of the king, towards streamy
Inisfail; dun night was rolled before him, with its skirts of mist.
Unconstant blew the winds, and rolled him from wave to wave.—Then
rose the fiery-haired Ton-théna, and laughed from her part∣ed
cloud. Larthon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Larthon is compounded of <HI>Lear,</HI> sea, and <HI>thon,</HI> wave.

The author of it, probably, took the hint from the episode in this book, re∣lating to the first discovery of Ireland by Larthon. It abounds with those romantic fables of giants and magicians, which dis∣tinguish the compositions of the less an∣cient bards. The descriptions, contained in it, are ingenious and proportionable to the magnitude of the persons introduced; but, being unnatural, they are insipid and tedious. Had the bard kept within the bounds of probability, his genius was far from being contemptible. The exordium of his poem is not destitute of merit; but it is the only part of it, that I think wor∣thy of being presented to the reader.</P>

<P><PB N="130" REF="166"/>
BENEATH the spear of Cathmor, rose that voice which awakes
the bards. They came, dark-winding, from every side; each,
with the sound of his harp. Before them rejoiced the king, as
the traveller, in the day of the sun; when he hears, far-rolling
around, the murmur of mossy streams; streams that burst, in the
desart, from the rock of roes.</P>
<P>WHY, said Fonar, hear we the voice of the king, in the sea∣son
of his rest? Were the dim forms of thy fathers bending in
thy dreams? Perhaps they stand on that cloud, and wait for Fo∣nar's
song; often they come to the fields where their sons are to
lift the spear.—Or shall our voice arise for him who lifts the spear
no more; he that consumed the field, from Moma of the groves?</P>
<P>NOT forgot is that cloud in war, bard of other times. High

now, roll back my soul to the times of my fathers: to the years
when first they rose, on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-huna's waves. Nor alone pleasant to
Cathmor is the remembrance of wood-covered Lumon.—Lumon
of the streams, the dwelling of white-bosomed maids.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lumon, as I have remarked in a pre∣ceding note, was a hill, in Inis-huna, near the residence of Sul-malla.

We have there hinted to us only Larthon's first voyage to Ireland; here his story is related, at large, and a cu∣rious description of his invention of ship-building. This concise, but expressive, episode has been much admired in the ori∣ginal. Its brevity is remarkably suited to the hurry of the occasion.</NOTE> LUMON of the streams, thou risest on Fonar's soul! Thy sun
is on thy side, on the rocks of thy bending trees. The dun roe is

times, the hound, on the half-covered heath. Slow, on the vale,
are the steps of maids; the white-armed daughters of the bow:
they lift their blue eyes to the hill, from amidst their wandering
locks.—Not there is the stride of Larthon, chief of Inis-huna.
He mounts the wave on his own dark oak, in Cluba's ridgy bay.
That oak which he cut from Lumon, to bound along the sea.
The maids turn their eyes away, lest the king should be lowly-laid;
for never had they seen a ship, dark rider of the wave!</P>
<P>Now he dares to call the winds, and to mix with the mist of
ocean. Blue Inis-fail rose, in smoak; but dark-skirted night came
down. The sons of Bolga feared. The fiery haired Ton-théna
rose. Culbin's bay received the ship, in the bosom of its echoing
woods. There, issued a stream, from Duthuma's horrid cave;
where spirits gleamed, at times, with their half-finished forms.</P>
<P>DREAMS descended on Larthon: he saw seven spirits of his fa∣thers.
He heard their half-formed words, and dimly beheld the
times to come. He beheld the kings of Atha, the sons of future
days. They led their hosts, along the field, like ridges of mist,
which winds pour, in autumn, over Atha of the groves.</P>
<P>LARTHON raised the hall of Samla<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Samla, <HI>apparitions,</HI> so called from the vision of Larthon, concerning his posterity.</NOTE>, to the music of the harp.
He went forth to the roes of Erin, to their wonted streams. Nor
<PB N="132" REF="168"/>
did he forget green-headed Lumon; he often bounded over his
seas, to where white-handed Flathal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Flathal, <HI>heavenly, exquisitely beautiful.</HI> She was the wife of Larthon.</NOTE> looked from the hill of roes.

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>THE fourth morning, from the opening of the poem, comes on. Fingal, still con∣tinuing
in the place, to which he had retired on the preceding night, is seen, at
intervals, thro' the mist, which covered the rock of Cormul. The descent of
the king is described. He orders Gaul, Dermid, and Carril the bard, to go
to the val<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey of Cluna, and conduct, from thence, to the Caledonian army,
Ferad artho, the son of Cairbre, the only person remaining of the family of
Conar, the first king of Ireland.—The king takes the command of the army, and
prepares for battle. Marching towards the enemy, he comes to the cave of Lubar,
where the body of Fillan lay. Upon seeing his dog Bran, who lay at the entrance
of the cave, his grief returns.—Cathmor arranges the Irish army in order of
battle. The appearance of that hero. The general conflict is described. The
actions of Fingal and Cathmor. A storm. The total rout of the Fir-bolg. The
two kings engage, in a column of mist, on the banks of Lubar. Their attitude
and conference after the combat. The death of Cathmor.—Fingal resigns <HI>the spear
of Trenmor</HI> to Ossian. The ceremonies observed on that occasion.—The spirit of
Cathmor, in the mean time, appears to Sul-malla, in the valley of Lona. Her
sorrow.—Evening comes on. A feast is prepared.—The coming of Ferad-artho is
announced by the songs of a hundred bards.—The poem closes, with a speech of
Fingal.</Q>

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the course of my notes, I have made it more my business to explain, than to examine, critically, the works of Ossian. The first is my province, as the person best acquainted with them, the second falls to the share of others. I shall, however, ob∣serve, that all the precepts, which Aristotle drew from Homer, ought not to be applied to the composition of a Celtic bard; nor ought the title of the latter to the <HI>epopaea</HI> to be disputed, even if he should differ, in some circumstances, from a Greek poet.—Some allowance should be made for the different manners of nations. The genius of the Greeks and Celtae was extremely dissimilar. The first were lively and lo∣quacious; a manly conciseness of expression distinguished the latter. We find, accord∣ingly, that the compositions of Homer and Ossian are marked with the general and opposite characters of their respective na∣tions, and, consequently, it is improper to compare the <HI>minutiae</HI> of their poems toge∣ther. There are, however, general rules, in the conduct of an epic poem, which, as they are natural, are, likewise, uni∣versal. In these the two poets exactly cor∣respond. This similarity, which could not possibly proceed from imitation, is more decisive, with respect to the grand essentials of the <HI>epopaea,</HI> than all the precepts of Aristotle.</P>
<P>Ossian is now approaching to the grand catastrophe. The preparations he has made, in the preceding book, properly introduce the magnificence of description, with which the present book opens, and tend to shew that the Celtic bard had more art, in work∣ing up his fable, than some of those, who closely imitated the perfect model of Ho∣mer. The transition from the pathetic to the sublime is easy and natural. Till the mind is opened, by the first, it scarcely can have an adequate comprehension of the second. The soft and affecting scenes of the seventh book form a sort of contrast to, and consequently heighten, the features of the more grand and terrible images of the eighth.</P>
<P>The simile, with which this book opens, is, perhaps, the longest, and the most mi∣nutely descriptive, of any in the works of Ossian. The images of it are only fami∣liar to those who live in a cold and moun∣tainous country. They have often seen a lake suddenly frozen over, and strewed with withered grass, and boughs torn, by winds, from the mountains, which form its banks; but, I believe, few of them would be of the mind of the ancient bard, who pre∣ferred these winter-scenes to the irriguous vales of May.—<HI>To me,</HI> says he, <HI>bring back my woods, which strew their leaves on blasts: spread the lake below, with all its frozen waves. Pleasant is the breeze on the bearded ice; when the moon is broad in heaven, and the spirit of the mountain roars. Roll away the green vales of May; they are thoughts of maids,</HI> &amp;c. Such are the words of this winter poet, but what he afterwards adds, gives us to understand, that those frigid scenes were not his sole delight: for he speaks, with great tenderness, of the <HI>oak-lighted hall of the chief;</HI> and the <HI>strength of the shells, at night, when the course of winds is abroad.</HI></P>
<P>If the simile of a frozen lake aptly il∣lustrates the stillness and silent expectation of an army, lying under arms, waiting for the coming of their king, so the compa∣rison of the sudden rising of waves, a∣round a spirit, is also very expressive of the tumultuous joy of Fingal's army, upon the appearance of that hero.—An ancient bard, sensible of the beauty of this passage, has happily imitated it, in a poem, concerning Kenneth Mac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Alpin, king of Scotland.—I had occasion to quote this piece, in a note in the preceding book. Kenneth had retired privately, by night, to a hill, in the neighbourhood of his army, and, upon his return, next morning, the bard says, <HI>that he was like the form of a spirit, returning to his secret bay. In the skirt of a blast he stands. The waves lift their roaring heads. Their green backs are quivering round. Rocks eccho back their joy.</HI></P></NOTE> AS when the wintry winds have seized the waves of the
mountain-lake, have seized them, in stormy night, and
cloathed them over with ice; white, to the hunter's early eye,
the billows still seem to roll. He turns his ear to the sound of
each unequal ridge. But each is silent, gleaming, strewn with
<PB N="138" REF="173"/>
boughs and tusts of grass, which shake and whistle to the wind,
over their grey seats of frost.—So silent shone to the morning the ridges of Morven's host, as each warrior looked up from his helmet to∣wards
<PB N="139" REF="174"/>
the hill of the king; the cloud-covered hill of Fingal,
where he strode, in the folds of mist. At times is the hero seen,
greatly dim in all his arms. From thought to thought rolled the
war, along his mighty soul.</P>
<P>Now is the coming forth of the king.—First appeared the sword
of Luno; the spear half issuing from a cloud, the shield still dim
in mist. But when the stride of the king came abroad, with all
his grey, dewy locks in the wind; then rose the shouts of his host
over every moving tribe. They gathered, gleaming, round, with
all their echoing shields. So rise the green seas round a spirit, that
comes down from the squally wind. The traveller hears the sound
afar, and lists his head over the rock. He looks on the troubled
bay, and thinks he dimly sees the form. The waves sport, un∣wieldy,
round, with all their backs of foam.</P>
<P>FAR-DISTANT stood the son of Morni, Duthno's race, and
Cona's bard. We stood far-distant; each beneath his tree. We
shuned the eyes of the king; we had not conquered in the field.
—A little stream rolled at my seet: I touched its light wave, with
my spear. I touched it with my spear; nor there was the soul of
Ossian. It darkly rose, from thought to thought, and sent abroad
the sigh.</P>
<P>SON of Morni, said the king, Dermid, hunter of roes! why are
ye dark, like two rocks, each with its trickling waters? No
<PB N="140" REF="175"/>
wrath gathers on Fingal's soul, against the chiefs of men. Ye are
my strength in battle; the kindling of my joy in peace. My early
voice has been a pleasant gale to your ears, when Fillan prepared
the bow. The son of Fingal is not here, nor yet the chace of the
bounding roes. But why should the breakers of shields stand,
darkened, far away?</P>
<P>TALL they strode towards the king; they saw him turned to
Mora's wind. His tears came down, for his blue-eyed son, who
slept in the cave of streams. But he brightened before them, and
spoke to the broad-shielded kings.</P>
<P>CROMMAL, with woody rocks, and misty top, the field of
winds, pours forth, to the sight, blue Lubar's streamy roar. Be∣hind
it rolls clear-winding Lavath, in the still vale of deer. A
cave is dark in a rock; above it strong-winged eagles dwell;
broad-headed oaks, before it, sound in Cluna's wind.—Within, in
his locks of youth, is Ferad-artho<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ferad-artho was the son of Cairbar Mac-Cormac king of Ireland. He was the only one remaining of the race of Conar, the son of Trenmor, the first Irish mo∣narch, according to Ossian. In order to make this passage thoroughly understood, it may not be improper to recapitulate some part of what has been said in preceding notes.—Upon the death of Conar the son of Trenmor, his son Cormac succeeded on the Irish throne. Cormac reigned long. His children were, Cairbar, who succeed∣ed him, and Ros-crana, the first wife of Fingal. Cairbar, long before the death of his father Cormac, had taken to wife Bos∣gala, the daughter of Colgar, one of the most powerful chiefs in Connaught, and had, by her, Artho, afterwards king of Ireland. Soon after Artho arrived at man's estate, his mother Bos-gala died, and Cair∣bar married Beltanno, the daughter of Conachar of Ullin, who brought him a son, whom he called Ferad-artho, i. e. <HI>a man in the place of Artho.</HI> The occasion of the name was this. Artho, when his brother was born, was absent, on an ex∣pedition, in the south of Ireland. A false report was brought to his father, that he was killed.—<HI>Cairbar,</HI> to use the words of the poem on the subject, <HI>darkened for his fair-haired son. He turned to the young beam of light, the son of Beltanno of Co∣nachar. Thou shalt be Ferad-artho, he said, a fire before thy race.</HI> Cairbar, soon after, died, nor did Artho long survive him. Artho was succeeded, in the Irish throne, by his son Cormac, who, in his minority, was murdered by Cairbar, the son of Bor∣bar-duthul.—Ferad-artho, says tradition, was very young, when the expedition of Fingal, to settle him on the throne of Ire∣land, happened. During the short reign of young Cormac, Ferad-artho lived at the royal palace of Temora. Upon the murder of the king, Condan, the bard, conveyed Ferad-artho, privately, to the cave of Cluna, behind the mountain Crommal, in Ulster, where they both lived concealed, during the usurpation of the family of Atha. All these particulars, concerning Ferad-artho, may be gathered from the compositions of Ossian: A bard, less ancient, has delivered the whole his∣tory, in a poem just now in my posses∣sion. It has little merit, if we except the scene between Ferad-artho, and the messengers of Fingal, upon their arrival, in the valley of Cluna. After hearing of the great actions of Fingal, the young prince proposes the following questions concerning him, to Gaul and Dermid.—“Is the king tall as the rock of my cave? Is his spear a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir of Cluna? Is he a rough-winged blast, on the mountain, which takes the green oak by the head, and tears it from its hill?—Glitters Lubar within his stride, when he sends his stately steps along.—Nor is he tall, said Gaul, as that rock: nor glitter streams within his strides, but his soul is a mighty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood, like the strength of Ullin's seas.”</NOTE> blue-eyed king, the son of
<PB N="141" REF="176"/>
broad-shielded Cairbar, from Ullin of the roes. He listens to the
voice of Condan, as, grey, he bends in feeble light. He listens,
for his foes dwell in the echoing halls of Temora. He comes, at
times, abroad, in the skirts of mist, to pierce the bounding roes.
When the sun looks on the field, nor by the rock, nor stream, is
he! He shuns the race of Bolga, who dwell in his father's hall.
Tell him, that Fingal lifts the spear, and that his foes, perhaps,
may fail.</P>
<P>LIFT up, O Gaul, the shield before him. Stretch, Dermid,
Temora's spear. Be thy voice in his ear, O Carril, with the deeds
of his fathers. Lead him to green Moilena, to the dusky field of
<PB N="142" REF="177"/>
ghosts; for there, I fall forward, in battle, in the folds of war.
Before dun night descends, come to high Dunmora's top. Look,
from the grey folds of mist, on Lena of the streams. If there my
standard shall float on wind, over Lubar's gleaming stream, then has
not Fingal failed in the last of his fields.</P>
<P>SUCH were his words; nor aught replied the silent, striding kings.
They looked side-long, on Erin's host, and darkened, as they went.
—Never before had they left the king, in the midst of the stormy
field.—Behind them, touching at times his harp, the grey-haired
Carril moved. He foresaw the fall of the people, and mournful
was the sound!—It was like a breeze that comes, by fits, over Le∣go's
reedy lake; when sleep half-descends on the hunter, within his
mossy cave.</P>
<P>Why bends the bard of Cona, said Fingal, over his secret stream?
—Is this a time for sorrow, father of low-laid Oscar? Be the war∣riors
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Oscar and Fillan are here, emphati∣cally called <HI>the warriors.</HI> Ossian was not forgetful of them, <HI>when,</HI> to use his own ex∣pression, <HI>peace returned to the land.</HI> His plaintive poems, concerning the death of these young heroes, were very numerous. I had occasion, in a preceding note, to give a translation of one of them, (a dia∣logue between Clatho and Bos-mina) in this I shall lay before the reader a fragment of another. The greatest, and, perhaps, the most interesting part of the poem, is lost. What remains, is a soliloquy of Malvina, the daughter of Toscar, so often mentioned in Ossian's compositions. She, sitting alone, in the vale of Moi-lutha, is represented as descrying, at a distance, the ship which carried the body of Oscar to Morven.</P>
<P>“Malvina is like the bow of the shower, in the secret valley of streams; it is bright, but the drops of heaven are rolling on its blended light. They say, that I am fair within my locks, but, on my brightness, is the wandering of tears. Darkness flies over my soul, as the dusky wave of the breeze, along the grass of Lutha.—Yet have not the roes failed me, when I moved between the hills.—Pleasant, beneath my white hand, arose the sound of harps. What then, daughter of Lutha, travels over thy soul, like the dreary path a ghost, along the nightly beam?—Should the young war∣rior fall, in the roar of his troubled fields!—Young virgins of Lutha arise, call back the wandering thoughts of Malvina. A∣wake the voice of the harp, along my echo∣ing vale. Then shall my soul come forth, like a light from the gates of the morn, when clouds are rolled around them, with their broken sides.</P>
<P>“Dweller of my thoughts, by night, whose form ascends in troubled fields, why dost thou stir up my soul, thou far-distant son of the king?—Is that the ship of my love, its dark course thro' the ridges of ocean? How art thou so sudden, Oscar, from the heath of shields?”—</P>
<P>The rest of this poem, it is said, con∣sisted of a dialogue between Ullin and Mal∣vina, wherein the distress of the latter is carried to the highest pitch.</P></NOTE> remembered in peace; when echoing shields are heard no
<PB N="143" REF="178"/>
more. Bend, then, in grief, over the flood, where blows the moun∣tain
breeze. Let them pass on thy soul, the blue-eyed dwellers of
the tomb.—But Erin rolls to war; wide-tumbling, rough, and
dark. Lift, Ossian, lift the shield.—I am alone, my son!</P>
<P>As comes the sudden voice of winds to the becalmed ship of
Inis-huna, and drives it large, along the deep, dark rider of the
wave; so the voice of Fingal sent Ossian, tall, along the heath.
He lifted high his shining shield, in the dusky wing of war: like
the broad, blank moon, in the skirt of a cloud, before the storms
arise.</P>
<P>LOUD, from moss-covered Mora, poured down, at once, the
broad-winged war. Fingal led his people forth, king of Morven
of streams.—On high spreads the eagle's wing. His grey hair is
poured on his shoulders broad. In thunder are his mighty strides.
He often stood, and saw behind, the wide-gleaming rolling of ar∣mour.
—A rock he seemed, grey over with ice, whose woods are
high in wind. Bright streams leap from its head, and spread their
foam on blasts.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="179"/>
NOW he came to Lubar's cave, where Fillan darkly slept.
Bran still lay on the broken shield: the eagle-wing is strewed on
winds. Bright, from withered furze, looked forth the hero's spear.
—Then grief stirred the soul of the king, like whirlwinds blacken∣ing
on a lake. He turned his sudden step, and leaned on his bend∣ing
spear.</P>
<P>WHITE-BREASTED Bran came bounding with joy to the known
path of Fingal. He came, and looked towards the cave, where the
blue-eyed hunter lay, for he was wont to stride, with morning, to
the dewy bed of the roe.—It was then the tears of the king came
down, and all his soul was dark.—But as the rising wind rolls
away the storm of rain, and leaves the white streams to the sun,
and high hills with their heads of grass: so the returning war
brightened the mind of Fingal. He bounded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poetical hyperboles of Ossian were, afterwards, taken in the literal sense, by the ignorant vulgar; and they firmly be∣lieved, that Fingal, and his heroes, were of a gigantic stature. There are many ex∣travagant fictions founded, upon the cir∣cumstance of Fingal leaping at once over the river Lubar. Many of them are hand∣ed down in tradition. The Irish composi∣tions concerning Fingal invariably speak of him as a giant. Of these Hibernian poems there are now many in my hands. From the language, and allusions to the times in which they were writ, I should fix the date of their composition in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In some passages, the poetry is far from wanting merit, but the fable is unnatural, and the whole conduct of the pieces injudicious. I shall give one instance of the extravagant fictions of the Irish bards, in a poem which they, most unjustly, ascribe to Ossian. The story of it is this:—Ireland being threatened with an invasion from some part of Scandinavia, Fingal sent Ossian, Oscar and Ca-olt, to watch the bay, in which, it was expected, the enemy was to land. Oscar, unluckily, fell asleep, before the Scandinavians appear∣ed; and, great as he was, says the Irish bard, he had one bad property, that no less could waken him, before his time, than cutting off one of his fingers, or throwing a great stone against his head; and it was dangerous to come near him on those occa∣sions, till he had recovered himself, and was fully awake. Ca-olt, who was em∣ployed by Ossian to waken his son, made choice of throwing the stone against his head, as the least dangerous expedient. The stone, rebounding from the hero's head, shook, as it rolled along, the hill for three miles round. Oscar rose in rage, sought bravely, and, singly, vanquished a wing of the enemy's army.—Thus the bard goes on, till Fingal put an end to the war, by the total rout of the Scandinavians. Puerile, and even despicable, as these fictions are, yet Keating and O'Flaherty have no better authority than the poems which contain them, for all that they write concerning Fion Mac-comnal, and the pretended mi∣litia of Ireland.</NOTE> on his spear, over

Lubar, and struck his ecchoing shield. His ridgy host bend for∣ward,

<P>NOR Erin heard, with fear, the sound: wide they came rolling
along. Dark Malthos, in the wing of war, looks forward from
shaggy brows. Next rose that beam of light Hidalla; then the
side-long-looking gloom of Maronnan. Blue-shielded Clonar lifts
the spear; Cormar shakes his bushy locks on the wind.—Slowly,
from behind a rock, rose the bright form of Atha. First appeared
his two pointed spears, then the half of his burnished shield: like
the rising of a nightly meteor, over the vale of ghosts. But when
he shone all abroad: the hosts plunged, at once, into strife. The
gleaming waves of steel are poured on either side.</P>
<P>AS meet two troubled seas, with the rolling of all their waves,
when they feel the wings of contending winds, in the rock-sided
firth of Lumon; along the echoing hills is the dim course of
ghosts: from the blast fall the torn groves on the deep, amidst the
foamy path of whales.—So mixed the hosts!—Now Fingal; now
Cathmor came abroad.—The dark tumbling of death is before
them: the gleam of broken steel is rolled on their steps, as, loud,
the high-bounding kings hewed down the ridge of shields.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="181"/>
MARONNAN fell, by Fingal, laid large across a stream. The
waters gathered by his side, and leapt grey over his bossy shield.—Clonar
is pierced by Cathmor: nor yet lay the chief on earth. An
oak seized his hair in his fall. His helmet rolled on the ground.

His numerous descriptions of single com∣bats had already exhausted the subject. Nothing new, nor adequate to our high idea of the kings, could be said. Ossian, therefore, throws a <HI>column of mist</HI> over the whole, and leaves the combat to the ima∣gination of the reader.—Poets have almost universally failed in their descriptions of this sort. Not all the strength of Homer could sustain, with dignity, the <HI>minutiae</HI> of a single combat. The throwing of a spear, and the braying of a shield, as some of our own poets most elegantly express it, con∣vey no grand ideas. Our imagination stretches beyond, and, consequently, de∣spises, the description. It were, therefore, well, for some poets, in my opinion, (tho' it is, perhaps, somewhat singular) to have, sometimes, like Ossian, thrown <HI>mist</HI> over their single combats.</NOTE>—Nor by that

Joy rose, like a flame, on my soul: I blest the echoing rock. Here
be my dwelling, in darkness; in my grassy vale. From this I shall
mount the breeze, that pursues my thistle's beard; or look down,
on blue-winding Atha, from its wandering mist.</P>
<P>WHY speaks the king of the tomb?—Ossian! the warrior has
failed!—Joy meet thy soul, like a stream, Cathmor, friend of
strangers!—My son, I hear the call of years; they take my spear as
they pass along. Why does not Fingal, they seem to say, rest
within his hall? Dost thou always delight in blood? In the
tears of the sad?—No: ye darkly-rolling years, Fingal delights not
in blood. Tears are wintry streams that waste away my soul.
But, when I lie down to rest, then comes the mighty voice of
war. It awakes me, in my hall, and calls forth all my steel.—It
shall call it forth no more; Ossian, take thou thy father's spear.
Lift it, in battle, when the proud arise.</P>
<P>MY fathers, Ossian, trace my steps; my deeds are pleasant to
their eyes. Wherever I come forth to battle, on my field, are
their columns of mist.—But mine arm rescued the feeble; the
haughty found my rage was fire. Never over the fallen did mine
eye rejoice. For this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We see, from this passage, that, even in the times of Ossian, and, consequently, before the introduction of christianity, they had some idea of rewards and punishments after death.—Those who behaved, in life, with bravery and virtue, were received, with joy, to the airy halls of their fathers; but <HI>the dark in soul,</HI> to use the expression of the poet, were spurned away <HI>from the habi∣tation of heroes, to wander on all the winds.</HI> Another opinion, which prevailed in those times, tended not a little to make indivi∣duals emulous to excel one another in mar∣tial atchievements. It was thought, that, in the <HI>hall of clouds,</HI> every one had a seat, raised above others, in proportion as he ex∣celled them, in valour, when he lived.—The simile in this paragraph is new, and, if I may use the expression of a bard, who alludes to it, <HI>beautifully terrible.</HI></P>

But, to the proud in arms, they are darkened moons in heaven,
which send the fire of night, red-wandering over their face.</P>

<P>HE gave the spear to my hand, and raised, at once, a stone on
high, to speak to future times, with its grey head of moss. Be∣neath
he placed a sword<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are some stones still to be seen in the north, which were erected, as me∣morials of some remarkable transactions between the ancient chiefs.

<P>WHEN thou, O stone, shall moulder down, and lose thee, in
the moss of years, then shall the traveller come, and whistling pass
away.—Thou know'st not, feeble man, that fame once shone on

Moi-lena. Here Fingal resigned his spear, after the last of his fields.
—Pass away, thou empty shade; in thy voice there is no renown.
Thou dwellest by some peaceful stream; yet a few years, and thou
art gone. No one remembers thee, thou dweller of thick mist!—But
Fingal shall be clothed with fame, a beam of light to other
times; for he went forth, in echoing steel, to save the weak in
arms.</P>
<P>BRIGHTENING in his fame, the king strode to Lubar's sounding
oak, where it bent, from its rock, over the bright-tumbling stream.
Beneath it is a narrow plain, and the sound of the fount of the
rock.—Here the standard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The erecting of his standard on the bank of Lubar, was the signal, which Fingal, in the beginning of the book, pro∣mised to give to the chiefs, who went to conduct Ferad-artho to the army, should he himself prevail in battle. This stand∣ard here (and in every other part of Os∣sian's poems, where it is mentioned) is called, the <HI>sun-beam.</HI> The reason of this appellation, I gave, more than once, in my notes on the former collection of Os∣sian's poems.</NOTE> of Morven poured its wreaths on the
wind, to mark the way of Ferad-artho, from his secret vale.—Bright,
from his parted west, the sun of heaven looked abroad.
The hero saw his people, and heard their shouts of joy. In broken
ridges round, they glittered to the beam. The king rejoiced, as a
hunter in his own green vale, when, after the storm is rolled away,
he sees the gleaming sides of the rocks. The green thorn shakes
its head in their face; from their top, look forward the roes.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The poet changes the scēne to the valley of Lona, whither Sul-malla had been sent, by Cathmor, before the battle. Clonmal, an aged bard, or rather druid, as he seems here to be endued with a pre∣science of events, had long dwelt there, in a cave. This scene is awful and solemn, and calculated to throw a melancholy gloom over the mind.</NOTE> GREY, at his mossy cave, is bent the aged form of Clonmal.
The eyes of the bard had failed. He leaned forward, on his staff.
<PB N="152" REF="187"/>
Bright, in her locks, before him, Sul-malla listened to the tale; the
tale of the kings of Atha, in the days of old. The noise of battle
had ceased in his ear: he stopt, and raised the secret sigh. The
spirits of the dead, they said, often lightened over his soul. He
saw the king of Atha low, beneath his bending tree.</P>
<P>WHY art thou dark, said the maid? The strife of arms is past.
Soon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cathmor had promised, in the seventh book, to come to the cave of Clonmal, af∣ter the battle was over.</NOTE> shall he come to thy cave, over thy winding streams. The
sun looks from the rocks of the west. The mists of the lake arise.
Grey, they spread on that hill, the rushy dwelling of roes. From
the mist shall my king appear!—Behold, he comes in his arms.
Come to the cave of Clonmal, O my best beloved!</P>
<P>IT was the spirit of Cathmor, stalking, large, a gleaming form.
He sunk by the hollow stream, that roared between the hills.—“It
was but the hunter, she said, who searches for the bed of the roe.
His steps are not forth to war; his spouse expects him with night.
—He shall, whistling, return, with the spoils of the dark-brown
hinds.”—Her eyes are turned to the hill; again the stately form
came down. She rose, in the midst of joy. He retired in mist.
Gradual vanish his limbs of smoak, and mix with the mountain∣wind.
—Then she knew that he fell! “King of Erin art thou low!”
—Let Ossian forget her grief; it wastes the soul of age<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The abrupt manner, in which Ossian quits the story of Sul malla, is judicious. His subject led him immediately to relate the restoration of the family of Conar to the Irish throne; which we may consider essectually done, by the deseat and death of Cathmor, and the arrival of Ferad-ar∣tho in the Caledonian army. To pursue, here, the story of the <HI>maid of Inis-huna,</HI> which was foreign to the subject, would be altogether inconsistent with the rapid man∣ner of Ossian, and a breach on unity of time and action, one of the fundamental essentials of the <HI>epopoea,</HI> the rules of which our Celtic bard gathered from nature, not from the precepts of critics.—Neither did the poet totally desert the beautiful Sul-mal∣la, deprived of her lover, and a stranger, as she was, in a foreign land. Tradition relates, that Ossian, the next day after the decisive battle between Fingal and Cath∣mor, went to find out Sul-malla, in the valley of Lona. His address to her, which is still preserved, I here lay before the reader.</P>
<P>“Awake, thou daughter of Conmor, from the fern-skirted cavern of Lona. Awake, thou sun-beam in desarts; warriors one day must fail. They move forth, like terrible lights; but, often, their cloud is near.—Go to the valley of streams, to the wan∣dering of herds, on Lumon; there dwells, in his lazy mist, the man of many days. But he is unknown, Sul-malla, like the thistle of the rocks of roes; it shakes its grey beard, in the wind, and falls, unseen of our eyes.—Not such are the kings of men, their departure is a meteor of fire, which pours its red course, from the desart, over the bosom of night.</P>
<P>“He is mixed with the warriors of old, those fires that have hid their heads. At times shall they come forth in song. Not forgot has the warrior failed.—He has not seen, Sul-malla, the fall of a beam of his own: no fair-haired son, in his blood, young troubler of the field.—I am lonely, young branch of Lumon, I may hear the voice of the feeble, when my strength shall have failed in years, for young Oscar has ceased, on his field.—</P>
<P>The rest of the poem is lost; from the story of it, which is still preserved, we understand, that Sul-malla returned to her own country. Sul-malla makes a consider∣able figure in another poem of Ossian; her behaviour in that piece accounts for that partial regard with which the poet speaks of her throughout Temora.</P></NOTE>.</P>

EVENING came down on Moi-lena. Grey rolled the streams of
the land. Loud came forth the voice of Fingal: the beam of oaks
arose. The people gathered round with gladness; with gladness
blended with shades. They sidelong looked to the king, and beheld
his unfinished joy.—Pleasant, from the way of the desart, the voice
of music came. It seemed, at first, the noise of a stream, far-distant
on its rocks. Slow it rolled along the hill, like the ruffled wing
of a breeze, when it takes the tufted beard of the rocks, in the
<PB N="154" REF="189"/>
still season of night.—It was the voice of Condan, mixed with
Carril's trembling harp. They came, with blue-eyed Ferad-artho,
to Mora of the streams.</P>
<P>SUDDEN bursts the song from our bards, on Lena: the host
struck their shields midst the sound. Gladness rose brightening on
the king, like the beam of a cloudy day, when it rises, on the
green hill, before the roar of winds.—He struck the bossy shield of
kings; at once they cease around. The people lean forward, from
their spears, towards the voice of their land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before I finish my notes, it may not be altogether improper to obviate an ob∣jection, which may be made to the credibi∣lity of the story of Temora, as related by Ossian. It may be asked, whether it is probable, that Fingal could per∣form such actions as are ascribed to him in this book, at an age when his grandson, Oscar had acquired so much reputation in arms. To this it may be answered, that Fingal was but very young [book 4th] when he took to wise Ros-crana, who soon after became the mother of Ossian. Ossian was also extremely young when he married Ever-allin, the mother of Oscar. Tradi∣tion relates, that Fingal was but eighteen years old at the birth of his son Ossian; and that Ossian was much about the same age, when Oscar, his son, was born. Os∣car, perhaps, might be about twenty, when he was killed, in the battle of Gabhra, [book 1st] so the age of Fingal, when the decisive battle was fought between him and Cathmor, was just fifty-six years. In those times of activity and health, the natural strength and vigour of a man was little abated, at such an age; so that there is nothing improbable in the actions of Fin∣gal, as related in this book.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SONS of Morven, spread the feast; send the night away on
song. Ye have shone around me, and the dark storm is past.
My people are the windy rocks, from which I spread my eagle∣wings,
when I rush forth to renown, and seize it on its field.—Os∣sian,
thou hast the spear of Fingal: it is not the staff of a boy
with which he strews the thistle round, young wanderer of the
field.—No: it is the lance of the mighty, with which they stretch∣ed

forth their hands to death. Look to thy fathers, my son;
they are awful beams.—With morning lead Ferad-artho forth to
the echoing halls of Temora. Remind him of the kings of Erin;
the stately forms of old.—Let not the fallen be forgot, they were
mighty in the field. Let Carril pour his song, that the kings may
rejoice in their mist.—To-morrow I spread my sails to Selma's
shaded walls; where streamy Duthula winds through the seats of

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>AN address to Malvina, the daughter of Toscar.—The poet relates the arrival of
Cathlin in Selma, to solicit aid against Duth-carmor of Cluba, who had killed
Cathmol, for the sake of his daughter Lanûl.—Fingal declining to make a choice
among his heroes, who were all claiming the command of the expedition; they
retired <HI>each to his hill of ghosts;</HI> to be determined by dreams. The spirit of Tren∣mor
appears to Ossian and Oscar: they sail, from the bay of Carmona, and, on the
fourth day, appear off the valley of Rath-col, in Inis-huna, where Duth-carmor had
fixed his residence.—Ossian dispatches a bard to Duth-carmor to demand battle.
—Night comes on.—The distress of Cathlin of Clutha.—Ossian devolves the com∣mand
on Oscar, who, according to the custom of the kings of Morven, before
battle, retired to a neighbouring hill.—Upon the coming on of day, the battle
joins.—Oscar and Duth-carmor meet. The latter falls.—Oscar carries the mail and
helmet of Duth-carmor to Cathlin, who had retired from the field. Cathlin is dis∣covered
to be the daughter of Cathmol, in disguise, who had been carried off, by
force, by, and had made her escape from, Duth-carmor.</Q>

<HEAD>CATHLIN OF CLUTHA:
A
POEM.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The traditions, which accompany this poem, inform us, that both it, and the succeeding piece, went, of old, under the name of <HI>Laoi-Oi-lutha;</HI> i. e. the <HI>hymns of the maid of Lutha.</HI> They pretend also to fix the time of its composition, to the third year after the death of Fingal; that is, during the expedition of Fergus the son of Fingal, to the banks of <HI>Uisca duthon.</HI> In support of this opinion, the Highland senachies have prefixed to this poem, an address of Ossian, to Congal the young son of Fergus, which I have rejected, as having no manner of connection with the rest of the piece.—It has poetical merit; and, probably, it was the opening of one of Ossian's other poems, tho' the bards in∣judiciously transferred it to the piece now before us.</P>
<P>“Congal, son of Fergus of Durath, thou light between thy locks, ascend to the rock of Selma, to the oak of the breaker of shields. Look over the bosom of night, it is streaked with the red paths of the dead: look on the night of ghosts, and kindle, O Congal, thy soul. Be not, like the moon on a stream, lonely in the midst of clouds: darkness closes around it; and the beam departs.—Depart not, son of Fer∣gus, ere thou markest the field with thy sword. Ascend to the rock of Selma; to the oak of the breaker of shields.”</P></NOTE> COME, thou beam that art lonely, from watching in the
night! The squally winds are around thee, from all their
echoing hills. Red, over my hundred streams, are the light-covered
paths of the dead. They rejoice, on the eddying winds, in the
<PB N="160" REF="194"/>
season of night.—Dwells there no joy in song, white hand of the
harps of Lutha? Awake the voice of the string, and roll my soul
to me. It is a stream that has failed.—Malvina pour the song.</P>
<P>I HEAR thee, from thy darkness, in Selma, thou that watchest,
lonely, by night! Why didst thou with-hold the song, from Os∣sian's
failing soul?—As the falling brook to the ear of the hunt∣er,
descending from his storm-covered hill; in a sun-beam rolls
the echoing stream; he hears, and shakes his dewy locks: such is
the voice of Lutha, to the friend of the spirits of heroes.—My
swelling bosom beats high. I look back on the days that are past.
—Come, thou beam that art lonely, from the watching of
night.</P>
<P>IN the echoing bay of Carmona<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Car-mona, <HI>bay of the dark brown hills,</HI> an arm of the sea, in the neighbourhood of Selma.—In this paragraph are men∣tioned the signals presented to Fingal, by those who came to demand his aid. The suppliants held, in one hand, a shield co∣vered with blood, and, in the other, a broken spear; the first a symbol of the death of their friends, the last an emblem of their own helpless situation. If the king chose to grant succours, which gene∣rally was the case, he reached to them <HI>the shell of feasts,</HI> as a token of his hospitality and friendly intentions towards them.</P>
<P>It may not be disagreeable to the reader to lay here before him the ceremony of the Cran-tara, which was of a similar na∣ture, and, till very lately, used in the Highlands.—When the news of an enemy came to the residence of the chief, he im∣mediately killed a goat with his own sword, dipped the end of an half-burnt piece of wood in the blood, and gave it to one of his servants, to be carried to the next ham∣let. From hamlet to hamlet this <HI>tessera</HI> was carried with the utmost expedition, and, in the space of a few hours, the whole clan were in arms, and convened in an ap∣pointed place; the name of which was the only word that accompanied the delivery of the <HI>Cran-tara.</HI> This symbol was the manifesto of the chief, by which he threat∣ened fire and sword to those of his clan, that did not immediately appear at his standard.</P></NOTE> we saw, one day, the bound∣ing
ship. On high, hung a broken shield; it was marked with
<PB N="161" REF="195"/>
wandering blood. Forward came a youth, in armour, and stretch∣ed
his pointless spear. Long, over his tearful eyes, hung loose his
disordered locks. Fingal gave the shell of kings. The words of
the stranger arose.</P>
<P>IN his hall lies Cathmol of Clutha, by the winding of his own
dark streams. Duth-carmor saw white-bosomed Lanul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lanul, <HI>full-eyed,</HI> a surname which, according to tradition, was bestowed on the daughter of Cathmol, on account of her beauty; this tradition, however, may have been founded on that partiality, which the bards have shewn to <HI>Cathlin of Clutha;</HI> for, according to them, no <HI>falshood could dwell in the soul of the lovely.</HI></NOTE>, and
pierced her father's side. In the rushy desart were my steps.
He fled in the season of night. Give thine aid to Cathlin to re∣venge
his father.—I sought thee not as a beam, in a land
of clouds. Thou, like that sun, art known, king of echoing
Selma.</P>
<P>SELMA'S king looked around. In his presence, we rose in
arms. But who should lift the shield? for all had claimed the war.
The night came down; we strode, in silence; each to his hill
of ghosts: that spirits might descend, in our dreams, to mark us
for the field.</P>
<P>WE struck the shield of the dead, and raised the hum of songs.
We thrice called the ghosts of our fathers. We laid us down in
dreams.—Trenmor came, before mine eyes, the tall form of
other years. His blue hosts were behind him in half-distinguished
rows. Scarce seen is their strife in mist, or their stretching for∣ward
to deaths. I listened; but no sound was there. The forms
were empty wind.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="196"/>
I STARTED from the dream of ghosts. On a sudden blast flew
my whistling hair. Low-sounding, in the oak, is the departure
of the dead. I took my shield from its bough. Onward came
the rattling of steel. It was Oscar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oscar is here called <HI>Oscar of Lego,</HI> from his mother being the daughter of Branno, a powerful chief, on the banks of that lake. It is remarkable that Ossian ad∣dresses no poem to Malvina, in which her lover Oscar was not one of the principal actors. His attention to her, after the death of his son, shews that delicacy of sentiment is not confined, as some fondly imagine, to our own polished times.</NOTE> of Lego. He had seen his
fathers.</P>
<P>As rushes forth the blast, on the bosom of whitening waves;
so careless shall my course be, thro' ocean, to the dwelling of foes.
I have seen the dead, my father. My beating soul is high. My
fame is bright before me, like the streak of light on a cloud, when
the broad sun comes forth, red traveller of the sky.</P>
<P>GRANDSON of Branno, I said; not Oscar alone shall meet the
foe. I rush forward, thro' ocean, to the woody dwelling of he∣roes.
Let us contend, my son, like eagles, from one rock; when

raised our sails in Carmona. From three ships, they marked my

It seems to have been well known to those, who sailed on that sea, which divides Ireland from South-Britain. As the course of Os∣sian was along the coast of Inis-huna, he mentions with propriety, that star which directed the voyage of the colony from that country to Ireland.</NOTE>, red tra∣veller

Lumon came forward in mist. In winds were its hundred groves.

Sun-beams marked, at times, its brown side. White, leapt the
foamy streams, from all its echoing rocks.</P>
<P>A GREEN field, in the bosom of hills, winds silent with its own
blue stream. Here, midst the waving of oaks, were the dwellings
of kings of old. But silence, for many dark-brown years, had
settled in grassy Rath-col<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rath-col, <HI>woody field,</HI> does not appear to have been the residence of Duth-car∣mor: he seems rather to have been forced thither by a storm; at least I should think that to be the meaning of the poet, from his expression, that <HI>Ton-thena had hid her head,</HI> and that <HI>he bound his white-bosomed sails;</HI> which is as much as to say, that the weather was stormy, and that Duthcarmor put in to the bay of Rathcol for shelter.</NOTE>; for the race of heroes had failed, along
the pleasant vale.—Duth-carmor was here, with his people, dark
rider of the wave. Ton-thena had hid her head in the sky. He
bound his white-bosomed sails. His course is on the hills of
Rath-col, to the seats of roes.</P>
<P>WE came. I sent the bard, with songs, to call the foe to fight.
Duth-carmor heard him, with joy. The king's soul was like a
beam of fire; a beam of fire, marked with smoak, rushing, varied,
thro' the bosom of night. The deeds of Duth-carmor were dark,
tho' his arm was strong.</P>
<P>NIGHT came, with the gathering of clouds. By the beam of
the oak we sat down. At a distance stood Cathlin of Clutha. I
saw the changing<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>From this circumstance, succeeding bards feigned that Cathlin, who is here in the disguise of a young warrior, had fallen in love with Duth-carmor at a feast, to which he had been invited by her fa∣ther.

But <HI>as those rain-bows of hea∣ven are changeful,</HI> say my authors, speak∣ing of women, she selt the return of her former passion, upon the approach of Duth∣carmor's danger.—I myself, who think more favourably of the sex, must attribute the agitation of Cathlin's mind to her ex∣tream sensibility to the injuries done her by Duth-carmor: and this opinion is fa∣voured by the sequel of the story.</P></NOTE> soul of the stranger. As shadows fly over the
<PB N="164" REF="198"/>
field of grass, so various is Cathlin's cheek. It was fair, within
locks, that rose on Rath-col's wind. I did not rush, amidst his
soul, with my words. I bade the song to rise.</P>
<P>OSCAR of Lego, I said, be thine the secret hill<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This passage alludes to the well known custom among the ancient kings of Scot∣land, to retire from their army on the night preceding a battle.—The story which Ossian introduces in the next para∣graph, concerns the fall of the Druids, of which I gave some account in the disserta∣tion prefixed to the former collection.—It is said in many old poems, that the Druids, in the extremity of their affairs, had solicited and obtained aid from Scandi∣navia. Among the auxiliaries there came many pretended magicians, which circum∣stance Ossian alludes to, in his description of the <HI>son of Loda.</HI>—Magic and incanta∣tion could not, however, prevail; for Tren∣mor, assisted by the valour of his son Tra∣thal, entirely broke the power of the Druids.</P></NOTE>, to night.
Strike the shield, like Morven's kings. With day, thou shalt lead
in war. From my rock, I shall see thee, Oscar, a dreadful form
ascending in fight, like the appearance of ghosts amidst the storms
they raise.—Why should mine eyes return to the dim times of
old, ere yet the song had bursted forth, like the sudden rising of
winds?—But the years, that are past, are marked with mighty
deeds. As the nightly rider of waves looks up to Ton-thena of
beams: so let us turn our eyes to Trenmor, the father of kings.</P>
<P>WIDE, in Caracha's echoing field, Carmal had poured his tribes.
They were a dark ridge of waves; the grey-haired bards were
like moving foam on their face. They kindled the strife around,
with their red-rolling eyes.—Nor alone were the dwellers of rocks;
<PB N="165" REF="199"/>
a son of Loda was there; a voice, in his own dark land, to call
the ghosts from high.—On his hill, he had dwelt, in Lochlin,
in the midst of a leafless grove. Five stones lifted, near, their
heads. Loud roared his rushing stream. He often raised his voice
to winds, when meteors marked their nightly wings; when the
dark-crusted moon was rolled behind her hill. Nor unheard of
ghosts was he!—They came with the sound of eagle wings. They
turned battle, in fields, before the kings of men.</P>
<P>BUT, Trenmor, they turned not from battle; he drew forward
the troubled war; in its dark skirt was Trathal, like a rising light.

<P>NOR, in the field, are the steps of Cathlin. The stranger
stood by a secret stream, where the foam of Rath-col skirted the
mossy stones. Above, bends the branchy birch, and strews its
leaves, on winds. The inverted spear of Cathlin touched, at
times, the stream.—Oscar brought Duth-carmor's mail: his
helmet with its eagle-wing. He placed them before the stranger,
and his words were heard.—“The foes of thy father have
failed. They are laid in the field of ghosts. Renown returns to
Morven, like a rising wind. Why art thou dark, chief of Clutha?
Is there cause for grief?”</P>
<P>SON of Ossian of harps, my soul is darkly sad. I behold the
arms of Cathmol, which he raised in war. Take the mail of
Cathlin, place it high in Selma's hall; that thou mayst remember

<P>FROM white breasts descended the mail. It was the race of
kings; the soft-handed daughter of Cathmol, at the streams of
Clutha.—Duth-carmor saw her bright in the hall, he came, by
night, to Clutha. Cathmol met him, in battle, but the hero fell.
Three days dwelt the foe, with the maid. On the fourth she fled
in arms. She remembered the race of kings, and felt her burst∣ing

failed? Her tomb is at rushy Lumon, in a distant land. Near it

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>THIS poem, which, properly speaking, is a continuation of the last, opens with an
address to Sul-malla, the daughter of the king of Inis-huna, whom Ossian met, at
the chace, as he returned from the battle of Rath-col. Sul-malla invites Ossian and
Oscar to a feast, at the residence of her father, who was then absent in the wars.—Upon
hearing their name and family, she relates an expedition of Fingal into Inis∣huna.
She casually mentioning Cathmor, chief of Atha, (who then assisted her
father against his enemies) Ossian introduces the episode of Culgorm and Suran∣dronlo,
two Scandinavian kings, in whose wars Ossian himself and Cathmor were
engaged on opposite sides.—The story is imperfect, a part of the original be∣ing
lost.—Ossian, warned, in a dream, by the ghost of Trenmor, sets sail from Inis∣huna.</Q>

<HEAD>SUL-MALLA OF LUMON:
A
POEM.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The expedition of Ossian to Inis∣huna happened a short time before Fingal passed over into Ireland, to dethrone Cair∣bar the son of Borbar-duthul. Cathmor, the brother of Cairbar, was aiding Con∣mor, king of Inis-huna, in his wars, at the time that Ossian defeated Duth-carmor, in the valley of Rath-col. The poem is more interesting, that it contains so many particulars concerning those per∣sonages, who make so great a figure in Temora.</P>
<P>The exact correspondence in the man∣ners and customs of Inis-huna, as here de∣scribed, to those of Caledonia, leaves no room to doubt, that the inhabitants of both were originally the same people. Some may alledge, that Ossian might transfer, in his poetical descriptions, the manners of his own nation to foreigners. This objec∣tion is easily answered. Why has he not done this with regard to the inhabitants of Scandinavia?—We find the latter very different in their customs and superstitions from the nations of Britain and Ireland. The Scandinavian manners are remark∣ably barbarous and fierce, and seem to mark out a nation much less advanced in a state of civilization, than the inhabitants of Britain were in the times of Ossian.</P></NOTE> WHO moves so stately, on Lumon, at the roar of the
foamy waters? Her hair falls upon her heaving breast.
White is her arm behind, as slow she bends the bow. Why dost
thou wander in desarts, like a light thro' a cloudy field? The
<PB N="172" REF="205"/>
young roes are panting, by their secret rocks.—Return, thou
daughter of kings; the cloudy night is near.</P>
<P>IT was the young branch of Lumon, Sul-malla of blue eyes.
She sent the bard from her rock, to bid us to her feast. Amidst
the song we sat down, in Conmor's echoing hall. White moved
the hands of Sul-malla, on the trembling strings. Half-heard,
amidst the sound, was the name of Atha's king: he that was ab∣sent
in battle for her own green land.—Nor absent from her soul
was he: he came midst her thoughts by night: Ton-thena looked
in, from the sky, and saw her tossing arms.</P>
<P>THE sound of the shells had ceased. Amidst long locks, Sul∣malla
rose. She spoke with bended eyes, and asked of our course
thro' seas; “for of the kings of men are ye, tall riders of the
wave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sul-malla here discovers the quality of Ossian and Oscar, from their stature and stately gait. Among nations, not far advanced in civilization, a superior beauty and stateliness of person were inseparable from nobility of blood. It was from these qualities, that those of family were known by strangers, not from tawdry trappings of state injudiciously thrown round them. The cause of this distinguishing property, must, in some measure, be ascribed to their unmixed blood. They had no inducement to intermarry with the vulgar: and no low notions of interest made them deviate from their choice, in their own sphere. In states, where luxury has been long esta∣blished, I am told, that beauty of person is, by no means, the characteristic of an∣tiquity of family. This must be attribut∣ed to those enervating vices, which are in∣separable from luxury and wealth. A great family, (to alter a little the words of the historian) it is true, like a river, becomes considerable from the length of its course, but, as it rolls on, hereditary distempers, as well as property, slow successively into it.”</NOTE>.—Not unknown, I said, at his streams is he, the father
of our race. Fingal has been heard of at Cluba, blue-eyed daugh∣ter
<PB N="173" REF="206"/>
of kings.—Nor only, at Cona's stream, is Ossian and Oscar
known. Foes trembled at our voice, and shrunk in other lands.</P>
<P>NOT unmarked, said the maid, by Sul-malla, is the shield of
Morven's king. It hangs high, in Conmor's hall, in memory of
the past; when Fingal came to Cluba, in the days of other years.
Loud roared the boar of Culdarnu, in the midst of his rocks and
woods. Inis-huna sent her youths, but they failed; and virgins
wept over tombs,—Careless went the king to Culdarnu. On his
spear rolled the strength of the woods.—He was bright, they said,
in his looks, the first of mortal men.—Nor at the feast were heard
his words. His deeds passed from his soul of fire, like the rolling
of vapours from the face of the wandering sun.—Not careless looked
the blue eyes of Cluba on his stately steps. In white bosoms rose
the king of Selma, in midst of their thoughts by night. But the
winds bore the stranger to the echoing vales of his roes.—Nor
lost to other lands was he, like a meteor that sinks in a cloud. He
came forth, at times, in his brightness, to the distant dwelling of
foes. His fame came, like the sound of winds, to Cluba's woody
vale<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Too partial to our own times, we are ready to mark out remote antiquity, as the region of ignorance and barbarism. This, perhaps, is extending our prejudices too far. It has been long remarked, that knowledge, in a great measure, is sounded on a free intercourse between mankind; and that the mind is enlarged in propor∣tion to the observations it has made upon the manners of different men and nations.—If we look, with attention, into the his∣tory of Fingal, as delivered by Ossian, we shall find that he was not altogether a poor ignorant hunter, confined to the narrow corner of an island. His expeditions to all parts of Scandinavia, to the north of Germany, and the different states of Great Britain and Ireland, were very numerous, and performed under such a character, and at such times, as gave him an opportunity to mark the undisguised manners of man∣kind.—War and an active life, as they call forth, by turns, all the powers of the soul, present to us the different characters of men: in times of peace and quiet, for want of objects to exert them, the powers of the mind lie concealed, in a great mea∣sure, and we see only artificial passions and manners.—It is from this consideration I conclude, that a traveller of penetration could gather more genuine knowledge from a tour of ancient Gaul, than from the minutest observation of all the artificial manners, and elegant refinements of mo∣dern France.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>NOT unseen by Ossian, I said, rushed Cathmor from his streams,
when he poured his strength on I-thorno<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I-thorno, says tradition, was an island of Scandinavia. In it, at a hunting party, met Culgorm and Suran-dronlo, the kings of two neighbouring isles. They differed about the honour of killing a boar; and a war was kindled between them.—From this episode we may learn, that the manners of the Scandinavians were much more savage and cruel, than those of Britain.—It is remarkable, that the names, introduced in this story, are not of Galic original, which circumstance affords room to suppose, that it had its foundation in true history.</NOTE>, isle of many waves.
In strife met two kings in I-thorno, Culgorm and Suran-dronlo:
each from his echoing isle, stern hunters of the boar!</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="208"/>
THEY met a boar, at a foamy stream: each pierced it with his
spear. They strove for the fame of the deed: and gloomy battle
rose. From isle to isle they sent a spear, broken and stained with
blood, to call the friends of their fathers, in their sounding arms.
Cathmor came, from Bolga, to Culgorm, red-eyed king: I aided
Suran-dronlo, in his land of boars.</P>
<P>WE rushed on either side of a stream, which roared thro' a blast∣ed
heath. High broken rocks were round, with all their bending
trees. Near are two circles of Loda, with the stone of power;
where spirits descended, by night, in dark-red streams of fire.—There,
mixed with the murmur of waters, rose the voice of aged
men, they called the forms of night, to aid them in their war.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the circumstance of Ossian not being present at the rites, described in the preceding paragraph, we may suppose that he held them in contempt. This diffe∣rence of sentiment, with regard to reli∣gion, is a sort of argument, that the Ca∣ledonians were not originally a colony of Scandinavians, as some have imagined. Concerning so remote a period, mere con∣jecture must supply the place of argument and positive proofs.</NOTE> HEEDLESS I stood, with my people, where fell the foamy
stream from rocks. The moon moved red from the mountain. My
song, at times, arose. Dark, on the other side, young Cathmor
heard my voice; for he lay, beneath the oak, in all his gleaming
arms.—Morning came; we rushed to fight: from wing to wing
is the rolling of strife. They fell, like the thistle's head, beneath
autumnal winds.</P>
<P>IN armour came a stately form: I mixed my strokes with the
king. By turns our shields are pierced: loud rung our steely mails.
His helmet fell to the ground. In brightness shone the foe. His
<PB N="176" REF="209"/>
eyes, two pleasant flames, rolled between his wandering locks.—I
knew the king of Atha, and threw my spear on earth.—Dark, we
turned, and silent passed to mix with other foes.</P>
<P>NOT so passed the striving kings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Culgorm and Suran-dronlo. The combat of the kings and their attitude in death are highly picturesque, and expres∣sive of that ferocity of manners, which distinguished the northern nations.—The wild melody of the verfification of the original, is inimitably beautiful, and very different from the rest of the works of Ossian.</NOTE>. They mixed in echoing
fray; like the meeting of ghosts, in the dark wing of winds.
Thro' either breast rushed the spears; nor yet lay the foes on earth.
A rock received their fall; and half-reclined they lay in death.
Each held the lock of his foe; and grimly seemed to roll his eyes.
The stream of the rock leapt on their shields, and mixed below with
blood.</P>
<P>THE battle ceased in I-thorno. The strangers met in peace:
Cathmor from Atha of streams, and Ossian, king of harps. We
placed the dead in earth. Our steps were by Runar's bay. With
the bounding boat, afar, advanced a ridgy wave. Dark was the
rider of seas, but a beam of light was there, like the ray of the
sun, in Stromlo's rolling smoak. It was the daughter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Tradition has handed down the name of this princess. The bards call her Runo∣forlo, which has no other sort of title for being genuine, but its not being of Galic original; a distinction, which the bards had not the art to preserve, when they feigned names for foreigners. The high∣land fenachies, who very often endeavoured to supply the deficiency, they thought they found in the tales of Ossian, have given us the continuation of the story of the daughter of Suran-dronlo. The catastro∣phe is so unnatural, and the circumstances of it so ridiculously pompous, that, for the sake of the inventors, I shall conceal them.</P>
<P>The wildly-beautiful appearance of Ru∣no-forlo, made a deep impression on a chief, some ages ago, who was himself no contemptible poet. The story is roman∣tic, but not incredible,- if we make allow∣ances for the lively imagination of a man of genius.—Our chief sailing, in a storm, along one of the islands of Orkney, saw a woman, in a boat, near the shore, whom he thought, as he expresses it himself, <HI>as beautiful as a sudden ray of the sun, on the dark-heaving deep.</HI> The verses of Ossian, on the attitude of Runo-forlo, which was so similar to that of the woman in the boat, wrought so much on his fancy, that he fell desperately in love.—The winds, however, drove him from the coast, and, after a few days, he arrived at his residence in Scot∣land.—There his passion increased to such a degree, that two of his friends, fearing the consequence, failed to the Orkneys, to carry to him the object of his desire.—Upon enquiry they soon found the nymph, and carried her to the enamoured chief; but mark his surprize, when, instead <HI>of a ray of the sun,</HI> he saw a skinny fisher-wo∣man, more than middle aged, appearing before him.—Tradition here ends the story: but it may be easily supposed that the pas∣sion of the chief soon subsided.</P></NOTE> of Suran∣dronlo,

amidst disordered locks. Forward is her white arm, with the spear;
her high-heaving breast is seen, white as foamy waves that rise, by
turns, amidst rocks. They are beautiful, but they are terrible, and

<P>COME, ye dwellers of Loda! Carchar, pale in the midst of clouds!

shields. He was within her soul, like a fire in secret heath, which
awakes at the voice of the blast, and sends its beam abroad. A∣midst
the song removed the daughter of kings, like the soft sound
of a summer-breeze; when it lifts the heads of flowers, and curls
the lakes and streams.</P>

Two years after he took to wife Ros-crana, the daughter of Cormac, king of Ireland, Fingal undertook an expedition into Orkney, to visit his friend Cathulla, king of Inistore. After staying a few days at Carric-thura, the residence of Cathulla, the king set sail, to return to Scotland; but, a violent storm arising, his ships were driven into a bay of Scandinavia, near Gormal, the seat of Starno, king of Lochlin, his avowed enemy.

As I have mentioned the traditional tales of the Highlands, it may not be improper here, to give some account of them. Af∣ter the expulsion of the bards, from the houses of the chiefs, they, being an indo∣lent race of men, owed all their subsistence to the generosity of the vulgar, whom they diverted with repeating the compositions of their predecessors, and running up the ge∣nealogies of their entertainers to the family of their chiefs. As this subject was, how∣ever, soon exhausted, they were obliged to have recourse to invention, and form stories having no foundation in fact which were swallowed, with great credulity, by an ig∣norant multitude. By frequent repeating, the fable grew upon their hands, and, as each threw in whatever circumstance he thought conducive to raise the admiration of his hearers, the story became, at last, so devoid of all probability, that even the vulgar themselves did not believe it. They, however, liked the tales so well, that the bards found their advantage in turning pro∣fessed tale-makers. They then launch∣ed out into the wildest regions of fiction and romance. I firmly believe, there are more stories of giants, enchanted castles, dwarfs, and palfreys, in the Highlands, than in any country in Europe. These tales, it is certain, like other romantic compositions, have many things in them unnatural, and, consequently, disgustful to true taste, but, I know not how it happens, they command attention more than any other fictions I ever met with.—The extream length of these pieces is very surprising, some of them requiring many days to repeat them, but such hold they take of the memory, that few circumstances are ever omitted by those who have received them only from oral tra∣dition: What is still more amazing, the very language of the bards is still preserved.

Starno pursued his victory, laid waste the district of Crathlun, and, coming to the residence of Torcul-torno, carried off, by force, Conban-carglas, the beauti∣ful daughter of his enemy. Her he con∣fined in a cave, near the palace of Gormal, where, on account of her cruel treatment, she became distracted.</P>
<P>The paragraph, just now before us, is the song of Conban-carglas, at the time she was discovered by Fingal. It is in Ly∣ric measure, and set to music, which is wild and simple, and so inimitably suited to the situation of the unhappy lady, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow can hear it without tears.</P></NOTE>, of aged locks! where now are thy steps,

Conban-carglas!—But I behold thee, chief of Lulan, sporting
by Loda's hall, when the dark-skirted night is rolled along the sky.</P>
<P>THOU, sometimes, hidest the moon, with thy shield. I have
seen her dim, in heaven. Thou kindlest thy hair into meteors, and
sailest along the night.—Why am I forgot, in my cave, king of
shaggy boars? Look, from the hall of Loda, on lonely Conban∣carglas.</P>
<P>“WHO art thou, said Fingal, voice of night?”—She, trem∣bling,
turned away. “Who art thou, in thy darkness?”—She
shrunk into the cave.—The king loosed the thong from her
hands; he asked about her fathers.</P>
<P>TORCUL-TORNO, she said, once dwelt at Lulan's foamy stream:
he dwelt—but, now, in Loda's hall, he shakes the sounding
shell. He met Starno of Lochlin, in battle; long fought the dark-eyed
kings. My father fell, at length, blue-shielded Torcul∣torno.</P>
<P>BY a rock, at Lulan's stream, I had pierced the bounding roe.
My white hand gathered my hair, from off the stream of winds.
I heard a noise. Mine eyes were up. My soft breast rose on high.
My step was forward, at Lulan, to meet thee, Torcul-torno!</P>
<P>IT was Starno, dreadful king!—His red eyes rolled on Con∣ban-carglas.
Dark waved his shaggy brow, above his gathered
smile. Where is my father, I said, he that was mighty in war?
Thou are left alone among foes, daughter of Torcul-torno!</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="220"/>
HE took my hand. He raised the sail. In this cave he placed
me dark. At times, he comes, a gathered mist. He lifts, before
me, my father's shield. Often passes a beam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <HI>the beam of youth,</HI> it afterwards ap∣pears, that Conban-carglas means Swaran, the son of Starno, with whom, during her confinement, she had fallen in love.</NOTE> of youth, far-dis∣tant

Look not to that dark-robed moon; nor yet to those meteors of

<P>IT is not the steel of the feeble, nor of the dark in soul. The

white arms alone. They bend, fair within their locks, above the

<P>FINGAL, again, advanced his steps, wide thro' the bosom of
night, to where the trees of Loda shook amidst squally winds.
Three stones, with heads of moss, are there; a stream, with
<PB N="188" REF="221"/>
foaming course; and dreadful, rolled around them, is the dark-red
cloud of Loda. From its top looked forward a ghost, half-formed
of the shadowy smoak. He poured his voice, at times, amidst the
roaring stream.—Near, bending beneath a blasted tree, two heroes
received his words: Swaran of the lakes, and Starno foe of stran∣gers.
—On their dun shields, they darkly leaned: their spears are
forward in night. Shrill sounds the blast of darkness, in Starno's
floating beard.</P>
<P>THEY heard the tread of Fingal. The warriors rose in
arms. “Swaran, lay that wanderer low, said Starno, in his pride.
Take the shield of thy father; it is a rock in war.”—Swaran threw
his gleaming spear: it stood fixed in Loda's tree. Then came the
foes forward, with swords. They mixed their rattling steel. Thro'
the thongs of Swaran's shield rushed the blade<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sword of Fingal, so called from its maker, Luno of Lochlin.</NOTE> of Luno. The shield fell rolling on earth.

stopt the lifted steel. Wrathful stood Swaran, unarmed. He
rolled his silent eyes, and threw his sword on earth. Then, slow∣ly
stalking over the stream, he whistled as he went.</P>
<P>NOR unseen of his father is Swaran. Starno turned away in
wrath. His shaggy brows waved dark, above his gathered rage.
He struck Loda's tree, with his spear; he raised the hum of songs.
—They came to the host of Lochlin, each in his own dark path;
like two foam-covered streams, from two rainy vales.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="222"/>
To Turthor's plain Fingal returned. Fair rose the beam of the
east. It shone on the spoils of Lochlin in the hand of the king.
From her cave came forth, in her beauty, the daughter of Tor∣cul-torno.
She gathered her hair from wind; and wildly raised
her song. The song of Lulan of shells, where once her father
dwelt.</P>
<P>SHE saw Starno's bloody shield. Gladness rose, a light, on her
face. She saw the cleft helmet of Swaran<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Conban-carglas, from seeing the hel∣met of Swaran bloody in the hands of Fin∣gal, conjectured, that that hero was kill∣ed.—A part of the original is lost. It ap∣pears, however, from the sequel of the poem, that the daughter of Torcul-torno did not long survive her surprize, occasion∣ed by the supposed death of her lover.—The description of the airy hall of Loda (which is supposed to be the same with that of Odin, the deity of Scandinavia) is more picturesque and descriptive, than any in the Edda, or other works of the northern Scal∣ders.</NOTE>; she shrunk, darken∣ed,
from the king.—“Art thou fallen, by thy hundred streams,
O love of Conban-carglas!”—</P>
<P>U-THORNO, that risest in waters; on whose side are the meteors
of night! I behold the dark moon descending behind thy echoing
woods. On thy top dwells the misty Loda, the house of the spi∣rits
of men.—In the end of his cloudy hall bends forward Cruth∣loda
of swords. His form is dimly seen, amidst his wavy mist.
His right-hand is on his shield: in his left is the half-viewless
shell. The roof of his dreadful hall is marked with nightly
fires.</P>

THE race of Cruth-loda advance, a ridge of formless shades.
He reaches the sounding shell, to those who shone in war; but,
between him and the feeble, his shield rises, a crust of darkness.
He is a setting meteor to the weak in arms.—Bright, as a rain∣bow

<P>WHERE art thou, son of the king, said dark-haired Duth∣maruno?
Where hast thou failed, young beam of Selma?
—He returns not from the bosom of night! Morning is spread
U-thorno: in his mist is the sun, on his hill.—Warriors, lift the
shields, in my presence. He must not fall, like a fire from heaven,
whose place is not marked on the ground.—He comes, like an
eagle, from the skirt of his squally wind! In his hand are the spoils
of foes.—King of Selma, our souls were sad.</P>
<P>NEAR us are the foes, Duth-maruno. They come forward,
like waves in mist, when their foamy tops are seen, at times, above
the low-sailing vapour.—The traveller shrinks on his journey, and
knows not whither to fly.—No trembling travellers are we!—Sons
<PB N="194" REF="227"/>
of heroes call forth the steel.—Shall the sword of Fingal arise, or
shall a warrior lead?</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this short episode we have a very probable account given us, of the origin of monarchy in Caledonia. The <HI>Caël,</HI> or Gauls, who possessed the countries to the north of the Firth of Edinburgh, were, originally, a number of distinct tribes, or clans, each-subject to its own chief, who was free and independent of any other power. When the Romans invaded them, the common danger might, perhaps, have induced those <HI>reguli</HI> to join together, but, as they were unwilling to yield to the com∣mand of one of their own number, their battles were ill-conducted, and, conse∣quently, unsuccessful.—Trenmor was the first who represented to the chiefs, the bad consequences of carrying on their wars in this irregular manner, and advised, that they themselves should alternately lead in battle. They did so, but they were unsuc∣cessful. When it came to Trenmor's turn, he totally defeated the enemy, by his supe∣rior valour and conduct, which gained him such an interest among the tribes, that he, and his family after him, were regarded as kings; or, to use the poet's expression, <HI>the words of power rushed forth from Selma of kings.</HI>—The regal authority, however, ex∣cept in time of war, was but inconsider∣able; for every chief, within his own dis∣trict, was absolute and independent.—From the scene of the battle in this episode, (which was in the valley of Crona, a little to the north of Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icola's wall) I should suppose, that the enemies of the Caledoni∣ans were the Romans, or provincial Britons.</NOTE> THE deeds of old, said Duth-maruno, are like paths to our
eyes, O Fingal. Broad-shielded Trenmor, is still seen, amidst his
own dim years. Nor feeble was the soul of the king. There, no
dark deed wandered in secret.—From their hundred streams came
the tribes, to grassy Colglan-crona. Their chiefs were before them.
Each strove to lead the war. Their swords were often half-un∣sheathed.
Red rolled their eyes of rage. Separate they stood,
and hummed, their surly songs.—“Why should they yield to
each other? their fathers were equal in war.”</P>
<P>TRENMOR was there, with his people, stately in youthful locks.
He saw the advancing foe. The grief of his soul arose. He bade
<PB N="195" REF="228"/>
the chiefs to lead, by turns: they led, but they were rolled away.
—From his own mossy hill, blue-shielded Trenmor came down.
He led wide-skirted battle, and the strangers failed.—Around him
the dark-browed warriors came: they struck the shield of joy.
Like a pleasant gale, the words of power rushed forth from Selma
of kings. But the chiefs led, by turns, in war, till mighty danger
rose: then was the hour of the king to conquer in the field.</P>
<P>“NOT unknown, said Cromma-glas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In tradition, this Cromma-glas makes a great figure in that battle which Comhal lost, together with his life, to the tribe of Morni. I have just now, in my hands, an Irish composition, of a very modern date, as appears from the language, in which all the traditions, concerning that decisive en∣gagement, are jumbled together. In jus∣tice to the merit of the poem, I should have here presented to the reader a transla∣tion of it, did not the bard mention some circumstances very ridiculous, and others altogether indecent. Morna, the wife of Comhal, had a principal hand in all the transactions previous to the defeat and death of her husband; she, to use the words of the bard, <HI>who was the guiding star of the women of Erin.</HI> The bard, it is to be hoped, misrepresented the ladies of his country, for Morna's behaviour was, according to him, so void of all decency and vir∣tue, that it cannot be supposed, they had chosen her for their <HI>guiding star.</HI>—The poem consists of many stanzas. The lan∣guage is figurative, and the numbers har∣monious; but the piece is so full of ana∣chronisms, and so unequal in its com∣position, that the author, most undoubt∣edly, was either mad; or drunk, when he wrote it.—It is worthy of being re∣marked, that Comhal is, in this poem, very often called, <HI>Comhal na h'Albin,</HI> or <HI>Comhal of Albion,</HI> which sufficiently demon∣strates, that the allegations of Keating and O Flaherty, concerning <HI>Fion Mac-Comnal,</HI> are but of late invention.</NOTE> of shields, are the deeds
of our fathers.—But who shall now lead the war, before the race
of kings? Mist settles on these four dark hills: within it let each
warrior strike his shield. Spirits may descend in darkness, and mark
us for the war.”—They went, each to his hill of mist. Bards
marked the sounds of the shields. Loudest rung thy boss, Duth∣maruno.
Thou must lead in war.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="229"/>
LIKE the murmur of waters, the race of U-thorno came down.
Starno led the battle, and Swaran of stormy isles. They looked
forward from iron shields, like Cruth-loda fiery-eyed, when he
looks from behind the darkened moon, and strews his signs on
night.</P>
<P>THE foes met by Turthor's stream. They heaved like ridgy
waves. Their echoing strokes are mixed. Shadowy death flies
over the hosts. They were clouds of hail, with squally winds in
their skirts. Their showers are roaring together. Below them
swells the dark-rolling deep.</P>
<P>STRIFE of gloomy U-thorno, why should I mark thy wounds?
Thou art with the years that are gone; thou fadest on my soul.
Starno brought forward his skirt of war, and Swaran his own dark
wing. Nor a harmless fire is Duth-maruno's sword.—Lochlin is
rolled over her streams. The wrathful kings are folded in thoughts.
They roll their silent eyes, over the flight of their land.—The horn
of Fingal was heard; the sons of woody Albion returned. But
many lay, by Turthor's stream, silent in their blood.</P>
<P>CHIEF of Crom-charn, said the king, Duth-maruno, hunter of
boars! not harmless returns my eagle, from the field of foes. For
this white-bosomed Lanul shall brighten, at her streams; Can∣dona
shall rejoice, at rocky Crathmo-craulo.</P>
<P>COLGORM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The family of Duth-maruno, it ap∣pears, came originally from Scandinavia, or, at least, from some of the northern isles, subject, in chief, to the kings of Lochlin. The Highland senachies, who never missed to make their comments on, and additions to, the works of Ossian, have given us a long list of the ancestors of Duth-maruno, and a particular account of their actions, many of which are of the marvellous kind. One of the tale makers of the north has chosen for his hero, Starn∣mor, the father of Duth-maruno, and, considering the adventures thro' which he has led him, the piece is neither disagree∣able, nor abounding with that kind of fic∣tion, which shocks credibility.</NOTE>, replied the chief, was the first of my race in Al∣bion;
Colgorm, the rider of ocean, thro' its watry vales. He flew
<PB N="197" REF="230"/>
his brother in I-thorno: he left the land of his fathers. He chose
his place, in silence, by rocky Crathmo-craulo. His race came
forth, in their years; they came forth to war, but they always fell.
The wound of my fathers is mine, king of echoing isles!</P>
<P>HE drew an arrow from his side. He fell pale, in a land un∣known.
His soul came forth to his fathers, to their stormy isle.
There they pursued boars of mist, along the skirts of winds.—The
chiefs stood silent around, as the stones of Loda, on their hill.
The traveller sees them, thro' the twilight, from his lonely path.
He thinks them the ghosts of the aged, forming future wars.</P>
<P>NIGHT came down, on U-thorno. Still stood the chiefs in their
grief. The blast hissed, by turns, thro' every warrior's hair.—Fin∣gal,
at length, bursted forth from the thoughts of his soul. He
called Ullin of harps, and bade the song to rise.—No falling fire,
that is only seen, and then retires in night; no departing meteor
was Crathmo-craulo's chief. He was like the strong-beaming sun,
long rejoicing on his hill. Call the names of his fathers, from
their dwellings old.</P>

<P>WHENCE is the stream of years? Whither do they roll along?
Where have they hid, in mist, their many-coloured sides?
I look into the times of old, but they seem dim to Ossian's eyes,
like reflected moon-beams, on a distant lake. Here rise the red
beams of war!—There, silent, dwells a feeble race! They mark
no years with their deeds, as slow they pass along.—Dweller be∣tween
the shields; thou that awakest the failing soul, descend from

which kindles the past: rear the forms of old, on their own dark-brown

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bards, who were always ready to supply what they thought deficient in the poems of Ossian, have inserted a great ma∣ny incidents between the second and third <HI>duän</HI> of Cath-loda. Their interpolations are so easily distinguished from the genuine remains of Ossian, that it took me very little time to mark them out, and totally to reject them. If the modern Scotch and Irish bards have shewn any judgment, it is in ascribing their own compositions to names of antiquity, for, by that means, they themselves have escaped that contempt, which the authors of such futile perform∣ances must, necessarily, have met with, from people of true taste.—I was led into this observation, by an Irish poem, just now before me. It concerns a descent made by Swaran, king of Lochlin, on Ireland, and is the work, says the traditional preface prefixed to it, of <HI>Ossian Mac-Fion.</HI> It however appears, from several pious ejacu∣lations, that it was rather the composition of some good priest, in the fifteenth or six∣teenth century, for he speaks, with great devotion, of pilgrimage, and more particu∣larly, of the <HI>blue-eyed daughters of the con∣vent.</HI> Religious, however, as this poet was, he was not altogether decent, in the scenes he introduces between Swaran and the wife of <HI>Congcullion,</HI> both of whom he represents as giants. It happening unfor∣tunately, that <HI>Congcullion</HI> was only of a moderate stature, his wife, without hesita∣tion, preferred Swaran, as a more adequate match for her own gigantic size. From this fatal preference proceeded so much mischief, that the good poet altogether lost sight of his principal action, and he ends the piece, with an advice to men, in the choice of their wives, which, however good it may be, I shall leave concealed in the obscurity of the original.</NOTE> UTHORNO, hill of storms, I behold my race on thy side.
Fingal is bending, in night, over Duth-maruno's tomb. Near

him are the steps of his heroes, hunters of the boar.—By Tur∣thor's
stream the host of Lochlin is deep in shades. The wrathful
kings stood on two hills; they looked forward from their bossy
shields. They looked forward on the stars of night, red-wander∣ing
in the west. Cruth-loda bends from high, like a formless me∣teor
in clouds. He sends abroad the winds, and marks them, with
his signs. Starno foresaw, that Morven's king was never to yield in
war.</P>
<P>HE twice struck the tree in wrath. He rushed before his son.
He hummed a surly song; and heard his hair in wind. Turned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The surly attitude of Starno and Swaran is well adapted to their fierce and uncomplying dispositions. Their characters, at first sight, seem little different; but, up∣on examination, we find, that the poet has dexterously distinguished between them. They were both dark, stubborn, haugh∣ty and reserved; but Starno was cunning, revengeful, and cruel, to the highest de∣gree; the disposition of Swaran, though sa∣vage, was less bloody, and somewhat tinc∣tured with generosity. It is doing injustice to Ossian, to say, that he has not a great variety of characters.</NOTE>

from one another, they stood, like two oaks, which different winds
had bent; each hangs over its own loud rill, and shakes its boughs
in the course of blasts.</P>
<P>ANNIR, said Starno of lakes, was a fire that consumed of old.
He poured death from his eyes, along the striving fields. His joy
was in the fall of men. Blood, to him, was a summer stream,
that brings joy to withered vales, from its own mossy rock.—He
came forth to the lake Luth-cormo, to meet the tall Corman∣trunar,
he from Urlor of streams, dweller of battle's wing.</P>
<P>THE chief of Urlor had come to Gormal, with his dark-bosomed
ships; he saw the daughter of Annir, white-armed Foinar-bragal.
He saw her: nor careless rolled her eyes, on the rider of stormy
waves. She fled to his ship in darkness, like a moon-beam thro' a
nightly vale.—Annir pursued along the deep; he called the winds
of heaven.—Nor alone was the king; Starno was by his side.
Like U-thorno's young eagle, I turned my eyes on my father.</P>
<P>WE came to roaring Urlor. With his people came tall Corman∣trunar.
We fought; but the foe prevailed. In his wrath stood
Annir of lakes. He lopped the young trees, with his sword. His
eyes rolled red in his rage. I marked the soul of the king, and I
retired in night.—From the field I took a broken helmet: a
shield that was pierced with steel: pointless was the spear in my
hand. I went to find the foe.</P>

ON a rock sat tall Corman-trunar, beside his burning oak; and,
near him, beneath a tree, sat deep-bosomed Foinar-bragal. I
threw my broken shield before her; and spoke the words of peace.
—Beside his rolling sea, lies Annir of many lakes. The king

<Q>AFTER an address to Malvina, the daughter of Toscar, Ossian proceeds to relate his
own expedition to Fuärfed, an island of Scandinavia.—Mal-orchol, king of Fuärfed,
being hard pressed in war, by Ton-thormod, chief of Sar-dronlo, (who had demanded,
in vain, the daughter of Mal-orchol in marriage) Fingal sent Ossian to his aid.—Ossian,
on the day after his arrival, came to battle with Ton-thormod, and took
him prisoner.—Mal-orchol offers his daughter Oina-morul to Ossian; but he, disco∣vering
her passion for Ton-thormod, generously surrenders her to her lover, and
brings about a reconciliation between the two kings.</Q>

<P>AS flies the unconstant sun, over Larmon's grassy hill; so pass
the tales of old, along my soul, by night. When bards are
removed to their place; when harps are hung in Selma's hall; then
comes a voice to Ossian, and awakes his soul. It is the voice of
years that are gone: they roll before me, with all their deeds. I
seize the tales, as they pass, and pour them forth in song. Nor a
troubled stream is the song of the king, it is like the rising of mu∣sic
from Lutha of the strings.—Lutha of many strings, not silent
are thy streamy rocks, when the white hands of Malvina move
upon the harp.—Light of the shadowy thoughts, that fly across my
soul, daughter of Toscar of helmets, wilt thou not hear the song!
We call back, maid of Lutha, the years that have rolled away.</P>

My course was towards the isle of Fuärfed, woody dweller of seas.
Fingal had sent me to the aid of Mal-orchol, king of Fuärfed wild:
for war was around him, and our fathers had met, at the feast.</P>
<P>IN Col-coiled, I bound my sails, and sent my sword to Mal∣orchol
of shells. He knew the signal of Albion, and his joy
arose. He came from his own high hall, and seized my hand in
grief. “Why comes the race of heroes to a falling king? Ton∣thormod
of many spears is the chief of wavy Sar-dronlo. He saw
and loved my daughter, white-bosomed Oina-morul. He sought;
I denied the maid; for our fathers had been foes.—He came, with
battle, to Fuärfed; my people are rolled away.—Why comes the
race of heroes to a falling king?”</P>
<P>I COME not, I said, to look, like a boy, on the strife. Fingal
remembers Mal-orchol, and his hall for strangers. From his waves,
the warrior descended, on thy woody isle. Thou wert no cloud
before him. Thy feast was spread with songs. For this my sword
shall rise; and thy foes perhaps may fail.—Our friends are not for∣got
in their danger, tho' distant is our land.</P>
<P>SON of the daring Trenmor, thy words are like the voice of
Cruth-loda, when he speaks, from his parting cloud, strong dweller

Mal-orchol. I have looked towards all the winds; but no
white sails were seen.—But steel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a severe satire couched in this expression, against the guests of Mal-orchol. Had his feast been still spread, had joy con∣tinued in his hall, his former parasites would not have failed to resort to him. But as the time of festivity was past, their at∣tendance also ceased. The sentiments of a certain old bard are agreeable to this obser∣vation. He, poetically, compares a great man to a fire kindled in a desart place. “Those that pay court to him, says he, are rolling large around him, like the smoke about the fire. This smoke gives the fire a great appearance at a distance, but it is but an empty vapour itself, and varying its form at every breeze. When the trunk, which fed the fire, is consumed, the smoke departs on all the winds. So the flatterers forsake their chief, when his power de∣clines.” I have chosen to give a paraphrase, rather than a translation, of this passage, as the original is verbose and frothy, not∣withstanding of the sentimental merit of the author.—He was one of the less antient bards, and their compositions are not ner∣vous enough to bear a literal translation.</NOTE> resounds in my hall; and not
the joyful shells.—Come to my dwelling, race of heroes; dark-skirted
night is near. Hear the voice of songs, from the maid of
Fuärfed wild.</P>
<P>WE went. On the harp arose the white hands of Oina-morul.
She waked her own sad tale, from every trembling string. I stood
in silence; for bright in her locks was the daughter of many isles.
Her eyes were like two stars, looking forward thro' a rushing shower.
The mariner marks them on high, and blesses the lovely beams.—With
morning we rushed to battle, to Tormul's resounding stream:
the foe moved to the sound of Ton-thormod's bossy shield. From
wing to wing the strife was mixed. I met the chief of Sar-dronlo.
Wide flew his broken steel. I seized the king in fight. I gave his
hand, bound fast with thongs, to Mal-orchol, the giver of shells.
Joy rose at the feast of Fuärfed, for the foe had failed.—Ton∣thormod
turned his face away, from Oina-morul of isles.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="246"/>
SON of Fingal, begun Mal-orchol, not forgot shalt thou pass
from me. A light shall dwell in thy ship, Oina-morul of slow-rolling
eyes. She shall kindle gladness, along thy mighty soul.
Nor unheeded shall the maid move in Selma, thro' the dwelling of
kings.</P>
<P>IN the hall I lay in night. Mine eyes were half-closed in sleep.
Soft music came to mine ear: it was like the rising breeze, that
whirls, at first, the thistle's beard; then flies, dark-shadowy, over
the grass. It was the maid of Fuärfed wild: she raised the nightly
song; for she knew that my soul was a stream, that flowed at plea∣sant
sounds.</P>
<P>WHO looks, she said, from his rock, on ocean's closing mist?
His long locks, like the raven's wing, are wandering on the blast.
Stately are his steps in grief. The tears are in his eyes. His man∣ly
breast is heaving over his bursting soul.—Retire, I am distant far;
a wanderer in lands unknown. Tho' the race of kings are around
me, yet my soul is dark.—Why have our fathers been foes, Ton∣thormod
love of maids!</P>
<P>SOFT voice of the streamy isle, why dost thou mourn by night?
The race of daring Trenmor are not the dark in soul. Thou shalt
not wander, by streams unknown, blue-eyed Oina-morul.—Within
this bosom is a voice; it comes not to other ears: it bids Ossian
hear the hapless, in their hour of woe.—Retire, soft singer by
night; Ton-thormod shall not mourn on his rock.</P>
<P>WITH morning I loosed the king. I gave the long-haired
maid. Mal-orchol heard my words, in the midst of his echoing
halls.—“King of Fuärfed wild, why should Ton-thormod
<PB N="215" REF="247"/>
mourn? He is of the race of heroes, and a flame in war. Your
fathers have been foes, but now their dim ghosts rejoice in death.
They stretch their arms of mist to the same shell in Loda. For∣get
their rage, ye warriors, it was the cloud of other years.”—</P>
<P>SUCH were the deeds of Ossian, while yet his locks were young:

<Q>FINGAL dispatches Ossian and Toscar to raise a stone, on the banks of the stream of
Crona, to perpetuate the memory of a victory, which he had obtained in that
place. When they were employed in that work, Car-ul, a neighbouring chief, in∣vited
them to a feast.—They went: and Toscar fell desperately in love with Colna∣dona,
the daughter of Car-ul. Colna-dona became no less enamoured of Toscar.

streams, Toscar of grassy Lutha, and Ossian, young in fields.
Three bards attended with songs. Three bossy shields were born
before us: for we were to rear the stone, in memory of the past.
By Crona's mossy course, Fingal had scattered his foes: he had rolled
away the strangers, like a troubled sea. We came to the place of
renown: from the mountains descended night. I tore an oak from
its hill, and raised a flame on high. I bade my fathers to look
down, from the clouds of their hall; for, at the fame of their
race, they brighten in the wind.</P>
<P>I TOOK a stone from the stream, amidst the song of bards.
The blood of Fingal's foes hung curdled in its ooze. Beneath, I
placed, at intervals, three bosses from the shields of foes, as rose or
fell the sound of Ullin's nightly song. Toscar laid a dagger in
earth, a mail of sounding steel. We raised the mould around the
stone, and bade it speak to other years.</P>
<P>Oozy daughter of streams, that now art reared on high, speak
to the feeble, O stone, after Selma's race have failed!—Prone, from
the stormy night, the traveller shall lay him, by thy side: thy
whistling moss shall sound in his dreams; the years that were past
<PB N="221" REF="252"/>
shall return.—Battles rise before him, blue-shielded kings descend
to war: the darkened moon looks from heaven, on the troubled
field.—He shall burst, with morning, from dreams, and see the
tombs of warriors round. He shall ask about the stone, and the
aged shall reply, “This grey stone was raised by Ossian, a chief
of other years!”</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The manners of the Britons and Ca∣ledonians were so similar, in the days of Ossian, that there can be no doubt, that they were originally the same people, and descended from those Gauls who first pos∣sessed themselves of South-Britain, and gra∣dually migrated to the north. This hypo∣thesis is more rational than the idle fables of ill-informed senachies, who bring the Caledonians from distant countries. The bare opinion of Tacitus, (which, by-the-bye, was only sounded on a similarity of the personal figure of the Caledonians to the Germans of his own time) tho' it has staggered some learned men, is not sufficient to make us believe, that the antient inhabitants of North-Britain were a Ger∣man colony. A discussion of a point like this might be curious, but could never be satisfactory. Periods so distant are so in∣volved in obscurity, that nothing certain can be now advanced concerning them. The light which the Roman writers hold forth is too feeble to guide us to the truth, thro' the darkness which has surrounded it.</NOTE> FROM Col-amon came a bard, from Car-ul, the friend of
strangers. He bade us to the feast of kings, to the dwelling of
bright Colna-dona. We went to the hall of harps. There Car-ul
brightened between his aged locks, when he beheld the sons of
his friends, like two young trees before him.</P>
<P>SONS of the mighty, he said, ye bring back the days of old,
when first I descended from waves, on Selma's streamy vale. I
pursued Duth-mocarglos, dweller of ocean's wind. Our fathers
had been foes, we met by Clutha's winding waters. He fled,
along the sea, and my sails were spread behind him.—Night de∣ceived
me, on the deep. I came to the dwelling of kings, to
<PB N="222" REF="253"/>
Selma of high-bosomed maids.—Fingal came forth with his bards,
and Conloch, arm of death. I feasted three days in the hall, and
saw the blue-eyes of Erin, Ros-crana, daughter of heroes, light of
Cormac's race.—Nor forgot did my steps depart: the kings gave
their shields to Car-ul: they hang, on high, in Col-amon, in me∣mory
of the past.—Sons of the daring kings, ye bring back the
days of old.</P>
<P>CAR-UL placed the oak of feasts. He took two bosses from our
shields. He laid them in earth, beneath a stone, to speak to the
hero's race. “When battle, said the king, shall roar, and our
sons are to meet in wrath. My race shall look, perhaps, on this
stone, when they prepare the spear.—Have not our fathers met in
peace, they will say, and lay aside the shield?”</P>
<P>NIGHT came down. In her long locks moved the daughter of
Car-ul. Mixed with the harp arose the voice of white-armed Col∣na-dona.
—Toscar darkened in his place, before the love of heroes.
She came on his troubled soul, like a beam to the dark-heaving
ocean: when it bursts from a cloud, and brightens the foamy side
of a wave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here an episode is intirely lost; or, at least, is handed down so imper∣fectly, that it does not deserve a place in the poem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH morning we awaked the woods; and hung forward on
the path of the roes. They fell by their wonted streams. We
returned thro' Crona's vale. From the wood a youth came for∣ward,
with a shield and pointless spear. “Whence, said Toscar
<PB N="223" REF="254"/>
of Lutha, is the flying beam? Dwells there peace at Col-amon,
round bright Colna-dona of harps?”</P>
<P>BY Col-amon of streams, said the youth, bright Colna-dona
dwelt. She dwelt; but her course is now in desarts, with the
son of the king; he that seized her soul as it wandered thro' the
hall.</P>
<P>STRANGER of tales, said Toscar, hast thou marked the warrior's
course? He must fall,—give thou that bossy shield!—In wrath he
took the shield. Fair behind it rose the breasts of a maid, white
as the bosom of a swan, trembling on swift-rolling waves. It was
Colna-dona of harps, the daughter of the king.—Her blue eyes
had rolled on Toscar, and her love arose.</P>

not from any other superior merit, than the variety of its
versification. To print any part of the former collection was
unnecessary, as a copy of the originals lay, for many months, in
the bookseller's hands, for the inspection of the curious. Tho'
the erroneous orthography of the bards is departed from, in ma∣ny
instances, in the following specimen, yet several quiescent con∣sonants
are retained, to shew the derivation of the words. This
circumstance may give an uncouth appearance to the language,
in the eyes of those who are strangers to its harmony. They
ought, however, to consider, that a language is put to the se∣verest
test, when it is stripped of its own proper characters; es∣pecially,
when the power of <HI>one</HI> of them requires, sometimes,
