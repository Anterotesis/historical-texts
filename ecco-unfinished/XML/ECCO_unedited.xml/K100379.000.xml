<P>{inverted ⁂} <HI>Several Gentlemen having intimated their Desire, too late for the Press, of being Subscribers, it is intended, the ensuing Winter, to reprint this Work; when the Author will be obliged to any Gentleman who will honour him with his Name, in a Line directed to him, at Mr</HI> Mason's <HI>Cham∣bers,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 1, Elm-Court, <HI>in the</HI> Temple.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is almost unnecessary to inform the Rea∣ders, that the Tragedy in this Collection is founded on a Catastrophe, which happen'd at <HI>Constantinople</HI> in the Year <HI>1624;</HI> and that the Unities of the Drama are not attended to: Its many Imperfections are submitted to their Candour.</P>

<PB REF="12"/>
<HEAD>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE Lord <HI>BLAKENEY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the Honour of addressing this Performance to your Lordship, as presiding over the Laudable Or∣der of ANTIGALLICANS; perhaps, the most laudable so of any at this Time existing; an Order of the best Institu∣tion; calculated for Ends of the highest Importance: I need not expatiate; its Title implies it, its Motto evinces it, its Laws enforce it; to oppose the Interest and Designs of <HI>France,</HI> and to discountenance her Manufactures, being the Basis of its Institution—an Institution, at this Crisis of Time particularly, the most eminent.</P>
<P>To be an ANTIGALLICAN, my Lord, implies every Thing great; a Lover of our Country—an Enemy to <HI>France,</HI> as her inveterate Foe: We have for a long Series of Years been blessed with the Enjoyment of Peace and Property; how long this happy Scene may exist, or how soon we may be involved in those Calamities, which the Regions around us feel, and which we are so happy only
<PB REF="13"/>
to hear off, is yet reserved in the Book of Fate; which Calamities, I flatter myself, by Divine Assistance, are greatly in our Power, as ANTIGALLICANS, to avert; were we hearty, zealous, and indefatigable in our Country's Cause; like the fam'd <HI>Spartans</HI> of old at the Straits of <HI>Thermpylae,</HI> we might make a noble Stand, and save her in the most perilous Time: This, my Lord, may be looked on as an Hyperbole; but as our Plan might be greatly improved, I conceive it not impracticable: A red Coat, my Lord, does not make a Man brave; in order to it, may Courage, Virtue, and Publick Spirit, be the distinguishing Charac∣teristics of every ANTIGALLICAN; may our Songs be martial; may our Admission of Members be seriously at∣tended to, and their Initiation strongly enforced; and that the Order of ANTIGALLICANS, may long flourish un∣der the Auspices of Lord BLAKENEY, is the ardent De∣sire of a Brother, and, my Lord,</P>

<L>A Matter of Importance pressing me,</L>
<L>Wherein I crave your nice Deliberations;</L>
<L>I've summon'd you, my Friends—as Friends indeed,</L>
<L>Not as my Ministers, to Call of Office.</L>
<L>Attend—The Question of this Night imports</L>
<L>Ourself in Person, and our future Conduct:</L>
<L>Let your Advice then be from Reason form'd,</L>

<L>Let not your Favour to my private Thoughts,</L>

<L><PB N="43" REF="60"/>Without Reserve your most impartial Judgments.</L>

<L>Our Loves are mutual, Educations one,</L>

<L>Those Thoughts, Deeds, Notions, one Preceptor taught us:</L>
<L>I would enlarge myself to your Apprehensions,</L>
<L>To give the ampler Scope for judging truly:</L>
<L>We both imbib'd the Principles of Virtue,</L>
<L>And have improv'd their Growth by constant Practice;</L>
<L>She more refin'dly, living more recluse;</L>
<L>Myself with Latitude, engag'd in Wars,</L>

<L>She starts, adhering to the Mufti's Precept,</L>
<L>"Take no Man but an Husband to thy Bed."</L>
<L>I cannot offer Force to the Deserving.</L>
<L>My Question then consists of these four Points;</L>

<L>MY Lords! a critical Affair of State,</L>

<L>Full prone to Mutiny; soon roused to Action;</L>
<L>Expressive Tokens of a Set of Cowards,</L>

<P>THE Author begs Leave to premise, that in this Essay he has retained some few of the old Words of <HI>Spenser,</HI> and adopted the Simplicity of the Diction in the ludicrous Cast, at the End of most of the Stanzas, to give it somewhat the exterior Air of that great Origi∣nal, however far short he may have fell of the Spirit.</P>
<P>In order to make it more intelligible, at the Foot of each Page, is given an Explanation of the obsolete Words, as they occur.—As to the modern Terms of the Ladies Dress, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which perhaps may be thought by some, to require as much Explanation as the obsolete Ones) he pre∣sumes as they are pretty well known among the Ladies and Beau Monde, he may be ex∣cused a Discussion.— Upon the whole, he hopes that the novel Manner of thus treating these Subjects, will in some Measure atone for its many Imperfections.</P>

<L>His Servants wond'ring, said —the Child alive,</L>

<L>A Treasure far surpassing what the Coast</L>
<L>Of <HI>Afric,</HI> or rich <HI>India</HI>'s Shore can boast;</L>
<L>Rubies and Diamonds are of Price less far,</L>
<L>In Value nothing when compar'd with her:</L>
<L>On her Right-hand do Length of Days attend,</L>
<L>Riches and Honours on her Left do stand;</L>
<L>Her Ways are Pleasantness, her Paths are Peace,</L>
<L>Where ev'ry Step we take, our Joys increase;</L>
<L>She is a Tree of Life, thrice happy Man!</L>
<L>Who holds her fast, and can her Gifts retain:</L>
<L>Behold the Glories of yon azure Sky,</L>
<L>Then to the Earth direct thy wond'ring Eye;</L>
<L>Wisdom all perfect did the Fabrick raise,</L>
<L>And Heav'n and Earth proclaim their Maker's Praise;</L>
<L>He spake—their destin'd Course the Depths pursue,</L>
<L>And Clouds obsequious drop their pearly Dew:</L>
<L>My Son! from Wisdom do thou ne'er depart,</L>
<L>And sound Discretion treasure in thy Heart;</L>
<L>So shall they add, while Years on Years do roll,</L>
<L>Grace to thy Neck, and Life unto thy Soul;</L>
<L>Then shalt thou walk securely in thy Way,</L>
<L>No guileful Passion shall thy Steps betray:</L>
<L><PB N="229" REF="244"/>When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid,</L>
<L>Thy Sleep be sweet, no frightful Dreams invade;</L>
<L>Be not dismay'd, when Desolation wide</L>
<L>O'er takes the Wicked, for the Lord thy Guide,</L>
<L>Shall lead thee forth, thy Foot shall make full fast,</L>
<L>Until his righteous Vengeance be o'er-past:</L>
<L>Withhold not Good from them to whom 'tis due,</L>
<L>When in the Power of thy Hand to do;</L>
<L>Let not the Poor distrest e'er sue in vain,</L>
<L>Put him not off, nor bid him come again;</L>
<L>Say not To-morrow I'll thy Wants relieve,</L>
<L>With Joy embrace the present Now to give:</L>
<L>Hurt not the Man who in thee puts his Trust,</L>
<L>Nor give him Cause to say thou art unjust:</L>
<L>Strive not with him who never meant thee Ill,</L>
<L>Th' Oppressor envy not, nor approve his Will;</L>
<L>For God abominates the froward Heart,</L>
<L>But to the Righteous doth his Will impart;</L>
<L>Curses that House that hath his Laws withstood,</L>
<L>But Blessings fill the Dwellings of the Good:</L>
<L>Surely the Scorner, he shall ever scorn,</L>
<L>But Grace and Wisdom shall the Meek adorn;</L>
<L>Honour and Glory shall attend the Wise,</L>
<L>But Fools on ignominious Shame shall rise.</L>

<LG>
<L>OUR <HI>English Homer</HI> in his Rhimes,</L>
<L>Asserts our Notions change with Times;</L>
<L>This Maxim granted, makes me doubt,</L>
<L>When some few Years are whirl'd about,</L>
<L>Whether my present System then,</L>
<L>May not give Way to some new Plan:</L>
<L>Now would the Gods not take amiss,</L>
<L>What I've to ask, it should be this:</L>
<L>Let me from vile Dependance free,</L>
<L>Enjoy the Sweets of Liberty;</L>
<L>Let no vain upstart Purse-proud Fool,</L>
<L>Or o'er my Mind, or Person rule;</L>
<L>Lording it with a thousand Airs,</L>
<L><HI>Drawcansir</HI>-like because he dares;</L>
<L>Let no vile Knave with smooth Address,</L>
<L>Deceive me cloak'd in Friendship's Dress:</L>
<L>From lukewarm Friends, ye Gods! preserve me,</L>
<L>Who'll nothing do—but wish—to serve me:</L>
<L>My Fortune, Heaven! be it such,</L>
<L>One nor too scanty, nor too much:</L>
<L>Oh! let me in the Midway steer,</L>
<L>And keep myself from Lawsuits clear;</L>
<L>Placed some half-score Miles from Town,</L>
<L>Where I could easily ride down;</L>
<L><PB N="231" REF="246" MS="y"/>I'd have a little Country Seat,</L>
<L>One that is elegant and neat;</L>
<L>No pompous Thing to strike the Eye,</L>
<L>Of each Beholder passing by;</L>
<L>But as fam'd <HI>Horace</HI> once did say,</L>
<L><HI>Simplex munditiis</HI> be the Thing:</L>
<L>Thus the exterior, then within</L>
<L>All should be decent neat and clean;</L>
<L>Yet still I other Notions have,</L>
<L>Than to that Neatness be a Slave;</L>
<L>No sawcy Servant there should lour,</L>
<L>Give herself Airs, look crabb'd or sour;</L>
<L>If I or Friend trod off the Matt;</L>
<L>No, no, I would have none of that;</L>
<L>Neither would I thus you treat,</L>
<L>To make you pay for what you eat;</L>
<L>No one should stare you in the Face,</L>
<L>And seem to ask with awkward Grace;</L>
<L>Or blund'ring on before you stand,</L>
<L>Watching the Motion of your Hand;</L>
<L>Nor an officious prating Fool,</L>
<L>Nor fawning Wretch should there bear Rule.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When at my Leisure, void of Care,</L>
<L>Books some Part of it should share;</L>
<L>Antients or Moderns, Verse or Prose,</L>
<L>As Inclination should dispose;</L>
<L><HI>Pope, Dryden, Addison</HI> and <HI>Boyle,</HI></L>
<L>I own I should prefer to <HI>Hoyle;</HI></L>
<L><PB N="232" REF="247"/><HI>Prior!</HI> you should tell a Story;</L>

<L>Who can enough thy Beauties Praise,</L>
<L>Thy happy, easy graceful Lays;</L>
<L>When you in tuneful Numbers shew,</L>
<L>That all is Vanity below?</L>
<L><HI>Congreve!</HI> thy free Dramatic Page,</L>
<L>Should trace the Foibles of the Age;</L>
<L><HI>Shakespeare!</HI> thy Flights unrivall'd shew,</L>
<L>What simple Nature once could do:</L>
<L>Or on <HI>Milton</HI>'s Wing I'd soar,</L>
<L>Traverse thro' Worlds untrac'd before;</L>
<L>Or with <HI>Homer, Virgil</HI> climb,</L>
<L>Noting from them the true Sublime;</L>
<L>Or <HI>Horace</HI>'s genteelest Art,</L>
<L>Should useful moral Truths impart:</L>
<L><HI>Ovid, Tibullus,</HI> many more,</L>
<L>Whom I've not Time to reckon o'er;</L>
<L>Should all alternately take place,</L>
<L>And be receiv'd with welcome Grace:</L>
<L>But 'tis no Rule because I read,</L>
<L>And now and then talk with the Dead;</L>
<L>That I by Books should be engrost,</L>
<L>To ev'ry other Joy be lost:</L>
<L>No—soon as the Morning's chearful Grey,</L>
<L>Gleams thro' the Clouds, and hails the Day;</L>
<L><PB N="233" REF="248"/>When with awful solemn State,</L>
<L>All Nature hush'd, seems then to wait</L>
<L>Light's grand Approach—</L>
<L>All but the Cock, whose clam'rous Voice,</L>
<L>Proclaims the same with shrilling Noise:</L>
<L>Long e'er <HI>Phoebus</HI> gilds the Tops</L>
<L>Of Mountains bleak, or drinks the Drops</L>
<L>Of balmy Dews, which Heav'n does yeild,</L>
<L>Long before that I'd take the Field:</L>
<L>With Horse and Hounds would chase the Hare,</L>
<L>Drink in large Draughts of vital Air:</L>
<L>Horses and Dogs, a motley Shew!</L>
<L>High mettl'd both with Ardour glow;</L>
<L>With Nose sagace the sprightly Hound,</L>
<L>Should trail her o'er the tainted Ground;</L>
<L>Hark! hark! what Music in their Crys?</L>
<L>How ev'ry Note doth higher rise!</L>
<L>The Hills, the Dales, the Woods rebound,</L>
<L>Re-echo warm the gladsome Sound:</L>
<L>The Hare's gone off, I d' impel the Chace,</L>
<L>Pursue her thro' each winding Maze;</L>
<L>Her artful Shifts at length evade</L>
<L>The eager Hound—the Tract she made,</L>
<L>Now dubious grown—the Hounds at Fault,</L>
<L>Now here, now there, now run, now halt:</L>
<L>Hark! to <HI>Rattler</HI>—she's now in View,</L>
<L>The joyous Dogs more close pursue;</L>
<L><PB N="234" REF="249"/>I cheer them on, away she flies,</L>
<L>Men, Horses, Dogs too fly—she dies:</L>
<L>Such Sports as these do Vigour give,</L>
<L>And blest with that we truly live;</L>
<L>Return'd from these we better taste,</L>
<L>Our Studies, or Love's sweet Repast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Another Time, some other Morn,</L>
<L>I'd range o'er Field that's newly shorn;</L>
<L>With Gun in Hand would softly steal,</L>
<L><HI>Sancho</HI> attending at my Heel;</L>
<L>With wary circumspective Eyes,</L>
<L>The little Family he spies;</L>
<L>He winds 'em, points me where they lie,</L>
<L>The feather'd Folk disturbed fly;</L>
<L>The leaden Death conveys the Wound,</L>
<L>A Brace falls whirling to the Ground:</L>
<L>Alas! that we should owe our Joy,</L>
<L>To what we wantonly destroy:</L>
<L><HI>Sancho</HI> now gallops o'er the Field,</L>
<L>And proud his best Respects to yield,</L>
<L>With smiling Looks and fond Caress,</L>
<L>Wishes me Joy of my Success:</L>
<L>I thank him, pat his Head, and then</L>
<L>With eager Haste I charge again:</L>
<L>Thus on—till weary of the Roam,</L>
<L>I call him off and seek my Home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes I'd try my Greyhound's Pow'r,</L>
<L>Give Puss due Law and let her scow'r;</L>
<L><PB N="235" REF="250"/>See! o'er the extended Lawn she flies,</L>
<L>The Dog his utmost Effort tries;</L>
<L>With Speed as quick almost as Sight,</L>
<L>He strives to intercept her Flight;</L>
<L>Strains ev'ry Nerve to turn her back,</L>
<L>You'd think his very Eye-balls crack:</L>
<L>Puss, fond of Life, outstrips the Wind,</L>
<L>The Dog lies chopping close behind;</L>
<L>And now hard-run, she tacks about,</L>
<L>With Art evasive throws him out;</L>
<L>The Dog his Glee still adding Strength,</L>
<L>Recovers her within a Length;</L>
<L>Both now near spent with dubious Strife,</L>
<L>Puss gets to Cover, saves her Life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When I am in less gayer Mood,</L>
<L>And more dispos'd for Solitude;</L>
<L>In the cool Decline of Day,</L>
<L>I'd to the Riv'let take my Way;</L>
<L>There to decoy the finny Race,</L>
<L>Their various Haunts and Holes would trace;</L>
<L>Under Pretence of proffer'd Good,</L>
<L>Would drag 'em from their native Flood;</L>
<L>Unless they cautiously beware,</L>
<L>And shun the sly intended Snare:</L>
<L>Ah! how too oft is this the Way,</L>
<L>That Men on one another prey:</L>
<L>Now Hopes and Fears alternate rise,</L>
<L>Suspend the Mind in equal Poise;</L>
<L><PB N="236" REF="251"/>I feel him nibbling at my Hook,</L>
<L>I see him too, so clear the Brook;</L>
<L>What various Turns, what Rounds he takes!</L>
<L>What different Attacks he makes!</L>
<L>How oft retreats! the tempting Prize</L>
<L>Grows still more lovely to his Eyes;</L>
<L>Lures him still on, he 'ttempts again,</L>
<L>But fear his Wishes doth restrain;</L>
<L>'Till bolder grown, he takes the Bait,</L>
<L>Ventures too far, and meets his Fate:</L>
<L>So have I seen an heedless Youth,</L>
<L>Reluctant quit the Paths of Truth;</L>
<L>'Till by Degrees he plunges on,</L>
<L>And finds too late himself undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor so engag'd in rural Sport,</L>
<L>Would I neglect the social Sort;</L>
<L>Each honest Man should welcome be,</L>
<L>My Friends I should be glad to see;</L>
<L>With them my Soul I would unbend,</L>
<L>With them the cheerful Ev'ning spend:</L>
<L>The sparkling Glass or friendly Bowl,</L>
<L>With temp'rate Mirth should tune the Soul;</L>
<L>The Song with Sentiments refin'd,</L>
<L>Music should elevate the Mind;</L>
<L>Freedom and Ease should here take place,</L>
<L>Politeness heighten ev'ry Grace;</L>
<L>No Nonsense loud, or roaring Noise,</L>
<L>Should here confound our social Joys;</L>
<L><PB N="237" REF="252"/>No impious Jest should pass for Wit,</L>
<L>Nor fulsome Ribaldry unfit;</L>
<L>The mean, the low, ill-manner'd Sneer,</L>
<L>Should meet with no Reception here:</L>
<L>No Tale obscene should give Offence,</L>
<L>Betraying Want of better Sense;</L>
<L>No senseless Pun should Mirth excite,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to laugh, or wrong, or right:</L>
<L>Far hence be these mean vulgar Ways,</L>
<L>We want not these our Mirth to raise;</L>
<L>Let Fools and Blockheads count for Joys,</L>
<L>Such wretched Stuff, such empty Noise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Neither I here my Joys would end,</L>
<L>Some of a softer Kind attend;</L>
<L>Visit the Circle of the Fair,</L>
<L>Th' Assembly gay and debonair:</L>
<L>O! how sweet the Morning Breeze,</L>
<L>Sweeter still the Talk of these;</L>
<L>To taste 'em both I would resort,</L>
<L>To <HI>Putney, Dulwich,</HI> or <HI>Ruckholt:</HI></L>
<L>What various Scenes upon the Green!</L>
<L>The World in Miniature is seen:</L>
<L>Here Belles and Beaus, and Smarts and Wits,</L>
<L>Jostle with Quality and Cits:</L>
<L>See! here the Lady <HI>Dishabille,</HI></L>
<L>There the modish <HI>Ma'amoiselle:</HI></L>
<L>Here hoyd'ning Miss brimful of Laughter;</L>
<L>Miss of Threescore still hobbles after:</L>
<L><PB N="238" REF="253"/>Survey the whole and look around,</L>
<L>What diff'rent Figuers may be found!</L>
<L>The Tall, the Short, the Young, the Old,</L>
<L>The Gay, the Grave, the Coy, the Bold:</L>
<L>—See! the affected vain Coquette;</L>
<L>The Prude can't here her Airs forget:</L>
<L><HI>Delia</HI> reserv'd, puts on Disdain,</L>
<L>Giving herself the greatest Pain;</L>
<L>In vain she acts the mimic Part,</L>
<L>Her sparkling Eyes betray her Heart:</L>
<L>Proud <HI>Flavia</HI> with an haughty Grace,</L>
<L>Demands your Homage to her Face;</L>
<L><HI>Belinda</HI> with neglectful Air,</L>
<L>Consigns her Lovers to Despair:</L>
<L>Not that I would be thought to mean,</L>
<L>That nothing else fills up the Scene;</L>
<L>No, no; see! what a blooming Grace,</L>
<L>Sits smiling on <HI>Amanda</HI>'s Face;</L>
<L>What Ease! what unaffected Air!</L>
<L>Attends the lovely <HI>Mira</HI> there;</L>
<L>Their native Charms disdaining Art,</L>
<L>At first Sight captivate the Heart:</L>
<L>No Pride, Ill-nature, there appear,</L>
<L>Affected Scorn, invidious Leer;</L>
<L>Wit and Good-humour, ever gay,</L>
<L>In Loves and Smiles around them play:</L>
<L>O! how sweet with these to walk,</L>
<L>O! how sweet with these to talk;</L>
<L><PB N="239" REF="254"/>Or blest with <HI>Stella</HI> to advance,</L>
<L>And join the rest in sprightly Dance:</L>
<L>Where Beauty and Politeness meet,</L>
<L>The Bliss must needs be then complete;</L>
<L>Their Converse sure must raise the Mind,</L>
<L>Give us the Pleasure most refin'd;</L>
<L>To the Fair Sex alone we owe,</L>
<L>The Sweets that from Politeness flow;</L>
<L>Such Influence their Charms impart,</L>
<L>They soften and enlarge the Heart;</L>
<L>They all our ruffl'd Passions sooth,</L>
<L>They all our rugged Natures smooth;</L>
<L>Insensibly by them refin'd,</L>
<L>We grow benevolent and kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus let me pass my Hours away,</L>
<L>Serene—or innocently gay;</L>
<L>But still to taste the Sweets of Life,</L>
<L>Grant me, kind Heav'n! a virtuous Wife;</L>
<L>No domineering high-flown Dame,</L>
<L>Superiority to claim:</L>
<L>A Mistress some would sooner keep,</L>
<L>Than e'er with such a Vixen sleep:</L>
<L>In this Affair, it is most fit,</L>
<L>That chiefly Love the Knot should knit;</L>
<L>A mere Wife's what I can't but hate,</L>
<L>Joyless and flat that wedded State:</L>
<L>Give me the She in whom contend,</L>
<L>The fairest with the faithful Friend;</L>
<L><PB N="240" REF="255"/>One whose beauteous Face invites,</L>
<L>To taste of <HI>Hymen</HI>'s sacred Rites;</L>
<L>One whose Virtue, Manners, Truth,</L>

<L>One whose Dress isn't all her Care,</L>
