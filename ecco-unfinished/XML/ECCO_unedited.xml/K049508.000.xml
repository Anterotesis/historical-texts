<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Poem was written last summer, immediately after the publication of Sir William Chambers's Dissertation; but the bookseller, to whom it was offered, diclined publishing it, till the town was full. His reason for this is obvious; yet it would hardly have weigh'd with the author, had he not thought, that his hero's fame would increase in proportion to his publisher's profit. However he foresaw, that, by this delay, one inconvenience might arise, which this preface is written to remove. Readers of the present generation are so very inattentive to what they read, that it is probable, one half of Sir William's may have forgotten the principles which his book inculcates. Let these, then, be reminded, that it is the author's pro∣fest aim in extolling the taste of the Chinese, to condemn
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
that mean and paltry manner which Kent introduced, which Southcote, Hamilton, and Brown followed, and which, to our national disgrace, is called the English style of garden∣ing. He shews the poverty of this taste, by aptly com∣paring it to a dinner, which consisted of three gross pieces, three times repeated; and proves to a demonstration, that Nature herself is incapable of pleasing, without the assistance of Art, and that too of the most luxuriant kind. In short, such art as is displayed in the Emperor's garden of Yven-Ming-Yven, near Pekin; where fine lizards, and fine wo∣men, human giants, and giant baboons, make but a small part of the superb scenery. He teaches us, that a perfect garden must contain within itself all the amusements of a great city; that <HI>Urbs in rure</HI>, not <HI>Rus in urbe</HI>, is the thing, which an improver of true taste ought to aim at. He says —but it is impossible to abridge all that he says:—Let this therefore suffice, to tempt the reader again to peruse his invaluable Dissertation, since without it, he will never re∣lish half the beauties of the following epistle; for (if her Majesty's Zebra, and the powder-mills at Hounslow be ex∣cepted)
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
there is scarce a single image in it, which is not taken from that work.</P>
<P>But though the images be borrowed, the author claims some small merit from his application of them. Sir Wil∣liam says too modestly, "that European artists must not hope to rival Oriental splendor." The poet shews, that European artists may easily rival it; and, that Richmond gardens, with only the addition of a new bridge to join them to Brentford, may be new modelled, perfectly <HI>à la Chinois</HI>. He exhorts his Knight to undertake the glorious task, and leaves no cause to doubt, but that, under the auspicious patronage he now so justly enjoys, added to the <HI>ready</HI> vote of those, who furnish ways and means, the royal work will speedily be compleated.</P>

<HEAD>AN HEROIC EPISTLE TO SIR WILLIAM CHAMBERS, Knight, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<L>KNIGHT of the Polar Star! by Fortune plac'd,</L>
<L>To shine the Cynosure of British taste;</L>
<L>Whose orb collects, in one refulgent view,</L>
<L>The scatter'd glories of Chinese Virtù;</L>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Verse 2.</BIBL>
[Cynosure of British taste]. Cynosure, an affected phrase. Cynosura is the constellation of Ursa Minor, or the Lesser Bear, the next star to the Pole. Dr. Newton, on the word in Milton.</NOTE>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>And spread their lustre in so broad a blaze,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>That Kings themselves are dazzled, while they gaze.</L>
<L>O let the Muse attend thy march sublime,</L>
<L>And, with thy prose, caparison her rhyme;</L>
<L>Teach her, like thee, to gild her splendid song,</L>
<L>With scenes of Yven-Ming, and sayings of Li-Tsong;<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>Like thee to scorn Dame Nature's simple fence;</L>
<L>Leap each Ha Ha of truth and common sense;</L>
<L>And proudly rising in her bold career,</L>
<L>Demand attention from the gracious ear</L>
<L>Of Him, whom we and all the world admit,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Patron supreme of science, taste, and wit.</L>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Verse 10.</BIBL>
[With scenes of Yven-Ming.] One of the Imperial gardens at Pekin. [Sayings of Li-Tsong.] "Many trees, shrubs, and flowers," sayeth Li-Tsong, a Chi∣nese author of great antiquity, "thrive best in low, moist situations; many on hills and mountains; some require a rich soil; but others will grow on clay, in sand, or even upon rocks, and in the water: to some a sunny exposition is necessary; but for others the shade is preferable. There are plants which thrive best in exposed situations, but in general, shelter is requisite. The skilful gardener, to whom study and experience have taught these qualities, carefully attends to them in his operations; knowing that thereon depend the health and growth of his plants; and consequently the beauty of his plantations." Vide Diss. p. 77. The reader, I presume, will readily allow, that he never met with much recondite truth, as this ancient Chinese here exhibits.</NOTE>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>Does Envy doubt? Witness ye chosen train!</L>
<L>Who breathe the sweets of his Saturnian reign;</L>
<L>Witness ye H*lls, ye J*ns*ns, Sc*ts, S*bb*s,</L>
<L>Hark to my call, for some of you have ears.<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Let D**d H*e, from the remotest North,</L>
<L>In see-saw sceptic scruples hint his worth;</L>
<L>D**d, who there supinely deigns to lye</L>
<L>The fattest Hog of Epicurus' sty;</L>
<L>Tho' drunk with Gallic wine, and Gallic praise,<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>D**d shall bless Old England's halcyon days;</L>
<L>The mighty Home bemir'd in prose so long,</L>
<L>Again shall stalk upon the stilts of song;</L>
<L>While bold Mac-Ossian, wont in Ghosts to deal,</L>
<L>Bids candid Smollet from his coffin steal;<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Bids Mallock quit his sweet Elysian rest,</L>
<L>Sunk in his St. John's philosophic breast,</L>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Verse 34.</BIBL>
[Truth at Court.] Vide (if it be extant) a poem under this title, for which (or for the publication of Lord Bolingbroke's philosophical writings) the person here mentioned, received a considerable pension in the time of Lord B—te's administration.</NOTE>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8"/>And, like old Orpheus, make some strong effort</L>
<L>To come from Hell, and warble <HI>truth at Court</HI>.</L>
<L>There was a time, "in Esher's peaceful grove,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>"When Kent and Nature vy'd for Pelham's love,</L>
<L>That Pope beheld them with auspicious smile,</L>
<L>And own'd that Beauty blest their mutual toil.</L>
<L>Mistaken Bard! could such a pair design</L>
<L>Scenes fit to live in thy immortal line?<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Hadst thou been born in this enlighten'd day,</L>
<L>Felt, as we feel, Taste's oriental ray,</L>
<L>Thy satire sure had given them both a stab,</L>
<L>Called Kent a Driveller, and the Nymph a Drab.</L>
<L>For what is Nature? Ring her changes round,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>Her three flat notes are water, plants, and ground;</L>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Verse 45.</BIBL>
[For what is Nature?] This is the great and fundamental axiom, on which oriental taste is founded. It is therefore expressed here with the greatest preci∣sion, and in the identical phrase of the great original. The figurative terms, and even the explanatory simile are entirely borrowed from Sir William's Dissertation. "<HI>Nature</HI> (says the Chinese, or Sir William for them) affords us but few materials to work with. <HI>Plants, ground</HI>, and <HI>water</HI>, are her only productions; and, though both the forms and arrange∣ments of these may be varied to an incredible degree, yet have they but few striking va∣rieties, the rest being of the nature of <HI>changes rung upon bells</HI>, which, though in reality dif∣ferent, still produce the same uniform kind of <HI>gingling</HI>; the variation being too minute to be easily perceived." "<HI>Art</HI> must therefore supply <HI>the scantiness of Nature</HI>," &amp;c. &amp;c. page 14. And again, "Our larger works are only a repetition of the small ones, <HI>like the honest Bache∣lor's feast</HI>, which consisted in nothing but a multiplication of his own dinner; <HI>three legs of mutton and turneps, three roasted geese, and three buttered apple-pies</HI>." Preface, page 7.</NOTE>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>Prolong the peal, yet spite of all your clatter,</L>
<L>The tedious chime is still ground, plants, and water.</L>
<L>So, when some John his dull invention racks,</L>
<L>To rival Boodle's dinners, or Almack's,<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>Three uncouth legs of mutton shock our eyes,</L>
<L>Three roasted geese, three butter'd apple-pies.</L>
<L>Come then, prolific Art, and with thee bring</L>
<L>The charms that rise from thy exhaustless spring;</L>
<L>To Richmond come, for see, untutor'd Brown<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>Destroys those wonders which were once thy own.</L>
<L>Lo, from his melon-ground the peasant slave</L>
<L>Has rudely rush'd, and levell'd Merlin's Cave;</L>
<L>Knock'd down the waxen Wizzard, seiz'd his wand,</L>
<L>Transform'd to lawn what late was Fairy land;<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>And marr'd, with impious hand, each sweet design</L>
<L>Of Stephen Duck, and good Queen Caroline.</L>
<L>Haste, bid yon livelong Terras re-ascend,</L>
<L>Replace each vista, straighten every bend;</L>
<L>Shut out the Thames; shall that ignoble thing<MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>Approach the presence of great Ocean's King?</L>
<L>No! let Barbaric glories feast his eyes,</L>
<L>August Pagodas round his palace rise,</L>
<L>And finish'd Richmond open to his view,</L>
<L>"A work to wonder at, perhaps a" Kew.<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>Nor rest we here, but, at our magic call,</L>
<L>Monkies shall climb our trees, and lizards crawl;</L>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Verse 67.</BIBL>
<P>[No! let Barbaric glories.] So Milton.</P>
<Q><L>"Where the gorgeous east with richest hand</L>
<L>Showers on her Kings <HI>Barbaric</HI> pearl and gold."</L></Q>
<BIBL>Verse 72.</BIBL>
<P>[Monkies shall climb our trees.] "In their lofty woods <HI>serpents</HI> and <HI>lizards</HI> of many beautiful sorts crawl upon the ground. Innumerable <HI>monkies, cats</HI>, and <HI>par∣rots</HI> clamber upon the trees." Page 40. "In their lakes are many <HI>islands</HI>, some small, some large, amongst which are often seen stalking along, <HI>the elephant</HI>, the rhinoceros, the dromedary, ostrich, and the giant baboon." page 66. "They keep in their inchanted scenes, a surprizing variety of monstrous birds, reptiles and animals, which are tamed by art, and guarded by enormous <HI>dogs of Tibet</HI> and <HI>African giants</HI>, in the habits of magi∣cians." Page 42. "Sometimes in this romantic excursion, the passenger finds himself in extensive recesses, surrounded with arbours of jessamine, vine, and roses; where beau∣teous <HI>Tartarean damsels</HI>, in loose transparent robes that flutter in the air, present him with rich wines, &amp;c. and invite him to taste the sweets of retirement, on Persian carpets, and beds of Camusathkin down." Page 40.</P>
<BIBL>Verse 84.</BIBL>
<P>[Thy gibbets, Bagshot.] "Their scenes of terror are composed of gloomy woods, &amp;c. <HI>gibbets</HI>, crosses, wheels, and the whole apparatus of torture are seen from the roads. Here too they conceal in cavities, on the summits of the highest moun∣tains, foundaries, lime-kilns, and glass works, which send forth large volumes of flame, and continued columns of thick smoke, that give to these mountains the appearance of Volcanos." Page 37. "Here the passenger from time to time, is surprized with repeated shocks of electrical impulse; the earth trembles under him by the power of con∣fined air," &amp;c. Page 39. Now to produce both these effects, viz. the appearance of vol∣canos and earthquakes, we have here substituted the occasional explosion of a <HI>powder-mill</HI>, which (if there be not too much simplicity in the contrivance) it is apprehended will at once answer all the purposes of <HI>lime-kilns</HI>, and <HI>electrical machines</HI>, and imitate <HI>thunder</HI>, and the <HI>explosion of cannon</HI> into the bargain. Vide page 40.</P>
<BIBL>Verse 87.</BIBL>
<P>[Here too, O King of Vengeance, &amp;c.] "In the most dismal recesses of the woods, are temples dedicated to the <HI>King of Vengeance</HI>, near which are placed pillars of stone, with <HI>pathetic descriptions of tragical events</HI>; and many acts of cruelty perpetrated there by <HI>outlaws</HI> and <HI>robbers</HI>." Page 37.</P>
