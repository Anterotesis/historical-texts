<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I meditate on my age and my
compatriots, I gaze on numerous fol∣lies,
and trace some horrors. This view
exhibits nothing peculiar or extraordinary;
the human mind has it's few stated eras;
it proceeds till it touches it's limits, and
then with a retrograde step returns on
itself. There is much less novelty in
glaring follies and audacious crimes, than
vulgar fools and vulgar villains shall ever
conceive.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Every age seems characterised by some
prevailing extravagance, and every emi∣nent
philosopher has distinguished himself
by some novel system; when the age
closed, the extravagance and the philoso∣pher
were alike forgotten. Men once
confined their speculations to nature, but
nature is exhaustless, and man is soon
exhausted. They then proceeded to mind,
but what we call intelligence has ever
been unintelligible to man. We now unite
matter with mind. A few sublimely in∣dustrious,
and modestly great geniuses
have confessed, that these baffle our re∣searches,
and proclaim man an imperfect
being; some <HI>soi-disant</HI> philosophers, in
the temerity of their ignorance, pretend to
have discovered in man “an infinite per∣fectibility!”</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
But had our present philosophy proved,
like former romances of closet recluses,
the dreams of metaphysics, he who is
versed in the history of human nature
would not consider it as an object of
importance. A mere metaphysician never
yet influenced even the obscure street he
inhabited; the vortexes of Descartes, the
monads of Leibnitz, the spirit of Berkley,
or the matter of Spinosa, with other
dreams too numerous and too idle to
mention, could only amuse or weary an
inconsiderable portion of society. The
sophists of Greece felt the shrewdness
and the humour of Lucian, and the Je∣suits
of France, the wit and eloquence of
Pascal. Ridicule is at least an admirable
test of the ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
But within this half-century it has
become the artifice of a dangerous class of
men to unite politics with metaphysics,
and, great God! what politics! Here
my little reading deserts me, and I am to
be informed, whether yet the world has
known a philosophical system, which has
for it's avowed purpose a political sys∣tem?</P>
<P>We live, indeed, in sickly and distem∣pered
times; the MARVELLOUS only
interests; it is easier to excite our won∣der
than to satisfy our judgment; it is
the taste of the nursery; it is a childish
taste; we shun instruction, and wander
for puerility. Some assure us that the
human mind is in it's infancy; I fear it
is in it's dotage; and we therefore do
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
not differ respecting the objects adapted
for it's amusement.</P>
<P>This philosophy is imagined to have
derived it's origin from the labours of
Voltaire. It is a calumny on that power∣ful
genius. Voltaire, in no part of his
voluminous works, indulges it's romantic
absurdities; every where he affirms that
the mind and faculties of man are limit∣ed,
and that to feel our ignorance and
imperfection is the end of all our studies.
A race of writers, inferior in taste and ge∣nius,
to exceed the sagacity of their great
master, have promulgated their monstrous
hyperboles. The editors of Voltaire's
works have inserted a commentary of
this kind to combat the modest wisdom
of this penetrating genius. Helvetius,
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
Condorcet, and Mirabeau are among
those who have sought celebrity by novel
extravagancies. It is these men, who have
temerariously talked of <HI>calculating events</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To <HI>calculate</HI> has become the colloquial jargon of the French; thus Barras asked the American ambassador, “Have you <HI>calculated</HI> the consequences of your treaty with England?” and the <HI>Redacteur</HI> (the Gazette of the directory) observed on the sail∣ing of the French fleet for Ireland, “The expedi∣tion cannot fail; it has been well <HI>calculated.</HI>”</NOTE>
which so often depend on accident; have
loudly triumphed in <HI>first principles,</HI> ever
concealed mysteriously from us; and of the
<HI>infinite perfectibility</HI> of our mind and organs,
which, scarcely arrived at their existence,
perish before the eyes of those who de∣claim
on their eternity. These philoso∣phers
support their system by dwelling on
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
what is <HI>not known;</HI> we oppose them by
what <HI>is known;</HI> that is, we oppose human
nature to a few metaphysicians.</P>
<P>This doctrine has been servilely follow∣ed
by some living writers in this country.
Their politics are much more intelligible
than their metaphysics. Romantic ex∣travagance
in philosophy might be easily
forgiven; it were but the fermentation
of some noble and elevated minds, and,
like the froth floating on the surface of
a rich liquor, we would blow it away, and
taste the nectar beneath; but of these
men we will not taste the sophisticated
draughts, for they
<Q><L>“—have drugged their possets,</L>
<L>That death and nature would contend about us,</L>
<L>Whether to live or die—”</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
And let <HI>some</HI> of them apply the rest
of the quotation; they have projected
their work of death; but they now feel
what a female Cataline felt in her dread
of disappointed assassination:
<Q><L>“—the attempt, and not the deed,</L>
<L>Confounds us—yet we laid their daggers ready!”</L></Q></P>
<P>When I reflect on our religions, I per∣ceive
innumerable sects: among the
people the hottest fanaticism, among phi∣losophers
the most extravagant projects,
and among those who are neither people
nor philosophers the most ridiculous mysti∣cism.
Philosophy has no religion; reli∣gion
has no philosophy; an extermina∣tion
is menaced, and an union is alike
rejected. The religion of Christ is the
purest philosophy. I grieve, therefore,
to see Mustis in the church of Jesus.
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
The warmth and imbecility of certain
bigots resembles the state of those un∣happy
beings, who is the last stage of a
consumption find that their heat is only
the effect of their debility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Some,</HI> we all fear, would commit a sacrilege against humanity for a mitre, as Bellarmin did for a cardinal's hat. He maintained, for the sake of his promotion, that “if the Pope forbid the exercise of virtue, and command that of vice, the Roman church, under pain of a sin, was ob∣liged to abandon virtue for vice, <HI>nisi vellet con∣scientiam peccare.</HI>” We have Bellarmins in poli∣tics and religion: a vast and aweful interval se∣parates a Bellarmin, a Whitaker, and a Horsley, from a WATSON!</NOTE>. If Christia∣nity
is ever to fix the affections of man∣kind,
it can only be by the virtues and
moderation of it's chiefs; to the clergy
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
we look up, at this vacillating moment,
with hope or with despair.</P>
<P>When I enter the world of manners, I
see with indignation our prodigality and
our avarice. This age, even from it's
satirist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Cowper, I think, calls Brown's Estimate of the Times, in his prosaic and nervous verse,</P>
<P>“The inestimable Estimate of Brown.”</P></NOTE>, has received the distinctive
praise of humanity; but this humanity
is but a mode of our pervading dissipa∣tion;
our hearts, like our fortunes, are
indulged in excessive gratifications, and
alike become feeble, cold, and exhausted.
Hence we see, that the sentimentalist is
at a certain period of life the most un∣feeling,
and the most voluble on sensibi∣lity.
Enormous wealth is obtained by
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
enormous speculations; we have become
a nation of jobbers; hence, the refuse of
society are raised to fix the popular re∣gard;
the slime of the bed is unnaturally
tossed up, and floats on the clear current
of public honour. Every where the in∣dividual
does every thing for the public
eye, and nothing for domestic enjoyment;
we vie with each other; we sacrifice, and
we are sacrificed.</P>
<P>There are some popular prejudices
cruel in their effects. To trace and to
expose them is philosophical morality.
I have selected one in the history of a
female in this work, who was originally
found in the streets as a prostitute; and
the unjust and melancholy consequences
of that situation to herself and to her
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
friends form the axis on which the
wheel of fortune revolves in this history.
If the filial character of Emily should
exhibit the miseries of a splendid depen∣dence,
in a young and accomplished
woman, it will not form an insignificant
personage in this drama of life.</P>
<P>Such is the analysis of these Sketches.
I have chosen the <HI>form</HI> rather than the
<HI>matter</HI> of a novel. Some bold and im∣partial
truths are contained in these little
volumes; it is however possible to be
too partial to some opinions, without
being of any party.</P>
<P>My sincerity is ardent, and if I ap∣pear
to prefer one side to another, it is
because otherwise we can have no princi∣ple
of action. In this country, popular
opinion has reached two opposite extre∣mities;
<PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>
when one party will yield no∣thing,
the other will claim every thing.
Our press is however free, and if our
writers were sincere, it would be the
organ of the public voice; the correc∣tion
of our ministers, our sovereign,
and ourselves; but there are men who
would quench their monstrous hatreds
in the blood of him who only differs with
them in opinion. I have heard in public
places our government accused of in∣clining
towards sanguinary measures! and
by whom? By audacious traitors, who in
their dreams revel on massacres, whose
physiognomy betrays the wild and savage
nature of their hearts, who skulk in
petty confederacies in this our beloved
country, and shew that it is still free,
since they are permitted to vociserate
<PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>
their accusations of it's slavery. Liberty
is awefully loved by a Briton; it forms
his national religion; and since he has
lived to see it submitted to the caprices
of levity, to the pollutions of villainy, to
the temerity of coffee-house evening do∣tards,
and to the insane ignorance of the
tumultuous people, he drops a tear on
the venerable CONSTITUTION, and if
he injures it's spirit and it's canons, by
throwing all his weight on one of it's
portions, it is the innocent crime of ne∣cessity;
it is preferable to wrestle with a
sovereign, than with a convention;
<Q>“He flies from petty TYRANTS to the THRONE.”</Q></P>
<P>The expelled Marius sat amidst the
wrecks of Carthage; the blank horror
soothed the ferocious breast of the re∣publican,
and he gave a ghastly smile
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
on the aweful vestiges of departed gran∣deur.
The remorseless and terrible Sylla
flooded Rome with human blood, and
when the cries of a massacre were heard
in the alarmed senate, he thus addressed
them with a smile—“Conscript fathers!
let not our attention be interrupted, it is
only some traitors I have given orders to
punish.” France now has shewn the
world the eternal conflicts, the personal
hatreds, and the incalculable horrors of
republicanism; it is these men we fear,
and it is these men some traitors of Eng∣land
aspire, and secretly study, to emu∣late.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING read several detached pas∣sages
of this work to three or four
critical friends, I was much grieved in
observing their malicious promptness ap∣plying
the characters and reflections to
individuals. I was not much surprised
to observe, that the same character was
frequently given to different persons.</P>
<P>And here I most solemnly declare, that
these volumes contain not a single indi∣viduality;
at the same time, that there
is not one character, and scarcely one
incident, which is not founded on facts.
<PB N="xxi" REF="20"/>
In two or three places, where the attack
was meant to be personal, I have <HI>named</HI>
the persons, who are properly before the
public.</P>
<P>If such false criticisms were to deter
the Novelist from the duty he owes to
the public and to himself, we should lose
the most engaging and most instructive
class of literature. I shall only say here,
that I am a man who would blush to
court or fear another, whoever he might
be; and that no pusillanimity shall ever
be communicated to my free and honest
pen. Two great masters in the school,
in which I feel myself but a feeble
artist, have expressed themselves on this
subject, and although I would hope that
the passages are familiar to every reader,
yet from the frequent violation of the
true spirit of criticism, as rare as the true
spirit of genius, I fear they are either
little attended to, or have never been
<PB N="xxii" REF="21"/>
read, as some sagacious readers consider
<HI>Prefaces</HI> as so much waste paper. I shall,
however, transcribe these passages from
the Prefaces of these two great students
of human nature, and shall never af∣terwards
pay the slightest regard to the
malice of some readers. Fielding, in his
Preface to Joseph Andrews, says, “I
solemnly protest I have no intention to
vilify or asperse any one; for though
every thing is copied from the book of
nature, and scarce a character or action
produced, which I have not taken from
my own observation and experience, yet I
have used the utmost care to obscure the
persons by such different circumstances,
degrees, and colours, that it will be im∣possible
to guess at them with any degree
of certainty.”—Le Sage, in his Preface to
Gil Blas, has with an honest warmth de∣livered
his sentiments on a similar accusa∣tion.
“As there are some people who
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22"/>
cannot read without making applications
of the vicious and ludicrous characters
they meet with in works of this kind, I
declare to these mischievous readers, that
they will be to blame if they apply any
of the pictures drawn in this book. I
publicly own that my purpose is to re∣present
life as we find it; but God forbid
that I should undertake to delineate any
man in particular!”</P>
<P>Such are the declarations of these two
great masters; with them I should trem∣ble
at any other comparative trial, but in
a love of truth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Charles departs from his Country Friends,
who are Three divine Artists, born and
educated in their own Village.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reverend Mr. Hamilton, the
father of Charles, was a respected
clergyman, the resident of above half a
century in his own vicarage. His small
parsonage house was adjacent to his
church; it's venerable air of antiquity
resembled the genius of it's inhabitant;
and such was it's domestic sanctity, that
with greater propriety than the church
itself, it might have been called “a house
<PB N="2" REF="25"/>
of God.” No emulation of modern
taste disguised it's character; it was a
low building, the Gothic windows were
luxuriantly encircled with the foliage of
the vine, the hall was spacious, the par∣lours
small, but the pannelled wain∣scotting
was held by him in high re∣verence,
for it had been removed there
from one of Queen Elizabeth's coun∣try
palaces; and he would sometimes
point with exultation at a carved chimney-piece,
once appertaining to the above re∣gal
personage, and exclaim, “They work∣ed
on a different plan in those days; but I
promise you, none of our chimney-pieces
will be of any service to our posterity.”
Some of the juniors of this worthy parson,
who were among the three hundred and
ninety-nine chaplains of the Prince, who
doubled their livings and who tripled
their tythes, adding likewise a few random
chaplainships of several regiments, a plea∣sant
<PB N="3" REF="26"/>
prebend, and a comfortable canonry,
carried on a more lucrative trade, and
were, by such clerical advantages, enabled
to keep their stables in better repair than
their churches. Mr. Hamilton never
palsied the arm of industry with the iron
mace of sacerdotal rapacity. He was not
a weasel among the poultry, a rot among
the sheep, and a mildew in the ear of corn.
Every one cherished some pleasing re∣collection
of his kindness; and the hearts
of his parishioners were the concealed
offering the Priest presented to his God.</P>
<P>The good man had indeed an ex∣alted
idea of the character he had to
support, and it was long before he could
persuade himself to put on that holy
habit, which he wore with an aweful
delight. The self-respect he paid to
himself as a parish priest, rendered him
respectable. A parson (said he) is a title
familiarised into vulgarity; but it is the
<PB N="4" REF="27"/>
most aweful humanity can receive. <HI>Parson</HI>
is <HI>persona;</HI> because by his <HI>person</HI> he re∣presents
or <HI>personifies</HI> the church, which
is an invisible body. He alone is said,
<HI>Vicem seu personam ecclesiae gerere.</HI> And
this (he would add) is the law of the
land; the express words of Sir Edward
Coke; the alliance between church and
state. This alliance was one of his easiest
hobby-horses. But the most remarkable
of them was his voluminous labour on
the Trinity, the eternal object of his me∣ditations,
and the source of his felicity.
To adopt his very expressions, “It is a
mystery which we firmly believe the
truth of, and heartily adore the depth
of.”</P>
<P>And indeed the only remarkable event
in the quiet uniformity of this good man's
life, may be supposed to have happened
on the day that he published his “Evi∣dences
of the Trinity throughout all
<PB N="5" REF="28"/>
Nations.” That important day he dis∣tinguished
by allotting a roasted ox and
a butt of porter to the poor of his
parish; and we are sorry to record, that
this evidence of his rapture, and his be∣nevolence,
only served to increase the
charges of publication. Perhaps our
worthy Parson had done better in fol∣lowing
an old statute of the Religious of
the Citeaux, which ordered their abbots
to preach every Sunday, excepting on that
of the Trinity—<HI>propter difficultatem ma∣teriae.</HI></P>
<P>Charles was the only son of this ex∣cellent
man. In this calm and sequestered
spot his father inured him to those in∣tense
habits, which make the pupil the
semblance of the preceptor; as the shadow,
on the smooth and undisturbed surface of
the water, is an accurate representation of
the reflected object. Charles was con∣stitutionally
virtuous; his generous blood
<PB N="6" REF="29"/>
flowed with an equable gentleness; na∣ture
directed that prompt and active
sensation which looks like instinct, and
which performs the duties of humanity,
without the cold aid of philosophy;
acting better than it reasons. Some prin∣ciples
he had received from his father were
often at variance with his heart. A
system of religion, or politics, is the
fashion of a particular period; but the
emotions of humanity are the imperishable
virtues of every age; the former are but
ridiculous or fanciful dresses, which men
through custom adopt, while the latter
constitute the natural form of man, which
we may disguise, but can never alter.</P>
<P>Allied in blood to the noble family of
the Belfields, Charles had long received
the promise of their patronage, and the
proposal was now accepted. His vene∣rable
parent, reminded by his age, con∣sidered
this first as a final separation; and
<PB N="7" REF="30"/>
leading him into his library, enforced some
<HI>orthodox</HI> instructions, which had an in∣fluence
on the future life of our hero.
The last trembling pressure from the hand
of a revered parent; the touching and
interrupted tones of the voice we love, and
shall no more hear; the tear of senility
trickling on the glowing cheek of youth;
these at the moment penetrate the heart,
insert themselves amongit's fibres, and assi∣milate
with our existence. The tear is felt,
when he who sheds it, sheds tears no
more, and the voice of a father is heard
from his grave. Eventful moment of
existence in which we receive the in∣heritance
of a paternal character!</P>
<P>There were also two friends of his
father, inhabitants nearly as ancient as
himself of this parish, but their hobby-horsical
dispositions were of another cha∣racter,
being both devoted to works of
taste. Charles took his farewell of these
<PB N="8" REF="31"/>
two friends. The one was the Apothe∣cary,
who with tolerable facility com∣posed
much unreadable verse, and was
then employed on a couple of Epics;
three Centenaries of legitimate sonnets;
and on the point of publishing his Epi∣grams
in folio. The other was the Draw∣ing
Master, who was a Claude Lorraine;
that is, he painted Sun-sets, which were
mistaken for brick-kilns; hills, like wool∣sacks,
and trees, with on their tops that
indescribable grace, that “<HI>Je ne sçais quoi,</HI>”
that “<HI>Certo non so che</HI>” that “<HI>Nequeo
monstrare, et sentio tantum,</HI>” as Juvenal says
(how shall I express myself?) which
gave them a striking resemblance to a
row of barber's blocks, with each a little
unpowdered perriwig.</P>
<P>The poetical Apothecary thus addressed
him, “May your literary talents not have to
encounter the conspiracy which, as I have
often mentioned, has so long prevailed
<PB N="9" REF="32"/>
against me. I can write ten thousand verses
a year, but the age has grown horridly
prosaic. Discover this nefarious cabal,
now existing these forty years. The
Monthly Reviewers are at the head; for
on the publication of my first poem, they
had the audacity to ask me, why I did not
write in prose?”</P>
<P>The Painter said, “I have sent my
pictures to the Academy, and made annual
journies to London, to the utter ruin of
my business, to attend to that stimulating
applause which my native town (the
future biographer of English painters shall
record) has never given. Here they have
no eyes, and at London they have no
humanity. All my Sun-sets have been
hung in dark corners. Think of that,
Charles! a bad light to a picture is like
those errata in printing, which turn one's
finest things into nonsense. My Girl
feeding Pigs was hung so fatally last year,
<PB N="10" REF="33"/>
that I heard several wonder at the stupid
fancy of the painter, who placed asses in
pig-styes. To be sure the styes were
styes; I defy them there, Charles; but
my pigs really looked like asses! a curse
on all picture-hangers!”</P>
<P>Thus it happens, that when a Parson
publishes a volume concerning the Tri∣nity,
he proclaims the vice of the age to
be Arianism; the Poet, who composes
verses, that might occasion an indi∣gestion,
perceives the age to be prosaic;
while the Painter blasphemes the light
of heaven for not rendering the objects
of nature more conformable to his no∣tions.
These gentlemen were otherwise,
when not mounted on their great horses,
very honest men; so judicious, as clearly
to discern the absurdities of each other,
and so happy, as to enjoy the comfort
of not perceiving their own. But we
cannot but suspect, that if these honest
<PB N="11" REF="34"/>
gentlemen had, instead of mounting their
hobbies, enclosed some of the waste lands,
or only raised larger crops of potatoes, We,
and the Society for the Encouragement of
Agriculture, would have considered our∣selves
as under more particular ob∣ligations.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some of our Hero's first Acquaintance in
London.</HEAD>
<P>LONDON, that universe of a city,
containing all the climates of the
human mind, and all the variations of the
human species, was not entered by the
reflecting Charles without those tumul∣tuous
emotions produced by the gush of
novelty, which inebriates the senses. A
mixed conception of grandeur hitherto
unobserved, and misery hitherto unknown,
taught him to feel for humanity, a pride
and an humiliation; here he first per∣ceived
that man was an enigma yet un∣solved;
every thing that imagination con∣ceives
of great and benevolent, neigh∣bouring
closely on every thing it con∣ceives
<PB N="13" REF="36"/>
of mean and cruel. Every glance
brought some new object, every sound
combined with some new reflection; and
in surrounding objects he seemed to lose
his own existence. He issued from the
inn, the next morning, to wait on Lord
Belfield, but had scarcely passed a few
streets, when the sweet pliability of his
spirits diffused itself around him, and
flying from meditation to meditation, he
found that no object in London was more
interesting than London itself.</P>
<P>He walked through the western parts
of the town more pleased than dissa∣tisfied;
he viewed faces which seemed to
have more mirth than malice, yet won∣dered
to encounter some who dragged
their steps with a listless and melancholy
air; because he yet knew not the pressure
of inaction. He knew not that this un∣fortunate
race were eager, but volatile in
pleasure; that when they shook the
<PB N="14" REF="37"/>
blossoms they sighed for the fruit; that
never penetrating the superficies of the
soul, their imbecile passions were without
aliment; plural loves appertain to no one,
and the friendship commenced in a mi∣nute
terminates with the hour.</P>
<P>His eye was detained by the numerous
labours which indolence occasions; the
magnificent trisles of our Sybarites. As
he looked through the windows of some
fashionable shops, he thought, “some in∣genuity
appears in these inventions, but
more one would think is required in their
use; to a stranger like me it becomes a
metaphysical exercise to comprehend their
purposes; and I doubt that to reason on
them for an hour would frequently be
but an unsuccessful operation.”</P>
<P>The narrowest streets in this metropolis
he found the most populous, and thought
that the spacious and solitary elegance
of the western seemed to be more requi∣site
<PB N="15" REF="38"/>
in the eastern parts of our town. The
latter have the evidences of a rude and par∣simonious
age, but the former the exhibi∣tions
of corrupt and polished times; that
portion of London appeared the ungrateful
and elegant heir of a contemned and sordid
parent. Here a confusion of all noises, of all
smells, and of all ranks, appeared to spread
an incessant distraction, and resembled a tu∣multuous
flight. Borne along a tide of ra∣tional
beings, Charles found no leisure to
meditate, and among his fellow citizens was
attracted by no sympathy; for man suc∣ceeded
man, like pieces of mechanism, that
proceeding from one mould, may be
counted, but cannot be distinguished.</P>
<P>As Charles was engaged in one of his
deepest reveries, a gentleman apologized
for having trod on his foot, and this with
so winning an urbanity, and such elegance
of manner, that our hero was enchanted
with this inhabitant of London, the first
<PB N="16" REF="39"/>
with whom he had yet interchanged civi∣lities.
He parted from him with regret.
We have none of these accomplished men
in our village (said Charles to himself)
and the hobnails of a peasant are not so
painful as his inhumanity. As he was
proceeding in his soliloquy, “a filthy dun∣geon
villain,” as Otway describes such,
came up, and in tones more repulsive
than attractive, informed him that he had
certainly been robbed. Charles found it
was true. I am an officer of justice, con∣tinued
the stern stranger. I know where
to find George, and make me a proper
gratuity, and you may hang him. Charles,
examining the countenance of the runner,
suspected him, and not the polite gentle∣man.
He therefore called for assistance,
and, to the astonishment of the crowd, had
him brought before our modern Lycurgus,
Mr. Justice—.</P>
<P>To write with the veracity and the dis∣cernment
<PB N="17" REF="40"/>
of an historian (and which we
here inform the reader are by no means
correlative qualities, as men of genius have
found it easier to exhibit an admirable
discernment without any veracity at all)
I must confess, that Mr. Justice—(who
I do not name, as the simple name
of certain persons may not unjustly be
deemed a libel) was not quite so much as∣tonished
as the rest, at seeing his chief
myrmidon in his present situation; for
it is a wise custom with the Areopagus of
Bow-street, to follow the vulgar precept in
the catching of thieves. Mr. Justice
—felt more indignation than surprise;
indignation arising from the ingratitude
of his <HI>protegé;</HI> for he said in his passion,
(and passion is a loquacious revealer of se∣crets)
that after having been a pad, and a
highwayman on a stolen horse, and through
his friendly interposition suffered to be∣come
an honest man at last, by his pro∣motion
<PB N="18" REF="41"/>
to the place of head runner, it was
the vilest ingratitude, and the drop should
now have its rights; adding, in the que∣rulous
language of offended patronage,
that there was no trusting one's own bro∣ther.</P>
<P>The runner, who, whatever robberies
he might have committed, was no mon∣ster
of ingratitude, having a most natural
and feeling antipathy of the aforesaid drop,
since in his present office he had been in
the full receipt of all it's privileges, re∣wards,
prosecutions and non-prosecutions,
quashings and hush-money, sent from his
heart a steaming oath, hot with geneva
and gratitude. Every being expresses
his affections and his asseverations accord∣ing
to his habits, by which, because we
are not always acquainted with them, we
are sometimes more shocked than con∣vinced.
The fair reader, on such an oc∣casion,
would raise her humid eyes to
<PB N="19" REF="42"/>
heaven, clasp two beautiful white hands,
and shed, in expressive silence, the softest
tear; a person of a sterner mould would
fix a steadfast eye on the unjust accuser,
and shew his gratitude by an insulting
contempt of the charge of ingratitude;
now these, and similar manners of con∣firming
our veracity, or gratitude, had
been perfectly unintelligible to the iron
nerves of Mr. Justice—. And must
we be condemned for vulgarism when we
relate the characters of the vulgar? We
pretend not to narrate one continued se∣ries
of romantic grandeur; we look for
nature as she walks about this great town.
We shall therefore proceed to inform our
reader in what manner our runner <HI>con∣vinced</HI>
Mr. Justice of his veracity and
gratitude.</P>
<P>It was done <HI>anatomically;</HI> that is, with
as much knowledge of the human body
as a runner may be supposed to possess.
<PB N="20" REF="43"/>
He felt the zeal that most certainly warm∣ed
the good catholic bishop Ernulphus,
when he dictated that excommunication
which ought to be read and admired in
Shandean history; and he commenced by
most devoutly damning his eyes, his liver,
his heart, &amp;c. till having reached a climax
of this self-anathema, he easily persuaded
his patron of his honesty. He succeeded
on the principle that makes a carman in∣telligible
to his horses; that is, by certain
oaths whose long use and intonation they
perfectly understand; and the most dread∣ful
to modest or pious ears are, in these
cases, always the best. When our run∣ner
had related the fact, Mr. Justice—,
turning to Charles, with much juridi∣cal
importance said, “Sir, I must commit
you for a false charge, and for defamation.
That man, I tell you, is one of my ho∣nestest
fellows, and has not committed a
robbery these ten years.”</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="44"/>
In the secrecy of an interior apartment
our hero became more enlightened. There
George attended a civil message, and un∣der
a promise of non-prosecution, and as
a man of honour (as the runner observed)
confessed the robbery. Charles heard
and saw with astonishment. His accom∣plished
gentleman acknowledged himself
a pickpocket, and a guardian of justice,
a footpad. Our hero, confessing him∣self
to be a country gentleman, was in
consideration of that, &amp;c. discharged with
a reprimand.</P>
<P>Returning in the evening, he was ac∣costed
by some unfortunate females, who
gave a thousand sweet caresses from their
impure lips, like roses distilled in an alem∣bic
tinged with gall. But ingenuous youth
is timid in the first moments of it's novel
perils, and imagines all it's trembling
doubts to be a virtuous indignation. To
their obliging invitations Charles replied
<PB N="22" REF="45"/>
by some quotations on immodesty from
one of his father's sermons, and would
have entered into further discourse, had
not each fair auditor expressed the impa∣tience
of contempt. On Holborn Hill, a
female of a certain age and decent dress,
formed not to provoke love, but to im∣press
respect, accosted him, and laid her
hand on his shoulder. A departing
modesty seemed still to linger in her
silence. Charles, interested in her in∣tentions,
at variance with her appear∣ance,
forgot his father's sermon, and felt an
emotion of humanity. This child of mis∣fortune
burst into tears, and pressing his
hand with a gentle sympathy, a warm
blush flew across her cheek, which told
she came not to excite the voluptuous∣ness
of the senses. She described her si∣tuation.
She was a widow with four
children, who stood isolated in this assem∣blage
of millions of her fellow-beings; whose
<PB N="23" REF="46"/>
labours were insufficient to afford a mor∣sel
to her helpless offspring; and who, in
opposition to a blameless life, and to
a cultivated sensibility, when she heard
the voice of her children, naked, desolate,
and hungry, rushed, in the darkness of the
night, to a pollution that never reached
her heart.</P>
<P>“And you, young man, (she said) who∣ever
you are, singular is your character!
We are interdicted from the rights of so∣ciety;
wherever we go we bear it's male∣dictions;
we are renounced by all; not
one of your crowd of sentimentalists
deigns to look on beings whose misery is
obscure; and the falsely delicate avoid a
reflection on our fate, as if fearful of con∣tamination.
You yet cannot compre∣hend
how the vagrant, soliciting the hand
of every passenger, may be a virtuous wo∣man.
Yes, many virtues are practised by
those feeble beings, who, in the warmth of
<PB N="24" REF="47"/>
youth, are precipitated to the grave.
Many are patient under affliction, meek
amid barbarity, and resigned in disease
and death. O! could you but observe
our harassed existence! the language of
mirth, from a voice of melancholy; the
blandishments of love, from the terrors of
fear; and the dead solitude and the bitter
tears that make us execrate the light of
heaven! Poor patient woman suffers mi∣series
the haughty spirit of man would not
half endure. The insolence of youth,
the depravity of age—these, Sir, are not
our greatest evils; yet, of humanity we
see nothing but the worst side. But alas!
we start at the terrific mirror of memory!
I look around, and every look humiliates;
denied a sister's voice, a brother's arm!—With
the one sex I can form no friend∣ships,
for they are my rivals; nor with
the other, for they are my masters. When
I sit and think, how do I wish that nature
<PB N="25" REF="48"/>
would wrap in eternal oblivion the brain
that, without it's self-destruction, still
feeds on itself. Why do I live? I ex∣claim.
Yet am I not the most unfortu∣nate
of my sex; my portion is shame,
but not remorse. I have broken no pa∣rent's
heart; have disturbed no connubial
quiet.—Ah, young man! I <HI>must</HI> live!
She who now addresses you, is the mother
of children.—And I forget my own hu∣miliation,
when my hand conveys bread
into their's.”</P>
<P>She conducted Charles to her apart∣ment.
He saw the affectionate scene of
her children clinging around their mother,
chiding her for hours of protracted hun∣ger,
while this mother, whom his preju∣dices
had injured, allotted among them
the casual loaf she had purchased with his
money. He was touched with the artless
prattle of the elder boy.—“Here, mother
(said he) I have been unravelling all these
<PB N="26" REF="49"/>
threads, and sorting all these needles, as
you told me. Come, you'll give me a kiss
as well as a supper, won't you? Poor
Mary has been crying with the cold, so
I put her to bed myself. One is always
warmest a-bed. Come, mother is good
to-night, now let us all go and sleep.”
Charles took his leave of this unfortunate
mother, with a confused sensation of ap∣proving
humanity, and condemning mo∣rality.</P>
<P>As Charles slept into bed, which was
generally an important moment of reflec∣tion
with him, he said, I have much to
learn in this metropolis, where the most
finished gentleman is the most noted
pickpocket; the oldest thief an officer of
justice; and a prostitute a virtuous and
affectionate parent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Patron of Modern Philosophers.</HEAD>
<P>THE next day our hero hastened to
Lord Belfield, and as he passed
through the streets, closed his ear and his
eye as well as he could, to the suggestions
of fancy, dreading the perplexities of the
preceding day. As he proceeded, all the
ideas of nobility, which his father had so
frequently inculcated, rose with a glow∣ing
sensation. Lord Belfield was one of
the ancient peers who sat in the house by
descent, and not by creation. His blood
was enriched with some sprinklings from
the royal veins of France and of Eng∣land,
and the imagination of Charles was
awed by the departed predecessors of
<PB N="28" REF="51"/>
Belfield, who rose, in a marshalled order,
before his timid and modest nature. Had
my Lord Belfield (he thought) been a
commoner! “I have <HI>seen</HI> commoners. An
obscure being like myself, admitted to
the society of a man of such a noble de∣scent,
if received haughtily must feel a self-degradation,
and if received with kindness
must still recollect that the equality he
enjoys is a conferred favour, and not a
mutual obligation. How I should hate
to be one, who is only <HI>suffered</HI> to be what
he is! Yet is nobility a golden chain of
ornament and utility in our government;
a softening shade of monarchy that re∣lieves
the bright picture of our constitu∣tion:
a nobleman carries with him a
weight of glory, or a weight of shame; if
he rivals his virtuous ancestors, who more
deserves our veneration? And if he wi∣thers
all his leaves of honour, the noble
stem from which he sprung will exist as
<PB N="29" REF="52"/>
the peculiar memorial of his degeneracy.
The nobleman is entitled to a respect not
due to a private citizen, whose obscurity
conceals his defects; for this respect is
either paid to him for himself, which will
be his glory, or it is paid to the memory
of his ancestors, which will be his infamy.
It is only by this order of men, that a
nation can secure to itself a race of illus∣trious
characters. Uninfluenced by the
confined interests of other individuals,
what does a noble claim for the remunera∣tion
of actions, for which others are re∣compensed
by new honours, or meaner
gratifications? Of these he wants neither;
the remembrance of his ancestors, and the
proud rivalry of his own conduct, are the
priceless remunerations his great soul can
alone receive. Lord Belfield, the descen∣dant
of so many illustrious progenitors;
what a stimulating source of noble ac∣tions!”—So,
repeating the first lines of the
<PB N="30" REF="53"/>
first Ode of Horace, and philosophizing
in this manner, Charles at length arrived
at the house of his noble patron.</P>
<P>Announced, he entered tremblingly and
confused into a library, where he saw a jolly
groom, booted and spurred, with a dusty
coat and cropt hair.</P>
<P>Lord Belfield received him with the
utmost familiarity; a familiarity which, as
it was bestowed on every one alike, could be
considered by no one as a favour. His cha∣racter
is too unimportant to be recorded
even in this page of minor biography; and,
but for his connection with our hero, would
never have been considered by us, as
sufficiently important, to say in print, that
it was unimportant. His revenue was
one of the most considerable in England;
but his devotion to a faction of dema∣gogues,
who assumed the title of repub∣licans;
to sophists, who called themselves
philosophers; and his imbecility of mind
<PB N="31" REF="54"/>
in all the versatile dissipations of the times,
in which he had been so successful as to
have corrupted his own lady; all these
levities and crimes rendered his fortune
insufficient for his purposes. Feeble in
himself, he became a powerful engine in
the artful hands of others. He was re∣markable
for exulting that his coronet
was placed on his carts; the philosophers
said he had done this to degrade every
ensign of nobility; while others considered
that on the contrary these ensigns were
still pleasing to his eye, and were placed
to shew that there existed some distinction
between the cart of a commoner, and the
cart of a lord. Such was this lord; who
by his nobility was disgraced, by his
opulence impoverished, and by his philo∣sophy
made the dupe of his passions.
How many circumstances favourable to
man, were perverted in the character of
Lord Belfield!</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="55"/>
Charles, in the presence of this noble∣man,
soon lost that high reverence he
paid to his ancestors. “You are come,
my boy (said Belfield) with a whole forest
of prejudices, rooted to the centre of the
earth; you will want the axe to let in a
little light. We have here wood-cutters
of this kind, and we shall begin to clear
away. You will find here assembled, men
whom Athens has not surpassed. We
discuss, in familiar conversations, the sub∣lime
systems of modern philosophy, in
morals as in politics. What we dare to
think, we dare to express, and what we
express we are ready to act. Our present
favourite enquiry is a new system of mo∣rality;
from a vain and uncertain science,
wer are busied in forming an useful and ma∣thematical
science. After so many thou∣sand
years, we do not know what is virtue.
The world, it has been lately discovered,
is in it's first stage of imbecil infancy.”</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="56"/>
“A <HI>new</HI> system of morality! interrupted
Charles; the divine revelation of our
Lord Jesus, has given us assuredly all that
is necessary.”</P>
<P>“As for that <HI>book</HI> you allude to, Charles,
(said his Lordship with a grin) we do not
know who wrote it, or whether it was
written at all; or whether”—But his
Lordship, in the precipitation of his zeal,
could never finish <HI>this whether;</HI> for, as the
reader may happen to have observed, men
much too warm, generally by carrying up
their climax in a <HI>second whether,</HI> are quite
at a loss when they come to their third.</P>
<P>His lordship continued: “We do not
approve of all that we find in it,” and see
not much to admire in what we might
approve. “Give unto Cesar what is
Cesar's due.” A pretty system of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation! The little Jew carpenter was
no republican, and wanted perhaps to be
<PB N="34" REF="57"/>
collector of the taxes in Judea; but he
had never interest enough at court.
Young man, you seem surprised at this
language; I dare say you think it damn∣ably
indecorous. Learn the “Nil ad∣mirari”
if you would live in this age
of reason. I tell you that we are thinning
our prejudices, which are of two kinds,
universal and local. Your universal ones
are old oaks, and are looked on with as
much reverence as an old Druid did his
misletoe. Virtue, not yet being found
out, we suppose it is nothing more than
public interest; and consequently no
action can be accounted criminal, which
does not strike at the public interest.”</P>
<P>“I am not now so much surprised, my
Lord, in observing of late domestic quiet
so frequently violated by the foulness of
adultery, the gloomy desolation of gam∣ing,
and the cruel temerity of duelling.
<PB N="35" REF="58"/>
In this new system, the sensual and in∣flammatory
passions are solaced and gorg∣ed;
man is flattered to be deceived;
while his rational faculties are obscured
by verbal misconstructions, rest on dan∣gerous
paradoxes, and wander wild in
extravagant hypotheses.”</P>
<P>“I see, replied his Lordship, that Mr.
Subtile made an excellent observation,
when he said, that to enlighten a citizen
is the labour of time. Consult with that
great philosopher. Like another Socrates
he is surrounded by the spirited youth of
his age. When among them, he says, he
lives in the next age, and from youth
alone he expects a warm reception to his
philosophy; for age is untractable and
stubborn, now in youth all is new, and
that which they first hear, they longest
remember, and will not believe to be
error. We allow a thousand, or two thou∣sand
<PB N="36" REF="59"/>

a work of time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the usual computed time supposed suf∣ficient for the spread of universal philosophy, ac∣cording to the testimony of the first modern sages. But I observe that Mr. Holcroft, whose reveries are conducted on a far greater scale, than are such im∣poverished imaginations, does not conceive this pe∣riod of sufficient length. I shall do myself the ho∣nour of quoting the words of this gigantic philoso∣pher, who reminds me of the inhabitant of Sirius, in the romance of Micro-megas of Voltaire; “It surely is not <HI>absolutely impossible,</HI> but that <HI>men</HI> may con∣tinue thus to <HI>collect</HI> knowledge, and that TEN THOUSAND YEARS hence, if this good world should last as long, they may, &amp;c. &amp;c.” Preface to Hugh Trevor.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Our great philosopher reasons from
“first principles,” and matchless is he for
an argument of six hours! contradict;
he replies not. We must shorten the two
thousand years, by losing no time. He
has reduced every thing to a system. A
<PB N="37" REF="60"/>
system, is the cap of Fortunatus to phi∣losophy;
an engine of iron working on
the ductile wax of nature; an elastic
patent silk stocking, smooth and glossy,
and fitted for any leg.</P>
<P>Subtile gives a reason for the most un∣reasonable
thing; for he distinguishes be∣tween
probabilities, possibilities, what is
evidence, and what is equivalent to evi∣dence.
He has constructed tables, phy∣sical
and metaphysical, moral and poli∣tical,
where, with precision, are marked
the different degrees of probability, and
consequently, the quantity of belief, which
may be assigned to every opinion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This jargon is curiously indulged by Helve∣rius. “Since truth is an indivisible point, and that we cannot say of a truth, that it is more or less so, it is evident, that if we are more certain of our own existence, than that of bodies, the existence of bo∣dies, consequently, is only a probability; a probabi∣lity very great, and which, upon the whole, is equi∣valent to evidence. Now, if almost all our truths, are reduced to probabilities, how much should we owe to that man of genius who would undertake to direct physical, metaphysical, moral and political tables, where should be noted with precision, all the divers degrees of probability, and consequently of belief, which we ought to assign to every opinion.” He then has the timely kindness to assist us in these aforesaid tables. “The existence of bodies, for instance, would be placed in the physical tables as the first degree of certitude; then afterwards would be determined what are the odds that the sun will rise to-morrow, or in ten, or twenty years, &amp;c. In the moral and political tables, would be equally placed, in the first degree of certitude, the existence of Rome or London; then that of heroes, such as Caesar or William the Conqueror; then we should gradually descend through the scale of probabilities till we came to facts less certain; and at length to the pretended miracles of Mahomet, to the prodigies attested by so many Arabs. Thus men who now only use imperfect signs to express their degrees of belief, would more easily communicate their ideas, by <HI>referring directly to the table</HI> and <HI>number</HI> of these probabilities.” Esprit, vol. 1. p. 8.—So that when a metaphysical age shall be universally established, in one or ten thousand years, every person will carry a pocket-book, which necessarily must contain more truth than the Bible.</NOTE>.

ones, and so live on for a few more hun∣dred
years. Mr. Reverberator says he
has no doubt he shall live two or three
hundred years, though the doctors have
given him over.” Here his Lordship
stopped suddenly, and breathless.</P>
<P>Two thousand years to enlighten the
world—perfectibility of the mind—new
senses,—and not know who wrote the
New Testament—all these novel notions
confounded the understanding of our
rustic philosopher. When a man is con∣vinced,
he gives a silent inclination of the
head, and so he does when he is quite
the contrary. Astonishment is as silent as
<PB N="41" REF="64"/>
conviction; so that when my Lord stop∣ped,
Charles gave a mute bow.</P>
<P>As he was stopping into bed, he said
to himself, this new science of morality is
more perplexing than my adventures of
yesterday. I see my Lord is an Arian,
and I must give him my father's evi∣dences
of the Trinity. What a centre of
confusion is this London! polite pick∣pockets,
rogues for officers of justice, in∣sane
philosophers.—As yet I have found
no one to admire, but a miserable prosti∣tute!</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Second Conversation with his Patron.
A Fashionable Lady.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE observed, that among the greatest
disturbers of that sweet oblivion of
ourselves, sleep, is a lecture on metaphy∣sics.
The whole system of man is revers∣ed;
the most orderly notions are thrust
out of their places; and when, with infi∣nite
fatigue of the intellect, the new ones
are once fixed, like furniture made of
unseasoned wood, they suddenly crack,
burst and shiver into shining fragments.
Or pursuing the simile in another form,
the chapters of metaphysical writers are
read, while nothing is retained; like
entering a dark room in search of some
<PB N="43" REF="66"/>
object, and from which we issue, without
having found what we wanted, after a
great deal of racketting among the tables
and chairs.</P>
<P>After this preliminary observation, it is
hardly worth assuring the reader, that
Charles slept little, while in many a wak∣ing
dream, he wandered, now crawling,
now towering, now plunging among the
clouds, and quagmires of the new philo∣sophy.
In the morning, when he returned
to the use of his old senses, which he had
nearly lost while in search of the new, it
occurred that Lord Belfield had not yet
introduced him to his Lady. Imagining
that her Ladyship was confined to her
apartment, he ventured to enquire after
her health, which produced the following
dialogue.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord B.</SPEAKER>
<P>“I hope her Ladyship is very
well. Charming woman! I have not seen
her this week.”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="67"/>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Ladyship then is distain
from the metropolis?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not. I understand she
is in the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the house, my Lord, and
you have not seen her this week?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord B.</SPEAKER>
<P>My boy, I forgot your rus∣ticity.
Her Ladyship is one of the most
amiable of women, and I, the happiest of
husbands; yet curse the name 'tis so me∣chanical!
We study our mutual happi∣ness,
and we do not <HI>obsedé</HI> one another.
We married for this very purpose, of not
living quite so much together; for when
I paid my <HI>devoirs</HI> to her Ladyship for a
whole season, I received her fair hand,
that we might not be obliged to appear
together in public. She has her card
parties, and receives her masks; and I
my stud, and my philosophers. A finer
stud is not in England; sold all my
done-up rips; they had been so gingered
<PB N="45" REF="68"/>
and so nitred by my head scoundrel, that
they cocked their tails, and their coats
looked sleek and shining when they could
not stir a leg. 'Tis a maxim, Charles, with
me, that a bad horse you cannot sell,
and a good one you cannot buy too
quickly. Trust me on the turf. All the
world say I have a hawk's eye on horse
flesh; all my grooms and all the jockies
say so. Good judges these, better than
philosophers! I had the great professor
Camper to examine a horse the other
morning. He may know about a horse,
as it is in the Linnean system, but the
philosopher in my stables was a block∣head
among the grooms. I felt for the
fellow's ignorance. He had the audacity
to prefer a black horse for it's colour to a
grey, when all the world knows, there's
not a man who would drive a pair of
blacks in a curricle who has the least
knowledge of what is tonish.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="46" REF="69"/>
As for her Ladyship, the last time I
met her was at the Dutchess of Rubble's
rout. So spirited, so gay, so unconcern∣ed
for every thing! All the women seem
to me Stoics; they beat Subtile in philo∣sophy.
She never shrinks at the turning
of a card for a thousand; and drives four
in hand with such velocity, that if her
Ladyship saves her neck she will be the
first driver in Europe. She has ride a
horse without a saddle. She has a great
soul in every thing. I will give you a singu∣lar
instance of her powers. The Marchio∣ness
of Morliere, that blue-eyed nymph
of the Seine, has betted with her, five
thousand pounds, that in the course of
this year, the Marchioness obliges me to
commit a small infidelity, while my Lady
gains the Marquis. We have been mu∣tually
apprised of our danger. The Mar∣quis
has lost; <HI>elle a conté des fleurettes,</HI>
and the sensitive Frenchman cannot resist,
<PB N="47" REF="70"/>
and what is certain cannot pay. The
poor Marquis is in despair to settle his
lost wager, for he is a man of the most
delicate honour. The year is clos∣ing;
the bewitching emigrant takes all
forms, seises all hours, but plays off her
artillery in the air. English flesh and
fat, blockade the avenues of the heart,
and in such a case a Briton is a better
accountant than a Gaul. Heh man,
what excites your surprise? Her Lady∣ship
has not yet equalled the Countess of
Lauragin, who when I was at Paris was the
heroine of the day. The Count's pas∣sionate
attachment to Mademoiselle Ar∣noux,
the first actress at the opera, had
become, through it's excessive jealousy,
most tormenting to that enchanting wo∣man.
She had returned to the Countess
the presents she received from the Count;
these consisted of diamonds, a chariot,
and two children. She placed herself
<PB N="48" REF="71"/>
under the protection of a minister of
state. The poor Count was in a delirium
of despair and poetry; he inundated the
town with elegies. In this affecting
moment of distress, the Countess perso∣nally
interceded with the actress; she
intreated her acceptance of the diamonds,
the chariot, and her husband; as for the
children she reserved them for her own
care. The actress, as generous as the
Countess, suffered the Count to recon∣quer
an old fortress, from which he had
been dislodged. This is indeed, the last
refinement of sentiment, and the Countese
is a model for all fashionable women.”</P>
<P>Preserve me Heaven, (said Charles to
himself) what a perversion of ideas! An
amiable woman who only sees her hus∣band
at an accidental visit!—A husband
lamenting the hard case of a man who
violates his honour—and this man has
the nicest honour! A wise interceding
<PB N="49" REF="72"/>
with a prostitute, to pollute her bed—When
will my perplexities terminate? I
will relieve a wearied and distracted judg∣ment,
by an action that is simply prompt∣ed
by the heart. Soothing sympathy!
thy pleasures are independent of the local
variations of human opinions. I will has∣ten
to give a meal to the mother and her
children. How little can save a forsaken
woman, from the prostitution of a night!</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Philosophical Party. The Character of a
great Philosopher.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES, having promised a silent
acquiescence to the select friends of
Lord Belfield, was now admitted to the
philosophical party. His Lordship ob∣served,
“These great men must suffer no
contradiction; because I am an advo∣cate
for the utmost freedom of opinion.”
This principle was considered by Charles,
as quite illogical; but it was the logic of
the party.</P>
<P>Here were assembled that great philo∣sopher
Mr. Subtile, the coldest-blooded
metaphysician of the age. Mr. Rever∣berator,
who in the intense furnace of his
<PB N="51" REF="74"/>
imagination, with the combustible mat∣ter
he collected from Mr. Subtile, re∣verberated
the flames with a triple force.
Dr. Bounce, a square, squat, sullen and
volcanic presbyter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Dandiprat has all the irascibility of genius in his conversation, but the most undisturbed phlegm in his writings.

Mr. Rant, the suc∣cessful
rival of orator Henley, whose
benches were covered with the loose rem∣nants
of shopboards, wild apprentices;
those threads of humanity tiny taylors,
and with the bloody offals of butchers
stalls. Mr. Libel, that silver-voiced as∣sassin,
editor of a news-paper; Janus∣faced,
one to smile and the other to
<PB N="52" REF="75"/>
sneer; and who, to calumniate the more
effectually, was solicitous of an universal
acquaintance. Mr. Dragon, a political
Sangrado, who was for giving the nation a
copious bleeding to invigorate and purify
it's constitution; and Mr. Sympathy, who
had invented a new religion.</P>
<P>Insulated among this conclave of mo∣dern
philosophers (for so each called him∣self,
although such are of a very ancient
standing, whether we examine their inten∣tions
or their productions) sat a Mr.
Johnson, who spoke more by gesture
than by voice; he was expert in dove∣tailing
the chasms of conversation, by a
significant nod, or an accommodating
hem. Satire, panegyric, and epigram
were in his slightest gesture. Every one
considered him as a person of considera∣ble
ability, because to their knowledge
he had given no public demonstration of
his powers; and which is indeed by no
<PB N="53" REF="76"/>
means the happiest method of acquiring
great reputation among our friends.</P>
<P>As we consider the character of the
philosophic and atrabilarious Subtile, as
neither too common to be pourtrayed,
nor too singular to want interest, we shall
attempt to give the features of a chass of
men, who, in this age of political inquiry
and philosophical scepticism, are of greater
importance in society, than in any pre∣ceding
period, when the speculations of
philosophy were only told in whispers, or
published with a solicitous ambiguity, a
castrated vigour, and an involuntary de∣corum;
in a word, when the human mind
was only shown in an imperfect profile,
ill expressive of the sensations that ani∣mate
every particular muscle of it's full
face.</P>
<P>Subtile, like another Marius, exulted
that he sprang from the dregs of the peo∣ple.
A minute accident gave the world
this philosopher, as well as the greater
<PB N="54" REF="77"/>
number of its revolutions, its temporary
fermentations, and its perennial benefits.
By the stall of the father of Subtile (who
was an honest retailer of meat) daily pas∣sed
the coach of the Bishop of that dio∣cese,
who it could not be forgotten, was
the son of a baker. As certain as the
Bishop passed, the sensorium of this ho∣nest
man, combined two ideas, hot rolls,
and Cardinal Wolsey; the first by retro∣gression,
relating to the Bishop; the se∣cond
by progression, to his son. To
Oxford was Subtile sent, at the volun∣tary
sacrifice of those secret comforts of
life, which may be found more uninter∣ruptedly
in the shed of industry, than in
the paace of episcopacy. His father
lived to see his son a curate, with an in∣come
which his stall would have trebled.
Farmers and other provincialists, who
conceive no person in the world more
considerable than their Bishop, their
<PB N="55" REF="78"/>
Lama of Tartary, and who originally
arose from a stock as humble as their
own, too frequently give the church a
rebellious son, while their town loses an
useful citizen. No class of men are
rendered more dissatisfied in these good
realms, than country curates, who are
almost famished into atheism, and who,
in the disorganization of a people, would
seek their first triumph in the flames of
episcopal roofs.</P>
<P>Subtile was no idler; he had exalted
his imagination with certain romances,
vulgarly termed the Roman histories;
and with an intense delight for specula∣tive
notions, plunged far and wide into
the interminable discussions of metaphy∣sics.
Talents, like his, merit an encou∣ragement
they do not easily find. He
wrote sermons for Bishops, who, with a
revenue which it seems an impiety for a
Christian pastor to accept, would only pay
<PB N="56" REF="79"/>
for them as if they had been merely trans∣criptions.
He therefore, by no difficult
transition of sentiment, became indispos∣ed
against eclesiastical establishments;
told the public so in an unorthodox
pamphlet, by which he lost his cure, pri∣vately.
Something similar is the secret
history of many of those fugitive per∣formances
which few have any cause to
remember but their author; not but
that sometimes a pamphlet has written a
curate into a bishoprick. The pittance
of a daily meal was now denied the phi∣losophical
parson. As his father's cleaver
dismally sounded on the block, it seemed
to insult his indignant feelings; there was
an agony in the abstraction of his rumi∣nations;
he thought that like a poisoned
rat he had withdrawn into his hole to die.
What remained? Could a metaphysician
descend to put on a blue apron, and
split calves-heads?</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="80"/>
He quitted the paternal roof without
the affection of a son. The hopeless fa∣ther
sunk into despondence; the poor man
forsook the block he had struck for forty
years, and died in the workhouse of that
parish, of which he once almost imagined
his son the diocesan. And all this, and what
evil is to follow, arose from the pecuniary
illiberality of Bishops, who would only
pay for original sermons, as more trans∣criptions.
Man is so frequently the agent
of impelling circumstances, that had the
Bishops proved more generous, and Sub∣tile
more fortunate, we doubt not that
the philosopher had devoted his talents
in favour of the very cause of which he
was afterwards so redoubtable an adver∣sary.
It is thus man is influenced by
the coincidences of human events, and
thus varies from year to year, according
to new interests and new hopes.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="81"/>
London is the resource of the country.
Subtile arrived in the metropolis, reso∣lutely
pursuing a system, which, directed
by a mind of fortitude, and a heart with∣out
passions, confers on it's follower some
proud delights, of too fine a spirit to be
tasted by grosser organs. He now ad∣dicted
himself to literary pursuits; the
enjoyment of opulence, the wealth of
poverty, and the glory of genius.</P>
<P>Subtile was superior to the profession
he assumed; for soon he discovered that
literature was one of the numerous trades
of London, and that those who were
bankrupts in all others, attempted to
enrich themselves in this. He found that
Newgate was the Parnassus of the age;
and saw with astonishment and contempt,
that men incapable of every thing, con∣ceived
themselves able to instruct others
in all things; that many composed histo∣ries
<PB N="59" REF="82"/>
without the <HI>materia historica,</HI> the
echo of an echo, the shade of a shadow;
and that the most illiterate were at least
editors of Cyclopedias. Even those light
and charming compositions, the recreations
of men of taste, and the solace of the stu∣dious,
he saw were the aliment of the
worst passions; a brutal licentiousness
that lifted the veil of domestic quietude,
and in the pleasure grounds of literature,
by their brilliancy and their venom, re∣sembled
the deadly nightshade. Far more
innocent, did Subtile exclaim, is the low
rabble of literature, those poor devils,
who make use of the pockets of their
neighbours, as their own; your abridgers,
and compilers. From me (he cried, in
a virtuous enthusiasm) the dignity of
literature shall receive no degradation.</P>
<P>The course of his studies had formed
an intellectual physiognomy. Whether
genius, in polished ages like the present,
<PB N="60" REF="83"/>
be the impulse of nature, or the imper∣ceptible
gradation of art, is a literary en∣quiry
of greater curiosity than utility;
since to him who with incessant and intense
pleasure persists in any study, with pa∣tience
to examine, and with habit to
combine; sentiments and images will arise,
and he will at length attain that facility
and charm of performance which is deno∣minated
genius. Subtile devoted his
days and his nights to the study of me∣taphysics;
and his literary industry was
at length rewarded with that perfection
of talent which is designated by the term,
of metaphysical genius; subtilty, acute∣ness,
and profundity, without imagination,
sensibility, and amenity.</P>
<P>From the unmetaphysical conversa∣tions
and irregular arguments of ordi∣nary
society, he sought a voluntary se∣clusion.
He practised, in great perfec∣tion,
the virtues of a simplicity of man∣ners,
<PB N="61" REF="84"/>
an habitual veracity, and an ex∣treme
frugality; the stern virtues of a
haughty poverty. His pen, chaste in its
labours, was polluted by no infamous
traffic of his ideas; he meditated on the
sublime philosophy of Antoninus, the
condensed and sententious moralities of
Seneca, and the unimpassioned and pa∣tient
sortitude of Epictetus; but he
thought too favourably of a frivolous
age, when he imagined that we desired
only to be instructed. The petty re∣source
derived from one of our literary
journals, was more productive than the
united wisdom of Seneca and Epic∣tetus.</P>
<P>Ten years he consumed in a solitary
garret, in a state partaking more of intel∣lect
than of sense. He learnt to reason,
but he forgot to feel. An habitual me∣lancholy
pervaded his gloomy habits.
His acrid blood, and rigid nerves, were
<PB N="62" REF="85"/>
agitated by no sweet emotions; he knew
not the softening confidence of love, nor
the cheerful consolations of friendship;
but he calculated the passions, and judged
them when they hardened into immobi∣bity;
that is, he viewed them when they
ceased.</P>
<P>To arrange the vast diversities of na∣ture
into the contraction of a system, to
methodize what is spontaneous, and to
attempt to enumerate all its endless va∣rieties,
formed his sublime occupation,
and his solitary amusement. Man was
adapted to his system, which is much
easier than to adapt a system to man.
He peopled the world with Subtiles, and
traced its government according to the
legislation observed in the Utopia of his
garret.</P>
<P>Is it possible that immoderate reason
can really become actual insanity? Can
the wholesome cup of reason overflow
<PB N="63" REF="86"/>
with its gelid beverage, inflame with its
frigidity, and, like ice-water, taken in
excessive quantities, will it heat? Sub∣tile
in his dismal retreat, was in a similar
situation with the religious visionary,
whose prolific and atrabilarious fancy,
procreates a monster brood, which feed
and gorge on the entrails of their mo∣ther;
that species of infanity which takes
possession of the melancholy being, who
severed from all human interests, yields
itself with phrenetic fervour to one soli∣tary
and bewitching contemplation. With
a fearless hand he drew a circle round
nature, and became that unreasonable be∣ing
who reduced every thing to the line
and compass of human reason; and with
whom to vary in opinion was to wander in
error. An emphatic monotony, gigantic
ideas, and hyperbolical truths formed his
genius, his rigid mind could not change its
<PB N="64" REF="87"/>
attitude; but, firm and massy, made every
thing yield to its superior pressure.</P>
<P>He considered all objects, material and
intellectual, as only modifications of the
same universal matter; as so many pieces
of mechanism to be arranged and put to∣gether
by the artist. He was a kind of
cabinet-maker of the works of nature,
and said, of this may be formed a table,
and of that a chair; this man shall be
a general, and that the historian who is
to record his battles. Thus a kingdom,
like a house, may be furnished with pro∣priety;
but at present our systems of go∣vernment
are such, that we are compelled
to sit on any thing because we have not
provided sufficient chairs.</P>
<P>Every object placed in a conspicuous
situation was his abhorrence. The pro∣sperity
of the great seemed to insult the
melancholy recluse. His genius, som∣brous
<PB N="65" REF="88"/>
and sublime, considered superiority
as oppression. His notion of order was
not gradation, but equality; and as he
fancied (according to the system of mo∣dern
physics) that every mountain in na∣ture
was a deformity, an accidental ex∣crescence,
an elevation arising from the
inundation that fell on other parts, he
carried this pernicious principle into po∣litical
and moral science; and could not
patiently suffer a Sovereign, or a God.</P>
<P>The domestic habits of Subtile had
all the sullen fortitude and the gloomy
ferocity of an ancient Stoic; for himself
he felt as little as for others; and there
are occasions when the absence of sensi∣bility
looks like the most refined feeling.
He, like the Roman parent, would have
condemned that son whom the grateful
voice of his country had absolved. Ab∣stracted
from all terrene concerns, he
paced along the streets in uninterrupted
<PB N="66" REF="89"/>
cogitation; with a firm step and an ele∣vated
countenance, he seemed gazing ei∣ther
at the heavens, or reading the pen∣dulous
shop-signs. No philosopher of
Laputa could stand in more need of the
attendance of a faithful flapper, to rattle
his bladder with dried pease against his
mouth when he was to speak, or against
his ear when he was to listen. Absent
amidst the petty accidents of life, he
would commence a philosophical discus∣sion
under a gutter that poured on him
its regular current, and afterwards remark
the heavy rain that had fallen. He en∣countered
a thousand mischances in the
streets; for London, the fittest spot on
earth to meditate <HI>on,</HI> is the most unfit
to meditate <HI>in:</HI> an enraged bull is the
most intrepid controversialist a logician
can meet; and the most perplexing di∣lemma
is a horse which near you is
made, by the ingenuity of his rider, to
<PB N="67" REF="90"/>
go at once backwards and forwards, and
sideways: a porter crushes a philosopher
like an elephant that carries a castle:
the flying whips of carmen cut like the
biting scourge of the satirist: the chim∣ney-sweeper,
sable as Pluto; the hair-dresser,
rapid as Mercury; and the pav∣iour,
thundering as Jove, form a few of
the anti-philosophical embarrassments of
London. In such casualties Subtile's
mania of reasoning gave a semblance of
gentleness to his feelings, which was fo∣reign
to his heart; and when once run
over by a furious coachman, who broke
his leg, he only attempted to oppose his
dialectic to the brutality of the driver.
He was desirous only of punishing the
criminal by the perplexities of a regu∣lar
syllogism; and when carried home,
said, “That man will never again run
over a fellow-citizen. To reform, we
have only to reason; to punish is to
<PB N="68" REF="91"/>
aggravate. No man commits a crime
but through ignorance, it is only a mis∣calculation
of the mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Even this notion of late, turned on all sides, and compressed into all forms, only shews that our Lon∣don philosophers have read their Gulliver. Swift tells us, that his Houyhnhnms, for their state de∣crees, employed <HI>exhortations;</HI> “For they have no conception how a rational creature can be <HI>compelled,</HI> but only <HI>advised</HI> or <HI>exhorted;</HI> because no person can disobey reason without giving up his claim to be a rational creature.” Book IV. chap. X.</P>
<P>What is REASON? <HI>a system of thinking, varying with different interests.</HI> Reason here, ceases to be reason there. The philosopher who appeals to rea∣son, is frequently merely alluding to a peculiar sys∣tem of his own: and the humblest metaphysician is the proudest of men. Shaftesbury and Locke formed very distinct criterions of human actions. You would <HI>exhort</HI> a pickpocket against making use of his own hands; but will this <HI>exhortation</HI> be so effica∣cious as a <HI>transportation?</HI></P>
<P>The malicious wit of Swift has failed in this great and cynical performance. It degrades not his own species, and forms a tacit compliment to humanity. When he desired to describe a superior order of beings, he found himself constrained to give them all the noble qualities of man. Men are Yahoos only when they cease to be men; and Houyhnhnms are only humane philosophers. The supposed fact proves that the most admirable of known beings must be Man.</P>
<P>And if it be true, as Swift seems to conceive, and our London philosophers affirm, that the follies and vices of men proceed only from their ignorance, a sermon, and not a satire, was required to <HI>exhort,</HI> and not to <HI>chastise.</HI> The work of Swift is therefore un∣generous and inconsequential.</P>
<P>But assuredly it is not true, that <HI>ignorance</HI> is the only source of vice. Some of the most enlightened men have been the tyrants of the world. Man has a heart influenced by the passions more frequently, than a head that combines ideas; and sensation is more potent than reason.</P></NOTE>.” Humane pa∣radoxes!
too often employed for the
sinister purposes of some men of infi∣nite
artifice, and infinite depravity. Yet
Subtile was perhaps not of this class;
for as men of the world, who culti∣vate
their fancy more than their judg∣ment,
are apt to make the head the
dupe of the heart; men of philosophi∣cal
abstraction too frequently make their
heart the victim of their head.</P>

<PB N="70" REF="93"/>
of the conversations of some
great philosophers. The interruptions of
dissent to the discourse of a philoso∣pher,
is like loosening the wool of a
spinning-wheel, which can never perform
its useful labour, if the said wool be
not firmly affixed to the iron spindle.</P>
<P>Thus began Mr. Subtile: “The work I
<PB N="71" REF="94"/>
propose to publish is intituled,” “Preju∣dices
Destroyed, or Paradoxes Proved.”
My motto may be this French verse:
<Q>“Et nous ferons un bruit, à rendre les gens sourds.”</Q>
Which may mean, that such will be the
force of the conviction we leave on the
minds of our readers, that they shall
be deaf to the arguments of our op∣ponents.</P>
<P>“Citizen Lord Belfield (this was a title
<PB N="72" REF="95"/>
of compromise between the equally ob∣stinate
prejudices of the nobleman and
the philosopher) some will marvel, and
some will start at the singularity of its
doctrines. Twenty tedious years of au∣thorship
and criticship have taught me
the principles of human nature and li∣terary
composition; how to interest the
imagination, how to conduct the un∣derstanding,
and how to variegate with
the colouring gleams of a specious, a
novel, a confounding ratiocination.</P>
<P>I shall deposit in the bosom of friend∣ship,
the secrets of my art, because we
cannot now have too many artists. Every
opinion that can be promulgated has
an affirmative and a negative, both, to
an ingenious mind, sufficiently accom∣panied
by some probabilities; he who
would distinguish himself <HI>adopts generally
the negative,</HI> and accommodates the un∣known
and intangible nature of the in∣comprehensible,
<PB N="73" REF="96"/>
with the more familiar
and visible line of possibility. Hence
there are certain notions which few have
ventured to promulgate; because hi∣therto,
in their most temerarious efforts,
they have stopped at probabilities, while
only with the labour of one step more,
I enter the glittering scenes of possibi∣lities;
another leap transports me into
a fairy land, where, expatiating freely,
I trace those half-perceptible objects con∣cealed
by their own tenuity, or marvel∣lous
by their own immensity; now se∣ductively
bright, now awfully obscure;
in a word, I luxuriate in all the poe∣try
of philosophy.</P>
<P>And observe farther, we cannot be
too adventurous; <HI>no postulata are too bold
to advance.</HI> When a philosopher can∣not
accompany his new opinion with
any reasonable degree of probability, he
informs us, that he leaves it to time to
<PB N="74" REF="97"/>
ripen the germ his bold hand has thrown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is curious to observe, that in this instance the modern philosophers imitate the mode which Jesus adopted at the earliest propagation of Chris∣tianity. “He declared from the beginning it would not be generally received. He compared it to a treasure hid in a field; to a grain of mustard, which in time would grow up to a tree; and also to leaven hid in a large quantity of meal, by which the whole was in due time to be leavened and improved. But at what period the completion of his great purpose was to be effected, he has not disclosed.” These are the words of Mr. Bryant, in his treatise on the Christian religion, p. 211. He adds, “That the religion of Christ <HI>is going on.</HI>” Right glad am I to hear this cheerful familiarity from this good old man. It is the religion of an honest man; and I only lament, that I have not met with one Chris∣tian since I have known what Christianity really is.</NOTE>.
This can never fail. In the course of
some years, speculative men gather all
the probabilities they can, to accom∣pany
this solitary, and as yet unsup∣ported
opinion; for, as my preceding
<PB N="75" REF="98"/>
regulation has shewn, every opinion has,
though not immediately perhaps found
out, its possibilities. When once these
curious and subtile possibilities are drawn
together, then is it that we revive the
exploded extravagancies of the first in∣ventor.
Hence what appears the insa∣nity
of imagination in Helvetius or Mi∣rabeau,
becomes authorized in me and
my friend Reverberator. We in our
turn add our extravagant fancies, which
some of our posterity will alike support.
Thus from age to age extravagancies are
culled, renovated, and added; and all
this produces an age of reason!</P>
<P>Another and last secret, to which I
intreat your attention, is the variety of
deductions which we may form by an
application of the single word IF. I
have composed an elaborate dissertation
on IF. In metaphysics, it is a pick∣lock
which opens every door opposed to
<PB N="76" REF="99"/>
our system. I shall give you an instance
in point: Suppose I desire to prove that
man does not differ from a horse, I should
effect this by a single IF; mark me! IF
nature, in place of hands and flexible
fingers, had terminated our fists by the
hoof of a horse, who will doubt that men
without art, without habitations, with∣out
a protection against other animals,
occupied entirely in procuring food, and
shunning brutes of greater ferocity, would
not still have wandered in forests like
other fugitive herds?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Helvetius, L'Esprit, vol. I. p. 2.</NOTE> Never forget,
when you wish to dazzle by novelty, to
employ an IF. We now proceed to the
analysis of our great work.</P>
<P>My first postulatum is, public in∣terest
is the sole test of virtue. 'Tis
simple, as all “first principles” should be,
but the deductions are quite my own.
<PB N="77" REF="100"/>
Hence I prove, that gratitude is a vice.
Your friend has effected for you some es∣sential
service; you would return the same;
and this repayment of benefits may be
prejudicial to the public good; hence
you sacrifice to your benefactor the duty
you owe to virtue, or the public interest.
Why should we be grateful? Gratitude
is a solecism in the language of reason.
No man can confer on me <HI>a favour,</HI> but
only do me a <HI>right</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Godwin on Political Justice, vol. I. 137, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. You understand
me; by such principles I suppose, that
the famous age of reason has already taken
place; that universal illumination per∣vades
all classes; and that all the varieties
of human tempers and human interests
are resolved into one general apathy of
congealing Stoicism. I may have ante∣dated
my period by ten centuries; but
we must begin, or we shall never con∣clude.
<PB N="78" REF="101"/>
If a man therefore saves my life.
I feel no obligation; it is the public.
Nor need I return the benefit, for the
fellow may deserve to be hanged.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Johnson gave a loud hem▪</P>
<P>Besides, it may also be said (continued
Subtile) that gratitude is dependant on
the memory; some may forget to re∣member,
and some may remember to
forget. Who can split this hair? Mo∣tives
are inscrutable.</P>
<P>Next follows my chapter on promises.
All morality depends on justice. Simple
principle again; but the deduction is
mine. Promises are obligations to per∣form
what I ought to perform without
a promise, or it is not proper to perform.
It may be said, how can a person know
whether I will join with him in some fu∣ture
concern, if I do not give him my
immediate consent. Mark my exact
words. “Let beings rational and intelli∣gent,
<PB N="79" REF="102"/>
act as if they were rational and in∣telligent,
and the affairs of the world can
be carried on, without the intervention
of promises.”</P>
<P>Here Mr. Johnson gave another hem,
and a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od.</P>
<P>Subtile continued: You understand
me; still supposing the age of reason, and
that when a man is desired to act at the
moment, two things will certainly take
place; powerful arguments to induce him,
and discernment in him to comprehend
their propriety. All is secure in this
chapter; for I have made such numerous
and nice distinctions, between perfect and
imperfect promises, that few will under∣take
to controvert, what will not easily be
understood by any.</P>
<P>Then succeeds my chapter on property,
or the making use of the supersluities of
others. Property is sacred.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="103"/>
Lord Belfield wiped his face with his
handkerchief.</P>
<P>But if I want money, and you have a
supersluity, of which I am in that case a
better judge than you, I then possess a
just right, on the grand principle of
equality, to seize from your mass, what∣ever
my necessities may urge.</P>
<P>Here Lord Belfield, in an irresolute
tone of voice, requested to know in what
manner our legislator would seize on this
property? To which the great philoso∣pher
replied, first pressing his nose with
his fore finger, and raising half an eye on
his Lordship:</P>
<P>Distinguo! If I take more than is ne∣cessary,
I steal; but I am and must be the
sole judge of my own necessities. All super∣fluous
property is an open common.—'Tis
mine—'tis your's—'tis the public's.</P>
<P>Yes, burst forth Mr. Reverberator, the
only method will be to rescind the word
<PB N="81" REF="104"/>
property, from the dictionary of human
reason. It has been foisted in by stock∣holders,
contractors, and monopolists; an
honest poor man could never have con∣ceived
the ridiculous notion.</P>
<P>Subtile ordered attention. In the pre∣sent
defective state of society, the modes
of seizing on this supersluous property are
various. Some, who are compelled to
labour, take it in salaries; some, who are
good for nothing else, accept it in pen∣sions;
some, who are profuse of promises,
or dissert on gratitude, slip their hands in
your purse before your fascinated eyes,
without danger of prosecution. Some,
who know as yet but little of philosophy,
take it on foot, and some on horseback.
A virtuous republican would act like
Eudemidas, to one friend bequeath his
family, and to another the payment of his
debts. It is not easy to describe the advan∣tages
that must result from this proceeding.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="105"/>
But the discovery I have made on ano∣ther
subject, apparently the most trivial
of all human occurrences, makes me
shudder.</P>
<P>Lord Belfield, rather agitated by the
preceding one on property, enquired with
quickness what that was?</P>
<P>Subtile replied with his accustomed
solemnity of voice—denying yourself
when at home. I would not commit
such a crime if a bailiff demanded ad∣mittance.
It is a national system of lying
and impudence; vices which bring honest
citizens to the gallows; which word gal∣lows,
brings me to my chapter on Punish∣ments.
How, think you, I punish cri∣minals?</P>
<P>Lord Belfield observed that the guillo∣tine
was expeditious.</P>
<P>Mr. Dragon, his eyes reddening, his
face swelling, his fist clenched, exclaimed,
Keep that, Subtile, for the stinking stiff∣necked
<PB N="83" REF="106"/>
aristocracy; for those fugitives
who shall escape the general massacre.</P>
<P>Subtile replied: Mr. Dragon, I incul∣cate
no tumults, no massacres. Change
<HI>ideas,</HI> so that men may thus be compelled
to accede to our opinions. But suffer
not the rods of a Roman lictor to shed,
like dropping tears, the blood of one
citizen.</P>
<P>Dragon gave a hideous grin, striking
his knee with his clenched fist, and mut∣tering
that blood, blood was the cement
of true liberty; and that he knew some of
the greatest patriots of France, males and
females, who knocked down their two
dozen of aristocrats before dinner.</P>
<P>Subtile continued: I punish criminals,
by no punishments at all. Every vice is
only ignorance; merely an erroneous cal∣culation
of the mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Thus also Mr. Holcrost, “The tendency of man is to promote his own well-being, and the well-being of the creatures around him; these can only be promoted by virtue; consequently when he is <HI>vicious</HI> it is from <HI>mistake,</HI> and his original sin is ignorance.” Hugh Trevor, vol. i. 170.</P>
<P>To convince <HI>all</HI> that “virtue alone is hap∣piness below,” is, we most humbly presume, not to be expected, till the age of reason has a less suspi∣cious existence than at the present moment. But it is well to sweep away difficulties in all arguments.</P></NOTE>. Enlighten, you
<PB N="84" REF="107"/>
reform. Make travellers of thieves;
change their ideas by changing their cir∣cumstances.
Coercion is not conviction;
it ulcerates the body, but strikes not on
the mind. Thieves reason differently
from us; their “first principles” vary
from our's; but they certainly are a re∣spectable
body of citizens; and the first
settlement of Rome is a happy image of
thievery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Godwin, in his Political Justice, vol. ii. p. 385, 8vo. on colonization, in his scale of coer∣cion, says, “The first settlement of Rome, by Ro∣mulus and his vagabonds, is a happy image of this, whether we consider it as a real history, or as the ingenious fiction of a man well acquainted with the principles of mind!” I shall add here another quo∣tation from a work printed in 1753, with first a word on the author. De la Beaumelle was the writer of the Memoirs of Madame De Maintenon. His sensorium was a volcano of modern philosophy, and its explosions were heard in a little volume in∣titled “Mes Pensees.” Had he lived latterly, he would have been a worthy compeer of Robespierre. His book has been printed in a singularly castrated manner, having sometimes merely the first syllables of words. He seems to have delighted in the idea that France would soon have its Charles I. He has a thought on the same subject as Mr. Godwin, and it is this: “A republic founded by Cartouche, would have had wiser laws than the republic of Solon, and perhaps more rapid successes than those of the Ro∣mans.” p. 82, seventh edition. Long prosper thievery and philosophy, since robbers would become the wisest legislators, and the bravest heroes!</NOTE>. Murder itself is rarely a crime.
<PB N="85" REF="108"/>
Consider the multifarious distinctions, the
nice differences, impulses, motives, acci∣dents,
<PB N="86" REF="109"/>
uncertainty of evidence, and a
hundred other enumerations, for which
perpend my chapter of accidents. And
after all who decides on the crime? An
unmetaphysical jury, who know nothing
of first principles, final deductions, proba∣bilities
and possibilities, what is a predi∣cate,
and what a postulatum.</P>
<P>Having proved the infinite perfectibi∣lity
of mind, I come to that of the human
organs. Mind, as Franklin says (and
many ancients and many moderns) will at
length prevail over body. What is meant
is extremely simple, or extremely myste∣rious;
I prefer the latter. In some twen∣ty,
or forty, or sixty centuries, this earth,
if it lasts so long (of which I have my
doubts, since Mr. Herschel assures me,
that the sun diminishes every half cen∣tury,
the size of a crown-piece, and as
Buffon has discovered, that this globe is
only a vitrifaction from the sun, it must
<PB N="87" REF="110"/>
either suddenly crack, or gradually dis∣solve,
which I think is now the case, as
the poles, I am afraid, are getting flatter
and flatter). I say then, that this earth
will be peopled by another order of be∣ings;
pure intelligences that will pro∣create
by self-impregnations. Descartes
thought that we might prolong life for
two or three centuries, and when one of
his disciples heard of his death, it took
him two years before he could believe it.
Bishop Wilkins, who discovered the art
of aereal navigation, had no doubt that in
a few years men would as commonly call
for their wings, as they did for their
boots. I quote these instances to prove
that philosophers may happen to miscal∣culate.
This last, however, led me to my
dissertation on the winds; there I de∣monstrate
that “it <HI>only</HI> depends on <HI>some
very small causes</HI> to govern them, by
<HI>always</HI> keeping the under-currents of
<PB N="88" REF="111"/>
air from the S. W. and the upper cur∣rents
from the N. E<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The learned reader who has a fondness for the marvellous of scientific romances, may now in∣dulge his passion in its plenitude of fancy, by care∣fully reading over all that has been lately, and will be, written on the winds. The words above trans∣cribed, of the great philosopher Subtile, may be sound in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxxviii. p. 52. <HI>Also,</HI> let him read Dr. Darwin's airy note on the winds, in his fine poem; and <HI>likewise,</HI> Mon∣sieur Volney's most curious questions lately address∣ed to all wind catchers throughout Europe. I have long meditated on what <HI>we,</HI> the unlearned and grateful public, could do for these great men. The philosophers of Laputa are not their unworthy ri∣vals; and some establishment in the atmosphere, might prove of national and individual utility; we might thus get rid of these most ingenious incura∣bles, and they, with philosophy increasing in its pre∣sent ratio, would
<Q>“Ride in the whirlwind, and direct the storm.”</Q>
I therefore most humbly offer my subscription for an aereal hospital for incurables.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="112"/>
At present the renovation of life forms
my important research, and an experi∣ment
performed last week has confirmed
my hopes.</P>
<P>Dining with a friend, he produced
madeira bottled in his cellar, above twen∣ty
years. In one bottle we found three
slies. These were on the point of being
rejected from all useful purposes, when
the verse of Pope occurred to me;
<Q><L>“O would the sons of men, once think their eyes</L>
<L>And reason given them, but to study FLIES.”</L></Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Johnson immediately con∣tinued
the succeeding lines:
<Q><L>“See nature in some partial narrow shape,</L>
<L>And let the author of the whole escape.”</L></Q>
Our philosopher was offended by this con∣tinuation
of his quotation, justly observ∣ing,
that nothing is often more detri∣mental
to an author's purpose, than pur∣suing
his quotations. He proceeded:</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="113"/>
That morning I discovered an air, which
has yet no name; I perforated a tumbler
with a small orifice, placed my three flies
under; one hand held the microscope,
the other poured in the stream of this
nameless air. At first I saw, or seemed
to see a kind of motion. My eye pored,
the wings became transparent, shivered,
spread; the skin grew sleek, the eyes
stirred, shrunk, and started; the entire
head moved, the corselet was agitated;
the stomach and the intestines took their
proper place, and at length when the
tracheae, and the parts of generation of the
little flies, were sufficiently heated, nature
was restored to all her rights. They
moved, I moved; they climbed on the
side of the tumbler, I dropped the micro∣scope;
they lifted themselves in air, I lifted
the tumbler. They escaped, and I pursued.
I heard only their distant buz. Mean∣while,
their companion remained lifeless.
<PB N="91" REF="114"/>
A lucky circumstance, since it affords me
two theories, one, why flies may recover,
and the other why they may not. Now, if
you perpend my chapter “on the Analo∣gies
of Nature,” it will be evident, that IF
we discover the proper air, men, like flies,
may be revivified. What will an attorney∣general
say, when his accusing eye shall
startle at the spectral appearance of our
renovated compeers? In a few years, it is
possible, that our diurnal prints, besides
their articles of marriages and deaths,
will contain another on resurrections.</P>
<P>But the dome that is to cover the
splendid fabric of philosophy, the <HI>ne plus
ultra</HI> of metaphysics, is “A demonstra∣tion
of the non-existence of the being,
vulgarly denominated GOD.” And this
I prove by the order and concatenation
visible in the works of nature. Mirabea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
has done the same, but his “systeme”
will not be recognised in mine. I had
<PB N="92" REF="115"/>
my choice to prove it, by the disorder
and irregularity. But the other, by fall∣ing
in with the popular opinion, is the
more ingenious, and the more novel.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Johnson interrupted the phi∣losopher
by a loud uncivil hem; it was
what Johnson calls, a most sudden and
violent extirpation of the breath; while
Mr. Sympathy, (who we have observed
had invented a new religion) rising in
great agitation, addressed the metaphysi∣cian:</P>
<P>Mr. Subtile, you mean this non-ex∣istence
of God only as a <HI>personal at∣tack
on me.</HI> To come out at this mo∣ment
with such a demonstration! At
this moment, when the ground is pur∣chased
for my universal church; my
subscriptions rapidly filling, and my
quarto, proving the existence of a God,
on the eve of publication! Besides, gen∣tlemen,
Subtile violates the solemn com∣pact
<PB N="93" REF="116"/>
into which we entered. When I
proposed writing down all monarchy,
Subtile informed me that he was em∣ployed
on the same subject. Then said
I, to you I resign the affairs of the state,
provided, in return, I have all those of the
hierarchy. We shared like Abraham and
Lot. If thou goest to the right, I will
to the left. From that hour, I considered
all ecclesiastical matters as much my own,
as does the Archbishop of Canterbury.
And just at the moment my book
and my church are coming out, he pub∣lishes
this demonstration. Observe how
an envious philosopher can violate his
promises!</P>
<P>Socrates, in his basket, suspended in
the air for the benefit of undisturbed
meditation, sat not more unmoved than
Subtile in his chair. As if scarcely at∣tending
to the rage of Mr. Sympathy, he
replied with calm dignity; As for pro∣mises,
<PB N="94" REF="117"/>
they were made before I had writ∣ten
my chapter on them. I grieve to
see a citizen preferring to the public il∣lumination
a paltry subscription for an
universal religion.</P>
<P>Dr. Bounce, hitherto silent, started up
in an explosion of rage. Imagine to your∣self
the shape of Dr. Slop, the fat of parson
Trulliber, put on an immoderate bushy wig,
place a pair of spectacles on two ardent
eyes, glowing like two of Argand's lamps
through their clear glass; cheeks, full as
those of Aeolus, when he blows his last
puff in a rage; a mannikin of about four
feet in height, and two in breadth, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wirl∣ing
its square obesity, rather kicking
than treading on the ground, bellowing
like a young bull.—But before we pro∣ceed▪
we have to observe, that Dr.
Bounce, was a friend to all religions but
the established; because that was no
establishment for him, being a placable
<PB N="95" REF="118"/>
Unitarian without duplicity or servility.
As for the professed atheist he cared little,
for he himself, had he met his Saviour in
the street, would have pushed him from
the wall; but the sudden reflection on
the successful subscriptions of Sympathy,
associating with the idea of the easy seats
that his auditors always found whenever
he preached in the Old Jewry, wound up
his phlegm till the cord of patience snap∣ped.
“You are, said he, a self-elected
Archbishop, an atheist in the pulpit, a
most damnably successful hypocrite”—so
saying, the orbicular doctor disappeared,
rolling like a ball of living fire. Mr.
Rant hastened to his tribune, to lec∣ture
on the seven Roman kings, whom
it was little imagined, would have
had to encounter such keen enmities
among the apprentices and journeymen of
the cities of London and Westminster.
Lord Belfield retired, ill pleased with Sub∣tile's
<PB N="96" REF="119"/>
chapter on property. And Mr.
Dragon was not less displeased to see the
assembly break up before he could exhi∣bit
two models of republican instru∣ments;
a walking cane, in which nine
daggers were so artificially fixed that they
could thrust in nine directions, and a
fowling-piece containing nine barrels,
which were managed by one trigger. It
was in this manner he proposed arming
every citizen; and enlightening a nation,
by the flames of its metropolis!</P>

<P>TO delineate the thoughts of Charles,
as he stept into bed, is what we can∣not
now attempt; his mind was involved
in obscurity, every new object added per∣plexity
to perplexity, and he even sus∣pected
that the systems he had adopted
from his youth might possibly not be less
absurd. Such is the first state of a mind,
that, partially enlightened, sees much and
comprehends little; and, if ingenuous,
either closes in extravagant scepticism<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The device of La Mothe le Vaier, was,

And that of Montaigne,

<P>When Aristotle says, that the <HI>beginning</HI> of wisdom consists in doubting, there is little danger to be in∣curred in this principle; but much, if the <HI>end</HI> of wisdome it is agreed can to go no further, which has been the folly of some wise men.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="98" REF="121"/>
and habitual apathy; or patiently investi∣gating
the phenomena of human life, per∣fects
its observations, arranges the facts
it assembles, and takes a human interest
in whatever relates to humanity. Be∣tween
the glowing reveries of a Shaftes∣bury,
and the congealing misanthropy of
a Mandeville, Charles stood poised by
the solid judgment which exercise had
fortified, and with the sensibility with
which nature had touched his frame.
Without any indecision, he yet hesitated
to decide; for although he trusted to the
prompt energies of his heart, he yet was
not assured that its sensations were faith∣ful,
and its impulses unerring.</P>
<P>Among the literary society at Lord
Belfield's, he selected only one person for
his companion, the silent Mr. Johnson,
whom he discovered to be a most con∣versible
<PB N="99" REF="122"/>
person. The world is apt to ri∣dicule
the friendship of a youth with a
man of advanced age; but such is nei∣ther
incongruous nor undesirable; youth
is not instructed by youth, age is not de∣lighted
by age. The ardency of friend∣ship
is never, perhaps, more intense than
in those who, united in the same habits,
are directed by an unequal experience.
An imperceptible superiority interests
without mortifying; it is an emulation,
it is a counsel, it is an aid; in whatever
form it appears to our judgment, it has
nothing of the malice of rivality. It is a
local enjoyment, of which none are more
sensible of its want than men of genius
and reflection. Such a friendship is the
passion of a sage; the only excess he dares
not disapprove; it is the sense of our ex∣istence
in that of another. Such was the
union which took place between Charles
and the observing Johnson. Charles, with
<PB N="100" REF="123"/>
all the exuberance of animal spirits, had
taught himself to feel more pleasure in
listening than in conversing; the surest
criterion of future excellence, and the
pleasantest kind of conversation to our
friends.</P>
<P>It was now that season when the opu∣lent
appear most gay, and the poor most
wretched; when the halls of the great are
sultry as summer, while the mendicant
mourns the rigours of a heaven as unre∣lenting
as man; when the flambeaux that
light the rapid chariot dart their transient
flame over some human spectres, perhaps
a mother and her infants who have retired
to sleep on the frozen earth, and picking
the offal-bone they find in the street, con∣ceive
the thoughtless waste of luxury to
be benevolence. Now the crowded the∣atres
and the splendid opera have not one
elbow-place to support, nor one breath of
air to revive, an hysterical beauty, alike
<PB N="101" REF="124"/>
oppressed by extreme heat and pathos.
In plainer English, <HI>every body</HI> was in
town; for as we justly call a certain cir∣cle
of society the <HI>great world,</HI> so as justly
we suppose the whole of its honourable
members to be <HI>every body.</HI> Lady Bel∣field
now dispersed several packs of cards
of invitation, to the uninterrupted dis∣turbance
of three adjacent streets.</P>
<P>What an object for Charles was a fa∣shionable
rout! what a whirl for the eye
of fancy! what a labour for the head of
meditation! Three spacious drawing∣rooms
were thrown open; a multitude
were announced, who glided in, and si∣lently
took their places at a table, as if
every thing was to be conducted with the
utmost secrecy. From each flight of
stairs a number of names revolved in
echoes, while the noble mistress was oc∣cupied,
even to extreme fatigue, in sa∣luting,
not her friends who entered (for
<PB N="102" REF="125"/>
their entrance was so rapid and continuous
that a distinct and separate salutation was
impossible) but the echoes of confused
names, which, had she distinguished, she
could not easily have fixed on their own∣ers.
Above three hundred friends were
assembled, who, out of kindness, paid no
attention to the noble and exhausted lady.
She stood among the crowd as if she were
deserted; her hurried intellect seemed only
lodged in the ear; and her whole enter∣tainment
consisted in listening to the re∣verberation
of names, in bowing to the
passing shadows that flitted by, and in
exchanging, for a short moment, a few
distant smiles.</P>
<P>What an incongruity of personages!
If wit consists in an unexpected associa∣tion
of remote ideas, perhaps something
like wit is felt by the mind when we ex∣amine
the odd coincidencies of a rout.
Through the narrow lanes formed by the
<PB N="103" REF="126"/>
numerous card-tables, Charles glided at
first with a pleasing astonishment. An∣tiquated
dames were the rivals of bloom∣ing
virgins. Cards, like death, level all,
and spread an universal silence. In the
abstraction of Whist, and the complexity
of Cassino, the sense of beauty seemed
lost in the men, and the charms of lo∣quacious
elegance in the women. At
length this mute exhibition ceased to in∣terest.
S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, it appeared to Charles, to
view grey-headed Folly enquiring, with
a bewildered air, for the trumps; and
while his fever was only visible in his
hollow eyes, seeming to forget his chalky
hands and flannel feet. Pleasant was the
spectacle, to observe little girls directing
their palsied grandmothers in sorting the
cards and numbering the fish, while their
little bosoms, trembling with a pious af∣fection
for their parents, often by a glance
became more useful auxiliaries than the
<PB N="104" REF="127"/>
tenderness of their years seemed to pro∣mise.
Painful to the eye of Charles▪
to observe some of the most beautiful
countenances in Europe distorted with
the hideous passions, or assuming a mas∣culine
exultation. How rapid are the
lines that disorder the face of beauty;
how the fiery shade of passion inflames
the tender vermilion of the female cheek;
and how much good-humour and su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity
of manners are thrown away on the turn∣ing
of a foolish card!</P>
<P>Tired with the monotonous scene, and
one table being only the reflection of
another, Charles withdrew into a corner,
resolved rather to see nothing than to
suffer the iteration of unmeaning ob∣jects.
Mr. Johnson, who had observed
his motions, came to his relief; and
seating himself, selected the characters
that were most easily distinguishable, for
the amusement of his young friend.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="128"/>
“My good friend,” said he, “a rout
is not the unintelligent scene you ima∣gine.”
When I look round, indeed, I
am reminded of the republic of bees,
which Buffon describes with more inge∣nuity
than philosophy; for he tells us,
that they are only ten thousand automata,
assembled in the same place, acting pre∣cisely
in the same manner; and that the
order observable in the society is merely
an apparent one, for the same regularity
would take place in any other automata;
one impels the other, and therefore each,
impelling and impelled, gives a sem∣blance
of rational order. A rout, Charles,
to a town-philosopher, is as useful as
the perusal of a voluminous catalogue
of books to a man of letters; it reminds
him of titles he had forgotten, and ex∣cites
a recollection of their contents.</P>
<P>Observe that most amiable of her sex
on the right, and at two tables lower,
<PB N="106" REF="129"/>
a countenance that yields in nothing,
though a few years more of age have
diminished its graces, while they impart
its dignity. Nature tells you they are
sisters. The elder is more cheerful; be∣cause,
perhaps, a protracted pain that is
irremediable, diminishes that romantic
sensibility which distinguishes her lovely
sister. Alas! their diamond stomacher
covers a bleeding heart; hearts that have
been violently lacerated from the ten∣derest
felicity. A little further sits their
father; mark how slowly he takes up
the tricks, and how cautiously he lays
down his card. He is a merchant, who,
when he found his credit on the decline,
turned out his four daughters to a
sanctioned prostitution, known by the
phrase of great and honourable con∣nexions.
Those two daughters had in∣terchanged
their affections with two
amiable men; but the speculator found
it necessary to annihilate the passion
<PB N="107" REF="130"/>
that once he had encouraged. When
he hung on the sharpest verge of ruin,
he assumed the highest style of living,
introduced his daughters to the first cir∣cles,
and kept his eye on our Indian
princes. We have among the imported
luxuries of the age, exhausted and pith∣less
beings, who return with the rapine
of thirty years, and are only punished by
the climate in which they effected their
depredations. They come to be married
and to be buried in England, and to
plant on their tomb some violated and
weeping rose of love. Such are the two
beings that grasped the hands, but could
not reach the hearts of those injured
beauties. Modern fathers! Such is the
Moloch rage that sacrifices your children
to your ambition! This merchant, in
the freedom of British land, has made
an Indian market for female beauty! He
still has two other slaves to sell, whom
<PB N="108" REF="131"/>
he will not only send away portionless,
but, by their connexions, will inflame
the radical avarice of his sons, and ini∣tiate
them into all the mysteries of com∣mercial
speculation. Meanwhile, I could
assure the husbands of those two young
ladies, that they consider themselves in
a gloomy state of widowhood; and mourn,
at every interval of reflection, the beloved
partners of their affections, which shall
not cease but with the last palpitation of
their heart.</P>
<P>Your eyes are fixed on that majestic
form; what an easy grace! what elo∣quent
features! what harmonious tones!
That lady was for one winter the public
favourite on the stage; the heart-thrilling
sister of Thalia. She was (for her dra∣matic
existence has long ceased) one of
those rare intelligences who can embody
the conceptions of the poet, and, chang∣ing
with every character her own habits
<PB N="109" REF="132"/>
and her own voice, diffuse around, the
higher illusion of the scene; she never
reminded you of the same old acquaint∣ance
in Euphrasia, in Ophelia, or in Ju∣liet.
A poet, more distinguished in ano∣ther
republic than that of letters, ob∣tained
her hand. His dissipated fortune
his lady might easily repair by a theatri∣cal
engagement; but, unluckily for the
public and himself, the stern republican
will not consent that his wife should ap∣pear
on a <HI>theatre-royal,</HI> and be enlisted
among <HI>his Majesty's servants.</HI></P>
<P>Those two gentlemen in close conver∣sation
are an author by profession, and a
fashionable bard. The latter has the
same foppish elegance in his dress as in
his verse; and his port-folio, abounding
with every species of poetry, has the
same variety as his wardrobe. He has
a strong party in every fashionable cir∣cle,
who buy a certain number of his
<PB N="110" REF="133"/>
poems, and come, in a certain number,
to his comedy or his tragedy. Some li∣terary
men owe their connexions to their
reputation, but he his reputation to his
connexions. When he favours his friends
with a rehearsal of his manuscripts, he
takes in his chariot a little Welsh harp,
plays his songs to his own music, and
the modern minstrel sits,
<Q>“Proud as Apollo on his forked hill.”</Q>
When he reads a dismal legend, he is
accompanied by that author, whose bu∣siness
it is to give
<Q>“The cue of passion;”</Q>
and to shew, by his own motions, when
the auditors are to exclaim “Exquisite!”
or “Bravo!” and when to wipe their
eyes.</P>
<P>As for the author, he is here among a
numerous circle of patrons. He lives
<PB N="111" REF="134"/>
fashionably among the fashionable, and
yet pretends to derive his existence from
his pen. Ye powers of genius! ye liberal
bounties of patronage! And yet, Charles,
the booksellers know little of this great
genius. At an assembly like the present
he collects subscriptions now for a novel,
now for a poem, now for his travels.</P>
<P>Charles here interrupted Mr. Johnson,
by enquiring how it was that if this writer
was destitute of learning or genius, he
could collect with such facility such nu∣merous
subscriptions?</P>
<P>Johnson continued: Had he genius
or learning, he had not been here. One
part of his subscribers are ambitious to
insert their names in a list sparkling with
so many titles; and the rest have their
reasons—What reasons? asked Charles.
—Must I tell all? He is the most conve∣nient
and adroit person his fashionable
friends have long employed.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="135"/>
I am surprised to see Mr. Million,
that elderly man, this evening. I am po∣sitive
he cannot discern a card; listen!
there is a revoke! This morning he has
concluded with the minister a loan nego∣tiation.
He is now forming calculations.
Observe, while the cards are dealing, how
nimbly his fingers move; every pressure
on his thumb is worth a thousand. His
whole life is a reverie of per cents, eights,
and quarters; he wakes himself in his
dreams by calling out the names of stock-jobbers;
and as soon as he returns from
the stock exchange fills sheets of calcula∣tion
to decide what stock he shall change
for another stock, to what price he shall
raise the omnium, and riots in his nume∣rical
imagination, by anticipating the next
year's loan. He realises thousands for
his breakfast; and when he appears at the
Bank, his magical eye can excite as many
passions as that of Mrs. Siddons. A ges∣ture
<PB N="113" REF="136"/>
will fall the stocks, a laugh will
raise them, and the public property is at
the mercy of Mr. Million, and a dozen
more of “the dunghill-breed of men.”
Million, was the throne to be sold, like
another Didius, would be the highest
bidder. Were Poland not dismembered,
were America not unwilling—Ah poor
Million! thou canst be no king, but thou
mayest be a German Margrave, and I
fear an English Lord.</P>
<P>Something of Mr. Million's arts of
arithmetic have been greatly wanted by
that elegant man of fashion, who was so
unfortunate as to come too early to his
rental; which little circumstance has
ruined his constitution, his morals, and
his sense. He married, before he became of
age, a lady who had nothing but her beau∣ty,
with a violent desire of distinction. He
is scarcely thirty, and not one splendid
fragment of his fortune remains. His
<PB N="114" REF="137"/>
lady, merely from a rage of notoriety, in∣dulged
a passion for gaming in excess,
heightened every art of dissipation, and
invented some peculiar to herself. She
had gold baskets of bank notes brought
repeatedly in an evening; the bills of her
fancy-dresser annually amounted to seve∣ral
thousands; she had numerous esta∣blishments,
and brilliant equipages, and
she fed on the sweet hope of seeing her
Baronet in the upper house. Her hus∣band
was, however, a calculator, but on
a different principle from Mr. Million.
“I have, said he, a net income of 15,000.
I shall spend annually 30 for ten years;
I shall mortgage at least five more on the
credit of the former ten; by that time I
shall be in the house of lords; a pension and
my connexions will then set all to rights.”
—But the time has now elapsed; his
expenditure exceeded his enormous cal∣culation;
and his houses at this mo∣ment
<PB N="115" REF="138"/>
seem to be places of auction, where
every thing is placed for sale. He is now
studious of the acquaintance of those
youths who seem to have made much the
same kind of calculation. He is a cer∣tain
introducer at Brooke's. Her Lady∣ship,
from Duchesses with whom she
hoped to rank, now receives only slights;
these, in her turn, she conveys to her ac∣quaintance,
and takes her revenge on
them for the contumely she receives at
court. She feels that fine expression of
the poet, of
<Q>“Hard unkindness' altered eye.”</Q>
They live separately, for the benefit of not
tasting the bitterness of mutual reproach,
and sleep alone, on the burning pillow of
mad ambition and ruined grandeur.</P>
<P>That is Mr. **** the associate of
our Premier. What a portrait for the
face of Dulness in the next edition of the
<PB N="116" REF="139"/>
Dunciad! Observe his soporisic eye, his
leaden attitude, and his mighty head
buried in his breast. Five minutes more,
and the view of him would make me
sleep. He has just the abilities of a head
clerk at a banking-house. Our minister,
with his law education, has a notion that
the dullest men are the most faithful ser∣vants.
They never disconcert a scheme by
any amendments of their own; obse∣quious
and exact! The clock-work of
government it seems can never go right,
unless it has a proper number of leaden
weights. Since the prosperity of England
is now made to consist in its finance, and
our minister is the first accomptant in the
kingdom, perhaps to cypher and to copy
may form the official capacities for every
great statesman. I once thought that ex∣actness
was the sublime of fools.</P>
<P>Observe that female whose upper lip is
bearded. Surely it was some error of
<PB N="117" REF="140"/>
nature to put in that athletic form a heart
that dissolves at a pressure, and blood that
is inflamed by a glance. She half closes
her eyes, she emits the tenderest sighs, and
her air is collected and serene; in a word,
she is all love and religion. Already four
husbands have died in her disconsolate
arms, and she has gone through the history
of all religions, for to all she has been a
convert. She is now almost stationary,
fixed between animal magnetism and Ro∣sycrucianism.
That female associate for
Hercules is often agitated by spiritual in∣fluence,
and scatters her intendered spirits
in the delicious mollifications of “a lumi∣nous
crisis.” Religion leads on to love,
and love reconducts to religion; not a
terrene object forms one human care; the
<HI>illuminé</HI> feels no more an affection for the
dearest relatives of life; all earth is a dung∣hill,
and all it's creatures are reptiles; all,
but the tall professor in magnetism, and
<PB N="118" REF="141"/>
the rotund Rosycrucian, who, in their
turn, are admitted to an ecstatic tête-à-tête.</P>
<P>Those two who appear in such perfect
friendship, while the lady is compliment∣ing
her companion, you may be surprised
Charles, but they are really man and wife.
He is the feeble and formal Professor Lotus,
that great historiographer; a curious com∣position
of modern pedantry and literary
inanity. He married because his lady dis∣covered
in him the most elevated accom∣plishments,
and, in a word, that he was
the first genius of the age. Do not con∣temn
that woman's judgment; I assure
you 'tis an excellent one; when she charm∣ed
the Doctor with this discovery, she was
then past forty. Her usual conversation
is generally in this manner—“This is just,
my dear, as you have observed in the life
of the king of Sweden;”—or, “Professor
Lotus has described this admirably in his
<PB N="119" REF="142"/>
universal history.” At which the learned
Professor strokes his face, grinning with
complacency, and casts a look around,
meaning, “it is very true, I have said this
in my history.”</P>
<P>That young man who leans against the
chimney slab, twirling his seals, and fix∣ing
his eye on the wainscot, resembling a
taylor's layman, which some use to hang
their dresses on, as a model of the last
fashion; and that other human puppet,
the lady his companion piece, are two as
unfortunate beings as are to be found in
these rooms. They are what the French
happily express <HI>des desoeuvrés,</HI> persons out
of employment. A trifle more of sense
and fortune would put them in action;
but as it is, they are doomed to be only
the elegant furniture of a drawing-room;
human ornaments for a chimney-piece,
instead of the old Mandarines, who really
had more animation, when properly touch∣ed,
<PB N="120" REF="143"/>
than the present breathing statues. Mar∣riage
bears too high a price for either▪
their income is scarcely sufficient for their
dress; but their connexions are great,
and enable them to get through the entire
business of their day in Bond-street. Late
rising, short meals, and long dressing, and
an evening protracted to midnight, is the
uniform nullity of their existence. They
have made friends from the total incapa∣city
of differing in opinion. To listen and
assent is the only operation of their mind.
Attracted by a similarity of character and
situation, they are generally seen leaning
together on a chimney-piece. They seem
to meet in silent pleasure, occasionally as∣sisting
each other in dividing a solitary
idea; for when one commences with ef∣fort
to express something like a thought,
but which dies in its birth, the other, by
an equal effort, attempts to aid its imper∣fect
delivery.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="144"/>
There, is a more singular character!
that young man occupies the same station
in life as those chimney ornaments, but
his fortune and his talents are alike consi∣derable.
His curiosity is inexhaustible,
his ingenuity active; he might be a man
of genius; but, inconsiderate prodigal! he
exhausts his opulence on the meanest ob∣jects.
Science has enlightened, and, what
is more rare, taste has refined; but his
scientific genius is employed on inventing
shoe-latchets which close and open by a
particular motion of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et; and he has
exhibited more industry and invention in
the manufacture of certain snuff-boxes,
than would be necessary to complete an
important discovery in natural philoso∣phy.
He has just returned from an ec∣centric
excursion to Greenland, his curio∣sity
having been excited at hearing that a
whale had never been anatomised on the
spot! He has travelled to India through
<PB N="122" REF="145"/>
the deserts of Arabia; has been at the
head of the Nile; and was the first British
aeronaut. The same ardour and facility,
directed to nobler objects, had distin∣guished
this ingenious idler by an emi∣nence
of talents.</P>
<P>There is ****. And has he yet the
audacity to exist? View the descendant
of an illustrious family; his ancestors,
even in the dissolute age of the second
Charles, relaxed not of their austere ho∣nesty,
and exulted in the patrimonial dig∣nity
of a long and uncorrupted line. Their
revenues were large as their virtues; and
when my Lord Duke came to their vene∣rated
title, his compliances with a certain
party were considered as the condescen∣tion
of affection, rather than the subjec∣tion
of imbecility. He was a woodcock
for those who make springes. Dissipation
was spirit, caprice invention, and absurdi∣ty
humour. Did you enquire where is
<PB N="123" REF="146"/>
the Duke? oh! he is playing at tennis with
his grooms, or sparring with his pugilists,
or in his theatre leaping with harlequin.
Happy had my Lord Duke been only an
idiot. It was his pride to throw at the
largest sums. Four of his friends resolved
to set him out; they mutually agreed to
play till each had ruined himself, or his
adversary. The Duke sent the three first
away, after three days and three nights,
bankrupts in fortune and in honour. One
retired to return no more, and presented
to conjugal affection, to filial hope, and
to anxious honesty, a bleeding corse. The
Duke was alike forsaken by his fortune,
and the accumulation of centuries was
dissolved at one final throw. These are
not all his crimes—but enough. With an
unmanly consolation he has sworn, that
the noble race of the **** shall close
with him; and in that virtuous family at
length is seen, one, who laboured with
<PB N="124" REF="147"/>
more zeal to blot their name on the fair
page of history, in a few short years, than
they did to preserve it unblemished
through ages. There is a zeal, a devo∣tion,
an enthusiasm in villainy, as in
virtue.</P>

<P>SOME professor in a German univer∣sity,
has, in the elaboration of three
folios, proved, that our country is a coun∣try
of sects; not that this was really the
point he aimed at; we will venture to
affirm, that was above him. The disco∣very
is, indeed, quite our own, effected by
the page of his contents, which having
carefully cut out of his long performance,
abounding in long periods (and which it
is charitable to advise an asthmatic pa∣tient
not to read out, and a purblind one
not to read at all): we now consider,
that we can put <HI>L'esprit</HI> of the aforesaid
three German folios, in our waistcoat-pocket.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="149"/>
<HI>Multae sunt mansiones in domo patris mei,</HI>
that is, in plain English, we abound with
chapels, meetings, conventicles, &amp;c. An
Englishman, like a true son of liberty,
goes to Heaven by the road which pleases
him best; or changes it, with the same
happy indifference, as the famous Count
Bonneval, who observed, when he became
a Mahometan at Constantinople, that it
was only exchanging a hat for a night∣cap.</P>
<P>The discovery of “TRUTH,” has prov∣ed
not less perplexing to philosophers in
all ages, than to “the elect” of the pre∣sent.
Even in lettered Rome, there ex∣isted
such a variety of <HI>sects,</HI> (by courtesy
called philosophical) that it were uncandid
not to allow the same to the good people
of England; who really are <HI>people</HI> by
their number and their character. Shall
every great philosopher of the day, “all
and each” be permitted to have an infi∣nite
<PB N="127" REF="150"/>
variety of <HI>no-religions,</HI> while the peo∣ple
are to be ridiculed for having no less
a variety of <HI>religions?</HI> We oscitants and
philosophers have seven Sundays in the
week, changing perhaps every Sunday
our system; those who only have, by act
of parliament, but an hebdomadal Sun∣day,
(the very day too that their shops
are barred and bolted) are much more in
want of a place of public entertainment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A philosophie lady is of opinion, that playing at bowls or skittles on Sundays, as in all catholic coun∣tries, is more innocent and religious than attending public prayers. She alledges no trifling reason in sup∣port of her opinion, “As it might stop the progress of <HI>methodism,</HI> and of that <HI>fanatical spirit</HI> which appears to be gaining ground.” Wollstonecraft's Letters, p. 113.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Love and Terror, those two springs of
the human heart, and that principle in
nature, which conducts the philosopher
<PB N="128" REF="151"/>
to the theatre, to save him from the atro∣phy
of listless inaction, and which volun∣tarily
we allow to give the thrill of artificial
terrors, or to dissolve us with fictitious ten∣derness,
that principle it is, which con∣ducts
the sectarist to his little assembly.
If we reflect, we may discover that the
very talents which make Kemble a finish∣ed
performer on the stage, conduce to
form a sectarist in his pulpit; the only
difference is, that the pulpit orator has
experimentally acquired certain notions,
which are peculiarly adapted to agitate
the dispositions of his auditors; but
tragic horrors, and amatorial passions,
alike form each dramatic exhibition. On
this curious subject, the penetrating
Hobbes has thrown out an observation,
now as fresh and vigorous as it was in
the last century, “There be very few
bishops (says he) that ACT A SERMON
<PB N="129" REF="152"/>
as well, as divers presbyterians and
fanatic preachers can do<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following passage from a letter of Voltaire, elucidates this subject with greater effect, and is at the same time a delicious morsel of criticism. Bourdaloue was nearly the Corneille of the pulpit, as Massillon was afterwards the Racine. Bourdaloue was desirous of arguing like Corneille, and Massil∣lon studied to be as elegant in prose as Racine in verse. Bourdaloue was accused, as was Corneille, of too much reasoning, too much proving instead of touching, and sometimes giving but indifferent proofs; in a word they had both too much of the Pleader. Massillon, on the contrary, considered that it was best to paint and to agitate; he imitated Racine as much as he could be imitated in prose. His style is pure, and his pictures are affecting. He is a pupil who attempts to wrestle with his master—Massillon and Cheminais knew Racine by heart, and concealed the verses of this divine poet in their pious prose.</P>
<P>It was thus that many preachers were accustomed to take lessons of Baron the actor, in the art of decla∣mation; and afterwards adjusting the gesture of the player, by gestures suitable to a holy orator. No∣thing proves clearer, that all the arts are fraternal, although artists are far from being so.</P>
<P>In another place he observes, that Massillon imi∣tated Racine in preaching, yet all dramatic writers he damned! every apothecary vaunts his own me∣dicine, and explodes the use of his neighbour's.</P></NOTE>.”</P>

Pure Protestantism, refined almost to a
philosophical institution, loses it's parti∣sans
among the people. The people have

<P>The public are acquainted with a vo∣lumnious
catalogue of sects; but hun∣dreds,
<PB N="131" REF="154"/>
like small subterraneous currents,
are only known to those who reside at the
little source. A sect without a Hill to
bellow, a Lady Selina to patronise, or a
Priestley to sanction with his loquacious
learning, confines it's heavenly ambition
in the darkness of an alley, or perhaps
extends it's salvation through some neigh∣bouring
streets. A philosopher may dis∣cover
in this metropolis, an old crippled
religion, crutched and led, or an infant
one, of scarcely a year's growth. In one
place he may be taught that Jesus was
neither con-substantial nor co-equal with
the father, but was begotten out of no∣thing,
and out of time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arianism.</NOTE>; and this jar∣gon,
will induce these to come to verbal
or corporeal controversy, with those who
within twenty doors inform you, that if
we do nothing for Heaven, we do all that
God requires; for he only requires faith,
<PB N="132" REF="155"/>
and bestows on us his grace; that all the
moral law is nothing, for holiness is no∣thing,
but grace and justification are all
in all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antinomianism.</NOTE>. As many doors further, a man
may learn, how he is to be turned into a
babe, by regeneration, but not by justifi∣cation;
while the sisters are exhorted,
never to meditate on the circumcision
of Jesus, but with a profound venera∣tion
of that part of the human body, on
which the fall of Adam seems to have
cast an odium; and, not to dissatisfy the
fair, with no unadroit flattery they are
informed, that all souls are of the femi∣nine
sex. There are, (says the famous
Zinzendrorf) only <HI>animae,</HI> and no <HI>animi</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Moravians. This Count Bishop's reveries, are sufficiently known by their close alliance of love with religion.

<PB N="133" REF="156"/>
And is it not wonderful, that by this am∣bi-dexterous
adulation, every woman is
not a Moravian? In assemblies like the
present, the philosopher will not be a lit∣tle
amused by the table-talk, or spiritual
chit-chat of the members who meet, for
the pleasures of half an hour's conversa∣tion.

saints, enquiries of—“Who is in dan∣ger?”

liquor, are sufficient to set up either trade.</P>

appeared, was an old acquaintance of the

place.</P>

I'll have nothing more to do with those
preachers, who depend entirely on the
favour of the ladies. Women are as
capricious with their religions as with their
ribbands, and change their ministers, with
as much facility as their milliners. If
there had not occurred now and then,
a revelation, a resurrection, or a lumi∣nous
crisis in animal magnetism, my shop
had stood empty; rows of their books
moved as little as a stand of hackney
coaches in fair weather. “Fair is foul,
and foul is fair,” (as the witches say in
Macbeth,) to those who are venders of
controversy, or keepers of hackney-coaches.
This winter has brought mat∣ters
round. Don't you know, Sir, that
one Fleming, (Heaven rest his soul) did
really predict the downfal of the French
monarchy? A thousand have done the
same; so the chance was, that if ever it
occurred, some one would, as they all
<PB N="136" REF="159"/>
differed about the time, come pretty near
the mark. If no one had, they would
have remained quietly on the dusty
shelves of the Red-cross-street Presbyte∣rian
<HI>public</HI> library, where no one is ad∣mitted
but the librarian. What with re∣publishing
new editions of Fleming, who
predicted this downfal in 1793, and other
little matters; as the public is a ravenous
animal of curiosity, it's hundred hands, and
it's hundred eyes, were all in motion. Some
vociferated for those who had predicted
this great event, within twenty or thirty
years; while others, who considered them∣selves
not less wise, though not so nice,
were satisfied with those who only pre∣dicted
it in the course of the century.
Sir, all this I owe to the book of Revela∣tions;
it has more in it than infidels will
allow; and seems to me to be a legacy
left by Saint John, for the benefit of ho∣nest
christian booksellers.</P>

“But the prophet that has lately arisen!”
and the member of parliament! The row
is in commotion; we are all as happy as
an undisturbed hive of bees. But these
are damnably oppressive times, when a
prophet is sent to Bedlam! I did intend
to have given this prophet for his copy∣right,
his board and lodging, which is all
I think a prophet can fairly require. It
has been a great injury to me, that he
is confined in Bedlam. Yet, I have
hired a prophet at a guinea a week; but
the fellow has more wit than insanity, or
rather he is insanely witty, and may get
me into Newgate for his libels. Besides,
what is a prophet without a member?
The fellow prates about his cleverness
and originality; but a prophet should
not be clever or original. Let him be
drunk as Isaiah, melancholy as Jeremiah,
descriptive as Ezekiel, grumbling as Jo∣nah,
as great a dreamer as Daniel, and

to lose ground by the meanness of it's

<P>“Marvellous is it to me,
gentlemen, that you are not acquainted

fellow is of excellent promise; stout and
hale, seems long-lived, and has a fist like a
Hercules. Of theological controversi∣alists,
we judge generally by their corporeal
state. In the grounds of theology, this
author spreads about and becomes as era∣dicable
<PB N="141" REF="164"/>
and acrid as horse-raddish; root
him out, up he springs, and runs over any
ground where he is once fairly fixed. The
dog's works sell, for he has two meetings,
and manages matters to admiration. In
Monckton-street, where his auditors consist
of aged tradesmen and canting old sisters,
with not a drop of warm blood under their
shrivelled skin, he rouses them with groans
and sighs, for the eternity of hell fires, and
his grand system is there <HI>the fear of God.</HI>
—But in Titchfield-street, a gayer part of
the town, with an audience of pretty girls
and smart dashers, he is luxuriant in the
joys of paradise, the fountain of bliss, the
songs of Solomon, and his system there
consists of <HI>the love of God.</HI> I have a great
respect for Mr. Huntington, although he
was only a coal-heaver till gifted by the
spirit, and assist him as well as I can in his
orthography. Heaven rarely sends with
it's illuminations grammatical knowledge.

such force, a dismal hoarseness from a sore
throat has taken place; and the great
preacher at this moment can only talk in
whispers.”</P>
</SP>
<P>Here closed this singular conversation;
but as Charles felt still a curiosity in what
related to this voluminous saint, in re∣turning
home Johnson gave him a sketch
of his character and his life.</P>
<P>“Can we call that man a fanatic (said
Johnson) who,” from the occupation of
digging in a coal-pit, has had the sagacity
and the art to establish two religious fra∣ternities
of his own, and realise a consider∣able
income? In his circumscribed space,
<PB N="143" REF="166"/>
he has effected as much as Mahomet, had
he only had two streets in this metropolis
at his command, could probably have
done.</P>
<P>Mr. Huntington has favoured the
world with his own life and his own
portrait; and to my taste they are more
interesting than Mr. Gilbert Wakefield's
and Mr. John Lackington's, both gentle∣men
who are willing to assist posterity by
two lives which, I am of opinion, no one
else had been solicitous to write; not∣withstanding
Mr. Wakefield can recollect
as great a number of quotations in Greek
verse, as Mr. Lackington seems to have
known in English; but a quotation is no∣thing
but a quotation, whether in Greek
or in English; and Mr. Lackington is far
superior to the aforesaid Mr. Gilbert
Wakefield in his vernacular idiom; for not∣withstanding
the said Greek excerpts of the
said Gil, he composes English verse and
<PB N="144" REF="167"/>
prose in the same manner that Aristotle
would himself have done, if that Grecian
had resided a few months in England.</P>
<P>“For heaven's sake (said Charles,” in∣terrupting
Johnson) leave Wakefield
quietly among his boys. Consider
<Q><L>“Pains, reading, study, are <HI>his</HI> just pretence,</L>
<L>And all <HI>he</HI> wants is spirit, taste, and sense.”</L></Q></P>
<P>Johnson. “Shall I suffer in silence his
flashing and pidling” of our immortal
Pope? As for his shilling politics, or his
poetical libels, called translations, I and
the world would have said nothing. But
I lose my patience, and let me own it too,
when a pedant, ostentatiously throws his
heavy offerings on the altar of the
Graces.</P>
<P>Saint Huntington passed his early
years in a coal-pit, and there to this
moment would have remained quietly,
had accident not thrown a Bible in his
<PB N="145" REF="168"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and. With an empty stomach and a
full head, the night brought visions, and
the day inspirations. When the mind is
bewitched by a religious fancy, the com∣monest
incident, and the slightest accident,
bear with them testimonies of the election
of heaven. Mark what I have observed;
when a man is once fairly converted, as
certain will he convert others; it is the
very precept of Horace in other words;
for what has brought conviction to one
fool, will serve for the conviction of ano∣ther.
Two sages argue without perceiv∣ing
a mutual conviction; wisdom finds
innumerable impediments; when two fools
reason, the first who begins will be cer∣tain
of persuading the other; folly pro∣pagates
with facility. I could give you
good metaphysical reasons for this. Our
Saint's coal-pit became a conventicle. He
exulted, and emerged into light. Men,
women, and children crowded.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="169"/>
Huntington, besides being a great
swearer, lyar, &amp;c. was as brawny as Sam∣son,
and as amorous as David. He had
his Dalilah and his Bathsheba. Satan,
disguised in the gravity of a churchwar∣den,
informed him, that whatever free∣dom
this country allows to be taken with
the spirit, the act of parliament was strong
relative to those of the outward man.
This was the first trial; and he confesses
that he was the most inveterate of sinners,
eager for repetition, and careless of repen∣tance;
but then, as he further observes,
gold which is burnt seven times in the
furnace, loses it's alloy, and at length
comes out in all it's virgin purity.</P>
<P>When Satan, in the form of a church∣warden,
disappeared, Huntington flew
from his coal-pit with the wings of an
angel; that is, with rapidity and holiness.
As it has been the custom of all divine
men (probably for reasons best known to
<PB N="147" REF="170"/>
themselves) since the time of Abraham,
when they run away, because they are
called by the Lord, to disguise by enlarg∣ing
their names, so did our present saint.
Every thing, my friend, in this world is
imitation. His original name was <HI>Hunt,</HI>
which he now enlarged to that of <HI>Hunting∣ton,</HI>
and for which take his reasons. <HI>Hunt,</HI>
because I am engaged in the chace of the
wicked, or rather, as we have seen, the
wicked were in chace of him; <HI>ing,</HI> because
this is the end of all wickedness, such as
swearing lying, &amp;c.; and <HI>ton,</HI> because I am
a vessel of the Lord.</P>
<P>I shall not dwell on the visions and ap∣paritions
of Mr. Huntington, they are
minutely recorded in his life; and all that
we can learn from them is, that when once
a man begins to see visions, like any other
habit, it grows on him. His new name,
however, was not more fortunate than it's
predecessor; Satan pursued him from place
<PB N="148" REF="171"/>
to place, and always chose the same figure
of a parish guardian. Now the man grew
famous throughout the land, “from Dan
even unto Beersheba,” that is, about a cir∣cumference
of three miles. His enemies
gathered, and suspicions spread, that he was
not “a going about doing good,” and
<HI>merely</HI> for the <HI>propagation</HI> of the Gospel.</P>
<P>Amidst all such persecutions he bore
himself up like a man and a prophet;
that is, he has given an unblushing ac∣count
of his conduct, compares himself
with David and Solomon, and returns
devout thanks that he is no worse than
they were. Our missionary established a
regular thriving trade; disserting in prose,
and allegorising in verse, not indeed
with the fertile imagination of a Bunyan,
but with that vein of vulgar sense, which
to the vulgar is true eloquence.</P>
<P>A little country tabernacle was now
his pride and his ambition. He suc∣ceeded
<PB N="149" REF="172"/>
in all those divine and valuable pro∣jects,
which fancy could excite in the brain
of an apostolical coal-digger. Satan now as∣sumed
another form, that of an Arian
landlord. And this was the happy origin
of his good fortune; the accidental cause
of his entering the wide field of theolo∣gical
controversy. He paid his rent by
writing against his landlord, and formed
the gradual, and now mature, establish∣ment
of two seminaries of fanaticism; two
little theatres of which the receipts are
considerable, and in himself unites the
characters of manager, actor, and author.</P>
<P>“I can observe no difference” said
Charles, when Johnson concluded this nar∣rative
“between the fanaticism of Ignorance
and the fanatacism of Philosophy. Every
philosophical leader is a kind of Hunting∣ton;
and every new system seems to ter∣minate
in something like a conventicle.
But WHERE, my friend, ARE THE HO∣NEST
MEN?”</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="173"/>
To which Johnson replied—“Honest
men, Charles, are not gregarious. Ob∣serve
a crowd; the favourite orator is
rarely an honest man; he is only the or∣gan
of a party, while the honest men, who
are too often silent, are generally consi∣dered
by each party, as so many impedi∣ments
in their way to get closer to the
orator; and in the attempt these parties
make to unite themselves with him, the
honest men are pushed aside, or trampled
on, as the mercy or the ingratitude of the
multitude wills; exiled like ARISTIDES,
or torn to pieces like DE WITT.</P>

Man.</HEAD>
<P>THE unfortunate female, whom Charles
had relieved with a bounty, that pro∣ceeded
more from the benevolence of his
heart, than the decision of his judgment,
(for still prejudice whispered in his ear the
hateful distinction of prostitute) having
been desired by Charles to disclose her
history, delivered herself in the following
plain narrative.</P>
<P>My history is a description of the me∣lancholy
effects of three great professions.
My late husband Mr. Wilson, at the age
of forty, obtained by the favour of an
old lady, a small estate near Bridgewater.
<PB N="152" REF="175"/>
His life had passed in persevering obse∣quiousness
and anxious attention, to the
wants and desires of this aged matron.
Troy did not undergo a siege more re∣gular,
and more procrastinated, than this
estate. He won her affections by passing
long evenings in conversation or in silence;
in never breaking the repose of her easy
naps, while she admired the careful silence
of his footsteps, and his curious felicity
in stirring the fire, without striking on the
bars of the grate. He assisted in making
embrocations, emplasters, and emollients;
distilling elder flowers, compounding diet-drinks,
and once relieved the feebleness
of her sight, by a fortunate application
of euphrasia or eyebright. Every morn∣ing
he made enquiry, if her cough had
much tickled in the night. His industry
was at length rewarded, for she coughed
no more.</P>
<P>His character, which was gentleness,
<PB N="153" REF="176"/>
devoid of hypocrisy, by such means was
well adapted to obtain an estate, but
these were ill suited to preserve it. The
habits of obsequiousness and assent to
every opinion he heard, enervated his fa∣culties;
too timorous to contradict, too
indolent to act, too indecisive to discover
the characters of men, he now found
himself surrounded by beings more per∣plexing,
and less placable than the old
lady, to whose sole quiet he had devoted
his inoffensive days. Her caprices had
given him an agreeable employment, her
satisfaction was his highest happiness, and
the old elbow-chair of his venerable as∣sociate
long reminded him of pleasures
that had past, when he sat opposite, and
gazed around with a heart full and sa∣tisfied.</P>
<P>He now experienced a domestic va∣cuity,
intolerable to a person who could
not soften the miseries of inaction, by
<PB N="154" REF="177"/>
those various pursuits which adorn and
exhilarate our existence. My father
was a curate, who lived with extreme
difficulty; and when Mr. Wilson was
desirous of supplying the place of his
ancient companion, he applied to my
father. It was a connexion above our
hopes; the dissimilarity of our age,
could form no obstacle to the humility
of my desires; and I willingly resigned
my person to a man of inoffensive dispo∣sitions,
who I well knew never to have
made an enemy.</P>
<P>We had scarcely been happy a few
months, when, to our mutual surprise,
we perceived that Mr. Wilson had one,
as implacable as he was formidable.
Esquire Bustle had just arrived from
London to reside on his estate, and it
was soon discovered that he was jealous
to excess of his manerial rights. He
had a cousin in London, an attorney,
<PB N="155" REF="178"/>
who had drawn up his will; and as a
mark of his gratitude for what that will
contained, and to ensure its permanency,
he had offered his gratuitous services to
the Esquire, for the protection of his
property; nor was this an inconsiderable
present, or an idle tender; for Bustle
was known never to retire with pleasure
to rest, unless the day had produced
some cause which might be brought on
at the next term. The costly price of
law we bewail in this country, as a great
grievance; indeed, it seems only in the
reach of very rich men; but I have some∣times
thought, that it is perhaps not an
evil of the magnitude it appears; for
since law is thus costly, all dread a suit,
few are forward to commence one, and
seize on any friendly accommodation.
If law were very cheap, there are many
noxious beings who would disturb the
quiet of a neighbourhood by incessant
<PB N="156" REF="179"/>
attacks, formed on pretences, which,
were they false, would still remain to be
discussed. I believe some men would
pass their days in court. The character
of Bustle has taught me these reflections.
As soon as he had adjusted matters with
his cousin, to have all his law affairs▪ ma∣naged
gratuitously, he had nothing more
to do than to indulge in the luxury of
discovering occasions to employ the ut∣most
industry of his attorney. Directly
on his arrival on his estate, he walked
over his grounds, cautiously attended by
his bailiff, who always accompanied him,
that he might be ready as a necessary
witness in law. In his first peregrination,
he returned home happy, for he was in a
rage.</P>
<P>One of our fields was only divided by
a slight quickset hedge, from part of the
grounds of the Esquire; there was, in∣deed,
a dry ditch scarce perceiveable, and
<PB N="157" REF="180"/>
in which grew a crab-apple tree, placed
in all appearance in our field. It shaded
and reclined over our ground, and, from
time immemorial, the property of these
crab-apples had been considered to ap∣pertain
to the deceased old lady. One of
our servants was cutting a crab-stick,
when Esquire Bustle passed. He stopt,
whispered the bailiff, and both imme∣diately
measured the hedge, and groped
in the ditch. Bustle at length turned to
the bailiff, desired him to listen, and re∣mark
every thing that should happen,
without any interference. “My lad,”
said he, “how dare you pillage that crab-tree?”
The servant, who already knew
Bustle's character, was now well pleased
(as such persons are) in irritating the liti∣gious
Lord of the Manor, and asserted
his master's right to the crab-apples. The
Esquire was still employed in the ditch,
when, suddenly starting, he exclaimed,
<PB N="158" REF="181"/>
“Simple larceny, by G—! transporta∣tion!
whipping!” So saying, he gravely
announced to the bailiff, that he was go∣ing
to take possession of the crab-tree,
which he began by plucking the fruit.
The servant opposed, and retook the ap∣ples
by violence. “That's an action of
battery; mark bailiff!” continued the
Esquire. “Tell me, sirrah, have your
master and you ever taken conjointly,
and in the night, these crabs?”—“Yes,
sure, as well as in the day”—“Compound
larceny! aiding and abetting by G—!
Acquaint your master, that he and you
have been both guilty of felonious taking
and carrying away these my crabs. I'll
have law, by the statute 6 of Geo. III. c.
36. The case is a glorious case; it con∣tains
a dozen in one. First, the side of
this hedge is much damaged by that
fellow's clambering for crab-sticks; se∣condly,
you are an aider and abettor by
<PB N="159" REF="182"/>
your own confession; thirdly, your mas∣ter
has been observed taking these crabs,
which is simple larceny; fourthly, you
have violently assaulted me, which
thievery and battery make compound
larceny; fifthly, you have not only taken
but carried away, and had they only been
carried to the end of the field, and left
there, it is a sufficient <HI>asportation</HI>—that's
the word. Tell your master I was born
in a land of law and freedom; law is the
privilege of a Briton; I can go to law
with the king. Hark ye! he may not
understand, unless you tell him that this
same crab-tree has got the best part of
<HI>it's roots</HI> in my ground; and, therefore,
nature has made it my property; and I
promise he and you shall taste something
much sourer than the aforesaid crabs;
statute 6 Geo. III.”</P>
<P>When the servant returned, and report∣ed
this affair, poor Wilson, well knowing
<PB N="160" REF="183"/>
the dispositions of Esquire Bustle, im∣mediately
sent the following note, written
in great simplicity of heart, and without
a suspicion of malice in the terms.</P>
<P>“Mr. Wilson presents his best respects
to Mr. Bustle, and very sincerely apolo∣gises
for the ignorance of his servant.
He assures him, that any number of the
crab-apples, and the crab-sticks, shall
be reserved for his use.”</P>
<P>This note was ill adapted to soothe the
irritated litigant, who vociferated for
law! He observed, that this mode of com∣promise
would be as dangerous as com∣pounding
felony. I have to answer, said
he, to my posterity for these crabs; and
they shall not suffer from my negligence.
Wilson would compound merely for a life∣term,
but this would not be binding on
his heirs, executors, and assigns. The
<PB N="161" REF="184"/>
crab-tree shall be decided on by a British
jury. 'Tis a nice case, a most glorious
uncertainty! The roots are equally spread
on both grounds, but being rather more
in mine, it becomes my <HI>natural</HI> property;
if I find the necessary documents to prove
my grandfather, as I suspect to have been
the planter, it is mine by <HI>inheritance.</HI> And
then the battery, the larceny, the fe∣lony;
for a crab, I affirm, is a fruit-tree.
He secretly exulted, that in pursuing this
complex indictment from court to court,
the agreement of his cousin, the attorney,
protected him from the ruin that even∣tually
must fall on his adversary, whether
he gained or lost his cause.</P>
<P>Had the entire estate of the Esquire
depended on the property of this crab-tree,
his attentions could not have been more
indefatigable, nor his preparations more
formidable. I cannot, Sir, instruct you
correctly respecting the whole legal process.
<PB N="162" REF="185"/>
How it came at length into the higher
courts, I know not; but outrages were
described in so solemn and terrifying a
manner, that Mr. Wilson appeared the
chief of a banditti, instead of the most in∣offensive
inhabitant of a little village;
while our servant was divided into as
many assailants, as those who increased at
every fresh recital of the fat knight. I
was informed, that in the court of chan∣cery,
where it was contrived to carry this
suit, it is necessary to fill voluminous
skins of parchment with the grossest fic∣tions,
and the most unintelligible jargon.
Every new plea or petition, brought some
new exaggeration. Our ducks were
found in his ponds, a horse leaped over
his pailing, and he calculated, with pre∣cision,
the loss he had incurred by our
cattle browsing a hedge for several suc∣cessive
years. There was cause upon
cause, writs of error from the common
<PB N="163" REF="186"/>
law side, and what began in the court
of King's Bench, where we gained our
suit, was, with a writ of error to reverse
judgment, placed by the industrious in∣genuity
of Bustle's cousin, the attorney,
in that court of appeal, called the court
of Exchequer Chamber, where I think it
did not long rest; but has lain for many
years in the court of Equity.</P>
<P>“Meanwhile, all this was carried on at
an enormous expence on the side of poor
Wilson. It was now his pleasure, and
the only malice his gentle dispositions were
capable of fermenting to, when he ob∣served
the lion and his jackal, the Esquire
and the bailiff, to stand under this crab-tree,
and pluck the apples, while the ser∣vant
would clamber to cut a crab-stick,
which he flourished in open defiance of
the Esquire; but all this innocent re∣venge,
served only to supply with new
matter the romantic incidents of that
<PB N="164" REF="187"/>
great novelist, the Esquire's cousin and
lawyer. I recollect one good-natured
expression of Wilson, that since this crab-tree
had produced a suit in chancery, it
was more than probable, that he should
at least enjoy it's sour produce during his
life.</P>
<P>The Law expences threatened to be
ruinous, and poor Wilson's spirits sunk
at every new bill of his lawyer. A ner∣vous
fever took place. The apothecary of
our village was a warm advocate for Dr.
Buchan's “Domestic Medicine,” a work,
he assured us, most necessary for all
families; but as the prescriptions cannot
be correct, since that requires a personal
knowledge of the patient, he referred us
to himself for that portion of the medical
character. Wilson devoutly applied to
this compilement of human maladies.
But from this slow fever on the spirits,
occasioned by the long suit in chancery,
<PB N="165" REF="188"/>
he never recovered, and to Dr. Buchan
he was indebted, for a catalogue of hu∣man
diseases of the most opposite nature.
Sometimes he feared to die of a suffoca∣tion,
occasioned by a plethoric habit;
then of the slow and certain wheezings
of the asthma; now of the commotions
of an indigestion; he had now the yellow
jaundice, and now. Saint Anthony's fire.
He turned his apartment into a repository
of medical apparatus. Fleecy hosiery,
and blue flannel nine times faithfully
dyed; dumb bells and chamber horses;
flesh brushes and shower baths; nervous
draughts and fever powders; a species of
morbid luxury presented itself around,
and the unhappy patient sat with a ther∣mometer
in his hand!</P>
<P>If I seemed to think, Sir, that the exor∣bitant
costs of the Law are so far benefi∣cial,
that they hinder many a disputant to
resort incautiously to it's tribunals, so I
<PB N="166" REF="189"/>
equally lament, that the shop of the apo∣thecary
is not as extravagant as the court
of chancery. In one respect it bears a
resemblance; in the length of time the
patient, in either case, remains in the
hands of those to whom he resorted
for relief. We pay, in both instances,
for an immoderate number of neutral
draughts.</P>
<P>It was in this feeble and unnerved state,
that I used to sit by poor Wilson, while
he was adjusting the scrolls of his attor∣ney,
which looked like the volumes of
the ancients, which, when unrolled, extend
to an immense space. He never quitted
them but with a sigh, that expressively
told the state of the heart from which it
sprung; it was like a hollow voice, that
breathed it's melancholy tones amidst a
scene of ruins. I turned my eyes from
the unoffending victim of law and physic,
and when he caught a tear wandering on
<PB N="167" REF="190"/>
my cheek, I assured him that it was not
so much occasioned by the chancellor, as
by Dr. Buchan, whose volume I had
reason to suspect, was more pernicious
than the writs of error issued by Esquire
Bustle.</P>
<P>Law and physic were not the only evils
this inoffensive man had to encounter;
divinity came to disorder the seat of rea∣son.
Bustle had ejected (I think that is
the legal term) a certain Antinomian
preacher from his newly erected meeting,
for a nuisance of neighbourhood; first, as
a <HI>common nuisance,</HI> for keeping a disorderly
house; to which, it seems, his saints had
converted his private dwelling-house; and
secondly, as <HI>a private nuisance,</HI> because
this meeting blinded an <HI>ancient window</HI>
of an ancient tenement of the Esquire's;
but, Sir, if the window had not been <HI>an∣cient,</HI>
that is, if it had not subsisted
there a long time without interruption,
<PB N="168" REF="191"/>
an action, our lawyer said, could not have
been laid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Blackstone, vol. iii. p. 217.</NOTE> Such is the tenuity of legal
distinctions! But the wife of the An∣tinomian
experienced from the <HI>law</HI> of
Bustle, the legal misfortunes peculiar to
our sex. He indicted her first, as an
eaves-dropper, for listening under walls
and windows; secondly, as a common
scold, or, as I recollect the term, <HI>communis
vixatrix;</HI> a law latin expression, which,
the attorney informed me, was confined
to the feminine gender<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. iv. p. 167.</NOTE>, and which,
permit me to observe, is a glaring injus∣tice
to our sex; for <HI>common scolds</HI> may,
I presume, be found more frequently
among certain persons of the masculine
gender, and such characters as Bustle,
are assuredly a species of this genus.</P>
<P>A common fate had introduced this
Antinomian into our house, and the plea∣sure
<PB N="169" REF="192"/>
of venting our reciprocal sorrows
had made him more intimate than I
desired. It was not long before I per∣ceived,
that the feeble and wounded in∣tellect
of Wilson was unresistingly acces∣sible
to the purposes of this fanatic. His
conversations afforded him an intense de∣light,
and a continued perusal of contro∣versial
points in theology absorbed his
attention from every domestic concern.
He passed laborious days, and sleepless
nights in explaining the consubstantiality
of the Son with the Father; the distinction
between grace and justification; and was
overjoyed to hear that Bustle avowedly
ridiculed the Athanasian creed, for which
he was positive he would feel the eternity
of hell torments. I must not now dis∣guise
to you, that Mr. Wilson lost all his
humanity, and while his head wandered▪
among the speculative and incomprehen∣sible
points of theology, his heart nou∣rished
<PB N="170" REF="193"/>
an implacable hatred to, and a thir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
of vengeance on all persons who differed
from his extravagant opinions. His lit∣tle
charities were now confined to a few
wretched beings, who, in the daily viola∣tion
of every moral duty, disserted by the
hour on the efficacy of grace, and the sal∣vation
of faith. Wilson, by a conversation
with the Antinomian, was at length made
to believe, that he was in a state of damna∣tion;
because of some controversial points,
which he unwarily owned he could not
believe, because he could not understand.</P>
<P>“What shall I shall do to save my pre∣cious
soul?” enquired Wilson. “Defend
me, (said the man of grace) from the at∣tacks
of the great Arian”—Esquire Blus∣ter.
If the Antinomian had commanded
him to throw himself into the burning
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ava of Vesuvius, he would not have he∣sitated;
he, however, now only threw
himself once more into chancery. We
<PB N="171" REF="194"/>
soon found it necessary to sell our little
estate, which was bought by our attor∣ney.
Wilson never recovered from the
terrible state in which religion had placed
his mind. He sat whole days in melan∣choly
silence, occasionally ejaculating, “ah
my precious soul!—the Lamb!
—The gates of hell open, and lo! there
is gnashing of teeth, wailing, and fires
that burn, but consume not.” We at
length had scarcely money enough left
to convey my unhappy husband to Lon∣don,
for the advice of Dr. Monro. He
expired shortly afterwards, in a fever of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nacy and religion, execrating his sinful
existence, and regarding myself and his
children with abhorrence. Alas, Sir! this
was more cruel to suffer, than our preced∣ing
misfortunes; the inoffensive and kind
Wilson had been an indulgent husband.
and an affectionate parent. I was left in this
vast metropolis unfriended and unknown. I
had now no relative on earth. I wanted even
<PB N="172" REF="195"/>
those common friendships which might
afford me labour. I live on the wages of
prostitution; but I live for my children!</P>
<P>It was thus, that <HI>law</HI> ruined the estate,
<HI>physic</HI> the constitution, and <HI>divinity</HI> the
understanding of the gentlest and most
unoffending of men!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Conversation in her Ladyship's Picture∣room.
Fashionable Sentiments on Friend∣ship,
Solitude, and Love.</HEAD>
<P>LADY Belfield had not viewed Charles
with indifference; a female of her
discernment does not live long with a
handsome young man without discover∣ing
all his good qualities; and Charles
had that honest simplicity, which render∣ed
him unaffectedly ignorant of any sin∣gle
one he might possess. The <HI>mauvaise
honte,</HI> so much reprobated by the polite
part of the human species, was never yet
repugnant to the sensations of the sex.
We do not presume to understand the
philosophy of the female mind; but
<PB N="174" REF="197"/>
possibly a woman cherishes every hope,
when she discovers in a man a heart in
it's virgin state.</P>
<P>Lady Belfield now took a pleasure in
gently separating the natural incrustation
that covered the precious ore; experience
had given dexterity to her art; but there
is sometimes a rough and immalleable
armour, by which nature protects herself
from the polished instruments of the
finishing artist. Charles, however, was
constantly invited to her parties, employ∣ed
as her secretary, and consulted as an
arbiter, in the varied circle of her elegant
recreations. Charles was really very po∣lite;
but then it was only the politeness
of nature; a disposition to be pleased,
and to communicate pleasure; and with∣out
being sensible of it, he was one of
the most persevering flatterers; he was
ever discovering the fairest sides of every
character.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="198"/>
To Lady Belfield nature had been
liberal of those felicitous dispositions
which seize with ardour and facility
whatever is addressed to the taste or the
imagination. Her talents had been as
much improved as the volatile routine
of a town life could admit. Her quick
sensibility acted like instinct; it preceded
the judgment, yet rarely differed from
it's slower decision. Her paintings ex∣hibited
many careless inventive touches,
which, in the labours of an artist of ge∣nius,
had been amplified, heightened,
and aided with all the potency of the
art; to such she resigned the glory,
while she was satisfied with the pleasure.
Her music was distinguished by a rapid
and brilliant touch, but nice connoisseurs
affirmed, that she often marred the cor∣rectness
of the tune. Her voice seemed
the modulation of her heart, but par∣took
of all it's caprices; it gave a fugi∣tive
<PB N="176" REF="199"/>
and inconstant sweetness, which
scarcely charmed ere it was lost. Her
imagination would have been of the
higher order, but, confined to the com∣mon
fictions of common writers swallow∣like,
it only skimmed over the fluent
surface of sentiment; and her repartee,
formed merely by the vapid dialogue of a
modern theatre, could never rise above
that tenuity of wit, which, in it's most
solid state, is but an easy sprightliness.</P>
<P>It was the misfortune of this lady, that
in the present day, to excel in those ac∣complishments
which dignify or adorn,
or to respect the decencies of the do∣mestic
character, are not considered as
fashionable acquisitions. It is very cer∣tain,
that in the higher circles of society,
a league has been formed by all the
dunces of either sex, to ridicule or to de∣plore
the talents of their more ingenious
acquaintances. Shall a person of fashion
<PB N="177" REF="200"/>
(they say) excel in music, which is only
the profession of a composer; or in poe∣try,
with which the shops are far from
being unprovided; or in painting, when
employed or unemployed artists have
their respective prices? The dignity of
rank, they are so fearful to violate by
efforts of this kind, is a prejudice of con∣siderable
injury to their personal charac∣ter;
what they may want in the stimulus
which poverty or dependance affords to
men of genius, is amply compensated
by their leisure and their taste. These re∣sources
are closing rapidly on the fashiona∣ble
circles; and it may be prognosticated,
that the most elevated in rank in this
country will be the most barbarous, the
most unintelligent, and the most insigni∣ficant
of the nation. A false refinement
and a gothic barbarity differ in their ap∣pearance,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot in their reality.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="201"/>
Nature in Lady Belfield was, however,
something stronger than fashion. She
excelled her companions, but she blushed
at her excellence. To conceal any dis∣tinguishing
talent of our own is the great
requisite of politeness; so that those who
have no talents at all, have the fairest
chance to be deemed the most polite.
Professional men, who feel an ambition to
mix with the most polished circle, first
divest themselves of the curious know∣ledge
their laborious life has collected,
and when once they are reduced to
idiotism, are then the humble com∣panions
for idiots; for let men of talents
do whatever they can, an idiot will ever
excel them in his own natural faculty.</P>
<P>This lady most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edulously studied to
have no character at all; but Nature main∣tained
her rights, for to a sensitive heart
she had given an ear and an eye, which
refused the constraints their owner put
<PB N="179" REF="202"/>
on them. She essayed with great inge∣nuity
to annihilate her faculties; but in∣voluntarily
she rose from the dead flat∣ness
of fashionable uniformity. Some
unlucky circumstance ever happened
that provoked her sensibility; some fea∣ture
of nature to seize, some harmony to
combine, some effort of taste to relieve
the activity of her rapid sensations. In
vain she whirled round the vortex of
frivolity, in vain she indulged a laxity of
morals; nature kept firm hold of her
heart, and it cost her more pains to be
capricious and dissolute, than to have
been sensible and virtuous.</P>
<P>One morning Charles was attending
her Ladyship in the painting room. The
subject that was then placed on her easel
was an historical piece of Damon and Py∣thias.
At a great distance was Damon seen
plunging his spurs in his horse, throwing
his body impatiently forwards, while his
<PB N="180" REF="203"/>
eye seemed already to have reached the
scaffold. “This same Damon (said her
Ladyship) occasions me as much anxiety
as if I were Pythias. Don't you think
that shade is too strong, while the horse is
too light; so that the rider seems to be
quite near the scaffold, while his horse is
at an immense distance.”</P>
<P>“Your Ladyship (replied Charles) is
the severest critic on your own paintings.
Permit me to admire the gesture and
animation of that figure of Damon. It
is eloquent to the eye; it seems to say, a
minute is fatal! That person, placed at
the most distant part of the crowd, ap∣pears
to communicate his intelligence to
those who are near, while your Ladyship
has given an evidence of fine taste, in
breaking those masses, and distributing the
light among the body of the people, who
seem in a sudden tumult, as if they were
catching a report, which has not yet
<PB N="181" REF="204"/>
reached the spectators who surround Py∣thias
and the tyrant. That interesting
subject, that delightful story of my pue∣rile
days, I cannot see without it's re∣minding
me with a sigh of the friendships
of this age!”</P>
<P>“My dear little fool, you always re∣mind
me of Esop's Fables; I suppose you
can never look at a dog or a cat, but
you must end with some stupid moral,
and some intolerable reflection. What is
this story of Damon and Pythias, but
one gentleman giving bail for another?
and what man of honour would now run
away from his bail? 'Tis a most pedantic
observation you have thrown out on
friendship. I am sure there is no diffi∣culty
in finding friends; one is really
pestered with them. So many morning
calls is a hard tax to pay for the ac∣quaintance
of persons whose names are
better known than their faces. A lady
<PB N="182" REF="205"/>
of fashion has just written an essay on
“The Triumph of Acquaintance over
Friendship.” She has saved her reputation
by not prefixing her name; for <HI>entre
nous soit dit,</HI> she must be a most stupid
being to have fatigued herself with writ∣ing,
I assure you, near a hundred pages.
However, since the thing is done, I would
advise you to bind it with your Chester∣field.”</P>
<P>“Will your Ladyship pardon me if I
confess, that I can never prefer the interests
(since every action of our life is said to be
governed by this principle) derived from
an universal acquaintance, to those which
arise from an individual sympathy. I
prefer the latter, as I would prefer the
ease and seclusion of a little cottage of
my own to the liberty of residing at St.
James's, where I might command all, by
being commanded by all.”</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="206"/>
“I have told you, Charles, that similies
take too much time to understand, par∣ticularly
when they are quite unlike the
thing they are compared to. One idea
at a time if you please; that is fatigue
enough. When shall I see you so accom∣plished,
as to converse without any ideas
at all? Your cottage reminds me of that
picture. Reach it. Ther, is a scene of
retirement! I shall darken this grove,
roughen these rocks, and put my two
lovers a little more in the shade, which is
quite necessary; for it is by concealing,
that we exhibit objects to the imagina∣tion.”</P>
<P>“Your Ladyship, I see, cannot help con∣versing
without ideas. It is indeed a ro∣mantic
solitude; what a calm tranquillity
to the fancy.”</P>
<P>“Again; what solitude a tranquil∣lity!
It is a torment. You rural phi∣losophers
never read fairy tales written
<PB N="184" REF="207"/>
by a French Countess, who had a great
deal of wit, when wit was in fashion.
I must tell you one of her pretty inven∣tions,
called the Palace of Vengeance.
You doubtless imagine from the title,
that it is some
<Q><L>—“Relentless power,</L>
<L>Whose iron scourge and torturing pow'r”</L></Q>
are felt in the terrific abode of the furies.
My dear fool, it is a vernal paradise, the
eglantine bowers of the Graces, the rose
and myrtle beds of enchanting loves. The
presiding genius, jealous of the happiness
of two lovers, places them in this magical
spot. They enter with the feathered feet
of rapture. O amiable solitude, delici∣ous
silence, and friendly shade!—The
genius was certainly a man of the town,
one experienced in the promenade of
Bond-street. His project could not fail.
The eternal iteration of the same atten∣tions
<PB N="185" REF="208"/>
and the same ideas communicated
a langour to their raptures, a bluntness to
the fine point of enjoyment. In a word,
our two lovers finished by a frank and
reciprocal confession, that they had long
viewed each other, first with indifference,
and now with considerable pain. A Pa∣radise
was the Palace of Vengeance! So
much for solitude! I am as much ter∣rified
at the sight of a tree as I should
be to see a dead man. The pleasures of
solitude entirely consist in sleeping with∣out
being disturbed.”</P>
<P>“And yet your Ladyship has painted
landscape with a taste, and selection of
objects, that demonstrate the pleasure
you must have taken in tracing the finest
aspects of nature.”</P>
<P>“I have, Charles, given more attention
to these trifles than becomes me. 'Tis
my folly; I never can pass my easel with∣out
a touch; I will paint no more, for I
paint too well; it seems with me more
<PB N="186" REF="209"/>
a study than an amusement. What do
you think of these historical pieces?”</P>
<P>“That Lucretia charms me. Brutus
raises the dagger to the gods, and seems
to view on it's ensanguined point the sal∣vation
and the vengeance of Rome.”</P>
<P>“Pooh! I will throw that Lucretia out
of my collection. It is a libel on the sex.
Besides, I am told not a word of it is true.
But look, my dear boy, (continued Lady
Belfield, rising) at that portrait of the
lovely Scottish queen, and that Cleopatra,
who yet glowing from the embraces of
Anthony, exhibits all the luxuriousness of
her person, the artifice of her dress, the
inebriation of that studied scene, where
she throws herself before the insensible
Augustus. There is a similarity in the
fate of these unfortunate women. Cleo∣patra
was betrothed to Pompey, enjoyed
Caesar, yet only triumphed in her An∣thony.
Mary, betrothed to Francis, en∣joyed
<PB N="187" REF="210"/>
Darnley, yet only triumphed in her
Bothwell. These are the ornaments of
our sex, models of voluptuous freedom
without vulgar licentiousness; passion
without rage, enjoyment without satiety.
They shook all the roses of love without
dropping the freshest dews. Their plea∣sures
were those of versatile desire.”</P>
<P>Now it is needful to inform the reader,
that since her Ladyship had risen from
her seat, and while she was occupied in
disserting on Mary and on Cleopatra, she
rolled on Charles two orbs of beauty so
lively and tender, that neither those of
Mary nor Cleopatra could have told more
intelligently the secrets of a bosom that
had gradually quitted it's gauze.</P>
<P>But Charles knew nothing of all this.
He was looking at the picture. Her
Ladyship was reduced to the necessity of
leaning her arm upon his shoulder; her
mouth was approaching his cheek. The
<PB N="188" REF="211"/>
sensation of a white and firm arm awaken∣ed
Charles; her attitude embarrassed;
his eye caught the inclination of her lips;
a fine suffusion mantled his animated
face. How long it takes to write what
scarce employed a single moment!</P>
<P>With the half-glance, by which he had
caught her Ladyship's attitude, a gentle
tremor thrilled in his heart; he was sur∣prised;
he was timorous; he was indeed
virtuous; he did not, therefore, incline his
cheek to her, nor suddenly left her Ladyship
unsupported; he only turned his face away,
which answered precisely the same thing
as if he had boldly turned his face to
her; for his blooming cheek came in
contact with the warm mouth of Lady
Belfield; she impressed the first criminal
kiss on a guiltless and blushing cheek.—“You
fool, (she said) I have been talking
an hour in vain!”</P>
<P>As her Ladyship was speaking, Lord
Belfield entered, and observing her
<PB N="189" REF="212"/>
Ladyship adjusting her neck-kerchief, and
Charles silent and confused, apologised
for his sudden entrance. “My Lord,
(replied Lady Belfield, with perfect com∣posure),
our philosopher has an inveterate
rusticity. I have attacked him covert∣ly,
at a distance, by insinuation, by
persuasion, and I at length was obliged
to make an open assault. The boy
blushes, but were it not for this blush I
should think he had no more sensation
than the great Apollo in the hall.”</P>
<P>“Your Ladyship, (his Lordship replied)
does him infinite honour; but a rougher
human colt never received a town snaffle.
He is no cuckow; he will lay no eggs in
the nests of others. I offered to intro∣duce
him to the nymph of the Seine, and
acquainted him with your Ladyship's
wager with the Marchioness; but he
looked and talked as sermonically as
Kenyon. By the bye, poor Sir Francis is
<PB N="190" REF="213"/>
obliged to pay ten thousand pounds for
meeting Lady Betty at the Star and
Garter. That Kenyon has a mill-stone
for his heart; he is as cold, yet as fiery,
as a flint from his own shire, and as of∣fensive
to society as the smell of one of his
own overgrown leeks. Will your Lady∣ship
credit, that he threatens <HI>us,</HI> if indict∣ed
on the gaming act, with his pillory?
What a vulgar fellow! There is the
Countess of Cog and Mrs. Arch in the
greatest consternation; they are as black
and as red as their own tables of rouge et
noir. But this Welch judge always puts
one out of one's way. I came to an∣nounce
to your Ladyship, that I must
have the honour of introducing Monsieur
Vaurien; the gentleman recommended
to me by the late Duke De Liancourt,
who has suddenly disappeared, and his
friends have not the satisfaction of know∣ing
whether he has been guillotined, or
<PB N="191" REF="214"/>
only massacred. Vaurien has been with
me this morning. Ah! the accomplish∣ed
man! When he has learnt the English
language, Charles, he will become your
rival and your model. I recommend him
strongly to your attentions. Take the
impression of his polish and his figure;
stick to him then like warm sealing-wax.”</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Dissertation on the Marvellous in Novel
Writing. Monsieur Vaurien's first Ap∣pearance
on this Stage.</HEAD>
<P>AS Monsieur Vaurien is a character of
the first importance in this our
veritable history, and as we are solicitous
of affording our readers the self-flattering
pleasure of discovering the character in
the events, we are inclined to resist our
own gratification, in this opportunity of
attempting to adorn our narrative with the
pointed sentences of a Tacitus, and the
embellished periods of a Sallust.</P>
<P>Domestic historians, like ourselves, of
late have duped their readers with the
MARVELLOUS. The bulk of readers,
<PB N="193" REF="216"/>
the only kind to which we moderns de∣vote
our lucubrations, seem now much
more pleased to be frightened out of their
wits, than to be assisted in making a pro∣per
use of them. It is much easier to
excite our wonder, than to satisfy our
judgment. Skeletons slowly pacing, ra∣pidly
coursing, or quietly coffined, are
not of difficult invention. We cannot
esteem works, which employing human
characters, exhibit not even a side-glance
at poor forsaken nature; describe emo∣tions
which as none have felt, none can
decide on their propriety; and he who
writes of ghosts, should write to ghosts,
but he who writes of man, addresses him∣self
to his fellow citizens. Histories of
man, if ill written, are undeservedly called
<HI>novels,</HI> and well written, are unjustly
termed <HI>fictions.</HI></P>
<P>But if it is agreed, that to intermix
such obsolete scenery with existing man∣ners,
<PB N="194" REF="217"/>
is no dereliction of an author's taste,
and no impudent insult on a reader's
judgment, we most humbly offer, a pro∣ject
for the new machinery of a modern
novel. A certain foreign writer, not
quite unknown for the length of his pro∣boscis,
and no small savourite of the
ladies of his day, did publish a collection
of the marvellous, in a very entertaining
and diversified romance, entitled The
Metamorphosis. We, therefore, modestly
submit whether it would evince inferior
invention, or more violate the truth of
nature, than some fashionable volumes
avowedly do, if we were to introduce
the thievish Mercury among the com∣mon
council; Apollo, as the scanda∣lous
paragrapher of a morning paper;
and alarm a crippled, senile, swarthy
nabob for the purity of his Venus, by the
appearance of Mars in Bond-street. Are
<PB N="195" REF="218"/>
not the gods and goddesses as interesting
as those stalking personages, who have
only made a short excursion from Sur∣geon's-hall?
The descriptive views before
the denouement are sufficiently fanciful,
yet the sudden tremors, with which some
pale and amiable young ladies are affected,
are not only unsufferably distressing, but
always remind us of “The Magical Mir∣ror,”
exhibited not long ago, in this
place of exhibition, London; where,
after viewing the charming delusion of
grapes swelling into a blooming ma∣turity,
or faces angelically smiling, sud∣denly
there appeared a most hideous
skeleton's scull, distending it's terrific
jaws. This denouement, like that of the
Grecian tragic bard's, did occasion a few
miscarriages; but <HI>this exhibitor</HI> of <HI>skeletons
heads,</HI> after having been <HI>properly</HI> persuad∣ed
of it's great impropriety, withdrew his
<PB N="196" REF="219"/>
gorgonic finale. He supplied it by the
figure of a <HI>bird,</HI> which formed but an un∣affecting
close. We must neither be ex∣travagant
nor insipid. We most submis∣sively
offer this hint to certain exhibi∣tors
of skeletons in print.</P>
<P>Of our miraculous writers, there have
been a few, who have so far felt a re∣verence
for venerable nature, as modestly
to explain preternatural appearances, by
natural causes; and assuredly their inge∣nuity
deserves commendation, while their
torture excites compassion. But tales,
constructed even with this curious possi∣bility,
are read like epigrams; merely to
see how they will end; and like epigrams,
the surprise they are so solicitous to raise,
can be raised no more. We return in
vain to such productions, for those im∣pressive
truths, which germinate in the
heart, while fancy can only scatter pe∣rishable
<PB N="197" REF="220"/>
blossoms. Nothing is so beau∣tiful
as truth, yet, what is extraordinary,
nothing is so durable.</P>
<P>From Germany, has been imported
this grotosque taste; heavy Germany!
The gentlemen of the diplomatic corps,
have laboured to reach that degree in the
scale of taste, which <HI>we have passed;</HI> and
we doubt whether there is more of civi∣lity
or barbarism, by a retrograde motion,
to bring ourselves down to them. We
have some poor English students, who
are devoutly applying, with all their gut∣tural
faculty, to heighten our amenity,
by redundant German consonants, and to
brighten our wit, by clumsy German
graces. We must persist in preferring,
even to Wicland's “numerous prose,”
and Haller's and Klopstock's verse “dragging
it's slow length,” their pandects and
their digests; but more particularly a
certain manual performance, gloriously
<PB N="198" REF="221"/>
entitled, “The Theatre of Europe,”
which containing the history of twenty
years, has only yet reached to thirty-five
volumes in folio. We write thirty-five
in words, as Robertson does his dates, to
prevent errors. A profound German ex∣claims,
with a national exultation, that he
finds every thing in these works—every
thing, we imagine, but taste to select, and
penetration to comprehend.</P>
<P>Should it therefore happen that all
ghosts are exorcised from our future his∣tories
of man, which may be the case
before the close of <HI>this</HI> century, we con∣sole
our noble brethren with an assurance
that there will remain enough of THE
MARVELLOUS in NATURE, provided
that they will only convert to it's proper
use, the EYE, which in our opinion to a
real novelist, a mere collector of human
facts, is worth that magic wand, or any
other species of necromantic art, which
<PB N="199" REF="222"/>
they are now compelled to employ to
open the doors of others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Monk, the devil supplies Ambrosius with a magical myrtle for this purpose. That work seems to have been planned by a boy, and written by a man.</NOTE>. If, however,
a novelist will make no other use of his
eye, than to wear it's delicate vision away
on the books of others, or his own, reso∣lutely
if he refuses to
<Q>“EYE NATURE'S WALKS,”</Q>
he must then exhibit a view of manners
as they are observed in charnel houses,
and instead of the gods we recommend,
he must adopt this amended verse of a
poetical lunatic,
<Q><L>“Ghosts shall meet ghosts, and jostle in the dark.”</L>
<L>NAT. LEE.</L></Q></P>
<P>But shall not <HI>we</HI> in our turn be cen∣sured?
our windows we acknowledge are
but made of glass, and may be demolish∣ed
by the pebbles thrown by raw boys,
<PB N="200" REF="223"/>
as well as by the cannonading of graver
critics. We would exhibit a <HI>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isimili∣tude</HI>
of nature, yet do we not conceive
that this is incompatible with the <HI>marvel∣lous.</HI>
A judicial critic, a solemn judge
of his own private election, who has never
been seated at the cabinet councils of
nature, will regard some of our truths, as
fictions. He will not easily comprehend
that nature sometimes twists pretty
strongly the most opposite singularities;
most chymically amalgamates her rarest
metals; and combines those varieties in
one character, which generally she finds
quite sufficient to form many ordinary
personages. We say this as an apology
for the characters of Vaurien, and the
Platonist, who hereafter will appear. And
now, for the ease of ourself, and that bet∣ter
half of ourself, the candid reader, we
here close our dissertation on the mar∣vellous
in novel writing.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="224"/>
We return to Monsieur Vaurien, who
being <HI>un homme infiniment aimable,</HI> will
not at all be offended, by this slight neg∣lect.</P>
<P>The first object that interested the
house of Belfield, in the character of
this gentleman, and which is too com∣monly
indeed the first noticed in a
stranger, was his personal appearance.
Perhaps men should not be judged, like
coin, by their look, and their sounds.
Nature, in her finest hand-writing, on
the whole figure of Vaurien, had said,
“this is an extraordinary man;” but
she went no further; and the species of
the extraordinary, was unfortunately left
to be discovered by the practical expe∣rience
of his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Vaurien was just above mediocrity in
size; so that it cost him little exertion to
assume an air of majesty, when a bold
and dignified gesture was requisite. The
<PB N="202" REF="225"/>
finest colours with which nature ever
tinted the human face, glowed on his
countenance; his eyes were of the darkest
lustre, a liquid fire sparkled in those
restless orbs; their masculine spirit re∣lieved
the delicacy of his complexion;
and without the expression they gave
to his face, it would have had little more
than the most feminine softness. When
nature produced Vaurien she seemed in∣clined
to have created a woman; but
Vaurien, with the peculiar sensibility
of the sex, had made himself something
more than man. His voice had a cir∣cumference
of sound, which included
every note of the human passions; awe∣ful
in it's loud eloquence, assuasive and
touching in it's modulated sweetness, and
enchanting even in the murmur of a
whisper. His whole frame was vivified
by the most expressive gesture; it was
an embodied voice; eloquent in words,
<PB N="203" REF="226"/>
he was still more persuasive in action.
Fascination was an art in Vaurien; when
he threw himself at the knees of an of∣fended
beauty, her resentment died away,
she felt instantly what she never felt be∣fore,
and to listen to Vaurien was to se∣cure
her own seduction. If an adversary
accused, his mind became confused, his
voice failed; the fixed eye, the starting
gesture of Vaurien, darted contending
passions in his agitated spirits. Was he
engaged in the cause of a friend? he
inspired confidence, described difficulties,
and taught how to vanquish them; he
bound the existence of his friend with his
own, and whenever it seemed that he
knew too much, it was found that the
fate of his friend could alone depend on
the will of Vaurien.</P>
<P>His genius was probably equal to the
greatest occasions; he, at least, had al∣ways
sound it superior to whatever he
<PB N="204" REF="227"/>
had hitherto directed it. He joined to
a calm and persevering industry, an ar∣dent
and hazardous te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erity; we must
risque a throw in the game of human
life, he would say. His passions were
impetuous when let loose, submissive
when checked. He was judicious and
inventive; temperate and voluptuous;
avaricious and lavish. In his boundless
soul was contained each extreme of pas∣sion;
flexible or firm, it felt not the in∣fluence
of human events; never so miser∣able,
as to be hopeless of enjoyment,
never so humiliated, as to be forgetful
of glory. But his imagination, by hav∣ing
greater magnitude than that of
other men, confounded itself like a
whale in shallow water; men indeed were
instruments in his hand, but for some
vast and romantic projects, they were
instruments too uncertain and too feeble.
Like Archimedes, he thought that had he
<PB N="205" REF="228"/>
fit machines, he wanted not the skill, to
move the earth at his pleasure. His
projects were too romantic to be at∣tempted,
and too singular to be cre∣dited.
Vaurien, had been a traveller who
had experienced all the benevolence and
all the malice of his fellow men; the
confident of dukes in their palaces, and
of peasants in their cottages; one who
had studied in solitude, and acted in life;
who had rioted in pleasure, and felt no
sufferings in it's abstinence; a vicious
and great man, capable even of virtue.</P>
<P>Such was the person, who now pre∣sented
himself before Lord and Lady
Belfield, with a modesty that embellished
the winning address of his voice and his
manners. His resistless grace scarcely
seen, was felt; he gained their admira∣tion,
and, were the sensation not too
strong for such noble personages, would
have gained their affections.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="229"/>
His conversation was delightful, by the
variegation of it's topics, the vivacity of
his remarks, and it's information copious
and novel. He could only converse in his
vernacular idiom; and apologized for his
unpardonable ignorance of the language
of a country he admired and venerated.
But he assuredly lost nothing by con∣versing
in the brilliant idiom of his ma∣ternal
tongue; a language which in it's
most familiar phrases and colloquial dic∣tion,
displays that delicacy of expression,
that vivacity of ideas, that epigrammatic
point, which would furnish our present
race of dramatists, with more wit than
they can afford to bestow on their indul∣gent
audiences, supposing that wit would
serve their turn as well as pantomime.</P>
<P>He described many interesting events
of the French revolution; but these he
only described, and did not comment on,
otherwise than while listening with per∣severance
<PB N="207" REF="230"/>
to the volubility of Lord Bel∣field,
he sometimes responded with a
piteous shrug, an assenting inclination of
the head, and a pathetic elevation of the
eyes and the hands. My Lord having
poured out <HI>all</HI> his ideas, was as clearly
seen through, as an empty decanter.</P>
<P>His present situation was enquired. He
informed them that it was well adapted
to cherish that pleasing melancholy which
an exile feels, when he only suffers for
unavailing efforts employed for the good
of his expellers. “It would be criminal
in me to enjoy any repose, when my un∣happy
country bleeds through all it's
veins. No, my Lord, when I dip my
bread in water, the purity of my heart,
renders it a voluptuous meal. I am an
exile, but I am still a patriot. And
when the just Aristides, even inscribed
the shell that condemned him, shall I
lament, that my intentions are ill under∣stood
<PB N="208" REF="231"/>
by my fellow citizens? Solitude,
my Lord, is not terrible; there I find
the wants of nature are so few, that I
often am surprised, a thinking being
should complain of poverty.”</P>
<P>“This is exactly (cried my Lord)
what the great philosopher Subtile has
so often said. And I dare say it is true;
but it is surprising that if the wants of
nature are so few, philosophers should
talk of the justice of a public division of
the lands, an Agrarian law.”</P>
<P>“Ah, my Lord (replied Vaurien) de∣signing
men too often assume the glo∣rious
distinction, of preceptors of the hu∣man
race. A philosopher should only
counsel how to employ wealth, but he
ceases to be such, if he acquires it. Phi∣losophy
has it's counterfeit coin, my Lord,
that bears the impression, but is not
sterling. Some of my own countrymen,
who have taken refuge in this courteous
<PB N="209" REF="232"/>
and bountiful island, I have seen, and do
not like. I keep myself in the utmost
seclusion. Exile shall not convert a pa∣triot
into an intriguer.”</P>
<P>“These are noble sentiments Mr. Vau∣rien,
replied his Lordship. If you will do me
the honour of occupying an apartment in
my house, your residence in this country,
may be softened by the attentions I
would pay to your merits. Charles, my
young friend here, will be proud of any
little services he can render, and your so∣ciety
will instruct a youth inexperienced
in men and manners.”</P>
<P>I shall not repeat, for the reader's con∣venience
and my own, the infinite obliga∣tions,
and the great number of objections,
by which the ingenuity of Vaurien oppos∣ed
the invitation of Lord Belfield. In∣deed
his Lordship totally failed in his
desire of having Monsieur Vaurien for
his companion. Nothing could prevail
<PB N="210" REF="233"/>
over the modesty of the inflexible French∣man.</P>
<P>Lady Belfield interposed; she described
all the conveniencies she thought might
recommend themselves, and she lamented
the pleasure he denied them from his
conversation. All in vain! “sa Ladyship,
etoit trop flatteuse”—She fixed her eyes
on Vaurien, a spontaneous glance ex∣pressed
something more interesting than a
verbal invitation.—“<HI>Ah, mon Dieu! Je
suis accablé de vos bontés; Je suis au comble
de sensibilité; Il me couteroit trop cher de vous
resister.</HI>”</P>
<P>In plain English, and without a meta∣phor,
Monsieur Vaurien found himself
most conveniently accommodated at the
house of Lord Belfield, enjoying tran∣quilly,
<HI>des diners magnifiques, et des soupers
divins,</HI> precisely just as if he were at Paris.
Meanwhile, honest Charles was quite re∣joiced
at the sociable qualities of Mon∣sieur
<PB N="211" REF="234"/>
Vaurien, and was “right glad” to
see, that so amiable a man, was not ob∣liged
to live on that kind of “meal which
was rendered voluptuous by the purity
of his heart,” and likewise that this exiled
patriot, seemed “to repose, while his
country bled through all it's veins.”</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Vaurien's Walk in London.</HEAD>
<P>NEITHER dazzled by the splendour,
nor enervated by the enjoyments of
which he participated in the house of
Lord Belfield, the pleasurable days of
Vaurien were not inactive; he snatched
at those intervals of time which many
consume in listless regrets of a wearied
existence, and from midnight orgies,
often escaped to studious vigils. His
present object was the acquisition of the
English language; he knew that every
process of industry can be calculated
with precision, and that the learning of
languages, of which the knowledge in∣slates
the vanity of so many idlers in eru∣dition,
<PB N="213" REF="236"/>
was after all only the gross amount
of so many days patient labour. “As
for the dead languages (he said) they are
not of indispensible utility in the present
state of the literature of modern Europe;
we have models of every species of com∣position;
I feel no ambition to re-write
in Greek or in Latin, what is inimitable
in my maternal language; I would not
wrestle with a poet of my own country,
to suffocate him with Olympic dust, or
barbarously macerate him with the blows
of a Roman cestus, loaded with lead.
The idiom of our residence is a current
coin, but the languages of which men are
even ignorant of the pronunciation, are
only curious medals, to place in the
ostentatious cabinet of the petty vir∣tuoso.”</P>
<P>In the mean time every day strengthen∣ed
his connexions with our hero. He
enlarged his views with new aspects of
<PB N="214" REF="237"/>
human life; pointed his knowledge with
some apposite anecdote not easily for∣gotten,
while it came always associated
with the observation; and while his pre∣ceptive
truths were worthy of a sage of
antiquity, was serious without formality,
and gay without frivolity. Charles con∣ducted
him through the town; and such
was the ardour and curiosity with which
Vaurien examined the metropolis, that if
Charles had not considered him as a great
philosopher, he might have concluded he
was no careless spy.</P>
<P>Certain it was, that our hero often
marvelled, in the simplicity of his heart,
at some singular notions, which escaped
the fertile imagination of the Frenchman.
In Saint George's Fields, he enquired, if
that was not the place, a certain lunatic
had assembled fifty-thousand men?
“Yes (replied Charles) it was here an
assembled mob suddenly gathered, and
<PB N="215" REF="238"/>
rapidly diverging, the bursting flames
were viewed from various parts of the me∣tropolis,
and the panic was more general
than the conflagration.” “It is easy (re∣plied
Vaurien) to alarm an opulent city;
no men are so timorous as the rich. I
have not yet seen in these environs, a
place more happily adapted for a battle
or an encampment; here London might
be besieged, or pillaged, while a mob
might be taught an orderly arrangement.
Men soon become soldiers; they have a
great aptitude for murdering each other.
Those obstructing houses should be first
pulled down, for that a few hours would
be sufficient.”</P>
<P>“We are, thank Heaven (said Charles)
protected from such future alarms. It
would be now difficult to do, what a
lunatic once did.”</P>
<P>“True, (replied Vaurien); but it hap∣pens,
my friend, that what is most diffi∣cult,
is sometimes most sudden.”</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="239"/>
Vaurien could not pass St. Paul's with
out a resolution to enter it's ball. “That
is a noble height (he said) I love all
eminences. My mind rises with my
body; I was never more pleased than
when in passing the Alps, a thunder∣storm
suddenly burst at my feet. Had
I been fifty yards lower, I had been anni∣hilated.
The whirlwind, as it rushed afar,
overset me. I loved, on the Pyrenees, to
scale the ridgy rocks, to gaze on the dark
abyss; and on the glacieres, to mark that
waste of nature, when a mountain dis∣solving,
thunders, rolls, and foams like
an ocean.” When he was placed in the
ball, he looked down. “How ridiculous
(said he) is the scarcely visible scene be∣neath!
Not a sound of it's eternal hub∣bub
reacnes us; the carriages seem to
glide in silence; we can scarcely perceive
those proud, irrational, imperfect beings!
This place, Charles, is a seat for a philo∣sopher;
<PB N="217" REF="240"/>
here only do we feel the undis∣turbed
silence of the heavens.”</P>
<P>“And yet, my friend (he continued)
we can gain no true knowledge if we
keep too distant from men; we must
mix among fools to learn what is wis∣dom.
Suppose a number of sages were
born in this cupola, and knew nothing
more of mankind than what they could
discern at this elevation. How idle would
appear the incessant motion of those
minute bodies! they would find as lit∣tle
interest in the scene as we do in gaz∣ing
on the phases of the moon. Believe
me, Charles, they would, however, consi∣der
their little republic of great conse∣quence.
You smile—why the story is
our own! Those ambulatory sages be∣low
form the very republic I describe,
conceive themselves of the utmost im∣portance,
and look on the scale of exist∣ence
<PB N="218" REF="241"/>
without intelligence, and yet with
pride!”</P>
<P>As they were returning from this ball,
which had given occasion to so much
sublime philosophy, that the honest
youth imagined Vaurien was inspired,
finding no one to interrupt their curiosity,
they rambled in this immense building,
which only receives the light from oc∣casional
crevices and loop-holes. It was
curious to examine the interior piles.
“Charles (said Vaurien) your country∣men
are unsuspicious. I am thinking with
what ease, if it were necessary, combusti∣bles
might be left here, which in a con∣cealed
but certain manner would involve
this noble edifice in flames, while the
villanous incendiary would enjoy the view
in security.”</P>
<P>Charles replied, “It is very true Mr.
Vaurien; the keepers here are shamefully
<PB N="219" REF="242"/>
negligent. But perhaps, like myself, such
a thought never entered their heads.”</P>
<P>“The French (said Vaurien) have very
inventive heads, and the English very
unsuspicious hearts.”</P>
<P>Vaurien was desirous of viewing the
armoury at the Tower, but no admit∣tance
was at present to be obtained. The
dock-yards at Plymouth he would take
in his way to Devonshire with his Lord∣ship;
“I am curious (he observed) to
view what constitutes the force of every
country I inhabit. One gains but little
intelligence from the hasty traveller, or
the dry dictionary-maker. Whatever I
view with my own eyes always supplies me
with new ideas, even if they should
only serve to correct the blunders of other
people.”</P>
<P>The talents and the virtues of Vaurien
daily won the affections of Charles. To
his knowledge, Vaurien had given many
<PB N="220" REF="243"/>
evidences of the most disinterested dispo∣sitions;
and, since his progress in the
English language, had reconciled many
dissentions in the house to the satisfac∣tion
of both parties. Lord Belfield had
insisted on supplying him with money,
and this was liberally distributed among
the household, nor refused to paupers.
“If your government (said he) would
oblige the idle to labour, your streets
would not so frequently offend the eye
of humanity; in China there is no poor.
All men can labour; the blind can turn
a wheel; the lame can perform what
depends on the eye; age may have it's
sedentary, and even childhood it's active
employments.” Every mouth echoed
the praises of Vaurien. In the boudoir
and the drawing-room his accomplish∣ments
seemed inexhaustible; various,
they never tired with the sameness of
excellence; facility, that charm of ge∣nius,
<PB N="221" REF="244"/>
gave it's peculiar grace to his most
finished efforts. No man appeared more
deserving, and seemed less solicitous of
praise. Lady Belfield was enchanted by
the amenity of his manners; his Lord∣ship,
by the versatility of his conversation,
and by certain projects that bound him
still more closely; Charles viewed him as
a model of humanity and taste. The
philosophic circle considered him as an
acquisition of rare value; Dragon
thought him not deficient in spirit;
Libel discovered a rich mine of anec∣dote
to fill his columns; and the atra∣bilarious
Subtile even ceased to speak,
to attend to the syren sweetness of Vau∣rien,
while Mr. Reverberator clapped
his applause, and remembered his exact
expressions.</P>
<P>Johnson was insensibly supplanted by
Vaurien in the affections of Charles.
“Johnson (said our hero) is a man of
<PB N="222" REF="245"/>
observation, but he had been no traveller.
There is a contraction in his views, an
asperity in his manners, and a deficiency
in taste for the politer accomplishments.
Vaurien is a citizen of the world; he
feels no prejudices of attachment, there∣fore,
for any person or any place; besides
he is liberal, for he speaks with kindness
of Johnson, but Johnson never com∣mends
in him what in another he would
deem worthy of the highest praise.”</P>
<P>But there was something of a very
secret nature lurking in the heart of
Charles, which prompted this comparison
more favourable to the Gaul than the
Briton. Charles had generously establish∣ed
Mrs. Wilson in a small shop of gro∣cery;
and when the young man inge∣nuously
related the whole affair to John∣son,
he smiled, sarcastically observing,
“that women of a certain age seemed
the reigning taste;” and, misconceiving
<PB N="223" REF="246"/>
the benevolence of Charles, gave an ad∣vice
more honest than pleasant, on bad
connections. But Vaurien, when the se∣cret
was confided to him, instantly ap∣plauded
the design: “I can spare a trifle
myself to increase the stock of Mrs. Wil∣son;
I consider it a tribute I pay to
virtue, and a favour I owe to friendship.
She is a sister of an unfortunate class of
human beings, and my heart bleeds
when I think that this numerous class
are deserted females! we call them by
the ugly name of prostitute; but the
voice of humanity softens the disgusting
appellation; such a woman, is “a mother
without being a wife”!”</P>

<P>THE suspicions of Johnson, to which
we have alluded in the preceding
chapter, would assuredly have not ap∣peared
entirely so unfounded, had he and
the other friends of Charles known, as
intimately as Vaurien did, what was pas∣sing
in the small habitation of Mrs. Wil∣son;
and indeed benevolence, though a very
active virtue, is not of the most persevering

in time become reciprocally weary.</P>
<P>We do not wish to conceal, that an
impulse more potent than that of cha∣rity
<PB N="225" REF="248"/>
directed the frequent visits of our
hero to the house of Mrs. Wilson.</P>
<P>As we do not consider that the histo∣rian
of diurnal life is at all under any
legal obligations to pursue the comfort∣able
proceedings of his graver brothers,
who go on gently by the regulation of
their dates, and as we honestly avow,
that even an anachronism (particularly
when the reader is fully as ignorant or as
careless as the author) is not the most
flagitious crime a novelist can commit,
we have not hitherto so much consulted
the unity of events as of characters, we
shall therefore proceed to give more
connectedly the memoirs of Charles, be∣fore
he became intimate with all those
great personages whose acquaintance he
now enjoys.</P>
<P>When the bounties of Charles and
Vaurien had quite established Mrs. Wil∣son
in her little shop, she with great
<PB N="226" REF="249"/>
sagacity perceived that the shop might
not be sufficient to maintain the house;
she therefore ingeniously let the upper
apartments, and in this manner she made
the house maintain itself. Should this
to some appear mere trifling to narrate,
it is, with another paragraph in these
volumes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. page 118.</NOTE>, proposed as worthy of the at∣tention
of a shop-keeper. They were
taken by two persons, who, as they are
not to be passed over hastily in this
work, we shall pay great respect to their
first appearance, and which, as they are
only obscure lodgers in obscure apart∣ments,
is doing more than what any
whole neighbourhood would in these two
great cities.</P>
<P>These two persons then were a male
and a female, and very courteously were
they received by Mrs. Wilson, without
requiring any references to their friends,
<PB N="227" REF="250"/>
which was so far fortunate, as it would
have put them to the painful confession,
that in this micro-universe of London
they had no friends at all. The reader
is on the point of hastily condemning
Mrs. Wilson's negligence, and we entreat
any infantine senile virgin not to exclaim,
“This is just what might be expected
from <HI>such</HI> women!” in our opinion there
was more of humanity than of negligence
in this voluntary omission of Mrs. Wil∣son;
the relationship of these two per∣sons
could not easily have been mistaken,
for the man was an old Belisarius, who
seemed to sink in the earth as he sup∣ported
himself on the arm of an angel,
by her beauty, but evidently a poor suf∣fering
woman, by the sorrows that had
touched her pale features with a melan∣choly
grace. Now, if the reader has
not discovered by this time that these
two persons were a father and a daughter,
we shall conceive it as a great favour if
<PB N="228" REF="251"/>
he would quietly lay down our book,
and bid us an eternal farewell.</P>
<P>The name of the old man was Lieu∣tenant
Balfour. Had Hogarth viewed
him, he had drawn a figure either singu∣lar
for the ridiculous or the pathetic;
the sublime and the burlesque are too
often so closely neighbouring, that it
entirely depends on the taste of the artist
to make the same object affectingly se∣rious
or provokingly risible.</P>
<P>Balfour, in his exterior, was literally a
fragment of human nature, and an evi∣dence
that the source of life must lie
concealed in some obscure corner of the
human body, and cannot be dispersed
through all its parts. If we had the
necessary time allowed us, here might be
a fine exhibition of our recondite re∣searches
relating to the pineal gland, the
white medullary substance of the brain,
the subtile matter of Descartes, and the
<PB N="229" REF="252"/>
vibrations of Harvey; but all these co∣pious
proofs of our great erudition we
with pangs conceal, preferring the plea∣sures
of our incurious readers. We do
not however agree with any system of our
predecessors, as that would be quite un∣customary,
and little inventive.</P>
<P>For our part we do most humbly con∣ceive,
that the source of our existence
lies in a certain muscular part, situated in
the middle of the thorax, but being of
a pyramidal form, brings it's point for∣ward
to the front of the breast. Into
this reservoir of humanity flows all the
generous blood of <HI>noble men</HI> (we mean
those who are so by nature, and not by
title), and by the dilatation or contrac∣tion
of the part we moralists generally
ascertain the degree of manhood of every
human form. It most consequentially
follows, that a “tun of flesh” may not
contain more of the true principles of
<PB N="230" REF="253"/>
life than the slightest vessel, which na∣ture
or fortune seems to have treated
with the utmost carelessness. When <HI>the
heart</HI> is well placed, it springs with a
warm dilatation, so that it may happen
that a poor unpromoted lieutenant, like
Balfour, shall have his breast more nobly
and amply filled than even a yellow
admiral's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These gentlemen are usually termed by the tars—; but one must not write the unvarnished words of truth in the present most varnishing age.</NOTE>, though his body, like a
shattered frigate after a glorious engage∣ment,
be dismasted, and left a mere
wreck, and as the French, in their me∣taphorical
style, say, “all covered with
glory;” and, indeed, the body of our
aforesaid lieutenant had little other
covering, which, however, did not ex∣cite
in him so much anger as humour,
observing generally, when he looked over
the Gazette promotions, that <HI>he</HI> seemed
<PB N="231" REF="254"/>
to be sent only into this world to be
shot at; and he generally closed this ob∣servation
with drinking the king's health,
that is, when he had the wine.</P>
<P>This old man now appeared, led in by
his daughter; a broad black silk bandage
covered his eyes, which was not worn for
his own convenience, but for that of any
friends; to him it signified little whether
his eyes were covered or uncovered, since
in both cases his vision was exactly the
same. One eye indeed had been dropt
many years ago in boarding a vessel, al∣though
he had not yet shared in the
prize-money; it's companion had been
lately lost by a gutta serena. He had
but one arm, and he only lamented that
it was not the right, as that might have
spared his dear Emily many troublesome
attentions; he was not born, however,
with one arm, but the other being rather
busily employed in grappling with some
<PB N="232" REF="255"/>
Frenchmen, it was thought necessary by
them to get rid of it; one of his legs the
Spaniards had taken possession of; and
he had two deep scars on one cheek, left
by the snikker-snee of the Dutchmen's
short knives, which they used at the
Dogger bank. This is an inventory of
the dismemberments of Balfour, which
his modesty could not hide; I shall
however aver, that Balfour was a whole
man, for his heart was well placed.</P>
<P>Should the reader feel any interest in
what relates to this poor battered old
lieutenant, it can only be our defici∣ency,
if he peruses the following account
with the apathy of some lords of the
admiralty.</P>
<P>Balfour had never been rich, but he
had received the education of a gentle∣man,
designed at an early period for the
navy of Great Britain. His father had
rarely trusted him to the uncertain hand
<PB N="233" REF="256"/>
of a preceptor, and beneath the sanctity
of the domestic roof had concealed from
him the depravity of a luxurious age.
When at length he issued into life, to his
great mortification he could find no as∣sociates.
With him temperance had be∣come
a habit, and study a taste; his
companions regarded him with contempt;
Balfour was not heard to complain; his
pleasures were silent and concealed.</P>
<P>About this period he lost his father,
whom he called the rigid preceptor of his
youth, and the pleasant companion of his
maturity. The father had not died unsatis∣fied
with existence; the reflection of the
future life of that son melted like a scattered
sweetness over his departing spirit. He
raised himself with a proud satisfaction on
the bed of death; “Obscure as I am (he
cried) I have bequeathed to my country
the rich legacy of one of it's valuable
citizens.”</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="257"/>
Balfour was left indeed by his father
with many virtues, but with no money;
two reasons which alike destroyed the
friendships of the world. A mistake,
not singular in a youth of his dispositions,
served to embitter his age. At the first
period of active life he was not sen∣sible
that he wanted for either friends or
fortune. He thought, that what we owe
to favour was a possession usurped or
precarious, enjoyed without tranquillity;
but what we obtain by merit is unalien∣able
as a personal estate: he therefore
devoted himself to professional studies,
as the proper means of his advancement;
but he soon began to perceive how much
a man's fortune depends on his connec∣tions.</P>
<P>He met occasionally repulses, which
wounded the dignity of his character.
His passions were effervescent, and his
discernment too delicate for the ease of
<PB N="235" REF="258"/>
his passions. His character was of a tem∣per
too fine for common use; it was an
instrument adapted only for great and
momentous occasions. He read of illus∣trious
characters, aspired to imitate what
he had admired, and acted and conversed
with a sublimity rarely comprehended
and frequently ridiculed. His manners
contracted a morosity, and his dispositions
a misanthropy, of which he was not sen∣sible.
For the sensitive Balfour solitude,
the sole refuge of elevated minds, was
his consolation; glory was the aliment of
his soul; and the contemplation of his
romantic feelings a source of aweful en∣joyment.
The pleasures of memory were
not his pleasures; the present moment
was not his existence; his fervid genius
lived only in the ideal of the future; and
his life was a life of anticipation and dis∣appointment.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="259"/>
Forty years he fought the battles of
his country, and had only once kissed
the king's hand, which honour he con∣fessed
was more owing to accident than
distinction. But he loved his king, and
the remembrance was cherished like the
recollection of a victory or a promotion.
With victory he had been familiar, but
promotion never reached the friendless
lieutenant; he saw, indeed, that what
he expected to have obtained was now
given to the younger brother of an earl,
the third cousin of a duke, and once to
the son of a pillaging keeper of the king's
stores. “I see now,” said Balfour, “it
must come round to me.” He lived
under the ungentleness of fortune, un∣conscious
of it's ungentleness; but at
length, battered and broken down with
the last loss, that of his right arm, he
was obliged to retire on half pay.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="260"/>
Balfour was not only born to be shot
at by his fellow men, but to receive all
“the arrows of outrageous fortune.” He
felt the loss of an amiable woman at this
period, when love alone remained faith∣ful,
while hope and glory had proved
traitors. The connubial voice that whis∣pered
peace had ceased, and the lamp
of love was only lighted in a sepulchre.
The hero and the philosopher died away
in the blind, old, helpless man. He had
two children, Edward, who had entered
into the service of the East India Com∣pany,
but who, in a battle with Tippoo
Saib, was among the missing men. Since
that account had been received, he had
become more feeble and silent; he pined
daily, and his soul sickened with despon∣dence.
His daughter Emily devoted her
days to his comfort; her tones were gay,
while a tear often trickled on her cheek;
<PB N="238" REF="261"/>
she fed him and amused him, but her
caresses seemed only to excite a keener
agony. He would sometimes lean over
her face, but shed no tears; his noble
heart was broken, and he was now too
old to weep.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Death of Lieutenant Balfour.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Lieutenant and his daughter
were just arrived from their residence
at Exmouth in Devonshire. The jour∣ney
to London had entirely originated in
the obstinate affection of Emily, who,
since her father had lost the total use of
his eye, and was thus deprived of the
solitary inlet of pleasure which remained,
found the pain of existence intolerable.
The apothecary was of opinion, that it
might be possible to remove the film
that overspread the pupil of the eye;
but the heavy expence of the journey,
and the uncertainty of the cure, had
always rendered Balfour averse to this
<PB N="240" REF="263"/>
project, and he observed, “that for a
poor old lieutenant like himself, it was
incurring funeral charges fit only for an
admiral; besides (he would add) my dear
Emily, this village is better adapted for
me to die in, and you to live in.” But
Emily ceased not her importunities; and
one day having heard of a happy cure
performed by Baron Wenzel, she knelt
before her father, and extorted a solemn
promise to place himself under the care of
this oculist.</P>
<P>Such was the purport of this journey.
To Balfour it was as aweful a transport as
if he had travelled alive in his herse. It
however awakened in him those powers
that had long seemed extinct. But his
mind, entirely absorbed in the fate of his
fair daughter, her seduction appeared to
him disguised in a hundred forms. As
he proceeded every slight thing sounded
ominously fatal to his sombrous fancy.
<PB N="241" REF="264"/>
The crack of the coachman's whip shook
his nerves; the whirl of the coach obliged
him often to draw his hand to his head;
the dinner conversations of the travellers
alarmed, and he took Emily frequently
aside to enquire who were their com∣panions.
When they reached the paved
streets of London, and their ear was as∣saulted
by the tumultuous hubbub, he
grasped the hand of his daughter, and
whispered her, never to quit him a single
moment. All these were objects which
some twenty years ago exhilarated his
spirits, but now they were associated
with the perils of his daughter. The
contrast was too violent for his sensitive
frame; he had just left a quiet cottage,
rural walks, and conversations which had
only soothed his ear. He supported
himself with a decent fortitude before
his fellow travellers; he recollected
that he still wore an old blue coat,
<PB N="242" REF="265"/>
with yellow buttons which had an an∣chor
engraved on them. A veneration
for his majesty's service partly kept
up his spirits; but having at length
reached the apartment of Mrs. Wilson,
he sunk back in his chair, and swooned.</P>
<P>The minute attentions, and the fre∣quent
caresses Emily bestowed on her
father, charmed the good Mrs. Wilson,
who voluntarily offered her aid in every
thing she could perform. “I am afraid,
(said Emily,) we shall prove but trouble∣some
lodgers, and shall stand in need of
all the humanity you can bestow on us.
My father has lately been afflicted with a
fever on his spirits, and his temper is
irritable, since the loss of my brother.
But when he gets a little more strength,
he has given me his promise to be
couched; and he holds his promises
inviolate. I hope soon that he will see
the person to whom we are already in∣debted
for so much goodness.” Mrs.
<PB N="243" REF="266"/>
Wilson sympathised with her fair lodger,
and, charmed by her dispositions, and de∣lighted
by her accomplishments, she con∣tracted
the purest friendship. Her lod∣gers
had not been there many weeks,
when she took an opportunity of men∣tioning
to Charles and Vaurien the sin∣gular
excellence her little habitation con∣tained.
Emily excited their curiosity;
but as she rarely quitted her father in the
day, it was some time before they could
see her. When the lieutenant retired to
his early rest, she passed a few hours in
conversation with Mrs. Wilson, whom
she found intelligent and sympathetic.</P>
<P>These conversations were well adapted
to confirm their friendship. They felt a
reciprocal want of consolation; both were
solitary females; the whole universe was
as nothing to them; there was a painful
vacuity in their hearts, which was filled
by the tenderness of friendship.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="267"/>
When a person of sensibility has re∣ceived
an essential service from another,
it is a gratification to relate it. The re∣collection
is a continual oppression on
the feelings, and the communication frees
us in an-instant. Gratitude opened the
lips of Mrs. Wilson much more than
those voluble communicative dispositions,
which have been generally supposed to
form a great portion of a woman's conver∣sation.
But there are cases, when even
the utmost ardour of gratitude cannot
induce us to relate <HI>all</HI> the kindness of
another, when that would serve merely to
exhibit ourselves in a degrading light.</P>
<P>She therefore with equal gratitude
and prudence mentioned, that she had
been left the widow of a bankrupt, with
four children, and when reduced to de∣spair,
in the disinterested benevolence of
two friends found assistance to purchase
her little shop. She mentioned this in∣deed
<PB N="245" REF="268"/>
as a proof of a particular provi∣dence,
and as an extraordinary circum∣stance.
Now I desire the reader to ob∣serve,
that Emily dissented <HI>in toto</HI> from
this opinion; first, because in the sim∣plicity
of her heart she found nothing
extraordinary in the succour so charita∣bly
bestowed on a widow and four chil∣dren;
and secondly, her father had never
taught her, that there was any reason to
suppose the mysterious operation of a
particular providence. The subject, in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed,
they had discussed; but the lieu∣tenant
used generally to conclude by
pointing to his one leg and his one eye, and
particularly to a very thread-bare blue
coat which formed his whole wardrobe.</P>
<P>One day when Charles and Vaurien
were conversing with Mrs. Wilson, Emily
stept down for her harp, which she had
left the preceding evening in the back
parlour of her friend. As she entered,
<PB N="246" REF="269"/>
Charles modestly raised his eyes on her,
withdrew them, and again ventured to
gaze with a timid resolution. He saw a
grace, a blushing grace; and that finish∣ed
form, associated with the excellence
he had heard, came like an enchantment
over his heart; he bowed, was silent
and motionless. Vaurien threw over the
whole form of Emily a rapid glance; it
looked at the face, darted into the bo∣som,
fixed on the arm, and wandered in
the most voluptuous variety. The dis∣concerted
Emily seemed for a moment
to forget the object for which she had
entered the room; she murmured some∣thing
of an apology; she took the harp;
her hand trembled; she let it fall; Vau∣rien
flew to her assistance; her hand
came in contact with his; she reddened,
and quitted the room in confusion.</P>
<P>“She is indeed amiable! and faultless
in her form as in her heart,” said Charles.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="270"/>
“Upon my soul (cried Vaurien) she is
the finest woman I have seen in Eng∣land.”</P>
<P>“She is the best, I am sure” (added Mrs.
Wilson).</P>
<P>“And her father is quite blind?” en∣quired
Vaurien maliciously.</P>
<P>“She does not quit him a minute”
(replied Mrs. Wilson, simply).</P>
<P>“What filial affection!” exclaimed
Charles, sincerely.</P>
<P>Vaurien run on in great volubility.
“She cannot be more than eighteen.
The touch of her arm is enough to cor∣rupt
a Carthusian! Her lips are two rose
leaves! Her eyes, her bosom, her nose,
perfect Grecian! Did you observe her
foot, Charles, when she leant for the harp?
I shall like that harp for it's falling—what
an attitude it gave us! Why, she
is a model for the colouring of the pain∣ter
and the chissel of the statuary.”</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="271"/>
“Mr. Vaurien (said Mrs. Wilson) you
talk of her in your national manner.
You look on the beauty and forget the
woman.”</P>
<P>“Why indeed (replied Vaurien) one
can only describe what one feels. Her
virtues are no doubt great; one might
see that by her provincial simplicity. A
blind father too would be an affecting
incident even in a romance. We have
one on this very subject in French, but
it is rather a little dry, and if the hero
had not been blind I am afraid our sym∣pathy
had not been put to the trial by
the grave lectures of his philosophy. But
trust me, now she is gone, I only ima∣gine
to have seen a fine picture.”</P>
<P>During this colloquy Charles con∣tinued
as silent and motionless as when
Emily was in the parlour. To have seen
her was to have loved her. Vaurien
was all gaiety of heart and volubility of
<PB N="249" REF="272"/>
tongue; Charles was pensive and silent,
and left the house of Mrs. Wilson with
a regret he had never yet felt. He car∣ried
away in his heart an emotion that
prevailed over all others. He was more
engaged in love, in five minutes, than a
Frenchman, with all it's analytical me∣taphysics,
could be in as many years.</P>
<P>But we must now return to our he∣roine,
who in this moment is ascending
pretty quickly the stair case. Emily had
accustomed herself to little monologues,
which some great observer of human na∣ture
has most truely called, “thinking
aloud.” By the means of these monolo∣gues
her father, who had ceased to see
her for years, knew whatever she was em∣ployed
about, and literally <HI>heard</HI> every
single emotion that fluttered in her inno∣cent
heart. As soon as she had reached
the door of her apartment she slackened
her steps, and entered, saying, “I am
<PB N="250" REF="273"/>
very thoughtless;” and so she quietly shut
the door, as if she had now resolved to
use caution even in the minutest thing.</P>
<P>“What is my love thoughtless in?”
said Balfour; for being, as the reader
knows, very blind, he was apt to be won∣derfully
quick in listening.</P>
<P>“Only in a trifle I hope, sir. Having
left my harp last night in Mrs. Wilson's
back parlour, I stept down for it, and
without thinking of the impropriety, I
opened the door, and she was engaged
with her two friends.”</P>
<P>“Mrs. Wilson seems a very kind land∣lady,
and she will not be easily offended;
and I dare say, Emily, neither will the
other two ladies.”</P>
<P>“Dear sir, had they been ladies I
should not have trembled as I did, and
let fall my harp. They are two charita∣ble
gentlemen, who out of humanity
set her up in this little shop, and without
<PB N="251" REF="274"/>
which, she assures me, she must have
starved.”</P>
<P>Balfour interrupted his daughter, and
appeared in great emotion—“Two cha∣ritable
gentlemen who set her up in a
shop!—Almighty God! art thou inex∣orable
to the prayer of a father? Hast
thou brought here to perish his deserted
child? When thou didst expose me to the
buffetting mockeries of the worthless I
was patient; when thou didst dismember
me, limb by limb, I murmured not;
when thou tookest away my son, I gave
but a father's sigh; when thou didst
snatch my wife from my bosom, I bowed,
and the pang I felt was for this child—but
now thou hast crushed me to the
grave, and thou hast made my soul taste
of the bitterness of death.”—He paused,
then cried out—“Emily, Emily, where
are you?—Give me your hand.”</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="275"/>
Emily was trembling with consterna∣tion
and surprise. She was kneeling at
his feet; her face was covered with her
hands, and she leant upon his knees;
scarcely could she say, “My father, my
father, what means this?” Emily wept;
the old blind Balfour passed his hand
over her face to wipe her tears. He
grasped her folded hands, and exclaimed
—“My child, my child, we must be in a
bad house!”</P>
<P>“A bad house! impossible, sir! Did
you but know Mrs. Wilson, you would
acknowledge her for the kindest of wo∣men.”</P>
<P>“Cursed hypocrite! What, she is
young, and gay, and dressy, and, I sup∣pose,
very agreeable in conversation?”</P>
<P>“Ah no, sir! she is of an advanced
age; is never gay; decent but poorly dres∣sed,
and her conversation is serious, and
so far agreeable.”</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="276"/>
“Then she is some worn out harridan
—understand me, child, some procuress!
I shall now hate that sympathising canting
voice. I wondered why she should be
so kind to a poor old blind man, but I
see it was for the young daughter!
Emily, Emily, thou wilt be bought and
sold. We must depart, this week; we
must depart. Did I not foretell this?
Did I not premonish? But I must
yield to the persuasions of a simple
girl! O Emily, your goodness checks
my anger. If we were but at Exmouth!
There I would have died like a man—I tell
you, foolish girl! you can know nothing
of human nature—dear good Emily, you
have always lived at the side of a blind
helpless father—yes, yes, I see your fate
—my God! my God! the thought is
agonizing! help me, my child, help; I
am sick, I am very sick, child—I—”</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="277"/>
As he was speaking, the terrified Emily
observed his features alter; they writhed,
looked ghastly and he sunk in his chair
seemingly a breathless corse. She rang
loudly; Mrs. Wilson hastened to her re∣lief;
the apothecary was called, and was
not long in deciding that all medical aid
was in vain; it was a severe paralytic
stroke, which could not fail to terminate
the life of the feeble old man.</P>
<P>Balfour with great difficulty combated
with nature for a few days. He gradually
recovered his senses, but they were feeble
and exanimate. His powerful emotions
were exhausted, and only a tincture of
his native sensibility remained in his de∣bilitated
frame, like that raciness which
the empty vessel retains, when all it's
noble spirits are poured out.</P>
<P>Emily watched over him by day and
by night. Mrs. Wilson performed the
<PB N="255" REF="278"/>
duties of humanity. But nature was
ceasing her operations.</P>
<P>Balfour desired Emily to approach his
bed, and delivered himself in the following
words:</P>
<P>“Emily, are we alone? My child, the
hour has come; the chillness of death
already benumbs me. Approach, my
love!” he kissed her forehead as she leant
over his face, while her arm supported
his head—“Emily, you have acted nobly
as a daughter. Since fate has reduced
me to a state of infancy, more cruel than
the first, to your father you have been a
parent. If virtue in this idle existence
were it's own reward, I should have died
happy—but Balfour has been virtuous
and miserable.”</P>
<P>“My father (said Emily) respect the
mysterious award of the Divinity. This is
an hour of trial; have you not taught
me, by your words and your actions, the
<PB N="256" REF="279"/>
magnanimity of fortitude? Have you not
often repeated, that virtue has it's self-enjoyment?
You, my father, have been a
hero and a philosopher; I have seen you
smile in sorrow. Consecrate the bed of
death, and teach me how to die.”</P>
<P>“Blessed be that voice! (cried Bal∣four)
that recalls the warm blood that
had almost deserted my heart. I feel
a new spirit, my Emily! you have de∣prived
death of it's pang. Yes! I know
my girl is worthy of her father—Emily,
your guileless youth will bestow a virtuous
age. But what will you do, poor and
abandoned, without even your blind fa∣ther
to advise? Oh! had my Emily but
a partner of her existence, an honest
though a menial employment!”</P>
<P>“My father, you have made me the
creature that I am;—fear not then for
me—my virtue is my dower, my talents
my inheritance!”</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="280"/>
“Noble girl! I FEAR THE WORLD!
my voice refuses to give my thoughts—my
brain is confused—O would nature give
another hour! Be fortitude your pride!
When you see vice you will abhor it;
'tis incongruous with your sensations.
But FEAR THE VIRTUOUS! suspect the
disinterested; be cautious of the cour∣teous;
believe not the professor of truth;
fly the agreeable; and trust no one with
the simplicity of your heart. Your part,
Emily, in life, is to be on the defensive.
Associate with few; find independence in
your own character. Learn from a dying
father, that you can only be secure on
this earth by suspecting every appearance
of virtue. The error will be rare, and
the virtuous will forgive. It is my last
request that you quit this house. The
woman is kind; tell her she has the
thanks of a dying man; but the blind
are suspicious. In this town, when a
<PB N="258" REF="281"/>
woman owes her support to two young
men, it is understood by what means
youth becomes so charitable.—Alas! I
had much to say, but my thoughts die
before me. I feel a chillness at my heart.
Last night I dreamt, or I saw in my
thoughts, your mother and Edward—I
go to join two angels. Emily—Emily—pray
for me!!”</P>
<P>She was now kneeling at the bed side
—one hand clasped that of her dying
father—the other was raised to heaven.
As she spoke, her harmonious tones
rose with the fervour of her prayer.
Balfour seemed for a moment to be re∣called
from another world—his face in∣clined
towards the hand of Emily to
imprint a last and parting kiss—his
face inclined, but in the struggle he
expired!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Embarrassments of Emily, and the
Character of a Lady who had no Cha∣racter.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the last melancholy honours
were paid to Balfour, when the
tear of his daughter had fallen into his
grave, and the perturbations of Emily's
mind had a little subsided, the first in∣teresting
object that occurred to her was
the dying request of her father to quit
the house of Mrs. Wilson. This gave
occasion to the following reflections.</P>
<P>“How hard is it to comply with the
dictate of duty, when it comes uncon∣genial
to that of the heart! In this uni∣verse
I have no other friend than Mrs.
Wilson; a friendship indeed of yester∣day's;
<PB N="260" REF="283"/>
but to the friendless even such a
friendship is strong as that of a long du∣ration.
In so affectionate a form is there
concealed so foul a disposition? My father
could not see her; and even a vigorous
judgment sleeps when affection is too
wakeful, and trembles at fancied terrors.
Is human nature so fraught with depra∣vity
as that good man has instructed me?
Alas! this world was never the friend of
my father; he viewed all objects in their
cloudiest aspect. When he thought Mrs.
Wilson young and gay, he said she must
be some prostitute; but when I told him
she was aged and serious, then she must
be some procuress. If I had told him
she was an angel, he would have said,
that she was only a disguised demon.
Yet, perhaps, there is something singu∣lar
in the voluntary assistance from two
young men—and one of them really looks
not like a being that could have so much
<PB N="261" REF="284"/>
humanity. If he had not frightened
me, I should not have dropt the harp;
what a dark quick flashing in his eyes!
I shudder at the recollection! What an
insolence in examining me with such
minuteness! If what my father said were
true! O poor deserted Emily! I will lock
my door every night, and I will quit the
house this week.”</P>
<P>“And now what remains for me to se∣cure
my subsistence? I have but a few
guineas my dear father saved, I know
not how. Those that want but little
can hardly have reason to despair. I am
mistress of so many instruments, and
Miss Davies, by only teaching young la∣dies
to play on the harp, got a very gen∣teel
maintenance. My voice is good,
and I love to declaim; Mr. Sheridan
once told my father, that if I tried the
stage I might become as rich as Mrs.
Siddons, for that I was worth all the
<PB N="262" REF="285"/>
commentators on Shakespeare. But none
of these employments will suit me; I
should never be able to support a public
exhibition. I love an occupation where
I am quite alone; something that may
be done in one's own room quietly, with∣out
the observation of other eyes. I have
some reputation for painting flowers on
sattin; and my dear Edward once told
me, that he sold my paintings of mid∣night
groves for five guineas a-piece. I
can make <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace too. So I have nothing
more to do now than to prepare my
performances, and carry them to the first
shop. How grateful to one like me is the
tranquillity of occupation; it detaches
from many evils; from the listlessness of
existence, the pangs of recollection, and
the despair of want.”</P>
<P>This artless monologue was closed with
a sigh to the sad memory of her father;
she thought of him with such fervency
of remembrance, that it seemed a kind
<PB N="263" REF="286"/>
of silent prayer. She wiped away the
tears that glimmered on her eyes. She
placed her work basket on the table, and
in taking out some muslin a card fell to
the ground. “It is Miss Million's ad∣dress
(cried Emily); now this is most
fortunate. I had quite forgotten her;
I have not opened my basket since I
have been in town. She will be glad to
see me, for she repeated her invitations
a hundred times. She is a lady of great
fashion, and it will be easy for her to pro∣cure
me a fine circle of purchasers for all
my little works.”</P>
<P>The reader may possibly recollect, that
in our route exhibition we hung up a
portrait of the father of this lady; an
important personage from the hours of
twelve to three at the Bank. As for
Miss Million herself, her character is
drawn with the utmost difficulty, being
one of those irrational parts of the crea∣tion
<PB N="264" REF="287"/>
that have no character at all. All that
we can say is, that she was the daugh∣ter
and heiress of one of those stock∣jobbing
citizens, whose astonishing for∣tunes
rise like exhalations, and sometimes
disappear as suddenly. Men who unite
at once the violent contrast of the most
sordid penuriousness and the most ridicu∣lous
extravagance. Miss Million was ex∣actly
like so many other daughters of
such modern citizens of London, having
only one object, which seemed to require
all her feeble faculties to accomplish;
namely, a violent imitation of the ele∣gance
and refinement of women of qua∣lity.
But as this was only a later pur∣suit,
like young artists, she had not been
very successful in her first attempts; yet
she had some favourable qualities to shine
in a fashionable circle; she abounded in
apathy, was tolerably illiterate, brilliant∣ly
vain, fertilely capricious, and was in∣cessantly
<PB N="265" REF="288"/>
calling out for <HI>la bagatelle,</HI> of
which her pronunciation was not quite
accurate. She spoke the French lan∣guage
as often as the vulgar idiom, and
was a living proof that the maximum of
a fair citizen's knowledge of the Parisian
dialect did not exceed to that in old
Chaucer's day:
<Q><L>“And French she spake faire and feteously,</L>
<L>After the school of Stratford at Bow;</L>
<L>For French of Paris was to her unknow.”</L>
<L>The PRIORESSE.</L></Q></P>
<P>On the whole, however, Miss Million,
by acquiescing with every one, by dif∣fusing
an universal smile, by playing
deeply, and particularly by her splendid
equipages, and still more particularly
by her father's having purchased the
necklace of the Queen of France, which
she wore with great ease, was a favourite
of fashion.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="289"/>
About two years before the moment
at which our history is arrived, her father
had sold his omnium for such an ad∣vanced
premium, that he resolved to
quit his house in Pudding Lane, to oc∣cupy
one of the noblest mansions in Port∣man
Square. She was soon initiated into
the mysteries of high dissipation; every
person of fashion crowded to inspect the
Queen of France's necklace; and Miss
Million was also conspicuous for “a
rage” for private masquerades and bota∣nical
studies. Hitherto, however, she had
seen little of the forest scenery of England,
excepting that part noticed by “the
lerned clerke”we just quoted; and it
was at her villa at Dulwich that she
first formed“the prophetic eye of taste.”
She persuaded her father to make an ex∣cursion
into Devonshire, where the Mar∣gravine
of Anspach informed her, in the
express words that polite authoress em∣ploys
<PB N="267" REF="290"/>
in her elaborate and learned travels
to the Crimea, “that the country had <HI>a
very genteel</HI> appearance;”and likewise
Mrs. Radcliffe, in her novels, had re∣peated
and repeated the expression of
“the feature of the landscape.” This
united idea of “the genteel feature”
overflowed the sensorium of Miss Million.
The stockjobber, his daughter, and the
Queen of France's necklace, were whirled
down by four post horses; and if Miss
Million no more admired the lovely and
romantic hills of Devon than the dead
flats of Dulwich, it must certainly be
attributed only to the mode of tra∣velling.</P>
<P>When Miss Million arrived at Ex∣mouth,
greatly did that young lady
marvel at the effect of popular preju∣dice.
That spot she had heard men∣tioned
and admired in several polite
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ircles; yet to her it appeared a very
<PB N="268" REF="291"/>
mean village, by no means comparable
to her favourite Margate; and she could
not easily comprehend why some persons
should go two hundred miles to view the
sea, which might be seen at less than
seventy. She made this reflection, which
her father observed was a very sensible
one, as they were walking on some of
it's hanging rocks, and which, she as
sensibly observed, she detested, because
every rock was an acclivity like Highgate
Hill. Nothing now remained for the
amusement of this amiable young lady,
but an attempt to convert Exmouth
into a mimetic London; she never went
out but to pay visits; so that upon the
whole, had she only <HI>heard</HI> something
about Exmouth, she would have <HI>seen</HI> it
more than she did at the place itself.
Her visits were, however, numerous; they
could not fail to be so by the happy
system she had adopted. She resolved to
<PB N="269" REF="292"/>
visit two kinds of persons; first, those
who she did know; and secondly, those
who she did not know.</P>
<P>Among the latter was our dear Emily.
She had observed her frequently leading
her father on Chapple Hill, where she
resided. Whoever saw Emily admired
the easy grace of her motions, and the
simplicity yet tenderness of her features.
One morning Emily appeared curiously
engaged at a hedge; her father had rested
on the sod; at length she plucked a wild
yellow rose, a flower which some consider
as a native of the softer climate of Devon.
When Emily had extricated this native
rose, in thoughtless rapture she turned
to her father—she sighed and shook her
head. “What is the matter, my love?”
said old Balfour. “Nothing, nothing,”
replied Emily. “I was only thinking
you cannot any more admire your fa∣vourite
rose; I have plucked one of the
<PB N="270" REF="293"/>
finest.”—“Talk not to me of roses, child▪”
said Balfour peevishly; “yet I can still
smell. Give it to me. 'Tis faint, Emily!”
—“Alas, Sir, it is <HI>only</HI> beautiful!”
said the fair moralist.</P>
<P>During this dialogue, Miss Million,
when she perceived that Emily had
plucked a rose, started, reversed her
chair, and hurried out in all the ardour
of botanical curiosity, and as this curio∣sity
was infinitely greater than her know∣ledge,
it led to no short conversation.
The following day she favoured her dear
little botanist (as she called Emily)
with a visit, admired her flower paint∣ings,
thought they were monstrous fine,
and resolved to rob her of one to hang
in Portman Square. Many visits were
received from Miss Million, and many
earnest invitations were given for an ex∣cursion
to the metropolis.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="294"/>
These visits were never opposed by
Balfour; for he lamented the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilial perse∣verance
of his Grecian daughter (as he
called Emily) for attending with such
solicitude his imprisonment. When
strangers came he only enquired whether
any officer accompanied them? Several
regiments quartered in the neighbour∣hood
had already molested the peace of
the quiet, and destroyed the happiness of
the innocent. “Emily,” he would say,
“abhor these men! Our home troops are
now supposed to be merely trained for a
stationary appearance. They consist of
all the hot-brained youth in the king∣dom;
frivolous and debauched, illiterate
and insolent, they seek for fortune by
pleasing your sex, and for honour by of∣fending
their own. The partiality of
your sex for such mean understandings
and such corrupt hearts has given occa∣sion
to suspect the imbecility of the fe∣male
<PB N="272" REF="295"/>
character; and it is supposed your
easy attachments to officers are simply
derived from their weakness and frivolity,
which place them more on a level with
women than any other class of men.”
For this harsh opinion Balfour had two
reasons; first, because he was a naval
officer, and held in sovereign contempt
the military buck; and secondly, because
it had a great deal of truth.</P>
<P>To Miss Million Emily now resolved to
have recourse as a patroness of her little
works. About one o'clock she went to
that lady, whom she found at breakfast.</P>
<P>When Emily entered, she experienced
great difficulty in making herself known.
She was Miss Balfour, of Exmouth—She
had had the honour of Miss Million's
visits—She had not forgotten Miss Mil∣lion's
invitation—She hesitated, stood
silent, and perplexed.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="296"/>
Miss Million stared, and then cried—“The
old blind lieutenant's daughter!
Lord, my dear, I never expected to see you
in town. I declare I feel myself delighted.
Won't you take a chair? And are you
settled in London? And where do you
live? What has brought you to town?
And who do you visit in our neighbour∣hood?”</P>
<P>All these questions were extremely em∣barrassing,
and the last seemed vexatious.
Emily, confused, and knowing not which
particular one to select from the number,
sat silently down. As it happened, she
did what precisely she would have done
had she been more intimately acquainted
with this fashionable lady; who was one
of those persons who, when they put
questions, do not exactly know the nature
of a point of interrogation, and therefore
neither wait for nor expect an answer.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="297"/>
To relieve herself from all these per∣plexities,
Emily resolved to tell her story
in her own way.</P>
<P>“I have done myself the pleasure (she
began) of waiting on you, because you
can, I think, madam, render me an im∣portant
service should I merit your at∣tentions.”</P>
<P>“An important service,” muttered
Miss Million, looking much more gravely
than she did when she was putting her
rapid questions. Indeed she had good
reason, for the words, “important ser∣vice,”
conveyed to her brain a kind of
half-reflection, which always disturbs the
intellectual faculties of a lady of great
fashion.</P>
<P>“My father (continued Emily) died
last week in this town. You know, ma∣dam,
that a half-pay officer cannot die
rich, yet he may die with honour. My
father has not encumbered his orphan
<PB N="275" REF="298"/>
daughter with a single debt. I am now
obliged to have recourse to those talents
which once formed my amusements. You
have honoured them, madam, with your
partial approbation. I shall soon have
some little paintings, and some pieces of
lace, which, if recommended by your pa∣tronage,
will procure me an employment
and a subsistence.” She stopt, and a few
minutes of silence took place.</P>
<P>“Oh child, is that all?” replied Miss
Million, with her eye fixed on a print
that was placed opposite. “Have you
brought any with you? Lady Belfield is
a great collector and amateur. I shall
certainly recommend you, child!” Miss
Million spoke all this with that refined
apathy which seems to be a gift from
nature rather than an acquisition of art.
It was expressed in that tone of indif∣ference
which ladies of her fashion em∣ploy
whenever an object of charity has
<PB N="276" REF="299"/>
by some means got introduced mistakenly
into their apartments; a mistake which
they generally afterwards provide against.</P>
<P>Emily knew nothing of all this; she
only did not find herself quite so com∣fortable
as she had fondly hoped.</P>
<P>As Miss Million recollected that “the
important service” would not occasion
any exertion, and as “the old blind
lieutenant's daughter,” after all, made no
attack, direct or oblique, on her purse,
she most humanely condescended to give
Emily—a very detailed account of
Mrs. Broadhead's masquerade, in which
she had exhibited herself, and the queen
of France's necklace, in the character of
Britannia.</P>
<P>Suddenly, however, a great change was
observable in this amiable woman. Her
tones were tolerably gentle, her counte∣nance
looked almost with tenderness, and
softly pressing Emily's hand, she said,
“My dear Miss Balfour, how I sympathise
<PB N="277" REF="300"/>
with you! Your father was a dear good
man, and behaved to me with extreme
politeness; and assuredly your accom∣plishments
well merit a friend. You are
solitary in a dangerous town; I wish, my
dear, you would accept an asylum in
Portman Square. Your company would
be a great relief to my spirits. Lord, my
dear! you can't conceive what a poor
nervous being I have grown! Such head∣achs
of a morning! such tremors last
night at the masquerade, when my neck∣lace
hung rather loose! I am quite in
rapture to see you, and I insist on your
making this place your abode.”</P>
<P>Emily was consoled for what she had
suffered. The invitation was a benefit
she could not resist; it at once relieved
her from parting with Mrs. Wilson in
apparent displeasure, and it secured her
from the precarious mode of life she pro∣posed
<PB N="278" REF="301"/>
to adopt. She acceded to the pro∣posal
of Miss Million. This was the
first error she committed in her entrance
into the world; but she was not aware
that she was then violating the solemn
injunction of her father, to seek her inde∣pendence
only in herself.</P>
<P>We are sensible, in closing this chapter,
that some of our readers (for such assur∣edly
we shall be mortified with) whose
sagacity is of the rapid kind, and who
judge, we suppose, by intuition, have al∣ready
condemned us as having commit∣ted
an outrage on venerable nature when
we represented Miss Million so suddenly
differing from herself in her gestures, her
voice, and her expressions. If we are
here condemned by any rash judge, who
chuses to sit on the bench, we shall ab∣solutely
move for a new trial before a
judge who can alone form the legal de∣cree,
<PB N="279" REF="302"/>
we mean Reason, who a very great
poet has called,
<Q>“The lord-chief justice in the court of man.”</Q></P>
<P>We do further declare, and hurl the
declaration in the very teeth of criticism,
that we have not in this instance swerved
a single hair's breadth from the curved
and involved line of human nature, which
we as much respect as did Hogarth when
he called it the line of beauty. A lady of
Miss Million's character, or no character
(as the reader chuses) has frequent occa∣sions
to employ these fluctuations, de∣pressions,
and elevations of her voice and
countenance. What induced Miss Mil∣lion
to differ so very evidently from her∣self
in the short space of a quarter of an
hour, we, for the ease of our candid rea∣der,
most willingly inform him.</P>
<P>Let it therefore be known, that Miss
Million had every thing a lady of qua∣lity
<PB N="280" REF="303"/>
has, down to a lap dog and a soci∣able<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This solecism in the English language is a barbarous substantive of the polite circles. It may be necessary, for the intelligence of the country gentlemen who are not in parliament, to inform them, that it consists of a kind of double phaeton with opposite seats for four persons, and is drove by a postillion.</NOTE>, but one necessary appendage,
termed a humble companion. Miss Mil∣lion
was, as we have seen, rather new on
the town, and disdained to bring any
“low creature” from Pudding Lane to
Portman Square. She was on the point
of advertising for some such servant out
of place, when, providentially, poor Emily
Balfour appeared. The thought did not
occur immediately, but merely when
the visible alteration took place. In a
word, the very compassionate Miss Mil∣lion
proposed to make the same use of
our amiable heroine as some still do of a
dumb waiter—an excellent piece of fur∣niture
when a person happens to be quite
alone.</P>

<P>EMILY, on her return to Mrs. Wilson,
acquainted her with her unexpected
good fortune, felt every gratitude for her,
but proposed the following day for her
removal. Mrs. Wilson listened in silence,
and even after Emily had ceased to speak,
could only answer by a profound sigh.
At length she said, “This separation is
severe as it is sudden. Your absence
includes the loss of so many tender ideas,
so much consolation, so sweet a tranquil∣lity,
and such numerous and gentle offices!
I know that I am not worthy of enjoying
<PB N="282" REF="305"/>
a friendship like yours; but once to have
called such excellence my own raises me
in my own estimation. The pride I feel
but gives a sharper pang to this laceration
of my affections. I had busied my
thoughts in forming an easy establishment
for you; but it is now over! Allow me,
however, my dear Miss Emily, when you
are quite settled, to call once on you.
Let me have at least the consolation of
knowing that you feel your situation
agreeable.” “My dear Mrs. Wilson,”
replied Emily, pressing her hand, while a
tear dropt from her eye, “I can never for∣get
you. Superior to your occupation, I
lament to leave you in it. You was my
first friend in this great town; perhaps
the only one I now possess. Call on me
whenever you chuse; I shall certainly
call frequently on you.” Emily thought
to herself “what a delicate circumstance!
<PB N="283" REF="306"/>
I feel grateful, yet must not evince gra∣titude!”</P>
<P>Emily on the following day removed
to Portman Square. She was received
with excessive and troublesome kindness
by Miss Million. She allotted her an
apartment, furnished her with a lady's
maid, and gave many other proofs that
her generosity was as inexhaustible as her
wealth. Emily received every thing with
a favourable eye and a grateful heart.
She indeed would have wished to have
been less incommoded by this multipli∣city
of grandeur, but she suffered it from
affection for the donor; nor did it much
disconcert her, for she was educated to
give dignity to the grandeur of an oriental
princess.</P>
<P>We must now leave Emily amidst all
the splendors of Miss Million, arrang∣ing
her little affairs, preparing various
implements of taste, with which she pro∣posed
<PB N="284" REF="307"/>
adorning the stately mansion in
Portman Square; sometimes attuning
her harp, and by her attitude and har∣mony
exhibiting a personification of that
saint of taste, Cecilia; nor did she testify
an inferior affection for some things
which she never proposed to exhibit in
public; we mean certain loose papers,
which booksellers term manuscripts; for
(which we have not hitherto even hinted
to our readers, as we resolved they should
get her character by degrees) Emily, al∣most
unknown to every one, and parti∣cularly
to herself, was a delightful and
feeling poetess. She presumed not to
print her verses, because she was sensi∣ble
they were quite of another character
from that most ornamented, most elabo∣rate,
most offuscating manner of our
fashionable children of Apollo. All that
we can permit ourselves to say on so
secret and delicate a subject as the pre∣sent
<PB N="285" REF="308"/>
is, that she never read Milton but
that she seemed possessed by his own imagi∣nation,
if we might judge by the agita∣tion
of her frame; and her couplets were
formed on the finished structure of Pope's
opulent yet not gaudy versification; and
we are inclined to think, that through
the high polish of his verse there ran a
vein of the Italian fancy of her favourite
Milton. There seemed, indeed, a species
of plagiarism in her poetical talent, since,
whenever she rose from a perusal of some
of the great masters in her beloved art,
and had employed her active fancy in
the sublime and beautiful, as certainly
would she pour out some effusions of a
congenial nature; but as these were only
effusions of the moment, Emily had
written a great deal of verse without
having composed one poem, or suspecting
herself of being a poetess.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="309"/>
During the time we have been de∣scribing,
Charles and Vaurien had rather
more frequently than heretofore called
on Mrs. Wilson, never omitting enqui∣ries
after her fair lodger, who since the
death of her father was quite invisible,
and never quitted her apartment. Mrs.
Wilson now informed them, that to her
great regret she had left her apartments
to reside with Miss Million, in Portman
Square.</P>
<P>“Charles (said Vaurien) that is the
ugly huge corpulent daughter of the
loan contractor, who begged us to call
on him to give our opinion of an im∣mense
villa he is building. What think
you of a call? The worst is, that if we
see Miss Balfour we must see Miss Mil∣lion,
which is like passing through pur∣gatory
to get to heaven.”</P>
<P>“I remember (said Charles) that Mr.
Million at the routes of Lady Belfield.
<PB N="287" REF="310"/>
That man always offends me by his osten∣tatious
wealth; he carries his schedule in
his mouth, and seems to be talking to
his steward when he is conversing with a
friend. Then we shall be perplexed with
all the fluctuations of stocks, and pro∣bably
have a most true and faithful ac∣count
of his interview with Mr. Pitt
about the lottery contract. However
we must go, Vaurien, will he, nill he,
for the sake of something more precious
than even his last loan.”</P>
<P>“<HI>De par tous les diables,</HI> Charles! I
see clearly you are smitten with this girl.
Upon my soul she is worth enjoying; you
are in love, my boy!”</P>
<P>“Indeed I am not, Mr. Vaurien; I
give you my honour I am not. I never
intend to be in love; a young man like
me cannot afford it. It is one of the
attendant curses of a luxurious age, Vau∣rien,
that it severs all those finer affec∣tions
<PB N="288" REF="311"/>
of the heart, without which there
is no true pleasure in existence. We
do not marry those whom we could love
because they are poor; and we marry
those whom we can never love, because
they are rich. O what a formal, feeble,
frigid Cupid is our modern deity of love!
he has no quiver filled with thrilling darts,
no unerring bow, none of the naked mo∣desty
of the child of beauty; on he trudges
with a black coat, with voluminous parch∣ments,
and the only language he whis∣pers
agreeable to a woman's ear, is jointure
and settlement. My friend, I have re∣solved
never to render myself or another
miserable by matrimony.”</P>
<P>“A most wise and generous resolution!
A man need not want for wives in the
present day; those of his neighbours are
quite his own, if he only knows how to
knock at the door. The noble work of
propagation thrives not the worse; 'tis
<PB N="289" REF="312"/>
only assisting the lame over a stile, Charles!
modern matrimony is one vast system of
polygamy. Why, matrimony was a blun∣der
of some stupid and impotent legisla∣tor;
nothing can be more unnatural than
to cork up in one bottle elements that can
never blend; marriage! mere oil and
vinegar; one of them will always remain
under; in France we have therefore
established divorces at the pleasure of
either party. I knew a young Hercules
who had thirty wives in the first year
after the committee of public safety
had decreed it: poor fellow, he was un∣lucky;
for, like Hercules, he died of the en∣venomed
robe of one of his Dejaniras. But
why need we public divorces, when, with∣out
the formality, we live in a course of
marriage and divorce.”</P>
<P>“Mr. Vaurien, this subject is always
revolting to me; you treat it like a
Frenchman, and never in your country
<PB N="290" REF="313"/>
was true connubial enjoyment found.
Adultery is foul; not because the law
has so decreed it, but because reason
tells me this. Adultery takes away from
a husband the love that was the source
of his existence; from children, the ma∣ternal
affection that re-enjoyed the father
in his offspring; from domestics, the re∣spect
that they felt for their mistress, and
inflames a woman with salacious passions,
who, when she hurries reeking from the
stews, is more miserable than the com∣mon
prostitute, because she is not as com∣mon.
O Vaurien, 'tis a foul crime; the
cruelty of murder terminates in one per∣son,
the cruelty of adultery is propa∣gated
through a generation.”</P>
<P>In this dull moralising strain (at least
on the side of Charles) they reached Mr.
Million's house; and that day being a
holiday at the Bank, the Bank Director
was at home.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="314"/>
They found this contractor of loans
most laboriously employed at a table
covered with a number of little red
books, containing his rescounter ac∣counts,
a collection of computations of
purchases and sales at various prices, to
assist him at the rising of every eighth
per cent.; a pen was stuck through his
curl.</P>
<P>“Gentlemen, I am quite proud of the
honour of this call; and I hope his lord∣ship
and her ladyship are well. How is
Chloe too? her ladyship was extremely
concerned about the asthma of that fine
Spanish beauty. I should indeed have
sent to enquire after that most amiable
creature. And pray is there any
news?”</P>
<P>Charles replied, “Admiral Elphin∣stone
has had the singular good fortune
of surrounding a Dutch fleet, and taking
them without firing a single gun.”</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="315"/>
“More shame, gentlemen, for admiral
Elphinstone! It can have no effect on the
consols. I don't like these takings of
whole fleets without a battle. Formerly
we would fight by the hour, and an Eng∣lishman
was proud when he cleared the
decks of an enemy. Any news from In∣dia?”</P>
<P>“There has been a most sanguinary
battle between Tippoo Saib's army and
the company's troops. The seapoys fled
in a panic. Seringapatam is lost.”</P>
<P>“Noble intelligence! strong bear of
India! Let's see now, if they fall to∣morrow
to 170—100,000 nets me—no,
that calculation is made for 175—pew;
it nets me 15,000. A pleasant breakfast
this! I hope we shall have a little worse
news by the next letters.”</P>
<P>“I lament, sir, that an Englishman
should find his prosperity in the misfor∣tunes
of his country.”</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="316"/>
“Sir, this must always be the case
when we are bears. In these times we
are all bears. Yet I love my country
for the sake of my good friend the minis∣ter.
To be sure I have been ill-used; he
gave me only. £. 600,000 of the loan, when
I expected a million; I cannot but be
half-pleased. Besides he has a little of
the Algerine, I mean the dey; why, he
used to make us all stand at our biddings—ay,
make a Bank director stand!—but
I cock my eye, and throw my head
backwards, that I may look him full in
the face, for he is proud and erect. So
we have chairs now. Pitt's a good ac∣countant
with Rose by his side; he beats
us hollow for three-pence a ticket, and a
half on the consols. The first English
financier; he saves the nation from ruin
by the hardest Smithfield bargain. But
since lords have become bankers I think
the banking business degenerates.”</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="317"/>
“We have come, Mr. Million, to see
the plan of your superb villa.”</P>
<P>“Aye, I have begun to build; but
'twill take ten years before I can get into
an apartment. 'Tis long for a man of
sixty! 'Tis a pity that your grand style
is always the longest to manage. My
country house will be as large and
solid as the Mansion House; I'm all for
solidity. It will exhaust a mine of Port∣land
stone, and will stand, I am told,
in an earthquake. My drawing rooms
are to be papered with silver muslin; that
is, they will not be papered at all.
One's obliged to use old words for new
fashions, which sometimes confuses our
ideas. My gardens will take up, includ∣ing
pleasure grounds, offschapes, and
landscapes, above one hundred acres. I
have cut a red-hot gravel coach-road all
through it for the convenience of travel∣ling
at home. My hot-houses are im∣mense,
and my pigs shall feed on pines.
<PB N="295" REF="318"/>
I have got the New River turned into my
garden as a fish-pond, but it looks like a
puddle. I am fond of seeing houses, hav∣ing
been born in a very narrow lane; and
there is something too more natural in a
house than a tree, for it always shews
there must be people near one. I prefer
the view of a sociable wall, and even the
gutter of a neighbour's house, to all that
mad jaunt in Devonshire, riding post over
hill and valley till I was sea-sick; 'tis
an abominable romantic country! So I
have planned an ornament, which no one
ever thought of; in the midst of my
immense garden I shall build a row of
small houses. I shall call it Million Row,
at Million Place. I have no trees in my
grounds but poplars; for a man of my
age they are the only trees; they spring
the quickest. A tall poplar, stiff as
this rule in my hand, regales my eye; it
is the Pitt of trees; I call such the
straight lines of nature. I have a sum∣mer-house,
<PB N="296" REF="319"/>
in the exact form of the cu∣pola
at the Bank, so exact that you would
swear you stood in it. On the walls are
designed all the Bank offices; here the
three per cents, there the short annuities,
just as they are. The figures at their
various desks are portraits of my intimate
friends. Pitt is seated in the director's
chair. A curious gallery of pictures!
My daughter wanted me to have a mas∣querade
scene painted, with portraits of <HI>her</HI>
friends; but <HI>her</HI> friends all wear masks.
So then the artist observed, that they
might be painted, as he said saints who
had lost their heads generally were, that
is, by holding their heads in their hands,
like chapeaux bas, under their arms. Did
you ever hear the like? No, no, I pre∣ferred
<HI>my</HI> friends, who are not ashamed to
shew their faces, and have heads on their
shoulders; for there's not a man of them
worth less than half a million. D—e if I
would form a friendship with any man
<PB N="297" REF="320"/>
who is not worth a hundred thousand.
'Tis a maxim!”</P>
<P>At this moment a servant entered, and
informed Mr. Million, that Bob was in a
delirium.</P>
<P>Million exclaimed, wringing his hands,
“In a delirium! The worst news I have
heard since the sudden peace! Run, fetch
the prince's physician, the great city doc∣tor—the
quaker and the Jew—a consulta∣tion
instantly. What, Bob in a delirium!
This comes of his high feeding.”</P>
<P>“Who is Bob, Mr. Million,” enquired
Charles, “you have no son, or nephew, or
cousin of that name?”</P>
<P>“Bob, sir, was one of my ploughboys;
gentlemen! a youth strong as his team of
horses. Who the devil could think such
a horse of a man could ever be deli∣rious!”</P>
<P>Charles exclaimed, “How sensitive is this
humanity at the disorder of his plough∣boy.”</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="321"/>
Vaurien said, turning to Charles, “I
wonder at the reason?”</P>
<P>“Gentlemen, (continued Million) I
feel myself suddenly indisposed. Poor
Bob! I received him in my house, fur∣nished
him with all the requisites of a
gentleman, and desired him to live well;
bought turtles on the first arrivals of the
West India fleet; the dog swilled a pipe
of Madeira in six months. What could
man do more? he looked jolly and com∣fortable,
and as red in the face as a
burning coal. Poor Bob! I fear I overfed
him.”</P>
<P>“I must know the reason,” said Vau∣rien,
earnestly.</P>
<P>“He must assuredly (said Charles) have
performed some great and good action,
Mr. Million, to have merited affections so
truely paternal.”</P>
<P>“Gentlemen (replied Million) he is
the completest scoundrel, and only es∣caped
hanging by my interest with the
<PB N="299" REF="322"/>
minister. A most persevering thief, a
most dauntless liar, and a most universal
ravisher. He has bastardised a parish.
But the fellow was the most athletic and
brawny scoundrel in the three kingdoms;
a perfect iron giant; a fellow who in his
loose days, before he lived with me, when
'twas thought he could not escape the
gallows, every great surgeon in town
kept an eye on. Providence, indeed,
blest the scoundrel with a most uninter∣rupted
state of health, and excepting the
year after he domesticated with me, had
never the slightest ail.”</P>
<P>“I will know the reason,” said Vaurien.
“And pray, sir, why did you throw away
such excessive indulgences on a man
who has defrauded the gibbet?”</P>
<P>“Throw away, sir, who the devil
could think of a delirium? I considered
he was a safer person than myself, a poor
tottering old man, and my daughter
of a plethoric habit, and with such ex∣quisite
<PB N="300" REF="323"/>
sensibility that she is liable to a
dozen hysterics a day.”</P>
<P>“Safe in what, sir?” demanded Charles.</P>
<P>“Why have I not already informed
you? Gentlemen, I have both a tontine
and an annuity on the scoundrel's life.
If he dies I lose three thousand a year. I
might have insured his life, but his appe∣tite
was so voracious and regular, his
cheeks so round and rosy, a very Falstaff
without stuffing! On trufle pasties and
perigord pies he would breakfast, dine,
and sup, with intermediate refreshments.
I cou'd'nt believe it, but the apothecary
said that his blood was one mass of in∣flammation.
Gentlemen, I must beg
leave to retire. I must see how the scoun∣drel
does. The Lord preserve his precious
life. Overgorged by G—!”</P>
<P>This accident broke the purport of the
visit. “We must return again (said
Vaurien) when Bob is quite recovered or
quite dead.”</P>
