<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DEEP in a labyrinth, remote from view,</L>
<L>Fame's temple stands, and Fashion holds the clue:</L>
<L>Before the entrance rang'd, a suppliant band</L>
<L>Of candidates invoke her guiding hand:</L>
<L>In bursts the throng, a thousand different ways</L>
<L>They spread, wind, double thro' the puzzling maze:</L>
<L>Vain labor his who on himself relies,</L>
<L>Where none but Fashion's favorites gain the prize!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sad omen for our poet! who has chose</L>
<L>The narrow groveling path of humble prose;</L>
<L>A path indeed, which Moore and Lillo trode,</L>
<L>And reach'd Parnassus by the bridle road:</L>
<L>Brambles and thorns oppose, and at our side</L>
<L>Nature alone, and she a naked guide.</L>
<L>Patrons of nature, from your tears impart</L>
<L>Balm to her wounds, and heal her at your heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now parody has vented all its spite,</L>
<L>Let tragedy resume her antient right:</L>
<L>When Britain's lion roars in martial mood,</L>
<L>Throw to the kingly beast a sop of blood;</L>
<L>Loud in his ear your tragic thunders roll,</L>
<L>And rouse the mighty terrors of his soul:</L>
<L>When peace, with every liberal science join'd,</L>
<L>Decrees a joyful sabbath to mankind,</L>
<L>Let comedy restore the court of wit,</L>
<L>And open-a new sessions in the pit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pageants and pantomimes have spent their rage,</L>
<L>And emptied the whole wardrobe on the stage:</L>
<L>Lord Mayors of London clubb'd with Gods of Greece,</L>
<L>And Bishop Blaize comb'd Jason's golden fleece;</L>
<L>Whilst slipshod taylors on their tressel boards,</L>
<L>Of the Nine Muses sate the cross-legg'd lords;</L>
<L>Let a plain bard, in spite of Fashion, aim</L>
<L>By Nature's aid to find his way to fame:</L>
<L>To his domestic tale incline your ear,</L>
<L>Wives, husbands, children! you may safely hear.</L>

<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>DID ever man mistake his happi∣ness as I have done? am I by na∣ture fitted for a husband? am I by temper qua∣lified to be a gamester? and yet (a plague upon my folly!) I am both: in both I've doubled stakes, and play'd the losing game; married a wife for money, and a wife for love; and now nor love nor money will get rid of either: upon my right hand and my left a plague; over∣head ruin impends; under-foot lurks discovery. A situation that admits no choice, but choice of miseries. As to my Lady Davenant here, if
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
ever man was punish'd in a faultless wife, it is my fate to be that man; with beauty to attract, affections to assist temptation, still she stands upon a rock of virtue; nor can I, by the narrowest search, explore a crack or cranny, where the slightest levity might enter, to throw down her barriers, and make way for my escape:—when a wife's indiscretion will not save me, well may I rail at fortune; 'tis hard to lose upon a cast, where every chance was in my favour.—Now, Paget, before I talk to you, shut the door.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Paget, <HI>and shuts the door.</HI></STAGE>
<P>What have you discover'd in Lady Davenant since we last conferr'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt you have watch'd her—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Closely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where has she been? whom has she seen? what has she done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>The journal of one day is the journal of her life: if I had the eyes of a hawk (and mine are none of the dullest) I could not spy a flaw in Lady Davenant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Incredible! Are not you an at∣torney, and is not she a woman? have not I set you as a spy upon her person; cas'd the body of a lawyer in the livery of a servant; and, after three months past and more, will you persuade me, that you have discovered, what the world never knew, a wife without a flaw? I'll not believe if.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, my Lord, you must ev'n strip my livery off my back, and dismiss me to my parchments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will find flaws enough in them: of this I'm sure, if any thing can outwit a law∣yer, it must be the devil; therefore, Paget, I conclude against her Ladyship's sanctity. What do you tell me? has this great city lost its temp∣tations, or reform'd its morals? There are a hundred fine men of the town, who say she is the finest woman in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and swear it too: but she won't believe 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was credulous enough, when I told her so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas a great weakness; but she is wiser than she was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does Sir Harry Harlow make no way? He is a fashionable man, and came on with all the gallantry of a Frenchman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and went off like a Frenchman; he'll not rally any more; we have orders never to admit him—she is in frequent conversation with your son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have remark'd it, and shall stop their interviews.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has been collecting a sum—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's more than I can tell: I sold some trinkets for her of her uncle's giving, and exchanged some money into notes this morning.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I paid her quarter's pin-money but yesterday:—this must be look'd into.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we may look; but it is seeking for day-light with a dark-lanthorn: malice can∣not spy a fault in her; mischief cannot make one; and if I might offer my advice, it should be to desist from any further pains in the at∣tempt: 'tis merely loss of labour, take my word for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>To say the truth, I begin to be of your opinion; but till a better plan can be struck out, we must persist in this: you know my reasons, Paget; you alone, of all mankind, are in the secret of that fatal step, which trains me on in infamy and error. If Lady Davenant was in fact, as she is in law, my only wife, I would not act as now; but whilst that second marriage in Flanders with Miss Dormer draws off my heart, and keeps me under terror of discovery, if I can't find occasion for a divorce, I must make it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis plain your passion for Miss Dor∣mer still subsists, else her persuasion of your death, her ignorance of your name and station, and the precautions we have taken to prevent discovery, make these measures needless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I saw it in that light; but what security have I against Miss Dormer's coming over? what against her marrying again, believing, as she does, that I am dead?—that were a stroke that I should doubly feel. Another danger threatens me; her brother Dormer may
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
return from sea: his former passion for my Lady Davenant, and gratitude for my services in getting him a ship, will expose me to his visits: and I would sooner meet the devil than the man I've wrong'd so deeply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twou'd not be pleasant, I confess; but surely 'twas reported he was kill'd in action with an enemy's ship in the East Indies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wounded, not kill'd:—But hark! my Lady's coming.—Vanish! <STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> Paget.</STAGE> Good morning to you, Lady Davenant;—dress'd so early!</P>
<STAGE>Lady Davenant.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis my uncle's day for visiting, and I made myself ready to receive him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, that studied elegance of dress can never be put on to receive an uncle; you had some better object in your eye than old Sir Edmund Travers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's sincere; I know you do not set yourself in such array for family vi∣sitors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it; but a stranger, and a fa∣vourite too—when such a one is in the case—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, then you arm at every point for conquest: but this stranger—tell me, who is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is a greater stranger than your Lordship? If I'm arm'd for conquest, here's the heart I aim at.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! this is trifling; these are words in course. If man and wife keep forms, 'tis all that is requir'd; but to pretend a passion, and talk of love to a husband—'tis an affecta∣tion that lowers your understanding, but cannot impose upon mine. In the name of reason, Lady Davenant, make yourself an agreeable wife, but do not sink into that most insipid of all charac∣ters, a good sort of woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is your description of a good sort of woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is one that keeps the command∣ments, hears sermons, talks a little innocent scandal, and scolds the servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now tell me your receipt for an agreeable wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>An agreeable wife to a man of the world is a woman of the world; one who fol∣lows her own pursuits, and does not cross those of her husband. Let me speak to you with sin∣cerity—we married for convenience; there is a disparity in our ages; I was a widower, with a son as old as yourself; you an orphan girl of fortune, a slave to the humours of your uncle: you purchased liberty by the sacrifice of incli∣nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>How does that appear, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beyond a doubt; you know your heart was never mine; you know you was in love with Dormer; would have married him; was thwarted in your first affection, and took me
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
upon duty—I might have said upon compul∣sion; for I was your uncle's choice, not your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold there, whilst I declare to you, in truth of heart, if Dormer had not given me up,—unkindly given me up—it was not duty, no, nor yet compulsion, should have forced me to renounce him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I give you credit for a fair confes∣sion, and I draw this natural conclusion from it:—The woman who has loved, will love again—I am content. Let me speak plainly to you: you are young, handsome, sensible, susceptible: I am declining from the prime of life, a lover of my ease, and, I confess to you, not over uxo∣rious. Why should we restrain each other? Why should marriage, that strikes off other women's fetters, put on your's? live as women of your rank live; let your life be neither that of a town libertine, nor this, which you now lead, of a matrimonial mope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you, my Lord: but if I am better pleased to submit to the chagrin of your neglect, than to the reproaches of my own conscience, you will suffer me to pursue a dull choice, and be the object of your contempt, ra∣ther than of my own. I'll not disguise from you that my heart is made for love, soft and subject to temptation; therefore I avoid it: it once be∣longed to Dormer; he returned it wounded, bleeding to its owner; 'twas healed, made whole, and offered to Lord Davenant; if you
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
will not receive it, you may send it back to me, as Dormer did; but you shall never make it common property, assure yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let that pass. I have a ques∣tion, to which I beg your answer, without eva∣sion or reserve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Propose it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has passed of late between your Ladyship and my son? You have been clo∣seted more than once; what have you conferred upon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am I bound to tell that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indispensably; I charge you on your duty; if you will put yourself on your defence, defend yourself. I have remarked a sullenness in Captain Davenant, that does not please me; a darkness and reserve not proper; and I suspect your Ladyship of being party in the occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, if ever I am forc'd to make my sorrows known, it will not be to your son I shall speak unfavourably of his father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter; tell me what pass'd.</P>

Confusion!—let me see; five hundred pounds!—your Ladyship is very bountiful to Captain Davenant; and very considerate, as you would have it appear, of his father's pocket. If you had studied the necessities of that, Madam, why might not your bounty pass through my hands? how know you I approve of this? how can you tell but other calls may be more ur∣gent with me than this of a commission for my son? what if I have duns of honour now at my door? what if I have play-debts, that cannot be put aside? will you unstring your purse; empty your hoard of pin-money for me?—I do not find you will.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis in your hands; dispose of it as you see fit.</P>
</SP>

<P>And I do see fit to dispose of mine and my son's concerns without your Ladyship's advice or interserence: I shall also expect, and strictly require, that you do not talk and cabal with my son upon any thing that now passes, ever did pass, or ever shall pass, between you and me upon the subject.</P>

<P>Lord Davenant, I kiss your hands—why this is as it should be; this is as it us'd to be in days of yore, when man and wife fulfill'd the saying and were one flesh. I protest to you, I have been let into the houses
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
of three married couple this morning, and found but one and a half at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps the hen birds were on the perch, Sir Edmund, 'tis rather early.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good, very good, but that was not the case—Lady Turtle, for instance, was on the wing; that dove had left the ark;—knowing Sir Philander to be so fond a mate, I ask'd him of my Lady—she was not in the house—how did she do? he cou'd not tell—where was she gone? he did not care—I star'd at this—he observing my surprize, said, he sup∣posed I had not heard of his misfortune, else I would never have mentioned that vile hussey in his hearing—a plague upon all family affairs! thought I; 'twas not a week ago, this fellow held me by the ear with a detail as tedious as the courtship of Jacob and Rebecca—but I have always said, Lord Davenant and my Niece are the only instances of conjugal felicity, in upper life at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you think us so happy, Uncle, why don't you take an agreeable companion to chear the evening of your days?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>To hang myself in the evening of my days: how cou'd you name so horrible a thing to me as an agreeable companion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've observ'd, that they who rail most against matrimony, are the first to marry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I've remark'd, that they who marry, are the first to rail: lack-aday, if
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
I did not find you and my Lord here to∣gether in a family way, as they call it, always civil and courteous to each other, with a smile of complacency on your countenances, what should I think?—if I did not see these things with my own eyes, what should I say, when so many busy tattling fools are whispering it about that you are the most unhappy couple in London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whispering, Sir Edmund! they'll whisper any thing; but who dares say it?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was just my answer; my answer to a tittle:—a plague upon you all! said I t'other night to a knot of old fogrums at the Mount, who were caballing over their coffee, not perceiving me snug in a corner box—a plague upon you all! said I—</P>

<P>Why look you there, now—'tis surprizing how unwilling people are to hear my stories; not a man in our club will sit them out, except the smoakers. 'Twas just the same, when I was in Parliament, nothing but coughing, hemming, and shuffling of feet: no attention, no desire of information: all their brains a gadding.
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
And your Lord has a piece of that, let me tell you; but a good man in the main, an excel∣lent man in the main, an incomparable hus∣band.—</P>

<P>I make no complaint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>To be sure you don't—complaint indeed! no, if you had the least cause for that, trust me for finding it out; nothing of that sort could escape me, you know it could not.</P>

<SP>

<P>I should be sorry you had any cause to regret a match so entirely of your own mak∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, child, you are right; 'twas a match of my own making; you owe all your happiness to your uncle; and you now perceive a grey head was a little wiser than a green one: you was once of another opinion, but that's past and over; I don't reproach you, Louisa; indeed I may charge that error of your life to my own in∣dulgence. I humour'd you to a fault in your edu∣cation; turn'd my house into a school to make you happy; let you have as many masters as you pleas'd; doctors and apothecaries, you might choose amongst them all; but in the important article of a husband, there indeed I stept in, there I had my choice, as was natural I should; and now you see the consequence; now, Louisa, I say, you see the consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do indeed, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's fair; you are perfectly happy, and you own it, that's sincere: and
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
what did I do to make you so? thwarted your inclinations, that were leading you astray: I chose my Lord Davenant here, a man of a cer∣tain age, a widower, d'ye see; not only fit to husband you, Louisa, but to father you; whereas you know, and, if you are honest, you will confess, that if I had indulg'd you in your choice—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have chosen otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would have married young Dormer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the many anxious thoughts I had to prevent it! how did I puzzle my poor brain to make you happy and break off your connexion with that young fellow!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was there a contrivance in that business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was there a contrivance, child! to be sure there was; there's a contrivance in every thing I do: and I must do Lord Dave∣nant the justice to say, he took some pains in that affair as well as myself—witness Captain Dormer's letter to you.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What of that, I beseech you? let me know all my obligations to Lord Dave∣nant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And 'tis fit you should; every man's good deeds should be known: he wrote every word of that letter himself; not a syllable was Captain Dormer's.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a syllable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a tittle—and my Lord never told you this?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's extraordinary; but indeed he bound me to secrecy; so you must say nothing of the matter: Oh! he was at uncommon pains for your sake; for he thought you would be a monstrous fortune; and so to be sure you will at my death—but there I outwitted him too, for I came down with only ten thousand, and saddled him with a humming jointure, and four hundred a year pin-money.—Ah, my dear Louisa, I consulted your happiness in every tittle of your settlement.</P>

<P>Since you have been so considerate of me in the bargain you have made with Lord Davenant, let me hope you will now assist him in a family difficulty. His son is treating for the purchase of a majority, and wants a sum of money to complete it; he is an excellent young man, and you would do me a most acceptable kindness, if you would enable me to supply him with five hundred pounds.</P>

<P>Promise then, you will not name your father.</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis upon another business quite; and because you are the friend I best love on earth, you shall be the first to whom I communi∣cate my joy.</P>

<P>You have obtained your commission?</P>

<SP>

<P>I have indeed, but not the com∣mission, my dear Lady, you are thinking of; not a promotion to rank, but to happiness—I am married.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven and earth!—to whom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>An angel: one, who in mind and person is your sister; and, if evil fate had not forbade, might have been such in fact.</P>

<SP>

<P>What do you mean? explain your∣self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sister of your Dormer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Dormer!—What is it you tell me?—does your father know of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember your promise, and no more of this.—Where did you meet Miss Dor∣mer? I thought she was resident in Flanders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas there I met her, on my late journey to Spa:—how I became acquainted with her; why I conceal'd from you my passion; with each circumstance of her affecting story, will demand relation more at large—but she is not, as you call her, Miss Dormer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can readily conceive, since you have married her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she was not Miss Dormer when I did marry her: she was the widow of an Eng∣lish gentleman, of the name of Brooke, who liv'd with her about three months; went to Paris, and there died:—there is something mysterious in the conduct of this man; but that, with other matters, I must now defer. We are just return'd from a church in the city; but as friendship has its claim upon my heart as well as love, I snatch an hour from my enchanting bride to seek her counterpart; and, as I fear you have few bles∣sings you can call your own, I beg you to ac∣cept a share in mine.—Farewell!</P>

danger come!—there was a time I shou'd have been more scrupulous; but the base conduct of Lord Davenant makes him loathsome in my eyes; and was my injur'd hero now to come—Oh, Heaven, I will not think of it—Watch over him, ye guardians of the good and brave!—waft him, ye winds, to glory!—may the ship that bears him, and the star by which he sails, be ever prosperous!—and, as he walks the deck by night, amidst the waste of waters, should a thought of my unkindness smite his manly heart with sadness, may some pitying spirit turn aside the thought, and strike out my unhappy name from his remembrance!</P>

<SPEAKER>W. Wom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed and indeed, my Lady, I was innocently going into the eating-parlour for your Ladyship's netting-box, not thinking any body was there, when I saw a sea-officer in his uniform, looking earnestly at your Ladyship's portrait over the chimney; his back was to∣wards me, so I did not know who it was; and on I went, thinking no offence, when suddenly he turn'd upon me; and then to be sure I gave a loud shriek, discovering him to be Captain Dormer.</P>

<P>Does he know I am in this house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W. Wom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know, Madam! to be sure he knows your Ladyship is married to my Lord; for he ask'd me if the portrait was not drawn for you, which you know I cou'd not deny;—and then he ask'd me how it came in this house, and so I told him you was married to my Lord, which is nothing but the truth—and then, mer∣cy on me, how he started! so I thought I wou'd say no more; but as I was going, Ma∣dam, he took me by the hand and held me, and then he ask'd me half a hundred questions, all in a breath, so that I knew not what to answer; but telling him that your Ladyship wanted me up stairs, away I run—and if I have done any thing amiss, I heartily ask your Ladyship's pardon.</P>

<P>No, on my honour—please to pro∣ceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope she is yet living; 'tis a long time since I heard from her: she is the only re∣lation I have left; an orphan girl, my Lord; and if she is still at Antwerp, where I left her, I can scarce hope to see her before I am order'd out again. To her I have bequeath'd the earn∣ings of my service, and in the mean time made suitable provision for her support:—if you, who are the founder of my fortune, will kindly
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
undertake this friendly trust and suffer me to deposite in your care an orphan charge, you will put me under everlasting obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Heaven, this is too much! <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Sir!—Mr. Dormer!—I am sensible of the honour you do me—but you must think I am a man not used to business of this sort—the com∣mission is a very delicate commission:—the charge of a young lady—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is a very sacred charge—I feel it such; and therefore ardently would wish to rest it with a man of honour. I am sensible of my presumption; I know I am imposing trouble, where I ought only to be paying gratitude;—but, my Lord Davenant, I have no friends ex∣cept in my own profession; they cannot ferve me on this occasion. You are my only hope; and, as you have once taken me by the hand, I pray you do not let it go: I am bold to hope I shall not bring discredit on your protection, and I shall be through life devoted to you for the favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am distressed; and if I do not answer you to your wish, it is because I'm sensi∣ble I do not merit the good opinion you repose in me:—you will allow me some time to reflect on what you desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means: I would not take your friendship by surprize. One thing I should na∣turally have stated to you before; but since I entered your Lordship's house, I have been in∣formed
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
of a circumstance, that makes the men∣tion of it a matter of some embarrassment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What may that circumstance be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you have the happiness to call a Lady your's, whom I had once the au∣dacity to aspire to;—Miss Travers I am told is Lady Davenant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is she interested in this business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship having been privy to my passion for your most amiable Lady, I may be allowed to say to you, that it was my first passion and will be my last. Her uncle's op∣position, and her better destiny, traversed my too ambitious hopes, and reserved her to a worthier choice. Though there was something harder than I could have expected in her manner of dismissing me, still, upon reflection, I cannot condemn the lady, who had prudence to reject an insolent pretender with the scorn he merited: nay, I am vain enough to flatter myself, her uncle dictated expressions that did not originate with her:—be that as it may, I have bequeathed my fortune to her upon failure of my sister and her heirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Astonishing! when did you take this resolution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I was far enough from think∣ing I should ever see her more; after the action, when I was despaired of from my wounds: and though I do not wish your Lordship to report
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
this to Lady Davenant, I hope it will be a mo∣tive with you for undertaking the trust, when so dear a part of you has an eventual interest in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>So dear a part of me! 'Tis plain that she is such to you; and that her refusal has not yet extinguished your affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Lord, her honour and her happiness are still as dear to me as my own; no other object can ever interpose to draw off my attachment: having once had the honour of be∣ing regarded by her, I can never descend to think of any other woman; and I hope I have already convinced your Lordship, that, so far from bearing enmity to the happy man who pos∣sesses her, I rejoice to find that the object of her love and the friend of my life is one and the same person. I therefore once again entreat you to take my sister also into your protection; and you will then have in charge every thing I hold valuable upon earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is really so extraordinary, that I must wonder on what grounds you rest a confi∣dence in me so full and so implicit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>To say the truth, I follow Lady Dave∣nant's choice; persuaded I may trust my in∣terests where she reposes her's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose, for a moment, that compulsion, and not choice, determined Lady Davenant to ally herself to me.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! I'll not suppose it for a moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, let me put a stronger case—Suppose this idol of your soul should raise no ecstacies in mine—What if this angel of per∣fection should to me appear the most indifferent of women?—In plainer words, what would you say, if Lady Davenant was the object of my fix'd aversion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would I say!—but I forbear, and understand such suppositions as a civil inti∣mation that 'tis time I took my leave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, by no means: I've much to say to you.</P>

<P>If what extinguishes my happiness, deprives me of my reason, can I help it? If you have seen him, known him, and convers'd with him, direct me where he is, and I'll assert my right; for if he was my father, by the Power that made me—</P>

<P>Where did this meeting pass? you have not left the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw him from my window in his chariot; there was a noise and uproar in the street; some fray between his servants and the driver of a hackney carriage:—he had let down the glass, and stopt his chariot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are you sure 'twas he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too sure: no sooner did my eye glance on his person, than, terror-struck, and scarce myself, I ran down to the door, went out, and call'd to him to stop, for now the carriages were disengag'd—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did he then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>He stopt, lookt out, discover'd me, and calling eagerly to his coachman, drove fu∣riously away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Infamous wretch! abuser of your unprotected innocence! hypocrite, that counter-feiting
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
piety, stole into the sanctuary of virtue, and robb'd the altar of its holiest relick!—I never lik'd his story; always thought his sanctified ap∣proaches, under cloak of mock benevolence and pity, were suspicious: then his pretended death, and the inscrutable darkness succeeding it, were proofs demonstrative of fraud. My life upon't, he is some titled profligate. Have you no marks to trace him by? the equipage, arms, liveries? did you not note them?—thro' the earth I will pursue him to detection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was incapable of such remarks: I have sent my servant amongst the neighbours; his equipage was gay and splendid, and 'tis possible it may be known—but what ensues, when it is known?—distraction, death.—Oh, leave me, Charles, renounce me, banish my misfortunes from your thoughts, and may some happier woman—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madness is in the thought: never will I forsake thee; never, by all that's sacred, whilst I live, will I acknowledge any other wife: in thy embrace is center'd all my happiness;—here, here, my lovely Marianne, I will both live and die.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, my dearest Charles, altho' my soul doats on you, can I for your sake suffer it?—ought I for my own?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you not then my wife? who shall oppose it? Have you any other husband?
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
Let the world's laws interpret as they may, by right of Heaven's decree you are mine: let him that forg'd the lye, fall by the lye. What if the records of his death were false?—you thought them true; and in persuasion of their truth, you married: therefore he's dead to you, tho' he survives to villainy;—the husband is ex∣tinct, tho' the impostor lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>For me, who am the child of sorrow, friendless and obscure, the world's opinions are no rule of right; Heaven and my conscience give the law to me—but oh! to sink your fame and fortune, bury all your splendid hopes, your active talents—it is not to be thought of: no, your friends, your family, your country claims you: misfortune is my birth-right; I am en∣compass'd with a sphere of wretchedness, and every one is blighted that approaches me: an orphan in the cradle; one brave youth, one dear beloved brother, was the cordial of my life—of him perhaps I am bereft.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Providence restores him to you: this sad accident so fill'd my thoughts, or I had sooner told you the good tidings of your brother.—Dormer's arriv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he arriv'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is arriv'd, and crown'd with glory, crown'd with fortune: you are the sister of a hero, who will stand recorded in his coun∣try's brightest annals: interest might solicit your
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
alliance; pride might boast of it; even misers now might court the sister of the wealthy Dor∣mer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will not despair: amidst the clouds and darkness of my fate, Heaven yet shall visit me with one bright gleam of hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we shall still be happy; I feel my spirits lighten; my love to you is not a brutal heat; 'tis founded on the graces of your mind; brighten'd, but not blinded, by the charms of your person. I have no part to act; to Dormer, to my father, to the world I will avow my claim; I'll seek your brother, join him in dragging forth to light this dark Mysterious Husband. To this I pledge my word; till this be done, however painful the suspense, however dear the sacrifice, I am your friend, not hus∣band.—Come, come then, thou soft affliction, quiet thy distracted thoughts—all things will yet be well.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who! you and I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly so: a pair as perfect as ini∣quity e'er matcht. We trick'd this marriage
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
neatly; did we not?—fine cheats, to pass these letters off upon your niece and Dormer—neat forgeries they were; and precious gulls the lovers, to be trapp'd so readily. But you are secret now; true to the gang; you did not blab this to Lady Davenant?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean? I blab it! I to Lady Davenant!</P>

<P>You. If you dare, deny it.</P>

<P>Deny it! no, I cannot absolutely deny it; but who could think she would be fool enough to broach it?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first that broach'd it was the fool. You've set the mischief running; now drain the bitter cup of your affliction to its lowest and it's foulest dregs. Dormer shall know the plot, which hand in hand we've prac∣tis'd to deceive him. The passion which was dead in him shall rise again: I'll urge them on, enflame them to renew'd desires; and, when their stimulated hearts rush to forbidden tran∣sports, then, in that guilty moment, you and I, like brother villains, will steal in with silent steps, and seast upon the ruin we have made.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>You stole her from an honest man, and sold her to a Lord. Now get you home: weigh these things well in your discerning mind; put truth in one scale, titles in the other; and, when you've struck the balance, come and compare accounts with me, and we'll divide the gains.</P>

He said he'd tell the plot to Dormer, make them both desperately in love afresh, and put them together; a proof of jealousy:—he said he execrated his wife; a proof he loves her: and what are love and jea∣lousy but madness? how his poor brains are tumbled topsy-turvy! I pity him at my heart. I must look sharp, and watch this Dormer close∣ly; if I discover them at their old tricks, I shall make bold to read this niece of mine a good round lecture: when so many heads are gone astray, 'tis lucky for the world that some folks have their wits about them.</P>

<P>O Dormer, was it light affliction to a heart like mine to be depriv'd of all it held most dear?

Why should I accuse him of unkind∣ness? What could such a match produce but misery?—the efforts that I made to please him, though they cost me dear, could not impose on his sagacity; the labour'd tasks of duty poorly counterfeit the genuine glow of love.</P>

<P>Sir Edmund Travers, I wou'd re∣commend it to you to keep your own temper, and not practise upon mine too far: And let me tell you, Sir, there is a mean and tricking quality in all you do. When hearts like ours are rent asunder by device and cunning—when forgery's base artifice is call'd in aid to separate affections, they will meet again, in spite of Hell itself: And if you have stolen by surprize upon that tender moment, when the most rigid virtue softens to endearment, beware of false con∣clusions; nor from the foulness of your own imagination, judge of our's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine talking! but as I have not out∣liv'd my senses; am in possession of my eyes and ears; and have unluckily some interest in the re∣putation of my own niece, I shall take the li∣berty

of appealing to Lord Davenant against such proceeding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I do beseech you, undeceive your uncle; I suspect he does not know the treatment you receive; he could not else thus obstinately persist to ruin you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave us together then, and I will speak: retire into that room—nay, I request you will. <STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> Dormer.]</STAGE> Now give me patient hearing:—'tis not from consciousness of guilty, nor to avoid a fair discussion of my sentiments for Captain Dormer, I wou'd wish you to desist; but from a knowledge, which you have not, of Lord Davenant's disposition. You think him a kind husband:—because I've troubled you with no complaints, you think I've none to make: you are in an error; and so long as error caus'd content, I left you in it; now that it wou'd lead to misery, I warn you of it's danger. My Lord and I are on the point to part: hitherto he has no shadow of complaint against me; if you re∣solve to give him one, give this, report this in∣discretion, swell it into criminality; perhaps he'll thank you for the office; but the time will come, when you'll reproach yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Edm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this you think will blind me;—you mistake, I see your drift; I know you are unhappy with your Lord, but I also know it is your attachment to Dormer, and his return that make you so; Lord Davenant told me so him∣self;—the fault is all your own; you have driven
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
him mad. Now therefore, if you will solemnly engage your word to me never to see Dormer again, I'll stifle what is past; I'll still acknow∣ledge you, protect you, and if Lord Davenant then abandons you, I'll receive you in my house—Now what do you say? I put you to the proof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis fairly offer'd; but if every earthly comfort was in your disposal, and they cou'd only be obtain'd by my renouncing ab∣solutely and for ever all future friendly inter∣course with that much injur'd man, I wou'd reject 'em on such terms:—when I've said this, I must implore you not to pass unfair con∣structions on my resolution; for if you can still suspect me, I will pledge my honour to you, never to receive his visits, but in your's or other company:—will that content you?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I HAVE now, Captain Dormer, told you without reserve the whole, as it has pass'd between your sister and myself, to the mi∣nutest circumstance; and I wait your answer, without foreseeing what that may be; for hitherto your silence has been such as gives no light to guess at your opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard your story with the deepest attention, for it involves the fortune of an or∣phan sister, in whose happiness I am closely in∣terested, and of whose reputation I am the right∣ful protector.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you find any cause for discontent in my proceeding, tell it me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find no cause whatever for complaint; but many many proofs I find of generous manly honesty;—and thus with open arms I take you to my heart, and lodge you there till it shall cease to beat. When I've said this, I must confess to you there are some painful incidents in your re∣lation. My sister's marriage in Flanders I must consider as precipitate and rash; the evidence of Brooke's decease at Paris was too readily ad∣mitted;
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
and the now distressful state of your engagement might have been avoided by those obvious precautions which your interest pointed out. Your marriage also is clandestine; such are rarely happy; and tho' Lord Davenant's consent wou'd be no recommendation of it to me, methinks it should have been an indispen∣sable preliminary to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel the force of all you say. The vehemence of my affection may have out-stept prudence, and my want of confidence in my father may have violated duty, but towards your lovely sister I should hope I stand without reproach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot doubt your honour, and you'll suffer me to add, there does not live a man on earth I should be so proud to call my brother. Here we must pause—till we have trac'd the villain out who has abus'd her con∣fidence, and by a feign'd decease plung'd her and you in this distress and doubt, no self-in∣dulging passion must be suffer'd to complete the yet suspended marriage—this promise you will make?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>And keep religiously—As for disco∣very, his equipage I hope will lead to that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Perhaps it will; if that should be the case, remember, Captain Davenant, 'tis to me he must account. Now I'll go to my sister.</P>

<P>Do so:—I am sure I need not warn you to speak tenderly to Marianne: commend

<P>No wonder you shou'd wish to avoid me, for you have done a base unmanly injury to a defenceless orphan; by a pretended ge∣nerosity you stole into her good opinion, mar∣ried and abandoned her. Base as this is, there is a meanness in the act, that makes it more de∣testable than open villainy:—you counterfeited death; paltry expedient! which not only gives your tongue the lie, but stamps it on your life.—Draw then! defend yourself; for 'tis not now a counterfeited death, but the reality, that must determine one of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take your own course; I shall repel assault: but first, by way of caution, hear me:—'Twas once my chance, as it is now, to be call'd out by a rash angry boy, to answer with my sword for an imputed injury to a lady, whom he took on himself to protect. I met him, for his rage was deaf to reason: being master of the sword, I soon disarmed my hot antagonist:—when I had given him life, I gave him proof of his mistake:—the youth was satisfied, and sav'd. A second instance may not be so happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you; but the proofs, which in his instance follow'd, now precede our interview. You'll not deny the equipage was your's; that you was in it; that my sister saw you, call'd out to you to stop: you did; but, looking out, discover'd her, and basely took to flight?—these facts bring home to you unanswer∣able

proof, and leave you nothing but con∣fession and atonement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>This arrogance compels me to an act, which, in compassion to your youth, and the misfortunes that hang over it, I fain would have avoided.

</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? your words alarm me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>His situation would alarm you more: some strange disorder suddenly has seiz'd him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say rather some strange passion of the mind.—You told him of my marriage?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, and he receiv'd it like a stroke of death; his frame convuls'd with passion.—I must for ever lament your not consulting him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does he resent it highly?</P>
</SP>
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>We'll talk of that hereafter; for the present you must avoid an interview. If you remain in the house, retire to your own chamber, and let her accompany you;—take Mr. Dor∣mer with you too.—Go, my dear child, go with your friend—so you may call him still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heart's too full to utter what it feels.—In the expressive language of your eyes I read my melancholy fate.—Farewell!</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Exit with</HI> Davenant.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, you'll follow that unhappy pair;—or do you wait to spring some new de∣tection?—Fie upon you!—What blemish does your scrutinizing eye discover, that you so sted∣fastly peruse me over?—Oh, that a taint so sickly as suspicion should find admittance in a hero's breast!</P>

<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE><HI>[runs to</HI> Lady Davenant, <HI>and falls at her feet]</HI></STAGE>
<P>Hear me, divine Louisa, hear your re∣pentant Dormer:—let me kneel for pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, rise!—this is no time for ex∣planation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop not my words, now they have found their way, but let me pour them and my tears, thus kneeling at your feet.—Before my tyes lose sight of you, confirm my pardon; tell me you forgive what my impatient phrenzy, what my mad suspicion utter'd.—Penitence ne'er struck a human heart more deep than mine.—Daemons have curs'd the sun, I have done more—I have arraign'd thy virtue.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, I desire you, rise! you have my full forgiveness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! first and last sole object of my heart! how can I thank thee as I ought?</P>
<STAGE>[Kisses her hand.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>If to regain and keep your place in my affection is your wish, spare the attempt to thank me, nor by this warmth of passion draw aside my thoughts from the sad theme that fills them. That I have lov'd you, Dor∣mer, and still love, superior to disguise, ac∣cept my free confession; but when example meets me of the precipitancy of passion in Da∣venant's case; of the deceitfulness of gratitude in Marianne's; I will be guided only by esteem; and on your delicacy, on your discretion in this mournful crisis will depend, if that affection which I now acknowledge shall subsist or cease.</P>
<STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>The air is fresher here: motion re∣vives me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish it may: and yet your colour changes; your eyes look heavy, and betoken pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've wearied them with writing. Take the papers—This to my son; to Lady Davenant this; and this to Dormer.—Ah!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that? another pang?—and now
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
it shakes you like an ague fit: pray be per∣suaded; let your physician be sent for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can he do? my wounds are in the soul. Give me your arm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>How cold your hand is on me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter: 'twill pass off.—I'm better now. Make all things ready. I will be gone to night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you travel with these pains upon you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall feel no pains upon my journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, my Lord, you are not fit to undertake your journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear so too:—but, be that as it may, let me have all things ready. Have you put up those parchments for my son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are in the box, seal'd and directed for Mr. Davenant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very well—now tell my Lady that I desire to see her.—A word with you be∣fore you go:—You will find I have not forgot your services; they wou'd have done credit to a better cause; but as I have put you now above necessity, I hope I have put you above mean∣ness also.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has not been my choice, but my misfortune. I shall send Lady Davenant to you, and hope she will prevail with you to postpone your journey.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Lord Davenant.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>My journey must be quickened,
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
not postponed.—This medicine works too slowly;—but here's a remedy of more dispatch:—Apply it then!—Misery like mine acquits the suicide; when law strikes short, justice should arm the culprit's hand.—The occasion's apt:—In death there's but one pang, in life a thousand thousand multiplied calamities.—Now, now I'll do it.—Hah! I'm interrupted.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lady Davenant.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am told you have been seized with sudden indisposition;—what is the matter?—How are you affected?—Are you resolved upon departing immediately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am resolved: my mind is gone be∣fore me; and when I am departed, I shall be∣queath you to your heart's first choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you meditate?—Your words, your looks are ominous. What was that thing you huddled in your bosom, as I entered?—My Lord, my Lord, beware of self-destruc∣tion!—Your bosom labours, your breath flut∣ters, and your eyes—Oh horrible! what are these ghastly symptoms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>If any consolation could have rescued me, thine would have been the medicine of my mind;—thou would'st have been the saving an∣gel, thou most excellent, most injured of wo∣men!—But I have sate in council with my rea∣son, ransack'd all the resources of my soul, and questioned every rising thought, if it could show me hope:—In all my composition, there is not one trace; night and despair possess me, and there is nothing like a ray of light, save only
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
what the mortal drug administers, that now is sapping the strong-hold of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poison!—Oh let me fly, and bring you instant help.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, I command you:—Assistance is too late; nor would I suffer it, if it came.—'Sdeath! I were a beast without a soul;—I, that Have kept my station with the highest, now to sink where infamy won't own me;—the outcast of society, the pointing-stock of scorn, and feed on offal scraps of pity, thrown by charitable fools, to comfort me!—it is not to be borne!—Despair seized me, and I took poison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not extreme with him in judg∣ment, merciful Disposer!—He comes, but not in confidence:—despair compels him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you.—O Louisa! best of women!—if I had confidence to pray, it should be for such blessings on your future days, as might redeem and recompence your sufferings past. And yet I'll strive—Oh horrible! it must not be.—My soul is rent with agony:—Methought, as I looked up, I saw a thousand threatening faces, that forbade my prayer. Oh hide me in your arms!—Stand off again! lest I infect and stain your purity with my unholy touch.—Blest may you be! thrice blest in Dor∣mer's arms!—May Heaven shower down on your united hearts perpetual harmony and love! And for the hateful barrier of my life, thus, thus I burst it—</P>

<P>The agonies of death are on him. Assist me to take him off:—I can't support him;—he will die upon the floor.</P>

<SP>

<P>Yes, yes, 'tis over!—tell not my son the cause till I am dead. This was the only kindness I could shew him. I am sorry to pre∣sent a spectacle so bloody to you both: but poison work'd too sluggishly, nor could I bear its agonies—oh keep her from the sight of me!—she comes—</P>

<P>Then let me die;—let my heart burst at once, and bury me for ever in oblivion.</P>
</SP>

<P>No, whilst my arms, my friendship can uphold you, you shall never fall.—Come from the body, Charles:—cease to contemplate that bloody object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but be silent—it is done—he's dead.—I will be dumb henceforth; but have some care of me, for if my reason fails, and not remembering he was my father, I shou'd shock nature's hearing with a curse, 'twill be the brain's depravity, and not the heart's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, unhappy friends, my spirits will not serve to give you consolation; but let us patiently await, and it will come from Heaven:—the same dispensing hand, that to the blameless bosom deals the wound, will in its own good time administer the cure.</P>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Miss <HI>YOUNGE.</HI></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>TO-night two sketches we've held up to view,</L>
<L>One of the old school, t'other of the new.</L>
<L>As for my Lady's portrait, I can't boast</L>
<L>Its likeness, for the original is lost:</L>
<L>In times foregone the colouring might be good,</L>
<L>But now it scarce resembles flesh and blood:</L>
<L>The pencil's chaste—but where, I wou'd demand,</L>
<L>Are the soft touches of a modern hand?</L>
<L>Where the fond languish that our masters steal?</L>
<L>The tempting bosom that our dames reveal?</L>
<L>Where the high plume that speaks the towering soul?</L>
<L>Where the bright gloss that varnishes the whole?</L>
<L>The habit regimental, smart cockade,</L>
<L>And the neat ankle roguishly display'd?</L>
<L>None, none of these—a piece of mere still life,</L>
<L>Where not one feature marks the modern wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lay the good dame aside—and now behold</L>
<L>My Lord appears!—These tints are fresh and bold;</L>
<L>This is the life itself. Mark! what a grace</L>
<L>Beams in his high-born tyranny of face!</L>
<L>He breathes; he speaks. Cards, harlots, horses, dice</L>
<L>Croud the back-ground with attributes of vice:</L>
<L>This, this is something like; these colours give</L>
<L>Some semblance of a man: <HI>'Tis so we live,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Tis so we look,</HI> you cry—behold once more!</L>
<L>The suicide is welt'ring in his gore.</L>
<L>Hah! does it strike you? say, do you still cry,</L>
<L><HI>'Tis so we live?—</HI>so live, and so you'll die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But one word more on <HI>Lady Davenant</HI>'s part,</L>
<L>We hope 'tis Nature; you believe it Art.</L>
<L>Search your own bosoms; if you find her there</L>
<L>'Tis well: if not, I wou'd to Heaven she were!</L>
