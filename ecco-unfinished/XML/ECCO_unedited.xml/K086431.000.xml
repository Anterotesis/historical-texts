<HEAD>THE TWINS, OR, THE FEMALE TRAVELLER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the reign of Queen Anne, whose memory is still dear to millions, there lived in the county of Glou∣cester a merchant, who had acquired by traffick a sufficient fortune to make him easy the remainder of his days. He was blest by heaven with a tender wife, and two lovely children, a son and daughter; beautiful twins, so like each other, as not to be distinguish∣ed without a strict examination. Their educa∣tion and early promise of virtue, gave the utmost joy to the fond parents.</P>
<P>The indulgent father (not caring to trust his darling son Frederick out of his sight) well know∣ing that in common schools, youth often imbibe vice that plunges them into evils too stubhorn to be conquer'd, provided a tutor for him in his own house, whom we shall call Mentor; where, in a few years, he drank such large draughts of learning, that he was able to instruct others.</P>
<P>But what was more extraordinary, his beauti∣ful sister Lucretia equall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him in every branch of learning, unless in those robust exercises that did not become the tenderness of that delicate sex.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>The parents, happy as this world could make them in two such lovely children, were the joy and delight of all that had the happiness to know them; and would often dress their blooming daughter in her brother's cloaths, to innocently impose on their frequent visitants, whose com∣mon mistakes would create mirth for the whole company.</P>
<P>Thus the time pass'd away in virtuous plea∣sures, 'till the admired twins had reach'd their fourteenth year, without the least cloud of sor∣row to damp their joys; but before the year was expired, death snatch'd the virtuous mother from an inconsolable husband, and lamenting children, who notwithstanding their learning, had not phi∣losophy enough to stop their sighs, or dry their tears. However time, that wears away memory, or removes it at a greater distance (for if grief were to continue with the same force that it be∣gins, the strongest and wisest person upon earth could not bear it) drove away incessant sorrow, tho' whole ages would never obliterate the cause of their grief.</P>
<P>The pious father, now fixt his only future Comfort upon the loved pledges she had left be∣hind her, and began to think it was time his son should travel to improve his observations of the world, tho' it was a new death to think of parting with him. His former traffick to several distant climates, with an unblemish'd character, had gain'd him friends in most places of Europe, where he intended his son should visit; but the sor∣rows, sighs and tears that were shed at parting of the Father, Son, and Sister, are not to be ex∣press'd in words; and their parent a thousand times repented the fatal separation. However,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
the appointed day arrived, which we will draw a veil over to hide their tender parting.</P>
<P>In company with our young traveller, went a relation, whose name was Ferdinand, a young∣er brother to an ancient family, much of the same age, and the same promises of growing virtue; which was some consolation for the terrible part∣ing with his dear father, and lovely sister, who had now pass'd the age of seventeen; a time dangerous to the amiable sex, adorn'd with beau∣ty, and endow'd with fortune; yet
<Q><L>When love's well tim'd, 'tis not a Fault to love;</L>
<L>The strong, the brave, the virtuous and the wise,</L>
<L>Sink in the soft captivity together.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the least particle of that flame had not yet reach'd her breast; she was courted by many, even with the consent of her father, who told her, that he would not have her give her hand, but where she could bestow her heart. Lucretia thank'd him for his tender regard he had for her peace and repose, yet begg'd she might not turn her mind to think of the wedlock-state; repeating at the same time these lines:
<Q><L>O let not marriage tempt me to my ruin.</L>
<L>Trust not to man; they are by nature false,</L>
<L>Dissembling, subtle, cruel, and inconstant:</L>
<L>When a man talks of love, with caution hear him;</L>
<L>But if he swears, he'll certainly deceive me.</L></Q>
Well! my child, reply'd the father, I am well pleased at thy caution; it shows thy wisdom; but then, in answer to your author, I must reply in the poetic strain, tho' a thing I am seldom prone to.
<Q><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<L>When hearts and minds are pair'd above,</L>
<L>There is no harmony like love.</L></Q>
Alas! my dear father, return'd the daughter, were we to search the <HI>Poets</HI>, we could find many arguments on both sides; therefore I once more beg we may drop the subject, and grant me more time e'er I launch on the turbulent sea of ma∣trimony, that too often proves the shipwreck of our peace; for I must own, the various lovers that pretend to offer me their vows, seem mon∣sters all, and ready to devour me. I have no room yet in my breast, but duty for you, and a sisterly love for my dear brother; therefore I once more beg you wou'd dismiss 'em all, who knows, but some quarrel may ensue, and blood may be the consequences, which would kill my peace of mind for ever.</P>
<P>The father was so much moved with her good sense and open heart, that he comply'd with her desires, and dismiss'd her retinue of lovers with all the decency he could, yet all would not take his counsel to withdraw; two of them still wou'd force themselves into the house; and being both powerful men, of good education and fortunes, the father, without the breach of hospitality and good manners, could not decently get rid of them; neither had he indeed any objection to ei∣ther of them for a son-in-law, but his daughter's aversion to wedlock, which time might remove. <HI>Lucretia</HI> still follow'd her studies so ardently, as if she had every thing to learn, which gave her father some uneasiness, fearing it should impair her health; therefore, he prevail'd upon her to learn music and dancing; the latter she had learnt, when a child, but had been so thirsty af∣ter
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
knowledge of a sublimer stamp, that had thrust it out of her memory; however, to please so good a father, at proper times, she learnt of her masters, and soon attain'd perfection both in music and dancing. I have seen music and songs of her own composition, that would not discredit the greatest masters.</P>
<P>Now two months were stole away, and no tydings from our young travellers, which gave the utmost terror to the father and the fair <HI>Lu∣cretia</HI>, who expected to hear from him weekly. This severe disappointment, with the vexation and importunity the young ladies two lovers gave her, almost distracted her. The father sent to all his former correspondents abroad; but their answers gave no information, either of him, or his companion. <HI>What a wretch</HI>, wou'd the father cry, <HI>was I to part with my dear son, the staff of my declining age! and send him to meet a fate that might have been avoided</HI>; yet sometimes the flatterer hope, would steal in and comfort them; that a thousand accidents might fall to prevent their hearing from him.</P>
<P>The continual agitations of the mourning fa∣ther's mind wrought so much upon him, that the decay of his body seem'd to denote a dissolu∣tion from his soul, and the image of death ap∣pear'd before him. When he found he was sum∣mon'd to the eternal regions, he call'd his lovely daughter to approach his bed, who attended, all drown'd in tears. <HI>I am going</HI>, (said her fa∣ther) <HI>to pay that debt we all are bound to nature. Grief for the loss of my beloved son, has hasten'd my journey, for I am convinced he is no longer in this world; had he a being here, I am assured by
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
this time, we should have heard from him. Thou, my lovely and surviving child, must dry thy tears, when I am laid in earth. Remember the dead are happy, freed from the cares and troubles of the world. The living mourn for themselves; most of the pangs I feel are from leaving thee behind; but thy knowlodge and virtue will, I hope, sustain thee from the fallacious mazes of this world, and guide thy unerring steps. I have finish'd my will in thy behalf, where all I have is thine, save a few le∣gacies to my faithful servants.—See my corps be laid in the same grave with my dear wife, and heaven for ever bless thee!</HI> After this he mur∣mur'd to himself a short prayer, and sent his last breath into the bosom of his lovely daughter, who was ready to accompany him in death, with the weighty burthen of her sorrows.</P>
<P>Now was this amiable creature left an orphan, tho' the care of her fortune, by her father's will, was entirely at her own disposal, without a guardian, tho' she had but just reach'd her 18th year. Never child shew'd a more sincere sor∣row for a parent's loss than she did; yet her good sense inform'd her, tears could not revive the dead.</P>
<P>Mentor, her brother's tutor, remain'd still in the house, and prov'd very serviceable to her in settling her affairs. Business is often an allay to grief, while idleness and sloth nourish vice; yet all her worldly affairs could not bury the melancholy thoughts of her father and brother's death.</P>
<P>After her time of business seem'd over, her two troublesome lovers began to try if her father's death had not alter'd her mind; but all their eloquence could not prevail; she appear'd more
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
inflexible than ever; gave them to understand that she was mistress of herself, would remain so, and not put her liberty in the power of ano∣ther. One of them took this as a final denial, but the other, either being more in love, or resolving to be more obstinate, plagued her still with his passion; and when he could not see her, pester'd her with loving epistles, which she has constantly committed to the flames. Finding these had no effect, he had recourse to stratagems; but all were baffled by the good conduct of the virtuous young lady. At last, by bribes to one of her maids, he gain'd admittance into her apartment in the night, and after intreaties fail'd, would have used force; but the courageous lady, snatch∣ing up a pistol from the window, drove him with his trembling fears out of the house, and the next morning turn'd her faithless servant after him.</P>
<P>For some time she heard no more of him; but one morning early walking in her garden to in∣dulge her sorrows, she was of a sudden seiz'd by three fellows, and this impious lover at the head of them. He gain'd by his gold the key of the garden, thro' the means of that treacherous servant she had turn'd away. When he had hurry'd the poor lady out of the garden unseen by any, he forced her on horseback, and thro' by-roads brought her to a house in a forrest, suitable to his barbarous intention, tho' adorn'd with water, woods and lawns; when the wretch had secur'd Lucretia in a chamber, he let her know there she should remain, till she consented to marry him, and fixt the time within the month; and if she would not consent, when that time was expired, he would try another method. The sorrowful Lucretia made him no reply,
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
which so provoked the Knight, he sullenly left her to her own thoughts; but to make an ad∣dition to her grief, he sent the very wretch to attend her, that had brought her to this calamity.</P>
<P>The virtuous Lucretia, tho' in this distress, drew courage out of honesty, and determin'd to suffer death, rather than lose her honour; nei∣ther did the monster's threats disarm her of her reason. Her soul was too great to shed tears on this occasion. She resolved to try the dishonest attendant, and as gold had corrupted her to a deed that was vicious, she had some hopes, it might turn the ballance on the side of virtue, but to no purpose, the wretch delighted more in evil than good, and told her plainly, she was glad it was in her power to be reveng'd of her for putting her out of her service.</P>
<P>How do'st thou know, reply'd Lucretia, but I may comply with this furious man, and make one article in our agreement to punish thee! where is then they hope, or revenge?</P>
<P>Why indeed, reply'd the wretch, there is some reason in what you say, but I know you so well, I am assured you will not punish yourself, as you call it, to punish me, therefore I will stick to my first principle; besides I have the best part of my reward before-hand.</P>
<P>This reply, struck the poor lady dumb, how∣ever, her thoughts were not idle, and the more to indulge them; she turn'd her face towards the window that look'd over the garden wall into a footpath that run thro' the wood, where she per∣ceiv'd her Mentor in disguise of a peasant, ob∣serving the avenues to the house: Her heart was reviv'd at the sight, she took an opportunity to shew herself, while the maid was in the out∣ward
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
room, and by signs gave him to understand she durst not speak to him. She had a pencil in her pocket, and a small book call'd the <HI>Govern∣ment of the Tongue</HI>, written by the Author of the <HI>Whole Duty of Man</HI>. She tore out a blank leaf and wrote the following lines.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Mentor</HI>,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Am here in the dreadful agonies of death, or loss of honour, which is worse than death, forced from my house, by that impious villain Sir <HI>T. F.</HI> I have not time to say more.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>LUCRETIA.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>When the note was finish'd, she wrapt it about her bodkin, threw it over the wall with all her strength, and had the satisfaction to see him take it up, but her vile attendant coming in that mo∣ment, she durst not observe more. The innocent Lucretia at this discovery seem'd better pleas'd; hope dawn'd in her countenance, and cast a lustre over her clouded beauty, which was taken notice of by her attendant.</P>
<P>Why madam, cry'd this wicked woman, your mind seems more compos'd than it was, I fancy we shall reconcile you to your fortune, women's passions are of short duration, I don't doubt but you'll forgive the Knight, and then a pardon for me comes of course. I can't tell, reply'd the lady, our fate will be obey'd.</P>
<P>The servant ran immediately to acquaint her master with this seeming good news, who made as much haste to be inform'd of the reality from Lucretia's own mouth, who gave him such doubtful answers that seem'd to cherish hope more than despair; he began to make excuses
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
for his proceeding, and lay the fault on his ex∣cess of love. Left her with transports in his countenance that seem'd to say he did not doubt his happiness.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Harpsicord</HI> in the chamber, and the more to deceive 'em, she sat her down and sung the following song, the words and music of her own composing.
<Q><L>The sight of meads, and purling streams,</L>
<L>Will sooth the sorrows in my breast,</L>
<L>Come balmy slumbers, chearful dreams,</L>
<L>And lull my troubled soul to rest.</L></Q>
Her <HI>music</HI>, and harmonious voice, soon drew the knight to listen to her song, with raptures. He told his wicked associate that a day or two more her mind would be set at rest, and he did not doubt but in a little time she would be dis∣pos'd to make him happy.</P>
<P>When she had done singing, he enter'd the room, paying her a thousand fulsom compli∣ments on her voice, &amp;c. which she seem'd not to be displeas'd with, but beg'd he would give her leave to rest, to recover her fright, and fa∣tigue. This the knight took as a good omen, af∣ter making several ridiculous compliments, sub∣missively retir'd, taking her attendant along with him; but had caution enough to lock the door of her outward appartment, and put the key in his pocket. This was observed by the lady, with no little concern; however, she was at more leisure to comtemplate her misfortune. She of∣ten look'd with wishing eyes towards the wood for the tutor, but in vain. While she was think∣ing, with her back towards the window, she
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
heard something strike against it, and fall down in the garden, she look'd out, yet could not per∣ceive any one that threw it; but to her mortifi∣cation, beheld a paper under the window. She was at her wits end; for if the Knight found it, she knew her scheme of liberty would prove abortive. But as heaven ever guards the good and just, she was put out of this dilemma, by observing a reil of fishing lines on the chimney-piece, and as Lucretia had often taken that inno∣cent diversion, she hoped to succeed in her under∣taking; she took off one of the longest lines from the reel, which was loaded with lead near the hook, and after many essays brought up the dangerous letter. She open'd it with trembling hands, aad found as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dearest Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Morning when we lost you, had near kill'd me and your faithful servants with grief; I own I soon thought who was the person that was guilty of such a crime, and immediately got a disguise from one of your tenants, in order to find you out. Take comfort good lady, to-morrow in the middle of the night, I'll gain your liberty, or die in the attempt, therefore wait drest with patience till then, for your sincere and faithful humble ser∣vant</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MENTOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>If this note had fallen into the hands of the Knight, all had been prevented, but now she went to rest, after a slight repast, and slept with a heart more at ease. In the morning she rose early, drest herself, and waited with impatience for the hour of her freedom. The appointed time came, but no deliverer appear'd, what was her anxiety!
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
when the morning dawn'd, and no hopes of li∣berty, the whole long, long day, and ensuing night past in the same tedious expectation, but to no purpose, nor in all that time had sleep once clos'd her eye-lids.</P>
<P>In the middle of the third night, while she was addressing her prayers to heaven, she was disturb∣ed in her meditations with the noise of her door being broke open, with the greatest violence, when four men mask'd, and disguis'd, enter'd her apartment; their leader took off his vizard, when she knew him to be her long expected Mentor. Her transport of joy was so great that not knowing what she did, she embraced him with the utmost tenderness: <HI>My dear deliverer</HI>, cry'd she, <HI>art thou come at last, when all hopes were fled? My dearest lady</HI>, reply'd <HI>Mentor, lose no time, but follow me, I'll tell you as we go the rea∣son of my delay</HI>. When they came to the garden wall, they help'd her over by a ladder to the o∣ther side, mounted her behind the tutor, and rode as fast as their horses could carry them, ne∣ver stopping till they arrived at the lady's house. The moment she was taken off her horse, the fatigue, want of rest, and the former troubles of her soul, threw her into a swoon, her maid ser∣vants put her to bed, and it was some hours e'er they could bring her to a sense of her liberty; but when she was assured of her safety at home, among her own servants, she would not taste food, or repose before she had thank'd Mentor for the signal service he had perform'd: she reach'd from her cabinet a bank bill of five hundred gui∣neas, which with great reluctance he accepted: <HI>I am over paid, madam</HI>, said he, <HI>in the action, good deeds are rewarded in themseles</HI>. He then
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
proceeded to tell her in what manner he accom∣plish'd his design, and the reason of his delay in the execution. 'When I left your ladyship, or rather the house where you was imprison'd, I went home in order to prevail upon your tenants to assist me in gaining your freedom, but found I had a harder task than I at first imagin'd; most of them had scruples, some thro' fear, and others guided by interest, alledging if they were found out, the Knight was a person of that power, he would find means to ruin them for their assist∣ing you, and it was two full days e'er I could bring matters to bear. Besides one of the per∣sons that gave us his assistance had brought a letter directed to your father; but hearing of his death, all the persuasions I was master of could not prevail upon him to deliver it to me, or tell me who he brought it from, and is resolv'd to give it into no hands but your own.'</P>
<P>This account rais'd Lucretia's curiosity, she sent for the person upon the instant, who appear∣ed in the habit of a sailor, tho' a carriage and behaviour that spoke him above the common sort. As soon as he enter'd, he said, "Madam, I know the fatigue and fears you have been in, will not allow this a proper time to read the contents of so long a letter, therefore, I beg you will defer it till the morning, when rest has com∣pos'd your mind and body." "Sir, return'd the lady, before I know the purport of that letter, I am well assured rest, or food, must be a stranger to me, therefore I beg you will not keep me any longer in the uncertain state of doubt." The messenger deliver'd the letter, she examin'd the direction, but could not find out the hand. She broke it open with some emotion, and casting
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
her eye upon the name at bottom, gave a great shriek, and fainted on the bed, where she sat; when she reviv'd, she kiss'd the name, and cry'd it was from her dear brother! she then proceeded to read the contents, which were as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Parent,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Doubt not but you will be surpriz'd at my long silence, and to receive this letter not of my own writing; but to clear that, a wound I receiv'd in my right hand obliges me to employ a friend upon this occasion. You know, my dear father, we set sail with a fair wind, which continued till we lost sight of my dear native country. The third day a violent storm arose, and we were compell'd to beat it about for fourteen days, submitting to the merciless winds and waves, and when it abated we found ourselves in the bay of <HI>Biscay,</HI> toss'd to and fro in such a manner by the swell of the sea, (tho' the winds were hush'd) that we were in danger of being shipwreck'd for several days. When the weather prov'd favourable, and the bil∣lows seem'd gone to rest, we pursued our voyage for the coast of <HI>France;</HI> but in the dusk of the even∣ing perceiv'd a vessel, that seem'd to labour to speak with us; we were not prepar'd for an enemy, there∣fore in the night chang'd our course, put out all our lights, in hopes to get from them; but when the morning dawn'd, we found our caution was to no purpose, for the vessel was not half a league off: Our chief hopes were, that she might prove a friend, but to our mortification, soon discover'd her <HI>Spanish</HI> colours. We crouded all our sails to get from her, but the wind falling, our vessel made but little way, and our pursuers making use of oars, soon came within gun-shot; we had but six small guns on board,
<PB N="$$" REF="16"/>
however the captain resolv'd to defend himself, and the passengers came into that resolution. The first discharge of their cannon, and small arms, shot down her colours, which I being eager to raise again, was wounded in the right hand by a musket ball, and our captain kill'd at the same time, with two suitors and a passenger; we return'd their fire, but did 'em but little damage, and we all thought it was the wisest way to submit, for resistance would prove but in vain. They on the instant enter'd our ship, and made prize of us. The captain of this freebooter was an <HI>Irishman,</HI> and us'd us with the greatest humanity, ordered his surgeon to dress my wound, and gave me all the accommodation his ves∣sell could afford. The prize did not answer his expectation, however that made no alteration in his kind treatment; nay he told us several times, as soon as he arriv'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> our ransoms should be very moderate, and he would send us home with the first conveniency. This generous usage lighten'd our sorrows, but it would not heal the grief of my wound, nor the anxiety I felt, that I could not in∣form my dear father and sister of my misfortune. I acquainted the captain with my troubles, who wrote a letter ready to be given any <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>French</HI> vessel we might meet with thro' the <HI>Straits,</HI> for he was bound for <HI>Barcelona,</HI> the capitol city of <HI>Cata∣lonia,</HI> one of the <HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>. But e'er we could make the <HI>Straits</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> two <HI>Al∣gerine</HI> rovers pursued us, and after a terrible fight, we were a second time taken, and fell into much worse hands than our other masters, for our obsti∣nate defence made them treat us with the utmost barbarity, which in generous spirits ought to have created esteem. Our new tyrants cruiz'd about the <HI>Straits Mouth</HI> three weeks to no purpose, therefore
<PB N="$$" REF="17"/>
made sail for the port of <HI>Algiers,</HI> where they were receive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the utmost joy by the inhabitants. My compa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion and I, with our two servants, were bought of an honest <HI>Moor,</HI> that had formerly been in <HI>England</HI> with <HI>Hamet</HI> the <HI>Ambassador;</HI> he spoke tolerable <HI>English,</HI> treated us very well, and agreed with us for a thousand pounds, and fifty yards of cloth scarlet, as he call'd it, for our ran∣som, ordering our letters to be ready to send to our friends in <HI>England,</HI> with the soonest. In the mean time, we wanted nothing but our liberty, and other slaves were treated with humanity; therefore I think the stories of the many hardships captives un∣dergo, cannot be all truths. Provisions are very plentiful, and good at <HI>Algiers</HI>. We had not been prisoners a fortnight, e'er the <HI>Irish</HI> captain came to us, and made proposals concerning our liberty; he inform'd us he had prevail'd with twelve other slaves, the ensuing night, to run away with a small vessel in the port, and if we would accompany him, he would carry us into <HI>Spain,</HI> and from thence give us our liberty; in short, we agred, every thing suc∣ceeded to our wishes, and we are now safe in the city of <HI>Barcelona</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI>. The bearer will in∣form you, my dear father, the reason of my stay here. Give my dearest love to my amiable sister, I see you both every moment, with my mind's eye, as our immortal <HI>Shakespear</HI> says. I hope this long letter will come time enough to prevent suspicions of my death, and find you both in health and happi∣ness, which shall be the daily prayer and wishes of your most dutiful son,</P>

<P><HI>Heaven be truly praised</HI>, cry'd the lovely Lu∣cretia, <HI>for this news, but I fear, my brother, the
<PB N="$$" REF="18"/>
knowledge of our dear father's death, will shock thy tender soul, with ever living sorrow. My bro∣ther informs my father in the letter, you will ac∣quaint us with the reason of his stay at</HI> Barcelona. <HI>Madam</HI>, reply'd the messenger, <HI>his love detains him there, love of as fair a lady as ever</HI> Spain <HI>produced, their hearts are firmly united; and if your father had been living, I was to have return'd with his consent, and brought the happy couple to pay their duty at his feet. What then, are they already wedded, said the lady. No, madam</HI>, re∣ply'd the messenger, <HI>the lady loves your brother so well, that she would not have him do any thing to break the bonds of duty</HI>. At this, they broke off their discourse, and all retir'd to their repose. The next morning the young lady seem'd very thoughtful, taking several turns about her chamber, as if her mind was ruminating on something very extraordinary; which her maid observing, ask'd her what it was that disturb'd her? but had no other answer, than, go call <HI>Mentor</HI>, and the messenger that brought the let∣ter from my brother. When they came in, and were seated, by her order, she look'd upon 'em both alternately, for some moments, then broke her silence in this manner: <HI>I am going to declare an affair, that will very much surprize you; I am resolved to embark with the soonest for</HI> Spain, <HI>to visit my brother and his lovely mistress; but to do it with as much decency as possible, I intend to dis∣guise my sex</HI>. This declaration very much sur∣prized indeed, her two auditors; in vain they laid the hazards and dangers of the attempt be∣fore her; she overturn'd all their arguments by persisting, and they had nothin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do, but to prepare for their voyage.

thing was ready, and at night they set out for <HI>Dover</HI>, where they intended to wait for a vessel to <HI>Calais</HI>; for the lady's intention was to travel thro' <HI>France</HI>, and embark for <HI>Spain</HI>, at <HI>Marseilles</HI>; the war between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> prevented her voyage in an <HI>English</HI> vessel. When they landed at <HI>Calais</HI>, they hired post chaises, and in sixteen days arrived at <HI>Marseilles</HI>, without any accident on the road.</P>
<P>As <HI>Lucretia</HI>, with <HI>Mentor</HI>, the messenger and the servants were viewing the gallies, a young gentleman, of a noble mein, ran up to her, kiss'd her, and embraced her with such rap∣tures, that she could not immediately disengage herself from his arms. The sudden surprize quite confounded her, and she was at a loss how to behave. My dear friend (cry'd the gentleman) how came you to <HI>Marseilles</HI> before me, whom I left at <HI>Barcelona? Lucretia</HI> made no answer, her surprize was so great; but her attendants inter∣posing, convinced the gentleman he was mis∣taken, tho' it was some time before he could be∣lieve his eyes. The lady soon recollected her∣self, and did not doubt, by his mentioning <HI>Bar∣celona</HI>, but this gentleman was an acquaintance of her brother's, and might be easily mistaken thro' their prodigious likeness. A secret satis∣faction stole into her breast, which at last appear∣ed in her countenance.</P>
<P>The gentleman begg'd pardon for his rude mistake; but Sir, said he, you so much resem∣ble a dear friend I have left in <HI>Spain</HI>, that I shou'd be proud of your acquaintance; in short, the lady was resolved to invite them to her lodg∣ings, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> together, that she might be fur∣ther inform <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her beloved brother.</P>
<P><PB N="2$" REF="20"/>The young gentleman soon consented to her proposal of supping together; and there being conveniencies in the same house, he made an agreement with the landlord for an apartment contiguous to <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s. He went on board the vessel for his servants and goods (for he was bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> just arriv'd when he met <HI>Lucretia</HI>) order'd them to the same house, and thought himself happy with his new acquaintance. When they were at supper, the gentleman could not keep his eyes off <HI>Lucretia</HI>. "Sir, said he, the more I look or you, the more I discover the likeness of my friend in every feature; all the difference is, your com¦plexion is more fair, and your voice has more softness in it." Pray Sir, said <HI>Lucretia</HI>, who i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this friend of yours? The gentleman proceede<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to acquaint her with all she knew already, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we need not repeat; extoll'd the beauty of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lady, whose perfections of the mind were equa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to her outward charms. "My friend <HI>Frederic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> told me, said the gentleman, he had sent a me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦senger to his father and sister, to acquaint the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with his story; but his long delay, or perha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his death, makes him fear they have not receive his Letter."

Good heaven! cry'd out <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, and can it be the lovely sister of my dear friend, the fair <HI>Lucre∣tia</HI>, whom I have heard him mention with so much tenderness; for heaven's-sake, madam, re∣cover your confusion; the secret shall be for ever lock'd up in my breast, you shall command my life: And tho' I was going to <HI>England</HI> to take possession of an ample fortune by the death of an elder brother, whose death I much lament, yet you must give me leave to attend you back to <HI>Barcelona</HI>, where you will meet your brother. This speech gave the lady time to recover her∣self a little. Sir, said she, I trust you with this secret, which I am assured your friendship for my brother will prevail upon you to keep; but must not prevent your journey to <HI>England</HI>, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our return with me to <HI>Barcelona</HI>. I would obey <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll your commands but this, replied <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, besides I may render you some little services when we arrive there. Many compliments pass'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etween this amiable couple, and <HI>Lucretia</HI> did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot seem displeased that he conquered all her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rguments against his not returning with her: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he vessel was not ready to sail for <HI>Barcelona</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or many days, and every day <HI>Ferdinand</HI> be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me more in love; yet in all this time his eyes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly declared his passion; his tongue was mute <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that subject. One day as they were diverting <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emselves on the river, turning a point of land, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> boat met theirs so violently, that with the sud∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n shock they were forc'd into the water.

saved themselves by swimming, but poor <HI>Lu∣cretia</HI> sunk to the bottom. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> seeing her danger, plunged after her, and with the greatest difficulty brought her to shore, even with the hazard of his life. The ladies in the other boat being near a villa of their own, had their whole company conducted there, in order to recover the fright, and shift their wet cloaths. <HI>Lucretia</HI> tho' very feint, was in the utmost distress at this accident, for fear of a discovery; and her lover <HI>Ferdinand</HI> seemed to be in some perplexity. So when they arrived at the house, which was near the river-side, mens cloaths were provided for every body but <HI>Lucretia</HI>; and the sisters sent her a woman's habit to put on, which she could not forbear smiling at. She drest herself with the greatest haste, and came out with her hair loose about her shoulders. The sisters were surprized at her beauty, and genteel mien in a woman's dress, and paid her a great many compliments upon it. One of the ynung ladies undertook to dress her head, and dry her hair, ornamenting it with jewels, and flowers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After this, some refreshment was prepared; but when the company met together, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was so charm∣ed with <HI>Lucretia</HI>, in her proper dress, that the sisters took notice of it. Don't you think, said the lady, I have taken some pains with your friend? I protest when I look in the glass, I am ashamed of my-self, to be outdone in beauty by one of the contrary sex. These praises raised a blush in the face of <HI>Lucretia</HI>, which <HI>Ferdinand</HI> perceiving, changed the discourse. After dinner, they diverted themselves in the garden, 'till it was time to think of going back to <HI>Marseilles</HI>. Their cloaths being now dry, every one put on
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
their own; and the ladies would have their ser∣vants accompany them to see them safe to their lodgings. When <HI>Lucretia</HI> open'd her purse, af∣ter coming to her lodgings, to gratify the servants for the trouble they had undergone on their ac∣counts, she was surpriz'd to find a paper with a handsome diamond ring in it. The note con∣taian'd the following words:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are many instances of persons being struck with love at first sight; I have a for∣tune large enough to make you happy, if happiness can consist in money. When I braided those charm∣ing locks, I twisted fetters for my heart, to bind me your eternal slave. This declaration is against the rule of our sex's modesty; but what rules can be set to love? I beg you will wear the inclosed trifle for my sake, tho' I took the freedom to open your purse unknown to you, which you left in the closet where you undrest; it was only thus to declare my love, and offer you my heart, with my fortune, which is independent. Consider of it; but then consider, your slights, or refusal, will be the death of one, who will not live, but for you.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The amazement and confusion in her counte∣nance, was observed by her faithful lover, who almost guess'd the secret, for lover's eyes are quick sighted; however she confirm'd his suspi∣cions, by giving it him to read, saying at the same time, "Alas! what a fatal mistake is this? Fatal indeed, madam, reply'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, (re∣turning the letter) but it must be the fate of all who look upon you." This declaration pro∣nounced so unexpectedly, threw a blush of shame
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
and anger into <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s face; she gave him no answer, but went out of the apartment with re∣sentment, leaving the poor lover in the utmost terror of despair. The perplexities this affair, with that of the letter, had almost made her for∣get the servants whom she had order'd to attend below. She gave her respects to the ladies, and bid the servants tell them she would come the next day once more to thank them for their good∣ness. After this <HI>Lucretia</HI> retir'd to her apart∣ment, and went to bed, without supping with <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, as usual; but rest was a stranger to her: she sometimes thought she ought not to be cruel to a man who saved her life, at the hazard of his own; but then she imagin'd that was the cause of his presumptious love; the more she thought, the more she found excuses in his fa∣vour, however she determin'd to make her voyage to <HI>Barcelona</HI> without him, tho' it was some time before she could come to that resolution. The next morning the captain of the vessel came to acquaint them he should be ready to sail the next day; every thing was order'd to be ready, with the utmost privacy, to conceal it from her lover.</P>
<P><HI>Lucretia</HI> seem'd pleased with the thought of em∣barking without him, yet at the same time, there was too much cruelty, she imagin'd in her inten∣tion. However, she was resolv'd to satisfy the lady, it was out of her power to return her love, by revealing her sex. Orders were given to <HI>Mentor</HI> to provide a boat, for the rest of her peo∣ple were busy in preparing for their voyage. The river is so rapid in many places that passen∣gers go out, and let the boatmen tow the vessel up against the stream: the 2d time <HI>Lucretia</HI> and <HI>Mentor</HI> landed, the rope broke, and the boat with
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
the steersman alone, was drove with the force of the stream above a mile back, till it was thrown upon a bank of sand; the two watermen that were on shore, were obliged to go back in order to help her off, while <HI>Lucretia</HI> with <HI>Mentor</HI> re∣solved to walk slowly on, to stay for them at the next place they were to go on board. They wait∣ed two hours, and no boat appear'd; this delay gave them some uneasiness, therefore they de∣termin'd to pursue their journey by land, which was not above two miles farther; but the sun growing hot, obliged them to rest in a little <HI>Cabaret</HI> on the road. They had not been there a quarter of an hour, before they observed a ser∣vant of the ladies, where they intended to go, very busy in discourse with a gentleman, who held an open letter in his hand as they pass'd by the <HI>Cabaret</HI>; the servant cast his eyes upon <HI>Lu∣cretia</HI>, and cry'd to the person that was with him, <HI>that's the very gentleman!</HI> and both pass'd the house. Our disguis'd lady could not apprehend what they meant, yet seem'd a little uneasy, tho' she knew not for what, yet conceal'd her appre∣hensions from <HI>Mentor</HI>, who did not observe what pass'd. A few minutes after, <HI>Mentor</HI> went to∣wards the water-side to look for the boat; he had not gone forty paces e'er the gentleman, that had pass'd by with the servant, enter'd the <HI>Cabaret</HI>, came up to <HI>Lucretia, Sir</HI>, said he, <HI>I desire a word in private</HI>, and at the same time, took her by the sleeve of her coat, leading her a little roughly in∣to the garden of the <HI>Cabaret; Lucretia</HI> was so full of confusion, that her presence of mind forsook her, and she follow'd insensibly.</P>
<P>When they came to the most retir'd part of the garden, the gentleman drew his sword, <HI>come, Sir</HI>,
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
said he, <HI>draw! I have no time to lose! I must punish the lady that loves you, by thy death¡ I have dis∣covered her passion for you by the letter she sent you just now, her servant brought it to me, and I ought to hate her for loving a person at the first sight, after slighting all my vows and assiduities for years toge∣ther. There's the letter</HI> (continued the gentleman, throwing it upon the ground) <HI>if you long to read it, you must kill me first, then you may peruse it at your leisure, and visit the ungrateful fair, who dies every moment till she sees your face. Wou'd to heaven, she never had, then time might have melted her hard heart, and disposed her to have re∣warded my constant affection</HI>. During this speech, poor <HI>Lucretia</HI> was full of the utmost terrors, and trembling with agonies, which the gentleman observing, cry'd, <HI>What art thou then a coward? and darest presume to love? defend thy-self, or I'll stab thee through thy timerous heart</HI>. Hold, pro∣phane wretch! cry'd <HI>Ferdinand, Lucretia</HI>'s gene∣rous lover, who that moment appeared with his sword in his hand, and hurt not that precious life! This sudden interruption somewhat sur∣prized the stranger; however, as <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s sword was opposed against him, they made seve∣ral furious passes at each other, 'till at last the stranger was disarm'd, without receiving any wound on either side. Just as the combat was finish'd, <HI>Mentor</HI> came in, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the ladies they were going to visit, which he stopp'd, as they were passing by in their coach! <HI>Lucretia</HI> seeing them, put her hand to her face to hide her con∣fusion, but however, was resolved to discover herself, to end all disputes, for the stranger seem'd to harbour rancour in his heart against her. <HI>La∣dies</HI>, (said Lucretia) <HI>I have endangered my life
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
in venturing to visit you, in order to undeceive one in your company; for when she drest me yesterday in womens cloaths, she put me in my proper habit, it is with some shame that I discover this, but I came resolv'd to do it, to rectify all mistakes</HI>.</P>
<P>The different countenances at this discovery, cannot be describ'd; however an hour's conver∣sation reconcil'd the affair; the lady prevailed upon <HI>Lucretia</HI> to keep the ring in commemoration of this affair, accepting at the same time one from her. The lady's lover sued a pardon from <HI>Lu∣cretia</HI>, in such terms, that seem'd to promise fair∣er for his mistress's heart than all his former vows had done; and they took leave of each o∣ther with mutual promises of remembrance. When <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Lucretia</HI> were seated in the boat, that waited for them, they were silent for some time, he daring not to lift his eyes up to her face. <HI>Lucretia</HI> at the same time began to lose some part of her rigour, for a man, that perhaps had twice saved her life. What was his crime? love! a virtuous love, and from a man whose rank and fortune might deserve her. <HI>Men∣tor</HI> observ'd them both, and attributed <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s silence to her late fear, and by <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s taci∣turnity imagin'd he might have receiv'd some hurt. <HI>Come, Madam</HI>, (said <HI>Mentor</HI> to <HI>Lucretia) your fears are now over, be chearful. No,</HI> Mentor, reply'd <HI>Lucretia, not while I keep on this habit; I never once thought of the dangers I am liable to by wearing it; this last adventure might have been fatal, had it not been prevented by the timely as∣sistance of this gentleman</HI>, pointing to <HI>Ferdinand. Timely indeed</HI>, return'd <HI>Mentor, Pray Sir, what accident brought you so opportunely to my lady's assistance?</HI> applying his discourse to <HI>Ferdinand.
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
This morning</HI>, reply'd Ferdinand, <HI>when I arose, I was inform'd by our landlord, that the lady with you were gone up the river; I own I instinctively follow'd, for my mind seem'd to forbode some dan∣ger might attend you; I got into another boat, and follow'd till we came to that of yours, which the men had just set clear from the sand-bank; by them I was inform'd which way you went, I landed, and pursued the same path; when I came within a hun∣dred paces of the</HI> Cabaret, <HI>I took notice of two persons busy in discourse, one of them cry'd out with transport!</HI> Wou'd to heaven the stripling villain had been swallow'd by the waves e'er <HI>Isabella</HI> had seen his face! <HI>After this speech they parted, and the gentleman proceeded with hasty steps to∣wards the</HI> Cabaret, <HI>which he enter'd before I could overtake him; you know the rest, and I shall think this day one of the happiest of my life</HI>. — Here casting his eyes on <HI>Lucretia</HI>, they encounter'd hers, who with a modest blush, turn'd aside to hide her confusion; it was plain to <HI>Mentor</HI> love was kindling in her heart, which did not dis∣please him, knowing both their virtuous inclina∣tions. <HI>Lucretia</HI>, before she got to their lodgings, began to repent her design of going to <HI>Barcelona</HI> without <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, and wish'd she had never set that resolution. Alas! Love will make a great progress in a little time; when once the gates of the heart is open, he rushes in like a torrent, till every corner is fill'd with the pleas∣ing passion. <HI>Lucretia</HI> seem'd more ashamed of her disguise than ever, began to think it some stain to modesty, since her soul was fill'd with the ideas of love, and wonder'd at herself she had not found it before; however, now it was too late, for the next morning was fix'd for their
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
embarking. It was with some shame <HI>Lucretia</HI> look'd upon <HI>Ferdinand</HI> in the morning, when they enter'd the vessel, tho' she was assured no one knew of her design to go without him but herself; in short, before they arrived at <HI>Barce∣lona, Lucretia</HI> gave <HI>Ferdinand</HI> hopes she would not prove inexorable. The assiduous lover did not let a moment pass without declaring his pas∣sion, till by mutual consent they exchanged hearts, and she promis'd if her brother consent∣ed, one day should join all their hands. Never were two lovers more happy, with regard to virtue, for I dare answer for'em both, there was not a vicious thought within either of their souls.</P>
<P>The favourable wind, and weather, made the voyage to <HI>Barcelona</HI> short, though it seem'd tedi∣ous to <HI>Ferdinand:</HI> it was late in the evening e'er they were landed, therefore they were oblig'd to take up their lodgings at an inn. In the morn∣ing, <HI>Lucretia</HI> told <HI>Ferdinand</HI> she intended to sur∣prize her brother, therefore begg'd he would bring him to the inn without acquainting him of her arrival. The lover seem'd pleas'd with the design, and went immediately to find out <HI>Frederick</HI>. We must now leave <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Lucretia</HI>, and give a short account of the amour between <HI>Frederick</HI> and the lady he was in love with.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Irish</HI> captain arrived at <HI>Barcelona</HI> from <HI>Algiers</HI>, from whence they had made their escape; he treated the two gentlemen with the utmost generosity, and being obliged to return to sea again to follow his employment, he left them masters of his house during his absence, with orders to his servants to receive all their
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
commands as if they were given by himself, in∣tending at his return, to carry them to <HI>Marseilles</HI> in his own vessel.</P>
<P>The Captain before he embark'd, brought <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI> and <HI>Frederick</HI> acquainted in several fa∣milies, that they might pass their time with more satisfaction; most of these new acquaintance did not regard the stiff formal customs of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>, for their families were originally ei∣ther <HI>English, Scots</HI>, or <HI>Irish</HI>, therefore the ladies were not coop'd up as they generally are in <HI>Spain</HI>; 'tis true, they were all of the <HI>Roman</HI> religion, yet they never offer'd to make converts of their guests. <HI>Donna Leonora</HI>, was one of this amiable compa∣ny; her father not long since dead, had left her a fortune upwards of 800,000 crowns; yet her person was beyond expression beautiful, not to be equall'd, but by the charms of the mind: <HI>Fre∣derick</HI>'s heart soon felt the impression of her image, yet was plung'd into despair, when he was in∣form'd the governor's son, <HI>Don Lopez</HI> was his ri∣val; a person potent for him to cope withal, and he too often had the mortification to find she re∣ceived his addresses without any displeasure. The pains of his mind brought a disorder on his body, and he was seiz'd with a violent fe∣ver. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> his companion, knew the source of his distemper, therefore encouraged him to love on; <HI>'tis time enough to despair</HI>, said he, <HI>when she has refus'd your vows. Do not flatter me</HI>, re∣ply'd <HI>Frederick, her heart is already given to</HI> Don Lopez, <HI>I see it by her eyes. Lovers</HI>, return'd <HI>Fer∣dinand, either see too much, or are quite blind; I that am disinterested can plainly discover that he is quite indifferent to her, and have observed her more than once, cast a favourable look on you</HI>. As <HI>Fre∣derick</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
was going to reply, word was brought, several gentlemen and ladies were come to visit him, among the rest <HI>Donna Leonora</HI> enter'd, conducted by <HI>Don Lopez</HI>. The sight agitated the mind of poor <HI>Frederick</HI>, that the blood burst out of his nose. <HI>Leonora</HI> stood next the bed, gave him her handkerchief to stop it, which he re∣ceived with a trembling hand; but that was at∣tributed to his weakness, by all but <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, who was observed by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> to change colour several times. When the company was gone, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> told his friend the observation he had made, and further, the concern <HI>Leonora</HI> seem'd to shew at the accident; adding, <HI>I am convinced she loves you</HI>.</P>
<P>O flatterer, reply'd <HI>Frederick</HI>, but I forgive your friendship; you mean it well, we are too apt to believe what we wish; in short, our lover became a little more composed, and in two days he had strength enough to walk about his apart∣ment. The third day, he received the visits of his acquaintance, to congratulate the recovery of his health; but neither <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, or <HI>Leonora</HI> came, which much surprized him. When the company retired, a servant brought him a letter, which he said required an answer. He broke open the seal with some emotion, and read as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> AM inform'd you are in better health, than when I saw you last; I shall expect you early to∣morrow morning in the <HI>Abbey-Field</HI> alone, with your sword on; there to decide who shull be the sur∣viving lover of <HI>Leonora</HI>. Send word by the bearer, if your health will permit you to come; if not, I
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
will wait, tho' with impatience, till I hear from you: I believe you have generosity enough to conceal this, or I should think you unworthy to be beloved by the lady we must contend for; who shall never be pos∣sess'd by any, while there is life in the injured</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>LOPEZ.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>When he had read the letter, he told the ser∣vant to inform his master he should be sure to keep the appointment. <HI>Frederick</HI> would have conceal'd this from <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, but he thought it would be wronging his friendship, therefore gave it him to read. While they were dis∣coursing on this subject, another letter was de∣liver'd to him, which he knew to be <HI>Leonora</HI>'s hand; he trembled at breaking open the seal, and his weakness was such, that his friend was obliged to support him.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>DON LOPEZ,</HI> I am assured, by some words he let drop yesterday, intends to send you a challenge.

If you were to succeed in your dispute, it would be dan∣gerous, for his friends are very powerful; if you should fall, most of your acquaintance here would mourn your loss.

<P>Well friend, said <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, what think ye now? <HI>I have a right of disposing of my own heart,

and I never gave it</HI> Lopez <HI>yet, or any assurance it should be his</HI>. Does not that passage encourage you? It gives me infinite pleasure, reply'd <HI>Fre∣derick</HI>, to think he is not a favourite rival; but I can't see the least glimpse of hope that I shall ever be master of her heart. However (answer'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>) here is a fair opportunity to discover your love; in my opinion the confession will not displease her. Encouraged by his friend, <HI>Fre∣derick</HI> then sat down to write; but the variety of hopes, fears and terrors that perplex'd his mind, almost distracted him; at last, he made shift to write the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Divine <HI>Leonora!</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE torments I endure for fear this letter should displease you, are not to be express'd by words, no more than the inviolable passion I feel for you. What is life without you? only a being of tedious days, and anxious nights, insupportable to bear. The first moment I beheld your face, I loved; but with a passion so sincere and lasting, nought but death can put an end to. Your image is impress'd upon my heart. If I was assured I was not indif∣ferent to you, I would not doubt of to-morrow's suc∣cess; I love you too much to be a coward; and the laws of honour, which I have, and will strictly ob∣serve, obliges me to comply with custom. I should justly deserve your hate, and scorn, should I tamely sit down, and let my rival triumph in my shame. Consider, I shall fight for you and my country, and doubt not to conquer. But if fate intends to-morow to put a period to my life, my last breath shall call upon your name, and die sincerely yours,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/>This letter was seal'd, and sent by <HI>Leonora</HI>'s servant, who waited below. <HI>Frederick</HI> gave some respite to his passion, to consider a little on the ensuing combat; he call'd to mind the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> always fought with sword and dagger; weapons he had but lately practised, and conse∣quently not a thorough master of. <HI>Don Lopez</HI> was accounted one of the bravest cavaliers in <HI>Spain</HI>; therefore <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was in some fears for the life of his friend; but <HI>Frederick</HI>'s joy, that he should fight for the lovely <HI>Leonora</HI>, gave him hopes he might succeed. While the two friends were preparing to go to rest, another letter came from the lovely <HI>Leonora</HI>, which <HI>Frederick</HI> open'd with the same terrors as the first. But what were his transports, when he read the following lines:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Frederick</HI>,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE terrors I am under for thy precious life, words cannot express; 'tis impossible I should have so soon declared my mind, but for thy danger to-morrow. What is this phantom honour, that must murder love? if you would shew that love you pro∣fess, decline the duel; all his power shall never displace thee from my heart, whose image it has bore from the first time I saw thee, tho' I guarded the secret from all human eyes. Thy letter gave me exquisite joy, with equal pain. If to-morrow should end thy dear life, I cannot survive thy loss. Go not to-morrow, your late illness may plead sufficient excuse, and the next day you may retire to my coun∣try house upon the river <HI>Barca,</HI> where <HI>Lopez</HI> shall never come to interrupt our quiet. Think 'tis my life you put to hazard, and preserve thyself for the disconsolate</P>

<P><PB N="36" REF="35"/>The reading this letter had like to have cost <HI>Frederick</HI> his life with the effusion of joy! He kiss'd it ten thousand times, placed it next to his heart, and vow'd it was proof against all the swords of <HI>Spain</HI>. He thought to have returned an answer; but the messenger was gone, and it was too late to send that night. However, he wrote one, seal'd it up, and gave it to a servant to deliver, if he did not return by eight the next morning. As soon as day began to appear, <HI>Fre∣derick</HI> rose and drest himself, and went out of the house unobserved even by his friend, whom he left in a profound sleep.</P>
<P>Just as he enter'd the <HI>Abbey Field</HI>, he was seiz∣ed by four <HI>Alguaziles</HI>, who hurry'd him into a neighbouring house; 'twas in vain to use argu∣ments for his liberty. He try'd the all powerful secret gold; but they refused; they inform'd him he was to be their prisoner till noon, and then he should have his freedom: He imagined he was seized by order of the governor, to prevent the duel. The time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as elapsed for his meet∣ing <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, which gave him the utmost un∣easiness. As he was looking out of the window, he saw <HI>Don Lopez</HI> coming over the <HI>Abbey Field</HI> alone; as he came near, he call'd to him: 'Dear <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, release me from these villain∣ous <HI>Alguaziles</HI>, who have kept me here these four hours, and prevented my waiting on you, according to appointment.'</P>
<P>They durst not disobey <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, who gave orders for his liberty; and not knowing the rea∣son of his confinement, they did not give them∣selves much trouble about it. <HI>Don Lopez</HI> and <HI>Frederick</HI> walk'd on till they came to a proper place for their design: Now, cry'd <HI>Lopez</HI>, let us
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
decide who shall enjoy <HI>Leonora</HI>. They drew their swords and daggers, and what <HI>Frederick</HI> wanted in judgment, he made up with strength and agility. He received a wound in the sword hand, that made him incapable of holding it, which so enraged him, that he seized hold of <HI>Don Lopez</HI> by the throat, and maugre his resist∣ance, threw him flat upon the ground; with the fall, the sword of <HI>Don Lopez</HI> flew out of his hand, which <HI>Frederick</HI> snatch'd up: 'You see our combat must end for the time (said <HI>Frederick</HI> to <HI>Lopez</HI>) but I shall be ready to finish it, as soon as I am able to use my sword again. 'Tis well, reply'd <HI>Lopez</HI>, 'till then I desire we may appear as friends. <HI>Lopez</HI> had received two slight wounds; one in the breast, and the other on the side of his neck; but he would carry <HI>Frederick</HI> to his own surgeon, and saw him dress'd first. Before they parted, <HI>Don Lopez</HI> told <HI>Frederick</HI>, he would give out to the publick, that he had chose him for his second, against two other <HI>Chevaliers</HI>; otherwise, said he, we shall not meet with an opportunity to decide our quarrel. <HI>Frederick</HI> agreed, parted with his rival, and went to his own lodgings; where, enquiring for his friend, he was inform∣ed <HI>Donna Leonora</HI> had sent for him in haste two hours before.</P>
<P>'Twas she, poor lady, that sent the <HI>Alguaziles</HI> to arrest <HI>Frederick</HI>, in hopes to prevent their meeting. The servant who had orders to deliver the letter at eight o'clock to <HI>Leonora</HI>, executed his commission punctually, and gave it into her own hand. She read it to herself, gave a great shriek, and fell senseless on the floor. The letter you may read as follows:
<LETTER>
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
<P>WHEN this comes to your hands, be assured your adorer is no more; the earth that I lie upon bears not so sincere a lover. If you will wet my grave with one pittying tear, 'twill please the fleeting shadow of one, if he had lived ages, could have had no thoughts but for you. Farewel; and sometimes think of your faithful lover.</P>

<P>When she came a little to herself, her sighs seem'd as if her heart was breaking. She was heard to say, <HI>and art thou gone, poor dear</HI> Fre∣derick. Her servants about her were surprized, and imagined her senses were distracted, 'till one of them took up the letter, which lay upon the floor; and seeing <HI>Frederick</HI>'s name at the bottom, soon found his lady had no other destraction but love. The servant had sense enough to conceal this from the other servants, and guess'd part of the affair. His looks were full of pity, and dis∣cover'd to <HI>Donna Leonora</HI>, a more sincere sorrow than any of the rest; for servants will pretend to sympathize with their masters and mistresses, when it is too often no more than pretension; but this person, as a servant, sincerely loved his mistress, had an education that put him above the rank of common servants; and, what is rarely found among them, was honest, and had no interest at heart but that of his lady: He was the very person that was sent by his mistress for the <HI>Alguaziles</HI>, the evening before, tho' he knew not their business with his lady. <HI>Leonora</HI> sent the rest of the servants out of the room, then order'd <HI>Pedro</HI>, which was the name of this faith∣ful one, first to go to <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, and beg he would come that moment to her. Then fly to
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
the <HI>Alguaziles, you know where the chief of them dwells; go with them to the Abbey Field:</HI> Here her voice falter'd, and her eyes shed a torrent of tears; and if you find the dead body of the un∣fortunate <HI>Frederick</HI>, bring it me with all the caution you possibly can. The faithful <HI>Pedro</HI> flew to execute his lady's commands, with the wings of diligence. <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, who knew no∣thing of the letter his friend had wrote the night before to <HI>Leonora</HI>, came with hopes of meeting <HI>Frederick</HI> there. But when he read the letter which <HI>Leonora</HI> gave him (accompany'd with sighs and tears without uttering one word) his grief almost equall'd her's. He would not stay to exchange a word with the disconsolate lady, but flew to the place of combat, where he met the faithful <HI>Pedro</HI>. They together search'd the whole field, and were pleased they could not find what they fear'd to meet, no more than the <HI>Al∣guaziles</HI>, whom <HI>Pedro</HI> sought for to no purpose. In the mean time <HI>Frederick</HI> entered the house of <HI>Donna Leonora</HI>, went directly to her apartment, finding the door shut, knock'd. <HI>Leonora</HI> imagin∣ing it was <HI>Pedro</HI> or <HI>Ferdinand</HI> return'd, said with a faint voice, <HI>Come in</HI>. But when she cast her eyes on <HI>Frederick</HI>, she stood motionless, believing it to be his apparition. But at his nearer ap∣proach, and viewing his wounded hand, her surprize and joy fighting with her sorrows, over∣came her, and she had fallen to the ground, had not <HI>Frederick</HI> snatch'd her in his arms, and seated her in a chair. When she came to herself, she found <HI>Frederick</HI> at her feet, kissing her cold hand, never were more tender expressions of Love be∣tween two faithful hearts. She kiss'd his wounded hand, and wash'd it with her tears of
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
joy; and made him promise for himself, friend, and their servants, to go that very day to her country seat, where she would preserve him from the insults of the rash Don <HI>Lopez</HI>. This tender scene was interrupted by the entrance of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Pedro</HI>, whose joy was beyond ex∣pression to find him safe. <HI>Leonora</HI> at their pre∣sence endeavoured to hide a little of that tender∣ness she had in her heart for her dear <HI>Frederick</HI>; but like the sun breaking thro' a cloud, her eyes would shine upon him. 'And why should they not? their hearts were united; by fate destined to each other, and their vows register'd in hea∣ven. However, <HI>Leonora</HI> could not lull the troubles of her heart to rest, till they arrived that evening at her country seat. Nothing but pleasures and diversions were thought of; but amidst all, <HI>Frederick</HI> remember'd his father, and amiable sister, discovering to his lovely <HI>Leonora</HI> all his circumstances, and the fears that must surround 'em for this life, in not hearing from him in so long a time. When <HI>Donna Leonora</HI> understood every thing, she said, 'My dear <HI>Fre∣derick</HI>, though I love you more than my own life, yet our nuptials must be deferr'd till you have the consent of so tender a father. It shall be my care to provide a proper messenger, and as you are incapable of writing yourself, thro' the wound in your hand, if you will dictate, I will be your Amanuensis, provided you do not mention any thing of our loves, but leave that to <HI>Pedro</HI>, whom I intend shall be the messenger: Most of the families in <HI>Barcelona</HI>, that you are acquainted with, have kept up the <HI>English</HI> lan∣guage. <HI>Pedro</HI> by making several voyages with my late worthy father, and living in the family,
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
understands it perfectly well. If you will give him proper directions, he shall prepare for his voyage tomorrow.' Every thing was agreed to, and the letter was wrote by the lovely <HI>Leonora</HI> (which you have read already) <HI>Pedro</HI> embark'd the next day, in a ship bound for <HI>Marseilles</HI>, but by a violent storm was blown on the coast of <HI>Africa</HI>, and obliged to wait for a fair wind, in the port of <HI>Oran</HI>, full six weeks. In the mean time, the lovers and friends pass'd their hours with the utmost contentment at <HI>Leonora</HI>'s coun∣try house, without the least molestation, or hear∣ing from <HI>Don Lopez</HI>. But to set <HI>Leonora</HI>'s heart intirely at rest, they had news brought them that the governor of <HI>Barcelona</HI> had sent him to <HI>Madrid</HI>, to sollicit a place at court. In the midst of their joys, the generous <HI>Irish</HI> captain return'd from his voyage, and had taken several rich prizes from the <HI>Algermes</HI>, to be revenged on them for their late captivity, and redeem'd a great number of christian slaves, one of which he had taken into his service. The captain being in∣form'd where his guests were, went to visit them with his new servant. The servant no sooner cast his eyes on <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, but he cry'd out with the utmost transport, <HI>What do I see! my dear master, that I have been seeking these four months! Ferdinand</HI> soon knew him to be the favourite servant of his brother; he enquired after his health, but the messenger inform'd him with a melancholy countenance, he had been laid in the tomb of his ancestors above four months, dying of a violent and sudden fever: Tho' a very large fortune descended to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> by his death, he could not help shedding tears for the loss of so good a brother, ever indulgent to him.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41"/>The servant inform'd him he embark'd on a small vessel bound for <HI>Diep</HI>, in order to search for him in some of the cities in <HI>France</HI>; but were chas'd by a <HI>Spanish</HI> privateer, near that port, and taken, but before they arriv'd at <HI>St. Sebastians</HI> (where they were bound) they were retaken by a rover of <HI>Barbary</HI>, and within the <HI>Straits</HI>, were met with by the valiant <HI>Irish</HI> captain, who after a terrible engagement boarded the rover, who surrender'd after the loss of three parts of his men; thus was I the third time a prisoner, but releas'd by the generosity of the captain, who took me into his service; and now, continued the servant, I think myself at the heighth of happiness in finding my dear master.</P>
<P>It was necessary <HI>Ferdinand</HI> should make a voy∣age to <HI>England</HI> with the soonest, to settle his af∣fairs, that requir'd his speedy presence; when the time of his departure came, it proved a me∣lancholly day to him and the two lovers he left behind him. They saw him on board, and re∣tir'd to <HI>Leonora</HI>'s town-house, not fearing any thing in the absence of <HI>Don Lopez</HI>; waiting with impatience for the return of <HI>Pedro</HI>, who had ex∣ceeded his limited time.</P>
<P>We will now return to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Lucre∣tia</HI>, whom we left at the inn, with <HI>Mentor</HI> and <HI>Pedro</HI>, the messenger, who had orders not to ap∣pear, for fear of being known. When <HI>Ferdin∣and</HI> came to the house of <HI>Donna Leonora</HI>, he was something surpriz'd to find all in darkness; how∣ever, he rung the bell, and a servant open'd the door, who inform'd him his mistress was at her country seat, with <HI>Don Frederick</HI>, (as he call'd him) who is ill with some wounds he has lately received. This intelligence gave <HI>Ferdinand</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
very great concern, tho' by all his enquiry, he could not learn who he had fought with. When he return'd to the inn, he cautiously examin'd the master of the house, but he found by his answers he was ignorant of the matter; he re∣turn'd to <HI>Isabella</HI>'s again, without seeing his dear <HI>Lucretia</HI>, to know if the servant could give him any further light into this affair: 'Sir, said the servant, all I know is that <HI>Don Frederick</HI> was wounded, but is now much better, and I know it is kept as a secret, therefore I should not have discover'd it to you, if you had not been one of his best friends.' <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was pleased that he was out of danger, yet could not dive into the mystery; however, he return'd to his ador'd <HI>Lucretia</HI>, and told her tenderly of this unlucky affair, which drew tears in her eyes; they re∣solved the next morning to go as privately as possible to <HI>Leonora</HI>'s country-house, they hired a coach and mules, and set out by break of day.</P>
<P>While they were upon the road, they were contriving how they should discover <HI>Lucretia</HI> to her brother, fearing if it was sudden, the strong emotion might endanger his health; however, they had not determined which way to proceed, when they arrived at the gate; but you may guess <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s surprise, when the first person he cast his eyes on was <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, very p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le and wan, looking out of the window, but retir'd on the instant. Heaven! said <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, loud e∣nough to be heard by <HI>Lucretia</HI>, How shall I solve this riddle! She was surpriz'd at these words, and ask'd him the meaning of it. Madam, re∣ply'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, I'm all amazement! but beg you will stay in the coach, while I enter the house to be better inform'd of what I see, if my
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
eyes have not deceived me. The servants were over-joy'd when they beheld <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, and flew into the garden, to acquaint <HI>Donna Leonora</HI> and <HI>Frederick</HI> with the welcome news. <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, follow'd 'em; when the two lovers perceiv'd him, they ran with open arms to embrace him. Their joy, for some time, made them forget to ask him the meaning of this sudden return, for they knew it was impossible he should have been so far as <HI>England</HI>, and back again. <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI> demanded first, if his dear friend's wounds were heal'd? Yes, thank heaven, reply'd <HI>Donna Isabella</HI>, but I am amazed how you came to know any thing of that unhappy accident. Well, return'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, perhaps I may sur∣prize you more; I have brought some friends to visit you, if you will retire to an apartment, I'll bring them one by one to you. <HI>Frederick</HI> and <HI>Isabella</HI>, full of expectation, enter'd the hall with∣out returning him an answer; the first that was introduced was <HI>Pedro</HI>, whom the good-natur'd <HI>Frederick</HI> embraced, asking at the same time, how his dear father and sister fared? Here is one that can inform you better, reply'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, introducing <HI>Mentor</HI>. Heavens! my dear tutor! cry'd <HI>Frederick</HI>, am I awake, and do I indeed embrace the man that led my wandering steps to virtue and learning! I hope, reply'd <HI>Mentor</HI>, em∣bracing him, among your other studies, you have learnt philosophy, and resignation to the will of heaven, in hearing losses patiently: We are all born to die — your father — is dead, re∣ply'd <HI>Frederick</HI>! the best of fathers! and of men! my absence has brought death to cut the thread of his life. Allow me, my dear <HI>Isabella</HI>, to pay this tribute of my tears to his rever'd memory.
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
The whole company could not refrain from weeping, at his filial sorrow; after some time allow'd for grief, he wiped his eyes, and enquired after his dear sister. Sir, reply'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, I have another gentleman to introduce, that saw her last, and can give the best account of her. He went out, and return'd leading <HI>Lucretia</HI> by the hand; at her sight, <HI>Frederick</HI> was struck with astonishment, and wonder ty'd his tongue; <HI>Isa∣bella</HI> cry'd out it must be she! my dear sister; she is too much like the image in my heart to be mistaken. The transports of this tender meeting over-whelm'd some part of <HI>Frederick</HI>'s grief for his father's death. Some hours were spent in re∣lating their histories to each other; but <HI>Ferdinand</HI> intreating <HI>Frederick</HI> to let him into the meaning of what he saw in the window, before he enter'd. If you have seen <HI>Don Lopez</HI> here, reply'd <HI>Frede∣rick</HI>, I know it must something surprive you; I'll reveal it to you in a few words: After you you were embark'd on your intended voyage, my dear <HI>Leonora</HI> and I retir'd to this place, to be out of the hurry of <HI>Barcelona</HI>; one morning early amusing myself with <HI>angling</HI>, till my lovely <HI>Isa∣bella</HI> was drest, a fisherman passing by in a boat, gave me this letter, which you may read.</P>

<P>When I read this note, I own, I could not resist the call of pity for his unhappy passion, and sincerely wish'd to avoid this meeting, but it could not be; the tyrant honour appear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d before me, and drove away compassion. When I met my dear <HI>Leonora</HI>, she took notice that my coun∣tenance was disorder'd, however, I conceal'd every thing from her, rose in the morning by break of day, and got in the wood without be∣ing observ'd by any one, where I found the im∣patient <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, in a mean habit; he turn'd short towards the inner part of the wood, and I follow'd without speaking to each other; when we came to a little green plat, he stop'd, and turn'd upon me, <HI>this is the spot</HI>, said he, <HI>where one of us must leave his life:</HI> We both drew our swords and daggers, giving and receiving seve∣ral wounds, at last I had the good fortune to run him thro' the body; he fell, and faintly said, 'You have conquer'd me, and approaching death will cure the wound <HI>Leonora</HI>'s eyes made, and as I must not enjoy her, live and be happy with. — At that word he fainted, I was too weak to give him assistance; therefore I made all the haste I could to <HI>Leonora</HI>'s, as soon as I got in, I directed the servants where he lay, and order'd 'em to bring him as gently as possible, which they did. I need
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
not repeat the agonies poor <HI>Leonora</HI> was in; she order'd a coach immediately, and went herself for a surgeon, he found I had no dangerous wound, when I was drest, he search'd those of <HI>Don Lopez</HI> and promis'd some hopes of life. To make short of my history, we both recover'd, but <HI>Don Lopez</HI> is not able to go abroad; he is so grateful for the usage he has received here, that he has conquer'd his passion, and wishes us blest in each other.</P>
<P><HI>Lucretia</HI> now desired she might put off for ever the habit of a man, that had given her so much uneasiness, which was soon done with the assist∣ance of her dear sister; <HI>Leonora</HI> disposed of her effects in <HI>Spain</HI>, and resolved to go with her lover to <HI>England</HI>, the land of liberty. When <HI>Don Lopez</HI> heard of these strange events, he begg'd leave to come among them, that he might pay his grati∣tude, his person was tall, genteel and well made, tho' his loss of so much blood made him appear pale and wan; when he enter'd the apartment, the whole company rose to salute him, he was sur∣prized at the beauty of <HI>Lucretia</HI>, who was now dress'd in her proper habit. 'I have been inform'd (said <HI>Don Lopez</HI>) that the women of <HI>England</HI> are <HI>Angels</HI>, and if they are all like you, my Inform∣ation is true. I wish you all the happiness heaven can bestow upon you, and beg I may have the honour to join those hands whose hearts I know have long been united'.</P>
<P>The two ladies blush'd at this speech of <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, but as their lovers were destin'd for their husbands, why should they delay their happiness, <HI>Frederick</HI> gave his consent that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> should wed his sister, with a dowry equal to his fortune, but he valued not fortune; but as riches are es∣sential to worldly happiness, they should not be
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
neglected; but all the wealth on earth cannot be a blessing without the pairing of hearts and mind. The day was fix'd for their nuptials, which were solemnized in private; <HI>Don Lopez</HI> was father to both the happy couples. In a few days after, <HI>Leonora</HI> disposed of her Estate at <HI>Barcelona</HI>, &amp;c. which amounted to near two hundred thousand pounds; rewarded the <HI>Irish</HI> Captain according to his merit, embark'd on board his ship for <HI>Mar∣seilles</HI>, with all their servants; paid a visit to <HI>Isa∣bella</HI>, the lady who fell in love with <HI>Lucretia</HI>; found her wedded to her lover; journeyed from thence to <HI>Calais</HI>, arrived safe in their own coun∣try, where (after they had settled a handsome pension for life on <HI>Mentor</HI>, bountifully rewarded the servant, and faithful <HI>Pedro</HI>, who still dwells in the Family) they now live among their te∣nants and neighbours, happy in a numerous race of prattling innocents, patterns of their parents virtues.</P>
