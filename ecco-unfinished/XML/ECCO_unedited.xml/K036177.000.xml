<P>THE much lamented Author of these Essays
left them in the hands of his friends to be dis∣posed
of as they thought proper, having immedi∣ately
before his death destroyed many other manu∣scripts
which he thought unfit for being made pub∣lic.
When these were inspected, the greater num∣ber
of them appeared to be parts of a plan he once
had formed, for giving a connected history of the li∣beral
sciences and elegant arts. It is long since he
found it necessary to abandon that plan as far too ex∣tensive;
and these parts of it lay beside him neglected
until his death. His friends are persuaded however,
that the reader will find in them that happy connec∣tion,
that full and accurate expression, and that clear
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
illustration which are conspicuous in the rest of his
works; and that though it is difficult to add much to
the great fame he so justly acquired by his other
writings, these will be read with satisfaction and
pleasure.</P>

ADAM SMITH, LL. D.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Mr. SMITH's Birth till the Publication of the Theory of
Moral Sentiments.</HEAD>
<P>ADAM SMITH, Author of the Inquiry into the Nature
and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, was the son of
ADAM SMITH, Comptroller of the Customs at Kirkaldy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. SMITH, the father, was a native of Aberdeenshire, and in the earlier part of his life practised at Edinburgh as a writer to the Signet. He was afterwards pri∣vate secretary to the Earl of Loudoun, (during the time that he held the offices of principal Secretary of State for Scotland, and of Keeper of the Great Seal,) and con∣tinued in this situation till 1713 or 1714, when he was appointed comptroller of the customs at Kirkaldy. He was also clerk to the courts martial and councils of war for Scotland; an office which he held from 1707 till his death. As it is now seventy years since he died, the accounts I have received of him are very imperfect; but from the particulars already mentioned, it may be presumed, that he was a man of more than common abilities.</NOTE>, and
of MARGARET DOUGLAS, daughter, of Mr. DOUGLAS of Stra∣thenry.
He was the only child of the marriage, and was born at
Kirkaldy on the 5th of June 1723, a few months after the death of
his father.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9"/>
His constitution during infancy was infirm and sickly, and
required all the tender solicitude of his surviving parent. She was
blamed for treating him with an unlimited indulgence; but it
produced no unfavourable effects on his temper or his dispositions:—and
he enjoyed the rare satisfaction of being able to repay her
affection, by every attention that silial gratitude could dictate, during
the long period of sixty years.</P>
<P>An accident which happened to him when he was about three
years old, is of too interesting a nature to be omitted in the account
of so valuable a life. He had been carried by his mother to Stra∣thenry
on a visit to his uncle Mr. DOUGLAS, and was one day
amusing himself alone at the door of the house when he was stolen
by a party of that set of vagrants who are known in Scotland by
the name of tinkers. Luckily he was soon missed by his uncle,
who hearing that some vagrants had passed, pursued them, with what
assistance he could find, till he overtook them in Leslie wood;
and was the happy instrument of preserving to the world a
genius, which was destined, not only to extend the boun∣daries
of science, but to enlighten and reform the commercial policy
of Europe.</P>
<P>The school of Kirkaldy, where Mr. SMITH received the first ru∣diments
of his education, was then taught by Mr. DAVID MILLER,
a teacher, in his day, of considerable reputation, and whose name
deserves to be recorded, on account of the eminent men whom
that very obscure seminary produced while under his direction.
Of this number were Mr. OSWALD of Dunikeir; his brother, Dr.
JOHN OSWALD, afterwards Bishop of Raphoe; and our late excel∣lent
colleague, the Reverend Dr. JOHN DRYSDALE: all of them
nearly contemporary with Mr. SMITH, and united with him through
life by the closest ties of friendship.—One of his school-fellows is still
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
alive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GEORGE DRYSDALE, Esq. of Kirkaldy, brother of the late Dr. DRYSDALE.</NOTE>; and to his kindness I am principally indebted for the
scanty materials which form the first part of this narrative.</P>
<P>Among these companions of his earliest years, Mr. SMITH
soon attracted notice, by his passion for books, and by the ex∣traordinary
powers of his memory. The weakness of his bo∣dily
constitution prevented him from partaking in their more
active amusements; but he was much beloved by them on ac∣count
of his temper, which, though warm, was to an uncom∣mon
degree friendly and generous. Even then he was re∣markable
for those habits which remained with him through
life, of speaking to himself when alone, and of <HI>absence</HI> in com∣pany.</P>
<P>From
the grammar-school of Kirkaldy, he was sent, in 1737, to
the University of Glasgow, where he remained till 1740, when
he went to Balliol College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner on SNELL's
foundation.</P>
<P>Dr. MACLAINE of the Hague, who was a fellow-student of Mr.
SMITH's at Glasgow, told me some years ago, that his favourite
pursuits while at that University were Mathematics and Natural
Philosophy; and I remember to have heard my father remind him
of a geometrical problem of considerable difficulty, about which he
was occupied at the time when their acquaintance commenced,
and which had been proposed to him as an exercise▪ by the cele∣brated
Dr. SIMPSON.</P>
<P>These, however, were certainly not the sciences in which
he was formed to excel; nor did they long divert him from
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
pursuits more congenial to his mind. What Lord BACON says
of PLATO may be justly applied to him: “Illum, licet ad rem∣publicam
non accessisset, tamen naturâ et inclinatione omnino
ad res civiles propensum, vires eo praecipue intendisse; neque
de Philosophia Naturali admodum sollicitum esse; nisi quatenus
ad Philosophi nomen et celebritatem tuendam, et ad majes∣tatem
quandam moralibus et civilibus doctrinis addendam et
aspergendam sufficeret<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Redargutio Philosophiarum.</NOTE>.” The study of human nature in all
its branches, more particularly of the political history of mankind,
opened a boundless field to his curiosity and ambition; and while it
afforded scope to all the various powers of his versatile and compre∣hensive
genius, gratified his ruling passion, of contributing to the
happiness and the improvement of society. To this study, diver∣sified
at his leisure hours by the less severe occupations of polite li∣terature,
he seems to have devoted himself almost entirely from
the time of his removal to Oxford; but he still retained, and
retained even in advanced years, a recollection of his early acquisi∣tions,
which not only added to the splendour of his conversation,
but enabled him to exemplify some of his favourite theories con∣cerning
the natural progress of the mind in the investigation of truth,
by the history of those sciences in which the connection and suc∣cession
of discoveries may be traced with the greatest advantage.
If I am not mistaken too, the influence of his early taste for the
Greek geometry may be remarked in the elementary clearness and
fulness, bordering sometimes upon prolixity, with which he fre∣quently
states his political reasonings.—The lectures of the pro∣found
and eloquent Dr. HUTCHESON, which he had attended
previous to his departure from Glasgow, and of which he always
spoke in terms of the warmest admiration, had, it may be reason∣ably
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
presumed, a considerable effect in directing his talents to their
proper objects.</P>
<P>I have not been able to collect any information with respect
to that part of his youth which was spent in England. I
have heard him say, that he employed himself frequently in the
practice of translation, (particularly from the French,) with a
view to the improvement of his own style: and he used often to
express a favourable opinion of the utility of such exercises, to all
who cultivate the art of composition. It is much to be regretted,
that none of his juvenile attempts in this way have been preserved;
as the few specimens which his writings contain of his skill as a
translator, are sufficient to shew the eminence he had attained in a
walk of literature, which, in our country, has been so little fre∣quented
by men of genius.</P>
<P>It was probably also at this period of his life, that he cultivated
with the greatest care the study of languages. The knowledge
he possessed of these, both ancient and modern, was uncommon∣ly
extensive and accurate; and, in him, was subservient, not to a
vain parade of tasteless erudition, but to a familiar acquaintance with
every thing that could illustrate the institutions, the manners, and the
ideas of different ages and nations. How intimately he had once
been conversant with the more ornamental branches of learning; in
particular, with the works of the Roman, Greek, French, and Italian
poets, appeared sufficiently from the hold which they kept of his me∣mory,
after all the different occupations and enquiries in which
his maturer faculties had been employed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The uncommon degree in which Mr. SMITH retained possession, even to the close of his life, of different branches of knowledge which he had long ceased to culti∣vate, has been often remarked to me by my learned colleague and friend, Mr. DALZEL, Professor of Greek in this University.—Mr. DALZEL mentioned particularly the readiness and correctness of Mr. SMITH's memory on philological subjects, and the acuteness and skill he displayed in various conversations with him on some of the <HI>minutiae</HI> of Greek grammar.</NOTE>. In the English lan∣guage,
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
the variety of poetical passages which he was not only
accustomed to refer to occasionally, but which he was able to repeat
with correctness, appeared surprising even to those, whose attention
had never been directed to more important acquisitions.</P>
<P>After a residence at Oxford of seven years, he returned to
Kirkaldy, and lived two years with his mother; engaged in
study, but without any fixed plan for his future life. He had
been originally destined for the Church of England, and with
that view had been sent to Oxford; but not finding the eccle∣siastical
profession suitable to his taste, he chose to consult, in
this instance, his own inclination, in preference to the wishes of
his friends; and abandoning at once all the schemes which
their prudence had formed for him, he resolved to return to his
own country, and to limit his ambition to the uncertain prospect of
obtaining, in time, some one of those moderate preferments, to
which literary attainments lead in Scotland.</P>
<P>In the year 1748, he fixed his residence at Edinburgh, and during
that and the following years, read lectures on rhetoric and belles
lettres, under the patronage of Lord KAMES. About this time, too,
he contracted a very intimate friendship, which continued without
interruption till his death, with Mr. ALEXANDER WEDDERBURN,
now Lord LOUGHBOROUGH, and with Mr. WILLIAM JOHNSTONE,
now Mr. PULTENEY.</P>
<P>At what particular period his acquaintance with Mr. DAVID
HUME commenced, does not appear from any information that
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
I have received; but from some papers, now in the possession of
Mr. HUME's nephew, and which he has been so obliging as to allow
me to peruse, their acquaintance seems to have grown into friend∣ship
before the year 1752. It was a friendship on both sides
founded on the admiration of genius, and the love of simplicity;
and which forms an interesting circumstance in the history of each
of these eminent men, from the ambition which both have shewn
to record it to posterity.</P>
<P>In 1751, he was elected Professor of Logic in the University
of Glasgow; and, the year following, he was removed to the Pro∣fessorship
of Moral Philosophy in the same University, upon the death
of Mr. THOMAS CRAIGIE, the immediate successor of Dr. HUT∣CHESON.
In this situation, he remained thirteen years; a period he
used frequently to look back to, as the most useful and happy of his
life. It was indeed a situation in which he was eminently fitted to
excel, and in which the daily labours of his profession were con∣stantly
recalling his attention to his favourite pursuits, and familiari∣sing
his mind to those important speculations he was afterwards to
communicate to the world. In this view, though it afforded, in the
mean time, but a very narrow scene for his ambition, it was pro∣bably
instrumental, in no inconsiderable degree, to the future emi∣nence
of his literary character.</P>
<P>Of Mr. SMITH's lectures while a Professor at Glasgow, no part
has been preserved, excepting what he himself published in the
Theory of Moral Sentiments and in the Wealth of Nations. The
Society therefore, I am persuaded, will listen with pleasure to the
following short account of them, for which I am indebted to a
gentleman who was formerly one of Mr. SMITH's pupils, and who
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
continued till his death to be one of his most intimate and valued
friends.</P>
<P>“In the Professorship of Logic, to which Mr. SMITH was ap∣pointed
on his first introduction into this University, he soon saw
the necessity of departing widely from the plan that had been fol∣lowed
by his predecessors, and of directing the attention of his
pupils to studies of a more interesting and useful nature than the
logic and metaphysics of the schools. Accordingly, after exhibiting
a general view of the powers of the mind, and explaining so much
of the ancient logic as was requisite to gratify curiosity with re∣spect
to an artificial method of reasoning, which had once occupied
the universal attention of the learned, he dedicated all the rest of
his time to the delivery of a system of rhetoric and belles lettres.
The best method of explaining and illustrating the various powers
of the human mind, the most useful part of metaphysics, arises from
an examination of the several ways of communicating our thoughts
by speech, and from an attention to the principles of those literary
compositions which contribute to persuasion or entertainment. By
these arts, every thing that we perceive or feel, every operation of
our minds, is expressed and delineated in such a manner, that it may
be clearly distinguished and remembered. There is, at the same
time, no branch of literature more suited to youth at their first en∣trance
upon philosophy than this, which lays hold of their taste and
their feelings.”</P>
<P>“It is much to be regretted, that the manuscript containing
Mr. SMITH's lectures on this subject was destroyed before his death.
The first part, in point of composition, was highly finished; and
the whole discovered strong marks of taste and original genius.
<PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>
From the permission given to students of taking notes, many obser∣vations
and opinions contained in these lectures have either been
detailed in separate dissertations, or ingrossed in general collections,
which have since been given to the public. But these, as might be
expected, have lost the air of originality and the distinctive cha∣racter
which they received from their first author, and are often ob∣scured
by that multiplicity of common-place matter in which they
are sunk and involved.”</P>
<P>“About a year after his appointment to the Professorship of
Logic, Mr. SMITH was elected to the chair of Moral Philosophy.
His course of lectures on this subject was divided into four parts.
The first contained Natural Theology; in which he considered the
proofs of the being and attributes of GOD, and those principles of
the human mind upon which religion is founded. The second com∣prehended
Ethics strictly so called, and consisted chiefly of the doc∣trines
which he afterwards published in his Theory of Moral Senti∣ments.
In the third part, he treated at more length of that branch
of morality which relates to <HI>justice,</HI> and which, being susceptible of
precise and accurate rules, is for that reason capable of a full and
particular explanation.”</P>
<P>“Upon this subjet he followed the plan that seems to be sug∣gested
by MONTESQUIEU; endeavouring to trace the gradual pro∣gress
of jurisprudence, both public and private, from the rudest to
the most refined ages, and to point out the effects of those arts which
contribute to subsistence, and to the accumulation of property, in
producing correspondent improvements or alterations in law and go∣vernment.
This important branch of his labours he also intended
to give to the public; but this intention, which is mentioned in
the conclusion of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, he did not live
to fulfil.”</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>
“In the last part of his lectures, he examined those political
regulations which are founded, not upon the principle of <HI>justice,</HI>
but that of <HI>expediency,</HI> and which are calculated to increase the
riches, the power, and the prosperity of a State. Under this view, he
considered the political institutions relating to commerce, to finances,
to ecclesiastical and military establishments. What he delivered
on these subjects contained the substance of the work he afterwards
published under the title of An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes
of the Wealth of Nations.”</P>
<P>“There was no situation in which the abilities of Mr. SMITH
appeared to greater advantage than as a Professor. In delivering his
lectures, he trusted almost entirely to extemporary elocution. His
manner, though not graceful, was plain and unaffected; and as he
seemed to be always interested in the subject, he never failed to in∣terest
his hearers. Each discourse consisted commonly of several dis∣tinct
propositions, which he successively endeavoured to prove and
illustrate. These propositions, when announced in general terms,
had, from their extent, not unfrequently something of the air of a
paradox. In his attempts to explain them, he often appeared, at
first, not to be sufficiently possessed of the subject, and spoke with
some hesitation. As he advanced, however, the matter seemed to
crowd upon him, his manner became warm and animated, and his
expression easy and fluent. In points susceptible of controversy, you
could easily discern, that he secretly conceived an opposition to his
opinions, and that he was led upon this account to support them
with greater energy and vehemence. By the fulness and variety of
his illustrations, the subject gradually swelled in his hands, and ac∣quired
a dimension which, without a tedious repetition of the same
views, was calculated to seize the attention of his audience, and to
afford them pleasure, as well as instruction, in following the same
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
object, through all the diversity of shades and aspects in which it
was presented, and afterwards in tracing it backwards to that ori∣ginal
proposition or general truth, from which this beautiful train
of speculation had proceeded.”</P>
<P>“His reputation as a Professor was accordingly raised very high,
and a multitude of students from a great distance resorted to the
University, merely upon his account. Those branches of science
which he taught became fashionable at this place, and his opinions
were the chief topics of discussion in clubs and literary societies.
Even the small peculiarities in his pronunciation or manner of
speaking, became frequently the objects of imitation.”</P>
<P>While Mr. Smith was thus distinguishing himself by his zeal
and ability as a public teacher, he was gradually laying the found∣ation
of a more extensive reputation, by preparing for the press
his system of morals. The first edition of this work appeared in
1759, under the title of “The Theory of Moral Sentiments.”</P>
<P>Hitherto Mr. Smith had remained unknown to the world as an
author; nor have I heard that he had made a trial of his powers
in any anonymous publications, excepting in a periodical work
called <HI>The Edinburgh Review,</HI> which was begun in the year 1755,
by some gentlemen of distinguised abilities, but which they were
prevented by other engagements from carrying farther than the
two first numbers. To this work Mr. SMITH contributed a re∣view
of Dr. JOHNSON's Dictionary of the English Language, and
also a letter, addressed to the editors, containing some general ob∣servations
on the state of literature in the different countries of
Europe. In the former of these papers, he points out some de∣fects
in Dr. JOHNSON's plan, which he censures as not sufficiently
<PB N="xx" REF="19"/>
grammatical. “The different significations of a word (he observes)
are indeed collected; but they are seldom digested into general
classes, or ranged under the meaning which the word principally
expresses: And sufficient care is not taken to distinguish the
words apparently synonymous.” To illustrate this criticism, he
copies from Dr. JOHNSON the articles BUT and HUMOUR, and
opposes to them the same articles digested agreeably to his own idea.
The various significations of the word BUT are very nicely and hap∣pily
discriminated. The other article does not seem to have been
executed with equal care.</P>
<P>The observations on the state of learning in Europe are written
with ingenuity and elegance; but are chiefly interesting, as they
shew the attention which the Author had given to the philosophy
and literature of the Continent, at a period when they were not
much studied in this island.</P>
<P>In the same volume with the Theory of Moral Sentiments,
Mr. SMITH published a Dissertation “on the Origin of Languages,
and on the different Genius of those which are original and com∣pounded.”
The remarks I have to offer on these two discourses,
I shall, for the sake of distinctness, make the subject of a separate
section.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="xxi" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, and the Dissertation on the
Origin of Languages.</HEAD>
<P>THE science of Ethics has been divided by modern writers into
two parts; the one comprehending the theory of Morals,
and the other its practical doctrines. The questions about which
the former is employed, are chiefly the two following. <HI>First,</HI> By
what principle of our constitution are we led to form the notion of
moral distinctions;—whether by that faculty which perceives the dis∣tinction
between truth and falsehood; or by a peculiar power of per∣ception,
which is <HI>pleased</HI> with one set of qualities, and <HI>displeased</HI>
with another? <HI>Secondly,</HI> What is the proper object of moral appro∣bation;
or, in other words, What is the common quality or quali∣ties
belonging to all the different modes of virtue? Is it benevo∣lence;
or a rational self-love; or a disposition to act suitably to the
different relations in which we are placed? These two questions seem
to exhaust the whole theory of Morals. The scope of the one is to as∣certain
the origin of our moral ideas; that of the other, to refer the
phenomena of moral perception to their most simple and general laws.</P>
<P>The practical doctrines of morality comprehend all those rules
of conduct which profess to point out the proper ends of human
pursuit, and the most effectual means of attaining them; to which
we may add all those literary compositions, whatever be their par∣ticular
form, which have for their aim to fortify and animate our
good dispositions, by delineations of the beauty, of the dignity, or
of the utility of Virtue.</P>
<P>I shall not enquire at present into the justness of this division.
I shall only observe, that the words▪ Theory and Practice are not,
<PB N="xxii" REF="21"/>
in this instance, employed in their usual acceptations. The theory
of Morals does not bear, for example, the same relation to the prac∣tice
of Morals, that the theory of geometry bears to practical geo∣metry.
In this last science, all the practical rules are founded on
theoretical principles previously established: But in the former science,
the practical rules are obvious to the capacities of all mankind; the
theoretical principles form one of the most difficult subjects of dis∣cussion
that have ever exercised the ingenuity of metaphysicians.</P>
<P>In illustrating the doctrines of practical morality, (if we make
allowance for some unfortunate prejudices produced or encouraged
by violent and oppressive systems of policy,) the antients seem to
have availed themselves of every light furnished by nature to hu∣man
reason; and indeed those writers who, in later times, have
treated the subject with the greatest success, are they who have
followed most closely the footsteps of the Greek and the Roman
philosophers. The theoretical question, too, concerning the essence
of virtue, or the proper <HI>object</HI> of moral approbation, was a favourite
topic of discussion in the ancient schools. The question concerning
the <HI>principle</HI> of moral approbation, though not entirely of modern
origin, has been chiefly agitated since the writings of Dr. CUD∣WORTH,
in opposition to those of Mr. HOBBES; and it is this
question accordingly, (recommended, at once, by its novelty and
difficulty to the curiosity of speculative men,) that has produced
most of the theories which characterise and distinguish from each
other the later systems of moral philosophy.</P>
<P>It was the opinion of Dr. CUDWORTH, and also of Dr. CLARKE,
that moral distinctions are perceived by that power of the mind
which distinguishes truth from falsehood. This system it was one
great object of Dr. HUTCHESON'S philosophy to refute, and in op∣position
to it, to shew that the words Right and Wrong express
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22"/>
certain agreeable and disagreeable qualities in actions, which it is
not the province of reason but of feeling to perceive; and to that
power of perception which renders us susceptible of pleasure or of
pain from the view of virtue or of vice, he gave the name of the
Moral Sense. His reasonings upon this subject are in the main ac∣quiesced
in, both by Mr. HUME and Mr. SMITH; but they differ
from him in one important particular,—Dr. HUTCHESON plainly
supposing, that the moral sense is a simple principle of our constitu∣tion,
of which no account can be given; whereas the other two
philosophers have both attempted to analyse it into other principles
more general. Their systems, however, with respect to it are very
different from each other. According to Mr. HUME, all the
qualities which are denominated virtuous, are useful either to our∣selves
or to others, and the pleasure which we derive from the view
of them is the pleasure of utility. Mr. SMITH, without rejecting
entirely Mr. HUME'S doctrine, proposes another of his own, far
more comprehensive; a doctrine with which he thinks all the
most celebrated theories of morality invented by his predecessors
coincide in part, and from some partial view of which he appre∣hends
that they have all proceeded.</P>
<P>Of this very ingenious and original theory, I shall endeavour to
give a short abstract. To those who are familiarly acquainted with
it as it is stated by its author, I am aware that the attempt may ap∣pear
superfluous; but I flatter myself that it will not be wholly use∣less
to such as have not been much conversant in these abstract
disquisitions, by presenting to them the leading principles of the
system in one connected view, without those interruptions of the
attention which necessarily arise from the author's various and happy
illustrations, and from the many eloquent digressions which animate
and adorn his composition.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="23"/>
THE fundamental principle of Mr. SMITH's theory is, that the
primary objects of our moral perceptions are the actions of other
men; and that our moral judgments with respect to our own
conduct are only applications to ourselves of decisions which we have
already passed on the conduct of our neighbour. His work accord∣ingly
consists of two parts. In the former, he explains in what
manner we learn to judge of the conduct of our neighbour; in the
latter, in what manner, by applying these judgments to ourselves,
we acquire <HI>a sense of duty.</HI></P>
<P>Our moral judgments, both with respect to our own conduct
and that of others, include two distinct perceptions: <HI>first,</HI> A percep∣tion
of conduct as right or wrong: and, <HI>secondly,</HI> A perception of
the merit or demerit of the agent. To that quality of conduct which
moralists, in general, express by the word Rectitude, Mr. SMITH
gives the name of Propriety; and he begins his theory with enquir∣ing
in what it consists, and how we are led to form the idea of it.
The leading principles of his doctrine on this subject are compre∣hended
in the following propositions:</P>
<P>1. It is from our own experience alone, that we can form any
idea of what passes in the mind of another person on any particular
occasion; and the only way in which we can form this idea, is by
supposing ourselves in the same circumstances with him, and con∣ceiving
how we should be affected if we were so situated. It is
impossible for us, however, to conceive ourselves placed in any situ∣ation,
whether agreeable or otherwise, without feeling an effect of
the same kind with what would be produced by the situation itself;
and of consequence the attention we give at any time to the circum∣stances
of our neighbour, must affect us somewhat in the same man∣ner,
although by no means in the same degree, as if these circum∣stances
were our own.</P>
<P><PB N="xxv" REF="24"/>
That this imaginary change of place with other men, is the real
source of the interest we take in their fortunes, Mr. SMITH attempts
to prove by various instances. “When we see a stroke aimed, and
just ready to fall upon the leg or arm of another person, we
naturally shrink and draw back our own leg or our own arm;
and when it does fall, we feel it in some measure, and are hurt by
it as well as the sufferer. The mob, when they are gazing at a
dancer on the slack rope, naturally writhe and twist and balance
their own bodies, as they see him do, and as they feel that they
themselves must do if in his situation.” The same thing takes
place, according to Mr. SMITH, in every case in which our attention
is turned to the condition of our neighbour. “Whatever is the pas∣sion
which arises from any object in the person principally con∣cerned,
an analogous emotion springs up, at the thought of his
situation, in the breast of every attentive spectator. In every
passion of which the mind of man is susceptible, the emotions of
the by-stander always correspond to what, by bringing the case home
to himself, he imagines should be the sentiments of the sufferer.”</P>
<P>To this principle of our nature which leads us to enter into the
situations of other men, and to partake with them in the passions
which these situations have a tendency to excite, Mr. SMITH gives
the name of <HI>sympathy</HI> or <HI>fellow-feeling,</HI> which two words he employs
as synonymous. Upon some occasions, he acknowledges, that sym∣pathy
arises merely from the view of a certain emotion in another
person; but in general it arises, not so much from the view of the
emotion, as from that of the situation which excites it.</P>
<P>2. A sympathy or fellow-feeling between different persons is
always agreeable to both. When I am in a situation which excites
any passion, it is pleasant to me to know, that the spectators of my
situation enter with me into all its various circumstances, and are
<PB N="xxvi" REF="25"/>
affected with them in the same manner as I am myself. On the
other hand, it is pleasant to the spectator to observe this correspond∣ence
of his emotions with mine.</P>
<P>3. When the spectator of another man's fituation, upon bringing
home to himself all its various circumstances, feels himself affected
in the same manner with the person principally concerned, he ap∣proves
of the affection or passion of this person as just and proper
and suitable to its object. The exceptions which occur to this obser∣vation
are, according to Mr. SMITH, only apparent. “A stranger,
for example, passes by us in the street with all the marks of the
deepest affliction; and we are immediately told, that he has just
received the news of the death of his father. It is impossible
that, in this case, we should not approve of his grief; yet it may
often happen, without any defect of humanity on our part, that,
so far from entering into the violence of his sorrow, we should
scarce conceive the first movements of concern upon his account.
We have learned, however, from experience, that such a misfor∣tune
naturally excites such a degree of sorrow; and we know,
that if we took time to examine his situation fully and in all its
parts, we should, without doubt, most sincerely sympathize with
him. It is upon the consciousness of this conditional sympathy
that our approbation of his sorrow is founded, even in those cases
in which that sympathy does not actually take place; and the ge∣neral
rules derived from our preceding experience of what our sen∣timents
would commonly correspond with, correct upon this, as up∣on
many other occasions, the impropriety of our present emotions.”</P>
<P>By the <HI>propriety</HI> therefore of any affection or passion exhibited by
another person, is to be understood its suitableness to the object
which excites it. Of this suitableness I can judge only from the
coincidence of the affection with that which I feel, when I conceive
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26"/>
myself in the same circumstances; and the perception of this coin∣cidence
is the foundation of the sentiment of <HI>moral approbation.</HI></P>
<P>4. Although, when we attend to the situation of another person,
and conceive ourselves to be placed in his circumstances, an emotion
of the same kind with that which he feels, naturally arises in our
own mind, yet this sympathetic emotion bears but a very small
proportion, in point of degree, to what is felt by the person prin∣cipally
concerned. In order, therefore, to obtain the pleasure of
mutual sympathy, nature teaches the spectator to strive as much as
he can, to raise his emotion to a level with that which the object
would really produce; and, on the other hand, she teaches the
person whose passion this object has excited, to bring it down, as
much as he can, to a level with that of the spectator.</P>
<P>5. Upon these two different efforts are founded two different sets
of virtues. Upon the effort of the spectator to enter into the situ∣ation
of the person principally concerned, and to raise his sympathetic
emotions to a level with the emotions of the actor, are founded the
gentle, the amiable virtues; the virtues of candid condescension and
indulgent humanity. Upon the effort of the person principally con∣cerned
to lower his own emotions, so as to correspond as nearly as
possible with those of the spectator, are founded the great, the awful,
and respectable virtues; the virtues of self-denial, of self-govern∣ment,
of that command of the passions, which subjects all the
movements of our nature to what our own dignity and honour, and
the propriety of our own conduct, require.</P>
<P>As a farther illustration of the foregoing doctrine, Mr. SMITH
considers particularly the degrees of the different passions which are
consistent with propriety, and endeavours to shew, that in every
case, it is decent or indecent to express a passion strongly, according
as mankind are disposed, or not disposed to sympathize with it. It is
<PB N="xxviii" REF="27"/>
unbecoming, for example, to express strongly any of those passions
which arise from a certain condition of the body; because other
men, who are not in the same condition, cannot be expected to
sympathize with them. It is unbecoming to cry out with bodily
pain; because the sympathy felt by the spectator bears no proportion
to the acuteness of what is felt by the sufferer. The case is some∣what
similar with those passions which take their origin from a par∣ticular
turn or habit of the imagination.</P>
<P>In the case of the unsocial passions of hatred and resentment, the
sympathy of the spectator is divided between the person who feels
the passion, and the person who is the object of it. “We are con∣cerned
for both, and our fear for what the one may suffer damps
our resentment for what the other has suffered.” Hence the im∣perfect
degree in which we sympathize with such passions; and the
propriety, when we are under their influence, of moderating their
expression to a much greater degree than is required in the case of
any other emotions.</P>
<P>The reverse of this takes place with respect to all the social and
benevolent affections. The sympathy of the spectator with the
person who feels them, coincides with his concern for the person
who is the object of them. It is this redoubled sympathy which
renders these affections so peculiarly becoming and agreeable.</P>
<P>The selfish emotions of grief and joy, when they are conceived
on account of our own private good or bad fortune, hold a sort of
middle place between our social and our unsocial passions. They
are never so graceful as the one set, nor so odious as the other.
Even when excessive, they are never so disagreeable as excessive re∣sentment;
because no opposite sympathy can ever interest us against
them: and when most suitable to their objects, they are never so
agreeable as impartial humanity and just benevolence; because no
double sympathy can ever interest us for them.</P>
<P><PB N="xxix" REF="28"/>
After these general speculations concerning the propriety of ac∣tions,
Mr. SMITH examines how far the judgments of mankind
concerning it are liable to be influenced in particular cases, by the
prosperous or the adverse circumstances of the agent. The scope
of his reasoning on this subject is directed to shew, (in opposition
to the common opinion,) that when there is no envy in the case,
our propensity to sympathize with joy is much stronger than our
propensity to sympathize with sorrow; and, of consequence, that it
is more easy to obtain the approbation of mankind in prosperity
than in adversity. From the same principle he traces the origin of
ambition, or of the desire of rank and pre-eminence; the great ob∣ject
of which passion is, to attain that situation which sets a man
most in the view of general sympathy and attention, and gives him
an easy empire over the affections of others.</P>
<P>Having finished the analysis of our sense of propriety and of im∣propriety,
Mr. SMITH proceeds to consider our sense of merit and
demerit; which he thinks has also a reference, in the first instance,
not to our own characters, but to the characters of our neighbours.
In explaining the origin of this part of our moral constitution, he
avails himself of the same principle of sympathy, into which he re∣solves
the sentiment of moral approbation.</P>
<P>The words <HI>propriety</HI> and <HI>impropriety,</HI> when applied to an affection
of the mind, are used in this theory (as has been already observed)
to express the suitableness or unsuitableness of the affection to its ex∣citing
<HI>cause.</HI> The words <HI>merit</HI> and <HI>demerit</HI> have always a reference
(according to Mr. SMITH) to the <HI>effect</HI> which the affection tends to
produce. When the tendency of an affection is beneficial, the agent
appears to us a proper object of reward; when it is hurtful, he ap∣pears
the proper object of punishment.</P>
<P><PB N="xxx" REF="29"/>
The principles in our nature which most directly prompt us to re∣ward
and to punish, are gratitude and resentment. To say of a per∣son,
therefore, that he is deserving of reward or of punishment, is
to say, in other words, that he is a proper object of gratitude or of
resentment; or, which amounts to the same thing, that he is to
some person or persons the object of a gratitude or of a resentment,
which every reasonable man is ready to adopt and sympathize with.</P>
<P>It is however very necessary to observe, that we do not thorough∣ly
sympathize with the gratitude of one man towards another,
merely because this other has been the cause of his good fortune,
unless he has been the cause of it from motives which we entirely go
along with. Our sense, therefore, of the good desert of an action,
is a compounded sentiment, made up of an indirect sympathy with
the person to whom the action is beneficial, and of a direct sympathy
with the affections and motives of the agent.—The same remark
applies, <HI>mutatis inutandis,</HI> to our sense of demerit, or of ill-desert.</P>
<P>From these principles, it is inferred, that the only actions
which appear to us deserving of reward, are actions of a bene∣ficial
tendency, proceeding from proper motives; the only actions
which seem to deserve punishment, are actions of a hurtful tenden∣cy,
proceeding from improper motives. A mere want of beneficence
exposes to no punishment; because the mere want of beneficence
tends to do no real positive evil. A man, on the other hand, who
is barely innocent, and contents himself with observing strictly the
laws of justice with respect to others, can merit only, that his
neighbours, in their turn, should observe religiously the same laws
with respect to him.</P>
<P>These observations lead Mr. SMITH to anticipate a little the sub∣ject
of the second great division of his work, by a short enquiry
<PB N="xxxi" REF="30"/>
into the origin of our sense of justice <HI>as applicable to our own con∣duct;</HI>
and also of our sentiments of remorse, and of good desert.</P>
<P>The origin of our sense of justice, as well as of all our other
moral sentiments, he accounts for by means of the principle of
sympathy. When I attend only to the feelings of my own breast,
my own happiness appears to me of far greater consequence than
that of all the world besides. But I am conscious, that in this
excessive preference, other men cannot possibly sympathize with
me, and that to them I appear only one of the crowd, in whom
they are no more interested than in any other individual. If I wish,
therefore, to secure their sympathy and approbation, (which, ac∣cording
to Mr. SMITH, are the objects of the strongest desire of
my nature,) it is necessary for me to regard my happiness, not in
that light in which it appears to myself, but in that light in which
it appears to mankind in general. If an unprovoked injury is of∣fered
to me, I know that society will sympathize with my resent∣ment;
but if I injure the interests of another, who never injured
me, merely because they stand in the way of my own, I perceive
evidently, that society will sympathize with <HI>his</HI> resentment, and
that I shall become the object of general indignation.</P>
<P>When, upon any occasion, I am led by the violence of passion
to overlook these considerations, and, in the case of a competition
of interests, to act according to my own feelings, and not accord∣ing
to those of impartial spectators, I never fail to incur the punish∣ment
of remorse. When my passion is gratified, and I begin to re∣flect
coolly on my conduct, I can no longer enter into the mo∣tives
from which it proceeded; it appears as improper to me as to
the rest of the world; I lament the effects it has produced; I pity
the unhappy sufferer whom I have injured; and I feel myself a just
object of indignation to mankind. “Such, says Mr. SMITH, is the
<PB N="xxxii" REF="31"/>
nature of that sentiment which is properly called remorse. It is
made up of shame from the sense of the impropriety of past con∣duct;
of grief for the effects of it; of pity for those who suffer by
it; and of the dread and terror of punishment from the conscious∣ness
of the justly provoked resentment of all rational creatures.”</P>
<P>The opposite behaviour of him who, from proper motives, has
performed a generous action, inspires, in a similar manner, the op∣posite
sentiment of conscious merit, or of deserved reward.</P>
<P>The foregoing observations contain a general summary of Mr.
SMITH'S principles with respect to the origin of our moral senti∣ments,
in so far at least as they relate to the conduct of others.
He acknowledges, at the same time, that the sentiments of which
we are conscious, on particular occasions, do not always coincide
with these principles; and that they are frequently modified by
other considerations very different from the propriety or impropri∣ety
of the affections of the agent, and also from the beneficial or
hurtful tendency of these affections. The good or the bad conse∣quences
which accidentally follow from an action, and which, as
they do not depend on the agent, ought undoubtedly, in point of
justice, to have no influence on our opinion, either of the propri∣ety
or the merit of his conduct, scarcely ever fail to influence
considerably our judgment with respect to both; by leading us to
form a good or a bad opinion of the prudence with which the ac∣tion
was performed, and by animating our sense of the merit or
demerit of his design. These facts, however, do not furnish any
objections which are peculiarly applicable to Mr. SMITH'S theory;
for whatever hypothesis we may adopt with respect to the origin of
our moral perceptions, all men must acknowledge, that in so far as
the prosperous or the unprosperous event of an action depends on
fortune or on accident, it ought neither to increase nor to diminish
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="32"/>
our moral approbation or disapprobation of the agent. And accor∣dingly
it has, in all ages of the world, been the complaint of mo∣ralists,
that the actual sentiments of mankind should so often be in
opposition to this equitable and indisputable maxim. In examining,
therefore, this irregularity of our moral sentiments, Mr. SMITH is
to be considered, not as obviating an objection peculiar to his own
system, but as removing a difficulty which is equally connected with
every theory on the subject which has ever been proposed. So
far as I know, he is the first philosopher who has been fully aware
of the importance of the difficulty, and he has indeed treated it
with great ability and success. The explanation which he gives
of it is not warped in the least by any peculiarity in his own
scheme; and, I must own, it appears to me to be the most solid
and valuable improvement he has made in this branch of science.
It is impossible to give any abstract of it in a sketch of this kind;
and therefore I must content myself with remarking, that it consists
of three parts. The first explains the causes of this irregularity of
sentiment; the second, the extent of its influence; and the third,
the important purposes to which it is subservient. His remarks on
the last of these heads are more particularly ingenious and pleasing;
as their object is to shew, in opposition to what we should be dis∣posed
at first to apprehend, that when nature implanted the seeds of
this irregularity in the human breast, her leading intention was, to
promote the happiness and perfection of the species.</P>
<P>The remaining part of Mr. SMITH's theory is employed in
shewing, in what manner <HI>our sense of duty</HI> comes to be formed, in
consequence of an application to ourselves of the judgments we
have previously passed on the conduct of others.</P>
<P>In entering upon this enquiry, which is undoubtedly the most
important in the work, and for which the foregoing speculations
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="33"/>
are, according to Mr. SMITH's theory, a necessary preparation, he
begins with stating <HI>the fact</HI> concerning our consciousness of merited
praise or blame; and it must be owned, that the first aspect of the
fact, as he himself states it, appears not very favourable to his prin∣ciples.
That the great object of a wise and virtuous man is not to
act in such a manner as to obtain the actual approbation of those
around him, but to act so as to render himself the <HI>just</HI> and <HI>proper</HI>
object of their approbation, and that his satisfaction with his own con∣duct
depends much more on the consciousness of <HI>deserving</HI> this ap∣probation
than from that of really enjoying it, he candidly ac∣knowledges;
but still he insists, that although this may seem, at
first view, to intimate the existence of some moral faculty which is
not borrowed from without, our moral sentiments have always
some secret reference, either to what are, or to what upon a certain
condition would be, or to what we imagine ought to be, the senti∣ments
of others; and that if it were possible, that a human crea∣ture
could grow up to manhood without any communication with
his own species, he could no more think of his own character, or
of the propriety or demerit of his own sentiments and conduct,
than of the beauty or deformity of his own face. There is indeed
a tribunal within the breast, which is the supreme arbiter of all our
actions, and which often mortifies us amidst the applause, and sup∣ports
us under the censure of the world; yet still, he contends, that
if we enquire into the origin of its institution, we shall find, that
its jurisdiction is, in a great measure, derived from the authority
of that very tribunal whose decisions it so often and so justly re∣verses.</P>
<P>When
we first come into the world, we, for some time, fondly
pursue the impossible project of gaining the good-will and approba∣tion
of every body. We soon however find, that this universal
approbation is unattainable; that the most equitable conduct must
<PB N="xxxv" REF="34"/>
frequently thwart the interests or the inclinations of particular
persons, who will seldom have candour enough to enter into the
propriety of our motives, or to see that this conduct, how disagree∣able
soever to them, is perfectly suitable to our situation. In order
to defend ourselves from such partial judgments, we soon learn to
set up in our own minds, a judge between ourselves and those we
live with. We conceive ourselves as acting in the presence of a
person, who has no particular relation, either to ourselves, or to
those whose interests are affected by our conduct; and we study to
act in such a manner as to obtain the approbation of this supposed
impartial spectator. It is only by consulting him that we can see
whatever relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions.</P>
<P>There are two different occasions, on which we examine our
own conduct, and endeavour to view it in the light in which the
impartial spectator would view it. First, when we are about to act;
and, secondly, after we have acted. In both cases, our views are
very apt to be partial.</P>
<P>When we are about to act, the eagerness of passion seldom allows
us to consider what we are doing with the candour of an indifferent
person. When the action is over, and the passions which prompted
it have subsided, although we can undoubtedly enter into the senti∣ments
of the indifferent spectator much more coolly than before,
yet it is so disagreeable to us to think ill of ourselves, that we often
purposely turn away our view from those circumstances which
might render our judgment unfavourable.—Hence that self-deceit
which is the source of half the disorders of human life.</P>
<P>In order to guard ourselves against its delusions, nature leads us to
form insensibly, by our continual observations upon the conduct of
others, certain general rules concerning what is sit and proper either
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="35"/>
to be done or avoided. Some of their actions shock all our na∣tural
sentiments; and when we observe other people affected in the
same manner with ourselves, we are confirmed in the belief, that
our disapprobation was just. We naturally therefore lay it down
as a general rule, that all such actions are to be avoided, as tending
to render us odious, contemptible, or punishable; and we endeavour,
by habitual reflection, to fix this general rule in our minds, in order
to correct the misrepresentations of self-love, if we should ever be
called on to act in similar circumstances. The man of furious re∣sentment,
if he were to listen to the dictates of that passion, would
perhaps regard the death of his enemy as but a small compensation
for a trifling wrong. But his observations on the conduct of others
have taught him how horrible such sanguinary revenges are; and
he has impressed it on his mind as an invariable rule, to abstain
from them upon all occasions. This rule preserves its authority
with him, checks the impetuosity of his passion, and corrects the
partial views which self-love suggests; although, if this had been
the first time in which he considered such an action, he would un∣doubtedly
have determined it to be just and proper, and what every
impartial spectator would approve of.—A regard to such general
rules of morality constitutes, according to Mr. SMITH, what is pro∣perly
called <HI>the sense of duty.</HI></P>
<P>I before hinted, that Mr. SMITH does not reject entirely from his
system that principle of <HI>utility,</HI> of which the perception in any ac∣tion
or character constitutes, according to Mr. HUME, the senti∣ment
of moral approbation. That no qualities of the mind are ap∣proved
of as virtues, but such as are useful or agreeable, either to
the person himself or to others, he admits to be a proposition that
holds universally; and he also admits, that the sentiment of appro∣bation
with which we regard virtue, is enlivened by the percep∣tion
of this utility, or, as he explains the fact, it is enlivened by
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="36"/>
our sympathy with the happiness of those to whom the utility ex∣tends:
But still he insists, that it is not the view of this utility which
is either the first or principal source of moral approbation.</P>
<P>To sum up the whole of his doctrine in a few words. “When
we approve of any character or action, the sentiments which we
feel are derived from four different sources. First, we sympa∣thize
with the motives of the agent; secondly, we enter into the
gratitude of those who receive the benesit of his actions; thirdly,
we observe that his conduct has been agreeable to the general
rules by which those two sympathies generally act; and, lastly,
when we consider such actions as making a part of a system of
behaviour which tends to promote the happiness either of the indi∣vidual
or of society, they appear to derive a beauty from this
utility, not unlike that which we ascribe to any well-contrived
machine.” These different sentiments, he thinks, exhaust com∣pletely,
in every instance that can be supposed, the compounded
sentiment of moral approbation. “After deducting, says he, in
any one particular case, all that must be acknowledged to proceed
from some one or other of these four principles, I should be glad
to know what remains; and I shall freely allow this overplus to
be ascribed to a moral sense, or to any other peculiar faculty,
provided any body will ascertain precisely what this overplus is.”</P>
<P>Mr. SMITH'S opinion concerning the nature of virtue, is involved
in his theory concerning the principle of moral approbation. The
idea of virtue, he thinks, always implies the idea of propriety, or
of the suitableness of the affection to the object which excites
it; which suitableness, according to him, can be determined in no
other way than by the sympathy of impartial spectators with the
motives or the agent. But still he apprehends, that this description
of virtue is incomplete; for although in every virtuous action pro∣priety
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="37"/>
is an essential ingredient, it is not always the sole ingredient.
Beneficent actions have in them another quality, by which they
appear, not only to deserve approbation, but recompence, and ex∣cite
a superior degree of esteem, arising from a double sympathy
with the motives of the agent, and the gratitude of those who are
the objects of his affection. In this respect, beneficence appears
to him to be distinguished from the inferior virtues of prudence,
vigilance, circumspection, temperance, constancy, firmness, which
are always regarded with approbation, but which confer no merit.
This distinction, he apprehends, has not been sufficiently attended
to by moralists; the principles of some affording no explanation of
the approbation we bestow on the inferior virtues; and those of
others accounting as imperfectly for the peculiar excellency which
the supreme virtue of beneficence is acknowledged to possess.</P>
<P>Such are the outlines of Mr. SMITH's Theory of Moral Senti∣ments;
a work which, whatever opinion we may entertain of the
justness of its conclusions, must be allowed by all to be a singular
effort of invention, ingenuity, and subtilty. For my own part I
must confess, that it does not coincide with my notions concerning
the foundation of Morals; but I am convinced, at the same time,
that it contains a large mixture of important truth, and that, al∣though
the author has sometimes been misled by too great a desire
of generalizing his principles, he has had the merit of directing the
attention of philosophers to a view of human nature which had
formerly in a great measure escaped their notice. Of the great pro∣portion
of just and found reasoning which the theory involves, its
striking plausibility is a sufficient proof; for as the author himself
has remarked, no system in morals can well gain our assent, if it
does not border, in some respects, upon the truth. “A system of
natural philosophy, (he observes,) may appear very plausible, and
be for a long time very generally received in the world, and
<PB N="xxxix" REF="38"/>
yet have no foundation in nature; but the author who should
assign as the cause of any natural sentiment, some principle which
neither had any connection with it, nor resembled any other
principle which had some connection, would appear absurd and
ridiculous to the most injudicious and unexperienced reader.”
The merit, however, of Mr. SMITH's performance does not rest
here. No work, undoubtedly, can be mentioned, ancient or mo∣dern,
which exhibits so complete a view of those facts with respect
to our moral perceptions, which it is one great object of this branch
of science to refer to their general laws; and upon this account, it
well deserves the careful study of all whose taste leads them to pro∣secute
similar enquiries. These facts are indeed frequently expressed
in a language which involves the author's peculiar theories: But
they are always presented in the most happy and beautiful lights;
and it is easy for an attentive reader, by stripping them of hypo∣thetical
terms, to state them to himself with that logical precision,
which, in such very difficult disquisitions, can alone conduct us
with certainty to the truth.</P>
<P>It is proper to observe farther, that with the theoretical doctrines
of the book, there are every where interwoven, with singular taste
and address, the purest and most elevated maxims concerning the
practical conduct of life; and that it abounds throughout with in∣teresting
and instructive delineations of characters and manners.
A considerable part of it too is employed in collateral enquiries,
which, upon every hypothesis that can be formed concerning the
foundation of morals, are of equal importance. Of this kind is the
speculation formerly mentioned, with respect to the influence of
fortune on our moral sentiments, and another speculation, no less
valuable, with respect to the influence of custom and fashion on the
same part of our constitution.</P>
<P><PB N="xl" REF="39"/>
The style in which Mr. SMITH has conveyed the fundamental
principles on which his theory rests, does not seem to me to be so
perfectly fuited to the subject as that which he employs on most
other occasions. In communicating ideas which are extremely ab∣stract
and subtile, and about which it is hardly possible to reason
correctly, without the scrupulous use of appropriated terms, he
sometimes presents to us a choice of words, by no means strictly
synonymous, so as to divert the attention from a precise and steady
conception of his proposition; and a similar effect is, in other in∣stances,
produced by that diversity of forms which, in the course
of his copious and seducing composition, the same truth insensibly
assumes. When the subject of his work leads him to address the
imagination and the heart; the variety and felicity of his illustra∣tions;
the richness and fluency of his eloquence; and the skill
with which he wins the attention and commands the passions of his
readers, leave him, among our English moralists, without a rival.</P>
<P>THE Dissertation on the Origin of Languages, which now forms
a part of the same volume with the Theory of Moral Sentiments,
was, I believe, first annexed to the second edition of that work. It
is an essay of great ingenuity, and on which the author himself set
a high value; but, in a general review of his publications, it de∣serves
our attention less, on account of the opinions it contains, than
as a specimen of a particular sort of enquiry, which, so far as I
know, is entirely of modern origin, and which seems, in a pecu∣liar
degree, to have interested Mr. SMITH's curiosity. Something
very similar to it may be traced in all his different works, whether
moral, political, or literary; and on all these subjects he has exem∣plified
it with the happiest success.</P>
<P><PB N="xli" REF="40"/>
When, in such a period of society as that in which we live, we
compare our intellectual acquirements, our opinions, manners, and
institutions, with those which prevail among rude tribes, it cannot
fail to occur to us as an interesting question, by what gradual steps
the transition has been made from the first simple efforts of uncul∣tivated
nature, to a state of things so wonderfully artisicial and com∣plicated.
Whence has arisen that systematical beauty which we ad∣mire
in the structure of a cultivated language; that analogy which
runs through the mixture of languages spoken by the most remote
and unconnected nations; and those peculiarities by which they are
all distinguished from each other? Whence the origin of the differ∣ent
sciences and of the different arts; and by what chain has the mind
been led from their first rudiments to their last and most resined im∣provements?
Whence the astonishing fabric of the political union;
the fundamental principles which are common to all governments;
and the different forms which civilized society has assumed in dif∣ferent
ages of the world? On most of these subjects very little in∣formation
is to be expected from history; for long before that stage
of society when men begin to think of recording their transactions,
many of the most important steps of their progress have been made.
A few insulated facts may perhaps be collected from the casual ob∣servations
of travellers, who have viewed the arrangements of rude
nations; but nothing, it is evident, can be obtained in this way,
which approaches to a regular and connected detail of human im∣provement.</P>
<P>In this want of direct evidence, we are under a necessity of sup∣plying
the place of fact by conjecture; and when we are unable to
ascertain how men have actually conducted themselves upon parti∣cular
occasions, of considering in what manner they are likely to
have proceeded, from the principles of their nature, and the cir∣cumstances
of their external situation. In such enquiries, the de∣tached
<PB N="xlii" REF="41"/>
facts which travels and voyages afford us, may frequently
serve as land-marks to our speculations; and sometimes our con∣clusions
<HI>a priori,</HI> may tend to confirm the credibility of facts, which,
on a superficial view, appeared to be doubtful or incredible.</P>
<P>Nor are such theoretical views of human affairs subservient merely
to the gratification of curisity. In examining the history of man∣kind,
as well as in examining the phenomena of the material
world, when we cannot trace the process by which an event <HI>has
been</HI> produced, it is often of importance to be able to shew how it
<HI>may have been</HI> produced by natural causes. Thus, in the instance
which has suggested these remarks, although it is impossible to de∣termine
with certainty what the steps were by which any particular
language was formed, yet if we can shew, from the known prin∣ciples
of human nature, how all its various parts might gradually
have arisen, the mind is not only to a certain degree satisfied, but
a check is given to that indolent philosophy, which refers to a mi∣racle,
whatever appearances, both in the natural and moral worlds,
it is unable to explain.</P>
<P>To this species of philosophical investigation, which has no ap∣propriated
name in our language, I shall take the liberty of giving
the title of <HI>Theoretical</HI> or <HI>Conjectural History;</HI> an expression which
coincides pretty nearly in its meaning with that of <HI>Natural History,</HI>
as employed by Mr. HUME<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Natural History of Religion.</NOTE>, and with what some French writers
have called <HI>Histoire Raisonnée.</HI></P>
<P>The mathematical sciences, both pure and mixed, afford, in many
of their branches, very favourable subjects for theoretical history; and
a very competent judge, the late M. d'ALEMBERT, has recommend∣ed
<PB N="xliii" REF="42"/>
this arrangement of their elementary principles, which is founded
on the natural succession of inventions and discoveries, as the best
adapted for interesting the curiosity and exercising the genius of stu∣dents.
The same author points out as a model a passage in MON∣TUCLA's
History of Mathematics, where an attempt is made to ex∣hibit
the gradual progress of philosophical speculation, from the first
conclusions suggested by a general survey of the heavens, to the
doctrines of COPERNICUS. It is somewhat remarkable, that a theo∣retical
history of this very science (in which we have, perhaps, a
better opportunity than in any other instance whatever, of comparing
the natural advances of the mind with the actual succession of hy∣pothetical
systems) was one of Mr. SMITH's earliest compositions,
and is one of the very small number of his manuscripts which he
did not destroy before his death.</P>
<P>I already hinted, that enquiries perfectly analagous to these may
be applied to the modes of government, and to the municipal insti∣tutions
which have obtained among different nations. It is but
lately, however, that these important subjects have been considered
in this point of view; the greater part of politicians before the time
of MONTESQUIEU, having contented themselves with an historical
statement of facts, and with a vague reference of laws to the wisdom
of particular legislators, or to accidental circumstances, which it is
now impossible to ascertain. MONTESQUIEU, on the contrary,
considered laws as originating chiefly from the circumstances of so∣ciety;
and attempted to account, from the changes in the condition
of mankind, which take place in the different stages of their pro∣gress,
for the corresponding alterations which their institutions un∣dergo.
It is thus, that in his occasional elucidations of the Roman
jurisprudence, instead of bewildering himself among the erudition
of scholiasts and of antiquaries, we frequently find him borrowing
his lights from the most remote and unconnected quarters of the
<PB N="xliv" REF="43"/>
globe, and combining the casual observations of illiterate travellers
and navigators, into a philosophical commentary on the history of
law and of manners.</P>
<P>The advances made in this line of enquiry since MONTES∣QUIEU's
time have been great. Lord KAMES, in his Historical
Law Tracts, has given some excellent specimens of it, particularly in
his Essays on the History of Property and of Criminal Law, and
many ingenious speculations of the same kind occur in the works of
Mr. MILLAR.</P>
<P>In Mr. SMITH's writings, whatever be the nature of his subject,
he seldom misses an opportunity of indulging his curiosity, in tracing
from the principles of human nature, or from the circumstances of
society, the origin of the opinions and the institutions which he de∣scribes.
I formerly mentioned a fragment concerning the History
of Astronomy which he has left for publication; and I have heard
him say more than once, that he had projected, in the earlier part of
his life, a history of the other sciences on the same plan. In his
Wealth of Nations, various disquisitions are introduced which have
a like object in view, particularly the theoretical delineation he has
given of the natural progress of opulence in a country; and his in∣vestigation
of the causes which have inverted this order in the dif∣ferent
countries of modern Europe. His lectures on jurisprudence
seem, from the account of them formerly given, to have abounded
in such enquiries.</P>
<P>I am informed by the same gentleman who favoured me with the
account of Mr. SMITH's lectures at Glasgow, that he had heard him
sometimes hint an intention of writing a treatise upon the Greek
and Roman republics. “And after all that has been published on
that subject, I am convinced (says he), that the observations of
<PB N="xlv" REF="44"/>
Mr. SMITH would have suggested many new and important
views concerning the internal and domestic circumstances of those
nations, which would have displayed their several systems of po∣licy,
in a light much less artificial than that in which they have hi∣therto
appeared.”</P>
<P>The same turn of thinking was frequently, in his social hours,
applied to more familiar subjects; and the fanciful theories which,
without the least affectation of ingenuity, he was continually start∣ing
upon all the common topics of discourse, gave to his conversa∣tion
a novelty and variety that were quite inexhaustible. Hence too
the minuteness and accuracy of his knowledge on many trifling ar∣ticles
which, in the course of his speculations, he had been led to
consider from some new and interesting point of view; and of
which his lively and circumstantial descriptions amused his friends
the more, that he seemed to be habitually inattentive, in so remark∣able
a degree, to what was passing around him.</P>
<P>I have been led into these remarks by the Dissertation on the For∣mation
of Languages, which exhibits a very beautiful specimen of
theoretical history, applied to a subject equally curious and difficult.
The analogy between the train of thinking from which it has taken its
rise, and that which has suggested a variety of his other disquisitions,
will, I hope, be a sufficient apology for the length of this digression;
more particularly, as it will enable me to simplify the account
which I am to give afterwards, of his enquiries concerning political
oeconomy.</P>
<P>I shall only observe farther on this head, that when different theo∣retical
histories are proposed by different writers, of the progress of
the human mind in any one line of exertion, these theories are not
<PB N="xlvi" REF="45"/>
always to be understood as standing in opposition to each other. If
the progress delineated in all of them be plausible, it is possible at
least, that they may all have been realized; for human affairs never
exhibit, in any two instances, a perfect uniformity. But whether
they have been realized or no, is often a question of little conse∣quence.
In most cases, it is of more importance to ascertain the pro∣gress
that is most simple, than the progress that is most agreeable to
fact; for, paradoxical as the proposition may appear, it is certainly
true, that the real progress is not always the most natural. It may
have been determined by particular accidents, which are not likely
again to occur, and which cannot be considered as forming any part
of that general provision which nature has made for the improvement
of the race.</P>
<P>IN order to make some amends for the length (I am afraid I
may add for the tediousness) of this section, I shall subjoin to it an
original letter of Mr. HUME's, addressed to Mr. SMITH, soon after
the publication of his Theory. It is strongly marked with that
easy and affectionate pleasantry which distinguished Mr. HUME's
epistolary correspondence, and is entitled to a place in this Memoir,
on account of its connection with an important event of Mr. SMITH's
life, which soon after removed him into a new scene, and influenced,
to a considerable degree, the subsequent course of his studies. The
letter is dated from London, 12th April 1759.</P>
<P>“I give you thanks for the agreeable present of your Theory.
WEDDERBURN and I made presents of our copies to such of our ac∣quaintances
as we thought good judges, and proper to spread the
<PB N="xlvii" REF="46"/>
reputation of the book. I sent one to the Duke of ARGYLE, to
Lord LYTTLETON, HORACE WALPOLE, SOAME JENNYNS, and
BURKE, an Irish gentleman, who wrote lately a very pretty trea∣tise
on the Sublime. MILLAR desired my permission to send one
in your name to Dr. WARBURTON. I have delayed writing to
you till I could tell you something of the success of the book, and
could prognosticate with some probability, whether it should be
finally damned to oblivion, or should be registered in the temple of
immortality. Though it has been published only a few weeks, I
think there appear already such strong symptoms, that I can almost
venture to foretel its fate. It is in short this—But I have
been interrupted in my letter by a foolish impertinent visit of one
who has lately come from Scotland. He tells me that the Univer∣sity
of Glasgow intend to declare ROUET's office vacant, upon his
going abroad with Lord HOPE. I question not but you will have
our friend FERGUSON in your eye, in case another project for pro∣curing
him a place in the University of Edinburgh should fail.
FERGUSON has very much polished and improved his treatise on
Refinement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Published afterwards under the title of “An Essay on the History of Civil Society.”</NOTE>, and with some amendments it will make an admir∣able
book, and discovers an elegant and a singular genius. The
Epigoniad, I hope, will do; but it is somewhat up-hill work. As
I doubt not but you consult the reviews sometimes at present, you
will see in the Critical Review a letter upon that poem; and I desire
you to employ your conjectures in finding out the author. Let me
see a sample of your skill in knowing hands by your guessing at the
person. I am afraid of Lord KAMES's Law Tracts. A man might
as well think of making a fine sauce by a mixture of wormwood and
aloes, as an agreeable composition by joining metaphysics and Scotch
law. However, the book, I believe, has merit; though few people
will take the pains of diving into it. But, to return to your book,
<PB N="xlviii" REF="47"/>
and its success in this town, I must tell you—A plague of
interruptions! I ordered myself to be denied; and yet here is one
that has broke in upon me again. He is a man of letters, and we
have had a good deal of literary conversation. You told me that you
was curious of literary anecdotes, and therefore I shall inform you
of a few that have come to my knowledge. I believe I have men∣tioned
to you already HELVETIUS's book <HI>de l'Esprit.</HI> It is worth
your reading, not for its philosophy, which I do not highly value,
but for its agreeable composition. I had a letter from him a few days
ago, wherein he tells me that my name was much oftener in the
manuscript, but that the Censor of books at Paris obliged him to
strike it out. VOLTAIRE has lately published a small work called
<HI>Candide, oul'Optimisine.</HI> I shall give you a detail of it—But what
is all this to my book? say you.—My dear Mr. SMITH, have patience:
Compose yourself to tranquillity: Shew yourself a philosopher in
practice as well as profession: Think on the emptiness, and rashness,
and futility of the common judgments of men: How little they are
regulated by reason in any subject, much more in philosophical sub∣jects,
which so far exceed the comprehension of the vulgar.</P>
<Q><L>—Non si quid turbida Roma,</L>
<L>Elevet, accedas: examenve improbum in illa</L>
<L>Castiges trutina: nec te quaesiveris extra.</L></Q>
<P>A wise man's kingdom is his own breast; or, if he ever looks
farther, it will only be to the judgment of a select few, who are
free from prejudices, and capable of examining his work. Nothing
indeed can be a stronger presumption of falsehood than the appro∣bation
of the multitude; and PHOCION, you know, always suspect∣ed
himself of some blunder, when he was attended with the ap∣plauses
of the populace.</P>
<P><PB N="xlix" REF="48"/>
“Supposing, therefore, that you have duly prepared yourself for
the worst by all these reflections, I proceed to tell you the melancho∣ly
news, that your book has been very unfortunate; for the public
seem disposed to applaud it extremely. It was looked for by the
foolish people with some impatience; and the mob of literati are be∣ginning
already to be very loud in its praises. Three Bishops called
yesterday at MILLAR'S shop in order to buy copies, and to ask
questions about the author. The Bishop of PETERBOROUGH
said he had passed the evening in a company where he heard it ex∣tolled
above all books in the world. The Duke of ARGYLE is more
decisive than he uses to be in its favour. I suppose he either con∣siders
it as an exotic, or thinks the author will be serviceable to him
in the Glasgow elections. Lord LYTTLELON says, that ROBERT∣SON
and SMITH and BOWER are the glories of English literature.
OSWALD protests he does not know whether he has reaped more
instruction or entertainment from it. But you may easily judge
what reliance can be put on his judgment, who has been engaged all
his life in public business, and who never sees any faults in his friends.
MILLAR exults and brags that two thirds of the edition are already
sold, and that he is now sure of success. You see what a son of
the earth that is, to value books only by the profit they bring him.
In that view, I believe it may prove a very good book.</P>
<P>“CHARLES TOWNSEND, who passes for the cleverest fellow
in England, is so taken with the performance, that he said to
OSWALD he would put the Duke of BUCCLEUGH under the au∣thor's
care, and would make it worth his while to accept of that
charge. As soon as I heard this, I called on him twice, with a view
of talking with him about the matter, and of convincing him of the
propriety of sending that young Nobleman to Glasgow: For I could
not hope, that he could offer you any terms which would tempt you
to renounce your Professorship: But I missed him. Mr. TOWNSEND
<PB N="l" REF="49"/>
passes for being a little uncertain in his resolutions; so perhaps you
need not build much on this sally.</P>
<P>“In recompence for so many mortifying things, which nothing
but truth could have extorted from me, and which I could easily
have multiplied to a greater number, I doubt not but you are so good
a Christian as to return good for evil; and to flatter my vanity by
telling me, that all the godly in Scotland abuse me for my account of
JOHN KNOX and the Reformation. I suppose you are glad to see
my paper end, and that I am obliged to conclude with</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the Publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, till
that of The Wealth of Nations.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the publication of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, Mr.
SMITH remained four years at Glasgow, discharging his official
duties with unabated vigour, and with increasing reputation.
During that time, the plan of his lectures underwent a considerable
change. His ethical doctrines, of which he had now published so
valuable a part, occupied a much smaller portion of the course than
formerly: and accordingly, his attention was naturally directed to
a more complete illustration of the principles of jurisprudence and of
political oeconomy.</P>
<P>To this last subject, his thoughts appear to have been occasionally
turned from a very early period of life. It is probable, that the un∣interrupted
<PB N="li" REF="50"/>
friendship he had always maintained with his old com∣panion
Mr. OSWALD had some tendency to encourage him in pro∣secuting
this branch of his studies; and the publication of Mr.
HUME's political discourses in the year 1752, could not fail to con∣firm
him in those liberal views of commercial policy which had
already opened to him in the course of his own enquiries. His long
residence in one of the most enlightened mercantile towns in this
island, and the habits of intimacy in which he lived with the most
respectable of its inhabitants, afforded him an opportunity of deriv∣ing
what commercial information he stood in need of, from the
best sources; and it is a circumstance no less honourable to their li∣berality
than to his talents, that notwithstanding the reluctance
so common among men of business to listen to the conclusions of
mere speculation, and the direct opposition of his leading principles
to all the old maxims of trade, he was able, before he quitted his
situation in the University, to rank some very eminent merchants in
the number of his proselytes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I mention this fact on the respectable authority of JAMES RITCHIE, Efq. of Glasgow.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among the students who attended his lectures, and whose minds
were not previously warped by prejudice, the progress of his opi∣nions,
it may be reasonably supposed, was much more rapid. It was
this class of his friends accordingly that first adopted his system with
eagerness, and diffused a knowledge of its fundamental principles
over this part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Towards the end of 1763, Mr. SMITH received an invitation
from Mr. CHARLES TOWNSEND to accompany the Duke of BUC∣CLEUGH
on his travels; and the liberal terms in which the proposal
was made to him, added to the strong desire he had felt of visiting
the Continent of Europe, induced him to resign his office at
<PB N="lii" REF="51"/>
Glasgow. With the connection which he was led to form in conse∣quence
of this change in his situation, he had reason to be satisfied
in an uncommon degree, and he always spoke of it with pleasure
and gratitude. To the public, it was not perhaps a change equally
fortunate; as it interrupted that studious leisure for which nature
seems to have deftined him, and in which alone he could have hoped
to accomplish those literary projects which had flattered the am∣bition
of his youthful genius.</P>
<P>The alteration, however, which, from this period, took place in
his habits, was not without its advantages. He had hitherto lived
chiefly within the walls of an University; and although to a mind
like his, the observation of human nature on the smallest scale is
sufficient to convey a tolerably just conception of what passes on the
great theatre of the world, yet it is not to be doubted, that the va∣riety
of scenes through which he afterwards passed, must have en∣riched
his mind with many new ideas, and corrected many of those
misapprehensions of life and manners which the best descriptions of
them can scarcely fail to convey.—But whatever were the lights
that his travels afforded to him as a student of human nature, they
were probably useful in a still greater degree, in enabling him to
perfect that syftem of political <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conomy, of which he had already
delivered the principles in his lectures at Glafgow, and which it
was now the leading object of his fludies to prepare for the public.
The coincidence between some of these principles and the distinguish∣ing
tenets of the French <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conomists, who were at that very time in
the height of their reputation, and the intimacy in which he lived
with some of the leaders of that sect, could not fail to assist him in
inethodizing and digesting his speculations; while the valuable col∣lection
of facts, accumulated by the zealous industry of their nu∣merous
adherents, furnished him with ample materials for illustrating
and confirming his theoretical conclusions.</P>
<P><PB N="liii" REF="52"/>
After leaving Glasgow, Mr. SMITH joined the Duke of BUC∣CLEUGH
at London early in the year 1764, and set out with him
for the Continent in the month of March following. At Dover they
were met by Sir JAMES MACDONALD, who accompanied them to
Paris, and with whom Mr. SMITH laid the foundation of a friendship,
which he always mentioned with great sensibility, and of which he
often lamented the short duration. The panegyrics with which the
memory of this accomplished and amiable person has been honoured
by so many distinguished characters in the different countries of
Europe, are a proof how well fitted his talents were to command
general admiration. The esteem in which his abilities and learning
were held by Mr. SMITH, is a testimony to his extraordinary merit
of still superior value. Mr. HUME, too, seems, in this instance, to
have partaken of his friend's enthusiasm. “Were you and I toge∣ther,
(says he in a letter to Mr. SMITH,) we should shed tears at
present for the death of poor Sir JAMES MACDONALD. We
could not possibly have suffered a greater loss than in that valuable
young man.”</P>
<P>In this first visit to Paris, the Duke of BUCCLEUGH and Mr.
SMITH employed only ten or twelve days,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The day after his arrival at Paris, Mr. SMITH sent a formal resignation of his Professorship to the Rector of the University of Glasgow. “I never was more anx∣ious (says he in the conclusion of this letter) for the good of the College, than at this moment; and I sincerely with, that whoever is my successor may not only do credit to the office by his abilities, but be a comfort to the very excellent men with whom he is likely to spend his life, by the probity of his heart, and the goodness of his temper.”</P>
<P>The following extract from the records of the University, which follows immediately after Mr. SMITH's letter of resignation, is at once a testimony to his assiduity as a Pro∣fessor, and a proof of the just sense which that learned body entertained of the talents and worth of the colleague they had lost:</P>
<P>“The meeting accept of Dr. SMITH'S resignation, in terms of the above letter, and the office of Professor of Moral Philosophy in this University is therefore hereby declared to be vacant. The University, at the fame time, cannot help expressing their sincere regret at the removal of Dr. SMITH, whose distinguished probity and amiable qualitics procured him the esteem and affection of his colleagues; and whose uncommon genius, great abilities, and extensive learning, did so much honour to this society; his elegant and ingenious Theory of Moral Sentiments having re∣commended him to the esteem of men of taste and literature throughout Europe. His happy talent in illustrating abstracted subjects, and faithful assiduity in commu∣nicating useful knowledge, distinguished him as a Professor, and at once afforded the greatest pleasure and the most important instruction to the youth under his care.”</P></NOTE>, after which they pro∣ceeded
<PB N="liv" REF="53"/>
to Thoulouse, where they fixed their residence for eighteen
months; and where, in addition to the pleasure of an agrecable so∣ciety,
Mr. SMITH had an opportunity of correcting and extending
his information concerning the internal policy of France, by the in∣timacy
in which he lived with some of the principal persons of the
Parliament.</P>
<P>From Thoulouse they went, by a pretty extensive tour, through
the south of France to Geneva. Here they passed two months.
The late Earl STANHOPE, for whose learning and worth Mr.
SMITH entertained sincere respect, was then an inhabitant of that
republic.</P>
<P>About Christmas 1765, they returned to Paris, and remained there
till October following. The society in which Mr. SMITH spent
these ten months, may be conceived from the advantages he enjoyed,
in consequence of the recommendations of Mr. HUME. TURGOT,
QUESNAI, NECKER, d'ALEMBERT, HELVETIUS, MARMONTEL,
Madame RICCOBONI, were among the number of his acquaint∣ances;
and some of them he continued ever afterwards to reckon
among his friends. From Madame d'ANVILLE, the respectable
mother of the late excellent and much lamented Duke of ROCHE∣FOUCAULD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following letter, which has been very accidentally preserved, while it serves as a memorial of Mr. SMITH'S connection with the family of ROCHEFOUCAULD, is so ex∣pressive of the virtuous and liberal mind of the writer, that I am persuaded it will give pleasure to the society to record it in their Transactions.</P>
<Q>Paris, 3. Mars 1778.</Q>
<P>“Le desir de se rappeller à votre souvenir, Monsieur, quand on a eu l'honneur de vous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eonnoître, doit vous paroître fort naturel; permettez que nous faisissions pour cela, ma Mère et moi, l'occasion d'une edition nouvelle des <HI>Maximes de la Rochefoucauld,</HI> dont nous prenons la libertè de vous offrir un exemplaire. Vous voyez que nous n'avons point de rancune, puisque le mal que vous avez dit de lui dans la <HI>Théorie des Sentinens Moraux,</HI> ne nous empeche point de vous envoier ce même ouvrage. Il s'en est même fallu de peu que je ne fisse encore plus, car j'avois eu peutêtre la témérité d'entreprendre une traduction de votre <HI>Théorie;</HI> mais comme je venois de terminer la premiere partie, j'ai vu paroître la traduction de M. l'Abbé BLAVET, et j'ai été forcé de renoncer au plaisir que j'aurois eu de faire passer dans ma langue un des meilleurs ouvrages de la vôtre.”</P>
<P>“Il auroit bien fallu pour lors entreprendre une justification de mon grandpère. Peutêtre n'auroit-il pas été difficile, premierement de l'excuser, en disant, qu'il avoit toujours vu les hommes à la Cour, et dans la guerre civile, <HI>deux thèatres sur lesquels ils sont certainement plus mauvais qu'ailleurs;</HI> et ensuite de justisier par la conduite personelle de l'auteur, les principes qui sont certainement trop généralisés dans son ouvrage. Il a pris la partie pour le tout; et parceque les gens qu'il avoit eu le plus sous les yeux ètoient animés par <HI>l'amour propre,</HI> il en a fait le mobile général de tous les hommes. Au reste, quoique son ouvrage merite à certains égards d'être combattu, il est cependant estimable même pour le fond, et beaucoup pour la forme.”</P>
<P>“Permettez moi de vous demander, si nous aurons bientôt une édition complette des ceuvres de votre illustre ami M. HUME? Nous l'avons sincèrement regretté.”</P>
<P>“Recevez, je vous supplie, l'expression sincère de tous les sentimens d'estime et d'attachement avec lesquels j'ai l'honneur d'être, Monsieur, votre très humble at très obeiffant serviteur,</P>
<Q>Le Duc de la ROCHEFOUCAULD.”</Q>
<P>Mr. SMITH's last intercourse with this excellent man was in the year 1789, when he informed him by means of a friend who happened to be then at Paris, that in the future editions of his <HI>Theory</HI> the name of ROCHEFOUCAULD should be no longer classed with that of MANDEVILLE. In the enlarged edition accordingly of that work, published a short time before his death, he has suppressed his censure of the author of the <HI>Max∣imes.</HI> who seems indeed (however exceptionable many of his principles may be) to have been actuated, both in his life and writings, by motives very different from those of MANDEVILLE. The real scope of these maxims is placed, I think, in a just light by the ingenious author of the <HI>notice</HI> prefixed to the edition of them published at Paris in 1778.</P></NOTE>, he received many attentions, which he always recol∣lected
with particular gratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="lv" REF="54"/>
It is much to be regretted, that he preserved no journal of this
very interesting period of his history; and such was his aversion
<PB N="lvi" REF="55"/>
to write-letters, that I scarcely suppose any memorial of it exists in
his correspondence with his friends. The extent and accuracy of
his memory, in which he was equalled by few, made it of little con∣fequence
to himself to record in writing what he heard or saw; and
from his anxiety before his death to destroy all the papers in his
possession, he seems to have wished, that no materials should remain
for his biographers, but what were surnished by the lafting monu∣ments
of his genius, and the exemplary worth of his private life.</P>
<P>The satisfaction he enjoyed in the conversation of TURGOT may
be easily imagined. Their opinions on the most essential points of
political oeconomy were the same; and they were both animated by
the same zeal for the best interests of mankind. The favourite
studies, too, of both had directed their enquiries to subjects on which
the understandings of the ablest and the best informed are liable to be
warped, to a great degree, by prejudice and passion; and on which,
of consequence, a coincidence of judgment is peculiarly gratifying.
We are told by one of the biographers of TURGOT, that after his re∣treat
from the ministry, he occupied his leisure in a philosophical
correspondence with some of his old friends; and, in particular, that
various letters on important subjects passed between him and Mr.
SMITH. I take notice of this anecdote chiefly as a proof of the
intimacy which was understood to have subsisted between them;
for in other respects, the anecdote seems to me to be somewhat
doubtful. It is scarcely to be supposed, that Mr. SMITH would de∣stroy
the letters of such a correspondent as TURGOT; and still less
probable, that such an intercourse was carried on between them with∣out
the knowledge of any of Mr. SMITH's friends. From some
<PB N="lvii" REF="56"/>
enquiries that have been made at Paris by a gentleman of this Society
since M. SMITH'S death, I have reason to believe, that no evidence
of the correspondence exists among the papers of M. TURGOT, and
that the whole story has taken its rise from a report suggested by the
knowledge of their former intimacy. This circumstance I think it
of importance to mention, because a good deal of curiosity has
been excited by the passage in question, with respect to the fate
of the supposed letters.</P>
<P>Mr. SMITH was also well known to M. QUESNAI, the profound
and original author of the Oeconomical Table; a man (according to
Mr. SMITH'S account of him) “of the greatest modesty and sim∣plicity;”
and whose system of political oeconomy he has pro∣nounced,
“with all its imperfections,” to be “the nearest approxi∣mation
to the truth that has yet been published on the principles
of that very important science.” If he had not been prevented by
QUESNAI'S death, Mr. SMITH had once an intention (as he told me
himself) to have inscribed to him his “Wealth of Nations.”</P>
<P>It was not, however, merely the distinguished men who about this
period fixed so splendid an aera in the literary history of France, that
excited Mr. SMITH'S curiosity while he remained in Paris. His ac∣quaintance
with the polite literature both of ancient and modern
times was extensve; and amidst his various other occupations, he
had never neglected to cultivate a taste for the fine arts;—less, it is
probable, with a view to the peculiar enjoyments they convey,
(though he was by no means without sensibility to their beauties,)
than on account of their connection with the general principles of
the human mind; to an examination of which they afford the most
pleasing of all avenues. To those who speculate on this very deli∣cate
subject, a comparison of the modes of taste that prevail among
different nations, affords a valuable collection of facts; and Mr.
<PB N="lviii" REF="57"/>
SMITH, who was always disposed to ascribe to custom and fashion
their full sare in regulating the opinions of mankind with respect
to beauty, may naturally be supposed to have availed himself of every
opportunity which a foreign country afforded him of illustrating his
former theories.</P>
<P>Some of his peculiar notions, too, with respect to the imitative arts,
feem to have been much confirmed by his observations while abroad.
In accounting for the pleasure we receive from these arts, it had early
occurred to him as a fundamental principle, that a very great part of
it arises from the difficulty of the imitation; a principle which was
probably suggested to him by that of the <HI>difficulté surmontée,</HI> by which
some French critics had attempted to explain the effect of versisica∣tion
and of rhyme<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Preface to VOLTAIRE'S <HI>Oedipe,</HI> Edit. of 1729.</NOTE>. This principle Mr. SMITH pushed to the greatest
possible length, and referred to it, with singular ingenuity, a great va∣riety
of phenomena in all the different fine arts. It led him, however,
to some conclusions, which appear, at first view at least, not a little
paradoxical; and I cannot help thinking, that it warped his judgment
in many of the opinions which he was accustomed to give on the
subject of poetry.</P>
<P>The principles of dramatic composition had more particularly
attracted his attention; and the history of the theatre, both in an∣cient
and modern times, had furnished him with some of the most
remarkable facts on which his theory of the imitative arts was
founded. From this theory it seemed to follow as a consequence,
that the same circumstances which, in tragedy, give to blank verse an
advantage over prose, should give to rhyme an advantage over blank
verse; and Mr. SMITH had always inclined to that opinion. Nay,
be had gone so far as to extend the same doctrine to comedy; and
<PB N="lix" REF="58"/>
to regret that those excellent pictures of life and manners which the
English stage affords, had not been executed after the model of the
French school. The admiration with which he regarded the great
dramatic authors of France tended to consirm him in these opinions;
and this admiration (resulting originally from the general character
of his taste, which delighted more to remark that pliancy of genius
which accommodates itself to established rules, than to wonder at the
bolder flights of an undisciplined imagination) was increased to a
great degree, when he saw the beauties that had struck him in the
closet, heightened by the utmost perfection of theatrical exhibition.
In the last years of his life, he sometimes amused himself, at a leisure
hour, in supporting his theoretical conclusions on these subjects, by
the facts which his subsequent studies and observations had sug∣gested;
and he intended, if he had lived, to have prepared the re∣sult
of these labours for the press. Of this work he has left for
publication a short fragment; but he had not proceeded far enough
to apply his doctrine to versisication and to the theatre. As his no∣tions,
however, with respect to these were a favourite topic of his
conversation, and were intimately connected with his general princi∣ples
of criticism, it would have been improper to pass them over in
this sketch of his life; and I even thought it proper to detail them
at greater length than the comparative importance of the subject
would have justified, if he had carried his plans into execution.
Whether his love of system, added to his partiality for the French
drama, may not have led him, in this instance, to generalize a little
too much his conclusions, and to overlook some peculiarities in the
language and versification of that country, I shall not take upon me
to determine.</P>
<P>In October 1766, the Duke of BUCCLEUGH returned to London.
His Grace, to whom I am indebted for several particulars in the
<PB N="lx" REF="59"/>
foregoing narrative, will, I hope, forgive the liberty I take in tran∣scribing
one paragraph in his own words: “In October 1766, we
returned to London, after having spent near three years together,
without the slightest disagreement or coolness;—on my part, with
every advantage that could be expected from the society of such
a man. We continued to live in friendship till the hour of his
death; and I shall always remain with the impression of having
lost a friend whom I loved and respected, not only for his great
talents, but for every private virtue.”</P>
<P>The retirement in which Mr. SMITH passed his next ten years,
formed a striking contrast to the unsettled mode of life he had been
for some time accustomed to, but was so congenial to his natural
disposition, and to his firsst habits, that it was with the utmost diffi∣culty
he was ever persuaded to leave it. During the whole of this
period, (with the exception of a few visits to Edinburgh and Lon∣don,)
he remained with his mother at Kirkaldy; occupied habitually
in intense sludy, but unbending his mind at times in the company
of some of his old school-fellows, whose “sober wishes” had at∣tached
them to the place of their birth. In the society of such men,
Mr. SMITH delighted; and to them he was endeared, not only by
his simple and unassuming manners, but by the perfect knowledge
they all possessed of those domestic virtues which had distinguished
him from his infancy.</P>
<P>Mr. HUME, who (as he tells us himself) considered “a town as
the true scene for a man of letters,” made many attempts to se∣duce
him from his retirement. In a letter, dated in 1772, he urges
him to pass some time with him in Edinburgh. “I shall not take
any excuse from your state of health, which I suppose only a
subterfuge invented by indolence and love of solitude. Indeed,
my dear SMITH, if you continue to hearken to complaints of this
<PB N="lxi" REF="60"/>
nature, you will cut yourself out entirely from human society, to the
great loss of both parties.” In another letter, dated in 1769,
from his house in James's Court, (which commanded a prospect of
the frith of Forth, and of the opposite coast of Fife,) “I am glad
(says he) to have come within sight of you; but as I would also be
within speaking terms of you, I wish we could concert measures
for that purpose. I am mortally sick at sea, and regard with
horror and a kind of hydrophobia the great gulph that lies be∣tween
us. I am also tired of travelling, as much as you ought
naturally to be of staying at home. I therefore propose to you
to come hither, and pass some days with me in this solitude. I
want to know what you have been doing, and propose to exact a
rigorous account of the method in which you have employed
yourself during your retreat. I am positive you are in the wrong
in many of your speculations, especially where you have the mis∣fortune
to differ from me. All these are reasons for our meeting,
and I wish you would make me some reasonable proposal for that
purpose. There is no habitation in the island of Inchkeith, other∣wise
I should challenge you to meet me on that spot, and neither
of us ever to leave the place, till we were fully agreed on all points
of controversy. I expect General CONWAY here to-morrow,
whom I shall attend to Roseneath, and I shall remain there a few
days. On my return, I hope to find a letter from you, contain∣ing
a bold acceptance of this defiance.”</P>
<P>At length (in the beginning of the year 1776) Mr. SMITH ac∣counted
to the world for his long retreat, by the publication of his
“Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.”
A letter of congratulation on this event, from Mr. HUME, is now
before me. It is dated I st April 1776, (about six months before
Mr. HUME'S death,) and discovers an amiable solicitude about his
<PB N="lxii" REF="61"/>
friend's literary fame. “<HI>Euge! Belle!</HI> Dear Mr. SMITH: I am much
pleased with your performance, and the perusal of it has taken
me from a state of great anxiety. It was a work of so much
expectation, by yourself, by your friends, and by the public,
that I trembled for its appearance; but am now much relieved.
Not but that the reading of it necessarily requires so much attention,
and the public is disposed to give so little, that I shall still doubt
for some time of its being at first very popular. But it has depth
and solidity and acuteness, and is so much illstrated by curious
facts, that it must at last take the public attention. It is probably
much improved by your lsst abode in London. If you were here
at my fire-side, I should dispute some of your principles......
............ But these, and a hundred other points,
are sit only to be discussed in conversation. I hope it will be soon;
for I am in a very bad state of health, and cannot assord a long
delay.”</P>
<P>Of a book which is now so universally known as “The Wealth
of Nations,” it might be considered perhaps as supersluous to
give a particular analysis; and at any rate, the limits of this essay
make it impossible for me to attempt it at present. A few remarks,
however, on the object and tendency of the work, may, I hope, be
introduced without impropriety. The history of a Philosopher's life
can contain little more than the history of his speculations; and in
the case of such an author as Mr. SMITH, whose studies were syste∣matically
directed from his youth to subjects of the last importance
to human happiness, a review of his writings, while it serves to illus∣trate
the peculiarities of his genius, affords the most faithful picture
of his character as a man.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of The Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
Nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The length to which this Memoir has already extended, together with some other reasons which it is unnecessary to mention here, have induced me, in printing the following section, to confine myself to a much more general view of the subject than I once intended.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>AN historical review of the different forms under which human
affairs have appeared in different ages and nations, naturally
suggests the question, Whether the experience of former times may
not now furnish some general principles to enlighten and direct the
policy of future legislators? The discussion, however, to which
this question leads is of singular difficulty; as it requires an accu∣rate
analysis of by far the most complicated class of phaenomena
that can possibly engage our attention, those which result from
the intricate and often the imperceptible mechanism of political so∣ciety;—a
subject of observation which seems, at first view, so
little commensurate to our faculties, that it has been generally re∣garded
with the same passive emotions of wonder and submission,
with which, in the material world, we survey the effects produced,
by the mysterious and uncontroulable operation of physical causes.
It is fortunate that upon this, as on many other occasions, the diffi∣culties
which had long baffled the efforts of solitary genius begin
to appear less formidable to the united exertions of the race; and
that in proportion as the experience and the reasonings of different
individuals are brought to bear upon the same objects, and are com∣bined
in such a manner as to illustrate and to limit each other, the
<PB N="lxiv" REF="63"/>
science of politics assumes more and more that systematical form
which encourages and aids the labours of future enquirers.</P>
<P>In prosecuting the science of politics on this plan, little assistance is
to be derived from the speculations of ancient philosophers, the
greater part of whom, in their political enquiries, consined their
attention to a comparison of different forms of government, and to
an examination of the provisions they made for perpetuating their
own existence, and for extending the glory of the state. It was
reserved for modern times to investigate those universal principles of
justice and of expediency, which ought, under every form of go∣vernment,
to regulate the social order; and of which the object is,
to make as equitable a distribution as possible, among all the different
members of a community, of the advantages arising from the political
union.</P>
<P>The invention of printing was perhaps necessary to prepare the way
for these researches. In those departments of literature and of
science, where genius finds within itself the materials of its labours; in
poetry, in pure geometry, and in some branches of moral philosophy;
the ancients have not only laid the foundations on which we are to
build, but have left great and finished models for our imitation.
But in physics, where our progress depends on an immense collec∣tion
of facts, and on a combination of the accidental lights daily
struck out in the innumerable walks of observation and experiment;
and in politics, where the materials of our theories are equally
scattered, and are collected and arranged with still greater diffi∣culty,
the means of communication afforded by the press have, in the
course of two centuries, accelerated the progress of the human mind,
far beyond what the moft sanguine hopes of our predecessors could
have imagined.</P>
<P><PB N="lxv" REF="64"/>
The progress already made in this science, inconsiderable as it is
in comparison of what may be yet expected, has been sufficient to
shew, that the happiness of mankind depends, not on the share
which the people possesses, directly or indirectly, in the enactment
of laws, but on the equity and expediency of the laws that are enacted.
The share which the people possesses in the government is interesting
chiefly to the small number of men whose object is the attainment of
political importance; but the equity and expediency of the laws are
interesting to every member of the community: and more especially
to those whose personal insignificance leaves them no encouragement,
but what they derive from the general spirit of the government under
which they live.</P>
<P>It is evident, therefore, that the most important branch of politi∣cal
science is that which has for its object to ascertain the philoso∣phical
principles of jurisprudence; or (as Mr. SMITH expresses it)
to ascertain “the general principles which ought to run through and
be the foundation of the laws of all nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the conclusion of his Theory of Moral Sentiments.</NOTE>.” In countries,
where the prejudices of the people are widely at variance with these
principles, the political liberty which the constitution beflows, only
furnishes them with the means of accomplishing their own ruin:
And if it were possible to suppose these principles completely realized
in any system of laws, the people would have little reason to com∣plain,
that they were not immediately instrumental in their enact∣ment.
The only infallible criterion of the excellence of any con∣stitution
is to be found in the detail of its municipal code; and the
value which wise men set on political freedom, arises chiefly from
the facility it is supposed to afford, for the introduction of those le∣gislative
improvements which the general interests of the community
<PB N="xlvi" REF="65"/>
recommend.—I cannot help adding, that the capacity of a people to
exercise political rights with utility to themselves and to their coun∣try,
presupposes a diffusion of knowledge and of good morals,
which can only result from the previous operation of laws favourable
to industry, to order, and to freedom.</P>
<P>Of the truth of these remarks, enlightened politicians seem now to
be in general convinced; for the most celebrated works which have
been produced in the different countries of Europe, during the last
thirty years, by SMITH, QUESNAI, TURGOT, CAMPOMANES, BEC∣CARIA,
and others, have aimed at the improvement of society,—not
by dclineating plans of new constitutions, but by enlightening the
policy of actual legislators. Such speculations, while they are more
essentially and more extensively useful than any others, have no ten∣dency
to unhinge established institutions, or to inslame the passions of
the multitude. The improvements they recommend are to be effected
by means too gradual and slow in their operation, to warm the ima∣ginations
of any but of the speculative few; and in proportion as they
are adopted, they consolidate the political fabric, and enlarge the basis
upon which it rests.</P>
<P>To direct the policy of nations with respect to one most impor∣tant
class of its laws, those which form its system of political oeco∣nomy,
is the great aim of Mr. SMITH's <HI>Inquiry:</HI> And he has un∣questionably
had the merit of presenting to the world, the most com∣prehensive
and perfect work that has yet appeared, on the general
principles of any branch of legislation. The example which he has
set will be followed, it is to be hoped, in due time, by other writers,
for whom the internal policy of states furnishes many other subjects
of discussion no less curious and interesting; and may accelerate the
progress of that science which Lord BACON has so well described in
<PB N="lxvii" REF="66"/>
the following passage: “Finis et scopus quem leges intueri, atque
ad quem jussiones et sanctiones suas dirigere debent, non alius est,
quam ut cives feliciter degant: id fiet, si pietate et religione recte
instituti; moribus honesti; armis adversus hostes externos tuti;
legum auxilio adversus seditiones et privatas injurias muniti; im∣perio
et magistratibus obsequentes; copiis et opibus locupletes et
florentes fuerint.—Certe cognitio ista ad viros civiles proprie
spectat; qui optime nôrunt, quid ferat societas humana, quid salus
populi, quid aequitas naturalis, quid gentium mores, quid rerum∣publicarum
formae diversae: ideoque possint de legibus, ex prin∣cipiis
et praeceptis tam aequitatis naturalis, quam politices decer∣nere.
Quamobrem id nunc agatur, ut fontes justitiae et utilitatis
publicae petantur, et in fingulis juris partibus character quidam
et idea justi exhibeatur, ad quam particularium regnorum et
rerumpublicarum leges probare, atque inde emendationem moliri,
quisque, cui hoc cordi erit et curae, possit.” The enumeration
contained in the foregoing passage, of the different objects of law,
coincides very nearly with that given by Mr. SMITH in the conclu∣sion
of his Theory of Moral Sentiments; and the precise aim of
the political speculations which he then announced, and of which he
afterwards published so valuable a part in his Wealth of Nations,
was to ascertain the general principles of justice and of expediency,
which ought to guide the institutions of legislators on these impor∣tant
articles;—in the words of Lord BACON, to ascertain those <HI>leges
legum,</HI> “ex quibus informatio peti possit, quid in singulis legibus
bene aut perperam positum aut constitutum sit.”</P>
<P>The branch of legislation which Mr. SMITH has made choice of
as the subject of his work, naturally leads me to remark a very
striking contrast between the spirit of ancient and of modern policy
<PB N="lxviii" REF="67"/>
in respect to the Wealth of Nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Science de la Legislation, par le Chev. FILANGIERI, Liv. i. chap. 13.</NOTE>. The great object of the
sormer was to counteract the love of money and a taste for luxury,
by positive institutions; and to maintain in the great body of the
people, habits of frugality, and a severity of manners. The decline
of states is uniformly ascribed by the philosophers and historians,
both of Greece and Rome, to the influence of riches on national
character; and the laws of LYCURGUS, which, during a course of
ages, banished the precious metals from Sparta, are proposed by
many of them as the most perfect model of legislation devised by
human wisdom.—How opposite to this is the doctrine of modern
politicians! Far from considering poverty as an advantage to a state,
their great aim is to open new sources of national opulence, and to
animate the activity of all classes of the people by a taste for the com∣forts
and accommodations of life.</P>
<P>One principal cause of this difference between the spirit of ancient
and of modern policy, may be found in the difference between the
sources of national wealth in ancient and in modern times. In
ages when commerce and manufactures were yet in their infancy,
and among states constituted like most of the ancient republics, a
sudden influx of riches from abroad was justly dreaded as an evil,
alarming to the morals, to the industry, and to the freedom of a
people. So different, however, is the case at present, that the most
wealthy nations are those where the people are the most laborious,
and where they enjoy the greatest degree of liberty. Nay, it was
the general diffusion of wealth among the lower orders of men,
which first gave birth to the spirit of independence in modern
Europe, and which has produced under some of its governments,
<PB N="lxix" REF="68"/>
and especially under our own, a more equal diffusion of freedom and
of happiness than took place under the most celebrated constitutions
of antiquity.</P>
<P>Without this diffusion of wealth among the lower orders, the
important effects resulting from the invention of printing would have
been extremely limited; for a certain degree of case and independ∣ence
is necessary to inspire men with the desire of knowledge, and
to afford them the leisure which is requisite for acquiring it; and it
is only by the rewards which such a state of society holds up to in∣dustry
and ambition, that the selfish passions of the multitude can be
interested in the intellectual improvement of their children. The
extensive propagation of light and resinement arising from the influ∣ence
of the press, aided by the spirit of commerce, seems to be the
remedy provided by nature, against the fatal effects which would
otherwise be produced, by the subdivision of labour accompanying
the progress of the mechanical arts: Nor is any thing wanting to
make the remedy effectual, but wise institutions to facilitate ge∣neral
instruction, and to adapt the education of individuals to the
stations they are to occupy. The mind of the artist, which, from
the limited sphere of his activity, would sink below the level of the
peasant or the savage, might receive in infancy the means of intel∣lectual
enjoyment, and the seeds of moral improvement; and even
the insipid uniformity of his professional engagements, by present∣ing
no object to awaken his ingenuity or to distract his attention
might leave him at liberty to employ his faculties, on subjects more
interesting to himself, and more extensively useful to others.</P>
<P>These effects, notwithstanding a variety of opposing causes which
still exist, have already resulted, in a very sensible degree, from the
<PB N="lxx" REF="69"/>
liberal policy of modern times. Mr. HUME, in his Essay on Com∣merce,
after taking notice of the numerous armies raised and main∣tained
by the small republics in the ancient world, ascribes the mi∣litary
power of these states to their want of commerce and luxury.
“Few artisans were maintained by the labour of the farmers, and
therefore more soldiers might live upon it.” He adds, however,
that “the policy of ancient times was VIOLENT, and contrary to the
NATURAL course of things;”—by which, I presume, he means,
that it aimed too much at modifying, by the force of positive insti∣tutions,
the order of society, according to some preconceived idea of
expediency; without trusting sufficiently to those principles of the
human constitution, which, wherever they are allowed free scope,
not only conduct mankind to happiness, but lay the foundation of
a progressive improvement in their condition and in their character.
The advantages which modern policy possesses over the ancient, arise
principally from its conformity, in some of the most important ar∣ticles
of political ceconomy, to an order of things recommended by
nature; and it would not be difficult to shew, that where it re∣mains
imperfect, its errors may be traced to the restraints it imposes
on the natural course of human affairs. Indeed, in these restraints
may be discovered the latent seeds of many of the prejudices and
follies which infect modern manners, and which have so long bid
defiance to the reasonings of the philosopher and the ridicule of the
satirist.</P>
<P>The foregoing very imperfect hints appeared to me to form, not
only a proper, but in some measure a necessary introduction to the
few remarks I have to offer on Mr. SMITH's Inquiry; as they tend
to illustrate a connection between his system of commercial politics,
and those speculations of his earlier years, in which he aimed more
<PB N="lxxi" REF="70"/>
professedly at the advancement of human improvement and hap∣piness.
It is this view of political oeconomy that can alone render
it interesting to the moralist, and can dignify calculations of profit
and loss in the eye of the philosopher. Mr. SMITH has alluded to
it in various passages of his work, but he has no where explained
himself fully on the subject; and the great stress he has laid on
the effects of the division of labour in increasing its productive
powers seems, at first sight, to point to a different and very melan∣choly
conclusion;—that the same causes which promote the progress
of the arts, tend to degrade the mind of the artist; and, of conse∣quence,
that the growth of national wealth implies a sacrisice of the
character of the people.</P>
<P>The fundamental doctrines of Mr. SMITH's system are now so
generally known, that it would have been tedious to offer any reca∣pitulation
of them in this place; even if I could have hoped to do
justice to the subject, within the limits which I have prescribed to
myself at present. A distinct analysis of his work might indeed be
useful to many readers; but it would itself form a volume of consi∣derable
magnitude. I may perhaps, at some future period, present
to the Society, an attempt towards such an analysis, which I began
long ago, for my own satisfaction, and which I lately made consi∣derable
progress in preparing for the press, before I was aware of the
impossibility of connecting it, with the general plan of this paper. In
the mean time, I shall content myself with remarking, that the great
and leading object of Mr. SMITH's speculations is to illustrate the pro∣vision
made by nature in the principles of the human mind, and in
the circumstances of man's external situation, for a gradual and pro∣gressive
augmentation in the means of national wealth; and to de∣monstrate,
that the most effectual plan for advancing a people to
<PB N="lxxii" REF="71"/>
greatness, is to maintain that order of things which nature has point∣ed
out; by allowing every man, as long as he observes the rules of
justice, to pursue his own interest in his own way, and to bring both
his industry and his capital into the freest competition with those
of his fellow-citizens. Every system of policy which endeavours,
either by extraordinary encouragements, to draw towards a particu∣lar
species of industry a greater share of the capital of the society
than what would naturally go to it; or, by extraordinary restraints,
to force from a particular species of industry some share of the capital
which would otherwise be employed in it, is, in reality, subversive
of the great purpose which it means to promote.</P>
<P>What the circumstances are, which, in modern Europe, have
contributed to disturb this order of nature, and, in particular, to en∣courage
the industry of towns, at the expence of that of the coun∣try,
Mr. SMITH has investigated with great ingenuity; and in such
a manner, as to throw much new light on the history of that state of
society which prevails in this quarter of the globe. His observations
on this subject tend to shew, that these circumstances were, in their
first origin, the natural and the unavoidable result of the peculiar
situation of mankind during a certain period; and that they took
their rise, not from any general scheme of policy, but from the pri∣vate
interests and prejudices of particular orders of men.</P>
<P>The state of society, however, which at first arose from a singular
combination of accidents, has been prolonged much beyond its natu∣ral
period, by a false system of political ceconomy, propagated by
merchants and manufacturers; a class of individuals, whose interest
is not always the same with that of the public, and whose professional
knowledge gave them many advantages, more particularly in the
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="72"/>
infancy of this branch of science, in defending those opinions which
they wished to encourage. By means of this system, a new set of
obstacles to the progress of national prosperity has been created.
Those which arose from the disorders of the feudal ages, tended direct∣ly
to disturb the internal arrangements of society, by obstructing the
free circulation of labour and of stock, from employment to employ∣ment,
and from place to place. The false system of political oeco∣nomy
which has been hitherto prevalent, as its professed object has
been to regulate the commercial intercourse between different nations,
has produced its effect in a way less direct and less manifest, but
equally prejudicial to the states that have adopted it.</P>
<P>On this system, as it took its rise from the prejudices, or rather
from the interested views of mercantile speculators, Mr. SMITH
bestows the title of the Commercial or Mercantile System; and he
has considered at great length its two principal expedients for enrich∣ing
a nation; reftraints upon importation, and encouragements to
exportation. Part of these expedients, he observes, have been dic∣tated
by the spirit of monopoly, and part by a spirit of jealousy
against those countries with which the balance of trade is supposed
to be disadvantageous. All of them appear clearly, from his reason∣ings,
to have a tendency unfavourable to the wealth of the nation
which imposes them.—His remarks with respect to the jealousy of
commerce are expressed in a tone of indignation, which he seldom
assumes in his political writings.</P>
<P>“In this manner (says he) the sneaking arts of underling trades∣men
are erected into political maxims for the conduct of a great
empire. By such maxims as these, nations have been taught that
their interest consisted in beggaring all their neighbours. Each
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="73"/>
nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon the
prosperity of all the nations with which it trades, and to consider
their gain as its own loss. Commerce, which ought naturally to be
among nations as among individuals, a bond of union and friend∣ship,
has become the most fertile source of discord and animosity.
The capricious ambition of Kings and Ministers has not, during
the present and the preceding century, been more fatal to the re∣pose
of Europe, than the impertinent jealousy of merchants and
manufacturers. The violence and injustice of the rulers of man∣kind
is an ancient evil, for which perhaps the nature of human
affairs can scarce admit of a remedy. But the mean rapacity, the
monopolizing spirit of merchants and manufacturers, who neither
are nor ought to be the rulers of mankind, though it cannot per∣haps
be corrected, may very easily be prevented from disturbing
the tranquillity of any body but themselves.”</P>
<P>Such are the liberal principles which, according to Mr. SMITH,
ought to direct the commercial policy of nations; and of which it
ought to be the great object of legislators to facilitate the establish∣ment.
In what manner the execution of the theory should be con∣ducted
in particular instances, is a question of a very different na∣ture,
and to which the answer must vary, in different countries, ac∣cording
to the different circumstances of the case. In a speculative
work, such as Mr. SMITH's, the consideration of this question did
not fall properly under his general plan; but that he was abundantly
aware of the danger to be apprehended from a rash application of po∣litical
theories, appears not only from the general strain of his writ∣ings,
but from some incidental observations which he has expressly
made upon the subject. “So unfortunate (says he, in one passage)
are the effects of all the regulations of the mercantile system, that
<PB N="lxxv" REF="74"/>
they not only introduce very dangerous disorders into the state of
the body politic, but disorders which it is often difficult to reme∣dy,
without occasioning, for a time at least, still greater disor∣ders.—In
what manner, therefore, the natural system of perfect
liberty and justice ought gradually to be restored, we must leave to
the wisdom of future statesmen and legislators to determine.” In
the laft edition of his Theory of Moral Sentiments, he has intro∣duced
some remarks, which have an obvious reference to the same
important doctrine. The following passage seems to refer more par∣ticularly
to those derangements of the social order which derived
their origin from the feudal institutions:</P>
<P>“The man whose public spirit is prompted altogether by huma∣nity
and benevolence, will respect the establised powers and pri∣vileges
even of individuals, and still more of the great orders and
societies into which the state is divided. Though he should con∣sider
some of them as in some measure abusive, he will content
himself with moderating, what he often cannot annihilate with∣out
great violence. When he cannot conquer the rooted preju∣dices
of the people by reason and persuasion, he will not attempt
to subdue them by force; but will religioufly observe what, by
CICERO, is justly called the divine maxim of PLATO, never to
use violence to his country no more than to his parents. He will
accommodate, as well as he can, his public arrangements to the
confirmed habits and prejudices of the people; and will remedy,
as well as he can, the inconveniencies which may flow from the
want of those regulations which the people are averse to submit to.
When he cannot establish the right, he will not disdain t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ame∣liorate
the wrong; but like SOLON, when he cannot establish
<PB N="lxxvi" REF="75"/>
the best system of laws, he will endeavour to establish the best
that the people can bear.”</P>
<P>These cautions with respect to the practical application of general
principles were peculiarly necessary from the Author of “The
Wealth of Nations;” as the unlimited freedom of trade, which it
is the chief aim of his work to recommend, is extremely apt, by
flattering the indolence of the statesman, to suggest to those who
are invested with absolute power, the idea of carrying it into im∣mediate
execution. “Nothing is more adverse to the tranquillity of
a statesman (says the author of an Eloge on the Administration of
COLBERT) than a spirit of moderation; because it condemns him
to perpetual observation, shews him every moment the insuffici∣ency
of his wisdom, and leaves him the melancholy sense of his
own imperfection; while, under the shelter of a few general prin∣ciples,
a systematical politician enjoys a perpetual calm. By the
help of one alone, that of a perfect liberty of trade, he would
govern the world, and would leave human affairs to arrange them∣slves
at pleasure, under the operation of the prejudices and the
self-interest of individuals. If these run counter to each other, he
gives himself no anxiety about the consequence; he insists that
the result cannot be judged of till after a century or two shall have
elapsed. If his contemporaries, in consequence of the disorder
into which he has thrown public affairs, are scrupulous about sub∣mitting
quietly to the experiment, he accuses them of impatience.
They alone, and not he, are to blame for what they have suffered;
and the principle continues to be inculcated with the same zeal and
the same confidence as before.” These are the words of the in∣genious
and eloquent author of the Eloge on GOLBERT, which ob∣tained
<PB N="lxxvii" REF="76"/>
the prize from the French Academy in the year 1763; a per∣formance
which, although confined and erroneous in its speculative
views, abounds with just and important reflections of a practical
nature. How far his remarks apply to that particular class of poli∣ticians
whom he had evidently in his eye in the foregoing passage, I
shall not presume to decide.</P>
<P>It is hardly necessary for me to add to these observations, that they
do not detract in the least from the value of those political theo∣ries
which attempt to delineate the principles of a perfect legislation.
Such theories (as I have elsewhere observed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, p. 261.</NOTE>) ought to be considered
merely as descriptions of the <HI>ultimate</HI> objects at which the statesman
ought to aim. The tranquillity of his administration, and the imme∣diate
success of his measures, depend on his good sense and his prac∣tical
skill; and his theoretical principles only enable him to direct
his measures steadily and wisely, to promote the improvement and
happiness of mankind, and prevent him from being ever led astray
from these important ends, by more limited views of tempo∣rary
expedience. “In all cases (says Mr. HUME) it must be ad∣vantageous
to know what is most perfect in the kind, that we may
be able to bring any real constitution or form of government as
near it as possible, by such gentle alterations and innovations as
may not give too great disturbance to society.”</P>
<P>The limits of this Memoir make it impossible for me to examine
particularly the merit of Mr. SMITH's work in point of originality.
That his doctrine concerning the freedom of trade and of industry
coincides remarkably with that which we find in the writings of the
French Oeconomists, appears from the slight view of their system
<PB N="lxxviii" REF="77"/>
which he himself has given. But it surely cannot be pretended by
the warmest admirers of that system, that any one of its numerous
expositors has approached to Mr. SMITH in the precision and perspi∣cuity
with which he has stated it, or in the scientisic and luminous
manner in which he has deduced it from elementary principles. The
awkwardness of their technical language, and the paradoxical form
in which they have chosen to present some of their opinions, are ac∣knowledged
even by those who are most willing to do justice to their
merits; whereas it may be doubted with respect to Mr. SMITH's
Inquiry, if there exists any book beyond the circle of the mathema∣tical
and physical sciences, which is at once so agreeable in its ar∣rangement
to the rules of a sound logic, and so accessible to the ex∣amination
of ordinary readers. Abstracting entirely from the au∣thor's
peculiar and original speculations, I do not know, that upon
any subject whatever, a work has been produced in our times, con∣taining
so methodical, so comprehensive, and so judicious a digest of
all the most profound and enlightened philosophy of the age.</P>
<P>In justice also to Mr. SMITH, it must be observed, that although
some of the oeconomical writers had the start of him in publishing
their doctrines to the world, these doctrines appear, with respect to
him, to have been altogether original, and the result of his own re∣flections.
Of this, I think, every person must be convinced, who
reads the Inquiry with due attention, and is at pains to examine the
gradual and beautiful progress of the author's ideas: But in case any
doubt should remain on this head, it may be proper to mention, that
Mr. SMITH's political lectures, comprehending the fundamental
principles of his Inquiry, were delivered at Glasgow as early as the
year 1752 or 1753; at a period, surely, when there existed no
French performance on the subject, that could be of much use to
<PB N="lxxix" REF="78"/>
him in guiding his researches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In proof of this, it is sufficient for me to appeal to a short history of the progress of political oeconomy in France, published in one of the volumes of <HI>Ephemerides du Citoyen.</HI> See the first part of the volume for the year 1769. The paper is entitled, <HI>Notice abrégée des différens Ecrits modernes, qui ont concouru en France à former la science de Péconomie politique.</HI></NOTE>. In the year 1756, indeed, M.
TURGOT (who is said to have imbibed his first notions concerning
the unlimited freedom of commerce from an old merchant, M.
GOURNAY) published in the <HI>Encyclopedie,</HI> an article which sufficiently
shews how completely his mind was emancipated from the old pre∣judices
in favour of commercial regulations: But that even then,
these opinions were confined to a few speculative men in France,
appears from a passage in the <HI>Mémoires sur la Vie et les Ouvrages de</HI>
M. TURGOT; in which, after a short quotation from the article just
mentioned, the author adds: “These ideas were <HI>then</HI> considered as
paradoxical; they are since become common, and they will one
day be adopted universally.”</P>
<P>The Political Discourses of Mr. HUME were evidently of greater
use to Mr. SMITH, than any other book that had appeared prior to
his lectures. Even Mr. HUME's theories, however, though always
plausible and ingenious, and in most instances profound and just, in∣volve
some fundamental mistakes; and, when compared with Mr.
SMITH's, afford a striking proof, that, in considering a subject so
extensive and so complicated, the most penetrating sagacity, if di∣rected
only to particular questions, is apt to be led astray by first
appearances; and that nothing can guard us effectually against error,
but a comprehensive survey of the whole field of discussion, assisted
by an accurate and patient analysis of the ideas about which our
reasonings are employed.—It may be worth while to add, that Mr.
HUME'S Essay “on the Jealousy of Trade,” with some other of his
Political Discourses, received a very flattering proof of M. TURGOT's
<PB N="lxxx" REF="79"/>
approbation, by his undertaking the task of translating them into the
French language.</P>
<P>I am aware that the evidence I have hitherto produced of
Mr. SMITH's originality may be objected to as not perfectly de∣cisive,
as it rests entirely on the recollection of those students who
attended his first courses of moral philosophy at Glassgow; a recol∣lection
which, at the distance of forty years, cannot be supposed to
be very accurate. There exists, however fortunately, a short manu∣script
drawn up by Mr. SMITH in the year 1755, and presented by
him to a society of which he was then a member; in which paper, a
pretty long enumeration is given of certain leading principles, both
political and literary, to which he was anxious to establish his ex∣clusive
right; in order to prevent the possibility of some rival claims
which he thought he had reason to apprehend, and to which his
situation as a Professor, added to his unreserved communications in
private companies, rendered him peculiarly liable. This paper is at
present in my possession. It is expressed with a good deal of that honest and indignant warmth, which is perhaps unavoidable by a
man who is conscious of the purity of his own intentions, when h
suspects that advantages have been taken of the frankness of his
temper. On such occasions, due allowances are not always made for
those plagiarisms which, however cruel in their effects, do not ne∣cessarily
imply bad faith in those who are guilty of them; for the
bulk of mankind, incapable themselves of original thought, are per∣fectly
unable to form a conception of the nature of the injury done
to a man of inventive genius, by encroaching on a favourite specu∣lation.
For reasons known to some members of this Society, it
would be improper, by the publication of this manuscript, to revive
the memory of private differences; and I should not have even al∣luded
<PB N="lxxxi" REF="80"/>
to it, if I did not think it a valuable document of the progress
of Mr. SMITH's political ideas at a very early period. Many of the
most important opinions in <HI>The Wealth of Nations</HI> are there detailed;
but I shall quote only the following sentences: “Man is generally
considered by statesmen and projectors as the materials of a sort of
political mechanics. Projectors disturb nature in the course of
her operations in human affairs; and it requires no more than to
let her alone, and give her fair play in the pursuit of her ends,
that she may establish her own designs.”—“And in another passage:
Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opu∣lence
from the loweft barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a to∣lerable
adminitration of justice; all the rest being brought about
by the natural course of things. All governments which thwart
this natural course, which force things into another channel, or
which endeavour to arrest the progress of society at a particular
point, are unnatural, and to support themselves are obliged to be
oppressive and tyrannical.—A great part of the opinions (he ob
serves) enumerated in this paper is treated of at length in some
lectures which I have still by me, and which were written in the
hand of a clerk who left my service six years ago. They have all
of them been the constant subjects of my lectures since I first
taught Mr. CRAIGIE's class, the first winter I spent in Glasgow,
down to this day, without any considerable variation. They had
all of them been the subjects of lectures which I read at Edin∣burgh
the winter before I left it, and I can adduce innumerable
witnesses, both from that place and from this, who will ascertain
them sufficiently to be mine.”</P>
<P>After all, perhaps the merit of such a work as Mr. SMITH's is to be
estimated less from the novelty of the principles it contains, than from
<PB N="lxxxii" REF="81"/>
the reasnings employed to support these principles, and from the sci∣entific
manner in which they are unfolded in their proper order and
connection. General assertions with respect to the advantages of a
free commerce, may be collected from various writers of an early
date. But in questions of so complicated a nature as occur in poli∣tical
oeconomy, the credit of such opinions belongs of right to the
author who first established their solidity, and followed them out to
their remote consequences; not to him who, by a fortunate accident,
first stumbled on the truth.</P>
<P>Besides the principles which Mr. SMITH considered as more pecu∣liarly
his own, his Inquiry exhibits a systematical view of the most
important articles of political oeconomy, so as to serve the purpose
of an elementary treatise on that very extensive and difficult science.
The skill and the comprehensiveness of mind displayed in his ar∣rangement,
can be judged of by those alone who have compared it
with that adopted by his immediate predecessors. And perhaps, in
point of utility, the labour he has employed in connecting and me∣thodising
their scattered ideas, is not less valuable than the results of
his own original speculations: For it is only when digested in
a clear and natural order, that truths make their proper impres∣sion
on the mind, and that erroneous opinions can be combated with
success.</P>
<P>It does not belong to my present undertaking (even if I were
qualified for such a task) to attempt the separation of the solid and
important doctrines of Mr. SMITH's book from those opinions
which appear exceptionable or doubtful. I acknowledge, that there
are some of his conclusions to which I would not be understood to
subscribe implicitly; more particularly in that chapter, where he
treats of the principles of taxation, and which is certainly executed
<PB N="lxxxiii" REF="82"/>
in a manner more loose and unsatisfatory than the other parts of his
system.</P>
<P>It would be improper for me to conclude this sction without tak∣ing
notice of the manly and dignified freedom with which the au∣thor
uniformly delivers his opinions, and of the superiority which
he discovers throughout, to all the little passions connected with the
factions of the times in which he wrote. Whoever takes the trouble
to compare the general tone of his composition with the period of
its first publication, cannot fail to feel and acknowledge the force of
this remark.—It is not often that a disinterested zeal for truth has
so soon met with its just reward. Philosophers (to use an expression
of Lord BACON's) are “the servants of posterity;” and most of
those who have devoted their talents to the best interests of man∣kind,
have been obliged, like BACON, to “bequeath their fame”
to a race yet unborn, and to console themselves with the idea of
sowing what another generation was to reap:
<Q>Insere Daphni pyros, carpent tua poma nepotes.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. SMITH was more fortunate; or rather, in this respect, his for∣tune
was singular. He survived the publication of his work only
fifteen years; and yet, during that short period, he had not only the
satisfaction of seeing the opposition it at first excited, gradually sub∣side,
but to witness the practical influence of his writings on the
commercial policy of his country.</P>

<P>ABOUT two years after the publication of “The Wealth of Nat∣ions,”
Mr. SMITH was appointed one of the Commissioners
of his Majesty's Customs in Scotland; a preferment which, in his
estimation, derived an additional value from its being bestowed on
him at the request of the Duke of BUCCLEUGH. The greater part
of these two years he passed at London, in a fociety too extensive
and varied to afford him any opportunity of indulging his taste for
study. His time, however, was not lost to himself; for much of
it was spent with some of the first names in English literature. Of
these no unfavourable specimen is preserved by Dr. BARNARD, in
his well known “Verses addressed to Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS
and his friends.”</P>

<L>SMITH how to think, BURKE how to speak,</L>
<L>And BEAUCLERC to converse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Annual Register for the year 1776.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>In consequence of Mr. SMITH's appointment to the Board of
Customs, he removed, in 1778, to Edinburgh, where he spent the
<PB N="lxxxv" REF="84"/>
last twelve years of his life; enjoying an assluence which was more
than equal to all his wants; and, what was to him of still greater
value, the prospect of passing the remainder of his days among the
companions of his youth.</P>
<P>His mother, who, though now in extreme old age, still possessed
a considerable degree of health, and retained all her faculties unim∣paired,
accompanied him to town; and his cousin Miss JANE
DOUGLAS, (who had formerly been a member of his family at
Glasgow, and for whom he had always felt the affection of a bro∣ther,)
while she divided with him those tender attentions which he
aunt's infirmities required, relieved him of a charge for which he
was peculiarly ill qualified, by her friendly superintendance of his
domestic oeconomy.</P>
<P>The accession to his income which his new office brought him,
enabled him to gratify, to a much greater extent than his former
circumstances admitted of, the natural generosity of his disposition;
and the state of his funds at the time of his death, compared with
his very moderate establishment, confirmed, beyond a doubt,
what his intimate acquaintances had often suspected, that a large
proportion of his annual savings was allotted to offices of secret
charity. A small, but excellent library, which he had gradually
formed with great judgment in the selection; and a simple, though
hospitable table, where, without the formality of an invitation, he
was always happy to receive his friends, were the only expences that
could be considered as his own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some very affecting instances of Mr. SMITH's beneficence, in cases where he found it impossible to conceal entirely his good offices, have been mentioned to me by a near relation of his, and one of his most confidential friends, Miss Ross, daugh∣ter of the late PATRICK Ross, Esq. of Innernethy. They were all on a scale much beyond what might have been expected from his fortune; and were accompanied with circumstances equally honourable to the delicacy of his feelings and the liberality of his heart.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxxvi" REF="85"/>
The change in his habits which his removal to Edinburgh pro∣duced,
was not equally favourable to his literary pursuits. The
duties of his office, though they required but little exertion of
thought, were yet sufficient to waste his spirits and to dissipate his
attention; and now that his career is closed, it is impossible to reflect
on the time they consumed, without lamenting, that it had not been
employed in labours more prositable to the world, and more equal to
his mind.</P>
<P>During the first years of his residence in this city, his studies
seemed to be entirely suspended; and his passion for letters served
only to amuse his leisure, and to animate his conversation. The in∣firmities
of age, of which he very early began to feel the approaches,
reminded him at last, when it was too late, of what he yet owed
to the public, and to his own same. The principal materials of the
works which he had announced, had been long ago collected; and
little probably was wanting, but a few years of health and retire∣ment,
to bestow on them that systematical arrangement in which he
delighted; and the ornaments of that flowing, and apparently artless
style, which he had studiously cultivated, but which, after all his
experience in composition, he adjusted, with extreme difficulty, to
his own taste<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. SMITH observed to me, not long before his death, that alter all his practice in writing, he composed as slowly, and with as great difficulty, as at first. He added, at the same time, that Mr. HUME had acquired so great a facility in this respect, that the last volumes of his History were printed from his original copy, with a few marginal corrections.</P>
<P>It may gratify the curiosity of some readers to know, that when Mr. SMITH was employed in composition, he generally walked up and down his apartment, dictating to a fecretary. All Mr. HUME's works (I have been assured) were written with his own hand. A critical reader may, I think, perceive in the different styles of these two claffical writers, the effects of their different modes of study.</P></NOTE>.</P>

The death of his mother in 1784, which was followed by that of
Miss DOUGLAS in 1788, contributed, it is probable, to frustrate these
projects. They had been the objects of his affection for more than
sixty years; and in their society he had enjoyed, from his infancy,
all that he ever knew of the endearments of a family. He was now
alone, and helpless; and, though he bore his loss with equanimity,
and regained apparently his former cheerfulness, yet his health and
strength gradually declined till the period of his death, which hap∣pened
in July 1790, about two years after that of his cousin, and
six after that of his mother. His last illness, which arose from a
chronic obstruction in his bowels, was lingering and painful; but
had every consolation to sooth it which he could derive from the
tenderest sympathy of his friends, and from the complete resigna∣tion
of his own mind.</P>
<P>A few days before his death, finding his end approach rapidly, he gave orders to destroy all his manuscripts, excepting some detached
essays, which he entrusted to the care of his executors; and they
were accordingly committed to the slames. What were the parti∣cular
contents of these papers, is not known even to his most inti∣mate
friends; but there can be no doubt that they consisted, in part,
of the lectures on rhetoric, which he read at Edinburgh in the year
1748, and of the lectures on natural religion and on jurisprudence,
which formed part of his course at Glasgow. That this irreparable
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="87"/>
injury to letters proceeded, in some degree, from an excessive solici∣tude
in the author about his posthumous reputation, may perhaps
be true; but with respect to some of his manuscripts, may we not
suppose, that he was influenced by higher motives? It is but feldom
that a philosopher, who has been occupied from his youth with
moral or with political enquiries, succeeds completely to his wish in
stating to others, the grounds upon which his own opinions are
founded; and hence it is, that the known principles of an indivi∣dual,
who has approved to the public his candour, his liberality,
and his judgment, are entitled to a weight and an authority, inde∣pendent
of the evidence which he is able, upon any particular occa∣sion,
to produce in their support. A fecret consciousness of this
circumstance, and an apprehension, that by not doing justice to an
important argument, the progress of truth may be rather retarded
than advanced, have probably induced many authors to with-hold
from the world the unfinished results of their most valuable labours;
and to content themselves with giving the general sanction of thei
suffrages to truths which they regarded as peculiarly interesting to the
human race<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since writing the above, I have been favoured by Dr. HUTTON with the following particulars.</P>
<P>“Some time before his last illness, when Mr. SMITH had occasion to go to London, he enjoined his friends, to whom he had entrusted the disposal of his munuscripts, that in the event of his death, they should destroy all the volumes of his lectures, doing with the rest of his manuscripts what they pleased. When now he had become weak, and saw the approaching period of his life, he spoke to his friends again upon the same subject. They entreated him to make his mind easy, as he might depend upon their fulfilling his desire. He was then fatissied. But some days afterwards, finding his anxiety not entirely removed, he begged one of them to destroy the volumes immedi∣ately. This accordingly was done; and his mind was so much relieved, that he was able to receive his friends in the evening with his usual complacency.”</P>
<P>“They had been in use to sup with him every Sunday; and that evening there was a pretty numerous meeting of them. Mr. SMITH not finding himself able to sit up with them as usual, retired to bed before supper; and, as he went away, took leave of his friends by saying, `I believe we must adjourn this meeting to some other place.' He died a very few days afterwards.”</P>
<P>Mr. RIDDELL, an intimate friend of Mr. SMITH's, who was present at one of the conversations on the subject of the manuscripts, mentioned to me, in addition to Dr. HUTTON's note, that Mr. SMITH regretted, “he had done so little.” “But I meant (said he) to have done more; and there are materials in my papers, of which I could have made a great deal. But that is now out of the question.”</P>
<P>That the idea of destroying such unsinished works as might be in his possession at the time of his death, was not the effect of any sudden or hasty resolution, appears from the following letter to Mr. HUME, written by Mr. SMITH in 1773, at a time when he was preparing himself for a journey to London, with the prospect of a pretty long absence from Scotland.</P>
<Q>MY DEAR FRIEND, <HI>Edinburgh, 16th April</HI> 1773.</Q>
<P>As I have left the care of all my literary papers to you, I must tell you, that except those which I carry along with me, there are none worth the publication, but a frag∣ment of a great work, which contains a history of the astronomical systems that were successively in fashion down to the time of DES CARTES. Whether that might not be published as a fragment of an intended juvenile work, I leave entirely to your judg∣ment, though I begin to suspect myself that there is more resinement than solidity in some parts of it. This little work you will find in a thin folio paper book in my back room. All the other loose papers which you will find in that desk, or within the glass folding doors of a bureau which stands in my bed-room, together with about eighteen thin paper folio books, which you will likewise find within the same glass folding doors, I desire may be destroyed without any examination. Unless I die very suddenly, I shall take care that the papers I carry with me shall be carefully sent to you.</P>

The additions to the Theory of Moral Sentiments, most of which
were composed under fevere disease, had fortunately been sent to the
press in the beginning of the preceding winter; and the author
lived to see the publication of the work. The moral and ferious
strain that prevails through these additions, when connected with
the circumstance of his declining health, adds a peculiar charm to
his pathetic eloquence, and communicates a new interest, if posssible,
<PB N="xc" REF="89"/>
to those sublime truths, which, in the academical retirement of his
youth, awakened the first ardours of his genius, and on which the
last efforts of his mind reposed.</P>
<P>In a letter addresssed, in the year 1787, to the Principal of the
University of Glasgow, in consequence of being elected Rector
of that learned body, a pleasing memorial remains of the satisfaction
with which he always recollected that period of his literary career,
which had been more peculiarly consecrated to these important stu∣dies.
“No preferment (says he) could have given me so much real
satisfaction. No man can owe greater obligations to a society
than I do to the University of Glasgow. They educated me;
they sent me to Oxford. Soon after my return to Scotland, they
elected me one of their own members; and afterwards preferred me
to another office, to which the abilities and virtues of the never
to be forgotten Dr. HUTCHESON had given a superior degree of
illustration. The period of thirteen years which I spent as a
member of that society, I remember as by far the most useful,
and therefore as by far the happiest and most honourable pe∣riod
of my life; and now, after three and twenty years absence,
to be remembered in so very agreeable a manner by my old
friends and protectors, gives me a heart-felt joy which I can∣not
easily express to you.”</P>
<P>THE short narrative which I have now finished, however barren
of incident, may convey a general idea of the genius and charac∣ter
of this illustrious Man. Of the intellectual gifts and attainments
by which he was so eminently distinguished;—of the originality and
comprehensiveness of his views; the extent, the variety, and the
correctness of his information; the inexhaustible fertility of his in∣vention;
<PB N="xci" REF="90"/>
and the ornaments which his rich and beautiful imagina∣tion
had borrowed from classical culture;—he has left behind him
lasting monuments. To his private worth the most certain of all
testimonies may be found in that confidence, respect, and attach∣ment,
which followed him through all the various relations of life.
The serenity and gaiety he enjoyed, under the pressure of his grow∣ing
infirmities, and the warm interest he felt to the last, in every
thing connected with the welfare of his friends, will be long remem∣bered
by a small circle, with whom, as long as his strength permit∣ted,
he regularly spent an evening in the week; and to whom the
recollection of his worth still forms a pleasing, though melancholy
bond of union.</P>
<P>The more delicate and characteristical features of his mind, it is
perhaps impossible to trace. That there were many peculiarities,
both in his manners, and in his intellectual habits, was manifest to
the most superficial observer; but although, to those who knew
him, these peculiarities detracted nothing from the respect which his
abilities commanded; and although, to his intimate friends, they
added an inexpressible charm to his conversation, while they dis∣played,
in the most interesting light, the artless simplicity of his
heart; yet it would require a very skilful pencil to present them to
the public eye. He was certainly not sitted for the general com∣merce
of the world, or for the business of active life. The com∣prehensive
speculations with which he had been occupied from his
youth, and the variety of materials which his own invention con∣tinually
supplied to his thoughts, rendered him habitually inattentive
to familiar objects, and to common occurrences; and he frequently
exhibited instances of absence, which have scarcely been surpassed
by the fancy of La BRUYERE. Even in company, he was apt to
<PB N="xcii" REF="91"/>
be ingrossed with his studies; and appeared, at times, by the motion
of his lips, as well as by his looks and gestures, to be in the fervour
of composition. I have often, however, been struck, at the dis∣tance
of years, with his accurate memory of the most trifling par∣ticulars;
and am inclined to believe, from this and some other cir∣cumstances,
that he possessed a power, not perhaps uncommon
among absent men, of recollecting, in consequence of subsequent
efforts of reflection, many occurrences which, at the time when
they happened, did not seem to have sensibly attracted his notice.</P>
<P>To the defect now mentioned, it was probably owing, in part,
that he did not fall in easily with the common dialogue of conversa∣tion,
and that he was somewhat apt to convey his own ideas in the
form of a lecture. When he did so, however, it never proceeded
from a wish to ingross the discourse, or to gratify his vanity. His
own inclination disposed him so strongly to enjoy in silence the
gaiety of those around him, that his friends were often led to con∣cert
little schemes, in order to bring him on the subjects most likely
to interest him. Nor do I think I shall be accused of going too far,
when I say, that he was scarcely ever known to start a new topic
himself, or to appear unprepared upon those topics that were intro∣duced
by others. Indeed, his conversation was never more amusing
than when he gave a loose to his genius, upon the very few branches
of knowledge of which he only possessed the outlines.</P>
<P>The opinions he formed of men, upon a slight acquaintance, were
frequently erroneous; but the tendency of his nature inclined him
much more to blind partiality, than to ill-founded prejudice. The
enlarged views of human affairs, on which his mind habitually
dwelt, left him neither time nor inclination to study, in detail,
<PB N="xciii" REF="92"/>
the uninteresting peculiarities of ordinary characters; and accord∣ingly,
though intimately acquainted with the capacities of the intel∣lect,
and the workings of the heart, and accustomed, in his theories,
to mark, with the most delicate hand, the nicest shades, both of ge∣nius
and of the passions; yet, in judging of individuals, it some∣times
happened, that his estimates were, in a surprising degree, wide
of the truth.</P>
<P>The opinions, too, which, in the thoughtlessness and confidence
of his social hours, he was accustomed to hazard on books, and on
questions of speculation, were not uniformly such as might have
been expected from the superiority of his understanding, and the
singular consistency of his philosophical principles. They were
liable to be influenced by accidental circumstances, and by the hu∣mour
of the moment; and when retailed by those who only saw
him occasionally, suggested false and contradictory ideas of his real
sentiments. On these, however, as on most other occasions, there
was always much truth, as well as ingenuity, in his remarks; and
if the different opinions which, at different times, he pronounced
upon the same subject, had been all combined together, so as to
modify and limit each other, they would probably have afforded
materials for a decision, equally comprehensive and just. But, in
the society of his friends, he had no disposition to form those qua∣lified
conclusions that we admire in his writings; and he generally
contented himself with a bold and masterly sketch of the object,
from the first point of view in which his temper, or his fancy, pre∣sented
it. Something of the same kind might be remarked, when
he attempted, in the flow of his spirits, to delineate those characters
which, from long intimacy, he might have been supposed to un∣derstand
thoroughly. The picture was always lively, and expres∣sive;
<PB N="xciv" REF="93"/>
and commonly bore a strong and amusing resemblance to the
original, when viewed under one particular aspect; but seldom,
perhaps, conveyed a just and complete conception of it in all its
dimensions and proportions.—In a word, it was the fault of his un∣premeditated
judgments, to be too systematical, and too much in ex∣tremes.</P>
<P>But,
in whatever way these trifling peculiarities in his manners
may be explained, there can be no doubt, that they were intimately
connected with the genuine artlessness of his mind. In this amiable
quality, he often recalled to his friends, the accounts that are given
of good LA FONTAINE; a quality which in him derived a peculiar
grace from the singularity of its combination with those powers of
reason and of eloquence which, in his political and moral writings,
have long engaged the admiration of Europe.</P>
<P>In his external form and appearance, there was nothing uncom∣mon.
When perfectly at ease, and when warmed with conversation,
his gestures were animated, and not ungraceful; and, in the society
of those he loved, his features were often brightened with a smile of
inexpressible benignity. In the company of strangers, his tendency
to absence, and perhaps still more his consciousness of this tendency,
rendered his manner somewhat embarrassed;—an effect which was
probably not a little heightened by those speculative ideas of pro∣priety,
which his recluse habits tended at once to perfect in his con∣ception,
and to diminish his power of realizing. He never sat for
his picture; but the medallion of TASSIE conveys an exact
idea of his profile, and of the general expression of his counte∣nance.</P>
<P><PB N="xcv" REF="94"/>
The valuable library that he had collected he bequeathed, together
with the rest of his property, to his cousin Mr. DAVID DOUGLAS,
Advocate. In the education of this young gentleman, he had em∣ployed
much of his leisure; and it was only two years before his
death, (at a time when he could ill spare the pleasure of his society,)
that he had sent him to study law at Glasgow, under the care of Mr.
MILLAR;—the strongest proof he could give of his disinterested
zeal for the improvement of his friend, as well as of the esteem in
which he held the abilities of that eminent Professor.</P>
<P>The executors of his will were Dr. BLACK and Dr. HUTTON;
with whom he had long lived in habits of the most intimate and
cordial friendship; and who, to the many other testimonies which
they had given him of their affection, added the mournful office of
witnessing his last moments.</P>

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY
OF
ASTRONOMY.</HEAD>
<P>WONDER, Surprise, and Admiration, are words which, though
often confounded, denote, in our language, sentiments that
are indeed allied, but that are in some respects different also,
and distinct from one another. What is new and singular, excites that
sentiment which, in strict propriety, is called Wonder; what is un∣expected,
Surprise; and what is great or beautiful, Admiration.</P>
<P>We wonder at all extraordinary and uncommon objects, at all the
rarer phaenomena of nature, at meteors, comets, eclipses, at singular
plants and animals, and at every thing, in short, with which we
have before been either little or not at all acquainted; and we still
wonder, though forewarned of what we are to see.</P>
<P>We are surprised at those things which we have seen often, but
which we least of all expected to meet with in the place where we
find them; we are surprised at the sudden appearance of a friend,
whom we have seen a thousand times, but whom we did not imagine
we were to see then.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="97"/>
We admire the beauty of a plain or the greatness of a mountain,
though we have seen both often before, and though nothing appears
to us in either, but what we had expected with certainty to see.</P>
<P>Whether this criticism upon the precise meaning of these words
be just, is of little importance. I imagine it is just, though I ac∣knowledge,
that the best writers in our language have not always
made use of them according to it. Milton, upon the appearance of
Death to Satan, says, that
<Q><L>The Fiend what this might be admir'd;</L>
<L>Admir'd, not fear'd.—</L></Q>
But if this criticism be just, the proper expression should have been
<HI>wonder'd.</HI>—Dryden, upon the discovery of Iphigenia sleeping, says,
that
<Q><L>The fool of nature stood with stupid eyes</L>
<L>And gaping mouth, that testified surprise.</L></Q>
But what Cimon must have felt upon this occasion could not so
much be Surprise, as Wonder and Admiration. All that I contend for
is, that the sentiments excited by what is new, by what is unexpected,
and by what is great and beautiful, are really different, however the
words made use of to express them may sometimes be confounded.
Even the admiration which is excited by beauty, is quite different
(as will appear more fully hereafter) from that which is inspired by
greatness, though we have but one word to denote them.</P>
<P>These sentiments, like all others when inspired by one and the
same object, mutually support and enliven one another: an object
with which we are quite familiar, and which we see every day, pro∣duces,
though both great and beautiful, but a small effect upon us;
because our admiration is not supported either by Wonder or by
Surprise: and if we have heard a very accurate description of a
<PB N="5" REF="98"/>
monster, our Wonder will be the less when we fee it; because our
previous knowledge of it will in a great measure prevent our
Surprise.</P>
<P>It is the design of this Essay to consider particularly the nature and
causes of each of these sentiments, whose influence is of far wider
extent than we should be apt upon a careless view to imagine. I
shall begin with Surprise.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Effect of Unexpectedness or of Surprise.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN an object of any kind, which has been for some time ex∣pected
and foreseen, presents itself, whatever be the emotion
which it is by nature fitted to excite, the mind must have been pre∣pared
for it, and must even in some measure have conceived it be∣fore-hand
; because the idea of the object having been so long pre∣sent
to it, must have before-hand excited some degree of the same
emotion which the object itself would excite: the change, therefore,
which its presence produces comes thus to be less considerable, and
the emotion or passion which it excites glides gradually and easily
into the heart, without violence, pain, or difficulty.</P>
<P>But the contrary of all this happens when the object is unexpected;
the passion is then poured in all at once upon the heart, which is
thrown, if it is a strong passion, into the most violent and convulsive
emotions, such as sometimes cause immediate death; sometimes, by
the suddenness of the extacy, so entirely disjoint the whole frame of
the imagination, that it never after returns to its former tone and
composure, but falls either into a frenzy or habitual lunacy; and
such as almost always occasion a momentary loss of rcason, or of
<PB N="6" REF="99"/>
that attention to other things which our situation or our duty
requires.</P>
<P>How much we dread the effects of the more violent passions,
when they come suddenly upon the mind, appears from those pre∣parations
which all men think necessary when going to inform any
one of what is capable of exciting them. Who would choose all at
once to inform his friend of an extraordinary calamity that had be∣fallen
him, without taking care before-hand, by alarming him with
an uncertain fear, to announce, if one may say so, his misfortune,
and thereby prepare and dispose him for receiving the tidings?</P>
<P>Those panic terrors which sometimes seize armies in the field, or
great cities, when an enemy is in the neighbourhood, and which
deprive for a time the most determined of all deliberate judgments,
are never excited but by the sudden apprehension of unexpected
danger. Such violent consternations, which at once confound whole
multitudes, benumb their understandings, and agitate their hearts,
with all the agony of extravagant fear, can never be produced by
any foreseen danger, how great soever. Fear, though naturally a
very strong passion, never rises to such excesses, unless exasperated
both by Wonder, from the uncertain nature of the danger, and by
Surprise, from the suddenness of the apprehension.</P>
<P>Surprise, therefore, is not to be regarded as an original emotion
of a species distinct from all others. The violent and sudden change
produced upon the mind, when an emotion of any kind is brought
suddenly upon it, constitutes the whole nature of Surprise.</P>
<P>But when not only a passion and a great passion comes all at
once upon the mind, but when it comes upon it while the mind
is in the mood most unfit for conceiving it, the Surprise is then the
<PB N="7" REF="100"/>
greatest. Surprises of joy when the mind is sunk into grief, or of
grief when it is elated with joy, are therefore the most unsupportable.
The change is in this case the greatest possible. Not only a strong
passion is conceived all at once, but a strong passion the direct oppo∣site
of that which was before in possession of the soul. When a load
of sorrow comes down upon the heart that is expanded and elated
with gaiety and joy, it seems not only to damp and oppress it, but
almost to crush and bruise it, as a real weight would crush and bruise
the body. On the contrary, when from an unexpected change
of fortune, a tide of gladness seems, if I may say so, to spring up
all at once within it, when depressed and contracted with grief and
sorrow, it feels as if suddenly extended and heaved up with violent
and irresistible force, and is torn with pangs of all others most
exquisite, and which almost always occasion faintings, deliriums, and
sometimes instant death. For it may be worth while to observe, that
though grief be a more violent passion than joy, as indeed all
uneasy sensations seem naturally more pungent than the opposite
agreeable ones, yet of the two, Surprises of joy are still more insup∣portable
than Surprises of grief. We are told that after the battle of
Thrasimenus, while a Roman lady, who had been informed that her
son was slain in the action, was sitting alone bemoaning her misfor∣fortunes,
the young man who escaped came suddenly into the
room to her, and that she cried out and expired instantly in a
transport of joy. Let us suppose the contrary of this to have
happened, and that in the midst of domestic festivity and mirth, he
had suddenly fallen down dead at her feet, is it likely that the effects
would have been equally violent? I imagine not. The heart springs
to joy with a sort of natural elasticity, it abandons itself to so agreeable
an emotion, as soon as the object is presented; it seems to pant and
leap forward to meet it, and the passion in its full force takes
at once entire and complete possession of the soul. But it is
otherways with grief; the heart recoils from, and resists the first
<PB N="8" REF="101"/>
approaches of that disagreeable passion, and it requires some time
before the melancholy object can produce its full effect. Grief comes
on slowly and gradually, nor ever rises at once to that height of
agony to which it is increased after a little time. But joy comes
rushing upon us all at once like a torrent. The change produced
therefore by a Surprise of joy is more sudden, and upon that account
more violent and apt to have more fatal effects, than that which is
occasioned by a Surprise of grief; there seems too to be something
in the nature of Surprise, which makes it unite more easily with the
brisk and quick motion of joy, than with the slower and heavier
movement of grief. Most men who can take the trouble to recollect,
will find that they have heard of more people who died or became
distracted with sudden joy, than with sudden grief. Yet from the
nature of human affairs, the latter must be much more frequent than
the former. A man may break his leg, or lose his son, though he
has had no warning of either of these events, but he can hardly
meet with an extraordinary piece of good fortune, without having
had some foresight of what was to happen.</P>
<P>Not only grief and joy but all the other passions, are more violent,
when opposite extremes succeed each other. Is any resentment so
keen as what follows the quarrels of lovers, or any love so passionate
as what attends their reconcilement?</P>
<P>Even the objects of the external senses affect us in a more lively
manner, when opposite extremes succeed to, or are placed beside each
other. Moderate warmth seems intolerable heat if felt after ex∣treme
cold. What is bitter will seem more so when tasted after
what is very sweet; a dirty white will seem bright and pure when
placed by a jet black. The vivacity in short of every sensation,
as well as of every sentiment, seems to be greater or less in propor∣tion
to the change made by the impression of either upon the situa∣situation
<PB N="9" REF="102"/>
of the mind or organ; but this change must necessarily be
the greatest when opposite sentiments and sensations are contrasted,
or succeed immediately to one another. Both sentiments and sen∣sations
are then the liveliest; and this superior vivacity proceeds
from nothing but their being brought upon the mind or organ when
in a state most unfit for conceiving them.</P>
<P>As the opposition of contrasted sentiments heightens their vivacity,
so the resemblance of those which immediately succeed each other
renders them more faint and languid. A parent who has lost several
children immediately after one another, will be less affected with
the death of the last than with that of the first, though the loss in
itself be, in this case, undoubtedly greater; but his mind being al∣ready
sunk into sorrow, the new misfortune seems to produce no
other effect than a continuance of the same melancholy, and is by
no means apt to occasion such transports of grief as are ordinarily
excited by the first calamity of the kind; he receives it, though with
great dejection, yet with some degree of calmness and composure,
and without any thing of that anguish and agitation of mind which
the novelty of the misfortune is apt to occasion. Those who have
been unfortunate through the whole course of their lives are often
indeed habitually melancholy, and sometimes peevish and splenetic,
yet upon any fresh disappointment, though they are vexed and com∣plain
a little, they seldom fly out into any more violent passion, and
never fall into those transports of rage or grief which often, upon
the like occasions, distract the fortunate and successful.</P>
<P>Upon this are founded, in a great measure, some of the effects of
habit and custom. It is well known that custom deadens the viva∣city
of both pain and pleasure, abates the grief we should feel for
the one, and weakens the joy we should derive from the other. The
pain is supported without agony, and the pleasure enjoyed without
<PB N="10" REF="103"/>
rapture: because custom and the frequent repetition of any object
comes at last to form and bend the mind or organ to that habitual
mood and disposition which sits them to receive its impression, with∣out
undergoing any very violent change.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Wonder, or of the Effects of Novelty.</HEAD>
<P>IT is evident that the mind takes pleasure in observing the re∣semblances
that are discoverable betwixt different objects. It is
by means of such observations that it endeavours to arrange and
methodise all its ideas, and to reduce them into proper classes and
assortments. Where it can observe but one single quality, that is
common to a great variety of otherwise widely different objects,
that single circumstance will be sufficient for it to connect them all
together, to reduce them to one common class, and to call them by
one general name. It is thus that all things endowed with a power
of self-motion, beasts, birds, fishes, insects, are classed under the ge∣neral
name of Animal; and that these again, along with those
which want that power, are arranged under the still more general
word Substance: and this is the origin of those assortments of ob∣jects
and ideas which in the schools are called Genera and Species,
and of those abstract and general names, which in all languages are
made use of to express them.</P>
<P>The further we advance in knowledge and experience, the greater
number of divisions and subdivisions of those Genera and Species we
are both inclined and obliged to make. We observe a greater va∣riety
of particularities amongst those things which have a gross re∣semblance;
and having made new divisions of them, according to
<PB N="11" REF="104"/>
those newly-observed particularities, we are then no longer to be
satisfied with being able to refer an object to a remote genus, or
very general class of things, to many of which it has but a loose
and imperfect resemblance. A person, indeed, unacquainted with
botany may expect to satisfy your curiosity, by telling you, that
such a vegetable is a weed, or, perhaps in still more general terms,
that it is a plant. But a botanist will neither give nor accept of such
an answer. He has broke and divided that great class of objects
into a number of inferior assortments, according to those varieties
which his experience has discovered among them; and he wants to
refer each individual plant to some tribe of vegetables, with all of
which it may have a more exact resemblance, than with many things
comprehended under the extensive genus of plants. A child ima∣gines
that it gives a satisfactory answer when it tells you, that an
object whose name it knows not is a thing, and fancies that it in∣forms
you of something, when it thus ascertains to which of the
two most obvious and comprehensive classes of objects a particular
impression ought to be referred; to the class of realities or solid
substances which it calls <HI>things,</HI> or to that of appearances which it
calls <HI>nothings.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever, in short, occurs to us we are fond of referring to some
species or class of things, with all of which it has a nearly exact re∣semblance;
and though we often know no more about them than
about it, yet we are apt to fancy that by being able to do so, we
show ourselves to be better acquainted with it, and to have a more
thorough insight into its nature. But when something quite new and
singular is presented, we feel ourselves incapable of doing this. The
memory cannot, from all its stores, cast up any image that nearly
resembles this strange appearance. If by some of its qualities it seems
to resemble, and to be connected with a species which we have before
been acquainted with, it is by others separated and detached from
<PB N="12" REF="105"/>
that, and from all the other assortments of things we have hitherto
been able to make. It stands alone and by itself in the imagination,
and refuses to be grouped or confounded with any set of objects
whatever. The imagination and memory exert themselves to no
purpose, and in vain look around all their classes of ideas in order to
find one under which it may be arranged. They fluctuate to no
purpose from thought to thought, and we remain still uncertain and
undetermined where to place it, or what to think of it. It is this
fluctuation and vain recollection, together with the emotion or move∣ment
of the spirits that they excite, which constitute the sentiment
properly called <HI>Wonder,</HI> and which occasion that staring, and some∣times
that rolling of the eyes, that suspension of the breath, and
that swelling of the heart, which we may all observe, both in ourselves
and others, when wondering at some new object, and which are the
natural symptoms of uncertain and undetermined thought. What
sort of a thing can that be? What is that like? are the questions
which, upon such an occasion, we are all naturally disposed to ask.
If we can recollect many such objects which exactly resemble this
new appearance, and which present themselves to the imagination
naturally, and as it were of their own accord, our Wonder is en∣tirely
at an end. If we can recollect but a few, and which it re∣quires
too some trouble to be able to call up, our Wonder is indeed
diminished, but not quite destroyed. If we can recollect none, but
are quite at a loss, it is the greatest possible.</P>
<P>With what curious attention does a naturalist examine a singular
plant, or a singular fossil, that is presented to him? He is at no loss
to refer it to the general genus of plants or fossils; but this does not
satisfy him, and when he considers all the different tribes or species
of either with which he has hitherto been acquainted, they all, he
thinks, refuse to admit the new object among them. It stands alone
in his imagination, and as it were detached from all the other species
<PB N="13" REF="106"/>
of that genus to which it belongs. He labours, however, to con∣nect
it with some one or other of them. Sometimes he thinks it
may be placed in this, and sometimes in that other assortment; nor
is he ever satisfied, till he has fallen upon one which, in most of
its qualities, it resembles. When he cannot do this, rather than it
should stand quite by itself, he will enlarge the precincts, if I may
say so, of some species, in order to make room for it; or he will
create a new species on purpose to receive it, and call it a Play of
Nature, or give it some other appellation, under which he arranges
all the oddities that he knows not what else to do with. But to
some class or other of known objects he must refer it, and betwixt
it and them he must find out some resemblance or other, before he
can get rid of that Wonder, that uncertainty and anxious curiosity
excited by its singular appearance, and by its dissimilitude with all
the objects he had hitherto observed.</P>
<P>As single and individual objects thus excite our Wonder when, by
their uncommon qualities and singular appearance, they make us
uncertain to what species of things we ought to refer them; so a
succession of objects which follow one another in an uncommon train
or order, will produce the same effect, though there be nothing par∣ticular
in any one of them taken by itself.</P>
<P>When one accustomed object appears after another, which it does
not usually follow, it first excites, by its unexpectedness, the senti∣ment
properly called Surprise, and afterwards, by the singularity of
the succession, or order of its appearance, the sentiment properly
called Wonder. We start and are surprised at seeing it there, and
then wonder how it came there. The motion of a small piece of
iron along a plain table is in itself no extraordinary object, yet the
person who first saw it begin, without any visible impulse, in conse∣quence
of the motion of a loadstone at some little distance from it,
<PB N="14" REF="107"/>
could not behold it without the most extreme Surprise; and when
that momentary emotion was over, he would still wonder how it
came to be conjoined to an event with which, according to the or∣dinary
train of things, he could have so little suspected it to have any
connection.</P>
<P>When two objects, however unlike, have often been observed to
follow each other, and have constantly presented themselves to the
senses in that order, they come to be so connected together in the
fancy, that the idea of the one seems, of its own accord, to call up
and introduce that of the other. If the objects are still observed to
succeed each other as before, this connection, or, as it has been
called, this association of their ideas, becomes stricter and stricter,
and the habit of the imagination to pass from the conception of the
one to that of the other, grows more and more rivetted and con∣firmed.
As its ideas move more rapidly than external objects, it is
continually running before them, and therefore anticipates, before it
happens, every event which falls out according to this ordinary
course of things. When objects succeed each other in the same train
in which the ideas of the imagination have thus been accustomed to
move, and in which, though not conducted by that chain of events
presented to the senses, they have acquired a tendency to go on of
their own accord, such objects appear all closely connected with one
another, and the thought glides easily along them, without effort
and without interruption. They fall in with the natural career of
the imagination; and as the ideas which represented such a train of
things would seem all mutually to introduce each other, every last
thought to be called up by the foregoing, and to call up the succeed∣ing;
so when the objects themselves occur, every last event seems,
in the same manner, to be introduced by the foregoing, and to in∣troduce
the succeeding. There is no break, no stop, no gap, no
interval. The ideas excited by so coherent a chain of things seem,
<PB N="15" REF="108"/>
as it were, to float through the mind of their own accord, without
obliging it to exert itself, or to make any effort in order to pass from
one of them to another.</P>
<P>But if this customary connection be interrupted, if one or more
objects appear in an order quite different from that to which the
imagination has been accustomed, and for which it is prepared, the
contrary of all this happens. We are at first surprised by the unex∣pectedness
of the new appearance, and when that momentary emotion
is over, we still wonder how it came to occur in that place. The
imagination no longer feels the usual facility of passing from the event
which goes before to that which comes after. It is an order or law
of succession to which it has not been accustomed, and which it
therefore finds some difficulty in following, or in attending to. The
fancy is stopped and interrupted in that natural movement or career,
according to which it was proceeding. Those two events seem to
stand at a distance from each other; it endeavours to bring them to∣gether,
but they refuse to unite; and it feels, or imagines it feels,
something like a gap or interval betwixt them. It naturally hesi∣tates,
and, as it were, pauses upon the brink of this interval; it
endeavours to find out something which may fill up the gap,
which, like a bridge, may so far at least unite those seemingly
distant objects, as to render the passage of the thought betwixt them
smooth, and natural, and easy. The supposition of a chain of inter∣mediate,
though invisible, events, which succeed each other in a
train similar to that in which the imagination has been accustomed to
move, and which link together those two disjointed appearances,
is the only means by which the imagination can fill up this interval,
is the only bridge which, if one may say so, can smooth its passage
from the one object to the other. Thus, when we observe the mo∣tion
of the iron, in consequence of that of the loadstone, we gaze
and hesitate, and feel a want of connection betwixt two events
<PB N="16" REF="109"/>
which follow one another in so unusual a train. But when, with
Des Cartes, we imagine certain invisible effluvia to circulate round
one of them, and by their repeated impulses to impel the other, both
to move towards it, and to follow its motion, we fill up the interval
betwixt them, we join them together by a sort of bridge, and thus take
off that hesitation and difficulty which the imagination felt in passing
from the one to the other. That the iron should move after the
loadstone seems, upon this hypothesis, in some measure according to
the ordinary course of things. Motion after impulse is an order of
succession with which of all things we are the most familiar. Two
objects which are so connected seem no longer to be disjoined, and
the imagination flows smoothly and easily along them.</P>
<P>Such is the nature of this second species of Wonder, which arises
from an unusual succession of things. The stop which is thereby
given to the career of the imagination, the difficulty which it finds
in passing along such disjointed objects, and the feeling of some∣thing
like a gap or interval betwixt them, constitute the whole es∣sence
of this emotion. Upon the clear discovery of a connecting
chain of intermediate events, it vanishes altogether. What ob∣structed
the movement of the imagination is then removed. Who
wonders at the machinery of the opera-house who has once been
admitted behind the scenes? In the Wonders of nature, however,
it rarely happens that we can discover so clearly this connecting
chain. With regard to a few even of them, indeed, we seem to
have been really admitted behind the scenes, and our Wonder ac∣cordingly
is entirely at an end. Thus the eclipses of the sun and
moon, which once, more than all the other appearances in the hea∣vens,
excited the terror and amazement of mankind, seem now no
longer to be wonderful, since the connecting chain has been found
out which joins them to the ordinary course of things. Nay, in
those cases in which we have been less successful, even the vague
<PB N="17" REF="110"/>
hypotheses of Des Cartes, and the yet more indetermined notions
of Aristotle, have, with their followers, contributed to give some co∣herence
to the appearances of nature, and might diminish, though
they could not destroy, their Wonder. If they did not completely
fill up the interval betwixt the two disjointed objects, they bestowed
upon them, however, some sort of loose connection which they
wanted before.</P>
<P>That the imagination feels a real difficulty in passing along two
events which follow one another in an uncommon order, may be
confirmed by many obvious observations. If it attempts to attend
beyond a certain time to a long series of this kind, the continual
efforts it is obliged to make, in order to pass from one object to
another, and thus follow the progress of the succession, soon fa∣tigue
it, and if repeated too often, disorder and disjoint its whole
frame. It is thus that too severe an application to study sometimes
brings on lunacy and frenzy, in those especially who are somewhat
advanced in life, but whose imaginations, from being too late in ap∣plying,
have not got those habits which dispose them to follow easily
the reasonings in the abstract sciences. Every step of a demonstra∣tion,
which to an old practitioner is quite natural and easy, requires
from them the most intense application of thought. Spurred on,
however, either by ambition, or by admiration for the subject, they
still continue till they become, first confused, then giddy, and at last
distracted. Could we conceive a person of the soundest judgment,
who had grown up to maturity, and whose imagination had acquired
those habits, and that mold, which the constitution of things in this
world necessarily impress upon it, to be all at once transported alive
to some other planet, where nature was governed by laws quite dif∣ferent
from those which take place here; as he would be continually
obliged to attend to events, which must to him appear in the highest
degree jarring, irregular, and discordant, he would soon feel the
<PB N="18" REF="111"/>
same confusion and giddiness begin to come upon him, which would
at last end in the same manner, in lunacy and distraction. Neither,
to produce this effect, is it necessary that the objects should be either
great or interesting, or even uncommon, in themselves. It is suffi∣cient
that they follow one another in an uncommon order. Let any
one attempt to look over even a game of cards, and to attend parti∣cularly
to every single stroke, and if he is unacquainted with the
nature and rules of the game; that is, with the laws which regu∣late
the succession of the cards; he will soon feel the same confusion
and giddiness begin to come upon him, which, were it to be conti∣nued
for days and months, would end in the same manner, in lunacy
and distraction. But if the mind be thus thrown into the most vio∣lent
disorder, when it attends to a long series of events which fol∣low
one another in an uncommon train, it must feel some degree of
the same disorder, when it observes even a single event fall out in
this unusual manner: for the violent disorder can arise from no∣thing
but the too frequent repetition of this smaller uneasiness.</P>
<P>That it is the unusualness alone of the succession which occasions
this stop and interruption in the progress of the imagination, as well
as the notion of an interval betwixt the two immediately succeeding
objects, to be filled up by some chain of intermediate events, is not
less evident. The same orders of succession, which to one set of
men seem quite according to the natural course of things, and such
as require no intermediate events to join them, shall to another
appear altogether incoherent and disjointed, unless some such events
be supposed: and this for no other reason, but because such orders
of succession are familiar to the one, and strange to the other. When
we enter the work-houses of the most common artizans; such as
dyers, brewers, distillers; we observe a number of appearances,
which present themselves in an order that seems to us very strange
and wonderful. Our thought cannot easily follow it, we feel an
<PB N="19" REF="112"/>
interval betwixt every two of them, and require some chain of inter∣mediate
events, to fill it up, and link them together. But the artizan
himself, who has been for many years familiar with the conse∣quences
of all the operations of his art, feels no such interval. They
fall in with what custom has made the natural movement of his ima∣gination:
they no longer excite his Wonder, and if he is not a
genius superior to his profession, so as to be capable of making
the very easy reflection, that those things, though familiar to him,
may be strange to us, he will be disposed rather to laugh at, than
sympathize with our Wonder. He cannot conceive what occasion
there is for any connecting events to unite those appearances, which
seem to him to succeed each other very naturally. It is their nature,
he tells us, to follow one another in this order, and that accordingly
they always do so. In the same manner bread has, since the world
began, been the common nourishment of the human body, and men
have so long seen it, every day, converted into flesh and bones, sub∣stances
in all respects so unlike it, that they have seldom had the cu∣riosity
to inquire by what process of intermediate events this change is
brought about. Because the passage of the thought from the one ob∣ject
to the other is by custom become quite smooth and easy, almost
without the supposition of any such process. Philosophers, indeed, who
often look for a chain of invisible objects to join together two events
that occur in an order familiar to all the world, have endeavoured to
find out a chain of this kind betwixt the two events I have just
now mentioned; in the same manner as they have endeavoured, by
a like intermediate chain, to connect the gravity, the elasticity, and
even the cohesion of natural bodies, with some of their other qua∣lities.
These, however, are all of them such combinations of events
as give no stop to the imaginations of the bulk of mankind, as ex∣cite
no Wonder, nor any apprehension that there is wanting the
strictest connection between them. But as in those sounds, which
to the greater part of men seem perfectly agreeable to measure
<PB N="20" REF="113"/>
and harmony, the nicer ear of a musician will discover a want,
both of the most exact time, and of the most perfect coincidence:
so the more practised thought of a philosopher, who has spent his
whole life in the study of the connecting principles of nature, will
often feel an interval betwixt two objects, which, to more careless
observers, seem very strictly conjoined. By long attention to all the
connections which have ever been presented to his observation, by
having often compared them with one another, he has, like the mu∣sician,
acquired, if one may say so, a nicer ear, and a more delicate
feeling with regard to things of this nature. And as to the one, that
music seems dissonance which falls short of the most perfect harmo∣ny;
so to the other, those events seem altogether separated and dis∣joined,
which fall short of the strictest and most perfect connection.</P>
<P>Philosophy is the science of the connecting principles of nature.
Nature, after the largest experience that common observation can
acquire, seems to abound with events which appear solitary and in∣coherent
with all that go before them, which therefore disturb the
easy movement of the imagination; which make its ideas succeed
each other, if one may say so, by irregular starts and sallies; and
which thus tend, in some measure, to introduce those confusions and
distractions we formerly mentioned. Philosophy, by representing
the invisible chains which bind together all these disjointed objects,
endeavours to introduce order into this chaos of jarring and discord∣ant
appearances, to allay this tumult of the imagination, and to re∣store
it, when it surveys the great revolutions of the universe, to that
tone of tranquillity and composure, which is both most agreeable in
itself, and most suitable to its nature. Philosophy, therefore, may
be regarded as one of those arts which address themselves to the ima∣gination;
and whose theory and history, upon that account, fall pro∣perly
within the circumference of our subject. Let us endeavour to
trace it, from its first origin, up to that summit of perfection to which
<PB N="21" REF="114"/>
it is at present supposed to have arrived, and to which, indeed, it has
equally been supposed to have arrived in almost all former times. It
is the most sublime of all the agreeable arts, and its revolutions have
been the greatest, the most frequent, and the most distinguished of
all those that have happened in the literary world. Its history, there∣fore,
must, upon all accounts, be the most entertaining and the most
instructive. Let us examine, therefore, all the different systems of
nature, which, in these western parts of the world, the only parts of
whose history we know any thing, have successively been adopted by
the learned and ingenious; and, without regarding their absurdity or
probability, their agreement or inconsistency with truth and reality,
let us consider them only in that particular point of view which be∣longs
to our subject; and content ourselves with inquiring how far
each of them was fitted to sooth the imagination, and to render the
theatre of nature a more coherent, and therefore a more magnificent
spectacle, than otherwise it would have appeared to be. According as
they have failed or succeeded in this, they have constantly failed or
succeeded in gaining reputation and renown to their authors; and
this will be found to be the clew that is most capable of conducting
us through all the labyrinths of philosophical history: for, in the
mean time, it will serve to confirm what has gone before, and to
throw light upon what is to come after, that we observe, in general,
that no system, how well soever in other respects supported, has ever
been able to gain any general credit on the world, whose connecting
principles were not such as were familiar to all mankind. Why has
the chemical philosophy in all ages crept along in obscurity, and
been so disregarded by the generality of mankind, while other sys∣tems,
less useful, and not more agreeable to experience, have possessed
universal admiration for whole centuries together? The connecting
principles of the chemical philosophy are such as the generality of
mankind know nothing about, have rarely seen, and have never been
acquainted with; and which to them, therefore, are incapable of
<PB N="22" REF="115"/>
smoothing the passage of the imagination betwixt any two seemingly
disjointed objects. Salts, sulphurs, and mercuries, acids, and alkalis,
are principles which can smooth things to those only who live about
the furnace; but whose most common operations seem, to the bulk
of mankind, as disjointed as any two events which the chemists
would connect together by them. Those artists, however, naturally
explained things to themselves by principles that were familiar to
themselves. As Aristotle observes, that the early Pythagoreans, who
first studied arithmetic, explained all things by the properties of num∣bers;
and Cicero tells us, that Aristoxenus, the musician, found the
nature of the soul to consist in harmony. In the same manner, a
learned physician lately gave a system of moral philosophy upon the
the principles of his own art, in which wisdom and virtue were the
healthful state of the soul; the different vices and follies, the differ∣ent
diseases to which it was subject; in which the causes and symp∣toms
of those diseases were ascertained; and, in the same medical
strain, a proper method of cure prescribed. In the same manner
also, others have written parallels of painting and poetry, of poetry
and music, of music and architecture, of beauty and virtue, of all
the fine arts; systems which have universally owed their origin to the
lucubrations of those who were acquainted with the one art, but ig∣norant
of the other; who therefore explained to themselves the phae∣nomena,
in that which was strange to them, by those in that which
was familiar; and with whom, upon that account, the analogy,
which in other writers gives occasion to a few ingenious similitudes,
became the great hinge upon which every thing turned.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Origin of Philosophy.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND, in the first ages of society, before the establishment
of law, order, and security, have little curiosity to find out
those hidden chains of events which bind together the seemingly dis∣jointed
appearances of nature. A savage, whose subsistence is preca∣rious,
whose life is every day exposed to the rudest dangers, has no
inclination to amuse himself with searching out what, when disco∣vered,
seems to serve no other purpose than to render the theatre of
nature a more connected spectacle to his imagination. Many of these
smaller incoherences, which in the course of things perplex philoso∣phers,
entirely escape his attention. Those more magnificent irregu∣larities,
whose grandeur he cannot overlook, call forth his amaze∣ment.
Comets, eclipses, thunder, lightning, and other meteors, by
their greatness, naturally overawe him, and he views them with a
reverence that approaches to fear. His inexperience and uncertainty
with regard to every thing about them, how they came, how they
are to go, what went before, what is to come after them, exasperate
his sentiment into terror and consternation. But our passions, as Fa∣ther
Malbranche observes, all justify themselves; that is, suggest to
us opinions which justify them. As those appearances terrify him,
therefore, he is disposed to believe every thing about them which can
render them still more the objects of his terror. That they proceed
from some intelligent, though invisible causes, of whose vengeance
and displeasure they are either the signs or the effects, is the notion
of all others most capable of enhancing this passion, and is that,
therefore, which he is most apt to entertain. To this too, that cow∣ardice
and pusillanimity, so natural to man in his uncivilized state,
<PB N="24" REF="117"/>
still more disposes him; unprotected by the laws of society, exposed,
defenceless, he feels his weakness upon all occasions; his strength
and security upon none.</P>
<P>But all the irregularities of nature are not of this awful or
terrible kind. Some of them are perfectly beautiful and agreeable.
These, therefore, from the same impotence of mind, would be be∣held
with love and complacency, and even with transports of grati∣tude;
for whatever is the cause of pleasure naturally excites our gra∣titude.
A child caresses the fruit that is agreeable to it, as it beats
the stone that hurts it. The notions of a savage are not very differ∣ent.
The ancient Athenians, who solemnly punished the axe which
had accidentally been the cause of the death of a man, erected altars,
and offered sacrifices to the rainbow. Sentiments not unlike these,
may sometimes, upon such occasions, begin to be felt even in the
breasts of the most civilized, but are presently checked by the reflec∣tion,
that the things are not their proper objects. But a savage,
whose notions are guided altogether by wild nature and passion,
waits for no other proof that a thing is the proper object of any sen∣timent,
than that it excites it. The reverence and gratitude, with
which some of the appearances of nature inspire him, convince him
that they are the proper objects of reverence and gratitude, and
therefore proceed from some intelligent beings, who take pleasure in
the expressions of those sentiments. With him, therefore, every ob∣ject
of nature, which by its beauty or greatness, its utility or hurt∣fulness,
is considerable enough to attract his attention, and whose
operations are not perfectly regular, is supposed to act by the direc∣tion
of some invisible and designing power. The sea is spread out
into a calm, or heaved into a storm, according to the good pleasure
of Neptune. Does the earth pour forth an exuberant harvest? It is
owing to the indulgence of Ceres. Does the vine yield a plentiful
vintage? It flows from the bounty of Bacohus. Do either refuse their
<PB N="25" REF="118"/>
presents? It is ascribed to the displeasure of those ofsended deities.
The tree, which now flourishes, and now decays, is inhabited by a
Dryad, upon whose health or sickness its various appearances depend.
The fountain, which sometimes flows in a copious, and sometimes in
a scanty stream, which appears sometimes clear and limpid, and at
other times muddy and disturbed, is affected in all its changes by the
Naiad who dwells within it. Hence the origin of Polytheism, and
of that vulgar superstition which ascribes all the irregular events of
nature to the favour or displeasure of intelligent, though invisible be∣ings,
to gods, daemons, witches, genii, fairies. For it may be ob∣served,
that in all Polytheistic religions, among savages, as well as in
the early ages of Heathen antiquity, it is the irregular events of na∣ture
only that are ascribed to the agency and power of their gods.
Fire burns, and water refreshes; heavy bodies descend, and lighter
substances fly upwards, by the necessity of their own nature; nor
was the invisible hand of Jupiter ever apprehended to be employed
in those matters. But thunder and lightning, storms and sunshine,
those more irregular events, were ascribed to his favour, or his an∣ger.
Man, the only designing power with which they were ac∣quainted,
never acts but either to stop, or to alter the course, which
natural events would take, if left to themselves. Those other intelli∣gent
beings, whom they imagined, but knew not, were naturally
supposed to act in the same manner; not to employ themselves in
supporting the ordinary course of things, which went on of its own
accord, but to stop, to thwart, and to disturb it. And thus, in the
first ages of the world, the lowest and most pusillanimous superstition
supplied the place of philosophy.</P>
<P>But when law has established order and security, and subsistence
ceases to be precarious, the curiosity of mankind is increased, and
their fears are diminished. The leisure which they then enjoy ren∣ders
them more attentive to the appearances of nature, more observ∣ant
<PB N="26" REF="119"/>
of her smallest irregularities, and more desirous to know what is
the chain which links them all together. That some such chain sub∣sists
betwixt all her seemingly disjointed phoenomena, they are neces∣sarily
led to conceive; and that magnanimity, and cheerfulness, which
all generous natures acquire who are bred in civilized societies, where
they have so few occasions to feel their weakness, and so many to be
conscious of their strength and security, renders them less disposed to
employ, for this connecting chain, those invisible beings whom the
fear and ignorance of their rude forefathers had engendered. Those
of liberal fortunes, whose attention is not much occupied either with
business or with pleasure, can fill up the void of their imagination,
which is thus disengaged from the ordinary affairs of life, no other
way than by attending to that train of events which passes around
them. While the great objects of nature thus pass in review before
them, many things occur in an order to which they have not been
accustomed. Their imagination, which accompanies with ease and
delight the regular progress of nature, is stopped and embarrassed by
those seeming incoherences; they excite their wonder, and seem to
require some chain of intermediate events, which, by connecting
them with something that has gone before, may thus render the
whole course of the universe consistent and of a piece. Wonder,
therefore, and not any expectation of advantage from its discoveries,
is the first principle which prompts mankind to the study of Philoso∣phy,
of that science which pretends to lay open the concealed con∣nections
that unite the various appearances of nature; and they pur∣sue
this study for its own sake, as an original pleasure or good in it∣self,
without regarding its tendency to procure them the means of
many other pleasures.</P>
<P>Greece, and the Greek colonies in Sicily, Italy, and the Lesser
Asia, were the first countries which, in these western parts of the
world, arrived at a state of civilized society. It was in them, there∣fore,
<PB N="27" REF="120"/>
that the first philosophers, of whose doctrine we have any dis∣tinct
account, appeared. Law and order seem indeed to have been
established in the great monarchies of Asia and Egypt, long before
they had any footing in Greece: yet, after all that has been said con∣cerning
the learning of the Chaldeans and Egyptians, whether there
ever was in those nations any thing which deserved the name of
science, or whether that despotism which is more destructive of se∣curity
and leisure than anarchy itself, and which prevailed over all
the East, prevented the growth of Philosophy, is a question which,
for want of monuments, cannot be determined with any degree of
precision.</P>
<P>The Greek colonies having been settled amid nations either alto∣gether
barbarous, or altogether unwarlike, over whom, therefore, they
soon acquired a very great authority, seem, upon that account, to have
arrived at a considerable degree of empire and opulence before any
state in the parent country had surmounted that extreme poverty,
which, by leaving no room for any evident distinction of ranks, is
necessarily attended with the confusion and misrule which flows from
a want of all regular subordination. The Greek islands being secure
from the invasion of land armies, or from naval forces, which were
in those days but little known, seem, upon that account too, to have
got before the continent in all sorts of civility and improvement.
The first philosophers, therefore, as well as the first poets, seem all
to have been natives, either of their colonies, or of their islands. It
was from thence that Homer, Archilochus, Stesichorus, Simonides,
Sappho, Anacreon, derived their birth. Thales and Pythagoras, the
founders of the two earliest sects of philosophy, arose, the one in an
Asiatic colony, the other in an island; and neither of them esta∣lished
his school in the mother country.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="121"/>
What was the particular system of either of those two philoso∣phers,
or whether their doctrine was so methodized as to deserve the
name of a system, the imperfection, as well as the uncertainty of all
the traditions that have come down to us concerning them, makes it
impossible to determine. The school of Pythagoras, however, seems
to have advanced further in the study of the connecting prin∣ciples
of nature, than that of the Ionian philosopher. The accounts
which are given of Anaximander, Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Ar∣chelaus,
the successors of Thales, represent the doctrines of those
sages as full of the most inextricable confusion. Something, how∣ever,
that approaches to a composed and orderly system, may be
traced in what is delivered down to us concerning the doctrine of
Empedocles, of Archytas, of Timaeus, and of Ocellus the Lucanian,
the most renowned philosophers of the Italian school. The opinions
of the two last coincide pretty much; the one, with those of Plato;
the other, with those of Aristotle; nor do those of the two first seem
to have been very different, of whom the one was the author of the
doctrine of the Four Elements, the other the inventor of the Cate∣gories;
who, therefore, may be regarded as the founders, the one,
of the ancient Physics; the other, of the ancient Dialectic; and, how
closely these were connected, will appear hereafter. It was in the
school of Socrates, however, from Plato and Aristotle, that Philoso∣phy
first received that form, which introduced her, if one may say
so, to the general acquaintance of the world. It is from them, there∣fore,
that we shall begin to give her history in any detail. What∣ever
was valuable in the former systems, which was at all consistent
with their general principles, they seem to have consolidated into their
own. From the Ionian Philosophy, I have not been able to discover
that they derived any thing. From the Pythagorean school, both
Plato and Aristotle seem to have derived the fundamental principles
of almost all their doctrines. Plato, too, appears to have borrowed
<PB N="29" REF="122"/>
something from two other sects of philosophers, whose extreme ob∣scurity
seems to have prevented them from acquiring themselves any
extensive reputation: the one was that of Cratylus and Heraclitus;
the other was that of Xenophanes, Parmenides, Melissus, and Zeno.
To pretend to rescue the system of any of those antesocratic sages,
from that oblivion which at present covers them all, would be a vain
and useless attempt. What seems, however, to have been borrowed
from them, shall sometimes be marked as we go along.</P>
<P>There was still another school of philosophy, earlier than Plato,
from which, however, he was so far from borrowing any thing, that
he seems to have bent the whole force of his reason to discredit and
expose its principles. This was the Philosophy of Leucippus, De∣mocritus,
and Protagoras, which accordingly seems to have submitted
to his eloquence, to have lain dormant, and to have been almost for∣gotten
for some generations, till it was afterwards more successfully
revived by Epicurus.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The History of Astronomy.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the phoenomena of nature, the celestial appearances are, by
their greatness and beauty, the most universal objects of the cu∣riosity
of mankind. Those who surveyed the heavens with the most
careless attention, necessarily distinguished in them three different sorts
of objects; the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars. These last, appearing
always in the same situation, and at the same distance with regard to
one another, and seeming to revolve every day round the earth in
parallel circles, which widened gradually from the poles to the equa∣tor,
were naturally thought to have all the marks of being fixed,
<PB N="30" REF="123"/>
like so many gems, in the concave side of the firmament, and of
being carried round by the diurnal revolutions of that solid body:
for the azure sky, in which the stars seem to float, was readily ap∣prehended,
upon account of the uniformity of their apparent mo∣tions,
to be a solid body, the roof or outer wall of the universe, to
whose inside all those little sparkling objects were attached.</P>
<P>The Sun and Moon, often changing their distance and situation,
in regard to the other heavenly bodies, could not be apprehended to
be attached to the same sphere with them. They assigned, there∣fore,
to each of them, a sphere of its own; that is, supposed each
of them to be attached to the concave side of a solid and transparent
body, by whose revolutions they were carried round the earth.
There was not indeed, in this case, the same ground for the suppo∣sition
of such a sphere as in that of the Fixed Stars; for neither the
Sun nor the Moon appear to keep always at the same distance with
regard to any one of the other heavenly bodies. But as the motion
of the Stars had been accounted for by an hypothesis of this kind, it
rendered the theory of the heavens more uniform, to account for
that of the Sun and Moon in the same manner. The sphere of the
Sun they placed above that of the Moon; as the Moon was evidently
seen in eclipses to pass betwixt the Sun and the Earth. Each of them
was supposed to revolve by a motion of its own, and at the same
time to be affected by the motion of the Fixed Stars. Thus, the Sun
was carried round from east to west by the communicated move∣ment
of this outer sphere, which produced his diurnal revolutions,
and the vicissitudes of day and night; but at the same time he had
a motion of his own, contrary to this, from west to east, which oc∣casioned
his annual revolution, and the continual shifting of his
place with regard to the Fixed Stars. This motion was more easy,
they thought, when carried on edgeways, and not in direct oppo∣sition
to the motion of the outer sphere, which occasioned the in∣clination
<PB N="31" REF="124"/>
of the axis of the sphere of the Sun, to that of the sphere
of the Fixed Stars; this again produced the obliquity of the ecliptic,
and the consequent changes of the seasons. The moon, being placed
below the sphere of the Sun, had both a shorter course to finish, and
was less obstructed by the contrary movement of the sphere of the
Fixed Stars, from which she was farther removed. She finished her
period, therefore, in a shorter time, and required but a month, in∣stead
of a year, to complete it.</P>
<P>The Stars, when more attentively surveyed, were some of them ob∣served
to be less constant and uniform in their motions than the rest,
and to change their situations with regard to the other heavenly
bodies; moving generally eastwards, yet appearing sometimes to
stand still, and sometimes even to move westwards. These, to the
number of five, were distinguished by the name of Planets, or
wandering Stars, and marked with the particular appellations of Sa∣turn,
Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. As, like the Sun and
Moon, they seem to accompany the motion of the Fixed Stars from
east to west, but at the same time to have a motion of their own,
which is generally from west to east; they were each of them, as
well as those two great lamps of heaven, apprehended to be attached
to the inside of a solid concave and transparent sphere, which had a
revolution of its own, that was almost directly contrary to the revo∣lution
of the outer heaven, but which, at the same time, was hurried
along by the superior violence and rapidity of this last.</P>
<P>This is the system of concentric Spheres, the first regular system
of Astronomy, which the world beheld, as it was taught in the Ita∣lian
school before Aristotle and his two cotemporary philosophers,
Eudoxus and Callippus, had given it all the perfection which it is
capable of receiving. Though rude and inartificial, it is capable of
connecting together, in the imagination, the grandest and the most
<PB N="32" REF="125"/>
seemingly disjointed appearances in the heavens. The motions of
the most remarkable objects in the celestial regions, the Sun, the
Moon, and the Fixed Stars, are suffic ently connected with one ano∣ther
by this hypothesis. The eclipses of these two great luminaries
are, though not so easily calculated, as easily explained, upon this
ancient, as upon the modern system. When these early philosophers
explained to their disciples the very simple causes of those dreadful
phoenomena, it was under the seal of the most sacred secrecy, that
they might avoid the fury of the people, and not incur the imputa∣tion
of impiety, when they thus took from the gods the direction of
those events, which were apprehended to be the most terrible tokens
of their impending vengeance. The obliquity of the ecliptic, the
consequent changes of the seasons, the vicissitudes of day and night,
and the different lengths of both days and nights, in the different
seasons, correspond too, pretty exactly, with this ancient doctrine.
And if there had been no other bodies discoverable in the heavens
besides the Sun, the Moon, and the Fixed Stars, this old hypothesis
might have stood the examination of all ages, and have gone down
triumphant to the remotest posterity.</P>
<P>If it gained the belief of mankind by its plausibility, it attracted their
wonder and admiration; sentiments that still more confirmed their
belief, by the novelty and beauty of that view of nature which it
presented to the imagination. Before this system was taught in the
world, the earth was regarded as, what it appears to the eye, a vast,
rough, and irregular plain, the basis and foundation of the universe,
surrounded on all sides by the ocean, and whose roots extended
themselves through the whole of that infinite depth which is below
it. The sky was considered as a solid hemisphere, which covered
the earth, and united with the ocean at the extremity of the hori∣zon.
The Sun, the Moon, and all the heavenly bodies rose out of
the eastern, climbed up the convex side of the heavens, and de∣sceended
<PB N="33" REF="126"/>
again into the western ocean, and from thence, by some sub∣terraneous
passages, returned to their first chambers in the east. Nor
was this notion confined to the people, or to the poets who painted
the opinions of the people: it was held by Xenophanes, the founder
of the Eleatic philosophy, after that of the Ionian and Italian schools,
the earliest that appeared in Greece. Thales of Miletus too, who,
according to Aristotle, represented the Earth as floating upon an im∣mense
ocean of water, may have been nearly of the same opinion;
notwithstanding what we are told by Plutarch and Apuleius concern∣ing
his astronomical discoveries, all of which must plainly have been
of a much later date. To those who had no other idea of nature,
besides what they derived from so confused an account of things,
how agreeable must that system have appeared, which represented
the Earth as distinguished into land and water, self-balanced and sus∣pended
in the centre of the universe, surrounded by the elements of
Air and Ether, and covered by eight polished and cristalline Spheres,
each of which was distinguished by one or more beautiful and lu∣minous
bodies, and all of which revolved round their common
centre, by varied, but by equable and proportionable motions. It
seems to have been the beauty of this system that gave Plato the
notion of something like an harmonic proportion, to be discovered in
the motions and distances of the heavenly bodies; and which sug∣gested
to the earlier Pythagoreans, the celebrated fancy of the Musick
of the Spheres: a wild and romantic idea, yet such as does not ill
correspond with that admiration, which so beautiful a system, recom∣mended
too by the graces of novelty, is apt to inspire.</P>
<P>Whatever are the defects which this account of things labours
under, they are such, as to the first observers of the heavens could
not readily occur. If all the motions of the Five Planets cannot, the
greater part of them may, be easily connected by it; they and all
their motions are the least remarkable objects in the heavens; the
<PB N="34" REF="127"/>
greater part of mankind take no notice of them at all; and a system,
whose only defect lies in the account which it gives of them, cannot
thereby be much disgraced in their opinion. If some of the appear∣ances
too of the Sun and Moon, the sometimes accelerated and again
retarded motions of those luminaries but ill correspond with it;
these too, are such as cannot be discovered but by the most attentive
observation, and such therefore as we cannot wonder that the ima∣ginations
of the first enquirers should slur over, if one may say so,
and take little notice of.</P>
<P>It was, however, to remedy those defects, that Eudoxus, the
friend and auditor of Plato, found it necessary to increase the num∣ber
of the Celestial Spheres. Each Planet is sometimes observed to
advance forward in that eastward course which is peculiar to it∣self,
sometimes to retire backwards, and sometimes again to stand
still. To suppose that the Sphere of the Planet should by its own
motion, if one may say so, sometimes roll forwards, sometimes roll
backwards, and sometimes do neither the one nor the other, is con∣trary
to all the natural propensities of the imagination, which ac∣companies
with ease and delight any regular and orderly motion, but
feels itself perpetually stopped and interrupted, when it endeavours
to attend to one so desultory and uncertain. It would pursue, na∣turally
and of its own accord, the direct or progressive movement
of the Sphere, but is every now and then shocked, if one may say
so, and turned violently out of its natural career by the retrograde
and stationary appearances of the Planet, betwixt which and its
more usual motion, the fancy feels a want of connection, a gap or
interval, which it cannot fill up, but by supposing some chain of
intermediate events to join them. The hypothesis of a number of
other spheres revolving in the heavens, besides those in which the
luminous bodies themselves were infixed, was the chain with which
Eudoxus endeavoured to supply it. He bestowed four of these
<PB N="35" REF="128"/>
Spheres upon each of the Five Planets; one in which the luminous
body itself revolved, and three others above it. Each of these had
a regular and constant, but a peculiar movement of its own, which
it communicated to what was properly the Sphere of the Planet, and
thus occasioned that diversity of motions observable in those bodies.
One of these Spheres, for example, had an oscillatory motion, like
the circular pendulum of a watch. As when you turn round a
watch, like a Sphere upon its axis, the pendulum will, while turned
round along with it, still continue to oscillate, and communicate to
whatever body is comprehended within it, both its own oscillations
and the circular motion of the watch; so this oscillating Sphere,
being itself turned round by the motion of the Sphere above it,
communicated to the Sphere below it, that circular, as well as its
own oscillatory motion; produced by the one, the daily revolutions;
by the other, the direct, stationary, and retrograde appearances of
the Planet, which derived from a third Sphere that revolution by
which it performed its annual period. The motions of all these
Spheres were in themselves constant and equable, such as the ima∣gination
could easily attend to and pursue, and which connected to∣gether
that otherwise incoherent diversity of movements observable
in the Sphere of the Planet. The motions of the Sun and Moon
being more regular than those of the Five Planets, by assigning three
Spheres to each of them, Eudoxus imagined he could connect together
all the diversity of movements discoverable in either. The motion of
the Fixed Stars being perfectly regular, one Sphere he judged suffi∣cient
for them all. So that, according to this account, the whole
number of Celestial Spheres amounted to twenty-seven. Callippus,
though somewhat younger, the cotemporary of Eudoxus, found
that even this number was not enough to connect together the vast
variety of movements which he discovered in those bodies, and
therefore increased it to thirty-four. Aristotle, upon a yet more at∣tentive
observation, found that even all these Spheres would not be
<PB N="36" REF="129"/>
sufficient, and therefore added twenty-two more, which increased
their number to fifty-six. Later observers discovered still new
motions, and new inequalities, in the heavens. New Spheres were
therefore still to be added to the system, and some of them to be
placed even above that of the Fixed Stars. So that in the sixteenth
century, when Fracostorio, smit with the eloquence of Plato and
Aristotle, and with the regularity and harmony of their system, in
itself perfectly beautiful, though it corresponds but inaccurately with
the phaenomena, endeavoured to revive this ancient Astronomy,
which had long given place to that of Ptolemy and Hipparchus, he
found it necessary to multiply the number of Celestial Spheres to
seventy-two; neither were all these enough.</P>
<P>This system had now become as intricate and complex as those
appearances themselves, which it had been invented to render uni∣form
and coherent. The imagination, therefore, found itself but
little relieved from that embarrassment, into which those appearances
had thrown it, by so perplexed an account of things. Another sys∣tem,
for this reason, not long after the days of Aristotle, was in∣vented
by Apollonius, which was afterwards perfected by Hippar∣chus,
and has since been delivered down to us by Ptolemy, the more
artificial system of Eccentric Spheres and Epicycles.</P>
<P>In this system, they first distinguished betwixt the real and ap∣parent
motion of the heavenly bodies. These, they observed, upon
account of their immense distance, must necessarily appear to revolve
in circles concentric with the globe of the Earth, and with one ano∣ther:
but that we cannot, therefore, be certain that they really revolve
in such circles, since, though they did not, they would still have the
same appearance. By supposing, therefore, that the Sun and the
other Planets revolved in circles, whose centres were very distant
from the centre of the Earth; that consequently, in the progress of
<PB N="37" REF="130"/>
their revolution, they must sometimes approach nearer, and some∣times
recede further from it, and must, therefore, to its inhabitants
appear to move faster in the one case, and flower in the other,
those philosophers imagined they could account for the apparently
unequal velocities of all those bodies.</P>
<P>By supposing, that in the solidity of the Sphere of each of the
Five Planets there was formed another little Sphere, called an Epi∣cycle,
which revolved round its own centre, at the same time that
it was carried round the centre of the Earth by the revolution of
the great Sphere, betwixt those concave and convex sides it was
inclosed; in the same manner as we might suppose a little wheel
inclosed within the outer circle of a great wheel, and which whirled
about several times upon its own axis, while its centre was carried
round the axis of the great wheel, they imagined they could ac∣count
for the retrograde and stationary appearances of those most
irregular objects in the heavens. The Planet, they supposed, was
attached to the circumference, and whirled round the centre of this
little Sphere, at the same time that it was carried round the Earth
by the movement of the great Sphere. The revolution of this
little Sphere, or Epicycle, was such, that the Planet, when in the
upper part of it; that is, when furthest off and least sensible to the
eye; was carried round in the same direction with the centre of the
Epicycle, or with the Sphere in which the Epicycle was inclosed:
but when in the lower part, that is, when nearest and most sensible to
the eye; it was carried round in a direction contrary to that of the
centre of the Epicycle: in the same manner as every point in the
upper part of the outer circle of a coach-wheel revolves forward in
the same direction with the axis, while every point, in the lower
part, revolves backwards in a contrary direction to the axis. The
motions of the Planet, therefore, surveyed from the Earth appeared
direct, when in the upper part of the Epicycle, and retrograde, when
<PB N="38" REF="131"/>
in the lower. When again it either descended from the upper part
to the lower, or ascended from the lower to the upper, it necessarily
appeared stationary.</P>
<P>But, though, by the eccentricity of the great Sphere, they were
thus able, in some measure, to connect together the unequal veloci∣ties
of the heavenly bodies, and by the revolutions of the little
Sphere, the direct, stationary, and retrograde appearances of the
Planets, there was another difficulty that still remained. Neither the
Moon, nor the three superior Planets, appear always in the same
part of the heavens, when at their periods of most retarded motion,
or when they are supposed to be at the greatest distance from the
Earth. The apogeum therefore, or the point of greatest distance
from the Earth, in the Spheres of each of those bodies, must have a
movement of its own, which may carry it successively through all
the different points of the Ecliptic. They supposed, therefore, that
while the great eccentric Sphere revolved eastwards round its centre,
that its centre too revolved westwards in a circle of its own, round the
centre of the Earth, and thus carried its apogeum through all the
different points of the Ecliptic.</P>
<P>But with all those combined and perplexed circles; though the pa∣trons
of this system were able to give some degree of uniformity to
the real directions of the Planets, they found it impossible so to adjust
the velocities of those supposed pheres to the phoenomena, as that
the revolution of any one of them, when surveyed from its own
entre, should appear perfectly equable and uniform. From that
point, the only point in which the velocity of what moves in a
circle can be truly judged of, they would still appear irregular and
inconstant, and such as tended to embarrass and confound the ima∣gination.
They invented, therefore, for each of them, a new Circle,
called the Equalizing Circle, from whose centre they should all appear
<PB N="39" REF="132"/>
perfectly equable: that is, they so adjusted the velocities of these
Spheres, as that, though the revolution of each of them would appear
irregular when surveyed from its own centre, there should, however,
be a point comprehended within its circumference, from whence its
motions should appear to cut off, in equal times, equal portions of the
Circle, of which that point was the centre.</P>
<P>Nothing can more evidently show, how much the repose and tran∣quillity
of the imagination is the ultimate end of philosophy, than
the invention of this Equalizing Circle. The motions of the heavenly
bodies had appeared inconstant and irregular, both in their velocities
and in their directions. They were such, therefore, as tended to em∣barrass
and confound the imagination, whenever it attempted to trace
them. The invention of Eccentric Spheres, of Epicycles, and of the
revolution of the centres of the Eccentric Spheres, tended to allay this
confusion, to connect together those disjointed appearances, and to
introduce harmony and order into the mind's conception of the
movements of those bodies. It did this, however, but imperfectly; it
introduced uniformity and coherence into their real directions. But
their velocities, when surveyed from the only point in which the
velocity of what moves in a Circle can be truly judged of, the centre
of that Circle, still remained, in some measure, inconstant as before;
and still, therefore, embarrassed the imagination. The mind found
itself somewhat relieved from this embarrassment, when it conceived,
that how irregular soever the motions of each of those Circles might
appear, when surveyed from its own centre, there was, however, in
each of them, a point, from whence its revolution would appear per∣fectly
equable and uniform, and such as the imagination could easily
follow. Those philosophers transported themselves, in fancy, to the
centres of these imaginary Circles, and took pleasure in surveying
from thence, all those fantastical motions, arranged, according to that
harmony and order, which it had been the end of all their researches
<PB N="40" REF="133"/>
to bestow upon them. Here, at last, they enjoyed that tranquillity
and repose which they had pursued through all the mazes of this in∣tricate
hypothesis; and here they beheld this, the most beautiful and
magnificent part of the great theatre of nature, so disposed and con∣structed,
that they could attend, with ease and delight, to all the re∣volutions
and changes that occurred in it.</P>
<P>These, the System of Concentric, and that of Eccentric Spheres,
seem to have been the two Systems of Astronomy, that had most cre∣dit
and reputation with that part of the ancient world, who applied
themselves particularly to the study of the heavens. Cleanthes, how∣ever,
and the other philosophers of the Stoical sect who came after
him, appear to have had a system of their own, quite different from
either. But, though justly renowned for their skill in dialectic, and
for the security and sublimity of their moral doctrines, those sages
seem never to have had any high reputation for their knowledge of
the heavens; neither is the name of any one of them ever counted
in the catalogue of the great astronomers, and studious observers of
the Stars, among the ancients. They rejected the doctrine of the
Solid Spheres; and maintained, that the celestial regions were filled
with a fluid ether, of too yielding a nature to carry along with it, by
any motion of its own, bodies so immensely great as the Sun, Moon,
and Five Planets. These, therefore, as well as the Fixed Stars, did
not derive their motion from the circumambient body, but had each
of them, in itself, and peculiar to itself, a vital principle of motion,
which directed it to move with its own peculiar velocity, and its own
peculiar direction. It was by this internal principle, that the Fixed
Stars revolved directly from east to west in circles parallel to the Equa∣tor,
greater or less, according to their distance or nearness to the Poles,
and with velocities so proportioned, that each of them finished its
diurnal period in the same time, in something less than twenty-three
hours and fifty-six minutes. It was, by a principle of the same kind,
<PB N="41" REF="134"/>
that the Sun moved westwards, for they allowed of no eastward mo∣tion
in the heavens, but with less velocity than the Fixed Stars, so as
to finish his diurnal period in twenty-four hours, and, consequently,
to fall every day behind them, by a space of the heavens nearly
equal to that which he passes over in four minutes; that is, nearly
equal to a degree. This revolution of the Sun, too, was neither di∣rectly
westwards, nor exactly circular; but after the Summer Solstice,
his motion began gradually to incline a little southwards, appearing
in his meridian to-day, further south than yesterday; and to-morrow
still further south than to-day; and thus continuing every day
to describe a spiral line round the Earth, which carried him
gradually further and further southwards, till he arrived at the Win∣ter
Solstice. Here, this spiral line began to change its direction, and
to bring him gradually, every day, further and further northwards,
till it again restored him to the Summer Solstice. In the same man∣ner
they accounted for the motion of the Moon, and that of the Five
Planets, by supposing that each of them revolved westwards, but with
directions, and velocities, that were both different from one another,
and continually varying; generally, however, in spherical lines,
somewhat inclined to the Equator.</P>
<P>This system seems never to have had the vogue. The system of
Concentric as well as that of Eccentric Spheres gives some sort of
reason, both for the constancy and equability of the motion of the
Fixed Stars, and for the variety and uncertainty of that of the Pla∣nets.
Each of them bestow some sort of coherence upon those appa∣rently
disjointed phoenomena. But this other system seems to leave
them pretty much as it found them. Ask a Stoic, why all the Fixed
Stars perform their daily revolutions in circles parallel to each other,
though of very different diameters, and with velocities so propor∣tioned,
that they all finish their period at the same time, and through
the whole course of it preserve the same distance and situation with
<PB N="42" REF="135"/>
regard to one another? He can give no other answer, but that the
peculiar nature, or if one may say so, the caprice of each Star directs
it to move in that peculiar manner. His system affords him no prin∣ciple
of connection, by which he can join together, in his imagina∣tion,
so great a number of harmonious revolutions. But either of
the other two systems, by the supposition of the solid firmament,
affords this easily. He is equally at a loss to connect together the
peculiarities that are observed in the motions of the other heavenly
bodies; the spiral motion of them all; their alternate progression from
north to south, and from south to north; the sometimes accelerated,
and again retarded motions of the Sun and Moon; the direct re∣trograde
and stationary appearances of the Planets. All these have,
in his system, no bond of union, but remain as loose and incoherent
in the fancy, as they at first appeared to the senses, before philoso∣phy
had attempted, by giving them a new arrangement, by placing
them at different distances, by assigning to each some peculiar but
regular principle of motion, to methodize and dispose them into an
order that should enable the imagination to pass as smoothly, and
with as little embarrassment, along them, as along the most regular,
familiar, and coherent appearances of nature.</P>
<P>Such were the systems of Astronomy that, in the ancient world,
appear to have been adopted by any considerable party. Of all of
them, the system of Eccentric Spheres was that which corresponded
most exactly with the appearances of the heavens. It was not in∣vented
till after those appearances had been observed, with some ac∣curacy,
for more than a century together; and it was not completely
digested by Ptolemy till the reign of Antoninus, after a much longer
course of observations. We cannot wonder, therefore, that it was
adapted to a much greater number of the phoenomena, than either of
the other two systems, which had been formed before those phoeno∣mena
were observed with any degree of attention, which, there∣fore,
<PB N="43" REF="136"/>
could connect them together only while they were thus re∣garded
in the gross, but which, it could not be expected, should ap∣ply
to them when they came to be considered in the detail. From
the time of Hipparchus, therefore, this system seems to have been
pretty generally received by all those who attended particularly to
the study of the heavens. That astronomer first made a catalogue
of the Fixed Stars; calculated, for six hundred years, the revolutions
of the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets; marked the places in the hea∣vens,
in which, during all that period, each of those bodies should
appear; ascertained the times of the eclipses of the Sun and Moon,
and the particular places of the Earth in which they should be visible.
His calculations were founded upon this system, and as the events
corresponded to his predictions, with a degree of accuracy which,
though inferior to what Astronomy has since arrived at, was greatly
superior to any thing which the world had then known, they as∣certained,
to all astronomers and mathematicians, the preference of
his system, above all those which had been current before it.</P>
<P>It was, however, to astronomers and mathematicians only, that
they ascertained this; for, notwithstanding the evident superiority of
this system, to all those with which the world was then acquainted,
it was never adopted by any one sect of philosophers.</P>
<P>Philosophers, long before the days of Hipparchus, seem to have
abandoned the study of nature, to employ themselves chiefly in
ethical, rhetorical, and dialectical questions. Each party of them
too, had by this time completed their peculiar system or theory of
the universe, and no human consideration could then have induced
them to give up any part of it. That supercilious and ignorant con∣tempt
too, with which at this time they regarded all mathematicians,
among whom they counted astronomers, seems even to have hin∣dered
them from enquiring so far into their doctrines, as to know
<PB N="44" REF="137"/>
what opinions they held. Neither Cicero nor Seneca, who have so
often occasion to mention the ancient systems of Astronomy, take
any notice of that of Hipparchus. His name is not to be found in
the writings of Seneca. It is mentioned but once in those of Cicero,
in a letter to Atticus, but without any note of approbation, as a
geographer, and not as an astronomer. Plutarch, when he counts up,
in his second book, concerning the opinions of philosophers, all the
ancient systems of Astronomy, never mentions this, the only tolera∣ble
one which was known in his time. Those three authors, it
seems, conversed only with the writings of philosophers. The elder
Pliny indeed, a man whose curiosity extended itself equally to every
part of learning, describes the system of Hipparchus, and never men∣tions
its author, which he has occasion to do often, without some note
of that high admiration which he had so justly conceived for his
merit. Such profound ignorance in those professed instructors of
mankind, with regard to so important a part of the learning of their
own times, is so very remarkable, that I thought it deserved to be
taken notice of, even in this short account of the revolutions of
philosophy.</P>
<P>Systems in many respects resemble machines. A machine is a
little system, created to perform, as well as to connect together, in
reality, those different movements and effects which the artist has
occasion for. A system is an imaginary machine invented to connect
together in the fancy those different movements and effects which
are already in reality performed. The machines that are first in∣vented
to perform any particular movement are always the most
complex, and succeeding artists generally discover that, with fewer
wheels, with fewer principles of motion, than had originally been
employed, the same effects may be more easily produced. The first
systems, in the same manner, are always the most complex, and a
particular connecting chain, or principle, is generally thought neces∣sary
<PB N="45" REF="138"/>
to unite every two seemingly disjointed appearances: but it often
happens, that one great connecting principle is afterwards found to
be sufficient to bind together all the discordant phoenomena that oc∣cur
in a whole species of things. How many wheels are necessary to
carry on the movements of this imaginary machine, the system of
Eccentric Spheres! The westward diurnal revolution of the Firma∣ment,
whose rapidity carries all the other heavenly bodies along with
it, requires one. The periodical eastward revolutions of the Sun,
Moon, and Five Planets, require, for each of those bodies, another.
Their differently accelerated and retarded motions require, that those
wheels, or circles, should neither be concentric with the Firmament,
nor with one another; which, more than any thing, seems to dis∣turb
the harmony of the universe. The retrograde and stationary ap∣pearance
of the Five Planets, as well as the extreme inconstancy of
the Moon's motion, require, for each of them, an Epicycle, another
little wheel attached to the circumference of the great wheel, which
still more interrupts the uniformity of the system. The motion of
the apogeum of each of those bodies requires, in each of them, still
another wheel, to carry the centres of their Eccentric Spheres round
the centre of the Earth. And thus, this imaginary machine, though,
perhaps, more simple, and certainly better adapted to the phoenomena
than the Fifty-six Planetary Spheres of Aristotle, was still too intri∣cate
and complex for the imagination to rest in it with complete
tranquillity and satisfaction.</P>
<P>It maintained its authority, however, without any diminution of
reputation, as long as science was at all regarded in the ancient world.
After the reign of Antoninus, and, indeed, after the age of Hippar∣chus,
who lived almost three hundred years before Antoninus, the
great reputation which the earlier philosophers had acquired, so im∣posed
upon the imaginations of mankind, that they seem to have
despaired of ever equalling their renown. All human wisdom, they
<PB N="46" REF="139"/>
supposed, was comprehended in the writings of those elder sages.
To abridge, to explain, and to comment upon them, and thus show
themselves, at least, capable of understanding some of their sublime
mysteries, became now the only probable road to reputation. Pro∣clus
and Theon wrote commentaries upon the System of Ptolemy;
but, to have attempted to invent a new one, would then have been
regarded, not only as presumption, but as impiety to the memory of
their so much revered predecessors.</P>
<P>The ruin of the empire of the Romans, and, along with it, the
subversion of all law and order, which happened a few centuries
afterwards, produced the entire neglect of that study of the connect∣ing
principles of nature, to which leisure and security can alone give
occasion. After the fall of those great conquerors and civilizers of
mankind, the empire of the Califfs seems to have been the first state
under which the world enjoyed that degree of tranquillity which the
cultivation of the sciences requires. It was under the protection of
those generous and magnificent princes, that the ancient philosophy
and astronomy of the Greeks were restored and established in the
East; that tranquillity, which their mild, just, and religious govern∣ment
diffused over their vast empire, revived the curiosity of man∣kind,
to inquire into the connecting principles of nature. The fame
of the Greek and Roman learning, which was then recent in the
memories of men, made them desire to know, concerning these
abstruse subjects, what were the doctrines of the so much renowned
sages of those two nations.</P>
<P>They translated, therefore, into the Arabian language, and studied,
with great eagerness, the works of many Greek philosophers, par∣ticularly
of Aristotle, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen. The su∣periority
which they easily discovered in them, above the rude essays
which their own nation had yet had time to produce, and which were
<PB N="47" REF="140"/>
such, we may suppose, as arise every where in the first infancy of
science, necessarily determined them to embrace their systems, parti∣cularly
that of Astronomy: neither were they ever afterwards able
to throw off their authority. For, though the munificence of the
Abassides, the second race of the Califfs, is said to have supplied the
Arabian astronomers with larger and better instruments, than any that
were known to Ptolemy and Hipparchus, the study of the sciences
seems, in that mighty empire, to have been either of too short, or too
interrupted a continuance, to allow them to make any considerable
correction in the doctrines of those old mathematicians. The ima∣ginations
of mankind had not yet got time to grow so familiar with
the ancient systems, as to regard them without some degree of that
astonishment which their grandeur and novelty excited; a novelty of
a peculiar kind, which had at once the grace of what was new, and
the authority of what was ancient. They were still, therefore, too
much enslaved to those systems, to dare to depart from them, when
those confusions which shook, and at last overturned the peaceful
throne of the Califfs, banished the study of the sciences from that
empire. They had, however, before this, made some considerable
improvements: they had measured the obliquity of the Ecliptic, with
more accuracy than had been done before. The tables of Ptolemy
had, by the length of time, and by the inaccuracy of the observa∣tions
upon which they were founded, become altogether wide of
what was the real situation of the heavenly bodies, as he himself
indeed had foretold they would do. It became necessary, there∣fore,
to form new ones, which was accordingly executed by the
orders of the Califf Almamon, under whom, too, was made the
first mensuration of the Earth that we know of, after the com∣mencement
of the Christian Aera, by two Arabian astronomers,
who, in the plain of Sennaar, measured two degrees of its cir∣cumference.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="141"/>
The victorious arms of the Saracens carried into Spain the learn∣ing,
as well as the gallantry, of the East; and along with it, the tables
of Almamon, and the Arabian translations of Ptolemy and Aristotle;
and thus Europe received a second time, from Babylon, the rudi∣ments
of the science of the heavens. The writings of Ptolemy were
translated from Arabic into Latin; and the Peripatetic philosophy was
studied in Averroes and Avicenna with as much eagerness, and with
as much submission to its doctrines in the West, as it had been in
the East.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the Solid Spheres had, originally, been invented,
in order to give a physical account of the revolutions of the heavenly
bodies, according to the system of Concentric Circles, to which that
doctrine was very easily accommodated. Those mathematicians who
invented the doctrine of Eccentric Circles and Epicycles, contented
themselves with showing, how, by supposing the heavenly bodies to
revolve in such orbits, the phoenomena might be connected together,
and some sort of uniformity and coherence be bestowed upon their
real motions. The physical causes of those motions they left to the
consideration of the philosophers; though, as appears from some
passages of Ptolemy, they had some general apprehension, that they
were to be explained by a like hypothesis. But, though the system
of Hipparchus was adopted by all aftronomers and mathematicians,
it never was received, as we have already observed, by any one sect
of philosophers among the ancients. No attempt, therefore, seems
to have been made amongst them, to accommodate to it any such
hypothesis.</P>
<P>The schoolmen, who received, at once, from the Arabians, the
philosophy of Aristotle, and the astronomy of Hipparchus, were
necessarily obliged to reconcile them to one another, and to connect
<PB N="49" REF="142"/>
together the revolutions of the Eccentric Circles and Epicycles
of the one, by the solid Spheres of the other. Many different at∣tempts
of this kind were made by many different philosophers: but,
of them all, that of Purbach, in the fifteenth century, was the hap∣piest
and the most esteemed. Though his hypothesis is the simplest
of any of them, it would be in vain to describe it without a scheme;
neither is it easily intelligible with one: for, if the system of Eccen∣tric
Circles and Epicycles was before too perplexed and intricate for
the imagination to rest in it, with complete tranquillity and satisfac∣tion,
it became much more so, when this addition had been made to
it. The world, justly indeed, applauded the ingenuity of that phi∣losopher,
who could unite, so happily, two such seemingly incon∣sistent
systems. His labours, however, seem rather to have increased
than to have diminished the causes of that dissatisfaction, which the
learned soon began to feel with the system of Ptolemy. He, as well
as all those who had worked upon the same plan before him, by ren∣dering
this account of things more complex, rendered it still more
embarrassing than it had been before.</P>
<P>Neither was the complexness of this system the sole cause of the
dissatisfaction, which the world in general began, soon after the days
of Purbach, to express for it. The tables of Ptolemy having, upon
account of the inaccuracy of the observations on which they were
founded, become altogether wide of the real situation of the hea∣venly
bodies, those of Almamon, in the ninth century, were, upon
the same hypothesis, composed to correct their deviations. These
again, a few ages afterwards, became, for the same reason, equally
useless. In the thirteenth century, Alphonsus, the philosophical
king of Castile, found it necessary to give orders for the composition
of those tables, which bear his name. It is he, who is so well known
for the whimsical impicty of using to say, that, had he been con∣sulted
at the creation of the universe, he could have given good ad∣vice;
<PB N="50" REF="143"/>
an apophthegm which is supposed to have proceeded from his
dislike to the intricate system of Ptolemy. In the fifteenth century,
the deviation of the Alphonsine tables began to be as sensible, as those
of Ptolemy and Almamon had been before. It appeared evident,
therefore, that, though the system of Ptolemy might, in the main,
be true, certain corrections were necessary to be made in it before it
could be brought to correspond with exact precision to the phoeno∣mena.
For the revolution of his Eccentric Circles and Epicycles,
supposing them to exist, could not, it was evident, be precisely such
as he represented them; since the revolutions of the heavenly bodies
deviated, in a short time, so widely from what the most exact calcu∣lations,
that were founded upon his hypothesis, represented them.
It had plainly, therefore, become necessary to correct, by more ac∣curate
observations, both the velocities and directions of all the wheels
and circles of which his hypothesis is composed. This, accordingly,
was begun by Purbach, and carried on by Regiomontanus, the dis∣ciple,
the continuator, and the perfecter of the system of Purbach;
and one, whose untimely death, amidst innumerable projects for the
recovery of old, and the invention and advancement of new sciences,
is, even at this day, to be regretted.</P>
<P>When you have convinced the world, that an established system,
ought to be corrected, it is not very difficult to persuade them that
it should be destroyed. Not long, therefore, after the death of
Regiomontanus, Copernicus began to meditate a new system, which
should connect together the celestial appearances, in a more simple as
well as a more accurate manner, than that of Ptolemy.</P>
<P>The confusion, in which the old hypothesis represented the mo∣tions
of the heavenly bodies, was, he tells us, what first suggested
to him the design of forming a new system, that these, the noblest
works of nature, might no longer appear devoid of that harmony
and proportion which discover themselves in her meanest produc∣tions.
<PB N="51" REF="144"/>
What most of all dissatisfied him, was, the notion of the
Equalizing Circle, which, by representing the revolutions of the Ce∣lestial
Spheres, as equable only, when surveyed from a point that was
different from their centers, introduced a real inequality into their
motions; contrary to that most natural, and indeed fundamental
idea, with which all the authors of astronomical systems, Plato, Eu∣doxus,
Aristotle, even Hipparchus and Ptolemy themselves, had hi∣therto
set out, that the real motions of such beautiful and divine ob∣jects
must necessarily be perfectly regular, and go on, in a manner,
as agreeable to the imagination, as the objects themselves are to the
senses. He began to consider, therefore, whether, by supposing the
heavenly bodies to be arranged in a different order from that in which
Aristotle and Hipparchus had placed them, this so much sought for
uniformity might not be bestowed upon their motions. To discover
this arrangement, he examined all the obscure traditions delivered
down to us, concerning every other hypothesis which the ancients
had invented, for the same purpose. He found, in Plutarch, that
some old Pythagoreans had represented the Earth as revolving in the
centre of the universe, like a wheel round its own axis; and that
others, of the same sect, had removed it from the centre, and repre∣sented
it as revolving in the Ecliptic like a star round the central fire.
By this central fire, he supposed they meant the Sun; and though
in this he was very widely mistaken, it was, it seems, upon this in∣terpretation,
that he began to consider how such an hypothesis might
be made to correspond to the appearances. The supposed authority
of those old philosophers, if it did not originally suggest to him his
system, seems, at least, to have confirmed him in an opinion, which,
it is not improbable, that he had before-hand other reasons for em∣bracing,
notwithstanding what he himself would affirm to the con∣trary.</P>
<P>It
then occurred to him, that, if the Earth was supposed to revolve
every day round its axis, from west to east, all the heavenly bodies
<PB N="52" REF="145"/>
would appear to revolve, in a contrary direction, from east to west.
The diurnal revolution of the heavens, upon this hypothesis, might
be only apparent; the firmament, which has no other sensible mo∣tion,
might be perfectly at rest; while the Sun, the Moon, and the
Five Planets, might have no other movement beside that eastward re∣volution,
which is peculiar to themselves. That, by supposing the
Earth to revolve with the Planets, round the Sun, in an orbit, which
comprehended within it the orbits of Venus and Mercury, but was
comprehended within those of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, he could,
without the embarrassment of Epicycles, connect together the appa∣rent
annual revolutions of the Sun, and the direct, retrograde, and
stationary appearances of the Planets: that while the Earth really re∣volved
round the Sun on one side of the heavens, the Sun would ap∣pear
to revolve round the Earth on the other; that while she really
advanced in her annual course, he would appear to advance eastward
in that movement which is peculiar to himself. That, by supposing
the axis of the Earth to be always parallel to itself, not to be quite
perpendicular, but somewhat inclined to the plane of her orbit, and
consequently to present to the Sun, the one pole when on the one
side of him, and the other when on the other, he would account
for the obliquity of the Ecliptic; the Sun's seemingly alternate pro∣gression
from north to south, and from south to north, the conse∣quent
change of the seasons, and different lengths of days and nights
in the different seasons.</P>
<P>If this new hypothesis thus connected together all these appear∣ances
as happily as that of Ptolemy, there were others which it con∣nected
together much better. The three superior Planets, when
nearly in conjunction with the Sun, appear always at the greatest
distance from the Earth, are smallest, and least sensible to the eye,
and seem to revolve forward in their direct motion with the greatest
rapidity. On the contrary, when in opposition to the Sun, that is,
when in their meridian about midnight, they appear nearest the
<PB N="53" REF="146"/>
Earth, are largest, and most sensible to the eye, and seem to revolve
backwards in their retrograde motion. To explain these appear∣ances,
the system of Ptolemy supposed each of these Planets to be at
the upper part of their several Epicycles, in the one case; and at the
lower, in the other. But it afforded no satisfactory principle of con∣nection,
which could lead the mind easily to conceive how the Epi∣cycles
of those Planets, whose spheres were so distant from the
sphere of the Sun, should thus, if one may say so, keep time to
his motion. The system of Copernicus afforded this easily, and like
a more simple machine, without the assistance of Epicycles, con∣nected
together, by fewer movements, the complex appearances of
the heavens. When the superior Planets appear nearly in conjunction
with the Sun, they are then in the side of their orbits, which is al∣most
opposite to, and most distant from the Earth, and therefore ap∣pear
smallest, and least sensible to the eye. But, as they then re∣volve
in a direction which is almost contrary to that of the Earth,
they appear to advance forward with double velocity; as a ship, that
fails in a contrary direction to another, appears from, that other, to
sail both with its own velocity, and the velocity of that from which
it is seen. On the contrary, when those Planets are in opposition to
the Sun, they are on the same side of the Sun with the Earth, are
nearest it, most sensible to the eye, and revolve in the same direction
with it; but, as their revolutions round the Sun are flower than that
of the Earth, they are necessarily left behind by it, and therefore
seem to revolve backwards; as a ship which sails slower than ano∣ther,
though it sails in the same direction, appears from that other to
fail backwards. After the same manner, by the same annual revolu∣tion
of the Earth, he connected together the direct and retrograde
motions of the two inferior Planets, as well as the stationary appear∣ances
of all the Five.</P>
<P>There are some other particular phoenomena of the two inferior
Planets, which correspond still better to this system, and still worse
<PB N="54" REF="147"/>
to that of Ptolemy. Venus and Mercury seem to attend constantly
upon the motion of the Sun, appearing, sometimes on the one side,
and sometimes on the other, of that great luminary; Mercury being
almost always buried in his rays, and Venus never receding above
forty-eight degrees from him, contrary to what is observed in the
other three Planets, which are often seen in the opposite side of the
heavens, at the greatest possible distance from the Sun. The system
of Ptolemy accounted for this, by supposing that the centers of the
Epicycles of these two Planets were always in the same line with
those of the Sun and the Earth; that they appeared therefore in con∣junction
with the Sun, when either in the upper or lower part of
their Epicycles, and at the greatest distance from him, when in the
sides of them. It assigned, however, no reason why the Epicycles
of these two Planets should observe so different a rule from that which
takes place in those of the other three, nor for the enormous Epi∣cycle
of Venus, whose sides must have been forty-eight degrees dis∣tant
from the Sun, while its center was in conjunction with him,
and whose diameter must have covered more than a quadrant of the
Great Circle. But how easily all these appearances coincide with the
hypothesis, which represents those two inferior Planets revolving
round the Sun in orbits comprehended within the orbit of the Earth,
is too obvious to require an explanation.</P>
<P>Thus far did this new account of things render the appearances of
the heavens more completely coherent than had been done by any of
the former systems. It did this, too, by a more simple and intelli∣gible,
as well as more beautiful machinery. It represented the Sun,
the great enlightener of the universe, whose body was alone larger
than all the Planets taken together, as established immoveable in the
center, shedding light and heat on all the worlds that circulated
around him in one uniform direction, but in longer or shorter pe∣riods,
according to their different distances. It took away the diur∣nal
revolution of the firmament, whose rapidity, upon the old hy∣pothesis,
<PB N="55" REF="148"/>
was beyond what even thought could conceive. It not only
delivered the imagination from the embarrassment of Epicycles, but
from the difficulty of conceiving these two opposite motions going
on at the same time, which the system of Ptolemy and Aristotle be∣stowed
upon all the Planets; I mean, their diurnal westward, and
periodical eastward revolutions. The Earth's revolution round its
own axis took away the necessity for supposing the first, and the se∣cond
was easily conceived when by itself. The Five Planets, which
seem, upon all other systems, to be objects of a species by them∣selves,
unlike to every thing to which the imagination has been ac∣customed,
when supposed to revolve along with the Earth round
the Sun, were naturally apprehended to be objects of the same
kind with the Earth, habitable, opaque, and enlightened only
by the rays of the Sun. And thus this hypothesis, by classing
them in the same species of things, with an object that is of all
others the most familiar to us, took off that wonder and uncertainty
which the strangeness and singularity of their appearance had ex∣cited;
and thus far, too, better answered the great end of Philo∣sophy.</P>
<P>Neither
did the beauty and simplicity of this system alone recom∣mend
it to the imagination; the novelty and unexpectedness of that
view of nature, which it opened to the fancy, excited more wonder
and surprise than the strangest of those appearances, which it had
been invented to render natural and familiar, and these sentiments
still more endeared it. For, though it is the end of Philosophy, to
allay that wonder, which either the unusual or seemingly disjointed
appearances of nature excite, yet she never triumphs so much, as
when, in order to connect together a few, in themselves, perhaps,
inconsiderable objects, she has, if I may say so, created another con∣stitution
of things, more natural indeed, and such as the imagination
can more easily attend to, but more new, more contrary to common
<PB N="56" REF="149"/>
opinion and expectation, than any of those appearances themselves.
As, in the instance before us, in order to connect together some
seeming irregularities in the motions of the Planets, the most incon∣siderable
objects in the heavens, and of which the greater part of
mankind have no occasion to take any notice during the whole course
of their lives, she has, to talk in the hyperbolical language of Tycho-Brache,
moved the Earth from its foundations, stopt the revolution of
the Firmament, made the Sun stand still, and subverted the whole
order of the Universe.</P>
<P>Such were the advantages of this new hypothesis, as they ap∣peared
to its author, when he first invented it. But, though that
love of paradox, so natural to the learned, and that pleasure, which
they are so apt to take in exciting, by the novelty of their supposed
discoveries, the amazement of mankind, may, notwithstanding what
one of his disciples tells us to the contrary, have had its weight in
prompting Copernicus to adopt this system; yet, when he had com∣pleted
his Treatise of Revolutions, and began coolly to consider what
a strange doctrine he was about to offer to the world, he so much
dreaded the prejudice of mankind against it, that, by a species of
continence, of all others the most difficult to a philosopher, he de∣tained
it in his closet for thirty years together. At last, in the ex∣tremity
of old age, he allowed it to be extorted from him, but died
as soon as it was printed, and before it was published.</P>
<P>When it appeared in the world, it was almost universally disap∣proved
of, by the learned as well as by the ignorant. The natural
prejudices of sense, confirmed by education, prevailed too much with
both, to allow them to give it a fair examination. A few disciples
only, whom he himself had instructed in his doctrine, received it
with esteem and admiration. One of them, Reinholdus, formed,
upon this hypothesis, larger and more accurate astronomical tables,
<PB N="57" REF="150"/>
than what accompanied the Treatise of Revolutions, in which Co∣pernicus
had been guilty of some errors in calculation. It soon ap∣peared,
that these Prutenic Tables, as they were called, corresponded
more exactly with the heavens, than the Tables of Alphonsus. This
ought naturally to have formed a prejudice in favour of the diligence
and accuracy of Copernicus in observing the heavens. But it ought
to have formed none in favour of his hypothesis; since the same ob∣servations,
and the result of the same calculations, might have been
accommodated to the system of Ptolemy, without making any greater
alteration in that system than what Ptolemy had foreseen, and had
even foretold should be made. It formed, however, a prejudice in
favour of both, and the learned began to examine, with some atten∣tion,
an hypothesis which afforded the easiest methods of calcula∣tion,
and upon which the most exact predictions had been made.
The superior degree of coherence, which it bestowed upon the ce∣lestial
appearances, the simplicity and uniformity which it introduced
into the real directions and velocities of the Planets, soon disposed
many astronomers, first to favour, and at last to embrace a system,
which thus connected together so happily, the most disjointed of
those objects that chiefly occupied their thoughts. Nor can any
thing more evidently demonstrate, how easily the learned give up
the evidence of their senses to preserve the coherence of the ideas of
their imagination, than the readiness with which this, the most vio∣lent
paradox in all philosophy, was adopted by many ingenious astro∣nomers,
notwithstanding its inconsistency with every sistem of phy∣sics
then known in the world, and notwithstanding the great number
of other more real objections, to which, as Copernicus left it, this
account of things was most justly exposed.</P>
<P>It was adopted, however, nor can this be wondered at, by astro∣nomers
only. The learned in all other sciences, continued to regard
it with the same contempt as the vulgar. Even astronomers were di∣vided
<PB N="58" REF="151"/>
about its merit; and many of them rejected a doctrine, which
not only contradicted the established system of Natural Philosophy,
but which, considered astronomically only, seemed to labour under
several difficulties.</P>
<P>Some of the objections against the motion of the Earth, that were
drawn from the prejudices of sense, the patrons of this system, in∣deed,
easily enough, got over. They represented, that the Earth
might really be in motion, though, to its inhabitants, it seemed to be
at rest; and that the Sun, and Fixed Stars, might really be at rest,
though from the Earth they seemed to be in motion; in the same
manner as a ship, which sails through a smooth sea, seems to those
who are in it, to be at rest, though really in motion; while the ob∣jects
which she passes along, seem to be in motion, though really at
rest.</P>
<P>But there were some other objections, which, though grounded
upon the same natural prejudices, they found it more difficult to get
over. The Earth had always presented itself to the senses, not only
as at rest, but as inert, ponderous, and even averse to motion. The
imagination had always been accustomed to conceive it as such, and
suffered the greatest violence, when obliged to pursue, and attend it,
in that rapid motion which the system of Copernicus bestowed upon
it. To enforce their objection, the adversaries of this hypothesis were
at pains to calculate the extreme rapidity of this motion. They re∣presented,
that the circumference of the Earth had been computed
to be above twenty-three thousand miles: if the Earth, therefore, was
supposed to revolve every day round its axis, every point of it near
the equator would pass over above twenty-three thousand miles in a
day; and consequently, near a thousand miles in an hour, and about
sixteen miles in a minute; a motion more rapid than that of a can∣non
ball, or even than the swifter progress of sound. The rapi∣pidity
<PB N="59" REF="152"/>
of its periodical revolution was yet more violent than that of
its diurnal rotation. How, therefore, could the imagination ever
conceive so ponderous a body to be naturally endowed with so dread∣ful
a movement? The Peripatetic Philosophy, the only philosophy
then known in the world, still further confirmed this prejudice.
That philosophy, by a very natural, though, perhaps, groundless
distinction, divided all motion into Natural and Violent. Natural mo∣tion
was that which flowed from an innate tendency in the body, as
when a stone fell downwards: Violent motion, that which arose from
external force, and which was, in some measure, contrary to the na∣tural
tendency of the body, as when a stone was thrown upwards,
or horizontally. No violent motion could be lasting; for, being con∣stantly
weakened by the natural tendency of the body, it would soon
be destroyed. The natural motion of the Earth, as was evident in
all its parts, was downwards, in a strait line to the center; as that of
fire and air was upwards, in a strait line from the center. It was the
heavens only that revolved naturally in a circle. Neither, therefore,
the supposed revolution of the Earth round its own center, nor that
round the Sun, could be natural motions; they must therefore be
violent, and consequently could be of no long continuance. It was
in vain that Copernicus replied, that gravity was, probably, nothing
else besides a tendency in the different parts of the same Planet, to
unite themselves to one another; that this tendency took place, pro∣bably,
in the parts of the other Planets, as well as in those of the
Earth; that it could very well be united with a circular motion; that
it might be equally natural to the whole body of the Planet, and to
every part of it; that his adversaries themselves allowed, that a cir∣cular
motion was natural to the heavens, whose diurnal revolution
was infinitely more rapid than even that motion which he had be∣stowed
upon the Earth; that though a like motion was natural to the
Earth, it would still appear to be at rest to its inhabitants, and all the
parts of it to tend in a strait line to the center, in the same manner
<PB N="60" REF="153"/>
as at present. But this answer, how satisfactory soever it may ap∣pear
to be now, neither did nor could appear to be satisfactory then.
By admitting the distinction betwixt natural and violent motions, it
was founded upon the same ignorance of mechanical principles with
the objection. The systems of Aristotle and Hipparchus supposed,
indeed, the diurnal motion of the heavenly bodies to be infinitely
more rapid than even that dreadful movement which Copernicus be∣stowed
upon the Earth. But they supposed, at the same time, that those
bodies were objects of a quite different species, from any we are ac∣quainted
with, near the surface of the Earth, and to which, therefore,
it was less difficult to conceive that any sort of motion might be na∣tural.
Those objects, besides, had never presented themselves to the
senses, as moving otherwise, or with less rapidity, than these systems
represented them. The imagination, therefore, could feel no diffi∣culty
in following a representation which the senses had rendered quite
familiar to it. But when the Planets came to be regarded as so many
Earths, the case was quite altered. The imagination had been ac∣customed
to conceive such objects as tending rather to rest than mo∣tion;
and this idea of their natural inertness, encumbered, if one
may say so, and clogged its flight, whenever it endeavoured to pursue
them in their periodical courses, and to conceive them as continually
rushing through the celestial spaces, with such violent and unremit∣ting
rapidity.</P>
<P>Nor were the first followers of Copernicus more fortunate in their
answers to some other objections, which were founded indeed in the
same ignorance of the laws of motion, but which, at the same time,
were necessarily connected with that way of conceiving things, which
then prevailed universally in the learned world.</P>
<P>If the Earth, it was said, revolved so rapidly from west to east, a
perpetual wind would set in from east to west, more violent than what
<PB N="61" REF="154"/>
blows in the greatest hurricanes; a stone, thrown westwards, would
fly to a much greater distance than one thrown with the same force
eastwards; as what moved in a direction, contrary to the motion of
the Earth, would necessarily pass over a greater portion of its sur∣face,
than what, with the same velocity, moved along with it. A
ball, it was said, dropt from the mast of a ship under sail, does not
fall precisely at the foot of the mast, but behind it; and in the same
manner, a stone dropt from a high tower would not, upon the sup∣position
of the Earth's motion, fall precisely at the bottom of the
tower, but west of it, the Earth being, in the mean time, carried
away eastward from below it. It is amusing to observe, by what
subtile and metaphysical evasions the followers of Copernicus endea∣voured
to elude this objection, which, before the doctrine of the
Composition of Motion had been explained by Galileo, was altoge∣ther
unanswerable. They allowed, that a ball dropt from the mast
of a ship under sail would not fall at the foot of the mast, but behind
it; because the ball, they said, was no part of the ship, and because
the motion of the ship was natural neither to itself nor to the ball.
But the stone was a part of the earth, and the diurnal and annual
revolutions of the Earth were natural to the whole, and to every
part of it, and therefore to the stone. The stone, therefore, having
naturally the same motion with the Earth, fell precisely at the bottom
of the tower. But this answer could not satisfy the imagination,
which still found it difficult to conceive how these motions could be
natural to the Earth; or how a body, which had always presented
itself to the senses as inert, ponderous, and averse to motion, should
naturally be continually wheeling about both its own axis and the
Sun, with such violent rapidity. It was, besides, argued by Tycho
Brache, upon the principles of the same philosophy, which had
afforded both the objection and the answer, that even upon the sup∣position,
that any such motion was natural to the whole body of the
Earth, yet the stone, which was separated from it, could no longer
<PB N="62" REF="155"/>
be actuated by that motion. The limb, which is cut off from an
animal, loses those animal motions which were natural to the whole.
The branch, which is cut off from the trunk, loses that vegetative mo∣tion
which is natural to the whole tree. Even the metals, minerals,
and stones, which are dug out from the bosom of the Earth, lose
those motions which occasioned their production and encrease, and
which were natural to them in their original state. Though the diurnal
and annual motion of the Earth, therefore, had been natural to them
while they were contained in its bosom; it could no longer be so
when they were separated from it.</P>
<P>Tycho Brache, the great restorer of the science of the heavens,
who had spent his life, and wasted his fortune upon the advancement
of Astronomy, whose observations were both more numerous and
more accurate than those of all the atronomers who had gone before
him, was himself so much affected by the force of this objection,
that, though he never mentioned the system of Copernicus without
some note of the high admiration he had conceived for its author,
he could never himself be induced to embrace it: yet all his astrono∣mical
observations tended to confirm it. They demonstrated, that
Venus and Mercury were sometimes above, and sometimes below the
Sun; and that, consequently, the Sun, and not the Earth, was the
center of their periodical revolutions. They showed, that Mars,
when in his meridian at midnight, was nearer to the Earth than the
Earth is to the Sun; though, when in conjunction with the Sun, he
was much more remote from the Earth than that luminary; a disco∣very
which was absolutely inconsistent with the system of Ptolemy,
which proved, that the Sun, and not the Earth, was the center of the
periodical revolutions of Mars, as well as of Venus and Mercury;
and which demonstrated, that the Earth was placed betwixt the orbits
of Mars and Venus. They made the same thing probable with re∣gard
to Jupiter and Saturn; that they, too, revolved round the Sun;
<PB N="63" REF="156"/>
and that, therefore, the Sun, if not the center of the universe, was at
least, that of the planetary system. They proved, that Comets were
superior to the Moon, and moved through the heavens in all possible
directions; an observation incompatible with the Solid Spheres of
Aristotle and Purbach, and which, therefore, overturned the physical
part, at least, of the established Astronomy.</P>
<P>All these observations, joined to his aversion to the system, and
perhaps, notwithstanding the generosity of his character, some little
jealousy of the fame of Copernicus, suggested to Tycho the idea of
a new hypothesis, in which the Earth continued to be, as in the old
account, the immoveable center of the universe, round which the
firmament revolved every day from east to west, and, by some secret
virtue, carried the Sun, the Moon, and the Five Planets along with
it, notwithstanding their immense distance, and notwithstanding that
there was nothing betwixt it and them but the most fluid ether.
But, although all these seven bodies thus obeyed the diurnal revolu∣tion
of the Firmament, they had each of them, as in the old system,
too, a contrary periodical eastward revolution of their own, which
made them appear to be every day, more or less, left behind by the
Firmament. The Sun was the center of the periodical revolutions of
the Five Planets; the Earth, that of the Sun and Moon. The Five
Planets followed the Sun in his periodical revolution round the Earth,
as they did the Firmament in its diurnal rotation. The three supe∣rior
Planets comprehended the Earth within the orbit in which they
revolved round the Sun, and had each of them an Epicycle to con∣nect
together, in the same manner as in the system of Ptolemy, their
direct, retrograde, and stationary appearances. As, notwithstanding
their immense distance, they followed the Sun in his periodical re∣volution
round the Earth, keeping always at an equal distance from
him, they were necessarily brought much nearer to the Earth when
in opposition to the Sun, than when in conjunction with him. Mars,
<PB N="64" REF="157"/>
the nearest of them, when in his meridian at midnight, came within
the orbit which the Sun described round the Earth, and consequently
was then nearer to the Earth than the Earth was to the Sun. The
appearances of the two inferior Planets were explained, in the same
manner, as in the system of Copernicus, and consequently required
no Epicycle to connect them. The circles in which the Five Planets
performed their periodical revolutions round the Sun, as well as those
in which the Sun and Moon performed theirs round the Earth, were,
as both in the old and new hypothesis, Eccentric Circles, to connect
together their differently accelerated and retarded motions.</P>
<P>Such was the system of Tycho Brache, compounded, as is evi∣dent,
out of these of Ptolemy and Copernicus; happier than that of
Ptolemy, in the account which it gives of the motions of the two
inferior Planets; more complex, by supposing the different revolu∣tions
of all the Five to be performed round two different centers; the
diurnal round the Earth, the periodical round the Sun; but, in every
respect, more complex and more incoherent than that of Copernicus.
Such, however, was the difficulty that mankind felt in conceiving
the motion of the Earth, that it long balanced the reputation of that
otherwise more beautiful system. It may be said, that those who
considered the heavens only, favoured the system of Copernicus,
which connected so happily all the appearances which presented
themselves there. But that those who looked upon the Earth,
adopted the account of Tycho Brache, which, leaving it at rest in
the center of the universe, did less violence to the usual habits of the
imagination. The learned were, indeed, sensible of the intricacy,
and of the many incoherences of that system; that it gave no ac∣count
why the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, should follow the re∣volution
of the Firmament; or why the Five Planets, notwithstand∣ing
the immense distance of the three superior ones, should obey the
periodical motion of the Sun; or why the Earth, though placed be∣tween
<PB N="65" REF="158"/>
the orbits of Mars and Venus, should remain immoveable in
the center of the Firmament, and constantly resist the influence of
whatever it was, which carried bodies that were so much larger than
itself, and that were placed on all sides of it, periodically round the
Sun. Tycho Brahe died before he had fully explained his system.
His great and merited renown disposed many of the learned to be∣lieve,
that, had his life been longer, he would have connected toge∣ther
many of these incoherences, and knew methods of adapting his
system to some other appearances, with which none of his followers
could connect it.</P>
<P>The objection to the system of Copernicus, which was drawn
from the nature of motion, and that was most insisted on by Tycho
Brahe, was at last fully answered by Galileo; not, however, till
about thirty years after the death of Tycho, and about a hundred
after that of Copernicus. It was then that Galileo, by explaining
the nature of the composition of motion, by showing, both from
reason and experience, that a ball dropt from the mast of a ship
under sail would fall precisely at the foot of the mast, and by ren∣dering
this doctrine, from a great number of other instances, quite
familiar to the imagination, took off, perhaps, the principal objection
which had been made to this hypothesis.</P>
<P>Several other astronomical difficulties, which encumbered this ac∣count
of things, were removed by the same philosopher. Coperni∣cus,
after altering the center of the world, and making the Earth,
and all the Planets revolve round the Sun, was obliged to leave the
Moon to revolve round the Earth as before. But no example of any
such secondary Planet having then been discovered in the heavens,
there seemed still to be this irregularity remaining in the system.
Galileo, who first applied telescopes to Astronomy, discovered, by
their assistance, the Satellites of Jupiter, which, revolving round
<PB N="66" REF="159"/>
that Planet, at the same time that they were carried along with it in
its revolution, round either the Earth, or the Sun, made it seem less
contrary to the analogy of nature, that the Moon should both re∣volve
round the Earth, and accompany her in her revolution round
the Sun.</P>
<P>It had been objected to Copernicus, that, if Venus and Mercury
revolved round the Sun, in an orbit comprehended within the orbit
of the Earth, they would show all the same phases with the Moon,
present, sometimes their darkened, and sometimes their enlightened
sides to the Earth, and sometimes part of the one, and part of the
other. He answered, that they undoubtedly did all this; but that
their smallness and distance hindered us from perceiving it. This
very bold assertion of Copernicus was confirmed by Galileo. His
telescopes rendered the phases of Venus quite sensible, and thus de∣monstrated,
more evidently than had been done, even by the obser∣vations
of Tycho Brahe, the revolutions of these two Planets round
the Sun, as well as so far destroyed the system of Ptolemy.</P>
<P>The mountains and seas, which, by the help of the same instru∣ment,
he discovered, or imagined he had discovered in the Moon,
rendering that Planet, in every respect, similar to the Earth, made it
seem less contrary to the analogy of nature, that, as the Moon
revolved round the Earth, the Earth should revolve round the
Sun.</P>
<P>The spots which, in the same manner, he discovered in the Sun,
demonstrating, by their motion, the revolution of the Sun round his
axis, made it seem less improbable that the Earth, a body so much
smaller than the Sun, should revolve round her axis in the same
manner.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="160"/>
Succeeding telescopical observations, discovered, in each of the
Five Planets, spots not unlike those which Galileo had observed in
the Moon, and thereby seemed to demonstrate what Copernicus had
only conjectured, that the Planets were naturally opaque, enlightened
only by the rays of the Sun, habitable, diversified by seas and moun∣tains,
and, in every respect, bodies of the same kind with the Earth;
and thus added one other probability to this system. By discovering,
too, that each of the Planets revolved round its own axis, at the
same time that it was carried round either the Earth or the Sun, they
made it seem quite agreeable to the analogy of nature, that the Earth,
which, in every other respect, resembled the Planets, should, like
them too, revolve round its own axis, and at the same time perform
its periodical motion round the Sun.</P>
<P>While, in Italy, the unfortunate Galileo was adding so many pro∣babilities
to the system of Copernicus, there was another philosopher
employing himself in Germany, to ascertain, correct, and improve it:
Kepler, with great genius, but without the taste, or the order and me∣thod
of Galileo, possessed, like all his other countrymen, the most labo∣rious
industry, joined to that passion for discovering proportions and re∣semblances
betwixt the different parts of nature, which, though com∣mon
to all philosophers, seems, in him, to have been excessive. He
had been instructed, by Maestlinus, in the system of Copernicus;
and his first curiosity was, as he tells us, to find out, why the Pla∣nets,
the Earth being counted for one, were Six in number; why
they were placed at such irregular distances from the Sun; and whe∣ther
there was any uniform proportion betwixt their several distances,
and the times employed in their periodical revolutions. Till some
reason, or proportion of this kind, could be discovered, the system did
not appear to him to be completely coherent. He endeavoured, first,
to find it in the proportions of numbers, and plain figures; after∣wards,
in those of the regular solids; and, last of all, in those of the
<PB N="68" REF="161"/>
musical divisions of the Octave. Whatever was the science which
Kepler was studying, he seems constantly to have pleased himself
with finding some analogy betwixt it and the system of the universe;
and thus, arithmetic and music, plain and solid geometry, came all
of them by turns to illustrate the doctrine of the Sphere, in the ex∣plaining
of which he was, by his profession, principally employed.
Tycho Brahe, to whom he had presented one of his books, though
he could not but disapprove of his system, was pleased, however,
with his genius, and with his indefatigable diligence in making the
most laborious calculations. That generous and magnificent Dane
invited the obscure and indigent Kepler to come and live with him,
and communicated to him, as soon as he arrived, his observations
upon Mars, in the arranging and methodizing of which his dis∣ciples
were at that time employed. Kepler, upon comparing them
with one another, found, that the orbit of Mars was not a perfect
circle; that one of its diameters was somewhat longer than the
other; and that it approached to an oval, or an ellipse, which had
the Sun placed in one of its foci. He found, too, that the motion
of the Planet was not equable; that it was swiftest when nearest the
Sun, and slowest when furthest from him; and that its velocity gra∣dually
encreased, or diminished, according as it approached or re∣ceded
from him. The observations of the same astronomer disco∣vered
to him, though not so evidently, that the same things were
true of all the other Planets; that their orbits were elliptical, and that
their motions were swiftest when nearest the Sun, and slowest when
furthest from him. They showed the same things, too, of the Sun,
if supposed to revolve round the Earth; and consequently of the
Earth, if supposed to revolve round the Sun.</P>
<P>That the motions of all the heavenly bodies were perfectly circu∣lar,
had been the fundamental idea, upon which every astronomical
hypothesis, except the irregular one of the Stoics, had been built.
<PB N="69" REF="162"/>
A circle, as the degree of its curvature is every where the same, is
of all curve lines the simplest and the most easily conceived. Since
it was evident, therefore, that the heavenly bodies did not move in
strait lines, the indolent imagination found, that it could most ea∣sily
attend to their motions if they were supposed to revolve in per∣fect
circles. It had, upon this account, determined that a circular
motion was the most perfect of all motions, and that none but the
most perfect motion could be worthy of such beautiful and divine
objects; and it had upon this account, so often, in vain, endeavoured
to adjust to the appearances, so many different systems, which all
supposed them to revolve in this manner.</P>
<P>The equality of their motions was another fundamental idea,
which, in the same manner, and for the same reason, was supposed
by all the founders of astronomical systems. For an equal motion
can be more easily attended to, than one that is continually either ac∣celerated
or retarded. All inconstancy, therefore, was declared to
be unworthy those bodies which revolved in the celestial regions,
and to be fit only for inferior and sublunary things. The calcula∣tions
of Kepler overturned, with regard to the Planets, both these na∣tural
prejudices of the imagination; destroyed their circular orbits;
and introduced into their real motions, such an inequality as no equali∣zing
circle would remedy. It was, however, to render their mo∣tions
perfectly equable, without even the assistance of an equalizing
circle, that Copernicus, as he himself assures us, had originally in∣vented
his system. Since the calculations of Kepler, therefore, over∣turned
what Copernicus had principally in view in establishing his
system, we cannot wonder that they should at first seem rather to em∣barrass
than improve it.</P>
<P>It is true, by these elliptical orbits and unequal motions, Kepler
disengaged the system from the embarrassment of those small Epi∣cycles,
<PB N="70" REF="163"/>
which Copernicus, in order to connect the seemingly accele∣rated
and retarded movements of the Planets with their supposed real
equality, had been obliged to leave in it. For it is remarkable, that
though Copernicus had delivered the orbits of the Planets from the
enormous Epicycles of Hipparchus, that though in this consisted the
great superiority of his system above that of the ancient astronomers,
he was yet obliged, himself, to abandon, in some measure, this ad∣vantage,
and to make use of some small Epicycles, to join together
those seeming irregularities. His Epicycles indeed, like the irregu∣larities
for whose sake they were introduced, were but small ones,
and the imaginations of his first followers seem, accordingly, either to
have slurred them over altogether, or scarcely to have observed them.
Neither Galileo, nor Gassendi, the two most eloquent of his defend∣ers,
take any notice of them. Nor does it seem to have been ge∣nerally
attended to, that there was any such thing as Epicycles in the
system of Copernicus, till Kepler, in order to vindicate his own el∣liptical
orbits, insisted, that even, according to Copernicus, the body
of the Planet was to be found but at two different places in the cir∣cumference
of that circle which the center of its Epicycle de∣scribed.</P>
<P>It
is true, too, that an ellipse is, of all curve lines after a circle,
the simplest and most easily conceived; and it is true, besides all this,
that, while Kepler took from the motion of the Planets the easiest of all
proportions, that of equality, he did not leave them absolutely with∣out
one, but ascertained the rule by which their velocities continually
varied; for a genius so fond of analogies, when he had taken away
one, would be sure to substitute another in its room. Notwith∣standing
all this, notwithstanding that his system was better sup∣ported
by observations than any system had ever been before, yet,
such was the attachment to the equal motions and circular orbits of
the Planets, that it seems, for some time, to have been in general but
<PB N="71" REF="164"/>
little attended to by the learned, to have been altogether neglected
by philosophers, and not much regarded even by astronomers.</P>
<P>Gassendi, who began to sigure in the world about the latter days of
Kepler, and who was himself no mean astronomer, seems indeed to
have conceived a good deal of esteem for his diligence and accuracy
in accommodating the observations of Tycho Brahe to the system of
Copernicus. But Gassendi appears to have had no comprehension of
the importance of those alterations which Kepler had made in that
system, as is evident from his scarcely ever mentioning them in the
whole course of his voluminous writings upon Astronomy. Des
Cartes, the cotemporary and rival of Gassendi, seems to have paid
no attention to them at all, but to have built his Theory of the
Heavens, without any regard to them. Even those astronomers,
whom a serious attention had convinced of the justness of his cor∣rections,
were still so enamoured with the circular orbits and equal
motions, that they endeavoured to compound his system with those
ancient, but natural prejudices. Thus, Ward endeavoured to show
that, though the Planets moved in elliptical orbits, which had the
Sun in one of their foci, and though their velocities in the elliptical
line were continually varying, yet, if a ray was supposed to be ex∣tended
from the center of any one of them to the other focus, and to be
carried along by the periodical motion of the Planet, it would make
equal angles in equal times, and consequently cut off equal portions
of the circle of which that other focus was the center. To one,
therefore, placed in that focus, the motion of the Planet would ap∣pear
to be perfectly circular and perfectly equable, in the same man∣ner
as in the Equalizing Circles of Ptolemy and Hipparchus. Thus
Bouillaud, who censured this hypothesis of Ward, invented another
of the same kind, infinitely more whimsical and capricious. The
Planets, according to that astronomer, always revolve in circles; for
that being the most perfect figure, it is impossible they should revolve
<PB N="72" REF="165"/>
in any other. No one of them, however, continues to move in any
one circle, but is perpetually passing from, one to another, through an
infinite number of circles, in the course of each revolution; for an
ellipse, said he, is an oblique section of a cone, and in a cone, be∣twixt
the two vortices of the ellipse there is an infinite number of
circles, out of the infinitely small portions of which the elliptical line
is compounded. The Planer, therefore, which moves in this line, is,
in every point of it, moving in an infinitely small portion of a cer∣tain
circle. The motion of each Planet, too, according to him,
was necessarily, for the same reason, perfectly equable. An equable
motion being the most perfect of all motions. It was not, however,
in the elliptical line, that it was equable, but in any one of the cir∣cles
that were parallel to the base of that cone, by whose section this
elliptical line had been formed: for, if a ray was extended from the
Planet to any one of those circles, and carried along by its periodical
motion, it would cut off equal portions of that circle in equal times;
another most fantastical equalizing circle, supported by no other
foundation besides the frivolous connection betwixt a cone and an
ellipse, and recommended by nothing but the natural passion for cir∣cular
orbits and equable motions. It may be regarded as the last ef∣fort
of this passion, and many serve to show the force of that prin∣ciple
which could thus oblige this accurate observer, and great im∣prover
of the Theory of the Heavens, to adopt so strange an hypo∣thesis.
Such was the difficulty and hesitation with which the fol∣lowers
of Copernicus adopted the corrections of Kepler.</P>
<P>The rule, indeed, which Kepler ascertained for determining the
gradual acceleration or retardation in the movement of the Planets,
was intricate, and difficult to be comprehended; it could therefore
but little facilitate the progress of the imagination in tracing those
revolutions which were supposed to be conducted by it. According
to that astronomer, if a strait line was drawn from the center of
<PB N="73" REF="166"/>
each Planet to the Sun, and carried along by the periodical motion
of the Planet, it would describe equal areas in equal times, though
the Planet did not pass over equal spaces; and the same rule, he
found, took place nearly with regard to the Moon. The imagina∣tion,
when acquainted with the law by which any motion is accele∣rated
or retarded, can follow and attend to it more easily, than when
at a loss, and, as it were, wandering in uncertainty with regard to
the proportion which regulates its varieties; the discovery of this
analogy therefore, no doubt, rendered the system of Kepler more
agreeable to the natural taste of mankind: it was, however, an ana∣logy
too difficult to be followed, or comprehended, to render it com∣pletely
so.</P>
<P>Kepler, besides this, introduced another new analogy into the sys∣tem,
and first discovered, that there was one uniform relation ob∣served
betwixt the distances of the Planets from the Sun, and the
times employed in their periodical motions. He found, that their
periodical times were greater than in proportion to their distances,
and less than in proportion to the squares of those distances; but,
that they were nearly as the mean proportionals betwixt their dis∣tances
and the squares of their distances; or, in other words, that
the squares of their periodical times were nearly as the cubes of
their distances; an analogy, which, though, like all others, it no
doubt rendered the system somewhat more distinct and comprehen∣sible,
was, however, as well as the former, of too intricate a nature
to facilitate very much the effort of the imagination in conceiv∣ing
it.</P>
<P>The truth of both these analogies, intricate as they were, was at
last fully established by the observations of Cassini. That astronomer
first discovered, that the secondary Planets of Jupiter and Saturn re∣volved
round their primary ones, according to the same laws which
<PB N="74" REF="167"/>
Kepler had observed in the revolutions of the primary ones round
the Sun, and that of the Moon round the earth; that each of them
described equal areas in equal times, and that the squares of their
periodic times were as the cubes of their distances. When these
two last abstruse analogies, which, when Kepler at first observed
them, were but little regarded, had been thus found to take place in
the revolutions of the Four Satellites of Jupiter, and in those of the
Five of Saturn, they were now thought not only to confirm the
doctrine of Kepler, but to add a new probability to the Copernican
hypothesis. The observations of Cassini seem to establish it as a law
of the system, that, when one body revolved round another, it de∣scribed
equal areas in equal times; and that, when several revolved
round the same body, the squares of their periodic times were as
the cubes of their distances. If the Earth and the Five Planets were
supposed to revolve round the Sun, these laws, it was said, would
take place universally. But if, according to the system of Ptolemy,
the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets were supposed to revolve round
the Earth, the periodical motions of the Sun and Moon would, in∣deed,
observe the first of these laws, would each of them describe
equal areas in equal times; but they would not observe the second,
the squares of their periodic times would not be as the cubes of their
distances: and the revolutions of the Five Planets would observe
neither the one law nor the other. Or if, according to the system
of Tycho Brahe, the Five Planets were supposed to revolve round
the Sun, while the Sun and Moon revolved round the Earth, the re∣volutions
of the Five Planets round the Sun, would, indeed, observe
both these laws; but those of the Sun and Moon round the Earth
would observe only the first of them. The analogy of nature,
therefore, could be preserved completely, according to no other sys∣tem
but that of Copernicus, which, upon that account, must be the
true one. This argument is regarded by Voltaire, and the Cardinal
of Polignac, as an irrefragable demonstration; even M' Laurin, who
<PB N="75" REF="168"/>
was more capable of judging; nay, Newton himself, seems to men∣tion
it as one of the principal evidences for the truth of that hypo∣thesis.
Yet, an analogy of this kind, it would seem, far from a
demonstration, could afford, at most, but the shadow of a proba∣bility.</P>
<P>It
is true, that though Cassini supposed the Planets to revolve in
an oblong curve, it was in a curve somewhat different from that of
Kepler. In the ellipse the sum of the two lines, which are drawn
from any one point in the circumference to the two foci, is always
equal to that of those which are drawn from any other point in the
circumference to the same foci. In the curve of Cassini, it is not
the sum of the lines, but the rectangles which are contained under
the lines, that are always equal. As this, however, was a proportion
more difficult to be comprehended than the other, the curve of
Cassini has never had the vogue.</P>
<P>Nothing now embarrassed the system of Corpernicus, but the dif∣ficulty
which the imagination felt in conceiving bodies so immensely
ponderous as the Earth, and the other Planets, revolving round the
Sun with such incredible rapidity. It was in vain that Copernicus
pretended, that, notwithstanding the prejudices of sense, this circu∣lar
motion might be as natural to the Planets, as it is to a stone to fall
to the ground. The imagination had been accustomed to conceive
such objects as tending rather to rest than motion. This habitual
idea of their natural inertness was incompatible with that of their
natural motion. It was in vain that Kepler, in order to assist the
fancy in connecting together this natural inertness with their asto∣nishing
velocities, talked of some vital and immaterial virtue, which
was shed by the Sun into the surrounding spaces, which was
whirled about with his revolution round his own axis, and which,
taking hold of the Planets, forced them, in spite of their ponde∣rousness
<PB N="76" REF="169"/>
and strong propensity to rest, thus to whirl about the center
of the system. The imagination had no hold of this immaterial vir∣tue,
and could form no determinate idea of what it consisted in.
The imagination, indeed, felt a gap, or interval, betwixt the constant
motion and the supposed inertness of the Planets, and had in this,
as in all other cases, some general idea or apprehension that there must
be a connecting chain of intermediate objects to link together these
discordant qualities. Wherein this connecting chain consisted, it was,
indeed, at a loss to conceive; nor did the doctrine of Kepler lend it
any assistance in this respect. That doctrine, like almost all those of
the philosophy in fashion during his time, bestowed a name upon
this invisible chain, called it an immaterial virtue, but afforded no
determinate idea of what was its nature.</P>
<P>Des Cartes was the first who attempted to ascertain, precisely,
wherein this invisible chain consisted, and to afford the imagination
a train of intermediate events, which, succeeding each other in an
order that was of all others the most familiar to it, should unite those
incoherent qualities, the rapid motion, and the natural inertness of
the Planets. Des Cartes was the first who explained wherein con∣sisted
the real inertness of matter; that it was not in an aversion to
motion, or in a propensity to rest, but in a power of continuing in∣differently
either at rest or in motion, and of resisting, with a cer∣tain
force, whatever endeavoured to change its state from the one to
the other. According to that ingenious and fanciful philosopher,
the whole of infinite space was full of matter, for with him matter
and extension were the same, and consequently there could be no
void. This immensity of matter, he supposed, to be divided into
an infinite number of very small cubes; all of which, being whirled
about upon their own centers, necessarily gave occasion to the pro∣duction
of two different elements. The first consisted of those an∣gular
parts, which, having been necessarily rubbed off, and grinded
<PB N="77" REF="170"/>
yet smaller by their mutual friction, constituted the most subtile and
moveable part of matter. The second consisted of those little glo∣bules
that were formed by the rubbing off of the first. The inter∣stices
betwixt these globules of the second element was filled up by
the particles of the first. But in the infinite collisions, which must
occur in an infinite space filled with matter, and all in motion, it
must necessarily happen, that many of the globules of the second ele∣ment
should be broken and grinded down into the first. The quan∣tity
of the first element having thus been encreased beyond what was
sufficient to sill up the interstices of the second, it must, in many
places, have been heaped up together, without any mixture of the se∣cond
along with it. Such, according to Des Cartes, was the origi∣nal
division of matter. Upon this infinitude of matter thus divided,
a certain quantity of motion was originally impressed by the Creator
of all things, and the laws of motion were so adjusted as always to
preserve the same quantity in it, without increase, and without di∣minution.
Whatever motion was lost by one part of matter, was
communicated to some other; and whatever was acquired by one
part of matter, was derived from some other: and thus, through an
eternal revolution, from rest to motion, and from motion to rest,
in every part of the universe, the quantity of motion in the whole
was always the same.</P>
<P>But, as there was no void, no one part of matter could be
moved without thrusting some other out of its place, nor that with∣out
thrusting some other, and so on. To avoid, therefore, an in∣finite
progress, he supposed, that the matter which any body pushed
before it, rolled immediately backwards, to supply the place of that
matter which flowed in behind it; as we may observe in the swim∣ming
of a fish, that the water, which it pushes before it, immediately
rolls backwards, to supply the place of what flows in behind it, and
thus forms a small circle or vortex round the body of the fish. It
<PB N="78" REF="171"/>
was, in the same manner, that the motion originally impressed by
the Creator upon the infinitude of matter, necessarily produced in it
an infinity of greater and smaller vortices, or circular streams: and
the law of motion being so adjusted as always to preserve the same
quantity of motion in the universe, those vortices either continued
for ever, or by their dissolution give birth to others of the same kind.
There was, thus, at all times, an infinite number of greater and
smaller vortices, or circular streams, revolving in the universe.</P>
<P>But, whatever moves in a circle, is constantly endeavouring to fly
off from the center of its revolution. For the natural motion of
all bodies is in a straight line. All the particles of matter, therefore,
in each of those greater vortices, were continually pressing from the
center to the circumference, with more or less force, according to the
different degrees of their bulk and solidity. The larger and more solid
globules of the second element forced themselves upwards to the cir∣cumference,
while the smaller, more yielding, and more active par∣ticles
of the first, which could flow, even through the interstices of
the second, were forced downwards to the center. They were forced
downwards to the center, notwithstanding their natural tendency was
upwards to the circumference; for the same reason that a piece of
wood, when plunged in water, is forced upwards to the furface,
notwithstanding its natural tendency is downwards to the bottom;
because its tendency downwards is less strong than that of the parti∣cles
of water, which, therefore, if one may say so, press in before
it, and thus force it upwards. But there being a greater quantity
of the first element than what was necessary to fill up the interstices
of the second, it was necessarily accumulated in the center of each of
these great circular streams, and formed there the firey and active
substance of the Sun. For, according to that philosopher, the Solar
Systems were infinite in number, each Fixed Star being the center
of one: and he is among the first of the moderns, who thus took
<PB N="79" REF="172"/>
away the boundaries of the Universe; even Copernicus and Kepler,
themselves, having confined it within, what they supposed, the vault
of the Firmament.</P>
<P>The center of each vortex being thus occupied by the most active
and moveable parts of matter, there was necessarily among them, a
more violent agitation than in any other part of the vortex, and this
violent agitation of the center cherished and supported the movement
of the whole. But, among the particles of the first element, which
fill up the interstices of the second, there are many, which, from
the pressure of the globules on all sides of them, necessarily receive
an angular form, and thus constitute a third element of particles less
fit for motion than those of the other two. As the particles, however,
of this third element were formed in the interstices of the second, they
are necessarily smaller than those of the second, and are, therefore,
along with those of the first, urged down towards the center, where,
when a number of them happen to take hold of one another, they form
such spots upon the surface of the accumulated particles of the first
element, as are often discovered by telescopes upon the face of that
Sun, which enlightens and animates our particular system. Those
spots are often broken and dispelled, by the violent agitation of the
particles of the first element, as has hitherto happily been the case
with those which have successively been formed upon the face of our
Sun. Sometimes, however, they encrust the whole surface of that
fire which is accumulated in the center; and the communication be∣twixt
the most active and the most inert parts of the vortex being
thus interrupted, the rapidity of its motion immediately begins to
languish, and can no longer defend it from being swallowed up and
carried away by the superior violence of some other like circular
stream; and in this manner, what was once a Sun, becomes a
Planet. Thus, the time was, according to this system, when the Moon
was a body of the same kind with the Sun, the firey center of a cir∣cular
<PB N="80" REF="173"/>
stream of ether, which flowed continually round her; but her
face having been crusted over by a congeries of angular particles, the
motion of this circular stream began to languish, and could no longer
defend itself from being absorbed by the more violent vortex of the
Earth, which was then, too, a Sun, and which chanced to be placed in
its neighbourhood. The Moon, therefore, became a Planet, and
revolved round the Earth. In process of time, the same fortune,
which had thus befallen the Moon, befell also the Earth; its face was
encrusted by a gross and inactive substance; the motion of its vortex
began to languish, and it was absorbed by the greater vortex of the
Sun: but though the vortex of the Earth had thus become languid,
it still had force enough to occasion both the diurnal revolution of the
Earth, and the monthly motion of the Moon. For a small circular
stream may easily be conceived as flowing round the body of the
Earth, at the same time that it is carried along by that great ocean of
ether which is continually revolving round the Sun; in the same
manner, as in a great whirlpool of water, one may often see several
small whirlpools, which revolve round centers of their own, and
at the same time are carried round the center of the great one.
Such was the cause of the original formation and consequent motions
of the Planetary System. When a solid body is turned round its
center, those parts of it, which are nearest, and those which are re∣motest
from the center, complete their revolutions in one and the
same time. But it is otherwise with the revolutions of a fluid: the
parts of it which are nearest the center complete their revolutions in
a shorter time, than those which are remoter. The Planets, there∣fore,
all floating in that immense tide of ether which is continually
setting in from west to east round the body of the Sun, complete
their revolutions in a longer or a shorter time, according to their
nearness or distance from him. There was, however, according to
Des Cartes, no very exact proportion observed betwixt the times of
their revolutions and their distances from the center. For that nice
<PB N="81" REF="174"/>
analogy, which Kepler had discovered betwixt them, having not yet
been confirmed by the observations of Cassini, was, as I before took
notice, entirely disregarded by Des Cartes. According to him, too,
their orbits might not be perfectly circular, but be longer the one way
than the other, and thus approach to an Ellipse. Nor yet was it
necessary to suppose, that they described this figure with geometrical
accuracy, or even that they described always precisely the same figure.
It rarely happens, that nature can be mathematically exact with regard
to the figure of the objects she produces, upon account of the
infinite combinations of impulses, which must conspire to the pro∣duction
of each of her effects. No two Planets, no two animals of
the same kind, have exactly the same figure, nor is that of any one
of them perfectly regular. It was in vain, therefore, that astrono∣mers
laboured to find that perfect constancy and regularity in the
motions of the heavenly bodies, which is to be found in no other
parts of nature. These motions, like all others, must either lan∣guish
or be accelerated, according as the cause which produces them,
the revolution of the vortex of the Sun, either languishes, or is ac∣celerated;
and there are innumerable events which may occasion
either the one or the other of those changes.</P>
<P>It was thus, that Des Cartes endeavoured to render familiar to the
imagination, the greatest difficulty in the Copernican system, the rapid
motion of the enormous bodies of the Planets. When the fancy
had thus been taught to conceive them as floating in an im∣mense
ocean of ether, it was quite agreeable to its usual habits to
conceive, that they should follow the stream of this ocean, how
rapid soever. This was an order of succession to which it had been
long accustomed, and with which it was, therefore, quite familiar.
This account, too, of the motions of the Heavens, was connected
with a vast, an immense system, which joined together a greater
number of the most discordant phaenomena of nature, than had
<PB N="82" REF="175"/>
been united by any other hypothesis; a system in which the principles
of connection, though perhaps equally imaginary, were, however,
more distinct and determinate, than any that had been known before;
and which attempted to trace to the imagination, not only the order
of succession by which the heavenly bodies were moved, but that by
which they, and almost all other natural objects, had originally been
produced.—The Cartesian philosophy begins now to be almost
universally rejected, while the Copernican system continues to be
universally received. Yet, it is not easy to imagine, how much
probability and coherence this admired system was long supposed to
derive from that exploded hypothesis. Till Des Cartes had published
his principles, the disjointed and incoherent system of Tycho Brahe,
though it was embraced heartily and completely by scarce any body,
was yet constantly talked of by all the learned, as, in point of pro∣bability,
upon a level with that of Copernicus. They took notice,
indeed, of its inferiority with regard to coherence and connection,
expressing hopes, however, that these defects might be remedied by
some future improvements. But when the world beheld that com∣plete,
and almost perfect coherence, which the philosophy of Des
Cartes bestowed upon the system of Copernicus, the imaginations of
mankind could no longer refuse themselves the pleasure of going
along with so harmonious an account of things. The system of Tycho
Brahe was every day less and less talked of, till at last it was for∣gotten
altogether.</P>
<P>The system of Des Cartes, however, though it connected together the
real motions of the heavenly bodies according to the system of Coper∣nicus,
more happily than had been done before, did so only when they
were considered in the gross; but did not apply to them, when they were
regarded in the detail. Des Cartes, as was said before, had never himself
observed the Heavens with any particular application. Though he was
not ignorant, therefore, of any of the observations which had been
<PB N="83" REF="176"/>
made before his time, he seems to have paid them no great degree
of attention; which, probably, proceeded from his own inexperience
in the study of Astronomy. So far, therefore, from accommodating
his system to all the minute irregularities, which Kepler had ascer∣tained
in the movements of the Planets; or from shewing, par∣ticularly,
how these irregularities, and no other, should arise from it,
he contented himself with observing, that perfect uniformity could
not be expected in their motions, from the nature of the causes which
produced them; that certain irregularities might take place in them,
for a great number of successive revolutions, and afterwards give way
to others of a different kind: a remark which, happily, relieved him
from the necessity of applying his system to the observations of
Kepler, and the other Astronomers.</P>
<P>But when the observations of Cassini had established the authority
of those laws, which Kepler had first discovered in the system, the
philosophy of Des Cartes, which could afford no reason, why such
particular laws should be observed, might continue to amuse the
learned in other sciences, but could no longer satisfy those that were
skilled in Astronomy. Sir Isaac Newton first attempted to give a
physical account of the motions of the Planets, which should accom∣modate
itself to all the constant irregularities which astronomers had
ever observed in their motions. The physical connection, by which
Des Cartes had endeavoured to bind together the movements of the
Planets, was the laws of impulse; of all the orders of succession,
those which are most familiar to the imagination; as they all flow
from the inertness of matter. After this quality, there is no other,
with which we are so well acquainted, as that of gravity. We
never act upon matter, but we have occasion to observe it. The su∣perior
genius and sagacity of Sir Isaac Newton, therefore, made
the most happy, and, we may now say, the greatest and most ad∣mirable
improvement that was ever made in philosophy, when he
<PB N="84" REF="177"/>
discovered, that he could join together the movements of the Planets
by so familiar a principle of connection, which completely removed
all the difficulties the imagination had hitherto felt in attending to them.
He demonstrated, that, if the Planets were supposed to gravitate to∣wards
the Sun, and to one another, and at the same time to have had
a projecting force originally impressed upon them, the primary ones
might all describe ellipses in one of the foci of which that great
luminary was placed; and the secondary ones might describe figures
of the same kind round their respective primaries, without being
disturbed by the continual motion of the centers of their revolutions.
That if the force, which retained each of them in their orbits, was
like that of gravity, and directed towards the Sun, they would,
each of them, describe equal areas in equal times. That if this
attractive power of the Sun, like all other qualities which are diffused
in rays from a center, diminished in the same proportion as the
squares of the distances increased, their motions would be swiftest
when nearest the Sun, and slowest when farthest off from him, in the
same proportion in which, by observation, they are discovered to be;
and that, upon the same supposition, of this gradual diminution of
their respective gravities, their periodic times would bear the same
proportion to their distances, which Kepler and Cassini had established
betwixt them. Having thus shown, that gravity might be the con∣necting
principle which joined together the movements of the
Planets, he endeavoured next to prove that it really was so. Ex∣perience
shews us, what is the power of gravity near the surface of
the Earth. That it is such as to make a body fall, in the first second
of its descent, through about fifteen Parisian feet. The Moon is
about sixty semidiameters of the Earth distant from its surface. If
gravity, therefore, was supposed to diminish, as the squares of the
distance increase, a body, at the Moon, would fall towards the Earth
in a minute; that is, in sixty seconds, through the same space,
which it falls near its surface in one second. But the arch which the
<PB N="85" REF="178"/>
Moon describes in a minute, falls, by observation, about fifteen
Parisian feet below the tangent drawn at the beginning of it. So far,
therefore, the Moon may be conceived as constantly falling towards the
Earth.</P>
<P>The system of Sir Isaac Newton corresponded to many other
irregularities which Astronomers had observed in the Heavens. It
assigned a reason, why the centers of the revolutions of the Planets
were not precisely in the center of the Sun, but in the common cen∣ter
of gravity of the Sun and the Planets. From the mutual at∣traction
of the Planets, it gave a reason for some other irregularities
in their motions; irregularities, which are quite sensible in those of
Jupiter and Saturn, when those Planets are nearly in conjunction
with one another. But of all the irregularities in the Heavens, those
of the Moon had hitherto given the greatest perplexity to Astro∣nomers;
and the system of Sir Isaac Newton corresponded, if pos∣sible,
yet more accurately with them than with any of the other Pla∣nets.
The Moon, when either in conjunction, or in opposition to
the Sun, appears furthest from the Earth, and nearest to it when in
her quarters. According to the system of that philosopher, when she
is in conjunction with the Sun, she is nearer the Sun than the Earth
is; consequently, more attracted to him, and, therefore, more sepa∣rated
from the Earth. On the contrary, when in opposition to the
Sun, she is further from the Sun than the Earth. The Earth, there∣fore,
is more attracted to the Sun; and, consequently, in this case,
too, further separated from the Moon. But, on the other hand,
when the Moon is in her quarters, the Earth and the Moon, being
both at equal distance from the Sun, are equally attracted to him.
They would not, upon this account alone, therefore, be brought
nearer to one another. As it is not in parallel lines, however, that
they are attracted towards the Sun, but in lines which meet in his
center, they are, thereby, still further approached to one another.
<PB N="86" REF="179"/>
Sir Isaac Newton computed the difference of the forces, with which
the Moon and the Earth ought, in all those different situations, ac∣cording
to his theory, to be impelled towards one another; and found,
that the different degrees of their approaches, as they had been ob∣served
by Astronomers, corresponded exactly to his computations.
As the attraction of the Sun, in the conjunctions and oppositions,
diminishes the gravity of the Moon towards the Earth, and, conse∣quently,
makes her necessarily extend her orbit, and, therefore, re∣quire
a longer periodical time to finish it. But, when the Moon and
the Earth are in that part of the orbit which is nearest the Sun, this
attraction of the Sun will be the greatest; consequently, the gravity
of the Moon towards the Earth, will there be most diminished; her
orbit be most extended; and her periodic time be, therefore, the
longest. This is, also, agreeable to experience, and in the very same
proportion, in which, by computation, from these principles, it
might be expected.</P>
<P>The orbit of the Moon is not precisely in the same Plane with that
of the Earth; but makes a very small angle with it. The points of
intersection of those two Planes, are called, the Nodes of the Moon.
These Nodes of the Moon are in continual motion, and in eighteen
or nineteen years, revolve backwards, from east to west, through all
the different points of the Ecliptic. For the Moon, after having
finished her periodical revolution, generally intersects the orbit of the
Earth somewhat behind the point where she had intersected it before.
But, though the motion of the Nodes is thus generally retrograde, it
is not always so, but is sometimes direct, and sometimes they appear
even stationary; the Moon generally intersects the Plane of the
Earth's orbit, behind the point where she had intersected it in her
former revolution; but she sometimes intersects it before that point,
and sometimes in the very same point. It is the situation of those
Nodes which determines the times of Eclipses, and their motions had,
upon this account, at all times, been particularly attended to by Astro∣nomers.
<PB N="87" REF="180"/>
Nothing, however, had perplexed them more, than to ac∣count
for these so inconsistent motions, and, at the same time, pre∣serve
their so much sought-for regularity in the revolutions of the
Moon. For they had no other means of connecting the appearances
together, than by supposing the motions which produced them, to be,
in reality, perfectly regular and equable. The history of Astronomy,
therefore, gives an account of a greater number of theories invented
for connecting together the motions of the Moon, than for connect∣ing
together those of all the other heavenly bodies taken together.
The theory of gravity, connected together, in the most accurate
manner, by the different actions of the Sun and the Earth, all those
irregular motions; and it appears, by calculation, that the time, the
quantity, and the duration of those direct and retrograde motions of
the Nodes, as well as of their stationary appearances, might be ex∣pected
to be exactly such, as the observations of Astronomers have
determined them.</P>
<P>The same principle, the attraction of the Sun, which thus ac∣counts
for the motions of the Nodes, connects, too, another very
perplexing irregularity in the appearances of the Moon; the per∣petual
variation in the inclination of her orbit to that of the
Earth.</P>
<P>As the Moon revolves in an ellipse, which has the centre of the
Earth in one of its foci, the longer axis of its orbit is called the
Line of its Apsides. This line is found, by observation, not to be
always directed towards the same points of the Firmament, but
to revolve forwards, from west to east, so as to pass through all
the points of the Ecliptic, and to complete its period in about
nine years; another irregularity, which had very much perplexed
Astronomers, but which the theory of gravity sufficiently accounted
for.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="181"/>
The Earth had hitherto been regarded as perfectly globular, pro∣bably
for the same reason which had made men imagine, that the
orbits of the Planets must necessarily be perfectly circular. But Sir
Isaac Newton, from mechanical principles, concluded, that, as the
parts of the Earth must be more agitated by her diurnal revolution
at the Equator, than at the Poles, they must necessarily be some∣what
elevated at the first, and flattened at the second. The observa∣tion,
that the oscillations of pendulums were flower at the Equator
than at the Poles, seeming to demonstrate, that gravity was
stronger at the Poles, and weaker at the Equator, proved, he thought,
that the Equator was further from the centre than the Poles. All
the measures, however, which had hitherto been made of the Earth,
seemed to show the contrary, that it was drawn out towards the
Poles, and flattened towards the Equator. Newton, however, pre∣ferred
his mechanical computations to the former measures of Geo∣graphers
and Astronomers; and in this he was confirmed by the ob∣servations
of Astronomers on the figure of Jupiter, whose diameter
at the Pole seems to be to his diameter at the Equator, as twelve to
thirteen; a much greater inequality than could be supposed to take
place betwixt the correspondent diameters of the Earth, but which
was exactly proportioned to the superior bulk of Jupiter, and the
superior rapidity with which he performs his diurnal revolutions.
The observations of Astronomers at Lapland and Peru have fully
confirmed Sir Isaac's system, and have not only demonstrated, that
the figure of the Earth is, in general, such as he supposed it; but
that the proportion of its axis to the diameter of its Equator is al∣most
precisely such as he had computed it. And of all the proofs
that have ever been adduced of the diurnal revolution of the Earth,
this perhaps is the most solid and satisfactory.</P>
<P>Hipparchus, by comparing his own observations with those of
some former Astronomers, had found that the equinoxial points were
<PB N="89" REF="182"/>
not always opposite to the same part of the Heavens, but that they ad∣vanced
gradually eastward by so slow a motion, as to be scarce sensible
in one hundred years, and which would require thirty-six thousand to
make a complete revolution of the Equinoxes, and to carry them
successively through all the different points of the Ecliptic. More
accurate observations discovered that this procession of the Equi∣noxes
was not so slow as Hipparchus had imagined it, and that it
required somewhat less than twenty-six thousand years to give them a
complete revolution. While the ancient system of Astronomy, which
represented the Earth as the immoveable centre of the universe, took
place, this appearance was necessarily accounted for, by supposing
that the Firmament, besides its rapid diurnal revolution round the
poles of the Equator, had likewise a slow periodical one round those
of the Ecliptic. And when the system of Hipparchus was by the
schoolmen united with the solid Spheres of Aristotle, they placed a new
christaline Sphere above the Firmament, in order to join this motion
to the rest. In the Copernican system, this appearance had hitherto
been connected with the other parts of that hypothesis, by supposing
a small revolution in the Earth's axis from east to west. Sir Isaac
Newton connected this motion by the same principle of gravity, by
which he had united all the others, and shewed, how the elevation
of the parts of the Earth at the Equator must, by the attraction of
the Sun, produce the same retrograde motion of the Nodes of the
Ecliptic, which it produced of the Nodes of the Moon. He com∣puted
the quantity of motion which could arise from this action of
the Sun, and his calculations here too entirely corresponded with the
observations of Astronomers.</P>
<P>Comets had hitherto, of all the appearances in the Heavens, been
the least attended to by Astronomers. The rarity and inconstancy of
their appearance, seemed to separate them entirely from the constant,
regular, and uniform objects in the Heavens, and to make them re∣semble
<PB N="90" REF="183"/>
more the inconstant, transitory, and accidental phaenomena
of those regions that are in the neighbourhood of the Earth. Ari∣stotle,
Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and Purbach, therefore, had
all degraded them below the Moon, and ranked them among the
meteors of the upper regions of the air. The observations of Tycho
Brahe demonstrated, that they ascended into the celestial regions,
and were often higher than Venus or the Sun. Des Cartes, at ran∣dom,
supposed them to be always higher than even the orbit of Sa∣turn;
and seems, by the superior elevation he thus bestowed upon
them, to have been willing to compensate that unjust degradation
which they had suffered for so many ages before. The observations
of some later Astronomers demonstrated, that they too revolved
about the Sun, and might therefore be parts of the Solar System.
Newton accordingly applied his mechanical principle of gravity to
explain the motions of these bodies. That they described equal areas
in equal times, had been discovered by the observations of some later
Astronomers; and Newton endeavoured to show how from this prin∣ciple,
and those observations, the nature and position of their several
orbits might be ascertained, and their periodic times determined.
His followers have, from his principles, ventured even to predict
the returns of several of them, particularly of one which is to make
its appearance in 1758<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It must be observed, that the whole of this Essay was written previous to the date here mentioned; and that the return of the comet happened agreeably to the pre∣diction.</NOTE>. We must wait for that time before we can
determine, whether his philosophy corresponds as happily to this
part of the system as to all the others. In the mean time, however,
the ductility of this principle, which applied itself so happily to
these, the most irregular of all the celestial appearances, and which
has introduced such complete coherence into the motions of all the
Heavenly Bodies, has served not a little to recommend it to the ima∣ginations
of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="184"/>
But of all the attempts of the Newtonian Philosophy, that which
would appear to be the most above the reach of human reason and ex∣perience,
is the attempt to compute the weights and densities of the
Sun, and of the several Planets. An attempt, however, which was
indispensibly necessary to complete the coherence of the Newtonian
system. The power of attraction which, according to the theory
of gravity, each body possesses, is in proportion to the quantity of
matter contained in that body. But the periodic time in which one
body, at a given distance, revolves round another that attracts it, is
shorter in proportion as this power is greater, and consequently as the
quantity of matter in the attracting body. If the densities of Jupiter
and Saturn were the same with that of the Earth, the periodic times
of their several Satellites would be shorter than by observation they
are found to be. Because the quantity of matter, and consequently
the attracting power of each of them, would be as the cubes of their
diameters. By comparing the bulks of those Planets, and the pe∣riodic
times of their Satellites, it is found that, upon the hypothesis
of gravity, the density of Jupiter must be greater than that of Sa∣turn,
and the density of the Earth greater than that of Jupiter.
This seems to establish it as a law in the system, that the nearer the
several Planets approach to the Sun, the density of their matter is the
greater: a constitution of things which would seem to be the most
advantageous of any that could have been established; as water of
the same density with that of our Earth, would freeze under the
Equator of Saturn, and boil under that of Mercury.</P>
<P>Such is the system of Sir Isaac Newton, a system whose parts are
all more strictly connected together, than those of any other philo∣sophical
hypothesis. Allow his principle, the universality of gra∣vity,
and that it decreases as the squares of the distance increase,
and all the appearances, which he joins together by it, necessarily
follow. Neither is their connection merely a general and loose con∣nection,
<PB N="92" REF="185"/>
as that of most other systems, in which either these appear∣ances,
or some such like appearances, might indifferently have been
expected. It is every where the most precise and particular that can be
imagined, and ascertains the time, the place, the quantity, the duration
of each individual phaenomenon, to be exactly such as, by observa∣tion,
they have been determined to be. Neither are the principles
of union, which it employs, such as the imagination can find any
difficulty in going along with. The gravity of matter is, of all its
qualities, after its inertness, that which is most familiar to us. We
never act upon it without having occasion to observe this pro∣perty.
The law too, by which it is supposed to diminish as it re∣cedes
from its centre, is the same which takes place in all other
qualities which are propagated in rays from a centre, in light, and
in every thing else of the same kind. It is such, that we not only
find that it does take place in all such qualities, but we are neces∣sarily
determined to conceive that, from the nature of the thing, it
must take place. The opposition which was made in France, and in
some other foreign nations, to the prevalence of this system, did not
arise from any difficulty which mankind naturally felt in conceiving
gravity as an original and primary mover in the constitution of the
universe. The Cartesian system, which had prevailed so generally
before it, had accustomed mankind to conceive motion as never be∣ginning,
but in consequence of impulse, and had connected the de∣scent
of heavy bodies, near the surface of the Earth, and the other
Planets, by this more general bond of union; and it was the attach∣ment
the world had conceived for this account of things, which in∣disposed
them to that of Sir Isaac Newton. His system, however,
now prevails over all opposition, and has advanced to the acquisition
of the most universal empire that was ever established in philosophy.
His principles, it must be acknowledged, have a degree of firmness
and solidity that we should in vain look for in any other system.
The most sceptical cannot avoid feeling this. They not only con∣nect
<PB N="93" REF="186"/>
together most perfectly all the phaenomena of the Heavens,
which had been observed before his time, but those also which the
persevering industry and more perfect instruments of later Astrono∣mers
have made known to us; have been either easily and immedi∣ately
explained by the application of his principles, or have been
explained in consequence of more laborious and accurate calculations
from these principles, than had been instituted before. And even
we, while we have been endeavouring to represent all philosophical
systems as mere inventions of the imagination, to connect together
the otherwise disjointed and discordant phaenomena of nature, have
insensibly been drawn in, to make use of language expressing the
connecting principles of this one, as if they were the real chains
which Nature makes use of to bind together her several operations.
Can we wonder then, that it should have gained the general and
complete approbation of mankind, and that it should now be con∣sidered,
not as an attempt to connect in the imagination the phaeno∣mena
of the Heavens, but as the greatest discovery that ever was made
by man, the discovery of an immense chain of the most important and
sublime truths, all closely connected together, by one capital fact,
of the reality of which we have daily experience.</P>

chose rather to publish than to suppress it. It must be viewed, not as a

<HEAD>HISTORY
OF THE
ANCIENT PHYSICS.</HEAD>
<P>FROM arranging and methodizing the System of the Heavens,
Philosophy descended to the consideration of the inferior parts
of Nature, of the Earth, and of the bodies which immediately sur∣round
it. If the objects, which were here presented to its view,
were inferior in greatness or beauty, and therefore less apt to attract
the attention of the mind, they were more apt, when they came
to be attended to, to embarrass and perplex it, by the variety of
their species, and by the intricacy and seeming irregularity of the
laws or orders of their succession. The species of objects in the
Heavens are few in number; the Sun, the Moon, the Planets, and
the Fixed Stars, are all which those philosophers could distinguish.
All the changes too, which are ever observed in these bodies, evi∣dently
arise from some difference in the velocity and direction of
their several motions; but the variety of meteors in the air, of
clouds, rainbows, thunder, lightning, winds, rain, hail, snow, is
vastly greater; and the order of their succession seems to be still
more irregular and unconstant. The species of fossils, minerals,
plants, animals, which are found in the Waters, and near the sur∣face
of the Earth, are still more intricately diversified; and if we
<PB N="98" REF="189"/>
regard the different manners of their production, their mutual in∣fluence
in altering, destroying, supporting one another, the orders
of their succession seem to admit of an almost infinite variety. If
the imagination, therefore, when it considered the appearances in
the Heavens, was often perplexed, and driven out of its natural
career, it would be much more exposed to the same embarrassment,
when it directed its attention to the objects which the Earth pre∣sented
to it, and when it endeavoured to trace their progress and
successive revolutions.</P>
<P>To introduce order and coherence into the mind's conception of
this seeming chaos of dissimilar and disjointed appearances, it was
necessary to deduce all their qualities, operations, and laws of suc∣cession,
from those of some particular things, with which it was
perfectly acquainted and familiar, and along which its imagination
could glide smoothly and easily, and without interruption. But as
we would in vain attempt to deduce the heat of a stove from that of
an open chimney, unless we could show that the same fire which
was exposed in the one, lay concealed in the other; so it was im∣possible
to deduce the qualities and laws of succession, observed in
the more uncommon appearances of Nature, from those of such as
were more familiar, if those customary objects were not supposed,
however disguised in their appearance, to enter into the composition
of those rarer and more singular phaenomena. To render, therefore,
this lower part of the great theatre of nature a coherent spectacle to
the imagination, it became necessary to suppose, first, That all the
strange objects of which it consisted were made up out of a few,
with which the mind was extremely familiar: and secondly, That
all their qualities, operations, and rules of succession, were no more
than different diversifications of those to which it had long been
accustomed, in these primary and elementary objects.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="190"/>
Of all the bodies of which these inferior parts of the universe seem
to be composed, those with which we are most familiar, are the
Earth, which we tread upon; the Water, which we every day use;
the Air, which we constantly breath; and the Fire, whose benign
influence is not only required for preparing the common necessaries
of life, but for the continual support of that vital principle which
actuates both plants and animals. These, therefore, were by Empe∣docles,
and the other philosophers of the Italian school, supposed to
be the elements, out of which, at least, all the inferior parts of na∣ture
were composed. The familiarity of those bodies to the mind,
naturally disposed it to look for some resemblance to them in what∣ever
else was presented to its consideration. The discovery of some
such resemblance united the new object to an assortment of things,
with which the imagination was perfectly acquainted. And if any
analogy could be observed betwixt the operations and laws of suc∣cession
of the compound, and those of the simple objects, the move∣ment
of the fancy, in tracing their progress, became quite smooth,
and natural, and easy. This natural anticipation, too, was still
more confirmed by such a slight and inaccurate analysis of things, as
could be expected in the infancy of science, when the curiosity of
mankind, grasping at an account of all things before it had got full
satisfaction with regard to any one, hurried on to build, in imagi∣nation,
the immense fabric of the universe. The heat, observed in
both plants and animals, seemed to demonstrate, that Fire made a
part of their composition. Air was not less necessary for the subsist∣ance
of both, and seemed, too, to enter into the fabric of animals
by respiration, and into that of plants by some other means. The
juices which circulated through them showed how much of their
texture was owing to Water. And their resolution into Earth by
putrefaction, discovered that this element had not been left out in
their original formation. A similar analysis seemed to shew the same
principles in most other compound bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="191"/>
The vast extent of those bodies seemed to render them, upon an∣other
account, proper to be the great stores out of which nature
compounded all the other species of things. Earth and Water di∣vide
almost the whole of the terrestrial globe between them. The
thin transparent covering of the Air surrounds it to an immense
height upon all sides. Fire, with its attendant, light, seems to de∣scend
from the celestial regions, and might, therefore, either be sup∣posed
to be diffused through the whole of those aetherial spaces, as
well as to be condensed and conglobated in those luminous bodies,
which sparkle across them, as by the Stoics; or, to be placed im∣mediately
under the sphere of the Moon, in the region next below
them, as by the Peripatetics, who could not reconcile the devouring
nature of Fire with the supposed unchangeable essence of their solid
and crystalline spheres.</P>
<P>The qualities, too, by which we are chiefly accustomed to cha∣racterize
and distinguish natural bodies, are all of them found, in the
highest degree in those Four Elements. The great divisions of the
objects, near the surface of the Earth, are those into hot and cold,
most and dry, light and heavy. These are the most remarkable
properties of bodies; and it is upon them that many of their other
most sensible qualities and powers seem to depend. Of these, heat
and cold were naturally enough regarded by those first enquirers into
nature, as the active, moisture and dryness, as the passive qualities
of matter. It was the temperature of heat and cold which seemed
to occasion the growth and dissolution of plants and animals; as ap∣peared
evident from the effects of the change of the seasons upon
both. A proper degree of moisture and dryness was not less neces∣sary
for these purposes; as was evident from the different effects
and productions of wet and dry seasons and soils. It was the heat
and cold, however, which actuated and determined those two other∣wise
inert qualities of things, to a state either of rest or motion.
<PB N="101" REF="192"/>
Gravity and levity were regarded as the two principles of motion,
which directed all sublunary things to their proper place: and all
those six qualities, taken together, were, upon such an inattentive
view of nature, as must be expected in the beginnings of philoso∣phy,
readily enough apprehended to be capable of connecting toge∣ther
the most remarkable revolutions, which occur in these inferior
parts of the universe. Heat and dryness were the qualities which
characterized the element of Fire; heat and moisture that of Air;
moisture and cold that of Water; cold and dryness that of Earth.
The natural motion of two of these elements, Earth and Water, was
downwards, upon account of their gravity. This tendency, how∣ever,
was stronger in the one than in the other, upon account of the
superior gravity of Earth. The natural motion of the two other ele∣ments,
Fire and Air, was upwards, upon account of their levity;
and this tendency, too, was stronger in the one than in the other,
upon account of the superior levity of Fire. Let us not despise
those ancient philosophers, for thus supposing, that these two ele∣ments
had a positive levity, or a real tendency upwards. Let us
remember, that this notion has an appearance of being confirmed by
the most obvious observations; that those facts and experiments, which
demonstrate the weight of the Air, and which no superior sagacity, but
chance alone, presented to the moderns, were altogether unknown
to them; and that, what might, in some measure, have supplied the
place of those experiments, the reasonings concerning the causes of
the ascent of bodies, in fluids specifically heavier than themselves,
seem to have been unknown in the ancient world, till Archimedes
discovered them, long after their system of physics was completed,
and had acquired an established reputation: that those reasonings are
far from being obvious, and that by their inventor, they seem to have
been thought applicable only to the ascent of Solids in Water, and
not even to that of Solids in air, much less to that of one fluid in
another. But it is this last only which could explain the ascent of
<PB N="102" REF="193"/>
flame, vapours, and fiery exhalations, without the supposition of a
specific levity.</P>
<P>Thus, each of those Four Elements had, in the system of the uni∣verse,
a place which was peculiarly allotted to it, and to which it
naturally tended. Earth and Water rolled down to the centre; the
Air spread itself above them; while the Fire soared alost, either to
the celestial region, or to that which was immediately below it.
When each of those simple bodies had thus obtained its proper
sphere, there was nothing in the nature of any one of them to make
it pass into the place of the other, to make the Fire descend into the
Air, the Air into the Water, or the Water into the Earth; or, on
the contrary, to bring up the Earth into the place of the Water, the
Water into that of the Air, or the Air into that of the Fire. All
sublunary things, therefore, if left to themselves, would have re∣mained
in an eternal repose. The revolution of the heavens, those
of the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, by producing the vicissitudes
of Day and Night, and of the Seasons, prevented this torpor and in∣activity
from reigning through the inferior parts of nature; inflamed
by the rapidity of their circumvolutions, the element of Fire, and
forced it violently downwards into the Air, into the Water, and
into the Earth, and thereby produced those mixtures of the different
elements which kept up the motion and circulation of the lower
parts of nature; occasioned, sometimes, the entire transmutation of
one element into another, and sometimes the production of forms
and species different from them all, and in which, though the qua∣lities
of them all might be found, they were so altered and attem∣pered
by the mixture, as scarce to be distinguishable.</P>
<P>Thus, if a small quantity of Fire was mixed with a great quantity
of Air, the moisture and moderate warmth of the one entirely fur∣mounted
and changed into their own essence the intense heat and
<PB N="103" REF="194"/>
dryness of the other; and the whole aggregate became Air. The
contrary of which happened, if a small quantity of Air was mixed
with a great quantity of Fire: the whole, in this case, became Fire.
In the same manner, if a small quantity of Fire was mixed with a
great quantity of Water, then, either the moisture and cold of the
Water might surmount the heat and dryness of the Fire, so as that
the whole should become Water; or, the moisture of the Water
might surmount the dryness of the Fire, while, in its turn, the heat
of the Fire surmounted the coldness of the Water, so as that the
whole aggregate, its qualities being heat and moisture, should become
Air, which was regarded as the more natural and easy metamorphosis
of the two. In the same manner they explained how like changes
were produced by the different mixtures of Fire and Earth, Earth
and Water, Water and Air, Air and Earth; and thus they connected
together the successive transmutations of the elements into one
another.</P>
<P>Every mixture of the Elements, however, did not produce an
entire transmutation. They were sometimes so blended together,
that the qualities of the one, not being able to destroy, served only
to attemper those of the other. Thus Fire, when mixed with water,
produced sometimes a watery vapour, whose qualities were heat and
moisture; which partook at once of the levity of the Fire, and of
the gravity of the Water, and which was elevated by the first into
the Air, but retained by the last from ascending into the region of
Fire. The relative cold, which they supposed prevailed in the mid∣dle
region of the Air, upon account of its equal distance, both from
the region of Fire, and from the rays that are reflected by the surface
of the Earth, condensed this vapour into Water; the Fire escaped it,
and flew upwards, and the Water fell down in rain, or, according to
the different degrees of cold that prevailed in the different seasons,
was sometimes congealed into snow, and sometimes into hail. In the
<PB N="104" REF="195"/>
same manner, Fire, when mixed with Earth, produced sometimes a
fiery exhalation, whose qualities were heat and dryness, which being
elevated by the levity of the first into the Air condensed by the cold,
so as to take fire, and being at the same time surrounded by watery
vapours, burst forth into thunder and lightning, and other fiery
meteors. Thus they connected together the different appearances in
the Air, by the qualities of their Four Elements; and from them,
too, in the same manner, they endeavoured to deduce all the other
qualities in the other homogeneous bodies, that are near the surface
of the Earth. Thus, to give an example, with regard to the hard∣ness
and softness of bodies; heat and moisture, they observed, were
the great softners of matter. Whatever was hard, therefore, owed
that quality either to the absence of heat, or to the absence of mois∣ture.
Ice, crystal, lead, gold, and almost all metals, owed their
hardness to the absence of heat, and were, therefore, dissolveable by
Fire. Rock-salt, nitre, alum, and hard clay, owed that quality to
the absence of moisture, and were, therefore, dissolveable in water.
And, in the same manner, they endeavoured to connect together
most of the other tangible qualities of matter. Their principles of
union, indeed, were often such as had no real existence, and were
always vague and undetermined in the highest degree; they were
such, however, as might be expected in the beginnings of science,
and such as, with all their imperfections, could enable mankind both
to think and to talk, with more coherence, concerning those general
subjects, than without them they would have been capable of doing.
Neither was their system entirely devoid either of beauty or magnifi∣cence.
Each of the Four Elements having a particular region allot∣ted
to it, had a place of rest, to which it naturally tended, by its
motion, either up or down, in a straight line, and where, when it
had arrived, it naturally ceased to move. Earth descended, till it ar∣rived
at the place of Earth; Water, till it arrived at that of Water;
and Air, till it arrived at that of Air; and there each of them tended to a
<PB N="105" REF="196"/>
state of eternal repose and inaction. The Spheres consisted of a
Fifth Element, which was neither light nor heavy, and whose natu∣ral
motion made it tend, neither to the center, nor from the center,
but revolve round it in a circle. As, by this motion, they could
never change their situation with regard to the center, they had no
place of repose, no place to which they naturally tended more than
to any other, but revolved round and round for ever. This Fifth
Element was subject neither to generation nor corruption, nor alter∣ation
of any kind; for whatever changes may happen in the Heavens,
the senses can scarce perceive them, and their appearance is the same
in one age as in another. The beauty, too, of their supposed crys∣talline
spheres seemed still more to entitle them to this distinction of
unchangeable immortality. It was the motion of those Spheres,
which occasioned the mixtures of the Elements, and from thence,
the production of all the forms and species, that diversify the world.
It was the approach of the Sun and of the other Planets, to the dif∣ferent
parts of the Earth, which, by forcing down the element of
Fire, occasioned the generation of those forms. It was the recess of
those bodies, which, by allowing each Element to escape to its proper
sphere, brought about, in an equal time, their corruption. It was
the periods of those great lights of Heaven, which measured out to
all sublunary things, the term of their duration, of their growth, and
of their decay, either in one, or in a number of seasons, according
as the Elements of which they were composed, were either imper∣fectly
or accurately blended and mixed with one another. Immor∣tality,
they could bestow upon no individual form, because the prin∣ciples
out of which it was formed, all tending to disengage them∣selves,
and to return to their proper spheres, necessarily, at last,
brought about its dissolution. But, though all individuals were thus
perishable, and constantly decaying, every species was immortal,
because the subject matter out of which they were made, and the
<PB N="106" REF="197"/>
revolution of the Heavens, the cause of their successive generations,
were always the same.</P>
<P>In the first ages of the world, the seeming incoherence of the ap∣pearances
of nature, so confounded mankind, that they despaired of
discovering in her operations any regular system. Their ignorance,
and confusion of thought, necessarily gave birth to that pusillanimous
superstition, which ascribes almost every unexpected event, to the
arbitrary will of some designing, though invisible beings, who pro∣duced
it for some private and particular purpose. The idea of an
universal mind, of a God of all, who originally formed the whole,
and who governs the whole by general laws, directed to the conser∣vation
and prosperity of the whole, without regard to that of any
private individual, was a notion to which they were utterly strangers.
Their gods, though they were apprehended to interpose, upon some par∣ticular
occasions, were so far from being regarded, as the creators of
the world, that their origin was apprehended to be posterior to that
of the world. The Earth, according to Hesiod, was the first pro∣duction
of the chaos. The Heavens arose out of the Earth, and
from both together, all the gods, who afterwards inhabited them.
Nor was this notion confined to the vulgar, and to those poets who
seem to have recorded the vulgar theology. Of all the philosophers
of the Ionian school, Anaxagoras, it is well known, was the first
who supposed, that mind and understanding were requisite to account
for the first origin of the world, and who, therefore, compared
with the other philosophers of his time, talked, as Aristotle observes,
like a sober man among drunkards; but whose opinion was, at that
time, so remarkable, that he seems to have got a sirname from it.
The same notion, of the spontaneous origin of the world, was em∣braced,
too, as the same author tells us, by the early Pythagoreans,
a fect, which, in the antient world, was never regarded as irreligious.
<PB N="107" REF="198"/>
Mind, and understanding, and consequently Deity, being the most
perfect, were necessarily, according to them, the last productions of
Nature. For in all other things, what was most perfect, they ob∣served,
always came last. As in plants and animals, it is not the
seed that is most perfect, but the complete animal, with all its mem∣bers,
in the one; and the complete plant, with all its branches,
leaves, flowers, and fruits, in the other. This notion, which could
take place only while Nature was still considered as, in some mea∣sure,
disorderly and inconstant in her operations, was necessarily re∣nounced
by those philosophers, when, upon a more attentive sur∣vey,
they discovered, or imagined they had discovered, more dis∣tinctly,
the chain which bound all her different parts to one another.
As soon as the Universe was regarded as a complete machine, as a
coherent system, governed by general laws, and directed to general
ends, viz. its own preservation and prosperity, and that of all the spe∣cies
that are in it; the resemblance which it evidently bore to those
machines which are produced by human art, necessarily impressed those
sages with a belief, that in the original formation of the world there
must have been employed an art resembling the human art, but as
much superior to it, as the world is superior to the machines which
that art produces. The unity of the system, which, according to this
ancient philosophy, is most perfect, suggested the idea of the unity of
that principle, by whose art it was formed; and thus, as ignorance
begot superstition, science gave birth to the first theism that arose
among those nations, who were not enlightened by divine Revelation.
According to Timaeus, who was followed by Plato, that intelligent
Being, who formed the world, endowed it with a principle of life
and understanding, which extends from its centre to its remotest cir∣cumference,
which is conscious of all its changes, and which governs
and directs all its motions to the great end of its formation. This
Soul of the world was itself a God, the greatest of all the in∣ferior,
and created deities; of an essence that was indissoluble, by
<PB N="108" REF="199"/>
any power but by that of him who made it, and which was united
to the body of the world, so as to be inseparable by every force, but
his who joined them, from the exertion of which his goodness se∣cured
them. The beauty of the celestial spheres attracting the ad∣miration
of mankind, the constancy and regularity of their motions
seeming to manifest peculiar wisdom and understanding, they were
each of them supposed to be animated by an Intelligence of a nature
that was, in the same manner, indissoluble and immortal, and inse∣parably
united to that sphere which it inhabited. All the mortal
and changeable beings which people the surface of the earth were
formed by those inferior deities; for the revolutions of the heavenly
bodies seemed plainly to influence the generation and growth of
both plants and animals, whose frail and fading forms bore the too
evident marks of the weakness of those inferior causes, which joined
their different parts to one another. According to Plato and Ti∣maeus,
neither the Universe, nor even those inferior deities, who go∣vern
the Universe, were eternal, but were formed in time, by the
great Author of all things, out of that matter which had existed
from all eternity. This at least their words seem to import, and thus
they are understood by Cicero, and by all the other writers of earlier
antiquity, though some of the later Platonists have interpreted them
differently.</P>
<P>According to Aristotle, who seems to have followed the doctrine
of Ocellus, the world was eternal; the eternal effect of an eternal
cause. He found it difficult, it would seem, to conceive what could
hinder the First Cause from exerting his divine energy from all eter∣nity.
At whatever time he began to exert it, he must have, been at rest
during all the infinite ages of that eternity which had passed before it.
To what obstruction, from within or from without, could this be
owing? or how could this obstruction, if it ever had subsisted, have
ever been removed? His idea of the nature and manner of exist∣ence
of this First Cause, as it is expressed in the last book of his
<PB N="109" REF="200"/>
Physics, and the five last chapters of his Metaphysics, is indeed
obscure and unintelligible in the highest degree, and has perplexed
his commentators more than any other parts of his writings. Thus
far, however, he seems to express himself plainly enough: that the
First Heavens, that of the Fixed Stars, from which are derived the
motions of all the rest, is revolved by an eternal, immoveable, un∣changeable,
unextended being, whose essence consists in intelligence,
as that of a body consists in solidity and extension; and which is
therefore necessarily and always intelligent, as a body is neces∣sarily
and always extended: that this Being was the first and su∣preme
mover of the Universe: that the inferior Planetary Spheres
derived each of them its peculiar revolution from an inferior being
of the same kind; eternal, immoveable, unextended, and necessarily
intelligent: that the sole object of the intelligence of those beings
was their own essence, and the revolution of their own spheres; all
other inferior things being unworthy of their consideration; and
that therefore whatever was below the Moon was abandoned by the
gods to the direction of Nature, and Chance, and Necessity. For
though those celestial beings were, by the revolutions of their several
Spheres, the original causes of the generation and corruption of all
sublunary forms, they were causes who neither knew nor intended
the effects which they produced. This renowned philosopher seems,
in his theological notions, to have been directed by prejudices which,
though extremely natural, are not very philosophical. The revo∣lutions
of the Heavens, by their grandeur and constancy, excited
his admiration, and seemed, upon that account, to be effects not un∣worthy
a Divine Intelligence. Whereas the meanness of many
things, the disorder and confusion of all things below, exciting no
such agreeable emotion, seemed to have no marks of being directed
by that Supreme Understanding. Yet, though this opinion saps
the foundations of human worship, and must have the same effects
upon society as Atheism itself, one may easily trace, in the Meta∣physics
<PB N="110" REF="201"/>
physics upon which it is grounded, the origin of many of the no∣tions,
or rather of many of the expressions, in the scholastic theo∣logy,
to which no notions can be annexed.</P>
<P>The Stoics, the most religious of all the ancient fects of philoso∣phers,
seem in this, as in most other things, to have altered and
refined upon the doctrine of Plato. The order, harmony, and co∣herence
which this philosophy bestowed upon the Universal System,
struck them with awe and veneration. As, in the rude ages of the
world, whatever particular part of Nature excited the admiration of
mankind, was apprehended to be animated by some particular divi∣nity;
so the whole of Nature having, by their reasonings, become
equally the object of admiration, was equally apprehended to be
animated by a Universal Deity, to be itself a Divinity, an Animal;
a term which to our ears seems by no means synonimous with the
foregoing; whose body was the solid and sensible parts of Nature,
and whose soul was that aetherial Fire, which penetrated and actuated
the whole. For of all the four elements, out of which all things
were composed, Fire or Aether seemed to be that which bore the
greatest resemblance to the Vital Principle which informs both plants
and animals, and therefore most likely to be the Vital Principle
which animated the Universe. This infinite and unbounded Aether,
which extended itself from the centre beyond the remotest circum∣ference
of Nature, and was endowed with the most consummate
reason and intelligence, or rather was itself the very essence of rea∣son
and intelligence, had originally formed the world, and had
communicated a portion, or ray, of its own essence to whatever was
endowed with life and sensation, which, upon the dissolution of
those forms, either immediately or sometime after, was again ab∣sorbed
into that ocean of Deity from whence it had originally been
detached. In this system the Sun, the Moon, the Planets, and the
Fixed Stars, were each of them also inferior divinities, animated by a
<PB N="111" REF="202"/>
detached portion of that aetherial essence which was the soul of the
world. In the system of Plato, the Intelligence which animated the
world was different from that which originally formed it. Neither
were these which animated the celestial spheres, nor those which
informed inferior terrestrial animals, regarded as portions of this
plastic soul of the world. Upon the dissolution of animals, therefore,
their souls were not absorbed in the soul of the world, but had a sepa∣rate
and eternal existence, which gave birth to the notion of the trans∣migration
of souls. Neither did it seem unnatural, that, as the same
matter which had composed one animal body might be employed to
compose another, that the same intelligence which had animated one
such being should again animate another. But in the system of the
Stoics, the intelligence which originally formed, and that which
animated the world, were one and the same, all inferior intel∣ligences
were detached portions of the great one; and therefore, in
a longer, or in a shorter time, were all of them, even the gods
themselves, who animated the celestial bodies, to be at last resolved
into the infinite essence of this almighty Jupiter, who, at a destined
period, should, by an universal conflagration, wrap up all things, in
that aetherial and siery nature, out of which they had originally
been deduced, again to bring forth a new Heaven and a new Earth,
new animals, new men, new deities; all of which would again, at
a fated time, be swallowed up in a like conflagration, again to be
re-produced, and again to be re-destroyed, and so on without end.</P>

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY
OF THE
ANCIENT LOGICS and METAPHYSICS.</HEAD>
<P>IN every transmutation, either of one element into another, or of
one compound body, either into the elements out of which it
was composed, or into another compound body, it seemed evi∣dent,
that, both in the old and in the new species, there was
something that was the same, and something that was different.
When Fire was changed into Air, or Water into Earth, the Stuff,
or Subject-matter of this Air and this Earth, was evidently the
same with that of the former Fire or Water; but the Nature or Spe∣cies
of those new bodies was entirely different. When, in the
same manner, a number of fresh, green, and odoriferous flowers
were thrown together in a heap, they, in a short time, entirely
changed their nature, became putrid and loathsome, and dissolved
into a confused mass of ordure, which bore no resemblance, either
in its sensible qualities or in its effects, to their former beautiful
appearance. But how different soever the species, the subject-matter
of the flowers, and of the ordure, was, in this case too, evidently
the same. In every body, therefore, whether simple or mixed,
there were evidently two principles, whose combination constituted
the whole nature of that particular body. The first was the Stuff,
or Subject-matter, out of which it was made; the second was the
<PB N="116" REF="205"/>
Species, the Specific Essence, the Essential, or, as the schoolmen have
called it, the Substantial Form of the Body. The first seemed to be
the same in all bodies, and to have neither qualities nor powers of
any kind, but to be altogether inert and imperceptible by any of
the senses, till it was qualified and rendered sensible by its union
with some species or essential form. All the qualities and powers of
bodies seemed to depend upon their species or essential forms. It
was not the stuff or matter of Fire, or Air, or Earth, or Water, which
enabled those elements to produce their several effects, but that
essential form which was peculiar to each of them. For it seemed
evident, that Fire must produce the effects of Fire, by that which
rendered it Fire; Air, by that which rendered it Air; and that
in the same manner all other simple and mixed bodies must pro∣duce
their several effects, by that which constituted them such
or such bodies; that is, by their specific Essence or essential
forms. But it is from the effects of bodies upon one another,
that all the changes and revolutions in the material world arise.
Since these, therefore, depend upon the specific essences of those
bodies, it must be the business of philosophy, that science which
endeavours to connect together all the different changes that oc∣cur
in the world, to determine wherein the specific Essence of
each object consists, in order to foresee what changes or revolutions
may be expected from it. But the specific Essence of each indi∣vidual
object is not that which is peculiar to it as an individual,
but that which is common to it, with all other objects of the same
kind. Thus the specific Essence of the Water, which now stands
before me, does not consist in its being heated by the Fire, or cooled
by the Air, in such a particular degree; in its being contained in a
vessel of such a form, or of such dimensions. These are all acci∣dental
circumstances, which are altogether extraneous to its general
nature, and upon which none of its effects as Water depend. Phi∣losophy,
therefore, in considering the general nature of Water, takes
<PB N="117" REF="206"/>
no notice of those particularities which are peculiar to this Water,
but consines itself to those things which are common to all water.
If, in the progress of its enquiries, it should descend to consider the
nature of Water that is modified by such particular accidents, it still
would not consine its consideration to this water contained in this
vessel, and thus heated at this fire, but would extend its views to
Water in general contained in such kind of vessels, and heated to
such a degree at such a fire. In every case, therefore, Species, or
Universals, and not Individuals, are the objects of Philosophy. Be∣cause
whatever effects are produced by individuals, whatever changes
can flow from them, must all proceed from some universal nature
that is contained in them. As it was the business of Physics, or
Natural Philosophy, to determine wherein consisted the Nature and
Essence of every particular Species of things, in order to connect to∣gether
all the different events that occur in the material world;
so there were two other sciences, which, though they had ori∣ginally
arisen out of that system of Natural Philosophy I have just
been describing, were, however, apprehended to go before it, in the
order in which the knowledge of Nature ought to be communicated.
The first of these, Metaphysics, considered the general nature of Uni∣versals,
and the different forts or species into which they might be
divided. The second of these, Logics, was built upon this doctrine
of Metaphysics; and from the general nature of Universals, and of
the sorts into which they were divided, endeavoured to ascertain the
general rules by which we might distribute all particular objects into
general classes, and determine to what class each individual object
belonged; for in this, they justly enough apprehended, consisted
the whole art of philosophical reasoning. As the first of these two
sciences, Metaphysics, is altogether subordinate to the second, Logic,
they seem, before the time of Aristotle, to have been regarded as
one, and to have made up between them that ancient Dialectic of
which we hear so much, and of which we understand so little:
neither does this separation seem to have been much attended to,
<PB N="118" REF="207"/>
either by his own followers, the ancient Peripatetics, or by any
other of the old sects of philosophers. The later schoolmen, in∣deed,
have distinguished between Ontology and Logic; but their
Ontology contains but a small part of what is the subject of the
metaphysical books of Aristotle, the greater part of which, the doc∣trines
of Universals, and every thing that is preparatory to the arts
of defining and dividing, has, since the days of Porphery, been in∣serted
into their Logic.</P>
<P>According to Plato and Timaeus, the principles out of which the
Deity formed the World, and which were themselves eternal, were
three in number. The Subject-matter of things, the Species or
specific Essences of things, and what was made out of these, the
sensible objects themselves. These last had no proper or durable
existence, but were in perpetual flux and succession. For as He∣raclitus
had said, that no man ever passed the same river twice,
because the water which he had passed over once was gone before
he could pass over it a second time; so, in the same manner, no
man ever saw, or heard, or touched the same sensible object twice.
When I look at the window, for example, the visible species,
which strikes my eyes this moment, though resembling, is dif∣ferent
from that which struck my eyes the immediately preceding
moment. When I ring the bell, the sound, or audible species
which I hear this moment, though resembling in the same manner,
is different, however, from that which I heard the moment be∣fore.
When I lay my hand on the table, the tangible species which I
feel this moment, though resembling, in the same manner, is nu∣merically
different too from that which I felt the moment before.
Our sensations, therefore, never properly exist or endure one mo∣ment;
but, in the very instant of their generation, perish and are
annihilated for ever. Nor are the causes of those sensations more
permanent. No corporeal substance is ever exactly the same, either
in whole or in any assignable part, during two successive moments,
<PB N="119" REF="208"/>
but by the perpetual addition of new parts, as well as loss of old
ones, is in continual flux and succession. Things of so steeting a
nature can never be the objects of science, or of any steady or per∣manent
judgment. While we look at them, in order to consider
them, they are changed and gone, and annihilated for ever. The
objects of science, and of all the steady judgments of the under∣standing,
must be permanent, unchangeable, always existent, and
liable neither to generation nor corruption, nor alteration of any
kind. Such are the species or specific essences of things. Man is
perpetually changing every particle of his body; and every thought
of his mind is in continual flux and succession. But humanity, or
human nature, is always existent, is always the same, is never
generated, and is never corrupted. This, therefore, is the object of
science, reason, and understanding, as man is the object of sense,
and of those inconstant opinions which are founded upon sense. As
the objects of sense were apprehended to have an external existence,
independent of the act of sensation, so these objects of the under∣standing
were much more supposed to have an external existence in∣dependent
of the act of understanding. Those external essences
were, according to Plato, the exemplars, according to which the
Deity formed the world, and all the sensible objects that are in it.
The Deity comprehended within his infinite effence, all these species,
or eternal exemplars, in the same manner as he comprehended all
sensible objects.</P>
<P>Plato, however, seems to have regarded the first of those us
equally distinct with the second from what we would now call the
Ideas or Thoughts of the Divine Mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He calls them, indeed, Ideas, a word which, in him, in Aristotle, and all the other writers of earlier antiquity, signifies a Species, and is perfectly synonimous with that other word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, more frequently made use of by Aristotle. As, by some of the later sects of philosophers, particularly by the Stoics, all species, or specific essences, were regarded as mere creatures of the mind, formed by abstraction, which had no real existence external to the thoughts that conceived them, the word Idea came, by degrees, to its present signification, to mean, first, an abstract thought or conception; and afterwards, a thought or conception of any kind; and thus became synonymous with that other Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, from which it had originally a very different meaning. When the later Platonists, who lived at a time when the notion of the se∣parate existence of specific essences were universally exploded, began to comment upon the writings of Plato, and upon that strange fancy that, in his writings, there was a double doctrine; and that they were intended to seem to mean one thing, while at bottom they meant a very different, which the writings of no man in his senses ever were, or ever could be intended to do; they represented his doctrine as meaning no more, than that the Deity formed the world after what we would now call an Idea, or plan conceived in his own mind, in the same manner as any other artist. But, if Plato had meant to express no more than this most natural and simple of all notions, he might surely have expressed it more plainly, and would hardly, one would think, have talked of it with so much emphasis, as of something which it required the utmost reach of thought to comprehend. According to this representation, Plato's notion of Species, or Universals, was the same with that of Aristotle. Aristotle, however, does not seem to understand it as such; he bestows a great part of his Metaphysics upon confuting it, and opposes it in all his other works; nor does he, in any one of them, give the least hint, or insinuation, as if it could be suspected that, by the Ideas of Plato, was meant the thoughts or conceptions of the Divine Mind. Is it possible that he, who was twenty years in his school, should, during all that time, have misunder∣stood him, especially when his meaning was so very plain and obvious? Neither is this notion of the separate existence of Species, distinct both from the mind which conceives them, and from the sensible objects which are made to resemble them, one of those doctrines which Plato would but seldom have occasion to talk of. How∣ever it may be interpreted, it is the very basis of his philosophy; neither is there a single dialogue in all his works which does not refer to it. Shall we suppose, that that great philosopher, who appears to have been so much superior to his master in every thing but eloquence, wilfully, and upon all occasions, misrepresented, not one of the deep and mysterious doctrines of the philosophy of Plato, but the first and most fundamen∣tal principle of all his reasonings; when the writings of Plato were in the hands of everybody; when his followers and disciples were spread all over Greece; when almost every Athenian of distinction, that was nearly of the same age with Aristotle, must have been bred in his school; when Speusippus, the nephew and successor of Plato, as well as Xenocrates, who continued the school in the Academy, at the same time that Aristotle held his in the Lyceum, must have been ready, at all times, to expose and affront him for such gross disingenuity. Does not Cicero, does not Seneca under∣stand this doctrine in the same manner as Aristotle has represented it? Is there any author in all antiquity who seems to understand it otherwise, earlier than Plutarch, an author, who seems to have been as bad a critic in philosophy as in history, and to have taken every thing at second-hand in both, and who lived after the origin of that eclectic philosophy, from whence the later Platonists arose, and who seems himself to have been one of that sect? Is there any one passage in any Greek author, near the time of Aristotle and Plato, in which the word Idea is used in its present meaning, to signify a thought or conception? Are not the words, which in all languages express reality or existence, directly opposed to those which express thought, or conception only? Or, is there any other difference betwixt a thing that exists, and a thing that does not exist, except this, that the one is a mere conception, and that the other is something more than a conception? With what propriety, therefore, could Plato talk of those eternal species, as of the only things which had any real existence, if they were no more than the conceptions of the Divine Mind? Had not the Deity, according to Plato, as well as according to the Stoics, from all eternity, the idea of every individual, as well as of every species, and of the state in which every indi∣vidual was to be, in each different instance of its existence? Were not all the divine ideas, therefore, of each individual, or of all the different states, which each indi∣vidual was to be in during the course of its existence, equally eternal and unalterable with those of the species? With what sense, therefore, could Plato say, that the first were eternal, because the Deity had conceived them from all eternity, since he had conceived the others from all eternity too, and since his ideas of the Species could, in this respect, have no advantage of those of the individual? Does not Plato, in many different places, talk of the Ideas of Species or Universals as innate, and having been impressed upon the mind in its state of pre-existence, when it had an opportu∣nity of viewing these Species as they are in themselves, and not as they are expressed in their copies, or representative upon earth? But if the only place of the existence of those Species was the Divine Mind, will not this suppose, that Plato either ima∣gined, like Father Malbranche, that in its state of pre-existence, the mind saw all things in God; or that it was itself an emanation of the Divinity? That he main∣tained the first opinion, will not be pretended by any body who is at all versed in the history of science. That enthusiastic notion, though it may seem to be favoured by some passages in the Fathers, was never, it is well known, coolly and literally main∣tained by any body before that Cartesian philosopher. That the human mind was itself an emanation of the Divine, though it was the doctrine of the Stoics, was by no means that of Plato; though, upon the notion of a pretended double doctrine, the contrary has lately been asserted. According to Plato, the Deity formed the soul of the world out of that substance which is always the same, that is, out of Species or Universals; out of that which is always different, that is, out of corporeal sub∣stances; and out of a substance that was of a middle nature between these, which it is not easy to understand what he meant by. Out of a part of the same composition, he made those inferior intelligences who animated the celestial spheres, to whom he delivered the remaining part of it, to form from thence the souls of men and ani∣mals. The souls of those inferior deities, though made out of a similar substance or composition, were not regarded as parts, or emanations of that of the world; nor were those of animals, in the same manner, regarded as parts or emanations of those inferior deities; much less were any of them regarded as parts, or emanations of the great Author of all things.</NOTE>, and even to have supposed,
<PB N="120" REF="209"/>
that they had a particular place of existence, beyond the sphere of
the visible corporeal world; though this has been much controverted,
<PB N="121" REF="210"/>
both by the later Platonists, and by some very judicious modern
critics, who have followed the interpretation of the later Platonists,
<PB N="122" REF="211"/>
as what did most honour to the judgment of that renowned philoso∣pher.
All the objects in this world, continued he, are particular
and individual. Here, therefore, the human mind has no oppor∣tunity
of seeing any Species, or Universal Nature. Whatever ideas
it has, therefore, of such beings, for it plainly has them, it must
derive from the memory of what it has seen, in some former period
of its existence, when it had an opportunity of visiting the place or
Sphere of Universals. For some time after it is immersed in the
body, during its infancy, its childhood, and a great part of its
youth, the violence of those passions which it derives from the
body, and which are all directed to the particular and individual ob∣jects
of this world, hinder it from turning its attention to those
Universal Natures, with which it had been conversant in the world
from whence it came. The Ideas, of these, therefore, seem, in
this first period of its existence here, to be overwhelmed in the con∣fusion
of those turbulent emotions, and to be almost entirely wiped
out of its remembrance. During the continuance of this state, it is
incapable of Reasoning, Science and Philosophy, which are con∣versant
about Universals. Its whole attention is turned towards par∣ticular
objects, concerning which, being directed by no general no∣tions,
it forms many vain and false opinions, and is filled with
error, perplexity, and confusion. But, when age has abated the vio∣lence
of its passions, and composed the confusion of its thoughts, it
then becomes more capable of reflection, and of turning its atten∣tion
to those almost forgotten ideas of things with which it had been
conversant in the former state of its existence. All the particular ob∣jects
in this sensible world, being formed after the eternal exem∣plars
in that intellectual world, awaken, upon account of their re∣semblance,
insensibly, and by slow degrees, the almost obliterated
ideas of these last. The beauty, which is shared in different degrees
among terrestrial objects, revives the same idea of that Universal
Nature of beauty which exists in the intellectual world: particular acts
<PB N="123" REF="212"/>
of justice, of the universal nature of justice; particular reasonings,
and particular sciences, of the universal nature of science, and rea∣soning;
particular roundnesses, of the universal nature of roundness;
particular squares, of the universal nature of squareness. Thus sci∣ence,
which is conversant about Universals, is derived from memory;
and to instruct any person concerning the general nature of any
subject, is no more than to awaken in him the remembrance
of what he formerly knew about it. This both Plato and Socrates
imagined they could still further confirm, by the fallacious experi∣ment,
which shewed, that a person might be led to discover himself,
without any information, any general truth, of which he was before
ignorant, merely by being asked a number of properly arranged and
connected questions concerning it.</P>
<P>The more the soul was accustomed to the consideration of those
Universal Natures, the less it was attached to any particular and indi∣vidual
objects; it approached the nearer to the original perfection of its
nature, from which, according to this philosophy, it had fallen. Philo∣sophy,
which accustoms it to consider the general Essence of things only,
and to abstract from all their particular and sensible circumstances, was,
upon this account, regarded as the great purisier of the soul. As death
separated the soul from the body, and from the bodily senses and pas∣sions,
it restored it to that intellectual world, from whence it had
originally descended, where no sensible Species called off its attention
from those general Essences of things. Philosophy, in this life,
habituating it to the same considerations, brings it, in some degree,
to that state of happiness and perfection, to which death restores the
souls of just men in a life to come.</P>
<P>Such was the doctrine of Plato concerning the Species or Specific
Essence of things. This, at least, is what his words seem to import,
and thus he is understood by Aristotle, the most intelligent and the
<PB N="124" REF="213"/>
most renowned of all his disciples. It is a doctrine, which, like
many of the other doctrines of abstract Philosophy, is more co∣herent
in the expression than in the idea; and which seems to have
arisen, more from the nature of language, than from the nature of
things. With all its imperfections it was excusable, in the begin∣nings
of philosophy, and is not a great deal more remote from the
truth, than many others which have since been substituted in its
room by some of the greatest pretenders to accuracy and precision.
Mankind have had, at all times, a strong propensity to realize their
own abstractions, of which we shall immediately see an example, in
the notions of that very philosopher who first exposed the ill∣grounded
foundation of those Ideas, or Universals, of Plato and
Timaeus. To explain the nature, and to account for the origin of
general Ideas, is, even at this day, the greatest difficulty in abstract
philosophy. How the human mind, when it reasons concerning the
general nature of triangles, should either conceive, as Mr. Locke
imagines it does, the idea of a triangle, which is neither obtusan∣gular,
nor rectangular, nor acutangular; but which was at once
both none and all of those together; or should, as Malbranche thinks
necessary for this purpose, comprehend at once, within its sinite
capacity, all possible triangles of all possible forms and dimensions,
which are infinite in number, is a question, to which it is surely not
easy to give a satisfactory answer. Malbranche, to solve it, had re∣course
to the enthusiastic and unintelligible notion of the intimate
union of the human mind with the divine, in whose infinite essence
the immensity of such species could alone be comprehended; and in
which alone, therefore, all finite intelligences could have an oppor∣tunity
of viewing them. If, after more than two thousand years
reasoning about this subject, this ingenious and sublime philosopher
was forced to have recourse to so strange a fancy, in order to ex∣plain
it, can we wonder that Plato, in the very first dawnings of
science, should, for the same purpose, adopt an hypothesis, which
<PB N="125" REF="214"/>
has been thought, without much reason, indeed, to have some affi∣nity
to that of Malbranche, and which is not more out of the
way?</P>
<P>What seems to have missed those early philosophers, was, the
notion, which appears, at first, natural enough, that those things,
cut of which any object is composed, must exist antecedent to that
object. But the things out of which all particular objects seem to
be composed, are the stuff or matter of those objects, and the form
or specific Essence, which determines them to be of this or that class
of things. These, therefore, it was thought, must have existed an∣tecedent
to the object which was made up between them. Plato,
who held, that the sensible world, which, according to him, is the
world of individuals, was made in time, necessarily conceived, that
both the universal matter, the object of a spurious reason, and the
specific essence, the object of proper reason and philosophy out of
which it was composed, must have had a separate existence from all
eternity. This intellectual world, very different from the intellec∣tual
world of Cudworth, though much of the language of the one
has been borrowed from that of the other, was necessarily, and al∣ways
existent; whereas the sensible world owed its origin to the free
will and bounty of its author.</P>
<P>A notion of this kind, as long as it is expressed in very general
language; as long as it is not much rested upon; nor attempted to
be very particularly and distinctly explained, passes easily enough,
through the indolent imagination, accustomed to substitute words
in the room of ideas; and if the words seem to hang easily together,
requiring no great precision in the ideas. It vanishes, indeed; is
discovered to be altogether incomprehensible, and eludes the grasp
of the imagination, upon an attentive consideration. It requires,
however, an attentive consideration; and if it had been as fortunate
<PB N="126" REF="215"/>
as many other opinions of the same kind, and about the same sub∣ject,
it might, without examination, have continued to be the cur∣rent
philosophy for a century or two. Aristotle, however, seems
immediately to have discovered, that it was impossible to conceive,
as actually existent, either that general matter, which was not de∣termined
by any particular species, or those species which were not
embodied, if one may say so, in some particular portion of matter.
Aristotle, too, held, as we have already observed, the eternity of
the sensible world. Though he held, therefore, that all sensible ob∣jects
were made up of two principles, both of which, he calls,
equally, substances, the matter and the specific essence, he was not
obliged to hold, like Plato, that those principles existed prior in the
order of time to the objects which they afterwards composed. They
were prior, he said, in nature, but not in time, according to a dis∣tinction
which was of use to him upon some other occasions. He
distinguished, too, betwixt actual and potential existence. By the
first, he seems to have understood, what is commonly meant, by ex∣istence
or reality; by the second, the bare possibility of existence.
His meaning, I say, seems to amount to this; though he does not
explain it precisely in this manner. Neither the material Essence of
body could, according to him, exist actually without being deter∣mined
by some specific Essence, to some particular class of things,
nor any specific Essence without being embodied in some particular
portion of matter. Each of these two principles, however, could
exist potentially in this separate state. That matter existed poten∣tially,
which, being endowed with a particular form, could be
brought into actual existence; and that form, which, by being em∣bodied
in a particular portion of matter, could, in the same man∣ner,
be called forth into the class of complete realities. This poten∣tial
existence of matter and form, he sometimes talks of, in expres∣sions
which very much resemble those of Plato, to whose notion of
separate Essence it bears a very great assinity.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="216"/>
Aristotle, who seems in many things original, and who endea∣voured
to seem to be so in all things, added the principle of priva∣tion
to those of matter and form, which he had derived from the
ancient Pythagorean school. When Water is changed into Air, the
transmutation is brought about by the material principle of those
two elements being deprived of the form of Water, and then assum∣ing
the form of Air. Privation, therefore, was a third principle op∣posite
to form, which entered into the generation of every Species,
which was always from some other Species. It was a principle of
generation, but not of composition, as is obvious.</P>
<P>The Stoics, whose opinions were, in all the different parts of phi∣losophy,
either the same with, or very nearly allied to those of Aris∣totle
and Plato, though often disguised in very different language,
held, that all things, even the elements themselves, were compound∣ed
of two principles, upon one of which depended all the active;
and upon the other, all the passive powers of these bodies. The
last of these, they called the Matter; the first, the Cause, by which
they meant the very same thing which Aristotle and Plato under∣stood,
by their specific Essences. Matter, according to the Stoics,
could have no existence separate from the cause or essicient principle
which determined it to some particular class of things. Neither
could the efficient principle exist separately from the material, in
which it was always necessarily embodied. Their opinion, there∣fore,
so far coincided with that of the old Peripatetics. The effici∣ent
principle, they said, was the Deity. By which they meant,
that it was a detached portion of the etherial and divine nature,
which penetrated all things, that constituted what Plato would have
called the specific Essence of each individual object; and so far their
opinion coincides pretty nearly with that of the latter Platonists,
who held, that the specific Essences of all things were detached por∣tions
of their created deity, the soul of the world; and with that of
<PB N="128" REF="217"/>
some of the Arabian and Scholastic Commentators of Aristctle, who
held, that the substantial forms of all things descended from those
Divine Essences which animated the Celestial Spheres. Such was
the doctrine of the four principal Sects of the ancient Philosophers,
concerning the specific Essences of things, of the old Pythagoreans, of
the Academical, Peripatetic, and Stoical Sects.</P>
<P>As this doctrine of specific Essences seems naturally enough to
have arisen from that ancient system of Physics, which I have above
described, and which is, by no means, devoid of probability, so many
of the doctrines of that system, which seem to us, who have been
long accustomed to another, the most incomprehensible, necessarily
flow from this metaphysical notion. Such are those of generation,
corruption, and alteration; of mixture, condensation, and rarefaction.
A body was generated or corrupted, when it changed its specific Es∣sence,
and passed from one denomination to another. It was altered
when it changed only some of its qualities, but still retained the
same specific Essence, and the same denomination. Thus, when a
flower was withered, it was not corrupted; though some of its qua∣lities
were changed, it still retained the specific Essence, and therefore
justly passed under the denomination of a flower. But, when, in
the further progress of its decay, it crumbled into earth, it was cor∣rupted;
it lost the specific Essence, or substantial form of the flower,
and assumed that of the earth, and therefore justly changed its de∣nomination.</P>
<P>The specific Essence, or universal nature that was lodged in each
particular class of bodies, was not itself the object of any of our
senses, but could be perceived only by the understanding. It was
by the sensible qualities, however, that we judged of the specific Es∣sence
of each object. Some of these sensible qualities, therefore,
we regarded as essential, or such as showed, by their presence or ab∣sence,
<PB N="129" REF="218"/>
the presence or absence of that essential form from which
they necessarily flowed: Others were accidental, or such whose
presence or absence had no such necessary consequences. The first
of these two sorts of qualities was called Properties; the second, Ac∣cidents.</P>
<P>In
the Specific Essence of each object itself, they distinguished two
parts; one of which was peculiar and characteristical of the class of
things of which that particular object was an individual, the other
was common to it with some other higher classes of things. These
two parts were, to the Specific Essence, pretty much what the Mat∣ter
and the Specific Essence were to each individual body. The one,
which was called the Genus, was modified and determined by the
other, which was called the Specific Difference, pretty much in the
same manner as the universal matter contained in each body was
modified and determined by the Specific Essence of that particular
class of bodies. These four, with the Specific Essence or Species it∣self,
made up the number of the Five Universals, so well known in
the schools by the names of Genus, Species, Differentia, Proprium,
and Accidens.</P>

<P>THE mosl perfect imitation of an object of any kind, must in
all cases, it is evident, be another object of the same kind
made as exactly as possible after the same model. What, for ex∣ample,
would be the most perfect imitation of the carpet which
now lies before me?—Another carpet, certainly, wrought as exactly
as possible after the same pattern. But, whatever might be the merit
or beauty of this second carpet, it would not be supposed to derive
any from the circumstance of its having been made in imitation of the
first. This circumstance of its being not an original, but a copy,
would even be considered as some diminution of that merit; a greater
or smaller, in proportion as the object was of a nature to lay claim
to a greater or smaller degree of admiration. It would not much
diminish the merit of a common carpet, because in such trifling ob∣jects,
which at best can lay claim to so little beauty or merit of any
kind, we do not always think it worth while to affect originality:
it would diminish a good deal that of a carpet of very exquisite
workmanship. In objects of still greater importance, this exact, or,
as it would be called, this servile imitation, would be considered as
<PB N="134" REF="221"/>
the most unpardonable blemish. To build another St. Peter's, or St.
Paul's church, of exactly the same dimensions, proportions, and or∣naments
with the present buildings at Rome, or London, would be
supposed to argue such a miserable barrenness of genius and inven∣tion
as would disgrace the most expensive magnificence.</P>
<P>The exact resemblance of the correspondent parts of the same ob∣ject
is frequently considered as a beauty, and the want of it as a
deformity; as in the correspondent members of the human body,
in the opposite wings of the same building, in the opposite trees of
the same alley, in the correspondent compartments of the same piece
of carpet-work, or of the same flower-garden, in the chairs or tables
which stand in the correspondent parts of the same room, &amp;c. But
in objects of the same kind, which in other respects are regarded as
altogether separate and unconnected, this exact resemblance is seldom
considered as a beauty, nor the want of it as a deformity. A man,
and in the same manner a horse, is handsome or ugly, each of them,
on account of his own intrinsic beauty or deformity, without any
regard to their resembling or not resembling, the one, another man,
or the other, another horse. A set of coach-horses, indeed, is sup∣posed
to be handsomer when they are all exactly matched; but
each horse is, in this case, considered not as a separated and uncon∣nected
object, or as a whole by himself, but as a part of another
whole, to the other parts of which he ought to bear a certain corre∣spondence:
Separated from the set, he derives neither beauty from
his resemblance, nor deformity from his unlikeness to the other
horses which compose it.</P>
<P>Even in the correspondent parts of the same object, we frequently
require no more than a resemblance in the general outline. If the
inferior members of those correspondent parts are too minute to be
<PB N="135" REF="222"/>
seen distinctly, without a separate and di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinct examination of each
part by itself, as a separate and unconnected object, we should some∣times
even be displeased if the resemblance was carried beyond this
general outline. In the correspondent parts of a room we frequently
hang pictures of the same size; those pictures, however, resemble
one another in nothing but the frame, or, perhaps, in the general
character of the subject: If the one is a landscape, the other is a
landscape too; if the one represents a religious or a Bacchanalian
subject, its companion represents another of the same kind. No∣body
ever thought of repeating the same picture in each corre∣spondent
frame. The frame, and the general character of two or
three pictures, is as much as the eye can comprehend at one view,
or from one station. Each picture, in order to be seen distinctly,
and understood thoroughly, must be viewed from a particular station,
and examined by itself as a separate and unconnected object. In a
hall or portico, adorned with statues, the nitches, or perhaps the
pedestals, may exactly resemble one another, but the statues are al∣ways
different. Even the masks which are sometimes carried upon
the different key-stones of the same arcade, or of the correspondent
doors and windows of the same front, though they may all resemble
one another in the general outline, yet each of them has always its
own peculiar features, and a grimace of its own. There are some
Gothic buildings in which the correspondent windows resemble one
another only in the general outline, and not in the smaller ornaments
and subdivisions. These are different in each, and the architect had
considered them as too minute to be seen distinctly, without a par∣ticular
and separate examination of each window by itself, as a se∣parate
and unconnected object. A variety of this sort, however, I
think, is not agreeable. In objects which are susceptible only of a
certain inferior order of beauty, such as the frames of pictures, the
nitches or the pedestals of statues, &amp;c. there seems frequently to
<PB N="136" REF="223"/>
be affectation in the study of variety, of which the merit is scarcely
ever sufficient to compensate the want of that perspicuity and
distinctness, of that easiness to be comprehended and remembered,
which is the natural effect of exact uniformity. In a portico of the
Corinthian or Ionic order, each column resembles every other, not
only in the general outline, but in all the minutest ornaments;
though some of them, in order to be seen distinctly, may require a
separate and dictinct examination in each column, and in the enta∣blature
of each intercolumnation. In the inlaid tables, which, ac∣cording
to the present fashion, are sometimes fixed in the corre∣spondent
parts of the same room, the pictures only are different in
each. All the other more frivolous and fanciful ornaments are
commonly, so far at least as I have observed the fashion, the same
in them all. Those ornaments, however, in order to be seen dis∣tinctly,
require a separate and distinct examination of each table.</P>
<P>The extraordinary resemblance of two natural objects, of twins,
for example, is regarded as a curious circumstance; which, though it
does not increase, yet does not diminish the beauty of either, con∣sidered
as a separate and unconnected object. But the exact re∣semblance
of two productions of art, seems to be always considered
as some diminution of the merit of at least one of them; as it seems
to prove, that one of them, at least, is a copy either of the other,
or of some other original. One may say, even of the copy of a
picture, that it derives its merit, not so much from its resemblance
to the original, as from its resemblance to the object which the ori∣ginal
was meant to resemable. The owner of the copy, so far from
setting any high value upon its resemblance to the original, is often
anxious to destroy any value or merit which it might derive from
this circumstance. He is often anxious to persuade both him∣self
and other people that it is not a copy, but an original, of
<PB N="137" REF="224"/>
which what passes for the original is only a copy. But, whatever
merit a copy may derive from its resemblance to the original,
an original can certainly derive none from the resemblance of its
copy.</P>
<P>But though a production of art seldom derives any merit from its
resemblance to another object of the same kind, it frequently derives
a great deal from its resemblance to an object of a different kind,
whether that object be a production of art or of nature. A painted
cloth, the work of some laborious Dutch artist, so curiously shaded
and coloured as to represent the pile and softness of a woollen one,
might derive some merit from its resemblance even to the sorry car∣pet
which now lies before me. The copy might, and probably
would, in this case, be of much greater value than the original.
But if this carpet was represented as spread, either upon a floor or
upon a table, and projecting from the back ground of the picture,
with exact observation of perspective, and of light and shade, the
merit of the imitation would be still greater.</P>
<P>In Painting, a plain surface of one kind is made to resemble, not
only a plain surface of another, but all the three dimensions of a
solid substance. In Statuary and Sculpture, a solid substance of one
kind, is made to resemble a solid substance of another. The dispa∣rity
between the object imitating, and the object imitated, is much
greater in the one art than in the other; and the pleasure arising
from the imitation seems to be greater in proportion as this disparity
is greater.</P>
<P>In Painting, the imitation frequently pleases, though the original
object be indifferent, or even offensive. In Statuary and Sculpture it
is otherwise. The imitation seldom pleases, unless the original ob∣ject
<PB N="138" REF="225"/>
be in a very high degree either great, or beautiful, or interesting.
A butcher's stall, or a kitchen-dresser, with the objects which they
commonly present, are not certainly the happiest subjects, even for
Painting. They have, however, been represented with so much
care and success by some Dutch masters, that it is impossible to view
the pictures without some degree of pleasure. They would be most
absurd subjects for Statuary or Sculpture, which are, however, ca∣pable
of representing them. The picture of a very ugly or deformed
man, such as Aesop, or Scarron, might not make a disagreeable
piece of furniture. The statue certainly would. Even a vulgar or∣dinary
man or woman, engaged in a vulgar ordinary action, like
what we see with so much pleasure in the pictures of Rembrant,
would be too mean a subject for Statuary. Jupiter, Hercules, and
Apollo, Venus and Diana, the Nymphs and the Graces, Bacchus,
Mercury, Antinous and Meleager, the miserable death of Laocoon,
the melancholy fate of the children of Niobe, the Wrestlers, the
fighting, the dying gladiator, the figures of gods and goddesses, of
heroes and heroines, the most perfect forms of the human body,
placed either in the noblest attitudes, or in the most interesting situ∣ations
which the human imagination is capable of conceiving, are
the proper, and therefore have always been the favourite subjects of
Statuary: that art cannot, without degrading itself, stoop to repre∣sent
any thing that is offensive, or mean, or even indifferent.
Painting is not so disdainful; and, though capable of representing the
noblest objects, it ecan, without forseiting its title to please, submit
to imitate those of a much more humble nature. The merit of the
imitation alone, and without any merit in the imitated object, is
eapable of supporting the dignity of Painting: it cannot support
that of Statuary. There would seem, therefore, to be more merit
in the one species of imitation than in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="226"/>
In Statuary, scarcely any drapery is agreeable. The best of the an∣cient
statues were either altogether naked; or almost naked and those
of which any considerable part of the body is covered, are repre∣sented
as clothed in wet linen—a species of clothing which most
certainly never was agreeable to the fashion of any country. This
drapery too is drawn so tight, as to express beneath its narrow fold∣ings
the exact form and outline of any limb, and almost of every
muscle of the body. The clothing which thus approached the
nearest to no clothing at all, had, it seems, in the judgment of the
great artists of antiquity, been that which was most suitable to Sta∣tuary.
A great painter of the Roman school, who had formed his
manner almost entirely upon the sludy of the ancient statues, imi∣tated
at first their drapery in his pictures; but he soon found that in
Painting it had the air of meanness and poverty, as if the persons
who wore it could scarce afford clothes enough to cover them; and
that larger folds, and a looser and more slowing drapery, were more
suitable to the nature of his art. In Painting, the imitation of so
very inferior an object as a suit of clothes is capable of pleasing;
and, in order to give this object all the magnificence of which it is
capable, it is necessary that the folds should be large, loose,
and flowing. It is not necessary in Painting that the exact
form and outline of every limb, and almost of every muscle of
the body, should be expressed beneath the folds of the drapery;
it is sufficient if these are so disposed as to indicate in general the
situation and attitude of the principal limbs. Painting, by the mere
force and merit of its imitation, can venture, without the hazard of
displeasing, to substitute, upon many occasions, the inferior in the
room of the superior object, by making the one, in this manner,
cover and entirely conceal a great part of the other. Statuary can
seldom venture to do this, but with the utmost reserve and caution;
and the same drapery, which is noble and magnificent in the one
<PB N="140" REF="227"/>
art, appears clumsy and awkward in the other. Some modern artists,
however, have attempted to introduce into Statuary the drapery
which is peculiar to Painting. It may not, perhaps, upon every oc∣casion,
be quite so ridiculous as the marble periwigs in Westminster
Abbey: but, if it does not always appear clumsy and awkward, it is
at best always insipid and uninteresting.</P>
<P>It is not the want of colouring which hinders many things from
pleasing in Statuary, which please in Painting; it is the want of
that degree of disparity between the imitating and the imitated ob∣ject,
which, is necessary, in order to render interesting the imita∣tion,
of an object which is itself not interesting. Colouring, when
added to Statuary, so far from increasing, destroys almost en∣tirely
the pleasure which we receive from the imitation; because
it takes away the great source of that pleasure, the disparity be∣tween
the imitating and the imitated object. That one solid and
coloured object should exactly resemble another solid and coloured
object, seems to be a matter of no great wonder or admiration. A
painted statue, though it certainly may resemble a human figure
much more exactly than any statue which is not painted, is gene∣rally
acknowledged to be a disagreeable, and even an offensive ob∣ject;
and so far are we from being pleased with this superior like∣ness,
that we are never satisfied with it; and, after viewing it again
and again, we always find that it is not equal to what we are dis∣posed
to imagine it might have been: though it should seem to
want scarce any thing but the life, we could not pardon it for thus
wanting what it is altogether impossible it should have. The works
of Mrs. Wright, a self-taught artist of great merit, are perhaps more
perfect in this way than any thing I have ever seen. They do ad∣mirably
well to be seen now and then as a show; but the best of
them we should find, if brought home to our own house, and placed
in a situation where it was to come often into view, would make,
<PB N="141" REF="228"/>
instead of an ornamental, a most offensive piece of household fur∣niture.
Painted statues, accordingly, are universally reprobated, and
we scarce ever meet with them. To colour the eyes of statues is not
altogether so uncommon: even this, however, is disapproved by all
good judges. “I cannot bear it,” (a gentleman used to say, of great
knowledge and judgment in this art,) “I cannot bear it; I always
“want them to speak to me.”</P>
<P>Artificial fruits and flowers sometimes imitate so exactly the na∣tural
objects which they represent, that they frequently deceive us.
We soon grow weary of them, however; and, though they seem to
want nothing but the freshness and the flavour of natural fruits and
flowers, we cannot pardon them, in the same manner, for thus
wanting what it is altogether impossible they should have. But we
do not grow weary of a good flower and fruit painting. We do
not grow weary of the foliage of the Corinthian capital, or of the
flowers which sometimes ornament the frize of that order. Such
imitations, however, never deceive us; their resemblance to the ori∣ginal
objects is always much inferior to that of artificial fruits and
flowers. Such as it is, however, we are contented with it; and,
where there is such disparity between the imitating and the imitated
objects, we find that it is as great as it can be, or as we expect that
it should be. Paint that foliage and those flowers with the natural
colours, and, instead of pleasing more, they will please much less.
The resemblance, however, will be much greater; but the disparity
between the imitating and the imitated objects will be so much less,
that even this superior resemblance will not satisfy us. Where the
disparity is very great, on the contrary, we are often contented with
the most imperfect resemblance; with the very imperfect re∣semblance,
for example, both as to figure and colour, of fruits and
flowers in shell-work.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="229"/>
It may be observed, however, that, though in Sculpture the imi∣tation
of flowers and foliage pleases as an ornament of architecture,
as a part of the dress which is to set off the beauty of a different
and a more important object, it would not please alone, or as a se∣parate
and unconnected object, in the same manner as a fruit and
flower painting pleases. Flowers and foliage, how elegant and beau∣tiful
soever, are not sufficiently interesting; they have not dignity
enough, if I may say so, to be proper subjects for a piece of Sculp∣ture,
which is to please alone, and not as the ornamental appendage
of some other object.</P>
<P>In Tapestry and Needle-work, in the same manner as in Painting,
a plain surface is sometimes made to represent all the three dimen∣sions
of a solid substance. But both the shuttle of the weaver, and
the needle of the embroiderer, are instruments of imitation so much
inferior to the pencil of the painter, that we are not surprised to find
a proportionable inferiority in their productions. We have all more
or less experience that they usually are much inferior; and, in ap∣preciating
a piece of Tapestry or Needle-work, we never compare the
imitation of either with that of a good picture, for it never could
stand that comparison, but with that of other pieces of Tapestry or
Needle-work. We take into consideration, not only the disparity
between the imitating and the imitated object, but the awkwardness of
the instruments of imitation; and if it is as well as any thing that
can be expected from these, if it is better than the greater part of
what actually comes from them, we are often not only contented
but highly pleased.</P>
<P>A good painter will often execute in a few days a subject which
would employ the best tapestry-weaver for many years; though, in
proportion to his time, therefore, the latter is always much worse
<PB N="143" REF="230"/>
paid than the former, yet his work in the end comes commonly
much dearer to market. The great expence of good Tapestry, the
circumstance which confines it to the palaces of princes and great
lords, gives it, in the eyes of the greater part of people, an air of
riches and magnificence, which contributes still further to compensate
the imperfection of its imitation. In arts which address themselves,
not to the prudent and the wise, but to the rich and the great, to
the proud and the vain, we ought not to wonder if the appearance
of great expence, of being what few people can purchase, of being
one of the surest characteristics of great fortune, should often stand
in the place of exquisite beauty, and contribute equally to recom∣mend
their productions. As the idea of expence seems often to
embellish, so that of cheapness seems as frequently to tarnish the
lustre even of very agreeable objects. The difference between real
and false jewels is what even the experienced eye of a jeweller can
sometimes with difficulty distinguish. Let an unknown lady, how∣ever,
come into a public assembly, with a head-dress which ap∣pears
to be very richly adorned with diamonds, and let a jeweller
only whisper in our ear that they are all false stones, not only the
lady will immediately sink in our imagination from the rank of a
princess to that of a very ordinary woman, but the head-dress, from
an object of the most splendid magnificence, will at once become an
impertinent piece of tawdry and tinsel sinery.</P>
<P>It was some years ago the fashion to ornament a garden with yew
and holly trees, clipped into the artificial shapes of pyramids, and
columns, and vases, and obelisks. It is now the fashion to ridicule
this taste as unnatural. The figure of a pyramid or obelisk, how∣ever,
is not more unnatural to a yew-tree than to a block of por∣phyry
or marble. When the yew-tree is presented to the eye in this
artificial shape, the gardener does not mean that it should be under∣stood
<PB N="144" REF="231"/>
to have grown in that shape: he means, first, to give it the
same beauty of regular figure, which pleases so much in porphyry
and marble; and, secondly, to imitate in a growing tree the orna∣ments
of those precious materials: he means to make an object of
one kind resemble another object of a very different kind; and to
the original beauty of figure to join the relative beauty of imitation:
but the disparity between the imitating and the imitated object is the
foundation of the beauty of imitation. It is because the one object
does not naturally resemble the other, that we are so much pleased
with it, when by art it is made to do so. The shears of the gar∣dener,
it may be said, indeed, are very clumsy instruments of Sculp∣ture.
They are so, no doubt, when employed to imitate the figures
of men, or even of animals. But in the simple and regular forms
of pyramids, vases, and obelisks, even the shears of the gardener do
well enough. Some allowance too is naturally made for the neces∣sary
imperfection of the instrument, in the same manner as in Ta∣pestry
and Needle-work. In short, the next time you have an op∣portunity
of surveying those out-of-fashion ornaments, endeavour
only to let yourself alone, and to restrain for a few minutes the
foolish passion for playing the critic, and you will be sensible that
they are not without some degree of beauty; that they give the air
of neatness and correct culture at least to the whole garden; and
that they are not unlike what the “retired leisure, that” (as Milton
says) “in trim gardens takes his pleasure,” might be amused with.
What then, it may be said, has brought them into such universal
disrepute among us? In a pyramid or obelisk of marble, we know
that the materials are expensive, and that the labour which wrought
them into that shape must have been still more so. In a pyramid
or obelisk of yew, we know that the materials could cost very
little, and the labour still less. The former are ennobled by their ex∣pence;
the latter degraded by their cheapness. In the cabbage-garden
<PB N="145" REF="232"/>
of a tallow-chandler we may sometimes perhaps have seen as many
columns and vases, and other ornaments in yew, as there are in marble
and porphyry at Versailles: it is this vulgarity which has disgraced
them. The rich and the great, the proud and the vain, will not admit
into their gardens an ornament which the meanest of the people can
have as well as they. The taste for these ornaments came originally
from France; where, notwithstanding that inconstancy of fashion
with which we sometimes reproach the natives of that country, it
still continues in good repute. In France, the condition of the infe∣rior
ranks of people is seldom so happy as it frequently is in Eng∣land;
and you will there seldom find even pyramids and obelisks of
yew in the garden of a tallow-chandler. Such ornaments, not hav∣ing
in that country been degraded by their vulgarity, have not yet
been excluded from the gardens of princes and great lords.</P>
<P>The works of the great masters in Statuary and Painting, it
is to be observed, never produce their effect by deception. They
never are, and it never is intended that they should be mistaken for
the real objects which they represent. Painted Statuary may some∣times
deceive an inattentive eye: proper Statuary never does. The
little pieces of perspective in Painting, which it is intended should
please by deception, represent always some very simple, as well as
insignificant, object; a roll of paper, for example, or the steps of
a staircase, in the dark corner of some passage or gallery. They are
generally the works too of some very inferior artists. After being seen
once, and producing the little surprise which it is meant they should
excite, together with the mirth which commonly accompanies it,
they never please more, but appear ever after insipid and tire∣some.</P>
<P>The
proper pleasure which we derive from those two imitative
arts, so far from being the effect of deception, is altogether incom∣patible
<PB N="146" REF="233"/>
with it. That pleasure is founded altogether upon our won∣der
at seeing an object of one kind represent so well an object of a
very different kind, and upon our admiration of the art which sur∣mounts
so happily that disparity which Nature had established be∣tween
them. The nobler works of Statuary and Painting appear to
us a sort of wonderful phaenomena, differing in this respect from
the wonderful phaenomena of Nature, that they carry, as it were,
their own explication along with them, and demonstrate, even to
the eye, the way and manner in which they are produced. The
eye, even of an unskilful spectator, immediately discerns, in some
measure, how it is that a certain modification of figure in Statuary,
and of brighter and darker colours in Painting, can represent, with
so much truth and vivacity, the actions, passions, and behaviour of
men, as well as a great variety of other objects. The pleasing
wonder of ignorance is accompanied with the still more pleasing
satisfaction of science. We wonder and are amazed at the effect;
and we are pleased ourselves, and happy to find that we can com∣prehend,
in some measure, how that wonderful effect is produced.</P>
<P>A good looking-glass represents the objects which are set before
it with much more truth and vivacity than either Statuary or Paint∣ing.
But, though the science of optics may explain to the under∣standing,
the looking-glass itself does not at all demonstrate to the
eye how this effect is brought about. It may excite the wonder of
ignorance; and in a clown, who had never beheld a looking-glass
before, I have seen that wonder rise almost to rapture and extasy;
but it cannot give the satisfaction of science. In all looking-glasses
the effects are produced by the same means, applied exactly in the
same manner. In every different statue and picture the effects are
produced; though by similar, yet not by the same means; and those
means too are applied in a different manner in each. Every good
statue and picture is a fresh wonder, which at the same time carries,
<PB N="147" REF="234"/>
in some measure, its own explication along with it. After a little
use and experience, all looking-glasses cease to be wonders alto∣gether;
and even the ignorant become so familiar with them, as not
to think that their effects require any explication. A looking-glass,
besides, can represent only present objects; and, when the wonder is
once fairly over, we choose, in all cases, rather to contemplate the
substance than to gaze at the shadow. One's own face becomes then
the most agreeable object which a looking-glass can represent to us,
and the only object which we do not soon grow weary with looking
at; it is the only present object of which we can see only the sha∣dow;
whether handsome or ugly, whether old or young, it is the
face of a friend always, of which the features correspond exactly
with whatever sentiment, emotion, or passion we may happen at that
moment to feel.</P>
<P>In Statuary, the means by which the wonderful effect is brought
about appear more simple and obvious than in Painting; where the
disparity between the imitating and the imitated object being much
greater, the art which can conquer that greater disparity appears evi∣dently,
and almost to the eye, to be founded upon a much deeper
science, or upon principles much more abstruse and profound.
Even in the meanest subjects we can often trace with pleasure the
ingenious means by which Painting furmounts this disparity. But
we cannot do this in Statuary, because the disparity not being so
great, the means do not appear so ingenious. And it is upon this
account, that in Painting we are often delighted with the represent∣ation
of many things, which in Statuary would appear insipid, tire∣some,
and not worth the looking at.</P>
<P>It ought to be observed, however, that though in Statuary the
are of imitation appears, in many respects, inferior to what it is in
<PB N="148" REF="235"/>
Painting, yet, in a room ornamented with both statues and pic∣tures
of nearly equal merit, we shall generally find that the statues
draw off our eye from the pictures. There is generally but one, or
little more than one, point of view from which a picture can be
seen with advantage, and it always presents to the eye precisely the
same object. There are many different points of view from which
a statue may be seen with equal advantage, and from each it presents
a different object. There is more variety in the pleasure which we
receive from a good statue, than in that which we receive from a
good picture; and one statue may frequently be the subject of many
good pictures or drawings, all different from one another. The
shadowy relief and projection, of a picture, besides, is much flattened,
and seems almost to vanish away altogether, when brought into
comparison with the real and solid body which stands by it. How
nearly soever these two arts may seem to be a-kin, they accord so
very ill with one another, that their different productions ought,
perhaps, scarce ever to be seen together.</P>

<P>AFTER the pleasures which arise from the gratification of the bo∣dily
appetites, there seem to be none more natural to man than
Music and Dancing. In the progress of art and improvement they
are, perhaps, the first and earliest pleasures of his own invention;
for those which arise from the gratification of the bodily appetites
cannot be said to be of his own invention. No nation has yet been
discovered so uncivilized as to be altogether without them. It
<PB N="149" REF="236"/>
seems even to be amongst the most barbarous nations that the use
and practice of them is both most frequent and most universal, as
among the negroes of Africa and the savage tribes of America. In
civilized nations, the inferior ranks of people have very little leisure,
and the superior ranks have many other amusements; neither the
one nor the other, therefore, can spend much of their time in Music
and Dancing. Among savage nations, the great body of the people
have frequently great intervals of leisure, and they have scarce any
other amusement; they naturally, therefore, spend a great part of
their time in almost the only one they have.</P>
<P>What the ancients called Rhythmus, what we call Time or Mea∣sure,
is the connecting principle of those two arts; Music consisting
in a succession of a certain sort of sounds, and Dancing in a suc∣cession
of a certain sort of steps, gestures, and motions, regulated
according to time or measure, and thereby formed into a sort of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whole or system; which in the one art is called a song or tune, and
in the other a dance; the time or measure of the dance correspond∣ing
always exactly with that of the song or tune which acco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣panies
and directs it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author's Observations on the Afsinity between Music, Dancing, and Poetry, are annexed to the end of Part III. of this Essay.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The human voice, as it is always the best, so it would naturally
be the first and earliest of all musical instruments: in singing, or in
its first attempts towards singing, it would naturally employ sounds as
similar as possible to those which it had been accustomed to; that is,
it would employ words of some kind or other, pronouncing them only
in time and measure, and generally with a more melodious tone than
had been usual in common conversation. Those words, however,
might not, and probably would not, for a long time have any mean∣ing,
but might resemble the syllables which we make use of in
<PB N="150" REF="237"/>
<HI>sol-faing,</HI> or the <HI>derry-down-down</HI> of our common ballads; and
serve only to assist the voice in forming sounds proper to be modu∣lated
into melody, and to be lengthened or shortened according to
the time and measure of the tune. This rude form of vocal Music,
as it is by far the most simple and obvious, so it naturally would be
the first and earliest.</P>
<P>In the succession of ages it could not fail to occur, that in the
room of those unmeaning or musical words, if I may call them so,
might be substituted words which expressed some sense or meaning,
and of which the pronunciation might coincide as exactly with the
time and measure of the tune, as that of the musical words had
done before. Hence the origin of Verse or Poetry. The Verse
would for a long time be rude and imperfect. When the meaning
words fell short of the measure required, they would frequently be
eked out with the unmeaning ones, as is sometimes done in our
common ballads. When the public ear came to be so refined as to
reject, in all serious Poetry, the unmeaning words altogether, there
would still be a liberty assumed of altering and corrupting, upon
many occasions, the pronunciation of the meaning ones, for the sake
of accommodating them to the measure. The syllables which com∣posed
them would, for this purpose, sometimes be improperly length∣ened,
and sometimes improperly shortened; and though no un∣meaning
words were made use of, yet an unmeaning syllable would
sometimes be stuck to the beginning, to the end, or into the middle
of a word. All these expedients we find frequently employed in
the verses even of Chaucer, the father of the English Poetry. Many
ages might pass away before verse was commonly composed with
such correctness, that the usual and proper pronunciation of the words
alone, and without any other artifice, subjected the voice to the ob∣servation
of a time and measure, of the same kind with the time
and measure of Music.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="238"/>
The Verse would naturally express some sense which suited the
grave or gay, the joyous or melancholy humour of the tune which
it was sung to; being as it were blended and united with that tune,
it would seem to give sense and meaning to what otherwise might
not appear to have any, or at least any which could be clearly and
distinctly understood, without the accompaniment of such an ex∣plication.</P>
<P>A
pantomime dance may frequently answer the same purpose, and,
by representing some adventure in love or war, may seem to give
sense and meaning to a Music which might not otherwise appear to
have any. It is more natural to mimic, by gestures and motions, the
adventures of common life, than to express them in Verse or Poetry.
The thought itself is more obvious, and the execution is much more
easy. If this mimicry was accompanied by music, it would of its
own accord, and almost without any intention of doing so, accom∣modate,
in some measure, its different steps and movements to the
time and measure of the tune; especially if the same person both
sung the tune and performed the mimicry, as is said to be frequently
the case among the savage nations of Africa and America. Panto∣mime
Dancing might in this manner serve to give a distinct sense
and meaning to Music many ages before the invention, or at least
before the common use of Poetry. We hear little, accordingly, of
the Poetry of the savage nations of Africa and America, but a great
deal of their pantomime dances.</P>
<P>Poetry, however, is capable of expressing many things fully and
distinctly, which Dancing either cannot represent at all, or can re∣present
but obscurely and imperfectly; such as the reasonings and
judgments of the understanding; the ideas, fancies, and suspicions
of the imagination; the sentiments, emotions, and passions of the
<PB N="152" REF="239"/>
heart. In the power of expressing a meaning with clearness and
distinctness, Dancing is superior to Music, and Poetry to Dancing.</P>
<P>Of those three Sister Arts, which originally, perhaps, went always
together, and which at all times go frequently together, there are
two which can subsist alone, and separate srom their natural com∣panions,
and one which cannot. In the distinct observation of what
the ancients called Rhythmus, of what we call Time and Measure,
consists the essence both of Dancing and of Poetry or Verse; or the
characteristical quality which distinguishes the former from all other
motion and action, and the latter from all other discourse. But,
concerning the proportion between those intervals and divisions of
duration which constitute what is called time and measure, the ear,
it would seem, can judge with much more precision than the eye;
and Poetry, in the same manner as Music, addresses itself to the
ear, whereas Dancing addresses itself to the eye. In Dancing, the
rhythmus, the proper proportion, the time and measure of its mo∣tions,
cannot distinctly be perceived, unless they are marked by the
more distinct time and measure of Music. It is otherwise in Poetry;
no accompaniment is necessary to mark the measure of good Verse.
Music and Poetry, therefore, can each of them subsist alone; Dancing
always requires the accompaniment of Music.</P>
<P>It is Instrumental Music which can best subsist apart, and separate
from both Poetry and Dancing. Vocal Music, though it may, and
frequently does, consist of notes which have no distinct sense or
meaning, yet naturally calls for the support of Poetry. But
“Music, married to immortal Verse,” as Milton says, or even to
words of any kind which have a distinct sense or meaning, is ne∣cessarily
and essentially imitative. Whatever be the meaning of those
words, though, like many of the songs of ancient Greece, as well
<PB N="153" REF="240"/>
as some of those of more modern times, they may express merely
some maxims of prudence and morality, or may contain merely the
simple narrative of some important event, yet even in such didactic
and historical songs there will still be imitation; there will still be a
thing of one kind, which by art is made to resemble a thing of a
very different kind; there will still be Music imitating discourse;
there will still be rhythmus and melody, shaped and fashioned into
the form either of a good moral counsel, or of an amusing and inte∣resting
story.</P>
<P>In this first species of imitation, which being essential to, is there∣fore
inseparable from, all such Vocal Music, there may, and there
commonly is, added a second. The words may, and commonly do,
express the situation of some particular person, and all the sentiments
and passions which he feels from that situation. It is a joyous com∣panion
who gives vent to the gaiety and mirth with which wine,
festivity, and good company inspire him. It is a lover who com∣plains,
or hopes, or fears, or despairs. It is a generous man who
expresses either his gratitude for the favours, or his indignation at
the injuries, which may have been done to him. It is a warrior
who prepares himself to confront danger, and who provokes or de∣fies
his enemy. It is a person in prosperity who humbly returns
thanks for the goodness, or one in affliction who with contrition
implores the mercy and forgiveness, of that invisible Power to whom
he looks up as the Director of all the events of human life. The
situation may comprehend, not only one, but two, three, or more
persons; it may excite in them all either similar or opposite senti∣ments;
what is a subject of sorrow to one, being an occasion of joy
and triumph to another; and they may all express, sometimes sepa∣rately
and sometimes together, the particular way in which each of
them is affected, as in a duo, trio, or a chorus.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="241"/>
All this it may, and it frequently has been said is unnatural;
nothing being more so, than to sing when we are anxious to per∣suade,
or in earnest to express any very serious purpose. But it
should be remembered, that to make a thing of one kind resemble
another thing of a very different kind, is the very circumstance
which, in all the Imitative Arts, constitutcs the merits of imitation;
and that to shape, and as it were to bend, the measure and the me∣lody
of Music, so as to imitate the tone and the language of coun∣sel
and conversation, the accent and the style of emotion and passion,
is to make a thing of one kind resemble another thing of a very dif∣ferent
kind.</P>
<P>The tone and the movements of Music, though naturally very
different from those of conversation and passion, may, however, be
so managed as to seem to resemble them. On account of the great
disparity between the imitating and the imitated object, the mind in
this, as in the other cases, cannot only be contented, but delighted,
and even charmed and transported, with such an imperfect resemblance
as can be had. Such imitative Music, therefore, when sung to words
which explain and determine its meaning, may frequently appear to
be a very perfect imitation. It is upon this account, that even the
incomplete Music of a recitative seems to express sometimes all the fe∣dateness
and composure of serious but calm discourse, and sometimes
all the exquisite sensibility of the most interesting passion. The more
complete Music of an air is still superior, and, in the imitation of
the more animated passions, has one great advantage over every sort
of discourse, whether Prose or Poetry, which is not sung to Music.
In a person who is either much depressed by grief or enlivened by
joy, who is strongly affected either with love or hatred, with gra∣titude
or resentment, with admiration or contempt, there is com∣monly
one thought or idea which dwells upon his mind, which con∣tinually
<PB N="155" REF="242"/>
haunts him, which, when he has chaced it away, imme∣diately
returns upon him, and which in company makes him absent
and inattentive. He can think but of one object, and he cannot
repeat to them that object so frequently as it recurs upon him. He
takes refuge in solitude, where he can with freedom either indulge
the extasy or give way to the agony of the agreeable or disagreeable
passion which agitates him; and where he can repeat to himself, which
he does sometimes mentally, and sometimes even aloud, and almost
always in the same words, the particular thought which either de∣lights
or distresses him. Neither Prose nor Poetry can venture to
imitate those almost endless repetitions of passion. They may de∣scribe
them as I do now, but they dare not imitate them; they
would become most insufferably tiresome if they did. The Music
of a passionate air not only may, but frequently does, imitate them;
and it never makes its way so directly or so irresistibly to the heart
as when it does so. It is upon this account that the words of an
air, especially of a passionate one, though they are seldom very long,
yet are scarce ever sung straight an to the end, like those of a recitative;
but are almost always broken into parts, which are transposed and
repeated again and again, according to the fancy or judgment of the
composer. It is by means of such repetitions only, that Music can
exert those peculiar powers of imitation which distinguish it, and in
which it excels all the other Imitative Arts. Poetry and Eloquence,
it has accordingly been often observed, produce their effect always
by a connected variety and succession of different thoughts and ideas:
but Music frequently produces its effects by a repetition of the same
idea; and the same sense expressed in the same, or nearly the same,
combination of sounds, though at first perhaps it may make scarce
any impression upon us, yet, by being repeated again and again, it
comes at last gradually, and by little and little, to move, to agitate,
and to transport us.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="243"/>
To these powers of imitating, Music naturally, or rather neces∣sarily,
joins the happiest choice in the objects of its imitation. The
sentiments and passions which Music can best imitate are those
which unite and bind men together in society; the social, the decent,
the virtuous, the interesting and affecting, the amiable and agree∣able,
the awful and respectable, the noble, elevating, and command∣ing
passions. Grief and distress are interesting and affecting; hu∣manity
and compassion, joy and admiration, are amiable and agree∣able;
devotion is awful and respectable; the generous contempt of
danger, the honourable indignation at injustice, are noble, elevating,
and commanding. But it is these and such like passions which
Music is fittest for imitating, and which it in fact most frequently
imitates. They are, if I may say so, all Musical Passions; their
natural tones are all clear, distinct, and almost melodious; and they
naturally express themselves in a language which is distinguished by
pauses at regular, and almost equal, intervals; and which, upon that
account, can more easily be adapted to the regular returns of the
correspondent periods of a tune. The passions, on the contrary,
which drive men from one another, the unsocial, the hateful, the
indecent, the vicious passions, cannot easily be imitated by Music.
The voice of furious anger, for example, is harsh and discordant;
its periods are all irregular, sometimes very long and sometimes very
short, and distinguished by no regular pauses. The obscure and
almost inarticulate grumblings of black malice and envy, the scream∣ing
outcries of dastardly fear, the hideous growlings of brutal and
implacable revenge, are all equally discordant. It is with difficulty
that Music can imitate any of those passions, and the Music which
does imitate them is not the most agreeable. A whole entertainment
may consist, without any impropriety, of the imitation of the social
and amiable passions. It would be a strange entertainment which
consisted altogether in the imitation of the odious and the vicious.
<PB N="157" REF="244"/>
A single song expresses almost always some social, agreeable, or inte∣resting
passion. In an opera the unsocial and disagreeable are some∣times
introduced, but it is rarely, and as discords are introduced into
harmony, to set off by their contrast the superior beauty of the op∣posite
passions. What Plato said of Virtue, that it was of all beauties
the brightest, may with some sort of truth be said of the proper and
natural objects of musical imitation. They are either the sentiments
and passions, in the exercise of which consist both the glory and the
happiness of human life, or they are those from which it derives its
most delicious pleasures, and most enlivening joys; or, at the worst
and the lowest, they are those by which it calls upon our indulgence
and compassionate assistance to its unavoidable weaknesses, its dis∣tresses,
and its misfortunes.</P>
<P>To the merit of its imitation and to that of its happy choice in the
objects which it imitates, the great merits of Statuary and Painting,
Music joins another peculiar and exquisite merit of its own. Sta∣tuary
and Painting cannot be said to add any new beauties of their
own to the beauties of Nature which they imitate; they may as∣semble
a greater number of those beauties, and group them in a
more agreeable manner than they are commonly, or perhaps ever,
to be found in Nature. It may perhaps be true, what the artists are
so very fond of telling us, that no woman ever equalled, in all the
parts of her body, the beauty of the Venus of Medicis, nor any
man that of the Apollo of Belvidere. But they must allow, surely,
that there is no particular beauty in any part or feature of those two
famous statues, which is not at least equalled, if not much excelled,
by what is to be found in many living subjects. But Music, by ar∣ranging,
and as it were bending to its own time and measure,
whatever sentiments and passions it expresses, not only assembles and
groups, as well as Statuary and Painting, the different beauties of
Nature which it imitates, but it clothes them, besides, with a new
<PB N="158" REF="245"/>
and an exquisite beauty of its own; it clothes them with melody
and harmony, which, like a transparent mantle, far from concealing
any beauty, serve only to give a brighter colour, a more enlivening
lustre, and a more engaging grace to every beauty which they
infold.</P>
<P>To these two different sorts of imitation,—to that general one, by
which Music is made to resemble discourse, and to that particular
one, by which it is made to express the sentiments and feelings with
which a particular situation inspires a particular person,—there is fre∣quently
joined a third. The person who sings may join to this
double imitation of the singer the additional imitation of the actor;
and express, not only by the modulation and cadence of his voice,
but by his countenance, by his attitudes, by his gestures, and by his
motions, the sentiments and feelings of the person whose situation
is painted in the song. Even in private company, though a song
may sometimes perhaps be said to be well sung, it can never be
said to be well persormed, unless the singer does something of this
kind; and there is no comparison between the effect of what is sung
coldly from a music-book at the end of a harpsichord, and of what
is not only sung, but acted with proper freedom, animation, and
boldness. An opera actor does no more than this; and an imitation
which is so pleasing, and which appears even so natural, in private
society, ought not to appear forced, unnatural, or disagreeable upon
the stage.</P>
<P>In a good opera actor, not only the modulations and pauses of
his voice, but every motion and gesture, every variation, either in
the air of his head, or in the attitude of his body, correspond to
the time and measure of Music: they correspond to the expression
of the sentiment or passion which the Music imitates, and that ex∣pression
necessarily corresponds to this time and measure. Music is
<PB N="159" REF="246"/>
as it were the soul which animates him, which informs every feature
of his countenance, and even directs every movement of his eyes.
Like the musical expression of a song, his action adds to the natural
grace of the sentiment or action which it imitates, a new and peculiar
grace of its own; the exquisite and engaging grace of those gestures
and motions, of those airs and attitudes which are directed by the
movement, by the time and measure of Music; this grace heightens
and enlivens that expression. Nothing can be more deeply affecting
than the interesting scenes of the serious opera, when to good Poetry
and good Music, to the Poetry of Metastasio and the Music of Per∣golese,
is added the execution of a good actor. In the serious opera,
indeed, the action is too often sacrificed to the Music; the castrati,
who perform the principal parts, being always the most insipid and
miserable actors. The sprightly airs of the comic opera are, in the
same manner, in the highest degree enlivening and diverting. Though
they do not make us laugh so loud as we sometimes do at the scenes
of the common comedy, they make us smile more frequently; and
the agreeable gaiety, the temperate joy, if I may call it so, with
which they inspire us, is not only an elegant, but a most delicious
pleasure. The deep distress and the great passions of tragedy are
capable of producing some effect, though it should be but indiffer∣ently
acted. It is not so with the lighter misfortunes and less affect∣ing
situations of comedy: unless it is at least tolerably acted, it is
altogether insupportable. But the castrati are scarce ever tolerable
actors; they are accordingly seldom admitted to play in the comic
opera; which, being upon that account commonly better performed
than the serious, appears to many people the better entertainment
of the two.</P>
<P>The imitative powers of Instrumental are much inferior to those
of Vocal Music; its melodious but unmeaning and inarticulated
<PB N="160" REF="247"/>
sounds cannot, like the articulations of the human voice, relate dis∣tinctly
the circumstances of any particular story, or describe the dif∣ferent
situations which those circumstances produced; or even ex∣press
clearly, and so as to be understood by every hearer, the various
sentiments and passions which the parties concerned felt from these
situations: even its imitation of other sounds, the objects which it
can certainly best imitate, is commonly so indistinct, that alone, and
without any explication, it might not readily suggest to us what was
the imitated object. The rocking of a cradle is supposed to be imi∣tated
in that concerto of Correlli, which is said to have been com∣posed
for the Nativity: but, unless we were told beforehand,
it might not readily occur to us what it meant to imitate, or
whether it meant to imitate any thing at all; and this imitation
(which, though perhaps as successful as any other, is by no means
the distinguished beauty of that admired composition) might only
appear to us a singular and odd passage in Music. The ringing of
bells and the singing of the lark and nightingale are imitated in the
symphony of Instrumental Music which Mr. Handel has composed
for the Allegro and Penseroso of Milton: these are not only sounds
but musical sounds, and may therefore be supposed to be more
within the compass of the powers of musical imitation. It is ac∣cordingly
universally acknowledged, that in these imitations this
great master has been remarkably successful; and yet, unless the
verses of Milton explained the meaning of the Music, it might not
even in this case readily occur to us what it meant to imitate, or
whether it meant to imitate any thing at all. With the explication
of the words, indeed, the imitation appears, what it certainly is, a
very sine one; but without that explication it might perhaps appear
only a singular passage, which had less connexion either with what
went before or with what came after it, than any other in the
Music.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="248"/>
Instrumental Music is said sometimes to imitate motion; but in
reality it only either imitates the particular sounds which accompany
certain motions, or it produces sounds of which the time and mea∣sure
bear some correspondence to the variations, to the pauses and
interruptions, to the successive accelerations and retardations of the
motion which it means to imitate: it is in this way that it sometimes
attempts to express the march and array of an army, the confusion
and hurry of a battle, &amp;c. In all these cases, however, its imitation
is so very indistinct, that without the accompaniment of some other
art, to explain and interpret its meaning, it would be almost always
unintelligible; and we could scarce ever know with certainty, either
what it meant to imitate, or whether it meant to imitate any thing
at all.</P>
<P>In the imitative arts, though it is by no means necessary that the
imitating should so exactly resemble the imitated object, that the one
should sometimes be mistaken for the other, it is, however, necessary
that they should resemble at least so far, that the one should always
readily suggest the other. It would be a strange picture which re∣quired
an inscription at the foot to tell us, not only what particular
person it meant to represent, but whether it meant to represent a
man or a horse, or whether it meant to be a picture at all, and to
represent any thing. The imitations of instrumental Music may,
in some respects, be said to resemble such pictures. There is, how∣ever,
this very essential difference between them, that the picture
would not be much mended by the inscription; whereas, by what
may be considered as very little more than such an inscription, in∣strumental
Music, though it cannot always even then, perhaps, be
said properly to imitate, may, however, produce all the effects of
the finest and most perfect imitation. In order to explain in what
manner this is brought about, it will not be necessary to d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scend
into any great depth of philosophical speculation.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="249"/>
That train of thoughts and ideas which is continually passing
through the mind does not always move on with the same pace, if
I may say so, or with the same order and connection. When we are
gay and cheerful, its motion is brisker and more lively, our thoughts
succeed one another more rapidly, and those which immediately fol∣low
one another seem frequently either to have but little connection,
or to be connected rather by their opposition than by their mutual
resemblance. As in this wanton and playful disposition of mind
we hate to dwell long upon the same thought, so we do not much
care to pursue resembling thoughts; and the variety of contrast is
more agreeable to us than the sameness of resemblance. It is quite
otherwise when we are melancholy and desponding; we then fre∣quently
find ourselves haunted, as it were, by some thought which
we would gladly chase away, but which constantly pursues us, and
which admits no followers, attendants, or companions, but such as
are of its own kindred and complexion. A slow succession of re∣sembling
or closely connected thoughts is the characteristic of this
disposition of mind; a quick succession of thoughts, frequently con∣trasted
and in general very slightly connected, is the characteristic
of the other. What may be called the natural state of the mind,
the state in which we are neither elated nor dejected, the state of
sedateness, tranquillity, and composure, holds a sort of middle place
between those two opposite extremes; our thoughts succeed one
another more slowly, and with a more distinct connection, than
in the one; more quickly, and with a greater variety, than in the
other.</P>
<P>Acute sounds are naturally gay, sprightly, and enlivening; grave
sounds solemn, awful, and melancholy. There seems too to be
some natural connection between acuteness in tune and quickness in
time or succession, as well as between gravity and slowness: an acute
sound seems to fly off more quickly than a grave one: the treble is
<PB N="163" REF="250"/>
more cheerful than the bass; its notes likewise commonly suc∣ceed
one another more rapidly. But instrumental Music, by a pro∣per
arrangement, by a quicker or slower succession of acute and
grave, of resembling and contrasted sounds, can not only accommo∣date
itself to the gay, the sedate, or the melancholy mood; but if
the mind is so far vacant as not to be disturbed by any disorderly
passion, it can, at least for the moment, and to a certain degree,
produce every possible modification of each of those moods or dis∣positions.
We all readily distinguish the cheerful, the gay, and the
sprightly Music, from the melancholy, the plaintive, and the affect∣ing;
and both these from what holds a sort of middle place between
them, the sedate, the tranquil, and the composing. And we are
all sensible that, in the natural and ordinary state of the mind,
Music can, by a sort of incantation, sooth and charm us into
some degree of that particular mood or disposition which accords
with its own character and temper. In a concert of instrumental
Music the attention is engaged, with pleasure and delight, to listen
to a combination of the most agreeable and melodious sounds, which
follow one another, sometimes with a quicker, and sometimes with
a slower succession; and in which those that immediately follow one
another sometimes exactly or nearly resemble, and sometimes con∣trast
with one another in tune, in time, and in order of arrange∣ment.
The mind being thus successively occupied by a train of ob∣jects,
of which the nature, succession, and connection correspond,
sometimes to the gay, sometimes to the tranquil, and sometimes to
the melancholy mood or disposition, it is itself successively led into
each of those moods or dispositions; and is thus brought into a sort
of harmony or concord with the Music which so agreeably engages
its attention.</P>
<P>It is not, however, by imitation properly, that instrumental Music
produces this effect: instrumental Music does not imitate, as vocal
<PB N="164" REF="251"/>
Music, as Painting, or as Dancing would imitate, a gay, a sedate, or
a melancholy person; it does not tell us, as any of those other arts
could tell us, a pleasant, a serious, or a melancholy story. It is not,
as in vocal Music, in Painting, or in Dancing, by sympathy with
the gaiety, the sedateness, or the melancholy and distress of some
other person, that instrumental Music soothes us into each of these
dispositions: it becomes itself a gay, a sedate, or a melancholy ob∣ject;
and the mind naturally assumes the mood or disposition which
at the time corresponds to the object which engages its attention.
Whatever we feel from instrumental Music is an original, and not a
sympathetic feeling: it is our own gaiety, sedateness, or melan∣choly;
not the reflected disposition of another person.</P>
<P>When we follow the winding alleys of some happily situated and
well laid out garden, we are presented with a succession of land∣scapes,
which are sometimes gay, sometimes gloomy, and some∣times
calm and serene; if the mind is in its natural state, it suits
itself to the objects which successively present themselves, and varies
in some degree its mood and present humour with every variation of
the scene. It would be improper, however, to say that those scenes
imitated the gay, the calm, or the melancholy mood of the mind;
they may produce in their turn each of those moods, but they can∣not
imitate any of them. Instrumental Music, in the same manner,
though it can excite all those different dispositions, cannot imitate
any of them. There are no two things in nature more perfectly
disparate than sound and sentiment; and it is impossible by any hu∣man
power to fashion the one into any thing that bears any real re∣semblance
to the other.</P>
<P>This power of exciting and varying the different moods and dis∣positions
of the mind, which instrumental Music really possesses to
a very considerable degree, has been the principal source of its re∣putation
<PB N="165" REF="252"/>
for those great imitative powers which have been ascribed
to it. “Painting,” says an Author, more capable of feeling strongly
than of analising accurately, Mr. Rousseau of Geneva, “Painting,
which presents its imitations, not to the imagination, but to the
senses, and to only one of the senses, can represent nothing be∣sides
the objects of sight. Music, one might imagine, should be
equally confined to those of hearing. It imitates, however, every
thing, even those objects which are perceivable by sight only.
By a delusion that seems almost inconceivable, it can, as it were,
put the eye into the ear; and the greatest wonder, of an art which
acts only by motion and succession, is, that it can imitate rest and
repose. Night, Sleep, Solitude, and Silence are all within the
compass of musical imitation. Though all Nature should be asleep,
the person who contemplates it is awake; and the art of the musi∣cian
consists in substituting, in the room of an image of what is
not the object of hearing, that of the movements which its pre∣sence
would excite in the mind of the spectator.”—That is, of
the effects which it would produce upon his mood and dispo∣sition.
“The musician (continues the same Author) will some∣times,
not only agitate the waves of the sea, blow up the flames
of a conflagration, make the rain fall, the rivulets flow and swell
the torrents, but he will paint the horrors of a hideous desart,
darken the walls of a subterraneous dungeon, calm the tempest,
restore serenity and tranquillity to the air and the sky, and shed
from the orchestre a new freshness over the groves and the fields.
He will not directly represent any of these objects, but he will
excite in the mind the same movements which it would feel from
seeing them.”</P>
<P>Upon this very eloquent description of Mr. Rousseau I must ob∣serve,
that without the accompaniment of the scenery and action of
the opera, without the assistance either of the scene-painter or of the
<PB N="166" REF="253"/>
poet, or of both, the instrumental Music of the orchestre could pro∣duce
none of the effects which are here ascribed to it; and we could
never know, we could never even guess, which of the gay, melan∣choly,
or tranquil objects above mentioned it meant to represent to
us; or whether it meant to represent any of them, and not merely
to entertain us with a concert of gay, melancholy, or tranquil Music;
or, as the ancients called them, of the Diastaltic, of the Systaltic,
or of the Middle Music. With that accompaniment, indeed, though
it cannot always even then, perhaps, be said properly to imitate,
yet by supporting the imitation of some other art, it may produce
all the same effects upon us as if itself had imitated in the finest and
most perfect manner. Whatever be the object or situation which
the scene-painter represents upon the theatre, the Music of the or∣chestre,
by disposing the mind to the same sort of mood and temper
which it would feel from the presence of that object, or from sym∣pathy
with the person who was placed in that situation, can greatly
enhance the effect of that imitation: it can accommodate itself to
every diversity of scene. The melancholy of the man who, upon
some great occasion, only finds himself alone in the darkness, the
silence and solitude of the night, is very different from that of one
who, upon a like occasion, finds himself in the midst of some
dreary and inhospitable desert; and even in this situation his feelings
would not be the same as if he was shut up in a subterraneous
dungeon. The different degrees of precision with which the Music
of the orchestre can accommodate itself to each of those diversities,
must depend upon the taste, the sensibility, the fancy and imagina∣tion
of the composer: it may sometimes, perhaps, contribute to this
precision, that it should imitate, as well as it can, the sounds which
either naturally accompany, or which might be supposed to accom∣pany,
the particular objects represented. The symphony in the
French opera of Alcyone, which imitated the violence of the winds
and the dashing of the waves, in the tempest which was to drown
<PB N="167" REF="254"/>
Coix, is much commended by cotemporary writers. That in the
opera of Isse, which imitated that murmuring in the leaves of the
oaks of Dodona, which might be supposed to precede the mira∣culous
pronunciation of the oracle: and that in the opera of
Amadis, of which the dismal accents imitated the sounds which
might be supposed to accompany the opening of the tomb of Ardan,
before the apparition of the ghost of that warrior, are still more ce∣lebrated.
Instrumental Music, however, without violating too much
its own melody and harmony, can imitate but imperfectly the sounds
of natural objects, of which the greater part have neither melody
nor harmony. Great reserve, great discretion, and a very nice dis∣cernment
are requisite, in order to introduce with propriety such im∣perfect
imitations, either into Poetry or Music; when repeated too
often, when continued too long, they appear to be what they really
are, mere tricks, in which a very inferior artist, if he will only give
himself the trouble to attend to them, can easily equal the greatest.
I have seen a Latin translation of Mr. Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's
Day, which in this respect very much excelled the original. Such
imitations are still easier in Music. Both in the one art and in the
other, the difficulty is not in making them as well as they are ca∣pable
of being made, but in knowing when and how far to make
them at all: but to be able to accommodate the temper and cha∣racter
of the Music to every peculiarity of the scene and situation
with such exact precision, that the one shall produce the very same
effect upon the mind as the other, is not one of those tricks in
which an inferior artist can easily equal the greatest; it is an art
which requires all the judgment, knowledge, and invention of the
most consummate master. It is upon this art, and not upon its im∣perfect
imitation, either of real or imaginary sounds, that the great
effects of instrumental Music depend; such imitations ought per∣haps
to be admitted only so far as they may sometimes contribute
<PB N="168" REF="255"/>
to ascertain the meaning, and thereby to enhance the effects of
this art.</P>
<P>By endeavouring to extend the effects of scenery beyond what
the nature of the thing will admit of, it has been much abused;
and in the common, as well as in the musical drama, many imita∣tions
have been attempted, which, after the first and second time we
have seen them, necessarily appear ridiculous: such are, the Thun∣der
rumbling from the Mustard-bowl, and the Snow of Paper and
thick Hail of Pease, so finely exposed by Mr. Pope. Such imita∣tions
resemble those of painted Statuary; they may surprize at first,
but they disgust ever after, and appear evidently such simple and easy
tricks as are fit only for the amusement of children and their nurses
at a puppet-show. The thunder of either theatre ought certainly
never to be louder than that which the orchestre is capable of pro∣ducing;
and their most dreadful tempests ought never to exceed
what the scene painter is capable of representing. In such imitations
there may be an art which merits some degree of esteem and admira∣tion.
In the other there can be none which merits any.</P>
<P>This abuse of scenery has both subsisted much longer, and been
carried to a much greater degree of extravagance, in the musical
than in the common drama. In France It has been long banished
from the latter; but it still continues, not only to be tolerated, but
to be admired and applauded in the former. In the French operas,
not only thunder and lightning, storms and tempests, are com∣monly
represented in the ridiculous manner above mentioned, but
all the marvellous, all the supernatural of Epic Poetry, all the meta∣morphoses
of Mythology, all the wonders of Witchcraft and Magic,
every thing that is most unfit to be represented upon the stage, are
every day exhibited with the most complete approbation and ap∣plause
of that ingenious nation. The Music of the orchestre pro∣ducing
<PB N="169" REF="256"/>
upon the audience nearly the same effect which a better and
more artful imitation would produce, hinders them from feeling, at
least in its full force, the ridicule of those childish and aukward imi∣tations
which necessarily abound in that extravagant scenery. And
in reality such imitations, though no doubt ridiculous every where,
yet certainly appear somewhat less so in the musical than they would
in the common drama. The Italian opera, before it was reformed
by Apostolo, Zeno, and Metastasio, was in this respect equally ex∣travagant,
and was upon that account the subject of the agreeable
raillery of Mr. Addison in several different papers of the Spectator.
Even since that reformation it still continues to be a rule, that the
scene should change at least with every act; and the unity of place
never was a more sacred law in the common drama, than the viola∣tion
of it has become in the musical: the latter seems in reality to
require both a more picturesque and a more varied scenery, than is
at all necessary for the former. In an opera, as the Music sup∣ports
the effect of the scenery, so the scenery often serves to deter∣mine
the character, and to explain the meaning of the Music; it
ought to vary therefore as that character varies. The pleasure of an
opera, besides, is in its nature more a sensual pleasure, than that of
a common comedy or tragedy; the latter produce their effect prin∣cipally
by means of the imagination: in the closet, accordingly,
their effect is not much inferior to what it is upon the stage. But
the effect of an opera is seldom very great in the closet; it addresses
itself more to the external senses, and as it soothes the ear by its me∣lody
and harmony, so we feel that it ought to dazzle the eye with
the splendour and variety of its scenery.</P>
<P>In an opera the instrumental Music of the orchestre supports the
imitation both of the poet and of the actor, as well as of the scene∣painter.
The overture disposes the mind to that mood which sits it
for the opening of the piece. The Music between the acts keeps
<PB N="170" REF="257"/>
up the impression which the foregoing had made, and prepares us
for that which the following is to make. When the orchestre in∣terrupts,
as it frequently does, either the recitative or the air, it is
in order either to enforce the effect of what had gone before, or to
put the mind in the mood which fits it for hearing what is to come
after. Both in the recitatives and in the airs it accompanies and
directs the voice, and often brings it back to the proper tone and
modulation, when it is upon the point of wandering away from
them; and the correctness of the best vocal Music is owing in a great
measure to the guidance of instrumental; though in all these cases it
supports the imitation of another art, yet in all of them it may be
said rather to diminish than to increase the resemblance between the
imitating and the imitated object. Nothing can be more unlike to
what really passes in the world, than that persons engaged in the
most interesting situations, both of public and private life, in sorrow,
in disappointment, in distress, in despair, should, in all that they say
and do, be constantly accompanied with a fine concert of instru∣mental
Music. Were we to reflect upon it, such accompaniment
must in all cases diminish the probability of the action, and render
the representation still less like nature than it otherwise would be.
It is not by imitation, therefore, that instrumental Music supports
and enforces the imitations of the other arts; but it is by producing
upon the mind, in consequence of other powers, the same sort of
effect which the most exact imitation of nature, which the most
perfect observation of probability, could produce. To produce this
effect is, in such entertainments, the sole end and purpose of that
imitation and observation. If it can be equally well produced by
other means, this end and purpose may be equally well answered.</P>
<P>But if instrumental Music can seldom be said to be properly imi∣tative,
even when it is employed to support the imitation of some
other art, it is commonly still less so when it is employed alone.
<PB N="171" REF="258"/>
Why should it embarrass its melody and harmony, or constrain its
time and measure, by attempting an imitation which, without the
accompaniment of some other art to explain and interpret its mean∣ing,
nobody is likely to understand? In the most approved in∣strumental
Music, accordingly, in the overtures of Handel and the
concertos of Correlli, there is little or no imitation, and where there
is any, it is the source of but a very small part of the merit of those
compositions. Without any imitation, instrumental Music can pro∣duce
very considerable effects; though its powers over the heart and
affections are, no doubt, much inferior to those of vocal Music, it
has, however, considerable powers: by the sweetness of its sounds
it awakens agreeably, and calls upon the attention; by their con∣nection
and affinity it naturally detains that attention, which follows
easily a series of agreeable sounds, which have all a certain relation
both to a common, fundamental, or leading note, called the key note;
and to a certain succession or combination of notes, called the song
or composition. By means of this relation each foregoing sound
seems to introduce, and as it were prepare the mind for the follow∣ing:
by its rythmus, by its time and measure, it disposes that suc∣cession
of sounds into a certain arrangement, which renders the whole
more easy to be comprehended and remembered. Time and mea∣sure
are to instrumental Music what order and method are to dis∣course;
they break it into proper parts and divisions, by which we
are enabled both to remember better what is gone before, and fre∣quently
to foresee somewhat of what is to come after: we frequently
foresee the return of a period which we know must correspond to
another which we remember to have gone before; and, according
to the saying of an ancient philosopher and musician, the enjoy∣ment
of Music arises partly from memory and partly from foresight.
When the measure, after having been continued so long as to satisfy
us, changes to another, that variety, which thus disappoints, becomes
more agreeable to us than the uniformity which would have gra∣tified
<PB N="172" REF="259"/>
our expectation: but without this order and method we could
remember very little of what had gone before, and we could foresee
still less of what was to come after; and the whole enjoyment of
Music would be equal to little more than the effect of the particular
sounds which rung in our ears at every particular instant. By
means of this order and method it is, during the progress of the
entertainment, equal to the effect of all that we remember, and of
all that we foresee; and at the conclusion, to the combined and ac∣cumulated
effect of all the different parts of which the whole was
composed.</P>
<P>A well-composed concerto of instrumental Music, by the number
and variety of the instruments, by the variety of the parts which
are performed by them, and the perfect concord or correspondence
of all these different parts; by the exact harmony or coincidence of
all the different sounds which are heard at the same time, and by
that happy variety of measure which regulates the succession of those
which are heard at different times, presents an object so agreeable,
so great, so various, and so interesting, that alone, and without sug∣gesting
any other object, either by imitation or otherwise, it can oc∣cupy,
and as it were fill up, completely the whole capacity of the
mind, so as to leave no part of its attention vacant for thinking of
any thing else. In the contemplation of that immense variety of
agreeable and melodious sounds, arranged and digested, both in their
coincidence and in their succession, into so complete and regular a
system, the mind in reality enjoys not only a very great sensual,
but a very high intellectual, pleasure, not unlike that which it de∣rives
from the contemplation of a great system in any other science.
A full concerto of such instrumental Music, not only does not re∣quire,
but it does not admit of any accompaniment. A song or a
dance, by demanding an attention which we have not to spare,
would disturb, instead of heightening, the effect of the Music; they
<PB N="173" REF="260"/>
may often very properly succeed, but they cannot accompany it.
That music seldom means to tell any particular story, or to imitate
any particular event, or in general to suggest any particular object,
distinct from that combination of sounds of which itself is com∣posed.
Its meaning, therefore, may be said to be complete in itself,
and to require no interpreters to explain it. What is called the sub∣ject
of such Music is merely, as has already been said, a certain
leading combination of notes, to which it frequently returns, and
to which all its digressions and variations bear a certain affinity. It
is altogether different from what is called the subject of a poem or
a picture, which is always something which is not either in the
poem or in the picture, or something quite distinct from that com∣bination,
either of words on the one hand, or of colours on the
other, of which they are respectively composed. The subject of a
composition of instrumental Music is a part of that composition:
the subject of a poem or picture is no part of either.</P>
<P>The effect of instrumental Music upon the mind has been called
its expression. In the feeling it is frequently not unlike the effect
of what is called the expression of Painting, and is sometimes equally
interesting. But the effect of the expression of Painting arises al∣ways
from the thought of something which, though distinctly and
clearly suggested by the drawing and colouring of the picture, is alto∣gether
different from that drawing and colouring. It arises some∣times
from sympathy with, sometimes from antipathy and aversion
to, the sentiments, emotions, and passions which the countenance,
the action, the air and attitude of the persons represented suggest.
The melody and harmony of instrumental Music, on the contrary,
do not distinctly and clearly suggest any thing that is different from
that melody and harmony. Whatever effect it produces is the im∣mediate
effect of that melody and harmony, and not of something
else which is signified and suggested by them: they in fact signify
<PB N="174" REF="261"/>
and suggest nothing. It may be proper to say that the complete
art of painting, the complete merit of a picture, is composed of
three distinct arts or merits; that of drawing, that of colouring, and
that of expression. But to say, as Mr. Avison does, that the com∣plete
art of a musician, the complete merit of a piece of Music, is
composed or made up of three distinct arts or merits, that of me∣lody,
that of harmony, and that of expression, is to say, that it is
made up of melody and harmony, and of the immediate and ne∣cessary
effect of melody and harmony: the division is by no means
logical; expression in painting is not the necessary effect either of
good drawing or of good colouring, or of both together; a picture
may be both finely drawn and sinely coloured, and yet have very
little expression: but that effect upon the mind which is called ex∣pression
in Music, is the immediate and necessary effect of good
melody. In the power of producing this effect consists the essential
characteristic which distinguishes such melody from what is bad or
indifferent. Harmony may enforce the effect of good melody, but
without good melody the most skilful harmony can produce no
effect which deserves the name of expression; it can do little more
than fatigue and confound the ear. A painter may possess, in a very
eminent degree, the talents of drawing and colouring, and yet pos∣sess
that of expression in a very inferior degree. Such a painter, too,
may have great merit. In the judgment of Du Piles, even the ce∣lebrated
Titian was a painter of this kind. But to say that a musi∣cian
possessed the talents of melody and harmony in a very eminent
degree, and that of expression in a very inferior one, would be to
say, that in his works the cause was not followed by its necessary
and proportionable effect. A musician may be a very skilful har∣monist,
and yet be defective in the talents of melody, air, and ex∣pression;
his songs may be dull and without effect. Such a musi∣cian
too may have a certain degree of merit, not unlike that of a
man of great learning, who wants fancy, taste, and invention.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="262"/>
Instrumental Music, therefore, though it may, no doubt, be con∣sidered
in some respects as an imitative art, is certainly less so than
any other which merits that appellation; it can imitate but a few
objects, and even these so imperfectly, that without the accompa∣niment
of some other art, its imitation is scarce ever intelligible:
imitation is by no means essential to it, and the principal effects
which it is capable of producing arises from powers altogether dif∣ferent
from those of imitation.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>THE imitative powers of Dancing are much superior to those of
instrumental Music, and are at least equal, perhaps superior,
to those of any other art. Like instrumental Music, however, it is
not necessarily or essentially imitative, and it can produce very agree∣able
effects, without imitating any thing. In the greater part of our
common dances there is little or no imitation, and they consist almost
entirely of a succession of such steps, gestures, and motions, regu∣lated
by the time and measure of Music, as either display extraor∣dinary
grace or require extraordinary agility. Even some of our
dances, which are said to have been originally imitative, have,
in the way in which we practise them, almost ceased to be so.
The minuet, in which the woman, after passing and repassing the
man several times, first gives him up one hand, then the other, and
then both hands, is said to have been originally a Moorish dance,
which emblematically represented the passion of love. Many of my
readers may have frequently danced this dance, and, in the opinion
<PB N="176" REF="263"/>
of all who saw them, with great grace and propriety, though
neither they nor their spectators once thought of the allegorical
meaning which it originally intended to express.</P>
<P>A certain measured, cadenced step, commonly called a dancing
step, which keeps time with, and as it were beats the measure of,
the Music which accompanies and directs it, is the essential charac∣teristic
which distinguishes a dance from every other sort of motion.
When the dancer, moving with a step of this kind, and observing
this time and measure, imitates either the ordinary or the more im∣portant
actions of human life, he shapes and fashions, as it were, a
thing of one kind, into the resemblance of another thing of a very
different kind: his art conquers the disparity which Nature has
placed between the imitating and the imitated object, and has upon
that account some degree of that sort of merit which belongs to all
the imitative arts. This disparity, indeed, is not so great as in
some other of those arts, nor consequently the merit of the imi∣tation
which conquers it. Nobody would compare the merit of a
good imitative dancer to that of a good painter or statuary. The
dancer, however, may have a very considerable degree of merit,
and his imitation perhaps may sometimes be capable of giving us as
much pleasure as that of either of the other two artists. All the
subjects, either of Statuary or of History Painting, are within the
compass of his imitative powers; and in representing them, his art
has even some advantage over both the other two. Statuary and
History Painting can represent but a single instant of the action
which they mean to imitate: the causes which prepared, the conse∣quences
which followed, the situation of that single instant are alto∣gether
beyond the compass of their imitation. A pantomime dance
can represent distinctly those causes and consequences; it is not con∣fined
to the situation of a single instant; but, like Epic Poetry, it
can represent all the events of a long story, and exhibit a long train
<PB N="177" REF="264"/>
and succession of connected and interesting situations. It is capable
therefore of affecting us much more than either Statuary or Paint∣ing.
The ancient Romans used to shed tears at the representations
of their pantomimes, as we do at that of the most interesting tra∣gedies;
an effect which is altogether beyond the powers of Sta∣tuary
or Painting.</P>
<P>The ancient Greeks appear to have been a nation of dancers, and
both their common and their stage dances seem to have been all
imitative. The stage dances of the ancient Romans appear to have
been equally so. Among that grave people it was reckoned indecent
to dance in private societies; and they could therefore have no com∣mon
dances. Among both nations imitation seems to have been
considered as essential to dancing.</P>
<P>It is quite otherwise in modern times: though we have panto∣mime
dances upon the stage, yet the greater part even of our stage
dances are not pantomime, and cannot well be said to imitate any
thing. The greater part of our common dances either never were
pantomime, or, with a very few exceptions, have almost all ceased
to be so.</P>
<P>This remarkable difference of character between the ancient and
the modern dances seems to be the natural effect of a correspondent
difference in that of the Music, which has accompanied and directed
both the one and the other.</P>
<P>In modern times we almost always dance to instrumental Music,
which being itself not imitative, the greater part of the dances which
it directs, and as it were inspires, have ceased to be so. In ancient
times, on the contrary, they seem to have danced almost always to
vocal Music; which being necessary and essentially imitative, their
<PB N="178" REF="265"/>
dances became so too. The ancients seem to have had little or
nothing of what is properly called instrumental Music, or of Music
composed not to be sung by the voice, but to be played upon instru∣ments,
and both their wind and their stringed instruments seem
to have served only as an accompaniment and direction to the
voice.</P>
<P>In the country it frequently happens that a company of young
people take a fancy to dance, though they have neither siddler nor
piper to dance to. A lady undertakes to sing while the rest of the
company dance: in most cases she sings the notes only, without the
words, and then the voice being little more than a musical instru∣ment,
the dance is performed in the usual way, without any imita∣tion.
But if she sings the words, and if in those words there
happens to be somewhat more than ordinary spirit and humour, im∣mediately
all the company, especially all the best dancers, and all
those who dance most at their ease, become more or less panto∣mimes,
and by their gestures and motions express, as well as they
can, the meaning and story of the song. This would be still more
the case, if the same person both danced and sung; a practice very
common among the ancients: it requires good lungs and a vigor∣ous
constitution; but with these advantages and long practice, the
very highest dances may be performed in this manner. I have seen
a Negro dance to his own song, the war-dance of his own country,
with such vehemence of action and expression, that the whole com∣pany,
gentlemen as well as ladies, got up upon chairs and tables,
to be as much as possible out of the way of his fury. In the Greek
language there are two verbs which both signify to dance; each of
which has its proper derivatives, signifying a dance and a dancer.
In the greater part of Greek authors, these two sets of words, like
all others which are nearly synonimous, are frequently confounded,
and used promiscuously. According to the best critics, however, in
<PB N="179" REF="266"/>
strict propriety, one of these verbs signifies to dance and sing at the
same time, or to dance to one's own music. The other to dance
without singing, or to dance to the music of other people. There
is said too to be a correspondent difference in the signification of
their respective derivatives. In the choruses of the ancient Greek
tragedies, consisting sometimes of more than fifty persons, some
piped and some sung, but all danced, and danced to their own
music.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of the Affinity between Music, Dancing, and Poetry.</HEAD>
<P>IN the second part of this Essay I have mentioned the connection
between the two arts of <HI>Music</HI> and <HI>Dancing</HI> formed by the <HI>Ryth∣mus,</HI>
as the ancients termed it, or, as we call it, the tune or measure
that equally regulates both.</P>
<P>It is not, however, every sort of step, gesture, or motion, of
which the correspondence with the tune or measure of Music will
constitute a Dance. It must be a step, gesture, or motion of a par∣ticular
sort. In a good opera-actor, not only the modulations and
<PB N="180" REF="267"/>
pauses of his voice, but every motion and gesture, every variation,
either in the air of his head or in the attitude of his body, corre∣spond
to the time and meafure of Music. The best opera-actor, how∣ever,
is not, according to the language of any country in Europe,
understood to dance, yet in the performance of his part he generally
makes use of what is called the stage step; but even this step is not
understood to be a dancing step.</P>
<P>Though the eye of the most ordinary spectator readily distin∣guishes
between what is called a dancing step and any other step,
gesture, or motion, yet it may not perhaps be very easy to express
what it is which constitutes this distinction. To ascertain exactly
the precise limits at which the one species begins, and the other ends,
or to give an accurate definition of this very frivolous matter, might
perhaps require more thought and attention, than the very small
importance of the subject may seem to deserve. Were I, however,
to attempt to do this, I should observe, that though in performing
any ordinary action—in walking, for example—from the one end of
the room to the other, a person may show both grace and agility,
yet if he betrays the least intention of showing either, he is sure of
offending more or less, and we never fail to accuse him of some de∣gree
of vanity and affectation. In the performance of any such
ordinary action, every person wishes to appear to be solely occupied
about the proper purpose of the action: if he means to show either
grace or agility, he is careful to conceal that meaning, and he is
very seldom successful in doing so: he offends, however, just in pro∣portion
as he betrays it, and he almost always betrays it. In Dancing,
on the contrary, every person professes, and avows, as it were, the
intention of displaying some degree either of grace, or of agility,
or of both. The display of one, or other, or both of these qua∣lities,
is in reality the proper purpose of the action; and there can
never be any disagreeable vanity or affectation in following out the
<PB N="181" REF="268"/>
proper purpose of any action. When we say of any particular per∣son,
that he gives himself many affected airs and graces in Dancing,
we mean either that he gives himself airs and graces which are un∣suitable
to the nature of the Dance, or that he executes aukwardly,
perhaps exaggerates too much, (the most common fault in Dancing,)
the airs and graces which are suitable to it. Every Dance is in reality
a succession of airs and graces of some kind or other, and of airs
and graces which, if I may say so, profess themselves to be such.
The steps, gestures, and motions which, as it were, avow the in∣tention
of exhibiting a succession of such airs and graces, are the
steps, gestures, and motions which are peculiar to Dancing, and
when these are performed to the time and measure of Music, they
constitute what is properly called a Dance.</P>
<P>But though every sort of step, gesture, or motion, even though
performed to the time and measure of Music, will not alone make
a Dance, yet almost any sort of sound, provided it is repeated with
a distinct rythmus, or according to a distinct time and measure,
though without any variation as to gravity or acuteness, will make
a sort of Music, no doubt indeed, an imperfect one. Drums, cym∣bals,
and, so far as I have observed, all other instruments of per∣cussion,
have only one note; this note, however, when repeated
with a certain rythmus, or according to a certain time and measure,
and sometimes, in order to mark more distinctly that time and
measure, with some little variation as to loudness and lowness,
though without any as to acuteness and gravity, does certainly make
a sort of Music, which is frequently far from being disagreeable,
and which even sometimes produces considerable effects. The simple
note of such instruments, it is true, is generally a very clear, or
what is called a melodious, sound. It does not however seem in∣dispensably
necessary that it should be so. The sound of the muffled
drum, when it beats the dead march, is far from being either clear
<PB N="182" REF="269"/>
or melodious, and yet it certainly produces a species of Music, which
is sometimes affecting. Even in the performance of the most humble
of all artists, of the man who drums upon the table with his singers,
we may sometimes distinguish the measure, and perhaps a little of
the humour, of some favourite song; and we must allow that even
he makes some sort of Music. Without a proper step and motion,
the observation of tune alone will not make a Dance; time alone,
without tune, will make some sort of Music.</P>
<P>That exact observation of tune, or of the proper intervals of
gravity and acuteness, which constitutes the great beauty of all perfect
Music, constitutes likewise its great dissiculty. The time or measure
of a song are simple matters, which even a coarse and unpractised ear
is capable of distinguishing and comprehending: but to distinguish
and comprehend all the variations of the tune, and to conceive with
precision, the exact proportion of every note, is what the finest and
most cultivated ear is frequently no more than capable of perform∣ing.
In the singing of the common people we may generally re∣mark
a distinct enough observation of time, but a very imperfect one
of tune. To discover and to distinguish with precision the proper
intervals of tune, must have been a work of long experience and
much observation. In the theoretical treatises upon Music, what the
authors have to say upon time is commonly discussed in a single
chapter of no great length or difficulty. The theory of tune sills
commonly all the rest of the volume, and has long ago become both
an extensive and an abstruse science, which is often but imperfectly
comprehended, even by intelligent artists. In the first rude efforts
of uncivilized nations towards singing, the niceties of tune could be
but little attended to: I have, upon this account, been frequently
disposed to doubt of the great antiquity of those national songs,
which it is pretended have been delivered down from age to age by
a sort of oral tradition, without having been, ever noted, or distinctly
<PB N="183" REF="270"/>
recorded for many successive generations. The measure, the hu∣mour
of the song, might perhaps have been delivered down in this
manner, but it seems scarcely possible that the precise notes of the
tune should have been so preserved. The method of singing some
of what we reckon our old Scotch songs, has undergone great alter∣ations
within the compass of my memory, and it may have un∣dergone
still greater before.</P>
<P>The distinction between the sounds or tones of singing and those
of speaking seems to be of the same kind with that between the
steps, gestures, and motions of Dancing, and those of any other
ordinary action though in speaking a person may show a very
agreeable tone of voice, yet if he seems to intend to show it, if he
appears to listen to the sound of his own voice, and as it were to
tune it into a pleasing modulation, he never fails to offend, as guilty
of a most disagreeable affectation. In speaking, as in every other
ordinary action, we expect and require that the speaker should at∣tend
only to the proper purpose of the action, the clear and distinct
expression of what he has to say. In singing, on the contrary,
every person professes the intention to please by the tone and cadence
of his voice; and he not only appears to be guilty of no disagree∣able
affectation in doing so, but we expect and require that he
should do so. To please by the choice and arrangement of agreeable
sounds is the proper purpose of all Music, vocal as well as instru∣mental;
and we always expect and require, that every person
should attend to the proper purpose of whatever action he is per∣forming.
A person may appear to sing, as well as to dance, affect∣edly;
he may endeavour to please by sounds and tones which are
unsuitable to the nature of the song, or he may dwell too much on
those which are suitable to it, or in some other way he may show
an overweening conceit of his own abilities, beyond what seems to
be warranted by his performance. The disagreeable affectation ap∣pears
to consist always, not in attempting to please by a proper, but
<PB N="184" REF="271"/>
by some improper modulation of the voice. It was early discovered
that the vibrations of chords or strings, which either in their lengths,
or in their densities, or in their degrees of tension, bear a certain
proportion to one another, produce sounds which correspond ex∣actly,
or, as the musicians say, are the unisons of those sounds or
tones of the human voice which the ear approves of in singing.
This discovery has enabled musicians to speak with distinctness and
precision concerning the musical sounds or tones of the human
voice; they can always precisely ascertain what are the particular
sounds or tones which they mean, by ascertaining what are the pro∣portions
of the strings of which the vibrations produce the unisons
of those sounds or tones. What are called the intervals; that is,
the differences, in point of gravity and acuteness, between the sounds
or tones of a singing voice, are much greater and more distinct than
those of the speaking voice. Though the former, therefore, can
be measured and appreciated by the proportions of chords or strings,
the latter cannot. The nicest instruments cannot express the ex∣treme
minuteness of these intervals. The heptamerede of Mr. <HI>Sau∣veur</HI>
could express an interval so small as the seventh part of what
is called a comma, the smallest interval that is admitted in modern
Music. Yet even this instrument, we are informed by Mr. <HI>Duclos,</HI>
could not express the minuteness of the intervals in the pronunci∣ation
of the Chinese language; of all the languages in the world,
that of which the pronunciation is said to approach the nearest to
singing, or in which the intervals are said to be the greatest.</P>
<P>As the sounds or tones of the singing voice, therefore, can be
ascertained or appropriated, while those of the speaking voice can∣not;
the former are capable of being noted or recorded, while the
latter are not.</P>

<P>OF
THE AFFINITY
BETWEEN CERTAIN
ENGLISH AND ITALIAN VERSES.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB REF="273"/>
<HEAD>OF CERTAIN
ENGLISH AND ITALIAN VERSES.</HEAD>
<P>THE measure of the verses, of which the octave of the Italians,
their terzetti, and the greater part of their sonnets, are com∣posed,
seems to be as nearly the same with that of the English He∣roic
Rhyme, as the different genius and pronunciation of the two
languages will permit.</P>
<P>The English Heroic Rhyme is supposed to consist sometimes of
ten, and sometimes of eleven syllables: of ten, when the verse ends
with a single; and of eleven, when it ends with a double rhyme.</P>
<P>The correspondent Italian verse is supposed to consist sometimes of
ten, sometimes of eleven, and sometimes of twelve syllables, ac∣cording
as it happens to end with a single, a double, or a triple
rhyme.</P>
<P>The rhyme ought naturally to fall upon the last syllable of the
verse; it is proper likewise that it should fall upon an accented syl∣lable,
in order to render it more sensible. When, therefore, the ac∣cent
happens to fall, not upon the last syllable, but upon that imme∣diately
before it, the rhyme must fall both upon the accented syl∣lable
and upon that which is not accented. It must be a double
rhyme.</P>
<P>In the Italian language, when the accent falls neither upon the
last syllable, nor upon that immediately before it, but upon the third
<PB N="188" REF="274"/>
syllable from the end, the rhyme must fall upon all the three. It
must be a triple rhyme, and the verse is supposed to consist of twelve
syllables:
<Q>Forsè era ver, non però credìbile, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
Triple rhymes are not admitted into English Heroic Verse.</P>
<P>In the Italian language the accent falls much more rarely, either
upon the third syllable from the end of a word, or upon the last
syllable, than it does upon the one immediately before the last. In
reality, this second syllable from the end seems, in that language,
to be its most common and natural place. The Italian Heroic
Poetry, therefore, is composed principally of double rhymes, or of
verses supposed to consist of eleven syllables. Triple rhymes occur
but seldom, and single rhymes still more seldom.</P>
<P>In the English language the accent falls frequently upon the last
syllable of the word. Our language, besides, abounds in words of
one syllable, the greater part of which do (for there are few which
do not) admit of being accented. Words of one syllable are most
frequently the concluding words of English rhymes. For both
these reasons, English Heroic Rhyme is principally composed of
single rhymes, or of verses supposed to consist of ten syllables.
Double Rhymes occur almost as rarely in it, as either single or triple
do in the Italian.</P>
<P>The rarity of double rhymes in English Heroic Verse makes them
appear odd, and aukward, and even ludicrous, when they occur.
By the best writers, therefore, they are reserved for light and ludi∣crous
occasions; when, in order to humour their subject, they stoop
to a more familiar style than usual. When Mr. Pope says;
<Q><L>Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow;</L>
<L>The rest is all but leather or prunello;</L></Q>
<PB N="189" REF="275"/>
he means, in compliance with his subject, to condescend a good
deal below the stateliness of his diction in the Essay on Man.
Double rhymes abound more in Dryden than in Pope, and in Hu∣dibras
more than in Dryden.</P>
<P>The rarity both of single and of triple rhyme in Italian Heroic
Verse, gives them the same odd and ludicrous air which double
rhymes have in English Verse. In Italian, triple rhymes occur more
frequently than single rhymes. The slippery, or if I may be al∣lowed
to use a very low, but a very expressive word, the glib pro∣nunciation
of the triple rhyme <HI>(verso sotrucciolo)</HI> seems to depart
less from the ordinary movement of the double rhyme, than the
abrupt ending of the single rhyme <HI>(verso tronco e cadente)</HI> of the
verse that appears to be cut off, and to fall short of the usual mea∣sure.
Single rhymes accordingly appear in Italian verse much more
burlesque than triple rhymes. Single rhymes occur very rarely in
Ariosto; but frequently in the more burlesque poem of Ricciar∣detto.
Triple rhymes occur much oftener in all the best writers.
It is thus, that what in English appears to be the verse of the greatest
gravity and dignity, appears in Italian to be the most burlesque and
ludicrous; for no other reason, I apprehend, but because in the one
language it is the ordinary verse, whereas in the other it departs the
most from the movement of the ordinary verse.</P>
<P>The common Italian Heroic Poetry being composed of double
rhymes, it can admit both of single and of triple rhymes; which
seem to recede from the common movement on opposite sides to
nearly equal distances. The common English Heroic Poetry, con∣sisting
of single rhymes, it can admit of double; but it cannot admit
of triple rhymes, which would recede so far from the common
movements as to appear perfectly burlesque and ridiculous. In
<PB N="190" REF="276"/>
English, when a word accented upon the third syllable from the
end happens to make the last word of a verse, the rhyme falls upon
the last syllable only. It is a single rhyme, and the verse consists of
no more than ten syllables: but as the last syllable is not accented, it
is an imperfect rhyme, which, however, when consined to the se∣cond
verse of the couplet, and even there introduced but rarely,
may have a very agreeable grace, and the line may even seem to
run more easy and natural by means of it:
<Q><L>Bùt of this fràme, the beàrings, and the tìes,</L>
<L>The strìct connèctions, nìce depèndencies, &amp;c.</L></Q>
When by a well accented syllable in the end of the first line of a
couplet, it has once been clearly ascertained what the rhyme is to be,
a very slight allusion to it, such as can be made by a syllable of the
same termination that is not accented, may often be sufficient to
mark the coincidence in the second line; a word of this kind in the
end of the first line seldom succeeds so well:
<Q><L>Th' inhabitants of old Jerusalem</L>
<L>Were Jebusites; the town so called from them.</L></Q>
A couplet in which both verses were terminated in this manner,
would be extremely disagreeable and offensive.</P>
<P>In counting the syllables, even of verses which to the ear appear
sufficiently correct, a considerable indulgence must frequently be
given, before they can, in either language, be reduced to the precise
number of ten, eleven, or twelve, according to the nature of the
rhyme. In the following couplet, for example, there are, strictly
speaking, fourteen syllables in the first line, and twelve in the
second.
<Q><L>And many a hŭmoŭrous, many an amorous lay,</L>
<L>Was sung by many a bard, on many a day.</L></Q>
<PB N="191" REF="277"/>
By the rapidity, however, or, if I may use a very low word a se∣cond
time, by the glibness of the pronunciation, those fourteen syl∣lables
in the first line, and those twelve in the second, appear to
take up the time but of ten ordinary syllables. The words <HI>many a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
though they plainly consist of three distinct syllables, or sounds,
which are all pronounced successively, or the one after the other, yet
pass as but two syllables; as do likewise these words <HI>hŭmoŭroŭs</HI> and
<HI>amorous.</HI> The words <HI>heaven</HI> and <HI>given,</HI> in the same manner, consist
each of them of two syllables, which, how rapidly soever they may
be pronounced, cannot be pronounced but successively, or the one
after the other. In verse, however, they are considered as consisting
but of one syllable each.</P>
<P>In counting the syllables of the Italian Heroic Verse, still greater
indulgences must be allowed: three vowels must there frequently be
counted as making but one syllable, though they are all pronounced,
rapidly indeed, but in succession, or the one after the other, and
though no two of them are supposed to make a dipththong. In
these licences too, the Italians seem not to be very regular, and the
same concourse of vowels which in one place makes but one syllable,
will in another sometimes make two. There are even some words
which in the end of a verse are constantly counted for two syllables,
but which in any other part of it are never counted for more
than one; such as <HI>suo, tuo, suoi, tuoi.</HI></P>
<P>Ruscelli observes, that in the Italian Heroic Verse the accent ought
to fall upon the fourth, the sixth, the eighth, and the tenth syl∣lables;
and that if it falls upon the third, the fifth, the seventh, or
the ninth syllables, it spoils the verse.</P>
<P>In English, if the accent falls upon any of the above-mentioned
odd syllables it, qually spoils the verse.</P>
<Q>Bow'd their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts.</Q>
<P><PB N="192" REF="278"/>
Though a line of Milton has not the ordinary movement of an
English. Heroic Verse, the accent falls upon the third and fifth
syllables.</P>
<P>In Italian frequently, and in English sometimes, an accent is with
great grace thrown upon the first syllable: in which case it seldom
happens that any other syllable is accented before the fourth;
<Q><L>Cánto l'armé pietóse e'l capitáno.</L>
<L>Fírst in these fiélds I trý the sylvan stráins.</L></Q></P>
<P>Both in English and in Italian the second syllable may be accented
with great grace, and it generally is so when the first syllable is not
accented:
<Q><L>E in van l'inferno a'lui s' oppose; e in vano</L>
<L>S' armó d' Asia, e di Libia il popol misto, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L>
<L>Let us, since life can little more supply</L>
<L>Than just to look about us, and to die, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>Both in English and in Italian Verse, an accent, though it must
never be misplaced, may sometimes be omitted with great grace. In
the last of the above-quoted English Verses there is no accent upon
the eighth syllable; the conjuncton <HI>and</HI> not admitting of any. In
the following Italian Verse there is no accent upon the sixth
syllable:
<Q>O Musa, tu, che di caduchi allori, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
The proposition <HI>di</HI> will as little admit of an accent as the conjunction
<HI>and.</HI> In this case, however, when the even syllable is not accented,
neither of the odd syllables immediately before or behind it must be
accented.</P>
<P>Neither in English nor in Italian can two accents running be
omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="279"/>
It must be observed, that in Italian there are two accents, the
grave and the acute: the grave accent is always marked by a slight
stroke over the syllable to which it belongs; the acute accent has no
mark.</P>
<P>The English language knows no distinction between the grave and
the acute accents.</P>
<P>The same author observes, that in the Italian Verse the Pause, or
what the grammarians call the Cesura, may with propriety be intro∣duced
after either the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, or the
seventh syllables. The like observations have been made by several
different writers upon the English Heroic Verse. Dobie admires
particularly the verse in which there are two pauses; one after the
fifth, and another after the ninth syllable. The example he gives
is from Petrarch:
<Q>Nel dolce tempo de la prima etade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
In this verse, the second pause, which he says comes after the ninth
syllable, in reality comes in between the two vowels, which, in the
Italian way of counting syllables, compose the ninth syllable. It
may be doubtful, therefore, whether this pause may not be con∣sidered
as coming after the eighth syllable. I do not recollect any
good English Verse in which the pause comes in after the ninth
syllable. We have many in which it comes in after the eighth:
<Q>Yet oft, before his infant eyes, would run, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
In which verse there are two pauses; one after the second, and the
other after the eighth syllable. I have observed many Italian Verses
in which the pause comes after the second syllable.</P>
<P>Both the English and the Italian Heroic Verse, perhaps, are not
so properly composed of a certain number of syllables, which vary
<PB N="194" REF="280"/>
according to the nature of the rhyme; as of a certain number of
intervals, (of sive invariably,) each of which is equal in length, or
time, to two ordinary distinct syllables, though it may sometimes
contain more, of which the extraordinary shortness compensates the
extraordinary number. The close frequently of each of those in∣tervals,
but always of every second interval, is marked by a distinct
accent. This accent may frequently, with great grace, fall upon
the beginning of the first interval; after which, it cannot, without
spoiling the verse, fall any where but upon the close of an interval.
The syllable or syllables which come after the accent that closes the
fifth interval are never accented. They make no distinct interval,
but are considered as a sort of excrescence of the verse, and are in
a manner counted for nothing.</P>

<P>OF THE
EXTERNAL SENSES.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB REF="282"/>
<HEAD>OF THE
EXTERNAL SENSES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Senses by which we perceive external objects, are com∣monly
reckoned Five in Number; Seeing, Hearing, Smelling,
Tasting, and Touching.</P>
<P>Of these, the four first mentioned are each of them confined to
particular parts or organs of the body; the Sense of Seeing is con∣fined
to the Eyes; that of Hearing to the Ears; that of Smelling
to the Nostrils; and that of Tasting to the Palate. The Sense of
Touching alone seems not to be confined to any particular organ,
but to be diffused through almost every part of the body; if we ex∣cept
the hair and the nails of the fingers and toes, I believe through
every part of it. I shall say a few words concerning each of these
Senses; beginning with the last, proceeding backwards in the op∣posite
order to that in which they are commonly enumerated.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Of the Sense of TOUCHING.</HEAD>
<P>THE objects of Touch always present themselves as pressing upon,
or as resisting the particular part of the body which perceives them,
or by which we perceive them. When I lay my hand upon the
<PB N="198" REF="283"/>
table, the table presses upon my hand, or resists the further motion
of my hand, in the same manner as my hand presses upon the table.
But pressure or resistance necessarily supposes externality in the thing
which presses or resists. The table could not press upon, or resist
the further motion of my hand, if it was not external to my hand.
I feel it accordingly, as something which is not merely an affection
of my hand, but altogether external to, and independant of my hand.
The agreeable, indifferent, or painful sensation of pressure, accord∣ing
as I happen to press hardly or softly, I feel, no doubt, as af∣fections
of my hand; but the thing which presses and resists I feel
as something altogether different from those affections, as external to
my hand, and as altogether independent of it.</P>
<P>In moving my hand along the table it soon comes, in every di∣rection,
to a place where this pressure or sesistance ceases. This
place we call the boundary, or end of the table; of which the ex∣tent
and figure are determined by the extent and direction of the
lines or surfaces which constitute this boundary or end.</P>
<P>It is in this manner that a man born blind, or who has lost his
sight so early that he has no remembrance of visible objects, may
form the most distinct idea of the extent and figure of all the dif∣ferent
parts of his own body, and of every other tangible object
which he has an opportunity of handling and examining. When
he lays his hand upon his foot, as his hand feels the pressure or re∣sistance
of his foot, so his foot feels that of his hand. They are
both external to one another, but they are, neither of them, alto∣gether
so external to him. He feels in both, and he naturally con∣siders
them as parts of himself, or at least as something which be∣longs
to him, and which, for his own happiness and comfort, it is
necessary that he should take some care of.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="284"/>
When he lays his hand upon the table, though his hand feels the
pressure of the table, the table does not feel, at least he does not
know that it feels, the pressure of his hand. He feels it therefore as
something external, not only to his hand, but to himself, as some∣thing
which makes no part of himself, and in the state and condition
of which he has not necessarily any concern.</P>
<P>When he lays his hand upon the body either of another man, or
of any other animal, though he knows, or at least may know, that
they feel the pressure of his hand as much as he feels that of their
body: Yet as this feeling is altogether external to him, he fre∣quently
gives no attention to it, and at no time takes any further
concern in it than he is obliged to do by that fellow-feeling which
Nature has, for the wisest purposes, implanted in man, not only
towards all other men, but (though no doubt in a much weaker
degree) towards all other animals. Having destined him to be the
governing animal in this little world, it seems to have been her be∣nevolent
intention to inspire him with some degree of respect, even
for the meanest and weakest of his subjects.</P>
<P>This power or quality of resistance we call Solidity; and the
thing which possesses it, the Solid Body or Thing. As we feel it
as something altogether external to us, so we necessarily conceive it
as something altogether independent of us. We consider it, there∣fore,
as what we call a Substance, or as a thing that subsists by it∣self,
and independent of any other thing. Solid and substantial,
accordingly, are two words which, in common language, are con∣sidered
either as altogether, or as nearly synonimous.</P>
<P>Solidity necessarily supposes some degree of extension, and that
in all the three directions of length, breadth, and thickness. All
the solid bodies, of which we have any experience, have some
degree of such bulk or magnitude. It seems to be essential to
<PB N="200" REF="285"/>
their nature, and without it, we cannot even conceive how they
should be capable of pressure or resistance; the powers by which
they are made known to us, and by which alone they are capable of
acting upon our own, and upon all other bodies.</P>
<P>Extension, at least any sensible extension, supposes divisibility.
The body may be so hard, that our strength is not sufficient to break
it: we still suppose, however, that if a sufficient force were applied, it
might be so broken; and, at any rate, we can always, in fancy at
least, imagine it to be divided into two or more parts.</P>
<P>Every solid and extended body, if it be not infinite, (as the uni∣verse
may be conceived to be,) must have some shape or figure, or
be bounded by certain lines and surfaces.</P>
<P>Every such body must likewise be conceived as capable both of
motion and of rest; both of altering its situation with regard to
other surrounding bodies, and of remaining in the same situation.
That bodies of small or moderate bulk, are capable of both motion
and rest we have constant experience. Great masses, perhaps, are,
according to the ordinary habits of the imagination, supposed to be
more sitted for rest than for motion. Provided a sufficient force
could be applied, however, we have no difficulty in conceiving that
the greatest and most unwieldy masses might be made capable of
motion. Philosophy teaches us, (and by reasons too to which it is
scarcely possible to refuse our assent,) that the earth itself, and bodies
much larger than the earth, are not only moveable, but are at all
times actually in motion, and continually altering their situation,
in respect to other surrounding bodies, with a rapidity that almost
passes all human comprehension. In the system of the universe, at
least according to the imperfect notions which we have hitherto
been able to attain concerning it, the great difficulty seems to be,
<PB N="201" REF="286"/>
not to find the most enormous masses in motion, but to find the
smallest particle of matter that is perfectly at rest, with regard to
all other surrounding bodies.</P>
<P>These four qualities, or attributes of extension, divisibility, figure,
and mobility, or the capacity of motion or rest, seem necessarily
involved in the idea or conception of a solid substance. They are,
in reality, inseparable from that idea or conception, and the solid
substance cannot possibly be conceived to exist without them. No
other qualities or attributes seem to be involved, in the same manner,
in this our idea or conception of solidity. It would, however, be rash
from thence to conclude that the solid substance can, as such, possefs
no other qualities or attributes. This very rash conclusion, not∣withstanding,
has been not only drawn, but insisted upon, as an
axiom of the most indubitable certainty, by philosophers of very
eminent reputation.</P>
<P>Of these external and resisting substances, some yield easily, and
change their figure, at least in some degree, in consequence of the
pressure of our hand: others neither yield nor change their figure,
in any respect, in consequence of the utmost pressure which our
hand alone is capable of giving them. The former we call soft,
the latter hard, bodies. In some bodies the parts are so very easily
separable, that they not only yield to a very moderate pressure, but
easily receive the pressing body within them, and without much re∣sistance
allow it to traverse their extent in every possible direction.
These are called Fluid, in contradistinction to those of which the
parts not being so easily separable, are upon that account peculiarly
called Solid Bodies; as if they possessed, in a more distinct and per∣ceptible
manner, the characteristical quality of solidity or the power
of resistance. Water, however, (one of the fluids with which we
are most familiar,) when confined on all sides, (as in a hollow globe
<PB N="202" REF="287"/>
of metal, which is first filled with it, and then sealed hermetically,)
has been found to resist pressure as much as the hardest, or what we
commonly call the most solid bodies.</P>
<P>Some fluids yield so very easily to the slightest pressure, that upon
ordinary occasions we are scarcely sensible of their resistance; and are
upon that account little disposed to conceive them as bodies, or as
things capable of pressure and resistance. There was a time, as we
may learn from Aristotle and Lucretius, when it was supposed to
require some degree of philosophy to demonstrate that air was a
real solid body, or capable of pressure and resistance. What, in
ancient times, and in vulgar apprehensions, was supposed to be
doubtful with regard to air, still continues to be so with regard to
light, of which the rays, however condensed or concentrated, have
never appeared capable of making the smallest resistance to the
motion of other bodies, the characteristical power or quality of
what are called bodies, or solid substances. Some philosophers ac∣cordingly
doubt, and some even deny, that light is a material or
corporeal substance.</P>
<P>Though all bodies or solid substances resist, yet all those with
which we are acquainted appear to be more or less compressible, or
capable of having, without any diminution in the quantity of their
matter, their bulk more or less reduced within a smaller space than
that which they usually occupy. An experiment of the Florentine
academy was supposed to have demonstrated that water was abso∣lutely
incompressible. The same experiment, however, having been
repeated with more care and accuracy, it appears, that water, though
it strongly resists compression, is, however, when a sufficientf force
is applied, like all other bodies, in some degree liable to it. Air,
on the contrary, by the application of a very moderate force, is
easily reducible within a much smaller portion of space than that
<PB N="203" REF="288"/>
which it usually occupies. The condensing engine, and what is
founded upon it, the wind-gun, sufficiently demonstrate this: and
even without the help of such ingenious and expensive machines,
we may easily satisfy ourselves of the truth of it, by squeezing a full∣blown
bladder of which the neck is well tied.</P>
<P>The hardness or softness of bodies, or the greater or smaller force
with which they resist any change of shape, seems to depend alto∣gether
upon the stronger or weaker degree of cohesion with which
their parts are mutually attracted to one another. The greater or
smaller force with which they resist compression may, upon many
occasions, be owing partly to the same cause: but it may likewise
be owing to the greater or smaller proportion of empty space com∣prehended
within their dimensions, or intermixed with the solid
parts which compose them. A body which comprehended no empty
space within its dimensions, which, through all its parts, was com∣pletely
filled with the resisting substance, we are naturally disposed
to conceive as something which would be absolutely incompressible,
and which would resist, with unconquerable force, every attempt to
reduce it within narrower dimensions. If the solid and resisting
substance, without moving out of its place, should admit into the
same place another solid and resisting substance, it would from that
moment, in our apprehension, cease to be a solid and resisting sub∣stance,
and would no longer appear to possess that quality, by which
alone it is made known to us, and which we therefore consider as
constituting its nature and essence, and as altogether inseparable from
it. Hence our notion of what has been called impenetrability of
matter; or of the absolute impossibility that two solid resisting sub∣stances
should occupy the same place at the same time.</P>
<P>This doctrine, which is as old as Leucippus, Democritus, and
Epicurus, was in the last century revived by Gassendi, and has since
<PB N="204" REF="289"/>
been adopted by Newton and the far greater part of his followers.
It may at present be considered as the established system, or as the
system that is most in fashion, and most approved of by the greater part
of the philosophers of Europe. Though it has been opposed by
several puzzling arguments, drawn from that specics of metaphysics
which confounds every thing and explains nothing, it seems upon
the whole to be the most simple, the most distinct, and the most
comprehensible account that has yet been given of the phoenomena
which are meant to be explained by it. I shall only observe, that
whatever system may be adopted concerning the hardness or soft∣ness,
the fluidity or solidity, the compressibility or incompressibility,
of the resisting substance, the certainty of our distinct sense and
feeling of its Externality, or of its entire independency upon the
organ which perceives it, or by which we perceive it, cannot in the
smallest degree be affected by any such system. I shall not there∣fore
attempt to give any further account of such systems.</P>
<P>Heat and cold being felt by almost every part of the human body,
have commonly been ranked along with solidity and resistance,
among the qualities which are the objects of Touch. It is not,
however, I think, in our language proper to say that we touch, but
that we feel, the qualities of heat and cold. The word <HI>feeling,</HI>
though in many cases we use it as synonimous to <HI>touching,</HI> has, how∣ever,
a much more extensive signification, and is frequently em∣ployed
to denote our internal, as well as our external, affections.
We feel hunger and thirst, we feel joy and sorrow, we feel love and
hatred.</P>
<P>Heat and cold, in reality, though they may frequently be per∣ceived
by the same parts of the human body, constitute an order of
sensations altogether different from those which are the proper ob∣jects
of Touch. They are naturally felt, not as preffing upon the
<PB N="205" REF="290"/>
organ, but as in the organ. What we feel while we stand in the
sunshine during a hot, or in the shade during a frosty, day, is evi∣dently
felt, not as preffing upon the body, but as in the body. It does
not necessarily suggest the presence of any external object, nor could
we from thence alone infer the existence of any such object. It is
a sensation which neither does nor can exist any where but either in
the organ which feels it, or in the unknown principle of perception,
whatever that may be, which feels in that organ, or by means of that
organ. When we lay our hand upon a table, which is either heated
or cooled a good deal beyond the actual temperature of our hand,
we have two distinct perceptions: first, that of the solid or resisting
table, which is necessarily felt as something external to, and inde∣pendent
of, the hand which feels it: and secondly, that of the heat
or cold, which by the contact of the table is excited in our hand,
and which is naturally felt as nowhere but in our hand, or in the
principle of perception which feels in our hand.</P>
<P>But though the sensations of heat and cold do not necessarily
suggest the presence of any external object, we soon learn from ex∣perience
that they are commonly excited by some such object;
sometimes by the temperature of some external body immediately in
contact with our own body, and sometimes by some body at either
a moderate or a great distance from us; as by the fire in a chamber,
or by the sun in a Summer's day. By the frequency and uniformity
of this experience, by the custom and habit of thought which that
frequency and uniformity necessarily occasion, the Internal Sensa∣tion,
and the External Cause of that Sensation, come in our con∣ception
to be so strictly connected, that in our ordinary and careless
way of thinking, we are apt to consider them as almost one and the
same thing, and therefore denote them by one and the same word.
The confusion, however, is in this case more in the word than in
<PB N="206" REF="291"/>
the thought; for in reality we still retain some notion of the dis∣tinction,
though we do not always evolve it with that accuracy
which a very slight degree of attention might enable us to do.
When we move our hand, for example, along the surface of a very
hot or of a very cold table, though we say that the table is hot
or cold in every part of it, we never mean that, in any part of it,
it feels the sensations either of heat or of cold, but that in every
part of it, it possesses the power of exciting one or other of those
sensations in our bodies. The philosophers who have taken so much
pains to prove that there is no heat in the fire, meaning that the
sensation or feeling of heat is not in the fire, have laboured to refute
an opinion which the most ignorant of mankind never entertained.
But the same word being, in common language, employed to signify
both the sensation and the power of exciting that sensation, they,
without knowing it perhaps, or intending it, have taken advantage
of this ambiguity, and have triumphed in their own superiority,
when by irresistible arguments they establish an opinion which, in
words indeed, is diametrically opposite to the most obvious judg∣ments
of mankind, but which in reality is perfectly agreeable to
those judgments.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Of the Sense of TASTING.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we taste any solid or liquid substance, we have always two
distinct perceptions; first, that of the solid or liquid body, which is
naturally felt as pressing upon, and therefore as external to, and in∣dependent
of, the organ which feels it; and secondly, that of the
particular taste, relish, or favour which it excites in the palate or
organ of Tasting, and which is naturally felt, not as pressing upon,
as external to, or as independent of, that organ; but as altogether
<PB N="207" REF="292"/>
in the organ, and nowhere but in the organ, or in the principle of
perception which feels in that organ. When we say that the food
which we eat has an agreeable or disagreeable taste in every part of
it, we do not thereby mean that it has the feeling or sensation of
taste in any part of it, but that in every part of it, it has the power
of exciting that feeling or sensation in our palates. Though in this
case we denote by the same word (in the same manner, and for the
same reason, as in the case of heat and cold) both the sensation and
the power of exciting that sensation, this ambiguity of language
misleads the natural judgments of mankind in the one case as little
as in the other. Nobody ever fancies that our food feels its own
agreeable or disagreeable taste.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Of the Sense of SMELLING.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY smell or odour is naturally felt as in the nostrils; not as
pressing upon or resisting the organ, not as in any respect external
to, or independent of, the organ, but as altogether in the organ,
and nowhere else but in the organ, or in the principle of perception
which feels in that organ. We soon learn from experience, how∣ever,
that this sensation is commonly excited by some external body;
by a flower, for example, of which the absence removes, and the pre∣sence
brings back, the sensation. This external body we consider as
the cause of this sensation, and we denominate by the same words both
the sensation and the power by which the external body produces
this sensation. But when we say that the smell is in the flower, we
do not thereby mean that the flower itself has any feeling of the sensa∣tion
which we feel; but that it has the power of exciting this sensa∣tion
in our nostrils, or in the principle of perception which feels in
our nostrils. Though the sensation, and the power by which it is
<PB N="208" REF="293"/>
excited, are thus denoted by the same word, this ambiguity of
language misleads, in this case, the natural judgments of mankind as
little as in the two preceding.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Of the Sense of HEARING.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY found is naturally felt as in the Ear, the organ of
Hearing. Sound is not naturally felt as resisting or pressing upon
the organ, or as in any respect external to, or independent of, the
organ. We naturally feel it as an affection of our Ear, as some∣thing
which is altogether in our Ear, and nowhere but in our Ear,
or in the principle of perception which feels in our Ear. We soon
learn from experience, indeed, that the sensation is frequently ex∣cited
by bodies at a considerable distance from us; often at a much
greater distance than those ever are which excite the sensation of
Smelling. We learn too from experience, that this found or sensa∣tion
in our Ears receives different modifications, according to the
distance and direction of the body which originally causes it. The
sensation is stronger, the found is louder, when that body is near.
The sensation is weaker, the found is lower, when that body is at a
distance. The found, or sensation, too undergoes some variation
according as the body is placed on the right hand or on the left,
before or behind us. In common language we frequently say, that
the found seems to come from a great or from a small distance, from
the right hand or from the left, from before or from behind us. We
frequently say too that we hear a found at a great or a small dis∣tance,
on our right hand or on our left. The real found, however,
the sensation in our ear, can never be heard or felt any where but
in our ear, it can never change its place, it is incapable of motion,
and can come, therefore, neither from the right nor from the left
<PB N="209" REF="294"/>
neither from before nor from behind us. The Ear can feel or hear
nowhere but where it is, and cannot stretch out its powers of per∣ception,
either to a great or to a small distance, either to the right
or to the left. By all such phrases we in reality mean nothing but
to express our opinion concerning either the distance, or the direc∣tion
of the body, which excites the sensation of found. When we
say that the found is in the bell, we do not mean that the bell hears
its own sound, or that any thing like our sensation is in the bell,
but that it possesses the power of exciting that sensation in our organ
of Hearing. Though in this, as well as in some other cases, we
express by the same word, both the Sensation, and the Power of
exciting that Sensation; this ambiguity of language occasions scarce
any confusion in the thought, and when the different meanings of
the word are properly distinguished, the opinions of the vulgar, and
those of the philosopher, though apparently opposite, turn out to
be exactly the same.</P>
<P>These four classes of secondary qualities, as philosophers have
called them, or to speak more properly, these four classes of Sensa∣tions;
Heat and Cold, Taste, Smell, and Sound; being felt, not
as resisting or pressing upon the organ; but as in the organ, are not
naturally perceived as external and independant substances; or even
as qualities of such substances; but as mere affections of the organ,
and what can exist nowhere but in the organ.</P>
<P>They do not possess, nor can we even conceive them as ca∣pable
of possessing, any one of the qualities, which we consider as
essential to, and inseparable from, the external solid and independ∣ant
substances.</P>
<P>First, They have no extension. They are neither long nor short;
they are neither broad nor narrow; they are neither deep nor shal∣low.
<PB N="210" REF="295"/>
The bodies which excite them, the spaces within which they
may be perceived, may possess any of those dimensions; but the
Sensations themselves can possess none of them. When we say
of a Note in Musie, that it is long or short, we mean that it is
so in point of duration. In point of extension we cannot even con∣ceive,
that it should be either the one or the other.</P>
<P>Secondly, Those Sensations have no figure. They are neither
round nor square, though the bodies which excite them, though
the spaces within which they may be perceived, may be either the
oue or the other.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Those Sensations are incapable of motion. The bodies
which excite them may be moved to a greater or to a smaller dis∣tance.
The Sensations become fainter in the one case, and stronger
in the other. Those bodies may change their direction with regard
to the organ of Sensation. If the change be considerable, the
Sensations undergo some sensible variation in consequence of it.
But still we never ascribe motion to the Sensations. Even when the
person who feels any of those Sensations, and consequently the
organ by which he feels them, changes his situation, we never,
even in this case, say, that the Sensation moves, or is moved. It
seems to exist always, where alone it is capable of existing, in the
organ which feels it. We never even ascribe to those Sensations the
attribute of rest; because we never say that any thing is at rest,
unless we suppose it capable of motion. We never say that any
thing does not change its situation with regard to other things,
unless we suppose it capable of changing that situation.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Those Sensations, as they have no extension, so they
can have no divisibility. We cannot even conceive that a degree
<PB N="211" REF="296"/>
of Heat or Cold, that a Smell, a Taste, or a Sound, should be
divided (in the same manner as the solid and extended substance
may be divided) into two halves, or into four quarters, or into any
other number of parts.</P>
<P>But though all these Sensations are equally incapable of division;
there are three of them, Taste, Smell, and Sound; which seem
capable of a certain composition and decomposition. A skilful cook
will, by his taste, perhaps, sometimes distinguish the different
ingredients, which enter into the composition of a new sauce, and
of which the simple tastes make up the compound one of the sauce.
A skilful perfumer may, perhaps, sometimes be able to do the same
thing with regard to a new Scent. In a concert of vocal and in∣instrumental
music, an acute and experienced Ear readily distin∣guishes
all the different sounds which strike upon it at the same
time, and which may, therefore, be considered as making up one
compound sound.</P>
<P>Is it by nature, or by experience, that we learn to distinguish
between simple and compound Sensations of this kind? I am dis∣posed
to believe that it is altogether by experience; and that na∣turally
all Tastes, Smells, and Sounds, which affect the organ of
Sensation at the same time, are felt as simple and uncompounded
Sensations. It is altogether by experience, I think, that we learn to
observe the different affinities and resemblances which the compound
Sensation bears to the different simple ones, which compose it, and
to judge that the different causes, which naturally excite those dif∣ferent
simple Sensations, enter into the composition of that cause
which excites the compounded one.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="297"/>
It is sufficiently evident that this composition and decomposition
is altogether different from that union and separation of parts, which
constitutes the divisibility of solid extension.</P>
<P>The Sensations of Heat and Cold seem incapable even of this
species of composition and decomposition. The Sensations of Heat
and Cold may be stronger at one time and weaker at another. They
may differ in degree, but they cannot differ in kind. The Sensations
of Taste, Smell, and Sound, frequently differ, not only in degree,
but in kind. They are not only stronger and weaker, but some
Tastes are sweet and some bitter; some Smells are agreeable, and
some offensive; some Sounds are acute, and some grave; and each
of these different kinds or qualities too is capable of an immense
variety of different modifications. It is the combination of such
simple Sensations, as differ not only in degree but in kind, which
constitutes the compounded Sensation.</P>
<P>These four classes of Sensations, therefore, having none of the
qualities which are essential to, and inseparable from, the solid, ex∣ternal,
and independant substances which excite them, cannot be
qualities or modifications of those substances. In reality we do not
naturally consider them as such; though in the way in which we
express ourselves on the subject, there is frequently a good deal of
ambiguity and confusion. When the different meanings of words,
however, are fairly distinguished, these Sensations are, even by the
most ignorant and illiterate, understood to be, not the qualities, but
merely the effects of the solid, external, and independant substances
upon the sensible and living organ, or upon the principle of percep∣tion
which feels in that organ.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="298"/>
Philosophers, however, have not in general supposed that those
exciting bodies produce those Sensations immediately, but by the
intervention of one, two, or more intermediate causes.</P>
<P>In the Sensation of Taste, for example, though the exciting body
presses upon the organ of Sensation, this pressure is not supposed to
be the immediate cause of the Sensation of Taste. Certain juices of
the exciting body are supposed to enter the pores of the palate, and
to excite, in the irritable and sensible fibres of that organ, certain
motions or vibrations, which produce there the Sensation of Taste.
But how those juices should excite such motions, or how such mo∣tions
should produce, either in the organ, or in the principle of
perception which feels in the organ, the Sensation of Taste; or a
Sensation, which not only does not bear the smallest resemblance to
any motion, but which itself seems incapable of all motion, no
philosopher has yet attempted, nor probably ever will attempt to
explain to us.</P>
<P>The Sensations of Heat and Cold, of Smell and Sound, are fre∣quently
excited by bodies at a distance, sometimes at a great dis∣tance,
from the organ which feels them. But it is a very antient
and well-established axiom in metaphysics, that nothing can act
where it is not; and this axiom, it must, I think, be acknowledged,
is at least perfectly agreeable to our natural and usual habits of
thinking.</P>
<P>The Sun, the great source of both Heat and Light, is at an im∣mense
distance from us. His rays, however, (traversing, with
inconceivable rapidity, the immensity of the intervening regions,)
as they convey the Sensation of Light to our eyes, so they convey
that of Heat to all the sensible parts of our body. They even con∣vey
the power of exciting that Sensation to all the other bodies that
<PB N="214" REF="299"/>
surround us. They warm the earth, and air, we say; that is, they
convey to the earth and the air the power of exciting that Sensation
in our bodies. A common fire produces, in the same manner, all
the same effects; though the sphere of its action is confined within
much narrower limits.</P>
<P>The odoriferous body, which is generally too at some distance
from us, is supposed to act upon our organs by means of certain
small particles of matter, called Esfluvia, which being sent sorth in
all possible directions, and drawn into our nostrils by the inspiration
of breathing, produce there the Sensation of Smell. The minute∣ness
of those small particles of matter, however, must surpass all
human comprehension. Inclose in a gold box, for a few hours, a
small quantity of musk. Take out the musk, and clean the box
with soap and water as carefully as it is possible. Nothing can be
supposed to remain in the box, but such effluvia as, having pene∣trated
into its interior pores, may have escaped the effects of
this cleansing. The box, however, will retain the smell of musk
for many, I do not know for how many years; and these effluvia,
how minute soever we may suppose them, must have had the
powers of subdividing themselves, and of emitting other effluvia of
the same kind, continually, and without any interruption, during
so long a period. The nicest balance, however, which human art
has been able to invent, will not show the smallest increase of
weight in the box immediately after it has been thus carefully
cleaned.</P>
<P>The Sensation of Sound is frequently felt at a much greater dis∣tance
from the sounding, than that of Smell ever is from the odo∣riferous
body. The vibrations of the sounding body, however, are
supposed to produce certain correspondent vibrations and pulses
in the surrounding atmosphere, which being propagated in all
<PB N="215" REF="300"/>
directions, reach our organ of Hearing, and produce there the
Sensation of Sound. There are not many philosophical doctrines,
perhaps, established upon a more probable foundation, than that of
the propagation of Sound by means of the pulses or vibrations of
the air. The experiment of the bell, which, in an exhausted re∣ceiver,
produces no sensible Sound, would alone render this doctrine
somewhat more than probable. But this great probability is still
further confirmed by the computations of Sir Isaac Newton, who
has shown that, what is called the velocity of Sound, or the time
which passes between the commencement of the action of the sound∣ing
body, and that of the Sensation in our ear, is perfectly suitable
to the velocity with which the pulses and vibrations of an elastic
fluid of the same density with the air, are naturally propagated.
Dr. Franklin has made objections to this doctrine, but, I think,
without success.</P>
<P>Such are the intermediate causes by which philosophers have
endeavoured to connect the Sensations in our organs, with the
distant bodies which excite them. How those intermediate causes,
by the different motions and vibrations which they may be supposed
to excite on our organs, produce there those different Sensations,
none of which bear the smallest resemblance to vibration or motion
of any kind, no philosopher has yet attempted to explain to us.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Sense of SEEING.</HEAD>
<P>DR. BERKLEY, in his New Theory of Vision, one of the finest
examples of philosophical analysis that is to be found, either in our
own, or in any other language, has explained, so very distinctly,
the nature of the objects of Sight: their dissimilitude to, as well
as their correspondence and connection with those of Touch,
<PB N="216" REF="301"/>
that I have scarcely any thing to add to what he has already done.
It is only in order to render some things, which I shall have occa∣sion
to say hereafter, intelligible to such readers as may not have
had an opportunity of studying his book, that I have presumed
to treat of the same subject, after so great a Master. Whatever I
shall say upon it, if not directly borrowed from him, has at least
been suggested by what he has already said.</P>
<P>That the objects of Sight are not perceived as resisting or pressing
upon the organ which perceives them, is sufficiently obvious. They
cannot therefore suggest, at least in the same manner, as the objects
of Touch, the externality and independency of their existence.</P>
<P>We are apt, however, to imagine that we see objects at a dis∣tance
from us, and that consequently the externality of their exist∣ence
is immediately perceived by our Sight. But if we consider
that the distance of any object from the eye, is a line turned end∣ways
to it; and that this line must consequently appear to it but
as one point; we shall be sensible that distance from the eye cannot
be the immediate object of Sight, but that all visible objects must
naturally be perceived as close upon the organ, or more properly,
perhaps, like all other Sensations, as in the organ which perceives
them. That the objects of Sight are all painted in the bottom of
the eye, upon a membrane called the <HI>retina,</HI> pretty much in the
same manner as the like objects are painted in a Camera Obscura, is
well known to whoever has the slightest tincture of the science of
Optics; and the principle of perception, it is probable, originally
perceives them, as existing in that part of the organ, and nowhere
but in that part of the organ. No Optician, accordingly, no per∣son
who has ever bestowed any moderate degree of attention upon
the nature of Vision, has ever pretended that distance from the eye
was the immediate object of Sight. How it is that, by means of
<PB N="217" REF="302"/>
our Sight, we learn to judge of such distances, Opticians have
endeavoured to explain in several different ways. I shall not, how∣ever,
at present, stop to examine their systems.</P>
<P>The objects of Touch are solidity, and those modifications of
solidity which we consider as essential to it, and inseparable from it;
solid extension, figure, divisibility, and mobility.</P>
<P>The objects of Sight are colour, and those modifications of colour
which, in the same manner, we consider as essential to it, and inse∣parable
from it; coloured extension, figure, divisibility, and mo∣bility.
When we open our eyes, the sensible coloured objects,
which present themselves to us, must all have a certain extension,
or must occupy a certain portion of the visible surface which ap∣pears
before us. They must too have all a certain figure, or must
be bounded by certain visible lines, which mark upon that surface
the extent of their respective dimensions. Every sensible portion of
this visible or coloured extension must be conceived as divisible, or
as separable into two, three, or more parts. Every portion too of
this visible or coloured surface must be conceived as moveable, or as
capable of changing its situation, and of assuming a different ar∣rangement
with regard to the other portions of the same surface.</P>
<P>Colour, the visible, bears no resemblance to solidity, the tangible
object. A man born blind, or who has lost his Sight so early as to
have no remembrance of visible objects, can form no idea or con∣ception
of colour. Touch alone can never help him to it. I have
heard, indeed, of some persons who had lost their Sight after the age
of manhood, and who had learned to distinguish, by the Touch alone,
the different colours of cloths or silks, the goods which it happened to
be their business to deal in. The powers by which different bodies
<PB N="218" REF="303"/>
excite in the organs of the Sensations of different colours,
probably depend upon some difference in the nature, configuration,
and arrangement of the parts which compose their respective sur∣faces.
This difference may, to a very nice and delicate touch, make
some difference in the feeling, sufficient to enable a person, much
interested in the case, to make this distinction in some degree,
though probably in a very imperfect and inaccurate one. A man
born blind might possibly be taught to make the same distinctions.
But though he might thus be able to name the different colours,
which those different surfaces reflected, though he might thus have
some imperfect notion of the remote causes of these Sensations, he
could have no better idea of the Sensations themselves, than that
other blind man, mentioned by Mr. Locke, had, who said that he
imagined the Colour of Scarlet resembled the Sound of a Trumpet.
A man born deaf may, in the same manner, be taught to speak
articulately. He is taught how to shape and dispose of his organs,
so as to pronounce each letter, syllable, and word. But still, though
he may have some imperfect idea of the remote causes of the
Sounds which he himself utters, of the remote causes of the Sensa∣tions
which he himself excites in other people; he can have none
of those Sounds or Sensations themselves.</P>
<P>If it were possible, in the same manner, that a man could be
born without the Sense of Touching, that of Seeing could never
alone suggest to him the idea of Solidity, or enable him to form
any notion of the external and resisting substance. It is probable,
however, not only that no man, but that no animal was ever born
without the Sense of Touching, which seems essential to, and inse∣parable
from, the nature of animal life and existence. It is un∣necessary,
therefore, to throw away any reasoning, or to hazard
any conjectures, about what might be the effects of what I look
<PB N="219" REF="304"/>
upon as altogether an impossible supposition. The eye when pressed
upon by any external and solid substance, feels, no doubt, that
pressure and resistance, and suggests to us (in the same manner as
every other feeling part of the body) the external and independent
existence of that solid substance. But in this case, the eye acts, not
as the organ of Sight, but as an organ of Touch; for the eye possesses
the Sense of Touching in common with almost all the other parts of
the body.</P>
<P>The extension, figure, divisibility, and mobility of Colour, the
sole object of Sight, though, on account of their correspondence and
connection with the extension, figure, divisibility, and mobility of
Solidity, they are called by the same name, yet seem to bear no sort
of resemblance to their namesakes. As Colour and Solidity bear no
sort of resemblance to one another, so neither can their respective
modifications. Dr. Berkley very justly observes, that though we
can conceive either a coloured or a solid line to be prolonged inde∣finitely,
yet we cannot conceive the one to be added to the other.
We cannot, even in imagination, conceive an object of Touch to
be prolonged into an object of Sight, or an object of Sight into an
object of Touch. The objects of Sight and those of Touch consti∣tute
two worlds, which, though they have a most important cor∣respondence
and connection with one another, bear no sort of re∣semblance
to one another. The tangible world, as well as all the
different parts which compose it, has three dimensions, Length,
Breadth, and Depth. The visible world, as well as all the different
parts which compose it, has only two, Length and Breadth. It
presents to us only a plain or surface, which, by certain shades and
combinations of Colour, suggests and represents to us (in the same
manner as a picture does) certain tangible objects which have no
Colour, and which therefore can bear no resemblance to those shades
and combinations of Colour. Those shades and combinations sug∣gest
<PB N="220" REF="305"/>
those different tangible objects as at different distances, accord∣ing
to certain rules of Perspective, which it is, perhaps, not very
easy to say how it is that we learn, whether by some particular in∣stinct,
or by some application of either reason or experience, which
has become so perfectly habitual to us, that we are scarcely sensible
when we make use of it.</P>
<P>The distinctness of this Perspective, the precision and accuracy
with which, by means of it, we are capable of judging concerning
the distance of different tangible objects, is greater or less, exactly in
proportion as this distinctness, as this precision and accuracy are of
more or less importance to us. We can judge of the distance of
near objects, of the chairs and tables, for example, in the chamber
where we are sitting, with the most perfect precision and accuracy;
and if in broad day-light we ever stumble over any of them, it must
be, not from any error in the Sight, but from some defect in the
attention. The precision and accuracy of our judgment concerning
such near objects are of the utmost importance to us, and constitute
the great advantage which a man who sees has over one who is unfor∣tunately
blind. As the distance increases, the distinctness of this Per∣spective,
the precision and accuracy of our judgment gradually di∣minish.
Of the tangible objects which are even at the moderate
distance of one, two, or three miles from the eye, we are frequently at
a loss to determine which is nearest, and which remotest. It is seldom
of much importance to us to judge with precision concerning the situ∣ation
of the tangible objects which are even at this moderate dis∣tance.
As the distance increases, our judgments become more and
more uncertain; and at a very great distance, such as that of the
fixed stars, it becomes altogether uncertain. The most precise
knowledge of the relative situation of such objects could be of no
other use to us than to satisfy the most unnecessary curiosity.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="306"/>
The distances at which different men can by Sight distinguish,
with some degree of precision, the situation of the tangible objects
which the visible ones represent, is very different; and this difference,
though it, no doubt, may sometimes depend upon some difference
in the original configuration of their eyes, yet seems frequently to
arise altogether from the different customs and habits which their
respective occupations have led them to contract. Men of letters,
who live much in their closets, and have seldom occasion to look at
very distant objects, are seldom far-sighted. Mariners, on the con∣trary,
almost always are; those especially who have made many
distant voyages, in which they have been the greater part of their
time out of sight of land, and have in day-light been constantly
looking out towards the horizon for the appearance of some ship, or
of some distant shore. It often astonishes a land-man to observe
with what precision a sailor can distinguish in the Offing, not only
the appearance of a ship, which is altogether invisible to the land∣man,
but the number of her masts, the direction of her course, and
the rate of her sailing. If she is a ship of his acquaintance, he fre∣quently
can tell her name, before the land-man has been able to dis∣cover
even the appearance of a ship.</P>
<P>Visible objects, Colour, and all its different modifications, are in
themselves mere shadows or pictures, which seem to float, as it
were, before the organ of Sight. In themselves, and independent
of their connection with the tangible objects which they represent,
they are of no importance to us, and can essentially neither benefit
us nor hurt us. Even while we see them we are seldom thinking
of them. Even when we appear to be looking at them with
the greatest earnestness, our whole attention is frequently em∣ployed,
not upon them, but upon the tangible objects represented by
them.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="307"/>
It is because almost our whole attention is employed, not upon
the visible and representing, but upon the tangible and represented
objects, that in our imaginations we are apt to ascribe to the former
a degree of magnitude which does not belong to them, but which
belongs altogether to the latter. If you shut one eye, and hold im∣mediately
before the other a small circle of plain glass, of not more
than half an inch in diameter, you may see through that circle the
most extensive prospects; lawns and woods, and arms of the sea,
and distant mountains. You are apt to imagine that the Landscape
which is thus presented to you, that the visible Picture which you
thus see, is immensely great and extensive. The tangible objects
which this visible Picture represents, undoubtedly are so. But the
visible Picture which represents them can be no greater than the little
visible circle through which you see it. If while you are looking
through this circle, you could conceive a fairy hand and a fairy pencil
to come between your eye and the glass, that pencil could delineate
upon that little glass the outline of all those extensive lawns and
woods, and arms of the sea, and distant mountains, in the full and
exact dimensions with which they are really seen by the eye.</P>
<P>Every visible object which covers from the eye any other visible
object, must appear at least as large as that other visible object. It
must occupy at least an equal portion of that visible plain or surface
which is at that time presented to the eye. Opticians accordingly
tell us, that all the visible objects which are seen under equal angles
must to the eye appear equally large. But the visible object, which
covers from the eye any other visible object, must necessarily be
seen under angles at least equally large as those under which that
other object is seen. When I hold up my finger, however, before
my eye, it appears to cover the greater part of the visible chamber
in which I am sitting. It should therefore appear as large as the
<PB N="223" REF="308"/>
greater part of that visible chamber. But because I know that the
tangible finger bears but a very small proportion to the greater part
of the tangible chamber, I am apt to fancy that the visible finger
bears but a like proportion to the greater part of the visible chamber.
My judgment corrects my eye-sight, and, in my fancy, reduces
the visible object, which represents the little tangible one, below its
real visible dimensions; and, on the contrary, it augments the visible
object which represents the great tangible one a good deal beyond
those dimensions. My attention being generally altogether occupied
about the tangible and represented, and not at all about the visible
and representing objects, my careless fancy bestows upon the latter
a proportion which does not in the least belong to them, but which
belongs altogether to the former.</P>
<P>It is because the visible object which covers any other visible ob∣ject
must always appear at least as large as that other object, that
Opticians tell us that the sphere of our vision appears to the eye al∣ways
equally large; and that when we hold our hand before our
eye in such a manner that we see nothing but the inside of the hand,
we still see precisely the same number of visible points, the sphere
of our vision is still as completely filled, the retina is as entirely
covered with the object which is thus presented to it, as when we
survey the most extensive horizon.</P>
<P>A young gentleman who was born with a cataract upon each of his
eyes was, in one thousand seven hundred and twenty-eight, couched
by Mr. Cheselden, and by that means for the first time made to see
distinctly. “At first, says the operator, he could bear but very
little Sight, and the things he saw he thought extremely large;
but upon seeing things larger, those first seen he conceived less,
never being able to imagine any lines beyond the bounds he saw;
the room he was in, he said, he knew to be but part of the house,
<PB N="224" REF="309"/>
“yet he could not conceive that the whole house would look
bigger.” It was unavoidable that he should at first conceive, that
no visible object could be greater, could present to his eye a greater
number of visible points, or could more completely fill the compre∣hension
of that organ, than the narrowest sphere of his vision. And
when that sphere came to be enlarged, he still could not conceive
that the visible objects which it presented could be larger than those
which he had first seen. He must probably by this time have been
in some degree habituated to the connection between visible and
tangible objects, and enabled to conceive that visible object to be
small which represented a small tangible object; and that to be great,
which represented a great one. The great objects did not appear
to his Sight greater than the small ones had done before; but the
small ones, which, having filled the whole sphere of his vision, had
before appeared as large as possible, being now known to represent
much smaller tangible objects, seemed in his conception to grow
smaller. He had begun now to employ his attention more about
the tangible and represented, than about the visible and representing
objects; and he was beginning to ascribe to the latter, the proportions
and dimensions which properly belonged altogether to the former.</P>
<P>As we frequently ascribe to the objects of Sight a magnitude and
proportion which does not really belong to them, but to the objects
of Touch which they represent, so we likewise ascribe to them a
steadiness of appearance, which as little belongs to them, but which
they derive altogether from their connection with the same objects of
Touch. The chair which now stands at the farther end of the room,
I am apt to imagine, appears to my eye as large as it did when it
slood close by me, when it was seen under angles at least four times
larger than those under which it is seen at present, and when it must
have occupied, at least, sixteen times that portion which it occupies
at present, of the visible plain or surface which is now before my
<PB N="225" REF="310"/>
eyes. But as I know that the magnitude of the tangible and repre∣sented
chair, the principal object of my attention, is the same in
both situations, I ascribe to the visible and representing chair (though
now reduced to less than the sixteenth part of its former dimen∣sions)
a steadiness of appearance, which certainly belongs not in
any respect to it, but altogether to the tangible and represented one.
As we approach to, or retire from, the tangible object which any
visible one represents, the visible object gradually augments in the
one case, and diminishes in the other. To speak accurately, it is
not the same visible object which we see at different distances, but a
succession of visible objects, which, though they all resemble one
another, those especially which follow near after one another; yet
are all really different and distinct. But as we know that the
tangible object which they represent remains always the same, we
ascribe to them too a sameness which belongs altogether to it: and
we fancy that we see the same tree at a mile, at half a mile, and at
a few yards distance. At those different distances, however, the
visible objects are so very widely different, that we are sensible of a
change in their appearance. But still, as the tangible object which
they represent remains invariably the same, we ascribe a sort of
sameness even to them too.</P>
<P>It has been said, that no man ever saw the same visible object
twice; and this, though, no doubt, an exaggeration, is, in reality,
much less so than at first view it appears to be. Though I am apt
to fancy that all the chairs and tables, and other little pieces of fur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iture
in the room where I am sitting, appear to my eye always the
same, yet their appearance is in reality continually varying, not
only according to every variation in their situation and distance
with regard to where I am sitting, but according to every, even the
most insensible variation in the altitude of my body, in the move∣ment
of my head, or even in that of my eyes. The perspective
<PB N="226" REF="311"/>
necessarily varies according to all, even the smallest of these varia∣tions;
and consequently the appearance of the objects which that
perspective presents to me. Observe what difficulty a portrait painter
finds, in getting the person who sits for his picture to present to him
precisely that view of the countenance from which the first outline
was drawn. The painter is scarce ever completely satisfied with the
situation of the face which is presented to him, and finds that it is
scarcely ever precisely the same with that from which he rapidly
sketched the first outline. He endeavours, as well as he can, to
correct the difference from memory, from fancy, and from a sort of
art of approximation, by which he strives to express as nearly as
he can, the ordinary effect of the look, air, and character of the
person whose picture he is drawing. The person who draws from
a statue, which is altogether immoveable, feels a difficulty, though,
no doubt, in a less degree, of the same kind. It arises altogether
from the difficulty which he finds in placing his own eye precisely in
the same situation during the whole time which he employs in
completing his drawing. This difficulty is more than doubled upon
the painter who draws from a living subject. The statue never is
the cause of any variation or unsteadiness in its own appearance.
The living subject frequently is.</P>
<P>The benevolent purpose of nature in bestowing upon us the sense
of seeing, is evidently to inform us concerning the situation and
distance of the tangible objects which surround us. Upon the
knowledge of this distance and situation depends the whole conduct
of human life, in the most trifling as well as in the most important
transactions. Even animal motion depends upon it; and without
it we could neither move, nor even sit still, with complete security.
The objects of sight, as Dr. Berkley sinely observes, constitute a
sort of language which the Author of Nature addresses to our eyes,
and by which he informs us of many things, which it is of the
<PB N="227" REF="312"/>
utmost importance to us to know. As, in common language, the
words or sounds bear no resemblance to the things which they de∣note,
so, in this other language, the visible objects bear no sort of
resemblance to the tangible object which they represent, and of
whose relative situation, with regard both to ourselves and to one
another, they inform us.</P>
<P>He acknowledges, however, that though scarcely any word be by
nature better fitted to express one meaning than any other meaning,
yet that certain visible objects are better fitted than others to repre∣sent
certain tangible objects. A visible square, for example, is bet∣ter
fitted than a visible circle to represent a tangible square. There
is, perhaps, strictly speaking, no such thing as either a visible cube,
or a visible globe, the objects of sight being all naturally presented
to the eye as upon one surface. But still there are certain combina∣tions
of colours which are fitted to represent to the eye, both the
near and the distant, both the advancing and the receding lines,
angles, and surfaces of the tangible cube; and there are others fitted
to represent, in the same manner, both the near and the receding
surface of the tangible globe. The combination which represents
the tangible cube, would not be fit to represent the tangible globe;
and that which represents the tangible globe, would not be fit to
represent the tangible cube. Though there may, therefore, be no
resemblance between visible and tangible objects, there seems to be
some affinity or correspondence between them sufficient to make
each visible object fitter to represent a certain precise tangible object
than any other tangible object. But the greater part of words seem
to have no sort of afsinity or correspondence with the meanings or
ideas which they express; and if custom had so ordered it, they
might with equal propriety have been made use of to express any
other meanings or ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="313"/>
Dr. Berkley, with that happiness of illustration which scarcely ever
deserts him, remarks, that this in reality is no more than what hap∣pens
in common language; and that though letters bear no sort of
resemblance to the words which they denote, yet that the same com∣bination
of letters which represents one word, would not always be
sit to represent another; and that each word is always best repre∣sented
by its own proper combination of letters. The comparison,
however, it must be observed, is here totally changed. The con∣nection
between visible and tangible objects was first illustrated by
comparing it with, that between spoken language and the meanings
or ideas which spoken language suggests to us; and it is now illus∣trated
by the connection between written language and spoken lan∣guage,
which is altogether different. Even this second illustration,
besides, will not apply perfectly to the case. When custom, indeed,
has perfectly ascertained the powers of each letter; when it has
ascertained, for example, that the first letter of the alphabet shall
always represent such a sound, and the second letter such another
sound; each word comes then to be more properly represented by
one certain combination of written letters or characters, than it
could be by any other combination. But still the characters them∣selves
are altogether arbitrary, and have no sort of affinity or cor∣respondence
with the articulate sounds which they denote. The
character which marks the first letter of the alphabet, for example,
if custom had so ordered it, might, with perfect propriety, have
been made use of to express the sound which we now annex to the
second, and the character of the second to express that which we now
annex to the first. But the visible characters which represent to our
eyes the tangible globe, could not so well represent the tangible
cube; nor could those which represent the tangible cube, so pro∣perly
represent the tangible globe. There is evidently, therefore, a
certain affinity and correspondence between each visible object and
<PB N="229" REF="314"/>
the precise tangible object represented by it, much superior to what
takes place either between written and spoken language, or between
spoken language and the ideas or meanings which it suggests. The
language which nature addresses to our eyes, has evidently a fitness
of representation, an aptitude for signifying the precise things which
it denotes, much superior to that of any of the artificial languages
which human art and ingenuity have ever been able to invent.</P>
<P>That this affinity and correspondence, however, between visible
and tangible objects could not alone, and without the assistance of
observation and experience, teach us, by any effort of reason, to
infer what was the precise tangible object which each visible one
represented, if it is not sufficiently evident from what has been
already said, it must be completely so from the remarks of Mr.
Cheselden upon the young gentleman above-mentioned, whom he
had couched for a cataract. “Though we say of this gentleman,
that he was blind,” observes Mr. Cheselden, “as we do of all
people who have ripe cataracts; yet they are never so blind from
that cause but that they can discern day from night; and for the
most part, in a strong light, distinguish black, white, and scarlet;
but they cannot perceive the shape of any thing; for the light by
which these perceptions are made, being let in obliquely through
the aqueous humour, or the anterior surface of the crystalline,
(by which the rays cannot be brought into a focus upon the
retina,) they can discern in no other manner than a found eye
can through a glass of broken jelly, where a great variety of sur∣faces
so differently refract the light, that the several distinct pen∣cils
of rays cannot be collected by the eye into their proper foci;
wherefore the shape of an object in such a case cannot be at all
discerned, though the colour may: and thus it was with this
young gentleman, who, though he knew those colours asunder in
a good light, yet when he saw them after he was couched, the
<PB N="230" REF="315"/>
faint ideas he had of them before were not sufficient for him to
know them by afterwards; and therefore he did not think them
the same which he had before known by those names.” This
young gentleman, therefore, had some advantage over one who
from a state of total blindness had been made for the first time to
see. He had some imperfect notion of the distinction of colours;
and he must have known that those colours had some sort of con∣nection
with the tangible objects which he had been accustomed to
feel. But had he emerged from total blindness, he could have learnt
this connection only from a very long course of observation and
experience. How little this advantage availed him, however, we
may learn partly from the passages of Mr. Cheselden's narrative, al∣ready
quoted, and still more from the following:</P>
<P>“When he first saw,” says that ingenious operator, “he was so
far from making any judgment about distances, that he thought
all objects whatever touched his eyes (as he expressed it) as what
he felt did his skin; and thought no objects so agreeable as those
which were smooth and regular, though he could form no judg∣ment
of their shape, or guess what it was in any object that was
pleasing to him. He knew not the shape of any thing, nor any
one thing from another, however different in shape or magni∣tude;
but upon being told what things were, whose form he be∣fore
knew from feeling, he would carefully observe, that he might
know them again; but having too many objects to learn at once,
he forgot many of them; and (as he said) at first learned to
know, and again forgot a thousand things in a day. One parti∣cular
only (though it may appear trifling) I will relate: Having
often forgot which was the cat, and which the dog, he was
ashamed to ask; but catching the cat (which he knew by feeling)
he was observed to look at her stedfastly, and then setting her
down, said, So, puss! I shall know you another time.”</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="316"/>
When the young gentleman said, that the objects which he saw
touched his eyes, he certainly could not mean that they pressed upon
or resisted his eyes; for the objects of sight never act upon the organ
in any way that refembles pressure or resistance. He could mean
no more than that they were close upon his eyes, or, to speak more
properly, perhaps, that they were in his eyes. A deaf man, who
was made all at once to hear, might in the same manner naturally
enough say, that the sounds which he heard touched his ears, mean∣ing
that he felt them as close upon his ears, or, to speak, perhaps,
more properly, as in his ears.</P>
<P>Mr. Cheselden adds afterwards: “We thought he soon knew
what pictures represented which were shewed to him, but we
found afterwards we were mistaken; for about two months after
he was couched, he discovered at once they represented solid
bodies, when, to that time, he considered them only as party∣coloured
planes, or surfaces diversified with variety of paints;
but even then he was no less surprised, expecting the pictures
would feel like the things they represented, and was amazed when
he found those parts, which by their light and shadow appeared
now round and uneven, felt only flat like the rest; and asked
which was the lying sense, feeling or seeing?”</P>
<P>Painting, though, by combinations of light and shade, similar to
those which Nature makes use of in the visible objects which she
presents to our eyes, it endeavours to imitate those objects; yet it
never has been able to equal the perspective of Nature, or to give
to its productions that force and distinctness of relief and projection
which Nature bestows upon hers. When the young gentleman was
just beginning to understand the strong and distinct perspective of
Nature, the faint and feeble perspective of Painting made no im∣pression
upon him, and the picture appeared to him what it really
<PB N="232" REF="317"/>
was, a plain surface bedaubed with different colours. When he be∣came
more familiar with the perspective of Nature, the inferiority of
that of Painting did not hinder him from discovering its resemblance
to that of Nature. In the perspective of Nature, he had always
found that the situation and distance of the tangible and represented
objects, corresponded exactly to what the visible and representing ones
suggested to him. He expected to find the same thing in the similar,
though inferior perspective of Painting, and was disappointed when
he found that the visble and tangible objects had not, in this case,
their usual correspondence.</P>
<P>“In a year after seeing,” adds Mr. Cheselden, “the young gen∣tleman
being carried upon Epsom-downs, and observing a large
prospect, he was exceedingly delighted with it, and called it a
new kind of seeing.” He had now, it is evident, come to under∣stand
completely the language of Vision. The visible objects which
this noble prospect presented to him did not now appear as touching,
or as close upon his eye. They did not now appear of the same
magnitude with those small objects to which, for some time after
the operation, he had been accustomed, in the little chamber where
he was confined. Those new visible objects at once, and as it were
of their own accord, assumed both the distance and the magnitude
of the great tangible objects which they represented. He had now,
therefore, it would seem, become completely master of the language
of Vision, and he had become so in the course of a year; a much
shorter period than that in which any person, arrived at the age of
manhood, could completely acquire any foreign language. It would
appear too, that he had made very considerable progress even in the
two first months. He began at that early period to understand even
the feeble perspective of Painting; and though at first he could not
distinguish it from the strong perspective of Nature, yet he could not
have been thus imposed upon by so imperfect an imitation, if the
<PB N="233" REF="318"/>
great principles of Vision had not beforehand been deeply impressed
upon his mind, and if he had not, either by the association of
ideas, or by some other unknown principle, been strongly deter∣mined
to expect certain tangible objects in consequence of the
visible ones which had been presented to him. This rapid progress,
however, may, perhaps, be accounted for from that fitness of re∣presentation,
which has already been taken notice of, between visible
and tangible objects. In this language of Nature, it may be said,
the analogies are more perfect; the etymologies, the declensions,
and conjugations, if one may say so, are more regular than those
of any human language. The rules are fewer, and those rules ad∣mit
of no exceptions.</P>
<P>But though it may have been altogether by the slow paces of ob∣servation
and experience that this young gentleman acquired the
knowledge of the connection between visible and tangible objects;
we cannot from thence with certainty infer, that young children
have not some instinctive perception of the same kind. In him this
instinctive power, not having been exerted at the proper season, may,
from disuse, have gone gradually to decay, and at last have been
completely obliterated. Or, perhaps, (what seems likewise very
possible,) some feeble and unobserved remains of it may have some∣what
facilitated his acquisition of what he might otherwise have
found it much more difficult to acquire.</P>
<P>That, antecedent to all experience, the young of at least the
greater part of animals possess some instinctive perception of this
kind, seems abundantly evident. The hen never feeds her young
by dropping the food into their bills, as the linnet and the thrush
feed theirs. Almost as soon as her chickens are hatched, she does
not feed them, but carries them to the field to feed, where they
<PB N="234" REF="319"/>
walk about at their ease, it would seem, and appear to have the most
distinct perception of all the tangible objects which surround them.
We may often see them, accordingly, by the straightest road, run
to and pick up any little grains which she shews them, even at the
distance of several yards; and they no sooner come into the light
than they seem to understand this language of Vision as well as they
ever do afterwards. The young of the partridge and of the grouse
seem to have, at the same early period, the most distinct perceptions
of the same kind. The young partridge, almost as soon it comes
from the shell, runs about among long grass and corn; the young
grouse among long heath, and would both most essentially hurt
themselves if they had not the most acute, as well as distinct per∣ception
of the tangible objects which not only surround them but
press upon them on all sides. This is the case too with the young
of the goose, of the duck, and, so far as I have been able to observe,
with those of at least the greater part of the birds which make their
nests upon the ground, with the greater part of those which are
ranked by Linnaeus in the orders of the hen and the goose, and of
many of those long-shanked and wading birds which he places in
the order that he distinguishes by the name of Grallae.</P>
<P>The young of those birds that build their nests in bushes, upon
trees, in the holes and crevices of high walls, upon high rocks and
precipices, and other places of difficult access; of the greater part
of those ranked by Linnaeus in the orders of the hawk, the magpie,
and the sparrow, seem to come blind from the shell, and to con∣tinue
so for at least some days thereafter. Till they are able to fly
they are fed by the joint labour of both parents. As soon as that
period arrives, however, and probably for some time before, they
evidently enjoy all the powers of Vision in the most complete per∣fection,
and can distinguish with most exact precision the shape and
<PB N="235" REF="320"/>
proportion of the tangible objects which every visible one represents.
In so short a period they cannot be supposed to have acquired those
powers from experience, and must therefore derive them from some
instinctive suggestion. The sight of birds seems to be both more
prompt and more acute than that of any other animals. Without
hurting themselves they dart into the thickest and most thorny
bushes, fly with the utmost rapidity through the most intricate fo∣rests,
and while they are soaring aloft in the air, discover upon the
ground the little insects and grains upon which they feed.</P>
<P>The young of several sorts of quadrupeds seem, like those of the
greater part of birds which make their nests upon the ground, to
enjoy as soon as they come into the world the faculty of seeing as
completely as they ever do afterwards. The day, or the day after
they are dropt, the calf follows the cow, and the foal the mare, to
the field; and though from timidity they seldom remove far from
the mother, yet they seem to walk about at their ease; which they
could not do unless they could distinguish, with some degree of pre∣cision,
the shape and proportion of the tangible objects which each
visible one represents. The degree of precision, however, with
which the horse is capable of making this distinction, seems at no
period of his life to be very complete. He is at all times apt to
startle at many visible objects, which, if they distinctly suggested to
him the real shape and proportion of the tangible objects which they
represent, could not be the objects of fear; at the trunk or root of
an old tree, for example, which happens to be laid by the road side,
at a great stone, or the fragment of a rock which happens to lie near
the way where he is going. To reconcile him, even to a single ob∣ject
of this kind, which has once alarmed him, frequently requires
some skill, as well as much patience and good temper, in the rider.
Such powers of sight, however, as Nature has thought proper to
<PB N="236" REF="321"/>
render him capable of acquiring, he seems to enjoy from the begin∣ning,
in as great perfection as he ever does afterwards.</P>
<P>The young of other quadrupeds, like those of the birds which
make their nests in places of difficult access, come blind into the
world. Their sight, however, soon opens, and as soon as it does so,
they seem to enjoy it in the most complete perfection, as we may
all observe in the puppy and the kitten. The same thing, I believe,
may be said of all other beasts of prey, at least of all those concern∣ing
which I have been able to collect any distinct information.
They come blind into the world; but as soon as their sight opens,
they appear to enjoy it in the most complete perfection.</P>
<P>It seems difficult to suppose that man is the only animal of which
the young are not endowed with some instinctive perception of this
kind. The young of the human species, however, continue so long
in a state of entire dependency, they must be so long carried about
in the arms of their mothers or of their nurses, that such an instinc∣tive
perception may seem less necessary to them than to any other
race of animals. Before it could be of any use to them, observation
and experience may, by the known principle of the association of
ideas, have sufficiently connected in their young minds each visible
object with the corresponding tangible one which it is fitted to re∣present.
Nature, it may be said, never bestows upon any animal
any faculty which is not either necessary or useful, and an instinct of
this kind would be altogether useless to an animal which must ne∣cessarily
acquire the knowledge which the instinct is given to supply,
long before that instinct could be of any use to it. Children, how∣ever,
appear at so very early a period to know the distance, the
shape, and magnitude of the different tangible objects which are
presented to them, that I am disposed to believe that even they may
<PB N="237" REF="322"/>
have some instinctive perception of this kind; though possibly in a
much weaker degree than the greater part of other animals. A
child that is scarcely a month old, stretches out its hands to feel any
little play-thing that is presented to it. It distinguishes its nurse,
and the other people who are much about it, from strangers. It
clings to the former, and turns away from the latter. Hold a small
looking-glass before a child of not more than two or three months
old, and it will stretch out its little arms behind the glass, in order
to feel the child which it sees, and which it imagines is at the back
of the glass. It is deceived, no doubt; but even this sort of decep∣tion
sufficiently demonstrates that it has a tolerably distinct appre∣hension
of the ordinary perspective of Vision, which it cannot well
have learnt from observation and experience.</P>
<P>Do any of our other senses, antecedently to such observation and
experience, instinctively suggest to us some conception of the solid and
resisting substances which excite their respective sensations; though
these sensations bear no sort of resemblance to those substances?</P>
<P>The sense of Tasting certainly does not. Before we can feel the
sensation, the solid and resisting substance which excites it must be
pressed against the organs of Taste, and must consequently be per∣ceived
by them. Antecedently to observation and experience, there∣fore,
the sense of Tasting can never be said instinctively to suggest
some conception of that substance.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be otherwise with the sense of Smelling. The
young of all suckling animals, (of the Mammalia of Linnaeus,) whe∣ther
they are born with sight or without it, yet as soon as they come
into the world apply to the nipple of the mother in order to suck.
In doing this they are evidently directed by the Smell. The Smell
appears either to excite the appetite for the proper food, or at least
<PB N="238" REF="323"/>
to direct the new-born animal to the place where that food is to be
found. It may perhaps do both the one and the other.</P>
<P>That when the stomach is empty, the Smell of agreeable food
excites and irritates the appetite, is what we all must have frequently
experienced. But the stomach of every new-born animal is neces∣sarily
empty. While in the womb it is nourished, not by the mouth,
but by the navel-string. Children have been born apparently in the
most perfect health and vigour, and have applied to suck in the
usual manner; but immediately, or soon after, have thrown up the
milk, and in the course of a few hours have died vomiting and in
convulsions. Upon opening their bodies it has been found that the
intestinal tube or canal had never been opened or pierced in the
whole extent of its length; but, like a sack, admitted of no passage
beyond a particular place. It could not have been in any respect by
the mouth, therefore, but altogether by the navel-string, that such
children had been nourished and fed up to the degree of health and
vigour in which they were born. Every animal, while in the
womb, seems to draw its nourishment, more like a vegetable, from
the root, than like an animal from the mouth; and that nourish∣ment
seems to be conveyed to all the different parts of the body by
tubes and canals in many respects different from those which after∣wards
perform the same function. As soon as it comes into the
world, this new set of tubes and canals, which the providential care
of Nature had for a long time before been gradually preparing, is all
at once and instantaneously opened. They are all empty, and they
require to be filled. An uneasy sensation accompanies the one situa∣tion,
and an agreeable one the other. The smell of the substance
which is fitted for filling them, increases and irritates that uneasy
sensation, and produces hunger, or the appetite for food.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="324"/>
But all the appetites which take their origin from a certain state
of the body, seem to suggest the means of their own gratification;
and, even long before experience, some anticipation or preconcep∣tion
of the pleasure which attends that gratification. In the appe∣tite
for sex, which frequently, I am disposed to believe almost
always, comes a long time before the age of puberty, this is per∣fectly
and distinctly evident. The appetite for food suggests to the
new-born infant the operation of sucking, the only means by which
it can possibly gratify that appetite. It is continually sucking. It
sucks whatever is presented to its mouth. It sucks even when there
is nothing presented to its mouth, and some anticipation or precon∣ception
of the pleasure which it is to enjoy in sucking, seems to
make it delight in putting its mouth into the shape and configura∣tion
by which it alone can enjoy that pleasure. There are other
appetites in which the most unexperienced imagination produces a
similar effect upon the organs which Nature has provided for their
gratification.</P>
<P>The Smell not only excites the appetite, but directs to the object
which can alone gratify that appetite. But by suggesting the direc∣tion
towards that object, the Smell must necessarily suggest some no∣tion
of distance and externality, which are necessarily involved in
the idea of direction; in the idea of the line of motion by which
the distance can best be overcome, and the mouth brought into con∣tact
with the unknown substance which is the object of the appetite.
That the Smell should alone suggest any preconception of the shape
or magnitude of the external body to which it directs, seems not
very probable. The sensation of Smell seems to have no sort of
affinity or correspondence with shape or magnitude; and whatever
preconception the infant may have of these, (and it may very pro∣bably
have some such preconception,) is likely to be suggested, not
<PB N="240" REF="325"/>
so much directly by the Smell, and indirectly by the appetite excited
by that Smell; as by the principle which teaches the child to mould
its mouth into the conformation and action of sucking, even before it
reaches the object to which alone that conformation and action can
be usefully applied.</P>
<P>The Smell, however, as it suggests the direction by which the
external body must be approached, must suggest at least some vague
idea or preconception of the existence of that body; of the thing
to which it directs, though not perhaps of the precise shape and
magnitude of that thing. The infant, too, feeling its mouth at∣tracted
and drawn as it were towards that external body, must con∣ceive
the Smell which thus draws and attracts it, as something be∣longing
to or proceeding from that body, or what is afterwards de∣nominated
and obscurely understood to be as a sort of quality or
attribute of that body.</P>
<P>The Smell, too, may very probably suggest some even tolerably
distinct perception of the Taste of the food to which it directs. The
respective objects of our different external senses seem, indeed, the
greater part of them, to bear no sort of resemblance to one ano∣ther.
Colour bears no sort of resemblance to Solidity, nor to
Heat, nor to Cold, nor to Sound, nor to Smell, nor to Taste.
To this general rule, however, there seems to be one, and per∣haps
but one exception. The sensations of Smell and Taste seem
evidently to bear some sort of resemblance to one another. Smell
appears to have been given to us by Nature as the director of Taste.
It announces, as it were, before trial, what is likely to be the Taste
of the food which is set before us. Though perceived by a differ∣ent
organ, it seems in many cases to be but a weaker sensation
nearly of the same kind with that of the Taste which that announces.
It is very natural to suppose, therefore, that the Smell may suggest
<PB N="241" REF="326"/>
to the infant some tolerably distinct preconception of the Taste of the
food which it announces, and may, even before experience, make
its mouth, as we say, water for that food.</P>
<P>That numerous division of animals which Linnaeus ranks under
the class of <HI>worms,</HI> have, scarcely any of them, any head. They
neither see nor hear, have neither eyes nor ears; but many of
them have the power of self-motion, and appear to move about
in search of their food. They can be directed in this search by no
other sense than that of Smelling. The most accurate microscopical
observations, however, have never been able to discover in such
animals any distinct organ of Smell. They have a mouth and a sto∣mach,
but no nostrils. The organ of Taste, it is probable, has in
them a sensibility of the same kind with that which the olfactory
nerves have in more perfect animals. They may, as it were, taste
at a distance, and be attracted to their food by an affection of the
same organ by which they afterwards enjoy it; and Smell and Taste
may in them be no otherwise distinguished than as weaker or stronger
sensations derived from the same organ.</P>
<P>The sensations of Heat and Cold, when excited by the pressure
of some body either heated or cooled beyond the actual temperature
of our own organs, cannot be said, antecedently to observation and
experience, instinctively to suggest any conception of the solid and
resisting substance which excites them. What was said of the sense
of Taste may very properly be said here. Before we can feel those
sensations, the pressure of the external body which excites them
must necessarily suggest, not only some conception, but the most
distinct conviction of its own external and independent existence.</P>
<P>It may be otherwise, perhaps, when those sensations are either
of them excited by the temperature of the external air. In a calm
<PB N="242" REF="327"/>
day when there is no wind, we scarcely perceive the external air as
a solid body; and the sensations of Heat and Cold, it may be
thought, are then felt merely as affections of our own body, with∣out
any reference to any thing external. Several cases, however,
may be conceived, in which it must be allowed, I imagine, that
those sensations, even when excited in this manner, must suggest
some vague notion of some external thing or substance which
excites them. A new-born animal, which had the power of self-motion,
and which felt its body, either agreeably or disagreeably,
more heated or more cooled on the one side than on the other,
would, I imagine, instinctively, and antecedently to all observation
and experience, endeavour to move towards the side in which it felt
the agreeable, and to withdraw from that in which it felt the dis∣agreeable
sensation. But the very desire of motion supposes some
notion or preconception of externality; and the desire to move to∣wards
the side of the agreeable, or from that of the disagreeable sen∣sation,
supposes at least some vague notion of some external thing or
place which is the cause of those respective sensations.</P>
<P>The degrees of Heat and Cold which are agreeable, it has been
found from experience, are likewise healthful; and those which are
disagreeable, unwholesome. The degree of their unwholesomeness,
too, seems to be pretty much in proportion to that of their disagree∣ableness.
If either of them is so disagreeable as to be painful, it is
generally destructive; and that, too, in a very short period of time.
Those sensations appear to have been given us for the preservation
of our own bodies. They necessarily excite the desire of changing
our situation when it is unwholesome or destructive; and when it
is healthy, they allow us, or rather they entice us, to remain in it.
But the desire of changing our situation necessarily supposes some
idea of externality; or of motion into a place different from that
in which we actually are; and even the desire of remaining in the
<PB N="243" REF="328"/>
same place supposes some idea of at least the possibility of changing.
Those sensations could not well have answered the intention of
Nature, had they not thus instinctively suggested some vague notion
of external existence.</P>
<P>That Sound, the object of the sense of Hearing, though perceived
itself as in the ear, and nowhere but in the ear, may likewise, in∣stinctively,
and antecedently to all observation and experience,
obscurely suggest some vague notion of some external substance or
thing which excites it, I am much disposed to believe. I acknow∣ledge,
however, that I have not been able to recollect any one
instance in which this sense seems so distinctly to produce this effect,
as that of Seeing, that of Smelling, and even that of Heat and Cold,
appear to do in some particular cases. Unusual and unexpected
Sound alarms always, and disposes us to look about for some external
substance or thing as the cause which excites it, or from which it
proceeds. Sound, however, considered merely as a sensation, or as
an affection of the organ of Hearing, can in most cases neither be∣nefit
nor hurt us. It may be agreeable or disagreeable, but in its
own nature it does not seem to announce any thing beyond the im∣mediate
feeling. It should not therefore excite any alarm. Alarm
is always the fear of some uncertain evil beyond what is imme∣diately
felt, and from some unknown and external cause. But all
animals, and men among the rest, feel some degree of this alarm,
start, are roused and rendered circumspect and attentive by unusual
and unexpected Sound. This effect, too, is produced so readily and
so instantaneously that it bears every mark of an instinctive sug∣gestion
of an impression immediately struck by the hand of Nature,
which does not wait for any recollection of past observation and
experience. The hare, and all those other timid animals to whom
slight is the only defence, are supposed to possess the sense of Hear∣ing
<PB N="244" REF="329"/>
in the highest degree of activeness. It seems to be the sense in
which cowards are very likely to excel.</P>
<P>The three senses of Seeing, Hearing, and Smelling, seem to be
given to us by Nature, not so much in order to inform us concern∣ing
the actual situation of our bodies, as concerning that of those
other external bodies, which, though at some distance from us, may
sooner or later affect that actual situation, and eventually either
benefit or hurt us.</P>
