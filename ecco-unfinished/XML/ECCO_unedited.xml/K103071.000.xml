<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF GRAFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Beggleave to recommend a trifling per∣formance to Your notice; nothing but my venturing to approach Your Grace on this occasion without introduction, could excuse my addressing you without a name: by this kind of sophistry, my Lord, we that set∣up for Poets attempt to palliate one pre∣sumption by another. As I have strong temptations to plead for the honor I now assume, so, I hope, I am not totally without pretensions to it. As an humble son of that Alma Mater, who has now bestowed on Your Grace the most honorable adoption, which maternal approbation had to give, I
<PB N="iv" REF="3" MS="y"/>
flatter myself that I stand in some degree of alliance to you; and if there be any thing in these scenes that deserves the name of Genius, I am happy in acquainting the world that I drew it from the same fountain, and, nearly, at the same period with Your Grace; though not in the same proportion.</P>
<P>As I only seek, by this offering, to amuse a leisure-hour, I have no right either to speak to Your Grace, or of Your Grace, as a Minister. Nevertheless, my Lord, in these ill-tempered times, I must be allowed to say, that there is some merit when your fortune needs no addition, and your rank cannot re∣ceive any, in standing-forth the servant and the sufferer of your country: I say the suf∣ferer, my Lord, because in your station you have to combat not only the envy▪ but the ingratitude of mankind.</P>
<P>In times of peace the Muses, more espe∣cially, look for protection at the thrones of Princes, and in the closets of Ministers. In seasons of public tranquillity, when good order and good humour obtain in a nation, the great may find an ear even for such trifles as I now lay before You. Did these times,
<PB N="v" REF="4" MS="y"/>
my Lord, answer that Description, I should have much to say to Your Grace on the Sub∣ject of the Stage, so applicable to noble uses, and of the low ebb at which Genius now stands, so much in need of cultivation; but these are topicks too harmonious for an aera that seems to delight in discord; and all the merit I can claim with Your Grace and the public is, that at a time when all other ano∣nymous writers have been scattering the seeds of discontent and disturbance, I have used my best endeavours in the following scenes to lead such of my countrymen, as have attended their representation, into a short paroxysm of complacency and good humour. I have the honor to be</P>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>A rocky shore, with a fisherman's cabbin in the cliff: a violent tempest with thunder and lightning: a ship discover'd stranded on the coast. The characters enter after having looked-out of their cabbin, as if waiting for the abatement of the storm.</STAGE>
<STAGE>GOODWIN, PHILIP, FANNY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT blows a rank storm; 'tis well, father, we haul'd the boat ashore before the weather came on; she's safe bestow'd, however, let what will happen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOODWIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Philip, we had need be provident: except that poor skiff, my child, what have we left in this world that we can call our own?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my thoughts now we live as happily in this poor hut, as we did yonder in the great house, when you was 'squire Belfield's principal tenant, and as topping a farmer as any in the whole county of Cornwall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOODWIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, child!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, never droop; to be sure, father, the 'squire has dealt hardly with you; and a mighty point, truly, he has gained; the ruin of an honest man. If those are to be the uses of a great estate, Heaven continue me what I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="9" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>FANNY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, brother, a good conscience in a coarse drugget is better than an aching heart in a silken gown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOODWIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, children, well, if you can bear misfortunes patiently, 'twere an ill office for me to repine; we have long till'd the earth for a subsistence; now, Philip, we must plough the ocean; in those waves lies our harvest; there, my brave lad, we have an equal inheritance with the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, father, the sea that feeds us, provides us an habitation here in the hollow of the cliff; I trust, the 'squire will exact no rent for this dwelling—Alas! that ever two brothers should have been so opposite as our merciless landlord, and the poor young gentleman they say is now dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOODWIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sirrah, I charge you, name not that unhappy youth to me any more; I was endeavouring to forget him and his misfortunes, when the sight of that vessel in distress brought him afresh to my remembrance; for, it seems, he perished by sea; the more shame upon him, whose cruel∣ty and injustice drove him thither; but come—the wind lulls apace; let us launch the boat, and make a trip to yonder vessel; if we can assist in light'ning her, perhaps, she may ride it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis to no purpose; the crew are coming ashore in their boat, I saw them enter the creek.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOODWIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you so? then do you and your sister step into the cabbin; make a good fire, and provide such fish and other stores as you have within: I will go down and meet them; whoever they may be, that have suffer'd this mis∣fortune on our coasts, let us remember, children, never to regard any man as an enemy, who stands in need of our protection.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm strongly tempted to go down <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the creek too; if father should light on any mischief—well, for once in my life I'll disobey him; sister, you can look to matters

<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have the people landed those chests we brought off with us in the boat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have, Sir; an old fisherman, whom we met, has shewn us here to a cavern in the clif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, where we have stow'd them all in safety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well. Where's my uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>On board; no persuasions can prevail on him to quit the ship, which, he swears, will lift with the tide; his old crony▪ the master is with him, and they ply the casks so briskly, that it seems a moot point, which fills the fastest, they, or the wreck.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange insensibility! but you must bring him off by force then, if there is no other way of saving him; I think o'my conscience he is as indifferent to danger as the plank he treads on; we are now thrown upon my un∣natural brother's estate; that house, Francis, which you see to the left, is his; and what may be the consequence if he and my uncle shou'd meet, I know not; for such has been Captain Ironsides' resentment on my account, that he has declared war against the very name of Belfield; and, in one of his whimsical passions, you know, insisted on my laying it aside for ever; so that hitherto▪ I have been known on board by no other name, than that of Lewson.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, Sir; and I think 'twill be adviseable to con∣tinue the disguise, as long as you can. As for the old captain, from the life he always leads on shore, and his impatience to get on board again▪ I think 'tis very possible
<PB N="5" REF="12" MS="y"/>
an interview between him and your brother may be pre∣vented.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so too. Go then, Francis, and conduct the old gentleman hither; I see Violetta coming.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Francis.</STAGE>
<P>Sure there is something in that woman's story uncom∣monly mysterious—Of English parents—born in Lisbon▪—her family and fortune buried in the earthquake—so much she freely tells; but more I am convinc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d remains untold, and of a melancholy sort: she has once or twice, as I thought, seem'd dispos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to unbosom herself to me; but it is so painful to be told of sorrows one hasn't power to relieve, that I have hitherto avoided the discourse.</P>

<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Madam, melancholy still? stil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that face of sorrow and despair? twice shipwreck<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and twice rescued from the jaws of death, do you regret your preservation▪ and have I incur'd your displeasure by prolonging your ex∣istence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VIOLETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so, Mr. Lew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on; such ingratitude be far from me▪ can I forget when the vessel, in which I had sail'd from Portugal, founder'd by your side, with what noble, what benevolent ardour you flew to my assistance? regardful only of my safety, your own seem'd no part of your care.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no more of this; the preservation of a fellow-creature is as natural as self-defence: you now, for the first time in your life, breathe the air of England—a rough reception it has given you; but be not, therefore, dis∣courag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; our hearts, Violetta, are more accessible than our shores; nor can you find inhospitality in Britain, save in our climate only.</P>

<P>These characteristicks of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nglish may be just; I take my estimate from a less favo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rable example.</P>

<P>Villany, Madam, is the growth of every soil; nor can I, while yonder habitation is in my view, forget that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng∣land has given birth to monsters that disgrace humanity; but this I will say for my countrymen, that, where you can point-out one rascal with a heart to wrong you, I will produce fifty honest fellows ready and resolute to redress you.</P>

<P>Intimately; it has been the cradle of my infancy, and, with little interruption, my residence ever since.</P>

<P>My friends, Violetta!—must I confess it to you, I have no friends—those rocks, that have thus scatter'd my treasures, those waves, that have devoured them, to me are not so fatal, as hath been that man, whom Nature meant to be my nearest friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VIOLETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and are you a fellow-sufferer then? is this the way you reconcile me to your nation? are these the friends of humankind? why don't we fly from this un∣generous, this ungrateful country?</P>

<P>Hold, Madam; one villain, however base, can no more involve a whole nation in his crimes, than one example, however dignisied, can inspire it with his virtues: thank Heaven, the worthless owner of that mansion is yet with∣out a rival.</P>

<P>For the very reason you state in your question; because

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your questions, Miss Lucy, begin to be impertinent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, do they touch you, Sir? but I'll waste no more time with you; my business is with your Sophia; here, in the very spot which you hope to make the scene of your guilty triumphs, will I expose you to her; set-forth your inhuman conduct to your unhappy brother; and de∣tect the mean artifices you have been driven to, in order to displace him in her affections.</P>

<P>Stay, Lucy, understand yourself a little better; did'nt you pretend to Sophia, that my brother paid his addresses to you; that he had pledg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d himself to marry you; nay, that he had—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Mr. Belfield, nor further explain a transaction, which, though it reflects shame enough upon me that was your instrument, ought to cover you, who was prin∣cipal in the crime, with treble confusion and remorse.</P>

<P>What melancholy, Mr. Belfield? so near your hap∣piness, and so full of thought?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happiness, what's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATERSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you, Sir; the possession of a lovely girl, with fifty thousand pounds in her lap, and twice fifty thousand virtues in her mind; this I call happiness, as much as mortal man can merit: and this, as I take it, you are destin'd to enjoy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not so certain, Mr. Paterson; wou'd you be∣lieve it, that perverse hussey, Lucy Waters, who left me but this minute, threatens to transverse all my hopes, and is gone this instant to Sophia with that resolution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATERSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! how is Miss Waters provided or provoked to do this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why 'tis a foolish story, and scarce worth relating to you; but you know, when your letters called me home from Portugal, I found my younger brother in close at∣tendance on Miss Dove; and, indeed, such good use had the fellow made of his time in my absence, that I found it impossible to counterwork his operations by fair and open
<PB N="16" REF="23" MS="y"/>
approaches; so, to make short of the story, I took this girl Lucy Waters into partnership; and, by a happy device, ruined him with Sophia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATERSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Mr. Belfield, I neither know, nor wish to know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it pass then; defeated in these views, my brother, as you know, betook himself to the desperate course of privateering, with that old tar-barrel, my uncle: what may have been his fate, I know not, but I have found it convenient to propagate a report of his death.</P>

<SPEAKER>PATERSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it, Mr. Belfield; I wish nothing was convenient, that can be thought dishonourable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELEIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nature, Mr. Paterson, never put into any human composition more candour and credulity, than she did into mine; but acquaintance with life has shewn me how im∣practicable these principles are; to live with mankind, we must live like mankind; was it a world of honesty, I should blush to be a man of art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATERSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you dream of ever reaching your journey's end by such crooked paths as these are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, my most sage moralist, wonderful as it may seem to thee, true it is, notwithstanding, that after having threaded all these by-ways, and crooked all<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, which thy right-lin'd apprehension knows nothing of; after having driven my rival from the field, and being almost in pos∣session of the spoil, still I feel a repugnance in me that all most tempts me to renounce my good fortune, and aban∣don a victory I have struggled so hard to obtain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATERSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guess'd as much; 'tis your Violetta; 'tis your fair Portuguese that counterworks your good fortune; and I must own to you, it was principally to save you from that improvident attachment, that I wrote so pressingly for your return; but though I have got your body in safe holding, your heart is still at Lisbon; and if you marry Miss Dove, 'tis because Violetta's fortune was demolished

<P>There are some insults, Sir Benjamin, that no man of spirit ought to put up with; and the imputation of being made a wittol of, is the most unpardonable of any.</P>

<P>No, Philip, no, I am innocent; and, therefore, per∣secuted by the most criminal of men: I have disclosed all Mr. Belfield's artifices to Miss Sophia, and now am ter∣rified to death; I saw him follow me out of the Park, as I was coming hither, and I dare not return home alone; indeed, Philip, I dare not.</P>

<P>Upon my word I am young Mr. Belfield's most obse∣quious servant: a very notable confusion truly has he been pleased to make in my family. Lady Dove raves, Sophia cries; my wife calls him a saucy impudent fellow, my daughter says he's a base▪ treacherous wretch; from all which I am to conclude, that he has spoke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too plain truths to the one, and told too many lies to the other: one lady is irritated because he has refus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d favours; the other, perhaps, is afflicted because he has obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d 'em. Lady Dove has peremptorily insisted upon my giving him a challenge; but, to say the truth, I had no great sto∣mach to the business, till this fresh provocation: I per∣ceive now I am growing into a most unaccountable rage; 'tis something so different from what I ever felt before,
<PB N="50" REF="57" MS="y"/>
that, for what I know, it may be courage and I mistake it for anger; I never did quarrel with any man, and hitherto no man ever quarrel'd with me: egad, if once I break the ice, it shan't stop here: if young Belfield doesn't prove me a coward, lady Dove shall see that I am a man of spirit.—Sure I see my gentleman coming hither again.</P>

<P>Indeed, Sir, I can't easily guess how I can possibly be a party in any business between Miss Dove and Mr. Bel∣field. I thought all intercourse between those persons was now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntirely at an end.</P>

<P>How, Sir! not at an end?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, Madam; on the contrary, from Sir Benjamin's great anxiety for the match, and, above all, from the very seasonable intelligence you w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s so good to as commu∣nicate to Miss Sophia, I am not without hopes that Mr. Andrew Belfield will be happy enough to conquer all her scruples, and engage her consent to marry him.</P>

<SPEAKER>VIOLETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! but▪ pray, Sir, those scruples of Miss Dove's, which you flatter yourself Mr. Belfield will so happily conquer, how is it that ladies in this country reconcile

<SPEAKER>PATERSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be sure, Madam, Miss Dove has had some doubts and difficulties to contend with; but duty you know—and, as I said before, you, Madam, you have been a great friend to Mr. Belfield; you have forwarded matters surprisingly.</P>

<P>Well, and is not Mr. Belfield a man? a fine man, as I take it, he is, and a fine estate I'm sure he has got; then it lies so handy and contiguous to my own; only a hedge betwixt us; think of that, Sophy, only a hedge that parts his manor from mine; then consider, likewise, how this alliance will accommodate matters in the borough of Knavestown, where I and my family have stood three contested elections with his, and lost two of them; that sport will now be at an end, and our interests will be consolidated by this match, as well as our estates.</P>

<P>Sir Benjamin, I come now to claim your promise of one hour's conversation with your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil you do!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>To you, Sir, obligations of this sort may be matter of ridicule; but while I religiously observe all promises I make to others, I shall expect others to be as observant of those they make to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have a most profound veneration for your prin∣ciples, and am happy to find your understanding so much cultivated by travel; but in spite of your address, you will find it rather difficult to induce me to wave my right in Miss Dove in favour of a profest adventurer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shameless, unfeeling man! an adventurer do you call me? You, whose unbrotherly persecution drove me to this hazardous, this humiliating occupation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IRONSIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sirrah! Bob! no reflections upon privateering; it has lin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d your pockets well, you young rogue; and you may tell your fine brother there that we have landed treasure enough upon his estate to buy the fee-simple of it; ay, and for what I know, of Sir Wiseacre's here into the bargain.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that you say, Captain Ironsides? Let's have a word in a corner with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look'e, Sir, if you conceive yourself wrong'd by me, there is but one way—You know your remedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know your meaning, brother; and to demonstrate how much greater my courage is than yours, I must confe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to you I dare not accept your proposal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I've given him enough of that I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IRONSIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bob Belfield, if I did not know thee for a lad of mettle, I shou'dn't tell what to make of all this: for my own part, I understand none of your scruples and refinements, not I; a man is a man; and if I take care to give an af∣front to no man, I think, I have a right to take an affront from no man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, gentlemen, suspend your dispute; here comes my daughter, let her decide betwixt you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me receive my sentence from her lips, and I will submit to it.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SOPHIA, PATERSON, <HI>and</HI> LADY DOVE.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a young gentleman, daughter, that will take no denial; he comes to forbid the ban<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s just when you are both going into the church to be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word this is something extraordinary. What are the gentleman's reasons for this behaviour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He claims a sort of promise from me that he shou'd be indulg'd in an hour's conversation with you, before you give your hand to his brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>An hour's conversation! What little that gentleman can have to say to me I believe may be said in a very few minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="76" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, brother, this conversation don't promise a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place then I own to this gentleman and the company present, that there was a time, when I enter∣tain'd the highest opinion of his merit. Nay, I will not scruple to confess that I had conceiv'd a regard for him of the tenderest sort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IRONSIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, young lady, how came my nephew to for∣feit your good opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a conduct, Sir, that must for ever forfeit not my esteem only, but yours and all mankind's: I am sorry to be his accuser, but I will appeal to you, Mr. Belfield, who are his brother, whether it is reconcil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able either to honour or humanity to prosecute an affair of marriage with one woman, when you are previously and indispen∣sibly engaged to another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph▪</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet this, Sir, is the treatment I have receiv'd: judge, therefore, if I can desire or consent to have any long con∣versation with a gentleman who is under such engage∣ments▪ nay, whom I can prove actually married to another woman in this very house, and ready to vouch the truth of what I assert. Judge for me, Mr. Belfield; cou'd you believe any man capable of such complicated, such inconceivable villa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven's! This touches me too closely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I wou'd fain know what excuse you can have for this behaviour; I can tell you, Sir, I don't understand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! fie! fie upon you, Mr. Belfield! I wonder you are not asham<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to show your face in this family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR BENJAMIN DOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who desired you to put in your oar?</P>
</SP>

<PB N="70" REF="77" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>IRONSIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sirrah, wou'd not one wife content you? 'tis enough in all reason for one man; is it not, Sir Benjamin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, when it is prov'd I am married, accuse me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IRONSIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look'e Bob, I don't accuse you for marrying, 'twas an indiscretion and I can forgive it; but to deny it▪ is a meanness, and I abhor it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Belfield, do you say nothing upon this occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD SENIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Paterson, I am str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck to the heart; I cannot support my guilt▪ I am married to Violetta; save me the confusion of relating it; this dishonourable engagement for ever I renounce, nor will I rest till I have made atonement to an injur'd wife. Madam, I beg leave to withdraw for a few minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Sir, this contrivance is of your forging; you have touch'd me too near; and now, if you dare draw your sword, follow me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, gentlemen, you forget the lady is now in the house; she is a witness, that will effectually put an end to your dispute: I will conduct her hither.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFIELD JUNIOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IRONSIDES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark'e nephew, I shrewdly suspect you have been laying a train to blow yourself up: if once Bob comes fairly alongside of you, you'll find your quarters too hot to hold you: I never yet found my boy out in a lye, and shan't tamely see a l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e impos'd upon him; for, while he is honest and I have breath, he shall never want a friend to stand by him▪ or a father to protect him.</P>
</SP>
