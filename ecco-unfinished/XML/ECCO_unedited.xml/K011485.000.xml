<HEAD>THE Livery Man`s Reasons Why he did not give his Vote for a Certain Gentleman either to be Lord Mayor, or Parliament Man for the City of <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' it might be more proper to enquire of fome People, why they should over∣look so many worthy Gentlemen, who in Course stood nearer the Chair, and give their Voices for a Gentleman to be Lord Mayor, yet because all Men are not bound to give a Rea∣son for what they do, and some Men can't, I have chose the other side, as that which will most rea∣dily Explain the Matter; and shall consider some of their Reasons afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
But to make way to the Enquiry we are upon, 'twill be needful to enter a little into the History of the present Dispute, and to see how it came to pass that He has been the Subject of so much Debate.</P>
<P>This worthy Gentleman had the misfortune to fall under the formidable Displeasure of the House of Commons, and to be Committed to the Tower, and Expell'd the House, for what Offences I shall not now Examin.</P>
<P>Nor shall I tire my Reader with leading him in∣to the Particulars of the Parliaments proceeding a∣gainst him which is so fresh in every one's Memo¦ry, tho' he who is a Stranger to it, may easily be sup∣posed to be no Reader of News, and therefore not likely to see the Contents of this Book.</P>
<P>At the recess of Parliament, his Enlargement was of course, but being out of Favour at Court, he seem`d to retire himself from Business when some People in the City Resolv'd to name him for one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Some say, He made his Court to the Citizens to do him this Honour a little to recover his Re∣putation, which the Parliament's Resentment had given a shock too.</P>
<P>Others tell us, The Citizens according to an old Custom, being a Fishing for Sheriffs or for Money, rather pitcht upon him, riot as a Man they desir'd shou`d serve, but as a Rich Man who would fine ra∣ther than hold, and so they shou`d get Money by him.</P>
<P>I cannot help making this Remark by the way, that I know nothing the Citizens have, to plead for that Custom but the Antiquity of it, which is but a small Reputation; and no way discovers the Honesty of the Practice.</P>
<P>Those who are of this Opinion tell us, That had not the City unhappily pitcht upon another Over∣grown Citizen to match him, they had got the Mo∣ney and lost the Sheriff, which was the Thing intend∣ed; but choosing two such Men together, as the whole City cou'd not produce the like for Estate, was the Reason that both held, and the City lose 800 by the Disappointment.</P>
<P>Whether either of these Conjectures be right, I do
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
not determine, but this is certain, That he was elected Sheriff of <HI>London,</HI> serv'd with a great deal of Splendour, did the City or <HI>Himself rather</HI> a great deal of Honour, spent abundance of Money, and by a great many Acts of Bounty and Charity became very popular.</P>
<P>The common Voice eccho'd his Praises, for com∣mon Voices beggar-like always prays for the Hand that gives the Farthing; and the Knight pleas`d with the <HI>Ignis fatuus</HI> of Fortune, fancied to himself she had made him amends for the scurvy Kick he had receiv'd from her before, and fell into the Snare.</P>
<P>His Vanity flattered him to believe, that in this <HI>Crisis</HI> nothing wou'd be deny`d him if he did but push his good Fortune, and therefore like One, that not use to slip a favourable Opportunity; he resolv`d to make use of the Advantage, and seem`d rather to accept of the Honour which the Citizens gave him than to want it! and there is no doubt but he wou'd have shown the City the Sence he had of their Civility in a splendid manner, as a Thing which wou'd serve both to requite them, and at the same time, maintain the Reputation of his Generosity, and so answer two Ends together.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
While the Warmth of the People`s Opinion conti∣nued, came on the Election for Lord Mayor, and tho' his Office of Sheriff was not expir'd, he nominated by his Friends, which was a Case almost without a Pre∣cedent; but such was the Reputation of his Charity and Estate, such the Power of his Bounty and Libe∣ral Way of Living, and such the Expectation of great Things to be done for the City, that he carried it in the Common-Hall by a Visible Majority, and in the Poll by above 500 Voices.</P>
<P>But an unhappy and unexpected Circumstance in the Custom of the City ruin`d his Expectation, for the Common-Hall of the City, that is, the Voices of the Livery-men, are to choose two Persons to be pre∣sented to the Court of Aldermen, out of which the Court of Aldermen were obliged to return one for Lord Mayor, but may return which of the Two they or a Majority of them shall choose.</P>
<P>Now tho' they are absolutely free to choose which of the Two they please, yet it has been a received Practice and Custom in that Court, always to return the Eldest Alderman; and it has been but very rarely, that they have broke in upon that Custom, and never without some Extraordinary Cause.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
In this case there appear'd no very Extraordi∣nary Occasion, and Sir <HI>C</HI>—having been chosen Alderman of the <HI>Bridge-Ward</HI> but a few Weeks before, the Court of Aldermen therefore thought fit to return Sir <HI>Thomas Abney</HI> Lord Mayor, as the Se∣nior Alderman.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>C</HI>—did not appear so much concern'd at the Repulse, as his Friends were who had used all their Interest for his Election, and were exceedingly mov'd at the Proceedings tho' not able to remedy it.</P>
<P>But to make themselves amends, and try their Strength again, they put him upon appearing as a Candidate for the City, to serve them in the Ensuing Parliament.</P>
<P>And I must do Sir <HI>C</HI>—this Justice, that his standing for Parliament Man in the City, does not seem so much his own Act and Deed, from a De∣sire to be a Member of Parliament, as it is the Act and Deed of a Party, who set him up to try the Power of their Interest in the City, and to strengthen it with his.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>C</HI>—was already chosen for the Town of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> and sure of sitting in the House, and never given himself the Trouble, nor run the Risque of the Slur he has since received, had he not been desir'd
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
to head a Party who claim'd so much of him, as he had been serv'd by them before in the Elect<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on for Lord Mayor.</P>
<P>And this as it seems to be the Original of his appear∣ing, leads us into the Reasons which others had to Oppose him.</P>
<P>And that we may prepare the World, to know that we have very good Reasons for what we have done, we are first to declare, That as this Book is not design'd for an Invective against that worthy Gentleman, so it is not any Reason drawn from his Personal Conduct, which has biast our judgment in the Case, but from a substantial regard to the Ho∣nour and Safety of the City, and of the Nation.</P>
<P>If therefore the following Particulars are real Matters of Fact, we hope they may be alledged as good and justifiable Causes, why we have given our Votes against this Generous Gentleman in both these particular Errours.</P>
<P>We know as <HI>English</HI> Men, Free-men of <HI>London,</HI> and Livery-men; we have an unaccounted Right of Voting, as our Fancy or Judgment guides us, with∣out being accountable so much as to our selves. But
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
since every Wise Man is able to give a Reason for what he does; and that we may appear Rational Creatures; and thereby distinguish our selves from some of our Fellow-Citizens, we shall consider some Circumstances in the Case, which if they ap∣pear True in Fact, may pass for sufficient Reasons in the Case.</P>
<Q><L>And First for our opposing him as Lord Mayor.</L></Q>
<P>We presume every Citizen will grant that your Office of Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> which in many Ca∣ses, is the highest Post of Civil Power a Subject is capable of; ought to be Executed by such Persons only, who are more than ordinarily qualified for a Trust of such Consequence. The Government of this Populous wealthy City, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is certainly a thing of such Consequence to the Safety and Peace of this City, and of so much Honour to the Person Entrust∣ed with it; that it is not a slight Affair, but every Ci∣tizen is concern'd to see, according to his proportion of Concern in the Case, that it be committed to a Person of Honesty and Merit.</P>
<P>Now tho' we shall be very Chary in making Re∣flections on the Person we are speaking of, yet while the Supream Expositors of our Laws and Accounts;
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
the Parliament had by Unanimous suffrage, Voted him Guilty of such a Crime, as they thought suffici∣ent to Expel him their House; we think that alone might pass for a sufficient Reason, why we did not give our Consent to make him our Chief Magi∣strate.</P>
<P>To expel men from the Society of a Party or Bo∣dy of People, is the highest executive part of Pow∣er any Body of People have; all Punishment be∣sides, are inferior to it.</P>
<P>Death inflicted on a Capital Malefactor is fully express'd thus, That such a one having committed a detestable and execrable Crime, as Murther or Treason is; Put to Death, that is, expell'd the World as unfit for Humane Society; and all Fines, Imprisonments, Brandings and Whippings, and Pil∣lories are counted higher Punishments, which the Offender receives from the mercy of a Court, to ex∣cuse him from the greater Punishment of Death: And therefore of Old, when an Offender was burnt in the Hand, 'twas a Custom to make him kneel down and pray God to bless the King, as an acknow∣ledgment of his Majesty's Mercy, in dismissing him with so light a Punishment, where a greater was deserved.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
'Tis the like in common Society, the highest Re∣sentment one Man can Legally express at another, is to say, he will have no more to do with him, or he will not come into his Company; all farther Resentments, as ill Language, Quarrellings, and Blows, are Extravagant and Illegal.</P>
<P>'Tis the like in Sacred Power, where Excommu∣nication is the severest Censure; and is exprest by casting out a Person from the Society of Christians.</P>
<P>If then a Parliament of <HI>England</HI> thinks fit, to expel any Member from their Society for a personal Crime, the English of it seems to be this; That he has been guilty of such a Crime, as they think, deserves their highest Resentment as a House, and that they judge him unworthy to be in their Company, or to repre∣sent any part of the People of <HI>England;</HI> and `twas alluded to: Thus, by the Speaker of the House of Commons, in the Case of Sir <HI>Robert Payton</HI> in the late Times, when he told Sir <HI>Robert, the House spu∣ed him out;</HI> one expressing thereby, that as in the Body Natural, when the Stomach is overcharg'd with any thing offensive, Nature disgorges it self by a violent re-percussion, and casts up what it can∣not digest; so in the Body Pollitick, when a Cri∣minal
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
is found in the Legislative Society, the Go∣vernment feels a Convulsion, and cannot be easie till it has discharg'd it self of the Load.</P>
<P>'Tis true, we have had very Honourable Per∣sons expell'd the House upon qualifying Niceties without Crimes, but that does not at all reach the Case.</P>
<P>As to the Crime for which this Gentleman was thus severely handled; we have nothing to do with it here, nor does the Parliament need any Advocates, to defend the justice of their Proceedings: Any man may presume, the House had Reason for what they did, without running the hazard of a Reflection on his Faith for being too Implicite.</P>
<P>Since then this Gentleman lay under the Misfor∣tune aforesaid, we think it may be allow'd as a ve∣ry good Reason, why we did not think him proper∣ly qualified for our Chief Magistrate.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> is an Office of very great Concern, Life and Death, Justice and Equity, Right and Wrong, Peace and Prosperity are in his Hands; and therefore we think, he who is recom∣mended to that Place, ought to be a Person of an Un∣blemisht
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Life, and, if possible, of an unspotted Reputation.</P>
<P>To have placed a Person to represent the King, whom the Parliament thought unworthy to repre∣sent the People, seems but a very mean Compli∣ment to his Majesty; to have chosen a person voted a Criminal by the whole Representatives of the Ci∣ty, as well as Kingdom, to preside in doing Ju∣stice upon Criminals; seem'd a most preposterous contradiction.</P>
<P>In the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> every Livery-man of <HI>London</HI> is supposed actually sitting by our Repre∣sentatives; if so, then the Livery-men of <HI>London</HI> having first Voted him Guilty of such a Crime, for which they thought fit to expel him the House, and afterwards the same Livery-men set him up in the Chair of Government, to Rule those people he was not worthy to represent, was so contradictory to common Sense, that we cannot satisfie our selves to act upon such manifest Absurdities, especi∣ally in Matters of such Consequence.</P>
<P>We are content to wave the Objection against the Morals of the Gentleman concern'd, because we shall avoid personal Reflections, and leave his
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
way of living to himself, and him to whom he must account for it only: 'Tis confest on the other hand, That the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> being a person, who must have a great hand in Resormation of Manners, if ever any thing to purpose be done in it, the success of it would be very precarious if he shou'd be a man of Vice himself; and were we sure of his Life being scandalous that way, 'twou'd be a very justifiable Reason to reject him as a Ma∣gistrate, but we leave that to those who know him better than we do, to determine.</P>
<P>Secondly,</P>
<P>As Lord Mayor, we did not conceive him put upon us so fairly as we think he ought to be, and that on several Accounts.</P>
<P>When the Design of setting him up for Lord Mayor, was form'd he was not an Alderman, nor was there any extraordinary prospect of making him so, till a new fashion'd way, <HI>we cannot call it Bri∣bery,</HI> of gaining Suffrages was entred upon by which the Ward was brought about, like the King of <HI>Po∣land</HI>'s Election contrary to expectation; by which we may understand, what strange influence a good pair of Organs have on a Congregation, tho they were but reserv'd in <HI>Petto;</HI> neither as the <HI>Pope</HI> does
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
by the Cardinals, to preserve their Dependance on him.</P>
<P>Any one might see what time of day 'twas by such a Dyal; no sooner was he made an Alder∣man, but that making an Interest for him to be Lord Mayor succeeded. Now to us it seem'd Rational, that whereas it was an extraordinary thing, and un∣known within the Memory of Man, to put up a Man to be Mayor that had not finished the Office of She∣riff; was not only the Junior Alderman, but so young as but of a few Weeks standing, and so many worthy Gentlemen before him who stood nearer the Chair, and were unexceptionable in their Reputation; we say, it seem'd very rational, that since this was such an extraordinary Case, some very extraordinary Reason should be given for it.</P>
<P>Now all the Reason we could ever yet meet with for it, besides the Will of the Parties was, That their Gentleman was extraordinary Rich, and if the City did him such an Honour, he wou'd certainly do some great Thing for them, and e∣recting Statues, and Building Pallaces for the Re∣sidence of the Lord Mayor, were the least things they talk'd of.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
These Things seem'd so far from being Reasons to us, that really in themselves the are Reasons why any Body that values the Honour of the City shou'd not have chosen him. For if Publick Buildings and costly Statues, are proper Conditions to engage the City to make Magistrates, then we must suppose the City of <HI>London</HI> very Needy and Mercenary too: We neither see so much Benefit by, nor so much need of any such Publick Acts, as to dispose of the Government of the City on such Conditions.</P>
<P>We do not say, the Gentleman we are speaking of, proposed these Things as Conditions of his Ele∣ction, but his Friends and Party talk'd them about, and made use of them as Arguments, to prevail on People to Poll for him.</P>
<P>It has always been the Usage of such People, who have attempted to oblige the City, to exert their Acts of Merit first, as the most Generous Ap∣peal to the City to judge of them by: But to have the City begin to heap her Favours upon a Person first, in Expectation of his Bounty afterwards by way of Gratitude, is turning the Tables upon the City, and giving her the wrong End of the Staff.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
We are therefore, hitherto destitute of those ex∣traordinary Reasons, which shou'd prevail upon us to put Matters out of Course, and to break into the Customs and Ancient Usage of the City, and 'till those Extraordinaries do appear, we think our Old Custom and Usage a sufficient Reason, to move us to go on in course,</P>
<P>A Third Reason in this case, is the Number of Worthy Gentlemen unexceptionable in their Persons, sufficient in their Estates, untainted in their Morals, unblemish'd in their Reputation who stood nearer the Chair as we say; that is, who were Senior Aldermen, and had serv'd as Sheriffs long before him.</P>
<P>Now tho' we know, that it is in our Right to pass over the Heads of any Person, and choose Who and Where we please; yet since laying a Gentleman aside, and taking another in his room, when ac∣cording to the Ancient Custom of the City he might reasonably expect it, seems to imply something de∣fective in, or some Dislike of that Gentleman, and is a Point every Man should be very tender in. We therefore, cou'd not be satisfied to put such a slight upon those Worthy Gentlemen, without be∣ing able to assign some cause, why they should
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
not be thought Worthy to serve the City accord∣ing to Expectation.</P>
<P><HI>We come next to our</HI> Reasons, against our Electing him for Member of Parliament.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> It might pass for a Reason sufficient against all the World, that he having been ad∣judged Criminal by the last Parliament as is be∣fore mention'd, it looks like flying in the Face of the Nation and Parliament, to elect such a One to represent the Capital City of the Kingdom, who was by the last Parliament expell'd the House, and deem'd unworthy to represent a small <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Village.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor have we any Extraordinary Demonstra∣tion of his being a Person, fitly qualified to repre∣sent this Loyal Protestant City by being a Hearty Friend, to the present Establisht Government; we do not say, he is disaffected to the Government, and desire to be understood right, but there's an Old <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence which is generally true.</P>
<Q><L>Noscitur ex Socio qui non dignoscitur ex se.</L></Q>
<P>And we see that all the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, who are
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
profest Enemies to the Government, adhere to him, Vote for him and Muster up all their Friends to do the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame.</P>
<P>Now as when a Prince or State strengthen them∣selves with Alliances, makes Leagues Offensive and Defensive, raises Soldiers, fits out Fleet, or makes any Warlike Preparations, it fills the Neighbouring Princes with Jealousies of their Designs; so when a Gentleman makes his Court to a Party, which we know, wish the present Constitution no good, and when we see them assist him with all the Di∣ligence possible: This may be allow'd to be sufficient Ground of Suspition, that they are all in one Intrest.</P>
<P>We conceive there is no one Thing, in which we ought to be more Nice, than in the choice of Per∣sons to represent us in Parliament; for we put our Estates, or Liberties, Religion, Families, King, Crown and Nation into their Hands; and no Man ought to sit in that House for us, who is the least to be suspected of Partiality to a Party; or that has any Interest to manage there, but what is for the Good and Prosperity of his Native Countries and the Protestant Religion.</P>
<P>And if this Gentleman were the best Friend to the
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Government that could be, yet if 'tis his misfortune to be suspected from the Company he keeps with, and assistance he accepts from the Nations Ene∣mies, 'tis his own fault that he does not more pub∣lickly discountenance and discourage that Party, which does his Character so much Injury.</P>
<P>It is not enough at this juncture that we avoid Electing such as are Profest Enemies, and who publickly appear to be so; there is less dan∣ger in a Profest than in a private Enemy; but we are to take care to elect Men more than or∣dinary remarkable for their Zeal to the present Establishment; Patriots for their Country, and Champions against Popery and Tyranny, if such are to be found.</P>
<P>His Majesty has told us, He is to advise with his Parliament about Matters of the highest Im∣portance to this Kingdom; which is in it self a tacit Caution to us, to choose such for our Representa∣tives, who are the King and the Nations Friends, and qualified to be their Advisers, and to have any Man but suspected of the contrary, to see him so∣ciate
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
with, and be backt and upheld by a con∣trary Party, is sufficient to give us so much Um∣brage in the Case, as to be very sly of commit∣ting so great a Trust to his Conduct.</P>
<P>But were this no Reason at all, we conceive we are justifiable in opposing this Gentleman's Election on this account, That the Election for the City of <HI>London,</HI> had more of Design in it than reality; there was a Project in it, a Tale at the end of it; a Snake in the Grass, which every one did not foresee.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Tis apparent, the End was not barely to have that Gentleman be a Parliament Man, <SUP>1</SUP> for he was already secure of that at <HI>Ipswitch,</HI> and could have had it in another Place if he had mis∣sed it there.</P>
<P>But the Design was to divide the City, and try the strength of a Party in order to carry on fur∣ther Affairs, possibly to make way for a future E∣lection to the Mayoralty, and partly in favour of
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
a party lately too much made the Subject of De∣bate between the <HI>Two Rival Companies,</HI> and a∣bove all, 'tis plain 'twas pusht at to keep out those Honest Gentlemen, who have so honourably ac∣quitted themselves in that Trust already.</P>
<P>Now had there been no other Reasons than this, that his standing as a Candidate for the Ci∣ty, was to carry on the Interest of a party, and thereby divide the City which is always the oc∣casions of Heats and Feuds among us; this were enough to justifie our opposing him.</P>
<P>No Body could have blam'd him to have used his utmost Intrest, and that of his Friends too, in or∣der to be Chosen a Representative for the City; had he had no Design but to sit in the House.</P>
<P>But to stand for the City when he was already Elected in another place, must imply one of these Consequences.</P>
<P>Either that it was done to gratifie his own Am∣bition
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
in being Chosen for the Capital City of the Kingdom, and to Tell the House that their ex∣pelling him, had not at all weaken'd his Reputa∣tion, but rather encreased it.</P>
<P>Or it must be done to uphold a Party who stood in need of his New begotten Interest to up∣hold theirs, who again in their turn would uphold his on the like occasion.</P>
<P>Now be it for which of these two Reasons it will, both of them signifie to us, that his standing in the City was not upon a right Foundation, and ac∣cordingly we have let him know that we shall neither Vote for him nor any Man else, whose Designn is rather to foment and support a Party, than really to serve the City.</P>
<P>'Tis a time of Day when Union and Peace with one another, is more than usually neces∣sary, the Conjunction of formidable Powers broad, and the Encrease of ill-natur'd People at home, gives us but a melancholly Prospect of
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Affairs; our peace seems to be but short-liv`d a∣broad, our Trade in danger; if a War follows again, our King will be in danger; and he must be very short sighted, who does not perceive the Protestant Religion is in danger, and if ever Union was necessary, 'tis now; and in order to it, we think 'tis every man's Interest to oppose them, that foment Parties and Divisions amongst us.</P>
<P>As for the Reasons on the other hand, all we can yet hear of, why this Gentleman was thus hastily set up, over the Heads of so many emi∣nent Citizens, are these;</P>
<P>First,</P>
<P>He was vastly Rich, and the City stood in need of an extraordinary Man that way.</P>
<P>Secondly,</P>
<P>He was in the Humour of spending his Mony in order to become popular, and they were for ta∣king him by the right handle, and make the best of him.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>
As to the Want the City has of Opulent Men, who are able to do a great many fine Things for them; tho' much might be said to it, I'll let it pass for a Reason, only making this Remark upon it; The City has always need of Good Ma∣gistrates, qualified to promote Justice, preserve Peace, and encourage Good Manners, to suppress Vice and Prophaneness; and he that is not thus qualified be he never so Wealthy, Charitable or Magnificent, is not the Man the City has an Oc∣casion for.</P>
<P>As to Taking the Advantage of the Liberality of this Gentleman, and to gratifie him that he may spend his Money amongst us.</P>
<P>This is swallowing the Bait laid on purpose, whoever thinks he is so lavish of his Cash, only from a meer Principle of Generosity without any Design; must be very ignorant of the History of this Gentleman, and know very little either of him or the World.</P>
<P>And if he has other Designs, 'Tis proper they shou'd be known too, before we own our selves so exceedingly oblig'd to his Munificence.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
If he has a sullied Reputation to raise, if he has a Figure to make, in Order to make him formidable to some People; if he has need of a good Name, in Order to set him right either at Court, in Parliament, or elsewhere; if he has his Natural Ambition to gratifie, if he has an abdicated Party, or an Old <HI>East India</HI> Company to encourage, or if he has any Se∣parate or Private Interest to uphold and carry on; he has took exact Measures by Publick Charities and Generous Behaviour, to get on the blind side of the City: But still, Gentlemen, you are oblig'd to the De∣sign not the Man, and I know no Body will be ob∣lig'd to your Ignorance, if you gratifie him in it.</P>
<P>For our Parts we think, without any Disrespect to his Person, his setting himself up as the Head of a Par∣ty, by which Heats, Feuds, Ill natur'd Divisions and Distractions have been so much reviv'd among us, at a Time when Peace and Unanimity is so absolutely necessary to our Happiness, wou'd be sufficient Rea∣son to engage any Rational Man against him, that is sensible of the True Interest of <HI>England</HI> in general, and of this City in particular.</P>
<P>And that he did do so is evident, for that he was actually chosen a Member of the House, before the Election for the City came on.</P>
