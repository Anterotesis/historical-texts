<HEAD>ARGUMENT
Introductory to the
OPERA of SEMELE.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Amour with <HI>Europa,</HI> the Daughter
of <HI>Agenor,</HI> King of <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> he again incenses
<HI>Juno</HI> by a new Affair in the same Family; <HI>viz.</HI>
with <HI>Semele,</HI> Niece to <HI>Europa,</HI> and Daughter to <HI>Cadmus</HI>
King of <HI>Thebes. Semele</HI> is on the Point of Marriage with
<HI>Athamas;</HI> which Marriage is about to be solemniz'd in the
Temple of <HI>Juno,</HI> Goddess of Marriages, when <HI>Jupiter</HI> by
ill Omens interrupts the Ceremony; and afterward tran∣sports
<HI>Semele</HI> to a private Abode prepar'd for her. <HI>Juno,</HI>
after many Contrivances, at length assumes the Shape and
Voice of <HI>Ino,</HI> Sister to <HI>Semele;</HI> by the Help of which Dis∣guise
and artful Insinuations, she prevails with her to make
a Request to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which being granted must end in her
utter Ruin.</P>
<P>This Fable is related in <HI>Ovid. Metam. L.</HI> 3. but there
<HI>Juno</HI> is said to impose on <HI>Semele</HI> in the Shape of an old
Woman, her Nurse. 'Tis hoped, the Liberty taken in sub∣stituting
<HI>Ino</HI> instead of the old Woman will be excus'd: It
was done, because <HI>Ino</HI> is interwoven in the Design by her
Love of <HI>Athamas;</HI> to whom she was marry'd, according
to <HI>Ovid;</HI> and, because her Character bears a Proportion
with the Dignity of the other Persons represented. This
Reason, it is presumed, may be allowed in a Thing intirely
fictitious; and more especially being represented under the
Title of an <HI>Opera,</HI> where greater Absurdities are every
Day excus'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="11"/>
It was not thought requisite to have any Regard either to
Rhyme or Equality of Measure, in the Lines of that Part
of the Dialogue which was design'd for the <HI>Recitative Style</HI>
in Music. For as that Style in Music is not confin'd to the
strict Observation of <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Measure,</HI> which is requir'd
in the Composition of <HI>Airs</HI> and <HI>Sonata's,</HI> so neither is it
necessary that the same Exactness in Numbers, Rhymes, or
Measure, should be observed in Words design'd to be set in
that Manner, which must ever be observed in the Formation
of <HI>Odes</HI> and <HI>Sonnets.</HI> For what they call <HI>Recitative</HI> in
Music, is only a more tuneable Speaking, it is a kind of Prose
in Music; its Beauty consists in coming near Nature, and in
improving the natural Accents of Words by more Pathetic
or Emphatical Tones.</P>

<L>By no one Measure bound, her Numbers range,</L>

<L>Her Songs to no distinguish'd Fame aspire,</L>

<L>In high <HI>Parnassus</HI> she no Birthright claims,</L>

<L>Yet near the sacred Mount she loves to rove,</L>
<L>Visits the Springs, and hovers round the Grove.</L>
<L>She knows what Dangers wait too bold a Flight,</L>
<L>And fears to fall from an <HI>Icarian</HI> Height:</L>

<L>At Distance follows, and its Track adores.</L>
<L>She knows what Room, what Force, the Swan requires,</L>
<L>Whose tow'ring Head above the Clouds aspires,</L>
<L>And knows as well, it is your lowest Praise,</L>

<L>(A Virtue lineal to your House and Blood:)</L>
<L>Yet think not meanly of your other Praise,</L>

<Q><HI>Hector's</HI> Body (after he was slain) remain'd still in the

<HEAD>The Eleventh Satire of JUVENAL.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>The Design of this Satire is to expose and reprehend all Man∣ner
of Intemperance and Debauchery; but more particu∣larly
that exorbitant Luxury used by the <HI>Romans,</HI> in
their Feasting. The Poet draws the Occasion from an
Invitation, which he here makes to his Friend, to dine
with him; very artfully preparing him, with what he
was to expect from his Treat, by beginning the Satire
with a particular Invective against the Vanity and
Folly of some Persons, who having but mean Fortunes in
the World, attempted to live up to the Height of Men of
great Estates and Quality. He shews us, the miserable
End of such Spend-thrifts and Gluttons; with the Man∣ner
and Courses, which they took to bring themselves to
it; advising Men to live within Bounds, and to propor∣tion
their Inclinations to the Extent of their Fortune. He
gives his Friend a Bill of Fare, of the Entertainment he
has provided for him; and from thence he takes Occasion
to reflect upon the Temperance and Frugality of the
greatest Men, in former Ages: To which he opposes the
Riot and Intemperance of the present; attributing to the
latter a visible Remssness, in the Care of Heaven over the
<HI>Roman</HI> State. He instances some lewd Practices at
Feasts, and by the bye, touches the Nobility, with making
Vice and Debauchery consist with their principal Pleasures.
<PB N="84" REF="82"/>
He concludes with a repeated Invitation to his Friend;
advising him (in one particular somewhat freely) to a

<L>BY this repeated Act of Grace, we see</L>
<L>Wit is again the Care of Majesty:</L>
<L>And while thus honour'd our proud Stage appears,</L>
<L>We seem to rival antient Theatres.</L>

<L>And thus the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Athenian</HI> Stage.</L>
<L>Whose Wit is best we'll not presume to tell:</L>

<L>So fair a Circle, and so bright a Queen.</L>
<L>Long has the Muses Land been over-cast,</L>
<L>And many rough and stormy Winters past;</L>
<L>Hid from the World, and thrown in Shades of Night,</L>
<L>Of Heat depriv'd, and almost void of Light:</L>
<L>While Wit, a hardy Plant, of Nature bold,</L>
<L>Has struggled strongly with the killing Cold:</L>
<L>So does it still through Opposition grow,</L>
<L>As if its Root was warmer kept by Snow:</L>
<L>But when shot forth, then draws the <HI>Danger</HI> near,</L>
<L>On ev'ry Side the gath'ring Winds appear,</L>
<L>And Blasts destroy that Fruit, which Frosts wou'd spare.</L>
<L>But now, new Vigour and new Life it knows,</L>
<L>And Warmth that from this royal Presence flows.</L>
<L>O wou'd she shine with Rays more frequent here!</L>
<L>How gay wou'd then, this drooping Land appear!</L>
<L>Then, like the Sun, with Pleasure she might view,</L>
<L>The smiling Earth, cloath'd by her Beams anew.</L>

A Comedy written by Mr. J. Dryden, Junior.</HEAD>
<L>THIS Year has been remarkable two Ways,</L>
<L>For blooming Poets, and for blasted Plays.</L>
<L>We've been by much appearing Plenty mock'd,</L>
<L>At once both tantaliz'd, and over-stock'd.</L>
<L>Our Authors too, by their Success of late,</L>
<L>Begin to think third Days are out of Date.</L>
<L>What can the Cause be that our Plays won't keep,</L>
<L>Unless they have a Rott some Years like Sheep?</L>
<L>For our Parts, we confess we're quite asham'd</L>
<L>To read such weekly Bills of Poets damn'd.</L>
<L>Each Parish knows 'tis but a mournful Case</L>
<L>When Christnings fall, and Funerals increase.</L>
<L>Thus 'tis, and thus will be when we are dead,</L>
<L>There will be Writers which will ne'er be read.</L>
<L>Why will you be such Wits, and write such Things?</L>
<L>You're willing to be Wasps, but want the Stings.</L>
<L>Let not your Spleen provoke you to that Height,</L>
<L>'Odslife you don't know what you do, Sirs, when yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Contriving Characters, and Scenes, and Plots,</L>
<L>Is grown as common now, as knitting Knots;</L>
<L>With the same Ease, and Negligence of Thought,</L>
<L>The charming Play is writ, and Fringe is wrought.</L>
<L>Tho' this be frightful yet we're more afraid,</L>
<L>When Ladies leave, that Beaux will take the Trade:</L>
<L>Thus far 'tis well enough, if here 'twou'd stop,</L>
<L>But should they write, we must e'en shut up Shop.</L>
<L>How shall we make this Mode of Writing sink?</L>
<L>A Mode, said I? 'Tis a Disease, I think,</L>
<L>A stubborn Tetter that's not cur'd with Ink.</L>
<L>For still it spreads, 'till each th' Infection takes,</L>
<L>And seizes ten, for one that it forsakes.</L>
<L>Our Play to-day is sprung from none of these,</L>
<L>Nor should you damn it, tho' it does not please,</L>
<L>Since born without the Bounds of your four Seas.</L>
<L>For if you grant no Favour as 'tis new,</L>

<L>Start not at <HI>Rome,</HI> for there's no Pop'ry meant;</L>

<L>Whose good, or ill-Success, on you depends.</L>
<L>Yet he has Hope some Kindness may be shown,</L>

<L>Nor is that all; so odd a Thing is Man,</L>

<L>Hence homely Faces still are foremost seen,</L>
<L>And cross-sharp'd Fops affect the nicest Mien;</L>
<L>Cowards extol true Courage to the Skies,</L>

<L>Dull Rogues affect the Politician's Part;</L>
<L>And learn to nod, and smile, and shrug with Art;</L>
<L>Who nothing has to lose, the War bewails;</L>
<L>And he who nothing pays, at Taxes rails.</L>
<L>Thus, Man, perverse, against plain Nature strives,</L>
<L>And to be artfully absurd, contrives.</L>

<HEAD>A
DISCOURSE
ON THE
PINDARIQUE ODE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Ode is an Attempt towards restoring the
Regularity of the ancient Lyric Poetry, which seems
to be altogether forgotten or unknown by our <HI>English</HI>
Writers.</P>
<P>There is nothing more frequent among us, than a sort of
Poems intitled Pindarique Odes; pretending to be written
in Imitation of the Manner and Stile of <HI>Pindar,</HI> and yet I
do not know that there is to this Day extant in our Lan∣guage,
one Ode contriv'd after his Model. What <HI>Idea</HI> can
an <HI>English</HI> Reader have of <HI>Pindar</HI> (to whose Mouth, when
a Child, the Bees<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pausan, Boeotic.</NOTE> brought their Honey, in Omen of the
future Sweetness and Melody of his Songs) when he shall
she such rumbling and grating Papers of Verses, pretending
to be Copies of his Works?</P>
<P>The Character of these late Pindariques, is, a Bundle of
rambling incoherent Thoughts, express'd in a like Parcel of
irregular Stanza's, which also consist of such another Com∣plication
of disproportion'd, uncertain and perplex'd Verses
and Rhymes. And I appeal to any Reader, if this is not
the Condition in which these Titular Odes appear.</P>
<P>On the contrary, there is nothing more regular than the
Od<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of <HI>Pindar,</HI> both as to the exact Observation of the
Measures and Numbers of his Stanza's and Verses, and the
perpetual Coherence of his Thoughts. For tho' his Digres∣sions
are frequent, and his Transitions sudden, yet is there
ever some secret Connexion, which tho' not always appearing
to the Eye, never fails to communicate itself to the Under∣standing
of the Reader.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="147"/>

Odes; but in each particular Ode they are ever correspon∣dent
one to another in their Turns, and according to the Or∣der
of the Ode.</P>
<P>All the Odes of <HI>Pindar</HI> which remain to us, are Songs
of Triumph, Victory of Success in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Games:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey were sung by a Chorus, and adapted to the <HI>Lyre,</HI> and

Lyri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> Left. The second Stanza
<PB N="151" REF="148"/>
was call'd the <HI>Antistrophé,</HI> from the Contraversion of the
<HI>Chorus;</HI> the Singers, in performing that, turning from the
left Hand to the Right, contrary always to their Motion in
the <HI>Strophé.</HI> The Third Stanza was called the <HI>Epode,</HI>
(it may be as being the After-song) which they sung in the
Middle, neither turning to one Hand nor the other.</P>
<P>What the Origin was of these different Motions and
Stations in singing their Odes, is not our present Business to
enquire. Some have thought that by the Contrariety of the
<HI>Strophé</HI> and <HI>Antistrophé</HI> they intended to represent the Con∣tra-rotation
of the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> in respect of the <HI>Secunda
Mobilia;</HI> and that by their standing still at the <HI>Epode,</HI> they
meant to signify the Stability of the Earth.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Pind. Schol. &amp; Schmid. <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> Others
ascribe the Institution to <HI>Theseus,</HI> who thereby expressed the
Windings and Turnings of the Labyrinth, in celebrating his
Return from thence.</P>
<P>The Method observ'd in the Composition of these Odes,
was therefore as followes. The Poet having made Choice
of a certain Number of Verses to cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itute his <HI>Strophé</HI> or
first <HI>Stanza,</HI> was oblig'd to observe the same in his <HI>Anti∣strophé,</HI>
or second <HI>Stanza;</HI> and which accordingly perpe∣tually
agreed whenever repeated, both in Number of Verses
and Quantity of Feet: He was then again at Liberty to
make a new Choice for his third <HI>Stanza,</HI> or <HI>Epode;</HI> where,
accordingly, he diversif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d his Numbers, as his Ear or Fancy
led him; composing that <HI>Stanza</HI> of more or fewer Verses
than the former, and those Verses of different Measures and
Quantities, for the greater Variety of Harmony, and En∣tertainment
of the Ear.</P>
<P>But then this <HI>Epode</HI> being thus form'd he was strictly
oblig'd to the same<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jul. Scal. Poetic. ad Fin. Cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. l. 3.</NOTE> Measure as often as he should repeat it
in the Order of his Ode, so that every <HI>Epode</HI> in the same
Ode is eternally the same in Measure and Quantity, in respect
to itself; as is also every <HI>Strophé</HI> and <HI>Antistrophé,</HI> in
respect to each other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lyrick</HI> Poet <HI>Stesichorus</HI> (whom<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Longin. de Sub. c. 13.</NOTE> Longinus
reckons amongst the ablest Imitators of <HI>Homer,</HI>

kept within Bounds, he would have been nearest of any
Body, in Merit, to <HI>Homer</HI>) was, if not the Inventer of
this Order in the Ode, yet so strict an Observer of it in his
Compositions, that the Three <HI>Stanza's</HI> of <HI>Stesichorus</HI> be∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e

he could not do it more effectually than by telling him,

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to respect of our Imitations of the Odes of <HI>Pindar.</HI></P>
<P>My <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not to make a long Preface to a short Ode,
nor to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nter upon a Dissertation of Lyric Poetry in general:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> much I thought proper to say, for the Information
of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Readers whose Course of Study has not led 'em into
such Enquiries.</P>
<P>I hope I shall not be so misunderstood, as to have it
thought that I pretend to give an exact Copy of <HI>Pindar</HI> in
this ensuing Ode; or that I look upon it as a Pattern for
his Imitat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs for the future: Far from such Thoughts, I
have only given an Instance of what is practicable, and am
sensible that I am as distant from the Force and Elevation of
<HI>Pindar,</HI> as others have hitherto been from the Harmony
and Regularity of his Numbers.</P>
<P>Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in, we having no <HI>Chorus</HI> to sing our Odes, the Titles,
as well as Use of <HI>Strophé, Antistrophé,</HI> and <HI>Epode,</HI> are
obsolete and impertinent; And certainly there may be very
good <HI>English</HI> Odes, without the Distinction of <HI>Greek</HI> Ap∣pellations
to their <HI>Stanza's.</HI> That I have mention'd 'em
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere, and observ'd the Order of 'em in the ensuing Ode, is
therefore only the more intelligibly to explain the extraordi∣nary
Regularity of the Composition of those Odes, which
<PB N="153" REF="150"/>
have been represented to us hitherto, as the most confus'd
Structures in Nature.</P>
<P>However, though there be no Necessity that our Triumphal
Odes should consist of the Three aforemention'd <HI>Stanza's;</HI>
yet if the Reader can observe that the great Variation of
the Numbers in the Third <HI>Stanza</HI> (call it <HI>Epode,</HI> or what
you please) has a pleasing Effect in the Ode, and makes
him return to the First and Second <HI>Stanzas,</HI> with more
Appetite, than he could do if always cloy'd with the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Quantities and Measures, I cannot see why some Use may
not be made of <HI>Pindar</HI>'s Example, to the great Improvement
of the <HI>English</HI> Ode. There is certainly a Pleasure in be∣holding
any Thing that has Art and Difficulty in the Con∣trivance;
especially, if it appears so carefully executed
that the Difficulty does not shew itself, 'till it is sought for;
and that the seeming Easiness of the Work, first sets us upon
the Enquiry. Nothing can be call'd beautiful without Propor∣tion.
When Symmetry and Harmony are wanting, neither
the Eye nor the Ear can be pleas'd. Therefore certainly
<HI>Poetry,</HI> which includes Painting and Music, should not be
destitute of 'em; and of all <HI>Poetry,</HI> especially the <HI>Ode,</HI>
whose End and Essence is Harmony.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Cowely, <HI>in his Preface to his Pindarique Odes,
speaking of the Music of Numbers▪ says</HI> which sometimes
(especially in Songs and Odes) almost without any thing
else makes an excellent Poet.</P>
<P>Having mention'd Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> it may very well be
expected, that something should be said of him, at a Tim:
when the Imitation of <HI>Pindar</HI> is the Theme of our Discourse.
But there is that great Deference due to the Memory, great
Parts, and Learning of that Gentleman, that I think no∣thing
should be objected to the Latitude he has taken in his
Pindarique Odes. The Beauty of his Verses, are an Atone∣ment
for the Irregularity of his <HI>Stanza's;</HI> and though he
did not imitate <HI>Pindar</HI> in the Strictness of his Numbers, he
has very often happily copy'd him in the Force of his Figures,
and Sublimity of his Sile and Sentiments.</P>
<P>Yet I must beg leave to add, that I believe those irregular
Odes of Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> may have been the principal though
innocent Occasion, of so many deformed Poems since, which
instead of being true Pictures of <HI>Pindar,</HI> have (to use the
<PB N="154" REF="151"/>
<HI>Italian</HI> Painters Term) being only <HI>Caricaturas</HI> of him, Re∣semblances
that for the most part have been either horrid or
ridiculous.</P>
<P>For my own part, I frankly own my Error, in having
heretofore mis-call'd a few irregular <HI>Stanza</HI>'s a Pindarique
Ode; and possibly, if others who have been under the same
Mistake, would ingenuously confess the Truth, they might
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, that never having consulted <HI>Pindar</HI> himself, they took
all his Irregularity upon trust; and finding their Account
in the great Ease with which they could produce Odes with∣out
being oblig'd either to Measure or Design, remain'd sa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sfy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d;
and it may be were not altogether unwilling to
neglect being und<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceiv'd.</P>
<P>Though there be little (if any thing) lest of <HI>Orpheus</HI>
but his Name, yet if<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boectic. <HI>pag.</HI> 588.</NOTE> <HI>Pausanias</HI> was well inform'd, we
may be assur'd that <HI>Brevity</HI> was a Beauty which he most
indus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riously labour'd to preserve in his <HI>Hymns,</HI> notwith∣standing,
as the same Author reports, that they were but
saw in Number.</P>
<P>The Shortness of the following Ode will, I hope, atone
for the Length of the Preface, and in some measure for the
Defects which may be found in it. It consists of the same
Number of <HI>Stanzas</HI> with that beautiful Ode of <HI>Pindar</HI>
which is the first of his <HI>Pythicks;</HI> and though I was
unable to imitate him in any other Beauty, I resolv'd to en∣deavour
to copy his Brevity, and take the Advantage of a
Remarke he has made in the last <HI>Strophé</HI> of the same Ode,
which takes in the Paraphrase of <HI>Sudorius.</HI></P>

<HEAD>HOMER'S
HYMN to VENVS:
Translated into ENGLISH Verse.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>To the Reader of the ensuing HYMN.</HEAD>
<P>OF the three greater Hymns of <HI>Homer, viz.</HI> one to
<HI>Apollo,</HI> one to <HI>Mercury,</HI> and one to <HI>Venus,</HI> this to
<HI>Venus,</HI> is the shortest; it is also the most simple in its Design,
and connected in its Parts. The other two abound more in
Digressions both Geographical and Mythological, and contain
many Allusions to ancient customs and History, which with∣out
a Commentary could not well be understood by the gene∣rality
of Readers. These Considerations determin'd me to
acquiesce in the Translation of this Hymn; tho' I had once
entertain'd Thoughts of turning 'em all three into <HI>English</HI>
Verse.</P>
<P>As I had often read them all with extraordinary Pleasure;
I could not avoid sometimes reflecting on the Censures of some
Grammarians, who have deny'd or at least doubted them to
be genuine.</P>
<P>A Poem which is good in itself, cannot really lose any
thing of its Value, tho' it should appear, upo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a strict En∣quiry,
not to be the Work of so eminent an Author, as him,
to whom it was first imputed. But all Truth is so amiable
in itself that even where it is of least Importance there is a
Pleasure in the Search after it, and a Satisfaction in the
Vindication of it.</P>
<P>Tho' the Beauties of this ensuing Poem, in the Original
want not even the Name of <HI>Homer</HI> to recom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd 'em, and
<PB N="174" REF="171"/>
much less does that mighty Name stand in need of their Re∣putation,
yet, if they are his, 'tis an Injustice to him to a∣scrib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to my other; and it is a Hardship to them to de∣prive
'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m of the Authority due to them, and to leave 'em to
make their Way thro' bad Iudgments, purely by their own
Merit.</P>
<P>I will not trouble the Reader with the Enquiry my Curio∣sity
led me to make in this Matter; I will only give him one
Reason, of many, why these Hymns may be receiv'd for ge∣nuine.
The most suspected of 'em all, is that to <HI>Apollo.</HI> (As
for this to <HI>Venus,</HI> is were almost enough to induce us to con∣clude
it legitimate, to observe that <HI>Lucretius</HI> thought it not
below him to copy, from the Beginning of it, the Beginning
of his own admirable Poem.)</P>
<P>The Hymn to <HI>Apollo</HI> has been suppos'd to have been writ∣ten
by one <HI>Cynaethus</HI> of <HI>Chios,</HI> who was a famous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After the Decease of <HI>Homer,</HI> there were such Per∣sons who made a Profession of repeating his Verses; from the Repetitions, of whom, and of their De∣scendants or Successors (for they became a Sect) the en∣tire Poems of <HI>Homer</HI> in Aftertimes were collected and put in order. These were call'd <HI>Homeristae,</HI> or <HI>Homeridae<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Of whom see <HI>Aelian. Var. Hist. L. 13. C. 14. Athenae, L. 1. 5. 14.

of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Verses. To obviate which Supposition,
we only reply, that this very Hymn to <HI>Apollo</HI> is quoted
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ice by <HI>Thucydides</HI> in the third Book of his History, and
expresly quoted as the Work of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>After his second Quotation, which consists of about half
a score Verses, <HI>Thucydides</HI> observes that in those Verses
<HI>Homer</HI> has made Mention of himself: Hence, 'tis beyond
Question <HI>Thucydides</HI> believ'd or rather was assur'd it was
the Work of <HI>Homer.</HI> He might be very well morally
assur'd of it, for he liv'd within<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herodotus</HI> says of himself, in <HI>Euterpe,</HI> he was but four hundred Years after <HI>Homer.

<HI>Homer,</HI> and that is no Distance of Time to render the
<PB N="175" REF="172"/>
Knowledge of such Things either uncertain or obscure in such
a Country as <HI>Greece,</HI> and to a Man of such Learning,
Power and Wisdom as our Author. The learned <HI>Casaubon,</HI>
in his Comment on a Passage in the first Book of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strab. L. 1. pag. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Strabo,</HI> takes
the Liberty to dissent from <HI>Strabo,</HI> and cites as Authority
against him Part of the Quotation made by <HI>Thucydides</HI> from
the aforemention'd Hymn of <HI>Homer. Strabo</HI> says, <HI>Homer</HI>
has made no mention of what Country he was: In one of
the Verses citied by <HI>Thucydides, Homer</HI> calls himself the
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Original says—The blind Man who lives in rock, or sandy <HI>Chios:</HI> and whose Poems shall be in the highest Esteem to all <HI>Posterity:</HI> Which indeed only proves that he dwelt there; not that he was born there.</NOTE> <HI>blind Man of rocky</HI> Chios. <HI>Casaubon</HI>'s Note is as fol∣lows:

<P>Now whether it be more reasonable, by the Example of so
learned a Man as <HI>Casaubon,</HI> to give Credit to the Authority
of <HI>Thucydides,</HI> the most grave, wise, faithful, and con∣summate
Historian that ever wrote; or to give into the Scru∣ples,
Conjectures, and Suggestions of Scholiasts and Gram∣marians;
