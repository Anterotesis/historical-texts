<HEAD>THE <HI>Scots</HI> Nation and Union VINDICATED, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN pursuing an Enemy, that has neither acted the Gentleman or the Christian, methinks no Man ought to expect our keeping any Rules.</P>
<P>Some wild Beasts are reckon'd sporting Creatures, and must be kill'd fairly; but others that are Ravenous and Cruel, are knock'd down any how, as we can find them.</P>
<P>I have an Adversary that claims a Place in the last Class; a ravenous Fury, that flies at a whole Nation, in spight of an encorporation of Circumstances, and without the Ceremony of pretending to any Provocation.</P>
<P>If this wild Creature is kill'd, he dies <HI>Felo de se;</HI> for <HI>Scotland</HI> being, by the Union, become a Part of our selves, he that Stabbs <HI>Scotland,</HI> may legally be said to Wound himself; for a Man is equally a self-murtherer what Part of his Body soever receives the Wound: And he that Shoots himself into the Belly, is as much <HI>Felo de se,</HI> as he that Cuts his own Throat.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> cannot but take it ill to be so us'd since the Marriage, when she reflects upon the Vows made to her in the Courting.</P>
<P>I resolve to make her amends, and silence all her Complaints against her Spouse; for as a Son of <HI>England</HI> has Affronted her, so a Son of <HI>England</HI> shall do her Justice,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
and the National Quarrel will be fairly Ballanc'd be∣tween us.</P>
<P>The Question will be, What way to deal with this Man-Monster, and with what Weapons we must fight him? It is usually esteem'd the most Honourable way of fight∣ing, to beat a Man, as they call it, at his own Weapons; that is, to take the same Arms which his Enemy is most a Master of; but I must be depriv'd of that Honour; it can't be practis'd here; for the Adversary begins with <HI>LYING,</HI> a Weapon, at which I acknowledge my self no match for him.</P>
<P>In the Art of Fortifications, plain Lines, well fac'd Bastions, solid Works, on good Foundations, are esteem'd the best Defence against the most furious, roaring, and loudest Battery. In like manner, Matter of Fact and plain Truth, is the solid Fortification of an Argument against Falshood and Slander.</P>
<P>He that sets out with a Lye in his Mouth, makes a Bar∣gain with the World, That they should believe nothing he says, and gives earnest for his own part of the Contract.</P>
<P>Our Author acts the true Bully in every Part of his Work; and does it so to the Life, that no Man can take him for a Mimick; he scorns to lye in Jest▪ and laugh you out of the Resentment; but takes as much Pains to let us know he lyes, as he did to tell it.</P>
<P>He begins his Book, with taxing the <HI>Whiggs</HI> with the Sin of Generosity, and the only Crime, of which this Age will scarce rise in judgment against their Predecessors, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of a publick Spirit. This, the <HI>Whiggs</HI> themselves, when they saw the Title Page of his Book, took for a Satyr, and began very candidly to acknowledge they had been too justly charg'd with the contrary Extreme, even to a Pro∣verb.</P>
<P>But when they come to find the Man in earnest, they could not, in Charity, believe but he must be Mad. If he stands upon the Reputation of his Sences, and is loath
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
to bear the Scandal upon his Understanding, it must e'en be transferr'd to his Principles; for it must be allow'd, that whatever he would have others believe, he doth not be∣lieve himself.</P>
<P>To hear a <HI>Tory</HI> charge the <HI>Whiggs</HI> with Generosity and a publick Spirit! What must this pass for? A Banter it cannot be, because of the Pains he takes to have it be be∣lieved; a serious Charge it cannot be, because of all the Vouchers to the contrary to be taken from the same Au∣thors own Works.</P>
<P>These Circumstances reduce it to the Necessity of be∣ing call'd by its own Name, in plain <HI>English,</HI> without any Coverture, Concealment, or Disguise whatsoever, <HI>(viz.)</HI> a known premeditated <HI>LYE.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus oblig'd to call a Spade a Spade, contrary to the Rules of Decency, I must make him amends by a Proof of the Fact, which I know no Way to do, but by setting down his own Words, and letting himself speak for himself.</P>
<P>In the first Page of his Book, we find this most excel∣lent Introduction, which, tho' I have no room to <HI>Para∣graph him,</HI> I must recite, and make such recommendation of its Contents to the Courteous Readers, (so we Authors call our most ill natur'd Criticks,) as the Case requires.</P>
<P><Q>“”I cannot without some Envy, and a just Resentment against the opposite Conduct of others, reflect upon the Generosity and Tenderness wherewith the Heads and principal Members of a struggling Faction, treat those who will undertake to hold a Pen in their De∣fence. And the Behaviour of these Patrons is yet more laudable, because the Benefits they confer, are al∣most <HI>gratis;</HI> if any of their Labourers can scratch out a Pamphlet, they desire no more; there is no Question
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
offer'd about the Wit, the Stile, the Argument, let the Pamphlet come out upon demand, and in a pro∣per Juncture, you shall be well and certainly paid, you shall be paid before-hand, every one of the Party who is able to Read, and can spare a Shilling, shall be a Sub∣scriber.</Q></P>
<P>But where now say you is the Falsity in this Para∣graph—I'll do the Author the justice to own that it is not in the first Line, where he says, he is supply'd with <HI>Envy and Resentment.</HI> No Man will doubt him there, besides he has distinguish'd his Manner; for he gives evidence to prove what he says in that Part, which he has not Thought worth his while to do in any Thing else.</P>
<P>But before I go on, I must not fall into the same Crime that I condemn, for having said he has LYED, this must be proved. 'Tis a course Word at best, and the courser it is, the more need to make it out, which I do thus.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis fair to believe it false, because <HI>it is not</HI> prov'd <HI>affirmante Incumbat probatio,</HI> and our Author having af∣firm'd and not prov'd it, thereby proves that he has said what he cannot prove.</P>
<P N="2">2. But in the next Place, it is believed <HI>he cannot</HI> prove it, and that is the hardest Part upon him.</P>
<P>If he expects to be taken <HI>Verb. sacerd.</HI> he must excuse me, I alledge it is not fair, because publick Faith of all kinds, and this among the rest, does not go at the usual Price, the Stock is fallen so low there are no Bidders.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, he does not give such large Credit to those he deals with; and in return, if he comes to me to be taken upon his Word, my Answer is, <HI>No trust by Retail.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore, his Affirmation not having the force of an Oath, because he is no <HI>Quaker,</HI> proves to
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
me of no force at all without Evidence; because I am an <HI>Ʋnbeliever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He says the</HI> Whigs <HI>are Generous to their Authors,</HI> You shall be well and certainly paid, you shall be paid before-hand, every one of the Party who is able to Read, and can spare a Shilling, shall be a Subscriber.</P>
<P>That this was not always so, the starving Authors who have been undone in the Service of the <HI>Whigs,</HI> are invin∣cible Evidences; such as <HI>Julian Johnson, Lawr. Braddon, John Tutchin, Jer. White, Ditto, Ditto, Ditto, ad Infini∣tum,</HI> besides those who they complain left them for want of Bread; even to their modern Sufferers, now in Prison and Banishment, who I doubt cannot boast.</P>
<P>How long the Alteration has happened among the <HI>Whigs</HI> he has left for a Secret; for if the Passage he Points at were true, as to the Crisis, it no more helps him out, or saves his Credit, than <HI>one Swallow makes a Summer.</HI></P>
<P>In brief, he has shew'd himself the worst Engineer in the World, for as they in a Fire, blow up one House to save a Street, he has blown up the whole Street to save a House. His Satyr is upon the Subscription to the <HI>CRISIS,</HI> to expose the Assistance to which, he charges all the <HI>Whigs</HI> with professing universally such a generous Princi∣ple, which it had been infinitely their Honour if it had been true, and is their only Misfortune that it is not.</P>
<P>Thus our Author enters the Stage in very good Com∣pany, <HI>ENVY</HI> and Falshood, one in one Hand, and one in t other, and behind him <HI>RESENTMENT</HI> follows cloath'd with Slander against his Friends; the Production must be Good that is born of such Ancestors.</P>
<P>I shall not concern this Tract with any Part of his Answer to the <HI>Crisis,</HI> I shall suppose the Author of the <HI>Crisis</HI> and he, are able to carry on their own War without any Foreign Alliances; but our Author having been en∣gag'd with an Enemy in the Field, has maliciously turn'd his Hand, and fired side ways at the Lookers on. This
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
they can't but take unkindly, because having not declar'd themselves Parties in the Quarrel, he has acted like an Enemy to Mankind in the Gross, and falling promiscu∣ously upon Friend and Foe, shew'd that he chooses to do Evil for the sake of doing Evil, which Theologists say, is not to be charg'd upon Satan himself.</P>
<P>This brings us to his Twenty second Page, where he begins to talk of the Union; and where he fires his whole Platoon upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, but especially upon the No∣bility of that Nation, a Body as illustrious for all those Things which make Men truly Noble, as any the World ever produced.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon the Discourse of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation or their Affairs, it is but Justice to the Enemy, and much more to the Reader, to give the Matter of Charge in his own Words; <HI>First,</HI> That the Author may have no Wrong, and every Reader be judge whether he has or no; and <HI>Secondly,</HI> That I may dismiss the Scandalous Creature, and Trouble the Reader no more with him.</P>
<P>The Words which have given such a just Offence to the World, are comprised in the following Paragraphs taken from the Book entituled, <HI>The Publick Spirit of the Whigs,</HI> &amp;c. and which being justly afraid, or asham'd of, he has thought fit to omit in the subsequent Edition of the same Libel, as follows.</P>
<P><Q>“”After Two and twenty Pages spent in reciting <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 24.</NOTE>Acts of Parliament, <HI>he</HI> (meaning the <HI>Crisis) de∣sires leave to repeat the History and Progress of the Ʋnion;</HI></Q> upon which, I have some few Things to observe.</P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>This Work,</HI> he tells us, <HI>was unsuccessfully attempted by several of her Majesty's Predecessors;</HI> tho' I do not re∣member it was ever Thought on by any except King <HI>James</HI> the First, and the late King <HI>William.</HI> I have read indeed, That some small Overtures were made by the former of these Princes towards an Union between the Two Kingdoms, but rejected with Indignation and Con∣tempt
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
by the <HI>English.</HI> And the Historian tell us, That how degenerate and corrupt soever the Court and Par∣liament then were, they would not give Ear to so infa∣mous a Proposal. I do not find that any of the succeed∣ing Princes, before the Revolution ever resumed the Design, because it was a Project for which there could not possibly be assigned the least Reason or Necessity: For I defy any Mortal to name one single Advantage that <HI>England</HI> could ever expect from such an Union.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”But towards the End of the late King's Reign, upon Apprehension of the Want of Issue from him or the Princess <HI>Anne,</HI> a Proposition for Uniting both Kingdoms was begun, because <HI>Scotland</HI> had not settled their Crown upon the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> but left themselves at large, in Hopes to make their Advantage: And it was thought highly dangerous to leave that Part of the Island inha∣bited by a poor, fierce Northern People, at Liberty to put themselves under a different King: However, the Opposition to this Work was so great, that it could not be overcome till some Time after Her present Majesty came to the Crown, when by the Weakness or Corrup∣tion of a certain Minister since dead, an Act of Parlia∣ment was obtain'd for the <HI>Scots,</HI> which gave them leave to Arm themselves, and so the Union became necessary, not for any actual Good it could possibly do us, but to avoid a probable Evil; and at the same time, save an obnoxious Minister's Head, who was so Wise, as to take the first Opportunity of procuring a general Pardon by Act of Parliament, because he could not with so much Decency or Safety desire a particular One for himself. These Facts are well enough known to the whole King∣dom: And I remember, Discoursing above Six Years ago with the most considerable Person of the adverse Party, and a great Promoter of the Union, he frankly own'd to me, That this Necessity, brought upon us by
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
the wrong Management of the E—of <HI>G</HI>—, was the only Cause of the Union.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Therefore▪ I am ready to grant Two Points to the Author of the <HI>Crisis:</HI> First, That the Union became Necessary for the Cause above related, because it preven∣ted the Island from being govern'd by Two Kings, which <HI>England</HI> would never have suffer'd: and it might proba∣bly have cost us a War of a Year or Two to reduce the <HI>Scots. Secondly,</HI> That it would be Dangerous to break this Union, at least in this Juncture, while there is a <HI>Pretender</HI> abroad, who might probably lay hold of such an Opportunity. And this made me wonder a little at the Spirit of Faction last Summer among some People, who having been the great Promoters of the Union, and several of them the principal Gainers by it, could yet pro∣ceed so far, as to propose in the House of Lords, that it should be Dissolved; while, at the same Time, those Peers who had ever opposed it in the Beginning, were then for Preserving it, upon the Reason I have just assigned, and which the Author of the <HI>Crisis</HI> hath like∣wise taken Notice of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”But when he tells us, <HI>The</HI> Englishmen <HI>ought in Genero∣sity to be more particularly careful in preserving</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 25.</NOTE><HI>this Ʋnion,</HI> he argues like himself. <HI>The late Kingdom of</HI> Scotland, (saith he) <HI>had as nu∣merous a Nobility as</HI> England, &amp;c. They had indeed; and to that we owe one of the great and necessary Evils of the Union upon the Foot it now stands. Their No∣bility is indeed so numerous, that the whole Revenues of their Country would be hardly able to maintain them according to the Dignity of their Titles; and what is infinitely worse, they are never likely to be Ex∣tinct till the last Period of all Things, because the greatest Part of them Descend to Heirs general. I imagine, a Person of Quality prevailed on to Marry a Woman much his Inferior, and without a Groat to her Fortune,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
and her Friends arguing, she was as good as her Hus∣band, because she brought him as numerous a Family of Relations and Servants, as she found in his House. <HI>Scot∣land</HI> in the Taxes is oblig'd to contribute One Penny for every Forty Pence laid upon <HI>England;</HI> and the Represen∣tatives they send to Parliament are about a Thirteenth. Every other <HI>Scots</HI> Peer has all the Priviledges of an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> one, except that of Sitting in Parliament, and even Precedence before all of the same Title that shall be cre∣ated for the Time to come. The Pensions and Employ∣ments possessed by the Natives of that Country now among us, do amount to more than the whole Body of their Nobility ever spent at Home; and all the Money they raise upon the Publick is hardly sufficient to defray their Civil and Military Lists. I could Point out some with great Titles, who affected to appear very vigorous for Dissolving the Union, though their whole Revenues before that Period would have ill maintained a <HI>Welch</HI> Justice of the Peace; and have since gathered more Money than ever any <HI>Scotchmen,</HI> who had not travell'd, could form an Idea of.</Q></P>
<P>That most of this is entirely left out in the Third Edition of his Book is true, whether from a Sence of the Wrong done the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, and the injury to Truth, or Sence of Danger and of Justice from the Notice taken of his Book in the House of Peers, he knows best, and would do well to tell.</P>
<P>But does he think this is a Satisfaction to the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to the whole <HI>Scots</HI> Nation? Does he think that having disperst a lybellous Slander, at which not the <HI>Scots</HI> alone, but every impartial <HI>Englishman</HI> is justly incens'd, they are to rest satisfy'd, that in the subsequent Edition of his Book he has left it out?</P>
<P>He has made them his Jest already, and must think they are in Jest with him, if this Smoothing Iron can work out the Marks and Scars which his rude and inso∣lent
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Attack had made on the Character of a whole Nation.</P>
<P>Should this go down, it would be a worse Affront upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation than the first; and having told them already they are Insolent and Beggarly, and follow'd it with a Throng of the like rough <HI>English,</HI> which he excels in, it would also be to tell them they are tame Fools, that know not how to resent such Usage, or cannot see when they are Mal-treated; neither of which will be found to be any Part of the <HI>Scots</HI> Character.</P>
<P>This Author is farther inexcusable, either in his Folly, or his Insolence to his own Country and to the Govern∣ment: For either he said this upon a Presumption that the <HI>English</HI> Nation would joyn with, and agree to this Treat∣ment of their newly united Friends the <HI>Scots,</HI> which was the worst Insolence of that Kind he could be guilty of; or else he must depend upon it they would not resent it, tho' they did not approve of it; in both which, we thank him, he did his best to make the Quarrel National, but he has <HI>taken a Tartar,</HI> and his Passions having left his Sences in the <HI>Lurch,</HI> however he may escape with his Knavery, his best Friends will never excuse his Folly.</P>
<P>I shall not honour his Example; I shall act no Envy; I wish him no Punishment, tho' if he Escapes, it is because the Servants of Hell are generally truer to their Employer than those who Work for a better Master; and that as the worst Actions are oftnest conceal'd, and the best oft∣nest betray'd, he owes his Safety to the Consequence.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation must not lye down under the Charge, because it is Slanderous; nor the <HI>English</HI> under the Charge of bearing it, because that would be Scandalous. For our own Sakes we must do Justice to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that we may not be reproacht with Connivance at a Slander, and give Occasion to the <HI>Scots</HI> to say, that we do not act honourably with them; and for their Sakes, that they may make good the ancient Motto of their Country, <HI>Nemo me Impune Laces<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
If nothing else were the Consequence of the Union, this must be allow'd, that they are thereby disarm'd from the Power of doing themselves Right against us in a Parliamentary Manner, which strongly implies that they are more particularly in the Protection of the Parliamen∣tary Justice which Remains; and that we ought to Esteem every Thing that Touches the Honour of <HI>Scotland</HI> Natio∣nally, as equally affecting all <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, we should be Nicer in an Affront offer'd to the Na∣tion and Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by how much the more frankly they have by the Union given themselves as it were into our Hands.</P>
<P>The Union was the Act of both Nations: But with∣out Offence to either, it may be said, it was more the act of one than the other: One Side strove more for it than the other; more Opposition was made to it on one Part than on the other, which was which, need not be Nam'd; but if that Side should Reproach the Union first, who most carnestly sought it before, it must be consess'd the Charge of Ingratitude cannot lye upon the other.</P>
<P><HI>Our slanderous Lybeller compares the Union to a Mar∣riage, and invidiously states the Comparison,</HI> a Person of Quality <HI>(England)</HI> marrying a Woman much his inferior▪ <HI>(Scotland)</HI> and her Friends arguing she was as good as her Husband, because she had as many Relations and Servants as he.</P>
<P>Our Author, it seems, knows little of the Laws of Matrimony; perhaps he is under Vows of Priests Celibacy; and it seems he knows as little of the Laws of Dignity, for if he looks into Heraldry he will find a stated Rule as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>If a Man of a mean Fortune, and without any Designa∣tion, marries a Woman of Quality, by her Marriage she loses her Dignity, and shall Rank but in the Degree of her Husband <HI>vice Versa.</HI> A Woman of mean Condition marries a Person of the highest Quality, she Ranks in
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Right of his Title, and takes Place of all those, whose Quality, tho' superiour to her, was Inferiour to that of her Husband. Let our Author take this which way he plea∣ses in the Affair of the Union, which he has call'd a Mar∣riage, it will be against him, and he may thank himself for the Comparison.</P>
<P>If <HI>Scotland</HI> was inferiour, <HI>England</HI> by the Encorpora∣tion of the Union has made her more than equal, for an Encorporation is a Dissolving both into one: And the <HI>Scots</HI> are become a part of ourselves, so that in Fact there is not a <HI>Scotsman</HI> or an <HI>Englishman</HI> in the World, the Two Natures, nationally Speaking, being dissolved into One, <HI>viz. Britain;</HI> and the Simily or Allusion of a Marriage is lame, and halts in the Case very much; for in a Marriage the Woman is a Subject, an inferiour; Promises Obedience, and is call'd by the Name of her Husband: But here is an entire Dissolution of the former Capacities and Cir∣cumstances, and both become subjected equally to a new Constitution, and take up a new Name.</P>
<P>If either of these United Persons, or States, or Bodies, call them as you please, practise the least Superiority or Autho∣rity over one another as <HI>England,</HI> or as <HI>Scotland,</HI> they invade the Contract, Trespass upon the other; are Injurious and Unjust; not to insist upon their being so far <HI>Felo de se,</HI> and making an Attempt upon that Constitution which being whole and undivided is the Life of both.</P>
<P>But to humour our facetious, tho' scurrilous Author, let us go on with him in the Whym of a Marriage, in which he makes <HI>England</HI> the Husband, and <HI>Scotland</HI> the Wife. Tho' it seems here is no Headship as in Matri∣mony, but it is the more like our Author still, whose in∣consistent Raillery, has indeed neither Head or Tail.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> being the Husband, has married a Wife, <HI>says this Author,</HI> much inferiour to him in Quality. <HI>Good!</HI> But who promoted the Match? Did the Wife Court him or draw him in? Was he heated with Liquor, and
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
did it when he was Drunk? Or was he hookt in, cheated and surpriz'd into it? Did she mannage him cunningly, and employ Agents to wheedle him? Did she obtain a rash Promise, which was performed purely upon Prin∣ciples of Honour and the like? If this is the Case in a real Marriage of a Man and a Woman, as often hap∣pens, we say of such a Woman she runs a great Risque, 'tis odds but she may have the Hearing of it again, and be ill used without any Room to complain: But if on the other Hand she declin'd the Match, fled from him, strug∣gled vehemently with her Friends who persuaded her to have him, and had the Words of Matrimony as it were cramm'd down her Throat, she may indeed be blam'd if she makes an ill Wife; but he can never be excus'd if he makes an ill Husband. What if her Portion were small? Nay, what if she had not a Groat, it al∣ters not the Case at all, neither does it furnish him with the least Word to Reproach her with, he being the Ag∣gressor in the Match. If he Insults her, she Answers pre∣sently and aptly, in Terms like these, by way of Expostulation, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>“”Where is the Honour of your Treat∣ing me thus? DID I seek you? DID I Court you? WAS I NOT content to remain in my meaner Circumstances? DID I NOT press you earnestly to <HI>leave me where you found me first?</HI> DID I NOT long deny? DID YOU NOT Throng me with Vows of using me kindly; and treating me honourably, making solemn Protestations of taking my Part against all Mankind, and advancing my Relations equally with your own? DID YOU NOT protest that you would take all my Enemies for your Enemies; defend my E∣state against all that should Trespass me, and my Person against all that should Insult me? DID YOU NOT promise to employ my poor Servants, and enrich my poor Relations, the same who you now upbraid me with, by tak∣ing them into Partnership with your Undertakers of Pro∣jects?
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
DID YOU NOT promise and engage to give my Tenants freegress and regress into, and out of all Parts of your Estate; to allow me all my own Reve∣nue for the Maintenance and Support of my own Dignity and Family? And DID YOU NOT add a Thousand Chimera's of imaginary Advantages which I should reap by the Match? And DO YOU now upbraid me with my Poverty? What was it to you, how many poor Relations or poor Servants I had? DID I ask you to keep the one, or to employ the other? I maintain'd my own Family, and paid my own Servants their Wages without you: I neither needed your Help or sought it: If you had not an extraordinary Occa∣sion for your Alliance with me, why did you take me from my Friends and my native Soil, and encorporate me and all mine into your own Family? And why make so many Vows and Protestations of Kindness to me, and of your unalterable Resolutions to use me kindly, and to behave honourably and courteously to me? <HI>On the contrary,</HI> as poor as I am, Have you not engag'd the Rent of my Estate upon your own Affairs; borrow'd Money upon my Lands to carry on your own Law Suits, and Mortgag'd my Joynture to pay your own Debts? In what Respect then am I to be up∣braided with Poverty? And who pray is the richer of the Two, I that have but little and am out of Debt, or you that have a great deal and owe more than you can pay for almost a hundred Year to come?</Q> Sup∣pose this to be the Speech of a Woman to her Husband, who after Marriage it may be uses her ill: The pre∣sent Question is this, would not every one say that the Woman had Reason of her Side?</P>
<P>In the next Place; Suppose the Woman were to add in farther Expostulation with him thus: <Q>“”BESIDES, SIR, you do me and my Family a great deal of Wrong in your Reproaches of Meanness, and of my being your

<HI>Inferiour,</HI> for you know very well I am of as much more ancient a Family than your self; that I have as truly noble Blood in my Veins as you, or any of your Re∣lations have: Nay, that I am more noble than you, for I am more nearly than you allied to to the Crown that Rules over you; and the Person of your Prince descends more immediately from my Family than from yours; my Titles also are as good as yours, and I could at all Times have been married; nay, and formerly have been married to Persons of equal Rank (if not Supe∣riour) to your self; nay, and that now I am married to you, I advance my self nothing in Rank, for I take Place as well, and of as many now, by the Right of my own Titles, as I do by yours: And tho' my Relations are not so rich as yours, they have as much Honour, and their Ancestors have always maintain'd that Honour in former Times, without the Help of yours, and could have done so still; so that I do not Esteem my self your Inferiour at all, except only that I have submitted my self to be your Wife.</Q></P>
<P>If the married Woman can say all this, will not every Man say she has wrong done her if she is Mal-treated by her Husband?</P>
<P>To carry on the Matter, our Lybeller's Allusion of a Marriage, and bring the Husband off handsomely from so scandalous an Affair as using his Wife inhumanely, i'll suppose him Answering her thus:</P>
<P><Q>“”I acknowledge all you say, <HI>Madam,</HI> to be true, and really it was ever far from my Design to use you ill, or not to treat you suitable to your Quality, and to the Promises and Engagements I so voluntarily made with you when I married you; and I am very much surpriz'd to hear your Complaint, for I know nothing of it my self; and if any of my Domesticks have done it, I shall, upon the first Notice of it, do you Justice, and punish it severely.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
One would make such an Answer for any honest Man, because the Case deserves it, and no Man of common Sense could say less: In Answer to which, <HI>Madam</HI> replies, <Q>“”Let me then see your Detestation of the Thing by your making Examples of those Servants of yours who have treated me after this scandalous Manner.</Q></P>
<P>And thus Ends the Family civil: The Honour and Re∣putation of the Wife is, and ought to be vindicated; the Sincerity and Justice of the Husband is thoroughly cleared by his doing Justice upon those Servants of his that had thus abused his Wife: But having endeavoured to find out the particular Persons, they deny'd the Fact, and refusing to accuse one another, the good Man pub∣lish'd his Abhorrence of the Mal-treatment his Wife had receiv'd, and promis'd 300 Pieces of Money to any of them that would acquaint him who it was had thus treated his Wife.</P>
<P>This the Lady takes for sufficient Satisfaction, and so they exchanged the Kiss of Peace; and the Tranquility of the Family was restor'd, as at the Beginning.</P>
<P>If this Allegory does not run upon all Four in our Case, let it run on as many Legs as it can, we know on which Side it will Halt.</P>
<P>I apply it to no Body, let those that fit the Coat wear it, 'tis Application makes the Ass..</P>
<P>This serves, tho' Allegorically, to Answer all that can be objected by the <HI>English,</HI> against the Union with <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> which, if our Lybeller will have it call'd a Mar∣riage, has certainly these few unhappy Circumstances in it, which, what ever else may be said, must silence all Complaints on our Side.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>England</HI> sought to <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Uniting, not <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England;</HI> that may be evinc't by many Evidences.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
2. <HI>England,</HI> if any, must have gain'd by the Union; for as to <HI>Scotland</HI> we hear yet little of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Scotland</HI> was not so low, or so poor, but if they had not Courted her, other Nations would.</P>
<P N="4">4. When ever ye think well to break the Union, it it is thought <HI>Scotland</HI> will not deny you.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> was now broken, or to be broken, it is thought by many, <HI>England</HI> would lose more by it than <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Ʋnion</HI> is a particular Security against the Pre∣tender; on which Account, all those who Value the Protestant Succession must have a real and propor∣tion'd Value for the <HI>Ʋnion.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. It is presum'd, the People who so rashly Talk against the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> know little, or consider little of the Dangers to both which attend them, if they Re∣turn to their Independent Condition.</P>
<P>Thus much may serve for Answer on his simple Ja∣cobite Banters upon the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> with <HI>Scotland,</HI> which he neither understands how to keep, or how to break, or what will be the Consequences of either: But if any Thing provokes him more than usually against the UNION with <HI>Scotland,</HI> it seems to be the unalterable∣ness of the Protestant Succession, which is establish'd by the said <HI>Ʋnion;</HI> and which for that Reason the Jacobites in both Parts of the Country are the only People that push at the Dissolving the said <HI>Ʋnion.</HI></P>
<P>From his Affront offer'd to the Nation of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he comes next to fall upon the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this in the most unusual, unhandsome, and unmannerly way that was ever practised in the like Case.</P>
<P>The Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> need no Character or Enco∣mium; the Antiquity of their Families, their personal Gallantry, the merit of their Ancestors, as well as the Honour of their Country, makes them known, and uni∣versally
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
esteem'd thro' the whole World. No Men are more acceptable abroad in the World, none more esteem'd, and none owe that Esteem more to their own Vertue and Merit than they do. In all Ages, and in all Nations, they have been recommended by their own personal Behavi∣our to the greatest Employments, and to the greatest Favour both of Princes and Kingdoms, as Soldiers and Generals; all the World Courts them, are fond of them, and value them beyond other Nations.</P>
<P>Even this Fellow, whose good will to Slander, no Man can have the least Reason to Question; and who having little to say of their Persons, vents his Rage against the Nation it self. The Contempt he treats them with in general, shews, that he strives to load them with what ever he thinks would render them scandalous and odious; but even in this Attempt he comes into <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Character of the Satyr of—</P>
<Q><L>Much Malice mingled with but little Wit.</L></Q>
<P>Nor could his Malice have betray'd him to more Folly than he has shewn in this Part. Physitians ascribe one part of Madness to a Rupture of the Gall, which, when it happens, they say, it is a kind of Madness that runs People up to the most malicious Things, in the most simple and preposterous Kind imaginable.</P>
<P>Of this kind, the Author of this mad but foolish Lybel has acted; for designing to throw Scandal and Dirt upon the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he has singled out one to Reproach them with, which, at best, if it had been true, had been only a Misfortune, but was never call'd a Crime before, <HI>viz.</HI> Poverty: And yet we shall see how far from Truth that scandalous Aspersion is in it self, how ill grounded in the whole, and how little it ought to be nam'd in a Nation▪ where there are to be found
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
far more Examples of large Inheritances of Honours and Titles without Estates, than in all <HI>Scotland;</HI> and never∣theless was never retorted upon them as a criminal Po∣verty, any more than it ought to be upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the like is not to be sound.</P>
<P>The Poverty with which we insult the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility, deserves therefore to be a little enquir'd into, and shall be consider'd abstractedly and comparatively.</P>
<P>If Poverty is consider'd abstractedly, the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> are as far from being Poor, as the Nobility of any Nation under the Sun, having always had sufficient Estates to maintain the Honour and Dignity of their Families, sufficient to support all the needful Expences of a liberal Education, Travail, Learning, and of a handsome Intro∣duction into the World, suitable to Men of the first Rank.</P>
<P>If some Families have sunk by the Misfortunes of some one or other among them, who have been either less Pro∣vident, or ess Enterprizing, than their Fathers; Is not the like here in <HI>England?</HI> only with this Difference, that there are more Examples in <HI>Scotland</HI> of the Posterity of such having raised those Families again by their Vertue and Bravery than there are here, or perhaps in any Nation in the World.</P>
<P>I forbear considering the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> comparatively, because it may seem to reflect upon, and give Offence to the Nobility with whom they are now United, and look as if we were making those Comparisons to the Disadvantage of <HI>England,</HI> which, 'tis declar'd, is not in the least intended in this Book.</P>
<P>If the Estates of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility are smaller than those in <HI>England,</HI> the Influence and Authority they have upon, and over the People in their own Country, is, without Comparison, beyond what the <HI>English</HI> Nobility have, or pretend to in theirs. And this renders their Persons far more considerable, and their Dignity, Honour and In∣terest greater than those can be in any Nation, who have
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
nothing to render their Figure great but Money and Titles. It might be enquir'd here how many Noble Persons, in some Part of the World, more than in <HI>Scotland,</HI> may be found, who have not Estates to support their Dignities, and become entirely dependant, by that exigence of Circum∣stances, upon the Courts and Ministers of State; of this or that Party, on one Side as well as on the other.</P>
<P>It might be enquir'd and calculated, whether there were more of these in <HI>Scotland</HI> than in other Parts or no.</P>
<P>It might be enquir'd whether the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility were not always in better Credit; and whether they were more in Debt than the Nobility of other Nations, in proportion to their Estates, tho' at the same Time they enjoy'd no Pro∣tection of Law against just Debts, either for their Persons or Estates. And whether any Man would not more freely lend Money to a <HI>Scots</HI> Nobleman, than to any of the No∣bility of other Countries?</P>
<P>It might be enquir'd whether there are not in other Parts Noblemen to be found less able to pay their Debts than in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and especially less willing, among those that are able; but many Reasons prevent my Entring up∣on these Comparisons at this Time, however to the Advan∣tage of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>If then the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> appear superior in their Interest, and influence in their Country; have Estates equally able to support their Dignity, and an Authority far superior to all others of equal Rank with themselves, all the scandal of their Poverty falls to the Ground.</P>
<P>But it cannot be omitted, that the supposed Poverty of the <HI>Scot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Nobility, so much of it as may be thought real, is too evidently chargeable also upon <HI>England,</HI> which, on the other Hand, is a good Reason why the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen might expect not to hear of it in that Country which is so visibly the Occasion of it: And this respects the removal of the Court from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> whether the No∣bility and Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> necessarily following, spend
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
the Revenues of their Estates either in the usual Luxury of Courts, which in <HI>England</HI> is encreas'd to a very great Degree, and which has been the ruin of many good <HI>English</HI> Families, as well as <HI>Scots;</HI> or in following the Fortuues of their Royal Master▪ who by the <HI>English</HI> Rebellion lost not his Crown only, but his Life; or in their fruitless Attendance in pursuit of their Interests and just Requests at the Court of the Princes of that Age.</P>
<P><HI>From all which, I believe, the Insults of this Lybeller may be turn'd off from the</HI> Scots <HI>Nation effectually thus, That whereas he alledges scandalously and maliciously, that</HI> the Persions and Em∣ployments possess'd by the Natives of that Country <HI>(Scotland)</HI> now among us, do amount to more than the whole Body of their Nobility ever spent at Home.</P>
<P>On the other Hand I undertake to say, That the Money spent by the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> (and being the produce of their own Estates too) in the Services of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and in their fruitless Attendance upon, or Residence in the <HI>English</HI> Courts, amounts to infinitely more than all that they or any of their Nation ever gain'd or receiv'd in Pensions or Employments from the <HI>English</HI> Court, since the Two Crowns were United.</P>
<P>Hence it will follow, that it is so far from being just to say, that the <HI>Scots</HI> are Gainers by <HI>England,</HI> that, on the contrary, the <HI>English</HI> have so far been the Ruin of <HI>Scotland</HI> as to Wealth, Ready-Money, &amp;c. The Revenues and Cash of that Country having been always carried out of the Country, and the Nobility and Gentry spend∣ing their Estates at the <HI>English</HI> Court.</P>
<P>Why else should all Nations round us encrease in Wealth and Commerce; their Lands and Estates be improv'd, Rents and Re∣venues rais'd, and the like, and <HI>Scotland</HI> only decline and lan∣guish? this could never be, but by a continual Consumption, like an inward Bleeding, that has destroy'd the Vitals of <HI>Scotland,</HI> exhausted her Wealth, and brought the <HI>English</HI> Court to be the Center of all the Wealth and Ready-Money of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which should otherwise have circulated in a Home Consumption to the Encouragement of Trade, and the enriching their own People.</P>
<P>And shall we be ubpraided with Poverty by those who have made us Poor! It is not only unjust, but ungrateful.</P>
<P>But from our stock of Money, let us descend to our stock of Honour, Vertue, Gallantry and Reputation in the World; and let the Lybeller shew the List of <HI>English</HI> Noblemen engag'd in the Field of <HI>Mars,</HI> and make Comparisous with us when he pleases.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Among the great Men who have appear'd in Arms Abroad, let him shew us any Nation in the World where so many have raised themselves to the highest Dignities and Employments by their proper Merit, Gallantry, Behaviour, Experience in military Affairs, and by their Bravery and Conduct, let them bring any History of the Memory of the most strict observer to enquire into.</P>
<P>It shall remain as a Monument of Honour to the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Scotland,</HI> That in the Wars of <HI>Germany,</HI> under that Experienc'd Soldier, or rather Father of Soldiers, the Great <HI>Gu∣stavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> The Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> so signaliz'd their Bravery and Conduct, that his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty Distinguish'd them by his Constant Favours, and bestow∣ed the greatest Commands upon them, did them the greatest Honours, and committed the greatest Trust to them, even be∣fore those of his own Native Country of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>And it shall remain as a Record to the Honour of the <HI>Scots</HI> Na∣tion, that we can shew such a List as is hereto subjoyn'd, of <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen who raised themselves to the highest Command in the <HI>Swedish</HI> Armies by their own proper Merit; the like of which, I believe cannot be shown by any other War, or by any other Na∣tion in the World.</P>
<P>The Manuscript I have had in my Hands many years, neither is it to be Contradicted, the Histories of those Times making fre∣quent mention of all their Names.</P>
<P>Besides whom, at the same time, the <HI>French</HI> then in Confede∣racy with <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> Entertain'd a Great many of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility and Gentry with the like Honour and Reputation to the <HI>Scots:</HI> A List of whom I have also in my Hands, but have not room here to make it Public.</P>
<P>Let the Lybeller Examin the Rolls of the <HI>English</HI> Armies, even now when this Nation has been involv'd in a War, with a small Intermission for above Twenty year, and when the Interest, Reli∣gion and Honour of their own Country has been engag'd, yet he will scarce be able to shew the like List of Persons of Quality, Noblemen and Gentlemen of the first Rank, hazarding their Lives, and raising the Fame and Fortunes of their Families at the Expence of their Blood.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Noblemen and Gentlemen are not supposed by this to want Courage and Bravery. But it is apparent, whether Wealth, Sloth, or Luxury are the Occasion, I determin not; yet it is apparent, I say, there has been fewer of the Men of
<PB N="2$" REF="24"/>
Quality and Honour of this Age seen in the Field this War, than was known on such an Occasion in this Nation.</P>
<P>If then the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility have a greater Interest in their Country, and do greater Service to their Country, it must be allow'd that they shew themselves as well Deserving from their Country as any Noblemen in the World can do.</P>
<P>If other Noblemen Enjoy Wealth IN their own Country, these are a Wealth TO their Country, and Honour and Reputation to the very Name of their Nation, and are by their Merit rendred more truly Illustrious than it is possible for any Men of Honour to be who are recommended by their Money, and not by their Virtue.</P>
