<L>AS some fond father, who a bantling rears,</L>
<L>Feels nought but pleasure in his tender years;</L>
<L>His tricks at school, and all the pranks he plays,</L>
<L>E'en the boy's foibles then excite his praise.</L>
<L>A little spirit well becomes a youth;</L>
<L>Jack, though unlucky, always speaks the truth.</L>
<L>But when arriv'd at a maturer age,</L>
<L>He launches Jackey upon life's great stage:</L>
<L>With joy elate, with anxious fears deprest,</L>
<L>What hopes and horrors fill a parent's breast!</L>
<L>E'er yet he dares to cast the dangerous die,</L>
<L>And shew his darling to the public eye,</L>
<L>The hopes of all his future joy he sends,</L>
<L>To visit some, <HI>he knows</HI> to be his friends:</L>
<L><HI>Surly</HI> exclaims, eat up with gout and spleen,</L>
<L>The stripling's well enough, but much too lean;</L>
<L>He'll be shortliv'd, he has his mother's cough,</L>
<L>A galloping consumption took her off.</L>
<L>Is this Sir Jacob's son? Old <HI>Toothless</HI> cries,</L>
<L>The boy is of a most alarming size:</L>
<L>Such o'ergrown monsters never can be strong;</L>
<L>Don't tell his father, but he can't live long.</L>
<L>So when the bard at first prepares his play,</L>
<L>His heart beats high, and all his prospects gay:</L>
<L>'Tis done, 'tis done, the enraptured poet cries,</L>
<L>The labour's over, I shall grasp the prize;</L>
<L><HI>Snarler,</HI> upon whose word I can depend;</L>
<L><HI>Snarler,</HI> shall see it, he's indeed a friend.</L>
<L>How do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou like my piece?—good critic say?</L>
<L>Nay do not flatter; don't you like the play?</L>
<L>Why yes, Sir,—eh—the thing is well enough;</L>
<L>Is it not good? Humph, yes—what cursed stuff!</L>
<L>I think, my friend, the play-house will be cramm'd!</L>
<L>I think so too—and think your play 'll be damn'd.</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>
At length the night, the aweful night ensues,</L>
<L>Fatal to many an offspring of the muse:</L>
<L>The father bids his fancy's child appear,</L>
<L>And hopes to meet no friendly snarler here;</L>
<L>Moral his boy, if entertaining too,</L>
<L>His fortune's fairly made when judg'd by you.</L>

<HEAD>ACT I. SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>A Back Room to a Printer's Office, CROTCHET with a Table before him in his Chair reading. THEO∣DOSIA enters from the Side.</STAGE>
<STAGE>CROTCHET, THEODOSIA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>NOBODY in the office? Nobody to tend the trade? Mr. Crotchet, what are you about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that a printer's business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but what can I do with my authors? No one else reads them, so I must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get a fresh set, and clear away your old hack∣nies; they are crippled, founder'd, work'd off their legs—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>And starv'd. Has <HI>Fulsome</HI> call'd with his de∣dication?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must the press stand still till that fellow's mud deposits? What did <HI>Slang</HI> want in the office?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Credit for a quire of foolscap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>You didn't give it him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who had been the fool then? Where's our Jacky?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Up all night, abed all morning; a whelp, a blockhead as he is. I thought to have made a great man of him, and educated him accordingly. I set him out in the world as printer's devil to one of the first presses in the capital.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a pretty devil he has been ever since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I then gave him a spell with our neighbour the rag-merchant, at next door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he learn there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he learn? the elements of his trade, the embryo of all good writing before it goes to the paper∣mill. He might have studied letters at the foundery itself, and the most valuable part of the chief libraries in the kingdom at the bookbinders: Nobody can say I baulk'd Jack in his education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why didn't you give him some grammar-school learning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>What good had that done him? Learning only cramps the genius, and grammar does but cripple the stile: Give me an author of a free clear mind. Why isn't he up in his cock-loft now with pen an ink? There's fresh air that would help his fancy. There he might court the muses and the graces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Instead of which he courts them in the streets to the music of the watchman's rattle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then that he makes some noise in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the way, husband, what is this new work of Fulsome's which you are printing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Treatise on Education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has that fellow any wit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has cunning, which is cousin-german to it. Fulsome was usher to a country school, he married the <HI>femme de chambre</HI> of a rich dowager, who took him into her family, and made him bear-leader to her booby son; he danc'd him a tour thro' Europe, and publish'd it in two quarto volumes at his return, pirated from the jour∣nals of other travellers, and stuffed with drawings of tem∣ples, bridges, aqueducts and amphitheatres, most of which he had never seen, and none of which he had ever examin'd: The book sold, and with the profits of that and a small pen∣sion Fulsome makes a shift to live.</P>

<STAGE>FULSOME, CROTCHET, THEODOSIA.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>I kiss your hands, worthy Mr. Crotchet; I pray you lay me at the feet of your amiable spouse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Compliments apart, let us to business.—Where's your Dedication of the Treatise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the hands of the Dedicatee, Mrs. or Miss Diana Grampus, I protest I know not by which title to address her, for she is a virgin in the bloom of half an hundred; vain, rich, pedantic, and not a little partial to your hum∣ble servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is this to our business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience, <HI>padrone mio!</HI> it is to your business: in the first place you must think a Dedication of this sort, where all the virtues, not to be found in her character, are to be hammer'd out of my brain, is no perfunctory job: in the next I must tell you, that I have an interest in Di Grampus, on which I mean to found a project for making the fortune of a friend of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meaning yourself, I suppose.</P>
<STAGE>(aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heroine has a nephew, the only son of Sir Toby Grampus, now coming to town for the purpose of putting this uneducated cub under her protection: I have recommended the tour of Italy, and the proposal takes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you're going to lead another bear round the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so, my travels are finished, and I have made over my interest to your son John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>My son! my son Jack a travelling tutor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not, Mr. Crotchet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I think his travels point to a quarter where few young gentlemen go for education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be discouraged; I hold it for an axiom, that every man is sit for every thing he can get. John is giddy to be sure, but with a few of my instructions he will pas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: He does not want address.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call it impudence, and you are right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theod.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, husband; he has no more impudence
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
than a man of fashion should have. I wish indeed he had the languages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that, perhaps, that wou'd be well if he had; but I hope it will be got over—a foreign lacquey must sup∣ply that defect: If he is ignorant of the living languages we must puff him the more for his knowledge of the dead ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dead ones indeed, and dead they will remain for ever, if they wait for his bringing them to life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, surely he had an university education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are laughing at me, methinks; you know well enough what education he has had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true, as you say, my zeal there went a lit∣tle too far, for I told Mrs. Diana he was a scholar of the first class at Cambridge, carried all the prizes, all the me∣dals; it was an error on the right side, for she believes it, and it is not our business to undeceive her: We must stand by what we have said. But where is he all this while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where he always is till noon; fast asleep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke his nap out. Send him to me as soon as he is drest: let him come to my lodgings; I'll give him his cue and carry him to Di Grampus, where I warrant you we will clinch the business. Good morning to you! I shall expect him about noon.</P>

<P>Jack Crotchet a travelling tutor! Was there ever such a chimera?</P>
</SP>

<P>Many such, and successful ones. Our Jack has a good deal of ready wit, knows the world, has no false modesty, and with good cloaths on his back is a personable fellow: Who is more likely to make his fortune among ladies of a certain cast?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, Theodosia, thou hast struck the only flint that has any fire in it. I begin to think better of the project than I did. Call him up, however; call him up: We can soon rig him out from the warehouse.</P>

<P>No, no, no, you wont; there'll be no duel, un∣less the gentleman, whose name is on the ticket, chuses to fight—always make free with a friend on those occasions.—Borrow'd this frock-suit—found the owner's ticket in the waistcoat pocket—carried it off with spirit—left the house with a high hand—foot slipt, tumbled over a fruit-woman—sav'd half-price, and pocketed three oranges in the scramble.</P>

<P>You don't believe!—Miss Laetitia Rayner, of the discreet age of eighteen, and heiress to a great fortune, does not believe that Captain Waterland. a young officer in the guards, and heir to no fortune at all, has any other motive for standing forth in her defence, but merely to shew his valor and protect the friend of Lady Jane Dan∣vers:—now then we are at issue—here is Miss Laetitia's opinion on one side, and her aunt's on the other.—Let the world decide between us!</P>

<P>Pardon me, madam, I never presume to oppose my opinion to your's.</P>

<P>Then if mine's to prevail, it will be that you ne∣ver again are seen of Lady Jane's party to a play; and that you never admit the visit of Captain Waterland in this house, or meet him in any other.</P>

<P>So! here is room indeed for amendment, bro∣ther: the Graces will have work enough on their hands

before they can mould this clay into courtesy. I am afraid my friend Robert is as mere a bumpkin as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I hope not,—I hope not. I have done my best for him; taken this long journey purposely to consult you how to proceed in his education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard he had any education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>His mother to be sure did keep him too much at home; but then t'was all repaid to us in his morals; there we gain'd every thing.</P>

<P>His morals, indeed! Take my word for it the morals of Monmouthshire won't keep long in the atmos∣phere of London.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, Bob, why so silent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I'm on the safe side for that, father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you are not the worse company for it at present, nephew Robert; when you come home from your travels, you will have something to tell us worth our hearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squire.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, most travellers have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have made it my business, brother, to seek out a proper Governor to accompany him on his tour: a learned person of my acquaintance, himself a travell'd man, has recommended a young gentleman of talents by the name of Crotchet: I have not seen him, but from his friend's report I augur well of his qualifications,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope to goodness he is not one of your prim pe∣dantic chaps, that are only fit to chop logic, and cap verses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the reverse; diametrically opposite to that character, he describes him to be gay, facetious, easy and well-bred; a man in short of the world, who rather strives to hide his learning, than make a parade of it: Mr. Ful∣some tells me that I should not find out in a twelvemonth's acquaintance with him, that he understood one word of Greek or Latin.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>The French horn, child! why do you ask that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squire.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because father says I am to go up the river Nile, and the French horn sounds well upon a water party.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>The river Nile indeed! The river Tiber will be the boundary of your peregrinations: in Rome you will contemplate the venerable remains of antient magnificence; there you will tread on classic ground, and repose yourself on the bosoms of the arts and the muses.</P>

<P>Look, father, look! that fellow's back is made of whalebone: Shall I ever make such a bow as my tutor does? not I to the Pope of Rome himself. Egad, he must lift up his toe pretty high, if I am to kiss it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand your delicacy, Mr. Crotchet. By referring me to your friend you avoid self flattery: it im∣presses me in your tavor.—I love humility.</P>

<P>I persuade myself you do, and let me hope you will permit humility at all due distance to love you.</P>

<P>Permit me to ask which of the Roman poets is your favorite?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the vengeance.—Which of the Roman poets do I prefer? really there are so many of them that I am rather puzzled to say which is best, but I think, take him for all in all, Elzevir is the fairest type.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Elzevir! I apprehend he was no poet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam, but he was a printer of the poets, and my friend thought you was enquiring which edition he prefers. Horace I know is his poet: he and I have many amicable disputes about our respective favorites, Horace and Virgil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, but we won't dispute about them now.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squire.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think it does her any good, father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a slight acquaintance with the Latin tongue; Mr. Crotchet will greatly oblige me if he will repeat an ode of Horace—any one you like best, Sir, they are equal to me; I have no preference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I, Heaven knows! Fulsome, help me off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now Crotchet, I stand a fair chance of my pe∣nalty, and if you spout one line of Latin in this lady's com∣pany, before Heaven I'll exact it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by that, may I ask?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ful.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only that he is bound to me, Madam, in the pe∣nalty of an hundred pounds if he talks Latin in the ladies company. 'T was a trick he had when he came fresh from college, and so to break him of it altogether, I laid him under this forfeiture: Now as I think he can hardly resist your commands, I stand fair for my hundred pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>On no account will I permit it: I withdraw the Ode of Horace, and think that if there was a trace of pedantry in your friend's character, you cou'd not take a better method for curing a bad habit. And now, Mr. Crotchet, let me introduce you to Sir Toby Grampus and my nephew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Learned Sir, I'm your very humble servant. I un∣derstand you are of an ancient house in Cornwall; I respect antiquity of family: The Grampus's are not mushrooms,

What shou'd I make of all that frippery in the country? every hedge stake would have a pluck at it: No, no; I must have a tight truss'd thing, brac'd like a pudding∣bag; a kind of road-tit, that can go over rough ground; those galloping fetlocks of your's wou'd hang cruelly in the soil; mercy on me, you'd be pull'd all to pieces, and done up in one season.</P>

<P>This it is; if I augur rightly, you will not long have any occasion to bring your foils with you when you visit in this family, if I am not cross'd in my endeavours, a certain gentleman, who sent his card of compliments not long ago, will very soon be permitted to make his visit in person.

<P>Well, Harry, what success with your fen∣cing-master?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Beyond my hopes:—I fenc'd my way into the house; parried all difficulties, disarm'd aunt Di; laid the Box-lobby champion at my feet, and I flatter myself plac'd a gentle hit or two on the soft heart of my lovely Laetitia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will if I can, for in faith it will be a prize worth fighting for; I am all over wounds from head to heart, tho' she has only play'd her small artillery on me yet.

<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Jane.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whose fault was that, Harry, your's or mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I scorn to make gentlemen jealous; it ruins the complexion; gives them a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d sorder in their eyes, and takes away the use of their limbs. I have seen very bad effects from it:—A friend of mine was so totally crippled by a fit of jealousy, that he cou'd not rise from his seat if the room had been in flames.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll venture to say he was most thoroughly in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Jane.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And probably with some good-for-nothing jilt, who was not worth the pains that he bestowed upon her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should the fault be her's? The man perhaps thought humbly of himself, and trembled at the chance of her discovering superior merit in a rival. Now if you had such a lover as this, Lady Jane, could you be very angry with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Jane.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Outrageously, and I would torment him most deliciously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cou'd you find in your heart to do that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Jane.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, I have no mercy upon jealousy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how wou'd you set about punishing him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Jane.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I wou'd lay out for some such idle stray fellow as Harry here for instance, whom no woman in her senses can be serious about; and none but such a chit as Laetitia cou'd be taken in by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you hear her, brother George, do you hear her? If this does not prove that I am uppermost in her thoughts, what can prove it? And why does she abuse poor dear Laetitia, but because she can't endure to see me like any body but herself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>How come you then to trust your cause to an advocate so suspicious? Had'nt you better employ me, who am certainly interested to dispose of you? Send me to the lady of your heart, and let me plead in your behalf.</P>

<P>Oh yes, I have an admirable master; he takes great pains with me.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Jane.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is, indeed, one of the <HI>firme,</HI> as the traders call it, whom I have had some transactions with, and find him a fai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-dealing honest man: There is good property in the partnership, and I fancy you may trust the house: But what says your aunt to it? I rather suspect she wishes you to give your custom to her nephew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laetitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so, but his stock is small, and of a fashion that does not suit my taste; I am releas'd from that engagement, and she won't over-rule me in any other.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I only come to fall before your feet, and beg for life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laetitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, rise, if you expect me to converse with you; I'll not listen to any thing you say upon your knees. If Lady Jane is always to keep you in her cabinet ready to sally forth, and fasten on a harmless creature, who is de∣coyed into her snare, have you the conscience to expect I will humour your vanity by repeating these visits? espe∣cially when my aunt has taken off the interdict, and opens her doors to Captain Waterland in common with every other man of fashion, who has a claim to visit her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And may I visit her?</P>

<SP>

<P>I was excluded personally; what can have softened her hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laetitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love, mollifying love. Our playhouse quarrel has been productive of wonderful events; one party is on the point of carrying off the aunt, and I dare say you think the other is in no bad train for carrying off the niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! how very far am I from such pre∣sumptuous hopes, when all I sue for is not to be con∣demned to absolute despair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laetitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor man! you have an advocate in Lady Jane; go to her, tell her how little she consults your in∣terest by her absence; confess how very ill you manage your own cause, and how totally you despair of ever soften∣ing my hard heart without her help.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not whilst that lovely smile encourages my hope will I resort to any advocate for help: With nothing else to recommend me but a heart and soul devoted to
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
you I throw myself upon your generosity without appeal, and by your sentence I will stand or fall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laetitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I'm not in the humour to pass sentence upon you just now; therefore we'll break up the court and go to Lady Jane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Will you be gone so soon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laetitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, since now there are no obstructions to our meeting; and if I was not sincere enough to own how welcome you will be to me, you wou'd be too saga∣cious not to discover that I play'd the hypocrite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am blest indeed: That confession has inspir'd me with such transports, that I dare not give them utterance, yet know not how to suppress them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laetitia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll teach you what to do with them—When a subject is too interesting, I drive it from my thoughts; when a lover is too agreeable, I run away from him—follow my example—but hold, hold!—Don't run the same way.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>My word indeed might well have pass'd 'twixt you and me, but when relations, who are interested to keep me single, beset me with their importunity, this deed will be my answer. The obligation there to marry you
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
under the penalty of ten thousand pounds, will silence all opposers, and when they see, that with your free consent I've made my nephew Robert heir to all my property, one poor annuity excepted of four hundred pounds a year to you at my decease, what can they do but own your con∣duct truly generous and disinterested?</P>

Never trust me if I coud'nt have tugg'd that Fulsome by the ears, for the spiteful pains the thief took to put you out of favour with her: but keep a good heart, my brave fellow; and remember when I have said the word, I have said it: I have given you my hand once, and here it is again: I am your friend,—blow hot, blow cold, I never budge; one and the same for ever, that's my mark.</P>

<P>Squire Robert, you are a man after my own heart. I were a dog if I could look you in the face after this kindness, had I not proof positive in my pocket that I struck no bargain with your aunt till she had settled her whole fortune upon you by the same article that she bound herself to marry me. There's a penalty of ten thousand pounds if she does not fulfil conditions; but if she flouts <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e because I am Jack Crotchet the printer's son, damme if I wou'd not be set in the pillory as my father was before me, rather than be tied up for life to a hyaena like her.</P>

<P>I beg your pardon—a transgresson of the truth; a slip of memory; a trick of the traveller. Squire, let me present you to Mr. Fulsome, an author of high renown; this is the worthy gentleman, who told your aunt I was descended from an antient noble family, educated at the University, and deeply read in Greek and Latin: when all the world knows I am the son of a pillory printer, educated no where, and having learnt nothing:—if this gentleman is not a liar, who the deuce is?</P>

<P>Your humble servant, learned Sir, your very humble servant!—I found a certain printer in an obscure dirty lane, who writes John Crotchet on his shop-board, and boasts himself to be your honor'd father: I ask'd to be favor'd with a sight of his illustrious pedigree from the antient Saxons of the heptarchy, but he declar'd it was not in his power to furnish me with any lights into the records of his family farther than as he verily believ'd he had a father and mother, but even that, he said, was mat∣ter of faith, and not of certainty.</P>
</SP>

<P>Sir Toby Grampus, we that cannot count up our generations have oftentimes the sense to outwit you, whose ancestors hang by the wall from Hildebrand, the great Grampus in King Arthur's day, down to little Toby the sprat, in good King George's, God bless him! One of your forefathers perhaps cou'd eat a whole venison pasty for his breakfast; another cou'd bend a kitchen-poker across his arm, a third might keep hawks and greyhounds; what are they but a catalogue of insignificants? One printer, one compositor, one poor corrector of the press, is worth them all, and his country gains more credit by his labors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Fore George, my friend, I'm not sure but you are in the right of it; I know little of my forefathers, but that that they liv'd on the same spot for many generations, and left me a fair estate to follow the same practice—Sir, I begin to perceive you are a very clever fellow, and if sister Di is of the same opinion, I believe a little printer's ink mixt with our blood wou'd do the family no harm.</P>

<P>We are too good to them by half; kindness does but spoil them. Oh! that I had studied the dear art of tormenting in good time.</P>

<P>Upon my life, George, these ladies do not do us justice, threat'ning us with the torture, when we have both behaved to admiration: Considering how much they have bless'd us, we ought at this moment to be grate∣fully out of our senses.</P>
</SP>

<P>For my part I disclaim all responsibility, for I move but as the mistress of my soul directs; in her hand are all those springs, that give it joy or sorrow, health or sickness, life or death.</P>

<P>As sisters, lovely Laetitia—do you mark that?</P>

<P>Certainly; I mark nothing else: The honor of calling Lady Jane my sister will be a consolation under all my sufferings. But first let me have a specimen of your dutiful behaviour to your aunt Di—I take upon me to in∣vite

<P>Was ever woman so perplex'd, distracted and distrest? I cannot state a reason for rejecting this young man, but one starts up to reconcile me to him: no sooner do I lean to mercy, but my pride cries out for vengeance; if love pleads to marry him, prudence whispers me to let it alone: well, well, but what signifies her whisper, when love has all the talk to himself? I'll fairly put the pro's and con's for the last time, and let the strongest carry it.—He's a beggar: granted; that I knew from the first:—he's a low-born tellow, that I did not know, and that's a staggering circumstance—but who's to find it out? He's airy, gay, genteel, well-drest: what has the world to do with pedigrees?—He's ignorant, unlearn'd, uneducated—be it so! He's not pedantic, therefore not conceited, crabbed, a mere book-worm; won't dispute authorities with me, nor wrangle in theology and metaphysics, where the walk will be my own. He is, he is—hush, in short he is here, and all objections vanish.</P>

<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, be pleased to answer to a few plain questions:—you came into this familv recommended to me as a gentleman every way qualified to direct the education of my nephew: I receiv'd you, approv'd of you, was pleased with you; your manners, your appearance, your address engag'd me; my partiality for you went great lengths; regarding you as the descendant of a noble family, I pitied you, nay more, with blushes I confess I lov'd you. Are you the well-born gentleman, that I was taught to believe you?</P>

<P>I am not.</P>

<P>None: you took that on the word of Fulsome; let him appear and answer for himself.</P>
</SP>

<P>He'll hardly do that; I kick'd him out of the house this morning.</P>

<P>She told you so; I have been in search of her, but cannot find her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crotch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know how you shou'd; for she has run off with that scoundrel Fulsome, both in my debt: It is not a first time I have suffer'd by that fellow: It is a printer's honour not to give up his principal, the rascal was the author of a libel, for which I stood the pelting.</P>

<P>Oh that I had known it! I wou'd have given him t'other kick for that.</P>

<P>Now, madam, you have pretty nearly the sum total of my crimes: If every man was sifted so minutely, few wou'd escape u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>censur'd.

<P>A very noble action let me tell you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Wat.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Heavens! I must embrace this man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suffer'd you to force a bond upon me, by which you guarantee'd your marriage on the penalty of ten thou∣sand pounds. I did not think you likely to incur the for∣feiture, and therefore disregarded the amount: Now, Ma∣dam, though I am not worth a doit, I have a spirit, that

<L>IN days of yore, when Knights were cas'd in mail,</L>
