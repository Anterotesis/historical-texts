<HEAD>PLAN OF THE PRESENT STATE of ALL NATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IN this frivolous age, when the powers of the understanding are all unbraced by idleness, and the mind (as it were) overborne by tides of vanity and dissipation, it requires some address to reclaim the at∣tention to subjects of real utility, and to render the voice of instruction agreeable to the votaries of pleasure: for to exercise the faculties of reason, and amuse the imagi∣nation at the same time, is the quintessence of that happy talent which distinguishes the works of genius from the dull efforts of inanimated learning.</P>
<P>One great step towards the accomplish∣ment of this laudable aim of mingling en∣tertainment with instruction, is the judici∣ous choice of a subject: then follows the arrangement of the matter; and all the
<PB N="4" REF="40"/>
rest depends upon the art of conveying ideas agreeably; an art, which may be truly stiled the gift of heaven; inasmuch as it never yet was acquired by dint of meer industry and application.</P>
<P>The subject we propose to exhibit to the Public, is in itself so important, copious, and interesting, that it cannot fail to attract the notice of all those who are desirous of improvement, entertained with novelty, or pleased with the study of human nature.</P>
<P>Indeed it is no other than a general view of Nature in all her amazing varieties dis∣played through the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms; including every diffe∣rent system of society, and specifying every invention of art for the support and enjoy∣ment of life.</P>
<P>Here the naturalist will find an infinity of food for philosophy and contemplation. The politician may choose modes of go∣vernment, and adopt hints of legislation; and those who employ their talents in the useful arts, will acquire distinct ideas of all the improvements which have been made by ingenuity assisted by experience.
<PB N="5" REF="50"/>
Finally, those who have nothing in view but amusement, will here find a thousand particulars to gratify the most eager and capricious curiosity.</P>
<P>The advances which mankind are daily making in useful knowledge, and the de∣tached labours of the ingenious, added, from time to time, to the general stock of improve∣ment, enable us to present the Public with a work more complete and comprehensive than any production of the same nature which hath hitherto appeared: in the exe∣cution of which it hath been our particu∣lar care to study perspicuity and precision; to retrench superfluities; and to avoid those dry discussions which are so apt to give dis∣gust, discouraging the timorous inquirer on the very threshold of science.</P>
<P>In methodizing the subject, it was judged proper to digest it into separate articles, ranged under certain heads or titles, which not only direct the view, and assist the com∣prehension, but also serve as pauses of re∣pose to the eye and the attention.</P>
<P>Thus, for example, in discussing the ar∣ticle of <HI>England:</HI> Under the first head, its
<PB N="6" REF="60"/>
<HI>Geography</HI> is ascertained: its <HI>Situation, Ex∣tent,</HI> and <HI>Boundaries.</HI> The second contains a description of <HI>the Face of the Country, its Mountains, Forests, Lakes, Rivers,</HI> and <HI>Wa∣ters.</HI> The third takes cognizance of <HI>the Air and Climate.</HI> The fourth explains <HI>the Na∣ture of the Soil, and its Productions, Mine∣ral, Vegetable,</HI> and <HI>Animal.</HI> The fifth in∣vestigates its <HI>Constitution, Government,</HI> and <HI>Laws.</HI> The sixth gives an analysis of its <HI>Religion,</HI> branched out into various <HI>Sects</HI> and <HI>Societies.</HI> The seventh is engrossed by the <HI>King, his Prerogative, Dignity,</HI> and <HI>Impor∣tance.</HI> The next particularizes <HI>the great Officers of the Crown.</HI> The three following are employed upon the <HI>Nobility, Knights, Esquires,</HI> and <HI>Yeomen;</HI> and <HI>certain Customs respecting the Women and Children of England.</HI> The twelfth treats of the <HI>People, their Per∣sons, Attire, Disposition,</HI> and <HI>Manners.</HI> The thirteenth is allotted for <HI>their Amusements</HI> and <HI>Diversions.</HI> The fourteenth describes <HI>their Habitations,</HI> and <HI>Manner of Living.</HI> Separate sections are also bestowed upon the <HI>Diseases of the Country; the State of Learning; the liberal Arts, including Poetry,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="70"/>
<HI>Musick, Painting, Sculpture,</HI> and <HI>Architec∣ture; Societies for propagating Knowledge; Commerce in all its Branches; Duties, Taxes, Public-Debts, Funds,</HI> and <HI>Money.</HI> In a word, every particular which the mind can be sup∣posed to contemplate as a distinct object, is here referred to its proper class; and we flatter ourselves that nothing material is omitted which could contribute to the rea∣der's entertainment or information.</P>
<P>We begin with the <HI>Polar Regions,</HI> from whence we advance towards <HI>the Equator,</HI> describing each country in its turn, accord∣ing to its situation in the general map; a method which indeed order and regularity seem naturally to suggest.</P>
<P>Setting out from the pole, we touch at the extremity of the land, and visit the islands on every side, in a regular progres∣sion, without leaving any thing behind for a retrospective view, which might be at∣tended with omissions, and, at best, would occasion a desultory and irregular inquiry. According to this disposition, the first ob∣jects that occur, are the rude stupendous scenes of uncultivated nature, equally sim∣ple
<PB N="8" REF="80"/>
and sublime; of consequence the best adapted to strike the imagination of the reader, and engage the unpractised atten∣tion, which must be powerfully sollicited, and gradually allured into the paths of knowledge, by a succession of ideas, from the simplest impressions of sense and fancy to the most abstract efforts of reason and reflection.</P>
<P>As we do not desire that the curious and astonishing particulars specified in the course of this work, should rest intirely on our own credit, we have, at the end of each ar∣ticle, subjoined a list of the authorities from which they are compiled; so that the sceptical reader may occasionally have re∣course to the fountain-head of intelligence, and decide for himself how far we have act∣ed our part with candour, accuracy, and judgment.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SPITZBERGEN.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Its SITUATION. BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>IN taking a view of the terraqueous globe, from the North Pole, the first land that meets the eye is the country of Spitzbergen, or Greenland, extending from the seventy-sixth to the eighty-second degree of north latitude. The name of Greenland was bestowed upon it by Sir Hugh Willoughby, who discovered it in the year 1553, and supposed it to be a continuation of old Groenland: but it derived the name of Spitzbergen, or Sharp Mountains, from William Barentz and John Cor∣nelius, two Dutch men, who pretended to have discovered this country in the year 1595; and alledged, that the coast which Sir Hugh Wil∣loughby visited was another country, which the Hollanders accordingly have set down in their maps and charts under the name of Willoughby Land; whereas, in fact, no such land ever existed.
<PB N="2" REF="100"/>
But, long before the voyage of those Dutch ad∣venturers, Stephen Barrows, an English shipmaster, failed to the seventy-eighth degree of latitude, and coasted along a desolate country covered with blue ice, and abounding with water-fowl, as far as the latitude of eighty degrees eleven minutes. This was undoubtedly Spitzbergen, which exhibits a very wild and rugged appearance of sharp, icy rocks, piled one upon another. Whether this be a continent or an island, is not yet discovered; nor how far it extends to the northward. Some navi∣gators have conjectured, that it joins to Nova Zembla on the south-east; while others believe, that between them there is a passage into the Tar∣tarean sea. On the other hand, it has been ima∣gined, that Spitzbergen on the west is contiguous to Groenland: this, however, is not a very probable conjecture. On the west side of Spitzbergen we find Charles Island, divided from the main land by a narrow streight, called Foreland Ford: between this place and Muscle Haven appear the highest mountains of Spitzbergen: these are chiefly of a red colour, and reflect the sun-beams so as to seem all on fire. There are seven, however, of a fine sky-blue tinct, that shoot up with spiral points re∣markably sharp and conical. The most commo∣dious place on the island is South Haven, so large as to admit forty sail of ships, securely riding at anchor: here the leaks and other damages may be conveniently repaired, and the whole fleet be sup∣plied with fresh water from the melting of the snows. This harbour is surrounded by high mountains, and in the middle of it lies Deadman's Island, so denominated, because here were buried the bodies of the seamen and fishers who died in the voyage. The coast in this neighbourhood is also studded with several little isles, known by the name of Fowl Islands, from the vast numbers of
<PB N="3" REF="110"/>
sea-birds hatched upon them. The next large harbour has acquired the name of Maurice Bay, from the Dutch mariners, some of whom have wintered in this place. Here they have built a few huts for the convenience of making oil, and these they call Smearburg, or the Haerlem Cookery. There is likewise a north bay, in which we find an island which the Hollanders call Vogelsang, from the great noise made by the water-fowl in their flight. The other known harbours of Spitzbergen are Deer Sound and Muscle Haven.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The cold at Spitzbergen, even in the summer, is intense; but in the winter altogether intolerable: it is most rigorous when the wind blows from the north or east; but south and west winds bring snow and rain, by which it is moderated. In the months of June, July, and August, the weather is usually calm, particularly in July, when the sun shines so hot as to melt the tar between the seams of the ship: this, however, is not the case except in a dead calm; for the wind, even at this season, blows incredibly cold, and the frost continues with∣out intermission. The sea-water is not so salt here as in more southerly latitudes, and is observed to change its colour with the sky. In a clear air the sea is blue: when the atmosphere is overcast with clouds, the water appears green: in fogs it is yel∣low; and quite black in stormy weather. When the air is serene, the ocean is so transparent, that one may see to the depth of twelve or fourteen fathom.</P>
<P>In this country the sun appears about the middle of February, and disappears about the first of Oc∣tober. From the beginning of May to the first of August, he continues above the horizon without setting: then the night and day are distinguished
<PB N="4" REF="120"/>
by his appearing in the west, or in the eastern part of the heavens.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The face of Spitzbergen exhibits nothing but rugged rocks and bare mountains, whose tops are lost among the clouds; or narrow valleys, choaked up with stones and ice, that tumble from these mountains. There is, indeed, some low land about Deer Sound and Muscle Haven, generally covered with snow; which, in some summers, dissolving, discovers a barren coat of heath and moss, inter∣spersed with a few plants: this is likewise the case with the sides of some mountains exposed to the reflection of the sun.</P>
<P>The rivers of this country, so far as they have been discovered, are all brackish; and no springs have yet been found: but this inconvenience is remedied by the great plenty of snow-water, which is found to be both agreeable and salubrious.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRODUCTIONS: VEGETABLES and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>The dung of those birds which inhabit the clifts of the rocks, being, together with the moss, washed down by the melted snow, forms a rich mould in some level places near the shore. These produce a variety of plants; among which we number excellent scurvy-grass, a kind of wild let∣tuce, sorrel, snake-root, mouse-ear, ground-ivy, lime-wort, heart's-ease, sea-bugloss, wild straw∣berries, house-leek, and wall-pepper. These are considered as effectual remedies, supplied by the hand of Providence, for the cure of the scurvy, and other diseases, incident to the adventurers who yearly visit this inhospitable country. The scurvy∣grass here, as in many other northern climates, has no pungency to the taste; but is mild and esculent, grateful to the palate, and such an excellent anti∣scorbutic,
<PB N="5" REF="130"/>
that the seamen term it <HI>the gift of God.</HI> Although the ships employed in the whale-fishery are, of all others, the best supplied with good pro∣vision and plenty of fresh water; yet the mariners are, in these northern latitudes, much more subject to the sea-scurvy than in any southern voyage. The attack of the malady is here more sudden, and the progress of it more rapid. The patient feels his symptoms increase as he advances nearer the Pole; nor does he enjoy the least alleviation, until the weather softens in the month of July, which is very moderate, and indeed the only interruption of winter. Then the scurvy-grass appears in plenty, as an infallible cure, and performs wonders; re∣storing in a few days, to health and vigour, those who were seemingly in the last and mortal stage of the distemper. Spitzbergen likewise produces dande∣lion, saxifrage, mountain-heath, poppies, hellebore, and dwarf-willow, with many other plants, found likewise in Scotland and Wales, as well as some non∣descripts; but all of them are small and stunted, the natural consequence of a scanty soil and inclement sky. Corn, kitchen-herbs, and fruit-trees, have never been sown or planted in this soil; nor would the experiment succeed in such a rigorous climate.</P>
<P>From the nature of the rocks, which have been split by frost, and tumbled down in fragments, hard, ponderous, and sparry, naturalists have con∣jectured that Spitzbergen abounds with iron: nor is this desolate country destitute of more valuable metals. About the year 1737, Mr. Cracraft, a well-known commander in the Greenland trade, brought to England several pieces of gold ore, which he found accidentally in a hunting excur∣sion, among the rocks of Spitzbergen. In conse∣quence of this discovery, and the large proportion of metal found in assaying the ore, he next year provided himself with tools and implements for
<PB N="6" REF="140"/>
digging and working: but this avocation inter∣fering with the fishery, which was the principal aim of his voyage, and some other difficulties arising, the discovery was not prosecuted with that vigour which its importance seemed to require. Here we likewise find some <HI>lapis spicularis,</HI> ala∣baster, and selenites.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The native animals of Spitzbergen are bears, deer, foxes, seals, and sea-horses. The bears have long snouts, and bark like dogs that are hoarse. They are all white, lean, swift, extremely fierce, and incredibly large. One bear has been found six feet high, fourteen feet long, and yielded one hundred weight of fat. The largest are called water-bears, because they live upon what the sea affords, and have been seen fourteen miles from shore. When a bear is attacked, and begins to roar, his fellows run to his assistance; and the dam will suffer herself to be killed, rather than abandon her cubs: nevertheless, when a bear is found dead by his fellows, they eat him without scruple. They are commonly killed with muskets and lances; yet so very tenacious of life, that a bear has often made his escape with several shots in his body. These creatures are so stimulated with hunger, that they frequently attack whole armed crews: nay, they have been known to take the water, and endea∣vour to board large vessels. When the bear is at bay, he rises on his hind legs, and often breaks in pieces the lances of his assailants; so that he is not attacked without imminent danger. He lives upon seals and dead whales, in quest of which he is sometimes seen thirty leagues at sea, on floats of ice. He takes the water naturally, and, when attacked, will dive like an otter.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="150"/>
The deer of Greenland, or Spitzbergen, are large, grey, and shaggy, with long ears, short tails, and branching horns. By feeding on the yellow moss in the summer, they grow exceeding fat; and their flesh, when roasted, is of an exquisite flavour. This store of fat enables them to subsist in the winter; during which, however, many are starved, and all of them are exceedingly meagre in the spring <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In all probability these ani∣mals sleep in caverns during the winter, like the bears in Norway: perhaps the abun∣dance of poppies in this coun∣try may dispose them to a le∣thargy, which seems necessary for their preservation; as little or no nourishment is required for animals that have no exer∣cise, and a languid circula∣tion.</NOTE>. They fly at sight of a human crea∣ture; but stop when he stops, and thus are shot without difficulty. Here are many foxes of va∣rious colours, black, grey, and white; and prodi∣gious numbers of seals and sea-horses, which we shall have occasion to describe in the sequel. Of land-birds, few are to be seen in Greenland; ex∣cept the partridge, which resembles our growse, and some small birds, that sometimes are heard to warble sweetly, even in this dreary climate: but of water-fowl innumerable swarms, such as are common to all the northern countries of Europe, and will be particularly described in our accounts of Iceland, Norway, and the Hebrides.</P>
<P>The produce of the sea in these parts deserves particular attention, as this alone has induced the more southern nations to send annual fleets to the bleak coast of Spitzbergen. The northern sea is the native country of the whale, which is justly deemed the most important fish that swims, whe∣ther we consider its enormous size, or the profits it yields to the fisherman in the articles of oil and whalebone: over and above these advan∣tages accruing to society from the whale-fishery, it
<PB N="8" REF="160"/>
employs and maintains a great number of people, and breeds the best and hardiest seamen that be∣long to the community.</P>
<P>Of the whale species there are many different kinds, known by various denominations, and ap∣pearing of very different sizes and configurations. The Spitzbergen whale, which is the largest and most valuable, generally extends to the length of sixty feet; though some are found more than twice as long. The true whale of sixty feet is commonly about forty feet in circumference at the shoulders, from whence he tapers to the tail, which is forked and horizontal. He is distin∣guished from the other kinds by his want of teeth; instead of which he is supplied with that substance called the whale-bone, growing on each side of his upper jaw, in four or five hundred blades, dis∣posed at equal distances: some of these exceed twelve feet in length, and are one foot broad at bottom, from whence they grow narrower up∣wards, like the sticks of a fan inverted: the largest of them weighs about twenty pounds each. The opening between these blades is contracted when he shuts, and dilated when he opens his mouth; and serves to strain the water from the shrimps, prawns, and other small insects on which the whale is supposed chiefly to subsist: but a percolation still more fine is performed by a quantity of hair, adhering to the inside of the jaw, next the tongue. His throat is very small, in proportion to his bulk; as are likewise his eyes, which measure each about six inches over, provided with eyelids and lashes, like those of a human creature. His bones are hard, porous, and full of marrow: his back and belly are of a duskish red colour: his flesh is coarse, hard, lean, dry, and sinewy: the fat or blubber is contained in a cellular membrane, immediately under the skin. A great number of strong ten∣dons
<PB N="9" REF="170"/>
are united at the tail, with which he turns and winds himself, as a ship is guided by the rud∣der. Besides the skin, he is covered with a sort of cuticle, or scarf-skin, which is very thin and ten∣der. The whale swims with surprising celerity, and plows the sea like a ship under sail. He is very subject to be tormented by a species of lice, that bite so severely as to make him flounce and flounder, and even spring above the surface of the ocean: he is likewise supposed to feel cramps, and uneasy sensations in his body, on a sudden change of weather, as he generally tumbles about with great agitation immediately before a storm. But, notwithstanding his strength, he is remarkably timorous, and very easily mastered. An ordinary whale yields from seventy to an hundred barrels of blubber, which is the fat contained in vesicles im∣mediately under the skin.</P>
<P>A description of the method practised in killing and catching whales, will not be disagreeable to the reader. A whale is no sooner perceived spouting the water from the two spout-holes, that open on his neck, than every ship's long-boat is hoisted out, and manned with six or seven seamen, who row directly towards the fish; which when they approach, the har∣pooner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the harpoon is used in this manner, the boat is row∣ed full upon the whale's back, and the instrument is thrust in by the weight of the harpoon∣er's body; but now it is cus∣tomary to shoot the harpoon from a musquetoon, at some distance from the whale: a me∣thod much more effectual than the other.</NOTE> standing in the bow of the boat, strikes him with his harpoon. This is a kind of a lance, headed with iron, in the manner of an arrow, and fastened to a line of great length. The bones of the head are extremely hard; but near the spout-holes there is a mass of muscular flesh, which the harpoon penetrates to a great depth. The whale being struck, flies through the water with such celerity,
<PB N="10" REF="180"/>
that, were he not indulged with a scope of line, he would inevitably sink the boat. The fishermen, therefore, are very careful in having the rope un∣intangled, and water it as it runs, otherwise it would fire the boat. The first six or seven fathom are made of the finest and softest hemp, that it may run the more easily; and this portion they call the fore-runner: but the length of the whole line extends to ninety or an hundred fathoms. When the harpoon takes place, the boat follows the line; and the other long-boats row on before, to observe which way it turns, that the whale's track may be the more easily discovered. They sometimes feel the line, and, if there is a strong resistance, they conclude that the whale's strength is not yet abated: but, when it floats loose upon the water, they know he is either weak or dead, and take it in gently with caution, so as that it may be ready for him, in case he should recover, and pull again. Even in the vigour of his career, they are careful in keeping the line tight; for, when they indulge him with a superfluity, it is sometimes intangled about a rock, and the whale, by continuing to pull, disengages the harpoon. As soon as he begins to spout blood, they know he is near his end, and prepare for the operation of cutting him in pieces. A lean whale sinks when dead, and does not float again for several days, until the juices, putrefying and fermenting, distend the vessels, and increase the volume of the body, so that it becomes specifically lighter than the sea∣water. Soon as the whale expires he begins to stink; and the putrid steams that rise from his body are so acrid, as to inflame the eyes of the fishermen. When the carcase begins to float, it is hauled close to the stern of the ship, and the men begin to cut it into slices with great knives. These large flakes, containing the blubber, being hoisted
<PB N="11" REF="190"/>
on board, are strung upon ropes, and hauled on shore; where they are again chopped into smaller pieces, on a block made of the whale's tail. These being again subdivided into portions no larger than a trencher, are thrown into coppers, fixed for the purpose: and in these the oil is melted from the cells. The membranous parts, beginning to look brown, acquire the name of fritters, and are thrown away, because this appearance declares that they are wholly deprived of the oil; which is now laded out of the coppers into a boat half filled with water, in which it is cooled and cleansed: from hence it is conveyed through long troughs into hogsheads, or barrels, ranged upon the shore. The whale's head being cut off, and carried on shore, the fishermen extract the whalebone, which they tie up in fillets; and then the rest of the head is boiled for the benefit of the oil. The tongue of an ordinary whale is as large as an woolpack, and will yield six hogsheads of oil: it is drawn ashore, cut up, and boiled in the same manner practised upon the other parts that contain the blubber. Such was the antient way of procuring the oil on the spot: but now the blubber is bar∣relled up in small pieces, and brought over to England or Holland to be boiled at leisure. The huts on Spitzbergen are quite neglected; and many ships return from the whale-fishing without ever having been in sight of that country. They sail to a certain latitude frequented by the whales, and fish at sea, without being molested by a lee∣shore, ice, or currents.</P>
<P>Ships employed in the whale-fishery ought to be very large, remarkably strong, to sustain shocks from the floating ice, and manned each with thirty or forty bold hardy mariners. Every ship ought to be provided with five or six stout boats, well supplied with healthy provisions, plenty of spirits,
<PB N="12" REF="200"/>
a great number of lances, harpoons, and fish-gigs, and at least thirty lines of an hundred fathoms in length. In this latitude the adventures often meet with another species of the whale, which they denominate the fin-fish. This animal is as long, but not half so thick as the other whale: yet he blows the water higher, and from this cir∣cumstance has acquired the name of Trumpeter. His lips are twisted like a cable, and the whale∣bone hangs from his upper lip. In colour he re∣sembles the teneh, is extremely nimble, and so strong, that the fishermen dare not strike him near the edge of the ice, lest, by a sudden jerk with his tail, he should pull them and the boat under it. These fish, however, do not appear until the other whales have quitted the coast. Here likewise they find in plenty the whale-rush, morse, or sea-horse, resembling the seal in shape, but as large as an ox. The head is thick, round, and compact: the neck is covered with a thick skin and short hair: on the rest of the body the skin is thicker, and the hair longer. In the upper jaw are two tusks, about six and twenty inches long, which are equal, in whiteness and polish, to the teeth of the elephant. This creature feeds upon herbs and fish, and is amphibious. They are often seen in multitudes lying on the rocks, and basking in the sun. The morse is a bold and fierce animal: when attacked, he turns upon the boat; and sometimes strikes his teeth through the sides of it, or endeavours to leap on board. He is not easily killed either with shot or blows, and therefore the seamen commonly dis∣patch him with lances. When whales are scarce, the adventures make up their voyage with the teeth and oil of this animal. Of the whale kind there are also the dragon-fish, long, thin, grey, and glittering, with two fins on his back, and two holes, through which he spouts the water; the
<PB N="13" REF="210"/>
Butshorf, or lace-head, sixteen feet long, with a spout-hole in his neck, a brown back, and a white belly; and the white-fish, as long as the butshorf, but much fatter: the sea-unicorn, from sixteen to twenty feet in length, with a spout-hole in his neck, and projecting from his snout a fine wreathed horn, for which he is chiefly valued. The throne of his Danish majesty is entirely composed of these horns, which were formerly deemed specificks against poison. All these fish swim against the wind, and are observed to tumble immediately before storms; a circumstance from which some naturalists have concluded, that from the change in the atmosphere they were seized with the cramp in their bellies. The whale is harrassed by a va∣riety of enemies. Besides the vermin that adhere to his body like lice, he is pursued by the saw-fish, or sword-fish, some of which species are twenty feet long: he is shaped like a man's arm, and his eyes are very prominent: his sword projects from his snout, of different lengths, according to the different sizes of the fish; sometimes smooth and sharp, like a real sword; sometimes indented like a saw: hence the creature is called either sword-fish or saw-fish. A very few of these ani∣mals will attack and master a great whale; yet, when they have slain him, they eat no part of him but the tongue. In calm weather the fishermen lie upon their oars as spectators of this combat, until they perceive the whale at the last gasp: then they row towards him, and his enemies retiring at their approach, they enjoy the fruits of the victory. There is another more desperate enemy of the whale, known by the name of hay, a kind of shark, of different sizes, from one to three fathoms; so vo∣racious, that it tears large pieces of flesh from the whale, as if they had been dug with shovels. The liver of this fish is very large, and abounds
<PB N="14" REF="220"/>
with oil: the flesh of the back, when dried, is counted tolerable provision, either boiled or roasted. The hay is caught by a large hook, baited with flesh, and fastened to a strong iron chain, instead of a line, which he could easily bite asunder. If a man should fall overboard when this animal is at hand, he would attack and devour him in an instant.</P>
<P>Spitzbergen produces neither trees nor shrubs; yet plenty of fewel is found for boiling the blub∣ber, as a vast number of trees are thrown ashore by the sea in this country, as well as on all the northern coasts of Europe. These are supposed to be swept down by the great Tartarean rivers, which annually overflow, and disembogue themselves into the ocean, where the timber is frozen all the win∣ter, and set afloat again by the thaw in the spring.</P>
<P>Directly south of Spitzbergen, between this land and the continent of Europe, we find Cherry Island, lying in the latitude of seventy-four degrees and five minutes; so called in honour of Sir Francis Cherry, who equipped the vessel by which it was discovered in the year 1603. The island abounds with wild fowl, seals, and sea-horses, which have been killed in vast numbers by English ad∣venturers. The Russian company took possession of it in the year 1610; and discovered upon it, as well as upon other small islands by which it is sur∣rounded, mines of lead and coal, which might be wrought to great advantage if a colony was settled, so as that the people would winter on the spot: and surely, with proper precautions and conve∣niences, this country is as habitable as some parts of Hudson's Bay, where the company's officers and servants reside all the winter. In consequence of some unsuccessful voyages to Cherry Island, the Russian company desisted from sending ships thi∣ther; and this place has been deserted for the last hundred years.</P>

To the south-west of Spitzbergen lies John Mayers's Island, so denominated by the Dutch dis∣coverers. The extremity of it is found in the lati∣tude of seventy-one degrees twenty-three minutes. Across the whole island, from north to south, rises a perpendicular mountain of a prodigious heighth, discernible thirty miles at sea, and distinguished by the name of Beerenbergen, or Bear-mountain, on account of the great numbers of these animals which have been seen upon it. This island, tho' generally barren, contains, great plenty of stone; affords pasture for large herds of deer: the sea abounds with fish, and the coast is indented with bays: but as the whales, which used formerly to frequent this coast, have retreated farther to the northward, the island is now quite forsaken <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of the most cu∣rious of these remarks were made on the spot, and com∣municated by Mr. Maude of Downing-street, to whose in∣genuity and candour we own ourselves extremely obliged.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>GROENLAND, OR, OLD GREENLAND.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Its SITUATION and APPEARANCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE country that was first in possession of this name, lies but forty miles to the westward of Iceland, beginning in fifty-nine degrees and fifty minutes of northern latitude. The eastern coast is supposed to extend northerly as far as Spitzbergen, which some navigators have conjectured to be an island separated by a narrow channel from the con∣tinent of Greenland. The western shore has been discovered even beyond the seventieth degree: but, whether it be a large island, or contiguous to North America, cosmographers have not yet been able to determine. This question, indeed, cannot be de∣cided, until some adventurers shall have penetrated into the bottom of Davis's Streights, or rather Baffin's Bay, which is a continuation of these Streights: and here it may not be amiss to observe of the Streight of Frobisher in Greenland, that the reverend Mr. Egede, who resided fifteen years in this country, and seems to have taken great pains in extending his inquiries, declares that he could find no such Streight, nor any place like Bear Sound in the coast of Groenland, though these are laid down in all the sea-charts, as forming two large islands adjacent to the main land. If we may be∣lieve what information has been gleaned from those natives who inhabit the most northern parts of Groenland, there is but a very narrow passage be∣tween
<PB N="17" REF="250"/>
this country and America. They affirm they have spoken with the people of the other side, whose language resembles their own; and they al∣ledge the streight is so contracted in one place, that two persons can shoot at the same fish from opposite sides of the channel. In all probability, however, this narrow streight is no more than a small body of water that divides Groenland from one of the lesser islands; and that if there is no north-west passage towards the bottom of Bassin's Bay, Groenland itself is part of the American continent.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, Groenland is a mountainous country, so high as to be discerned thirty leagues at sea. The inland mountains, hills, and rocks, are covered with eternal snow: but the low lands on the sea-side are in summer cloathed with verdure. The coast abounds with inlets, bays, and large rivers; and is surrounded with a vast number of islands of different dimensions: but what ren∣ders it in many places inaccessible, are the moun∣tains and islands of ice floating and fixed, that ap∣pear like insuperable barriers along the shore, and seem to interdict all manner of approach. The principal river, called Baal, falls into the sea in the latitude of sixty-four, where the first Danish lodge was settled in the year 1721, and has been navi∣gated above forty miles up the country.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FIRST SETTLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Groenland was settled in the eighth century by a company of Icelanders headed by Ericke Rande, who had been driven by accident on the coast, and represented the country in such a favourable light to his countrymen, that some families followed him thither, and settled on the eastern part, where they happily increased and multiplied; bestowing on their new habitation the name of Greenland or
<PB N="18" REF="260"/>
Greenland, on account of its verdant appearance. This colony was converted to christianity by a mis∣sionary priest from Norway, sent thither by the ce∣labrated Olaf, the first Norwegian sovereign who embraced the doctrines of Christ. The Groenland settlement throve under his protection; and in a little time, the country was provided with many towns, churches, convents, bishops, and a regu∣lar clergy, suffragans to the archbishop of Dron∣theim. A considerable commerce was carried on between them and Norway, and a regular inter∣course maintained till the year 1406, when the last bishop was sent over to Groenland: from that period, all correspondence was cut off, and all knowledge of Groenland consigned to oblivion. This strange and abrupt cessation of trade and intercourse has been ascribed partly to the change and translation of the Norwegian government in the reign of queen Margaret; partly to the ensu∣ing wars between Denmark and Sweden, which could not fail to interrupt the maritime commerce; and partly to the difficulty and danger which at∣tended the navigation to Groenland: but the most probable cause of such a sudden privation is found in another event. The inland colony, from its first settlement, had been harrassed by the Abori∣gines of Groenland, a savage barbarous people, agreeing in customs, garb, and appearance, with those Americans who have since been found to the northward of Hudson's Bay. This nation, called Schrellings, at length prevailed against the Iceland settlers who had chosen their habitation in the west∣ern district, and exterminated them in the fourteenth century: insomuch that when their brethren of the eastern district came to their assistance, they found nothing alive but some cattle and flocks of sheep running wild about the fields and meadows. Perhaps they themselves afterwards experienced
<PB N="19" REF="270"/>
the same fate, and were totally destroyed by those Schrellings, whose descendants still inhabit the western parts of Groenland, and from tradition con∣firm this conjecture. They affirm, that the houses and villages whose ruins still appear, were inhabited by a nation of strangers whom their ancestors de∣stroyed. There are some reasons, however, for believing that there may be still some descendants of the antient Iceland colony remaining in the eastern district, though they cannot be visited by land on account of the stupendous mountains, perpetually covered with frost and snow, which divide the two parts of Groenland; while they have been rendered inaccessible from sea, by the vast quantity of ice driven from Spitzbergen and other northern coasts upon this eastern shore, to which it adheres, form∣ing an insuperable barricado. One would imagine there must have been some considerable alteration in the terraqueous globe since the fifteenth century, in consequence of which those coasts became inac∣cessible, that were antiently visited without much peril. The reader too will naturally ask by what means the people of the eastern colony surmounted the above-mentioned obstacles when they went to the assistance of their western friends; how they re∣turned to their own country, and in what manner historians learned the success of their expedition. All that we gather from authentic records, is, that Groenland was divided into two districts, called West Bygd, and East Bygd; that the western divi∣sion contained four parishes, and one hundred vil∣lages; that the eastern district was still more flou∣rishing, as being nearer to Iceland, sooner settled, and more frequented by shipping from Norway. That this colony is not yet extinct, has been con∣jectured from the following circumstances: if we may believe Thormoder in his history of Groen∣land, Amand, bishop of Shalholt in Iceland, re∣turning
<PB N="20" REF="280"/>
from Norway, about the year 1530, was driven upon the coast of Groenland, along which he sailed northerly as far as Herjolsness, where, being close in shore, he and all the people on board could easily descry the inhabitants driving their flocks in the pasture grounds: but, the wind proving fair, the bishop, instead of landing, directed his course for Iceland, and next morning came to anchor in the bay of St. Patrick. The master of an Hamburgh vessel, being forced also by adverse winds on the coast of this country, where he had well nigh perished among the ice, at last entered a fine bay, where he found several green islands inhabited. After some hesitation he went ashore in his boat, and visited the nearest house, which was very small, mean, and inconvenient. Here he found all the tackle belonging to a fishing-boat. At a little distance was a hut, or booth, built of stones, for the conveniency of drying fish, accord∣ing to the method practised in Iceland. In this hut he saw the dead body of a man, extended on the ground, with his face downwards, and a sewed cap on his head: his garb consisted partly of coarse cloth, and partly of seal-skin; and by his side lay a rusty knife, which the captain brought to Iceland as a testimony of what he had seen. This disco∣very must have been made above a century; as the annals in which we find it, were composed about fifty years ago, by Beorno of Skarsaa. The same author affirms, that on the sea-shore of Ice∣land, the inhabitants often find old broken pieces of deal-boards, which had been part of boats, payed with a sort of pitch or glue made of seal∣blubber; which kind of glue is used in no coun∣try but Groenland. In the year 1625, an intire boat was thrown upon a point of land near Riechi∣strand, of a very artificial structure; the boards being joined together by wooden pegs or nails,
<PB N="21" REF="290"/>
and further secured with the sinews of animals. Beorno likewise, in his book <HI>de Novitiis Groen∣landorum Indiciis,</HI> gives us to understand, that even since this event an oar was found on the eastern shore of Iceland, inscribed with these words in Runic characters, <Q><HI>Oft var ek dascedar ek dro dick;</HI> signifying, “Often was I tired, when I carried thee.”</Q> Dithmarus Blefkenius, a German writer, tells us, he was acquainted in Norway with a monk of Groenland, who accompanied his bishop thither in the year 1564: but, if all intercourse was cut off with Groenland in the year 1406, how could a monk and bishop of that country be in Norway, above a whole century after this period? Besides, Arngrim Jona refutes this relation of Blefkenius, in a treatise intituled <HI>Anatome Blefkeniana.</HI> In confirmation, however, of what that monk was supposed to have related, Erasmus Franciscus, in his book called <HI>the East and West India State-garden,</HI> treating of Groenland, says, that one Jacob Hall, captain of a Danish ship, had conversed with such a monk in Iceland, remarkable for his broad and tawny face. The friar informed him of a Groen∣land convent of Dominicans, dedicated to St. Thomas; to which belonged a well of boiling hot water, which warmed all the cells, by being con∣veyed through each in leaden pipes. That there was such a convent and such a spring of hot water in Groenland, appears also from the relation of Nicholas Zenetur, a Venetian captain in the service of Denmark, transmitted to us by Kercherus. According to his account, the water served not only to warm the cells and apartments of the con∣vent, but likewise for boiling meat, and baking bread. Hard by was a volcano, which had dis∣charged a quantity of pumice-stones sufficient to build the convent, which was provided with a fine large garden, that, by means of this water, pro∣duced
<PB N="22" REF="300"/>
all sorts of flowers and fruit. The warm water, having watered the garden, discharged itself into an adjoining bay, which never froze; but abounded with fish and wild fowl, yielding plenty of provision to the inhabitants. Though this ac∣count seems altogether romantic, and but very in∣differently attested, we still have a right to suppose that there may be some remains of the antient eastern colony, which certainly comprehended twelve extensive parishes, one hundred and ninety villages, a bishop's see, and two monasteries. The present inhabitants of the western district are en∣tirely ignorant of this part, from which they are divided by rocks, mountains, and deserts; and still more effectually by their apprehension: for they believe the eastern Groenlanders to be a cruel barbarous nation, that destroy and eat all strangers who fall into their hands. About a century after all intercourse between Norway and Groenland had ceased, several ships were sent successively by the kings of Denmark, in order to discover the eastern district; but all of them miscarried. Among these adventurers, Mogens Heinson, after having sur∣mounted many difficulties and dangers, got sight of the land, which however he could not approach. At his return he pretended that the ship was ar∣rested in the middle of her course, by certain rocks of loadstone at the bottom of the sea. The same year, 1576, in which this attempt was made, has been rendered remarkable by the voyage of captain Martin Forbisher, sent upon the same errand by queen Elizabeth. He likewise described the land, but could not reach it, and therefore returned to England; yet not before he had sailed sixty leagues in the streight which still retains his name, and landed on several islands, where he had some com∣munication with the natives. He had likewise taken possession of the country in the name of
<PB N="23" REF="310"/>
queen Elizabeth, and brought away some pieces of heavy black stone, from which the refiners of Lon∣don extracted a certain proportion of gold. In the ensuing spring he undertook a second voyage, at the head of a small squadron, equipped at the ex∣pence of the publick; entered the streights a second time; discovered upon an island a gold and silver mine; bestowed names upon different bays, islands, and headlands; and brought away a lading of ore, together with two natives, a male and a female, whom the English kidnapped.</P>
<P>Such was the success of this voyage, that another armament was fitted out under the auspices of ad∣miral Forbisher, consisting of fifteen sail, including a considerable number of soldiers, miners, smel∣ters, carpenters, and bakers, to remain all the winter near the mines in a wooden fort, the dif∣ferent pieces of which they carried out in the transports. They met with boisterous weather, impenetrable fogs, and violent currents upon the coast of Groenland, which retarded their opera∣tions until the season was far advanced. Part of their wooden fort was lost at sea; and they had neither provision nor fuel sufficient for the winter. The admiral therefore determined to return with as much ore as he could procure: of this they ob∣tained large quantities out of a new mine, to which they gave the name of the countess of Sus∣sex. They likewise built an house of stone and lime, provided with ovens; and here, with a view to conciliate the affection of the natives, they left a quantity of small morrice-bells, knives, beads, looking-glasses, leaden pictures, and other toys, together with several loaves of bread. They bu∣ried the timber of the fort where it could be easily found next year, and sowed corn, pease, and other grain, by way of experiment, to know what the country would produce. Having taken these pre∣cautions,
<PB N="24" REF="320"/>
they sailed from thence in the beginning of September; and after a month's stormy passage arrived in England: but this noble design was never prosecuted.</P>
<P>Christian IV. king of Denmark, being desirous of discovering the old Greenland settlement, sent three ships thither, under the command of captain Godske Lindenow; who is said to have reached the east coast of Groenland, where he traded with the savage inhabitants, such as they are still found in the western district, but saw no signs of a civi∣lized people. Had he actually landed in the eastern division, he must have perceived some re∣mains of the antient colony, even in the ruins of their convents and villages. Lindenow kidnapped two of the natives, who were conveyed to Copen∣hagen; and the same cruel fraud <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more in∣human and repugnant to the dictates of common justice, than this practice of tearing away poor creatures from their country, their families, and connexions; unless we suppose them altogether destitute of natural affection: that this was not the case with those poor Greenlanders, some of whom were brought alive to Copen∣hagen, appears from the whole tenour of their conduct, upon their first capture, and during their confinement in Denmark. When first captivated, they rent the air with their cries and lamentations: they even leaped into the sea, and when taken on board, for some time refused all sustenance. Their eyes were continually turned towards their dear country, and their faces always bathed in tears. Even the counte∣nance of his Danish majesty, and the caresses of the court and people, could not alle∣viate their grief. One of them was perceived to shed tears al∣ways when he saw an infant in the mother's arms: a circum∣stance from whence it was na∣turally concluded, that he had left his wife with a young child in Groenland. Two of them went to sea in their little canoes, in hope of reaching Groenland; but one of them was retaken. Other two made the same attempt; but were driven by a storm on the coast of Schonen, where they were apprehended by the peasants, and reconveyed to Copen∣hagen. One of them after∣wards died of a fever, caught in fishing pearl, during the winter, for the governor of Kolding. The rest lived some years in Denmark; but at length, seeing no prospect of being able to revisit their na∣tive country, sunk into a kind of melancholy disorder, and expired.</NOTE> was practised by the other two ships which sailed into Davis's
<PB N="25" REF="330"/>
Streights, where they discovered divers fine har∣bours, and delightful meadows covered with ver∣dure. In some places they are said to have found a considerable quantity of ore, every hundred pounds of which yielded twenty-six ounces of silver. The same admiral Lindenow made another voyage to the coast of Greenland in the year 1606, directing his course to the westward of Cape Fare∣well. He coasted along the Streight of Davis; and having made some observations on the face of the country, the harbours and islands, returned to Denmark. Carsten Richards, being detached with two ships on the same discovery, descried the high land on the eastern side of Groenland; but was hindered by the ice from approaching the shore.</P>
<P>Other expeditions of the same nature have been planned and executed with the same bad success, under the auspices of a Danish company of mer∣chants. Two ships returned from the western part of Groenland loaded with a kind of yellow sand, supposed to contain a large proportion of gold. This being assayed by the goldsmiths of Copen∣hagen, was condemned as useless, and thrown overboard: but from a small quantity of this sand, which was reserved as a curiosity, an expert chy∣mist afterwards extracted a quantity of pure gold. The captain, who brought home this adventure, was so chagrined at his disappointment, that he died of grief, without having left any directions concerning the place where the sand had been dis∣covered. In the year 1654, Henry Muller, a rich Dane, equipped a vessel under the command of David De Nelles, who sailed to the west coast of Groenland, from which he carried off three women
<PB N="26" REF="340"/>
of the country. Other efforts have been made, under the encouragement of the Danish king, for the discovery and recovery of the old Iceland co∣lony in Greenland: but all of them miscarried, and people began to look upon such expeditions as wild and chimerical. At length the Greenland company at Bergen in Norway, transported a co∣lony to the western coast, about the sixty-fourth degree of latitude; and these Norwegians sailed in the year 1712, accompanied by the reverend Hans Egede, to whose care, ability, and preci∣sion, we owe the best and most authentic account of modern Groenland. This gentleman endea∣voured to reach the eastern district, by coasting southwards, and advanced as far as the States Pro∣montory: but the season of the year, and con∣tinual storms, obliged him to return; and as he could not even find the Streight of Forbisher, he concluded that no such place ever existed. In the year 1724, a ship, being equipped by the com∣pany, sailed on this discovery, with a view to land on the east side opposite to Iceland: but the vast shoals of ice, which barricadoed that part of the coast, rendered this scheme impracticable. His Danish majesty, in the year 1728, caused horses to be transported to Greenland, in hope that the set∣tlers might by their means travel over land to the eastern district; but the icy mountains were found impassable. Finally, lieutenant Richards, in a ship which had wintered near the new Danish coiony, attempted, in his return to Denmark, to land on the eastern shore; but all his endeavours proved abortive.</P>
<P>Mr. Egede is of opinion, that the only prac∣ticable method of reaching that part of the coun∣try, will be to coast north-about in small vessels, between the great flakes of ice and the shore; as the Groenlanders have declared, that the currents
<PB N="27" REF="350"/>
continually rushing from the bays and inlets, and running south-westwards along the shore, hinder the ice from adhering to the land; so that there is always a channel open, through which vessels of small burden might pass, especially if lodges were built at convenient distances on the shore, for the convenience and direction of the adventurers.</P>
<P>After this short detail of the first discovery and settlement of Groenland, the loss of that colony, and the pains that have been taken to retrieve it; we shall now proceed to describe that part of the country which is now known, visited and settled by the Danes and Norwegians.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>Between the sixty-fourth and sixty-eighth de∣grees of latitude, the climate of Groenland, with respect to heat and cold, is not disagreeable. In the summer, which continues from the latter end of May to the middle of September, the weather is warm and comfortable, and the sky serene while the wind blows easterly: nay, the heat is sometimes so violent, as to exhale the sea-water which had been left in the hollows of the rocks, and leave a white salt behind. It must be owned, however, that the sea-cost is infested with fogs, which are equally disagreeable and unhealthy; and that even the summer is roughened with frequent storms, which rage to an incredible degree of vio∣lence: yet some seasons have passed in delightful weather, without any such boisterous interruption. Near the shore, and in the bays and inlets, the low land is cloathed with the most charming verdure: but the inland mountains are perpetually covered with ice and snow. To the northward of the six∣ty-eighth degree, the cold is so intense, even in summer, that spirituous liquors will freeze at the fire-side. By the latter end of August, the sea is
<PB N="28" REF="360"/>
covered with ice, which never thaws till April or May, and sometimes remains till the latter end of June. Nothing can exhibit a more dreadful, and at the same time a more dazzling appearance than those prodigious masses of ice that surround the whole coast, in the different forms of rocks, castles, towers, and spires, reflecting a variety of colours, according to the nature of the concrete, and float∣ing from place to place, as if the whole scene was the effect of illusion or inchantment. Such are the prospects they yield in calm weather: but when the wind begins to blow, and the sea to swell in vast successive billows, the conflict of those con∣gregated bodies of ice encountering, dashing, cracking, bursting, and shivering into ten thou∣sand fragments, fills the eye and ear with terror and astonishment. Thunder and lightning seldom disturb the air of Groenland, which however is subject to meteors of various kinds, and is in a particular manner illuminated by the <HI>Aurora Bo∣realis,</HI> or northern light, so little understood by natural philosophers. In the spring of the year, and about the new moon, this phaenomenon gene∣rally appears so bright and universal over the whole face of the sky, darting, gleaming, and commix∣ing with inconceivable rapidity, that one may see to read by the light which it diffuses. At the summer solstice the sun continues all night above the horizon; and in the depth of winter he does not appear: nevertheless, people have light enough to travel and work, from moonshine or starlight, re∣flected by the ice and snow with which both sea and land are covered. The air of Groenland is rendered unhealthy by thick mists and fogs in the summer, which produce diseases of the breast, and the scurvy seems to be endemial. In the winter, while the cold is excessive, they are trou∣bled with a frost-smoak, or thick vapour rising
<PB N="29" REF="370"/>
from the sea, so acrimonious as to corrode the skin of those that approach it: this quality, however, ceases as soon as the person is wholly involved in the vapour, which then feels soft and warm, and leaves an hoar-frost on the cloaths and hair. At the new and full moon, especially in the spring and fall, the tide upon this coast rises about three fathoms; and it is remarkable, that the springs and fountains on shore rise and fall with the flux and reflux of the ocean.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL: PRODUCTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>The soil of Groenland varies like that of all other mountainous countries. The hills are bar∣ren, and indeed frozen all the year: the vallies and low grounds, especially towards the sea, are rich and fruitful. We are informed by antient chro∣nicles, that the Groenland colonies bred a great number of cattle, which produced butter and cheese in such abundance, that considerable quantities of both were exported to Norway, and, on account of their peculiar excellency, set apart for the king's kitchen. We read in the same histories, that some parts of Groenland yielded the choicest wheat∣corn; and to this day the marks of ploughed land are easily perceived. The soil brought forth stately oaks, that yielded acorns as large as apples; and some of these still remain in the southern parts, near the States Promontory. The woods afforded plenty of game, such as rein-deer, hares, and par∣tridges; and the bays abounded with fish for home-consumption and commerce. Though at present this country is destitute of corn and cattle, it produces in many places excellent pasture; and were it properly manured, would in all probability yield plentful crops of grain. The reverend Mr. Egede sowed some barley in a bay adjoining to the Danish colony, where it sprang up so fast, that
<PB N="30" REF="380"/>
towards the latter end of July it was in the full ear; but being nipped by a night-frost, it never arrived at maturity. This seed was brought from Bergen, where the summer is of greater heat and duration; but, in all probability, the corn which grows in the more northern parts of Norway, would thrive in Groenland, as the two climates are more congenial. Turnips and coleworts, of an excellent taste and flavour, are easily raised in Groenland; and the grass is remarkably rich in meadows. Among the bays and inlets there is plenty of underwood, and shrubs of birch, elm, and willow, that afford sufficient fuel for the inha∣bitants. In the latitude of sixty, the birch-trees rise to the height of two and three fathoms. Small juniper-trees grow here in abundance, and bear vast quantities of large berries. The herb ange∣lica shoots up in every field, as well as the wild rosemary, endued with the taste and flavour of turpentine: from this a fine aromatic oil and spirit are extracted by distillation. The sea-side is co∣vered with scurvy-grass, agreeable to the taste, and remarkably salutiferous: here also we find a species of grass bearing yellow flowers, with a root that smells in the spring like roses. The sides of the mountains near the bays, are cloathed with wild thyme, which, after sun-set, diffuses a fragrant odour. The herb tormentil is common in this country, as are many other plants and vegetables not yet denominated or described. Among the fruits of Groenland we number juniperberries, blueberries, bilberries, and brambleberries.</P>
<P>Groenland no doubt produces metals of various kinds, although no mines are actually discovered and wrought in that country. There are some appearances of copper ore to the southward of the Danish colony: Mr. Egede once received a lump of ore from a Groenlander; and here he found
<PB N="31" REF="390"/>
calamine of a yellow colour. He sent a consider∣able quantity of yellow sand, mixed with vermi∣lion streaks, to the company of Bergen, who pro∣bably found their account in this present: for they desired him, by a letter, to procure as much of that sand as possible; but he was never able to find the place where he saw the first specimen. It was one of the smallest among a great cluster of islands, and the mark he had set up was blown down by a storm. Perhaps this was the same mineral of which several hundred tons were brought to Eng∣land by Sir Martin Forbisher. Groenland pro∣duces rock-chrystals, both red and white; and whole mountains of the asbestos, containing long filaments, which, when beaten and separated from the rocky dross and fragments, may be spun and woven into cloth that will endure the fire, without being consumed. Around the colony of Danes, which is known by the name of Good Hope, they find a kind of bastard marble of various colours, which the natives form into bowls, lamps, pots, and crucibles. In the sea, besides a great variety of shells, they find some beautiful trees of coral. All that has been said of the fertility of the Groen∣land soil, must be understood only of that which lies between the sixtieth and sixty-fifth degrees of latitude: for the most northern parts are almost destitute of herbs and plants. The wretched people, who reside in this desolate country, cannot find grass enough to stuff into their shoes, that their feet may be kept warm; but are obliged to buy it from the more southern inhabitants.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>No toads, newts, lizards, or serpents, are seen in Greenland; nor any insect more venomous than gnats, which however swarm in the summer, and are extremely troublesome. There is not even a
<PB N="32" REF="400"/>
ravenous animal in this country, except the great white bear, which very seldom appears near the Danish colony. The quadrupeds of Groenland are the rein-deer, foxes, hares, and dogs. The rein∣deer feed in great herds, and are hunted all the summer by the natives; who, in this exercise, pe∣netrate to the innermost bays, and pursue the deer from place to place, accompanied by their wives and children. The hares are found in great plenty, of a white colour, very fat in summer, and of ex∣quisite flavour. The Groenland foxes appear of different colours, white, grey, and bluish; but smaller than those of Denmark and Norway, and not so hairy. Arngrim Jona, in his history of this country, mentions sables, martens, wolves, lesses, and ermines; but none of these animals have been seen by Mr. Egede. The natives are provided with a great number of dogs, large, rough, white, or speckled, with ears standing upright, which is the case with all the curs peculiar to cold climates. The Groenland dogs are timorous and stupid: they neither bay nor bark, but sometimes howl dismal∣ly. In the northern parts the natives yoke them in sledges, which, though heavy laden, they will draw upon the ice at the rate of seventy miles in a short winter's day. These poor animals are very ill rewarded for their service, being left to provide for themselves, except when their masters take a great number of seals: on these occasions, the dogs are regaled with the blood or entrails: at other times they subsist, like wild beasts, upon muscles and berries.</P>
<P>Among the land-fowls and birds of Groenland, we reckon a kind of large partridges, white in winter, and grey in summer, which are found in great abundance; sparrows, snow-birds, ice-birds, and a kind of linnet that warbles very melodiously. Ravens, in great numbers, are seen continually
<PB N="33" REF="410"/>
about the huts of the Groenlanders, hovering over the carcases of the seals, with which the ground is commonly strewed. Here are also eagles of a pro∣digious size, faulcons of different colours, and large speckled owls. Of the insect species there are spiders, flies, humble-bees, and wasps; but neither frogs, beetles, nor ants: neither are the people plagued with rats, mice, or any such ver∣mine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SEA-ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The sea of Groenland teems with the same spe∣cies of animals which have been already described in the article of Spitzbergen. Here we find the whale, the fin-whale, the north-cape whale, and the cachelot, or pot-fish, that yields the <HI>sperma ceti;</HI> the unicorn, the sword-fish, the white-fish, the but-head, the hay, and porcpisce.</P>
<P>It may be observed, that the whale is furnished with a bunch on the back-part of his head, per∣forated with two openings parallel to each other, through which he sucks in the air, and spouts out the water. The <HI>penis</HI> of the male is a strong sinew, from eight to fourteen feet in length, ac∣cording to the size of the fish, included in a sheath or capsula. The parts of generation proper to the female, resemble those of quadrupeds: she has two breasts furnished with teats, like a cow, at which she suckles her young; and never brings forth above two at a time. The whale's food chiefly consists of the <HI>pulmo marinus,</HI> a sort of blub∣ber resembling a jelly, with two brims or flaps; but, in fact, an animal of the polypus kind, that moves slowly on the surface of the water. The sea of Groenland abounds with this substance, which is counted a dainty to the whale; though he feeds occasionally on insects and small fish. The north-cape whale, so called because he appears
<PB N="34" REF="420"/>
generally on the northern coast of Norway, has been found to have above a tun of herrings in his belly. The cachelot, or pot-fish, differs from other whales in many particulars: his scull is larger and stronger; his spouts are placed on the forehead; his lower jaw is armed with teeth; his tongue is thin, pointed, and of a yellowish colour: he has but one eye, fixed on the side of the head; so that he is easy of access to the Groenlanders, who attack him on his blind side. The <HI>sperma ceti</HI> is prepared from the oil of his head, of which one fish will yield from twenty to four and twenty tons. The length of the cachelot is from sixty to seventy feet. The flesh of the white-fish, when pickled with vinegar and salt, is as well tasted as pork; and the fins, with the tail, when prepared in the same manner, are counted delicious eating. These fish are from twelve to sixteen feet long, of a yellow colour, and are taken in great numbers by the inhabitants of Groenland. The butt, or blunt-head, so called from the form of its snout, is of the same size, furnished with one air-pipe on the hinder part of the head: he follows ships under sail, as if he vied with them in swiftness; and is one of those fishes that tumble before a storm.</P>
<P>The sea-unicorn we have already described; and the porcpisce, or porpoise, is so universally known, that it scarce needs any description.</P>
<P>This coast likewise abounds with the morse, which is so fierce and courageous, that he will maintain a battle with the great white bear, and sometimes obtains the victory, by means of his mighty tusks. These animals frequently fight to∣gether until both expire.</P>
<P>Of the merman, mermaid, kranken, marmel, and other sea-monsters and phantoms, we shall treat at large in our account of Norway. But of all the animals upon this coast, that which chiefly
<PB N="35" REF="430"/>
contributes to the subsistence and convenience of the natives, is the seal. There are different sorts of this creature; but the most remarkable is the <HI>clap-myss,</HI> so called from a cap or cowl with which he covers his head occasionally. The seal's head resembles that of a dog with cropped ears: his snout is bearded like a cat; his eyes are large, and his teeth sharp: his skin is covered with a short thick fur, white, black, brown, or tawny: he is web-footed, for the convenience of swimming; and seems to drag himself along, rather than to walk: his size is from five to eight feet in length; and his fat yields better train-oil than that of any other sea-animal. The Groenlanders feed on the flesh of this creature: the skin serves them as cloaths for their bodies, and covering for their boats and tents; and the fat they not only burn in their lamps for light, but also use for fuel to cook their provisions.</P>
<P>Mr. Egede declares, that, in the year 1734, the sea-serpent was seen off the new Danish colony, and raised its head mast-high above the surface of the sea. For further particulars relating to this prodigious animal, see our account of Norway.</P>
<P>Besides the fish already mentioned, the Groen∣land seas abound with holybut, turbut, cod, had∣dock, scate, and small salmon, which last are found very fat and well-flavoured in all inlets and mouths of rivers. The natives chiefly feed on cat-fish, of which there is great plenty, both in winter and summer. In the month of April they catch abun∣dance of the roe-fish, called rogneals, or stone∣biter; and in May great numbers of lyds or stents. Both these are good and savoury, and frequent the bays in prodigious shoals. Here too we find abundance of whiting, and a fish resembling a bream, with prickles all over its body, counted good eating: but no herrings visit this coast.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="440"/>
Among the testaceous fishes of Groenland, we find large delicate mussels in great quantities, some of them containing small pearls of no great value. The shore also produces crabs and shrimps; but neither crawfish nor oysters. On the southern coast the inhabitants are said to have taken some tortoises; but this creature can hardly be deemed a native of the Groenland seas.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SEA-BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>The principal sea-fowl of Groenland, is the edder∣fowl, which swarms in such numbers, that they seem to cover the whole surface of the ocean. In the winter they hover about the Danish colony in myriads; standing in for the bay every evening, and taking their flight to seaward in the morning. In the spring they retire to the islands that sur∣round the coast, in order to lay their eggs, and hatch their young; and afterwards return to the main land in the months of June and July. The natives rob them of their eggs and young; but ignorantly leave in the nests the fine down-feathers, so much valued in other countries. Of the duck species, there are three sorts common to this cli∣mate: one resembles the tame duck in its broad bill, and is adorned with a fine speckled plumage. This creature, as well as the edder-fowl, builds upon the islands. The second sort is of a smaller size, with a long pointed bill, residing chiefly in bays and fresh waters, where they hatch among the reeds. The third species is called the wood∣duck, resembling the first, though larger in size, with a black breast and a grey body. These ani∣mals are said to deviate from the common course of generation, and to be produced from a slimy matter in the sea, which adheres to old pieces of sloating wood: of this a kind of mussel is gene∣rated, in which is bred a little maggot or worm,
<PB N="37" REF="450"/>
that, in process of time, is formed into a bird. Such a theory of propagation will, by the sensible part of mankind, be always rejected as unphiloso∣phical and absurd. There is another sea-fowl called alkes, which, in the winter season, the Groenlanders drive in large flocks to the shore, where they catch them with their hands, and kill them for provision. This bird is not so large as the duck, and the flesh is oily and rancid: there is, however, a smaller kind of the same species, much more palatable. The most beautiful bird on this coast resembles a lark in size and form; but is arrayed in very gorgeous feathers, and known by the natives under the name of <HI>tungo∣viarseck.</HI> The northern parts of Groenland abound with wild geese, which come hither from more southern climates in the spring to breed, and re∣turn to them again in the beginning of winter. Among the sea-fowl of Groenland we likewise number all kinds of sea-mews, that build in the clifts of the highest rocks; the bird called terne, which lays its eggs on the islands, where they are found among the stones in great abundance; the lundes, or Groenland parrot, so called on account of its speckled bill and beauteous plumage; the sea-emms, a large fowl with very small wings; and great plenty of snipes. Here are many others common to different countries, and some peculiar to Groenland, which have not yet been denomi∣nated or described.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>The people who now inhabit the western coast of Groenland, and are without doubt the de∣scendants of those <HI>Schrellings</HI> who exterminated the first Iceland colony, bear a near resemblance to the Laplanders and Samoiedes in their persons, com∣plexions, and way of life. There will always be
<PB N="38" REF="460"/>
found a strong affinity between the customs of different nations living in the same kind of cli∣mate, exposed to the same wants and necessities, and involved in the same ignorance and brutality. The Groenlanders are short, brawny, and inclined to corpulency, with broad faces, flat noses, thick lips, black hair and eyes, and a yellowish tawny complexion. They are, for the most part, vigor∣ous and healthy, but remarkably short-lived; few of them reaching the grand climacterick, and many dying in their infancy, and in the prime of youth. They are subject to a weakness in the eyes, occasioned by the sharp and piercing winds, as well as by the white glare reflected from the ice and snow with which the whole country is covered. The leprosy is likewise known among them, but not contagious. Those that dwell in the northern parts are miserably plagued with dysenteries, rheums, and pulmonary disorders, boils and epi∣lepsy. The small-pox, being imported among them from Copenhagen in the year 1734, made terrible havock among those poor people, who are the more to be pitied when under the hand of dis∣temper, as they are utterly ignorant of medicine, and intirely depend upon the spells of their <HI>ange∣kuts,</HI> or conjurers. When they chance to be hurt, they sew or stitch up the wound. They even pre∣sume to cure blindness, by pulling off the film from the eye, with a hook, needle, or knife. When a child is troubled with worms, the mother is said to suck them out by the <HI>anus.</HI> The inner∣most rind of a tree, or burned moss, mixed with train-oil, is counted a specific plaister for the most dangerous wounds.</P>
<P>The Groenlanders are in their dispositions cold, phlegmatic, indolent, and slow of apprehension; but very quiet, orderly, and good-natured. Though they are subject to no laws, or regular discipline,
<PB N="39" REF="470"/>
they live peaceably together like brothers, with∣out envy, strife, or animosity. If a murder should be committed, which is very seldom the case, no cognizance is taken of the murderer, unless the nearest kinsman of the deceased thinks proper to revenge his death. They think it is meritorious to kill those old women who pretend to be witches, because they are supposed to do mischief by their conjurations. Far from stealing from one another, they look upon theft with abhorrence; and, indeed, have every thing in common: but they are not so scrupulous with respect to strangers, whom they think it is no crime to pillage. Fornication is al∣together unknown among these savages, except upon some occasions, when they are permitted to converse with each other's wives promiscuously. They are, in general, modest, civil, and hospitable; but slovenly, even to a degree of beastliness. The men never wash themselves; but, in imitation of the cat, lick their fingers, with which they rub off the salt spray which the sea throws into their faces and eyes: they even lick up the sweat, which they scrape from their faces with knives. They eat after their dogs, without cleansing their bowls and platters; and do not scruple to devour the lice, and other vermin, which they find on their own bodies. The women wash themselves in their own urine, which, in their opinion, causes the hair to grow, and diffuses a fragrant odour all around them. A virgin, thus besprinkled and perfumed, is complimented with the epithet <HI>niviarsiar sua∣nerks,</HI> implying, maiden sweetness; and she goes out into the cold air, to let the urine freeze upon the surface of her skin. They use no ceremony in complying with the calls of nature, which they obey without scruple in the midst of company; and every family is supplied with an urine tub, placed before the entry, for the use of every indi∣vidual.
<PB N="40" REF="480"/>
The contents of this precious reservoir are kept until they become intolerably offensive, and the smell is reinforced by raw skins soaked in this tub for dressing: if we add the scent arising from pieces of corrupted flesh and fat, thrown carelesly under the benches, the reader will own that nothing can be less delicate than a Groen∣lander's habitation. These people, both men and women, are dressed in garments made of the skins of seals and rein-deer; and, by way of finery, they sometimes wear jackets of birds skin, nicely prepared. The man wears a coat reaching down to the knees, with the hairy side of the skin turned inwards for warmth; and to this coat or jacket is sewed a cap or hood, to cover the head and shoul∣ders. The breeches and stockings are made of the same stuff, and their boots of seal-skin, well tanned and nicely wrought. Over the jacket he puts on a large frock of dressed seal-skin, to keep out the water: between the frock and the under∣coat he sometimes uses a shirt of linnen, or of seal∣guts, the better to defend him from the water. Since their communication with the Danes, how∣ever, the Groenlanders sometimes appear in linnen shirts, cloth coats and breeches; but still fashioned according to their own mode: they likewise pur∣chase coarse worsted stockings of various colours. There is no great difference between the dress of the man and the woman in Groenland. The fe∣males wear wider and longer coats, for the conve∣nience of carrying their infants at their backs, wrapped up in the skirts of them; for they use neither cradles nor swaddling cloaths. Their drawers reach to the middle of the thigh; but their breeches come down to the knees. Next to the body they wear waistcoats made of fawns skin, with the hair inwards. Their coat, or upper gar∣ment, is made of swans skins, or seal-skin,

trimmed with a white border, and embroidered along the seams. The hair of the head, which is very long and sleek, they braid and tie up in a knot, and it appears very becoming. Their necks, arms, and ears, they adorn with beads, corals, pendants, and bracelets of black skin set with pearls. With the same view they stain their fore∣heads, chins, arms, legs, and thighs with black streaks, indented in the skin by means of a needle and coloured thread. The women are hard fa∣voured, sluttish, and filthy, especially those wives who have borne children, because they know they cannot be repudiated by their husbands. The Groenlanders feed upon the flesh of rein-deer, whales, seals, hares, partridges, and all sorts of sea-fowl. Their flesh-meat they sometimes eat raw, and sometimes boiled or dried in the sun and wind. Their fish is always thoroughly boiled, or well dried: thus they preserve their salmon, roe∣fish, holybut, and small stents: these they catch in the months of May and June, and preserve for winter provision, as the seals are not easily taken in the severe season, except in the northern parts, where they are killed on the ice. The inhabitants likewise provide store of these animals in the sum∣mer, and bury them under the snow; from whence they are dug out frozen in the winter, to be eaten without any farther preparation. Their drink is the simple element, cooled with lumps of ice and snow. They never cleanse their kettles, pots, or dishes; but eat their victuals off the dirty ground, and devour rotten flesh with the utmost avidity. They have no set meals, but occasionally obey the calls of appetite; except at their return from sea, when they indulge themselves with a plentiful sup∣per: even then the women eat separately by them∣selves. In times of scarcity the Groenlanders will subsist upon pieces of old skin, reeds, sea-weed,
<PB N="42" REF="510"/>
and a root called <HI>tugloronet,</HI> dressed with fat and train-oil. The dung of rein-deer, taken from the intestines, the intrails of partridges, and all sorts of offal, are counted dainties among these savages; and of the scrapings of seal-skins they make deli∣cate pancakes. In summer they use wood for fuel to cook their victuals: in winter they boil them over the flame of their lamps in small kettles, manufactured by themselves, of brass, copper, or marble. Their fires, when extinguished, they re∣kindle by the friction of a piece of hard wood upon a block of dried fir-tree.</P>
<P>The Groenlanders at first could not taste the Danish provisions without marks of abhorrence; but now they are become extremely fond of bread and butter: yet they still retain their aversion to spirituous liquors and tobacco; in this particular differing from the Laplanders and Samoiedes. A Groenlander commonly contents himself with one wife; though a great number is indulged to he∣roes, and extraordinary personages; and the hus∣band enjoys the prerogative of repudiating at his pleasure. These people are so far from being jea∣lous, that, at some of their festivals, in the midst of their feasting and revelry, a man retires with his neighbour's wife behind a curtain made of skins; and all the guests, thus coupled, withdraw in their turns. These privileges, however, are enjoyed by married persons only; and he is ac∣counted the best man, who, with the best grace, can oblige his friend in this manner. The married women think themselves happy if an angekut, or prophet, will honour them with his caresses. The young women are remarkably chaste and bashful; though sometimes their modesty is overcome, and they give way to the frailty of human nature. These people never marry within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity; nor is it counted decent
<PB N="43" REF="520"/>
in a couple to marry, who have been educated to∣gether in the same family. The form of their marriages is very simple: the man proposes the match to the parents or relations of the female, and, having obtained their consent, goes to fetch the bride, accompanied and assisted by two old women. The young woman is obliged, for de∣cency's sake, to struggle; and, when brought by force to the house of the bridegroom, sits retired in a corner, with her hair dishevelled, and cover∣ing her face as if she were ashamed. Mean while the man uses all his eloquence and address in per∣suading her to comply with his wishes: the good creature, melted by his rhetoric, yields at length, and the consummation immediately ensues. If the bridegroom's father is wealthy, he feasts his neigh∣bours on this occasion, and entertains them with a variety of games, throwing out poles, rafts, knives, and toys, by way of prizes, to the winners. The Groenland wives submit to chastisement from their husbands with great resignation; but they never correct their children or servants. <Q>As soon as a child is born, the mother, dipping her finger in water, rubs the infant's lips; or putting a bit of snow in its mouth, pronounces the word <HI>imo∣kautit,</HI> signifying “thou hast drank a good deal.”</Q> <Q>In eating, she rubs the child's mouth with a bit of fish, saying, <HI>aiparpotit,</HI> i. e. “Thou hast eaten, and kept me company.”</Q> The umbilical cord is either cut with a mussel-shell, or bit off with the teeth, and carefully preserved as an amulet. When the child is a year old, the mother licks and slab∣bers it all over, in order to render it the more strong and hardy. While a woman is in labour, the gossips hold a chamber-pot over her head, as a charm to hasten the delivery. The child being born, the mother is swathed round the belly with a broad belt, and next day returns to her wonted
<PB N="44" REF="530"/>
occupation. She always carries her child at her back, wrapped up in the skirt of her coat, even when she is at labour, and suckles it to the third or fourth year. Very little education is bestowed upon the children, who naturally follow the ex∣ample of their parents; and, even after marriage, dwell in the same house with the rest of their fa∣mily. When a Groenlander dies, the relations throw all his utensils, furniture, and cloaths into the field, as impure and unpropitious. All who live in the same house are also obliged to carry out their effects, which, however, are brought back in the evening, as by that time they imagine the effluvia from the dead body are intirely dissipated. They mourn for the defunct with tears and hideous howling: they bury him under a heap of stones, dressed in his best apparel, with his legs bent un∣der his back, and well wrapped up in the skins of seals and rein-deer. Near the place of interment they deposite the utensils and implements that be∣longed to the deceased, whether male or female; lest, by their being kept at home, they should recal the remembrance of their departed friend, and consequently renew their sorrow and affliction. Those who have touched the dead body, and in∣deed all who belong to the houshold in which the person died, are deemed unclean, and injoined by the <HI>angekuts</HI> to abstain for some time from certain viands and occupations. A corpse is never con∣veyed through the ordinary entry, but out at the window, or through the back-part of the hut or tent in which he died. <Q>At the funeral a woman lights a stick at the fire, and, weaving it round her head, pronounces <HI>pickleruk pok,</HI> signifying, “”Here is no more to be procured.</Q> Near the grave of a young child they place a dog's head, on the sup∣position, that as infants have no understanding, they will not be able to find the way to the land of
<PB N="45" REF="540"/>
souls, unless guided by the faithful dog. The pastimes and diversions of the Groenlanders con∣sist of dancing and singing in a very rude and aukward manner, playing at ball and socket, and foot-ball, running and wrestling. Their songs are satirical ballads, sung extempore at their assem∣blies, and accompanied with a kind of drum beaten by the singer, who performs very strange gesticu∣lations at the same time for the entertainment of the company. When any person thinks himself injured by his neighbour, instead of fighting with the arm of flesh, he challenges the party to bandy satire with him in public, and his antagonist pre∣pares for the contest, which is always decided in favour of him who can the longest persevere in this kind of altercation.</P>
<P>The Groenlanders are employed all the year either in fishing or hunting. Their game at sea consists of whales, morses, seals, fish for eating, and sea-fowl. On shore they hunt the rein-deer, in different parts of the country: for this purpose they and their families penetrate into the interior parts of the bay, where these animals feed in large herds. There they are driven into a narrow circle, or defile, by the cries and shouts of the Groen∣landers, and, thus straitened, are easily killed with arrows. Their bow is made of fir-tree, wound about with the twisted sinews of animals: the string is composed of the same stuff, or of seal-skin: the arrow is a good fathom in length, pointed with a bearded iron, or a sharp-pointed bone; but those they kill birds with, are blunt at the head, that they may not tear the flesh of the game. Sea-fowls they shoot with lances, which they throw at a great distance with surprising dex∣terity. Their manner of catching whales is quite different from that practised by other Europeans. About fifty persons, men and women, set out in
<PB N="46" REF="550"/>
one long boat, which is called a kone-boat, from <HI>kone,</HI> a woman, because it is rowed by females only. When they find a whale, they strike him with har∣poons; to which are fastened, with long lines, some blown seal-skins, filled with wind like blad∣ders. These, by floating on the surface, not only discover the track of the whale, but hinder him from diving under water for any length of time. They continue to pursue him; and when he is fa∣tigued, or loses strength, they renew their attack with spears and lances, until he expires. On this occasion they are clad in their spring-coats, con∣sisting of one piece, with gloves, boots, and caps made of seal-skins, so tightly laced and sewed to∣gether as to keep out the water. Thus accoutred, they leap into the sea, and begin to slice off the fat, even under water, before the whale is dead; nay, sometimes they are so bold as to mount upon his back, and scarify him while he is still alive. They have many different ways of killing seals; namely, by striking them with a smaller harpoon, equipped also with an air-bag: by watching them when they come to breathe at the air-holes in the ice, and striking them with spears: by approach∣ing them in the disguise of their own species, that is, covered with a seal-skin, creeping upon the ice, and moving the head from side to side, ac∣cording to the manner of this animal: by such a stratagem the Groenlander moves towards the un∣suspecting seal, and kills him with a spear. Be∣fore the snow falls, the natives can see the seals through the ice, and follow their course to the first opening, where they are easily killed: they are likewise surprised while they bask themselves in the sun, either upon rocks or floating pieces of ice. The Groenlanders angle with lines made of whale-bone, cut very small, by means of which they succeed wonderfully: but the holybut is
<PB N="47" REF="560"/>
caught with lines of hemp, or seal-skin. The small salmon and roe-fish they take in little wares, or stone inclosures, which the fish enter with the flood, and at low water are left upon dry land. The lad, or stent-fish, which they open and dry upon the rocks for winter provision, are caught in vast shoals by sieves fixed to the end of long poles. These the natives eat with melted fat, or train-oil. The Groenland canoe, like that used in Nova Zembla and Hudson's Bay, is about three fathoms in length, pointed at both ends, three quarters of a yard in breadth, composed of thin rafts fastened together with the sinews of animals, covered with dressed seal-skins, both below and above, in such a manner, that a circular hole is left in the middle, large enough to admit the body of one man. Into this the Groenlander thrusts himself up to the waiste, and fastens the skin so tight about him, that no water can enter. Thus secured, and armed with a short paddle broad at both ends, he will venture out to sea, in the most stormy weather, to catch seals and sea-fowl; and if he is overset, he can easily raise himself by means of his paddle. A Groenlander, in one of these canoes, which was brought with him to Copenhagen, outstripped a pinnace of sixteen oars, manned with choice ma∣riners. The kone-boat is made of the same mate∣rials; but more durable, and so large as to con∣tain fifty persons, with all their tackle, baggage, and provisions. She is fitted with a mast, which carries a triangular sail, made of the membranes and intrails of seals, and managed without the help of braces and bowlings. These kones are flat-bottomed, and sometimes sixty feet in length: the men think it beneath them to take charge of them, and therefore they are left to the conduct of the women, who indeed are obliged to do all the drudgery, including even the building and repair∣ing
<PB N="48" REF="570"/>
their houses, while the men employ themselves wholly in preparing their hunting implements and fishing-tackle. This country is but thinly inha∣bited. During the winter season the people live in low huts, built of stone and turf: on one side are the windows covered with the transparent membranes of seals and holybuts, to admit the light: on the other stand their beds or benches, on which they lie covered with the skins of seals and rein-deer. Several families live in one of these houses, possessing each a separate apartment, before which is a hearth, with a great lamp placed on a trevit, over which hangs their kettle: above is a rack or shelf, on which their wet clothes are dried. They burn train oil in their lamps, and, instead of wick, use a kind of dry moss, which very well answers the purpose: these fires are not only sufficient to boil their victuals, but likewise produce such a heat, that the whole house is as warm as a bagnio. The door is very low, that as little cold air as possible may be admitted. The house within is lined with old skins, and sur∣rounded with benches for the convenience of the family, as well as of strangers. When the men and women sit at work on these benches, they turn their backs to each other. In the summer they dwell in tents, made of long poles fixed in a conical form, covered with deer-skins internally, and outwardly with seal-skins dressed, so as that the rain cannot pierce them. Every master of a family is provided with a tent, and a kone-boat to transport his luggage from place to place, accord∣ing to his occasions.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE. RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>All the Groenlanders, hitherto known, speak the same language, though different dialects pre∣vail in different districts. It abounds with double
<PB N="49" REF="580"/>
consonants; and is so guttural, that the pronun∣ciation of many words is not to be learned, ex∣cept by those whose organs have been accustomed to it from their infancy. The letters C, D, F, Q, X, are not known in their alphabet. Like the North Americans, they have a great number of long polysyllables. Their words, verbs as well as nouns, are inflected at the end by varying the ter∣minations, without the help of articles; but their language being found defective, they have adopted a good number of words from the Norwegian dialect. Notwithstanding the pious endeavours of the christian missionaries from Denmark, they have no great reason to boast of the proselytes they have made among the natives of Groenland. These savages pay great deference and respect to the Danes, whom, indeed, they obey as their mas∣ters; and hear the truths of the christian religion expounded, without doubting the veracity of their teachers: but, at the same time, they listen with the most mortifying indifference, without retaining the least impression of the Gospel. Though many have suffered themselves to be instructed and bap∣tized, they seem altogether unaffected by the sub∣lime doctrine and mysteries of their new religion, and continue still slavishly bigotted to the absurdi∣ties of their antient superstition. They believe in the immortality of the soul, and in the existence of a spirit called Torngarsuk; of which, however, they have formed the most ridiculous ideas. The Angekuts, who are supposed to be his immediate ministers, differ in their opinions concerning his principles. One says he is without form or shape: another affirms, that he assumes the likeness of a bear: a third pretends he has a large body, and but one arm; and, according to a fourth, he is no larger than a man's finger. Some hold him to be immortal, and others declare he may be killed
<PB N="50" REF="590"/>
by an eruption of wind backwards. He is said to reside in the lower regions of the earth, or in the water. They likewise believe in a spirit that in∣habits the air, called <HI>Innirirrirfok,</HI> or the Re∣strainer, because he is supposed, by the mouth of the Angekuts, to restrain people from certain kinds of food, or actions that might be attended with mischievous consequences. They adore an∣other spirit resident in the air, which they deno∣minate <HI>Erlocrsortok,</HI> signifying a gutter, because he is thought to gut the dead, and feed on their intestines. He is represented as having a lean meagre body, haggard, hollow eyes, and a ghastly countenance. According to their mythology, all the elements are filled with spirits; from among which every Angekut is supplied with a familiar, called <HI>Torngak,</HI> who is always ready when sum∣moned to his assistance. The person who aspires to the office of Angekut, retires to some unfre∣quented place, where he invokes the spirit Torn∣garsuk; which appears to him in such a terrible form, that he sickens, swoons, dies, and conti∣nues bereft of life for three days: then he revives, and returns to his own home, inspired by the spirit of conjuration. These impostors pretend to cure diseases by spells and charms; to commune with the god Torngarsuk, and promulgate his commands; to visit heaven occasionally, and de∣scend to the court of Torngarsuk in the lower regions. In a word, they play a thousand jug∣gling tricks to puzzle and deceive their poor ig∣norant fellow-creatures, over whom they acquire such influence, that they act with the most despotic authority, both as priests and legislators. It would be tedious, and unentertaining, to recount all the ridiculous fables which these Angekuts have in∣vented for the purposes of deceit, concerning the creation of man, the origin of fishes, the state of
<PB N="51" REF="600"/>
departed souls, the grandeur of Torngarsuk, the sun, moon, stars, and planets, the cause of rain and thunder. Suffice it to say, they are utterly ignorant of science and natural philosophy; yet they observe the stars enough to steer by them at sea. They measure time by months, beginning the year at the sun's first rising above the horizon in the winter; and by every month they know ex∣actly the season of the different fishes, fowls, and animals, so as to direct their avocations.</P>

<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The commodities of Groenland consist of whale∣bone and blubber, train-oil, the horns of sea∣unicorns, the skins of rein-deer, seals, and foxes. These commodities they exchange with the Danes for coats, shirts, and stockings, knives, hand saws, needles, angling-hooks, looking-glasses, beads, and other toys, rafts, poles, deal-boards, chests, kettles of brass and copper, tin-dishes, and plates. On the southern side, the cod and salmon fishery, if properly preserved, might yield considerable ad∣vantage.</P>

<HEAD>NORWAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE North Cape, antiently called <HI>Rutu∣bae Promontorium,</HI> situated in the island of Maggero, about five degrees and a half beyond the Polar Circle, is the farthest extremity of Norway, inhabited by the Finmarks or Laplanders, a savage people, to whom Nature seems to have acted as a severe step-mother; whether we consider their external form, their brutality, their want of necessa∣ries, or their situation amidst dreary mountains, woods, and deserts covered with the keenest frost and drifting snows in the winter, and swarm∣ing in the summer with myriads of vermin, much more intolerable than all the horrors of intense cold and famine. As the country, which these wretched people inhabit, is divided into three separate portions, appended to the dominions of Denmark, Sweden, and Russia, we shall insert a particular account of them in the article of Swedish Lapland, and begin our work with a de∣scription of the other parts of Norway, inhabited by a different nation.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="53" REF="620"/>
<HEAD>SITUATION.</HEAD>
<P>Norway lies between the fifty-seventh and se∣venty-second degrees of north latitude, and between the fifth and thirty-first degrees of longitude, east from London; extending in length about one thousand miles, in a direct line from Lindesnaes, in the diocese of Christiansand, to the North Cape, at the extremity of Finmark. Its breadth, from the frontiers of Sweden westward to Cape Statt, may amount to about three hundred miles; but from thence the country becomes gradually nar∣rower towards the north. On the south it is bounded by the Schagen-rack, or Categate, the entrance into the Baltic: on the east it is divided from Sweden by a long ridge of high mountains; and on the west and north it is washed by the northern ocean.</P>
<P>The coast of Norway, extending above three hundred leagues, is studded with a multitude of small islands, affording habitation to fishermen and pilots, and pasture to a few cattle. They form an infinite number of narrow channels, and a natural barrier of rocks, which renders Norway inaccessible to the naval power of its enemies. Attempts of this kind are the more dangerous, as the shore is generally bold, steep, and impending; so that close to the rocks the depth of the sea amounts to one, two, or three hundred fathoms. The perils of the north sea are moreover increased by sudden storms, sunk rocks, violent currents, and dreadful whirlpools. The most remarkable vortex on this coast is called Moskoestrom, from the small island Moskoe, belonging to the district of Lofoden, in the province of Nordland. In time of flood, the stream runs up between Lofoden and Moskoe with the most boisterous rapidity; but in its ebb to the sea, it roars like a thousand cataracts, so as to be
<PB N="54" REF="630"/>
heard at the distance of many leagues. The sur∣face exhibits different vortices; and if in one of these any ship or vessel is absorbed, it is whirled down to the bottom, and dashed in pieces against the rocks. These violent whirlpools continue with∣out intervals, except for a quarter of an hour, at high and low water, in calm weather; for the boiling gradually returns as the flood or ebb ad∣vances. When its fury is heightened by a storm, no vessel ought to venture within a league of it. Whales have been frequently absorbed within the vortex, and howled and bellowed hideously in their fruitless endeavours to disengage themselves. A bear, in attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was once hurried into this whirlpool, from whence he struggled in vain for deliverance, roar∣ing so loud as to be heard on shore; but, notwith∣standing all his efforts, he was borne down and de∣stroyed. Large trees being absorbed by the cur∣rent, are sucked down, and rise again all shattered into splinters. There are three vortices of the same kind near the islands of Ferroe.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>Norway is divided into the four governments of Aggerhus, Bergen, Drontheim, and Wardhus, be∣sides that of Bahus, which is now subject to Sweden. The province of Aggerhus comprehends the south-east part of Norway, extending in length about three hundred miles. Its chief towns are Christia∣nia, the see of a bishop, suffragan to the metropo∣litan see of Drontheim, where the sovereign court of justice is held, in presence of the viceroy, and the governor of the province; Aggerhus, about fifteen miles to the south-west of Christiania; Fre∣derickshall, or Frederickstadt, in the siege of which Charles XII. of Sweden lost his life by a cannon∣ball;
<PB N="55" REF="640"/>
Saltzberg, Tonsberg, Alleen, Hammar, and Hollen.</P>
<P>The government of Bergen lies in the most southerly and westerly part of Norway, including the city of the same name, which is an episcopal see, and a place of considerable trade; and Staff∣hanger, situated in the bay of Buckenfior, about eighty miles to the southward of Bergen. The third province, called Drontheim or Trontheim, extends about five hundred miles along the coast; and is but thinly peopled. The chief town Dron∣theim, seated on a little gulph at the mouth of the river Nider, is the only metropolitan see in Nor∣way; and carries on a considerable trade in masts, deals, tar, copper, and iron. Leetsttrand, Stron∣den, Scoerdale, Opdal, Romsdael, and Solendael, are likewise places of some traffic. The northern division of Drontheim, called the sub-government of Salten, comprehends the towns of Melanger and Scheen. The province of Wardhus, extend∣ing to the North Cape, and including the islands, is divided into two parts; namely, Finmark and Norwegian Lapland. The chief town, which is very inconsiderable, stands upon an island, called Ward, from whence the place and the government derive their name. The province of Bahus, though now yielded to the Swedes, is reckoned part of Norway, being a narrow tract of land, about ninety miles in length, lying on the coast of the Categate.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>The great chain of Norway mountains, running from north to south, called indifferently Rudfield, Sudefield, Skarsfield, and Scoreberg, is known in different parts by other appellations; such as Do∣frefield,
<PB N="56" REF="650"/>
Lamsfield, Sagnefield, Filefield, Halne∣field, Hardangerfield, Jocklefield, Byglefield, Hicklefield, and Hangfield. The heighth and breadth of this extensive chain likewise vary in different parts. To pass the mountain Hardanger, a man must travel about seventy English miles; whereas Filefield may be about fifty over. This last rises about two miles and a half in perpendi∣cular height: but Dofrefield is counted the highest mountain of Norway, if not of Europe. The river Drivane winds along the side of it in a serpentine course, so as to be met nine times by those who travel the winter-road to the other side of the chain. The bridges are thrown over roaring cataracts, and but indifferently fastened to the steep rocks on either side; so that the whole exhibits a very dreadful appearance, sufficient to deter the traveller from hazarding such a dangerous passage: for which reason, people generally choose the road over File∣field, which is much more tedious. This, how∣ever, is the post-road used by the king's carriages. The way is distinguished by posts fixed at the dis∣tance of two hundred paces from each other, that, in snowy or dark weather, the traveller may not be bewildered. For the convenience of resting and refreshing, there are two mountain-stoves or houses maintained on Filefield, as well as upon other mountains, at the expence of the publick, and furnished with fire, light, and kitchen utensils. Nothing can be more dismal and dreary than these mountains, covered with eternal snow, where neither house, tree, nor living creature is to be seen, but here and there a solitary rein-deer, and perchance a few wandering Laplanders.</P>
<P>In travelling from Sweden to Nordenfields, there is only one way of avoiding this chain of moun∣tains; and that is, where it is interrupted by a long
<PB N="57" REF="660"/>
deep valley, extending from Romsdale to Guld∣brandsdale. In the year 1612, a body of one thou∣sand Scots, commanded by Sinclair, and sent over as auxiliaries to the Swedes, were put to the sword in this defile, by the peasants of Guldbrand, who never give quarter.</P>
<P>Besides this chain, there is a great number of detached mountains over all the country, that form valleys and ridges, inhabited by the peasants. Some of these are of incredible height, and others exhibit very remarkable appearances. In sailing up Joering Creek, on the left hand, the sight is astonished with a groupe of mountains, resembling the prospect of a city, with old Gothick towers and edifices. In the parish of Oerskong is the high mountain Skopshorn, the top of which represents the figure of a fortification, with regular walls and bastions. In the district of Hilgeland appears a very high range of mountains, with seven pin∣nacles or crests, known by the appellation of the Seven Sisters, discernible a great way off at sea. To the southward of this range, though in the same district, rises the famous mountain Torghat∣ten, so called because the summit resembles a man's head with a hat on, under which appears a single eye, formed by an aperture through the mountain, one hundred and fifty ells high, and three thousand ells in length. The sun may be seen through this surprising cavity, which is passable by the foot of travellers. On the top of the mountain we find a reservoir of water, as large as a moderate fish-pond: in the lower part is a cavern, through which a line, four hundred fathoms in length, being let down, did not reach the bottom. At Herroe in Sund∣moer is another cavern, called Dolsteen, supposed to reach under the sea to Scotland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, however, is no more than an idle tradition.</NOTE>. In the year
<PB N="58" REF="670"/>
1750, two clergymen entered this subterranean cavity, and proceeded a considerable way, until they heard the sea dashing over their heads: the passage was as wide and high as an ordinary church, the sides perpendicular, and the roof vaulted. They descended one flight of natural stairs; but, arriving at another, they were afraid to penetrate farther: they had gone so far, how∣ever, that two candles were consumed in their pro∣gress and return. A cavern of a very curious na∣ture, serving as a conduit to a stream of water, penetrates through the sides of the mountain Li∣mur. In the district of Rake, in the neighbour∣hood of Frederickshall, are three cavities in a rock; one of which is so deep, that a small stone dropped down, does not reach the bottom in less than two minutes; and then the sound it produces is pleasant and melodious, not unlike the sound of a bell.</P>
<P>The vast mountains and rugged rocks that de∣form the face of this country, are productive of numberless inconveniences. They admit of little arable ground: they render the country in some parts impassable, and every where difficult to tra∣vellers: they afford shelter to wild beasts, which come from their lurking holes, and make terrible havock among the flocks of cattle: they expose the sheep and goats, as well as the peasant, to daily accidents of falling over precipices: they occasion sudden torrents, and falls of snow, that descend with incredible impetuosity, and often sweep away the labours of the husbandman; and they are sub∣ject to dreadful disruptions, by which huge rocks are rent from their sides, and, hurling down, over∣whelm the plains below with inevitable ruin. The peasants frequently build their houses on the edge of a steep precipice, to which they must climb by ladders, at the hazard of their lives; and when a person dies, the corpse must be let down with ropes,
<PB N="59" REF="680"/>
before it can be laid in the coffin. In winter the mail is often drawn up the sides of steep moun∣tains. Even in the king's road, travellers are ex∣posed to the frequent risques of falling over those dreadful rocks; for they are obliged to pass over narrow pathways, without rails or rising on the sides, either shored up with rotten posts, or sus∣pended by iron bolts, fastened in the mountains. In the narrow pass of Naeroe is a remarkable way of this kind, which, above six hundred years ago, the famous king Suerre caused to be made for the passage of his cavalry; and even this would have been found impassable by any other horses than those of Norway, which are used to climb the rocks like goats. Another very difficult and dangerous road is that between Shogstadt and Vang in Vol∣ders, along the side of a steep mountain, in some places so narrow, that if two travellers on horse∣back should meet in the night, they would find it impracticable either to pass each other, or turn back. In such a case their lives could not be saved, unless one of them should alight, and throw his horse headlong into the lake below, and then cling to the rock, until the other could pass. When a sheep or goat makes a false step to the projection of a rock, from whence it can neither ascend nor descend, the owner hazards his own life to preserve that of the animal. He directs himself to be lowered down from the top of the mountain, sitting on a cross stick, tied to the end of a long rope; and when he arrives at the place where the creature stands, he fastens it to the same cord, and it is drawn up with himself. Perhaps the other end of the rope is held by one person only; and there are some instances in which the assistant has been dragged down by the weight of his friend, so that both have perished. When either man or beast has had the misfortune to fall over very high pre∣cipices,
<PB N="60" REF="690"/>
they have not only been suffocated by the repercussion of the air, but their bodies have been always burst before they reached the ground. Sometimes intire crests of rocks, many fathoms in length and breadth, have fallen down at once, creating such a violent agitation of the air as seemed a prelude to the world's dissolution. At Steenbroc in Laerdale, a stupendous mass, larger than any castle in the universe, appears to have been severed and tumbled from the mountain in large, sharp, and ragged fragments, through which the river roars with hideous bellowing. In the year 1731, a promontory on Sundmoer, called Rammersfield, that hung over Nordal Creek, suddenly gave way, and plunged into the water; which swelled to such a degree, that the church of Strand, though half a league on the other side of the bank, was over∣flowed: the creek, however, was not filled up; on the contrary, the fishermen declare they find no difference in the depth, which is said to exceed nine hundred fathoms.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>The remarkable rivers of Norway are these: the Nied, issuing from Tydalen, on the borders of Sweden, runs westward into the lake Selboe; and afterwards, turning to the northward, passes by the city of Drontheim, to which it antiently gave the name of Nideros and Nidrosia: Sule Ely, that, descending from Sulefield, runs with a rapid course through Nordale into the sea: Gulen, which rises near Skarsfield in the north; and running twenty leagues westward, through Aalen, Hlotaalen, Sto∣ren, and Melhuus, discharges itself into the sea, about a league to the west of Drontheim. In the year 1344, this river buried itself under ground; from whence it again burst forth with such vio∣lence, that the earth and stones thrown up by the
<PB N="61" REF="700"/>
eruption, filled the valley, and formed a dam, which, however, was soon broken and washed away by the force of the water. Divers churches, eight and forty farm-houses, with two hundred and fifty persons, were destroyed on this occasion. Otte∣roen, a large river, taking its rise from the moun∣tain Agde, runs about thirty leagues through Seet∣terdale and Efie, and disembogues itself into the cataract of Wiland. The river Syre rises near the mountain Lang, and winds its course through the vale of Syre into the lake of Lunde, in the diocese of Christiansand: thence it continues its way to the sea, into which it discharges itself through a nar∣row strait formed by two rocks. This contraction augments its impetuosity, so that it shoots like an arrow into the sea, in which it produces a very great agitation. Nid and Sheen are two considerable rivers, issuing out of Tillemark. Their water∣falls have been diverted, with infinite labour, by canals and passages cut through the rocks, for the convenience of floating down the timber. Tyre∣fiord, or Dramme, is in the neighbourhood of Ho∣nifosse, joined by two rivers from Oedale and Ha∣deland, and disembogues itself into the sea, near Bragness. Loven rises in the highest part of Num∣medal, and runs through Kongsberg to the sea near Laurwig. Glaamen is the largest river of Norway, distinguished by the name of Stor-Elven, or the great river. It derives its origin from the moun∣tain Dofre, from whence it winds all along the plains of Oesterdale and Soloe; then joins the Vorme, another considerable river rising out of Mioes and Guldsbrandsdale. These being joined, traverse the lake Oeyeren; and thence issuing, run on to Sarp near Frederickstadt.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LAKES.</HEAD>
<P>Norway abounds with fresh-water lakes, the principal of which are, Rysvand in Nordland,
<PB N="62" REF="710"/>
Snaasen, Selboe, the greater and lesser Mioes, Slirevand, Sperdille, Rand, Vesten, Saren, Mo∣dum, Lund, Norsoe, Huidsoe, Farisvand, and Oe∣yevand: all these are well stocked with fish, and navigable for large vessels. Wars have been for∣merly maintained on these inland seas; in some of which are small floating islands, or parcels of earth, with trees on them, separated from the main land, and probably preserved in compact masses by the roots of trees, shrubs, and grass, interwoven in the soil. In the year 1702, the family-seat of Borge, near Frederickstadt, being a noble edifice, with lofty towers and battlements, suddenly sunk into an abyss one hundred fathoms in depth, which was instantaneously filled with a piece of water, form∣ing a lake three hundred ells in length, and about half as broad. Fourteen persons, with two hun∣dred head of cattle, perished in this catastrophe, which was occasioned by the river Glaamen preci∣pitating itself down a water-fall near Sarp, and undermining the foundation. Of all the water∣falls in Norway, this of Sarp is the most dangerous for its height and rapidity. The current drives seventeen mills; and roars along with such vio∣lence, that the water, being dashed and commi∣nuted among the rocks, rises in the form of rain, where a beautiful rainbow may be always seen when the sun shines. In antient times this cataract was used for the execution of traitors, and other male∣factors: they were thrown down alive, that they might be dashed in pieces on the points of rocks, and die in a dreadful commotion, analogous to those they had endeavoured to excite in the com∣munity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>Great part of Norway is covered with forests of wood, which constitute the principal article of
<PB N="63" REF="720"/>
commerce in this country. They chiefly consist of fir and pine, for which great sums are received from foreigners, who export an immense number of masts, beams, planks, and boards. Besides, an incredible quantity is consumed at home, in building houses, ships, bridges, piles, moles, and fences, over and above the vast demand for char∣coal to the founderies, and fuel for domestic uses. Nay, in some places, the trees are felled for no other purpose but to clear the ground, and be burned into ashes for manure. A good quantity of timber is yearly exported from the western coast to Scotland and Spain: but this is inconsiderable, when compared to the immense exports from Dram∣men, Frederickshall, Frederickstadt, Christiania, Skeen, Arendal, Christiansand, Christian's Bay, and Drontheim. The masts and large beams are floated down the rivers, and the rest is divided into boards at the saw-mills. These works supply an infinite number of families with a comfortable subsistence: a tenth of all sawed timber belongs to his Danish majesty, and makes a considerable branch of his revenue. The forests in Norway are so vast and thick, that the people seem to think there can never be a scarcity of wood, especially as the soil is peculiarly adapted for the production of timber: they therefore destroy it with a wasteful hand; in∣somuch that more wood rots in Norway, than is burned in the whole kingdom of Denmark. The best timber grows in the provinces of Saltan, Helle∣land, Romsdale, Guldbrandsdale, Oesterdale, Soloe, Valders, Hallingdal, Sognifiord, Tellemark, and the lordship of Nedene.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The climate and atmosphere of Norway are va∣rious in different parts of the kingdom. At Ber∣gen the winter is so moderate, that the seas are
<PB N="64" REF="730"/>
always open and practicable both to mariners and fishermen, except in creeks and bays, that reach far up into the country towards Filefield, when the keen north-east wind blows from the land. On the east-side of Norway, from the frontiers of Swe∣den to Filefield, the cold generally sets in about the middle of October with great severity, and lasts till the middle of April; during which interval the waters are frozen to a considerable thickness, and the face of the country is covered with snow. In the year 1719, seven thousand Swedes, who intended to attack Drontheim, perished in the snow on the mountain of Ruden or Tydal, which separates Jempteland in Sweden from the diocese of Dron∣theim. A company of two hundred Norwegian sledgemen, under major Emahus, found them all frozen to death on the ridge of the mountain, where they had been surprised by a storm accom∣panied with snow, hail, and extreme cold. Some of those unhappy victims appeared sitting, some lying, and others kneeling in a posture of praying. They had cut in pieces their muskets, and burned the little wood they afforded. The generals La∣barre and Zoega lost their lives; and of the whole body, consisting originally of ten thousand, not above two thousand five hundred survived this dreadful ca∣tastrophe. This hard weather enabbles the peasants to convey the timber they have felled to the next rivers, along which they likewise carry their corn, butter, and other commodities to market upon sledges.</P>
<P>The cold is still more intense in that part of Norway called Finmark, situated in the Frigid Zone, near the Polar Circle. But, if the winter is generally cold, the summer is often excessively hot in Norway. The rays of the sun are rever∣berated from the sides of the mountains, so as to render the weather close and sultry in the vallies: besides, the sun's absence below the horizon, is so
<PB N="65" REF="740"/>
short, that the atmosphere and mountains have not time to cool. The heat is so great, that all vegetation is remarkably quick. Barley is sown, grows, ripens, and is reaped in the space of six weeks, or two months.</P>
<P>With respect to light, the longest day at Ber∣gen consists of nineteen hours; the sun rising at half an hour after two, and setting at half an hour after nine. The shortest day does not ex∣ceed six hours; for the sun rises at nine in the morning, and sets about three in the afternoon. In the beginning of the year, the day-light increases with remarkable celerity, and at the approach of winter decreases in the same proportion; phaeno∣mena owing to the earth's inclination towards the Poles. In summer, one may read and write at midnight by the light of the sky. Christian V. while he resided at Drontheim, used to sup at mid∣night without candles. In the district of Tromsen, at the extremity of Norway, the sun is continually in view at midsummer. It is seen to circulate day and night round the North Pole, contracting its orbit, and then gradually enlarging it, until at length it leaves the horizon. In the depth of win∣ter, therefore, it is for some weeks invisible; and all the light perceived at noon is a faint glimmer∣ing for about an hour and an half, proceeding from the reflection of the sun's rays on the highest moun∣tains. But the inhabitants of these northern pro∣vinces are supplied with other lights, that enable them to exercise their fishery and other employ∣ments in the open air. The sky being generally serene, the moonshire is remarkably bright, and, being reflected from the mountains, illuminates the vallies: the people are moreover assisted by the north light, called Aurora Borealis, which is very frequent in the northern parts of Europe.</P>
<P>The air of Norway, with respect to health, is gene∣rally pure and salubrious. On the sea coasts, indeed,
<PB N="66" REF="750"/>
it is rendered moist by vapours and exhalations: but, in the midland parts of the country, towards the mountains, the climate is so dry and purified, that meal may be kept for many years, without being worm-eaten or damaged in the least. The inha∣bitants have no idea of sickness, except that which is contracted from excesses. It is said, that in the vale of Guldbrand the peasants live to such extreme old age, that they become weary of life, and cause themselves to be removed to a less salubrious cli∣mate, whereby they may have a chance for dying the sooner. In consumptions, however, the moist air on the sea-side is found more agreeable to the lungs in respiration. Norway, being a mountain∣ous country, intersected by creeks, abounding with lakes, rivers, and snow, must be subject to fre∣quent rains. From sudden thaws, the inhabitants are sometimes exposed to terrible disasters. Vast masses of snow, falling from precipices, overwhelm men, cattle, boats, houses, nay, even whole vil∣lages. About two centuries ago a whole parish, situated between Quindhorret and Hardanger, was by a snow-fall covered and destroyed. Several domestic utensils, as scissars, knives, and basons, have been at different times brought to light by a rivulet that runs under the snow, which has been gradually hardened and increased by repeated frosts and annual accessions.</P>
<P>The winds that chiefly prevail on the western coast, are those that blow from the south; where∣as, on the other side of Filefield, the winds that produce and continue the hard frosts, are al∣ways northerly. In the summer there is a kind of regular trade-wind on the coast of Bergen. In the forenoon the sea begins to be cooled with a westerly breeze, which continues till mid∣night: then the land-breeze begins from the east, and blows till about ten in the morning. The
<PB N="67" REF="760"/>
coast is likewise subject to sudden squalls and storms. Hurricanes sometimes rise at sea; and in these lati∣tudes the phaenomenon called a Water-spout, is not uncommon. One of these vortices, in the neighbourhood of Ferro, is said to have sucked up with the water some lasts of herrings, which were afterwards dropped on Kolter, a mountain twelve hundred feet high.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>WATER.</HEAD>
<P>The fresh water of Norway is not very light nor pure; but, on the contrary, it is generally turbid, deposits a sediment of adventitious matter, and is impregnated often with oker and particles of iron: nevertheless, it is agreeable to the taste, and re∣markably salubrious, as appears from the good health and longevity of the common people, who drink little or no other liquor.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>The soil of Norway varies in different places, according to the situation of rock or valley. The mountains here, as in every other country, are bare and barren: but the spoils of them, washed down by torrents, snow and rain, enrich and fertilize the valleys. In these the soil generally consists of black mould, sand, loom, chalk, and gravel, lying over each other in unequal strata, and sometimes in three or four successions: the mould that lies up∣permost is very fine and mellow, and fit to nourish all sorts of vegetables. There is also clay found in different parts of this kingdom, of which the in∣habitants begin to make earthen ware; but bricks and tiles are not used in building. The face of the country is, in many places, deformed by large swamps and marshes, very dangerous to the tra∣veller. Near Leessoe, in the diocese of Christian∣sand,
<PB N="68" REF="770"/>
a wooden causeway is extended near a mile over a morass; and if a horse, or any other animal, should make a false step, he will sink at once into the abyss, never to rise again.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRODUCTIONS: VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<P>In a cold country, like Norway, roughened with rocks and mountains, interspersed with bogs, and covered with forests, we cannot expect to find agri∣culture in perfection. The plowed lands, in respect to mountains, woods, meadows, and wastes, do not exceed the proportion of one to eighty; so that the whole country does not produce corn to maintain above half the number of its inhabitants. The peasants are discouraged from the practice of hus∣bandry, by the frequency of accidents that seem peculiar to the climate. Even in the most fruitful provinces of Guldbrandsdale, Oesterdale, and Soloer, as well as in other places, when the corn appears in the most flourishing condition, the whole hope of the harvest is sometimes destroyed in one night by a sudden frost, that nips the blade and extin∣guishes the vegetation. The kingdom is more∣over visited by some unfavourable years, in which the sun seems to have lost his genial power; the vegetables are stunted; the trees bud and bloom, yet bear no fruit; and the grain, though it rises, will produce nought but empty ears and straw. This calamity, however, rarely occurs; and, in general, the cultivated parts of Norway yield plen∣tiful crops of excellent rye, barley, and oats. The most fruitful provinces are Nordland, Inderberre, and Numedale, in the diocese of Drontheim; Sog¦nifiord and Vaas, in that of Bergen; Jedderen, Ryefylk, Raabygdelag, and the lordship of Ne∣denes, in the diocese of Christiansand; Hedemark, in the diocese of Aggerhuus; Hadeland, Toten, Romerige, Ringerige, and Guldbrandsdale: these
<PB N="69" REF="780"/>
territories not only produce grain enough for their own consumption, but likewise support their neigh∣bours, and even supply part of Sweden. Peas are likewise propagated in this country, together with wheat, buck-wheat, hops, hemp, and flax; but not to any considerable advantage. The meadows are liberally stored with rich pasturage for sheep and cattle, and the fields are productive of those vegetables which are common in other northern countries. Among the other kinds of grass here found, is what botanists call <HI>viola canina,</HI> with short broad leaves; a plant which contributed, in a very surprising manner, to the preservation of two Nor∣way youths in the year 1652. These brothers, on the first day of August, made an excursion from their father's house, of about twenty English miles, to enjoy the diversions of shooting and fishing, in the mountains that separate Guldbrandsdale from the province of Valders. After having stayed four days fishing in the lake of Rif, they rowed in a skiff to a very small island of this lake, about six∣teen paces in length. Here while they remained, the skiff broke loose, in consequence of a sudden squall, and was driven to the other shore, where their dog stood waiting for his masters. As neither of the youths could swim, they saw themselves thus abandoned to famine, on a desolate island, sequestered from all intercourse with mankind. Their first care was to build a kind of hut of small stones, that they might, in some degree, be screened from the inclemency of the weather. Towards the close of the second day, their appetite being whetted to the keenest sense of hunger, they industriously sought some vegetable food, and ventured to eat the <HI>viola canina,</HI> each to the amount of an ounce, twice a day; and this was all they could find at one search. Their stomachs were eased, their spirits refreshed, and the acute pains which had begun to
<PB N="70" REF="790"/>
seize their arms and shoulders, immediately abated. Eleven days did they subsist on this vegetable; but it failed on the twelfth, and they were reduced to the brink of despair, when they accidentally found a little spot overgrown with sorrel, which they con∣sumed at one meal: nevertheless, it was reproduced in less than four and twenty hours; and the devout young men, with tears of gratitude, and due ac∣knowledgments to heaven, owned it as an interpo∣sition of Providence in their behalf. During the first days of their suffering, they had called and beckoned to their dog, and used every possible al∣lurement to induce that animal to swim over, that they might kill him for their subsistence; but he would not obey their signals. They were now re∣duced to such a weak condition, that they could not stand, and hardly made shift to creep from their hut in quest of the sorrel. The eldest was seized with a violent palpitation of the heart, which throbbed so loud as to be heard at some distance, and he appeared to be in extremity. The younger, with his knife, engraved upon a piece of timber a short account of their unhappy fate, and pointed out a text in the Psalms, on which he requested that their funeral sermon might be preached. Then they joined in fervent prayer, and, embracing one another, resigned themselves to death without mur∣muring. Their dog had tarried eight days with their baggage on the shore, and then returned to their father's house, where he refused food; but howled and moaned incessantly. From the grief of this faithful animal, the parents concluded that their children had met with some misfortune, and dispatched a man in search of them to the moun∣tain. He arrived on the eleventh day at the lake, where he found their cloaths, and, concluding they were drowned, returned with these melancholy tidings. On the thirteenth day of their famine,
<PB N="71" REF="800"/>
the youths, having by this time given up all hope of relief, heard the sound of horses travelling up the mountains. They forthwith raised their voices, and, being heard, the travellers hastened to their assistance. The skiff being happily found on the shore undamaged, the humane strangers put off to the little island, where they found the brothers al∣most exhausted. When food was offered to the elder brother, his stomach could hardly bear the smallest portion; and after he was conveyed to his father's house, he continued some days in a very dangerous disorder; of which however he reco∣vered, and survived this disaster seven and thirty years. The other soon retrieved his strength and health; and in the year 1691 drew up this narra∣tion, as a pious acknowledgment of God's pro∣vidence.</P>
<P>Within these forty years the people of Norway have bestowed some attention to the culture of gardens, which in former times was so neglected, that the cities and towns were supplied with leeks, cabbage, and roots from England and Holland. At present, however, the Norwegians raise their own culinary and garden roots and vegetables, which thrive there as well as in any other country. Among the plants that grow wild in this kingdom, there are some said to be peculiar to the soil; such as a species of the <HI>nummularia sylvestris,</HI> of which the inhabitants drink an infusion like tea, as a noble pectoral; the <HI>piper aquaticum</HI> of Lange, and many others, which are not to be found in any Herbal. The scurvy being a disease that prevails on the sea∣coast, Nature has scattered all along it a variety of herbs, efficacious in the cure of that distemper; such as angelica, rose-wort, gentian, cresses, tre∣foils, sorrels, scurvy-grass, and a plant called erich's grass, that grows in great plenty on the islands of Northland; from whence the people of the con∣tinent
<PB N="72" REF="810"/>
fetch away boat-loads of it, to be preserved in barrels, as a succedaneum for cabbage. There are also a few noxious vegetables, little known in any other country but Norway. In Guldbrandsdale is a species of grass, called selsnape; the root of which is so poisonous, that any beast which eats of it dies immediately, the belly bursting: nay, the carnivorous fowls that prey upon the carcase of the beast, meet with the same fate. Children have been more than once poisoned by taking this root, which nevertheless is sometimes used externally, as an amulet for arthritic disorders. Another ve∣getable, pernicious to the cattle, is the <HI>gramen ossi∣fragum Norwegiense,</HI> which is said to mollify the benes of those animals by whom it is eaten. Among the noxious plants of Norway we may also rank the igle-grass, fatal to sheep and goats; the tour-grass, which affects horses and cows with a toroor or lethargy; and the plant torboe, or histe∣spring, which produces nearly the same effect on horses, but is not at all prejudicial to cows, sheep, or any ruminating animals. The herb turte, not unlike angelica, operates nearly in the same man∣ner: yet the bears are said to feed upon it with peculiar relish; and when their hair begins to fall off, in consequence of eating this plant, they have recourse for relief to the flesh of animals.</P>
<P>The common fruit-trees thrive tolerably well in Norway, the inhabitants of which have plenty of cherries, apples, and pears. Some kinds of plumbs attain to maturity, which is very seldom the case with grapes, apricots, and peaches: but even the apples and pears that ripen here are summer-fruit: that which grows till the winter, seldom comes to per∣fection. Great variety of agreeable berries are pro∣duced in different parts of this kingdom; such as the hagebar, a kind of sloes, an infusion of which in wine makes a pleasant cooling liquor; juniper-berries, co∣rinths,
<PB N="73" REF="820"/>
red and white; soelbar, or sun-berries; rasp∣berries, gooseberries, blackberries, barberries, bil∣burnes, cranberries, strawberries, and many other spe∣cies, that seem to be natives of Norway and Sweden. Among these are the tranaeber, the produce of the myrtillus repens, red and austere, found in the spring in perfection under the snow, and much re∣lished by the rein-deer; crakebeer, resembling bil∣berries, deemed a powerful anti-scorbutic; ager∣beer, larger and blacker than bilberries, of a plea∣sant acid, ripened by cold, and used as cherries for an infusion in wine: and, finally, tyltebeer, a red pleasant berry, growing on a short stem, with leaves like those of box: they are plucked off by hand∣fulls, and sent to Denmark to be preserved for the table, where they are eaten by way of desert.</P>
<P>Of the trees that grow wild in Norway, the principal are the fir and the pine. The first yields an annual revenue, amounting to a million of rix∣dollars, if we include the advantages resulting from the saw-mills and the masts; one of which last has been known to sell for two hundred rix∣dollars. The red fir-tree, which grows on the mountains, is so rich in turpentine as to be almost incorruptible. Some of the houses belonging to the Norway peasants, built of this timber, are sup∣posed to be above four hundred years standing. In Guldbrandsdale the house is still to be seen stand∣ing in which king Olaf lodged five nights, above seven hundred years ago, when he travelled round the kingdom to convert the people to the christian faith. Even an hundred years after the trunk of the fir-tree has been cut down, the peasants burn the roots for tar, which is a very profitable com∣modity. In the fens, the resin of the fir-tree is by nature transformed into a substance, which may be termed Norway frankincense. The buds or pine∣apples of this tree, boiled in stale beer, make an
<PB N="74" REF="830"/>
excellent medicine for the scurvy; not so unplea∣sant to the taste, though counted as efficacious as tar-water. The pine-tree is more tall and beauti∣ful than the fir; but far inferior to it in strength and quality: therefore the boards or planks of it are sold at a lower rate, and the peasant wastes it without remorse. Norway likewise produces some forests of oak, which is found to be excellent for ship-building. Here also we find the elm, whose bark, being powdered, is boiled up with other food to fatten hogs, and even mixed by the poor among their meal; the ash, from which the peasants distil a balsam used in certain disorders, both externally and internally; barlind, a kind of yew; beenved, a species of the privet, very hard and solid; birch, that in a surprising manner resists putrefaction, and yields a wholsome juice, not inferior to palm-wine; beech, alder, juniper; from the fruit of which last a valuable oil is extracted; the asper, the cornel, the bullace or sloe, the hazle, which grows here in such abundance, that an hundred ton of nuts are yearly exported from Bergen alone; the elder, the lime, the maple, the spina christi, the wild prune∣tree, and the axel, another of the same species, peculiar to Norway and Sweden. The bottom of the Norwegian sea affords also a variety of sub∣marine weeds, trees, corals, and corallines.</P>

<HEAD>STONES.</HEAD>
<P>A diversity of stones is found in Norway, and some of a surprising texture. Several mountains chiefly consist of a brown pebble, which decays with age; nay, it dissolves, and sometimes drops into the sea: the cement being thus loosened, a terrible disruption often ensues. In some places, the grey and black pebbles are intermixed with iron, copper, lead, silver, and gold. The ground, in certain districts, is covered with the fragments
<PB N="75" REF="840"/>
of rocks, that have been precipitated from the summits of mountains, and broken in their fall into innumerable shivers. About twenty years ago, in the neighbourhood of Bergen, a man was suddenly overwhelmed with such a mass, which formed a kind of vault around him. In this dread∣ful tomb he remained alive for several weeks: by his loud cries, the place of his confinement was discovered; but it was found impracticable to re∣move the huge stones by which he was inclosed. All that his friends could do for his relief, was to lower down meat and drink to him, through some crevices; but, at length, the stones fell in and crushed him to death.</P>
<P>Here are inexhaustible quarries of excellent marble, black, white, blue, grey, and variegated; together with some detached pieces of alabaster, several kinds of spar, chalk-stone, cement-stone, sand-stone, mill-stone, baking-stone, slate, talc, the magnet or load-stone, found in the iron-mines; swine-stone, a production natural to Norway and Sweden, of a brown colour, fetid smell, in texture resembling crystal, and deriving its name from its efficacy in a distemper incident to swine; amian∣thus, or asbestos, the stone-flax or stone-silk, con∣sisting of fine fibres or threads, which are spun and woven into a kind of cloth: this, when soiled, is made clean by being thrown into the fire. Nor∣way affords no flint; but plenty of pyrites or quartz, beautiful crystals, granates, amethysts, agate, thunder-stones, and eagle-stones.</P>

<HEAD>METALS AND MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>The subterranean mineral treasures of Norway are immense. Gold has been heretofore found, in a small quantity, in the diocese of Christiansand, and coined into ducats. There is at present a very considerable silver mine worked at Kongsberg, on
<PB N="76" REF="850"/>
the account and risque of his Danish majesty: the ore is surprisingly rich, but interrupted in such a manner, that the vein is often lost. Many masses of pure silver have been found; and among the rest one piece weighing five hundred and sixty pounds, preserved in the royal musaeum at Copen∣hagen. Such is the almost incredible richness of these mines, that the annual produce amounts in value to a ton and a half of gold. About five thousand persons are daily employed, and earn their subsistence, in these stupendous works. Other silver mines are prosecuted at Jarlsberg, but not to the same advantage; and here the ore is mixed with lead and copper. In many parts of this coun∣try copper mines have been discovered; but the principal, and perhaps the richest in all Europe, is at Roraas, about an hundred English miles from Drontheim. This work yields annually about eleven hundred ship-pounds of pure copper: the founderies belonging to it consume yearly about fourteen thousand lasts of coal, and five hundred fathoms of wood. The next, in importance, is the copper-work at Lykken, about twenty miles from Drontheim. A third mine is carried on at Indset, or Quickne, at the distance of thirty miles from the same place; and here they precipitate the cop∣per from its menstruum, by means of iron. There is a fourth copper-work at Silboe, about thirty miles distant from Drontheim, though the least considerable of the four. Other copper mines of less note are worked in different parts of the king∣dom. Iron is still in greater plenty, and was the first metal wrought in this country. Many hun∣dred thousand quintals are annualy exported, chiefly in bars, and part of it in stoves, pots, kettles, and cannon: the national profit arising from this metal is estimated at three hundred thousand rixdollars. There is a species called moor-iron, found in large
<PB N="77" REF="860"/>
lumps among the morasses: of this the peasants make their own domestic tools and utensils, such as knives, scythes, and axes. The lead, found mixed in the silver ore, is an article of small im∣portance in Norway: yet some mines of this metal have been lately opened in the district of Soloer, by the proprietors of the copper-work at Oudal. A vitriol work has been begun near Kongsberg: the mines yield great plenty of sulphur, which however the Norwegians will not take the trouble to melt and depurate, because immense quantities are found at a cheaper rate in the island of Iceland. Allum is found between the slate-slakes, near Christiania, in such plenty, that works have been set up for refining this mineral, though they have not yet brought it to any degree of transparency. His Danish majesty has established salt-works in the peninsula of Valoe, about six English miles from Tonsberg, where this mineral is extracted in large quantities from the sea-water.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS: QUADRUPEDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Norwegian horses, though generally small, are well proportioned, swift, spirited, hardy, and in good condition; yet they seldom taste corn, living chiefly on grass and hay. As they are seldom or never gelded, their mettle is the more lasting: they are not, however, very fit for draught; but they trot easily, are sure-footed, and climb the mountains with surprising agility. Such is their courage, that they will sight with wolves and bears, and generally have the advantage. When the horse perceives these animals near him, while he is accompanied by a mare or a gelding, he advances before his weaker consort, and attacks his anta∣gonist with his fore-legs, which he uses like drum∣sticks. If, in an encounter with a bear, he turns about to kick with his hind-legs, he is ruined; for,
<PB N="78" REF="870"/>
in that case, the bear leaps upon his back, and sticks fast, until he has wounded him to death.</P>
<P>The oxen and cows of Norway are of a little breed, and these last produce but a small quantity of milk; yet, in the beginning of winter, they are sufficiently fat for the market; and their flesh is very tender, delicate, and juicy. As the cows yield but little milk, the farmers keep the greater number. These beasts are turned out in the summer to graze, sometimes at a great distance, among the rocks and mountains; and are tended by a woman servant, who lives in a hut built for the purpose, and milks them every day. In the spring, when they are first unhoused, the dairy-maid kindles a large fire in the fields, to which the cattle resort in the night, and lie round it, for the sake of the warmth. In winter they are fed with dried leaves and boughs, prepared as provender; and in the spring they feed upon buds, sprouts, and young shoots. In the manor of Northland, the people, who have large fisheries, mix cods heads and fish-bones among the provender, which the cows eat with a good relish; but by this food the milk is disagreeably affected: nay, the Norwegian cows will greedily eat flesh, and gnaw the bones with their teeth, like dogs and other carnivorous animals. The peasants admi∣nister a little salt daily to their cows, and sometimes regale them with pickled herrings.</P>
<P>There is a great number of small sheep in Nor∣way, and on the little verdant islands that surround the coast. The mutton is delicious, and the fleeces are profitable.</P>
<P>All the rocks are covered with goats and kids, insomuch that, from Bergen alone, seventy thousand raw skins are exported, exclusive of those which are manufactured in the country. A Norway goat is not afraid of a single wolf: he is sometimes bit
<PB N="79" REF="880"/>
by a serpent, and, in that case, he revenges himself by eating the aggressor.</P>
<P>Few hogs are reared in Norway.</P>
<P>Of dogs there is a variety, as in other nations: some are trained to watch and protect the sheep and cattle; some are kept as domestic guards; some are bred to bear-hunting; and some are taught to catch birds on the rocks and mountains.</P>
<P>Of cats there is plenty, both tame and wild; these last residing upon trees, and living upon bird∣catching. Their skins bring a good price, and are used for winter lining.</P>
<P>The wild beasts that are natives of Norway de∣serve a particular description, in the different species of the elk, the rein-deer, the hare, the rabbit, the bear, the lynx, the glutton, the leming, the er∣mine, the martin, and the beaver.</P>
<P>The elk is a tall animal, of an ash colour, in shape and make partaking of the horse and the stag, having long legs, flat horns, and cloven hoofs. It is a harm∣less creature, and lives near houses in the winter: the flesh tastes like venison, and the hide is tanned into strong leather.</P>
<P>The species of the red deer is almost destroyed by the wolves: nevertheless, there are still a few on the continent and in the islands. The farmers shoot them in winter, preserve them in the snow, live upon the flesh, and sell the hide and horns. Sometimes small herds of these animals swim over from island to island, and, when tired, rest their heads upon the rumps of each other: that which is foremost, finding itself fatigued, retreats to the last; and thus they are alternately assisted.</P>
<P>The rein-deer is a species of the stag, peculiar to these northern countries; and, according to the re∣peated experiment of transplanting him, this crea∣ture will not live in any other climate, whether the moss which he feeds upon is not to be found else∣where,
<PB N="80" REF="890"/>
or he cannot retain his health, except in his native air.</P>
<P>Norway abounds with small hares, which, in the severe season, change their colour from brown to white: they live upon mice, which they pursue under the snow; or, in case of necessity, feed upon the birch-catkins.</P>
<P>Rabbits are found in a few places of this kingdom.</P>
<P>Bears appear in every part of Norway, but chiefly in the districts of Bergen and Drontheim. This animal is generally of a dark or light brown colour, very strong and sagacious; his great∣est strength residing in his fore-legs and paws. While a she-bear suckles her young, it is danger∣ous to meet, her in the fields: at other times she will fly from the human species. One of those women who tend the flocks, will drive a bear be∣fore her with a stick, and often oblige him to quit his prey: but these animals will at any time attack a woman who is pretty far advanced in pregnancy; yet there is no instance of a bear's devouring a child. He feeds occasionally on roots, grass, plants, particularly angelica, and different sorts of berries: but he delights most in animal food, the flesh of sheep, goats, cows, and horses. He as∣saults his prey with his fore-paws, and uses not his teeth until he has mastered the creature: then he sucks the blood on the spot, and drags the carcase to his den. If the road is uphill, or difficult, he will take up the body in his arms, and walk upon his hind-legs only. He will not touch the dead carcase of any animal which he himself has not killed. He corrects the wolf, which, indeed, does not like to reside in his neighbourhood. A large bear in Roysund was for many years known to follow the herds as their keeper: he stood tamely by the dairy-maid, while she was milking the cows, and often drove the wolf away; till at the end of
<PB N="81" REF="900"/>
autumn, when he began to provide his winter's den, he took a kid or sheep, as if by agreement in lieu of wages. The Norwegian bear, from a whole flock, singles out the cow that wears the alarm-bell: he is so incensed at this utensil, that he often strikes it flat with his paw, when it is made of hammered metal; and when it is cast, breaks it in pieces. He has been known to take a gun from the huntsman, and fire it off. When he is attacked by two or three hunters, and the first fires without wounding him mortally, he seizes the man before he can load again, and, hugging him in his fore-paws, retreats backward upon his hind-legs, well knowing that the others will not fire, for fear of wounding their companion. If he finds himself mortally wounded in the neigh∣bourhood of the sea, or any deep water, he lays hold on a large stone, with which he plunges into it, that he may sink to the bottom, and deprive the huntsman of his skin. His broad paws being well adapted for rowing, he ventures into rivers and creeks to catch fish. When he finds himself tired with swimming, and spies a boat near him, he will endeavour to board it; and if his attempt succeeds, will sit peaceably in the stern to be fer∣ried over. The boatman, however, does not much relish his passenger, and plies his oars lustily, that he may not be overtaken: or if he is provided with an ax, the bear's paws smart for his presump∣tion. In the latter end of autumn the bear pitches upon his winter-quarters in some cave or cavern, where he prepares for himself a soft bed of moss and leaves: he likewise covers up the opening with boughts in such a manner, that when the snow falls no entrance appears, and no sign remains of an animal inclosed within. Here he is seized with a deep sleep, or lethargic disorder, from which he cannot easily be wakened, even by wounds, when
<PB N="82" REF="910"/>
his den is discovered. If he escapes detection, he will lie in a kind of slumber the whole winter, without eating or drinking: but he is said to suck his paws. These are certainly sore and tender when he comes forth in the spring, so that he hops about for some time, and the huntsman takes ad∣vantage of his lameness. When he forsakes his den, he is likewise sick at stomach; and goes in quest of an ant's hillock, which he swallows at one dose. This operates as a purge and stomachic, scours his inside, and strengthens his bowels.</P>
<P>The Norway bear is hunted with small dogs, trained up to the sport. They never venture to grapple with him; but harrass him with running about, barking, leaping, and endeavouring to seize him by the genitals. When he is thus tired, he retreats to a rock, or a tree; and, setting his back against it, tears up the stones and earth, which he throws about him in his own defence: then the huntsman fires at him with a brace of bails from a rifled gun; and if the shot enters his chest, his shoulder, or his ear, he falls imme∣diately: but, if he is only slightly wounded, he flies with surprising fury upon the marksman, who must defend himself with the bayonet, which is commonly fixed in the muzzle of the piece. If this implement be wanting, he snatches the knife or dagger, which the Norwegian farmer always wears hanging at his side by a brass chain, and holding it cross-ways in his hand, endeavours to thrust it down the bear's throat. Should he miss his aim, his life is lost. The bear will flea him, and pull his skin over his ears with amazing dex∣terity. Sometimes, however, he beats the con∣quered huntsman with his paws until he appears to be dead, and then retires. If the farmer triumphs, the head of his antagonist is fixed upon his house as a trophy. The hide will fetch five or
<PB N="83" REF="920"/>
six rix-dollars. The flesh is eaten by the vulgar; and at every wedding a bear's ham appears as a dainty.</P>
<P>The wolves in Norway traverse in troops the woods, mountains, and deserts, and prey upon every creature they can conquer. In hard winters they will enter the farmer's yards, and devour his dogs, even in the kennel. The wolf, though ex∣tremely fierce, is not courageous. When a deer stands upon the defensive, this animal is afraid to attack him: even a cow and a goat has been known to turn against him, and put him to flight: yet he is sometimes rendered so bold and savage by hunger, that he will attack a horse while he is drawing a sledge upon the ice: for which reason the passengers are always provided with small arms. As the wolf's prey is very un∣certain, his organs are so framed that he can fast a long time: but at length his hunger becomes so intolerable, that, for want of flesh, he is obliged to eat clay; which, though it appeases the rage of appetite, lies undigested in his stomach, until it is expelled by the force of nature, with the ex∣crement of other food. This expulsion is so pain∣ful, that he howls dismally during the operation. Wolves, as well as bears in Norway, are frightened by the sound of a horn, which the shepherdesses blow for that purpose. The same instrument, to∣gether with pipes and drums, are sounded in hunt∣ing the wolf. A great variety of snares are laid for this animal: sometimes he is blown up by a train of gunpowder; sometimes shot by a loaded mus∣ket, laid ready primed and cocked upon a car∣case: sometimes he is poisoned with a kind of yel∣low moss, which grows upon the fir-tree; and sometimes he is caught in a hole dug in the ground, and concealed by a false cover, which, when he touches it, falls down like a trap-door,
<PB N="84" REF="930"/>
and shuts again by means of a spring. In these pits the wolf is often found, with other animals which through fear he will not attack: nay, some times a peasant has been seen sitting along with him in this subterraneous prison. In order to avoid such accidents, the person who digs the snare is obliged by law to give intimation of it through the whole district.</P>
<P>The lossen, or lynx, is smaller than a wolf though as fierce and dangerous; and its skin is more beautiful and valuable. There are three sorts of these animals in Norway, different in size: but all of the cat-kind. They have sharp claws formed like those of the tyger: their backs are likewise bended, and they spring upon their prey, which they can see at a great distance. They dig deep and winding habitations for themselves in the earth, from whence they are driven by fire and smoke. They seldom eat more than the head o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> udder of the sheep: they feed but sparingly during the moon's increase; but, in her wane, they are said to be more ravenous, and to bury the car∣cases, like the bear, for future provision. They are particularly sagacious in undermining sheep∣folds, where they make terrible havock. And ex∣perienced he-goat, perceiving a lynx at work in this manner, watched him narrowly until his head came forth: then he attacked him with his horns so effectually, that he laid him dead upon the spot, before he could disengage his body from the earth.</P>
<P>Foxes of different colours, white, red, and black, abound in Norway. The black fur is the most valuable: four thousand fox-skins are annually ex∣ported from Bergen. The cunning of this animal is well known: among other stratagems, the Nor∣way fox catches crabs with his long bushy tail. He dips into the stream, and the crab, which is
<PB N="85" REF="940"/>
naturally fond of any hairy substance, laying fast hold of it, he draws him ashore. When he per∣ceives the otter employed in fishing, he hides him∣self behind a stone; and the fisher coming ashore to eat his prey, springs upon him all of a sudden. The otter is not afraid of the fox; but so discon∣certed by the surprize, that he quits his booty and runs away. The fox will lay a parcel of cods heads in a heap, and conceal himself behind it, until he has the opportunity of catching the first crow that comes to feed upon them.</P>
<P>One of the most remarkable quadrupeds in Norway is the erven, or vielfras, which signifies the glutton: in shape and size it resembles a turn∣spit dog, having a long body, thick legs, with sharp claws and teeth. His fur is variegated, and shines like damask, being very fine and pre∣cious; insomuch that he is shot with blunt ar∣rows, that the skin may not be injured. The erven is extremely bold and ravenous, and of such an insatiable appetite, that he will eat a whole carcase much bigger than himself. When he finds himself gorged, he squeezes himself be∣tween two trees standing close together, and exo∣nerates his stomach; and while he is in this con∣dition, he is the most easily taken. Should he be taken alive, and chained to a wall, he will eat the very stones and mortar.</P>
<P>The marten, or haaren, resembles a great brown forest cat: its bite is severe, and it smells dis∣agreeably; nevertheless, the skin has a fine gloss, and is very valuable. It lives in hollow trees, and subsists upon wild mice and birds, which it pur∣sues by leaping from bough to bough.</P>
<P>Norway is likewise productive of squirrels, which are shot with blunt arrows, or taken in snares. This creature will embark on a piece of wood, floating in a small lake or river. It will hoist its
<PB N="86" REF="950"/>
broad tail by way of canvas, paddle with one foo and steer with the other to the opposite shore.</P>
<P>The ermin, or hermelin, which is a kind <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> weazle, resides in the clefts of rocks, and amon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heaps of stones. The nature of his elegant f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> needs no description. These animals hunt mice but they delight chiefly in eggs: for which reason they swim in calm weather to the little island<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where the water-fowl hatch their young.

<P>Among the Norwegian quadrupeds we numbe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the beaver or castor, the otter, the badger or brock<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the hedge-hog, the mole, the wood and water rat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the mouse, and the leming or lumhund, which last is peculiar to these northern countries. The beaver shall be particularly described in our account of North America. The otter is well known to live in holes, and subsist upon fishing: the eagle and crow attend his meals, and are content to eat his leavings. This creature, when young, may be tamed, and taught to fish for its master. The mole frequently takes possession of the bear's den,
<PB N="87" REF="960"/>
and, by means of his prickles, proves such a trou∣blesome guest, that the right owner, who cannot do himself justice on an adversary so fortified against his resentment, is obliged to quit his lodgings. But the most singular of all these animals is the lemming, the native country of which is said to be the mountains of Kolen in Lapland. This creature seems to be a species of the rat, with a short tail, very short legs, large whiskers, small eyes and ears, and long sharp teeth. About once or twice in twenty years they appear in vast num∣bers, advancing along the ground, and devouring every thing that is green, like a pestilence. Some flocks of them march from the Kolen, through Nordland and Finmark, to the western ocean, which they enter, and, after having swam about for some time, perish. Other bodies take their route through Swedish Lapland to the Sinus Both∣nicus, where they drown in the same manner. They advance in a direct line; and if they are obliged to go round a large stone or rock, they seek their former line of direction, in which they proceed. If they are opposed by the peasants, they will stand and bark at them: nevertheless, great numbers of them are destroyed and eaten by the Lapland dogs. If a boat happens to be in their way, lying in a river or creek which they intend to pass, they march in at one end or side of the vessel, and out at the other. The appearance of these vermin is looked upon as an omen of a bad harvest, and heretofore there was a form of exorcism used against them by the Romish clergy: but if they prognosticate a scanty crop, they make amends in occasioning a good hunting season; for they are followed by great numbers of bears, foxes, and other animals, which eat them as the most de∣licious food. The common people suppose that these vermin are transported through the air; and
<PB N="88" REF="970"/>
several learned men have embraced the same opi∣nion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>Among the reptiles, insects, and venomous creatures found in Norway, we reckon snakes of different colours, that live upon the land, water∣snakes, lizzards, toads, frogs, snails, grashoppers, plow-worms, slow-worms, cluster-worms peculiar to this country, centipes, and frog-worms, brought thither by the west wind in the summer. They fall on trees and greens, and destroy the vegeta∣tion: the honey dew is likewise impregnated with insects, or their eggs: a third sort, larger and more mischievous, falls down with the snow in the spring, consumes every thing that is green, and is consi∣dered as a plague, or the instrument of divine ven∣geance. Norway also produces the spider, the caterpillar, the butterfly, common fly, gnat, wood∣louse, flea, beetle, and ant. The water too has its beetle and red worms; which last swarm on the coast of the western ocean. They resemble the finest sewing silk, are about half an inch in length, and do infinite damage to the fishery, by fixing upon the roes of the herring. There is another pernicious sea-insect, called the bear-fish, about an inch long, which fastens on the cod while he hangs upon the hook, and sucks his fat and juices in such a manner as to render him scarce eatable. The salmon is likewise persecuted by a kind of flat lice, something like bugs, which insinuate them∣selves between his fins, and drive him up rivers to water-falls, where he may have the opportunity of being washed clean of this vermin. The sea∣beaver is another larger insect, peculiar to the north sea: this is the same with the Mediterranean hippo-campus, cavallo marino, or sea-horse, so called from the figure of its head, which resembles
<PB N="89" REF="980"/>
that of an horse: the body is vermicular, and sometimes extends to the length of five or six inches. The sea, in this latitude, produces like∣wise a remarkable worm, for which there is no name: it is as long and thick as an ordinary finger, of a white colour, without head or tail, having an opening at one end, which probably serves as a canal both to the aliment and excre∣ment. Finally, we may add the little insect ge∣nerated in the conchae avitificae, that stick to the sides and bottoms of ships, and are known by the name of barnacles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>Besides the birds common to other European countries, such as the dunghill fowls, the growse, the quail, the corncrake, finches, pidgeons, snipes, the thrush, the owzle, the nightingale, the eagle, the hawk, the kite, the heron, the raven, cormo∣rant, cuckow, bat, &amp;c. the sea-coasts of Nor∣way are overspread with innumerable flights of aquatic fowls, that build among the rocks and cliffs in the islands and on the continent, and feed upon fish or sea-weed. Among these we enu∣merate a great variety of wild geese and ducks; the alk, a bird peculiar to this country, that builds in the most inaccessible rocks, flying in such num∣bers as even to darken the air, while the noise of their wings is like the roaring of a storm; the berg-ugle; the bafiar, not larger than the thrush; the strand-sneppe, the gagl, the hav-aare, the hav-hest, the hav-sule; the imber, or great northern diver; the jo-fugl, the krage, the krykkie, the lax-tite, the lom, the gull or maage, the savor∣ren, the skare or loon, the skue, the trest, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The common people among the Norwegians, who live near the sea-coast, are employed at one season of the year in climbing the steep rocks, with equal
<PB N="90" REF="990"/>
danger, skill, and intrepidity, to catch these airy inhabitants. Their flesh, feathers, down, and eggs, afford a good maintenance to those peasants, over and above the extraordinary crops of grass pro∣duced from their dung upon the islands. Some of the eggs are as good as hen-eggs, and great quan∣tities are carried to market: the meat, though in general it has a fishy taste, is parboiled in vinegar, or pickled for the tables of the common people: but the principal advantage is yielded by the fea∣thers and down, which are annually sold to the merchants at Bergen. In some of the Nordland districts, the farmers train dogs to spring the shore and strand birds from their holes, which are almost inaccessible. These are auxiliaries to the bird-men or climbers, who either scramble up the face of perpendicular rocks with the most astonishing cou∣rage and dexterity, or are lowered down by ropes, sometimes above one hundred fathom, over pro∣jecting precipices. Some of the birds will allow themselves to be seized in their nests; others are taken in a net, fixed to the end of a pole, which the bird-man applies to the mouths of the holes from whence they take their flight. In climbing up the rocks, two bird-men tie themselves toge∣ther with a rope of a moderate length. The first being pushed up by the other's pole to a proper standing-place, or projection, fixes himself to the rock; and the second clambers up, assisted by the rope which is tied round the waist of his fellow. In this manner they proceed alternately until they arrive at the birding places: but sometimes, in spite of all their skill and precaution, one slips, and dragging the other after him, both perish. Some persons also lose their lives yearly, in the other operation of descending from the summits: loose fragments of the rock, being moved in the descent, sometimes fall upon and kill the bird∣man;
<PB N="91" REF="1000"/>
and sometimes the rope being cut by the sharp-pointed stones, he is precipitated and dashed in pieces among the rocks.</P>
<P>Before we leave this article of birds, it may not be amiss to observe, that Norway produces two very remarkable birds, namely, the nord-wind's-pipe, of a grey colour, something less than a starling, which makes a particular noise before the north wind begins to blow; and the souden-wind's-fugl, or south wind-fowl, which never ap∣pears but before a southerly wind. At the head of the game-fowl in this country is the tiur, urae∣gallus major, or cock of the wood, of a black or dark-grey colour, with some red about the eyes. He is the largest of all the eatable birds, and re∣sembles the wild turkey-cock in the bill and feet. The Norwegian eagle is so large and strong, that he has been known to carry away a child two years old. The land-eagle preys upon land-animals; such as hares, lambs, kids, and sheep, exclusive of birds: but the fish-eagle, which is larger than the other, lives chiefly on the produce of the sea and rivers. When he strikes a fish at sea with his talons, which are long, sharp, and crooked, so as that he cannot easily disengage himself, he is some∣times dragged down to the bottom by the strength of his antagonist: he generally meets with this misfortune when he strikes the fish helleflynder, whose back is high and prominent, and appears a little above the surface. In the neighbourhood of Bergen, an eagle, standing on the bank of a river, perceived a salmon close by the edge: he forth-with struck the talons of one foot into the root of an elm, and darted those of the other into the sal∣mon, which, being large and strong, sprung away with such force, that the eagle was split and torn asunder. The swallows in Norway, about the lat∣ter end of autumn, take wing in large flights, and
<PB N="92" REF="1010"/>
plunge themselves into fresh-water lakes, generally among reeds and bushes, where they remain all the winter in a state of insensibility, and revive again in the spring. Whole flocks of them, in this benumbed condition, have been found by fishermen coupled together, with their legs and bills intangled. If brought into a warm apart∣ment, they will in half an hour begin to move; in a little more time they will flutter, and even fly about; yet in less than an hour they die outright.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FISHES.</HEAD>
<P>The rivers and fresh-water lakes in Norway af∣ford the eel, the lamprey, the perch, the bleak, the bream, the elveritze, the gedde, the saudert, the trout, the salmon, the salmon-trout, the hor, the karudse, the kollie, the krokle, the kullebars, the dove, the siik, the skale, or alburnus, the sturgeon, &amp;c. The northern ocean is the great repository for fish of all kinds, and sea-animals, which swarm in myriads near the Pole; some for the convenience of prey, and others for the benefit of protection yielded by perennial bulwarks of ice. Under this cover the herring, cod, mackarel, whiting, &amp;c. breed without molestation from the unwieldy whale, who, on account of his respira∣tion, will not venture far below the ice. Never∣theless, those kinds of fish which are generated of spawn, approach the coasts of Norway annually, and discharge their spawn in narrow creeks and channels. The sea, in these parts, abounds with the rock-fish, the blue-fish, the blankensteen, the herring, the anchovy, the fin-fish, the brosmer, the fiskekong, the flounder, plaice, turbot, thorn∣back, helle-flynder, hollibut, maids, and soles, the flying-fish, sharks of various kinds, the horn-fish, or muraena, the whiting, the mackarel, the gur∣nard, the cod, the ling, the herring, the haddock,
<PB N="93" REF="1020"/>
the needle-fish, the raate or sea-carp, the razor∣fish, the rod-fish, the square-fish or ostracion, the lyr, the sey, the sea-cat, the soly-fish, the stone∣biter or lupus, the sword-fish, the sea-horse, the sea-scorpion, the whale, the grampus, the naraval or sea-unicorn, the porcpisce, the seale or sea-calf, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Some of the most striking peculiarities ob∣servable in these different species, well deserve our attention. There is one species of the shark, called haac-moeren, ten fathoms in length, whose liver yields three casks of train-oil. The helle∣flynder, or large turbot, which will cover a broad table, has been known to exhibit symptoms of re∣venge against mankind. A fisherman, in striking at one of these animals, chanced to fall overboard, and sunk to the bottom in two or three fathoms water. The helle-flynder immediately descended, and spread his huge body upon the man to keep him from rising; and in that posture he remained, until his companions, who saw what passed, drove away the fish with their boat-hooks.</P>
<P>Of the whale kind there are seven different species: all of them follow the shoals of herrings, and other small fish, to the coasts of Norway; and when the peasant observes them, at the distance of several miles, spouting up the water through the openings in their heads, he joyfully hails the signal of the approaching fishery. Some thousands of these whales appear stretching along the coast, from Karmsund to Christiansand in the diocese of Tron∣theim, an extent of three hundred and sixty miles. The large whale sometimes over-shoots himself, runs a-ground, and expires: then he is found stretched to the length of seventy feet, and be∣comes the property of him who owns the land. He pretty much resembles a cod, with small eyes, a smooth, dark, marbled skin, white under the
<PB N="94" REF="1030"/>
belly. Through the two holes or openings in the head, these creatures spout out the water which they take in inspiration; for their lungs are formed like those of any other animal. Their throats are very narrow, in proportion to their size: their tails are horizontal; and they copulate like land-ani∣mals, standing upright in the sea. The female brings forth one or two at a birth, about nine or ten feet long when first produced. These suck the teats of the mother, who, when they are tired with swimming, takes them between her great fins, and conveys them from place to place. Un∣der the skin the whale is covered with two or three feet thickness of fat, the blubber from which the oil is extracted. The flesh is of a redish colour, accounted very coarse food, though sometimes eaten: but the tongue and tail are admired as dainties. An old whale is attended with a dis∣agreeable scent, owing to weeds, muscles, and other foulnesses that gather and stick to his back. He feeds upon small insects, not larger than flies, that float in myriads upon the water. He likewise devours a great variety of small fish, particularly herrings and cod, which he drives together in great shoals, and swallows in such prodigious quan∣tities, that his belly is distended almost to burst∣ing. When this is the case, he roars hideously with pain. The same noise, resembling a clap of thunder, he makes when he is pursued by his ene∣mies, or frightened by falling into the nets of fishermen, which, however, he carries off with great facility. The whale is a timorous animal; and, when he approaches a boat, may be easily scared away by striking on the gunwale with an oar. At the time of their pairing, however, they are said to be more bold and dangerous.—For the manner of catching whales, and an account of
<PB N="95" REF="1040"/>
the blubber and whalebone, see the article of SPITZBERGEN.</P>
<P>The whale is persecuted by a variety of fish and fowl. The thresher fastens on his back, and beats him without ceasing; while another fish, with sharp horns on his back, assaults him from below, and sometimes tears open his belly. The tuke∣fish, or sepia, is said to burrow in his flesh. The spekhuggeren, a fish about four feet long, a kind of porcpisce, provided with very long and sharp teeth, bites and tears the flesh from the whale's body; and, when he comes up to the surface, he is attacked by divers birds of prey. Thus tortured, he bellows dreadfully, and leaps so as to raise him∣self perpendicular above the surface of the sea: then he plunges down again with such violence, that if his head strikes against a hidden rock, where the water is not deep, his skull is fractured, and he comes floating up a dead carcase. Besides this great whale, a vast number of a smaller kind, visit the coast of Norway in different forms, and are by the fishermen frightened and driven ashore, where they perish.</P>
<P>The seale, or phocas, is an animal so well known that it needs no description. They reside in caverns and upon rocks in the north-sea, where they are seen in thousands. They litter on shore twice a year; and great numbers of them are caught sleeping on the flakes of ice near the coast of Groenland. They are easily surprised and killed by the fishermen, who strike them with a stick over the nose. The fat, which is flea'd off with the skin, the fishermen barrel up in casks for train∣oil: the skins being sprinkled with salt, are rolled up singly. One ship has been known to carry off eight hundred casks of seal-fat in a season.</P>
<P>The female salmon ejects its roe at the mouths of rivers, through an aperture under the belly:
<PB N="96" REF="1050"/>
during this operation she bends her body, and thrusts her head into the sand. The male coming after∣wards, bends his head towards the tail, and dis∣charges his spawn upon the other's roe. All the different species of fish, that have roes, probably breed in the same manner.</P>
<P>The herrings annually visit the western coast of Norway, chiefly Nordland, in such amazing swarms as exceed all belief. The innumerable shoal that comes forth from their shelter under the ice at the North Pole, divide themselves into three bodies about the latitude of Iceland. One of these directs its course to the westward, steering round the He∣brides and coast of Scotland, towards Newfound∣land: the second courses round the eastern part of Great-Britain, down the Channel; and the third, keeping to the left along the coast of Norway, enters through the Sound into the Baltic. The herring and cod are driven in shoals upon the coast by the great herring-whale; and as he dares not venture in between the islands and the rocks, he remains about six weeks watching for their re∣turn, on the back of a great sand-bank parallel to the shore, extending about three hundred English miles in length. In the mean time the sharks, porcpisces, and smaller fish of prey, pursue the cod and herrings along shore into inlets and creeks, where they croud in such a manner, that they may be taken up in pail-fulls. A shoal not only ex∣tends a considerable way in length and breadth, but also reaches from the bottom to the surface, even in the depth of two hundred fathoms. Se∣veral hundred ship-loads of pickled herrings are yearly exported from Bergen only, besides the great quantity consumed at home by the common people. The largest and fattest appear upon the coast from Christmas to Candlemas. At that sea∣son the country-people assemble on the shore by
<PB N="97" REF="1060"/>
thousands, with their fishing-tackle, boats, casks, and salt. In the compass of one mile three hun∣dred boats may be seen employed a whole month, without intermission. In each not, about twenty feet long, the fishermen will often catch five thou∣sand large herrings. At one single cast the fisher∣man frequently takes more than he can dispose of. At Sundifiord ten thousand ton are said to have been taken at one haul. There is likewise a sum∣mer visitation, consisting of large and small her∣rings, which are likewise caught in surprising num∣bers. The fat and large kind are pickled and ex∣ported: the other sort are consumed by the pea∣sants.</P>
<P>The cod, ling, kabeliau, and torsk, follow the herrings to feed upon their spawn. They are caught in large strong nets, four hundred fathoms long, in fifty or sixty fathoms water; and some∣times they are taken by long lines: on each of these are fixed two or three hundred hooks, baited with herring; and when the line is drawn, a fish is frequently found hanging to every hook. The cod, being thus taken in great numbers, are either pickled with French and Spanish salt, or dried in different ways, and exported to Bremen, Ham∣burgh, and Amsterdam. Many thousand casks of the roe, salted, are sold annually to the French, who strew it in the sea by way of bait, when they catch a sort of fish, called sardeller, something like herrings. A great quantity of train-oil is extracted from the cod's liver; and the sounds are dried, and barrelled up for exportation.</P>
<P>The cod and herring-fishery of Norway em∣ploys and maintains above one hundred and fifty thousand people.</P>
<P>The rana piscatrix, or sea-devil, is sometimes seen on this coast, about six feet in length. The head makes above one half of the fish: the body
<PB N="98" REF="1070"/>
tapers into a sharp-pointed tail, the eyes are large, and the jaws, wide and horrible, set with different rows of sharp teeth: the tongue is likewise fur∣nished with teeth, or sharp protuberances, so that his bite is terrible; and all round the under-jaw, which projects beyond the upper, there are hang∣ing slips, or gristly fins, about four inches long. The sea-devil, fixing himself at the edge of a rock, opens his jaws very wide, and lies in wait for his prey. Other fish mistaking the slips for worms, and the open mouth for an aperture in the rock, swarm around him, and rush into his throat, where they are instantly devoured. He is ex∣tremely voracious, and has been known to destroy a man that was bathing in the sea, by seizing his genitals, and dragging him to the bottom.</P>
<P>The scorpio marinus, or sea-scorpion, found on this coast, is a fish about four feet long, with a head larger than the whole body, of a hideous aspect, wide mouth, monstrous jaws, and small scales of a redish colour. It is a voracious animal, and its bite is said to be poisonous.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXANGUIOUS FISHES.</HEAD>
<P>Of exanguious fish, whether crustaceous, testa∣ceous, or insect, there is a great variety in the Norwegian sea. Among these we number oysters, cockles, and muscles, lobsters, crabs, shrimps, sea∣hedgehogs, scuttle-fish, different kinds of star-fish, the wilk, the sea-snail, the hermit-fish, the sepia, loligo or ink-fish, the urtica marina, or sea-nettle, the pearl-band, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The rock-oysters of Norway are large and delicious. The crab and star-fish feeds upon the common oyster: when the shell is open at low-water, the crab throws in a stone to keep it from closing, and then the creature be∣comes an easy prey. The fox, notwithstanding
<PB N="99" REF="1080"/>
his boasted sagacity, is often taken prisoner by the oyster, by putting his paw or his tongue into the shell, which instantly closes: thus he is detained, and sometimes drowned by the spring-tides.</P>
<P>On the west-side of Norway the pearl-muscle is found in several brooks and rivers. The right of this fishery belongs to the king of Denmark, and is carried on at his expence. The pearls, which are annually taken about Midsummer, become the property of the queen, as part of the regalia of Norway. Some of these Norwegian pearls are of a good lustre, little inferior to those of the East; but the number of these is very inconsiderable. Thirty or forty lobster-busses, from London and Amsterdam, are loaded every Spring in the ports of Norway. Every buss is provided with a well, pierced with holes, to let in the sea-water, and large enough to contain ten thousand lobsters: their claws are tied up with packthread, that they may not fight and maim one another. The Nor∣wegian cray-fish, found in the rivers of Agger∣huus, is different from that of other countries.</P>
<P>If we may believe the testimony of many cre∣ditable Norwegians, the northern ocean produces some very extraordinary animals, the existence of which has been doubted by mankind in general; namely, the mer-man and mer-maid, the great sea-snake, and the kraken or korven. The mer∣man and mer-maid are sea-animals, that bear some resemblance to the human form. In the year 1719, one of the males of this species was found dead on a point of land in Nordland. His colour was of a dark grey; the face resembled that of a man, with a large mouth and flat nose: the arms were attached to the side by a thin membrane, and terminated in paws like those of the sea-calf: the body tapered into a fish's tail, like that of a porc∣pisce; and the length extended to three fathoms.
<PB N="100" REF="1090"/>
The mer-maid is formed in the same manner, bating the difference of sex, which is distinguished like that of the human race. These creatures have been seen in many different parts of the north sea, and have appeared of various magnitude, from two feet to three fathoms.</P>
<P>In the year 1723, three fishermen of Elseneur, in Denmark, being examined upon oath before the privy counsellor Frederick Van Gram, de∣clared, that in the month of July, in calm weather, between Hveen and Saedland, they approached in their boat something that floated on the surface like a dead body, which lay without motion, until they were within seven or eight fathoms of it; then sunk instantaneously, and rose again nearly in the same place. There he stood a quarter of an hour staring at them, and was seen above the water, down to his breast. They being terrified at sight of this monster, began to row away: then he blew up his cheeks, uttered a kind of muttering roar, and dived under water. He appeared like an old man, with broad shoulders, and a small head, co∣vered with short black curled hair. His eyes were hollow, his face was meagre and weather-beaten, and his chin furnished with a black bushy beard, that looked as if it had been cut: his skin was coarse and hairy. One of these deponents further declared, that about twenty years before he had seen a mer-maid, with long hair and large breasts.</P>
<P>The mar-miele, or mar-mate, belongs to the same class, and is perhaps the young of this family. It is found of different sizes, and often caught on hooks by the fishermen of Norway. Some are no bigger than infants half a year old; others are as large as children of three years. The peasants are said to carry them home to their houses, and regale them with milk, in hope they will foretel
<PB N="101" REF="1100"/>
something favourable in return for their entertain∣ment: but they never detain them longer than four and twenty hours, superstitiously believing themselves bound to row back to sea with them, and release them near the spot where they were taken.</P>
<P>The sea-snake is said to be peculiar to the Nor∣wegian sea, where it has been seen by many hun∣dreds of people, mariners, fishermen, and others. In the year 1746, captain Laurence de Ferry, of Bergen, shot at a sea-snake, which immediately disappeared; and when the boat was rowed near the place, the water appeared tinged with blood. The head of this animal, which it held at least two feet above the surface of the water, was of a greyish colour, and resembled the head of a horse. The mouth was very large and black; the eyes were of the same colour; and a long white main hung down from its neck, and floated on the sea. Besides the head, they saw seven or eight coils of this snake, about the distance of a fathom one from another.</P>
<P>In Egede's journal of the Greenland mission, we find, that on the 6th day of July, 1734, a large and frightful sea-monster raised itself so high out of the water, that its head reached above the main∣top-mast of the ship: that it had a long sharp snout, broad paws, and spouted water like a whale: that the body seemed to be covered with scales; the skin was uneven and wrinkled, and the lower part was formed like a snake. It plunged itself backwards in the water, and the raised its tail above the sur∣face a whole ship's length from the head. Though the exact dimensions of the sea-snake cannot be ascertained, we may conclude, from the concurring testimony of those who have seen it at sea, that he is an hundred fathoms in length; and that his body is as large as a hogshead. His skin, unlike that of
<PB N="102" REF="1110"/>
the Greenland monster, is smooth without wrinkle, of a dark-brown colour, speckled and variegated like tortoise-shell; and this skin he is said to shed annually. That his sense of smelling is very acute, the fishermen conjecture from the circumstance of his avoiding the scent of castor; a quantity of which they therefore provide themselves with, when they go out to fish in the Summer, and when they meet with the sea-snake, they throw a small por∣tion of it over-board. This huge animal is said to have sunk or overturned many large vessels, and even to have raised himself up and snatched men out of boats. The fishermen practise different methods of avoiding this calamity, besides the ex∣periment of castor: they sometimes row full against those volumes of him that appear above water, or throw a light piece of wood upon him: in that case he dives immediately. Sometimes they tack about, in order to gain the sun, whose beams the eyes of this creature cannot bear: but, if they are near the shore, they row into creeks where they cannot be pursued. The excrement or spawn of this animal, which floats upon the surface like a viscid slime, is so corrosive, that if it should touch the hands of the fisherman, they will be instantly blistered and inflamed.</P>
<P>But the most surprising creature in this sea, and perhaps in the whole world, is the kraken, or kor∣ven, an animal of the polypus kind, seemingly a mile and a half in circumference. The Norwe∣gian fishermen sometimes, in a hot summer-day, find no more than twenty or thirty fathoms water, where the depth used to be eighty or an hundred; and here they catch great plenty of cod and ling. They know the kraken is below them, and that they are fishing upon his back: when they per∣ceive, by their lines, that the water grows more and more shallow, they judge he is rising slowly to
<PB N="103" REF="1120"/>
the surface, and row away with great expedition. At a proper distance they lie upon their oars, and in a few minutes part of him appears above water, like a number of small islands and sand-banks, covered with sea-weeds, and abounding with a great variety of fish, that leap about, and roll off his sides into the water. At length a great number of pellucid antennae rise upon his back, as large and as high as the masts of moderate vessels: by means of these instruments, or tentacula, he moves himself and gathers in his food, which consists of small fishes. After he has remained a little time at the surface, he begins to sink again gradually, and this motion produces a dangerous swell and whirlpool in the water. A few years ago two fishermen, near Frederickstadt, had the misfortune to be left aground on the back of a kraken, and their boat was crushed to pieces by one of his an∣tennae; nevertheless they escaped upon the wreck. In the year 1680, a young kraken intangled itself among the rocks and cliffs in the parish of Alsta∣hong, and there it perished. The carcase putre∣fying, filled that narrow channel with such a stench, that for a long time it was impassable. In all pro∣bability the floating islands, which have been de∣scribed by so many voyage-writers, were no other than the back of this huge monster.</P>

<HEAD>PEOPLE: their LANGUAGE, RELIGION, LAWS, and GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Many Danish, English, Scotch, Dutch, and Ger∣man families have settled in Norway, and now form no inconsiderable part of the trading people: but the original inhabitants are the descendants of those ferocious Normanni, who harrassed almost all the coasts of Europe with piratical armaments in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries. They speak the same language that is used in Denmark,
<PB N="104" REF="1130"/>
though their original tongue is the dialect now spoken in Iceland. They profess the Lutheran re∣ligion, under an archbishop established at Dron∣theim, with four suffragans; namely, of Bergen, Staffanger, Hammer, and Christiania. By the union of Calmar, the two kingdoms of Norway and Denmark were united under one monarch; and then the people of both nations enjoyed considerable pri∣vileges: but the Danish government is now become absolute, and Norway is ruled despotically by a viceroy, who resides in the capital, and presides in the supreme court, to which appeals are made from the subordinate courts of judicature.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHARACTER of the PEOPLE: their MAN∣NERS, CUSTOMS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Norwegians are generally well-formed, tall, sturdy and robust, brave, hardy, honest, hospitable, and ingenious; yet savage, rash, quarrelsome, and litigious. The same character will nearly suit the inhabitants of every mountainous country in the northern climates. Their women are well-shaped, tall, comely, remarkably fair and obliging. The nobility of Norway have been chiefly removed by the kings of Denmark, in order to prevent faction, and opposition to the court; or are long ago de∣generated into the rank of peasants: some fami∣lies, however, have been lately raised to that dig∣nity. Every freeholder in Norway enjoys the right of primogeniture, and power of redemption; and it is very usual to see a peasant inhabiting the same house which has been possessed four hundred years by his ancestors. The odels-gads, or freehold, cannot be alienated by sale, or otherwise, from the right heir, called odels-mand: if he is not able to redeem the estate, he declares his incapacity every tenth year at the sessions; and if he, or his heirs, to the third generation, should acquire wealth
<PB N="105" REF="1140"/>
enough for that purpose, the possessor <HI>pro tempore</HI> must resign his possession.</P>
<P>The mountaineers acquire surprising strength and dexterity by hard living, cold, laborious ex∣ercise, climbing rocks, skating on the snow, and handling arms, which they carry from their youth, to defend themselves against the wild beasts of the forests. Those who dwell in the maritime parts of Norway exercise the employments of fishing and navigation, and become very expert mariners.</P>
<P>The peasants of Norway never employ any handicraftsmen for necessaries to themselves and families: they are their own hatters, shoe-makers, taylors, tanners, weavers, carpenters, smiths, and joiners: they are even expert at ship-building; and some of them make excellent violins. But their general turn is for carving in wood, which they execute in a surprising manner, with a com∣mon knife of their own forging. They are taught in their youth to wrestle, ride, swim, skate, climb, shoot, and forge iron. Their amusements consist in making verses, blowing the horn, or playing upon a kind of a guitarre, and the violin: this last kind of musick they perform even at funerals. The Norwegians have evinced their valour and fidelity in a thousand different instances. The country was always distracted by intestine quarrels, which raged from generation to generation. Even the farmers stand upon their punctilio, and chal∣lenge one another to single combat with their knives. On such occasions they hook themselves together by their belts, and fight until one of them is killed or mortally wounded. At weddings and public feasts they drink to intoxication, quarrel, fight, and murder generally ensues. The very common people are likewise passionate, ambitious of glory and independence, and vain of their pe∣digree. The nobility and merchants of Norway
<PB N="106" REF="1150"/>
fare sumptuously; but the peasant lives with the utmost temperance and frugality, except at festi∣vals: his common bread is made of oat-meal, rolled into broad thin cakes, like those used in Scotland. In time of scarcity they boil, dry, and grind the bark of the fir-tree into a kind of flour, which they mix with oat-meal: the bark of the elm-tree is used in the same manner. In those parts where a fishery is carried on, they knead the roes of cod with their oat-meal. Of these last, mixed with barley-meal, they make hasty-pudding, and soup, enriched with a pickled herring or salted mackarel. Fresh fish they have in plenty on the sea-coast. They hunt and eat growse, partridge, hare, red deer, and rein-deer. They kill cows, sheep, and goats for their winter stock: these they pickle, or smoak, or dry for use. They make cheese of their milk, and a liquor called syre of their four whey: this they commonly drink mixed with water; but they provide a store of strong ale for Christmas, weddings, christenings, and other entertainments. From their temperance and exer∣cise, joined to the purity and elasticity of their air, they enjoy good health, and often attain to a sur∣prising degree of longevity. Nothing is more common than to see a hearty Norwegian turned of an hundred. In the year 1733, four couples danced before his Danish majesty at Frederickshall: their ages, when joined, exceeded eight hundred years. Nevertheless, the Norwegians are subject to various diseases; such as the scab, the leprosy, the scurvy, the catarrh, the rheumatism, gout, and epilepsy. The dress of the Norway peasants con∣sists or a wide loose jacket, made of coarse cloth, waistcoat and breeches of the same. Their heads are covered with flapped hats, or caps ornamented with ribbons. They wear shoes without soles, and in the winter leathern buskins. They have like-wise
<PB N="107" REF="1160"/>
snow-shoes and long skates, with which they travel at a great pace, either on the land or ice. There is a corps of soldiers thus accoutred, who can out-march the swiftest horses. The Norwegian peasant never wears a neckcloth, except on extra∣ordinary occasions: he opens his neck and breast to the weather, and lets the snow beat into his bosom. His body is girt round with a broad leathern belt, adorned with brass plates, from which depends a brass chain that sustains a large knife, gimlet, and other tackle. The women are dressed in close laced jackets, having leathern girdles, decorated with ornaments of silver. They likewise wear silver chains round their necks, to the ends of which are fixed gilt medals. Their caps and handkerchiefs are almost covered with small plates of silver, brass, and tin, large rings and buttons. A maiden bride appears with her hair platted, and, together with her cloaths, hung full of such gingling trinkets.</P>
<P>The churches, public edifices, and many private houses in Norway, are built of stone: but the people in general live in wooden houses, made of the trunks of fir and pine-tree laid upon each other, and joined by mortices at the corners. These are counted more dry, warm, and healthy than stone or brick-buildings. In the whole diocese of Ber∣gen, one hardly sees a farm-house with a chimney or windows: they are generally lighted by a square hole in the top of the house, which lets in the light, and lets out the smoak. In summer this hole is left quite open: in the winter it is covered with what they call a siau; that is, the membrane of some animal, stretched upon a wooden frame that fits the hole, and transmits the rays of light. It is fixed or removed with a long pole, occasional∣ly. Every person that enters the house, upon busi∣ness or courtship, takes hold on this pole, accord∣ing
<PB N="108" REF="1170"/>
to antient custom. The ceiling is about eight feet high in the middle, and, being arched like a cupola, the smoke of the fire underneath rolls about, until it finds a vent at the hole, which is called liur. Under this opening stands a thick table with benches, and an high seat at the upper end for the master of the family: he has likewise a small cupboard for his own use, in which he locks up his most valuable effects. The boards of the roof are coated with the bark of birch-trees, which is counted incorruptible: this again is covered with turf, which yields a good crop of grass for goats and sheep, and is often mowed as hay by the farmer.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The Norwegians carry on a considerable trade with foreign nations. The duty on the produce of their own country exported, amounts annually to one hundred thousand rix-dollars. These commo∣dities are, copper wrought and unwrought; iron, cast into cannon, stoves, and pots, or forged into bars; lead, in small quantity; masts, timber, deal∣boards, planks, marble, mill-stones, herring, cod, ling, salmon, lobsters, flounders, cow-hides, goat∣skins, seal-skins, the furs of bears, wolves, foxes, beavers, ermins, martens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> down, feathers, butter, tallow, train-oil, tar, juniper, and other sorts of berries and nuts; salt, allum, glass, vitriol, and pot-ashes. All other commodities, and articles of luxury, the Norwegians import from different nations. The nature of the ground does not ad∣mit of much improvement in agriculture: never∣theless, the farmers are not deficient in industry and skill to drain marshes, and render the ground arable, or fit for pasture. Many are employed in grazing and breeding cattle: but a much greater number is engaged in felling wood, floating tim∣ber,
<PB N="109" REF="1180"/>
burning charcoal, and extracting tar from the roots of the trees which have been cut down; in the silver, copper, and iron mines; in the naviga∣tion and fishery. A considerable number of people earn a comfortable livelihood by hunting, shooting, and bird-catching. Every individual is at liberty to pursue the game, especially in the mountains and commons: therefore every peasant is expert in the use of fire-arms; and there are excellent marks∣men among the mountains, who make use of the bow to kill those animals whose skins, being valu∣able, would be damaged by the shot of fire-arms.</P>

<HEAD>ICELAND.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Its SITUATION, EXTENT, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>OF the islands belonging to Norway, the most considerable as well as the most northerly, is Iceland, Islandia, situated in the Atlantic ocean be∣tween Norway and Scotland, lying between 63 and 68 degrees of north latitude, and between 10 and 26 degrees of longitude west, from the meridian of London. It extends from east to west about seven hundred and twenty miles: the breadth, at a me∣dium, may be computed at three hundred. It is divided into four quarters, east, west, north, and south; and these again are subdivided into eighteen syssels, or shires, in which justice is administered by their respective sheriffs or judges.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="110" REF="1190"/>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>The face of the country is mountainous, like that of Norway; but the coast is not crowded with islands and rocks: a few of these, however, appear to the southward; and there the sea-fowl build in amazing numbers. They are very fertile, and bear excellent crops of grass, though not inhabited. Through the interior parts of Iceland runs a chain of huge mountains, both in length and across the country; some of which are eternally covered with ice and snow: yet they are generally passable to men and horses; and on the tops of some of them there are plains extending five and twenty miles. The mountains covered with ice and snow are called Jokeler, from which a great river continually flows of dark, muddy, stinking water: the jokells are sudden interruptions of the road by large ponds or lakes of water frozen; which in a few days va∣nish, so as that the path re-appears. Several mountains in this country are volcanoes, subject, though seldom, to violent eruptions. Of these, the most remarkable are Krafle and Hecla; the first situated in the north, and the other in the southern part of the island. Even these do not frequently emit fire, though they certainly have burned with great violence, discharging vast quantities of that melted matter which the Italians call Lava. Their sides are still covered with calcined stones and ashes. When the ice and snow are gathered around, and consolidated to such a degree as to stop the holes through which the fire and vapour transpire, the earth begins to shake, and fiery erup∣tions commonly ensue. These, by melting the ice and snow, produce such impetuous torrents as wash away all the mould from the sides of the mountains, leaving nothing but bare sand or rock.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="1200"/>
In the year 1726, a frightful rumbling noise was heard in the mountain Krafle: this was soon fol∣lowed by a dreadful eruption of fire and smoke, and a vast discharge of stones and ashes. It con∣tinued burning, at intervals, till the year 1728, when the flames increased so as to melt the sul∣phureous matter in the mountain. This was dis∣charged in a stream that ran slowly down the side of the hill, and continued its course eighteen miles to a great lake, called My-vatne, in which it pro∣duced a horrible hissing and crackling. It ran till the year 1730, when it ceased of itself, after having in its course overflowed and destroyed a few houses and farms. The lake was in one place filled up with this lava, and the fish for some time disap∣peared; but they afterwards returned, and at pre∣sent they swarm in this piece of water.</P>
<P>In the year 1721, several shocks of an earth∣quake were felt upon a mountain called Katlegan, on the southern part of the island, about six and thirty miles from the sea, near Portland's Bay. Then a great quantity of fire was disgorged, which melting the ice, gave rise to a dreadful torrent. This rushed down with such impetuosity, as to carry along with it stones, sand, mould, and every thing in its way to the sea, which it filled up with these materials to the distance of three miles from the shore.</P>
<P>An eruption of the same kind, which had hap∣pened many years before, produced such a violent agitation in the sea, that the water rose to a prodi∣gious height at the island of Westman, which lies seventy-two miles from the shore of Iceland. The eruption of smoak, sand, and ashes, eclipsed the sun in such a manner, that he did not appear for a whole day; and these ruins were strewed by the wind over the whole surface of the island.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="1210"/>
Eruptions of the same sort, though not quite so terrible, have happened in different parts of the country. As to Hecla, it has not burned these sixty years; and is now remarkable for nothing but its great height, and several cracks or chasms in its sides and summits, filled with boiling water.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Iceland is well watered with large and small rivers, that flow from the moun∣tains; besides rivulets, streams, and large lakes, some of them thirty miles in circumference. All these abound with excellent fish. The country is defective in point of forests; though there are some woods in the northern districts, as well as in other parts of the island, and almost every farm has an adjoining nursery of young trees. Their want of forests is in a great measure compensated by large quantities of fine timber, that come float∣ing ashore in different parts of the sea-coast. There is likewise plenty of shrubs and bushes, which the inhabitants burn into charcoal for their forges.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The climate of Iceland is as temperate as that of Norway, and even purer than that of the sea-coast in this kingdom, being oftener brushed and ventilated by high winds and storms. The winter sets in about the latter end of October, and the spring appears in the middle of April. It some∣times, however, snows and hails in summer, but in small quantities: the weather in this season is ge∣nerally warm, both by night and by day; for then the sun is but three hours below the horizon. At the northern extremity of the island the sun is seen, about the summer-solstice, perpetually above the horizon. In the shortest day of winter the sun is seen no longer than one hour above the horizon;
<PB N="113" REF="1220"/>
yet the inhabitants, even there, enjoy three hours of day, besides twilight. In the southern parts, the sun is three hours above the horizon at the winter-solstice, and the day is full six hours in length. The dawn and twilight continue much longer in Iceland than in Denmark, because the circle, described by the sun under the horizon, is more oblique in this than in southern latitudes. The Aurora Borealis is frequent here, as in other northern climates, and the sky is generally serene. The sea is never covered with ice, except that which comes floating from Greenland, extending several miles about the north coast, and exhibiting the resemblance of another country, interspersed with hill and dale; through which a good number of live animals, such as bears, foxes, and faulcons, may be seen running, clambering, and flying.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>The greater part of the mountains in Iceland are covered with excellent grass, and the interme∣diate valleys are extremely fruitful in herbage. The interior parts of the island are not inhabited; but in these the natives graze their cattle, which are tended by persons employed for that purpose, who build summer-huts for their own convenience. The ground, naturally fruitful, is enriched by the soil washed from the mountains. In different places, mould, clay, and sand predominate. The marshes, when drained, yield good pasture; and turf is to be found in almost every part of the island.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>WATER.</HEAD>
<P>The water of Iceland is generally light, pure, and free from mineral impregnation; not but that, in some places, we meet with chalybeate springs: but the most remarkable circumstance of the Ice∣land water is, that in a great many parts of the
<PB N="114" REF="1230"/>
sland there are hot springs, of various degrees of warmth. On the north shore, and in the parish of Hunsevig, about fifty miles from the mountain Krafle, are three hot springs, at the distance of thirty fathoms from each other. In these the water boils up and sinks alternately, in a surprising manner. One of these wells empties itself, by a small aper∣ture, into a natural stone bason, as large as a brew∣ing copper. Here the water rises at three different ebullitions: at the third it surmounts the brim of the bason about twelve feet; then sinks down four feet within the reservoir; and immediately another ebullition ensues. The water being poured into bottles, will continue for some time to rise and fall in these successive ebullitions, keeping time with that which remains in the fountain or reservoir: if the bottles be corked up as soon as filled, whenever the water rises in the well, they will burst in pieces. A stone, or even a piece of wood, thrown into the well, while the water is subsiding, will be carried down to the bottom, and cast up again with great force when the water boils over. When cold, it is very pleasant to the taste, and may be drank with safety. The cows of a neighbouring farm drink it as it runs from the cistern, while it is blood∣warm, and yield an extraordinary quantity of milk. The inhabitants, who live near those hot baths, employ them for several uses: they boil their meat, by sinking their pots, covered, to a certain depth in the cistern: they boil their tea-kettles in the same manner; bend hoops for barrels, by dipping them in the hot water; and make use of it for bathing, a practice that conduces to their health and longevity. The sea-water on the coast of Ice∣land is more impregnated with salt, than are most parts of the northern ocean, and, for this reason, less liable to be frozen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="115" REF="1240"/>
<HEAD>PRODUCTIONS: VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<P>Iceland produces rich crops of grass, upon the mountains as well as in the valleys and meadows; and part of this the farmers mow down for their winter supply. The herbs and roots common in other northern countries, are found here in abun∣dance; particularly the cochlearia, or scurvy-grass, the acetosa, or sorrel, and the angelica, which last is eaten by the Icelanders: but one of their most delicate dishes is made of the muscus catharticus islandiae, or mountain-grass, that grows on the rocks in great abundance, and is both wholsome and palatable. Many of the natives, who are stocked with this herb, make no provision of flour or meal. All kitchen-herbs and roots are easily brought to maturity in Iceland, which is not colder than Denmark; and this is likewise the case with the common fruit-trees, which thrive exceedingly well in the gardens belonging to the king's houses, the bishops, justices, and other persons of note in the island. The country would certainly produce corn, and all sorts of grain; and formerly it has been cultivated for that purpose: but at present this branch of husbandry is disused, though his Danish majesty has lately sent thither some expert farmers from Norway to introduce tillage, and in∣struct the Icelanders to manure and cultivate their lands. The sea of Iceland yields a vegetable called the alga marina saccharifera, but by the natives sol. The cattle and sheep are so fond of this weed, that they are often lost by going too far from the shore in quest of it, at low water. The inhabitants, finding it nourishing and toothsome, gather it for their own eating, and sell it for half the price of fish to those who live in the more interior parts of the island. The sea likewise produces other ve∣getables;
<PB N="116" REF="1250"/>
and some pieces of coral are dragged up on the hooks and in the nets of fishermen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>STONES, METALS, and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>There are stones of various colours found in Iceland; but to marble. It likewise produces a kind of chrystal, a large quantity of pumice-stones, and near the volcanoes, two sorts of agate: one of these will burn like a candle, and is undoubtedly a species of bitumen: the other is transparent, and seems to be a kind of vitrification. It is found in great quantities at the mountain Krafle, some pieces weighing each an hundred pounds. Iceland is certainly rich in minerals, though there are no mines worked in the country. The people find, even above ground, large lumps of silver, copper, and iron ore, so rich, that they are melted by a common wood-fire, and the metal made into various utensils. But the principal mineral of this island is sulphur, discovered by a strong subterra∣neous heat that smokes through the ground, in the rocks, mountains, and plains. It is generally found in the neighbourhood of hot springs, co∣vered with a layer of sand and clay, white, yel∣low, blue, or green. This being removed, the sulphur is taken up with shovels, in such abun∣dance, that in one hour fourscore horses may be loaded. The best veins are raised in banks; and, when uncovered, appear like candied sugar, in intire hard lumps, not easily broken; but at a little distance from the middle it may be shovelled up in dust. The labourers are obliged to tie woollen rags about their shoes, to prevent them from burn∣ing; nor can they bear the work in hot weather. The sulphur, when first taken up, is so hot, that it can hardly be handled. In two or three years the veins, which have been exhausted, will be again
<PB N="117" REF="1260"/>
filled with sulphur: so quick is the vegetation or regeneration of this mineral. Great quantities of sulphur have been exported from hence to Copen∣hagen, and other countries; but at present that branch of trade has entirely ceased. There is no manufacture of salt in Iceland, though the coun∣try is said to afford saline springs as well as sal petre.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS: QUADRUPEDS.</HEAD>
<P>The bear is not a native of Iceland, but some∣times imported thither on floats of ice from Green∣land. The people are very vigilant in watching for these guests; whom they no sooner discover, either in coming ashore, or by the marks of their paws on the snow, than they forthwith pursue and attack them boldly, some with guns, and others with spears. There was an old Icelander in the northern district, who had slain a great number of bears with his single arm: he always used a spear, and charged the beast in front. The Greenland bear is extremely fierce and large; and his natural ferocity is generally increased by the pangs of hun∣ger, which he has sustained in his voyage from that country. His fur is counted better than that of any other bear, being sometimes white as snow. Should he suddenly attack a native, who is unpre∣pared for defence, the Icelander throws something at him for his amusement. When a glove is sacri∣ficed for this purpose, the bear will not stir until he has turned every finger inside out. Iceland is productive of a great number of foxes; but the black fox is a stranger from Greenland, and very scarce in this country. These animals, however, appear in different colours; such as red, white, and grey: and the inhabitants are at great pains to destroy them, not only on account of their skins, but also in defence of their flocks. They are ge∣nerally
<PB N="118" REF="1270"/>
allured by the stinking carcase of a horse; and while they prey upon it in great numbers, the people shoot them with fowling-pieces. The Ice∣land horses are of the Norwegian or Scottish breed, well-shaped, hardy, mettlesome, though very do∣cile, and of different sizes. Great numbers run wild in the mountains: those that are trained to labour have no shelter or provender, even in the winter; during which they scrape away the snow and ice with their hoofs, until they dig to the earth for nourishment. As for the saddle-horses, they are housed and fed in the severe weather. The sheep of this country are of the same size and nature with those of Norway, Denmark, and Swe∣den. In most parts of Iceland the sheep, mares, and cows are housed in the winter: for this pur∣pose every farmer is provided with folds and stables. Some flocks, however, range about in all weathers, and take shelter occasionally in caves in the moun∣tains. Here, as in all other mountainous and cold countries, they are apt to be buried in wreaths of snow, and hurried into the sea by sudden tor∣rents. They are provided with an extraordinary coat of long hair, which covers the fleece, and is spun into coarse thread. The wool they shed yearly towards the beginning of the summer. The farmers, perceiving the coat ready to drop, pull it clean away, and, turning the sheep adrist, they are provided with a new fleece before the re∣turn of the cold weather. In the northern district the goats are much more numerous than the sheep, and thrive remarkably on the heath and bushes.</P>
<P>The cows and oxen of Iceland resemble those of Norway, from whence the breed was imported. The inhabitants make considerable quantities of cheese and butter; though this last is never salted, therefore proves rancid, and offensive to the sense
<PB N="119" REF="1280"/>
of smelling. Of the whey they make syre, which they keep and drink like the Norwegians. Such is their aversion to salt, that when they slaughter beasts for winter provision, instead of pickling, they dry the meat in the smoke to preserve it from putrefaction. Hogs are very scarce in Iceland. Of dogs, cats, and mice, there is great plenty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>Iceland is not deficient in poultry and pigeons; though the inhabitants do not breed them in great numbers, partly on account of the scarcity of grain, and partly because their wild fowl produce a greater quantity of eggs than the natives can consume. Among the wild land-fowl of Iceland, we number partridges, snipes, owzels, and becca∣sines. The land-birds of prey are eagles, faulcons, small hawks, and ravens. The faulcons of Iceland are so excellent for sport, that his Danish majesty sends thither a person every year, to buy up, at a considerable price, those that the natives have caught in nets and snares made for that purpose. No crows, magpies, or owls, are ever seen in Ice∣land. The cliffs, rocks, and small islands about the coast are covered with sea-birds, that come hither to breed, and prey upon the innumerable myriads of fish that swarm through the northern ocean. Swans and wild ducks frequent the fresh∣water lakes and rivers in the summer, and there they breed in the spring; but when these are frozen they resort to the sea, which is always open. The swan-eggs are eaten as delicacies; but the bird is hunted for his down and feathers, which are sold to great advantage. Wild geese are here birds of passage: they arrive in the spring, hatch their young, and depart about the latter end of autumn: of these there are five different species;
<PB N="120" REF="1290"/>
but we reckon ten different kinds of wild ducks, five of which are fit to be eaten, and well-flavoured. Of these the down-bird is the most esteemed and cherished. The duck is of the common size, and a dark-brown colour, except on the breast, which is of a lighter hue: the drake is as large as a goose, and has a great number of white feathers. They delight to build in little lonely islands: but the people have inticed them to the main land by tender usage, and screening them from all dis∣turbance. Thus treated, they will sit upon their eggs when visited, and even suffer them to be taken away, once or twice in a season. The duck will continue to lay others, until she is allowed to hatch a brood: in that case they will return next year, and multiply on the same spot. In making their nests, these birds pluck the down from their own breasts, that on this bed their eggs may lie soft and warm. The duck lays four large green eggs, which are delicious to the palate: these the natives take away, together with the down, and destroy the nest. The duck goes to work again in the same manner, and is robbed the second time. She renews her labour; but her breast being by this time bare, the drake supplies the nest with down, which, as it is white, is the more valuable. If the duck is three times deprived of her eggs, she quits that part of the country, and looks out for a new habitation: for that reason a prudent farmer will allow her to hatch her last produce; and he may be certain she and her young will re∣turn next season, when he will have three nests instead of one. When the young quit the nest, the people gather the down; so that every pair yields eight eggs, and three parcels of down, in one season: this down they export, and sell to great advantage. The plongeon and northern
<PB N="121" REF="1300"/>
diver we have described in our account of Norway. The geirs, or vultures, build in great numbers among cliffs and rocks in the sea, from whence the natives bring their eggs in boat-loads. This is likewise the case with a vast variety of other shore-birds, that dwell among the steep rocks. Here their nests are robbed, and themselves taken, by the same methods we have described as practised in Norway. The eggs of these sea and shore birds are generally spotted, of a greenish colour, with a very thick shell; thus contrived by Providence, that it may the longer retain the heat of incubation, as the bird is obliged to roam, in quest of food, at a great distance from its habitation. Though these birds build in swarms innumerable close to each other, in the cliffs and cavities of the rocks; yet, after they have been disturbed, and incredible flights are seen to hover on the wing, each individual at once distinguishes and resumes its own nest, by a never-erring instinct.</P>

<HEAD>FISHES.</HEAD>
<P>The sea of Iceland abounds with infinite mul∣titudes of the same kinds of fishes which we have numbered in our description of Norway; and the fishery is the most considerable branch of com∣merce in which the people of this country are em∣ployed. Herrings are driven in vast shoals by the whales, and other fishes of prey, into the creeks and harbours of Iceland, during their annual pro∣gression from the North Pole; but the Icelanders neither know how to cure this fish, nor have they salt sufficient for this purpose: besides, the large fat herrings, proper for pickling, seldom come in great numbers to this coast, except when they are chaced by accident. At all other times, indeed, vast multitudes of pilchards and sprats arrive with the cod, and are preyed upon by this fish, by the
<PB N="122" REF="1310"/>
whale, and other monsters of the deep, as well as by the fowls of heaven, that hover over them in amazing numbers, and dart upon them with in∣credible velocity. But the inhabitants of Iceland apply themselves chiefly to the cod-fishery; though this is in a great measure confined to the south and western quarters of the island. This branch of traffick they are the more encouraged to pursue, as they can catch and cure the cod, without any considerable expence but that of labour.</P>
<P>Towards the spring of the year the cod first ap∣pears to the eastward of the island, then to the southward, and afterwards about the great creek or bay between Reckeness and Wester-jokel, which is twenty leagues broad, and runs up sixteen miles into the country. Here the greatest fisheries are established, and to this place the natives come to fish from all quarters of the island.</P>
<P>The fish is caught on hooks, baited with mus∣cles, and fixed to long lines like those of Norway. The season begins in May, and continues till the end of autumn. The best fish are caught in deep water; therefore the fishermen are obliged to put out sometimes eight leagues to sea, where they often remain eight and forty hours in their open boats, almost without sustenance. When the cod are brought on shore, the fisherman goes to work on the spot; heads, guts, slits them open, extracts the greater part of the back-bone, then folds them together, and next day spreads them out to dry, if the weather be fair: but, if the day be cloudy or wet, they lay the fish one over another, with the skin upwards: in this posture, however, they must not lie above four and twenty hours, otherwise they would be apt to putrefy. If the damp weather continues, or a frost intervenes, the fish are laid in little heaps, the sleshy parts applied to each other, and the skins externally; and thus they
<PB N="123" REF="1320"/>
lie until the weather is fit for drying: then they spread them out singly upon stones along the shore; and the women turn them several times a-day, that on every side they may imbibe equal portions of the sun and air. If the weather holds good, they are thoroughly dried in fourteen days. What is intended for home-consumption, the people carry home to their respective houses: those that are de∣signed for export, they pile up in separate stacks as high as houses. These are bought by the mer∣chants, who cover them from the rain, until they can be conveniently stowed on board of their ships and vessels. The Danish merchants in Iceland pickle several hundred casks of cod yearly, and ex∣port them to Copenhagen; but this way of curing is little practised by the natives. The Danes like∣wise cure a considerable quantity in another man∣ner, which gives the denomination of clip-fish; whereas the other is called flat-fish. In order to make clip-fish, the cod must lie three days in pickle, then be washed in the sea-water, pickled again, laid out to dry like the flat-fish, made up in heaps, towards the evening pressed with heavy stones, and covered from the weather. The ling is a long narrow species of cod, dressed and cured as the others, though more esteemed. The tisling, or titling, is a small cod, and perhaps the young of that species; which the Icelanders find in great plenty, and cure in the usual manner for exporta∣tion. The cole-fish, which the Icelanders call ypre, belongs likewise to the same family, being almost as large as the cod, though not equal to it in flavour.</P>
<P>The Iceland fishermen dry the heads of their cod, and sell them for a good price in the country. The bones are used for firing, where there is a scarcity of fuel; and they are likewise given as food to the cattle, after having been softened in
<PB N="124" REF="1330"/>
boiling water. The livers are reserved in a vessel, and, being boiled together, yield a considerable proportion of train-oil.</P>
<P>In the western parts of Iceland the fish are slit open by the back; and, a pole being thrust through them, they are hung up to dry in houses made of lath, and so open, that there is a thorough circulation of air from one end to the other. This is the way of curing hang-fish, which the people reserve for domestic use, when the fishing season is over: while that continues, they regale themselves with the best of the fresh fish which is taken. The shores of Iceland abound with haddock, which is by the natives esteemed equal to cod, and cured in the manner of clip-fish. The Iceland whiting excels in size, fatness, and flavour. The flounders of Iceland, being fat, large, and numerous, are taken and dried for winter provision. Plenty of large turbot, six feet in length, and broad in pro∣portion, are caught by these people, who cut them in long slices, dry, and afterwards cook them into a delicate mess, which they call reklengur. The lupus marinus is here caught in great numbers, and much esteemed; as is another fish nearly of the same size and figure, which the Icelanders de∣nominate klir. Here is a delicious fish called the räd-mave, or red belly, generally found in shallow water: it is caught in great abundance with nets, hooks, and spears. Of the same form and shape is the graae-maven, or grey belly, though some∣what larger: it is thought to be the female of the räd-mave: they are delicate when eaten fresh, and much esteemed when salted, dried, and smoaked. The thorn-back, or skate, is here counted excel∣lent, and cured in the manner of clip-fish. There is another small fish, analagous to the perch, which is caught in Iceland, under the denomination of kerve.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="1340"/>
Among the whales, that sport in great numbers on the Iceland coast, we find the great Greenland whale, with a smooth back, sometimes two hun∣dred and forty feet in length. In the belly of a Greenland whale, which ran himself aground, and was killed, the Icelanders found six hundred fine live cod, together with a great quantity of herrings, and some birds. The people of this country are not very expert at whale-fishing. They approach him in a boat, and striking him with an iron har∣poon, stamped with the owner's mark, row away with the utmost expedition. If the fish be pro∣perly struck, he will die, and float to some part of the coast, unless the wind sets from shore; in which case he is carried out to sea, and lost. When he is found dead upon the beach, a certain share is, by the laws of Iceland, the property of him who owns the harpoon: the rest belongs to the pro∣prietor of the land. The fins and blubber are sold to the Danish merchants: the boiled flesh, left in the pot, they macerate in syre, which is as sour as vinegar, and then it becomes very good eating. The flesh of those whales that have teeth is, how∣ever, rejected as improper food. The spring whale, about eighteen feet long, delights in pursuing boats, and will jump surprisingly out of the water, in order to overwhelm them; but their eyelids fall down so as to blind them, as soon as they leap above the surface. The Icelanders catch plenty of porcpisces eight feet long, which swim very slowly, are easily frightened, and killed wth harpoons: their flesh is eaten by the natives. The sea-calf, or white shark, which the Icelanders call haakal, is sometimes found eighteen feet long, with a liver that will yield sixty gallons of oil: they are caught in great numbers by means of a machine, fur∣nished with large baited hooks, secured by iron chains, and fastened to a buoy that floats upon the
<PB N="126" REF="1350"/>
surface. The flesh is accounted good eating; but never used until it has been hung up for a twelve∣month: then it tastes like smoaked salmon. Here is the sword or saw-fish; and a great number of seals, distinguished into the different classes of the land-seal, the island-seal, and the Greenland-seal. The first is the smallest, and harbours among the rocks on different parts of the coast, at the mouths of creeks and rivers. The other two species are from four to ten feet in length. The island-seals are so called because they reside upon desolate islands round the coast. The seals from Green∣land arrive annually at the northern parts of the country in the month of December, and tarry till May. They are caught in a kind of labyrinth formed by large nets, in which they sometimes find two hundred at one draught. Those that bask themselves on the uninhabited islands are knocked down with clubs; and the land-seals are generally shot from a rifled barrel. All these ani∣mals yield a great proportion of train-oil, and their skins are sold at a good price. The fresh-water fish of Iceland are trout, salmon, and eels, which are taken in great quantities in lakes and rivers that communicate with the sea. The salmon swims against the stream; and when he arrives at a water∣fall, will jump to an incredible height, with a view to surmount this obstruction. Of delicate trout there is such abundance in some parts of Iceland, that the natives make them into flat-fish, and live upon them during the winter.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>No snakes are ever seen in Iceland; nor is any country on the globe less troubled with insects and vermin. Flies and gnats, indeed, are troublesome in the summer: and a sort of worm appears in wet
<PB N="127" REF="1360"/>
weather, which the inhabitants imagine falls with the rain.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>Iceland is so far from being populous, that the whole number of inhabitants does not exceed four∣score thousand. In the fourteenth century the island was almost depopulated by a pestilential dis∣temper, called sorte-dod, which extended itself to Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. The people of Iceland likewise suffered grievously by the small∣pox, and other calamities, insomuch that not one tenth part of the island is now inhabited. The natives, for the most part, live along the sea-coast, though there are some families likewise settled above one hundred miles up in the country. There are two and twenty harbours in Iceland; and at each of these is built a factory, or little town, where the company of merchants trade with the inhabitants. Besides these, there are many small villages, consisting of forty or fifty houses, huts, and cottages: but the island is divided into parishes, and, in general, every family lives apart from its neighbour, in a detached farm.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Their LANGUAGE and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Icelanders, who were originally a colony from Norway, still speak the old Norwegian dia∣lect, though they have adopted a great number of words and terms from the Scots, with whom they heretofore maintained a considerable traffick. The Lutheran doctrine is the only religion here tole∣rated. The country is divided into two bishop∣ricks; namely, the see of Skalholt for the south, and that of Hoolum for the north. Each of these is provided with a Latin school, governed by a rector, and other assistants, who teach the lan∣guages,
<PB N="128" REF="1370"/>
theology, and other branches of litera∣ture, so as to qualify youth for the ministry, and that they may be ordained priests in the island: many, however, prosecute their studies at the uni∣versity of Copenhagen. The revenue of each bishop amounts to about two thousand rixdollars; from which, however, he must maintain the rector and corrector, the minister of the cathedral church, and a certain number of scholars. At the time of the reformation great part of the church revenues was secularized, and now belong to the king. The livings are generally moderate, and some of them very poor. The clergy here have no tythes; but some small dues are payed to them, either in merchandize or money. Some of these ministers are so needy, that they are obliged to earn a hard subsistence by fishing, or other manual labour: they are generally persons of good morals, and pos∣sess a tolerable share of school learning. The churches are generally low, and but indifferently decorated: nevertheless they are clean, decent, and commodious. For the most part they belong to individuals, who make no scruple of stowing their chests of merchandize in the loft over the place of worship, which is always neatly wainscotted, and furnished with pulpit, altar, desk, and pews.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>GOVERNMENT and LAWS.</HEAD>
<P>The Icelanders are ruled by a governor called Staffts-amptmand, or rather by his deputy the Amptmand: the former is generally chosen by the king from the Danish nobility, and resides at Co∣penhagen; but the amptmand always lives in Ice∣land at the king's palace of Ressested, on a salary of four hundred rixdollars. His majesty likewise appoints a receiver, who collects all the taxes and revenues, and transmits them to the treasury. Be∣sides the steward there are susselmen, who farm
<PB N="129" REF="1380"/>
the king's taxes in certain districts, and act as jus∣tices of the peace, each within his own province. The king's revenues in Iceland arise from taxes and dues, an annual sum payed by the company of merchants, secularized abbey-lands, and other royal demesnes farmed out to the natives.</P>
<P>Law-suits concerning freehold property, are de∣termined by the Norwegian law: but in every dis∣pute relating to <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum,</HI> the old Iceland law takes place. The old ecclesiastical law is abolished; and cases of tythes, or other spiritual matters, are decided by the law of Norway, or by royal edicts: these likewise obtain in criminal processes. There are two judges, called langmaend, that preside over the southern and northern divisions, and some∣times deputies are allowed. Actions are first brought in the court of the Sysselman, from whence they may be evoked to the Langret, or general court, held at Oxeraae, under one of the judges: from this again an appeal may be lodged at the high court, in which the deputy-governor presides, with the other judge, and eleven syssel∣men as his assessors. If the cause be of great con∣sequence, the last resource is the supreme court at Copenhagen. In spiritual cases the deputy gover∣nor sits as judge, with the deans and clergy as his assessors. In Iceland there is no other legal way of punishing men with death than beheading with an ax, and hanging: the women, condemned to die, are sewed in a sack and drowned.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHARACTER, MANNERS, and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>The Icelanders are generally sober, honest, do∣cile, and industrious. They amuse themselves with cards and chess: they sing rude songs, re∣citing the exploits of their ancestors, and dance in a rustic manner to the sound of a fiddle, at their festivals. They are, like all other people who
<PB N="130" REF="1390"/>
dwell in cold countries, fond of drinking spirituous liquors, though few are in a condition to purchase any considerable quantity: but the most disagree∣able part of their character is their litigious dispo∣sition, which they inherit from their Norwegian forefathers. The people of this country are well∣formed by nature, and endowed with a consider∣able share of bodily strength; though they seldom attain to a very old age. While children, they are tenderly nursed at home; but, as soon as they are strong enough to row a boat, they engage in the fishery. This is a life of toil and hardship, to which they quickly become inured. In the exer∣cise of this profession they are so hardy, and care∣less of health, that they frequently leap into the sea, in order to save their boats from the rocks, and never dream of shifting their wet clothes, even in frosty weather. These practices, however, have an evident effect upon their constitutions. About the age of fifty they begin to decay, and are sub∣ject to various distempers. The rheumatism, fe∣vers, asthma, and consumption are incident to the Icelanders: but the leprosy, or rather a kind of hereditary scurvy, is the prevailing disease. Nor are they exempted from cholicks, hypochondriacy, and other disorders; and their women are very subject to hard and dangerous labours. These calamities are the more felt, as there is neither physician nor surgeon on the island. When the natives are seized with any distemper, they abstain from the use of tobacco and spirituous liquors, drink large quantities of boiled whey, and leave the cure to Nature. The women are rather deli∣cate than healthy: except at the season of hay∣making, they are used to a sedentary life, in clean∣ing and combing wool, spinning or knitting gloves or stockings, and in weaving coarse cloth, of which they make shoes and apparel. The chil∣dren
<PB N="131" REF="1400"/>
are mostly bred up by hand, fed with cows milk, which they suck through a horn, rocked in cradles, dressed up in swaddling cloaths, and nursed with a degree of tenderness not at all conform∣able to the hard, toilsome, penurious lives they are doomed to lead.</P>
<P>The Icelanders consume great quantities of fresh fish, and mutton, which is generally overboiled. They use a great deal of butter in their sauce, as well as milk in their common diet. In the sour whey, called syre, they pickle sheeps-heads, after the skin has been well singed and scraped; and these they fry occasionally. Every creditable farmer kills at the rate of twenty sheep for his winter pro∣vision, besides the fish which he cures for the same purpose. As no corn is raised in Iceland, the common people seldom eat bread, except at feasts and festivals. Yet there is some wild corn that grows in the district of Skaftefield, of which the natives make good flour and bread, equally nou∣rishing and agreeable to the palate. This kind of corn shoots up in deep sand, two feet and a half in height, with long ears, resembling the wheat of Denmark. The people being ill provided with mills, dry it before the fire, until it is scorched, that it may be the more easily brayed; therefore the bread is blacker than that which is made of rye in Denmark. In lieu of bread, the Icelanders use dried fish, well beaten, and eaten unboiled with butter spread upon it: dried trout and whiting are very delicious when dressed in this manner. The common drink of the Icelanders is water alone, or water mixed with syre. The better sort import malt and hops, with which they brew their own beer; and at the factories they purchase French wine and brandy: but these are used very sparing∣ly. The vulgar cannot afford to buy them in any quantity, all their merchandize being barely
<PB N="132" REF="1410"/>
sufficient to purchase meal, timber, fishing-lines, and hooks, iron, cloth, and other indispensible necessaries.</P>
<P>The Iceland women are commonly clad in pet∣ticoats, and aprons of coloured Danish cloth. The better sort of both sexes wear cloth jackets: the men have wide breeches, or trowsers, in the Danish fashion, and great coats, which they wear in win∣ter. The women likewise use an upper garment of black cloth, with narrow sleeves that reach down to the wrist, which, in common with the man's great coat, is called <HI>hempe:</HI> sometimes these robes are faced with black velvet, and adorned with silver or gilt clasps and buttons. Their coloured petti∣coats and aprons are bordered with velvet, or co∣loured silk ribbands; and three great worked silver or brass buttons are fixed before. Their jackets are laced down the seams in the same manner, and the sleeve is secured near the wrist with two or three silver or brass buttons. Their head-dress is composed of three handkerchiefs, formed like a tuft on the top of the head, a foot and a half high, and a fourth handkerchief of silk or cotton is pinned round their necks. A bride on her wedding∣day wears a crown of silver under the white linnen tuft, together with three silver chains, one of which hangs down behind, and the other two dangle on her breast: to one of these is fixed a box of per∣fumes, with several partitions, and open on both sides. An Iceland lady shall sometimes possess trinkets to the value of four hundred rixdollars. The women of this country make their own shoes of ox-hide or sheeps-skin. The shirts and shifts of the Icelanders are generally of thin bays, or slannel, though the better sort wear them of a kind of coarse linnen. The men, in fishing, wear a garment of sheep-skin over their cloaths, and this they frequently soften by daubing it with fish-liver.
<PB N="133" REF="1420"/>
The habitations in Iceland nearly resemble those of Norway; with this difference, that as they are not so well supplied with timber, they make more use of stones, turf, and mud-walls. The better sort possess tolerable houses, well furnished. The farmers are ill-provided with glass, in lieu of which they commonly use the membranes of sheep for their windows; and these transmit a tolerable de∣gree of light, by which they see to work within doors. Their roofs are either boarded or thatched, and their walls are comfortably thick and warm.</P>
<P>The Icelanders are remarkably ingenious and docile. The country not only affords a great num∣ber of able boat-carpenters and handicraftsmen, but has likewise produced many men of distin∣guished learning. Such is their genius or capacity for the mechanic arts, that many persons make great progress in different branches, without having received the least instruction. As there are no public schools in this country, the children are taught to read and instructed in the articles of religion at home by their own parents, or by the ministers of the different parishes, in the course of their visitations. The people of Iceland do not measure time by the clock or hour; but take their observations from the sun, stars, or tide, which last is always regular, and parcel out the day into different divisions, each of these having its own appellation; such as midnight, twilight, broad-day, forenoon, noon, afternoon, evening, mid-evening, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They weave, mill, and full their coarse bays, called vadmel, in a very auk∣ward, laborious, and imperfect manner. The women use neither soap nor lye in washing their cloaths; but save urine alone for this purpose. By means of urine too they extract verdigrease from copper vessels, and with this they dye their wool∣len
<PB N="134" REF="1430"/>
yarn. Thus they are enabled to make pretty striped stuffs of various colours.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The exports of Iceland consist of dried fish, salted mutton and lamb, beef, butter, tallow, train∣oil, coarse woollen cloth, stockings, gloves, raw wool, sheep-skins, lamb-skins, fox furs of various colours, edder-down, feathers, and formerly sul∣phur; but there is no longer a demand for this mineral. On the other hand, the Icelanders im∣port timber, fishing-lines and hooks, tobacco, bread, horse-shoes, brandy, wine, salt, linnen, a little silk, and a few other necessaries, as well as superfluities for the better sort. The whole trade of Iceland is engrossed by a monopoly of Danes, indulged with an exclusive charter. This com∣pany maintains factories at all the harbours of Ice∣land, where they exchange their foreign goods for the merchandize of the country; and, as the bal∣lance is in favour of the Icelanders, pay the over∣plus in Danish money, which is the only current coin in this island. All their accompts and pay∣ments are adjusted according to the number of fish: two pounds of fish are worth two skillings in spe∣cie, and eight and forty fish amount to one rix∣dollar. A Danish crown is computed at thirty fish: what falls under the value of twelve fish, cannot be payed in money; but must be bartered either for fish or roll-tobacco, an ell of which is equal to one fish. The weights and measures of the Icelanders are nearly the same with those used in Denmark.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>STRENGTH and REVENUE.</HEAD>
<P>The Icelanders being neither numerous nor war∣like, and altogether unprovided with arms, am∣munition, garrisons, or fleets, are in no condition
<PB N="135" REF="1440"/>
to defend themselves from invasion; but depend intirely on the protection of his Danish majesty, to whom they are subject.</P>
<P>The revenues which he draws from this island consist of the income of divers estates, as royal demesne, amounting to about eight thousand dol∣lars <HI>per annum;</HI> of the money payed by the com∣pany for an exclusive trade, to the value of twenty thousand dollars; and of a fixed proportion in the tythes of fish, payed in some particular districts.</P>

<HEAD>THE ISLANDS OF FARROE, or FERO.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SITUATION and EXTENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE islands so called, from the word Fer∣royer, which, in the Norwegian language, signifies <HI>Ferries,</HI> are twenty-four in number, lying in a cluster, divided by deep and rapid channels, between 61 and 63 degrees of northern latitude, and between 6 and 8 degrees of west longitude from London. The space in which they are scat∣tered extends about sixty miles in length, and forty in breadth, to the westward of Norway; having Shetland and the Orkneys on the south-east, and Greenland and Iceland upon the north and north∣west. They are all indented by the sea, and fur∣nished with many inlets, creeks, and harbours, that afford protection to fishermen and mariners.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="1450"/>
Stromoe, the largest of these islands, stretches about seventeen miles in length, and eight in breadth. Of the four and twenty islands, seven are very small and inconsiderable, distinguished from the others by the name of Holmes, kept for pasture. There are also divers rocks rising above the surface of the sea, some of which it is neces∣sary that mariners should know. One, to the northward of the island Fugloe, is called the Bishop, being round and high. Another, towards the south∣east part of the island Suderoe, is known by the ap∣pellation of Monk: this too is an high round rock; and in the neighbourhood is a dangerous whirl∣pool, in the vortex of which ships are sometimes destroyed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>These islands are generally hilly, and surrounded with cliffs towards the sea-coast. In Stromoe there is a very high hill, called Skellingsfels, that serves as a direction for sailors bound to the north en∣trance of Thorshaven, on the southermost part of the island, which is the chief seat of trade. The small island Kolter boasts a mountain, that rises two hundred fathoms above the surface of the water. The island Store-diemen, being of a round figure, and about a large mile in diameter, is quite sur∣rounded by perpendicular rocks, except at one place, where one man at a time can hardly gain admittance; so that it might, with very little ex∣pence, be rendered an impregnable fortress.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CURRENTS, WHIRLPOOLS, LAKES, and FOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>The currents and streams that run between the islands are extremely violent; and when the wind blows strongly against them, the conflict produces a very turbulent agitation of the sea. Here are
<PB N="137" REF="1460"/>
several whirlpools; but the most dangerous of all is that near the rock called the Monk, in which divers ships have been swallowed down, shattered to pieces, and thrown up again in fragments. In the middle of this gulph the water is not above twelve fathoms deep: the ground is rocky, pointed, and circumvoluted like a conch-shell, with sharp prominences or cliffs about eight fathoms long, and twelve fathoms distant one from another. At a little distance from this inner vortex, the sea is be∣tween twenty-five and thirty fathoms in depth; and farther out, a great deal deeper. In the very center there is a deep hole, the bottom of which is about sixty fathoms from the surface. On the east side there is a gulph, through which the sea runs in as through a sluice. When any vessel is sucked within the central cliffs, it is whirled round four circles with such rapidity, that the people on board lie down, to avoid being giddy; and, on this occasion, the compass being spoiled, runs round with the whirlpool. These circumstances have been learned in very calm weather, and at low water, when people have ventured upon it, in their way to the rock called the Monk, on which they catch abundance of sea-fowl. They likewise observe, that on the top of this rock the air is so excessive cold, even in the hottest day of summer, that they can scarce endure it, and the fowl are so lean as to yield nothing but feathers. This cold is sup∣posed to proceed from some magnetic virtue in the rock, which likewise affects the needle of the compass.</P>
<P>The Farroe islands are well supplied with fresh wholsome water from plenty of fountains, some of them on the tops of the highest mountains; from whence they trickle down, and form rivu∣lets to water the subjacent plains. There is one medicinal spring in the island of Osteroe, sup∣posed to flow over a bed of sulphur, because
<PB N="138" REF="1470"/>
the water is warmer in winter than that of other fountains. In Suderoe, pretty high up in a moun∣tain, we find a small lake, the water of which ebbs and flows with the sea.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LIGHT, AIR, and CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>At the summer solstice there is no night for a whole month in these islands, the sun being but a few degrees under the horizon. In the longest day the sun rises seven minutes after two in the morning, and sets fifty-three minutes after nine: but the light is continued in the twilight and dawn. In the shortest day the sun rises fifty-three minutes after nine in the morning, and sets seven minutes after two in the afternoon: the dawn and twilight, however, eke out this short day, in such a manner, that the people can see to work from eight in the morning till four in the afternoon.</P>
<P>The air is moist, as in all hilly countries, en∣vironed by the sea; and so temperate, with respect to heat and cold, that the natives allow their horses and sheep to graze abroad all the winter. But the number, height, and arrangement of their mountains, rocks, and hills, collect such enormous clouds, and break the current of the air in such a manner, as produces the most violent and sudden blasts, storms, and whirlwinds. Nay, the tops of the mountains are frequently subject to terrible agitations of wind, when the atmosphere is so calm in the valleys, that the inhabitants carry lighted candles from house to house, without any danger of their being extinguished. The whirlwinds are so sudden and dangerous, that the people, being forewarned of their approach, by a dreadful noise among the rocks, take immediate precautions to elude their fury. The mariner forthwith furls his sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls: the traveller at land alights from his horse,
<PB N="139" REF="1480"/>
throws himself flat on his face, and clings to grass, bushes, or stones, until the blast be over.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, VEGETABLES, and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>The rocks in these islands are, for the most part, covered with a thin coat of earth, that yields some pasture for the sheep. In the valleys we find a rich mould, about two feet in thickness, which produces plenty of grass and barley; the only species of corn that will here come to maturity. Their pastures are so fat, that a small ox frequently yields an hundred pounds of tallow. It is observed, that the vegetation of the corn and grass is scarce perceivable at the summer solstice, when there is no darkness; but that they grow apace as the night begins to lengthen. Here are no trees but willows, and some low shrubs of ju∣niper. The natives have planted fruit-trees with∣out success. Their chief fuel is turf; though coal is found in some parts, but worked with great difficulty. No mines have as yet been discovered on the islands of Farroe: but they yield some talc, a small quantity of sorry chrystal, and a mean sort of yellow stones resembling the topaz. Here like∣wise are found a few pearl muscles.</P>

<P>The farmers of these islands breed horses, horned cattle, and sheep. These are all of small size, and generally provide for themselves in the fields during winter, as well as summer, except when the snow lies very deep. The horses are strong, swift, and so sure-footed, that in climbing hills and rocks, a man thinks himself much more secure on horseback than a-foot. They are never shod; and the natives train them to hunt wild sheep: for some of their flocks roam wild upon
<PB N="140" REF="1490"/>
the hills and mountains; and some are kept tame in separate inclosures: yet even these have nothing but earthen dykes to defend them from the north winds in winter. A number of sheep are some∣times covered with a wreath of snow, and remain in this condition for two or three weeks; during which they dig for the roots of the grass, and even eat the wool off one another. These islands are haunted by swarms of land and sea-fowls, which yield them great store of flesh and eggs for food; of down and feathers for sale. But the article in which the natives heretofore found their greatest advantage was the fishery, which is now greatly decayed. Nevertheless, they still catch abundance of cod, whiting, flounders, pilchards, and other fish, that swarm in the northern sea: but having no salt, they cannot cure them for exportation. Of seals they kill a great number every year: these animals are sometimes taken by dogs, trained to the sport. They swim towards the seal against the wind, that the smell may not be perceived, then seize him by the throat, and hold him until the master can come up and put him to death. They are likewise caught in nets, and knocked down with clubs, in caverns where they litter. The skin is made into shoes, pouches, and other kinds of furniture. The flesh is eaten: part of the fat is melted into train-oil; and part of it salted up for food with a sort of coarse black salt, extracted from the ashes of burnt sea-weed.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of these islands likewise kill many small whales, from six to sixteen feet in length: they approach the land in great numbers, when the wea∣ther is dark or hazy: then the fishermen assemble in their boats, and, by shouting and throwing stones, drive them into creeks and inlets, where they are killed with whale-spears, and hauled on shore. The tythe being first deducted, one fish
<PB N="141" REF="1500"/>
is allotted as a premium to him who first discovered the shoal: the rest are divided into two equal parts, one for the fishermen, and the other for the pro∣prietor of the land where the whales are brought ashore. The fat is either melted into oil, salted up as bacon, or used as butter. The flesh is eaten, and tastes like beef: part of it they cut into long slices, and dry in the wind: the tail eats like cow∣heel, and is often pickled by the people of different nations.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The LANGUAGE, RELIGION, LAWS, and GOVERNMENT of these ISLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>The people of Farroe speak the Norwegian dia∣lect, with a mixture of Danish idioms. They profess the Lutheran religion, under the ecclesias∣tical jurisdiction of a provost. The whole country is divided into seven districts, containing thirty∣nine parishes. Their churches are mean, their livings very small, and the inhabitants of the little remote islands very ill served, on account of the boisterous weather, and dangerous streams by which they are divided. There is but one school, which is established at their chief town Thorshaven: the priest of that place is master, and has an ex∣traordinary salary from the king for this office. Some students from this island are entertained gratis, and bred up as clergymen, at the university of Copenhagen.</P>
<P>The Farroe islands are subject to the king of Denmark, who confers the government of them upon some person of quality at court. The go∣vernor appoints a deputy, and sheriffs, to admi∣nister justice, and superintend the commerce of these islands, which are divided into six districts or provinces. Each of these is provided with a sheriff, who determines small causes in his own
<PB N="142" REF="1510"/>
province: but matters of importance are referred to the great annual session at Thorshaven, in which the deputy-governor presides. There is likewise a spring session in every district, held by this deputy, assisted by the six sheriffs, a sworn recorder, and the clergy of the province. The same gentleman is, moreover, president of the synod held annually for the determination of ecclesiastical causes, with the advice and assistance of the provost and his clergy. The laws of Denmark prevail in these islands: yet they have particular statutes of their own, and among others the <HI>sheep ordinance,</HI> relating to the oeconomy of their flocks, ascertaining their property in the sheep as well as in the inclosures for pasture.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Their CHARACTER, MANNERS, CUS∣TOMS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The people of these islands are mild, humble, extremely hospitable, religious, and temperate: they live commonly on flesh, fish, milk, or gruel, without tasting either bread, salt, or beer, except at Christmas, when they indulge themselves with extraordinary cheer. Their usual cloathing is of coarse flannel. The men wear short wide coats: their women appear in boddice and petticoats, sewed together; but the holiday garments are of a better stuff, and different colours: linnen, how∣ever, is seldom used. They make all their own cloaths, and indeed every thing for which they have occasion. They are universal handicraftsmen, and excel the Norwegians in the branch of boat∣carpenters. They are not only parsimonious in their meals, and frugal in their apparel, but also utter strangers to every elegance of life. They lie upon beds of hay, covered with blankets. They assign to their female servants a certain quantity of
<PB N="143" REF="1520"/>
wool, which must be knit or spun within the day. Both sexes are almost continually employed: the women in weaving, knitting, and dying; the men in all other kinds of work. They very seldom in∣dulge themselves with chess, or any other pastime, except on holidays, festivals, and weddings: then they sing psalms, or ballads, amuse themselves with the chess-board, or gambol in rustic dances. They naturally observe the stars, and are particularly acquainted with the constellation Ursa Major, by which they distinguish the hours in the winter-mornings. The age of the moon they know by the increase and decrease of the tides, and thus compute the fixed and moveable feasts with great precision.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COMMERCE, STRENGTH, and RE∣VENUE of the FARROE ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>Their commerce, which is very inconsiderable, consists in their exporting to the nearest continent of Norway or Denmark, wool, woollen-cloths of different fineness, knit caps, gloves, and stockings, butter, train-oil, tallow, boats, down and feathers. These islands having been subject to piratical inva∣sions, king Christian IV. built a castle at Thors∣haven in the island of Stromoe, for the defence of that town, which is their chief seat of traffick. The court of Denmark arbitrarily imposes a tri∣bute, or tax, in which these poor islanders are obliged to acquiesce: but this must be a meer trifle, if at all proportionable to the lowness of their circumstances.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>SITUATION and EXTENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE antient <HI>Dania,</HI> or Denmark, properly so called, consists of Jutland, the Cherso∣nesus Cimbrica of the antients, which is part of the continent, and several islands in the Baltic. Jutland lies between the 54th and 59th degrees of north latitude, and from the 8th to the 15th degrees of longitude east from London, stretching from south to north about two hundred and twenty-four miles; being in breadth about twenty-four miles, at its broadest part: on the west and north it is washed by the German ocean: it is bounded on the east by the Schager-rock, or Cate∣gate, and the Middle-fort Sound, or Lesser Belt; and on the south the river Elbe divides it from the dutchies of Bremen and Lunenburg. This part of the continent includes the dutchies of Sleswic and Holstein, though this last is a fief of the empire. The other part, reckoned the most considerable half of Denmark, is constituted by the islands of
<PB N="145" REF="1540"/>
Zealand, Funen, Langeland, Laland, Falster, Bornholm, Mena, Fermeren, Alsen, Arroe, Sam∣soe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>Jutland is encumbered with barren mountains; but the interjacent vallies abound with excellent pasturage; yet the country, in general, produces very little corn. The most remarkable river of Denmark is the Eyder; which takes its rise near Segeberg, runs by Rendsbourg, and disembogues itself into the sea at Tonningen, after having di∣vided Sleswick from Holstein. There is not, how∣ever, one river in Denmark navigable to ships of any considerable burthen; for the Elbe does not properly belong to this country, though it forms one of the confines. There are some fresh-water lakes in the continental part of the kingdom, well replenished with delicious fish, and plenty of pure fountains and rivulets: the fresh water in the islands, however, is extremely foul and disagree∣able. The face of the country is also shaded with large forests, well stocked with a variety of game. But, notwithstanding the maritime situation of this kingdom, there is neither upon the continent, nor on the islands, one tolerable harbour, except that of Copenhagen, which is an excellent sea-port.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The cold in Denmark is not so severe as in some other parts of Germany, that are more to the south∣ward. The air is here tempered by the vapours from the sea, that surrounds it almost on every part. The same neighbourhood contributes to the mitigation of the summer's heat, by ventilating breezes. Here, however, we perceive no gradual spring, nor intermediate autumn; but a sudden
<PB N="146" REF="1550"/>
transition from cold to heat, and from sultry wea∣ther again to all the rigors of winter; so that in fact, there are but two seasons in Denmark. In the months of June, July, and August, the heat is very troublesome, the atmosphere being close, gloomy, and surcharged with vapours. At this period, the city of Copenhagen is so pestered with flies, that the people have recourse to a poisoned water, with which they sprinkle their kitchens and apartments. By this the vermin are so effectually destroyed, that whole bushels of dead flies are swept together in one chamber.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL: PRODUCTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>The soil varies in different places on the conti∣nent, and in the islands. There are good pas∣tures in all parts of the kingdom: the mountains here, as every where else, are barren; the vallies, fertile; but the soil in the islands is commonly sandy, and requires frequent rains, to produce even tolerable crops of rye.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The Danes breed vast herds of kine, flocks of sheep, hogs, and an excellent race of horses; but their cattle are small and meagre, except in the summer, when the beef is sweet and juicy. We∣ther mutton was heretofore unknown in Denmark; and therefore this species was generally eaten in lamb. The woods and forests are inhabited by stags, elks, and boars, hares, and all the quadru∣peds found in other mild countries. Here is great plenty of poultry and wild fowl; and the sea swarms with a variety of fish, such as we have described in our account of Norway: but on the side of the Baltic, the Danes are very ill supplied, whether from the indolence and want of skill of the inhabi∣tants, or (which is more likely) from the nature of
<PB N="147" REF="1560"/>
the water, which is rather brackish than salt, con∣sequently less agreeable to the fishes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE, RELIGION, LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>The language of Denmark is a dialect of the Teutonic, and bears a strong affinity to the Nor∣wegian tongue; but is disagreeable to strangers, on account of the drawling tone with which it is pro∣nounced. They have borrowed many words from the Germans; and, indeed, the high Dutch is used in common discourse by the court, the gentry, and the burghers. The better sort likewise understand French, and speak it fluently. The Lutheran doctrine is universally embraced through all Den∣mark, Sweden, and Norway; so that there is not another sect in these kingdoms. Denmark is di∣vided into six dioceses, one in Zealand, one in Fu∣nen, and four in Jutland: but the bishops are, properly speaking, no other than superintendants, or <HI>primi inter pares.</HI> They have no cathedrals, ec∣clesiastical courts, or temporalities. Their business is to inspect the doctrine and morals of the inferior clergy. They are not distinguished from other mi∣nisters by their habit, which consists of a black gown with short sleeves, a large ruff about the neck, and a round cap with edges, like those worn by our masters of arts. The revenue of the bishop of Copenhagen amounts to about two thousand rixdollars; and this is the richest benefice in the kingdom. The clergy are wholly dependent on the government. They never intermeddle, nor are employed or consulted in civil affairs. They, nevertheless, have acquired great influence, and erected a sort of spiritual tyranny over the minds of the common people, by whom they are much revered. They preach without notes, and inveigh severely against the vices of the great, whom they scruple not to attack personally. The commonalty
<PB N="148" REF="1570"/>
admire their courage, and the government con∣nives at their presumption, while they confine them∣selves to their own province of preaching. They are, generally speaking, men of exemplary lives, and some erudition. Their churches are kept more clean, and better adorned than those of England: the people are great lovers of musick, and their or∣ganists commonly entertain the congregation for half an hour before or after service. The state of literature is very low in Denmark. There is, in∣deed, an university at Copenhagen, but meanly endowed, and very ill supplied with masters. Taste and the belles lettres are utterly unknown in this country, which yet has produced some men of great eminence in mathematics and medicine; such as Tycho Brahe, Borrichius, and the Bartho∣lines.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION, GOVERNMENT, and LAWS.</HEAD>
<P>The constitution of Denmark was heretofore of the free Gothic original. The convention of the estates, even including the representatives of the boors or peasants, elected a king for his personal virtues, having still a regard to the son of their late monarch, whom, however, they made no scruple of setting aside, if they deemed him un∣worthy of the royal dignity. They enacted laws, conferred the great offices of state, debated all af∣fairs relating to commerce, peace, war, and alli∣ances, and occasionally gave their consent to the im∣position of necessary taxes. The king was no other than chief magistrate, generalissimo, and as it were prime minister to his people. His business was to see justice administered impartially; to command the army in time of war; to encourage industry, religion, arts, and sciences; and to watch over the
<PB N="149" REF="1580"/>
interests of his subjects. He had no public reve∣nue from the state, but lived like a private noble∣man from the produce of his own lands and de∣mesnes. Such was the constitution of Denmark, till the year 1660, when it underwent a very strange and surprising revolution. At the conclusion of the peace with Sweden, the nation resounded with the clamour of misery and discontent. There was nothing left in the public treasury, to pay off and disband the army, which therefore became insolent and licentious. The common people, and even the burghers, were exhausted by the long, expen∣sive war: the clergy were unsatisfied with their condition and want of importance; and the nobi∣lity were become proud and tyrannical. When the estates assembled to deliberate and redress the grivances of the nation, the commons proposed that an equal tax should be laid upon all persons, without distinction, in proportion to their circum∣stances. The nobles pleaded their privilege of be∣ing exempted from all imposition. The burghers alledged, that as the nobility engrossed all the lands and riches of the kingdom, it was reasonable that they should bear their share of the common burthen: violent disputes ensued. At length a nobleman, called Otto Craeg, stood up, and, in a transport of passion, told the commons, that they neither understood the privileges of the nobility, who were always exempted from such impositions, nor the condition of themselves, who were no other than their slaves. This inglorious term produced an immediate ferment in the assembly; and the hall resounded with murmurs and altercation. Nanson, speaker of the commons, starting up in a rage of indignation, swore that the nobility should repent their having branded the commons with such an opprobrious epithet. He had previously concerted the design with the bishop of Copenha∣gen,
<PB N="150" REF="1590"/>
and the court was not ignorant of their inten∣tion. The clergy and burghers, breaking up in disorder, marched under the auspices of these lea∣ders to the brewer's hall, where, after much de∣bate, they agreed to make a solemn tender of their freedom and services to the king, that he might become absolute monarch of the realm, and see the right of hereditary succession established in his fa∣mily. Next morning they marched in couples, each burgher being paired with a clergyman, through the streets, which were filled with the po∣pulace, who shouted as they passed, to the coun∣cil-hall, where the nobles had reassembled. There Nanson, in a short harangue, signified the intention of the clergy and commons, demanded the concur∣rence of the nobles, and threatened that, in case of a refusal, they would forthwith proceed without them to the palace. The nobles were confounded and abashed. They endeavoured to gain time: they professed a desire of concurring with the other states; but desired that an affair of such conse∣quence might not be precipitated. The others be∣ing deaf to their remonstrances and intreaties, con∣tinued their procession to the palace, where they were met by the prime minister, who conducted them to the hall of audience. There the bishop of Copenhagen, in a florid speech, as deputy from the two orders, made a solemn tender to the king of an absolute and hereditary dominion; assuring his majesty, that he might command their purses and arms, to support a measure so necessary to the welfare of his people. The king received them graciously, assented to the proposal, thanked them for their zeal and confidence, and assured them they might depend upon his royal favour and protection. The city-gates were immediately shut, that none of the senators should escape: a precau∣tion by which the nobles were so intimidated, that
<PB N="151" REF="1600"/>
they immediately signified their readiness to concur with the step which the other two orders had taken. Preparations were forthwith made for this strange inauguration. Scaffolds were raised in the open space before the castle; and the troops and burghers received orders to appear in arms, under their re∣spective officers. On the sixteenth day of October, in the year 1660, the king, queen, and royal family, ascended an open theatre, and placing themselves on chairs of state, under canopies of velvet, received in public the homage of all the senators, nobility, clergy, and commons, couched in an oath of al∣legiance composed for the purpose. Thus the people, with a rash and desperate hand, from mo∣tives of revenge, fomented by an artful ministry and ambitious clergy, resigned their liberty and independence, and invested their sovereign with a despotic power over their lives and fortunes. The king of Denmark is now so absolute, that he not only can impose what tolls and taxes he shall think convenient; but also, by a maxim in the present jurisprudence of that nation, he enjoys the prero∣gative of explaining the law, and even of altering it occasionally.</P>
<P>The laws of Denmark are just, equitable, per∣spicuous, and so concise that the whole body is contained in one quarto volume, written in the language of the country. Every man may plead his own cause, without employing either council or attorney: but there are a few advocates for the benefit of those who cannot or will not speak in their own defence. The proceedings are so summary, that a suit may be carried through all the courts, and finally decided in thirteen months. There are three courts in Denmark, and an appeal lies from the inferior to the superior tribunal. The lowest of these is in cities and towns, denominated
<PB N="152" REF="1610"/>
the <HI>Byfoglids Court,</HI> and in the country the <HI>Herreds∣fougds.</HI> Causes may be appealed from this to the <HI>Landstag,</HI> or general head court for the province: but the final appeal lies to the court of <HI>High-right</HI> in Copenhagen, where the king presides in per∣son, assisted by the prime nobility. The judges of the two other courts are appointed by his ma∣jesty's letters patent, to sit and determine causes <HI>durante bene placito.</HI> These are punishable for any misdemeanours of which they may be guilty; and when convicted of having passed an unjust sentence, they are condemned to make reparation to the in∣jured party. Their salaries are very inconsiderable, and paid out of the king's treasury, from the fines of delinquents, besides a small gratuity from the plaintiff and defendant when sentence is passed. In a word, here is no encouragement for chica∣nery, and no countenance given to corruption. Such is the peculiar privelege enjoyed by the city of Copenhagen, that causes appealed from the <HI>Byfoglids Court,</HI> instead of passing through the provincial court, are tried by the burgomaster and common council; from whence they proceed im∣mediately to the highest court, as the last resource. Affairs relating to the revenue are determined in the rent-chamber of Denmark, which is analogous to our court of exchequer. To another tribunal, composed of some members from this rent-chamber, from the admiralty, and college of commerce, mer∣chants appeal for redress, when their commodities are seized for non-payment of duties. All dis∣putes relating to the sea are determined by the court of admiralty, constituted of commissioners appointed for these purposes. The chancellary may be more properly termed a secretary's office. It consists of clerks, who write and issue all the king's decrees and citations, transcribe papers,
<PB N="153" REF="1620"/>
and, according to the directions they receive, make draughts of treaties and alliances with other na∣tions. The government of Denmark is very com∣mendable for the excellent policy it maintains. Justice is executed upon criminals with great se∣verity; and such regulations are established as effec∣tually prevent those outrages that are daily com∣mitted in other countries. No man presumes to wag his tongue against the government, far less to hatch schemes of treason. All the subjects are, or seem to be, attached to their sovereign by the ties of affection. Robbery on the highway, bur∣glary, coining or clipping, are crimes seldom or never heard of in Denmark. The capital crimes usually committed are theft and manslaughter. Such offenders are beheaded very dexterously with one stroke of a sword. The executioner, though infamous, is commonly rich: because, over and above the functions of his office, he is employed in other scandalous occupations, which no other person will undertake. He, by means of his un∣derstrapper, called the Pracher, empties all the jakes, and removes from houses, stables, or streets, dead dogs and horses, which no other Dane will vouchsafe to touch on any consideration whatso∣ever.</P>
<P>In Copenhagen there is a master of the police, who superintends the oeconomy of that city. He inspects all sorts of merchandize, and compromises the differences that arise between traders and handicraftsmen, when they interfere with the pro∣fessions of each other. He takes care that the public buildings, draw-bridges, and canals be kept in repair; that the streets are well paved, cleansed, and free of incumbrances. He prevents the prac∣tice of smuggling prohibited goods; regulates the price of bread, and the rates of travelling; punishes extortioners and poachers; suppresses riots, and
<PB N="154" REF="1630"/>
provides immediate assistance in case of fire. There are select companies appointed for this purpose. The chimney-sweepers are bound to keep a regis∣ter of all the chimnies they sweep, that in case of an accident from a foul vent the owner may be convicted, and punished for his avarice or neglect. No torches are allowed to be carried through the streets of this city, because great part of the houses are of timber, and the wind is generally high. In lieu of flambeaux, the court and quality use large round lanthorns, fixed to the end of long poles. In a word, the master of the police regulates every thing that relates to the decency, good order, quiet, and security of the capital. The apothecaries in this kingdom are under excellent regulations: their number at Copenhagen is restricted to two; and one is allowed to every other town of importance. They are examined and appointed by the college of physicians, and confirmed by the king himself; otherwise they cannot exercise the profession. Their shops are visited three times a year by the magis∣trates, accompanied with physicians, who inspect their medicines and regulate the prices. They are obliged to keep an exact account of every thing they sell, to specify the name of the person who bought it, and that of the doctor by whom it was prescribed; so that accidents are prevented, and murders by poison easily discovered.</P>
<P>Denmark is divided into seven districts, four of which are included in Jutland, and the other three in the islands: each of these is subdivided into three lesser jurisdictions, called <HI>Ampts.</HI> Over every district the king appoints a governor, or <HI>Stifts∣ampts-man,</HI> of the best quality: his deputy the <HI>Ampts-man</HI> is usually a gentleman, who resides in the principal town of the district, and takes all the trouble from his superior: he collects the king's revenues, assigns quarters to the soldiers,
<PB N="155" REF="1640"/>
provides for them on the march, and employs the peasants in public works. The governor enjoys a yearly salary of a thousand crowns from the king's treasury; and his deputy is gratified with four hun∣dred: but they enjoy other privileges, which are necessarily annexed to their office. In the regula∣tion of public taxes, they find means to shift the burthen from their own estates: they possess great power and authority in their several districts, and fleece the peasants with impunity. These offices are commonly bestowed upon the favourites of the court, and those who are intitled to some provision for their faithful services.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHARACTER of the PEOPLE: Their MAN∣NERS and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>The nobility and gentry of Denmark are all in∣cluded in the term Noblesse, and formerly there was no distinctions of title: but, within these sixty years, some few favourites have been dignified with the titles of Count and Baron. These, and these only, enjoy the privilege to dispose of their estates by will, otherwise than in the manner which the law directs. Others, indeed, may make parti∣cular dispositions, provided they have interest suf∣ficient to procure the king's approbation and sig∣nature. The Danish noblesse, heretofore, lived at their own seats with great magnificence and hospi∣tality; and, at the convention of the estates, met their king with numerous and superb retinues: but, since he became absolute, they have sunk to a very low condition. They are so impoverished by exorbitant taxes, that they can hardly procure the means of subsistence; and, for the most part, live obscurely in some corner of their ruined coun∣try palaces, unless they have interest enough to obtain a civil or military employment at court. For this purpose they exert all their industry, influence,
<PB N="156" REF="1650"/>
and address, that their estates may be sheltered from the exactions of collectors, and find means to defray the expence of their living. They no longer inherit the spirit and virtues of their an∣cestors; but are become servile, indolent, osten∣tatious, extravagant, and oppressive.</P>
<P>Their general character is a strange composition of pride and meanness, insolence and poverty. If any gentleman can find a purchaser for his estate, the king, by the Danish law, has a right to one third of the purchase-money: but the lands are so burthened with impositions, that there would be no danger of alienation, even if this restriction was not in force: no person would offer money for an estate to be held on such terms; and some gen∣tlemen have actually offered to make a surrender to the king of large tracts of fertile land, situated in the island of Zealand. Conscious that they en∣joy their possessions, thus encumbered, at the nod of an arbitrary sovereign, they are at little or no pains to improve their estates; and they look upon trade as an employment beneath their dignity. They therefore rack their tenants with the utmost oppression, in order to procure the immediate means of gratifying their vanity, gluttony, and extrava∣gance. They maintain splendid equipages, wear fine cloaths, drink a vast quantity of French wine, and indulge themselves with eating to excess. Those courtiers who derive money from their em∣ployments, instead of purchasing land in Den∣mark, remit their cash to the banks of Hamburgh and Amsterdam. The merchant and burgher treads in the footsteps of their superiors: they spend all their gains in luxury and pleasure, with an impa∣tient avidity, as if they are afraid of incurring the suspicion of affluence, and of being stripped by taxation. The peasant or boor follows the same example: no sooner has he earned a rixdollar than
<PB N="157" REF="1660"/>
he makes haste to expend it in brandy, lest it should fall into the hand of his oppressive land∣lord. This lower class of people are as absolute slaves as the negroes in the West-Indies, and sub∣sist upon much harder fare. The value of estates is not computed by the number of acres, but by the stock of boors, who, like the timber, are reckoned parcel of the freehold. Heretofore the Danish peasants lived comfortably: they were lodged warm, wore good cloaths, fed upon whol∣some fresh provision, and every house could pro∣duce a parcel of plate, with gold rings, and other ornaments, which they are ambitious of possessing even at this day: but now they are quite impo∣verished, and nothing can be more wretched than their condition. They feed upon stock-fish, salted meats, and other coarse diet: there is not the least piece of furniture of any value in their houses, except feather-beds, which are excellent, and in great plenty in Denmark: these are not only used as beds to lie upon, but also as coverings in lieu of blankets. After the boor has laboured like a drudge to raise the king's taxes, he must pay the overplus of his toil to his needy landlord. Should he improve his ground, and repair his farm-house, his cruel master will immediately transplant him from thence to a barren farm, and a naked habi∣tation, that he may let the improved ground at a higher price to another tenant. This barbarous practice is such a discouragement to industry, that in a little time there will be no farm-houses in the country, unless they are rebuilt or repaired at the landlord's expence. The peasants likewise sustain abundance of damage and violence from the licen∣tious soldiers, that are quartered in their houses. They are moreover obliged to furnish horses and waggons for the royal family, and all their at∣tendants, when the king makes a progress through
<PB N="158" REF="1670"/>
the country, or removes his residence from one palace to another. On such occasions the neigh∣bouring boors are summoned to assemble with their cattle and carriages; and not only obliged to live at their own expence, but also to bear every species of outrage and abuse from the lowest lacquies of those who attend his majesty. All persons, of any rank above the vulgar, dress in the French taste, and affect finery; but the winter-dress of the ladies is peculiar to the country, very neat, warm, and becoming. The common people are likewise re∣markably neat, and pride themselves in different changes of linnen. They are very little addicted to jollity and diversion: their whole amusements consist in running at the goose on Shrove-Tuesday, and in being drawn in sleds upon the ice during winter: they, moreover, feast and make merry at weddings and funerals. With respect to marriage, the man and woman frequently cohabit together on contract, long before the ceremony is per∣formed. The nobility and gentry pique them∣selves upon sumptuous burials and monuments for the dead: the corpse is very often kept in a vault, or the chancel of a church, for several years, before a proper opportunity occurs for celebrating the funeral.</P>
<P>The warlike genius of the Danes no longer sub∣sists: the common people are mean-spirited, suspi∣cious, and deceitful; nor have they that talent for mechanics, and natural ingenuity, so remarkable in some other northern nations.</P>
<P>While the peasants are employed without doors in their country labour, the women are occupied at home in spinning yarn for linnen, which is here made to great perfection. The people of Den∣mark are very subject to apoplexies and epilepsies, probably owing to hard drinking, and poor un∣wholsome diet; though they frequently die of a
<PB N="159" REF="1680"/>
species of apoplexy, called the <HI>slacht,</HI> which pro∣ceeds from grief and anxiety of mind. Consump∣tions, coughs, and catarrhs, are so little known at Copenhagen, that, even in the midst of winter, there is not the least noise in their churches to dis∣turb the attention of the audience. The exemp∣tion from these maladies, in such a cold moist cli∣mate, they probably owe to the purity of their fuel, which consists wholly of beech-wood, to their warm stoves, and to the comfortable furs they wear as preservatives against the severity of the winter. Strangers are but indifferently lodged in their towns. The taverns are poorly supplied; and he who diets in them must be contented to eat in a public room, which is often filled with promiscuous company, unless he will condescend to pay an ex∣travagant price for a separate apartment. The me∣tropolis is but indifferently furnished with game. The wild ducks and plover are hardly eatable; but the hares are good, and the markets sometimes pro∣duce tolerable roebuck. We have already observed that their sea-fish is not to be commended; but their rivers yield plenty of delicious carp, perch, and craw-fish. The gardens of the gentry are well stocked with melons, grapes, peaches, and all sorts of greens and sallads in perfection. Their butter is sweet; but their cheese intolerable.</P>
<P>People of fashion drink French wine, Rhenish, and cherry-brandy: the common people indulge themselves with bad beer, and a hot spirit distilled from barley.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The commerce of Denmark begins to lift up its head, under the protection and encouragement of a sovereign who is the real father of his people. The bloody and expensive wars by which the two northern crowns of Sweden and Denmark were
<PB N="160" REF="1690"/>
mutually exhausted, are now happily concluded; and will scarce be revived, while their sovereigns continue to pursue the real interest of their subjects. Russia has established a new power in the Baltic, in order to ballance which they will find it conve∣nient to unite for their own preservation. The trade of Denmark was formerly confined to a very inconsiderable export of fish, planks, timber, skins, tallow, and live cattle. Their money is reckoned in rixdollars and stivers; the first, not quite equal in value to an English crown; the last, rather more than an English penny. The lispound of Den∣mark is equivalent to a stone, and twenty of these are included in one ship-pound: but the Danish ell amounts to no more than two thirds of the English measure known by that denomination.</P>
<P>About the year 1612, an East-India company was established at Copenhagen, under the pro∣tection of king Christiern IV. and in four years after their establishment the company equipped four ships, which set sail for the East-Indies. These adventurers made a settlement on the coast of Co∣romandel, at a place called Tranquebar, which they still retain. Here they built a fort, which is counted the strongest in the Indies, and even for∣tified the town, which is a place of considerable traffick. A great number of Indians, whom the Danish missionaries have converted to the Lutheran religion, settle and grow rich in Tranquebar. These form a distinct colony, able to support itself in a flourishing condition, and to pay a yearly tribute of ten thousand rixdollars to the Danish company. During the civil wars in England, this commerce was carried on to great advantage: but, since that period, it has undergone various vicissitudes. From the very origin of their establishment the Danes have been embroiled with the neighbouring states of India, as well as with the other European set∣tlements.
<PB N="161" REF="1700"/>
These were envious of their strength, and their diamond-trade; a branch of traffick which they prosecuted to great advantage. In the close of the last century the Rajah of Tanjour, an Indian prince, whose territories bordered on Tran∣quebar, was instigated by the Dutch to declare war against the Danish settlement. He invested Tran∣quebar with a great army; and, by dint of incre∣dible labour, had in five months reduced the gar∣rison to extremity, when they were succoured by the generosity of Mr. Pit, the English governor of Fort St. George. This gentleman reinforced them with a body of English troops, who, in repeated sallies, harrassed the Indians to such a degree, that the Rajah, despairing of being able to reduce the place, raised the siege, and marched away. Since that period the Danes have enjoyed their East-India commerce without let or molestation: they possess Tranquebar, and the fortress of Danebourg, which is a regular citadel; together with an adjoining territory, peopled with Moors and Indians, who are their subjects.</P>
<P>In consequence of a scheme formed by Joshua Van Asperen, a merchant of the Low Countries, for increasing the capital and extending the trade of the Danish East-India company, Frederick IV. in the year 1728, transferred the seat of it from Copenhagen to Altena, a town of great traffick belonging to Denmark, and situated in the neigh∣bourhood of Hamburgh; and granted a new char∣ter to the company for promoting their commerce to China, Bengal, and the Indies. The capital was considerably enlarged, for these purposes, by a spirited subscription, which alarmed France and the Maritime Powers. The Dutch raised a process against the projector Van Asperen, who, being a subject of the States, was condemned and executed in effigy. Every objection that could be started
<PB N="162" REF="1710"/>
against the execution of the scheme, was published in the news-papers of Paris, London, and Amster∣dam, with a view to discourage people from en∣gaging in the commerce. The ministers of Great Britain and Holland, who resided at the court of Denmark, were ordered to make remonstrances to his Danish majesty against this new charter, which they apprehended would interfere with the East-India trade of their subjects. The king wisely an∣swered, that he was not restricted by any treaty whatever from supporting and extending the traf∣fick of his subjects by all the means in his power, provided he did not infringe the laws of nature and nations, which he had no intention to violate. The Maritime Powers, finding their representa∣tions produced no effect, forbade their subjects to be concerned in the Danish company; and this prohibition hindered them from executing the scheme in its utmost extent: nevertheless, they have extended their commerce, and now prosecute an advantageous trade from Copenhagen to China and the Indies, under the protection and particular encouragement of the reigning king. Their credit is extensive; their funds are considerable; their warehouses, magazines, yards, and docks, in com∣plete order; and they send annually two or three ships richly loaded to the East-Indies.</P>
<P>Christian VI. even in his father's life-time, was very attentive to the interest of the East-India company; and, indeed, when he ascended the throne, he fully answered the hopes and expecta∣tions of his people, in easing them of their severe burthens, and taking every step for their improve∣ment and advantage. He abolished a grievous monopoly, which his father had established, for the sale of wine, brandy, salt, and tobacco. He agreed to pay a million of rixdollars to the duke of Hol∣stein, upon that prince's resigning all pretensions
<PB N="163" REF="1720"/>
to the dutchy of Sleswick. He terminated an old dispute between the crown of Denmark and the city of Hamburgh; by which agreement he ob∣tained half a million of marks of silver for himself, and some valuable concessions in favour of his people. He instituted a council of trade, to examine all proposals for the extension and encouragement of commerce: he invited artists and workmen from foreign countries, and established manufactures at his own expence: he erected a bank for the pur∣pose of circulation: he maintained a respectable fleet and army; and, that these might not become burthen some to his subjects, he, from time to time, concluded treaties of subsidy with foreign powers, which always kept his finances in a flourishing con∣dition. In a word, he acted on all occasions with equal fortitude and discretion, as a great king, a wise politician, and a prince who had always at heart the interests of his people. His son Frede∣rick V. father to the present king of Denmark, wisely trod in the footsteps of his father. He maintained peace with all his neighbours, encou∣raged industry, promoted trade and manufactures: by means of a well regulated oeconomy, he was en∣abled to make considerable savings; so that he payed off a heavy debt due by the crown, and re∣served considerable sums to be expended for the good of his kingdom. Between the accession of his father to the throne, and that of his son, the present king, the face of affairs has been altered much for the better in Denmark. New channels of trade, and new ports, have been opened: the number of shipping has been doubled, and the revenue in∣creased in proportion. The court is splendid, with∣out profusion; the king is rich, without oppression; respected abroad as a wise and powerful monarch, beloved and adored at home as the father and pa∣tron of his people. Besides the East-India trade,
<PB N="164" REF="1730"/>
the Danes have extended their commerce to the West-Indies, where they have settled the islands of St. Thomas; to the coast of Guinea, where they maintain the fort of Christianburg; to the Mediterranean; and to Greenland.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>STRENGTH and REVENUE.</HEAD>
<P>The forces of Denmark, including five thousand reserves, which form a kind of militia, amount to near forty thousand men, horse, dragoons, and in∣fantry. These last, officers as well as soldiers, consist chiefly of strangers, Germans, Poles, Cour∣landers, Dutch, Swedes, Scots, and Irish. The cavalry are generally natives: every peasant is obliged to maintain a trooper and his horse, not only in meat, drink, and house-room, but likewise in money to the amount of six shillings a month; one half of which is payed to the colonel, to de∣fray the expence of mounting his men. In Nor∣way the foot-soldiers live upon free-quarter among the boors. The pay of a captain amounts to twenty rixdollars a month; that of a lieutenant to eleven: to each common soldier is allotted two rixdollars and thirty-two stivers; but of this he receives no more than seventeen stivers a week: the rest is de∣tained for bread, quarters, and cloaths. In time of peace the pay of the horse-officers is no more than that of the infantry. The dragoons are not obliged to keep horses, except in time of war; and extraordinary pay is allowed to those that are quar∣tered in Holstein. The Danish troops, though not despicable, have been generallyfoiled by the Swedes, who have wrested from them some of their best provinces, which they still possess; namely, Scho∣nen, Halland, Bleking, and Yempterland. The navy of Denmark is numerous and respectable: it consists of about thirty ships of the line, besides frigates, bombs, tenders, and yachts. That this
<PB N="165" REF="1740"/>
fleet may be the more easily manned on any emer∣gency, three thousand seamen are maintained a∣shore in time of peace; a certain district in the out-skirts of Copenhagen has been allotted to them for their habitation, and there they live rent free with their families in little houses, built like bar∣racks, at the king's expence. Their business, while on shore, is to work in the holm, or great dock, in which the ships of war are built and re∣paired. The pay of these mariners does not exceed eight rixdollars a year for each; but they have be∣sides a weekly allowance of provision. All the of∣ficers of the navy are constantly paid, in peace as well as in war. The Danes are tolerable naviga∣tors; but their best seamen are natives of Norway. There is a good number of fortresses in Denmark kept in repair. The fortifications of Copenhagen are strong and regular, though built of earth. The castle of Cronenburg, near Elsineur, is of considerable strength, though irregular. Altena, on the Elbe, is well fortified. Rendsburg, that stands on the river Eyder, is a royal fortification, deemed the strongest place in Denmark. Frede∣ricia, in Jutland, is a well fortified town, and a pass over the Little Belt; and there are several other strong holds of less consequence.</P>
<P>The revenues of his Danish majesty arise from the taxes and impositions laid on his own subjects, from the duties payed by foreigners, from his own estate, crown-lands, and confiscations. The taxes are altogether arbitrary, and therefore fluctuating; but they are always grievous to the subject. They commonly consist of customs or toll for import and export; of excise upon the consumption of wine, salt, tobacco, eatables, and drinkables; of taxes upon marriages, paper, brewing, grinding, and the exercise of different professions; of impositions on
<PB N="166" REF="1750"/>
land, poll-money, ground-rent for all houses in Copenhagen, and elsewhere; money raised for maintaining fortifications, and a portion for the king's daughter, when she happens to be married; but this seldom exceeds one hundred thousand rix∣dollars.</P>
<P>One considerable article in the revenue of Den∣mark is the toll payed by foreign ships that pass through the Sound, or Ore-Sound, into the Baltic. This is a narrow streight between Schonen and the island of Zealand. At its narrowest part, on the continent-side, the town of Elsineur and the for∣tress of Cronenburg are situated: on the side of Sweden is the town of Helsingburg; so that the Swedes command both sides of the passage, and are exempted from the toll which the ships of all other nations pay to the king of Denmark. This was originally no other than a small contribution, which trading nations agreed to make for main∣taining lights at certain places, to direct their course through the passage in dark and stormy wea∣ther. At the same time those trading nations agreed that every ship should pass this way, and pay its share of the expence, rather than use the Great Belt, which is the other passage, but unpro∣vided with such conveniency. In process of time the Danes converted this voluntary contribution into an exorbitant toll, and even exacted arbitrary sums, in proportion to the weakness of the nation whose ships they visited. These exactions some∣times involved the Danes in quarrels with their neighbours, and the toll was regulated in repeated treaties. The Swedes have freed themselves from this imposition, which is levied according to cer∣tain stipulated rates, in proportion to the size of the ship and the value of the cargo. The English and Dutch vouchsafe to pay it, and other states
<PB N="167" REF="1760"/>
trading to the Baltic make no scruple to follow their example. But the Danes know their title to this revenue stands upon a very precarious footing; for, as the Swedes command the passage, the others have no power to enforce payment; and should the Maritime Powers dispute their claim to this imposition, they would soon be obliged to give up the advantage, which has in some years a∣mounted to three hundred thousand rixdollars: at present however the rates are more reasonable, and the whole does not raise one third of that sum. In a word, the whole revenue of Denmark, com∣prehending Norway, Iceland, Oldenburg, and Delmenhorst, will not exceed three millions of rix∣dollars. Considering the splendour of the Danish court, the numerous army, fleet, and fortifications, which this monarch maintains, he would find this income insufficient to defray his expence, were not his finances managed with oeconomy. The French court, by its insidious arts and unwearied emis∣saries, formerly introduced their modes and cus∣toms, their language, and their policy, into Den∣mark. They soothed and flattered the Danish kings into extravagant notions of ambition and arbitrary power; seduced them into profusion by a glare of idle pomp and pageantry, and persuaded them to keep on foot such a standing army as they could not maintain with their own finances. By these means they necessarily became needy and de∣pendent; and the French, taking advantage of their necessity, were at hand with the temptation. They offered the subsidy, and the Dane had not power to resist, even when the conditions of the treaty were unfavourable to the interest of his kingdom. This, however, is no longer the case: the reigning king is altogether independent, and having, by marrying his Britannic majesty's sister,
<PB N="168" REF="1770"/>
entered into close connections with England, there can be no doubt but that the ballance of power in the North will be no longer affected by French influence.</P>
<P>The king of Denmark determines all the public affairs of his kingdom, with the advice of a privy∣council, composed of a few ministers. There are be∣sides four secretaries of state; one for the affairs of Denmark, one for Norway, a third for foreign affairs, and a fourth for the regulations and oeco∣nomy of war.</P>
<P>To the court of Copenhagen belong two orders of knighthood; namely, that of the Elephant, and that of Danebrug: the badge of the former, which they deem the most honourable, is an ele∣phant, surmounted with a castle, set in diamonds, and suspended to a sky-coloured watered ribbon, worn like the George in England. This order was instituted by Christian I. at his son's wedding, and is conferred only on persons of the highest quality and the most extraordinary merit: the number of the companions amounts to thirty, beside the sove∣reign. The order of Danebrug is much more antient, so that the origin of it is lost in fable: it is bestowed as an honorary reward upon the noblesse of an inferior rank, who have distin∣guished themselves in the service. Its insignia consist of a white ribbon with red edges, worn over the left shoulder, from which depends a small cross of diamonds, and an embroidered star on the breast of the coat, surrounded with the motto <HI>pietate &amp; justitia.</HI></P>
<P>The court of Denmark generally makes an annual progress to Sleswick and Holstein, as well as small ex∣cursions to different country palaces in the summer: of these the most remarkable is Fredericksburg, about twenty English miles from Copenhagen,
<PB N="169" REF="1780"/>
situated in the midst of a lake, over which are thrown several draw-bridges. To this belongs a fine park, well planted, and stocked with red deer; but the situation is cold, moist, uncomfortable, and unhealthy, and the apartments are very ill∣contrived: nevertheless, it is infinitely preferable to the other houses of the king, who is, upon the whole, worse lodged than any monarch in Eu∣rope.</P>
<P>While the king resides at this palace, the pastime of the court is stag - hunting; during which diversion his late majesty seemed to lay aside the trappings of royalty, and mingle as an equal with his noblemen and attendants. Even the do∣mesticks are indulged with very extraordinary free∣doms. About six in the evening the hunting∣assizes are held in the great court before the palace: there the stag is broken up with great ceremony by the huntsmen, cloathed in red, having great hunt∣ing-horns about their necks, while the hounds at∣tend with the most clamorous impatience. Pro∣clamation is made, that if any person has that day transgressed the laws of hunting, he should be im∣mediately accused. Some individual is always se∣lected for this purpose, tried and found guilty. Then he is led by two gentlemen towards the stag, where he first kneels down between the horns: he is afterwards obliged to raise up his posteriors, on which the king himself, with a long wand, used to inflict a certain number of stripes, to the in∣finite diversion of the queen, ladies, and other spectators; while the hounds opened, and the huntsmen blew their horns, to proclaim the king's justice. The criminal, having undergone this ludicrous chastisement, rose up, and made a pro∣found obeisance: then the hounds were permitted to regale upon the stag they had run down. Swan∣hunting
<PB N="170" REF="1790"/>
is another royal diversion, which the court enjoys in a small island near Copenhagen, where those birds breed in great numbers. Before the cygnets are sufficiently fledged to take their flight, the king, queen, courtiers, ladies, and foreign ministers, set out for this island in a great number of pinnaces, inclose the haunt of the swans, and with fowling-pieces destroy them by thousands. The feathers and down belong to the king: the flesh is never eaten.</P>
<P>On Shrove-Tuesday the same great personages appear in the habit of the boors in North-Hol∣land. The men wear great French hose, blue thrum caps, and short doublets: the ladies put on blue petticoats, and fantastic head-dresses. In this garb they embark in waggons for a country-village, called Amak, about three English miles from Copenhagen: there they dance to the sound of bagpipes and fiddles, and eat a country-dinner with wooden spoons out of earthen platters. Having passed the day in mirth, without any form or ceremony, they return in the same manner to Copenhagen, where they are treated with a come∣dy, and magnificent supper, by some person of the first quality, and spend the remainder of the night in the same rustic manner of dancing.</P>
<P>In the beginning of winter, when the snow is sufficiently frozen to bear a carriage, the king and court betake themselves to their sleds, drawn by horses gaily caparisoned, and furnished with a number of small bells, to give warning of their approach, that the way may be cleared. In these machines they make several tours round the city, attended with kettle-drums and trum∣pets.</P>
<P>The court has no sooner retired from this di∣version than the burghers renew it, and trot about
<PB N="171" REF="1800"/>
the streets all night long, wrapped up in fur-gowns, each accompanied by his female, whether wife or mistress. This, of all others, is the most favou∣rite diversion in Denmark.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>POLITICAL INTEREST.</HEAD>
<P>Denmark has not much to hope or to fear from the Empire. Sleswick is a good barrier to her dominions on the continent; and her islands can∣not be invaded without a maritime power. She has disputes with the house of Holstein about the possession of that dutchy; and as that house is now connected with Russia, it may be considered as a more formidable rival than it has hitherto been: but so long as the two northern crowns continue attached to their own interest, they will be able to ballance the power of that empire in the Baltic; or should they find themselves unequal to the task, they would be supported by England and the States General, which will never sit tamely and see the Russian power preponderate in the North. Besides, in that case, the Danes would be assisted by the king of Prussia, the elector of Hanover, and other princes who have territories in that part of Germany; princes, who, while they continue steady to their own interest, will never allow the Russians to obtain any footing in the Em∣pire.</P>
<P>The late king of Denmark observed a scrupulous neutrality in the quarrels that distracted Germany: in keeping aloof at that juncture, he acted as a sage politician. He received a subsidy from France, and his subjects enjoyed particular advantages in trade with that kingdom, as well as in a free commerce to other parts of the world, while that of the nations at war was necessarily interrupted.
<PB N="172" REF="1810"/>
He found himself courted by the belligerant powers as an ally, and he acted as a mediator be∣tween France and the electorate of Hanover.</P>
<P>With regard to Great Britain, the present king of Denmark, tho' young, seems to enter more than any of his predecessors ever did, into the pursuit of his true interest; and as his Britannic majesty dis∣covers no predilection for Hanover, it is more than probable that means may be found to destroy all vestiges of the dependence which Denmark former∣ly had upon France.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>JUTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>HAving treated of the Danes in general, with respect to their power, policy, commerce, character, and customs, we shall now specify the several members that compose the kingdom of Denmark. Its continental territories include Jut∣land, Sleswick, and Holstein: but this last being a fief held of the Empire, we shall refer it to our description of Germany. Jutland, or Jutia Sep∣tentrionalis, is bounded on the south by the dutchy of Sleswick; on the north and west it is washed by the German ocean: its boundaries on the east and north-east are the Lesser Belt, the Baltic, and the Categate. The country is divided into four dio∣ceses; namely, Ripen to the south, Arhusen to the east, Aalburg to the north, and Wibourg in the middle. Ripen contains thirty bailiwicks, two hundred and eighty-two parishes, ten royal palaces, and the seven following cities: Ripin, or Ripa, situated on the river Nipsaw, a place of consider∣able
<PB N="173" REF="1820"/>
trade, governed by two burgo-masters and a senate: here are two public schools, a college for divinity, and a public library: Colding, which stands on the banks of the river Aa, a small town, remarkable for nothing but its bridge; over which all the black cattle and horses, driven from Jutland to Sleswick, must pass, and pay a toll, which con∣stitutes a considerable article in the revenue of his Danish majesty: Frederick's-ode, seated on the banks of the Lesser Belt, or Middle-fort Sound, a place formerly well fortified; but now the works are in ruins, and indeed the town is of very little importance in any respect: Weille, a small, neat, well built city, standing on a little river about six miles to the north-west of Frederick's-ode: Warde, about two and twenty miles from Weille, conve∣niently situated for trade, on a river that falls into the German ocean: Kingcoping, at the distance of forty-five miles from Ripen, standing in a bay of the German ocean, and provided with a very safe harbour: Lemwick, in the gulph of Limford; and Hostlebro, an inland town, of little consequence.</P>
<P>The diocese of Arhusen comprehends thirty∣one bailiwicks, three hundred and four parishes, five castles, and eight fortified towns; of which Aarhus, or Aarhusen, is the capital, standing near the Categate, at the mouth of the river Gude, an agreeable place, with a commodious harbour, and well supplied with provision and ne∣cessaries. Six miles higher up the river is Scan∣derberg, a strong fortress. On the same river is situated the town of Randers, a place of some commerce, and famous for the best salmon in Jut∣land. Horsens is a small town, standing on the side of a little gulph that disembogues itself into the Baltic. Ebelstat stands in the bottom of a bay formed by the Categate. Mariager and Hobro are situated in another bay of the same Categate;
<PB N="174" REF="1830"/>
and the Grenstadt is built upon the cape of a penin∣sula, that likewise juts out into this opening.</P>
<P>The diocese of Wibourg, tho' inland, is not destitute of the conveniency of navigation: the land is intersected by large branching lakes, which, by means of the gulph of Limford, communi∣cate with the Baltic. This diocese contains six∣teen bailiwicks, two hundred and eighteen pa∣rishes, three garrisons, and three towns. The most considerable of these is Wibourg, a place of great resort, on account of its being a seat of ju∣dicature, to which appeals are made from inferior tribunals. It continues still to be the see of a bishop, though he and his chapter are of the Augsburgh confession. The town stands near a branch of Limford, is very antient, and was here∣tofore called Cimmersburg, as being the chief city of the Cimbri. The other towns of this province are Scheve and Nybe, inconsiderable places, that do not merit a particular description.</P>
<P>The diocese of Aalburg extends about seventy miles in length, from the south west to the far∣thest point of the Schager-riff in the north-east. It is surrounded by the sea on all sides but the south, where it is divided from Wibourg and Ripen by the gulph of Limford, running from the Baltic fifty miles a cross the country. This dis∣trict is naturally fertile, and the inhabitants carry on a considerable commerce. It comprehends thirteen bailiwicks, one hundred and seventy-seven parishes, and some towns of note. Aalburg stands on the gulph of Limford and is the see of a bishop. Wensuszel, formerly Burglaw, is situated on the river Ryaa. Schagen, seated on the cape to which it lends its name, though formerly called Cimbro∣rum Promontorium, is frequented by merchants from all parts of Europe, who touch at this place in their way to the Sound. Nikropingis, a consi∣derable
<PB N="275" REF="1840"/>
town, built on the isle of Mors, formed by the gulph of Limford. Tysted, standing in the middle of an isthmus, made by that gulph and the German ocean, is noted for nothing but a mean university, founded by Christiern III. king of Denmark. Seeby is a small sea-port town on the eastern shore. The most considerable islands belonging to Jutland, are Lessow and Samsoe, to∣lerably fertile, and pretty well peopled by hunters and fishermen.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SLESWICK.</HEAD>
<P>THE duchy of Selswick was once partly subjected to the duke of Holstein-Gottorp, from whose house the reigning family of Denmark is descended; but now the Dane possesses the whole. The length of Selswick amounts to about eighty-six miles, the breadth to threescore. It is bounded by Jutland, the Baltic, the dutchy of Holstein, and the German ocean. It is well watered by ri∣vers, which fertilize the soil, insomuch that it pro∣duces corn in great plenty. It is divided into the four circles of Hadersleben, Tonderen, Flensburg, and Gottorp. The nobility are rich, and the com∣mon people independent. The capital city, Sels∣wick, seated on a small arm of the sea, called the Sley, was formerly very considerable, opulent, and the see of a bishop. At present the trade is de∣cayed; yet the town is well supplied with necessa∣ries from the neighbouring country, which is re∣markably fruitful.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="1850"/>
At the distance of a few miles from this city, appear the ruins of the famous wall, or rampart, called Danewark; which the Danes, in antient times, built from sea to sea, as a bulwark against the incursions of the Saxons.</P>
<P>Gottorp, which likewise stands upon the Sley, is famous for the palace belonging to the dukes of Holstein. This edifice is built in the middle of a small lake, in form of an oblong square, fortified with four earthen bastions. The magnificence of the building, the long bridge thrown over the lake, the garden diversified and adorned with terrasses, walks, arbours, parterres, orangeries, nurseries, statues, summer-houses, fish-ponds, basons, water∣works and cascades, render it by far the most noble and delightful habitation in the northern part of Europe. In one of the summer-houses, we see a globe, constructed by the celebrated Tycho-Brahe, contrived to represent his planetary system. Here likewise is a copper-globe, ten feet and an half in diameter, with a sphere exhibiting the sun moving in the ecliptic, and all the heavenly bodies re∣volving by means of certain wheels, which are turned with water conveyed from the nighbour∣ing mountain. Adjoining to the garden is a fine park, or forest, laid out in pleasant walks and openings, and abounding with fallow deer, wild boars, and every species of the game.</P>
<P>The toll payed in this place for black cattle, passing from Jutland into Germany, produces a considerable yearly sum to the king of Denmark.</P>
<P>Eckrenford stands on a little gulph of the Baltic, and, being a very commodious haven, carries on a considerable trade.</P>
<P>Christianpries, capital of a bailiwick, is situated likewise on the Baltic, and well fortified.</P>
<P>Frederickstadt is built on the banks of the Ey∣der;
<PB N="177" REF="1860"/>
was originally peopled with Hollanders, and laid out in the Dutch manner.</P>
<P>Tonningen stands on the same river; ten miles below Frederickstadt, and about fourteen from the German ocean. It enjoys a considerable share of trade, in consequence of its convenient harbour.</P>
<P>Husum, on the gulph of Hover, at the distance of ten miles from Tonningen, was formerly rich and flourishing; but now the town is quite decayed, having suffered grievously by conflagration, war, and inundation.</P>
<P>Flensburgh, the capital of a district known by the same name, as well as by that of Angelen, or Engeland, the country of the Angles who invaded South-Britain, and bestowed upon it the appella∣tion of England. It is situated in the gulph of Flens, formed by the Baltic, about eight miles to the northward of Sleswick. The harbour is so commodious that ships of great burthen may come up, and be loaded from the warehouses.</P>
<P>Apenrade lies at the bottom of the bay, and is much frequented by the Danish fishermen.</P>
<P>Glucksburg is a small town, standing on the op∣posite side of the gulph, and commanded by a castle.</P>
<P>Hadersleben is a large sea-port town by the lake of Hadersleben, which runs into a narrow gulph that disembogues itself into the Baltic. The inha∣bitants maintain a tolerable trade, by means of the fish that are caught in great plenty, both in the lake and gulph.</P>
<P>Twelve miles to the westward of Hadersleben stands the little neat town of Tunder, on a fruitful soil, on the southern bank of the river Wydaw. Its trade is ruined, and its harbour choaked up with sand: nevertheless, the king maintains in good repair the small yet strong fort by which it is defended.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="1870"/>
Lohm-closter is an inconsiderable town, situated on the river Lohn-becke, about ten miles from the German ocean.</P>
<P>To Sleswick belong several islands, both in the Ocean and in the Baltic. Of the former the chief was Northstrand, opposite to the town of Husum, and said to have been separated from the continent by a violent storm. The length of it extended to twelve miles, and the breadth to four in some places. The soil was fruitful, both in pasture and corn. The number of inhabitants amounted to eight thousand, divided into one and twenty pa∣rishes. They bred a considerable number of black cattle, sheep, and poultry, and made great quan∣tities of butter: but the island has been ruined by repeated inundations. In the year 1300, several churches and villages, with a great number of people and cattle, were destroyed. In 1532, the whole island was overflowed, and nineteen hundred persons perished. In 1615, three hundred men, women, and children, were drowned. In 1634, the whole island was laid under water, and above six thousand persons lost their lives: fifty thousand head of cattle perished, and the dykes were broken in four and forty different places: of all the inha∣bitants fifteen hundred only were saved, with diffi∣culty. Since that period they have endeavoured to bank out the sea, and regain part of the ground that is overflowed.</P>
<P>Amron is a small island, in form like a crescent, noted for nothing but an oyster-fishery.</P>
<P>Fora is of an oval figure, about six miles in length, and four broad. It abounds with cattle and corn, and maintains above four thousand in∣habitants, who still preserve the language, man∣ners, and dress of the antient Frisons.</P>
<P>The island of Sylt, which lies to the north of Fora, stretches fourteen miles in length; but is
<PB N="179" REF="1880"/>
bare, barren, sandy, and inhabited by the same race of people who every year engage in the whale∣fishery on the coasts of Iceland, Greenland, and Spitzbergen. On the hills of this island they find earthen urns, filled with human bones and ashes: a proof that the antient Frisons burned their dead.</P>
<P>Rom is in length seven, and in breadth four miles; maintains about fifteen hundred inhabitants, dispersed in several villages. On the eastern coast are good pastures for cattle; and, on the west, har∣bours in which middling vessels may lie in safety.</P>
<P>Manoe was formerly considerable; but the greater part of it is now swallowed up by the sea.</P>
<P>On the coast of the Baltic are two islands, de∣pending on Sleswick; namely, Alsen and Arroe.</P>
<P>The first of these, which lies over-against the towns of Flensburg and Apenrade, extends four∣teen miles in length from north to south, and near twelve in breadth from east to west. It is fertile and populous, containing, besides several villages, two considerable towns, called Sunderburg and Northburg. These have given titles to two branches of the Holstein family. Sunderburg, which stands at the southern end of the island, where the duke of that name resided, is a hand∣some town, secured by a stately castle. The place is so strong as to have been able to sustain the at∣tack of an army under general Wrange, who met with such a warm reception, that he thought pro∣per to abandon the island. The duke of North∣burg resided at the town of that name, situated in the northern part, which was built in the twelfth century by king Sweno, surnamed Gratten-hode, or Great Head.</P>
<P>Arroe is a very small island, lying in the Lesser Belt, between Funen and the coast of Sleswick: there is another of the same name, that properly belongs to Denmark.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="1890"/>
The principal islands that compose this king∣dom it will be necessary to particularize.</P>
<P>Zealand, which is by far the most fertile and extensive island in the Baltic, is bounded on the east by the Sound, which divides it from Schonen; on the west by the Greater Belt, that separates it from Funen: the islands of Moon, Falster, and Laland, lie to the south; and on the north are the Categate and Schager-rack. It stretches sixty-eight miles in length from east to west, and its breadth may amount to sixty. The land is generally flat, and exceedingly fertile; and its woods and forests abound with game. The coast is indented by gulphs, bays, and inlets, affording commodious harbours, by means of which a considerable trade might be carried on by the natives: but they are, for the most part, dull, dispirited, and inactive. Zealand is divided into six and twenty bailiwicks, called herrits: these contain three hundred and forty-six parishes, and several considerable cities, of which Copenhagen is the capital. It lies very low, in a round form, which is chiefly owing to a circuit of fortifications; and contains about five and thirty thousand inhabitants. The houses were formerly of wood; but in the year 1728 the whole city was reduced to ashes, and since that time it has been rebuilt of brick and freestone. The late king expended considerable sums in raising a su∣perb palace; and the town is adorned with elegant houses belonging to the nobility, magnificent churches, and sumptuous public edifices. The harbour, which we reckon one of the best in the known world, is secured by the isle of Amack, that breaks off the waves, and shelters it from the surge of the sea. Here stand the arsenal, the mint, the exchange, and the castle, with about five hun∣dred houses, known by the name of the new town. It is separated from Zealand by a canal, over which
<PB N="181" REF="1900"/>
they have thrown several bridges, that afford an easy communication, without obstructing the pas∣sage of the ships in their ingress or egress. The entrance to the harbour is so narrow as to deny ad∣mittance to more than one ship at a time; and this passage is secured every night with a strong boom: the mouth of it is commanded by the citadel on one side, and a block-house on the other, well fur∣nished with artillery. Five hundred sail of ships may ride at ease in the harbour, secure alike from the weather and the enemy. Here the royal navy of Denmark may be seen, each ship riding in its proper berth or station; and, round the whole in∣closure, a wooden gallery projects over the water. The external road affords good anchorage, being fenced from the sea by a large sand-bank, the shal∣lows of which are distinguished by two floating buoys.</P>
<P>The island of Amack, or Amagar, lies east from the city, on the other side of the harbour, about six miles in length, and of an oval form. It was chiefly planted by Hollanders, sent thither by Margaret dutchess of Savoy, while she acted as governess of the Low Countries. Christern II. espoused her niece, who was sister to the emperor Charles V. and that this lady might have plenty of pulse and kitchen-herbs, which were but little known in Denmark, her aunt supplied her with a little colony of Hollan∣ders, to whom half the island was granted, and distinguished by the name of Hollandsby. Their posterity still retain the language and the customs of the Dutch. They supply Copenhagen with milk, cheese, and butter: they are an industrious set of people, and their houses are neat and com∣modious. Besides pulse and wheat, this island produces barley, oats, and hares in abundance.</P>
<P>The town of Helsineur is situated about twenty miles north of Copenhagen, surrounded with walls,

<PB N="181" REF="1920"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="182" REF="1930"/>
and particularly defended by the strong fortress of Cronenburg, which commands one side of the Sound. This castle, which is now fallen to decay, was formerly very strong, spacious, and magnifi∣cent, built by Frederick II. at his own expence; that is, from his own private revenue, without the assistance of his subjects.</P>
<P>Opposite to Helsineur appears the island of Huen, rising like a hill in the middle of the sea, and commanding a prospect over all the neigh∣bouring country. It was upon this island that the famous Tycho Brahe built the castle of Uraniburg, and his observatory. Frederick II. bestowed upon him the island for life, as a commodious spot for this purpose, the air being generally free from fogs, and the sky perfectly serene. Uraniburg was finished in four years, so as to be deemed the most curious edifice in the world. He afterwards built another house on the southern part of the island, and conferred upon it the appellation of Stelburg. Both these structures were compleatly provided with all the instruments and apparatus necessary in the different researches of astronomy, chymistry, and natural philosophy; and he was en∣abled to defray the expence by a pension of two thousand golden crowns, a considerable fief in Nor∣way, and a prebend in the church of Roschild. Uraniburg is now decayed, and the island belongs to the Swedes.</P>
<P>About twenty miles to the north-west of Copen∣hagen stands Fredericksburg, a town remarkable for nothing but the castle, and royal palace in its neighbourhood, accounted the Versailles of Den∣mark. The house is founded upon piles in a lake, according to the preposterous taste of this country. The palace is magnificent, the chapel well deco∣rated, the hall of audience adorned with paintings, statues, and rich tapestry. Behind the castle is a
<PB N="183" REF="1940"/>
flower-garden, raised from a terrass, founded on piles in the lake at a vast expence: the park ex∣tends about nine miles in length; is interspersed with lawn, vale, and hillock, pools and fish-ponds, and stocked with fallow deer from England.</P>
<P>Roschild, which was formerly the capital, stands at the bottom of the bay of Isefiord, about eigh∣teen miles to the westward of Copenhagen. Since the kings of Denmark have removed their resi∣dence from this place, it has dwindled greatly in wealth, commerce, and importance. Of twenty∣seven churches that formerly adorned this town, two only are now standing: it continues, however, to be the burying-place of the royal family. Among the tombs of the Danish kings, some of which are very magnificent, stands a fair marble pillar, erected by queen Margaret, as a support to the whetstone sent to her by Albert king of Swe∣den to sharpen her needles, in derision of her sex. He suffered severely for this sarcasm: he was taken prisoner by the queen, detained seven years in cus∣tody, and obliged to relinquish all his pretensions to the crown of Sweden. Here is a convent of Lutheran nuns, belonging to the best families: they wear no particular habit, are restricted by no vows, and, when a good match offers, may leave the cloister and marry. The college of the univer∣sity is by no means in a flourishing condition, and the whole town exhibits evident marks of poverty and decay. It was here that, in the year 1658, the famous treaty of peace was concluded between Denmark and Sweden.</P>
<P>Holbeck is a pretty considerable town, seated at the bottom of a narrow bay, which communicates with that of Isefiord, about fourteen miles to the westward of Roschild.</P>
<P>Callenburg stands at the bottom of a gulph, which opens into the Great Belt, two and fifty miles
<PB N="184" REF="1950"/>
to the westward of Copenhagen. The gulph in this place forms a safe and commodious harbour, from which circumstance the town derives a to∣lerable share of commerce.</P>
<P>Sora, built on the banks of a small lake in the middle of Zealand, was formerly the seat of a rich abbey, surrounded with pleasant fields and forests. Absalom, archbishop of Lunden, founded here an establishment for the maintenance of those who should write the history of Denmark; and to this foundation we owe the history of Saxo-Grammati∣cus. Hither Frederick removed his academy from Fredericksburg, and the foundations of the uni∣versity were augmented by his son Christiern IV. The celebrated Meursius was professor of history and politics in the college of Sora, where he died, and lies buried. Charles-Gustavus king of Swe∣den was here educated, and retained such venera∣tion for the place, that when he invaded Zealand he would not suffer his soldiers to enter the town. The revenues of this academy have since been an∣nexed to the crown of Denmark, and the place is almost wholly unknown.</P>
<P>Ringstede, situated about thirty miles to the south-west of Copenhagen, is a place of great anti∣quity, in which some of the Danish kings are buried; but the houses are mean, and the town is quite destitute of trade.</P>
<P>Koge, standing in a bay of the Sound, eleven miles to the southward of Copenhagen, is small, but populous and rich, in consequence of a flou∣rishing trade in fish and corn.</P>
<P>Presto is a town of some trade, situated in a bay of the Baltic, opposite to the island of Moon.</P>
<P>Warienburg, in the same neighbourhood, is a sea-port town with some commerce.</P>
<P>Newsted is a paultry town, situated on a little river that falls into the Baltic, over-against Laland.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="1960"/>
Skelskor is a place of the same unimportance, standing on the coast of the Greater Belt in the western part of Zealand.</P>
<P>Korsor, seated on a neck of land about fifty∣six miles to the south-west of Copenhagen, and separated from Funen by the Greater Belt, is meanly fortisied, and carries on very little trade, though provided with a fine deep bason, in which ships may ride with great safety. Charles-Gustavus disembarked his army at this place, when he made his descent upon Zealand.</P>
<P>The second island of Denmark, in point of ex∣tent and importance, is Funen; spreading nearly thirty miles square, bounded by the Greater Belt on the east, by the Lesser Belt on the west, by the Baltic on the south, and having the island of Sam∣soe on the north. The face of the country is agree∣ably diversified with small verdant hills, some of which are covered with woods. This island is bet∣ter peopled than Zealand; the soil is rich, and well cultivated, affording a large quantity of corn for export, as well as great herds of black cattle, a good breed of horses, and hogs in great abundance. Funen is the appenage of his Danish majesty's eld∣est son, and the government of it is one of the most considerable of the whole kingdom. It con∣tains four garrison-towns, and two hundred and sixty-four villages. The most considerable places are Odensee, Nyburg, Schwenborg, Woburg, As∣sens, and Middlefar.</P>
<P>Odensee, the capital, stands in the middle of the island, a large, well-built, agreeable town, where the kings formerly resided, and the estates of the kingdom assembled, before the crown be∣came hereditary, and the sovereign absolute. In one of the churches, dedicated to St. Canute, the body of that prince, about one hundred and twenty years ago, was found in a copper-coffin, gilt and
<PB N="186" REF="1970"/>
adorned with precious stones. The beer brewed in this place is reckoned the best in all Denmark.</P>
<P>Nyburg lies on the Great Belt, where the pas∣sage is narrowest, between Funen and Zealand. It stands in a fertile country, and has a good harbour, which is productive of some trade. It was former∣ly well fortified; but the breaches made in the late war with Sweden are not yet repaired. At this place people embark for Zealand. The town was rendered famous by a great and decisive victory obtained in the year 1659, by the troops of the Emperor, the elector of Brandenburg, the king of Poland, and the States General, over the Swedes, who had taken possession of the whole island.</P>
<P>Schwinborg, which stands on the south-east part of the island, is an agreeable town, with a large and commodious harbour. Here it was that Charles Gustavus, in the year 1658, began his march over the ice to the islands of Langeland, Falster, and Zealand.</P>
<P>About ten miles to the west of this place stands the little town of Woburg, situated in a small gulph on the southern coast of Funen.</P>
<P>Assens appears about eleven miles to the south∣ward of Odensee, a small town, where the troops of Christiern III. in the year 1535, routed the army of Christopher earl of Oldenburg, and slew Gusta∣vus Troll, archbishop of Upsal. General Rantzaw, having obtained this victory, levelled the town with the ground.</P>
<P>Seventeen miles to the north-west of Assens, Middlefar, a small neat town, stands upon the coast of the Lesser Belt, which is not broader in this place than is the Thames at Gravesend. Charles Gustavus with his army marched over the ice to this place, where he defeated the Danish forces, and made himself master of Funen.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="1980"/>
The less considerable islands of Denmark are Arroe, Langeland, Laland, Falster, Moon, Feme∣ren, Bornholm, and several small isles on the coast of Jutland and Zealand, which are not of impor∣tance enough to merit a particular description.</P>
<P>Arroe, situate on the southern coast of Funen, about eight miles long, and two in breadth, pro∣duces plentiful crops of corn, a great number of black cattle and horses, some hares, and abundance of anise-seed, which the inhabitants use for season∣ing: it comprehends three parishes, and a tolerable town called Koping, of some traffick, on account of its harbour.</P>
<P>Langeland lies in the Great Belt, to the south∣east of Funen, stretching two and twenty miles in length, though not above eight miles broad. It abounds with wheat, rye, and barley, of which the natives export great quantities: it is divided into sixteen parishes; and the most considerable town is Rutcoping, on the western coast, opposite to Schwinborg in Funen. It is defended by the fort of Traneker, in which the king of Denmark maintains a strong garrison. Langeland is sur∣rounded by some smaller isles; such as Omme, Agger, and Echolm.</P>
<P>Laland lies to the eastward of Langeland, and to the southward of Zealand, from which it is se∣parated by a narrow streight, called Gronesond: from its lowness and flatness it takes the name of Laland, extending about thirty-eight miles in length, and twenty at its greatest breadth. The soil is so fertile, that it supplies Copenhagen with wheat, and great quantities are yearly exported by the Dutch traders. It is the seat of a principal government, or stifts-ampt, and several other isles are subject to its jurisdiction. It is divided into five districts, or bailiwicks. The island is adorned with many villages, and seats belonging to the noblesse,
<PB N="188" REF="1990"/>
exclusive of four considerable towns; namely, Naschow, Saxcoping, Levenscoping, and Nysted, once famous for a noble monastery.</P>
<P>Falster, lying to the north-east of Laland, from which it is divided by a narrow channel, is a fruit∣ful island, twenty miles long, and eight in breadth, divided into two bailiwicks, and comprehending several towns. The capital, Nycoping, situated on the western coast of the island, is one of the most agreeable towns in Denmark, provided with a strong castle, and commodious harbour, well fre∣quented.</P>
<P>The island of Moon, lying to the north-east of Falster, is nearly of the same magnitude; but more hilly, and less fertile: yet it abounds with good pasture. Here are several villages, and a consi∣derable town, called Stege, in the northern part of the island, situate on a little rivulet, which falls into the Gronesond. The inhabitants have, on divers occasions, signalized their valour against the Lubeckers and the Swedes.</P>
<P>Femeren lies near the coast of Wagria in Hol∣stein, from which it is separated by a streight about two miles broad, known by the name of <HI>Der Fem∣mer Sundt.</HI> This, though a very small island, is a spot of great importance, as being, with regard to the Empire, one of the keys of Denmark: for which reason the fortifications are kept in repair, and strong garrisons maintained in every place that is defensible. The island is fruitful in corn and pasture: it contains but two parishes; and at the landing-place from Holstein there is a strong fort, called Ferhschans, or the Fort of the Passage.</P>
<P>Bornholm, the most easterly of all the islands belonging to Denmark, lies at the distance of seventy-four miles from Zealand, and about fifteen from the coast of Schonen. Its length amounts to eighteen miles, and its breadth to ten. The
<PB N="189" REF="2000"/>
most considerable towns in this fruitful and impor∣tant island are Sandwyck, Rattenby or Rottum, Nex, and Sandhamer; besides which it contains divers populous villages.</P>

<HEAD>LAPLAND.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ITS SITUATION, EXTENT, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we may leave nothing behind us, we shall now proceed to the description of Lapland; the whole of which, extending from the North Cape in 71 degr. 30″'; of northern latitude to the White Sea, under the Artic Circle, is inhabited by the same people, though different parts of the country are subject to different powers. Norwe∣gian Lapland, under the dominion of the Dane, included in the government of Wardhus, which we have already described, lies between the northern sea, the river Pais, and the lake Enarak. Swedish Lapland, comprehending all the country from the Baltic to the mountains that separate Norway from Sweden, is divided into six districts, denominated Marck, or Territory; and these are distinguished by the names of rivers, such as Aungner-man∣land, Uma, Peta, Lula, Torna, and Kiemi. The eastern part, subject to the czar of Muscovy, situated between the lake Enarak and the White Sea, is divided into three distinct prefectures; namely, that of the sea-coast, towards the north, called Mourmankoi Leporie, in which is the port of Kola, well known to the European navigators; the Terskoi Leporie, upon the coast of the White
<PB N="190" REF="2010"/>
Sea; and the third or inland, known by the name of Bellamoreskoi Leporie. In Swedish Lapland, which is the most considerable of the three, the provinces or marcks are subdivided into smaller dis∣tricts, called Biars, consisting each of a certain number of families; among which the land is par∣celled out by the government, or prefect of the district, appointed by the king of Sweden. This dismal country is but thinly inhabited by a wretched people, said to have been originally natives of Fin∣land, from whence they were driven into these de∣sarts. Hence they derived the name of Lappes, which, in the Finland language, signifies exiles; but this appellation they reject as a reproach, and call themselves <HI>Sabmienlanti.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>Lapland may be termed a huge congeries of frightful rocks and stupendous mountains; among which the winter seems to rage with redoubled and unceasing fury, in frost and snow, and storm and whirlwind: yet interspersed among these dreadful mountains are many pleasant vallies, watered by an infinite number of rivulets, that run into the rivers and lakes, which discharge themselves into the gulph of Bothnia. The principal rivers we have already named: the particular lakes shall be men∣tioned in the description of the several districts. Suffice it to say, that the chief among them are these, the Great Uma, the Great Windel, the Orea∣van, the Stor-awan, the Great Lula; the lakes of Kartom, Kali, Torno, Enara, and Kimi. Some of these extend sixty leagues in length, and con∣tain a great number of islands: three hundred and sixty-five are said to be contained in the lake Stor∣awan; and Enara forms an archipelago of islands so large, that no Laplander has lived long enough
<PB N="191" REF="2020"/>
to visit each particular island. The natives believe this country to be the terrestrial paradise; and in∣deed nothing could be more inchanting than such vast and agreeable prospects of mountains, hills, forests, lakes, rivers, and rivulets, if the country was situated in a moderate climate: yet even here, in summer, the roses are seen blowing wild on the banks of the lakes and rivers, with all the vermi∣lion glow that appears in those which are cultivated in our gardens. But all the intervals between the mountains are not engrossed by these agreeable rivulets, rivers, lakes, and vallies: great part of the flat country is covered with brown dusky forests of fur and pine-tree; and these are often skirted by wide extended morasses, the stagnating water of which putrefies in the summer, and produces myriads of mischievous insects, that are much more intolerable than the cold of winter.</P>
<P>In winter the lips are often frozen to the cup, when a man attempts to drink; and even brandy can scarce be preserved in a state of fluidity. The mercury in Reaumur's thermometer sinks to 37 degrees below the freezing point; though in the most intense frost, ever known in Paris, it did not descend above fourteen. The spirit of wine in other thermometers is converted into ice. The very breath freezes in expiration; and the limbs of people are very often mortified, and perish. All the lakes and rivers are frozen to a prodigious thickness; and the whole face of the country is covered with snow to the depth of four or five feet: while this continues loose, it is impossible to travel; for a man's eyes are not only blinded with it, but, if a strong wind should rise, he will be buried in the drifts of snow: yet, should a partial thaw take place for a few hours, the surface of this snow is formed by the succeeding frost into a hard impe∣netrable crust, over which the Laplander travels in
<PB N="192" REF="2030"/>
his sledge with amazing rapidity. While the thaw prevails the air is surcharged with vapours, and the climate is rainy; but while the north wind blows the sky is beautifully serene, and exhibits the most gorgeous appearance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE. WATER.</HEAD>
<P>This being the most northern country on the continent of Europe, the cold must be extreme in the winter; but the rigour of the winter is not more severe than the heats of summer are excessive. At the northern extremity, the sun in summer never sets for three months; and in winter there is an uninterrupted night of the same duration: but this is qualified in such a manner, by a constant re∣volution of dawn and twilight, by a serene sky, moon-light, and <HI>aurora borealis,</HI> reflected from the white surface of the earth covered with snow, that the inhabitants are enabled to hunt, fish, and pro∣ceed with their ordinary occupations. The coun∣try abounds with excellent springs, and is remark∣able for some surprising cataracts, in which the water rumbles over frightful precipices, and dashes among rocks with amazing impetuosity and tre∣mendous noise.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, and VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<P>The soil of Lapland is generally so chilled and barren, that it produces little or no sort of grain, nor fruit-trees of any kind: this sterility, however, is not so much owing to the soil, which is in many places of a rich mould, as to want of industry; for, in some districts, the Swedes have tilled and manured pieces of ground, that bear plentiful crops of rye. There is also great plenty of ber∣ries, such as black currants, what is called the Nor∣wegian mulberry, growing upon a creeping plant,
<PB N="193" REF="2040"/>
and much esteemed as an antiscorbutick; rasp∣berries, cranberries, juniperberries, and bilberries. The juniper-tree rises to a great height in this country. The tops of the mountains are so much exposed to intense cold, and tempests of snow and hail, that no tree will grow near the summit: but in parts that are more sheltered, we see fine woods of birch, pine, and fur, disposed by nature as if they had been planted by art in rows at regular distances, without any under-growth or incum∣brance below. Besides these trees, some parts of Lapland produce the service-tree, the willow, the poplar, the elder, and the corneil. Among the plants of this country the principal is the angelica, greatly esteemed by the natives, who use it in their food. Here is likewise the acetosa, or sorrel, in great plenty, and much used by the Laplanders. They have also other herbs peculiar to themselves, different kinds of grass, heath, and fern: these are all enumerated in a work of the celebrated Linnaeus, intituled <HI>Flora Laponica.</HI> But the ve∣getable which is in the greatest plenty, and most extensive use among them, is the moschus, or moss; of which species there are many different genera, either adhering to trees, or growing on the surface of the earth. The rein-deer is almost wholly sustained by this vegetable, which indeed he prefers to all others, and without which he can∣not subsist. The Laplanders not only use it as forage to their cattle, but boil it in broth, as a cordial and restorative. They likewise use one sort of it as a soft, easy, and wholsome bed to their new-born children.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>METALS and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>Some silver and lead mines have been disco∣vered in the provinces of Pitha and Lula; and two of copper, together with excellent veins of
<PB N="194" REF="2050"/>
iron, in the district of Torna: but they are not at present worked to any considerable advantage. At Sltangliware, in the march or district of Torno, there is a vein of gold and silver mixed; another of lead and silver at Keckscasware, in the same di∣vision; a third of copper at Swappaware, in this district also. They have raised another copper∣work at Wordnacka, in the province of Lula: they dig for iron at Gelliware in this district, and at Jo∣nusvando in Torno, where there is a foundery. The silver found in the mines of Nasafraell, in Pita, is smelted in the foundery of Silbojock; and that which they dig at Kendkeware, in the district of Lula, is refined in the furnaces at Queckjock. But these mines are worked only for a few months in the summer, because the frost hinders the en∣gines from playing.</P>
<P>Here are found beautiful chrystals, of a sur∣prising magnitude, so hard and fine, that, when polished, they resemble real diamonds. One, as large as a child's head, was in the possession of the count Gabriel de la Gardre, at one time chancellor of Sweden. Lapland also affords amethysts and topazes, but pale and cloudy; and a great quan∣tity of very curious stones, which are too hard to be worked by the tool of the mason. Some of these, found on the banks of rivers and lakes, when they happen to bear the least resemblance to the figures of animals, the Laplanders remove to more conspicuous places, and adore as deities. The province of Torno affords some curious mi∣neral stones, of an octagonal shape, regular, shin∣ing, and polished by the hand of Nature. In some rivers they fish for pearls, which are generally pale; but some of them are as bright as the oriental pearls, and much larger and rounder. Scheffer tells us, that a lapidary sold one of these to a lady of Stockholm for one hundred and twenty crowns;
<PB N="195" REF="2060"/>
and protested, that if he had possessed another to match it, he would not have parted with the two for less than five hundred. The Lapland pearls are found in muscle-shells, and the fishery is not in the sea, but in rivers.</P>

<HEAD>ANIMALS, QUADRUPEDS, BIRDS, FISHES, and INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>Lapland, in common with Norway, is infested by a great number of grey wolves and bears, with which the inhabitants are at perpetual war. The most honourable exploit among the Laplanders is that of killing a bear, and the heroes adorn their caps with a small plate of lead or pewter for every bear they have slain. The country abounds with elks, beavers, and otters, which live here unmo∣lested, and find plenty of fish for their subsistence. Among other beasts it likewise produces the glut∣ton, which we have described in our account of Norway. The black foxes of Lapland are in such estimation for their furs, that one skin will sell for twelve golden crowns at Moscow. The forests of Lapland furnish haunts to a great number of beau∣tiful martens and squirrels; which last change their colour every winter, from brown to grey. These animals frequently migrate in troops innumerable. When they arrive at the side of a lake, they em∣bark upon pieces of bark or timber, which they find afloat, and are generally drowned in their pas∣sage: the bodies, instead of sinking, are cast ashore, and the skin becomes a prize to the first finder. What should induce these animals to quit the country, and undertake such a hazardous voyage, has not yet been discovered.</P>
<P>Lapland is also the native country of the zibel∣ing, a creature resembling the marten, whose skin, whether black or white, if glossy, is extremely valuable, and often given in presents by the am∣bassadors
<PB N="196" REF="2070"/>
of Muscovy to the princes at whose courts they reside. Here are likewise ermins, weazels, hares, which are said to grow white in the winter; large black cats, which attend the Laplanders in hunting, and little prick-eared curs, trained to the game. But the most remarkable animal of Lap∣land is the rein-deer, which we have already de∣scribed in the article of Norway: he is larger and stronger than a stag, and naturally wild; but the Laplanders find means to tame and convert him into a beast of burthen.</P>
<P>The woods, mountains, and rivers, are well stocked with wild fowl; such as bustard, partridge, growse, heathcock, pheasants, lapwings, swans, wild geese, wild ducks, including the lumme, or northern diver, and all sorts of aquatic birds that build and breed in northern climates. In the be∣ginning of the spring the swans go thither in numerous flights from the German ocean: the lapwings follow in such swarms, that they darken the day as they pass along, and scream so loud, that they may be heard at a league's distance. The rocks and mountains are likewise frequented by eagles, hawks, faulcons, kites, and other birds of prey.</P>
<P>The rivers and lakes of Lapland abound with delicious salmon from the gulph of Bothnia, trout, bream, and perch, of exquisite flavour and amazing magnitude. The Laplanders of Wardhus are well supplied with sea-fish from the northern ocean.</P>
<P>With respect to insects, the slies hatched in the morasses and woods in summer are so numerous, that they often obscure the face of day; so venom∣ous, troublesome, and intolerable, that the rein∣deer fly to the tops of the highest mountains for shelter; and the Laplanders betake themselves to the sea-side, which is the least infested by these pestilent vermin. The celebrated M. de Mauper∣tuis, in his account of the voyage he made to Lap∣land,
<PB N="197" REF="2080"/>
in company with the other mathematicians, sent thither by the French king to measure a de∣gree of the meridian, gives us to understand, that on the tops of the mountains in Torno the flies were so troublesome, that even the Finland sol∣diers, who are counted the most hardy troops in the service of Sweden, were obliged to cover their faces with the skirts of their coats, from the attacks of these animals; which swarmed to such a degree, that the moment a piece of flesh appeared it was blackened all over. Some of these flies are very large, with green heads, and fetch blood from the skin whenever they strike. The Laplanders shroud themselves in the impenetrable smoke of a large fire, kindled for that purpose: yet even this dis∣agreeable expedient was not sufficient to defend the French philosophers: they were obliged, notwith∣standing the excessive heat, to wrap up their heads in garments made of the skins of rein-deer, called in that country <HI>lapmudes,</HI> and to cover themselves with a thick rampart of fir-boughs: yet all these precautions proved ineffectual. M. de Mauper∣tuis observed a large lake quite covered with little yellowish grains, resembling millet-seed, which he supposed to be the chrysalises of some of these insects.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their LANGUAGE, RELIGION LAWS, and GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We have already observed that the Laplanders were expelled from Finland; but whence their language is derived, we cannot so easily determine. Scheffer is of opinion, that it is the same with that spoken by the Finlanders, and gives a catalogue of words that have the same signification among both these nations: but this argument is altogether in∣conclusive, inasmuch as the same analogy might be found among all the languages of Europe and
<PB N="198" REF="2090"/>
Asia. Besides, it is not at all likely that the Lap∣landers should use the same language that was spoken by their conquerors, who came from an∣other country. Be that circumstance as it may, certain it is the Laplanders speak a very barbarous tongue, which varies in different parts of the coun∣try, according to the correspondence which the natives maintain with different nations; such as the Norwegians, Swedes, Finlanders, and Muscovites. They are, generally speaking, totally ignorant of letters; and, we may say, of arts, except such as necessity has taught them for their own preser∣vation.</P>
<P>In the last century the people of Lapland were converted to christianity, by missionaries from Nor∣way, Sweden, and Muscovy. Several churches were built in different parts of the country, and supplied with ministers chiefly from Sweden. A public school was instituted in the town of Pitha, to instruct the children of the Laplanders in the christian religion, and in letters; and the masters translated some Swedish books into the language of this country; such as the Catechism, with some prayers, and the Manual, containing the psalms of David, the Evangelists, the proverbs of Solomon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The king of Sweden founded another col∣lege of this same kind at Liksala, in the province of Uma: but, notwithstanding all these endea∣vours, the majority of the Laplanders adhere to their ancient idolatry: even those who profess the christian religion, have blended it strangely with their old heathenish rites, and still retain all their former superstition. They are great observers of times, seasons, and omens; and distinguish a great number of days into black and white, that is, lucky or unfortunate. The day after Christ∣mas, the festivals of St. Catherine, St. Clement, and St. Mark, they deem unlucky. The worship
<PB N="199" REF="2100"/>
of the true God they have mingled with the rites of adoration offered to imaginary deities. They believe in a good and evil principle, which they suppose to be at continual variance; and which, according to the prevalence of either, are produc∣tive of happiness or misery to mankind. They likewise adore the gods Thor, Storjunkare, and Bacwe, which last is the sun; and these they wor∣ship in the figures of stones, trunks, and fire. They likewise pay great reverence to the manes, or spirits of their departed friends; and dread them extremely, in the belief that they delight in mis∣chief, until they reanimate other bodies. Thus they maintain the doctrine of the metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls. They likewise pay their offerings and supplications to certain daemons, supposed to frequent the mountains and lakes, as well as to other genii, called Juhles, that inhabit the air, and are thought to have the power to do either good or evil, especially at the time of the Christmas-holidays: of these the Laplander has neither image nor statue; but offers sacrifice to them at the root of some tree. They fast on Christmas-eve, which they call the feast of Juhles. They set apart a portion of their victuals next day, when they have extraordinary chear, in order to be offered as a sacrifice. Two days after the festival they put this portion into a small vessel, made of birch-bark in the form of a ship, with sails and oars. This they carry to a tree near the hut, and, after some superstitious ceremonies, hang up on a bough, for the use of the Juhles that traverse the air, the forests, and the mountains. Sacrifices of the same nature they offer to the manes, or dead, which they distinguish by the appellation of <HI>Sittes.</HI> They have implicit faith in magic and divination, and pretend to prognosticate events by means of
<PB N="200" REF="2110"/>
figures drawn upon drums <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The drum is made of the hollowed trunk of a fir, pine, or birch-tree, one end of which is covered with a skin: on this they draw, with a kind of red colour, the figures of their own gods, as well as of Jesus Christ, the apostles, the sun, moon, stars, birds, bears, and rivers. On these they place one or two brass rings, which, when the drum is beaten with a little hammer, dance over the fi∣gures, and according to their progress the sorcerer prognos∣ticates.</NOTE>, made for that pur∣pose: nay, those that live upon the Ocean, and the banks of the White Sea, are bold enough to drive a traffick in winds, with such ship-masters as are so credulous to go to market for this commodity. When a ship is wind-bound at Wardhus, or Kiemi, and the pilot has faith in these incantations, he ad∣dresses himself to a Lapland wizard; who, for a reasonable consideration, presents him with a magic cord, on which are a certain number of knots, to be untied occasionally, as the wind may happen to fail about certain capes, or promontories. This imposition, however, is too gross to be swallowed by any person whose faculties are not wholly ob∣scured with ignorance and superstition. The pre∣tended diviner used to chaffer and dispute about the price, until he perceived certain signs in the atmosphere, which always foretold an alteration of weather: then he made haste to conclude his bar∣gain, and dismissed the captain with his knotted talisman, leaving the completion of his prophecy to accident.</P>
<P>Lapland is so far from being populous, that the whole nation is not equal in number to one petty province in France. The Laplanders are very low in stature <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Generally about a head shorter than other Europeans. They are likewise remarkable for having large heads. M. de Maupertuis measured a female Laplander, who suckled her own child; and found her sta∣ture did not exceed four feet two inches and five lines.</NOTE>, ill-shaped, and ugly; yet strong, hardy,
<PB N="201" REF="2120"/>
and robust, insomuch that they will bear incredible fatigue; and it is remarked that the stoutest Nor∣wegian is not able to bend the bow of a Laplander. The women, however, are much less homely than the men, and many of them are noted for a deli∣cate and florid complexion. In all probability they are stunted in their growth by the extreme cold, and the wretched nourishment on which they subsist.</P>
<P>But, before we proceed to describe their manners and customs, it will be proper to take some notice of the nature of their government. The Laplanders are governed, in different parts, by prefects or governors, sent from the three powers to which they are subject. In Swedish Lap∣land, which is the most considerable, the laws of that kingdom are observed. There is a tribunal, or court of justice, established for Angermand-Lapmark; a second for Uma, Pitha, and Lula-Lapmark; and a third for Torno, and Kiemi-Lapmark. In each of these a prefect presides, and the priest is his assessor. These judges, how∣ever, have seldom an opportunity to exert their judicial power; for theft, robbery, murder, and adultery, are crimes almost utterly unknown among those people, who are equally ignorant of letters and of vice. They seldom transgress the law, ex∣cept in the practice of sorcery, which is prohibited on pain of death; yet, notwithstanding this pro∣hibition, the art of divination by the drum is exer∣cised in secret, both by men and women.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHARACTER, MANNERS, and CUSTOMS of the LAPLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>These people are simple, honest, hospitable, and ti∣morous: their timidity, however, respects war alone; for to many other species of danger they expose themselves with surprising intrepidity, whether in
<PB N="202" REF="2130"/>
ascending and descending mountains and preci∣pices with their snow-shoes and in sledges, or in venturing amidst whirlpools and cataracts in little slender boats made of thin fir-boards, fastened to∣gether with thongs of leather, sinews of wild beasts, or tough and flexible twigs of willow and osier. These boats are of different sizes, from two to six yards in length, managed with oars, and caulked with moss, so tight as to keep out the water.</P>
<P>The Laplanders are more or less civilized as they communicate with strangers, or live among woods and forests, sequestered from all correspon∣dence. The mountaineers live chiefly on the flesh and the milk of the rein-deer. The flesh they dry in the cold, and the milk produces abundance of cheese. Those who live in the low country, feed on venison and fish. They have neither bread nor salt; but, in lieu of both, use the inner rind of the pine-tree, dried and ground, and dried fish re∣duced to powder. They make confections and decoctions of berries, angelica, and sorrel, which they deem preservatives against the scurvy. They make broth of fish and flesh boiled together; and their usual drink is water heated in a kettle, which hangs continually over the fire in winter: but their greatest dainty is bears-flesh, which they eat on all great festivals. On these occasions likewise they indulge themselves with brandy, and never think themselves so happy as when they can enjoy a pipe of tobacco. These commodities, together with a few cows and sheep for their winter-store, the bet∣ter sort of Laplanders purchase in Norway.</P>
<P>They lodge in wretched houses, composed of rafters joined together, and covered partly with turf, and partly with the boughs or bark of pine∣trees, and a coarse kind of cloath. Each hut is furnished with two doors, one smaller than the
<PB N="203" REF="2140"/>
other: at the former the men sally forth to their hunting, or other occupations; but no woman is permitted to make use of this entry, lest she should meet the man in his out-going; a circumstance in∣terpreted into a very bad omen. They have neither chimney nor window; but a hole at the top of the hut, which lets in the light, and lets out the smoke. In a word, these habitations are no more than miserable hovels, without conve∣nience or comfort; in which the people sit or lie promiscuously, like beasts, around the fire, inve∣loped in a thick impenetrable gloom of acrid smoke, that corrodes their eyes, and renders the atmo∣sphere altogether unfit for respiration. Yet, even here, the poor Laplander is content with his situa∣tion, and enjoys life with some degree of relish: he has his feasts, his feats, his diversions, and his amours. He is secured in the possession of unin∣terrupted health by temperance and exercise, which, together with the severity of the climate, brace his nerves to a very unusual pitch of strength, and fortify his constitution in such a manner, that he often lives to the age of an hun∣dred, without feeling the least pang of distemper, or even perceiving his vigour impaired; for it is not uncommon to see a Laplander in extreme old age hunting, fowling, skaiting, and performing all the severest exercises with undiminished agility.</P>
<P>The summer-garb of the men consists of a long coat of coarse cloth, reaching down to the middle of the leg, and girded round the waist with a belt or girdle; from which depend a Norway knife, and a pouch, containing slints, matches, and to∣bacco, with other necessaries; the girdle itself being decorated with brass rings and chains. Their caps are made of the skin of the lumme, or northern diver, with the feathers on; and their shoes are of the rein-deer skin, with the hair outwards. They wear
<PB N="204" REF="2150"/>
no linnen; but the garments of the better sort are of a finer cloth, and they delight in a variety of colours; though red, as being the most glaring, is the most agreeable. In winter they are totally cased up in coats, caps, boots, and gloves, made of the rein-deers skin, with the hair inwards. The women's apparel differs very little from that of the other sex; only their girdles are more ornamented with rings, chains, needle-cases, and toys, that sometimes weigh twenty pounds. In winter both men and women lie in their furs: in summer they cover themselves intirely with coarse blankets, to defend them from the gnats, which are intolerable. The Laplanders are not only well disposed, but naturally ingenious. They make all their own furniture, their boats, their sledges, their bows and arrows. They form neat boxes of thin birch∣boards, and inlay them with the horn of the rein∣deer. The Swedes are very fond of the Lapland baskets, made of the roots of trees, slit in long thin pieces, and twisted together so nicely that they will hold water. Among the manufactures of that country we likewise number curious horn-spoons, and moulds in which they cast the tin-jewels that adorn their girdles. Over and above these do∣mestic occupations, the men within doors perform the office of cooks, in dressing victuals for the family. The women act as taylors and embroi∣derers: they make cloaths, shoes, and boots, and harness for the rein-deer: they spin thread of fur, and knit it into caps and gloves, that are soft and warm: they draw tin into wire through a horn, and with this they cover their thread, which they use in embroidering the figures of beasts, flowers, trees, and stars upon their caps and girdles.</P>
<P>The Laplanders make surprising excursions upon the snow in their hunting expeditions. They pro∣vide themselves each with a pair of skates, or snow∣shoes,
<PB REF="2160"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="205" REF="2170"/>
which are no other than fir-boards covered with the rough skin of the rein-deer, turned in such a manner, that the hair rises against the snow, otherwise they would be too slippery. One of these shoes is usually as long as the person who wears them; the other is about a foot shorter. The feet stand in the middle, and to them they are fastened by thongs, or withs. The Laplander, thus equipped, wields a long pole in his hand, near the end of which there is a round ball of wood, to prevent its piercing too deep in the snow; and with this he stops himself occasionally. By means of these accou∣trements he will travel at the rate of sixty miles a-day, without being fatigued: he will ascend steep moun∣tains, and slide down again with amazing swiftness.</P>
<P>The Laplander not only travels a-foot, but is provided with a carriage drawn by the rein∣deer, in which he journeys with still greater rapi∣dity. This sledge, called pulkha, is made in the form of a small boat, with a convex bottom, that it may slide the more easily over the snow: the prow is sharp and pointed; but the sledge is flat behind. The, traveller is swathed in this carriage like an infant in a cradle, with a stick in his hand, to steer the vessel, and disengage it from pieces of rock or stumps of trees, that may chance to en∣counter it in the route. He must also ballance the sledge with his body, otherwise he will be in dan∣ger of being overturned. The traces, by which this carriage is fastened to the rein-deer, are fixed to a collar about the animal's neck, and run down over the breast, between the fore and hind legs, to be connected with the prow of the sledge: the reins, managed by the traveller, are tied to the horns; and the trappings are furnished with little bells, the sound of which is agreeable to the ani∣mal. With this draught at his tail, the rein-deer
<PB N="206" REF="2180"/>
will fly like lightning over hill and dale, so as to run at the rate of two hundred miles a-day: before he sets out the Laplander whispers in his ear the way he is to follow, and the place at which he is to halt; firmly persuaded, that the beast understands his meaning: but, in spite of this intimation, he frequently stops short, long before he has reached the journey's end; and sometimes he overshoots the mark by several leagues. When the traveller endeavours to manage him by the reins, he very often proves restif, and is so much incensed, that he kicks the carriage with great fury. In that case the Laplander overturns it for his own preserva∣tion, and lies under it, like a tortoise in his shell, until the animal has gratified his revenge. Not∣withstanding all the boasted docility of the rein∣deer, it must be owned, that his surprising pro∣gress with these sledges, is no more than a constant endeavour to disengage himself from an incum∣brance: nor is this way of travelling either easy, or exempted from the most imminent danger, from the uncertainty of the roads, and the drifts of loose snow, which, if the wind blows high, are driven about with incredible fury. The posture of a man in one of these pulkhas is half sitting, and half lying, so as to be extremely confined and uneasy. In the beginning of winter the Laplanders mark the most frequented roads, by strewing them with fir-boughs; and, indeed, these roads are no other than pathways made through the snow by the rein∣deer and the pulkhas: their being frequently co∣vered with new snow, and alternately beaten by the carriage, consolidates them into a kind of cause∣way; which is the harder, if the surface has felt a partial thaw, and been crusted by a subsequent frost. It requires great caution to follow these tracks; for, if the carriage deviates to the right
<PB N="207" REF="2190"/>
or left, the traveller is plunged into an abyss of snow. In less frequented parts, where there is no such beaten road, the Laplander directs his course by certain marks which he has made on the trees; but, notwithstanding all his caution, the rein-deer very often sinks up to the horns in snow. Should a hurricane arise, the snow would be whirled about in such a manner as to blind and overwhelm the traveller, unless he should be provided with a tent, to screen him in some measure from the fury of the tempest.</P>
<P>The Laplanders recount many stories of persons, who, together with their pulkhas and rein-deer, have been whirled aloft in the air by those hurri∣canes; and sometimes dashed against rocks, and sometimes precipitated into the midst of lakes and rivers.</P>
<P>In winter the rein-deer is weak, meagre, and dispirited, so that he does not travel with alacrity: his master is obliged to halt from time to time, that the animal may rest himself; and in these in∣tervals he is fed with a kind of cake, made of moss and snow, which serves him both for drink and provender. While the snow is loose, the rein-deer will dig with his feet to a prodigious depth, in quest of this vegetable; but when the surface of the earth is crusted with ice, the natives must be at the pains to break it, for the benefit of these animals. Nevertheless, the Laplanders have great reason to cherish this creature with uncommon re∣gard, as the best gift of Providence; for, without subjecting them to the least expence, the rein-deers supply them with almost every necessary of life. From this animal the Laplander is furnished with milk and cheese: he eats the flesh, and preserves it for winter-store. The skin affords caps, cloaths, boots, shoes, bedding, thongs, and many other conveniences. The nerves and sinews are twisted
<PB N="208" REF="2200"/>
into thread: their bows and arrows are tipped with the bones, and their boxes inlaid with the horn, which is likewise formed into curious spoons, toys, and utensils. These animals, when alive, not only serve the purposes already mentioned, but are like∣wise used as beasts of draught and burthen; and, far from demanding a provision of provender, dig with their own feet among the snow for the moss, which they prefer to all other provision.</P>
<P>The chief occupation of the Laplanders is hunt∣ing, and this exercise they perform in various ways. In summer they hunt the wild beasts with small dogs, trained to the diversion. In winter they pursue them by their tracks upon the snow, skat∣ing with such velocity, that they very often run down the prey. They catch ermines in traps, and sometimes with dogs. They kill squirrels, mar∣tens, and sables with blunt darts, to avoid wound∣ing the skin. Foxes and beavers are slain with sharp-pointed darts and arrows, in shooting which they are accounted the best marksmen in the world. The larger beasts, such as bears, wolves, elks, and wild rein-deer, they either kill with fire-arms, pur∣chased in Sweden or Norway, or take in snares, and pits dug in the forests. Their particular laws, relating to the chace, are observed with great punctuality. The beast becomes the property of the man in whose snare or pit he is caught; and he who discovers a bear's den has the exclusive pri∣vilege of hunting him to death. The conquest of a bear is the most honourable atchievement that a Laplander can perform; and the flesh of this ani∣mal they account the greatest delicacy on earth. The bear is always dispatched with a fusil, some∣times laid as a snare, ready cocked and primed; but more frequently in the hands of the hunter, who runs the most imminent risque of his life, should he miss his aim of wounding the beast mor∣tally.
<PB N="209" REF="2210"/>
The death of a bear is celebrated by the Laplanders as a signal victory. The carcase is drawn to the cabin or hut of the victor by a rein∣deer, which is kept sacred from any other work for a whole year after this service. The bear is surrounded by a great number of men, women, and children, reciting a particular hymn, or song of triumph; in which they thank the vanquished enemy for having allowed himself to be overcome, without doing any mischief to his conqueror, and welcome his arrival: then they make an apostrophe to heaven, expressing their acknowledgment to God, that he has created beasts for the use of men, and endued mankind with strength and courage to overcome and attack the fiercest of the brute crea∣tion. The hero is saluted by the women, who spit chewed elder-bark in his face. He is feasted three days successively, and his cap is decorated with an additional figure wrought in tin-wire.</P>
<P>The manner in which the young Laplander chuses a wife is equally remarkable and ludicrous. When he has pitched upon a female, he employs some friends as mediators with the father; and these being provided with some bottles of brandy, the suitor accompanies them to the hut of his fu∣ture father-in-law, who invites the mediators to enter; but the lover is left without, until the liquor be drank, and the proposal discussed: then he is called in, and entertained with such fare as the hut affords, yet without seeing his mistress, who retires, and goes out on this occasion. Having obtained leave of her parents to make his addresses in person, he puts on his best apparel, is admitted to the lady, whom he salutes with a kiss: then he presents her with the tongue of a rein-deer, a piece of beaver's flesh, or some other sort of provision. She declines the offer, which is made in presence of her sisters and relations; but makes a signal to
<PB N="210" REF="2220"/>
the lover to follow her into the fields, where she accepts the presents. Thus encouraged, he begs her permission to sleep with her in the hut: if she consents, there is no further difficulty: if she dis∣approves of the proposal, she drops his presents on the ground. When the lovers are agreed, the youth is permitted to visit his inamorata as often as he shall think proper; but every time he comes, he must purchase this pleasure with a fresh bottle of brandy: a perquisite so agreeable to the father, that he often postpones the celebration of the nup∣tials for two or three years. At length the cere∣mony is performed at church, by the priest of the parish. Even after this event, the husband is obliged to serve his father-in-law a whole year; at the expiration of which he retires to his own habi∣tation with his wife, and her patrimony of rein∣deer, and receives presents from all his friends and relations. From this period he sequesters his wife from the company of all strangers, especially of the male sex, and watches over her conduct with the most jealous vigilance.</P>
<P>Many Lapland women are barren, and none of them are very fruitful. A woman, immediately after delivery, swallows a draught of whale-fat: the child is washed with snow, or cold water, and wrapped up in a hare-skin. The mother is seldom above five days in the straw, and in fourteen is generally quite recovered: then she carries the child to church to be baptized. Before she can reach the residence of the priest, she is often obliged to traverse large forests, mountains, lakes, and wide-extended wastes of snow. The infant is fastened in a hollowed piece of wood, stretched naked on a bed of fine moss, covered with the soft skin of a young rein-deer, and slung by two straps to the back of the mother, who always suckles her own child. At home this little cradle is hung to
<PB N="211" REF="2230"/>
the roof of the hut, and the child lulled asleep by swinging it from one side to the other. The boys, from their infancy, practise the bow; and are not al∣lowed to break their fast, until they have hit the mark. The female children are as early initiated in the business peculiar to their sex.</P>
<P>These people, though for the most part vigor∣ous and healthy, are not altogether exempted from distemper. They are subject to sore eyes, and even to blindness, from the smoke of their huts, and the fire to which they are almost continually exposed. Some waste away in consumptions; others are af∣flicted with rheumatic pains, and the scurvy; and a few are subject to vertigo and apoplexy. For the cure of all their internal disorders, they use no other medicine than the decoction of a certain spe∣cies of moss; and, when this cannot be procured, they boil the stalk of angelica in the milk of the rein-deer. In order to remove a fixed pain, they apply a large mushroom, burning hot, to the part affected; and this produces a blister, which is sup∣posed to draw off the peccant humour. To their wounds they apply nothing but the turpentine that drops from the fir-tree. When they are frost∣bitten, they thrust a red hot iron into a cheese, made of rein-deer's milk, and with the fat that drops from it anoint the frozen member, which generally recovers. When a Laplander is sup∣posed to be on his death-bed, his friends exhort him to die in the faith of Christ, and bear his suf∣ferings with resignation, by remembering the pas∣sion of our Saviour. They are not, however, very ready to attend him in his last moments; and as soon as he expires quit the place with precipita∣tion, apprehending some injury from his spirit or ghost, which they believe remains with the corpse, and takes all opportunities of doing mis∣chief to the living. The deceased is wrapped up
<PB N="212" REF="2240"/>
in woollen or linnen, according to his circum∣stances, and deposited in a coffin by a person se∣lected for that purpose: but this office he will not perform, unless he is first secured from the ill∣offices of the manes, by a consecrated brass ring fixed on his left arm. The christian religion in this country has not yet dispelled all the rites of heathenish superstition: together with the body they put in the coffin an ax, a flint, and steel, a flask of brandy, some dried fish and venison. With the ax the deceased is supposed to hew down the bushes or boughs that may obstruct his passage in the other world: the steel and flint are designed for striking a light, should he find himself in the dark at the day of judgment; and on the provision they think he may subsist during his journey.</P>
<P>The Muscovite Laplanders observe other cere∣monies, that bear an affinity to the superstitions of the Greek church. They not only supply the de∣funct with money, but likewise provide him with money for the porter of Paradise, and a certificate signed by the priest, and directed to St. Peter, specifying that the bearer had lived like a good Christian, and ought to be admitted into heaven. At the head of the coffin they place a little image of St. Nicholas, who is greatly reverenced in all parts of Muscovy as a friend to the dead. Before the interment, the friends of the deceased kindle a fire of fir-boughs near the coffin, and express their sorrow in tears and lamentations. They walk in procession several times round the body, de∣manding, in a whining tone, the reason of his leaving them on earth. They ask whether he was out of humour with his wife; whether he was in want of meat, drink, cloathing, or other necessa∣ries; and whether he had not succeeded in hunt∣ing and fishing? These and other such interroga∣tions, to which the defunct makes no reply, are
<PB N="213" REF="2250"/>
intermingled with groans and hideous howlings; and, between whiles, the priest sprinkles the corpse and the mourners alternately with holy water. Finally, the body is conveyed to the place of in∣terment on a sledge, drawn by a rein-deer; and this, together with the cloaths of the deceased, are left as the priest's perquisite. Three days after the burial, the kinsmen and friends of the defunct are invited to an entertainment, where they eat the flesh of the rein-deer which conveyed the corpse to the burying-ground. This being a sacrifice to the manes, the bones are collected into a basket, and interred. Two thirds of the effects of the deceased are inherited by his brothers, and the remainder divided among his sisters: but the lands, lakes, and rivers, are held in coparceny by all the chil∣dren of both sexes, according to the division made by Charles IX. of Sweden, when he assigned a cer∣tain tract of land to each family.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMMERCE, STRENGTH, and REVENUE.</HEAD>
<P>The commerce of the Laplanders is more con∣siderable than one would expect in a desart coun∣try, inhabited by a savage ignorant people. They export great quantities of fish to the northern parts of Bothnia and White Russia. They likewise trade with the neighbouring countries of Norway, Swe∣den, Muscovy, and Finland, by selling rein-deer, fine furs, baskets, and toys of their own manufac∣ture, dried pikes, and cheese made of the rein∣deer's milk. In return for these commodities they receive rixdollars, woollen cloths, linnen, copper, tin, flour, oil, hides, needles, knives, spirituous liquors, tobacco, and other necessaries. The Lap∣landers march in caravans to the fairs in Finland and Norway: these are composed of a long string of thirty or forty rein-deer and pulkhas, tied to one another, the foremost being led by a Lap∣lander
<PB N="214" REF="2260"/>
a-foot. When they have chosen a spot for an encampment, which is often in the midst of a river, they form a large circle of their rein-deer and pulkhas ready yoked; and the animals, lying down quietly on the snow, are fed with moss by their masters. The people kindle great fires, around which men, women, and children sit, and sup on dried fish: but the more voluptuous pitch their tents on the ice, and spread their bear-skins, on which they lie at their ease, and smoke tobacco.</P>
<P>The revenue arising from this country is of no great consequence: it is payed partly in rixdollars, but chiefly in furs: nay, some, that can procure neither, pay the tribute in dried pikes. The pro∣duce of the mines forms likewise a considerable article. Fifty squirrel skins, or one fox-skin, with a pair of Lapland shoes, are valued at one rixdollar. Part of the taxes is allotted for the maintenance of the Lapland clergy.</P>
<P>The frightful aspect of this country has been deemed a more effectual defence than artificial bul∣works and garrisons, of which here are none; or than the arms and courage of the natives, who are neither warlike in themselves, nor in the least tinc∣tured with discipline.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>THE PARTICULAR DISTRICTS OF SWEDISH LAPLAND.</HEAD>
<P>ANgermandland-Lapmark is the most southern province of Lapland, and the principal town is Aosalko. The whole country, however, is inter∣spersed, though at great distances, with little vil∣lages that deserve no particular description. Uma-Lapmark,
<PB N="215" REF="2270"/>
situated more northerly, is denominated from the river Uma, which traverses the district from west to east, through several extensive lakes, receiving in its course the river Wendela, which is very considerable. In the middle of this province stands the hamlet Laisby; and another, called Se∣misjerfie, is situated on the confines of Pytha. The next district is Pytha-Lapmark, bounded on the west by the Norwegian mountains, by Bothnia on the east, and Lula-Lapmark on the north. This province is remarkable for a great number of large lakes, and contains three villages; namely, Sitonia, in the north, near the Dofrine mountains; Ar∣roitzerfs, in the middle of the district; and Loch∣tari, near the confines of Bothnia. Lula-Lapmark lies between the mountains of Norway and Both∣nia, to the northward of Pitha-Lapmark, and to the southward of Torno. The rivers of this dis∣trict are the Great and Little Lula, which run through different lakes, crossing the Polar Circle, and join near the village of Jackmath, in the south∣west part of the district. Towards the north are the villages of Torpajour and Sirkeflucht, situated at the distance of thirty miles from each other.</P>
<P>Torno-Lapmark is the most northern province of Swedish Lapland, bounded on the north-west by the Dofrine mountains, by Danish Lapland on the north, by Lula-Lapmark on the south, and on the east by part of Bothnia and Kimi-Lapmark. Its chief rivers are Calix, Torno, and Kengis, which last disembogues itself in the Torno, at a place called Kengis. The most considerable lake of this district is also denominated Torno; near which stands the village of Tingavara; and there is a copper-mine about eighty miles towards the south-east of this place. The other villages of Torno-Lapmark are Rounala and Sandewara, to
<PB N="216" REF="2280"/>
the eastward of Tingavara; and Titisara, a few miles to the southward. It was in this district that four members of the French academy measured a degree of the meridian, in the year 1736, in order to ascertain the figure of the earth.</P>
<P>Kimi Lapmark lies between the gulph of Both∣nia, Muscovite Lapland, and Danish Lapland. The northern part of this province is remarkable for the great lake Encure, which gives rise to a river that runs into the Frozen Sea, a little beyond the seventeenth degree of north latitude. The principal places of this district are Soniby, Kimibi, and Kalajeriui, situated at the foot of the moun∣tains which divide this country from Danish and Muscovite Lapland. Solden-Kyli, and Kitijor∣fuilye, are more to the southward; and the town of Kimi stands at the mouth of the river so called, on the gulph of Bothnia.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES of NATURE, and of ART.</HEAD>
<P>In the province of Torno there is a spring of pure water issuing from the mountain Kittis, which, in the severest winter, still preserves its fluidity. About thirty leagues to the northward of this place, in the middle of a vast forest, be∣tween the Ocean and the gulph of Bothnia, is a stone monument, which the Laplanders revere as the greatest wonder of their country. This is a stone about three feet in length, of an irregular form, appearing one foot and an half above ground. The surface, which slopes a little, exhibits two lines of what resembles letters, about an inch long, and very deep, that seem to have been cut by the tool of a mason: below these lines are some cha∣racters, still larger; but whether they are the work of Nature, or of Art, it is not easy to determine.
<PB N="217" REF="2290"/>
The stone appears to be composed of different layers: that on which the characters are engraven is a kind of flint; but the interval between the lines is much more soft and scaly. Mr. Brunnius, curate of the place, has published a description of Torno and its neighbourhood, in which he de∣scribes this stone; and affirms, that the inscription is in the Runic character: he likewise declares, that the stone formerly exhibited the figures of three crowns, which time has now effaced. But Mr. Celsius, who was a connoisseur in that lan∣guage, could not read the characters, which were quite different from those he had seen in Sweden; and of the crowns there is not the least vestige to be perceived. It would be a difficult task to ac∣count for an inscription in the heart of Lapland, a country scarce accessible to foreigners; unless we suppose it a kind of tomb-stone, erected to the memory of some person, who perhaps having been shipwrecked in the gulph of Bothnia, penetrated thus far with some attendants in quest of succour, and in this place expired. There is something ex∣travagantly improbable in the notion of Mauper∣tuis, who thinks that this monument was erected at a time when Lapland enjoyed a more favourable climate, before some of those grand revolutions by which the position of the earth has been altered. <Q>“The Polar Circles (says he) were then perhaps what the Tropics are now; and the Torrid Zone occupied the place of what is now called the Temperate Zones.”</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SWEDEN.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SITUATION and EXTENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom of Sweden, or Suecia, in∣cluding the greatest part of Scandinavia, extends from 55 degrees and 20 minutes, to 69 degrees and 30 minutes northern latitude, lying between the 12th and 32d degrees of longi∣tude east from London. On the south it is bounded by the Baltic, the Sound, and the Scha∣ger-rack, or Categate; on the north by Danish Lapland; on the east by Muscovy; and on the west by the mountains of Norway. The country is twice as large as France; but great part of it being en∣grossed by seas, lakes, mountains, hills, woods, heaths, and marshes, the number of inhabitants bears a very small proportion to the extent of its boundaries.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="219" REF="2310"/>
<HEAD>DIVISION, MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>Sweden is divided into seven parts, namely, Sweden, properly so called, bounded by Norway and the gulph of Bothnia, Gothland, Livonia, In∣gria, Finland, Lapland, and the islands in the Bal∣tic. These, and the subdivisions, we shall parti∣cularly describe, after having given a general ac∣count of the whole.</P>
<P>The remarkable mountains, rivers, lakes, and forests, will enter into that description: suffice it to observe in general, that the mountains are nu∣merous, huge, and hoary; that the kingdom is watered by many navigable rivers; that the lakes are of prodigious extent and incredible depth, not only supplying swarms of delicious fish, but also affording the convenience of carriage, in boats in the summer, and on sleds in the winter; that in these lakes, and along the sea-coast, there are in∣numerable islands, of which above six thousand are actually inhabited: the rest are either bare rocks, or small isles covered with wood: that the face of the country is in a great measure overspread by vast forests of pine, fir, beech, birch, alder, juniper, and some oak. These trees grow so close together, and such a number of those that fall are left to rot where they lie, that in many places the woods are altogether impassable. The timber is, in general, as good as that of Norway; and there is such abun∣dance of it, that firing is very cheap and plentiful.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE, LIGHT, and SEASONS.</HEAD>
<P>If the winter's cold in Sweden be intense, the heat of the summer is excessive. The sun, at the highest, continues above the horizon of Stockholm eighteen hours and a half, and produces an unin∣terrupted
<PB N="220" REF="2320"/>
day of several weeks; and in winter day∣light is proportionably defective: yet this defect is tolerably well supplied by the moon, the stars, and the northern lights, reflected from the snow, thro' the medium or a sky remarkably screne.</P>
<P>With respect to seasons, there is no regular suc∣cession of spring and summer. The winter sets in early, without any intervention of mild weather analogous to our autumn; and the summer seems to burst at once from the embraces of winter, with∣out being gradually disengaged by the interposi∣tion of spring. The productions of the earth ve∣getate and ripen more speedily than in southern climates, because they are warmed by an uninter∣rupted sun, which is so hot as often to set the woods on fire, and produce dreadful conflagrations. On the other hand, such is the severity of the win∣ter's cold, that people are very apt to lose their limbs, noses, and even life itself, if they neglect the proper precautions of wearing warm furs and sheep-skins abroad, and of keeping their apart∣ments comfortably warm with stoves, and other contrivances. When the nose, or any extremity of a limb, begins to be affected by the frost, it ex∣hibits a livid colour, as a symptom of a beginning mortification: in that case the most speedy and ef∣fectual remedy they have hitherto discovered, is the sudden application of snow to the part affected.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL, VEGETABLES, and FRUITS.</HEAD>
<P>Where the face of the country is so covered with rocks and mountains, the soil cannot be in general fertile. There are, however, very fruitful spots between the hills; and, even where the soil is not more than half a foot from the surface, the ground, if properly cultivated, would yield plenty of corn: but agriculture is very little understood in this country. The land is generally tilled with a slight
<PB N="221" REF="2330"/>
wooden plough, drawn by a single ox, and con∣ducted by one female servant. In barren parts the Swedish farmers burn a number of trees, and the seed-corn being raked among the ashes, produces good increase, without further cultivation. The Swedes are so little skilled in husbandry, and so little addictèd to this kind of labour, that they do not raise grain sufficient for the occasions of the kingdom. Great quantities are imported from Livonia, and other countries bordering on the Bal∣tic: the poorer sort, in the remote parts of the kingdom, are obliged, in imitation of their Nor∣wegian neighbours, to grind the inner bark of birch-trees, and use it in bread, mixed with a small proportion of flour. This scarcity, however, is owing rather to the idleness of the people, than to want of fertility in the land.</P>
<P>In summer the fields are cloathed with verdure, intermingled with a variety of flowers; and the whole face of the country, even the rocks included, is overspread with strawberries, raspberries, cur∣rants, and other fruits of the same nature, spon∣taneously produced. Their kitchen-gardens yield plenty of pot-herbs and roots. Melons are here brought to perfection in dry seasons. Cherries of different kinds, and agreeable flavour, are found in their orchards. Their apples, pears, and plumbs, are more common than delicate: but apricots, peaches, and nectarines, are but little cultivated in this kingdom.</P>
<P>Sweden has native plants and vegetables, in common with other cold mountainous countries: a catalogue of them may be seen in the works of the celebrated Linnaeus, that great improver of botany.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="222" REF="2340"/>
<HEAD>ANIMALS: QUADRUPEDS.</HEAD>
<P>The cattle, horses, and sheep of Sweden resemble those of Norway in size and nature. Their beef and mutton is small, but sweet and juicy. Their wool is so coarse, that it can be used for nothing but cloathing to the peasants. Their horses are hardy, nimble, sure-footed, and so strong, that, if we may believe the Swedes, they are able to resist and even break the best German cavalry.</P>
<P>Among the wild beasts of Sweden we number the elk, the deer, the bear, the hare, the wolf, the fox, the wild cat, the squirrel, and other animals, which we have already described in our account of Denmark. These are hunted for their flesh or fur, or both: the Swedish hunters generally kill their prey with guns, and are accounted excellent marks∣men.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>All sorts of poultry are reared in Sweden as in other countries. Of game there is great plenty, both land-birds and sea-fowl. Besides partridges, and other birds called yerpers, which resemble this species, there is the orra, as large as a hen, and the keder, equal in size to a turkey. In winter the Swedish sportsmen kill great numbers of thrushes, blackbirds, and sydenswans; which last are about the size of fieldfares, but of more exquisite flavour. They are gorgeously arrayed in feathers, tipped with scarlet, and supposed to come from Lapland. Here too are pigeons, though very scarce in the woods, on account of the birds of prey which fre∣quent this country; such as eagles, vultures, hawks, and kites. Some years ago a hawk is said to have been killed in Finland, having upon one leg a small plate of gold with this inscription, <HI>Je</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="2350"/>
<HI>suis au Roy;</HI> and on the other a plate of silver thus inscribed, <HI>Le Duc de Chevreuse me gardé.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FISHES.</HEAD>
<P>The lakes and rivers of Sweden abound with salmon, trout, perch, tench, pikes, eels, and a fish called the streamling, smaller than the pilcher, caught in great quantities, pickled, barrelled, and distributed through all parts of the kingdom. The gulph of Finland harbours vast numbers of seals, from which the natives extract a considerable quan∣tity of train-oil for exportation. The lakes of this country are so replenished with pikes, that they are salted and dried for sale in great numbers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>METALS and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>Sweden is famous for its mines of silver, cop∣per, and iron; some of which have been worked from time immemorial: but the natives are either little acquainted with metallurgy, or the ore yields a very small proportion of metal. There is one silver mine, the first gallery of which is above one hundred fathoms below the surface of the earth: here is a space as large and as high as a church, and the roof is supported by vast arches of oak: from hence they descend above forty fathoms to the lowest vein. The mine produces about twenty thousand crowns yearly in fine silver, which the king has the privilege of purchasing for one fourth less than the real value. The chief copper-mine is about eighty fathoms in depth, extending a great way under ground, and yielding a prodigious quantity of ore. The copper yearly produced, amounts to about two hundred thousand pounds sterling; of which one fourth part, payed in kind, is the king's property: the remainder, if exported unwrought, is saddled with an additional duty of
<PB N="224" REF="2360"/>
five and twenty per centum. In the mountainous parts of Sweden, which afford water-falls for the conveniency of turning mills, the natives have erected forges, and prosecute the work of iron∣mines with great industry. Over and above the consumption of Sweden itself, these works have been known to supply yearly iron for exportation to the value of three hundred thousand pounds. But the business was at length overstocked; and the foreign demand for iron being considerably lessened, the commodity grew so cheap, that the manufacturers could no longer proceed with any tolerable degree of advantage; so that many forges were deserted, and a great number of poor people, who depended upon these works, were deprived of their subsistence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their LANGUAGE, and RELI∣GION.</HEAD>
<P>The Swedish language is a dialect of the antient Gothic or Teutonic, and bears a near affinity with that of Denmark. This language is a dialect of the Moeso-gothic, spoken antiently by the inha∣bitants of Moesian Tartary, from whence the northern parts of Europe are supposed to have been peopled. The only specimen of the language then spoken by the Scythian Goths in Moesia, is pre∣served in the silver book at Upsal, being a transla∣tion of the four Gospels, by Ulphilas bishop of the Goths, seated upon the <HI>Palus Moeotis.</HI> The purest dialect of this antient tongue is now found among the Dalekarlians, or Highlanders of Sweden, and in the island of Iceland; in which places curious people have observed a surprising conformity with the English, both in language and pronunciation.</P>
<P>The Lutheran doctrine was established in Swe∣den soon after it began to prevail in the protestant
<PB N="225" REF="2370"/>
parts of Germany. Gustavus Vasa, the founder of the present royal family in Sweden, was the prince who first introduced the tenets of Luther. He ascended the throne in the year 1523, and not only rendered the regal dignity hereditary in his own family, but established the reformed religion in Sweden, where it still continues to flourish with surprising uniformity. This is partly owing to the rigorous execution of the laws, which prohibit all sects, and punish all dissenters; partly to the na∣ture and disposition of the people, who are dull, ignorant, and entirely resigned to the spiritual direction of their clergy, without any desire to in∣quire or dispute about controverted points of faith and doctrine; and, lastly, to the care, assiduity, and regular lives of the clergy, by which they acquire a surprising influence over the minds of their au∣dience. An attempt was once made to re-establish the Roman catholick religion in Sweden, and the peace of the country was not a little disturbed: but the scheme proved abortive; and now the go∣vernment is so much upon its guard against any future effort of the same kind, that no popish priest can enter the kingdom, without running the risque of castration.</P>
<P>The Swedish church is governed by one arch∣bishop and thirteen suffragans, who confine them∣selves intirely to the occupations of their own function: they are, indeed, present at the assembly of the states; but are never called to council, nor do they ever intermeddle in the administration of state-affairs. Their revenues are very moderate; that of the metropolitan not exceeding four hun∣dred pounds sterling: those of the bishops are pro∣portionably smaller. Under these are seven or eight superintendants, vested with the power, though not the name of bishops; and over each ten churches a provost or rural dean presides, to superintend
<PB N="226" REF="2380"/>
the conduct of the inferior clergy; the number of whom, including chaplains and curates, may amount to four thousand: for there may be about half that number of churches in Sweden and Finland.</P>
<P>Upsal is the metropolitan see of Sweden: the inferior dioceses are those of Linkopings, Skara, Strengnas, Westeros, Wegsio, Abo, Lund, Borgo, Gothembourg, Calmar, Carlstad, Hernosand, and Wisby. In the election of the archbishop all the consistories or chapters of the kingdom give their votes; but the suffragans are chosen in the follow∣ing manner: Three persons are presented by the chapter to the king, who confers the diocese on one of them, with the advice of the senate. Simple benefices are bestowed in Sweden, as in England, by right of presentation; which is sometimes vested in the crown, and sometimes in the nobility. The inferior clergy are generally of the lower class of people, sons of peasants, or poor burghers; so that they live the more contented with their small income, which arises from certain inconsiderable dues, glebe-lands, and one third of the tythes: the other two thirds are vested in the crown, to be employed in pious and charitable uses. Notwith∣standing their poverty, the Swedish priests are ex∣tremely hospitable, in entertaining poor strangers and travellers. The churches of Sweden are well ornamented with gilding, painting, and sculpture. They are kept neat and clean, in good repair, and furnished with rich altar-cloths and vestments. The church is governed according to a body of ecclesiastical laws and canons, revised by a com∣mittee chosen from the different states that com∣pose the diet, and approved by the sovereign. By these it is decreed, that if any Swedish subject changes his religion, he shall be banished the king∣dom, and lose all right of inheritance for himself and his descendants: that if any person continues
<PB N="227" REF="2390"/>
excommunicated above a year, he shall be impri∣soned a month, during which he shall be fed with bread and water only, and then banished: that if any person shall introduce into Sweden teachers of another religion, he shall be fined and banished: that foreign ministers shall enjoy the free exercise of their religion for themselves and families only: that strangers shall not be allowed to exercise a dif∣ferent religion publickly; but their children shall be baptized by Lutheran ministers, and educated in their communion, otherwise they shall not enjoy the privileges of Swedish subjects. Thus the laity are obliged to a strict attendance on the duties of religion; and, indeed, the civil magistrate is im∣powered to punish, with imprisonment, all those who absent themselves from divine service, with∣out a proper excuse. But the clergy are not in∣trusted with the execution of their own laws; nor can they transact matters of any importance, with∣out the concurrence of the civil power. Many causes, formerly cognizable in the ecclesiastical courts, are now tried in secular tribunals. They are not even permitted to pronounce the sentence of excommunication without the king's permission, because, in that case, the state is deprived of a subject.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Their LAWS and COURTS of JUDICATURE.</HEAD>
<P>The laws of Sweden consist of a code which was compiled one hundred and fifty years ago, for the direction of the whole kingdom; and to these were joined posterior edicts, and ordinances: but this code being defective, causes are very often decided by the civil law, as well as by the dictates of equity; and, if they are of any consequence, they may be appealed to the king's supreme court of revision. There are four great tribunals of justice, or par∣liaments:
<PB N="228" REF="2400"/>
one established at Stockholm for Swe∣den, properly so called: another at Jonkoping for Gothland: a third at Abo, for the principality of Finland: and a fourth at Wismar, in the circle of Lower Saxony, for those German provinces that are subject to the Swedish dominions. In each of these tribunals or parliaments, which are supreme, there is one president, and a certain number of assessors: the four eldest of these assessors, in the parliament of Sweden, enjoy the title of counsellors of the justiciary; but, in the other tribunals, two of the assessors only are honoured with this appellation. These national courts take cognizance of all actions that respect the life and honour of the subject, as well as of civil causes, which may be appealed to them from inferior courts of judicature. Their business likewise is to inspect the conduct of infe∣rior judges, whether provincial or territorial: for there is a court in every district and corporation of the kingdom, vested with a power to take exami∣nations <HI>in loco,</HI> and try petty actions. In corpora∣tions this court consists of an alderman, or coun∣sellor, as judge, and a certain number of his bre∣thren as assistants. In provincial courts the go∣vernor of the district presides, and determines by the assistance of a standing jury: his tribunal is ambulatory, and generally held on or near the spot where the trespass was committed. Here exami∣nations are taken, and trifling causes decided; but actions of any consequence are evoked to the next superior court, of which there is one or more in every province, as well as in every corporation. The provincial judge is known by the name of Laghman. In the superior courts of cities, or cor∣porations, the burgomaster presides, and his alder∣men are assistant. From these courts all causes of blood must be transferred to the national tribunals, where they are determined without further appeal.
<PB N="229" REF="2410"/>
The salaries of the judges being small, and their places often filled with men of mean talents, ex∣posed to the temptations of corruption, as well as to the errors of ignorance, the subject would fre∣quently have reason to complain of their mistakes and partiality, were not all the sentences they pass in civil causes of any importance, subject to a re∣view in the court of revision, where the king in person presides, assisted by the president of the chancery, the chancellor of the court, and two or three privy counsellors.</P>
<P>Causes relating to the sea are cognizable in the ordinary courts of justice, and tried according to their marine laws, founded upon the antient sea∣laws of Wisby in the isle of Gothland, which were formerly as famous in the Baltic, as were the laws of Rhodes and Oleron in the places where these prevailed.</P>
<P>Ecclesiastical causes ought to be tried in the consistory of each diocese. There the bishop, as president, tries cases of bastardy, contracts of mar∣riage, and suits of scandal; and denounces the church censures of pennance or divorce: but this court has no power to administer an oath, or to inflict any corporal punishment; and from it there lies an ap∣peal to the national tribunal.</P>
<P>For disputes relating to the mines there are in∣ferior courts and officers, established in those parts of the country where these works are carried on; and from them causes of any importance are ap∣pealed to a general tribunal, called the college of the mines, fixed at Stockholm. Of this the pre∣sident of the treasury is commonly the chief judge, assisted by a vice-president, and other assessors.</P>
<P>The expence of law-suits is very moderate in Sweden. Every man is permitted, and in criminal actions compelled to plead his own cause. The law is practised by none but persons of an inferior
<PB N="230" REF="2420"/>
rank: the number of lawyers is but small, and they are generally in mean circumstances. A jury of twelve men is supposed to have been originally a Swedish institution. At present, however, it is disused, except in the lowest courts in the country, where the jurymen are chosen for life, and enjoy salaries. In other courts the cause is determined by a majority of voices; but here the twelve must be unanimous.</P>
<P>Titles to estates in Sweden are rendered the more secure, and less subject to contest, by the re∣gisters of sales, mortgages, and alienations, which are kept by every tribunal.</P>
<P>The governors of provinces, and the stadt∣holders of Stockholm and other towns, possess the power of executing all judicial sentences in their respective jurisdictions; and this power they occa∣sionally delegate to inferior officers, who are ac∣countable to the national tribunals, before whom they may be summoned, and punished, upon plain proof of default or delinquency. In crimi∣nal matters, when the proof is deficient, and the judge favourable, the defendant is allowed to purge himself by oath, which must be supported by the oaths of twelve responsible men, as vouchers for his innocence. This very institution did Alfred introduce and establish in England.</P>
<P>The crimes of treason, murther, adultery, wil∣ful burning, and witchcraft, are punished with death. The criminal, if a male, is hanged; if a woman, beheaded. Sometimes, according to the aggravation of the guilt, they are burned, quar∣tered, or hung in chains. Criminals of a superior rank are commonly shot to death. The punish∣ment annexed to theft has been changed from death to a kind of perpetual slavery. The crimi∣nal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s condemned to work for his life at fortifica∣tions, or other public labour. He is distinguished
<PB N="231" REF="2430"/>
by an iron collar round his neck, and a bell fastened to the end of a bow rising over his head, which bell rings as he moves along. When the death of one party is the consequence of a duel, the survivor is condemned to die, and a note of infamy is at∣tached to the memory of both. If neither party falls in the combat, both are imprisoned, and fed for two years on bread and water: they are besides fined in a thousand crowns each; or in two thou∣sand crowns, if the imprisonment is limited to one year. An affront is referred to the respective na∣tional court, where recantation, and begging par∣don in public, are commonly awarded as a suffi∣cient reparation of honour.</P>
<P>Estates descend by inheritance, in equal por∣tions, to the children: of these portions a son in∣herits two, and a daughter one. This is nearly the old British custom of gavel-kind. No parent can alter this disposition, without a judicial sentence obtained, in case any child should prove vitious or disobedient: but he may bequeath one tenth of his acquired estate upon any particular favourite among his children. Upon the death of a man, whose estate is incumbered with debts, the heir is allowed by the law two or three months, to inquire into and consider the circumstances of the defunct, that he may either accept of the inheritance, or leave it to the law, which, in this case, administers.</P>

<HEAD>GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The throne of Sweden was heretofore elective. In the year 1682 it became hereditary, and Charles XII. erected an absolute power. At his death a change of government immediately ensued. His sister and successor, the princess Ulrica-Eleonora, no sooner received information of his being killed at the siege of Frederickshal, in Norway, than she
<PB N="232" REF="2440"/>
assembled the senate, and was proclaimed queen of Sweden: perceiving, however, with what uneasi∣ness and impatience the nation bore the despotic government of her brother, she resolved to antici∣pate the wishes of her subjects, in restoring them to the fruition of their antient freedom. She forth∣with issued a proclamation, declaring she would re∣establish the old form of government, and abolish∣ing and renouncing, for herself and her successors, all absolute power and dominion. Nay, she took steps still more extraordinary for the satisfaction of her people: the states of Sweden being assembled at Stockholm, in the month of February, 1719, she not only made a solemn renunciation of all claim to absolute power, but declared she would accept the crown upon no other condition than that of election. In consequence of this welcome inti∣mation, the states declared the throne vacant, and then she was unanimously chosen their sovereign. This important measure being taken, they spent some time in settling the form of administration, according to the antient constitution. A motion was then made to associate with the queen her ma∣jesty's consort, the prince of Hesse; but this met with such opposition, that it was thought proper to drop the subject. At the next meeting of the diet, however, the queen recommended her hus∣band to a share of the royal dignity, in a letter addressed to each of the orders that compose the diet. A select committee was appointed to deli∣berate on the proposal; and violent disputes arising, her majesty wrote another letter to the states, sig∣nifying, that if any difficulty was made of ad∣mitting her consort to a share of the throne, she was willing to resign the whole in his favour. At the same time the prince sent a remonstrance to each order, declaring, that should they think pro∣per to vest him with the royal dignity, he would
<PB N="233" REF="2450"/>
confirm and ratify whatever restrictions and limita∣tions they should propose: that he would conform to the national church, and inviolably maintain its discipline as by law established: that as he had ad∣vised the queen to renounce all pretensions to abso∣lute power, so he would faithfully observe all the rules prescribed by the form of regency established in the last session: that he would transact nothing relating to Swedish affairs, without the advice and approbation of Swedish counsellors: that he would promote no foreigners to any employment, either civil or military: that he would encourage com∣merce, and exert all his endeavours for the glory and advantage of the Swedish nation.</P>
<P>The states immediately resolved to acquiesce in the queen's request; and this resolution was inti∣mated to her majesty by a select committee of each order. The prince was accordingly chosen king of Sweden, and the act of election presented to him by a deputation of the states, in presence of all the foreign ministers. His royal highness had previously signed an instrument, in which he so∣lemnly promised to observe inviolably the condi∣tions on which he was raised to the throne. Having heard the act of election recited, he was presented with the sceptre by count Horn, speaker of the house of nobles, at the head of the committee. His majesty forthwith restored the sceptre, and made a short speech on the occasion. He recapi∣tulated the promises he had already made, and assured them he would endeavour to live with them not only as their king, but as their friend and brother.</P>
<P>At this period Sweden was involved in a dan∣gerous war with all its neighbours: but the new king in a little time concluded three different trea∣ties of peace; one with Denmark, another with Prussia; and a third with the czar of Muscovy. In
<PB N="234" REF="2460"/>
consequence of these treaties, the Swedes recovered part of Pomerania, and the town of Wismar; but his Prussian majesty retained the dutchy of Stetin: while those of Bremen and Verden were left in the hands of the elector of Hanover; and the Czar kept possession of all his conquests. In the year 1720, the kings of Sweden and Poland were re∣conciled.</P>
<P>Thus the crown of Sweden, from being the most absolute, became the most limited in Europe; and the estates recovered all their former power and privileges. Though they settled the succession upon the heirs male of the queen; yet they stipu∣lated, that no prince should ascend the throne, un∣til he should have attained the age of twenty-one, given his solemn assurance in the assembly of the estates, and taken the oaths which the law of Swe∣den prescribes. They even reserved to themselves the power of appointing governors and preceptors, to superintend the education of the prince destined to wield the sceptre of their government. In a word, the king of Sweden is no more than the first magistrate of the kingdom, restricted by the law, and depending on the diet. He can levy neither toll, tax, nor soldier; engage in war, conclude peace, nor pass the frontiers, without the know∣ledge and approbation of the states. All the great officers of the state are appointed by the diet. All considerable employments, whether ecclesiastical, civil, or military, are conferred by the king, with the approbation of the senate. The estates of Sweden are composed of deputies, that represent the four different orders; the nobility, clergy, burghers, and peasants. These are chosen by the different bodies, of which they are the represen∣tatives. With those of the nobility, consisting of one member out of every family, are associated the colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, and senior cap∣tain
<PB N="235" REF="2470"/>
of each regiment in the service. The clergy is represented by the bishops and superintendants, and one member from each rural deanery, or ten parishes, maintained at the charge of his electors. The representatives of the burghers are elected by the magistrates and council of every corporation. Stockholm, the capital, sends four members to the diet: other towns have the privilege of chusing two representatives each, and some can send one only. The peasants of each district elect a mem∣ber of their own order, whom they instruct with respect to the redress of grievances, and maintain during the session. The representatives of the no∣bility may amount in number to one thousand; those of the clergy to two hundred; the burghers to about one hundred and fifty; and the peasants to two hundred and fifty. They are assembled in consequence of the king's letters to the governors of provinces and the bishops. They meet in a large hall of the castle of Stockholm, where his majesty is seated on the throne. Here the secretary communicates the king's proposals, makes them acquainted with the state of affairs, and informs them of the occasion of their present meeting. To these propositions distinct answers are made by the marshal of the nobility, in behalf of that order; by the archbishop for the clergy, the first burgomaster of Stockholm for the burghers, and by one of the peasants for his brethren. The marshal of the diet, or speaker of the upper house, is chosen by the nobility; and every other order nominates its own orator. Then they separate into four different houses, and each order chuses a secret committee for dispatch of business, which, from time to time, receives directions and information from the mini∣stry. Every point in debate is decided by a ma∣jority in each house; and the four orders must be unanimous, otherwise the affair is left unfinished.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="2480"/>
The king's propositions being considered and discussed, each body or house presents a detail of its grievances, to which his majesty returns a par∣ticular answer, of which an authentic copy is deli∣vered to every member of the three inferior orders. This, together with a written account of the diet's resolutions, he carries home to his electors. Every order elects its own orator at the beginning of the session; and each is provided with a secretary, to record the transaction. Every deputy must be turned of four and twenty: during the session his person is sacred from arrest, unless he be discovered in the commission of some flagrant crime; and, even in that case, intimation must be immediately given to the diet. Any person who assaults and mal-treats a member, either in going to, or in re∣turning from the diet, is liable to be punished, as having committed a capital crime.</P>
<P>In consequence of the ordinance or constitution established in the year 1723, the diet is to assemble every three years in the month of January, or oftener, if they should be convoked by the king, with the advice of the senate; or if they them∣selves should have fixed a shorter day at their last sitting. If the king is either absent from the realm, indisposed, or deceased, or some other un∣foreseen event happens, in which the prosperity of the kingdom and the liberty of the estates are in∣terested, then the senate has a right to assemble the diet. If neither the king nor the senate should assemble the states by the usual time, and no writ of summons appears by the fifteenth day of No∣vember, in that case the governor of Stockholm, and the bailiffs of the provinces, must give notice that the diet may, by its own authority, assemble at Stockholm by the middle of January. Should the throne become vacant by the death of the reigning prince, this event must be forthwith com∣municated
<PB N="237" REF="2490"/>
to all concerned by the administrators of the higher house, the consistory of Upsal, and the magistrates of Stockholm: at the same time the bailiffs are obliged, under severe penalties, to send express notice of it through all parts of their respective bailiages, or governments, that a suffi∣cient number of deputies may be forthwith assem∣bled, for the immediate protection of the liberty of the kingdom, until the more distant members ar∣rive and complete the diet, which must imme∣diately deliberate upon a new election. In the mean time the senate must pitch upon some place, at a distance from Stockholm, where the foreign ministers and their families may reside during the election.</P>
<P>The estates of Sweden regulate every thing of importance that relates to the administration, and take cognizance of every circumstance in which the welfare and advantage of the community is interested. The session cannot continue longer than three months; but it may break up sooner, if all the different orders consent to the separation. In that case the marshal of the nobility, and the speakers of the other orders, wait upon the king, and desire he would convene and dismiss the dif∣ferent bodies that compose the diet. They are ac∣cordingly assembled before his majesty in the great hall of the estates, where, after the marshal and the other speakers have severally thanked him for his care and attention to the public weal, and pro∣mised to serve him with the most zealous and loyal affection, the resolutions of the diet are recited: then the king himself, or the president of the chancery in his name, signifies his majesty's appro∣bation of what has been concluded; promises the continuance of his favour to the estates, and of his care and attention for the advantage of his people;
<PB N="238" REF="2500"/>
and, finally, dismisses the diet, wishing all the de∣puties a happy return to their several habitations. Nevertheless, before they disperse, each order sends a deputation to take leave of the king and the royal family.</P>
<P>Next to the diet, the senate of Sweden deserves our consideration. The members of this venerable body are chosen in the following manner: the knights and nobility appoint a deputation of four and twenty individuals: twelve are sent by the clergy, and the like number by the burghers. These joining together, and taking an oath of se∣crecy, consult, deliberate, and pitch upon such a number of persons, that there shall be three pre∣sented, every way capable of, and qualified for fill∣ing the vacant seats of senators. These, being ap∣proved by the different orders of the diet, are recommended to the king, who, by his own au∣thority, fills the vacant seat with one of the three who have been thus presented. The senate is com∣posed of sixteen members, besides the chief go∣vernors of the provinces, including always the president of the chancery, and the grand marshal; and out of these are chosen the presidents of the courts of justice and colleges, as well as that of the grand governor. In the senate there must not be above two brothers, or two persons of the same family. In a word, the senate is the great council, by the help of which the king manages the reins of government. The senate not only acts as coun∣cil to his majesty, but also as a check upon the prerogative, and a resource to the people, who conceive themselves aggrieved by sentences pro∣nounced in different courts of judicature. It is the business of the senate to watch, to foresee, and prevent every intrigue or enterprize tending to the re-establishment of absolute monarchy, and the
<PB N="239" REF="2510"/>
diminution of the privileges enjoyed by the estates of the kingdom. Each senator is responsible to the diet, and obliged to give an account of his conduct, relating to every affair in which his ad∣vice or vote was given.</P>
<P>The presence of seven or more members constitutes a senate, for what is called the Revision of Justice. This comprehends their deliberations and resolu∣tions, touching every object that regards the service of the king and of the state, supposed to be insepar∣able. When the voices on each side are equal in the revision of justice, or when there is only a majority of two, the king casts the ballance by his accession to either party. When the king is absent, or so indis∣posed that he cannot as usual bear the burthen of the administration, the management of the helm de∣volves to the senate, in which every thing is carried by a plurality of voices; and, in case of equality, the casting vote is vested in the person of the oldest senator. The senate, in like manner, takes charge of the administration until the diet can be assem∣bled, when the throne becomes vacant by the death of the reigning prince, in case the succession be not previously settled. One half of the senate is always employed in the revision of sentences, the administration of justice, and the regulation of foreign affairs: the other half is occupied with matters of less importance.</P>
<P>Those senators who are presidents for life of the colleges, are obliged to attend daily in their respective offices for dispatch of business. The great governor regulates the whole police of the city of Stockholm: the president of the college of chancery, however, is exempted from sitting in that college: on the con∣trary, he is obliged to give his daily attendance in the senate. Such members also as do not sit in the revision of justice, or in the colleges, must attend in the senate, to take cognizance of all affairs pro∣posed
<PB N="240" REF="2520"/>
by the secretaries of state, of war, and of foreign affairs, in concurrence with his majesty: but in matters of great consequence, such as the maintenance of fortifications, the conclusion of a peace, truce, or alliance, preparations for war by land or by sea, the nomination to the chief offices of the state, the choice of deputies and ministers, and the regulation of the national finances; the king takes the advice of the whole senate, assem∣bled for these purposes. All offices of importance are conferred by the king, with the advice of the senate, or in consequence of a presentation from the different colleges, who enjoy this privilege: but, after all, there is a great deal of business left to the deliberation of the king himself, assisted by two senators, chosen in their turn for this purpose. These likewise attend the king in all his journeys and excursions: but neither the presidents of the chancery, the colleges, and the courts of justice, nor the grand governor of Stockholm, can be of this number.</P>
<P>For the more easy management of the adminis∣tration, and the more distinct dispatch of business, there are certain colleges established in Sweden, to act under the king's commission, with full power to summon, to command and govern all those that appertain to their respective departments, and to supply his majesty with all necessary informations. The first of these is the college of war, consisting of a president, a great master of the artillery, a quarter-master-general, four counsellors, in time of war, and two in peace, employed in making calcu∣lations, and settling accompts. This college ma∣nages the concerns of the army, the ordnance, forts, and garrisons, founderies, armouries, ammunition, the levies, reviews, and cloathing of regiments: but the payment of them is a province belonging to another office, under the inspection of the chamber
<PB N="241" REF="2530"/>
of finances. The college of admiralty, consisting of a president, with all the admirals and sea-com∣manders that are ashore, as his assessors, holds its sessions at Carlscrone, a town in the province of Blekinge, on the Baltic. This board regulates every thing relating to the navy; the building of ships and galliots, the levy, provision and pay of the mariners, the arms, cannon, and ammunition used in the sea-service. These expences are de∣frayed from the treasury of the admiralty, and the pay-office is accountable to the chamber of finances. The next college is the chancery of the kingdom, in which one of the senators always presides, with another member of the senate, a chancellor of the court, three secretaries of state, and four counsel∣lors of the chancery, for his assessors. In this col∣lege, all edicts, ordinances, and records concern∣ing the kingdom in general, and the particular privileges of certain towns or persons, their let∣ters patent, orders and instructions, are drawn up and expedited. To this board also belong the memorials and documents of diets and as∣semblies, alliances with foreign powers, treaties of peace; the presentation and instructions of en∣voys; and the care of giving audience to foreign ministers. Here are registered the resolutions taken by the king, with the advice of the senate, and here are issued all the acts that pass in the name and signature of his majesty. This college, more∣over, regulates all the posts throughout the king∣dom, and maintains them in good order under the inspection of a postmaster general. The business is divided into three different departments allotted to the three secretaries. One takes cognizance of foreign affairs: the province of another is war; and the third manages the interior business of the king∣dom. If any of these should be found acting ac∣cording to the king's private instructions, without
<PB N="242" REF="2540"/>
the concurrence of the senate, he would not only forfeit his place, but be punished with the utmost severity. No persons are admitted to places in the chancery, but such as have given unquestionable proofs of their understanding, diligence, and ca∣pacity.</P>
<P>The chamber of finances, composed of a presi∣dent and four ordinary counsellors, issues orders and directions to all those who have any concern with the revenue. It is likewise the province of this board to collect the revenues, and augment them occasionally; to encourage agriculture; to take especial care that the estates and demesnes, known by the name of <HI>Regalia Fisci,</HI> shall not be pillaged or neglected, but duly improved; that the public money shall be collected in good time, frugally managed, and faithfully applied; and that the public credit shall be punctually maintained. The customs, duties, and excise, are subjected to the care and management of directors appointed for that purpose, under the inspection of this cham∣ber, which may be denominated a board of trea∣sury. But it belongs to the State-office, another college, consisting of a president and two commis∣sioners, to issue out the public money for the dif∣ferent applications; to pay the several officers who receive their appointments from the treasury, and to keep a regular accompt of all these disburse∣ments. Here is reserved a certain sum, to be at the private disposal of his majesty, as well as an∣other sum, of which he may dispose, with the ad∣vice of the senate.</P>
<P>The college of the mines is constituted of a president, two counsellors, and four assessors, who, by their knowledge and experience, are not only enabled to perform the office of judges, but are likewise skilled in all the different branches of me∣tallurgy. This is a board of great importance,
<PB N="243" REF="2550"/>
inasmuch as upon the conduct of the miners the foreign trade of Sweden in a great measure de∣pends. Their province is to take every feasible step for the maintenance and improvement of the mining works of the kingdom; and they are au∣thorized to try and decide all causes that may be appealed to them from the inferior courts of the mines, the judges of which courts are under their immediate jurisdiction.</P>
<P>The college of commerce is composed of a pre∣sident, two counsellors of trade, four assessors per∣fectly well acquainted with all the branches of traf∣fick, and two commissioners. In all important af∣fairs, concerning commerce, this college is obliged, either directly, or by the intervention of the ma∣gistrates, to consult the principal burghers, traders, and manufacturers in all the great towns of the kingdom, before any resolution can be taken. The members of this board must take every neces∣sary step for extending the commerce of the king∣dom, for improving, establishing, and maintaining manufactures; and for the vigorous execution of all the regulations and ordinances touching the duties and customs which have been imposed by the diet.</P>
<P>All these colleges are obliged to produce before the diet, during every session, a complete detail of what has passed in their several departments; and all those who depend upon the colleges, such as the governors-general, the grand governor, the bai∣liffs, colonels, and others, must give an account of their conduct as often as it shall be required by their superiors.</P>
<P>The great marshal is a member of the senate, vested with the charge of every thing that concerns the court, the palace, and king's houshold. The grand governor's province is to have a watchful eye over the castle, and the king's houshold within
<PB N="244" REF="2560"/>
the walls of Stockholm; to join and assist the ma∣gistracy in governing the city and suburbs, in maintaining good order and police, in preserving the privileges, the public buildings, the revenues, and the trade of the capital; to defend the inha∣bitants against all violence and oppression; to take cognizance of the arms and discipline of the burghers, and carefully guard the regalia and jewels of the crown, which are kept at Stockholm: finally, he superintends the executions, and per∣forms every other function of a lieutenant of the police.</P>
<P>At present the provinces of Sweden are not sub∣jected either to general or particular governors; but parcelled out into a certain number of bai∣liages, according to the following order and divi∣sion. The first is the bailiage of Upland: the second is that of Roslagen, or Stockholm, com∣prehending Swartsio: then follow those of Swa∣bourg, of Abo and Biornebourg, of Cronoberg, of Jonkioping, of Westmaine and Stromsholm, of Wibourg and Nyslot, of Ostrogothie and Vad∣stena, of Sudermania, Gripsholm, and Eskilstuna, of Nyland and Tavastchus, of Elfsbourg, of Cal∣mar and Olande, of Kopparberg, of Nericia and Vermelande, of Western Norlande, of Western Bothnia, of Eastern Bothnia, of Gothland, of Malmo, of Christianstadt, of Blekynge, of Hal∣lande, of Gothembourg and Bohus.</P>
<P>In the present form of government established in Sweden, by the unanimous consent of the king, senate, and diet, it is laid down as a maxim, that no stranger, of any rank soever, shall for the future be employed in any office, either civil or military, within or without the kingdom; and that, as there is a greater number of nobles than the country can well maintain, his majesty shall not confer that dig∣nity, except, at his coronation, upon a few persons,
<PB N="245" REF="2570"/>
distinguished by their signal services to the com∣monwealth.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The General CHARACTER, MANNERS, and CUSTOMS of the SWEDES.</HEAD>
<P>The people of Sweden, from the severity of their air, the poorness of their food, and the bar∣renness of their country, are generally strong, hardy, patient of labour and fatigue; and, in all respects, well qualified to perform the duties of a military life; insomuch that the Swedes have, at many different aeras, been reputed the best soldiers in Christendom: yet, with all their courage and perseverance, they are slow and phlegmatic, and make a much better figure in the day of battle than in the conduct of a campaign. With respect to their mental faculties, they are said to be slow of comprehension, and of narrow capacity. They are very little troubled with the spirit of inquiry, and seldom amuse themselves in the regions of speculative philosophy. To this want of curiosity is originally owing that unanimity in religion, pro∣ductive of such happy consequences to the com∣monwealth. What the Swedes want in genius, they make up by an uncommon exertion of in∣dustry and application. Those that are employed in the administration have, by dint of indefatigable study, acquired a perfect knowledge of the busi∣ness in which they are engaged. The nation has pro∣duced many excellent statesmen, and some learned men; at the head of which class stand the cele∣brated Puffendorf, historian, civilian, and philo∣sopher; and of our days the famous Linnaeus, the prince of botanists, and one of the best natu∣ralists now alive. No country in Europe has been more productive than Sweden of great generals, both sovereigns and subjects. Gustavus Ericson,
<PB N="246" REF="2580"/>
Gustavus Adolphus, Charles Gustavus, and Charles XII. have left immortal monuments of military fame.</P>
<P>The nobility of Sweden are brave, hospitable, fond of glory, and scrupulously observant of the punctilios of honour: at the same it must be owned they are proud, ostentatious, jealous, and vindictive. The common people are quiet and industrious, sober, loyal, and religious; yet furious and ungovernable when intoxicated. They live in great poverty, and rudely practise several me∣chanical arts, which necessity teaches them to exer∣cise: for example, the peasants make their own shoes, cloaths, tools, and instruments of husbandry. The trading part of the nation plod on in a beaten track, without ingenuity to discover, or spirit to pursue, new branches of commerce; notwithstand∣ing all the care and encouragement bestowed by the legislature. They are said to be over-reaching, rapacious, envious, and extremely averse to fo∣reigners. Heretofore no person of family would condescend to exercise any of the learned profes∣sions, or even to take the command of a trading vessel: but these ridiculous prejudices are wearing out a-pace.</P>
<P>Marriages in Sweden are generally founded on mercenary motives of parents, without, in the least, consulting the inclinations of the parties themselves. The children of noble families are often turned of thirty before their marriage, be∣cause the parents are seldom in a condition to part with any part of their own fortunes in their life∣time. The women are generally fair, and well∣shaped, reputed more eminent for chastity before, than for fidelity after wedlock. They are very fruitful; and, from the highest to the lowest, kept by their husbands under such authority, as would be deemed oppression in France or England. The
<PB N="247" REF="2590"/>
meaner sort, besides the offices peculiar to their sex, stoop to all sorts of drudgery. They plow the fields, thresh the corn, row in boats, and carry burdens. In wedding, as well as in funeral enter∣tainments, the Swedes affect pomp and superfluity, and both are commonly attended with riot and ex∣cess. The Swedes are, in general, of a large sta∣ture, with white or yellow hair. Persons of fashion are dressed in the French mode: and the com∣monalty here, as in Denmark, wear cloaths made of coarse stuff, lined with sheep-skin, to screen them from the winter's cold. Their diversions are likewise the same with those of their neighbours, namely, skating, running races in sledges, and even sailing in yachts upon the ice; exercises which they perform with amazing swiftness and dexterity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>UNIVERSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Though learning has been but of little esteem among this warlike people, they have not been altogether without seminaries, even in antient times. The university at Upsal was instituted near four hundred years ago, and patronized by several suc∣cessive monarchs, particularly by the great Gusta∣vus Adolphus, and his daughter queen Christina, who piqued herself upon being the patroness of learning. It consists of a chancellor, a vice-chan∣cellor, a rector, and twenty professors, provided with comfortable salaries. The number of students used to amount to seven or eight hundred, fifty of whom are maintained by the king. There is an∣other university at Abo in Finland, but not so well endowed, nor so flourishing: and there was a third at Lunden in Schonen, which is now fallen into decay. Every diocese is provided with a free∣school, in which boys are qualified for she univer∣sity, as well as with inferior schools, where chil∣dren
<PB N="248" REF="2600"/>
are taught to read, write, and sing their prayers. But the provision for the poor in Swe∣den is very scanty: there are not above five or six hospitals in the whole kingdom, besides a little alms-house in each parish, maintained by the cha∣rity of the inhabitants.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The trade of Sweden depends chiefly on its mines, and its manufactures of iron, hard-ware, brass, and copper. These metals they export, both wrought and unwrought; together with great quantities of timber, masts, and deal-boards, pitch, tar, naval stores, and even ships ready built and rigged. They carry on with England a very con∣siderable traffick for some of these articles, which might be supplied as well from the British planta∣tions; and in that case the nation would save a very large ballance of money, which is now payed to Sweden. The parliament of England, aware of this disadvantage, has lately enacted a law, per∣mitting pig-iron to be imported duty free to any part of Great Britain, and even bar-iron to be im∣ported into London: but, notwithstanding this indulgence, the ballance of trade continues still greatly in favour of Sweden. This kingdom, in exchange for its own produce, receives cloths from England; sugars, wines, and silk from France; and spices from the Dutch; and manages its ad∣vantages so ill, that, upon the whole, the imports exceed the exports in value.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>STRENGTH.</HEAD>
<P>The kingdom of Sweden is in little or no dan∣ger from the power of the standing army, which, indeed, is no other than a well regulated militia, under the immediate command of freeholders,
<PB N="249" REF="2610"/>
whose interest is intimately connected with the liberty of their fellow-subjects. The cavalry is raised and maintained by the nobility and gentry, in proportion to the value of their estates, under such regulations, that neither man nor horse, after having been once listed in the service, can be put to any other employment but those specified in these regulations; and both must be kept, with proper arms and equipage, in continual readiness for service. The infantry is maintained at the ex∣pence of the yeomen. Every farm, amounting in value to seventy pounds sterling a year, is charged with one foot-soldier, who is either subsisted, cloathed with ordinary dress, and payed by the farmer, or lives with his family in a little wooden house, built by his landlord; who, moreover, cul∣tivates for him as much ground as will supply him with bread, and furnishes him with a sufficient quantity of hay and pasturage for the maintenance of one cow. The officers, both of the horse and infantry, live upon certain lands appropriated by the public for that purpose. Every officer is pro∣vided with a neat convenient house, situated in that part of the country where his regiment is quar∣tered, together with a competent portion of ground for his own use, and his pay arises from the rent of neighbouring farms; so that he receives it punc∣tually in money, corn, or other commodities, and lives upon the footing of a country gentleman. A colonel of infantry enjoys, in this manner, an estate of about three hundred pounds <HI>per annum;</HI> and the inferior officers are accommodated with pro∣portionable appointments. The uniform cloath∣ing of the troops is defrayed from the public trea∣sury. Every officer, upon his removal or promo∣tion, is obliged to leave his house and farm in as good condition as that in which he found it; and for this purpose he subscribes an inventory, when
<PB N="250" REF="2620"/>
he first takes possession. In time of peace the civil magistrate takes cognizance of all crimes and tres∣passes committed by the soldiery; but in camp and garrison they are subject to martial law. Every company is exercised once a month; and every regiment reviewed twice or thrice in a year: on these occasions only they wear the king's cloaths, which, when the service is over, are carefully depo∣sited in the churches. Thus the army is part of the constitution: the officers are landholders, and generally men of good families. They and their soldiers derive their property from the constitution, which therefore they will the more zealously defend against all the incroachments of arbitrary power, and sinister influence.</P>
<P>The land-forces of Sweden may amount to about forty thousand men, horse and foot. For maimed, infirm, and superannuated soldiers, there is one general hospital, well endowed; the reve∣nue of which is considerably reinforced by a cer∣tain gratuity paid to it by every officer, when he is promoted in the service.</P>
<P>The Swedish navy consists of forty sail of the line of battle; but neither ships nor docks are kept in proper order and repair.</P>
<P>Besides the arms constantly used by the soldiery, there is a considerable magazine at Stockholm, and another in the castle of Jencoping, near the frontiers of Denmark. These are supplied from a considerable iron-work at Oerbro in Nericia. In this castle too, which is one of the few inland for∣tresses of Sweden, there is a fine train of artillery, kept always ready for service. On the borders of Norway there are some small forts, that defend the passes of the mountains. The city of Gotten∣burgh, the town of Maerstrand, and the castle of Elfsburg, are tolerably well fortified. Waerburgh, Helmstadt, Landscrone, and Malmo, near the Da∣nish
<PB N="251" REF="2630"/>
borders, are places of good defence; as are Carlescrone and Calmar on the Baltic, with two small forts at the entrance of the river leading to Stockholm.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUE, and COIN.</HEAD>
<P>The revenue of Sweden, arising from crown∣lands, poll-money, tythes, silver, copper, and iron∣mines, proceedings at law, and other more incon∣siderable articles, formerly amounted to a million sterling yearly. Of this about one third was de∣rived from the produce of the lands, and almost one fourth from the customs. The poll-tax is imposed on the peasants only: every individual of that class above sixteen, and under sixty, pays about twelve pence a year. The revenue of Swe∣den has been considerably lessened by the unfor∣tunate events of the war maintained by Charles XII. as well as of that which was lately carried on against Russia. Nevertheless, the expences of the state have been diminished in the same pro∣portion; and while the finances are regularly and frugally managed, they will be found sufficient to maintain the government in a respectable condi∣tion, without any reinforcement of foreign subsi∣dies.</P>
<P>The current coin of Sweden consists of gold ducats, eight-mark pieces of silver, valued each at five shillings and two pence; four-mark pieces, and copper coins of different size and value: some of these are as large as tiles, and, when payments are made in this species, the merchant is often obliged to receive them in a cart or wheel-barrow.</P>

<HEAD>INTEREST and POLITICKS of SWEDEN.</HEAD>
<P>It is undoubtedly the interest of Sweden to live on terms of friendship with all her neighbours; to improve her internal advantages, extend her trade, and cultivate a good understanding with the Mari∣time Powers, which, by sending squadrons into the Baltic, are always able to defend her from the designs of Russia, her nearest and most formidable rival. This, however, is not the plan which has been lately pursued in that kingdom. By the in∣fluence and intrigues of count Gyllembourg, and his successor count Tessin, the French party pre∣vailed in Sweden.</P>
<P>In the year 1739, a French squadron arrived at Stockholm, under the command of the duc d'An∣tin. <Q>Being favoured with an audience, the king presented him with his own sword, saying, “This, Sir, I give you with the greater pleasure, as I am certain you will draw it on all occasions for our defence; and I and my subjects will draw our swords for the interest and glory of France.”</Q></P>
<P>The design of the French ministry was to insti∣gate the Swedes against Russia: for this purpose they employed all the arts which that crown has so long practised, as the common disturber of Eu∣rope, to embroil one nation with another. They, by their emissaries, soothed, flattered, promised, and inflamed. They scattered gold among the ministers, and granted subsidies to the crown. Their endeavours at length produced an universal clamour against Russia, and the nation ran head∣long into a war, which was unfortunate and inglo∣rious. All the country of Finland was lost, and the greater part of their army taken prisoners, by an enemy whom, in former times, they had so often defeated.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="2650"/>
In the midst of these disasters the diet resolved to settle the succession, as the reigning king had no issue. The duke of Holstein-Gottorp, prince Frederick of Hesse-Cassel, nephew to the king, the prince of Denmark, and the duke of Deux∣points, were the four competitors. After warm debates, the duke of Holstein was declared suc∣cessor by a majority of two votes only. But this prince had already embraced the Greek religion, with a view to the throne of Russia; the succession to which was settled upon him accordingly. He promised, however, to resign his pretensions to the crown of Sweden in favour of his uncle prince Adolphus Frederick, administrator of Holstein and bishop of Lubeck. In consequence of this pro∣posal, the conferences for peace, which had been interrupted, were renewed at Abo, under the me∣diation of his Britannic majesty. By the treaty of peace, which was in a little time concluded, Russia consented to restore all the conquests she had made, except a small district in Finland; and duke Adol∣phus was declared hereditary prince, and successor to the crown of Sweden. The peasants of Dale∣karlia took arms, and rebelled against this dispo∣sition; but they were defeated and disarmed. The king of Denmark took umbrage at his son's being excluded from the succession, and began to make preparations of war, as if he had intended by force of arms to overthrow the late established succession in Sweden; but the Czarina giving him to under∣stand, that she would maintain it with all her power, he thought proper to desist. The prince successor espoused the princess Louisa Ulrica, sister to the king of Prussia, with whom Sweden concluded a treaty, to which the court of France acceded. Count Gyllembourg and count Teslin soon gained the ascendant over the mind of the successor; and the French interest still triumphed at Stockholm,
<PB N="254" REF="2660"/>
to the manifest dissatisfaction of the Czarina, and other powers, who endeavoured, though in vain, to detach him from that system of politicks. The old king, who had been for some time passive in the adminisiration, dying in the year 1751, the successor ascended the throne without opposition, and immediately established a good understanding with the empress of Russia. Since that period a strange revolution happened in the politicks of Europe. The rival houses of Austria and Bourbon united, during the late war, with the Czarina in al∣liances offensive and defensive against the king of Prussia; and the French interest in Sweden, being thus reinforced, hurried that nation into the confe∣deracy, even though their sovereign is said to have been averse to a rupture with his brother-in-law. The Swedes, however, met with very indifferent success in their military efforts against his Prussian majesty; and as they had never entered heartily into the war, readily acceded to the emperor of Russia's proposal for a pacification with that monarch, in 1762. Since the conclusion of this treaty, they have applied themselves with great diligence to the cultivation of a new discovered fishery on their coasts.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE PARTICULAR PARTS That compose the KINGDOM OF SWEDEN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS kingdom is constituted of Sweden, properly so called, Gothland, Livonia, In∣gria, Finland, Lapland, and divers islands in the Baltic. Sweden, properly so called, is bounded on the south by Gothland, on the north by Lap∣land, on the east by the gulph of Bothnia, and on the west by the Norwegian mountains. It is sub∣divided into eleven parts, namely, Uplandia, Su∣dermania, Westmania, Nericia, Gestricia, Hel∣singia, Dalekarlia, Midelpadia, Angermania, Jemp∣tia, and West Bothnia.</P>
<P>Upland, or Uplandia, extends about seventy∣five miles from north to south, between the Baltic and Gestricia; from which last province it is sepa∣rated by the river Dala. From east to west it stretches above sixty miles, betwixt the Baltic and the province of Westmania. The country is fer∣tile, producing excellent wheat; and here are found mines of iron, lead, and silver; but this last in small quantity. The capital of this province, and indeed of the whole kingdom, is Stockholm, in Latin <HI>Holmia,</HI> which derives its name from <HI>Stock,</HI> wood, and <HI>holm,</HI> and island, alluding to the timber used in building the city. It is situated on a cluster of small islands, and the houses are founded upon
<PB N="256" REF="2680"/>
piles. Including the two suburbs, one of which stands on the peninsula of Toren, and the other in Athundria, the town is as large and populous as Bristol. Here the king usually resides; and here the estates always assemble. The island on which the greatest part of Stockholm stands, is sur∣rounded by two branches of a river, that runs with great rapidity out of the lake Maeler; and over each of these arms there is a wooden bridge: from the city the eye is regaled with the prospect of the lake on one side, and the sea on the other. The sea-water is here potable, the freshness being owing to the great quantity which the lake discharges. The castle, or palace, is a spacious building, with∣out taste or magnificence, furnishing lodging-room not only to the royal family, but likewise to the greater part of the officers belonging to the house∣hold. It likewise comprehends the national or supreme court of justice, the colleges of war, chancery, treasury, and commerce; a chapel, ar∣moury, library, and office for the public records: but the greater number of inferior officers and servants belonging to the court are, with the foot∣guards, quartered on the burghers. The castle, and all the stately edifices in the kingdom, are covered with copper. The palace of the nobility, in which this order sits during the session of the diet, is an elegant building, adorned on the out∣side with marble statues and columns, and on the inside with painting and sculpture. This and three other palaces stand on the banks of the lake, and are built on the same model, so as to compose an uniform piece of architecture. The bank, built at the expence of the city, is a noble edifice, and joins with many sumptuous houses, belonging to the nobility, in exhibiting a splendid appearance. The houses of the burghers are generally built of brick in the city; but in the suburbs they are
<PB N="257" REF="2690"/>
commonly made up of timber, and therefore very subject to conflagrations. These houses are often framed in Finland, according to the plan and di∣mensions prescribed: from thence they are trans∣ported in pieces to Stockholm by water, and there set up by the carpenters. These wooden habita∣tions, if kept in proper repair, will last thirty or forty years, and are deemed warmer, neater, and more healthy than those of brick or stone. To prevent the danger of conflagrations, the city is divided into twelve wards. In each of these there is a master and four assistants, who forthwith re∣pair to the place where the fire breaks out; and all porters and labourers are obliged to range them∣selves under the master of the ward to which they belong. A fire-watch patroles the streets by night, to give warning or assistance, as it may be wanted; and a centinel is maintained in the steeple of every church, to toll the bell on the first appearance of any such accident. The police of Stockholm is intirely subjected to the regulations of the grand governor, assisted by a deputy and bailiff of the castle. There is an inferior jurisdiction, composed of four burgomasters, who sit with the counsellors of the city, to take care that justice shall be duly administered; to take cognizance of every thing relating to the commerce, the police, and the pub∣lic as well as private buildings of the city. These receive salaries from the revenues of Stockholm, which likewise pays all its own officers and ser∣vants, keeps all the public edifices in repair, and maintains a guard of three hundred musquereers. These expences are defrayed by a duty on all mer∣chandize imported and exported, and a yearly tax upon the burghers, imposed by the magistrates and common council. This city is the staple of Sweden, to which all the commodities of the king∣dom are brought for exportation, and where almost
<PB N="258" REF="2700"/>
all the imports from abroad are deposited. The port or haven formed by the lake Maeler, is large enough to contain a thousand sail of shipping, and furnished with a key or wharf about an English mile in length, to which the vessels may lie with their broadsides. The greatest inconveniency at∣tending this situation is the distance from the sea, which is not within less than ten miles of the town, the want of tides, and winding of the river, which is remarkably crooked. It opens into the Baltic; and the entrance, which is dangerous and rocky, the Swedes have secured with two small forts: within it is perfectly safe and commodious. The northern suburbs are remarkable for the king's gardens, and for the great number of artisans who have chosen their habitations in this quarter. In the southern suburbs the Muscovite commodities are sold; and here is a magnificent exchange, where the merchants daily assemble. The two warlike monarchs, Gustavus Adolphus and Charles Gustavus, are buried in chapels belonging to the church of Redderholm, which formerly belonged to the Cordeliers, and is still known by the name of Clooster-kirk.</P>
<P>Upsal, in Latin <HI>Upsalia,</HI> stands on the banks of the river Sala, about two and forty miles to the north-west of Stockholm. It is a very antient city, heretofore capital of the kingdom, where the so∣vereigns usually resided. The town, which is large, stands upon both sides of the river, which is pretty broad, and so hard frozen in the winter, that an annual fair is kept upon the ice in the month of February. The place is but indifferently fortified; but the cathedral is the most magnificent church in the whole kingdom, covered with copper, and adorned with several royal monuments. The castle stands on a hill that commands the city. It is tolerably fortified, very spacious, and elegantly
<PB N="259" REF="2710"/>
built in the Italian manner. Upsal was erected into a metropolitan see by pope Eugenius III. and the Roman catholic prelates of this archbishopric lived in great splendour, never stirring abroad without a retinue of five hundred horse. It was in the castle of Upsal that queen Christina abdi∣cated the crown in the year 1654; and here Gus∣tavus I. assembled the estates, in order to abolish the Roman catholic religion. The university of this city has been already described. The other towns of note in Upland are these: Engkoping, in Latin <HI>Encopia,</HI> a place of some trade, on the lake Maeler, about five and twenty miles to the westward of Stockholm; Osthammar, Oregrund, Elfkarlby, Salstad, Sigtuna, Norr-talge, and Ro∣torbo.</P>
<P>Sudermania, separated from Upland on the north by the lake Maeler, bounded on the south by East Gothland, on the west by Nericia, and by the Baltic on the east, is a populous country, ex∣tending sixty miles in length, and forty-five in breadth, fruitful in corn, mines, and timber; of which last many ships are built in this province. It is commonly subdivided into Sudermania, pro∣perly so called, and the island of Foren, formed by the lake Maeler, and Rekarne. The principal towns are Nicoping, or Nicopia, the capital, stand∣ing on the shore of the Baltic, eight and forty miles to the southward of Stockholm, a place of some trade, with a commodious harbour, and a castle, in which the dukes of Sudermania used to reside; Strengness, in Latin <HI>Strengnesia,</HI> a small town on the south side of the lake Maeler, the see of a bishop, suffragan to the metropolitan of Up∣sal. That the place is very antient appears from some Gothic inscriptions, found upon large stones in the Runic character, importing, That heathen idols had been worshipped on that spot, which
<PB N="260" REF="2720"/>
was likewise the scene on which the warriors and wrestlers of old exhibited proofs of their courage, strength, and dexterity. King Charles IX. lies buried in the cathedral, which is an antient Gothic edifice. Opposite to the town an annual fair is held upon the ice, when the lake Maeler is frozen. Tresen, or Trosa, situated on the Baltic, about forty miles from Stockholm, having the advantage of a good harbour: Telgen, or Soder-telga, a place of considerable commerce on the southern side of the lake Maeler, at the distance of twenty miles from Stockholm; and Torsilia, on the same side of the lake, about eighteen miles to the west∣ward of Strengness.</P>
<P>The province of Westmania, or Westmanland, lying between Upland, Wermeland, Dalekarlia, part of Nericia, and part of Sudermania, is a bar∣ren country, stretching about ninety miles in length from south-east to north-west, and about threescore miles in breadth from south to north. It was formerly considerable for its silver mines, which are now exhausted, or disused. The capital town of this province is Arosen, or Westeras, in Latin <HI>Arosia,</HI> or <HI>Vesterasium,</HI> situated on the side of the lake Maeler, between Koping and Enkoping, about thirty-five miles from Stockholm. It is a bishop's see, rendered considerable by its castle as well as by its situation. Here was concluded the hereditary union or convention in the year 1544, by which the hereditary succession to the crown of Sweden was settled in the family of Gustavus Vasa. Before this event the Danes had taken possession of the castle; but that great prince, at the head of the Dalekarlians, defeated their army in this neigh∣bourhood, and retook the fortress. Some other inscriptions are found in the cathedral of Arosen. Among the other towns of this province we num∣ber Arbogen, in Latin <HI>Arbogia,</HI> on the little river
<PB N="261" REF="2730"/>
Arbou, which falls into the lake Maeler, situated above sixty miles to the westward of Stockholm. Koping, a small town between Arosen and Ar∣bogen, in the neighbourhood of which there are good mines of iron and copper: Nora, another small town, eight and twenty miles to the west∣ward of Arbogen; and Lindeszas, an inconsider∣able place, built on the side of a rivulet, which loses itself in the lake Maeler. This town stands to the eastward of the mountains, famous for the mines of Lindenberg.</P>
<P>The district of Nericia, bounded on the north by Westmania, on the east by Sudermania, on the south by East Gothland and the northern extremity of the lake Vetter, and on the west partly by West Gothland, and partly by Wermeland, is remark∣able for several large lakes and rivers; of which last the Trosa divides the country in two parts from west to east. Some silver mines have been for∣merly dug in this province; but at present the in∣habitants work none but those of iron, alum, and sulphur. The chief town is Orebro, in Latin <HI>Ore∣brogia,</HI> built on the banks of the Trosa, which here falls into the lake Hielmer, otherwise called the Yelmer Sea, about twenty miles to the south∣west of Arbogen. The other places of any con∣sequence are Askersund, on the northern extre∣mity of the lake Vetter; Hillmersberg, on the lake Hielmer; and Glanshammer: these three are little towns of small importance.</P>
<P>The division of Gestricia, lying between the little river Tynea, the gulph of Bothnia, the river Dala, and Dalekarlia, is a barren country; yet productive of iron mines, and divided into two equal parts by the river Hasunda. The chief town is Gevalia, or Gafle, at the mouth of that river, which forms a gulph that serves as a harbour, by means of which the place enjoys a tolerable share
<PB N="262" REF="2740"/>
of trade. The other places of this province are Borna and Coperberget.</P>
<P>One of the most extensive provinces of Sweden is Helsingia, or Helsingland, bounded on the north by Jemptia and Medelpadia, on the west and south∣west by Dalekarlia, on the south by Gestricia, and on the east by the gulph of Bothnia. The country is covered with mountains and forests, and the in∣habitants employ themselves chiefly in hunting and fishing. The length of the province amounts to one hundred and thirty-seven miles from south∣east to north-west, and the breadth to seventy and eight. It is divided lengthways by the river Lius∣na, which receives the Woxna a little before it dis∣embogues itself into the gulph of Bothnia. The course of the river Ecksund is a little more norther∣ly. The capital, Hudwickswald, in Latin <HI>Huding∣sualdia,</HI> stands on the side of the Bothnic gulph, near the mouth of the river Ecksund, between the islands of Agan and Balsoon, and carries on a con∣siderable traffick in timber, pitch, rosin, corn and hides. Soderhamn, near the mouth of the Liusna, is provided with a good haven. The other towns of Hien, Swegh, Korbole, and Lusdal, are either situated on the same river, or in its neighbour∣hood; but Alta is an inland town, twenty miles to the westward of Soderhamn.</P>
<P>The province of Dalekarlia stretches one hun∣dred and sixty-five miles in length, and one hun∣dred in breadth, having for its confines the Nor∣wegian mountains on the west and north, Helsingia and Gestricia on the east, and on the south Wes∣termania and Wermeland. It is divided into three valleys, and, in lieu of towns, can only boast of a few indifferent villages. It is covered with moun∣tains, which abound with mines of iron and cop∣per, and some of these are incredibly deep. Here∣tofore the inhabitants of Dalekarlia were remark∣able
<PB N="263" REF="2750"/>
for their courage, ferocity, and spirit of inde∣pendance. Almost all the revolutions of Sweden have begun or ended in this province. Gustavus Vasa, having escaped from his confinement at Co∣penhagen, retired to Dalekarlia, encouraged and persuaded those highlanders to take arms and shake off the Danish yoke. By dint of their valour, and his own conduct, he freed his country from the tyranny of Christiern II. and having mounted the throne of Sweden, established the succession in his own family. The chief villages are these: Idra, situated on the river Elsinam, one of the sources of the Dala, which runs into the Silian lake; Lima, six and thirty miles farther south; and Hedemora, built on the river Dala, near the confines of Westermania, about forty miles from Upsal.</P>
<P>Medelpadia, a mountainous country, covered with forests, lying between the Bothnic gulph, Angermania, Jempterland, and Helsingia, is wa∣tered by the three rivers, of which Indal and Nesa∣rund are the most considerable. At the mouth of this last stands the capital, Sundswald, the harbour of which is pretty commodious: to the southward is a rocky coast, extending forty miles. In this province are the sea-ports of Hasio on the Indal, and Nirunda on the Nisarund: Trop and Tuna stand higher up on the same river. Tors, Indal, and Carlobec, are situated on the river Indal; and on the coast are the towns of Anas, Sion, and Guarp.</P>
<P>Angermania, bounded on the north by West Bothnia and Lapland, by the gulph of Bothnia on the east, by Medelpadia on the south, and on the west by Jempterland, is an extent of about ninety miles square, watered by the river Angerman∣flodt. The country is mountainous, woody, and of course thinly inhabited. The only towns of
<PB N="264" REF="2760"/>
note in this district are Hernosand and Natra: the former stands on the Bothnic gulph, and, having the advantage of a good harbour, enjoys a small share of commerce: Natra is situated in a bay of the same gulph, about five and forty miles more northerly.</P>
<P>The province of Jemptia, or Jempterland, one of the most northerly in Sweden, is a wild coun∣try, watered by the Indal, which forms a large lake in the middle of the province, and runs into Medelpadia, and the Hamerdal, that runs from north-west to south-east, and enters Angermania. Here are no cities or towns of any consideration. There is a fortress at Ressund, about threescore miles to the westward of Hernosand; and the chief village, called Lida, stands about twenty miles further to the northward.</P>
<P>West Bothnia, lying along the northern side of the Bothnic gulph, bounded on the south by An∣germania, and on the west and north by Swedish Lapland, is pretty well peopled, abounds with vil∣lages, and is watered by the Lapland rivers Uma, Skelefta, Pitha, Lula, Rana, Torno, and Rimi, which discharge themselves into the gulph, and give names to the towns situated at their respective mouths. Torno stands at the bottom of the gulph, near the confines of Lapland, has a good harbour, and is a place of some trade.</P>
<P>The second division of Sweden, called Gothia, or Gothland, comprehends East Gothland, West Gothland, and South Gothland: East Gothland in∣cludes the country properly so called, Smaland, and the island of Oeland. East Gothland is bounded on the north by Sudermania, on the east by the Baltic, on the south by Smaland, and on the west by the lake Vetter. The country is flat and fertile, producing plenty of corn, cattle, fish, fowl, and venison. The chief town, Norkoping,
<PB N="265" REF="2770"/>
or Norcopia, signifying the northern market, stands about seventy-five miles to the southward of Stock∣holm, on the bank of a large rivulet, which, run∣ning from the lake Vetter, falls into the gulph of Brawiken. The town is large, and pretty po∣pulous; and the inhabitants carry on a tolerable trade in the way of a salmon-fishery. The second town of this district is Sudercopia, or Suderkoping, standing at the bottom of an arm of the sea, about sixteen miles west from the shore of the Baltic: though destitute of walls or fortifications, it enjoys some degree of trade; and some curious chrystal stones are found in the neighbourhood. About ten miles to the eastward stands Stegeburg, on the shore of the Baltic; a small town, with a conve∣nient harbour, from which it derives some com∣merce. Wastena, or Vadsten, is situated on the eastern bank of the lake Vetter, five and twenty miles to the westward of Norkoping, remarkable for nothing but the ruins of a royal palace.</P>
<P>Smaland, or Smalandia, lying between East Gothland, the Baltic, Bleking, and Halland, stretches about one hundred and twenty miles from east to west, being about seventy-five miles in breadth. It abounds in wood and cattle, in mines of copper, lead, and iron. The capital, Calmar, is a considerable city, about one hundred and sixty miles to the southward of Stockholm, built upon a streight of the Baltic called Calmar∣sand, opposite to the isle of Oeland. The old city, famous for the union of Calmar, by which the three northern crowns were fixed on the head of queen Margaret, was often taken and pillaged; and, finally, burned to the ground in the year 1547. After this misfortune the new city was built in the little island of Owernholm, upon a large, spacious, and uniform plan. The streets are broad and streight, and the houses well-built: nevertheless,
<PB N="266" REF="2780"/>
the place is far from being populous. Though the fortifications are out slender, the town is ren∣dered strong by its situation; surrounded on the the land-side by morasses and canals, and towards the sea with dangerous rocks and intermediate whirlpools; except along the mole, which is built of stone, and defended by the fortress of Grim∣skar, founded on a rock, and secured with a good garrison. Behind the old town stands the castle, strongly fortified, and of difficult access. Calmar is a town of considerable trade, and the pass from Sweden into Germany. Here at present resides a superintendant for the government of the clergy. The other towns of this district are Wexco, or Vexca; Westerwick, or Vestrovicum; Ekesio, or Ekesium; and Jenekoping, or Jenecopia. Wexco is a bishop's see, on the banks of the lake Salen, about five and forty miles to the north-west of Cal∣mar. Westerwick is a sea-port town of consider∣able trade on the Baltic, about seventy miles to the northward of Calmar. Ekesio stands five and forty miles to the west of Calmar. Jenekoping is situated on the lake Vetter, sixty miles to the north-west of Calmar: it enjoys some trade, and is defended by a citadel. Oeland shall be described in our ac∣count of the isles belonging to Sweden.</P>
<P>The province of West Gothland Proper, is bounded on the south-east by Smaland, on the south-west by Halland, on the north-west by the river Gothelba and the province of Dulia, on the north by the lake Wenner and part of Vermeland, and on the east by part of Nericia and the lake Vetter, that divides it from East Gothland. This extensive province is well watered with lakes and rivers; abounds with excellent pastures, in which the inhabitants breed numerous herds of black cattle, and are enriched by the sale of this com∣modity. The capital, Gottenburg, in Latin <HI>Gothe∣burgum,</HI>
<PB N="267" REF="2790"/>
is situated in the Schager-rack, or Cate∣gate, on the south branch of the river Gothelba, which here falls into the sea, forming a commo∣dious harbour for the city. Gottenburg was built in the year 1607, under the reign of Charles IX. whose successors indulged it with many extraordi∣nary privileges, in consequence of which it is be∣come a place of considerable commerce. In the year 1644, the Danes exerted their utmost endea∣vours for the destruction of this city, which, how∣ever, they could not reduce. At present it is one of the strongest maritime towns in the kingdom. Skaren, or Skara, a bishop's see, above fourscore miles to the north-west of Gottenburg, was the seat of the antient kings of Sweden. The ruins of their palace are still to be seen, and, if we may judge from the situation, the walls, and the struc∣ture, it appears to have been one of the most stately edifices in all Europe. In the neighbourhood of this antient palace stands the mountain Kenda∣kulle, remarkable for its height and fertility. It is covered with a variety of trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants, which not only afford a delightful pro∣spect to the eye, but likewise yield food and shelter to an infinite number of birds, that in the sum∣mer incessantly warble among these delicious groves. Skara, though once the metropolis of West Goth∣land, is now a poor inconsiderable town, open and defenceless. Fifteen miles to the north-west of this place stands Lidkoping, called in Latin <HI>Lidae∣forum,</HI> at the mouth of the river Lida, where it falls into the lake Wenner. The other towns of this province are Falcoping, situated on the bank of a small lake, which empties itself into the river Lida; and Mariestadt, founded by Mary-Anne, consort to king Charles IX. on the eastern bank of the lake Wenner: but all these places are at present poor and inconsiderable.</P>

The district of Wermeland, or Vermelandia, having for its boundaries Dalekarlia on the north, Westermania and Nericia on the east, the lake Wenner on the south, and on the west Norway, with part of Dalia; extends about one hundred and forty-four miles from north to south, and near one hundred in breadth, abounds with lakes and marshes, is thinly peopled, produces some mines of iron, and one of copper. The chief towns are Carlostad, built by Charles IX. in the place where stood the antient city of Tingivalla, on the northern bank of the lake Wenner, about one hundred and twenty miles west from Stockholm; Philipstad, five and twenty miles to the north-east of Carlostad, a place of difficult access, situated amongst brooks and morasses; and Ruscoy, about the same distance from Philipstad to the southward.</P>
<P>Dalia, or Daal, a small province, bounded by the lake Wenner on the east, West Gothland Pro∣per on the south-east, by the government of Bahus and part of Aggerhus on the west and north-west, and by Wermeland on the north-east, stretches from north to south about fourscore miles, and not above four and twenty in breadth from east to west. The country is barren and mountainous, abounding with lakes and rivers, that fall into the lake Wenner; but affords good pasture for cattle, which are of a larger breed here than in any other part of Sweden. The most noted towns are Dale∣burg and Tweta: the first on the western bank of the Wenner; the other situated on the same lake, but thirty miles farther north.</P>
<P>South Gothland is surrounded every where by the sea, except on the north, where it is bounded by East and West Gothland: it is subdivided into the three districts of Halland, Schonen, and Ble∣kinge. Halland, lying between Schonen, the two Gothlands, and the sea of Denmark, extends a sea∣coast
<PB N="269" REF="2810"/>
of about seventy-five miles, though the breadth does not exceed two and twenty. This country, which is pleasant and fertile, formerly belonged to Denmark; but, in the year 1645, was mortgaged to Sweden as a security for the free passage of the Sound, and afterwards yielded to that kingdom for ever by the treaty of Roschild. Helmstad, or Hilmostadium, the capital of the province, standing upon the Categate, has the ad∣vantage of a good harbour; in consequence of which it enjoys a considerable trade. The other towns of this district are Laholm, at the mouth of the river Laga, a small place, with a good harbour and a citadel; Tralkenberg, another inconsiderable town, situated at the mouth of a large river, from which it derives its name, a sea-port of some trade, defended by a castle; and Warberg, a petty place, about seven and twenty miles to the north of Helm∣stad, provided with a large harbour, and secured by a strong castle.</P>
<P>Schonen, in Latin <HI>Scania,</HI> a peninsula, separated by the Sound from Zealand, is bounded on the north by Halland and Smaland, on the east and south by Blekinge and the Baltic. This province, extending about eighty miles in length, and sixty in breadth, is the most southern and the most fruit∣ful country in Sweden, abounding with mines of silver, lead, and iron, corn, cattle, and all the conveniences of life. It formerly belonged to Denmark; but was finally annexed to Sweden by a treaty, concluded in the year 1679. Since that period, however, Schonen has been often the theatre of war, kindled among the powers of the North. The capital city, Lunden, called in Latin <HI>Lundinum, Scoenorum,</HI> stands at some distance from the sea-shore, about four and twenty miles to the eastward of Copenhagen. It was formerly an arch∣bishop's see, and the seat of an university, at which
<PB N="270" REF="2820"/>
the celebrated Samuel Puffendorf was educated: but the metropolitan dignity was removed to Co∣penhagen, and the university suppressed. The city was once large and considerable, adorned with two and twenty churches. The cathedral of St. Laurence, which still remains, is a magnificent structure, remarkable for a very lofty spire, that serves as a land-mark to sailors, and for a curious clock, said to have been contrived by Caspar Bar∣tholinus. This machine not only exhibits the hour, day, month, year, and festivals; but is so artfully constructed, that when the hour revolves, two figures of armed men on horseback come forth, and, encountring each other, give as many blows as the hammer is to strike on the bell: then a door opening, discovers the Virgin Mary sitting on a throne, with Christ in her arms, and the wise men paying their homage to him, while two trum∣peters sound a note of triumph. In the neigh∣bourhood of this city we observe the hill on which, in antient times, the kings used to be elected. Malmoe, or, as the Dutch term it, Ellebogen, is a small but populous town, situated on the Sound, and enjoying a considerable share of commerce. Landskroon, in Latin <HI>Coronea,</HI> standing likewise on the Sound, is a strong well fortified town, with a commodious harbour, productive of commerce. The castle is a place of great strength and impor∣tance. It was in this neighbourhood that Chris∣tiern V. of Denmark was defeated in a pitched battle by Charles XI. of Sweden, in the year 1677. Elsingburg, or Helsingburgum, is situated also on the shore of the Sound, opposite to Croonenburg in Zealand. It is a place of considerable trade, and was formerly fortified; but no part of its for∣tifications now remain, except an old castle, with a square high tower, that serves as a direction for mariners</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="2830"/>
The province of Blekinge, lying between Sma∣land, Schonen, and the Baltic, stretching above fourscore miles in length from east to west, and fifty at its broadest part; is mountainous, woody, and barren, though watered by several rivers. The southern coast is rendered very diffi∣cult and dangerous, by a great number of rocks and islands. The principal towns of this province are Christianstadt, Christianople, Ahuys, Carl∣scroon, and Carsholmn. Christianstadt is situated in the midst of morasses, on the banks of a river that falls into the Baltic at Ahuys, at the distance of eight miles from the sea. This place, though strong by its situation, has been several times taken in the course of wars with Denmark. Christian∣ople, at the eastern point of this province, was once the capital, and enjoyed the advantage of a good harbour; but Charles XI. levelled it with the ground. Ahuys, or Ahausen, stands on the Baltic, at the mouth of the river Hellean, having a safe capacious, and much frequented harbour. Carlscroon, or Caroli Corona, was built by Charles XI. on a little island, which a long bridge joins to the continent. The town, which covers the whole island, stands about five and forty miles to the east of Ahuys, and enjoys an excellent harbour, well fortified, in which a considerable part of the royal navy commonly rides secure. Carsholmn is a sea-port town, between Carlscroon and Ahuys.</P>
<P>The third great division of Sweden is Livonia, or Leifland, bounded on the north by the gulph of Finland, on the west by that part of the Baltic called the gulph of Riga, on the east by Muscovy and Ingria, on the south by the dutchy of Cour∣land and some part of Lithuania. This province is extremely well situated for commerce, being surrounded on the west and north by the sea, on the east by the great lake of Pepus, and on the
<PB N="272" REF="2840"/>
south by the river Dwina, which, taking its rise in Muscovy, passes by the confines of Livonia, di∣viding it from Courland; and then falls into the gulph of Livonia at Dunemund. There are, be∣sides, three lakes, and many small rivers, which, by affording water-carriage, greatly favour and fa∣cilitate the commerce of the country. The length of Livonia, from north to south, extends to one hundred and fifty miles; the breadth to one hun∣dred and ten. This province, though in many places marshy, is nevertheless fruitful, producing corn, pasture, and honey in abundance.</P>
<P>In the twelfth century the Livonians were wild, savage, and involved in the darkness of pagan superstition; from which they were converted, with fire and sword, by their neighbours of Ger∣many. Albert, canon of Bremen, who built Riga, held Livonia as a fief of the Empire, obtained of the Emperor a power to coin money, and was vested with authority to institute a new order of knights, under the denomination of Sword-Bearers. These military apostles shed oceans of blood in propa∣gating the doctrines of Christ, the pattern of meek∣ness, and prince of peace: even crusades were preached up and maintained against those infidels of the North. In the year 1234, these knights were re-united to the Prussian or Teutonick Order; and, for a long series of years, maintained bloody wars, sometimes with the Poles, and sometimes with the Muscovites. In the sixteenth century Al∣bert of Brandenburg, the grand master, espoused the doctrines of Luther: then the order of Livo∣nia was separated from that of Prussia, and a schism among the knights ensued. About the year 1535, the majority of the Livonians declared for the pro∣testant religion, in spite of all the threats and in∣trigues of Charles V. emperor of Germany. This country has been alternately a prey to the Ger∣mans,
<PB N="273" REF="2850"/>
the Swedes, the Poles, and the Muscovites. In 1660, it was intirely ceded to the Swedes by the treaty of Oliva. They kept possession of the pro∣vince till the beginning of the present century, when, during the unfortunate war in which the celebrated Charles XII. was engaged, his great rival the czar Peter subdued the whole dutchy of Livonia, as well as Ingria. These conquests were afterwards confirmed to Russia by the treaty of Nystadt, and now constitute part of the Muscovite empire; though they are generally described as provinces of Sweden, to which they formerly be∣longed.</P>
<P>The Livonians, though they profess the religion of Luther, are extremely ignorant, and addicted to many ridiculous ceremonies, which are the re∣licks of their antient superstition. They seem to entertain a very faint notion of a future life: they still sacrifice on the tops of hills, and in forests. When they kill any beast, they throw part of it away to the fiend: when they brew, they pour a libation of beer on the ground, as an offering to the same beings. When a child sickens within six weeks after baptism, it is christened again under another name, which they suppose will be more fortunate. At the marriage of a peasant, the bride rides before the bridegroom, and is preceded by a bagpiper and two friends on horseback: each of these friends carries a drawn sword, with which he makes a cross over the door of the bridegroom's house: then one of the swords is stuck in a beam, over the head of the new-married man, to prevent his being disarmed by charms and incantation: for the same reason the bride scatters red rags along the highway, and over the graves of unbaptized infants. She sits at table with her face veiled, un∣til the guests are seated: then she and her wedded spouse retire to bed, and in two hours return to
<PB N="274" REF="2860"/>
the company, who feast, dance, and drink, until every individual drops down with weariness and intoxication.</P>
<P>The peasants of Livonia are miserable slaves to the nobility, who rule and punish them with the most arbitrary rigour; insomuch that the kings of Sweden have interposed in their behalf, that they might be treated with more humanity. The nobles are vain, proud, haughty, and ferocious. They enjoy certain privileges, of which they were de∣prived by Charles XI. of Sweden, to whom they made a very bold and spirited remonstrance, in consequence of which the famous count Patkul was condemned to death and confiscation. This nobleman, however, found means to escape, and entered into the service of Peter czar of Muscovy. In the course of the succeeding war between Rus∣sia and Sweden, he fell into the hands of Charles XII. who ordered the sentence to be executed upon him, with all the circumstances of the most barbarous severity, to the disgrace of royalty and reproach of humanity: for he had been guilty of no crime, but that of supporting the interest of his country with the courage and fortitude of an old Roman: even Charles XI. though he had, from reasons of state, been prevailed upon to sign his sentence, yet he could not help applauding his pa∣triotism, and was said to have given him private notice to withdraw.</P>
<P>Livonia is divided into the two provinces of Estorna, or Estlandia, and Letten, or Litland.</P>
<P>Estonia, the most northern part of the country, is bounded on the south by Letten, on the east by Muscovy, on the north by the gulph of Finland, and on the west by the gulph of Riga. Revel, the capital, stands on the gulph of Finland, about two hundred and twenty-five miles to the eastward of Stockholm. It is situated partly in a level plain,
<PB N="275" REF="2870"/>
and partly on a mountain, at the top of which is a strong castle. Revel was founded by Waldemar II. king of Denmark, who sold it, together with the towns of Narva and Wesemberg, to the grand master of the Teutonic Order. About the middle of the sixteenth century the city put itself under the protection of Eric king of Sweden, that he might defend it against the Muscovites, by whom it was besieged without success. Revel was one of the first places admitted into the confederacy of the hanse-towns, and carried on a very considerable traffick till the year 1550; when the Muscovites, having reduced Narva, established in this town the commerce they had formerly maintained at Revel: but the trade was brought back into the old channel, when the same people took Revel in the year 1711; and since that period the town has enjoyed a considerable share of commerce. The inha∣bitants still preserve the privileges which were granted by their patrons the grand masters, and the kings of Sweden; and, to this day, maintain the free exercise of religion. In a word, though the city is secured by a Muscovite garrison, the people still enjoy their own forms of government, and all other marks of independency. They even hire a guard of their own, to which they commit the keeping of their great market-place. They profess the protestant religion, according to the confession of Augsburgh; and the government of the city is democratic, consisting of elective ma∣gistrates and counsellors, who, in deliberating on affairs of importance, are obliged to consult occa∣sionally the chiefs of the people. The peasants that were formerly transported hither from Den∣mark, still distinguish themselves from the original natives of the country by their manners, customs, and habit. In the neighbourhood of Revel ap∣pear the ruins of a noble monastery, founded by a
<PB N="276" REF="2880"/>
citizen in the beginning of the fifteenth century. The friars and nuns of this convent are said to have conversed together at a distance, by means of certain signs, of which they composed a dictio∣nary. During the last siege of Revel fifty thou∣sand inhabitants died of the plague, which was probably owing to the want of room, fresh air, and provisions; for great numbers of people from the country had taken shelter in the city.</P>
<P>The second town of Livonia is Narva, or Nerva, situated on a river of the same name, which divides Livonia from Ingria. It was built by Waldemar II. king of Denmark, taken by John Basilowitz czar of Muscovy, retaken by the Swedes, and, finally, reduced by the czar Peter. In the year 1700, it was besieged by an army of eighty thou∣sand Russians under the command of the duke de Croy: Charles XII. of Sweden advanced to its relief at the head of eight thousand men, attacked the Muscovites in their lines, defeated them en∣tirely, slew twenty thousand on the spot, made the general prisoner, and indeed took all their prin∣cipal officers; together with one hundred and ninety cannons or mortars, one hundred and seven∣ty-one colours or standards, and the whole bag∣gage of their army.</P>
<P>Opposite to Narva, on the other side of the river, is the fortress of Iwanogorod, built upon a steep rock, which the river almost surrounds. At the foot of this rock stands a little town, called Russian Narva, inhabited by Muscovites only. These people, among other superstitious rites and ceremonies, observe the eye of Whitsunday as a festival sacred to the dead. On this occasion the women assemble in the church-yard, and, spread∣ing napkins on the graves and tomb-stones, cover them with a variety of dishes of broiled and fried fish, cakes, custards, and painted eggs: then the
<PB N="277" REF="2890"/>
priest perfumes them with frankincense, and holds forth in long prayers; during which the women weep and wail, with the most piteous outcries and lamentations. In the mean while the clerk, who follows the priest, gathers up the offerings for the use and entertainment of his principal.</P>
<P>The river Nerva, which flows from the lake Peibus, and disembogues itself into the gulph of Finland, is extremely rapid. About half a league above the city there is a cataract that deserves par∣ticular notice: the water rushes down a steep pre∣cipice with the most hideous roaring, and with such violence dashes against the rocks, that it is broken and comminuted into a vapour, which con∣tinually rises like a mist; and, when the sun shines aslant upon it in the morning, produces a beautiful rainbow. At present Nerva belongs to the Mus∣covites, who returned to the siege of it in the year 1704; and, after two months open trenches, car∣ried it by assault. On this occasion they committed the most shocking barbarities: general Horn, who commanded the garrison, was sent prisoner to Moscow, where he was confined in a dungeon, with his wife and family, and underwent a thou∣sand indignities.</P>
<P>Estonia abounds with towns and fortresses. Nie∣slat is a strong fort on the western bank of the river Narva, near the place where it issues from the lake Peibus. Weisenberg, on the river Weiss, about one hundred and twenty miles to the west∣ward of Narva, is a strong fortification, in which Charles XII. erected magazines for his expedition into Livonia. Wissenstein, or Wittenstein, is a strong castle, situated in the midst of a morass, about thirty miles to the southward of Wisenberg. Tolsburg is a small sea-port town on the gulph of Finland, at the mouth of the river Senisteback, about ninety miles to the eastward of Narva. Ba∣dis,
<PB N="278" REF="2900"/>
or Padis, is a fortress on the river Assa, twenty miles to the westward of Revel. Hapsal, or Hap∣sel, situated on a small gulph of the Baltic, about thirty miles to the south-east of Revel, was formerly a bishop's see, and subject to Denmark: it has been successively in the hands of the Muscovites and the Swedes; but the Russians gained possession of it again in the beginning of the present century. Lehal, standing on the gulph of Riga, sixty miles to the south-east of Hapsal, is a place of strength, defended by a well fortified castle. Parnaw, in Latin <HI>Parnavia,</HI> situated at the mouth of the river from whence it derives its name, on the gulph of Riga, sixty-five miles to the southward of Revel, was formerly one of the hans-towns, and capital of a Polish palatinate: the town is pretty well for∣tified, and still enjoys a good share of trade, great quantities of corn being here shipped for the Ne∣therlands. It boasts a strong castle, and an univer∣sity, which however is but little frequented. In the year 1710, it fell under the dominion of the Muscovites. Derpt, called by the Muscovites Ju∣nogorod, is a large and antient city, standing on the river Eimbeck, between the lakes Peibus and Wortzi, about sixty miles to the southward of Narva. It was formerly a bishop's see, as well as the seat of an university, founded by Gustavus Adolphus; but, in the sequel, removed from hence to Parnaw. The houses of Derpt are built of stone and brick; and the town, which is not very populous, stands under the protection of a strong castle. The place has successively belonged to many different masters, and is at present subject to the empire of Russia. Felin, a town provided with a castle or citadel, stands on a small river that issues from the lake Wortzi, about seventy miles to the westward of Derpt. Ringen and Tarnest
<PB N="279" REF="2910"/>
are two fortresses: the former five and thirty miles to the southward of Felin: the other was hereto∣fore remarkably strong; but has been often demo∣lished, and the fortifications were never wholly re∣paired.</P>
<P>The district of Letten is bounded on the west by the Baltic, on the north by Estonia, on the east by Muscovy, and on the south and south-west by the river Dwina; though, even beyond this river, there is a narrow tract of land belonging to Letten, to which likewise are annexed the islands of Oesel and Daglio.</P>
<P>Riga, the capital not only of this province, but of all Livonia, is a very considerable city, stand∣ing in a large plain on the western bank of the river Dwina, about six miles above the place where it discharges itself into the Baltic, at the gulph of Riga, being one hundred and twenty miles to the southward of Revel. This town was heretofore possessed by the Teutonic Order, and here the grand master resided: it afterwards engaged in the hanseatique confederacy, and for many years con∣tinued a free town, under the protection of the German emperors. In the sixteenth century the inhabitants unanimously embraced the religion of Luther, expelled the Roman catholic clergy, and seized upon their estates. Since that period Riga has been several times reduced, and alternately subject to the Muscovites, the Poles, and the Swedes. In the month of July, 1710, it was final∣ly taken by the Russians, after they had reduced it to a heap of rubbish, and still continues under their dominion. The city has risen more beautiful and commodious from its ashes; is large, popu∣lous, and carries on a very considerable trade in corn, hemp, flax, pitch, tar, planks, furs, Russian leather, and pot-ashes: these articles are exchanged for the commodities of more southern countries.
<PB N="280" REF="2920"/>
The harbour is guarded by the fort of Dunamun∣der-schans, built about six miles below the city, near the mouth of the river Dwina. The town itself is well fortified with walls, bastions, a large and deep fosse, a strong castle on the river, in which the governor resides, and a fortress opposite to the town on the other side of the river.</P>
<P>The other remarkable places of this province are Kokenhausen, on the river Dwina, about nine∣ty miles to the eastward of Riga; Nieuhaus, on the frontiers of Muscovy; Marienburg, about five and twenty miles to the south-west of Nieuhaus; Warbeck, at the mouth of the river Eimbeck, near the lake Peibus; Treiden, on the river of that name, about forty-five miles to the eastward of Riga; Sewold, on the opposite side of the river; and Wolmer, which stands on the same river, eighty miles to the north-east of Riga.</P>
<P>Ingria, or Ingermerland, lying to the northward of Livonia, is bounded by the bottom of the gulph of Finland, the river Nieva, and the lake Ladoga, to the northward; by the river Luga on the south; on the west by part of the lake Peibus, and the river Narva, dividing it from that part of Livonia; and on the east by an imaginary line, drawn from the town of Luba to the river Luga. This coun∣try, stretching about one hundred and thirty miles in length, and seventy in breadth, is very fruitful, and abounds with cattle. Here likewise is found a great number of wild beasts, including elks, which, during the summer, swim the river Nieva into Carelia, and return at the approach of winter. The czar Peter, being desirous of opening an easy communication between Archangel and the Baltic, by means of the gulph of Finland, in order to fa∣cilitate and improve the commerce of his domi∣nions, resolved to obtain possession of Ingria, which accordingly he reconquered from Sweden in the
<PB N="281" REF="2930"/>
beginning of this century. The capital of Ingria is Petersburg, one of the most stupendous efforts of human resolution. It is situated between Fin∣land and Ingria, about one hundred and eighty miles to the eastward of Revel, and three hundred and eighty-seven miles from Stockholm. The czar Peter, that amazing compound of greatness and barbarity, fired with the ambition of becoming a maritime power in the Baltic, resolved to found this city, which is now the residence of the Russian court, and the centre of trade for all the Musco∣vite dominions. The spot he pitched upon was a low, fenny, uncultivated island, formed by the branches of the river Nieva, before they fall into the gulph of Finland. In the summer this island was covered with mud; and in winter became a frozen pool, rendered almost inaccessible by dreary forests and deep morasses, the haunts of bears, wolves, and other savage animals. Such was the natural state of the ground on which Peter has raised an unexampled monument of greatness and policy. Having taken the fort of Nattebourg, and the town of Neischanz, in the year 1703, this mighty conqueror assembled in Ingria above three hundred thousand men, Russians, Tartars, Cos∣sacks, Livonians, and others, even from the most distant parts of his empire, and laid the founda∣tion of the citadel and fortifications, which were finished in four months, almost in despite of Na∣ture. He was obliged to open ways through fo∣rests, drain bogs, raise dykes, and lay causeways, before he could pretend to found the new city. The workmen were ill provided with necessary tools and implements, such as spades, pick-axes, shovels, planks, and wheel-barrows: they were even obliged to fetch the earth from a great dis∣tance in the skirts of their garments, or in little
<PB N="282" REF="2940"/>
bags, made of old mats and rags sewed together. They had neither huts nor houses to shelter them from the severity of the weather: the country, which had been desolated by war, could not accom∣modate such a multitude with provisions; and the supplies by the lake Ladoga were often retarded by contrary winds. In consequence of these hard∣ships, above one hundred thousand men are said to have perished: nevertheless the work proceeded with incredible vigour and expedition; while Peter, for the security of his workmen, formed a great camp, in such a manner, that his infantry con∣tinued in Finland, and his cavalry were quartered in Ingria. Some Swedish cruizers being descried in the neighbourhood, the Czar posted a body of troops in the isle of Rutzari, by whom the Swedes were repulsed, and the work met with no further interruption. The buildings of the city kept pace with the fortress, which is in the centre of the town, surrounded on all sides by the Nieva; and, in little more than a year, above thirty thou∣sand houses were erected. At present there may be about double that number in Petersbourg, though many of them are paultry and inconsider∣able. In order to people this city, Peter invited hither merchants, artificers, mechanicks, and sea∣men, from all the different countries of Europe: he demolished the town of Nieuschans, and brought hither not only the materials of the houses, but the inhabitants themselves. A thousand families were drawn from Moscow: he obliged his nobility to quit their palaces and their villas in and about Mos∣cow, and take up their residence at Petersbourg, in a much more cold and comfortless climate. Finally, resolving to remove hither the trade of Archangel, he issued an ordonnance, importing, That all such merchandize as had been conveyed

</FIGURE>
<PB N="283" REF="2960"/>
to Archangel, in order to be sold to foreigners, should now be sent to Petersbourg, where they should pay no more than the usual duties. These endeavours and regulations have rendered this one of the greatest and most flourishing cities in Eu∣rope. The Russian boyars and nobility have built magnificent palaces, and are now reconciled to their situation. At first many houses were built of timber; but these being subject to sudden confla∣grations, in spite of all the precautions that could be taken, the Czar, in the year 1714, issued an order, that all new houses should be walled with brick, and covered with tiles. The fort is an ir∣regular hexagon, with opposite bastions. This, together with all the rest of the fortifications, was in the beginning formed of earth only; but in the sequel they were faced with strong walls, and pro∣vided with casemates, which are bomb-proof. In the curtain of the fort, on the right-hand side, is a noble dispensary, well supplied with excellent medicines, and enriched with a great number of porcelain vases from China and Japan. From one of the gates of the fort a draw-bridge is thrown over an arm of the river, in which the Czar's gal∣leys, and other small vessels, are sheltered in the winter. The most remarkable building within the fort is the cathedral, built by the direction of an Italian architect. Petersbourg is partly built on little islands, some of which are connected by draw-bridges, and partly on the continent. In the highest part, on the bank of the Nieva, the Czar fixed his habitation, or ordinary residence, built of free-stone, and situated so as to command a prospect of the greater part of the city. Here likewise is a royal foundery; together with the superb houses of many noblemen. One disagree∣able circumstance in Petersbourg is, that none of
<PB N="284" REF="2970"/>
the numerous streets have names, so that it is very difficult for a stranger to find out particular places. The marshy ground on which the city is built, being found extremely slippery, dirty, and incom∣modious, the Czar ordered every inhabitant to pave a certain space before his own door. In the year 1716, Peter, taking a fancy to the island Wasili-Osterno, which he had given as a present to prince Menzikoff, resumed the grant, and ordered the city to be extended into this quarter. He even obliged the boyars, or nobles, to build stone∣houses on this spot, though they were already in possession of others on the side of Ingria: accord∣ingly this is now the most magnificent part of the city. On the other side of a branch of the Nieva stands the Czar's country or summer palace, pro∣vided with a fine garden and orangerie. On the bank of the same river is the slaboda, or suburbs, in which the Germans generally chuse their habita∣tion. Petersbourg is very much subject to dan∣gerous inundations. In the year 1715, all the bastions and draw-bridges were either overwhelmed, or carried away. The breadth, depth, and rapidity of the Nieva, have rendered it extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to join the islands and the continent by bridges. Besides, Peter was averse to this expedient for another reason: resolved to accustom his subjects to navigation, he not only rejected the project of a bridge, but also ordered, that no boat should pass between the islands and the continent, except by the help of sails only. In consequence of this strange regulation many lives were lost: but at length he gained his point; and by habituating his sluggish Muscovites to the dan∣gers of the sea, in a little time produced a breed of hardy sailors. The adjacent country is so bar∣ren, that the town must be supplied with provi∣sions
<PB N="285" REF="2980"/>
from a great distance; consequently they are extremely dear. Here are woods in plenty, consisting of pine, fir, alder, birch, poplar, and elm; but the oak and the beech are generally brought from Casan. In winter the weather is ex∣tremely cold, and excessive hot in the summer. In June the length of the night does not exceed three hours, during which the natives enjoy a con∣tinued twilight: but in December the sun is not visible more than three hours above the horizon.</P>
<P>The czar Peter, who was indefatigable in his endeavours to improve and civilize his subjects, neglected nothing which he thought could contri∣bute to these purposes. He condescended even to institute and regulate assemblies at Petersbourg: these were opened at five in the afternoon, and the house was shut at ten: between these hours the fashionable people of both sexes met without cere∣mony, danced, conversed, or played either at cards or at chess, this last being a favourite diversion among the Russians. There was likewise an apart∣ment set apart for drinking brandy and smoaking tobacco. Plays and operas were likewise intro∣duced for the same purposes: but as Peter had little relish, and less taste, for those entertain∣ments, they were performed in a very aukward manner in his life-time: however, since his death, these performances have been brought to a greater degree of art and decorum.</P>
<P>This great northern legislator established, in the neighbourhood of Petersbourg, manufactures of linnen, paper, saltpetre, sulphur, gun-powder, and bricks, together with water-mills for sawing tim∣ber. He instituted a marine academy, and obliged every considerable family in Russia to send at least one son or kinsman, between the ages of ten and eighteen, to this seminary, where he was instructed in navigation, learned the languages, was taught
<PB N="286" REF="2990"/>
to perform his exercises, and to live under the se∣verest discipline. To crown his other plans of re∣formation, he granted letters-patent for founding an academy, upon a very liberal endowment; and though he did not live to execute this scheme, his empress, who survived him, brought it to perfec∣tion. It was modelled on the plans of the royal society in London, and the academy of France. Mr. Bullfinger opened it in the year 1726, with an eloquent speech on the design and utility of an academy of sciences; and the professors, who have always distinguished themselves by their merit and erudition, publish an annual collection of their transactions: a task the more easy, as they have the benefit of printing presses, well managed, at Petersbourg.</P>
<P>The czar Peter, having laid the foundations, and made some progress in building his new city, bethought himself of a convenient harbour, in which the shipping might be secure, and pitched upon the island of Retusari, or Rutzari, at the mouth of the gulph of Finland. There he built a new town, called Cronsladt, and secured it with the castle of Cronsladt, situated on a sand-bank near the side of Ingria; so that, between the castle and the town, the shipping ride in a safe, deep, and spacious harbour. The castle is built in the form of a round tower, surrounded with three tire of galleries, well furnished with cannon. There are likewise two small batteries on the opposite island; and, in case of emergency, a large train of artillery may be mounted on the piers of the harbour.</P>
<P>Along the banks of the river, from Cronsladt to Petersbourg, the country is adorned with ele∣gant houses. Among these the chief are Orangen∣baum, belonging to prince Menzikoff; and the Czar's pleasure-house, called Petershoff, which stands on a rising ground, is furnished in the Dutch
<PB N="287" REF="3000"/>
taste, and provided with gardens, plantations, fish∣ponds, and cascades. At the foot of the ascent on which the palace is situated, there is a canal sixteen miles in length, so large as to admit consi∣derable vessels from the sea: it is filled by the con∣junction of three rivulets, and was completed in two months. This body of water replenishes a large reservoir, from which all the ponds, cascades, and water-works in the neighbourhood are sup∣plied. Noteburg, called by the Muscovites Ores∣ca, is a sea-port, and strong fortress, situated on an island formed by the river Nieva, near the western bank of the lake Ladoga. It was retaken from the Swedes by the czar Peter in the year 1702, improved in its fortifications, and denominated Slentelburg, from <HI>slentel,</HI> a key, because it is the key from Finland. Nieuschans is demolished. Iwanogorod is a strong castle, opposite to Narva. Coporio is a fort situated on the bank of a small river, above five and forty miles to the north-east of Iwanogorod. Jama is another fortress, built on a river of the same name, fifteen miles to the north-east of Iwanogorod. All these towns and forts had been ceded by the Muscovites to the Swedes, in a treaty concluded in the year 1618; but were retaken by the Czar in the beginning of the present century.</P>
<P>Finland, Finlandia, Finnonia, Fennia, or Fe∣ningia, extends from the gulph of Finland to the Polish Circle, about three hundred and eighty-six miles in length from north to south, and two hun∣dred and fifteen from east to west, bounded by Muscovy, part of Lapland, and the gulph of Both∣nia. The country produces some grain, abounds with pastures and cattle, and the lakes are well stocked with fish: these they export to Sweden, together with a considerable quantity of butter and
<PB N="288" REF="3010"/>
cheese. The people speak a language peculiar to themselves, though it has a strong affinity with that which is spoken in Sweden; and the Lutheran doctrine is the only established religion. Of old the Finlanders were governed by kings of their own, until the middle of the thirteenth century, when they were conquered by Eric IX. of Sweden. Since that period Finland, under the title of the Grand Dutchy, has been possessed as an inheri∣tance by the brothers of the Swedish monarchs; but now it is united to the crown. In Finland, however, part of the province of Savolaxia, the whole of Kexholm, the best part of Carelia, toge∣ther with the town and fortress of Nyslot, were ceded for ever to Russia, by the treaty concluded at Abo in the year 1743. Finland is divided into seven provinces: Finland Proper, Nyland, Carelia, Kexholm, Savolax, Tavastia, and Cajania. The capital of Finland Proper, and indeed of the whole dutchy, is Abo, or Aboa, situated on the Bothnic gulph, at the mouth of the river Aurojoki, over∣against the isle of Aland. The town is a bishop's see, and is provided with an university, founded and liberally endowed by queen Christina. It de∣rives a considerable trade from its convenient har∣bour; in the neighbourhood of which is a rock, surrounded by the sea, which when any ship ap∣proaches, the needle of the compass no longer points to the north: a circumstance from which it is conjectured that the rock contains a mine of loadstones. The other towns of Finland Proper are these: Biorno, an inconsiderable place, about twelve miles to the north-west of Abo; Hangout, or Hango, a celebrated sea-port on the gulph of Finland; Biorneburg, a paultry town, standing on the river Kume, in the gulph of Bothnia; Ny∣stadt, or Neostadium, a small town in a little bay
<PB N="289" REF="3020"/>
of the Bothnic gulph, famous for the peace which was concluded at this place in the year 1721, be∣tween the late Czar and the king of Sweden. The province of Nyland is parted from Carelia on the east by the river Kymen, and on the south is washed by the gulph of Finland. The chief town is Hel∣singfors, or Helsingford, an inconsiderable place, situated at the mouth of the river Winda, which here falls into the gulph of Finland. The other towns of this district are Burgo, Raseburg, and Ekenes. Burgo is an antient town, standing on the coast of the Finland gulph: Raseburg stands on the same gulph, and is capital of an earldom: Ekenes is situated on a peninsula of the same gulph, and is by rocks and shelves rendered of very diffi∣cult access.</P>
<P>The province of Carelia is a fruitful country, stretching from east to west about one hun∣dred and fifty miles. The most noted towns are Wyburg, Wekelax, Wilmanstrand, and Mala. Wyburg, situated at the bottom of a bay in the Finnic gulph, is a bishop's see, a place of consi∣derable trade, with a convenient harbour, well secured with fortifications and a castle, which how∣ever could not resist the attacks of the czar Peter, by whom it was reduced. Wekelax is a wretched town on the same gulph. Wilmanstrand, situated in a morass near a lake, about thirty miles to the northward of Wyburg, belongs to the Muscovites, and has been made famous by the victory which the Russians obtained over the Swedes in the year 1741. Mala stands on a small bay that commu∣nicates with the lake Ladoga.</P>
<P>The district of Kexholm comprehends a large tract of land, but chiefly roughened with mountains, or co∣vered with lakes. There are but two places of any note in this province; namely, Kexholm, a small ci∣ty, standing among marshes on the western bank of
<PB N="290" REF="3030"/>
the lake Ladoga, sixty miles to the north-east of Wyburg, defended by a strong citadel; and Lexa, a small town in the northern part of the province. The district of Savolax, bounded on the north by Cajania, on the east by Kexholm, on the south by Carelia, and on the west by Tavastia, is a barren country, thinly inhabited, abounding with lakes and forests. The towns are Koskimpe, Nyslot, Runal, and Saminge.</P>
<P>The country of Tavastia is marshy, covered with lakes, and ill peopled. The capital, Ta∣vastus, otherwise called Croneburg, stands in the southern part of the province, on a small river that falls into the lake Wana: the place, though inconsiderable, is strong by its situation. The other towns are Sermake, Hattula, Mahatan, Rautalanby, Jemse, Sisme, and Padasjoki. All these are places of small importance; the greater part situated on the lake Peinde, or Pejinde, which extends about fourscore miles in length, commu∣nicating with other lakes, particularly with that called Rotzlain; by means of which its waters issue in the river Kymen, that disembogues itself into the gulph of Finland. The province of Cajania lies along the gulph of Bothnia, which receives a great number of rivers, by which the district is watered. The largest of its numerous lakes is called Ula-tresk, extending about forty-five miles in length, and twenty-four in breadth, and issues into the sea by the river Ula. In the middle of this piece of water stands the island Ula, about fifteen miles long, and nine in breadth. The eastern and northern parts of this province are mountainous; but the rest is tolerably fruitful. Among its towns we number Cajaneburg, the capital, that stands on the lake Ula-tresk, about thirty miles from the confines of Lapland, and is secured by a strong citadel; Ula and Ulaburg, the
<PB N="291" REF="3040"/>
former at the mouth of the Ula, on the Bothnic gulph; the other a little fortified town, in an island opposite to the mouth of that river; Old Carelby, and New Carelby, situated on the coast of the Bothnic gulph, and between them stands Jacob∣stadt. On the same coast is situated Lochto, near the mouth of the river Lochtoa, that springs from a ridge of mountains, which divide Cajania from Tavastia, and, being swelled by the waters of the lake Lestjerwi, runs northerly into the gulph of Bothnia. Wasa, or Mustasar, is a sea-port on the same gulph, famous for being the birth-place of the celebrated Gustavus Vasa: Christianstadt stands likewise on the Bothnic gulph, about fifteen miles to the southward of Wasa; but this must not be confounded with the town of Christianstadt, situated in the province of Bleking, which we have already described.</P>
<P>The considerable islands belonging to Sweden are Gothland, Oeland, Oefel, Dago, Aland, and Hogland.</P>
<P>Gothland, lying in the Baltic, opposite to the coast of East Gothland, extends about fifty-six miles in length, and about eighteen in breadth from east to west. This island is fertile and po∣pulous, producing rich pastures, cattle, fish, fowl, timber, excellent water, and beautiful marble. The only considerable town is Wisby, or Wisburg, built in the western side, on the declivity of a rock, near the sea-shore, surrounded with a strong wall, and secured by a castle near the harbour, where the governor of the island usually resides. This city was considerable as early as the eighth cen∣tury, and in the sequel became extremely populous and powerful. The foreigners who traded at Wis∣by were so numerous, that, in the thirteenth cen∣tury, they were able to make head against the natives, by whom however they were defeated in
<PB N="292" REF="3050"/>
a pitched battle. The place is famous for its laws relating to trade and navigation, which as they are said to have been taken from those of the isle of Oleron in France, have been also copied and im∣proved by the deputies of the hanse-towns, and sent to Lubeck in the sixteenth century, on pur∣pose to compile a body of laws for the regulation of commerce, which laws are still observed through∣out the whole Baltic. Wisby was heretofore a very large, superb, and flourishing city; but now it is greatly decayed, both in the number and wealth of its inhabitants, and in the importance of its traffick: they still boast that they were the first who invented and composed sea-charts and hydro∣graphical tables.</P>
<P>The isle of Oeland, lying over-against the con∣tinent of South Gothland, from which it is sepa∣rated by the narrow streight called Calmarsundt, is a long ship of land, extending seventy miles in length, though not above twelve miles at its great∣est breadth. The soil produces good pastures, on which are fed many herds of oxen, horses, and fallow-deer. On the western coast there are only two villages, and the town of Borkholm, which is the capital of the island, a small place, defended by a castle. On the eastern coast we find the towns of Boda, Koningsgard, Hogaby, Kilda, Stapeling, Genstala, Remasten, Mokleby, Stenasa, and divers populous villages. Oeland, which has been often attacked, is secured by many forts and castles. Oesel, lying off the coast of Livonia, just before the gulph of Riga, is about forty miles in length, and tolerably fertile. It was conquered from the Swedes by the Muscovites, who still possess this, with all the other appendages of Livonia. The chief town is Arensburg, situated on the southern coast of the island, and defended by a castle. On
<PB N="293" REF="3060"/>
the northern side we find another fortress, called Sonneburg.</P>
<P>The isle of Dago, or Daghoe, lies in a triangu¦lar form to the northward of Oesel, from which it is separated by the narrow streight of Honswick. The greatest extent of it may amount to six and twenty miles from north to south. The north-east part of the coast is mountainous; and there is a sand-bank, with some other small isles, between this island and the continent of Estonia. On the western cape of Dago the senate of Revel caused a very high tower to be built, by the name of Dag∣heroort, and this serves as a light-house and land∣mark to mariners at sea.</P>
<P>Aland is an island in the Baltic, thirty miles to the eastward of the coast of Sweden, and five and forty to the south-west of Finland, about twenty miles in length, indented with many deep bays, and almost surrounded with a good number of small islands. The country abounds with cattle and wild beasts, though here are neither wolves nor deer; and the sea affords plenty of fish to the inhabitants. The island belongs to the Muscovites, and is de∣fended by a fortress called Castelholm. Of the isles that surround it the chief is Ekero, about six miles in length, and separated from Aland by a channel three miles in breadth.</P>
<P>Hogland, signifying <HI>high land,</HI> is a small island, extending about nine miles in length, in the gulph of Finland. The country is a cluster of rocks, covered with brambles and some fir-trees, haunted by a few hares that grow white in winter.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>RUSSIA, OR, MUSCOVY.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SITUATION, EXTENT, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>MUSCOVY is a vast country, lying be∣tween the 47th and 72d degrees of north latitude, and between the 23d and 65th degrees of east longitude from London. It is supposed to extend fifteen hundred leagues from west to east, and six hundred from north to south: but the limits of it easterly cannot be easily ascer∣tained, as this part is a meer desert, abandoned on account of the incursions of the Tartars; and as for the northern parts, the cold has rendered them almost inaccessible. Muscovy, likewise known by the name of White Russia, on account of the snow by which it is covered for the greatest part of the year, and of Great Russia, alluding to its prodi∣gious
<PB N="295" REF="3080"/>
extent, stretches from the Frozen Sea, or Northern Ocean, as far east as Great Tartary and the sea of Japan: on the south it is bounded by the Calmuck and Cuban Tartary, Persia, Georgia, the Caspian and Euxine Seas; and on the west by Poland and Sweden. Russia is divided into four parts, namely, Muscovy Proper, or Western Mus∣covy, Eastern Muscovy, Muscovite Tartary, and Muscovite Lapland. These are subdivided into provinces northern, southern, eastern, and western, amounting to a very considerable number, includ∣ing some kingdoms and dutchies, which have been conquered and subdued by the Czars of Russia.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FACE of the COUNTRY, exhibiting MOUN∣TAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>In the province of Vogulezi is a ridge of moun∣tains, called Zimnopoias, or the Girdle of the Earth, supposed to be the <HI>Montes Riphaei</HI> of the antients. There are likewise large tracts of desert sands, that produce nothing but vermin.</P>
<P>Muscovy is in general a flat level country, ex∣cept towards the north, where it is rough and moun∣tainous. Forests abound every where throughout this empire. The plains are marshy, or flooded with a great number of lakes, some of which ex∣tend above forty leagues in length. The Ladoga and Onega, on the borders of Finland, are the largest in Europe. The Ladoga is formed by four ri∣vers; the principal of which are the Voxen, or Corela the Fair, which flows into it from the lake of One∣ga, and the Volchova, which runs into it from the south: the overplus is discharged by a channel into the gulph of Finland. The lake Onega is also filled by a considerable number of rivers, near the mouths of which many towns and cities are built, for the convenience of commerce. The other
<PB N="296" REF="3090"/>
noted lakes are Brela-ozera, from whence a pro∣vince derives its name; Iwanosero-cargapol, which lends its name to another province; and Honent, in the neighbourhood of the Great Novogorod.</P>
<P>Muscovy likewise boasts a considerable number of large and famous rivers. The Oby, formed by the junction of the Tobal and the Irtis, in the 65th degree of northern latitude, runs northward into the Frozen Ocean, opposite to Nova Zembla, and is the boundary between Europe and Asia: the Manga Sea runs parallel to the Oby, and disem∣bogues itself into the same sea, which likewise re∣ceives the Pezara, or Petzara, issuing from the lake Petzarcoe in the province of Vagulizi, running the same course. The Dwina takes its orgin in Wolog∣da, runs a northerly course, and falls into the White Sea below Archangel. The Wolga, or Vol∣ga, formerly known by the name of Rha, owes its origin to the lake Uranow, near the frontiers of Lithuania; directs its course south-easterly through European Russia, receiving in its route the rivers Mologo, Mosco, Kioma, Ocka, Samar, and above thrity more; then enters Asiatic Russia, and by several channels discharges itself into the Caspian Sea, below Astracan: this is the largest and deep∣est river in Russia. The Don, formerly called the Tanais, takes its rise in the middle of Russia, is swelled by the Weronetz, runs in a south-east di∣rection to Kamisinka; then winding to the south-west, receives the Donets, and falls into the <HI>Palus Moeotis,</HI> or sea of Azoph. The Nieper, heretofore the Boristhenes, rises in the province of Moscow, runs through Poland, re-enters Muscovy, passes Kiof, waters the Ukraine, and, after a southerly course through Tartary, falls into the Euxine Sea at Oczakow. The Lower Dwina, rising also in the province of Moscow, runs through Poland, which it divides from Livonia, and discharges itself
<PB N="297" REF="3100"/>
into the Baltic, below Riga. Some of these mighty rivers run a surprising length of course: that of the Wolga exceeds two thousand miles: it washes the walls of near fourscore towns, and sup∣plies the country with prodigious quantities of sturgeon, salmon, pikes, and other fishes of stu∣pendous size and exquisite delicacy. Along its banks are found troufles, and wild asparagus, of a most delicious taste and flavour: here likewise grow the only oaks that are produced in Muscovy. This country enjoying the benefit of a fruitful soil, with these other advantages, was so much subject to the incursions of the Cuban Tartars, that the greater part of it lay uncultivated, until it was se∣cured by an intrenchment made by the direction of the czar Peter, extending from the Volga near the city of Zaritza, to the river Don in the neigh∣bourhood of Twia: yet a large tract of land, on the outside of this work, lies open to the invasion of those freebooters. Though the length of the Don, or Tanais, which rises in the province of Re∣zan, does not exceed four hundred miles in a direct line from its source to the <HI>Palus Moeotis,</HI> in which it is lost, it will be found to run above a thousand, if traced in all its windings; in the course of which it is swelled by many rivers, waters many cities, and forms a great number of beautiful islands, in one of which is situated Tckercaske, the metro∣polis of Circassia.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE, SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, VE∣GETABLES, and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>In such a vast extent of country, stretching from the Temperate so far into the Frigid Zone, the cli∣mate must vary considerably in different places. In the southern parts of Muscovy the longest day does not exceed fifteen hours and a half; whereas
<PB N="298" REF="3110"/>
in the most northern the sun in summer is seen two months above the horizon. The country in general, though lying under different climates, is excessively cold in the winter. Towards the north the ground is covered near three quarters of the year with snow and ice; and by the severity of the cold many unfortunate persons are maimed, or perish. This sort of weather commonly sets in about the latter end of August, and continues till the month of May; in which interval the rivers are frozen to the depth of four or five feet. Water, thrown up into the air, will fall down in isicles: birds are frozen in their flight, and travellers in their sledges. In some provinces the heats of summer are as scorching as the winter colds are rigorous.</P>
<P>The soil of Muscovy varies still more than the climate, according to the influence of the sun and the situation of the country. The warmer pro∣vinces produce wheat, oats, barley, pease, and rye, together with a variety of herbs and fruits; and the vegetation is so quick, that corn is commonly reaped in two months after it begins to appear above the surface of the ground. The natives use no other manure than the snow, which is supposed to enrich the ground, and to cherish and shelter the grain that is sown immediately after harvest. The great variety of mushrooms produced spon∣taneously in Russia, may be considered as a com∣fortable relief to the poor, while they appear as delicacies at the tables of the rich. Above a thou∣sand waggon-loads of them used to be sold annual∣ly in Moscow. Perhaps it is on account of the scarcity of provisions, that such a number of fasts are instituted in the Muscovite religion: certainly nothing will so effectually reconcile people to hun∣ger, as a conviction that fasting is a religious duty, pleasing in the sight of heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="3120"/>
Besides some oaks, a great quantity of fir, and those productions we have mentioned, Musco∣vy yields rhubarb, flax, hemp, pasture for cattle, wax, and honey. Among other vegetables we find in Russia a particular kind of rice, called psyntha, plenty of excellent melons, and, in the neighbour∣hood of Astracan, the famous zoophyton, or animal plant, which the Muscovites call <HI>bonnaret,</HI> or lamb∣kin, from its resemblance to a lamb.</P>
<P>Agriculture in general was but little understood, and less prosecuted, in this country, until it was improved under the encouragement and influence of that great patriot the czar Peter, who was in∣defatigable in executing his plans of reformation. The natural ignorance, sloth, and obstinacy of the people, together with the tyranny of the nobles, by whom they are miserably enslaved, were such obstructions to the improvement of husbandry, as nothing but his genius could have surmounted. The most considerable articles in the oeconomy of a Russian farm are wax and honey, by which the peasant is often enriched. He cuts down a great number of trees in the forest, and sawing the trunks into a number of parts, bores each of these, and stops up the hollow at both ends, leaving only a little hole for the admittance of the bees: thus the honey is secured from all the attempts of the bear, who is extremely fond of it, and tries many different experiments for making himself master of the luscious treasure. Of this honey the Rus∣sians make a great quantity of strong metheglin, for their ordinary drink. They likewise extract from rye a spirit, which they prefer to brandy. Muscovy is very rich in mines of silver, lead, and iron, which are worked in different parts of the country, and yield a very considerable revenue to the sovereign.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="300" REF="3130"/>
<HEAD>ANIMALS, QUADRUPEDS, BIRDS, FISHES, and INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>The wild beasts in the northern part of Russia, are the same with those we have mentioned in the articles of Norway and Lapland; such as rein∣deer, bears, foxes, ermins, martens, sables, hares, and squirrels. In the more southern provinces the Muscovites breed black cattle, small but hardy horses, sheep, goats, and camels. The breed of cattle and horses has been enlarged by the care, and under the protection of Peter. The whole empire abounds with wild fowl and game of all sorts, and a variety of birds of prey; besides the different kinds of poultry, which are raised in this as well as in other countries. A few particular birds will be described in the account of the re∣spective provinces to which they are peculiar. The external parts and provinces of Muscovy are well supplied with sea-fish from the Northern Ocean, the Baltic, or gulph of Finland, the White Sea, the Black Sea, and the Caspian: but the whole empire is plentifully provided with fresh-water fish from the numerous lakes and rivers, yielding im∣mense quantities of salmon, trout, pike, sturgeon, and beluga; the last being a large fish, of whose roe the best caviare is made. Innumerable insects, like those of Lapland, are hatched by the summer's heat in the sands, morasses, and forests, with which this empire abounds, and are so troublesome as to render great part of the country altogether unin∣habitable.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their CHARACTER, MANNERS, and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>Muscovy is supposed to derive its name from the river Moscka, which waters Moscow, the ca∣pital of the empire, was in all probability peopled
<PB N="301" REF="3140"/>
from Tartary by wandering tribes, distinguished by the appellation of Rossi, signifying, in the Scla∣vonic language, a collected nation; or deriving the name of Russians from <HI>Rosseia,</HI> dispersed, or scattered. Be that as it may, this vast empire is but thinly inhabited, in proportion to its extent; great part of it consisting in dreary wastes of sand, desert, forest, and morass. Many parts of it are possessed by people who are, in all respects, dif∣ferent from the native Muscovites. The kingdom of Siberia, including the province of Dauria, was originally peopled with Tartars, who lived in little hordes or tribes, under distinct governments, and shifted their habitations occasionally: but since the establishment of Russian colonies in these countries, they have learned to dwell in houses, to till the ground, and pay an annual tribute of furs to the Czar, or Emperor. There are other Tartars, how∣ever, who still live in tents, leading a vagrant life, without acknowledging the Czar's sovereignty. Casan and Astracan were Tartarean kingdoms, and still contain a great number of these people, though they are not allowed to reside within the cities which have been built by the Muscovites. A large tract of land, between Nise-Novogorod and Casan, on both sides of the river Volga, is occupied by the Zeremisses and Morduars, who live peaceably, employing themselves in agriculture, and pay taxes like the other subjects of Russia; but they never furnish recruits for the army. From Casan to the frontiers of Siberia the country is inhabited by the Baskirs, a powerful nation, who have some villages, and enjoy certain privileges, of which they are very tenacious. The rest of this tract, as far as Astracan and the frontiers of the Usbecks, is fre∣quented by the wandering Khalmucks, who re∣move with their tents, according to the season, for the convenience of subsistence. They receive an∣nually
<PB N="302" REF="3150"/>
from the Czar presents of cloth, money, and arms, in return for which they are obliged to serve in his army without pay. This, however, is ill saved; for they plunder friend and foe, without distinction; and are, on the whole, barbarous, brutal, and savagely cruel. The Cossacks are dis∣tinguished into three tribes, known by the places where they made their first settlements; though they are all of the same nation, speak the same language, profess the same religion, and live un∣der the same form of government. They were originally Polish peasants, formed into a militia, under their own officers, and posted in the Ukraine, to secure the frontiers of the Republic against the incursions of the Tartars. In process of time they took arms against the Polish nobility, who treated them like slaves, and several battles ensued. The Cossacks being worsted in one of the first engage∣ments, a certain number of them retired to the unfrequented banks of the Don, or Tanais, where they established a colony. In the year 1637, an∣other detachment, resolving to penetrate as far as the Caspian Sea, were persuaded to join their coun∣trymen on the Don, in an attempt upon Asoph, which they accordingly reduced; but the Turks approaching with a great army, they abandoned the place, after having reduced it to ashes; and built the town of Circasky on an island in the Don, putting themselves under the protection of the Muscovites. Their settlement soon increased to such a degree, that they possessed thirty-nine towns on both sides of the river, from Rybna to Asoph. The country is fruitful; but they sow very little corn. They feed mostly on fish, flesh, and fruits. Their wealth consists in cattle, horses, dromeda∣ries, and camels. They are more neat in their houses and garb than the Muscovites. They pro∣fess the Greek religion, and delight in arms, which
<PB N="303" REF="3160"/>
they exercise occasionally against the Khalmuck, Cuban, and Crim Tartars; and, in time of war, harrass the Turks on the <HI>Palus Moeotis.</HI> Their go∣vernment is military and democratic. Their chief hetman, or general, resides at Circasky; is elected by the captains and civil officers of the nation, confirmed by the Czar, and enjoys his employ∣ment for life. Every town is like a separate com∣monwealth, ruled by its own hetman, who is an∣nually chosen, and acts as captain of his own com∣munity. These Cossacks enjoy their own laws and customs: they neither pay tribute, nor furnish re∣cruits; but are bound to appear in arms at their own charge, when summoned by the czar of Mus∣covy. In the reign of Peter they revolted, on ac∣count of some grievances, and were not reduced without great difficulty. Many of their towns were burned, and the inhabitants massacred, with∣out distinction of age or sex; so that now their number is greatly diminished. The Cossacks of the Ukraine are much more numerous and consi∣derable; their dominions extending several hun∣dred miles, between the rivers Nieper and Don. In the year 1654, they and their hetman revolted from Poland, and had recourse to the Czar's pro∣tection, which they purchased by ceding to him Chioff, Czernichoff, and several other strong places, as pledges of their fidelity. Their coun∣try is populous, and well cultivated, abounding with fortified towns, and large villages, neatly built of wood. They carry on a considerable traf∣fick in hemp, pot-ashes, wax, corn, and cattle, and claim the same privileges that are enjoyed by the Don Cossacks. The Muscovite nobility having encroached upon their liberties, their chief, Ma∣zeppa, revolted to Charles XII. king of Sweden. But they had concerted their measures so ill, that their town of Bathurin was burned, and six thou∣sand
<PB N="304" REF="3170"/>
of the inhabitants put to the sword. Another colony of these people, known by the name of the Zaparovian Cossacks, who settled about the falls of the river Nieper, or Borysthenes, declared for Mazeppa, when their brethren of the Ukraine were afraid to stir. Three thousand followed his fortune to Bender, and engaged in the service of Sweden: the rest were cut in pieces.</P>
<P>The Samoiedes and Laplanders shall be de∣scribed in their proper places.</P>
<P>The empire of Russia, including all these dif∣ferent nations, is not supposed to contain above seven millions of souls, the bulk of which number is composed by the native Russians; a people whom we shall now endeavour to describe.</P>
<P>The Russians are stigmatized by their neigh∣bours as an ignorant brutal people, totally resigned to sloth, and addicted to drunkenness, even in the most beastly excess: nay, they are accused of being arbitrary, perfidious, inhuman, and destitute of every social virtue. The severity of the country they inhabit, their want of letters, polity, and commercial intercourse, joined to the despotism of their government, and the tyranny of the grandees, may doubtless have an unhappy effect on the dis∣positions and morals of the people, which, how∣ever, have been meliorated and improved by the care, assiduity, and example of some of their late sovereigns. Certain it is, the vice of drunkenness was so universally prevalent among them, that Peter I. was obliged to restrain it by very severe edicts, which however have not produced much effect. They numbered in the city of Moscow no fewer than four thousand brandy-shops, in which the inhabitants used to sot away their time in drink∣ing strong liquors, and smoaking tobacco. This last practice became so dangerous among persons, in the most beastly state of intoxication, that a very
<PB N="305" REF="3180"/>
severe law was found necessary to prevent the per∣nicious consequences, otherwise the whole city might have been consumed by conflagrations.</P>
<P>The Muscovites boast of their being descended from the Greeks, though they have no good rea∣son to give in support of this pretension. The nobility were heretofore very powerful, each com∣manding a great number of vassals, whom they ruled with the most despotic and barbarous autho∣rity: but their possessions have been gradually cir∣cumscribed, and their power transferred in a great measure to the Czar, on whom they are now wholly dependant. At present there is no other degree of the nobility, but that of the boyars: these are admitted to the council, and from among them the waivodes, governors, and other great officers, are nominated. A Russian boyar is very proud of being corpulent, believing that nothing gives such a dignified air as does a broad face, or portly belly. Their surnames are no other than patronimics: for examples, the son of Alexis calls himself Alexio∣witz. They formerly wore long beards, and long robes, with strait sleeves dangling down to their ancles: their collars and shirts were generally wrought with silk of different colours: in lieu of hats, they covered their heads with furred caps; and, instead of shoes, wore red or yellow leathern buskins. The dress of the women nearly re∣sembled that of the other sex, with this difference, that their garments were more loose, their caps fantastical, and their shift-sleeves three or four ells in length, gathered up in folds from the shoulder to the fore-arm. By this time, however, the French fashions prevail among the better sort throughout all Muscovy.</P>
<P>The common people are generally tall, healthy, and robust, patient of cold and hunger, inured to hardship, and remarkably capable of bearing the
<PB N="306" REF="3190"/>
most sudden transition from the extremes of hot or cold weather. Nothing is more customary than to see a Russian, who is over-heated and sweating at every pore, strip himself naked, and plunge into a river: nay, when their pores are all opened in the hot bath, to which they have daily recourse, they either practise this immersion, or subject themselves to a discharge of some pailfuls of cold water. This is the custom both of men and wo∣men, who enter the baths promiscuously, and ap∣pear naked to each other, without scruple or hesi∣tation.</P>
<P>A Russian will subsist for many days upon a little oatmeal and water, and even raw roots: an onion is a regale; but the food they generally use in their journeys is a kind of rye-bread, cut into small square pieces, and dried again in the oven: these, when they are hungry, they soak in water, and eat as a very comfortable repast. Both sexes are re∣markably healthy and robust, and accustom them∣selves to sleep every day after dinner.</P>
<P>The Russian women are remarkably fair, comely, strong, and well-shaped, obedient to their lordly husbands, and patient under discipline: they are even said to be fond of correction, which they con∣sider as an infallible mark of their husbands con∣jugal affection; and they pout and pine if it be with-held, as if they thought themselves treated with contempt and disregard. Of this neglect, however, they have very little cause to complain; the Russian husband is so very well disposed, by nature and inebriation, to exert his arbitrary power. Some writers observe, that, on the wedding-day, the bride presents the bridegroom with a whip of her own making, in token of submission; and this he fails not to employ as the instrument of his au∣thority. Very little ceremony is here used in match-making, which is the work of the parents.
<PB N="307" REF="3200"/>
Perhaps the bridegroom never sees the woman, un∣til he is joined to her for life. The marriage being proposed, and agreed to, the lady is examined, stark naked, by a certain number of her female relations; and if they find any bodily defect, they endeavour to cure it by their own skill and expe∣rience. This is a very wise and laudable custom, which, if it prevailed in other parts of Europe, would prevent many unhappy marriages. The bride, on her wedding-day, is crowned with a gar∣land of wormwood, implying the bitterness that often attends the married state: when the priest has tied the nuptial knot at the altar, his clerk or sexton throws upon her head an handful of hops, wishing that she may prove as fruitful as the plant thus scattered. She is muffled up, and led home by a certain number of old women, the parish∣priest carrying the cross before; while one of his subalterns, in a rough goat-skin, prays all the way, that she may bear as many children as there are hairs on his garment. The new-married couple, being seated at table, are presented with bread and salt; and a chorus of boys and girls sing the epi∣thalamium, which is always grosly obscene. This ceremony being performed, the bride and bride∣groom are conducted to their own chamber by an old woman, who exhorts the wife to obey her hus∣band, and retires. Then the bridegroom desires the lady to pull off one of his buskins, giving her to understand, that in one of them is contained a whip, and in the other a jewel, or a purse of money. She takes her choice; and if she finds the purse, interprets it into a good omen; whereas should she light on the whip, she construes it into an unhappy presage, and instantly receives a lash, as a specimen of what she has to expect. After they have remained two hours together, they are interrupted by a deputation of old women, who
<PB N="308" REF="3210"/>
come to search for the signs of her virginity: if these are apparent, the young lady ties up her hair, which, before consummation, hung loose over her shoulders; and visits her mother, of whom she demands the marriage-portion. It is generally agreed, that the Muscovite husbands are barbar∣ous, even to a proverb: they not only administer frequent and severe correction to their wives, but sometimes even torture them to death, without being subject to any punishment for the murder. If a woman dies, in consequence of the correction she has received from her husband, the law of Russia interprets it not an offence, but an accident. A tradesman of Moscow has been known to burn his wife to death, by setting fire to a smock which had been soaked in spirits of wine; and no cogni∣zance was taken of the murder. A man some∣times ties up his wife to a beam by the hair of her head, and scourges her to death: but such punish∣ments have been reserved for those who were guil∣ty of adultery or drunkenness, seldom inflicted, and now wholly laid aside. Indeed precautions are commonly taken against such barbarous practices by the marriage-articles, in which the bridegroom obliges himself, under certain penalties, to treat his wife according to her quality, supply her with good and wholsome provision, and to refrain from manual chastisement, either by whipping, boxing, kicking, or scratching. If a woman, provoked by hard usage, takes away the life of her husband, a case that sometimes happens, she is fixed alive in the earth, up to her neck, and in this posture suf∣fered to die of hunger: a punishment incredibly shocking, under which some of those wretched objects languish for several days in the most dread∣ful misery.</P>
<P>The canon law of Muscovy forbids the conjugal commerce on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays;
<PB N="309" REF="3220"/>
and whoever trangresses this law, must bathe him∣self before he enters the church-porch. He that marries a second wife, the first being alive, is not admitted farther than the church-door; and if any man espouses a third, he is excommunicated: so that though bigamy is tolerated, they nevertheless count it infamous. If a woman is barren, the hus∣band generally persuades her to retire into a con∣vent: if fair means will not succeed, he is at li∣berty to whip her into condescension. If, in such a case, the wife had the privilege of demanding a fair scrutiny, perhaps the husband would often ap∣pear impotent, instead of the woman's being found barren. When the Czar, or Emperor, has an inclination for a wife, the most beautiful maidens of the empire are presented to him for his choice.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the arbitrary power and brutal disposition of the Muscovite husbands, the women are said to be very free of their favours, and even to transgress the bounds of conjugal fidelity, in or∣der to incur the resentment of their husbands, when the whip is too sparingly administred. This dis∣cipline took its origin, many centuries ago, among the Scythian Sarmates, the ancestors of the Mus∣covites. These people, going in quest of a better settlement, left their wives under the care of their slaves, and made an irruption into Greece, part of which they subdued. These conquests, however, detained them so long, that the women, despairing of their return, married the slaves, who were strong enough to make head against their masters, when at length they returned from Greece. Both sides were already drawn up in order of battle, when one of the Sarmatians, addressing himself to his fellows, observed, that they should debase them∣selves by using the sword and spear against slaves, whom they had formerly over-awed with the sound of a whip: he therefore proposed, that every man
<PB N="310" REF="3230"/>
should arm himself with this weapon only: the advice was immediately pursued, and they attacked the enemy with scourges. The slaves had been so accustomed to dread this instrument, that they were instantly seized with a panic, and fled with the utmost precipitation. The prisoners were pu∣nished with death, and great part of the women made away with themselves: the rest submitted to fla∣gellation, which was severely exercised. In memory of this event, and as a warning to Muscovite wives, the whip or scourge is the first wedding present, and hung up in the most conspicuous part of the house, that, by presenting itself continually to the good woman's eyes, it may never slip from her re∣membrance.</P>
<P>The education of the Czarowitz, or prince royal, is intrusted to the care of a few persons, by whom he is strictly kept from the eyes of the vulgar, un∣til he hath attained the fifteenth year of his age: then he is publickly exposed in the market-place, that the people, by viewing him attentively, may remember his person, in order to ascertain his iden∣tity; for they have more than once been deceived by impostors.</P>
<P>Such is the slavery in which the Muscovites of both sexes are kept by their parents, their patrons, and the emperor, that they are not allowed to dispute any match that may be provided for them by these directors, howsoever disagreeable or odious it may be. Officers of the greatest rank in the army, both natives and foreigners, have been sad∣dled with wives by the sovereign in this arbitrary manner. A great general, lately deceased, who was a native of Britain, having been pressed by the reigning Czarina to wed one of her ladies, saved himself from a very disagreeable marriage, by pretending his constitution was so unsound,
<PB N="311" REF="3240"/>
that the lady would be irreparably injured by his compliance.</P>
<P>The Muscovites are fond of the bagpipe, and have a kind of violin, with a large belly, like that of a lute: but their musick is very barbarous and defective. Nevertheless there are public schools, in which the children are regularly taught to sing. The very beggars ask alms in a whining cadence and ridiculous sort of recitative. <Q>A Russian am∣bassador at the Hague, having been regaled with the best concert of vocal and instrumental musick that could be procured, was asked how he liked the entertainment, and replied, “Perfectly well: the beggars in my country sing just in the same manner.”</Q> The warlike musick of the Russians consists in kettledrums and trumpets: they like∣wise use hunting-horns; but they are not at all expert in the performance. The Muscovites think it is beneath them to dance; but they call in their Polish or Tartarean slaves to divert them with this exercise, in their hours of dissipation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE, and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Muscovites speak a dialect of the old Scla∣vonic, mixed with barbarisms from the Polish and other languages: but the pure Sclavonic is still retained in their Bibles and Homilies, and even spoken by those who affect to be thought men of letters. The Russians have adopted the Greek characters, which, however, they have corrupted and altered in the shape, and increased the letters to the number of thirty-eight. The whole empire was overwhelmed with the grossest ignorance: in∣deed human learning was in so little request, that the nobility themselves were wholly illiterate; and even the clergy could hardly read their prayers. They had neither university nor school for the in∣struction
<PB N="312" REF="3250"/>
of youth, until Peter, their great re∣former, in some measure dispelled those clouds of ignorance, by inviting foreigners into his domi∣nions, encouraging the liberal arts and sciences, obliging his nobles to send their sons to more civi∣lized countries for their improvement, and insti∣tuting academies and seminaries in Moscow and Petersburg. These steps were so contrary to the natural disposition of the Muscovites, that no other prince could have taken them with any prospect of success. Nay, since the death of this great man, they seem returning to their old bigotry. Fo∣reigners are discouraged at the court of Peters∣burg; a gaudy tinsel pomp is substituted in the room of real grandeur and magnificence; little or no progress has been made in prosecuting the wise plans projected by the czar Peter; and perhaps the whole nation will relapse into its pristine barbarity: though such a relapse can hardly happen, consider∣ing the great commerce with different nations which must necessarily be carried on at Petersburg, and other Russian ports in the Baltic.</P>
<P>The Russians were converted to the christian religion towards the latter end of the tenth cen∣tury, by a bishop and some ecclesiastics, sent with a grand embassy by Basilius, emperor of Constan∣tinople, to Voldomir, duke of Russia. Since that period they have confessed the articles of the Greek church, mingled with certain superstitious cere∣monies of their own. They do not believe in transubstantiation, purgatory, or the pope's infal∣libility, or supremacy: they use auricular confes∣sion, communicate in both kinds, adopt the Atha∣nasian creed, and adhere to the established liturgy of St. Basil. They worship the Virgin Mary, and other saints, and pay their adorations to crosses and reliques. They observe four great fasts in the year, during which they taste neither fish, flesh,
<PB N="313" REF="3260"/>
nor any animal production: they will not drink after a man who has eaten flesh, nor use a knife that has cut meat in less than twenty-four hours after it has been used; nor will they, even though their health is at stake, touch any thing in which hartshorn, or any animal substance, has been in∣fused. While this kind of Lent continues, they subsist upon cabbage, cucumbers, and rye-bread, drinking nothing stronger than a sort of small beer, called quassi. They likewise fast every Wednesday and Friday. Their common penance is to abstain from every species of food and drink, but bread, salt, cucumbers, and water. They are ordered to bend their bodies, and continue in that painful posture, and, between whiles, to strike their heads against an image.</P>
<P>The Muscovites, at all times, reject as impure horseflesh, elk, veal, hare, rabbit, ass's milk, mare's milk, Venice treacle, because the flesh of vipers is an ingredient, and every thing that contains even the smallest quantity of musk, civer, and castor; yet they have no aversion to swine's flesh: on the contrary, the country produces excellent bacon. Six thousand flitches were consumed in one of the Czar's magazines, which was burned by accident.</P>
<P>The Russians celebrate fifteen grand festivals in the year. On Palm-sunday there is a magnificent procession, at which the Czar assists in person and on foot. He is apparelled in cloath of gold: his train is borne up by the prime of the nobility, and he is attended by his whole court. He is imme∣diately preceded by the officers of his houshold, one of whom carries his handkerchief on his arm, lying upon another of the richest embroidery. He halts at a sort of platform of free-stone, where, turning to the east, and bending his body almost
<PB N="314" REF="3270"/>
double, he pronounces a short prayer: then he proceeds to the church of Jerusalem, where he re∣news his devotion. This exercise being performed, he returns to his palace, the bridle of the patri∣arch's horse resting upon his arm. The horse's head, being covered with white linnen, is held by some nobleman; while the patriarch, sitting side∣ways, and holding a cross in his hand, distributes benedictions as he moves along: on his head he wears a cap edged with ermine, adorned with loops and buttons of gold, and precious stones: before him are displayed banners of consecrated stuff, in a variety of colours. Above five hundred priests walk in the procession; those who are near the patriarch bearing pictures of the Virgin Mary, richly ornamented with gold, jewels, and pearls, together with crosses, reliques, and religious books, including a copy of the Gospels, which they reckon to be of inestimable value. In the midst of this procession is borne a triumphal arch, and on the top an apple-tree covered with fruit, which several little boys, inclosed in the machine, endea∣vour to gather. The lawyers and laity carry branches of willow, the guards and the spectators prostrate themselves on the ground, while the pro∣cession halts; and, after the ceremony, the patri∣arch presents a purse of an hundred rubles to the Czar, who perhaps invites him to dine at his table. <Q>During the season of Easter the whole empire is filled with mirth and rejoicing: at meeting they say, “Christ is risen;”</Q> <Q>and the answer is, “Yea, he is risen.”</Q> They present one another with eggs, finely painted: such are the presents made by the patriarch to those persons, of the first qua∣lity, who have the honour to kiss his hand on this solemn occasion. Their mirth and rejoicing, how∣ever, never fails to degenerate into heat and de∣bauchery:
<PB N="315" REF="3280"/>
even the ladies may indulge themselves with strong liquors, to intoxication, without scan∣dal. <Q>When a lady sends to inquire concerning the health of her guests, whom she entertained over∣night, the usual reply is, “I thank your mistress for her good cheer: by my troth, I was so merry that I don't remember how I got home.”</Q></P>
<P>During these carnivals a great number of people, in reeling home drunk, fall down and perish among the snow. It is even dangerous to relieve a person thus overtaken; for, should he die, the person who endeavoured to assist him is called before the judge, and generally pays dear for his charity.</P>
<P>The Muscovite priests use exorcisms at the ad∣ministration of baptism. They plunge the child three times over head and ears in water, and give it the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in one spe∣cies, until it hath attained the age of seven; after which the child is indulged with it in both kinds. They likewise administer the sacrament to dying persons, together with Extreme Unction; and, if this be neglected, the body is denied christian burial. Soon as the person expires, the body is deposited in a coffin, with a luncheon of bread, a pair of shoes, some few pieces of money, and a certificate signed by the parish-priest, and directed to St. Nicholas, who is one of their great patrons. They likewise hold St. Andrew in great veneration, and ridiculously pretend they were converted by him to Christianity. But, next to St. Nicholas, they adore St. Anthony of Padua, who is supposed to have sailed upon a mill-stone through the Medi∣terranean and Atlantic, and over the lakes Ladoga and Onega, as far as Novogorod. Every house is furnished with an image of St. Nicholas, carved in the most rude and fantastic manner; <Q>and when it becomes old and worm-eaten, the owner either throws it into the river with a few pieces of coin,
<PB N="316" REF="3290"/>
saying, “Adieu, Brother;”</Q> or returns it to the maker, who accommodates him with a new image for a proper consideration. The good women are very careful in adorning their private St. Nicholases with rich cloaths and jewels; but, on any emer∣gency, these are resumed, and the saint left as naked as he came from the hands of the carpenter.</P>
<P>There are monasteries in Russia; but neither the monks nor the nuns are subject to severe restric∣tions. The friars are either horse-jockeys, or trade in hops, wheat, and other commodities: the sisters are at liberty to go abroad when they please, and indulge themselves in all manner of freedoms.</P>
<P>Heretofore liberty of conscience was denied, and every convicted heretick was committed to the flames; but since the reign of Peter all religions and sects are tolerated throughout the empire. Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Arme∣nians, Jews, and Mahometans, enjoy the free ex∣ercise of their respective forms of worship: though it was not without great difficulty, and by dint of extraordinary solicitation from different powers, that the Romish religion was allowed. Peter, knowing the dangerous tenets of a religion that might set the spiritual power of the pope at va∣riance with the temporal power of the emperor, and being well acquainted with the meddling ge∣nius of its professors, held out for some time against the intercession of Germany, France, and Poland; and though at length he yielded to their joint interposition, he would by no means suffer any jesuit to enter his dominions.</P>
<P>The government of the church of Russia was formerly vested in a patriarch, archbishops, and bishops; and this patriarch was ordained by him of Constantinople, till about the latter end of the sixteenth century, when Hieronymo, patriarch of Constantinople, having been degraded by the Greek
<PB N="317" REF="3300"/>
clergy for his scandalous morals, repaired to Mos∣cow. There, in consideration of a sum of money offered to him by the czar Theodore Iwanowitz, he resigned his patriarchal dignity to Jacob, metro∣politan of Russia. He, in the church of the blessed Virgin, after a laboured harangue, delivered the staff and tiara to Jacob in public; and afterwards confirmed this transaction by a writing under his own hand and seal, which was carefully deposited among the archives of the cathedral. As Hiero∣nymo had been formally and legally degraded, he had no right to convey a dignity of which he was no longer possessed: nevertheless, the Czar payed the price he demanded, in order to save to his sub∣jects a considerable sum of money, which was an∣nually remitted to Constantinople, by way of ec∣clesiastical tribute: he accordingly authenticated the election of Jacob, and the Russian clergy ac∣quiesced in the alteration. Since that period they have acknowledged none but their own patriarch. Besides the patriarch, there were four archbishops; one of Novogorod Veliki, another of Rostow, a third of Casan, and a fourth at Scarscow. This hierarchy was, in effect, equal to the papal power in the Muscovite dominions, and therefore gave umbrage to Peter the Great; who, upon the death of the last incumbent, declared that no other pre∣late should be raised to that dignity, but that he himself would be supreme head of the Russian church. Such violent opposition was made to this scheme, that Peter, in order to intimidate the clergy, ordered the metropolitan of Resan to de∣grade one of the bishops; and this sacrifice terri∣fied the rest into compliance. The Czar, in con∣sequence of the character he assumed, began forth∣with to reform his clergy, who were grosly igno∣rant. Instead of preaching to their congregations, they used to read short homilies of the Greek saints,
<PB N="318" REF="3310"/>
sing a psalm or hymm, and conclude the service with the Athanasian creed and the Litany. Peter introduced learning into the church; obliged the illiterate to study, and every beneficed ecclesiastic to preach sermons of his own composing. Their churches are built in the Greek fashion, and adorned with pictures. Image-worship was formerly al∣lowed; but now is counted idolatry: neither genu∣flexion before images, nor the use of musical in∣struments, is permitted in the church of Russia. Every priest is distinguished by the name of Papa, or Father: he keeps the crown of his head always close shaven, lets his beard grow, wears a red leather cap on his head, and two stripes of stuff pinned or tacked on each side of the breast. He is allowed to wed one woman; but, should he sur∣vive her, he must lead the rest of his life in a state of widowhood. In consequence of this regulation, the priest's wife is commonly used with great ten∣derness.</P>
<P>The Samoiedes, who inhabit the coasts of the Frozen Ocean, are a kind of Tartars, not unlike the Laplanders whom we have described in our account of Sweden. They are clad in the skins of rein-deer, subsist by hunting and fishing, and are ignorant, superstitious, and brutal. These, with the other Tartars who live under the Russian dominion, shall be taken notice of in their proper places.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>GOVERNMENT and LAWS.</HEAD>
<P>The government of Russia is meer despotism. The whole empire is ruled by the arbitrary will and pleasure of the sovereign, who is stiled the Czar, a title which is probably a corruption of Cae∣sar. Heretofore he was styled Grand Duke of Muscovy: but since the reign of Peter he is dig∣nified with the appellation of Emperor of Russia.
<PB N="319" REF="3320"/>
He is absolute lord, not only of all the estates in the empire, but also of the lives of his subjects: the greatest <HI>knez,</HI> or noblemen, call themselves his <HI>galopes,</HI> or slaves, and execute his commands with the most implicit obedience. The common people revere him as something supernatural: they never mention his name, or any thing immediately be∣longing to him, without marks of the most pro∣found respect and awful veneration. <Q>A man ask∣ing a carpenter, at work upon one of the Czar's warehouses, what the place was intended for, an∣swered, “None but God and the Czar knows.”</Q></P>
<P>The nobility of Russia were formerly rich and powerful, and ruled despotically over their infe∣riors: but their wealth and influence are now swal∣lowed up by the importance and authority of the crown, and they are become venal dependants on the government. The Czar appoints waivodes, or governors of provinces; and bestows all offices of consequence, whether ecclesiastical, civil, or military. In a word, he is vested with the whole legislative and executive power, and all his subjects are slaves, existing at his will.</P>
<P>The people of Russia are distinguished into three degrees; namely, the nobility, called knez, or kneas; the gentry, known by the name of duor∣nins; and the peasants. The knez, or dukes, were antiently the palatines of Russia, who exer∣cised supreme power, each in his own territory, as an independent prince; but all of them either submitted, or were subdued by the princes of Vol∣domir, who translated their residence to Moscow, and assumed the title of Weliki Kneas, or Great Duke. The descendants of these noblemen still retain their antient appellation, though many of them are reduced to the most abject poverty and contempt. In the beginning of this century above three hundred knez served as common troopers in
<PB N="320" REF="3330"/>
the regiment of dragoons commanded by prince Menzikoff. The czar Peter introduced the titles of Count and Prince of the Empire, and instituted an order of kinghthood in honour of St. Andrew, distinguished by a blue ribbon and star, in imita∣tion of the Garter. The Duormins are country gentlemen, who generally hold their lands by knight's service; and, in time of war, are obliged to appear in arms on horseback. Those are the most happy who live at the greatest distance from court, because there they may enjoy their estates, unknown and unmolested. In general, they are extremely insolent and oppressive to the peasants, and meanly submissive to the nobility.</P>
<P>All the peasants in the empire are considered as immediate slaves belonging to the Czar, to the boyars, or to the monasteries. The value of estates is computed not by the extent or quality of the land, but from the number of those peasants, who may be sold, alienated, or given away, at the plea∣sure of their masters. The number of these hus∣bandmen, whether living in villages, or in the open country, being known, the Czar, by re∣quiring a certain proportion of each lord or pro∣prietor, can raise three hundred thousand men in less than forty days.</P>
<P>The administration is managed by a grand coun∣cil, called Dumnoy Boyaren, or Council of the Boyars, who are the grandees of the empire, and act as privy counsellors. To this are subservient six inferiors chambers and courts of judicature, provided each with a president. The first regu∣lates every thing relating to ambassadors, and fo∣reign negotiations: the second takes cognizance of military affairs: the third manages the public revenues of the empire: the business of the fourth is to encourage, protect, and improve trade and
<PB N="321" REF="3340"/>
commerce. The two last hear and determine in all causes, whether civil or criminal.</P>
<P>Peter divided the empire into the eight govern∣ments of Mosco, Archangel, Asoph, Casan, and Astracan, Chioff and the Ukraine, Siberia, Livo∣nia, comprehending Ingria, Plescow, and Novo∣gorod, Smolensko, and Veronitz. The governors or waivodes were vested with power to dispose of all employments, civil and military, and receive the revenues. They were directed to defray all expences in their respective governments, and send a certain yearly sum to the great treasury. In a word, they enjoyed absolute power in every thing but what related to the regular troops, which, though quartered in their jurisdiction, were neither payed nor directed by them, but received their orders immediately from the Czar or his generals.</P>
<P>The decision of causes heretofore depended upon the opinion and equity of the judge; but about the middle of the last century a code of laws was compiled in one volume, intituled, <HI>Sabrona Ulosci∣nia,</HI> signifying, Universal Law; and according to this the sentences are now regulated.</P>
<P>Besides these tribunals, there is an inferior court of judicature, or process, established in every pro∣vince, having a president, chancellor, and secre∣tary or diack. The law-suits are neither tedious nor expensive, as all the proceedings are summary: but the judge is very seldom incorruptible; and, unless he is tampered with before-hand, the plain∣tiff generally obtains the sentence in his favour.</P>
<P>Few crimes are capital in Russia: murder may be atoned by paying a sum of money; nay, the civil magistrate takes no cognizance of murder, without having previously received information at the suit of some individual. No man can be con∣victed of a capital crime, except upon his own confession: but the means used to extort that con∣fession
<PB N="322" REF="3350"/>
are such as human nature can hardly resist. The prisoner undergoes the scourge, the strappado, and the knout; which last is a punishment in∣flicted with a thong of a buffalo's hide, managed in such a manner, that the executioner can either cut the scarf-skin only, or this and the skin toge∣ther, or skin, muscles, and membranes to the bone, just as he is commanded. The most severe in∣fliction of this punishment is denominated the Pine: the patient is suspended by his two arms, pulled up behind, until the shoulder-joints are dis∣located; and, in this situation of unutterable pain, is flead with the knout from the neck to the loins. If the wretched caitiff bears these tortures without confessing, his fleshy parts are seared or pierced with red-hot irons: nay, his bones are scorched, and his muscles broiled over a slow fire. Should he still persist in denying the charge, molten lead is poured upon his bare head; and thus the wretch expires.</P>
<P>Traitors, after having undergone the most se∣vere tortures, are sometimes sent to Siberia with∣out their eyes and ears, and often left to perish on the road.</P>
<P>A coiner is sentenced to swallow the molten metal of the coin which he counterfeited.</P>
<P>Hanging was formerly prohibited in Russia, from a notion that the soul, being forced through the fundament, could not escape that way without being defiled: but that objection is now over∣ruled, and the Russians are hanged occasionally, like their neighbours. The criminal is obliged to fasten the noose about his own neck, and to fling himself off, at the command of the executioner.</P>
<P>The punishment decreed against robbers, thieves, and those guilty of common crimes, is scourg∣ing. Neither sodomy nor beastiality were deemed capital crimes in Russia, before the reign of Peter.
<PB N="323" REF="3360"/>
These abominable vices were grown to such a pitch of shameless brutality, that people did not scruple to practise them even in the open day.</P>
<P>Every lord or master has a right to inflict the batogs on his servant: this punishment consists in stretching the offender naked on the ground, and causing him to be beaten with sticks by two of his fellows. The inferior officers of state are some∣times punished in this manner, by their superiors, for little frauds and misdemeanours; and this cor∣rection is administered arbitrarily, without any form of trial.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COMMERCE, COIN, REVENUE, and STRENGTH of RUSSIA.</HEAD>
<P>The Russians drive a considerable traffick with different nations, both of Asia and Europe. One of the most considerable articles is the iron manu∣facture, in its different branches of cast cannon, mortars, bombs, anchors, and small arms. They have likewise at Petersburg large magazines of naval stores, leather, tallow, and pot-ashes. The southern parts furnish great quantities of caviar: the north-eastern provinces supply plenty of sper∣ma ceti, sea-horses teeth, isinglass, and train-oil; and Russia produces an infinite number of the best furs in the world, together with abundance of honey, castor, rhubarb, and some other drugs.</P>
<P>At the port of Petersburg a thousand ships are loaded yearly, by foreigners, with the commodi∣ties produced in the northern parts of this great empire. But the Muscovites likewise carry on a considerable commerce by land with China and the East Indies for gold, silk, tea, and porcelaine. The court monopolizes this trade, and imports these commodities by caravans of camels.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="3370"/>
With respect to the revenue of Russia, it conti∣nually fluctuates according to the increase of com∣merce, or the pleasure of the Czar, who has all the wealth of the empire at his disposal. He mo∣nopolizes all the best furs, the mines, minerals, and trade by land to the East Indies: he farms out all the tobacco, wine, brandy, beer, mead, and other liquors; the inns, taverns, public houses, baths, and sweating houses. The customs upon merchandize, the imposts upon corn, and toll ex∣acted from cities, towns, and villages, are very con∣siderable. He possesses demesnes to a very great value: he inherits the effects of all those that die intestate, or under accusation of capital crimes: he derives a duty from all law-suits; and, to sum up the whole, can command the fortunes of all his subjects. All these articles, added together, are said to produce about three millions sterling: but then the intrinsic value of money is at least three times greater in Muscovy than in England. The czar Peter seized the lands of the church, and an∣nexed them to his own demesnes; but the greater part was restored in the sequel. As for the lands belonging to the dignity and office of patriarch, they were distributed among the monasteries and nobility.</P>
<P>The standing army of Russia is computed at two hundred and fifty thousand men: besides these, the Russians can assemble a body of forty thousand irregulars, Calmucks, Cossacks, and other Tar∣tars, who live under their dominion. But the number may be doubled on any emergency. The Czarina has likewise a considerable fleet in the Bal∣tic, amounting to about thirty ships of the line; and a great number of formidable gallies, frigates, fire-ships, and bomb-ketches. This, however, is at present in very indifferent order.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="3380"/>
The coins peculiar to Russia are these: the cher∣vonitz, a piece of gold, equal in value to a ducat; the ruble, a silver coin, valued at four shillings and six-pence; the half and quarter ruble; and the copec, or penny. Rixdollars are likewise cur∣rent through this whole empire.</P>
<P>The Russians compute their roads by wersts, one of which is equal to about two thirds of an English mile. Their commodities are weighed by lotes and poods: two and thirty lotes are equal to one pound: forty pounds constitute one pood, and sixty-three poods make one tun: but the English hundred weight generally amounts to one hundred and twenty-three Russian pounds and a half.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REFORMATIONS effected by the CZAR PETER.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Russia being overspread with forests, lakes, rivers, fens, marshes, and moun∣tains, and the ground covered with ice or snow for three parts of the year, travelling was equally dif∣ficult and dangerous. The accommodations were very bad, and very scarce, on account of the great distance between towns and villages: the roads were almost impassable: the traveller ran the risque of being frozen to death, of perishing by wild beasts, by water, and precipices, in the winter; and in the summer was so annoyed by the venom∣ous insects, which breed in the stagnating waters, that nothing could be more dreadful than a long journey. Peter, sensible of these inconveniences, ordered the roads to be mended; caused posts to be fixed at the end of every mile, inscribed with proper directions; built houses of entertainment at proper distances, and improved the carriages or vehicles in which people travel from one city to another. This is a kind of coach, fixed upon a
<PB N="326" REF="3390"/>
sledge, drawn by horses with such dispatch, that a man may travel four hundred miles in three days. The coach is provided with a kind of couch, on which the traveller may repose himself: the horses are changed every fifteen miles; and the vehicle proceeds, night and day, from one end of the jour∣ney to the other. Sometimes these sleds are drawn upon the ice by rein-deer.</P>
<P>Commodities are either conveyed from one place to another by navigable lakes, rivers, and canals, or upon larger sledges drawn by horses and dro∣medaries; or, lastly, carried on the backs of these animals.</P>
<P>Peter, having travelled through other countries for his improvement, not only civilized his people, as we have already observed, by encouraging arts and sciences, inviting foreigners into his domi∣nions, instituting academies, schools, and semina∣ries for youth; building a navy, promoting navi∣gation, and extending commerce: but moreover disciplined his army, which, before his time, was the contempt of his neighbours, until at length it became a match for the most warlike forces in Eu∣rope. There was indeed, in former reigns, no standing corps in his dominions, except the Czar's guards, a body of twenty thousand men entertained at Moscow, under the name of <HI>strelitzes,</HI> resembling the janizaries of Constantinople in their power, in∣solence, and ferocity. A particular quarter was assigned to them at Moscow, and they enjoyed other privileges that were grievous to the people: they committed violence and outrages with impu∣nity: they engaged in cabals; they broke out into mutiny and sedition. In a word, they became so ungovernable, licentious, and intolerable, that Pe∣ter suppressed them by dint of force, and insti∣tuted a new body of guards, which he and his successors have taken care to restrain within the
<PB N="327" REF="3400"/>
limits of proper discipline. One of the greatest enterprizes which this monarch undertook was the canal of Woronitz, dug between the rivers Don and Wolga, through which the navigation or water-carriage might have been extended above a thousand miles through his dominions, and a com∣munication opened between the Baltic, Euxine, and Caspian seas: but this vast work was inter∣rupted, and, for that time, frustrated by the Na∣gayan Tartars, who then possessed the kingdom of Astracan, as well as by the continual wars and avo∣cations in which the emperor was engaged. Con∣siderable progress was made in this canal by Capt. Perry, an English engineer, who was but ill re∣warded for his trouble.</P>
<P>Such was the vigour of mind and perseverance with which this great reformer prosecuted his plans of improvement, that a squadron of ships of war was here built, in the middle of his dominions, and sent down the river Don or Tanais into the Euxine sea, after he had made himself master of the Palus Moeotis.</P>
<P>Peter's reformation descended even to the dress of his subjects. Instead of the conical caps lined with fur, the long beards and gowns, which they wore in imitation of the Asiatics, he obliged them to shave their beards, and wear their garments in the European fashion. This reformation he began and carried on with circumstances of good humour and ridicule, which proved much more palatable and effectual than an arbitrary command. He first of all persuaded the boyars or grandees, and military officers, to imitate his own example in wearing cloaths made in the English fashion: then he caused a suit, in the same mode, to be hung up as a pattern at every gate of the city, and published an edict, that every person passing through these gates with long garments, should either pay a se∣vere fine, or allow their coats to be curtailed on
<PB N="328" REF="3410"/>
the spot: an operation which was often performed, and occasioned abundance of mirth. He more∣over instituted masquerades and mock processions, in which the courtiers of both sexes appeared in the ancient garb, decked out with ludicrous exag∣gerations and extravagancies, which soon brought it into contempt. It was not, however, without the utmost reluctance that the Russians resigned their beards, for which they entertained a religious kind of veneration.</P>
<P>The Russian aera used to be the creation of the world, which they supposed to have been fifteen hundred years more early than it is fixed by other nations: they likewise began the year with Sep∣tember, alledging, it was more probable that God created the earth in autumn, when it was stored with fruits in full maturity, than in March, when it was covered with snow. The Czar, however, compelled them to adopt the Roman calculation, tho' this was not introduced without great difficulty; for his people were very tenacious of their antient customs.</P>
<P>This celebrated hero and legislator, who assumed the title of Imperial Majesty, and justly acquired the appellation of Peter the Great, died at Petersburgh in the year 1725, leaving the crown to his empress Catherine, who had been the widow of a serjeant.</P>
<P>The succession to the throne of Russia has been always counted lineal; though the next heir of blood has been often set aside by the arbitrary will of the Czar, the intrigues of the nobles, or the rebellions of the people.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The only natural curiosity in this empire, which deserves particular notice, is the boranets, or plant, resembling a lamb, that grows in the neighbour∣hood of Astracan, Casan, Samara, and in some other provinces. This vegetable is covered with
<PB N="329" REF="3420"/>
a skin that bears white curled wool, which skin the natives dress like tanned leather, and use it for lining to waistcoats. The bears and hares, and other animals that grow white in the winter, are generally numbered among the rarities of Russia; but they are not peculiar to this empire. We might likewise take notice of the vast lakes, and the enormous size of the pike, trout, sturgeon, and belluga, which they contain: but curiosities of this nature have been already described in our accounts of other countries.</P>
<P>Among the rarities of art, we reckon the cathe∣dral at Moscow, the great bell, the city of Peters∣burgh, the canal between the Wolga and the Don, the communication by water from Petersburg to Moscow, and the great road between these cities, projected and partly finished by Peter, running, for a tract of four hundred and eighty-seven miles, through forests and morasses, over hills and moun∣tains, being a surprising causeway of timber. But, perhaps, the greatest curiosity that Muscovy ever produced was the character of the Czar, in all re∣spects the object of our admiration.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>POLITICAL INTERESTS.</HEAD>
<P>The late empress (Elizabeth) of Russia, com∣miserating the state of her sister empress queen of Hungary, and seduced by French promises and politics, joined with the houses of Austria and Bourbon against Great Britain and Prussia. Her arms undoubtedly turned the scale of war against his Prussian majesty; and unless her death had not happened so critically as it did, it is hard to say what might have been the event.</P>
<P>Her successor, the late emperor Peter the Third, broke off the unnatural alliance, and notwith∣standing his unhappy fate, which was partly owing to his connections with Prussia, his plan of conduct
<PB N="330" REF="3430"/>
has since been adopted and improved by his wife, the present empress. She has particularly attached herself to the friendship of Great Britain, as the only means of supplying the deficiency of her finances by cultivating the commerce of her dominions, which must be always safe, when protected by the British marine. She has laid out many great plans for the civilization, as well as aggrandizement of her empire; but though she is naturally magnifi∣cent, she is obliged to be frugal, in order to put them into execution. Though she is at a considerable expence upon her navy, and though perhaps it is superior to that either of Denmark or Sweden, yet the genius of her people does not seem to incline towards maritime affairs; for it has been observed that she has many sailors, but few seamen. She acts a capital part in the present distractions of Poland, the crown of which she not only bestowed upon its present possessor, but still keeps it on his head, in which it is thought she will be assisted by his Prussian majesty. Upon the whole, as to her political inter∣ests, she has nothing to dread but from Great Britain.</P>
<P>The trade carried on between Moscow and China is of very little consequence to Russia, considering the vast length of land-carriage, the great expence and slow return, the nature of the commodities imported, and the danger to which the caravans are exposed from rivers, sands, deserts, and Tartarean robbers. A commerce settled with Persia over the Caspian sea, from Astracan and Derbent, would be much more easy, safe, expeditious, and profitable.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have only spoken of the Russians in general, without particularizing the different na∣tions and tribes that inhabit this vast empire, ex∣cept those of the country of Livonia, which we have described in the article of SWEDEN, and the inhabitants of Muscovite Lapland, who are the same people of whom we have treated in our ac∣count of SWEDISH LAPLAND. It will now be pro∣per
<PB N="331" REF="3440"/>
to give a more particular detail of the pro∣vinces that constitute the great empire of the Russias.</P>
<P>Western Muscovy is comprehended in the two and twenty provinces of Pleskow, or Pskow, Great Novogorod Veleki, Twere, Rzeva, or Reschow, Biela, or Bielski, Smolensko, Severia, Czernichow, Vorotin, Rezan, Bielgorod, Mordoa, Nisi-novogo∣rod, Volodimer, Susdal, Moscow, Rostow, Yero∣slawla, Bilejesora, or Belozero, Vologda, Cargapol, and Dwina.</P>
<P>Pleskow, or Pskow, formerly a republic, and afterwards a dutchy, lies between Novogorod on the east, Ingria and Estonia on the north, Livonia on the west, and the palatinate of Polockz on the south. In the sixteenth century it was subdued by Iwan Basilowitz. The country is tolerably fertile, and remarkable for the lake of Pleskow, which empties itself into that of Peibus. The capital, of the same name, seated on the mouth of the river Muldaw, is a metropolitan see, populous, and con∣siderable, divided into four quarters, each sur∣rounded with its own walls, and the whole secured by a strong castle, situated on a high rock, almost inaccessible. The other principal towns of this district are Abdova, Petzar, Ostrova, Fieburgh, Voronecks, and Postarzova. There is nothing re∣markable in these and some other paultry places of this lordship, except the fortifications, which are kept in repair for the security of the frontier.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Novogorod Veleki, lying to the eastward of Pleskow, is divided into five districts, watered by four lakes and sixteen rivers. In the southern part we meet with the famous lake Ilmen, issuing in the river Wolohawa, which runs through part of this province into the lake Ladoga. The country of Novogorod Veleki, extending about one hundred and fifty miles in length, produces corn,
<PB N="332" REF="3450"/>
hemp, flax, leather, honey, and wax; and former∣ly, when governed by its own princes, drove a con∣siderable trade in these commodities; but, in con∣sequence of its subjection to the Czar, its commerce has greatly decayed. Novogorod, the capital, called by the French Neugard, and by the Dutch Newgarten, is a large, populous, and well forti∣fied city, standing on the banks of the Wolohawa: the houses, however, are mean, and all built of wood and timber, and the walls are composed of the same materials. From the ruins of towers, steeples, and old walls, without the circuit of the present city, it appears that the place was once much more magnificent and extensive. <Q>Such was the flourishing condition of Novogorod, that it be∣came proverbial to say, “Who can hurt God and Novogorod?”</Q> But the city sustained many rude shocks from the arms of the Poles, Russians, and other nations. John Basilicus Grotsden, tyrant of Muscovy, made himself master of Novogorod in the year 1477: he afterwards went thither in person, and pillaged the city, from whence he car∣ried to Moscow many hundred waggons loaded with gold, silver, precious stones, rich stuffs, and other valuable moveables: he likewise removed the principal inhabitants to Moscow, and peopled No∣vogorod with Russians. Since it became subject to the czar of Muscovy, its trade and splendour have been greatly diminished. It is, however, the seat of an archbishop, and still carries on a tolerable share of commerce. The cathedral, called St. Sophia, is a spacious beautiful Gothic edifice: the castle, or citadel, on the other side of the river, is joined to the city by a long bridge; over which many thousands of the citizens, including a great number of ecclesiastics, were precipitated into the Wolohawa by command of the tyrant Iwan Basi∣lowitz, on the bare suspicion of an intended revolt.
<PB N="333" REF="3460"/>
Two thousand seven hundred and seventy persons lost their lives in this manner, besides an infinite number of poor wretches that were trodden down or cut in pieces by his cavalry, let loose upon them for this purpose. He pillaged all the churches, and the archbishop's palace: he ordered the me∣tropolitan to be set upon a white horse, with his legs fettered, a cymbal hanging about his neck, and a flagelet in his hand. In this equipage he was conducted to Moscow, and escaped with this affront in lieu of punishment: but all the abbots and monks were either put to the sword, or drowned in the river. At present the vaivode re∣sides in the castle, in the neighbourhood of which appear the archiepiscopal palace, and a monastery dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua. Here like∣wise is another convent, said to have been built on the ruins of an antient temple, dedicated to Perun, the God of Fire, heretofore worshipped in this place under the figure of a Deity weilding a thun∣derbolt. There are besides about an hundred churches, and seventy monasteries, in Novogorod; the roofs and spires of which are covered with gilt copper, so as to exhibit a very dazzling appear∣ance. Novogorod stands about one hundred miles to the southward of Petersburg, and above two hundred to the north-west of Moscow. In a word, Novogorod was once the emporeum of the north, frequented by merchants from all the different parts of Europe. At present it is much diminished both in people and extent, and may be about two leagues in circumference.</P>
<P>The other towns of this district are Staraia, Stara Russa, or Old Russia, standing on the oppo∣site shore of the lake Ilmen, whose outlet is the river Lovat, from the water of which the inha∣bitants make a considerable quantity of salt for ex∣portation; New Russa, situated on the same river;
<PB N="334" REF="3470"/>
Ladoga, standing on the banks of the river Vel∣cova, which falls into the Ladogan lake; Mologa, built at the confluence of the Nissa and Wolga, on the confines of the dutchy of Belozera; and the town of St. Nicholas, a large and populous place, situated near the river Wolga, famous for a stately monastery, dedicated to the saint from whom it derives its name.</P>
<P>Twere is a small dutchy, but fertile and popu∣lous, taking its name from the river Twezza, by which it is watered. It lies to the southward and eastward of Great Novogorod; is bounded on the east by the dutchy of Rostow, on the south by Moscow, and the province of Rzeva. This dutchy was once able to furnish forty thousand horsemen armed, and the like number of infantry, for the service of the Czar. The capital, Twere, stands on the confluence of the Twezza and Wolga, pleasantly situated on a rising ground, about twenty-five leagues to the north-west of Moscow, is large, rich, and populous; an episcopal see, adorned with above threescore stately churches, and provided with a mint for the coinage of money. Upon the same river, and about twenty miles to the northward of Twere, we meet with Tersack, Torsak, or Tarsack, a populous place of consi∣derable extent. The other towns are known by the names of Wolkofkoi, Starica, Prezesta, Olesch∣na Cossia, Sattrite, Geroden al Gorodna, Clin, Mac∣grova, Czornaia Sloboda, and Mitre.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Rzeva, or Reschow, lies to the southward of Twere and of Moscow, and to the northward of Biela and the principality of Vitepsk. The former capital, now called Rzeva the Desert, stood on the western side of the province; but is now abandoned in favour of Rzeva Volodemerski, agreeably situated on the Wolga, at a small dis∣tance from the lake of this name, which is one of
<PB N="335" REF="3480"/>
the sources of the river. The houses are mean; but the place is well peopled, and carries on some commerce in hemp, flax, and fish. It stands on the eastern side of the province, about eighteen leagues to the westward of Moscow. Toropeckz is a small neat town, pleasantly situated on a little river that falls into the Dwina. The other towns of this district are Veliki-Loaki, Borgocove, Bo∣roveo, Zari, Lubiekze, and Dudure, places of very little note or consequence.</P>
<P>The principality of Biela, or Bielski, lies to the southward and westward of Rzeva, to the eastward of Lithuania and the palatinate of Witepetz, and to the northward of Smolensko. It was formerly a dukedom, governed by its own princes, though subject to Lithuania. The capital, Biela, situated on the river Osca, which falls into the Dwina, was a considerable town, until subdued by the czar Basilowitz; but now it is decayed and contemptible in all respects.</P>
<P>The province of Smolensko, extending about two hundred miles from east to west, is commonly stiled the Great Dutchy, or Palatinate. It is bounded on the north by the principality of Biela, on the south by the dutchy of Severia, on the east by Moscow, and on the west by Lithuania, to which it was formerly subject; but it hath shifted masters, and been alternately subdued by the Poles and the Muscovites, until it was finally yielded to the Czar by treaty about the latter end of the last century. The ground of this province, though watered by the Nieper, or Boristhenes, which rises on the north-east border, is generally barren; but it abounds with wild beasts, and their skins yield a good profit. The capital, Smolensko, agreeably seated on the banks of the Nieper, near the con∣fines of Lithuania, is a large, populous, and well fortified city, containing about eight thousand
<PB N="336" REF="3490"/>
houses, generally well built, and surrounded with woods, which produce the best firs in all Musco∣vy. It stands two hundred and ten miles to the westward of Moscow, was formerly a metropolitan, but now is a bishop's see, and is secured with a strong citadel and numerous garrison Dragobusa is the next town of any consequence, situated on the same river, fifteen miles above Smolensko.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Severia, or Severski, lies to the southward of Smolensko, to the eastward of Czer∣nikow, to the northward of Bielgorod, and to the westward of Little Russia. It was formerly pos∣sessed by princes descended of Demetrius, sur∣named the Great; but was wrested from that house by the czar Basilowitz. It afterwards fell into the hands of Sigismund III. king of Poland, who in∣corporated it with his dominions; but was again restored to Muscovy. The province is watered by the rivers Ubick, Dzwina, and Nevin; is fertile and populous, though great part of it is covered with woods. In the southern part of it is a forest, computed to extend an hundred miles square. The chief town is known by the different appellations of Novogrodeck, Novogorod, and Novogorod-Siwerski, or Seefski. It stands on the river Do∣niza, and is well fortified, according to the Russian manner. Branski, or Branszo, is another small, neat, and strong town, situated on the river Dez∣na. Demetriowick stands on the river Ugra, which was once the boundary between Muscovy and Lithuania: it is a place of small import. Such also are Pocksop, Rodohop, Starazangra, Neun, Serspkoi-Gorodoc, Starodub, Serensk, Carakzef, Siesk, Krupuc, and Putiol.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Czernichow, or Czernikow, is bounded on the north and east by Severia and part of Lithuania, and on the west and south by the Nieper and palatinate of Kiow. It extends about
<PB N="337" REF="3500"/>
one hundred and twenty miles in length, and, though watered by the river Dezna, the land is barren and unprofitable. Besides the chief town, called Czernichow, which is neither large nor con∣siderable, there are several paultry places, such as Omby, Perecop, Vibbi, Sosnica, Kwalesin, and Pusia.</P>
<P>The principality of Vorotin, or Vorotinski, is bounded on the north by the river Ugra and part of Rhezan; on the south by the Lesser Tartary, or the land of the Cossacks, to whose incursions it lies so much exposed, that this part of it is almost desolate, though on the other side it is fertile and populous, being watered by the river Occa. On the banks of this river is situated the capital, Vo∣rotin, a small town, secured by a castle, and other fortifications. Bolgoff, Starol, and Cromarc, are strong places, standing on the same river.</P>
<P>The province of Rhezan comprehends a large tract of land, lying between the Don and the Occa, extending near an hundred leagues, and counted by the Russians the most fertile soil in the whole world. According to these, the corn grows so thick and so strong, that a horse can hardly make his way through the stalks. Great plenty and va∣riety of fruits are likewise produced in this pro∣vince. The people are said to be warlike, civi∣lized, and so numerous, that they can, without dif∣ficulty, raise an army of sixty thousand men, horse and infantry, in due proportion. The dutchy is watered by the river Don, or Tanais, which takes its rise within the province, and is increased by several streams, which yield plenty of delicious fish. This country was governed by its own dukes, un∣til subdued by the czar of Muscovy. Rezan, the antient capital, was formerly a large and populous city, advantageously seated on the Occa. This place made a noble resistance against the Tartars,
<PB N="338" REF="3510"/>
by which the whole empire was preserved from ruin, though they at length destroyed the city, and ravaged the whole province. The archiepiscopal see is all that now remains of the grandeur of the antient Rezan. The dispersed inhabitants, assem∣bling together, conveyed the materials of the ruined city to the distance of about eight leagues, and, in conjunction with a great number of people from Peresta, built the new town of Peresta Re∣zanski. But the most considerable town of this dutchy is Voronitz, or Woronitz, commonly called Veronis, situated on a small river of the same name, which falls into the Don, or Tanais. It was here that Peter the Great caused a squadron of ships of war to be built, and hence they were conveyed by the Don into the Black Sea. The town stands on a hill, surrounded with a decayed wooden wall, and is divided into three parts; in one of which, called Jakatoff, the Russian merchants commonly reside. Without the walls there are extensive rope∣walks, and a large subterranean powder-magazine. The declivity of the hill, and the side of the river, are adorned with magnificent houses, belonging to the Russian admirals and persons of distinction. The greater part of these face the citadel, which is joined to the town by a large bridge of communi∣cation. Behind those houses are streets, inhabited by the people employed in ship-building. The town, which stands about sixty-eight leagues to the southward of Moscow, is beautified with several handsome churches, and contains about ten thou∣sand souls. The citadel is a large quadrangular fort, flanked with four towers, instead of bastions, surrounded by a vast fosse and strong pallisadoes, and defended by a numerous garrison. It is fur∣nished with large and numerous apartments for the use of the officers, as well as with warehouses, in which were contained great quantities of naval
<PB N="339" REF="3520"/>
stores. This, indeed, is the chief magazine for this part of Russia, in which about one hundred and fifty pieces of cannon are kept unmounted, for the more speedy carriage. In the neighbour∣hood of the town is a remarkable mountain, cracked in many different places, and almost moul∣dered away. Here we see remains of many antient monuments, and abundance of human bones are scattered on the top, and about the sides of the mountain. Donkarod is a large town, situated about fourteen leagues to the southward of Rezan, near the sources of the Tanais and the Tula, de∣fended by a strong castle, built by order of the czar Basilowitz. The other towns of this province are distinguished by the names of Toul, Czarpa∣cof, Cochira, Michailof, Grematzeff, Pereslanli-Resanski, Tmerscaia, Slobada, Pronesk, Raescol, Tamboff, Costoff, Donco, Lebedan, Talecz, Voro∣necks, Sercot, Bagatsi Satoon, Tzernaca, Ozeri∣staia, Pransi, Epifan, Veretsa, Toula, Caprivora, and Baela.</P>
<P>The province of Bielgorod, formerly known by the name of Organia, lies to the southward of Re∣zan, and to the northward of Nogay and the Don Cossacks: on the east it is bounded by the river Don, and on the west by the Ukraine and palati∣nate of Kiow. Being watered by several streams, and lying under a mild climate, the soil is naturally fertile; but being exposed to the continual inroads of the Don Cossacks, it is neither populous nor well cultivated. This country formerly belonged to these Tartars, from whom it was conquered by the Muscovites: but the inhabitants still retain the customs and manners of the Tartarians, chusing rather to subsist by free-booting than by cultivating the lands, and living sociably in towns or cities. Of these last there is none but the capital, Biel∣gorod, which is a place of very little consideration.
<PB N="340" REF="3530"/>
The smaller towns, of which there is a good num∣ber, are either half ruined, or totally abandoned.</P>
<P>To the northward of Lesser Tartary and Rezan, and to the eastward of Moscow, Volodomir, and Nisinovogorod, lies the province of Mordoa, bounded on the north by the river Wolga. The country is tolerably well cultivated, abounding with forests; and the inhabitants are said to be the most civilized of all Tartarian Muscovy. The chief towns are Adema and Mortima: the people worship one good and one evil principle; the first through love, the other from apprehen∣sion; but they have neither priests nor temples.</P>
<P>The province of Czeremisse, lying to the east∣ward of Mordoa, is a vast tract of land, extending to the length of three hundred miles, and divided by the river Wolga, into the southern and northern districts: the first, adjoining to Mordva, is called Nagornoi, signifying mountainous: the southern is known by the name of Logowai, or Low Land. Here great herds of cattle are bred by the inha∣bitants, who are counted the most savage of all the Tartars. They are faithless, cruel, and supersti∣tious: they have no towns; but live in wretched huts, subsisting on wild honey, the milk of their cattle, and the game they kill in their forests. These people, in general, are ignorant alike of Christianity and Mahometanism, though some of them are said to be Musselmans. They have no idea of a future state; but believe they are rewarded or punished in this, according to their merit or demerit, by the good and evil spirit. They repair to a marshy spot, about forty leagues from Cazan, to pay their devotions in the open fields, and carry offerings to the evil spirit, which is supposed to reside near the brook Shocksheim, which never freezes in the coldest weather: this phaenomenon they impute to the power of that spirit, and will
<PB N="341" REF="3540"/>
not venture to approach the rivulet, though they often see it crossed by the Muscovites. To the supreme Being they sacrifice an horse, an ox, or a ram, roasted and basted with a preparation of honey. They likewise pay adoration to the sun, moon, and stars, and even worship living crea∣tures. Their language is peculiar to themselves, and not understood either by Muscovites or Tar∣tars. They indulge themselves in polygamy, and live in a very brutal manner. The dress of their women consists of a long coarse linnen gown, with a sort of head-dress rising up in the shape of an horn, at the top of which a little bell is suspended by a silken string of various colours. The men wear nearly the same sort of garment, with drawers under it: those that are married shave their heads; for batchelors let their hair grow to a considerable length. This nation is subject to the Czar, in whose armies they are obliged to serve, when re∣quired; but they pay no tribute, except a small voluntary contribution.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Nisi-novogorod, lying to the westward of Casan, and to the eastward of Moscow and Wolodimer, is a large tract of fruitful ground, watered by the Wolga and the Occa, abounding with forests, yet pleasant and populous. The ca∣pital, Nisi-novogorod, Nisen, or Nisen-newgarten, is situated on a rock at the confluence of the Wol∣ga and the Occa, surrounded by a wall of stone, and defended by a strong citadel. Without the stately gate called Iwanofski, near the river∣side, we meet with a spacious bazar, or market, through which we pass into the town: within the gate we enter a noble street, that runs by a gentle ascent through the whole length of the town to the opposite gate Diawetroski, and is intersected by a good number of wooden bridges. The ca∣thedral is a stately edifice, with five cupolas, built
<PB N="342" REF="3550"/>
after the model of Santa Sophia at Constantinople. Every cupola is painted with a green varnish, and adorned on the top with little elegant crosses. Hard by this cathedral stands the archiepiscopal palace, a magnificent stone-building, including a church and spire within its walls. The chancery, the governor's palace, and other houses of note, are large and commodious, but generally built of timber. The city itself is small; but the suburbs, especially those on the river-side, are large and populous containing several churches. The towers that flank the city-walls, the high hill adorned with structures of different kinds, the river covered with barges and trading vessels, concur to form a delightful prospect. What renders the place the more agreeable, there is plenty of good provision, extremely cheap. Four flasks of wine are here sold for twenty pence: a fat lamb may be bought for fourteen pence, two ducks for one penny, and every other article in the same proportion. The city is inhabited by Russians, who avail themselves of this plenty, to eat and drink to the most beastly excess. On holidays both men and women may be seen carousing at tables in the open streets, and great numbers of them lying drunk and asleep in different parts of the city; which stands about five and thirty miles to the eastward of Moscow, though the course by water extends to an hundred. The confluence of the Wolga and the Occa, at this place, forms a body of water about four thousand feet in breadth.</P>
<P>Basiligorod, or Wasiligorod, is a large village, built of wood, on the right shore of the river Wolga, at the foot of a rising ground. It was founded and fortified by the czar Basilius, as a check upon the Tartars; but, since the territories of Russia have been enlarged on that side, the for∣tifications being no longer useful, were suffered to
<PB N="343" REF="3560"/>
fall into decay. The other towns of this province are Slaboda, Pastoff, and Balagna, places of no note or importance.</P>
<P>The province of Wolodimer is bounded by the river Wolga on the north, by Nisi-novogorod on the east, by Moscow on the south, and on the west by the dutchies of Susdal and Rostow. The coun∣try is full of fens and forests, watered by the rivers Clesma, Wolga, and Occa, on each side of which rivers the flats are exceedingly fertile. The ca∣pital, Wolodimer, stands about five and twenty leagues to the north-east of Moscow, on the face of a high hill, intersected with vallies. The na∣ture of its situation, with its white churches, lofty spires, and the course of the river Clesma-recca, which winds along the foot of the hill, exhibit a very noble appearance: but within there is nothing answerable to this external magnificence. It was built by prince Wolodimer in the beginning of the tenth century; and here he and his successors re∣sided, until the court was removed to Moscow. Since that period the grandeur of Wolodimer has been gradually decaying. Many stately houses, and great part of the fortifications, are now in ruins: nevertheless the place is still considerable and populous, contains a good number of churches, seven or eight built of stone, and the adjacent ter∣ritory is remarkably fruitful. Besides Wolodimer, we reckon the towns of Sless, Gorachowitz, and Baluchna: the first situated on the Clesma; the two last on the Wolga.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Susdal, bounded on the north by the Wolga, and on the south by Wolodimer, extends about forty-five leagues from east to west, is watered by several rivers, that fertilize the low grounds; and great part of it is covered with large forests, stocked with fallow deer, and other game, as well as with wild beasts, whose furs are valuable.
<PB N="344" REF="3570"/>
This whole country was subdued by John Basilo∣witz. Susdal, the capital, is situated on the river Clesma, about twenty leagues north north-east from Moscow, was formerly the metropolis of Rus∣sia, and is still the see of an archbishop. The town is chiefly built of wood, in the Russian man∣ner, and retains very little of its former magni∣ficence, except a stately monastery of nuns, and some few antient edifices.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Moscow is the chief province of this great empire, deriving its name from the river Muscova, or Moska, on which the capital is situated. It was from this dutchy that the Czars of old took the title of Dukes of Muscovy. The province is bounded on the north by the dutchies of Twere, Rostow, Susdal, and Wolodimer; on the south by Rezan, from which it is separated by the river Occa; on the east by the principality of Cachine, and the same river Occa parting it from Nisi-novo∣gorod; and on the west by the dutchies of Rzeva, Biela, and Smolensko. It extends about two hun∣dred miles in length, and about one hundred in breadth; and is watered by the Moska, Occa, and Clesma, which fall into the Wolga: nevertheless the soil is not very fertile. The air, however, tho' sharp, is salubrious; and this consideration, with the advantage of its being situated in the midst of the best provinces in the empire, induced the Czars to make it their chief residence. In the western part of Moscow is a large forest, from whence flows the celebrated river Nieper, or Borysthenes, which, traversing the dutchy of Smolensko, winds in a ser∣pentine course to Ukrania, Lithuania, and Poland. The capital, Moscow, or Moskova, is the metro∣polis and largest city of the Russian empire, situated in a spacious plain on the banks of the river Mus∣kova; over which the prince Gafischin built a stately bridge, consisting of twelve arches of pro∣digious
<PB N="345" REF="3580"/>
heighth, breadth, and solidity; because the river is so apt to overflow its banks: it was de∣signed by a Polish monk, and is the only stone∣bridge in all Russia. Moscow is seated on a whol-some gravelly soil, and divided into four quarters, each surrounded with a distinct wall. These dis∣tricts are known by the names of Cataigorod, Cza∣rogorod, Skorodum, and Strelitze-slaboda. The Cataigorod, surrounded with a brick-wall, is the middle of the city; in which stands the citadel, about two miles in circuit, fortified with a triple wall, flanked with towers, and a fosse. It contains two imperial palaces, the one of timber, and the other of stone, built after the Italian architecture; the patriarchal palace, which is a large antient edi∣fice; the exchequer, chancery, and other offices; two noble monasteries; five large churches, in∣cluding that of St. Michael, famous for its fabrick and ornaments, as well as for the monuments of the Grand Dukes and Czars, who have been here interred; the grand magazine, and many other stately buildings. Without the citadel-gate stands that noble edifice the church of Jerusalem, finished by the czar John Basilides, who ordered the archi∣tect to be deprived of his eye-sight, that he might never contrive, or at least behold its equal. In the great market that fronts the citadel we see the stupendous bell, supposed to be the largest in the whole world. It was hung in a tower built for the purpose, which tower was consumed by fire in the beginning of the present century. The weight of the bell amounts to three hundred and thirty-six thousand pounds. It is in heighth nineteen feet, in diameter twenty-three, in circumference seventy, and the sides are two feet in thickness. One hun∣dred men were employed in moving this monstrous machine, which was only rung on extraordinary occasions: for example, when the Czar condes∣cended
<PB N="346" REF="3590"/>
to shew himself to his people, and when he conversed with his wife, that the subjects might know when to petition heaven that a male child should be the issue of the conjugal embrace. This district is watered by the rivers Negliga and Moska, and is called Cataigorod from <HI>Catai,</HI> the Russian name for China, because here the merchandizes of that empire are chiefly sold. The Czarogorod, or ducal city, encompasses the Cataigorod, and is itself fortified with a white stone-wall, called Biela∣stena, whence it has acquired the appellation of Bielagorod, or the White City. The most remark∣able building in this division is the great arsenal. The Skorodum Quarter stands to the north-west of the Czarogorod, and is chiefly inhabited by timber-merchants and carpenters, who sell wooden houses ready made. It is surrounded with a mud∣wall, and distinguished by the name of Scorodum, which signifies <HI>done in haste,</HI> because, on an alarm from the Tartars, it was finished in four days, though it is fifteen miles in circuit, and the earth is every where supported by planks and beams of timber. It is absolutely necessary that there should be such a magazine of houses ready made, to sup∣ply the loss of those that perish almost every day by conflagrations, owing to the carelessness, rage, and intoxication of the inhabitants. On the east and south-east sides of the Cataigorod and citadel stands the Strelitze-slaboda, so called from the guards of that name, who were formerly lodged in this quarter, which is fortified with wooden ramparts, and divided from the other parts of the city by the river Moska. The houses of the com∣monalty are no better than mean paultry wooden huts, without neatness and furniture: but the merchants secure their commodities in vaults of stone or brick, which are proof against the acci∣dents of fire. There are three thousand stone or
<PB N="347" REF="3600"/>
brick houses in the city of Moscow; but they stand at such distances from one another, are so in∣termingled with rows of wooden houses, and such a number of them stand detached from, and, as it were, behind the street, surrounded with high walls, that the effect of them is almost lost in the general prospect. The streets, instead of being paved with stones, are boarded with fir-planks; so that in conflagrations the ground seems to burn, and it becomes impossible to approach the scene of disaster. Among the churches and chapels of this city, which are said to amount in number to fif∣teen hundred, that in the Krimelin, or palace of the citadel, is a very antient and remarkable edi∣fice. On the right-hand side of the altar is the Czar's throne, and on the left is that of the patri∣arch. The body of the church is lighted by a silver chandelier of immense weight and value. The jewels and ornaments belonging to an image of the Virgin Mary, are valued at half a tun weight in gold: but inestimable is the value of an infinite number of chalices, pixes, patens, statues, and other church-utensils of gold and silver, curiously wrought and enriched with precious stones, a pro∣digious number of rich priestly vestments, besides innumerable donatives, and presents offered to the reliques of three eminent Russian saints interred in this place. In a word, the treasure contained in this church is said to equal, at least, that of any cathedral in Europe. Hard by the church of St. Michael, which we have mentioned above, is the stately abbey of nuns, called Tzudoff-monaster: here the bodies of the princesses of the blood are interred; and in a separate chapel we see the tombs of those princes who never ascended the throne. Nothing can be more rich and magnifi∣cent than the palls with which their coffins are co∣vered on holidays. Of the several monasteries that
<PB N="348" REF="3610"/>
appear in Moscow, and its neighbourhood, the most remarkable is the Dewitze-monaster, about a mile from the city, where Peter confined his am∣bitious sister the princess Sophia, who had hatched so many conspiracies against his government. This monastery, which is situated in an extensive plain, contains three hundred nuns, who are kept under severe restrictions, contrary to the freedom with which other Muscovite nuns are indulged. The only liberty these enjoy is in holiday-time, when they are permitted to walk on the terraces of the garden, which overlook the adjacent plain.</P>
<P>Peter the Great founded at Moscow three col∣leges, and selected for them able professors. In the first they taught humanity, rhetoric, and phi∣losophy; in the second mathematicks; and in the third navigation and astronomy. To these colleges he added a dispensatory, which is one of the no∣blest structures in Moscow, compleatly furnished with all sorts of drugs and medicines, under the care of some Germans well skilled in the art of pharmacy and chymistry. The yearly revenue of this dispensatory amounts to two thousand rubles, allotted for fresh supplies of the <HI>materia medica;</HI> and from hence not only the army, but likewise all the chief cities of the empire are furnished.</P>
<P>The courts of judicature, custom-house, gaols, and other public edifices, are built of stone, large, strong, and massy. The city of Moscow was founded in the year 1334, and in process of time gradually enlarged itself to such a degree, that it is said to have contained eighty thousand houses: but in the sequel it suffered greatly, both from the enemy and successive conflagrations. Nevertheless, in the reign of Charles II. of England, while lord Carlile was ambassador at that court, the city was twelve miles in compass, and the number of houses computed at forty thousand. Notwithstanding the
<PB N="349" REF="3620"/>
severity and vigilance of the magistracy in Mos∣cow, the city swarms with sturdy beggars and va∣gabonds, who render it very unsafe to walk through the streets in the dark. Some of these, being armed with short truncheons, lurk in obscure corners, from whence they throw their weapons at the heads of passengers with such dexterity, that they seldom fail to knock them down: then they rob and murder them, and make off with the booty. The body of the person thus murdered is exposed in public for a certain time; and, if not owned, the magistrates order it to be thrown into a large deep pit, dug on purpose for the interment of all those who lose their lives in this manner: thither some priests repair on Whitsuntide-holidays, to say mass for the souls of the deceased. The antient splendour and opulence of Moscow was greatly diminished by the building of Petersburg, and the removal of the court to that city. Never∣theless the place is still populous; and there is plenty of all kinds of provision, extremely good, and surprisingly cheap, except the article of fish, for which there is a very great demand, occasioned by the four great Lents, and weekly fasts observed by the Russians. The canal between Moscow and Petersburg is one of the most stupendous works of the czar Peter: it begins at the Nieva, and is con∣tinued from lake to lake, and river to river, for near one hundred leagues, until it reaches Moscow. What is properly deemed the artificial canal, com∣mences at the city of Novogorod, and is carried on with incredible labour and expence through the territories of Brognitz, Christitz, Chilolova, Wits∣chora, Voloscha, Torschock, the province of Twere, and the district of Kiln. The city of Moscow stands about six hundred and fifty miles from Caffa, the capital of Crim Tartary; nine hundred and fifty miles from Constantinople; seven hundred
<PB N="350" REF="3630"/>
and twenty from Cracow in Poland; six hundred and sixty from Stockholm; and one thousand three hundred and twenty from London; in 55 degrees 42 minutes of north latitude.</P>
<P>Treytza, or Treytzki, is a small elegant town, about forty English miles to the northward of Moscow. It is famous for a stately monastery, or convent, dedicated to the Trinity, and accommo∣dated with a spacious church, standing in the middle of the square. Sixty thousand peasants are said to be dependant on this abbot, who is like∣wise enriched with other revenues. Within the precincts of this convent is an imperial palace, strongly fortified; to which the czar Peter, in his younger days, retired from the fury of the boyar Convanski, who, at the head of the Strelitzes, plundered or murdered all those in the metropolis who pretended to oppose his ambitious and trea∣sonable project, in concert with the Czar's sister the princess Sophia.</P>
<P>Kolumna, situated on the western bank of the river Occa, near the confines of the dutchy of Resan, is a small town, formerly well fortified, though the walls and towers are now in ruins. It is the see of an archbishop, and exhibits nothing remarkable but a noble church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the archiepiscopal palace.</P>
<P>Colomensko, or Kolopimenski, a small town in the neighbourhood of Moscow, standing on an eminence that commands a fine prospect, is re∣markable for little else than a large church, with two stately towers, and a magnificent monastery. In approaching it by two avenues, the river Moska must be crossed on a float of timber, contrived so as to open and divide in the middle, and allow vessels to pass and repass. Mosacsch, Wiesma, Golutwina-slaboda, and Dmitroff, are little incon∣siderable
<PB N="351" REF="3640"/>
towns, that do not deserve any particular description.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Rostow, lying between Moscow and Zaroslaw, is a fertile country, bounded on the east by Susdal, and on the west by Twere. It was formerly the second dutchy of all Russia, governed by its own princes; the last of whom was subdued, taken, and put to death by the czar Iwan Basilo∣witz, who annexed this territory to his own de∣mesnes. It was afterwards commonly assigned as an appanage for the maintenance of the Czarowitz, or heir apparent. Rostow abounds with corn, herbs, and fruits, and produces great variety of game; for the sake of which the czar Peter fre∣quently made an excursion hither in the hunting∣season. The capital, Rostow, is a large town and metropolitan see, situated on the lake Rostrow; from whence issues the small river Cobris, or Ko∣loper, that runs into the Wolga. There are some elegant stone-churches in this city, which stands about forty leagues to the northward of Moscow.</P>
<P>Uglitz, seated on the Wolga, about seven and twenty leagues west of Rostow, is noted for its ex∣cellent bread; but still more famous for the mur∣der of the young prince Demetrius, son of the czar Iwan Basilowitz. He was here slain by order of his brother-in-law Frederowitz Godanow, during a tumult, occasioned by a conflagration raised on purpose. The murderer usurped the throne, and was succeeded by his son of the same name, who proved an intolerable tyrant. He oppressed the nobility in such a manner, that they countenanced an impostor, who pretended to be the prince De∣metrius, and was crowned without opposition in the year 1605; but in a little time the cheat was discovered, and the Russians put him to death. Chlopigorod, standing on the same river Wolga, was formerly a place of considerable trade; but is
<PB N="352" REF="3650"/>
now almost ruined and abandoned. Perislaw is a large and populous city, standing at an equal dis∣tance between Moscow and Rostow, well supplied with game; on account of which it was often vi∣sited by the Czar and his attendants. There is nothing remarkable in the other towns of this pro∣vince, known by the names of Mologa, Semebra∣taff, Gna, Imbilowa-nova, and Basma-nova.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Jaroslaw, or Yeroslaw, lies be∣tween Moscow and Vologda; is a fertile country, abounding with corn, cattle, and honey, and wa∣tered by the river Wolga, which runs through the heart of the province. Jaroslaw, the capital, is a large populous city, said to contain forty thousand inhabitants, strongly fortified, enjoying a consider∣able commerce in corn, cattle, leather, and honey, situated on the river Wolga, about twelve leagues to the northward of the city of Rostow. The other towns of this district, worth mentioning, are Roma-nova and Damelofke: the first stands on the Wolga, about seven leagues to the westward of Jaroslaw, and on the opposite side of the river.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Bilejezora, or Belozero, is a small province, almost circular, deriving its name from a lake called Biele-ozoro, or the White Lake, on the banks of which stands the capital of the same name. This country, bounded by Jaroslaw on the east, by Wologda on the north, by Great Novo∣gorod on the west, and by the dutchy of Twere on the south, is so encumbered with woods, lakes, and fens, that the roads are impassable, except in the winter, when the waters are frozen. The lakes are well stored with fish; nay, some parts of the province are well inhabited, producing plenty of corn and good pasture. The lake of Biele-ozoro extends thirteen leagues in length, and in some places is seven leagues broad.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="3660"/>
The capital, Belozero, is large, populous, well fortified, and particularly secured by a castle, which is surrounded by the water of the lake, and esteemed impregnable. There is no other considerable town in this dutchy but Geblowa-slaboda, standing on the river Mologa; by means of which, and its con∣fluence with the Volga a little below the town, the inhabitants enjoy a good share of traffick.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Wologda, bounded on the west by Bilejezora, on the north by the dutchies of Gar∣gapol and Oustiong, on the south by Jaroslaw, and on the east by the river Dwina, is a large, woody, and mountainous province, interspersed with lakes and fens: the forests abound with all sorts of game, and the waters with fish; but the people labour under a scarcity of other provisions. Wologda, the capital, situated on both sides of a river of the same name, is a large and populous city, inhabited by a rich trading people. This is the pass through which all commodities must be conveyed to and from Archangel; and here is a good number of magazines and stores, kept by the merchants of England, Holland, and other nations. The city is surrounded with a strong wall of stone, and de∣fended by a fortress so strong, that, in times of danger, the Czars send hither their most valuable effects, as to a place of safety. Wologda stands about seventy-five leagues to the northward of Moscow, and is one of the most antient archiepis∣copal sees in all Russia. The houses are well built, the streets open and regular, and the bazars or markets well furnished with all sorts of merchan∣dize. Every article, however, is sold in its own peculiar quarter; the furs in one, the flesh in an∣other, the wood in a third, and the cloths in a fourth. The river, which is broad and navigable, contributes in a great measure to the traffick of the city. Besides the cathedral, called Saboor, which
<PB N="354" REF="3670"/>
is a magnificent structure, having five stately cu∣polas covered with tin, and surmounted with crosses finely gilt; there are twenty churches in this city built of stone, and forty-three of timber. There are moreover three nunneries, each pro∣vided with an elegant stone chapel, built in the centre. Dwinitza, situated on a river of the same name, which falls into the Wologda, is a small town, well peopled. Sooska and Stralitz are towns of some little importance, standing on the river Wologda: but there is no other place in this pro∣vince that deserves notice.</P>
<P>The province of Kargapol, lying to the north∣ward of Wologda, is a large tract of land, stretch∣ing almost to the White Sea, covered with forests, fens, and small lakes, and intersected by a great number of rivers: the chief of these is the One∣ga, taking its rise in this province, and running into the White Sea. The inhabitants of this dis∣trict are extremely ignorant, rude, and barbarous, little more civilized than the Laplanders, and living pretty much in their manner. They have no towns worth mentioning but the capital Kargapol, situat∣ed on the western bank of the Onega, about six∣teen German leagues to the eastward of the great lake which bears that name.</P>
<P>The province of Waga, lying to the north-west of Kargapol, is of considerable extent, but woody, wild, and desolate. Here are no towns that de∣serve the least notice but Waga and Wied, both situated on the same river Waga, which falls into the Dwina.</P>
<P>Onega, lying to the westward of Waga, is a long, narrow, barren province, covered with woods, and thinly inhabited, without any city or town of im∣portance, except Korelskoi, which stands near the mouth of the river Onega, on the southern coast of the White Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="3680"/>
Of much more importance is the province of Dwina, extending itself near one hundred leagues, in form of a lozenge; bounded on the north by the White Sea, and part of Ingria; on the west by Waga and Onega, from which it is parted by the river Dwina; on the south by the province of Ou∣stiong; and on the east by part of Zirania. It is watered by several rivers, besides the Dwina; but woody, mountainous, and barren. The ground produces no corn, and but very little pasture, so that few cattle are bred in this province. The in∣habitants live chiefly on dried fish; and their staple commodity is salt, the sale of which constituted their sole traffick until the English extended their commerce to Archangel. Since that period this town became one of the chief marts for all the commodities of Muscovy: the city soon grew rich, and its wealth was diffused through the whole pro∣vince, which abounds with large towns, wealthy, and well inhabited. The capital, Archangel, or St. Michael the Archangel, by the Russians called Archania, is situated on the east-side of the Dwina, about six leagues above the place where that river falls into the White Sea. The city extends about two miles in length, is rich, populous, and built in the modern taste. It is a metropolitan see, and stands between the sixty-fourth and sixty-fifth de∣grees of northern latitude. Archangel owed its wealth and importance originally to the English, by whom it was discovered in the year 1553. Richard Chancellor, master of one of the ships fitted out under the command of Sir Hugh Wil∣loughby, who had received a commission to go in quest of the north-east passage to China, was sepa∣rated from the rest of the fleet, and obliged by stress of weather to put into the bay of St. Nicho∣las, on the White Sea. The czar Iwan Basilowitz, being informed of his arrival, invited him to his
<PB N="356" REF="3690"/>
court, where he was hospitably entertained; and the Czar indulged the English with a free trade in his dominions: in consequence of this permission, a company of merchants was incorporated in Lon∣don; and, being encouraged by particular privi∣leges from the Czar, set on foot a considerable commerce, to the mutual advantage of both na∣tions. Before this period, the Russian commodities were usually conveyed to Narva, in the gulph of Finland: but the channel of trade was soon turned to Archangel, and this traffick the English for some time enjoyed without competition. The Dutch, however, and other nations, gradually insinuated themselves into this commerce, which they carried on to a very great disadvantage, as not being fa∣voured with those privileges which the Czar had granted to the English company: these were at length unhappily lost, in the time of the great re∣bellion. When the Czar heard that the English na∣tion had brought their sovereign to the scaffold, he was so exasperated against them, that he forthwith deprived them of the immunities in trade which they had hitherto enjoyed in the dominions of Rus∣sia; nor could our company, with all its efforts, retrieve them in the sequel, so that our merchants were obliged to trade at Archangel on the footing of other European nations.</P>
<P>The commodities chiefly imported into Arch∣angel were gold and silver stuffs and laces, gold wire, cochineal, indigo, and other drugs for dy∣ing; wine, brandy, and other distilled spirits. The customs arising to the Czar were computed at two hundred thousand rubles a year, and the number of foreign ships at four hundred annually: but since the ports of Petersburg and Riga were open∣ed, great part of the trade has been removed to the Baltic, and the commerce of Archangel is greatly decayed.</P>

The houses of Archangel are generally of wood, but well contrived; and every chamber is pro∣vided with a stove, as a fence against the cold, which is here excessive in the winter. The streets are paved with broken pieces of timber and rub∣bish, disposed so unskilfully, that one cannot walk over it without running the risque of falling, ex∣cept when the streets are rendered smooth and equal by the snow that falls, and freezes in the winter. Notwithstanding the severity of the cold in this place, there is always plenty of good pro∣visions: butcher's meat, poultry, wild fowl, and fish, in great variety, are sold surprisingly cheap. A brace of partridges may be bought for four pence. These birds, as well as the hares of this country, grow white in the winter; and when the weather becomes more mild, resume their natural colour.</P>
<P>The most remarkable edifice in Archangel is a large town-house, built of square stones in the Italian manner, and divided into three parts: one of these consists of large commodious apartments, for the accommodation of merchants, strangers as well as natives: here they are permitted to reside with their merchandize till the month of October, when all the foreign ships set sail for the respective countries to which they belong. Then the traders are obliged to remove their quarters from the town-house or palace, which hath a spacious court, that reaches down to the river.</P>
<P>The government of Archangel was lodged in the governor till the first year of the present cen∣tury, when the Czar appointed four burgomasters to regulate all civil and mercantile affairs; so that now the governor's power is confined to the militia. The court sends hither yearly a commissioner to receive the customs, which are collected by four deputies in his absence.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="3710"/>
St. Nicholas, another sea-port, stands upon the White Sea, about seven leagues west of Archangel. From this place the whole bay of St. Nicholas de∣rived its name; but at present-the town and trade are very inconsiderable.</P>
<P>Next to Archangel, the most considerable town in this province is Colmogorod, the seat of a Rus∣sian archbishop. It is situated on the western bank of the Dwina, about ten leagues above Archangel, near the place where the Pinega falls into that river.</P>
<P>Neva Dwinska is a strong fortress, lately built to defend the mouth of the new canal, or the most northern opening of the Dwina on the White Sea. It is furnished with a large wooden bridge over the river, the middle part of which can be drawn up occasionally for the passage of vessels.</P>
<P>Sottotitza, otherwise Sottowitzogda, is a large city, standing on the southern confines of this pro∣vince, inhabited by many considerable merchants and curious mechanicks. In the neighbourhood there is a territory of very considerable extent, called Wollostusgy; the inhabitants of which are a civilized people, who speak a language peculiar to themselves, profess the doctrines of the Greek church, and are supposed to have come originally from Livonia.</P>
<P>We shall conclude this article by mentioning the island Martinowitz, lying on the north-west coast of the province called Ingoria, from which it is parted by an oblong lake, terminating at each end in a narrow streight. The island stretches about forty-five leagues in length, and eighteen in breadth, lying between the forty-third and forty∣seventh degrees of east longitude from London. It extends near two degrees to the northward of the Artic Circle, is covered with woods and forests, and watered by several rivers, such as the Toyna,
<PB N="359" REF="3720"/>
Carana, Colcowa, &amp;c. and in some of the best maps is distinguished by the name of Ostrow Kan∣denoss. Here is likewise a town and a cape, well known by the names of Kandenoss and Candenora; but the severity of the climate is scarce tolerable.</P>
<P>Still farther to the northward we meet with an∣other smaller island, called Kalgew, or Kolgow, of which we can give no particular account.</P>
<P>Having thus taken a summary view of the western provinces in Russia, we shall now proceed to de∣scribe those that constitute the eastern division, namely, Mezen, Ingora, Candora, and Teesca Pet∣zora, the country of the Vogalise, Permia, Ou∣stiong, Zirania, and Viatka. We shall afterwards distinguish the provinces of Muscovian Tartary, Casan, Bulgara, Boskiria, Astracan, Siberia, and Samoieda, as well as those that are comprehended in Russian Lapland.</P>
<P>The territory of Mezen lies to the northward of Dwina and the river Prega, and extends northerly to Ingora and the streights of Kandenoss, a long narrow tract of land, abounding with forests, fens, and mountains, barren, cold, and comfortless. The chief town, called Mezzen, and the other villages belonging to this district, are wretched places, un∣worthy of particular description.</P>
<P>The next province, of Ingora, is equally cold, barren, marshy, woody, and mountainous, bounded on the north by the Frozen Ocean, and on the south by the provinces of Oustiong and Permia. It is a large tract of country, extending a considerable way beyond the Polar Circle, and watered by a great number of rivers, among which we number the Fitza, Golocbentza, Golocbicca, Otmas Oy∣metza, Pietza, &amp;c. which flow northwards into the gulph of Teesca. The inhabitants are as brutal as the Samoiedes, whom they resemble in their feed∣ing on the raw guts and garbage of animals; but
<PB N="360" REF="3730"/>
their language is different. In the middle of the province is the territory of Vaconitza Volost, in∣cluding a few scattered towns or villages. On the southern part it is divided from Zirania by the Ju∣gorian mountains, which are always covered with ice and snow. The chief town, Jugora, or Juhora, stands on a bay of the same name on the northern coast, between the isle of Kandenoss and the gulph of Petzerskaia. The other places of this province are too inconsiderable to be mentioned.</P>
<P>Permia, one of the largest provinces in the Rus∣sian empire, is bounded on the north by the coun∣try of the Vogulizi, on the east by Siberia, on the south by the province of Vaitka, and on the west by Oustiong. It extends near nine degrees of la∣titude in length, and is in some places sixty leagues broad; is watered by some large rivers, the most considerable of which is the Kama, rising from a long chain of mountains, which separates the pro∣vince from Siberia, and stretch themselves from the kingdom of Casan to the coast of the Frozen Sea. This country is full of lakes and mountains, and the soil so unkindly, that it produces nothing but peas, beans, and other pulse, which the natives eat instead of bread. They speak a language pe∣culiar to themselves, have their own customs and religion, and pay to the Russian emperor a yearly tribute in furs and horses. The capital, Solikam∣skoi, is said to be a large and opulent city, inha∣bited by many considerable merchants, who traffick in salt; of which commodity great quantities are here made, and shipped in large vessels built for that purpose. These vessels sail down the Kama into the Volga, which disembogues itself into the Caspian Sea below Astracan. Other geographers and travellers say the chief city of this province is Permia Velikaia, situated near the confluence of the Kama and the Wissora, in the latitude of sixty-two:
<PB N="361" REF="3740"/>
they likewise enumerate a great number of other cities and towns, of which we know very few particulars.</P>
<P>The country of Usting, or Oustiough, lies to the westward of Permia, and to the southward of Waga and Dwina, a small barren province, covered with impenetrable woods, that afford shelter to a great number of black foxes, which yield valuable furs. The rivers Jugh and Suchana rise in dif∣ferent parts of this province, and, meeting near the middle, form the Dwina, so called from its being composed of a double stream: but before these two rivers join, the Suchana is swelled by many different streams: at the mouth of one of these stands the monastery of Teelego. Some of the frontiers of this province are watered by the Waga, which falls into the Dwina. The river Oustiong springs in this province, and disembogues itself into the Suchana. The capital, Oustiough, from Ostium Jugae, stands on the western banks of the Suchana, into which the Jugh falls, a little below the town. This place is a metropolitan see, and was formerly thought so strong, that in times of danger the Czars sent hither their most valuable effects. The city is still considerable, extending about a league, in form of a crescent. The most remarkable building is the archiepiscopal palace, which is large and gloomy. There are ten or twelve churches built of stone, and covered with tin: the other churches, and the houses in general, are of timber. It is surrounded with stone walls; stands about two hundred and twenty miles to the south-east of Archangel, and is chiefly noted for a yearly fair of fox-skins, and other peltry. The other towns are Wiod, Sanasterwa, Widsogkaiasal, Totma, Totma-Starmia, Woltazemeetz-Godorick, Brousinkoi-Godorick, and Dwina: but all these are inconsiderable.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="3750"/>
The province of Zirania, or Zarani, is a long narrow tract of land, stretching from the sixtieth to the sixty-fifth degree of latitude, almost totally covered with impenetrable woods, and haunted by an incredible number of wild beasts: the land must of consequence be barren, and thinly inhabited. The people live scattered in villages, composed of wretched huts; are fierce, brutish, and intractable. They live by hunting, clothe themselves with part of the skins, and exchange the overplus with their neighbours for those necessaries without which they cannot well subsist. Their chief villages are known by the names of Zericow, Touria, Oustwina, Ookla, Veysema, Larenscoi, Ousoy, Relencitz, Ousissoli, and Kersa; all of them miserable places, unworthy of further notice.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Viatka, or Wiadski, is the last province of eastern Muscovy, bounded on the south by the kingdom of Casan, and on the east by part of Siberia. It was conquered from the Tartars by the czar Iwan Basilowitz, and was then almost de∣serted, on account of the incursions of the Schire∣misse Tartars; but now it fares much better, as both nations have been subdued by the Russians. This province, though woody, marshy, and bar∣ren, produces a great quantity of honey, wax, and furs. It is watered by the river Vaitka, which takes its rise within the province, and washing se∣veral towns, after a short course, falls into the Kama. On that river stands the capital, Viatka, a bishop's see, provided with a strong castle, built by the czar Basilowitz, to check the incursions of the Tartars. The place can boast of nothing else remarkable, except two roads leading from hence to Moscow; one of which, though shorter, is much more dangerous than the other, because it runs through vast morasses, and is infested by the Schi∣remisse free-booters. Colclinitz is another consi∣derable
<PB N="363" REF="3760"/>
town of this dutchy, situated on the same river, near the frontiers of the kingdom of Casan. Slaboda stands more to the north-west, on the bor∣ders of the Schiremisse Tartars. Besides these, the province includes Clinow, Ortow, and Kaigorod, all fortified after the Russian manner: but the Czars having enlarged their dominions by conquest, these fortifications are become useless, and neglected ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>Muscovian Tartary, in Europe, comprehends Casan, Bulgaria, Baskiria, Astracan, Siberia, and Samoieda. Casan, called by the Russians Czarsti∣no Cazanskoi, is a kingdom, formerly governed by its own monarchs, who were rich and powerful. The czar Basilowitz subdued the greater part of it, after a long and bloody war; and the conquest was finished in the year 1554, by his son Iwan Basilo∣witz, who likewise added the kingdom of Astracan to his dominions. Since that period, these two kingdoms have been considered as the richest jewels in the Russian diadem; Casan for its ferti∣lity, and Astracan on account of its commerce. Casan is bounded on the north by the provinces of Vaitka and Permia; on the east by Tumaean Tar∣tary; on the south by Baskeria, Bulgaria, and As∣tracan; on the west by the Lower Novogorod and Muscovy Proper. The soil, naturally fertile, is watered by the two great rivers, Volga and Kama, which not only render the ground still more fertile, but enrich the province with traffick. Cazan, or Cazanum, the capital, stands in the latitude of fifty-six degrees, fifty-four minutes, on the river Casanka, in the midst of a spacious and fruitful plain. It is a large and populous city, the seat of a Russian metropolitan, abounding with a great number of churches, monasteries, and spires, which yield a magnificent prospect, both from the land, and from the vessels that are continually sailing up
<PB N="364" REF="3770"/>
and down the Volga, into which the Casanka falls about four miles below the city. The houses in general, as well as the ramparts and towers, are built of wood. The castle, however, is fortified with stone walls, surrounded by the river, which forms a formidable fosse, well stored with artillery and ammunition, secured by a strong garrison of Russian soldiers, under the command of its own waiwode, independent of the governor of the city. At the confluence of the Casanka and the Volga, there is a large commodious dock for building shipping, and other vessels of considerable bur∣then, to carry on the commerce of the Volga and the Caspian Sea. Casan is well supplied, by land and water, with all sorts of necessaries and provi∣sions, sold very cheap, and in great abundance. Wine and fruits are brought hither from Turkey: Moscow supplies the inhabitants with groceries, and European commodities: they receive furs and iron work from Siberia and Tartary: tea is im∣ported by the annual caravans that arrive from China. It is admirably situated for the commerce of the southern parts of this empire, and accord∣ingly we reckon it the third great magazine in Russia for all sorts of merchandize. The merchants of Casan formerly maintained a considerable com∣merce with Khieva, Bokhara, and other places of Tartary, which is now lost; but the trade with Persia still continues. Here are several manufac∣tures of red Russia leather, large quantities of which are sent annually to Petersburg. The terri∣tory abounds with oaks, which yield plenty of bark for tanning: the timber used for the navy is felled in the neighbourhood of the city, and is counted excellent for the purpose of ship-building. This timber is conveyed to Petersburg in low flat-bot∣tomed vessels, which are drawn up to Twire when the river swells, and from thence into the canal by
<PB N="365" REF="3780"/>
the lake of Ladoga: but two summers are com∣monly spent in this tedious conveyance. A great number of Tartars live in the neighbourhood of Casan, which is a pleasant and fruitful country. They are neat and cleanly in their persons, and supply the markets with horses, sheep, and all other kinds of cattle, which produce abundance of tal∣low. Provisions are sent in great quantities from hence to Astracan, and to all the towns and settle∣ments on the Volga. About twenty-four leagues west of Casan stands the small city of Kockschaga, on the bank of the Volga, where sometimes there is not water enough to float large vessels. Mal∣mishas, a paultry town on the side of the river Ca∣sanka, near the frontiers of Bulgaria, surrounded with a wooden wall, and thinly peopled with in∣digent inhabitants. About three miles from the Volga are the ruins of Scrulierski, said to have been a large opulent city, between Casan and Astracan, destroyed by the great Tamerlane. The rest of the towns in this kingdom are Laisoff, Sabackzar, Pagantzina, Swatsk, Kolcis, Tetul, Karakul, Sun∣der, Batula, Bur, and Uza; but none of them deserve particular regard.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Bulgaria, otherwise known by the name of Horda, or region of the Zavolani, was antiently inhabited by the Bulgares, who made an irruption into these parts from Asia, and con∣ferred their name on this country, which is divided into Great and Little, or Asian and European Bul∣garia. European Bulgaria lies along the southern coasts of the Danube, and was heretofore annexed to the kingdom of Hungary; from which, how∣ever, it was conquered by sultan Amurath II. and then it became part of Turkey in Europe: as such it will be described in its proper place. <Q>Bulgaria the Great, which was subdued by the czars of Mus∣covy, is bounded on the north by the kingdom of
<PB N="366" REF="3790"/>
Casan; on the east by Baskiria; on the south by the river Sumara, which divides it from the king∣dom of Astracan; and on the west by the Volga. This country is watered by the Kama, Belema, Adroba, Volga, Camisamar, and Semmiour. Near the centre of the kingdom are the desarts of Ufa. It is terminated on the east by a ridge of high mountains; part of which, being the mountains of Caf, yield abundance of iron, chrystal, and other valuable stones. On the southern side is the large lake Kerghewl; and a monastery of the order of St. Basil on the side of the river Beleia. We are little acquainted with the nature of the soil, and the produce of the country; but the province must be populous, if we may be allowed to judge from the number and size of the cities it contains. Bul∣gar, or Bulgara, the capital, stands on the Volga, and is counted one of the most considerable cities in Russia: Samara, situated on the river of the same name, which falls into the Volga, is built on the declivity of a mountain, and the suburbs stretch along the banks of the river: the place is large; but the houses are generally wretched, they, as well as the walls and fortifications, being built of timber. The city of Samara is said to have been raised in one month, by thirty thousand men sent thither, in the reign of the czar Peter. The work was directed by prince Galischin; and the place proved of excellent use, not only in repressing the incursions of the Tartars and Cossacks, but like∣wise in affording magazines to supply the army in that province with all kinds of provision and neces∣saries. Simberka, or Simberskaigoras, a large and opulent city, advantageously situated, was, with many others, destroyed by Tamerlane. We are told by John Struits, in his Voyages, that, going ashore at this place, he ascended a mountain, where formerly stood the city of Abuchim, and there dis∣covered

a stone with an inscription, which was in∣terpreted by a Muscovite to this effect: “Who∣soever thou art, if thou hast strength enough to turn me, thou wilt make thy fortune.”</Q> From this intimation our traveller and his company, expect∣ing to find some hidden treasure, immediately moved it from its place, and on the under side found another inscription, importing, <Q>“This is not the first time thou hast taken great pains to little purpose.”</Q> The adjacent country seemed to be very fertile, but quite desolate and uninhabited.</P>
<P>Baskiria, inhabited by the Baskiri Tartars, lies to the southward of Bulgaria and the Tumaean Tar∣tary; but the country is so little known, that we can give no account of its soil, produce, cities, or inhabitants. Here however is the mount Albater, from whence issue the two rivulets called Vye and Lostrama. These, after a course of some leagues, joining, form the river Tobol, which runs into Si∣beria, and gives its name to the city Tobolskoi, capital of that province. From part of Bulgaria this province is divided by a ridge of mountains, that produce iron and chrystal: here also is the lake Jakaia, issuing in the river Jaick, which wa∣ters part of this country, and falls into the Caspian Sea.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Astracan is the most eastern province in Europe, bounded on the north by Bul∣garia and Baskiria; on the south by the Caspian Sea; on the west by the Volga, which divides it from the Nagayan Tartars and Don Cossacks; and on the east by the great ridge of mountains which part it from Great Tartary. The province extends from the forty-sixth to the fifty-second degree of latitude. The summer is long, and intensely hot: the winter continues about three months so severe, that the Volga is frozen hard enough to bear loaded sledges. The soil is rich and fertile; but the Tar∣tars
<PB N="368" REF="3820"/>
who inhabit it are strangers to agriculture. On the western and southern sides of the Volga are heaths of a prodigious extent, sandy, desart, and uncultivated: these, however, produce vast quan∣tities of fine transparent salt in pits, where the sun bakes and incrustates it to the thickness of an inch on the surface of the water. There are pits in the neighbourhood of Astracan which yield this excel∣lent salt in such abundance, that any person may carry it off, paying at the rate of one farthing a poost, which is equal to forty pounds. The me∣tropolis, Astracan, is situated within the bounda∣ries of Asia, on an island called Dolgoi, about sixty English miles above the place where the Vol∣ga disembogues itself into the Caspian Sea. The city derives its name from Hadgee Tarken, a Tar∣tar, by whom it was founded. It was conquered by Iwan Basilowitz, recovered by the Tartars in the year 1668, and retaken by the Czar, who em∣ployed for this purpose a great number of flat∣bottomed vessels, in which he transported his forces down the Volga from Casan. The city of Astra∣can is about two miles and a half in circumference, surrounded by a brick wall, which is now in a ruin∣ous condition: but, if we comprehend the suburbs, the circuit will be near five miles. The number of inhabitants amounts to seventy thousand, in∣cluding Armenians and Tartars, as well as a few Persians and Indians. The garrison consists of six regiments of the best Russian troops, who, when this place was alarmed from the side of Persia, had in the adjacent plain erected a great number of small batteries, to scour the fields, and obstruct the approach of the enemy. The houses of Astracan are built of wood, and generally mean and incon∣venient. The higher parts of the city command a prospect of the Volga, which is here about three miles in breadth, and exhibits a noble appearance.

<PB N="369" REF="3840"/>
The marshy lands on the banks of it render the place very sickly in the summer: the earth, being impregnated with salt, is extremely fertile, and produces abundance of fruit, the immoderate use of which is attended with epidemical distempers. Sickness is likewise the consequence of those annual changes in the atmosphere, produced by the floods in spring and autumn. All round the city of As∣tracan, at the distance of two miles, we see a great number of gardens, orchards, and vineyards, pro∣ducing all sorts of herbs and roots, (except cauli∣flowers,) artichoaks, and potatoes, apples, pears, cherries, grapes, and excellent water-melons; which last, though remarkably juicy, grow best in a sandy soil. The grapes are counted so delicious, that they are preserved in sand, and transported to court by land-carriage, at a prodigious ex∣pence: yet the wine of Astracan is very indiffe∣rent. The summer being generally dry, the in∣habitants water their gardens by means of large wheels worked by wind or horses, which raise the water to the highest part of the garden, from which it runs in trenches to refresh the roots of every single tree and plant. The neighbouring country produces hares and partridges, plenty of quails in summer, with wild, and water fowl of all sorts in abundance. About ten miles below As∣tracan is a small island, called Bosmaife, on which are built large store-houses for the salt which is made about twelve miles to the eastward, and, being brought hither in boats, is conveyed up the Volga, in order to supply the country as far as Moscow and Twere. The quantity of salt an∣nually dug for these purposes amounts to some millions of pounds, the exclusive property of which is claimed by the crown, and yields a considerable revenue; for the soldiers and bulk of the people live almost intirely on bread and salt. The neigh∣bourhood
<PB N="370" REF="3850"/>
of these salt-works is of great advan∣tage to the fisheries, which extend from hence to the Caspian Sea, and reach to the south-east as far as Yack, and even an hundred miles above Zarit∣zen. The principal fish here caught are sturgeon, starlett, belluga, and assotra. These, being salted, are put on board of vessels, and sent away in the spring, for the use of the whole empire, even as far as Petersburg: but, as fish may be kept fresh so long as it is frozen, the winter is no sooner set in, than they transport great quantities of it by land, through all the provinces of Russia. Of the roes of the fish called belluga, which are white, transparent, and of an agreeable flavour, the fishers here prepare the caviare, which is in so much esteem all over Europe. These fisheries were first established by one Tikon Demedoff, a carrier, who settled in this place about half a century ago, his whole wealth consisting of two horses. By dint of skill and industry, he soon grew the richest merchant in this country: but his success became so alluring to the crown, that of late years it hath engrossed some of the fisheries, as well as the salt∣works. From the latter end of July to the be∣ginning of October, the country about Astracan is frequently infested with myriads of locusts, which darken the air in their progression from the north to the southward; and wherever they fall, consume the whole verdure of the earth. These insects can even live for some time under water: for when the wind blows across the Volga, vast num∣bers of them fall in clusters, and are rolled ashore; and their wings are no sooner dry, than they rise and take flight again. Heretofore the inhabitants of Astracan traded to Khuva and Bokhara; but at present these branches are lost, and their com∣merce is limited to Persia and the dominions of Russia. Even the trade to Persia is much dimi∣nished
<PB N="371" REF="3860"/>
by the troubles of that country: neverthe∣less, the commerce of Astracan is still considerable. A few years ago, the city maintained about forty vessels, from one to two hundred tons burthen, for the Caspian traffick. Some of these belong to the government, and are commanded by a com∣modore, under the direction of the admiralty. This office is generally well stocked with naval stores, which are sold occasionally to the mer∣chants. The trading ships convey provisions to the frontier towns of Terkie and Kislar, situated on the Caspian Sea; and transport merchandize to several parts of Persia. Some years ago, the English Russian company opened a trade from Astracan to Persia over the Caspian Sea, and ships were built for that purpose; but this commerce was soon prohibited by the Czarina, in conse∣quence of the mismanagement of an English factor, and the jealousy of the Russians. The merchants of Astracan export to Persia, chiefly on account of the Armenians, red leather, linnens, woollen cloths, and other European manufactures. In return, they import the commodities of Persia, particularly those manufactured at Casan; such as silk sashes intermixed with gold, for the use of the Poles; wrought silks and stuffs mixed with cotton; rice, cotton, rhubarb, and a small quantity of other drugs; but the chief commodity is raw silk. The government has engrossed the article of rhubarb, the greater part of which is brought into Russia by the Tartars of Yakutski, bordering on the eastern Tartars belonging to China. They travel through Siberia to Samura, thence to Casan, and lastly to Moscow. The revenue of Astracan is computed at one hundred and fifty thousand rubles, or thirty-three thousand pounds, arising chiefly from salt and fish. The city is ruled by a governor, under the check of a chancery. He
<PB N="372" REF="3870"/>
is nevertheless arbitrary enough, and exercises oppression with impunity. The officers of the admiralty and custom-house, having very small sa∣laries, are open to corruption, and extremely ra∣pacious. At christening-feasts, which are attended with great intemperance, the guests drink a kind of cherry-brandy out of large goblets, and every person invited throws a present of money into the bed of the mother, who sits up with great forma∣lity to be saluted by the company.</P>
<P>The Indians have a pagan temple at Astracan, in which they pay their adoration, and make offerings of fruit to a very ugly deformed idol. The priests of this pagod use incense, beads, cups, and prostrations. The Tartars, on the contrary, hold image-worship in the utmost abomination. In the neighbourhood of this city, there are seve∣ral settlements of the Crim Tartars, who pay tri∣bute to the Russians. They are a civil, industrious people, who cultivate the ground, which pro∣duces manna-seed, oats, musk-melons, and water∣melons: but their chief wealth consists in their daughters, sheep, horses, and cattle. When a Tartar's daughter becomes marriageable, her tent is covered with white linnen, and to the top is fixed a painted cloth tied with red strings; at one side of the tent stands a painted waggon, and these constitute her marriage portion: in consequence of this signal, the young men make their addresses to the father, who bestows the maiden in marriage upon him who offers the most valuable present. These Tartars are of the mussulman religion, and seem to be extremely nice in their burial-places. Their graves are dug very deep, lined with bricks, white-washed, vaulted, and surrounded with mud∣walls, on the top of which they plant white flags, in honour of the deceased.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="3880"/>
Along the side of the Volga, between Astracan and Yerkie, there are some settlements of the Khalmucks, who dwell in round tents, called Khabithus, raised with canes in the form of a cone, and covered with willocks, which is a very thick felt made of camel's hair. Some of these tents are fifteen yards in circumference, and about twelve feet high. The fire is made in the centre, and the smoke issues through a hole at the top. These people are wretchedly poor, and almost naked. They subsist on the fish they take in the Volga, through which they paddle in small canoes; for the governor of Astracan deprived them of their large boats, in which they used to rob and murder passengers, and disturb the peace of the govern∣ment. They choose to live on the banks of the river, among the tall flags and rushes, which in some measure protect them from the rigours of the winter. We seldom see above seven or eight tents in one place; and these contain about thirty or forty persons, who live in distinct families, un∣der the direction of one chief, elected as a ma∣gistrate. There are other tribes of the Khalmucks, who live a wandering life, like the antient Scy∣thians, moving southerly or northerly, according to the coldness or heat of the season.</P>
<P>The navigation of the Volga is a subject of such consequence to the empire of Russia, that the reader will not be displeased to see some of its pe∣culiarities described. We have already observed, that this celebrated river, formerly known by the name of the Rha, takes its rise in the province of Reskoff, issuing from the lake Fernaff, and, in a course of near three thousand English miles, re∣ceives a great number of considerable rivers, among which are the Twersa from Twere, the Moska from Moscow, the Occa from Kolumna, the Kuma, and the Samar. Thus enlarged by
<PB N="374" REF="3890"/>
tributary streams, it runs with a majestic course into the Caspian Sea. Those tributary rivers being swelled by torrents from the mountains, when the snow melts in the spring, must of consequence raise the waters of the Volga at this season. It accordingly begins to rise in March, increases in April and May, continues above its usual mark till the end of June, and then decreases apace. It is again swelled by the autumnal rains in Septem∣ber; but this increase is neither so great, nor so regular. At Astracan, the rise usually amounts to seven or eight feet, unless it be augmented by the southerly wind blowing the water up the Caspian Sea. At Zazitzen, which stands four hundred wersts above Astracan, the stream rises to twenty feet; and much higher at Casan, which is twelve hundred wersts nearer the source of the river. The ice breaks up at different times in dif∣ferent parts of the river, according to the climates through which it runs. At Astracan, the thaw begins about the end of February; but the frost continues a month longer at Casan. The channel is, in some measure, altered every year by the force of the current, and the sands which are blown into it from the adjacent country. The stream, in its common course, runs at the rate of a mile an hour; but, in time of floods, it flows with three times that velocity. For large vessels the navigation is difficult, except when the river is swelled: at these seasons it floats vessels of six hundred tons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sailors on this river are so expert in warping, that they will, in one day, warp a vessel thirty miles against the stream.</NOTE>. The trade of the Volga is very great and extensive, especially from Yanslaw and Casan. Besides the great quantity of fish taken in the river, and exported to all parts of the em∣pire, the caviare alone constitutes a considerable article of commerce. It is made (as we have said
<PB N="375" REF="3900"/>
above) of the roes of sturgeon and belluga, and the Russians call it Jecra. The fibrous parts being taken away, they are mixed with a kind of puri∣fied salt brine, then drained from the oily parts, and pressed into a consistence, which may be pre∣served for two or three years. The grain is of a darkish grey colour, almost as big as a pepper∣corn, and when cut, appears transparent. In the winter it is conveyed fresh to all parts of the em∣pire, being greatly esteemed as a toothsome resto∣rative. A large quantity is exported to Italy, and consumed by the Christians of the Levant. The best method of preparing it, is practised by the Armenians, who have been known to bring above three hundred tons in one year to market.</P>
<P>The second town in the province of Astracan is Saratow, or Saratof, situated on a branch of the Volga, on a rising ground, from whence the sub∣urbs extend themselves along the side of the river. Though this place is stiled a fortress, the upper part of the town has no other fortifications than wooden towers; but it is always secured by a strong garrison, to suppress the incursions of the Khalmuck Tartars, a savage and rapacious race, whose territory begins in the neighbourhood of this city. The country around Saratof is open and fertile; and at one of the gates is the begin∣ning of a beaten highway, which runs as far as Moscow. The town is beautified by a good num∣ber of wooden churches; but the houses are ge∣nerally mean and inconvenient. The inhabitants are all Russians, and the greater part soldiers, un∣der the command of the governor. The city has suffered greatly from conflagrations: but the greatest misfortune is its being subject to the in∣cursions of the Tartars, whom the Muscovites have driven from this province towards the shore of the Caspian Sea, and the river Jaick. These are,
<PB N="376" REF="3910"/>
properly speaking, either out-laws, or vassals who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave deserted from their masters. Their fortune being desperate, they turn robbers and pirates, and commonly herd in gangs of thirty and forty. They procure row-boats that will hold twenty or thirty men, provided with fire-arms, and, board∣ing the vessels on the Volga, massacre the pas∣sengers, and plunder their effects. The Arme∣nians are generally intrepid, and fight bravely in defence of their property: but the bourlacks, or Russian water-men, are seized with a pannic at the first appearance of those barbarians, who, they imagine, are rendered invincible by compact with the devil. Detachments of soldiers are often sent in quest of those ruffians, and a very severe pu∣nishment is inflicted upon them, if they be taken. A gibbet is erected on a float, and furnished with hooks, according to the number of the malefactors, who are stripped and fastened to them alive by the ribs: then the float is launched into the stream; and the inhabitants of the towns and villages on the banks of the river are forbid, on pain of death, to give them any sustenance or relief. They sometimes live four or five days in this mi∣serable situation, howling and blaspheming in a delirium produced by the pain, and between whiles imploring a draught of water, with the most piteous lamentation. If any of their confe∣derates find them in this condition, and think there is a probability of their recovering, they take them down, and relieve them at the risque of their own lives: but if they perceive them in extremity, they dispatch them instantly with their fire-arms. One of these miscreants having disen∣gaged himself from the hook, swam ashore, half dead with loss of blood, cold, and famine. In this miserable plight, he had the resolution to attack a shepherd, and having knocked out his brains
<PB N="377" REF="3920"/>
with a stone, cloathed himself with the man's apparel.</P>
<P>Czaritza, or Caesaria, standing on the west side of the Volga, is a strong fortress, constantly se∣cured with a good garrison. In the neighbour∣hood of this fortress may be seen the trench or canal between the rivers Laola and Camishinka, by means of which the czar Peter proposed to open a communication between the Don and the Volga. The distance between the nearest parts of the two great rivers did not exceed an hun∣dred miles: but that between the small river Laola, which falls into the Don, and the Camishinka, which runs into the Volga, was not much above three miles: sluices were to be placed on these small rivers, in order to render them navigable, and a canal of communication was to be cut from the one to the other. Upon this work, about fif∣teen thousand men were employed three summers successively, under the direction of captain Perry; and one half of the canal was actually made, when the work was interrupted in consequence of the battle of Narva, in which the Russians sustained a terrible defeat, and on account of other pressing emergencies. Perry was afterwards employed at Veronize, in raising the river by means of sluices, so as to place the Czar's ships of war upon dry blocks, above the ordinary surface of the water. This work he performed to the satisfaction of the Czar; but had the misfortune to incur the resent∣ment of some ministers, and was very ill rewarded for his services. The country between Cami∣shinka and Terki is the most pleasant and fertile, and enjoys one of the best climates in the world. The snow does not lie above three months on the ground; and immediately after it vanishes, the warm weather succeeds: then the ground is im∣mediately covered with tulips, roses, lillies of the
<PB N="378" REF="3930"/>
valley, pinks, sweet-williams, and other fragrant flowers, and herbs in great variety, so as to exhi∣bit the appearance of a delicious garden. The very best asparagus grows so thick, that in some places it may be mowed down. The common grass in the meadows is so high as to reach up to a horse's belly: the fields produce abundance of liquorice, almonds, and cherries; but the trees are low, and the fruit is small. Corn and other fruits of the earth rise and ripen almost without culti∣vation. The woods and plains abound with fallow∣deer, rein-deer, elks, wild boars, wild horses, and wild sheep. The wool of these is very short and coarse; but the mutton is tender, delicate, and of a delicious flavour: the skin of the wild horse is a thick warm fur, used for the lining and cover of sleds and carriages. The long grass drying on the ground is sometimes set on fire by accident, in spots where travellers halt for refreshment; and sometimes it is kindled on purpose, to produce ve∣getable ashes as a manure for the ground. Upon these occasions, it spreads with great rapidity through a vast tract of country, sometimes extend∣ing thirty or forty miles in all different directions, rolling in a dark cloud by day, and in a blaze of flame reflected on the clouds by night: thus it continues with a swift progress, until it is stopped by a river or a forest of tall trees. About forty wersts below Czaritza, we perceive the ruins of a large city, called Czaragorod, pleasantly situated. It is said to have been the residence of a Scythian king, and was destroyed by Tamerlane. Lower still on the side of the Volga stands Tzornogorod, a small town strongly fortified, and secured by a good Russian garrison, to repress the incursions of the Khalmucks: it stands upon an eminence, and is provided with watch-towers on all sides, from whence they can descry the enemy at a distance.
<PB N="379" REF="3940"/>
These precautions are absolutely necessary, to frus∣trate the designs of a people who carry on their sudden enterprizes with incredible expedition. They often make an irruption as far as Sumara, from whence they carry off the cattle, and every thing that falls in their way. Tzornogorod was built in consequence of their having massacred and plundered a caravan of Muscovite merchants, who had unfortunately lingered behind their escort. The town was accordingly built about two miles lower than the place on which it now stands; but being almost destroyed by the overflowing of the Volga, the situation was changed.</P>
<P>The remaining provinces of Russia are generally termed Asiatic Muscovy, though great part of them are confined within the limits of Europe. As they lie contiguous on the map to the coun∣tries we have already described, and belong to the same sovereign, we shall proceed to give an ac∣count of them, as provinces belonging to the Russian empire. They are known by the names of Siberia, Samoiedia, Russian Tartary, Lapland, and Nova Zembla. The kingdom of Siberia is a vast tract of land, stretching eighteen degrees from north to south, beginning at the fiftieth, and extending to the sixty-eighth degree of northern latitude. On the west, it is parted from Russia by the great chain of mountains reaching from Caucasus to the Northern Ocean, or Frozen Sea, which bounds it on the north: to the eastward and southward, it is terminated by the Japanic ocean, and part of Great Tartary. The whole length of Siberia, from east to west, amounts to nine hundred German leagues, its provinces stretching even as far as the river Argun, which is within a few days journey of the famous wall of China: but the breadth from north to south does not exceed four hundred German leagues.
<PB N="380" REF="3950"/>
This country is thinly inhabited by people of the Tartarian race, scattered in various tribes, and di∣stinguished by different appellations: but that of Siberia, bestowed upon it since it was conquered by the Russians, is derived from a Sclavonic word, signifying a prison, so called, because it is the place to which the Czar exiles those who incur his dis∣pleasure. State-prisoners are sent hither, either for their whole lives, or for a certain term of years, according to the nature of their crimes, or rather the resentment and caprice of their sovereign. Some are indulged with a very small allowance for their subsistence; others are left to live upon pur∣chase; but all of them are obliged to bring in a weekly tribute of furs to the Czar, otherwise they are severely punished by their task-masters. Thus circumstanced, they often lie in the open fields, amidst all the rigours of the most severe winter; and they find it necessary to learn the utmost dex∣terity in shooting the wild beasts in the head with a single ball: for, should the furs be pierced with shot-holes, or stained with blood, the delinquent will be punished with great cruelty. The country of Siberia is wild, desolate, intensely cold, barren, and poorly inhabited; roughened with huge mountains and impenetrable forests, and abound∣ing with frozen lakes, fens, and morasses: yet, even amidst these dreary wastes, some beautiful plantations have been made by the art and in∣dustry of the unhappy exiles, banished to this remote and inhospitable corner of the earth. Siberia was discovered and conquered by the Russians, in the reign of Iwan Basilowitz. A notorious robber, called Temefoiewitz, obtained his pardon by the intercession of one Straginaff, a man of great opulence, on condition that he should reduce Siberia to the Czar's subjection. He forthwith assembled his companions, the ban∣ditti,
<PB REF="3960"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A View of Tobolski.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="381" REF="3970"/>
with whom he had associated, and being sup∣plied with arms, boats, and other necessaries, by Straginaff, set out upon this expedition. After having passed many rivers, and performed fa∣tiguing marches through a cold and desart coun∣try, he arrived at the fortress of Tumeen, situated on the river Toru, about the forty-fifth degree of latitude. Having made himself master of this confine, he proceeded up the river by water as far as the city of Tobolski, which he likewise re∣duced. This adventurer being accidentally drown∣ed in the sequel, the Czar sent thither a strong army, which finished the conquest of the whole country. Ever since that period, Siberia has been tributary to the Russian empire, and governed by a waiwode, or vice-roy. Tobolski, the capital, is situated at the confluence of the Tobol and Ir∣tisk, in the latitude of fifty-eight. The city stands upon the ascent of a high hill, the lower part of which is inhabited by Mahometan Tartars, who carry on a considerable traffick up the river Irtisk, and convey their merchandize quite across Great Tartary, as far as China. The river Irtisk is reckoned as rapid as the Danube; runs from the south, and empties itself into the Oby: the Tobol washes the other side of the town, and a little be∣low it, falls into the Irtisk. By means of these two rivers, there is a constant flow of merchandize into the city during the summer season. Tobolski is therefore a great mart for the commodities of Muscovy, Tartary, and other countries; and here is a great concourse of merchants. All sorts of provision are plentiful and cheap. An hundred weight of rice is sold for sixteen copecs, equal to about eight-pence sterling; a sturgeon, weighing forty pounds, for half that money; an ox for two rix-dollars, and every other article in pro∣portion: the adjacent country abounds with game

<PB N="381" REF="3990"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="382" REF="4000"/>
in great variety. The supreme court of judicature for all Siberia is held in this city, which is also the seat of a metropolitan, sent hither from Mos∣cow to exercise spiritual jurisdiction over the whole kingdom. Tobolski is well fortified, and defended by a strong garrison, under the com∣mand of the waiwode, who resides in the place, and takes charge of the fur tribute, which is here deposited in proper magazines. This governor enjoys a very extensive command, and can occa∣sionally bring into the field nine thousand men, besides a strong body of Tartars on horseback, to make head against the Khalmucks and Cossacks, in their repeated incursions. A sufficient number of Russians, called Jemskoiks, are kept in conti∣nual pay by the government, on the banks of the Irtisk, to supply travellers on the Czar's account with men, boats, or carriages, to convey them as far as Surgut on the Oby, a voyage of two hun∣dred leagues by water. This is the common me∣thod of travelling in the summer; but in winter the journey by land is not half so long, being per∣formed in sleds over the ice and snow, with which the country is covered. These sleds are moved by a pair of dogs, which will draw a load of three hundred pounds with surprising expedition. They are hired at easy rates, and during one half of the year, may be seen flying over the snow in great numbers.</P>
<P>On the river Irtisk, about fifty leagues north of Tobolski, is the town of Demianskoi, a place of considerable traffick, and well fortified in the Russian manner. On the same river, about twen∣ty leagues above its confluence with the Oby, stands the town of Somaroskoi-jam. There was another place in this neighbourhood, called Ols∣coygorod; but it was destroyed by order of the governor of Siberia, for what reason we cannot
<PB N="383" REF="4010"/>
declare. They have built, however, another town, called Zergolt, about fifty leagues below Olscoy∣gorod, in a sort of an island formed by the Oby. About fifteen days journey northward from To∣bolski, near the confines of Petzora, stands the fortress of Pohem, on the side of a river that runs into the Tobol. Here is likewise a town inhabited by Muscovites, sent hither from several parts of Siberia, to make a considerable settlement, on account of the fertility of the soil, and of the woods, which are stocked with a variety of wild beasts; such as foxes, sables, wolves, and leopards, that yield valuable furs. Tumeen, situated on the river Tora, in the fifty-fifth degree of latitude, is a strong and populous city, chiefly inhabited by Russians. The country around it is fertile and well cultivated, well shaded with woods, and in∣terspersed with a great number of villages. These forests produce red foxes, wolves, bears, and the choicest grey squirrels of the whole Russian em∣pire. They are not sold to the merchants, but wholly set apart for the use of the Czarina. Ja∣panzin stands on the same river, about five-and-forty leagues to the north-west of Tumeen; built in the latter end of the sixteenth century, as a stage or halting place for travellers. Here the Czarina maintains a numerous garrison, under the command of a governor, who distributes from hence corn and other provisions to those garri∣sons and fortresses that are situated in desart, un∣cultivated countries. Tora is a place of conside∣rable trade, built by the Muscovites on the river Irtisk, about forty-six leagues to the south-east of Tobolski. Surgut, situated on the river Oby, is a paultry town, wretchedly built, and thinly in∣habited by people so indigent, that they can hardly procure cloaths to defend them from the severity of the weather. The inhabitants of the adjacent
<PB N="384" REF="4020"/>
territory are still more miserable. They are very little acquainted with agriculture; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hunting sables, ermines, black foxes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and hyenas. The ermines of this district <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> counted the best in all Siberia: the skin of a black fox will sell for two or three hundred rubles: the hyena is a fierce rapacious animal, that will lurk among the boughs of a tree, and dart itself occa∣sionally at a hart, elk, or rein-deer; on the back of which it will fasten itself by its claws and teeth, and there continue until the animal drops down, either with the loss of blood, or the fatigue of running: the beavers are well known for their sa∣gacity and ingenuity in cutting timber, and build∣ing habitations of different stories. If we may be∣lieve the Siberians, one nation of these animals declare war against another, and the victors en∣slave the vanquished, compelling them to labour hard for their subsistence. In the latitude of 58°° 50′, about an hundred and ten leagues to the east∣ward of Tobolski, stands Narim, capital of a ter∣ritory that bears the same name, a large and po∣pulous town, situated on the Oby, secured by a strong fortress, and defended by a strong garrison of Cossacks. The woods in this district yield plenty of furs; but the country is cold, barren, and very thinly inhabited by the Ostiacks, a bru∣tal, ignorant, and slothful people. They worship deformed wooden idols of very rude workman∣ship. They cloath themselves in the skins of stur∣geon, with which this river abounds. They are subject to certain chiefs, by them stiled Knescas, who collect the tribute which is yearly paid to the Empress of Russia. Among other articles, they are said to pay a certain quantity of gold, which is gathered on the sides of rivers after torrents. They live in wretched huts, which are partly under-ground; but they have no considerable
<PB N="385" REF="4030"/>
towns or villages. Thirty leagues to the south∣ward of Narim stands Tomskoi, a strong frontier town, and capital of a province, situated on the river Tora, near the place where it falls into the Oby. Besides these cities, which we have de∣scribed, there are several other towns and fortresses built on the confines and rivers of this kingdom. In the present century, a certain number of Sibe∣rians, being sent upon discoveries, travelled east∣ward in sledges through waste and desart tracts, in which, however, they found abundance of trees, plants, and rivers; and, at the end of three weeks, arrived in a level champain country, inhabited by a savage people, who called them∣selves Tingoesi. Their language was hardly arti∣culate, but so guttural, that it resembled the gabbling of a turkey-cock. They dwell in huts along the great river Jeniscea, which takes its rise from the lake Bagkal, and, running northward five-and-twenty degrees, dissembogues itself into the Northern Ocean. In summer it overflows the flat country, like the Nile, to the extent of seventy leagues. Whenever it begins to swell, the Tin∣goese remove, with all their cattle and effects, to the mountains, where they remain till the inun∣dation subsides: then they return to the place of their former residence, and feed their flocks on the rich pasture produced by the slime which the river has left upon the lands. In the year after this excursion, a company of Muscovites, attend∣ed by some Samoiedes and Tingoese, as their guides and interpreters, took the same route to the eastward, and proceeded as far as the river Pesida, which is not quite so large, but as rapid as the Jeniscea. On the hither banks of this Pesida, they found a race of savage people, brawny and robust, with great heads and little eyes. They gave the Russians to understand by signs, that on
<PB N="386" REF="4040"/>
the other side of the river, they frequently heard the sound of bells, which they expressed by re∣peating om, om. The curiosity of the waiwode of Siberia being excited by the report of these tra∣vellers, he, in the following year, detached se∣ven hundred men to prosecute the discovery. They encamped on the banks of the Pesida, in order to wait the return of spring; and confirmed the truth of the former reports. When the wind set towards them, they could distinctly hear the sound of bells, and even the noise of horses tra∣velling on the other side of the river. They like∣wise fancied they saw vesseis with square sails, such as are common in India. In the month of April, the ice began to thaw, and in a little time the country was covered with a variety of flowers, fruits, and verdure: beasts of different kinds ap∣peared in the fields, and the birds began to warble in every grove. These agreeable circumstances, one would imagine, should have induced them to cross the river, and pursue their design: but, like true Muscovites, they returned by slow marches, and arrived, in the autumn, at Tobolski. The river Pesida is supposed to be the boundary of Cathai on that side; and the court of Russia still resolved to make further discoveries. The go∣vernor of Siberia sent thither another caravan by land, and a good number of seamen, in covered vessels, down the river Oby into the Northern Sea, that they might survey the coasts of it as far as the mouth of the Jeniscea. He gave them in∣structions, importing, that the first who arrived at this mouth, whether by land or water, should wait a whole year for the others, and then return by the different routes they had followed. The en∣terprize was atchieved by both companies, who sent their several journals sealed to the court of Moscow, where, however, they seem to have met
<PB N="387" REF="4050"/>
with little or no regard, inasmuch as no use has been made of their discoveries. The indolence of the Russians, with respect to discoveries in this quarter, is the less excusable, as they may be conveyed through the greater part of this vast tract of land by means of navigable rivers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>The most considerable of these is the Jeniscea, which takes its rise from some lakes near a ridge of high mountains, in the southern part of Siberia, and running towards the north-west, traverses the land of Kurgesses: by this time it is become considerable by the addition of many brooks and rivers, particularly by the Angura, which issuing from the lake Baykal, waters the city of Jeniscea, or Jeniskoi; and by the Pedkamena and Ton∣gusca: thus swelled, it enters Samoiedia, where it receives many other streams, and, among the rest, the river Nizaia Tongusca, which runs through the territories of the Tongusci, famous for the monastery of Troitsiogo, and the town of Tur∣ganscoi. The Jeniscea is afterwards augmented by the Schoriga, Coresiga, Gataka, Ubo, and the Gusina, two branches of which form the island of that name. The Jeniscea, being inlarged by all these bodies of water, winds along the eastern side of the great ridge of mountains; then dividing itself, falls into the Frozen Sea, forming an island opposite to Nova Zembla. Between the Nisnaia Tongusca, and the Godkama Zongusca, there are some volcanoes, that have been known to discharge smoke and flame, even in this climate, bound by eternal frost. On the banks of this great river, near the confines of the Ostiacks and Tongusi, is situated the town of Jeniscea, a large, strong, and populous place, well supplied with flesh, fowl, game, fish, corn, millet, rue and
<PB N="388" REF="4060"/>
other grain. These productions, however, the inhabitants must import from other countries; for the climate is so intensely cold, that scarce any thing can be brought to maturity. The common fruit-trees bear nothing but leaves, nor do we find any thing produced spontaneously in this territory, except some gooseberries and strawberries. This city of Jeniscea, or Jeniskoi, is the capital of the province of Dauria, bordering on the eastern part of Tartary, and conquered by the Muscovites: it is now subjected to the wai∣wode, or governor of Siberia, and counted part of that kingdom. Along the banks of the river, as well as in the adjacent meadows, the inhabitants dig out of the ground a kind of ivory, supposed to be the teeth of the behemoth, which some au∣thors have represented as an animal that lives under-ground, without being able to bear the light of day: but this description does not at all suit the character of the hippotamos, which is often seen in the rivers of Africa, particularly in the upper parts of the Gambia and Niger.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>Siberia is peopled by three different nations, namely, the Russians sent hither from Muscovy, either as officers, soldiers, planters, or exiles; the native Siberians, and colonies of Tartars: indeed Siberia was originally peopled from Tar∣tary, or the ancient Scythia. The Tongusci, or proper inhabitants of Siberia, are divided into four tribes; the Podkamena Tongousi, who live be∣tween the rivers Jeniscea and Lena; the Sabatzki Tongousi, who inhabit the country lying between the Lena and the bay of Kamtzechatka, to the northward of the river Aldan; the Oleuni Ton∣gousi, who live near the sources of the Lena and
<PB N="389" REF="4070"/>
the Aldan, to the northward of the Amur; and the Conni Tongousi, seated between the lake Bag∣kal, and the city of Nerzenskoi, along the river Amur. These four tribes still retain, in their customs and physiognomy, evident marks of their Tartarian extract; though they are not so squat, flat nosed, and ugly as the Khalmucks; on the contrary, they are tall, stout, and active beyond all the Siberian Tartars. The tribes of Podka∣mena and Sabatzki differ very little in their way of living from their eastern and western neigh∣bours, the Ostiacks and Samoiedes, except in this particular; in summer, both men and women ap∣pear without any other covering than a leathern girdle about the middle, intended not so much for decency, as in order to screen those tender parts from the stings of insects generated in the lakes and marshes, so as to swarm in every part of this country, during the hot weather. In the winter, they are clad like their neighbours, in the skins of rein-deer, with the hair outwards, the shoes, stockings, and breeches being all formed of one piece. The head is covered with a cap of some other fur, variously fashioned, according to the taste or fancy of the wearer. In summer, they subsist on fish; and in winter, on the game they kill: but they have not sagacity enough to breed cattle; nor do they use any animal but rein-deer and dogs. Persons of distinction are known by a number of black sports, with which they stain the skin of their faces and hands, by way of orna∣ment. Their dead they hang upon trees, until the flesh rots off, and then they inter the skele∣ton. The Oleuni Tongousi are not quite so bar∣barous and brutish as the other tribes: they breed cattle, use the milk, and feast upon them occa∣sionally; yet their method of administering an oath is altogether beastly. He that administers
<PB N="390" REF="4080"/>
the test, stabs a dog in the belly, and the taker applying his mouth to the wound, sucks all the blood that flows from it; the by-standers being persuaded, that if he is perjured he will burst. Part of the country inhabited by this tribe is under the Chinese dominion; but all the rest be∣longs to Muscovy, and the natives are obliged annually to send a tribute of furs to the grand magazine of Siberia. The chief weapon they use in war is the hatchet, though, of late years, they have imported a kind of broad-sword, or cutlass, from their neighbours of Muscovy. These are worn by both sexes, which are trained alike to the exercise of arms. Both men and women are courageous, nimble, active, manage their wea∣pons and ride with uncommon dexterity; yet they are naturally pacific, and the different tribes live amicably with one another. They dwell in moveable huts, which they can shift occasionally; either for pleasure or convenience. In the summer, they travel along the lakes and rivers in canoes; and in winter, on sledges drawn by dogs or rein∣deer. Polygamy obtains among these people, to the most unbounded extent; and the husband is so absolute, that he can sell, barter, or exchange his wives at pleasure.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Siberian savages acknowledge a Supreme Being; but all their adoration is paid to wooden images of their own carving, rudely notched with knives, and as deformed as imagination can re∣present. In all probability, the design of those who invented such idols, was to inspire fear and terror, which are the strongest passions that influ∣ence and agitate the human mird. Great part of the Tartars, who inhabit Siberia, profess the reli∣gion of Mahomet; and the Russians adhere to the Greek communion.</P>

<HEAD>PRODUCE and COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Siberia lies in general unculti∣vated, and not a stalk of corn is to be seen. In∣stead of bread, the inhabitants use onions boiled up into a kind of pap or pudding, with a meal made of the roots of yellow lillies, dried and pounded. Vast quantities of fish are caught in their lakes and rivers, particularly salmon, stur∣geon, and bellugas: these last are frequently found twelve and fifteen feet long; the flesh is as white as veal, and extremely delicate. When the snow begins to melt, and increase the rapidity of the rivers, the sturgeons are said to swallow a consider∣able quantity of stones, to ballance their bodies against the violence of the current, which stones they throw up as soon as the floods are abated. The best iron in Muscovy is produced from the mines and forges of Siberia; but the great re∣venue of this province arises from the article of furs, which amounts to an immense value. Among the productions of Siberia, we likewise enumerate the ivory manufactured from the teeth of the animal, which we have describ∣ed above, under the denomination of behemoth. The great caravan, between Moscow and China, passes through this province, the merchants of which barter these furs, together with commodities brought from Archangel, for the merchandize of China, such as tea, silks, and a kind of stuff made of linnen and cotton, much worn by the Russian women. Another advantage, which the Russian emperor derives from the possession of Siberia, is a constant supply of recruits for his army, from the large and numerous garrisons of this country, considered as nurseries for the most hardy and intrepid soldiers of the Muscovite empire. By a treaty of peace, concluded between the emperor
<PB N="392" REF="4100"/>
of China and the Czar in the year 1691, the ri∣ver Argun was agreed to be the boundary between the two empires. The Argun runs into the Sag∣hadian river, which disembogues itself into the sea of Kamtszatka.</P>

It is bounded on the west by the Petzora river, and the Uporcean mountains, and on the east by the Argun, which is the boundary between Russia and China. It is divided into the districts of Obdora, Manamo, and Leppa: the first runs along the west side of the Oby, and the other two are situated on the east side of that river. The people are distinguished into many different tribes, such as the Beresofskoi, the Guitorses, the Truchamskoi, and Mangazeiskoi, besides those that inhabit the banks of the Dwina, who are more savage and brutal than those that live to the eastward, along the coast of the Frozen Ocean. Each of these tribes speaks its own peculiar dialect; but the manners and customs of the whole nation are nearly the same.</P>

<HEAD>RIVERS, LAKES, MOUNTAINS, FORESTS, SOIL, and CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The chief rivers of Samoiedia are these: the Pet∣zora, rising from the lake Petzercoe, and falling into the Northern Sea, between cape Caudenois and the Streights of Weigatz; the great river Oby, formed by many confluent streams, running thro' a vast tract of country, and discharging itself into the Streights of Weigatz, the Jeniska, Jeniscea or
<PB N="393" REF="4110"/>
Kemm, already described in our account of Sibe∣ria; the Olentez and the Lena, two considerable rivers, that likewise disembogue themselves into the Northern Ocean. The whole country abounds with lakes, is encumbered with mountains, and shagged with forests of pine and fir-tree: the soil is barren and uncultivated, because there is not warmth sufficient for the vegetation of corn or cu∣linary plants; for the climate is intensely cold, and here winter may be said to reign in all his terrors.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their MANNERS and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>The people who inhabit this dreary waste, are known by the denomination of <HI>Samoiedes,</HI> which is a Russian epithet, signifying <HI>man-eaters,</HI> though very unjustly applied to these poor, miserable sa∣vages. They resemble the Laplanders in their lowness of stature, their broad flat faces, small eyes, and large heads: their complexion is of a dark, greasy, olive hue; their features, both in men and women, are coarse, and their limbs ill turned; so that on the whole they exhibit a very disagreeable appearance. Their hair is black, thick and woolly: that of the women is plaited on each side of the face, and ornamented with brass trin∣kets. The head, in both sexes, is covered with a fur cap, white on the inside, and black without. They are clad from head to foot in deer skins with the hair outwards in summer, and inwards in win∣ter; and their finery consists in slips of red, yel∣low, and blue cloth sewed upon these garments. The men wear breeches and stockings of one piece: the women have short petticoats of fur, reaching half way down the leg, which is covered with a kind of buskin of the same skin: in winter, both men and women use a kind of long skates, with which they glide over the snow and ice with sur∣prising
<PB N="394" REF="4120"/>
ease and expedition. Their constitutions are hardened by the severity of the climate. They are strong, active, and so laborious, that they very often work themselves into a prosuse sweat, in spite of the intense cold; in that case they wipe themselves with an handful of the thin shavings of fir, which they carry about with them for this purpose, as well as to perform the other offices of an handkerchief. These poor savages feed upon raw flesh, guts, garbage, and even stinking carrion, and are nasty beyond all concep∣tion. They eat dried fish instead of bread; and the wild beasts which they kill in hunting supply them with meat for immediate use, as well as with winter store. No town or village is to be seen in this desolate province: the people dwell in tents or caverns. During the summer they wander from place to place, for the conveniency of pasture to their rein-deer, or in quest of their game which they kill with arrows. They are counted excel∣lent archers, as being trained up to the exercise of the bow from their infancy. In a word, they bear a strong affinity to the Laplanders in their per∣sons, their education, and their way of living; but are, if possible, more ignorant and brutal. Their country too resembles Lapland, whether we consi∣der its climate, soil, appearance or productions. The Samoiedes travel like the Laplanders in sledges drawn by rein-deer, which draw with such vigour and activity, that a man may travel in this manner above two hundred miles in one day. In the summer season, which lasts about three months, they lodge in occasional tents made of the green skins of the beasts they kill, and these, for want of dressing, stink abominably. At the approach of winter they retire to their holes or caverns, dug under the surface of the earth, and covered with a conical roof made of boughs or fish bones secured
<PB N="395" REF="4130"/>
by thongs, and lined with the skins of rein-deer. In this sort of habitation the Samoiedes shut them∣selves up for the winter, amidst the stench of their provision, and the smoke of the fuel which they burn. This has no other vent but a hole at the top, which, when their wood is burnt to a coal, they stop with a cake of ice; this transmits a faint glimmering of light: when they have occasion to see more distinctly, they light a lamp, which they feed with fish oil, that diffuses a most abominable odour. It is not easy to conceive a situation more wretched than that of these unhappy people, half starved with cold, half stifled with the smoke of green wood, half suffocated with stench, and half dead with hunger; for their whole winter food consists of a little dried fish, and scanty meals of the venison they kill and preserve in the summer, by hanging it up in the wind: yet these people, miserable as they may seem to be, are not without their enjoyments. Their families maintain a so∣cial intercourse one with another, even in the win∣ter, by means of trenches drawn between the tents or caverns, which trenches are covered and vault∣ed with ice and snow in such a manner as to form a kind of subterranean gallery, securely defended from the rigour of the external air. They are even so infatuated as to believe their country is the earthly paradise, and their climate the most agree∣able in the world. Two of their deputies that were sent to the court of Moscow scrupled not to declare, that if the Czar knew the charms of their country, he would certainly fix his residence in Samoiedia. They beheld the pomp and magni∣ficence of the Russian court with surprize and ad∣miration; but they preferred their own way of living to all the luxury of the court, and longed impatiently to revisit their own stinking habitati∣ons. The Samoiedes lived formerly in obedience
<PB N="396" REF="4140"/>
to certain chiefs, who exercised a sort of patriar∣chal authority over them, and received a tribute from every family. This kind of police still re∣mains in force among them, though they own themselves subjects to the empire of Russia, and pay a yearly tax of furs to the emperor. They may likewise appeal for justice and protection to the Muscovite waiwode and officers appointed for that purpose. A man who is inclined to marry, purchases the bride of her parents for three or four rein-deer, which are counted equal in value to the best lady in Samoiedia. He can purchase as many wives as he chuses to maintain, and repu∣diate them at will, without any ceremony. When persons grow old and useless to the community, they are released from the miseries of life, by be∣ing drowned or dispatched in some other manner, and their bones are preserved as reliques. When a sucking infant dies, the parents suspend it on a tree, where it rots and putrefies by degrees: but children that die after being weaned, are interred.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Samoiedes entertain an imperfect notion of a Supreme Being, the creator and ruler of the world, whom they stiled <HI>Heyha:</HI> they likewise be∣lieve in a future state of rewards and punishments; but they pay their adoration to nought but vi∣sible aspects, such as the sun, moon, and stars, with some particular birds and beasts, the favour∣ites of their fancy. They likewise worship wooden idols, and are much addicted to sorcery. It can∣not be supposed that there should be a regular sys∣tem of religion among such a savage people. Nevertheless, there are certain persons who exer∣cise a sort of sacerdotal authority over them, by pretending to superior knowledge in the art of di∣vination.
<PB N="397" REF="4150"/>
To these impostors, who are called <HI>Sia∣mans</HI> or conjurers, they have recourse, when they want to know the success of an enterprize, or any circumstance of future fortune. It must be ob∣served, however, that these horrid and absurd rites of barbarous superstition, are interdicted un∣der the most severe penalties, by the Russian go∣vernment, which has been at great pains to con∣vert these wretches to Christianity, and to civilize them by means of a regular police, instruction, and example. Since the conquest of this province the Russians have built several towns in Samoie∣dia, namely, Loppa, which may be termed the ca∣pital, Olschaygorod, Nazenskoi, Tumeen, and Zer∣golt, which last stands on an island formed by the river Oby. They have established governors and magistrates, instituted fairs, and supplied the na∣tives with some of the conveniencies of life. Not∣withstanding all these efforts, however, the Samoie∣des may still be classed among the most barbarous and brutal tribes that belong to human nature.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RUSSIAN LAPLAND.</HEAD>
<P>Muscovitish Lapland is bounded on the north by the Northern Ocean; on the east and south by the White Sea, and the river Zoloticza; and on the west by Danish Lapland. It is divided into three districts, namely, Leporia Mounemauskoi, or Ma∣ritime Leporia, situated on the south-east of Da∣nish Lapland; Teriskoi, or inland Leporia; and Bellamoureskoi Leporia. This whole country resembles that of Swedish Lapland, which we have already described, and is inhabited by the very same people, from whom they differ in nothing but in the rites of the Greek church, which the Christians of Muscovite Lapland profess. In or∣der the more easily to govern, civilize, and fleece these people, the Czars have built towns in their
<PB N="398" REF="4160"/>
country, and sent thither governors, priests, and collectors, who administer justice, preach the Chris∣tian religion according to the rites of the Greek communion, and gather the yearly tribute or re∣venue of furs. These towns, however, both in Lapland and Samoiedia, are no other than Mus∣covitish colonies, that subsist by traffick with the savages, as well as with the merchants of different nations that visit the coast: accordingly all, or the greater part of their towns, are situated on the sea∣side. Mounemauskoi Leporia can boast of very few towns, except Kola, a small place and har∣bour situated on the mouth of the river Kola, which discharges itself into the Muscovean Ocean. This is counted the metropolis of the whole country, and stands in latitude 68. 55. between Ward∣wyss and the White Sea. Terrskoi Leporia, or the eastern part of Russian Lapland, is almost sur∣rounded with the sea, and forms indeed the gulph of the White Sea. The chief towns in this district are Warsiga and Lackena; the first situated on the south coast, opposite to Archangel; the other a sea-port situated at the mouth of the river Lac∣kena, which falls into the Northern Ocean. Bel∣lamoureskoi Leporia lies at the bottom of the White Sea, and is as cold, mountainous, and barren as the other parts of Lapland. The chief town is Soma, standing on the frontiers of Muscovitish Ca∣relia, and may be termed the key of Russian Lap∣land on the White Sea. There are other towns of less consideration in Russian Lapland, such as Kierni, standing near the mouth of the river Zolo∣luza; Zoloski, situated on an island of the same name, on which there is a monastery; Kerrelli, on the mouth of another river; Kemeloc, built on an island surrounded with lesser isles; Kovoda situated at the mouth of a river that, issuing from the lake Pagerfwi, falls into the gulph Ombai. Wolna∣ostrof,
<PB N="399" REF="4170"/>
built on an island of the same name, which signifies the island of <HI>Deer;</HI> Tauria, Soutkiti, Cas∣cavarou, Warsiga, Polengi, and Pelitza, inconsi∣derable places that hardly deserve to be menti∣oned; Jackna, on a river of the same name abounding with salmon; Kildwin, built on an island of the same name; Polina, an inland town on the lake Polina-ozero; and a town and monaste∣ry on the river Petzinska. The coast of Muscovitish Lapland is famous for capes, bays, and islands; among these we number cape Tauria, Sousnauritz, or the island of the cross, with three other isles at the mouth of the river Ponoi; cape Orlogone, with a bay and harbour, at the entrance into the White Sea; the isles of Lambacho; the cape, isles, and bay of Sweetenoes; Nookostrof, called by the Dutch, Nagel Egland, or Nail island; the mari∣ner's bay; seven islands at the mouth of a name∣less river; the golden bay; Daelna Olignia, or farther Olignia, Daelna Silensi, or farther Silensi; port Gabriel; port of Waronica; Bliesna Olignea, or nearer Olignea; Bliesna Silensi, or nearer Si∣lensi; the island and lake of Kola, and the fisher∣man's island. All these waters produce great plen∣ty of delicious fish.</P>

<HEAD>NOVA ZEMBLA. SITUATION, CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>Nova Zembla, signifying in the Russian lan∣guage, New Land, is a country separated from Samoiedia by the Streight of Weigatz, which the Hollanders call Strait Van Nassau, lying in the 70th degree of latitude. Whether Nova Zembla be an island, or joined to the continent of Greenland on the west, or Tartary on the east, is not yet deter∣mined. This country was discovered in the year 1553 by captain Hugh Willoughby, an English mariner, who was obliged, by stress of weather, to
<PB N="400" REF="4180"/>
put into a port of Lapland, where he and his whole crew perished with cold. About three years after this unfortunate expedition, captain Bur∣roughs of the same nation doubled the north cape, and discovered the Streights of Weygatz, which hath since been visited by ships of different nations, that sailed thither in hope of discovering a north-east passage through these streights into China. In the latter end of the sixteenth century, some Dutch seamen wintered in Nova Zembla, and found the cold so intense, that it was with the utmost difficul∣ty they could keep themselves alive. From the fourth day of January to the twenty-fourth day of June, the sun totally disappeared, and had no light but from the moon, which, from the first to the last quarter, shone day and night, without in∣termission.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>Nothing can be more desolate and forlorn than the face of this country, which is generally cover∣ed with snow and ice, and penetrating several feet below the surface: the parts from which the snow melts in the summer, are dreary quagmires coated with moss, which produces nothing but a few blue and yellow flowers. The shore is almost one con∣tinued rock of ice, or rather mountains piled to a prodigious height, on one another, and huge float∣ing fragments continually dashing against their base, which the sea has undermined in many places, forming hideous chasms and caverns, effecting dreadful disruptions, and leaving prodigious masses of rugged ice that seem to hang in the air, and threaten instantaneous ruin. As ships proceed in sailing into the Streight of Weigatz, these icy mountains, known by the name of Pater Nosters, seem to close on every side, and bar all farther progress; hence the streight acquired the name of
<PB N="401" REF="4190"/>
Weigatz, or impassable. Notwithstanding the se∣verity of this climate, there is a verdant island at the mouth of these streights, covered with fir and juniper, and abounding with penguin, a species of water-fowl, larger than a swan, and much bet∣ter tasted, secured with a thick skin, covered with a kind of down, but not sufficiently fledged to take flight, so that it is easily knocked down with∣out the help of gunpowder.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRODUCTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Besides the penguin, Nova Zembla produces other birds and animals that can subsist in the cold∣est climates, such as large white bears, which are rendered so fierce and ravenous by famine, that they have been known to plunge into the sea, and attack ships in great numbers; foxes, ermines, and little creatures resembling rabbits, though no bigger than rats: nay, some larks have been per∣ceived in this inhospitable country.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their CUSTOMS and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>Nova Zembla is thinly inhabited by a people more brutal and deformed than the Samoiedes. They are more short, squat, and ugly than their northern neighbours: they have squeaking voices: they waddle like ducks, and as they feed upon flesh and fish without salt, and stinking oil, the smell of their breath is intolerable. The men have little or no hair on their heads; but their beards are strong and bushy: whereas the women have long hair, which falls down in different plaits upon their shoulders: these likewise adorn their noses and ears with pendants of blue stones: but their com∣plexion and features are forbidding and horrible. In a word, they are extremely stupid, and scarce
<PB N="402" REF="4200"/>
have a title to humanity. Those who live on shore differ very much in their garb from the fishermen who go to sea in their canoes. The landmen and women are dressed much after the same fashion, in strait waistcoats and breeches, made of the skins of penguins unpicked: they wear a kind of hose formed of scalken, and on their heads a sort of co∣nical cap or bonnet. The male wears an ax on his shoulder, a bow in his hand, and a quiver with arrows slung at his back: the female wields a dart in her hand, appears with her long hair twisted, her chin and forehead painted with blue streaks, and her ears and nose loaded with jewels of blue stones and fish-bone. The fisherman is clad in a dress entirely composed of seal-skin, the tails hang∣ing dangling between his legs. His canoe is made of fish bones artfully joined, and neatly covered with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns sewed together. It is entirely close abo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, except one hole about the middle, in which the owner sits so as to fill up the whole cavity by means of a skin laced about his body, that will not admit one drop of water. Thus equipped he will venture to sea in very rough weather, and should be chance to be overset, he can right himself imme∣diately, the ballance between his body and the ca∣noe is so nicely adjusted. By means of a paddle he makes his way through the water with incon∣ceivable expedition: when he comes ashore, he throws his b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at upon his shoulder, and, thus en∣cumbered, can run with amazing swiftness. These people have an aversion to spirits and tobacco, which are so acceptable to the Laplanders and Sa∣moiedes. They live upon the beasts they kill in hunting, and the fish they catch along shore: their drink is the simple element; but they look upon train-oil as a dainty. They have no regular system of religion, but worship the sun, moon, and stars, together with certain wooden idols in human
<PB N="403" REF="4210"/>
shape, rudely formed by the work of their own hands. The wooden work of their bows and darts is aukward and clumsy: their arrows are well fea∣thered, and neatly armed with fish-bone, of which likewise they make their needles and other instru∣ments. Yet from this country, inhospitable as it may seem to be, the Emperor of Muscovy may derive great advantages, not only in the article of furs, which are always valuable in proportion to the coldness of the climate in which they are procured; but likewise in the fishery of the sea∣horse <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This animal, known by the name of Morse, is about the size of an ordinary horse, with large tusks, which are counted preferable to those of the elephant. They are am∣phibious creatures, and go a∣shore on the rocks about No∣va Zembla and Spitzrergen, where they lie in great mul∣titudes, and are easily killed; besides their teeth, they yield great quantities of oil, which is a valuable commodity.</NOTE>, whose teeth are preferable to ivory. Those creatures, otherwise known by the name of Morse, are found in great plenty about the Streights of Weygatz, of different sizes, from seven to seven∣teen feet in length, and are very easily struck and caught by means of the fish-gigg and harpoon.</P>

<HEAD>THE ISLANDS OF SHETLAND and ORKNEY.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Their NUMBER and SITUATION.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we may leave no land behind us in the northern latitudes, we will now return to the British isles, beginning with the most northerly, which are those of Shetland, or Zetland, lying from the 59th to the 61st degree of latitude, in the mid-seas, between Norway, Hudson's Bay, and the north-coast of Scotland; the most southern point of Shetland, called Swinburgh-Head, being at the distance of twenty leagues from Sunda, one of the most northern isles of Orkney. Shetland is composed of about forty-six separate islands, besides about forty smaller holmes, and thirty barren rocks surrounded by the sea, and this cluster is supposed to be the Thule of the antients, who placed here their Elysium, on account of the great length of their days in summer.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of these islands is keen, piercing, and salutary, insomuch that the people live to an un∣common old age, and are very little subject to distempers. During the months of June and
<PB N="405" REF="4230"/>
July, they can see to read at midnight, and the air is generally serene through the whole summer. This is their season both of pleasure and emolu∣ment; for their sea is then covered with fishing∣vessels, sent from different nations, to catch her∣rings, which swarm along the coast; and their towns are filled with a concourse of foreigners, who drive a considerable traffic on shore. To ballance these advantages, they undergo a winter of eight months, during which they are involved in darkness, storms, and tempests: not a ship visits them in this dreary season: but they are cut off from all communication with other countries, from the month of October till May. The revo∣lution of 1688, which happened in November, was not known in Shetland till the ensuing May, when that event was signified to them by a fisher∣man from Scotland. They were so far from be∣lieving the news, that they committed the man to prison, as a spreader of treasonable reports; and had not his tidings been speedily confirmed by the arrival of other strangers, in all probability they would have cost him his life.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their CUSTOMS, LANGUAGE, and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Shetlanders were originally a colony from Norway, to which they were long subject, and paid a kind of tribute, called <HI>schat,</HI> from whence the country derived the name of Schetland: but the islands were ceded by treaty to the King of Scotland, for a valuable consideration, some cen∣turies ago, and since that period have been an∣nexed to the Scottish crown, forming, with the isles of Orkney, one stewardry, or shire, which sends one member to parliament. The people of Shetland were soon intermixed with the Low∣landers
<PB N="406" REF="4240"/>
of Scotland, so as to become quite a Scottish colony: they now speak the language, wear the dress, and follow the customs of that country: yet, in some of the most northern isles, the commonalty use the old Norwegian dialect, which they call Norse; many learn Dutch of the Hollanders, by whom they are annually visited on the fishery; and they retain some old customs that plainly denote their original. They are ge∣nerally simple, honest, religious, hospitable, and humane. They live amicably one with another, and should any accidental quarrel produce animo∣mosity, one of the neighbours commonly makes a feast, in order to compromise the dispute, and reconcile the parties. Their chief nourishment is fish, which not only supplies them with food, but likewise with oil, which they burn in lamps dur∣ing the winter season. Wood they have none; but plenty of turf, peat, and heath, which serves them for fuel. Their common drink is whey, which they barrel up and deposite in cellars, after it has undergone a kind of fermentation, which gives it a vinous quality: they likewise drink butter-milk mixed with water. The inhabitants of the lesser isles subsist upon the eggs and flesh of sea-fowl, to whose nests they climb with great dexterity, or are lowered down by ropes over precipices, at the imminent danger of their lives: they are like∣wise very expert at fire-arms. Those who possess estates in Shetland, are of Scotch families, and live elegantly, like the gentry of that kingdom. Their houses are neat and fashionable; their tables well supplied with a variety of dishes; and they commonly have a good stock of wine, beer, and brandy in their cellars: they wear English cloth, made in the British fashion, and are remarkable for fine linnen. The Shetlanders have very little occasion for physicians: they cure the jaundice
<PB N="407" REF="4250"/>
with the powder of snail-shells, and the scurvy, to which they are subject, with the cochlearia, or scurvy-grass, found in great plenty on these islands. Much more care is taken of their spiritual welfare. They profess the protestant religion, according to the form and discipline of the kirk of Scotland, by which they are supplied with pastors; and the people, on the whole, are sober, religious, and exemplary. The same government prevails here as in the Orkneys, which we shall describe in the next article.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>The soil of this country is, for the most part, barren, rocky, or sandy. Wheat will not ripen, and oats do not thrive in these islands: but they produce good crops of barley, which is made into bread for common use, and found both wholesome and palatable. Here are no trees, and hardly any shrubs, except those planted and che∣rished in gardens, where, however, they can raise apples, pears, plumbs, gooseberries, strawberries, corinths, all kinds of pot-herbs and roots for the kitchen. The vallies, and even the hills, produce excellent pasture, and a great variety of plants that are common to all the northern countries of Europe. No venomous creature is found on these islands; nor was a weasel to be seen, until a faulconer, in revenge to the inhabitants, who had refused him the customary due, imported a male and female, which have bred prodigiously.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The Shetland horses, called <HI>schelties,</HI> though very small, are nevertheless strong, hardy, well shaped, nimble, and sure footed. They are fit for the plough and the saddle, and stout enough
<PB N="408" REF="4260"/>
to carry double, though so light, that an ordinary man may lift one of them from the ground: they are never housed, either in winter or summer, and have no other provender than the grass they can nibble: when this fails, they visit the sea-shore regularly, every ebb, and feed upon sea-ware. The same shift is practised by their black cattle and sheep, while the ground is covered with snow. These are likewise of a very small breed; but juicy, of a delicate flavour, and very fat in the summer. Their sheep are so prolific, that they bring forth two, and sometimes three at a time; but their lambs very often become a prey to the eagle: all domestic animals, and poultry, are raised as easily here as in any other country. Fowl of all sorts, particularly geese and ducks of various kinds, abound in these islands; we must, however, except heath-cocks, growse, and par∣tridges, which Shetland does not produce. Birds of prey are not wanting, such as eagles, hawks, kites, and crows of different kinds. The sea∣fowl swarm to such a degree, as even to darken the sea, and the inhabitants make advantage of their down and feathers. They arrive in the month of February, build among the rocks, where they sit very close together to hatch their eggs; and when their young are fledged, retreat to some other country. The sea produces whales, seals, and otters, and all sorts of fish in great abundance. Among these we number the cod, the ling, the tusk, and, above all, the herring, which is the chief source of advantage to these people, and brings considerable wealth to Holland, and might be an inexhaustible source of riches to Great Britain. No sooner does the mild season begin in this latitude, than the sea is covered with vessels, sometimes to the amount of two thousand. All the ports of Shetland are crowded
<PB N="409" REF="4270"/>
with strangers: every creek, sound, and channel is overspread with nets, which likewise appear on every hand at sea, to intercept the innumerable shoals of herrings, which annually migrate from the North Pole towards the more southerly lati∣tudes, and divide into two squadrons off the islands of Shetland. The Dutch only have been known to employ three thousand busses at once on this herring-fishery; and they, it must be owned, have enriched the towns of Shetland. During the summer season, they set up booths on shore, in which they traffick with the islanders, giving them wine, brandy, spices, and other commodities, as well as a considerable ballance of money, for their fish, live stock, hose, and mittens, which are the manufactures of Shetland. The same kind of commerce is carried on by the people of Ham∣burgh and Bremen, who go thither in May, and open shops in the principal towns and villages. Besides the fishes we have mentioned, the Shet∣landers catch great abundance of a species called seths, large, thick, and so fat, that one liver will produce two quarts of oil, which is exported for soap-making.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PARTICULAR ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The principal islands of Shetland are these: Mainland, Brassa, the Skerries, Burray, Whalsey, Vust, Yell, Fislar, Foula, Papaflour, and the Lyre Skerries. Mainland, extending sixty miles in length, and twenty in breadth, is indented by a great number of bays, and abounds with mosses, bogs, and mountains, so that it is more adapted for pasturage than corn: nevertheless, the low grounds, near the shore, produce oats and barley. On the east side of the island stands the princi∣pal town, Lerwick, consisting of about three
<PB N="410" REF="4280"/>
hundred families. Towards the west is situated Scalloway, which, though very small, is the seat of judicature; and here likewise the presbytery of Shetland assembles. It was formerly secured by a castle, now fallen into decay, in which there was once a garrison of English soldiers, sent thither by Oliver Cromwell. The island of Brassa, situ∣ated to the eastward of Mainland, is about five miles long, and two in breadth; has some arrable ground, and two churches; but is chiefly re∣markable for its sound, in which the great herring∣fishery is carried on. The landlords here are con∣siderable gainers, by letting out their ground and houses for shops to the Dutch and Hamburghers. The Skerries, Burray, Whalsey, and Vust, are inconsiderable islands, the largest and last not ex∣ceeding eight miles in length: but all of them are provided with churches; and in Vust, there are three good harbours. Yell in length amounts to sixteen miles, is indented like the figure of eight, has three churches and several chapels; but the country is moorish and barren. Feslar, or Fetlor, five miles in length, is remarkable for nothing, but the ruins of some watch-towers, which the na∣tives call Picts houses. These are from twenty to thirty feet high, twelve broad, and tapering to the top. The entries are very low, the windows long and narrow, the stairs run up between the walls, and under them are cells vaulted. They were built for watch-towers, or beacons, on the top of which the natives made signals, by fire, when they were alarmed by invasion. Foula, about three miles long, is remarkable for a rock, so high, that it may be seen in Orkney, and is supposed by some writers to have been the <HI>Ultima Thule</HI> of the antients. Papaflour is a small plea∣sant island, not exceeding two miles in length, having four commodious harbours, and abound∣ing
<PB N="411" REF="4290"/>
with corn, pasture, rabbits, and fuel. The Lyre Skerries are so called, because frequented by a species of fowl so named, which we shall describe in the next article.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>ISLANDS of ORKNEY: Their NUMBER, and SITUATION.</HEAD>
<P>The Orkney isles, called by the antients Or∣cades, lying in the Caledonian Sea, eighteen leagues from Shetland, between the fifty-eighth and sixtieth degrees of latitude, and in longitude from London, between 1° 30′, and 2° 50′, are divided on the south from Caithness, the most northern point of Scotland, by the Pentland, or Pictland Frith, from twelve to sixteen miles in breadth. They are in number about thirty; but not all inhabited, the greater part being small holmes that produce nothing but pasturage for sheep and goats. The principal islands are known by these denominations: South Ronaldsha, Swinna, Hoy, Burra, Lambholm, Flotta, Faira, Cava, Gramsey, Mainland, Copinsha, Strupensha, Dam∣sey, Inhallo, Stronsa, Papa-Stronsa, Sanda, North Ronaldsha, Eda, Rousa, Wyre, Garsa, Eglesha, North Faira, Westra, Papa-Westra. These terminations in a, ey, or ha, were, in the Teutonic, generally given to places surrounded with water. The cur∣rents and tides flowing between the islands, are extremely rapid; and in the neighbourhood of Swinna, are two great whirlpools, called the wells of Swinna, which are counted dangerous by ma∣riners, especially in a calm. When sailors find themselves sucked into the vortex, they throw overboard a barrel, or some bulky substance, which is said to smooth the vortex, until the vessel hath passed, to be swept down to the bottom, and thrown up again at a considerable distance:
<PB N="412" REF="4300"/>
when there is a breeze of wind, however, ships cross them without fear or hesitation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE, SOIL, PRODUCTIONS VEGETABLE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is pure and penetrating in summer: the winter, in this latitude, is cold, rainy, and tempestuous, not without frost and snow, which, however, are of short duration. The longest day in summer exceeds eighteen hours; and, for the greatest part of June, one may see to read at mid∣night, without a candle: at the winter solstice, the days are dark and short in proportion. The soil of the Orkneys is, in general, more fertile than that of Shetland: but differs in different islands, and indeed, in the same island, according to the variations in the face of the country. In some places the country is bare and mountainous; in others, low and marshy; and great part of the soil is found extremely dry and sandy. These islands bear plentiful crops of oats and barley, of which they make their bread; but they have no wheat, rye, or pulse, except what grows in well∣enclosed gardens. These, when duly cultivated, produce all manner of kitchen herbs, roots, salla∣dine, and even bring fruit-trees to maturity: but, in the open country, there is scarce a tree or shrub to be seen, except juniper, wild myrtle, heath, and the cyur-hodon: yet this deficiency cannot be imputed to the poverty of the soil, or the nature of the climate; for the trunks of large oaks are frequently dug up in the marshes. This is like∣wise the case in the most barren parts of the Highlands of Scotland, where not a shrub is to be seen above the surface of the earth: nay, the inhabitants frequently find, deep in the earth, the roots of large trees, evidently exhibiting marks
<PB N="413" REF="4310"/>
of the ax, by which they were felled: so that these northern parts must have undergone some strange revolutions. The Orkneys produce great variety of herbs and berries, grass and corn, which last is exported as far as Edinburgh. In some of the islands, the natives have discovered mines of tin, lead, and silver, though none of them are wrought to any advantage: in others, we find abundance of marl, grey and red slate, quarries of freestone, and even of marble and alabaster: when the wind rages to any violence, the sea throws in plenty of timber, torn from other coun∣tries, and, not unfrequently, the people find large pieces of ambergrease. The fresh water in these islands is very pure and limpid, and, though there are no large rivers in the Orkneys, the ground is well watered with lakes and pleasant rivulets, that not only serve to turn their mills, but also abound with trout of the most delicate flavour.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>Besides abundance of little horses, black cattle, sheep, swine, and rabbits, the inhabitants of the Orkneys rear all sorts of domestic animals, and tame poultry. Their heaths and commons yield plenty of red deer, and all sorts of game; par∣tridges, growse, heath-cocks, plover, duck, teal, and widgeon: the sea-coast teems with seals and otters; and are visited by whales, cod, ling, tusk, herrings, and all manner of fish: on the shore, they find sperma ceti, os sepiae, and a great va∣riety of shells and coralines, with a multitude of oysters, remarkably large muscles, crabs, and cockles. The rocks are covered with sea-fowl, wild geese, Solan geese, barnacles, lyres, eagles, hawks, and kites. With respect to the barnacles, or, as the natives call them, the cleck geese,
<PB N="414" REF="4320"/>
they are said to be found in shells sticking by the bills to trees, in several islands. Martin affirms he has seen them in this situation, but could not perceive them alive; and indeed the whole account of their generation and production, exhibited by the northern naturalists, is absurd and unphiloso∣phical. The Orkney eagles are so strong, that, ac∣cording to the reports of the country, they have been known to carry away young children in their talons. Certain it is, they make such havock a∣mong the lambs, that he who kills an eagle is en∣titled by law to a hen from every house in the pa∣rish where it was killed. The king's falconer vi∣sits these islands every year, in order to fetch away the young hawks and falcons from their nests among the precipices: he enjoys a yearly salary of twenty pounds, and may claim a hen, or a dog, from every house in the country, except those that are expressly exempted from this imposition.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their LANGUAGE, and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>The Orkneys, as well as the hills of Shetland, were originally peopled from Norway, in the ninth, tenth, or eleventh century; and the commonal∣ty still retain the language of that kingdom, di∣stinguished by the name of Norns: they likewise preserve some customs and measures of these Nor∣wegian ancestors. The islands of Orkney have been at different times subdued by the Scots, and re∣covered by the Norwegians: at length they were sold by Magnus, king of Norway, to Alexander of Scotland, for the sum of four thousand marks sterling, and a yearly acknowledgment of one hun∣dred marks. Since that period, the Orkneys have continued annexed to the crown of Scotland. The gentry of the Orkneys are civilized, polite, and hospitable, and live like those of Scotland, from
<PB N="415" REF="4330"/>
whom they are chiefly descended. They live com∣fortably, are remarkably courteous to strangers, and drink a great quantity of wine, with which their cellars are generally well stored. Indeed the inhabitants of the Orkneys may be now justly deemed a Scotch colony. They speak the lan∣guage, profess the religion, follow the fashions, and are subject to the laws of that people. They are frugal, sagacious, circumspect, religious, and hospitable. Their mariners are remarkably bold, active, dextrous, and hardy. Many surprizing in∣stances of longevity occur here, as well as in Shet∣land, of persons living to the age of one hundred and forty. The Orkney women are generally handsome and well shaped, and bring forth chil∣dren at a very advanced age. In the parish of Evie, and the year 1683, one Margery Bimhaster was delivered of a boy at the age of threescore and three. In the Orkneys, some particular lands are held by a tenure, called <HI>Udal Right,</HI> from Ulcius or Olaus king of Norway, who farmed the lands, on condition of receiving one-third of the pro∣duce; and this right devolved in succession, with∣out any charter granted by the sovereign. The inhabitants of Orkney, instead of measuring their corn, weigh it in pismores or pundlers. Their least denomination is a mark, consisting of eighteen ounces, and twenty-four marks make a lispound, which is a Danish quantity. The poorer sort of people in the Orkneys appear very meanly habited, with a piece of seal-skin instead of shoes; and, liv∣ing chiefly on salt-fish, are subject to the scurvy. They are very much addicted to superstitious rites; in particular, interpreting dreams and omens, and believing in the force of idle charms. On a par∣ticular day in harvest, they abstain from work, in consequence of a notion handed down from tradi∣tion, that should they employ this day in gathering
<PB N="416" REF="4340"/>
in their harvest, the ridges of the field would bleed with agony. For the cure of sundry distempers, especially an haemorrhage or bleeding, either in man or beast, they send the name of the patient to the conjurer, who, by means of a charm or spell, removes the disorder, though the patient and he are many miles asunder. The islands of Orkney, we have already observed, produce very bold, able, and hardy mariners. The common people, in ge∣neral, are inured to fatigue, and remarkably ad∣venturous, both in fishing, during rough weather, and in climbing the rocks for the flesh, eggs, and down of sea-fowl. Formerly, while they were ex∣posed to the invasions of the Norwegians, or wes∣tern islanders, every village was obliged to equip a large boat well manned; and all the fencible men appeared in arms, when the alarm was given by the beacons lighted on the tops of the rocks and highest mountains. These beacons, known by the name of ward-hills, are still to be seen in every island. Their corn land they enclose with mud or stone walls, to preserve it from the ravages of their sheep, swine, and cattle, which wander about at random, without being attended by herds∣men: their ordinary manure, especially near the sea-coast, is sea-weed, which they carefully gather and divide into equal portions. Their sheep are marked on the ears and nose; but so wild, that when they have occasion to sheer them in the month of May, they are obliged to hunt every in∣dividual, with dogs trained for that purpose. Their manner of catching sea-fowl is curious and parti∣cular. Under the rock where these fowls build they row their boat, provided with a large net, to the upper corners of which are fastened two ropes, lowered down from the top of the mountain by men placed in that station. These hoisting up the net, until it be spread opposite to the cliffs in which
<PB N="417" REF="4350"/>
the fowls are sitting, the boatmen below make a noise with a rattle, by which the fowls, be∣ing frightened, fly forwards into the bosom of the net, in which they are immediately enclosed and lowered down into the boat: others practise the method used in Iceland and Norway, and are low∣ered down by a single rope from the summit of the mountain; this is the constant way of robbing the hawk's nest. In these islands some strange effects are produced by thunder and lightning. In the year 1680 the lightning entering a cow∣house, in which twelve cows stood in a row, killed every second beast as she stood, and left the rest untouched. The distempers that prevail mostly in the Orkneys are agues, consumptions, scurvy, and itch. The agues, which abound in the spring, the natives cure with a diet-drink of bitters and antiscorbutics infused in ale: for phthisical com∣plaints they use the plant arby, and the caryophyl∣lus marinus boiled with sweet milk. Instead of the common method of cupping, the Orkney surgeon scarifies the part with a knife, and, applying a horn, sucks the air out at the small end with his mouth. Others pretend to remove pains and aches by ex∣tracting worms from the part affected: but charms and amulets are most constantly used for many diseases incident to the common people.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>GOVERNMENT, LAWS, RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The isles of Orkney and Shetland compose one stewartry, and send one member to the British parlia∣ment. The right of superiority to the Orkneys was dismembered from the crown by the union parlia∣ment, and granted for a certain yearly consideration to the earl of Moreton, by queen Anne, who ap∣pointed him hereditary steward and justiciary. This nobleman possesses the power of creating certain
<PB N="418" REF="4360"/>
judges called bailiffs. There is one of these esta∣blished in every island and parish, with power to su∣perintend the manners of the inhabitants, to hold courts and determine civil causes, according to the laws of Scotland, to the value of ten pounds Scotch money, amounting to sixteen shillings and eight-pence: but all contests of higher import are referred to the decision of the steward or his depu∣ty, who resides at Kirkwall, which is the seat of justice. Subservient to the bailiffs are six or seven of the most reputable and intelligent inhabitants, who oversee the conduct of their fellows, acting as constables, and make report of all enormi∣ties to the bailiff, who causes the delinquent to be apprehended and punished, if the crime be within the extent of his judicial power; other∣wise he transmits him to Kirkwall, where he is tried by the steward. These inferior civil officers are known by the name of law-right-men, and enjoy a very extraordinary privilege. When any theft is committed, and any particular per∣son lies under suspicion of the crime, these men, accompanied by some of their neighbours, have power to make a <HI>ransalling</HI> or search of the sus∣pected house, for what has been stolen; and if the thief be detected, they bring him to justice without further warrant or ceremony. The pro∣testant religion prevails in the isles of Orkney, according to the rites and discipline of the kirk, these, and the isles of Shetland, constituting one presbytery, which assembles at Kirkwall. The country is divided into eighteen parishes, con∣taining thirty-one churches, and above one hun∣dred chapels.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="419" REF="4370"/>
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The trade of the Orkneys is not at present very considerable, though it might be extended to great advantage. They supply with fresh provisions, for ready money, the ships and vessels that touch up∣on the coast, in the course of northern voyages, or in their passage from the East-Indies, when they go north about Ireland and Scotland, in time of war, to avoid the privateers of the enemy. They are also visited by those engaged in the herring fishery, tho' there is not such a resort on this account to these islands, as to the isles of Shetland. Nevertheless, a good number of boats from the western parts of Scotland, as well as from Londonderry, Belfast, and other ports of Ireland, fish for herring as far north as the Leuze, and supply the Orkneys with tobacco, wine, brandy, and other spirituous li∣quors, cloths, and divers manufactures. These they exchange for fish and oil extracted from por∣poises, seals, and other sea animals. The people of Orkney export annually great numbers of black cattle, swine, and sheep; together with large quan∣tities of corn, butter, tallow, salt, and stuffs made in the country, over and above the skins of seals, otters, lambs, and rabbits, down, feathers, writ∣ing quills, hams, and wool: yet all these articles would, in point of profit, fall infinitely short of their herring-fishery, were it prosecuted with industry, oeconomy, and vigour. As there are no merchants in the Orkneys at present, who export fish on their own account, what herrings are taken they sell to the Dutch or Scotch dealers in and about Inverness. They generally fish for herring on the west side of the Orkneys, and are therefore more remote from markets, than those who are employ∣ed in the same manner on the coast of Shetland.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="420" REF="4380"/>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>We may reckon among the curiosities of the Orkneys, the <HI>Phaseoli,</HI> commonly known by the name of Molucca beans, which are thrown upon the shore after storms of westerly wind, and are supposed to be driven thus far north from the West-Indies, where they grow. Many strange fishes and curious shells are also frequently cast up by the ocean; of these last a vast variety for adorning the cabinets of modern naturalists. Some∣times exotic fowls are driven upon the Orkneys by tempestuous weather: fish, as large as whitings, have been thrown ashore to a considerable distance within the land. At Cantick-head, in the island Waes, and some other places, huge stones are often heaved up by the violence of the sea and wind, and cast over high rocks upon the land. A single Laplander has been seen more than once on this coast, in his slender canoe, covered with skins, being driven hither by adverse winds and storms. In the parish of Harn, in the main land, a large piece of a stag's horn was found very deep in the earth where the natives were digging for marle. In the parish of Evie, near the sea-coast, are divers small hillocks that sometimes appear as if covered with flame in the night: the same phaenomenon is observable in the parish church called St. Nicho∣las, and is probably nothing else but some bitu∣minous exhalation. At the noup-head in Westra there is a rock, called Liss, surrounded by the sea, supposed to be endued with a very surprising pro∣perty. The islanders believe that if a man, having a piece of iron about him, should land on this rock, the sea would instantly swell and foam with incre∣dible fury, which would not abate until the iron should be thrown away. This, however, is no more than a tale of idle superstition. The Orkneys are
<PB N="421" REF="4390"/>
not altogether destitute of antient monuments and curiosities of art. In Hoy we find an entire stone, thirty-six feet long, eighteen in breadth, and nine in thickness, lying between two hills, and known by the name of dwarfic stone. It is hollowed with∣in by the tools of a mason, the marks of which are still apparent. The entrance is a square hole about two feet high, with a stone, by way of door, standing before it. Within we find a bed with a pillow cut out of the stone; at the other end is a couch of the same kind; and in the middle a hearth, above which there is a hole or vent for the exit of the smoke. This curiosity is found in the midst of a desolate heath, and is supposed to have been the residence of a hermit: in the very neighbourhood of this stone there is a very high and steep mountain, called the <HI>wart hill of Hoy,</HI> near the summit of which, in the months of May, June, and July, something at noon-day is seen to shine and sparkle with remarkable lustre, suppos∣ed by the common people to be an inchanted car∣buncle, many persons have clambered up the hill in quest of it, but found nothing. Perhaps this splendour is produced by the reflexion of the sun on a small stream of water sliding over the face of a smooth rock. At Stennis, in the main land, there is a causeway of stones over a loch or lake, at the south end of which we observe a circle of stones, rising about twenty feet above ground, each being six feet in breadth, and from one to two feet in thickness: between this circle and the causeway two stones of the same dimensions stand by themselves, and one of them is perforated in the middle. At the distance of half a mile from the other end of the causeway appears a larger circle of the same kind of stones, the diametet of which may amount to one hundred and ten paces; some of these stones are fallen; and to the east and
<PB N="422" REF="4400"/>
west of the larger circle are two artificial green mounts. Both rounds are surrounded with a ditch; and one cannot view them without admiration, considering the art that must have been used to bring such unwieldy masses together in this order. They were probably temples and places of sacri∣fice used in times of pagan superstition; and seem to bear a great affinity with the celebrated monu∣ment, called Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain in Eng∣land. In one of the mounts, at the north end of the causeway, the natives found nine <HI>Fibulae,</HI> or clasps of silver, formed into a circle, and resembling a horse-shoe. In many different places of the Ork∣neys we find rude obelisks or single stones of a great height, set up either as memorials of battles, trea∣ties, or the decease of remarkable personages. In Rousay, between two high mountains, there is a place which the natives distinguish by the appel∣lation of the camp of <HI>Jupiter Fring:</HI> but the mean∣ing of this name, handed down by tradition, is not known. At the west end of the main land, near Skeal, we find a surprising causeway, above a quar∣ter of a mile in length, on the summit of high hills, composed of reddish stones of different mag∣nitude, impressed with various figures, both on the upper and under surface. Some gentlemen in the neighbourhood have carried off the most beau∣tiful of these stones, to be set in their chimnies by way of ornament, like the painted tiles of Hol∣land. This country produces many sepulchres of different nations. In the plains or links of Skeal, the sand being blown away from the sur∣face of the ground, several square catacombs ap∣pear built of stones well cemented together, con∣taining some parcels of black earth, and each se∣cured by a large stone at the mouth. Sepulchres of the same kind are found at Rousum in Strou∣sa, which is likewise remarkable for a different
<PB N="423" REF="4410"/>
kind of monument, consisting of one intire stone cylinder hollowed, with a bottom like that of a barrel, and a round stone to fill up the entrance: above the stone was sharpened into an edge; with∣in were found some burned bones and red clay; and over it was placed a large flat stone for the preservation of the whole. These, in all probabi∣lity, were Roman caracombs. In Westra divers Danish graves have been discovered: in one of these appeared the skeleton of a man, with a sword on one side, and a Danish ax on the other. Some have been found buried with dogs, combs, knives, and other utensils. In many places of the coun∣try we find round hillocks or barrows, here known by the name of Brogh, signifying, in the Teuto∣nic language, burying place, supposed to have been the cimeteries of the antient Saxons. In different parts of these islands we see the remains of great buildings, believed to have been fortresses erected by the Danes or Norwegians when they possessed the country. One of these in the isle of Wyre, called the castle of Coppi-row, signifying a town of security, is surrounded by a fosse, and the first floor still remains above ground, a perfect square of stone wall very thick, strongly built, and cemented with lime, the area within not exceeding ten feet in length. Of this Coppi-row the com∣mon people relate many idle fables. In the cha∣pel of Clet, in the isle of Sanda, there is a grave nineteen feet long, in which was found part of a man's back bone, larger than that of a horse. Hu∣man bones, of nearly the same size, have been dug up in Westra; and indeed this country is remark∣able for producing men of a gigantic stature. With∣in the antient fabrick of Lady Kirk in South Ro∣nalshaw, there is a stone four feet long, and two feet broad, on which the print of two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet are en∣graven,
<PB N="424" REF="4420"/>
supposed to be the place where, in times of popery, penitents stood to do public penance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION of the PARTICULAR ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Orkneys are commonly divided into south and north islands, according to their situation. The most southern, called South Ronalshaw, ex∣tending six miles in length and five in breadth, is fine land, fruitful in corn, pasture, and cat∣tle; indented with divers bays, and blessed with two good harbours. There are two churches at different ends of the island; one of these is Lady Kirk, an old ruinous building, for which the na∣tives entertain the most superstitious veneration. From Burray, at the south point of Ronalshaw, there is a ferry to Duncan's bay in Caithness on the coast of Scotland. This island is separated by a narrow channel on the east from Flatta, and the isle of Waes lies to the westward.</P>
<P>A little farther to the south rises the isle of Swen∣na or Sound, remarkable for the wells or whirl∣pools which we have described above. Though the length of it does not exceed two miles, and the breadth half as much, it produces good crops of corn; is inhabited by husbandmen chiefly; yields a good quarry of slates; and plenty of fish are caught along the coast. Pentland, or Pightland Skerries, is a small island surrounded by dangerous rocks abounding with seals and wild fowl. The most romantic of all these islands is Hoy, the east∣ern part of which is distinguished by the name of Waes. It extends about twelve miles in length, and in breadth six, where broadest. The Waes is fertile and populous; but the rest mountainous, and thinly inhabited. Adjoining to this island, on the west, by a very narrow isthmus, is a rock
<PB N="425" REF="4430"/>
called Bradbrugh, that forms a strong, natural for∣tress. Hoy is provided with some good harbours, though they are very little frequented; and it like∣wise affords a ferry from Snell-setter to Ham in Caithness. The country is watered by several lakes and streams that abound with trout. From the tops of the monntains in Hoy the reflexion of the sun is seen all night at the summer solstice. These mountains abound with wild sheep, and hares as white as snow. Here are deep vallies, dark and narrow, overhung with impending rocks that half exclude the day, and strike the eye of a traveller with awe and terror. The minister of Hoy, besides his own church, officiates in another, situated on the small, but pleasant isle of Gram∣sey, to the northward of Hoy. He that belongs to the kirk of Waes, has likewise another in the little island of Flotta; and his charge likewise in∣cludes the two small islands of Faira and Cava, that lie to the eastward of Waes. Flotta lying to the westward of Hoy is about five miles long, two and a half in breadth where broadest, and almost surrounded with high rocks. It abounds with game and fish of all sorts, is provided with one church, but produces little corn, and is thinly inhabited. Burra, nearly of the same size, is a plea∣sant island, affording plenty of corn, pasturage, horses, black cattle, sheep, rabbits, together with excellent turf and peat for fewel.</P>
<P>Pomona, as being the largest of the Orkney islands, is distinguished by the epithet of the main land. The length of it amounts to twenty-four miles, and the breadth to nine in some places. It contains nine parish churches; has four excellent harbours, namely, Kirkwall, Deer Sound, Gra∣hamshall, and Kaerston. It is well watered by di∣vers lakes and rivulets abounding with trout and salmon; the country produces several mines of
<PB N="426" REF="4440"/>
black lead; is generally fruitful and populous; and the coast is distinguished by divers bays and promontories. The eastern part, called Deerness, is a peninsula joined to the main land by a very narrow isthmus, supposed to have been formerly a forest for deer, whence it derived its name. This district is pleasant and populous, provided with a church, and adorned with the seats of several gen∣tlemen. The capital of this island, and indeed the only remarkable town belonging to the Orkneys, is Kirkwall, built upon an inlet of the sea, near the middle of the island, having a very safe road and harbour for shipping. This is a royal borough, go∣verned by a provost, four bailiffs, and a common∣council. It was formerly possessed by the Nor∣wegians, who bestowed upon it the name of Cru∣coviaca, and established the corporation about the latter end of the fifteenth century. From king James III. of Scotland they obtained a new char∣ter, confirming their antient privileges, impow∣ering them to elect their own magistrates yearly, to hold borough courts, arrest, imprison, make laws and ordinances for the right government of the town; to have a weekly market and three fairs annually at certain fixed terms: he moreover granted to them some lands adjoining to the town, with the customs and shore dues, the power of a pit and gallows, and exempted them from the ex∣pence of sending commissioners to parliament. This charter has been confirmed by succeeding monarchs. At present Kirkwall is the seat of jus∣tice, where the steward, sheriff, and commissary hold their several courts of jurisdiction: here is likewise a public grammar-school, endowed with a competent salary for the master. The town con∣sists of one narrow street about a mile in length. The houses are chiefly covered with slate, though not at all remarkable for neatness or convenience.
<PB N="427" REF="4450"/>
The principal edifices are the cathedral church, and the bishop's palace. The former called St. Magnus, from Magnus king of Norway, the sup∣posed founder of the town, is a large, gothic structure. The roof is supported by fourteen pil∣lars on each side, and the spire is built upon four large columns. The gates are decorated with a kind of mosaic work, of red and white stones ele∣gantly carved and flowered. By the ruins of the king's castle, or citadel, it appears to have been a strong and stately fortress. At the north end of the town there is a sort of a fortification built by the English in the time of Oliver Cromwell. It is surrounded with a ditch and rampart, and still mounted with some cannon for the defence of the harbour. In the west end of this island still ap∣pear the ruins of the king's palace, built by Ro∣bert Stuart, earl of Orkney, about the year 1574. The edifice seems to have been two stories high; and several apartments were curiously painted with incidents taken from the scripture.</P>
<P>At the north-west corner of Pomona is the small isle Alhallow, noted for a good fishery. To the east lies Copinsha, small, but fruitful, with its holm called the Horse of Copinsha. On the north side of Pomona are situated the northern isles Sha∣pensha, Strousa, Papa-Strousa, Sanna, North Ro∣nalsa, Eda, Damsey, Rousay, Eglisha, Westra, Papa-Westra, Wegre, Ouskerrie, and Fair Island. Shapensha, lying over-against Kirkwall, stretching six miles in length and three in breadth, has the advantage of a safe harbour at Elwick, is provid∣ed with a church, and abounds with turf and wild fowl. Strousa, lying to the south-east, of nearly the same size, has two convenient harbours. One of these, at Lengasound, is formed by a holm: the other, at Strynic, is secured by the little island Papa-Strousa, pleasant, populous, and fertile. To
<PB N="428" REF="4460"/>
the northward of these lies Sanda, a narrow island extending twelve miles in length, abounding with corn and rabbits, and counted the most beautiful as well as the most fruitful of all the Orcades. It has the advantage of two roads for shipping; one at Kettletoft, fenced by the little holm called El∣ness; the other at Otterswick, guarced by the lit∣tle fruitful island of North Ronalsa, the most north∣ern of all the Orkneys. Sanda produces black cattle, sheep, rabbits, and fish in abundance. There is likewise plenty of corn, hay, and pasture: but the poor people have no other fuel but the dung of cattle dried, straw, and the wrecks of vessels, which are often cast away on the northern side of this island, which is very low, and consequently dangerous to mariners.</P>
<P>To the south-east of Sanda we find the isle of Eda, ten miles long, and near five in breadth, co∣vered with hills and morasses, thinly inhabited, but abounding with game. On the north side there is a safe road, called Calf sound, defended by a large holm, on which there is a salt pan. Near the harbour is a high promontory, famous for a breed of excellent hawks. Damsey is a small island at the bottom of a large bay, to the west-ward of Kirkwall, having on one side a holm as big as itself. Rousa to the north-west, stretching eight miles in length and six in breadth, abounds with hills covered with heath; and is well stored with rabbits, plover, and moor game; but is thinly inhabited, except upon the coast, where the soil produces good corn. Eglesha is a small fertile island about three miles long, having the advan∣tage of a commodious road for shipping. Here is a neat little church with a high steeple, supposed by some persons to be the place where St. Mag∣nus, patron of the Orkneys, lies buried. Westra, to the northward of Eglesha, is a fruitful and po∣pulous
<PB N="429" REF="4470"/>
island seven miles long, with a convenient harbour defended by a strong castle. A little far∣ther to the northward lies Papa-Westra, about three miles in length, agreeable and fertile, and abound∣ing with corn and rabbits. The inhabitants of this island are remarkable for courage, longevity, and gigantic stature. Martin mentions one William Muir, of Papa-Westra, who had arrived at the age of one hundred and forty. Here, as we have ob∣served above, many Danish graves have been dis∣covered. Weyre is a very small island, which, nevertheless, produces good corn, and is remark∣able for the ruins of a considerable fort, supposed to have been built by the Picts or Danes. Ous∣kerrie is a small rocky island to the north-east of Strousa, where abundance of fish is caught.</P>
<P>Midway, between Orkney and Shetland, rises the fair island in three high promontories, envi∣roned with rocks, and inaccessible, except on the north-east, where the land flattens, and forms a convenient harbour. This island produces good corn and cattle, and the coast abounds with a va∣riety of excellent fish; the hawks that breed here are counted excellent; and the country is well situated for trade: nevertheless it is but thinly inhabited, because the inhabitants are apt to be plundered by foreign mariners and fishermen. It obtained the name of Fair Island from its lying in the fair way, that is, in the direct channel between the Orkneys and Shetland. In time of war the Dutch convoys commonly cruise in the neighbour∣hood of this island, to wait for their ships from East-India that come north about.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Their SITUATION, NUMBER, CLIMATE, SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>THESE islands, called <HI>Hebrides</HI> and <HI>Aebudae</HI> by the antients, lie scattered in the Deuca∣ledonian sea, to the north-west of Scotland, of which kingdom they constitute a part, and are si∣tuated between the 55th and 59th degrees of lati∣tude, being supposed to exceed three hundred in number, and to contain about forty-eight thou∣sand inhabitants. Considering their northern situa∣tion, surrounded with the sea, and encumbered with high mountains that interrupt the course of the clouds, and exhalations from the Atlantic, the air must be cold and moist in the greater part of these islands. The length of the days must vary in different isles, according to the difference of their site. In the most northerly isles the sun, at the summer solstice, is not above an hour under the ho∣rizon at midnight, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not longer above it at mid∣day in the depth of winter. The soil of the He∣brides varies also in different isles, and in different parts of the same island: some are mountainous and barren, producing little else than heath, wild myrtle, fern, and a little grass; while others, be∣ing cultivated and manured with sea-weed, yield plentiful crops of oats and barley.</P>

<P>With respect to vegetables, over and above the plentiful harvests of corn that the natives earn from agriculture, and the potherbs and roots that are planted in gardens for the sustenance of the people, these islands produce spontaneously a va∣riety of plants and simples, some of which we shall particularize in enumerating the medicines used by the islanders in the cure of their diseases; but there is hardly a shrub or tree to be seen, except in a very few spots, where some gentlemen have endeavoured to rear them with much more trou∣ble than success.</P>

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their MANNERS and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>The people inhabiting these islands are of the same race with those who live in the Highlands of Scotland; speak the same language, wear the same habit, and observe the same customs; with this difference, that they are more simple, indus∣trious, and sincere, than their neighbours of the main land. They are, in general, strong, vigo∣rous, and healthy, their constitutions being steeled with labour, and preserved by temperance. Happy
<PB N="432" REF="4500"/>
in their ignorance of luxury and ambition, they live without pride, avarice, and almost without contention, enjoying the hard-earned necessaries of life with a surprizing serenity of temper; adher∣ing to the duties of nature, undebauched; blessed with good natural capacities, faithful, mild, humane, and remarkably hospitable to strangers, whom they cultivate even with a religious veneration. Perhaps these people might be justly deemed the happiest of mortals, were not their felicity invaded by the horrors of superstition, to which they are miserably subject, such as signs, tokens, charms, omens, dreams, and a pseudophrotic spirit, which they distinguish by the appellation of the second sight. Some of their particular customs will be mentioned and explained in the course of de∣scribing the different islands. Their habit, like that of the other Highlanders of Scotland, consists of a short coat made of plaid, which they call tar∣tan, and, by way of a cloak or upper covering, a piece of loose drapery of the same stuff, twelve yards in width, worn over the shoulder like the Roman toga, and fastened round the middle with a leather belt, in such a manner that part of the plaid hangs down before and behind, like a petticoat, supplying the want of breeches. This way of wearing the plaid is called the kilt; but sometimes, in lieu of the kilt, they wear a kind of petticoat of the same variegated stuff, buckled round the waist, and this they denomi∣nate the philebeg. Instead of knit stockings, they wear tartan hose, tied under the knee with garters, finely striped and curiously knotted in a bunch, or tossel, by way of ornament: their feet are cased in brogues of ill-dressed leather, and their heads are covered with flat blue caps, which they call bonnets. The dress of the women consists of a petticoat and jerkin, with strait sleeves, sometimes of scarlet

trimmed with gold lace, and buttoned at the wrist; of a plaid by way of upper garment, fastened on the breast with a buckle of silver or brass, some∣times as large as an ordinary trencher, curiously chased or embossed, and containing a lesser buckle in the center, set with chrystal or other precious stones. This plaid is tied round the waist by a leathern belt, adorned with plates of silver, and ending in a long piece of the same metal, adorned with precious stones, or red coral. The head is covered with a kerchief of fine linnen, tied flat over the forehead, with the ends hanging down the neck behind: a ringlet of hair flows down the cheek as far as the bosom, and the lower end is ornamented with a knot of ribbons. This dress, however, is now laid aside by persons of any rank or fashion, in favour of that which is worn in the more civilized parts of Great-Britain. Before the late rebellion, scarce a Highlander was to be seen without a curious iron pistol slung in his belt, a broad sword under his arm, and a large leathern purse, decorated with silver, hanging before him: but the British parliament hath thought proper to forbid this peculiarity of dress, which was supposed to keep up odious and dangerous distinctions among his Majesty's subjects, and maintain a mar∣tial spirit, to the prejudice of the public peace. Several regiments, however, composed of this people, still retain the antient garb, which is not only agreeable to the eye, but admirably adapted for the use of a soldier. The feet, legs, and thighs, are kept cool, by a constant undulation of air, in marching, as well as strengthened and steeled, by being exposed to the weather; the joints are un∣fettered and unincumbered by unnecessary dra∣pery; and the plaid serves occasionally to screen his military arms from the rain, and himself from all the inclemencies of the air. An Highlander,
<PB N="434" REF="4530"/>
provided with a plaid, sets night and cold and storms at defiance. Wherever darkness overtakes him, whether in wood or heath, or hut or den, he lays him down, securely wrapped in his plaid, and sleeps as sound as if he were in a palace: nay, in the common course of travelling, he will not take the trouble to go half a mile out of his way, tho', by so doing, he is certain of finding a good bed and warm lodging. These people, being ac∣customed to the use of arms from their infancy, are bold, resolute, and intrepid; and though na∣turally lazy, yet when their occasions require ex∣ertion, remarkably active, and patient of hunger and fatigue. This martial turn, joined to a cho∣leric disposition, hot, fiery, and vindictive, has produced abundance of mischief among families, and indeed between whole clans, or tribes, exciting mortal feuds, and even intestine war: but, in pro∣portion as they have been civilized, this barbarous spirit hath subsided; and no family quarrels of any consequence now remain, except in the songs of their bards, whom they distinguish by the name of <HI>shanachies.</HI> Every laird, or chief, entertains one or more of these shanachies, who, in old bal∣lads, or extempore rhimes, recites the exploits of his patron's ancestors, in which he never fails to mingle extravagant flattery and fiction. Another constant menial of the houshold is the musician, or bag-piper, whose business and privilege it is to wake the laird and his family in the morning with the sound of his instrument; to play for a certain length of time in the great hall, with a silken flag, or broad ribbon, affixed to his chanter-pipe; to walk in procession before his master to church, sounding the march, or pi∣broch, of the family; to entertain him and his guests at all festal meetings; in time of war, to march at the head of the clan, and animate them
<PB N="435" REF="4540"/>
to battle with martial tunes, composed for that purpose. Such is the power and influence of this simple minstrelsy over these people, that the piper, by varying his airs, can melt them into sorrow and despondence, and again rouse them to rage and revenge, and a total contempt of danger and of death. Nay, in the greatest emergency of war, they will not march a furlong, nor draw a sword, without being cheared by the musick of this instrument. Many customs of the antient Highlanders are now laid aside. Every young chieftain, when he assumed the reins of go∣vernment, was placed on a heap of stones, sur∣rounded by his adherents, and by one of his prin∣cipal friends, invested with the sword of his father, and a white rod, in token of sovereignty: there he was harangued by the shanachie, or orator, who expatiated upon the valour and virtues of his an∣cestors; but the young chieftain was never raised to this eminence, until he had made an incursion into the lands of some other clan, with which he was at variance, and exhibited undoubted proofs of valour and conduct: upon such a military expe∣dition, it was customary to kill the first animal that chanced to meet them on the enemy's ground, and sprinkle its blood on their colours as an omen of success. Some of those lairds have hereditary offices established in their families; such as standard-bearer and quarter-master; and this last enjoys, as a perquisite, the hides of all the cattle which are taken and killed in their military expe∣ditions. Every house or castle of a chief was furnished with a centinel, called cockman, who stood all night in a watch-tower, and challenged every person that approached. The chief was al∣ways attended, in his expeditions, with a kind of life-guard, composed of young gentlemen, who were trained up in the exercise of the sword and
<PB N="436" REF="4550"/>
target, and taught to wrestle, shoot with bow and arrow, leap, dance, climb, swim, and navigate their vessels. His armour-bearer, called gallo∣glach, was always at his side, by night and by day, to prevent surprize, and him he gratified with a double portion of meat at every meal: among the officers that were hereditary, we may likewise reckon the cup-bearer, the purse-bearer, and two stewards, or merchants, the superior of whom, be∣ing skilled in the pedigrees of all the Highland chieftains, adjusted the ceremony, with respect to precedency at the table, by means of a white wand, with which he marshalled the guests in silence. These, and a great many other peculiar customs, are now laid aside; but an incredible number of superstitious rites are still retained by the vulgar. The surprizing attachment of the clans to their re∣spective chieftains was not only founded upon the nature of their tenures, by which, in effect, they were bound servants to their lords; but likewise flowed from inclination, inculcated from father to son, and cherished from their tender years by ex∣hortation and example. The Highlanders are ad∣dicted to excessive drinking, a practice which they indulge to a great degree of emulation, as a proof of their hospitality and prowess. The gen∣tlemen regale themselves with French wines, or brandy, which are smuggled in great quantities on this coast; and those who cannot afford to pur∣chase these imports, content themselves with a corn-spirit, distilled in their own country, under the name of whisky, which, though strong and fiery, they are enabled, by long use and habit, to swallow in great doses, without any prejudice to their health. Many customs prevail in the islands, which are now forgot in the neighbouring conti∣nent. If a cow drops two calves, or a sheep brings forth two lambs at a birth, one of each is the pro∣perty
<PB N="437" REF="4560"/>
of the tenant's master; and if any tenant's wife bears twins, one of them is brought up at the laird's expence. Martin tells us, that he knew sixteen of these twins, at one time, in a gentle∣man's family; an argument of the prolific consti∣tutions of these people. Leagues of friendship between individuals were antiently cemented with the blood of both parties, a drop of which, drawn from the little finger, they mutually swallowed. This confirmation was held so sacred, that neither could violate the alliance, without exposing himself to contempt and infamy. When a tenant dies, the lord has his choice of all the horses belonging to the farm: this prerogative is called <HI>eachfuin ho∣rozeilda,</HI> or a lord's gift. No woman was formerly instructed in the art of writing, lest she should en∣gage in a literary correspondence that might be dangerous to her virtue and reputation. After the extinction of the Druids, who are supposed to have had groves and recesses of old in some of these islands, the orators and bards succeeded to their influence. They sat among the nobles and chieftains in the streah, or circle, at public assem∣blies; their houses were sanctuaries; and they pronounced occasional harangues at all meetings, whether formal or festal. At all weddings, where the poet, bard, or orator, spoke the epithalamium, he was intitled to the bridegroom's upper garb, namely, the plaid and bonnet: nay, if he de∣manded the habit, arms, or horse of any chief∣tain, his request was immediately granted, while these literati maintained their original dignity. At present, however, they are much degenerated in point of estimation, insomuch that a bard is al∣most as much despised in the Highlands of Scot∣land, as he is neglected in the metropolis of Great-Britain. The Highlanders hold their chiefs in such veneration, that they conclude the grace after
<PB N="438" REF="4570"/>
every meal with a prayer for the laird's welfare and prosperity: they even swear by his hand: they chearfully devote themselves to death for his safety; and, should he decline into the vale of misfortunes, they think it their duty to support him and his family by voluntary contribution. The Highlanders are very expert in managing the broad-sword and target, an exercise to which they are trained from their youth; and these were the arms they wielded in battle, together with a short dirk, or dagger, until they were re-inforced with muskets and pistols, the use of which they now perfectly understand. Their method of fighting is to ad∣vance within gun-shot of the enemy, pour in a vol∣ley of small-arms, then throw down their pieces, draw their broad-swords, and attack with incredi∣ble impetuosity, in a wedge, or column, which they naturally form with surprizing dexterity. When they happen to be so hampered, that they have not room to use the broad-sword, they un∣sheath their dirks, and, mingling with the adver∣sary, make terrible havock. Such were the me∣thods practised by the Highlanders, before they were formed into regular regiments for the service of the public. At present these regiments retain their old dress, and the broad-sword; but in other respects they conform to the exercise and discipline of the other troops in the British army, and always behave with remarkable sobriety, order, and intre∣pidity.</P>
<P>The better sort of the Highlanders live like their neighbours; but the common people are wretch∣edly lodged, in paultry cottages or cabins, built of loose stones and mud, and thatched with straw; their partitions are no other than a kind of hurdle, plastered with clay; they have neither glass in their windows, nor any other chimney than a hole in the middle of the roof, through which the smoke finds its way: immediately under this aperture,
<PB N="439" REF="4580"/>
there is a hearth made of stone, upon which they burn wood, peat, or turf, the smoke of which fills the whole house in such a manner, that a stranger, unaccustomed to the annoyance, would be in dan∣ger of suffocation. Around the hearth, in cold weather, the family sit or lie, and work or sleep, as the occasion requires: at the farther end of the same house, the cattle are stalled; and it is not at all uncommon to see the calves, the pigs, and the children, lying together promiscuously. These people are utter strangers to cleanliness; they are extremely sluttish in their houses, and nasty in their persons; and this impurity is, in all likeli∣hood, one great cause of that inveterate itch, with which they are so generally infested.</P>
<P>The men are excessively fond of tobacco, which they use in all the different ways, of chewing, smoking, and snuff. Their food consists chiefly of oatmeal, cheese, butter, milk, and whey; though they likewise eat flesh meat, namely, beef, mutton, goat, kid, and venison, and that much oftener than their neighbours of the Lowlands, because they have greater plenty of cattle and sheep, and can maintain them at a very small ex∣pence. Their favourite dish, called brochan, is no other than a piece of fresh meat boiled in water∣gruel.</P>
<P>With respect to the diversions of this country, both sexes are much addicted to dancing, and ge∣nerally very expert and agile at this exercise, which they perform with great vivacity to brisk tunes, plaid in very quick time, according to the genius and activity of the people. The men amuse them∣selves also in running, leaping, wrestling, throw∣ing huge stones, fencing, shooting, hunting, and fishing, by which means they acquire dexterity, strength, and a remarkable degree of elasticity in all their members.</P>

<PB N="440" REF="4590"/>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE, GOVERNMENT, LAWS, and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The language used in the Highlands of Scot∣land, and Western Isles, is called Erse, a dialect of the Irish, and is supposed to be derived from the an∣tient Celtic. It abounds with gutturals and nasals; is pronounced with a remarkable twang, or ca∣dence, and, though not very grateful to the ear, is said to be expressive, lofty, and well adapted to poetry. Certain it is, the people have a natural turn to versifying, and their rhimes have a won∣derful effect on the hearers. The government of these people formerly depended on the will of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who exercised a sovereign jurisdiction over them, delegating their power to inferior offi∣cers: but these jurisdictions are now abolished by an act of the British Parliament: the people are ruled, like their fellow-subjects, by regular justices and magistrates, and delinquents are tried and judged in the ordinary course of justice, by the established laws of the community.</P>
<P>The presbyterian discipline and form of church government prevails through all the Highlands, and Western Islands. The ministers of a certain district constitute a presbytery, which, at stat∣ed meetings, takes cognizance of all cases of scandal, and every thing relating to the kirk, within its own particular province. In matters of great consequence, appeals are made to the synod, which is held in different quarters of the kingdom, at particular seasons of the year; but the final re∣source, and regulation of the national church, lies with the general assembly, to which a certain num∣ber of lay-elders are admitted, and in which the king's commissioner presides in great state and magnificence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="441" REF="4600"/>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURE.</HEAD>
<P>The people of this country are generally re∣puted idle and lazy; but this laziness is probably owing to their want of employment, and the means of exercising their industry; for when they settle in other countries, they become remarkable for their diligence and oeconomy. The commodities which may be deemed the staples of this country, are black cattle, sheep, and fish, which they sell to their fellow-subjects of Scotland. Part of the wool they work up into knit stockings, coarse cloth, and that variegated stuff called tartan. They likewise salt mutton in the hide, and export it in boats, or barklings, to different parts of the main land. Cod, ling, mackarel, whiting, had∣dock, and soles, are here caught in abundance, together with a small red cod, remarkably vora∣cious, of a very delicate flavour: there are like∣wise two kinds of white fish, which seem to be peculiar to this coast, known by the names of lithe and cea, esteemed good eating: but the greatest treasure the ocean pours forth, is the prodigious quantity of herrings, which, at one season of the year, swarm in all the creeks and bays along the western shore of Scotland. These are counted the largest, fattest, and finest herrings, caught in any part of the Northern Seas. This fishery employs a great number of hands, and brings a considera∣ble advantage to the kingdom. The fish are caught, cured, barrelled up, and exported: but whether from want of skill, or a proper salt for pickling, the Scotch-cured herrings of this coast, though superior to all others in their natural state, are counted inferior to those which are dressed and pickled by the Dutch fishermen.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="4610"/>
How mean and contracted soever the commerce and produce of these islands may be at present, they are, perhaps, more capable of improvement, in both articles, than any part of the British domi∣nions in Europe. The inhabitants are so little skilled in husbandry, that the soil, though generally good in the low grounds, yields nothing but scanty crops of oats and barley; and great tracts of land lie altogether uncultivated. If a very small num∣ber of judicious farmers would settle in some of the most considerable islands, they would soon raise such harvests as would enrich themselves, employ and maintain all the idle people, a great number of whom are obliged to repair to foreign countries for subsistence, afford sufficient bread for the inhabitants, and even supply the barren parts of the opposite continent. The soil, in many places, would produce wheat, and almost every where would give good pasturage, insomuch that, with proper culture, the people might provide hay and fodder for their cattle, which, during the severity of the winter, die in great numbers for want of provision. Improvements of this kind would be the more easily made, as the sea-shore abounds with shells for lime, and sea-weed for ma∣nure; and the labourers would be easily subsisted by the fish that swarm, not only in the ocean which surrounds these islands, but likewise in the numerous lakes and rivers of fresh water. Martin declares, that he knew an hundred families in this country maintained by so many little farms, the rent of each not exceeding five shillings, one sheep, and a few pecks of oats. We repeat it, therefore, that a few judicious and substantial husbandmen might accumulate large fortunes, by taking long leases in some of the Western Isles, in order to improve the waste land by planting, inclosing, manuring, and draining. If any family, reduced to low cir∣cumstances,
<PB N="443" REF="4620"/>
can give up the follies and bustle of life, and enjoy itself in an agreeable retreat, let it retire to one of these sequestered islands, where, at a very inconsiderable expence, it may be furnished with the necessaries, and even comforts of life, amidst the most agreeably romantic scenes that dis∣pose the mind to philosophical tranquillity, in a pure, salubrious climate, and among a harmless people, remarkable for innocence of heart, and simplicity of manners.</P>
<P>With respect to the commerce of these islands, it might be extended so as to render them a staple of trade, and an excellent nursery for seamen. They are furnished with an infinite number of bays, creeks, and harbours, for the convenience of na∣vigation: the inhabitants are numerous, strong, active, and every way qualified for the life of a mariner. The sea affords myriads of fish for ex∣portation: the lands might afford plenty of pastur∣age for black cattle, horses, and sheep, as well as plenteous harvests of corn, and other grain: woollen and linnen manufactures might be prosecuted to great advantage, where labour is cheap and pro∣visions are reasonable. The islands afford good stone and lime, and some parts of the opposite main land, timber for building: they have plenty of fuel, not only for the ordinary purposes of life, but also for salt-pans, which might be erected on different parts of the coast; and for burning sea∣ware for the use of a glass, or soap manufacture. Finally, the situation of these islands is so com∣modious for trade, that the navigator is immedi∣ately in the open sea, and almost in the neighbour∣hood of Denmark, Sweden, Hamburgh, Holland; nay, with a favourable wind, he can reach the coasts of France and Spain in a week's sailing; if he is bound for the British plantations, or indeed for any part of the known globe, he is at once dis∣encumbered
<PB N="444" REF="4630"/>
of the land, and prosecutes his voyage through the open sea, without obstruction or dif∣ficulty.</P>
<P>After this general description of the Western Isles, it will be necessary to mention every consi∣derable island in particular. The most remote of all these islands is St. Kilda, which, being in all respects, a curiosity, we shall particularly describe.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF ST. KILDA.</HEAD>
<P>ST. Kilda, called by the inhabitants Hirt, is a so∣litary small island, about five miles in circumfe∣rence, rising out of the sea, in the fifty-eighth de∣gree of northern latitude, sixty miles due west from the middle of the Lewis, which is the ex∣tremest range of the Hebrides: but even sixty leagues to the westward of St. Kilda, the ocean exhibits the rock of Rokol, or Rokabarra. The little isle of Soa lies within half a mile of St. Kil∣da on the west side, that of Borrera two leagues to the northward, and the rock Levanus, Cackeluc, and Stacknarmin. The whole island of St. Kilda is one hard rock, divided into four high mountains, thinly covered with black mould, except on the tops, where the soil is three feet deep. The hills are clothed with short grass, which yields good pasturage to the horses, cattle, and sheep; and their vallies of arable land give large crops of ex∣cellent
<PB N="445" REF="4640"/>
barley. The whole island is naturally fen∣ced with perpendicular rocks, except at one bay to the south-east, about half a mile broad, where there is generally such a tumbling surf and raging sea, that no vessel can anchor here with any secu∣rity: the only landing-place is on the north side of this bay, extremely hazardous; for it is with great difficulty that a boat can be brought to the side of a slippery rock, on which he that lands must jump with uncommon exertion. There is, more∣over, a small bay on the west side of the island, in which some vessels take shelter when the wind is at south, or blows from the north-east: but the sea is generally so impetuous all round, that it frequently removes fragments of rocks and stones of a prodigious weight. On the whole, St. Kilda is one of the strongest natural fortresses in the known world, being inaccessible in every place but at that rock, which might be defended against any force by loose stones hurled from the impend∣ing mountain of Oterveaul. The island is well supplied with wells of excellent water, so light and pure, that the stomach used to it can hardly af∣terwards accommodate itself to the finest water of the other islands: on the west side there is a valley or bottom, through the middle of which a rivu∣let runs into the sea. On the external part of the isle, towards the south and north-west, there are some natural vaults or arches through which the sea passes. There is a violent current upon the coasts of St. Kilda and the lesser isles and rocks; and this is more impetuous with the spring tides than at any other time; and these are always at the full and new moon. No mineral ores have as yet been discovered in St. Kilda; but pieces of chrystal, of an hexangular shape, are found in a bed of sand that lies under the rock at the landing∣place. In the bottom we have already mentioned,
<PB N="446" REF="4650"/>
there is a circular edifice built with stone without lime or mortar, rising in form of a cone to the top, which is open, and serves as a chimney. It is used as a summer-house by the inhabitants, who affirm, from tradition, that it is of great antiquity, and belonged to a famous warlike Amazon. There is a building of the same kind in one of the neigh∣bouring islands, and may perhaps have been tem∣ples dedicated to the god Terminus by the Ro∣man general Agricola, who, we know from histo∣ry, embarked on board a fleet, and visited the Western Isles of Scotland. Among the plants pro∣duced in St. Kilda, we reckon the common dock, the round, large, sweet scurvy-grass, millefoil, shepherd's purse, silver-weed, plantane, sage, chick∣weed, sorrel, allheal, the sea-pink, tormentil, and moss of different kinds and distinctions: but there is neither shrub nor tree on the whole island. The quadrupeds are horses, black cattle, sheep, goats, and dogs. Of land fowls there are hawks, eagles, plover, land-rails, cuckoos, wrens, and stone-chak∣ers. The sea-fowl, which are here innumerable, may be distinguished into these different species: the guerfowl, larger than a goose, of a black co∣lour, red about the eyes, with short wings, and a broad bill, lays a very large spotted egg, and hatches it on the bare rock; comes hither about the first of May, and departs about the middle of June. The Solan goose equals the common goose in size, and resembles it in shape and colour, with this difference, that the tips of the wings are black, and the top of the head yellow: the bill is long, strait, and crooked at the point; the legs are black and short, and the bird is web∣footed. It comes hither in March, builds its nest among the rocks with grass, lays its eggs, hatches its young, and, when they are fledged, retires in August or September. The Solan goose feeds up∣on
<PB N="447" REF="4660"/>
herring, mackarel, and other fish, and, going twenty leagues in quest of prey, will store its craw with herrings for its young, and, upon its return to its nest, the mate will pull them out as with a pincer. This bird, in order to build its nest, collects a great heap of grass, and any other stuff which it finds floating in the sea. The stew∣ard of St. Kilda told Martin, that in one nest he had found a red coat, a brass sun-dial, and an ar∣row; and a quantity of Molucca beans in another: nay, English hooks have been found sticking to the bones of fishes which they had devoured, al∣though these hooks are not used within twenty leagues of St. Kilda. It is remarkable that they never pull grass, except in windy weather, when they cannot employ themselves in fishing. When they go to roost at night, they sleep with their heads under their wings: but one of the number stands centinel, to prevent surprize. When this bird per∣ceives any noise at a distance, he calls softly <HI>grog, grog;</HI> but if he sees the fowler approaching, he cries aloud <HI>bir, bir,</HI> which the rest no sooner hear, than they take wing in a body: if the fowler can secure this centinel, he catches the rest, as they stand, without difficulty. These geese are likewise caught in gins made of horse-hair, and in lakes, by floating pieces of wood, on each of which a herring is fixed. The bird no sooner perceives the bait, than he darts upon it with such force, that he strikes his bill into the board, from whence he cannot disengage it, and thus fixed he is taken. The fulmar is in size equal to a mall of the second order, is a grey bird with a white breast, sharp claws, though web-footed, and a thick bill, about two inches long, and crooked at the end. It arrives in the beginning of winter, accompanied by hail, rain, snow, and storms at west. It lays in the be∣ginning of May one egg, which is larger than that
<PB N="448" REF="4670"/>
of the Solan goose, and the young are ready to fly by the latter end of July. It feeds upon dead and even living whales, and qualifies this food with sorrel, which is always found in its nest; and it disappears during the months of September and October. The young fulmar, when approached by the fowler, squirts from his bill a quantity of pure oil, which he can spout to the distance of seven paces. This oil, which is of a yellowish colour, is in high estimation among the inhabitants, who catch it in a wooden dish tied to the end of a pole, which they hold before the fulmar. When they surprize him behind, they tie up his bill with a thread until they reach home, where they have a vessel for receiving the oil, which flows out when his jaws are set at liberty. The flesh of the ful∣mar they prefer to all other dainties, and indeed it is of a delicate taste, finely marled with fat and lean intermixed: their young are remarkably fat: the oil is esteemed a catholicon for deep-seated pains and stitches, being rubbed on the part affect∣ed. Some persons in this island use it as a purge, and some take it as an emetic, but the operation is severe: certain it is, the oil is hot and penetrat∣ing. The scraber, puffin, or puffinet, is as large as a pigeon, of a black colour, with a white spot on each wing, and a small sharp bill, with a little curvature at the end. It comes in the month of March, digs a nest under ground, where it lays its eggs, fishes all day at sea, picking food from the whale, which, like the fulmar, it eats with sorrel, and having hatched and reared their young, which are very fat, they take wing and leave the island in August. The guillem, guillamot, or lavy, is not quite so large as a duck, with a brown neck and back, white breast, and strait sharp-pointed bill. Their eggs, which are spotted, the inhabi∣tants use as ordinary food, and prefer to all others.
<PB N="449" REF="4680"/>
They come with a south wind in February: but the time of their departure is uncertain. When this bird remains three days at land without in∣termission, the natives expect a southerly wind, and fair weather: but their going to sea within that space, is counted the infallible presage of a storm. The falk or razor bill is in size smaller than the lavy, of a black colour with a crooked bill, the upper mandible hanging over the lower. It lays a spotted egg in May, and is ready to depart with its young by the middle of July. The bow∣ger, coulterneb or pope, is a white bird of the size of a pidgeon, with a short, broad, triangular bill, red towards the point, which is curved, yel∣low feet and blue claws. These birds arrive with a south-west wind about the latter end of March, lay their eggs in holes underground, and hatch their young by the twentieth day of May. The assilag is a small bird, not larger than a linnet, with a black, crooked bill, and wide nostrils, comes about the end of March, lays its egg about the twentieth of May, produces its young, which is fledged by the middle of October, and departs to∣wards the end of November. Here are three sorts of sea-mews, of different colours and sizes. The sea-pye, which is not web-footed, consequently does not swim, arrives in May, and departs in August. All the sea-fowls, the solan geese excepted, are perceived to be fattest during the time of hatch∣ing. Before the main body of the solan geese ar∣rives they detach a few harbingers to reconnoitre the islands, and these having viewed them with great attention, fly away, as if on purpose to re∣port the observations they have made: in two or three days the whole tribe are seen hovering about the coast; but the inhabitants know not in what country the sea-fowls of passage spend the winter. The guer-fowl and the fulmar lay but one egg in
<PB N="450" REF="4690"/>
one year: the rest will lay three times, provided their first and second eggs be taken away.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of St. Kilda, amounting to about two hundred souls, are originally descended from the people of the Harries and adjacent isles: like these they speak the Erse language in great purity, and profess the Christian religion in all its primitive simplicity. They are provided with three chapels, in one of which there lies upon the altar a small brazen crucifix, which, though they do not worship it, they hold in great venera∣tion; but never touch it, except when they swear a solemn oath, or incur the matrimonial obliga∣tion. They observe the festivals of Christmas, Easter, Good-Friday, St. Columba, and All Saints. On this last they perform an anniversary cavalcade: the whole number of their horses does not exceed twenty: these they mount and ride by turns, using neither saddle nor bridle of any kind, ex∣cept a straw rope with which the beast is ma∣naged. The marriage ceremony is performed by the officer who presides over them, and is ex∣tremely simple. He convenes all the inhabitants of both sexes, and demands in public whether they know any lawful impediment that should prevent the match of the man and woman, who desire to be married. They answering in the negative, he asks the parties if they are contented to live to∣gether in weal and woe, as man and wife. When they signify their assent he declares them married, and the bride and bridegroom putting their hands upon the crucifix solemnly promise in the presence of Almighty God, to be true to one another. Af∣ter this ceremony the wedding is celebrated with music, dancing, and feasting. The officer also bap∣tises the children, on which occasion such a friend∣ship ensues between the parent and sponsor or god∣father, as no accident can dissolve. The natives
<PB N="451" REF="4700"/>
of this island, of both sexes, are remarkably fair and well featured: the men are delicately propor∣tioned, healthy, and reputed stronger than any other islanders belonging to the Hebrides. They marry very young, and their children are suckled two years. They use proper exercise, and are very temperate in diet; yet here are few instances of longevity. Their eye-sight is remarkably keen: their understanding is solid. They are sensible, honest, chaste, and hospitable; very circumspect in traffic, and united in interest: they are fond of poetry and music, though they have no other in∣strument than the jews-harp, and their voices are naturally clear, though they are said to improve them by swallowing the raw eggs of the solan goose. With respect to their manners they are a model of innocence and simplicity; and perhaps the happiness of the golden age was never so much realized as in St. Kilda. Unknown to envy and ambition, ignorant of luxury and vice, and remote from the contention, the turmoils and disappoint∣ments of life, they obtain the necessaries of na∣ture without money, of which they are wholly des∣titute: they enjoy health of body, peace of mind, and nothing is wanting to their felicity, but their knowing the misery and vexation to which their fellow creatures are exposed. They have no idea of any prince more powerful than their master the laird of Macleod, who being proprietor of the island, bestows the stewardship of it upon one of his friends or adherents. This superintendant vi∣sits the island every summer in order to collect the rents, which are paid in barley, fowls, and fea∣thers; and during the time of his residence upon it, which continues from the begining of sum∣mer until the solan geese are ready to fly, he and his retinue are maintained at the expence of the inhabitants by a daily allowance of mutton, sea∣fowl,
<PB N="452" REF="4710"/>
eggs, milk, butter, cheese, oatmeal, and barley. A native of St. Kilda being removed out of his own narrow world, is lost in a maze of as∣tonishment. One of them landing on the large isle of Harries, and asking who was proprietor of all these extensive lands: when he understood they belonged to Macleod, he lifted up his hands and eyes in amazement; but when he afterwards travelled to the isle of Sky, and was told this also belonged to the same person, he could not help exclaiming in a transport, <Q>“O mighty prince! who art master of such immense territories.”</Q> He was struck with wonder at the sight of looking∣glasses and pictures, which he imagined were the effect of enchantment: he admired the growth and beauty of trees, which he had never seen in his own country; and seeing the opposite main∣land of Inverness shire, enquired if that was the border of England.</P>
<P>In the year 1746, when some vessels repaired to St. Kilda in quest of the young pretender, the in∣habitants had heard nothing of him, or the pro∣gress he had made, and knew no further of the times, than that the laird of Macleod was at war with the French king. A native of St. Kilda, having been conveyed by water from Harries to Glasgow, was astonished at the length of the voyage; but when he entered that city seemed like one dropped from the clouds. The language of the people, their dress, and numbers, filled him with amazement. He could not imagine that the houses were made by the hands of men: when he saw a coach he gaped with admiration; but wondered most at the mechanism of the wheel, the motion of which he could not comprehend. The great church, which is a gothic cathedral, he supposed to be a natural rock, and observed that there were some still higher in St. Kilda, though
<PB N="453" REF="4720"/>
he never saw caves so regular and beautiful as those formed by the pillars and arches within. He believed that the ladies who wore masks had been guilty of some atrocious crime, in consequence of which they were ashamed to shew their faces. Patches he supposed to be spots remaining after blisters; silk dress in women he deemed indecent: he looked upon earings as of all things the most ridiculous; laughed at periwigs, and still more at powder. When the church bells rang he was seized with consternation, as if the whole fabric of the universe had been in disorder. In a word, he condemned, not without judgment, every su∣perfluity he saw, and passionately longed to re∣visit his own country. The people of St. Kilda are immediately under the direction of an officer or mayor, whom they themselves choose with the approbation of the steward. His business is to adjust the respective proportion of land among the inhabitants, according to the lease granted by the steward; to represent the grievances of the community, and plead in their behalf before Mac∣leod or his substitute; to preside in their councils, determine their disputes, maintain the impartiality of the lots by which they share their booty of eggs and wild-fowl, impose fines for faults, which the steward either exacts or forgives at his arrival, admi∣nister oaths on the crucifix, and perform the cere∣monies of marriage and baptism. By virtue of his office, he is obliged in point of honour to ex∣pose himself to the greatest danger in managing the boat, and climbing the rocks in quest of booty. As a compensation for his trouble, and the perqui∣sites of his office, the steward gratifies him with an extraordinary proportion of acres, with his own bonnet when he leaves the Island; on which occa∣sion the steward's wife compliments the officer's
<PB N="454" REF="4730"/>
consort with her own head-dress, and an ounce of indigo.</P>
<P>The inhabitants live together in a small village, situated in a bottom among hills, and composed of low wretched cottages, the thatch and roof be∣ing secured by straw-ropes, with stones hang∣ing at the end of them. The number of sheep on this and the neighbouring islands, may amount to two thousand: and their cows, which are very small, do not exceed one hundred. All the animals on the main land, including dogs, cats, and even wild-fowl, are spotted. Their arable land is divided into ten equal parts, and these again are subdivided, according to the number of fa∣milies. They manure the land with a compost of turf-ashes, mixed with straw and urine, and add to this the bones and intrails of the sea-fowl. They plough with a small crooked instrument; sow their barley very thick, and reap an harvest of twenty-fold. The sea-coast furnishes them with plenty of cod, ling, mackarel, turbot, herring, and all the other species of fish common to the sea; here are likewise otters and seals: but their chief dependance for food, and profit, is upon the sea∣fowl, which they catch in many different ways; but this employment subjects them to the most imminent dangers; for they are obliged to climb rocks, the very sight of which, to a stranger, fills him with horror. They have attained to such a wonderful dexterity in this exercise, that they will run along the face of a rock, where a goat would hardly find footing. A native of St. Kilda will turn his back to a mountain, almost perpendicular, and mount to the top upon his knees and elbows, to the terror and astonishment of the spectator, who has rever before seen this feat performed: but the most dangerous of all their exploits, is
<PB N="455" REF="4740"/>
that of climbing the Stack-donn, which rises like a steeple between the West point of St. Kilda, and the isle of Soar. Every part of it appears unsur∣mountable; but that which is called the Thumb, is so difficult, that the climber must poise himself upon his thumb for the space of a minute, during which he has no other hold with his hands or feet, and is obliged to raise up his body with a spring to the sharp point of a rock; which, when he can grasp, he climbs himself out of danger: by the help of a long rope tied round his middle, he then draws up his companions one after an∣other. He receives four fowls above his propor∣tion, as a recompence for his valour and activity; and is ever after honoured as one of the heroes of St. Kilda. Notwithstanding all their dexterity and address in climbing, they sometimes lose their lives by falling from the rocks; and then they are lamented in songs by their relations and neigh∣bours. One man in traversing the face of a rock was caught by the foot in a horse-hair g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, which had been placed for the destruction of the wild fowl, and hung with his head downwards over a steep precipice for several hours; until, at length, a person hearing his cries came to his relief, and drew him up by the legs. The natives are taught to climb from their childhood, and encouraged to emulation by the constant dis∣course of both sexes, who are still recounting the exploits of their ancestors, for the purpose of climbing. The community is possessed of three ropes, each twenty-four fathoms in length; these are covered with thongs of cow-hide salted, to preserve them from being cut by the rocks; and joined together occasionally, according to the height of the rock on which they are to be used. The commonwealth has but one boat about six∣teen cubits long, which serves them in all their
<PB N="456" REF="4750"/>
expeditions of fishing and fowling. It is divided into different spaces, proportioned to the division of the lands and rocks possessed by every individual, and in these spaces the respective owners stow their own booty. There was but one steel and tinder∣box in the whole community, until Martin taught them to strike fire with a piece of chrystal and the back of a knife. When a native of St. Kilda has caught a considerable number of fowls, he sits down on the summit of the rock, and plucking the fattest, brings them home to his wife or mis∣tress. A batchelor, in making his addresses to a female, is obliged to exhibit a specimen of his courage and agility; as a proof of his affection, he ascends the top of a perpendicular precipice, about forty fathoms high, and standing on the extremest verge on his left foot, half of which is over the rock, he brings his right heel to his left toe, and bending his body, joins his two fists to the point of his right foot. When the boat breaks from its fastenings, or is stove to pieces on the rocks, the men that chance to be on board or landed, are sometimes reduced to great distress. Twenty natives of St. Kilda, from an accident of this kind, were left several days on the rock Stack Warmin, and their lives were saved by the in∣genuity of one individual, who made fishing hooks <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the handles of their knives, by beating them on a stone, and working with the blade and handle of dagger. These occasional hooks they fastened to some sorry lines, and baiting them with limpets, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> fish sufficent for their maintenance. Nine of the St. Kilda men having made a voyage to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Borrera for a cargo of fowl and eggs, had the misfortune to lose their boar, and were confined <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this exile without a crust of bread, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of March, till the latter end of May. Their wives and countrymen supposed they had
<PB N="457" REF="4760"/>
all perished, and their fate was celebrated in songs and lamentations as a grievous national calamity. At length the nine exiles bethought themselves of an expedient to inform their friends of their being alive: they kindled nine distinct fires at night on the top of an eminence: these were no sooner perceived, and the number of lights counted by the inhabitants of St. Kilda, than they perceived the meaning of the auspicious signal, and their sorrow forthwith vanished. The wives of the ab∣sentees began to labour their grounds with the spade, and Providence blessed their industry with a very extraordinary harvest. Meanwhile their husbands subsisted on fish, fowl, and mutton, of which they had plenty in Borrera, until the steward arrived at St. Kilda; when being made acquainted with their fate, he sent his own boat to bring them home. Nothing could be more affecting than the mutual transports of joy which were ex∣pressed by those poor creatures, their wives, rela∣tions, and countrymen, when they were restored to their native island, after such a disagreeable exile. The tender passions reign here in full empire, without any ferocity; envy, ambition, avarice, jealousy, and revenge, have no scope nor field for exercise on this contracted scene. The people, bred up in innocent and social affection, are mild, sedate, compassionate, and humane. They relieve all strangers to the utmost of their power, with∣out respect to country, without any hope of re∣compense, especially those who have the misfor∣tune to suffer shipwreck. Persons in such distress they consider as objects immediately recommended by Providence to their friendship and assistance; and these they entertain with a warmth of hospi∣tality, which does honour to human nature. They look upon it as their duty to perform these good office to their fellow-creatures, even after having sus∣tained
<PB N="458" REF="4770"/>
repeated acts of ingratitude, violence, and brutality from mariners, who have plundered their houses, and deflowered their virgins. In conse∣quence of such insults, however, they have laid down a resolution to allow no more than ten men, and these unarmed, to land at one time from any ship or vessel.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of St. Kilda are but meanly habited in the Highland fashion. They wear hose made of coarse cloth, but no shoes in summer: their shirts are of coarse flannel, which they put off when they go to bed. The ordinary shoes and stockings of the women consist of the necks of Solan geese, which they slit open towards the breast; so that the foot is thrust down into it, and the creature's head serves for the heel of the shoe; this contrivance, however, is so slight, that they must have fresh shoes every five days. These people eat bread made of barley and oatmeal: they feed on mutton, beef, fish, wild fowl, and their eggs, and eat all their food without salt: they are particularly fond of the fat of their fowls, which they call giben; this they use in all their sauces, and apply externally to wounds and bruises. In short, it is their chief delicacy, and so agreeable to their stomachs, that a native of St. Kilda re∣moved to another country where it cannot be ob∣tained, pines for his giben; the want of which sometimes intails upon him a dangerous distemper, in the same manner as the Greenlanders and Zem∣blans pine for train oil. With this giben, used instead of butter, the St. Kilda people eat the sea plant dulse and slake, the roots of dock and silver-weed boiled, as well as stewed scurvy-grass, which in this island grows large, sweet, and savoury. They salt their cheese with the ashes of sea-ware, and preserve the eggs of their sea-fowl in the ashes of turf: thus secured they will keep fresh
<PB N="459" REF="4780"/>
for six, seven, and eight months. These eggs they eat in great numbers with a keen appetite, though to strangers they prove costive and feverish. The number allotted as a daily maintenance to the crew of two boats, amounted in three weeks to sixteen thousand. They preserve their Solan geese a whole year without salt, by slitting them down the back, and depositing them in stone pyramids, of which they have built above five hundred on the tops of rocks and mountains in this and the neighbouring islands. Of these birds the islanders consume about three and twenty thousand annual∣ly. Their ordinary drink is water or whey; yet upon extraordinary occasions they brew a kind of ale, fermented with the juice of nettle roots, and a kind of sour flummery made from barley meal. The men of St. Kilda amuse themselves in play∣ing at a game of ball with wooden clubs, in leap∣ing, swimming, and climbing. The women as∣semble in the middle of the village, where they discourse of their affairs, joke, sing, and make verses, spinning all the time at their distaffs. They are much addicted to superstitious charms, and some of them pretend to have the second sight. The disease to which they are chiefly sub∣ject is the dropsy, in all probability owing to their gross feeding on the rancid oil of animals without salt. When they are seized with this dis∣temper their appetites fail, their feet begin to totter, their faces grow red, bloated, and break out in pimples, the voice becomes hoarse, the respiration difficult, the hair falls off the crown of the head, and this is soon covered with a kind of ulceration. Martin sagaciously advised one of these lepers to take example from the Fulmar, which qualifies his whale's flesh with sorrel, to eat plenty of vegetables, abstain from the giben and fat fowls, and exercise himself every morning and
<PB N="460" REF="4790"/>
evening in climbing to the top of the high moun∣tains Connagor. By following these directions, he in a few days recovered his appetite and voice, which he had almost lost, and was left in a fair way of recovery.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the SECOND SIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>The second sight, called taish in the Erse lan∣guage, is supposed to be a supernatural faculty of seeing visions of events before they happen. This spirit of prophecy, if we may believe Martin, is bestowed by heaven upon many individuals in all the inhabited western islands of Scotland, and particularly in the isle of Skie; and indeed the delusion is so remarkable, that this author, in other respects a man of sense, learning, and cha∣racter, relates some surprising instances of the taish on his own knowledge, and many others on the credit of such evidence, as in matters of an ordinary nature could not be doubted. It is after him that we shall make the following remarks for the amusement of the reader. During this pre∣ternatural communication, the seer's eyes are seem∣ingly fixed and rivetted upon a vacant space, and his eye-lids raised and distorted as if he were in∣tranced. If a vision is seen early in the morn∣ing, it will be realised in a few hours; if at noon, it will happen that very day; if in the evening, probably that night; if after candles are lighted, it will certainly be accomplished before morning. Yet several times the seer has visions of circum∣stances that do not occur for whole weeks, months, and even years, after this intimation. When the image of a person appears in a shroud, the man or woman so represented will certainly die sooner or later, according to the manner in which the shroud is put on: if it reaches no higher than the
<PB N="461" REF="4800"/>
middle, the destined victim may live some months, and even survive the end of the year; but if it ascends towards the head, death is supposed to be at hand. Before a man's marriage, his future wife is often seen standing at his left-hand: the vision of a stranger is seen before his arrival, and accu∣rately described by the seer, though he had never heard of his name, and was quite ignorant of his coming. Martin declares, that he himself had been frequently seen at the distance of an hundred miles, by seers of both sexes, with whom he had no personal acquaintance. A spark of fire seen to fall upon a man's arm or breast, is counted a sure presage of a dead child. A seat appearing empty while a person actually sits in it, is reckon∣ed an infallible sign of that person's approaching death. When a novice sees a vision without doors in the night, he no sooner approaches a fire but he faints away. Visions are not visible to dif∣ferent seers when they chance to be together, until he who sees the object touches his brethren; then it is perceived by the brethren. The second sight is not confined to men, women, and children, but extends also to cows and horses, as appears by a very uncommon agitation in some of these animals, while the seer contemplates his vision. These people likewise pretend to foretel events by the senses of hearing and smelling. They hear loud cries resembling the voice of some particular person, whose death is thus signified: they fore∣smell flesh or fish boiling or broiling, at the time when neither is in the house, nor likely to be pur∣chased. Among a variety of incidents narrated by our Highland philosopher, we shall recite a few for their ridiculous singularity. A man in Lewis was haunted by a spirit in his own likeness, who attended him at work in the fields, and teized him with many impertinent questions: he likewise
<PB N="462" REF="4810"/>
appeared to him in his own house, but there was always silent. The poor man, by the advice of a neighbour, to whom he revealed his affliction, threw a live coal at the spirit at its next visitation. This assault gave such offence, that next day in the field he was beaten by it most unmercifully, so as to be confined to his bed for a fortnight. An inhabitant of the parish of St. Mary's, in the isle of Skie, being suddenly taken with a vomit∣ing, and falling back on the floor in a sort of a fit, declared upon his recovery, that a certan wo∣man, supposed to have a passion for him, which he treated with neglect, had appeared before him in all the rage and distraction of a slighted woman, pouring curses, reproaches, and threats, which had terrified him into that disorder of mind and body. Some inhabitants of Harries sailing in a boat to the isle of Skie, saw the apparitions of two men hanging from their tackle. When they arrived at Broadford in Skie, they found Sir Do∣nal Macdonald holding a sheriff's court, at which two criminals being condemned to die, the ropes of their boat were used in the execution. Archi∣bald Macdonald, in the village of Knockow, told his family one night, that he was troubled with a ridiculous vision of a man with a long cap continually shaking his head, and bearing in his hand a small harp of four strings, ornamented with two hartshorns. They laughed at his descrip∣tion as a fantastic chimera; but in three or four days the vision was realized by the arrival of a stranger buffoon playing upon such an instrument, with a long cap, to which two bells were affixed; and these he rang by shaking his head, keeping time with the musick of the harp, which exactly answered the description of the seer. The servants of Sir Norman Macleod, being assembled one night in his hall on the isle of Skie, while he him∣self
<PB N="463" REF="4820"/>
was absent, one of them having the second sight, told his fellow-servant that they must re∣move to another place, and leave that apartment to their betters. They were very little disposed to credit this prediction, considering the darkness of the night, and the danger that their master would run from the rocks to which his boat must be exposed. The seer insisted upon their leaving the hall, and in less than an hour a messenger ar∣rived from the water side with an account of the laird's having landed. Sir Norman, being in∣formed of this incident, examined the seer, who told him that he had seen the spirit called Browny in human shape enter the hall, and seem to carry off by neck and heels an old woman servant, who sat by the chimney-corner. Sir Norman playing one day at tables with another gentleman, was at a loss how to place his piece; and the butler, who stood behind his chair, directed him how to dispose of it: his advice was taken, and his master won the game; but knowing that the butler could not play at tables, he asked by what means he had stumbled on such a lucky expedient? The man answered, that he was directed by the spirit Browny, which he saw reach his hand over his honour's shoul∣der, and point to the place where the piece was to be entered. This Browny was supposed to be a fa∣cetious familiar, well known in all parts of Scot∣land, residing in the houses of gentlemen, where it played a thousand merry pranks for the enter∣tainment of the family.</P>
<P>Sixty miles to the westward of St. Kilda, is the Lewis, or long island, extending one hundred miles in length from north to south, and from thirteen to fourteen in breadth, consisting of a great number of isles and rocks, and parted by the sea into two divisions, called Lewis and Har∣ries; the former lying to the westward of the
<PB N="464" REF="4830"/>
other. Lewis belongs to the shire of Ross; is divided by several channels, distinguished by se∣veral names, and portioned out among different proprietors; but the Lewis, strictly so called, stretches about six and thirty miles in length, from the north point of Bowling head to the southern extremity of Hussiness in Harries. The air is temperately cold, moist, and healthy; great part of the low ground is flooded with lakes; the rest is arable in many places, and has been counted fruitful in oats, barley, rye, flax, and hemp. The soil in these parts is a light sand, which the inhabitants manure with soot and sea∣ware; but great part of the island is covered with heath. The labouring people dig the land with spades, break the clods with small harrows, the foremost teeth of which are made of wood, and the remainder of rough heath, which smooths what the others have broke; and this harrow is drawn by one man, having a strong trace of horse∣hair across his breast. Of their corn they not only make malt for ale, but likewise a strong spirit called <HI>Trestareg,</HI> which is the whisky, or usque∣baugh, three times distilled. Lewis abounds with convenient bays and harbours, namely, Loch∣stornvay, on the east side, the Birken isles, about seven miles farther southward, Loch-crefort, three miles more to the south, Loch-seafort about five miles still farther in the same direction; Loch-Carlvay, a capacious and secure harbour, about four and twenty miles to the south-west, and Loch-rague four miles more southerly on the same coast: all these bays abound with cod, ling, and herring: here are likewise whales of different sizes, which the natives drive into the bays and kill with harpoons. Fifty young whales have been killed on this coast, in one season; and their flesh was eaten by the natives, who count it salu∣tary
<PB N="465" REF="4840"/>
and toothsome, distinguishing it by the name of sea-pork. These bays afford great plenty of shell-fish; such as clams, oysters, cockles, mussels, lympits, wilks; and such a prodigious quantity of spout-fish is sometimes cast up from the sand off Loch-tua, that they infect the air, and render it unhealthy to the neighbouring inhabitants, who are not able to consume them, either by eating, or using them as manure for the ground. Some of these lochs and bays likewise produce small coral and coralline. The fresh-water lakes are well stored with trout and eels, and the rivers yield plenty of salmon. Along the coast are found a great number of caves, which serve as shelter for the seals and otters, which are also eaten as dainties by the inhabitants; and vast numbers of sea∣fowl build upon the rocks and promontories.</P>
<P>The land animals reared in this island, are cows, horses, sheep, goats, hogs, and deer; all these are of a diminutive size. The beef, mutton, and pork, are juicy and delicious; the horses are active and hardy; the deer, which are of the red kind, confine themselves to the chace of Oser∣vaul, about fifteen miles in compass, which af∣fords tolerable pasturage; but in the winter, when the ground is covered with frost and snow, these animals are forced to feed on sea-ware, and endure all the rigour of the season, without any shelter from wood or copse, for there is not a tree to be seen; nevertheless, the roots of very large trees, which have been cut by the ax, are found in different places. There is likewise a small grove of birch and hazle on the south-west side of Loch-Stornway.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Lewis, are in general well∣proportioned, tall, fair, sanguine, strong, and healthy. The small-pox sometimes makes terri∣ble havock among them. The other diseases to
<PB N="466" REF="4850"/>
which they are subject, are the chin-cough in children, the fever, the diarrhaea, dysentery, sore∣throats, jaundice, stitches, pleurisies, coughs, and rheums. As a medicine for the diarrhaea and dysentery, they administer the kernel of the black Molucca beans, powdered and drank in boiled milk; and sometimes the patient swallows a small dose of their strong whisky diluted with water. This is likewise prescribed to children in the small-pox, when the pulse sinks and the pustules do not fill. Inflammatory disorders they cure by repeated bleeding; coughs and colds are removed by drinking plentifully of warm brochan, or water-gruel, with butter or honey, taken at bed time; which not only acts as a balsamic pecto∣ral, but wonderfully promotes the discharge of sweat and urine. When the uvula is elongated, they snip off part of it with a pair of scissars: for the jaundice they sluice a pail full of cold water by surprize on the patient's naked back, or sear the vertebrae with an actual cautery, when he dreams of no application. Green wounds they cure with ointments made of vulnerary plants and fresh butter.</P>
<P>The natives of Lewis are quick of apprehen∣sion, and ingenious in mechanics, much addicted to poetry and musick, many of them learning to play on the bag-pipe and violin. They are in general sober, circumspect, and hospitable; dex∣terous in shooting, swimming, leaping; bold and skilful mariners; and so temperate, that they will tug at the oar all day, without any other provision than bread and water, with a snush of tobacco.</P>
<P>Along this coast we see several natural mounts or forts, called <HI>Dun,</HI> such as Dunrowly, Dun-co∣radel, and Dun-eisten. There are also the remains of some old castles, and other monuments of an∣tiquity. At Stornvay village we see the ruins of
<PB N="467" REF="4860"/>
a fortress destroyed by the English garrison sent thither by Oliver Cromwell. To the northward of Brago there is a round tower built of large stones, three stories high, tapering towards the top, with a double wall, and a circular staircase between, by which one may go quite round the building. On the heaths and summits of hills there are several cairns or heaps of stones, which served either for graves or beacons. In the parish of Barvas we see a single stone called the Thrushel, standing upright, above twenty feet high, and almost as much in breadth. Three stones, about twelve feet high each, are seen standing on the north side of Loch-Carlvay; and many others stand∣ing singly at great distances, and in remote parts of the island. But the most remarkable monu∣ment of this kind appears by the village of Clas∣serniss. Here we find nine and thirty pyramidal stones standing upright, about six or seven feet high from the surface, each about two feet in breadth. They are placed in form of an avenue, eight feet wide; the distance between every stone amounting to six feet, and a single piece stands at the entrance. This avenue leads to a circle of twelve stones of the same dimensions, with one in the center thirteen feet in length, and shaped like a rudder: on the east, south, and west sides of this circle, are four stones, such as those that compose this round and avenue, forming three lines, or as it were rays, from the body of the circle. This is supposed to have been a Druid temple; and tradition reports, that the chief Druid stood by the large stone in the center, and harrangued the audience. At the distance of a quarter of a mile there is another circle of the same nature; but, without the range and avenue. In all proba∣bility, these, as well as the monuments we have described in our account of the Orkneys, and
<PB N="468" REF="4870"/>
Stone henge on Salisbury-plain, were places of worship erected by the Danes in the time of pagan superstition. The chief town in Lewis is called Storn-Bay, from its situation at the head of the bay, known by this name: it is a village, consist∣ing of about sixty families, with a church, a gram∣mar-school, and some public-houses: here also resides the steward for the laird of Mackleod, who is proprietor of the island.</P>
<P>There is a considerable number of inferior ad∣jacent isles and rocks, some of which hardly de∣serve to be mentioned; such as the small island Garve, at the mouth of Loch Carlvay, Berinsay, Fladda, Bernera minor, and Bernera major, Kia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isy, Cavay, Carvay, Grenim, Pabay, Shirem, Vexay, Wuya the larger and lesser, and the Flan∣nan islands, which the seamen denominate the northern hunters. These are visited every sum∣mer by the inhabitants of the Lewis, who go thither in quest of fowls, eggs, down, quills, and feathers, as well as to sheer or kill the sheep that are kept here for pasture. As these islands are very steep and rocky, the visiters, after having landed and climbed up the rock by a ladder, un∣cover their heads, and making a turn sun-ways, thank God for having escaped the danger they have undergone. In the largest island are the ruins of a chapel dedicated to St. Flannan, from whom the isles derive their name. Thither the fowlers repairing, strip themselves of their upper garments, which being laid upon a stone, they advance towards the altar, and repeat three prayers; an exercise which is performed every morning and evening. They observe many other superstitious customs during their residence on these rocks; and when they have landed their boat with their purchase, return to the larger islands. Among the islands belonging to the Lewis, we may like∣wise
<PB N="469" REF="4880"/>
take notice of the small isle of Pigmies, so called, because bones resembling those of human creatures, but of very small dimensions, have here been dug out of the ground. Dependant also upon Lewis, is the island Rona, about two miles in circuit, at the distance of twenty leagues from the north-east point of Ness in Lewis. It was formerly inhabited by five families of natives, who lived in the most amicable simplicity; igno∣rant of vice, unacquainted with venality, having neither gold nor silver; but bartering the pro∣duce of their farms for the little necessaries of life, which their industry could not otherwise sup∣ply. Their houses were built of large stones, thatched with straw; the roofs being secured with ropes of the same stuff, poised with stones, to pre∣vent the tenement's being blown away. In this island there is a chapel dedicated to St. Ronan, where every Sunday morning the natives assembled, and repeated the Lord's prayer with the ten com∣mandments, this being the sum of their religious discipline. They wore the same habit, and spoke the same language that is used by the other High∣landers. They admired greyhounds, and were astonished at the sight of a horse, the neighing of which they mistook for laughter. They were ex∣tremely hospitable, and imagined themselves pos∣sessed of the gift of second sight; which is in effect a pretence to foresight or prophecy, by see∣ing apparitions of what will happen. The recep∣tion which, according to Martin, they gave to Mr. Daniel Morrison, minister of Barvas, to whose living their island belonged, was truly primitive and benevolent. <Q>Upon his landing, the natives ad∣dressed him to this effect: “God save you, pilgrim, you are heartily welcome; we have had repeated apparitions of your person among us, and we heartily congratulate your arrival in this remote
<PB N="470" REF="4890"/>
country.”</Q> Then they conducted him to their village, where he was saluted by every individual inhabitant, and introduced into the house assigned for his lodging, where he found a bundle of straw laid on the floor for an easy seat. After some con∣sultation, they left him to his repose, and the head of every family killed a sheep for his entertain∣ment. <Q>The skins being flayed off entire from the neck to the tail in form of a sack, they filled them with barley-meal, of which they made a present to the minister, while one of them har∣rangued him in these words: “Pilgrim, we are very sensible of the favour you have done us, in coming so far, and venturing your life on the great ocean, purely with a design to instruct us in the way to happiness; be pleased to accept of this small present, which we humbly offer as an expression of our sincere esteem and affec∣tion.”</Q> This little, harmless community was afterwards destroyed in consequence of successive misfortunes. A swarm of rats, from whence no man could tell, landed upon the island, and de∣voured all their corn. Some barbarous seamen rowing ashore robbed them of their bull; and during a whole year, they received no supply from Lewis. It is not improbable that some pi∣ratical ship-master kidnapped the majority of the natives, otherwise they must have died of famine; which was evidently the case with a poor forlorn woman, who with a child lying on her breast, was found dead at the side of a rock, by the stew∣ard of St. Kilda, who happened to be driven into Rona by stress of weather. In a few years after the extinction of this antient race, the minister sent a rew colony to the island with suitable sup∣plies. Four leagues to the eastward of Rona, appears the rock Soulisher, rising out of the sea, and almost covered with sea-fowl; among which
<PB N="471" REF="4900"/>
we reckon the Solan goose, the guillamote, the coulter-neb, the puffin, and the bird called colk, somewhat smaller than a goose, covered with down, and variegated feathers, with a tuft like that of a peacock on its head, and a tail longer than the train of a house-cock: the hen, however, is not so gaudily adorned. The island Scant, or as the natives call it <HI>More,</HI> lies about a league to the eastward of Ushiness in Lewis, and in fact consists of three islands, separated by spring-tides, or small channels, and about two miles in circum∣ference. In one of these there is a chapel dedi∣cated to the Virgin Mary; the soil is here fruitful of corn and grass; but the others produce nothing but a scanty pasturage. The least of these is sur∣rounded with high rocks, so as to be inaccessible, except in one place, where there is a natural stair∣case in the rock, which might be defended by a few men against a whole army. Here Martin saw two eagles, which the natives assured him would not suffer any other birds of the same species to reside on that island. They were never known to make prey of any thing belonging to the people among whom they lived; though the natives had often found in and about their nests the bones of wild fowl, fawns, and lambs, which they had killed in some of the neighbouring islands.</P>
<P>The islands of Lewis are divided into the two parishes of Barvas and Eye, and in each of these one minister is settled; but there is a great num∣ber of churches and chapels dedicated to different saints, in the different isles which compose this cluster. All these were sanctuaries before the Re∣formation, but now they are divested of that pri∣vilege. The people of these islands are presby∣terians, with a few protestants of the English com∣munion, and a still smaller number of Roman ca∣tholics. The protestants observe the festivals of
<PB N="472" REF="4910"/>
Christmas, Good Friday, Easter and Michaelmas; on the last of which the individuals of both sexes perform an anniversary cavalcade.</P>
<P>The isle of Harries, separated by a channel from Lewis, extends about four and twenty miles in length, and in some places about six miles in breadth. The air and climate are the same with those of Lewis: the face of the ground is rocky, and mountainous, covered with grass and heath: on the west side, however, the land is more flat and arable, producing naturally abundance of clover and daisy, which in the summer perfume the air with an agreeable fragrance. The soil is dry and sandy; but when manured with sea-ware, yields very great harvests of oats, rye, and barley. There are divers fresh water lakes in this island, abounding with trout, eels, and salmon; the over∣plus of every lake being discharged into the sea, by an agreeable serpentine river. The island is also furnished with some excellent springs issuing from the mountains, as well as with several foun∣tains, which are found to contain medicinal vir∣tues. There is one well near the village of Borve, the water of which proves efficacious in the cholic, stitches, and the gravel: there is another on the eastern coast, near Mervag-houses, remarkable for restoring lost appetites; but the waters of the w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g in plains near the sea, is brackish and unwholsome.</P>
<P>The best harbour in Harries lies within the land, and is called Scalpa by the natives; but known by the name of Glass among the sea-faring men. There are divers other commodious havens formed by inlets of the sea, called lochs; such as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, loch Stokeness, loch Finisbay; which last is an excellent harbour, though little known: over and above these there are many convenien<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> creek<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, affording secure anchorage to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and small vessels. Harries produces the
<PB N="473" REF="4920"/>
same animals we have described in our account of Lewis, the same little birds, fishes, and amphibi∣ous creatures, with the addition of the mertrick, a quadruped about the size of a cat, with a fine va∣luable fur of a brown colour: the number of deer that run wild among the hills and mountains of this island amounts to two thousand; no person is allowed to hunt them, without a licence from the forester; and there is one particular spot of ground reserved for the laird of Mackleod himself, who is always sure to find game enough when he is disposed for this diversion: yet in this forest, or in the whole island, there is neither tree nor shrub, except the heath, for the shelter of these poor animals. Here are two sorts of eagles, which do abundance of mischief among the flocks of sheep, deer, and poultry; and excellent hawks breed among the rocks of this island. No towns of any conse∣quence are seen on this, or any other of the He∣brides; but here we find some populous villages, the chief of which are Borve and Rowdil. The country presents the view of several Danish monu∣ments made with stones standing erect, round towers, and kairns, such as we have described in the former article: there are likewise divers arti∣ficial caves on each side of the coast, some of which are very strong, and almost impregnable by na∣ture. The largest and most remarkable of these is in the middle of a high rock on the hill of Ulweal, capable of containing fifty men, fur∣nished with two wells of water; and so difficult of access, that one man with a staff in his hand may defend it against a thousand assailants; for one only can enter at a time, and he must employ his hands in clambering, without being able to manage any sort of offensive weapon. On the east side of the village of Rowdil, we see a circular stone tower, about two stories high, and three fathom under water: there is such another, but of smaller
<PB N="474" REF="4930"/>
dimensions, on the other side of the bay. In all probability, the sea has gained upon the land in many places; for in these islands, fragments of old walls, and roots of large trees, have been discovered within low-water mark: perhaps this kind of subsidence may have been the effect of earthquakes.</P>
<P>The shore on the west coast of Harries affords a variety of curious shells, <HI>Tellinae, Turbines, Pa∣tellae, Pictines,</HI> Molucca beans, and great quan∣tities of the <HI>Os Sepiae.</HI> This last the natives take in powder with boiled milk, as an effectual re∣medy for the diarrhaea and dysentery; they like∣wise use it externally, to remove films from the eyes of sheep; the Molucca beans are worn as amulets against witchcraft. Ambergris is also found on the shore among these islands. A wea∣ver of Berrera found a lump of this substance, which he burned by night as a lamp, until the strong scent produced a severe head-ach, and dis∣covered its true nature.</P>
<P>What has been said of the inhabitants of Lewis, their language, religion, and customs, may be ap∣plied to those of Harries, with this difference, that they distil no spirit of their own, in lieu of which they purchase brandy: they use the seeds of the wild carrot for hops in brewing, they swal∣low a decoction of the <HI>allium latifolium,</HI> or wild garlick, as a powerful lithontriptic in the stone and gravel: they cure deafness by blowing pow∣der of tobacco into the ear through a quill, and adopt some other medical experiments, which are peculiar to their own island.</P>
<P>Some of the inferior isles of the Lewis and Har∣ries, we have already mentioned. Bernera lies about two leagues to the southward of Harries, and is five miles in circumference. The soil is sandy, and when manured with the alga marina,
<PB N="475" REF="4940"/>
extremely fertile, producing in some places an in∣crease thirty fold of barley; nay, one grain has been known to produce fourteen ears, when the season was remarkably favourable. The face of the island is extremely agreeable in summer, ex∣hibiting a pleasing variety of corn fields and clover pasture. Here is a fresh-water lake called Loch∣bruis, diversified with small islands, and abound∣ing with eels, which the natives, by the help of lights, catch in the night-time, as they fall down a rivulet towards the sea, in heaps twisted toge∣ther. There are two chapels in this island dedi∣cated to St. Asaph and St. Columbus; and near the former is a stone standing erect about eight feet above ground.</P>
<P>At the east end of this isle there is a strange reciprocation of the flux and reflux of the sea, and another no less remarkable upon the west side of the long island; the tides from the south∣west run along northward, so that during the or∣dinary course of the tides, the flood runs east in the Frith, where Bernera lies, and the ebb runs west: thus the sea ebbs and flows regularly for four days before, and as long after the full and change of the moon, the spring tides generally rising fourteen feet perpendicular, and the others proportionably; but for four days before, and as many after the quarter-moons, there is a singular variation: at that time, a southerly moon making high-water, the course of the tide being eastward, it begins to flow at half an hour after nine in the morning, and continues to flow till half an hour after three in the afternoon, when it is high∣water; but when it begins to ebb, the current runs still eastward, until it be low-water; so that the tide runs eastward twelve hours together, that is from half past nine in the morning, till half past nine at night; yet when the night tide be∣gins
<PB N="476" REF="4950"/>
to flow, the current turns, and runs west∣ward all night for twelve hours, during both flood and ebb: thus, the reciprocations continue, one flood and ebb running twelve hours eastward, and another running twelve hours westward, till within four days of the full and new moon; then they resume their ordinary course, running east during the six hours of flood, and west during the six hours of ebb. There is yet another phenomenon in these tides, not less remarkable than that we have described. Between the vernal and autumnal equinox, that is during one half of the year, the tides, about the quarter moons, run all day east∣ward, and all night westward; and during the other six months, their course is quite the reverse, westward in the day, and eastward in the night.</P>
<P>In the small island of Pabbay, there are two chapels, one dedicated to the virgin Mary, and the other to St. Muluag; and here resides the steward of St. Kilda. About half a league to the south∣ward lies the isle of Sellay, not more than a mile in circumference, yet yielding extraordinary pas∣turage. The isle Taransay, a league farther to the northward, three miles round, is fruitful in corn and grass, produces a considerable quantity of yellow talc, and boasts of two chapels dedicated to St. Tarran and St. Keith. The islands of Gasker, Scarp, Ensay, Quedam, Hermetra, and a cluster of other small isles on the east side of Harries, are too inconsiderable to deserve a parti∣cular description; most of them, however, are in∣habited, and the rest serve for pasture to sheep and black cattle. North Vist is separated from Har∣ries, by a channel about three leagues in breadth, the navigation through which, is rendered difficult by rocks above and below water. It lies to the southward of Harries, in form of a semi-circle, ex∣tending about nine miles in length from north to
<PB N="477" REF="4960"/>
south, and thirty in circumference. To the east∣ward the country is mountainous and barren; but on the west side the ground is plain and arable, and the soil exceedingly fertile, producing plenti∣ful harvests of barley, oats, and rye; even the hilly parts afford good pasturage for sheep and black cattle. They till the land first with a small sharp plough called wrestle, for drawing the line, and cutting the roots of the heath or bent; then fol∣lows, in the same tracks, the larger plough drawn by four horses. In this long range of islands, we likewise reckon South Vist, Borrera, Heiskir, Ille∣ray, Valay, Benbecula, Lingay, Erisca, Barray, and many others of lesser note, forming a sur∣prising number of inlets, creeks, and harbours teeming with the riches of the ocean. On the western coast of North Vist rises the rock Eousmil, famous for being the scene of an annual seal fish∣ing in the end of October. The fishermen row thither in their boat, against the wind, lest they should be driven out into the ocean, or give notice of their approach to the seals, which have the sense of smelling very acute. The crew, being landed on the rock, secure the passes, and then attack the seals with long staves, as they lie basking in the sun. These animals, being thus assailed, make the best of their way to the sea, and very often force the passes over the bellies of their antago∣nists, who endeavour to knock them down with their weapons, by smiting them on the forehead: sometimes the seal escapes with a tumour on his forehead, which makes a very ferocious addition to his aspect: sometimes he seizes his adversary's staff in his teeth, and carries it to sea as a trophy: many lose their lives, by endeavouring to save their young, which they tumble before them in their re∣treat. The islanders observe some strange peculi∣arities in these amphibious animals. A seal will
<PB N="478" REF="4970"/>
not eat any fish, until he has flea'd it with his nails and teeth. The males and females couple as regularly as if they were married: if any indi∣vidual presumes to encroach upon a female al∣ready disposed of, her mate, at his return, disco∣vers the insult by a wonderful sagacity, and takes vengeance on the adulterer in a bloody conflict, which often gives a red tincture to the sea. The seal and his mate are often seen in the attitude of kissing like lovers of the human species: the mothers are very tender of their young, until they are capable to provide for themselves, and then they drive them away with many hard blows. The natives of these islands pickle the flesh of seals with the ashes of sea-ware instead of salt, and eat it occasionally with a good appetite. This meat is found to be astringent; but the liver being dried, pulverized, and given in milk, aqua vitae, or red wine, is counted an infallible cure in the dysentery. Even persons of fashion will eat seal's flesh when cured in the manner of ham, and the vulgar Roman catholics on these islands are per∣mitted to feed upon them in Lent as natives of the sea. Their skins are made into ropes, caps, pouches, and girdles, worn as preventatives of the sciatica. Valay lies to the westward of North Vist, about four miles in circumference, flat and fruit∣ful in corn and pasture, with three chapels and two stone crosses about seven feet high. A league to the north-east is the island of Borera, nearly of the same magnitude and fertility, with a large lake of fresh water in the middle, and a burial place for the monks who died in these islands. In the island of Linguay by the south end of Bo∣rera, the ground affords plenty of peats and turf for fuel, though in ancient times it was held so sacred that no person would presume to use this benefit of nature. Here likewise are produced
<PB N="479" REF="4980"/>
sheep, goats, hogs, horses, and black cattle; these last are killed, salted in the hyde, and sent to Glasgow, where the merchants barrel them up in fresh pickle, and export them to the West-Indies. In this island we find eagles of different kinds, hawks, pheasants, growse, heath cock, pigeons, quails, plover, and a beautiful bird peculiar to the Highlands and Hebrides, called termogan, to∣gether with crows, and swans, and all the sea∣fowl common to those latitudes. Some of the eagles strike at salmon, and other fish that swim near the surface; some of them destroy young deer, of which there are a few hundreds in this island. The eagle fixing his talons between the deer's horns, beats him about the eyes with his wings, and terrifies the poor animal in such a manner, that he fatigues himself to death in run∣ning, and frequently falls over precipices. In the month of October the swans come hither with a north-easterly wind, and live in the fresh lakes till March, when they take their departure. The sea-fowl consist of the colk, which we have al∣ready described, the gawlin, not quite so large as the duck, which prognosticates fair weather, by singing in a melodious strain, from which the piper of St. Kilda composed a pibroch; the rain goose, larger than a duck, so called from its ut∣tering a doleful noise before rainy weather; the bishop of Carrara, large as a goose, party-coloured, with a white spot on the breast, sometimes weigh∣ing sixteen pounds, well provided with fat, which the natives apply as a sovereign remedy for the sciatica. This fowl seldom flies, but dives with great celerity: wild geese reside here in great numbers, and prove very destructive to the barley, notwithstanding all the methods which the farmers can contrive by gins, traps, and guns, to prevent the havock; the goyler, not larger than a swallow,
<PB N="480" REF="4990"/>
which never lands but in the month of January; it floats on the surface of the sea, and dives with incredible swiftness: a large number of these birds seen together is the infallible prelude to a storm, after which they disappear: for this reason the seamen term them malifigres, a corruption of malae-effigies. The screachan-aittin, about the size of a large mall, of a bluish colour, with a bill of a carnation hue; it shrieks hideously, and when its mate is killed, makes a lamentable noise for several days, in the place where it lost its consort. The Faskedar, as large as a middling sea-mew, flies with great rapidity, pursues lesser birds, and forces them to drop their prey, which it nimbly snatches before it falls to the ground. Among these islands one may perceive flocks of barren fowls of different kinds, which live separate from the rest of the species on bare rocks, without any nests or shelter.</P>
<P>Though the air in this place is exceedingly moist, the natives are nevertheless strong and healthy, and many attain to the age of one hun∣dred. They delight much in riding, an exercise which is favoured by the planeness of the country: at Michaelmas they have a cavalcade, fair, and races, when the natives of all ranks and sexes ap∣pear at the rendezvous on horseback, every young man having his sweetheart behind him. On this festal occasion, they give and receive presents mu∣tually; the men give knives and purses, and the women present curious garters and wild carrots. The island belongs to Mackdonald of Sleat: the inhabitants are chiefly Protestants, and beyond all other islanders remarkable for charity and hospi∣tality.</P>
<P>At the distance of two miles to the southward of North Vist, is the plain Benbecula, ten miles in compass, partly arable, partly covered with
<PB N="481" REF="5000"/>
heath, and exhibiting a number of fresh-water lakes, well stored with fish and fowl. Here are some small chapels and the ruins of a nunnery: the island belongs to Mr. Macdonald, who, with all the inhabitants, are Roman catholics.</P>
<P>At the same distance to the southward of Ben∣becula, lies the island of South Vist, stretching one and twenty miles in length, but no more than three or four in breadth. The eastern part is mountainous and heathy; but on the west there are large tracks of plain, arable land: these are often overflowed by inundations from fresh∣water lakes, which the inhabitants have not been able to restrain. Here are seen the ruins of divers forts, and a good number of kairns. The people are hospitable, superstitious, and famous for long life: about fifty years ago there was a man living on this island, said to be turned of one hundred and thirty, hale, strong, with a clear understanding, and memory unimpaired. They are generally Roman catholics, though they live on good terms with the Protestant minister.</P>
<P>The island Erisca, three miles in circuit, is partly arable, and yields good harvests, and be∣longs to Macdonald of Moidart. Here are several churches and chapels: the people are supposed to speak the Irish language in its original purity: one Fergus Beaton, a connoisseur in this dialect, was possessed of Irish translations of Hippocrates, Avicenna, Averroes, Johannes de Vigo, and Ber∣nadus Gordonus. Many of them still retain the ancient habit, and all of them are bigotted to the Roman catholic religion.</P>
<P>About two leagues and a half to the south∣west of south Vist appears the isle of Barray, or Barra, five miles in length and three in breadth, partly mountainous, and partly capable of cultiva∣tion, having the advantage of a commodious har∣bour
<PB N="482" REF="5010"/>
on the east side, and a good fishery of cod, ling, and salmon; which last are speckled, surprisingly nimble and shy, insomuch that the fishermen are obliged to use three nets within one another, that if the fish springs over two, it may be caught in the third. In the south end of Barray, there is an orchard planted with fruit-trees, though few of them produce fruit: but all sorts of pot-herbs and roots grow here in great perfection; nay, the natives even raised tobacco: but it never answered their purpose or expectation. This island, to∣gether with the adjacent smaller isles, belongs to the laird of Macneil, said to be the thirty-sixth in lineal descent from him of the same name, who first possessed this estate. He holds it however, in vassalage, from Mackdonald of Slate, to whom he pays a yearly quit-rent. In the little isle of Ker∣mul, about a quarter of a mile to the southward of Barray, is the family-seat, furnished with a watch-tower, and surrounded by a kind of fortifi∣cation. The cockman, or watchman, is constantly on the tower to reconnoitre and prevent surprize; and the government of the castle is vested in a constable, who is very cautious of admitting any stranger in the absence of Mackneil or his lady. The church on this island is dedicated to St. Barr, a wooden image of whom stands on the altar, and of this patron they recite a legend of miracles: hard by is a little chapel in which Mackneil and his descendants are interred. The inhabitants are very courteous and hospitable: as soon as any stranger lands on the island, they oblige him to eat, on the supposition that the keen air of the ocean must have sharpened his appetite. When three or four guests arrive, each, by ancient custom, is lodged in a separate house; and thus man and wife are very often parted. The natives chiefly em∣ploy themselves in fishing and climbing rocks for
<PB N="483" REF="5020"/>
eggs and sea fowl. The chief climber is distin∣guished by the name of <HI>gingich</HI> or hero, and pays dear for his pre-eminence. When the boat ap∣proaches the rock the gingich first leaps upon it, and, with the assistance of an horse-hair rope, draws his companions after him from one preci∣pice to another. At their return to the boats with their booty of eggs and fowls, the gingich, at the hazard of his life, jumps into the vessel, which is generally tossed by a violent agitation of the sea, and keeps her steady to the rock, until the rest enter: in compensation for his courage and dex∣terity, he is gratified with a larger proportion of their plunder.</P>
<P>When a tenant's wife dies, the husband makes application to Mackneil, desiring him to recom∣mend another helpmate, and his request is imme∣diately granted: then he visits her, carrying along with him a bottle of strong waters for the ce∣lebration of the marriage, which is consummated without further ceremony. When the husband dies, the widow presents the same petition, and is accommodated in the same manner. Should a te∣nant lose his milch cows by the severity of the season, or any other misfortune, Mackneil is obliged to supply him with the like number; and when an old man is past his labour, the laird maintains him in his own family, for the remain∣ing part of his life. There are several small isles to the southward of Barray, known by the name of the Bishop's isles, because they were held of the bishop: there are also divers small islands on the east and north, which afford pasturage, and the convenience of fishing. Mackneil of Barray, and all his dependants, are Roman catholics, and celebrate the feast of St. Barr with great solemnity, on the twenty-seventh day of September.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="5030"/>
Among the larger islands of the Hebrides we rank the isle of Skie, so called from Skianach, which, in the Erse dialect, signifies winged, be∣cause the two promontories of Valerness and Tro∣terness, by which it is bounded on the north-west and north-east, are supposed to resemble wings. The island lies between the shire of Ross and the western part of Lewis, extending forty miles in length from north to south, in some places twenty, and in others, thirty in breadth, the cir∣cumference of the whole amounting to about one hundred. This too is composed of many differ∣ent islands and rocks, the most remarkable of which we shall describe in their turns. The island of Skie is divided between two proprietors: the southern part belongs to the laird of Macleod, said to be lineally descended from Leod, son to the black prince of Man: the northern district, or barony of Trotterness, is the property of Sir James Macdonald, whose ancestor was Donald, king or lord of the isles, and chief of the nu∣merous clan of Macdonalds, who are counted the most warlike of all the Highlanders. Skie is part of the shire of Inverness, and formerly be∣longed to the diocese of the isles: on the south, it is parted from the main land by a channel three leagues in breadth, though at the ferry of Glenelly it is so narrow that a man may be heard calling for the boat, from one side to the other. Skie is well provided with a variety of excellent bays and harbours; for example, on the south, by the peninsula Oronsa, otherwise called Diurman; to the eastward, between Skie and the island Scalpa; to the north, Lochs-legichan, and Loch-portry, which last is a capacious harbour; the island Tulm at the most nothern extremity; on the west Loch-uge, Loch-snisort or Loch-arnisort, Loch-fallart, Loch-brackadil, Loch-einard, Loch∣slapan,
<PB N="485" REF="5040"/>
Loch-affort, and an anchoring place for barks, between Skie and the isle of Soa. Some of these, however, are to be attempted with great caution, on account of rocks under water, and dangerous currents.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>The face of the country is roughened with mountains, some of which are so high, as to be covered with snow on the top, at Midsummer: in general their sides are cloathed with heath and grass, which afford good pasturage for sheep and black cattle. Between the mountains there are some fertile vallies, and the greater part of the land toward the sea-coast, is plain and arable. Where there is such a number of hills, the coun∣try must abound with springs and fountains, the water of which is remarkably pure, and in many wells counted medicinal. The island is well wa∣tered with a great number of rivers, above thirty of which afford salmon; and some of them pro∣duce black mussels, in which pearls are bred; particularly the rivers Kilmartin and Ord: Martin was assured by the proprietor of the former, that a pearl had been found in it, valued at twenty pounds sterling. Here is a considerable number of fresh-water lakes well stored with trout and eels. The largest of these lakes takes its denomi∣nation from St. Columbus, to whom is dedicated a chapel that stands upon a small isle in the mid∣dle of the lake. Skie likewise affords several ca∣taracts that roar down the rocks with great im∣petuosity. That the island has been formerly co∣vered with woods, appears from the large trunks of fir, and other trees, daily dug out of the bogs and peat marshes in every part of this country. There are still several coppices of woods scattered
<PB N="486" REF="5050"/>
up and down the island; but they afford no tim∣ber of any consequence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, VEGETABLE, MINE∣RAL, ANIMAL.</HEAD>
<P>The air is cold and moist; the climate rainy, but not unwholsome: indeed, the people pretend to qualify it by drinking large doses of usque∣baugh. The east wind is attended with fair wea∣ther; the south-west with rain; the wind from the north is cold and pinching: in summer, the wind always blows stronger by land than by sea; but in winter the contrary phoenomenon is ob∣servable. The wind, in summer, sometimes blows from different quarters, at the same time, insomuch that two boats will sail in contrary directions within a league of each other. The tide of ebb runs southerly, and the flood northerly, except where interrupted by headlands or promontories; in which case, the tides hold a contrary course. The ebb is always lowest with a north wind, and the flood highest when it blows from the south: the two chief spring tides happen at or near the ver∣nal and autumnal equinox.</P>
<P>The mould of this island is generally black, though it likewise affords clay of different co∣lours; such as white, red, and blue, and in some places fuller's earth. At the villages of Borue and Glenmore, the natives dig very fine earth of various colours, of the consistence of tallow; and, in different parts, they find abundance of fine white marl, which being spread upon a piece of ground covered with heath, destroyed this shrub in a short time root and branch, and enriched the soil to such a degree, that when sown with barley, it yielded an increase five and thirty fold. The isle of Skie produces barley, oats, rye, pease, and
<PB N="487" REF="5060"/>
plenty of grass for pasture, together with pot-herbs and roots for the kitchen: in the article of fruit it is very defective; though there are some in the or∣chards belonging to the proprietors. Among the plants which it brings forth in common with the other isles, we reckon wild sage, wild thyme, the myrtillis, the erica baccifera, violets, tansy, the myrrhis silvestris, urtica, chickweed, foxglove, camomile, scurvy-grass, sorrel, flamula-jovis or spirewort, crowfoot, wild garlick, cariophyleta alpina chamectreos foliis, found in no other part of Britain, carmel, or the argatilis sylvaticus, dis∣tinguished by a blue flower in Italy, plantane, hart's-tongue, maiden-hair, yarrow, St. John's∣wort, golden-rod, and the herb shunnis, peculiar to these islands and some parts of the opposite main land. It is highly valued by the natives, who eat it raw and sodden, with flesh, fish, and milk. Of the sea plants, the chief are linarich, slake, alga∣marina, and dulse: the medicinal uses of all these plants are well known to the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The minerals found in the isle of Skie are lead and iron ore, which, however, have never been wrought to any advantage. Near the village Sartle, the natives find black and white marcasites, and variegated pebbles. The applesglen, in the neighbourhood of Loch-fallart, produces beauti∣ful agates of different sizes and colours: stones of a purple hue are, after great rains, found in the rivulets: chrystal, of different colours and forms, abounds in several parts of the island, as well as black and white marble, free-stone, lime∣stone, cornua ammonis, velumnites, the lapis hecticus and talc: small red and white coral is found on the southern and western coasts in great abundance; and there are divers caves in the island, from the roofs of which a petrifying fluid distils. The fuel of this island consists chiefly of
<PB N="488" REF="5070"/>
peat and turf, which are impregnated with iron ore and salt-petre; and coal has been discovered in several districts.</P>
<P>The animals of Skie, are such as we have de∣scribed in the other larger islands, horses, hogs, sheep, goats, cows, and deer: the black cattle are here, as in other parts of this country, exposed to all the rigors of a severe winter, without any other provender than the tops of the heath and the alga marina; so that they appear like mere skeletons in the spring, though as the grass grows up, they soon become plump and juicy, the beef being sweet, tender, and finely interlarded. These animals distinguish the time of ebb, by a sure in∣stinct, even when they are not in sight of the shore, whither they hasten in a string one after another. Here are land and water fowl in abun∣dance, eagles, hawks, heathcocks, growse, tar∣magan, pidgeons, plover, wild geese, cranes, coulternebs, guillamots, malls, sea cormorants, and carraras. The amphibious animals are seals and otters. Among the reptiles they reckon vipers, asps, weasels, frogs, toads, and three different kinds of serpents; the first spotted black and white, and very poisonous; the second, yellow with brown spots; and the third of a brown co∣lour, the smallest and least poisonous. All the coast of Skie swarms with fish, cod, ling, mac∣karel, whiting, haddock, thornback, turbot, grey lord, or blackmouth, as large as a salmon, and herrings, which they preserve without salt, by gutting and hanging them to dry in the smoke. In the bays and anchoring places, the natives find shell-fish of all kinds. The kyle of Scalpa teems with oysters in such a manner, that, after some spring tides, twenty horse-loads of them are left upon the sands. Near the village of Bernstill, the beach yields mussels sufficient to maintain
<PB N="489" REF="5080"/>
sixty persons per day; this providential supply helps to support many poor families in times of scarcity. Shell-fish are plumper at the increase than at the decrease of the moon, as also while the wind blows from the south-west. Cockles and spout-fish sink deeper in the sand during a north wind. The limpits cling so fast to the rocks, that it is necessary to knock them off with a hammer, unless they are surprised in moving, and then the least touch will pull them away. When eaten in June, they are said to be productive of the jaundice, but at all other times delicate food of easy digestion. The fish and shell of the wilk and periwinkle are bruised and boiled together, and the broth being strained and drank for several days successively, is accounted a good remedy for the stone.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>INHABITANTS.</HEAD>
<P>The people here, as in the other islands, are strong, robust, healthy, and prolific: they gene∣rally profess the Protestant religion; are honest, brave, innocent and hospitable. They speak the language, wear the habit, and observe the customs that are common to all the Hebrides. The me∣conium in new-born infants is purged away with fresh butter: the children are bathed every morn∣ing and evening in water, and grow up so strong, that a child of ten months is able to walk alone: they never wear shoes or stockings before the age of eight or ten, and night-caps are hardly known: they keep their feet always wet: they lie on beds of straw or heath, which last is an ex∣cellent restorative: they are quick of apprehen∣sion, ingenious, and very much addicted to music and poetry. They eat heartily of fish; but sel∣dom
<PB N="490" REF="5090"/>
regale themselves with flesh-meat: their or∣dinary food consists of butter, cheese, milk, po∣tatoes, colewort, brochan, and a dish called oon, which indeed is no other than the froth of boiled milk or whey raised with a stick like that used in making chocolate. This kind of syllabub they eat with spoons, and find it as nourishing as much more substantial food. Their bread is very often made of corn cut down for the purpose: they set the straw on fire, and the grain is left scorched on the ground: this is immediately ground and baked; and the bread thus produced, is called graddan, more palatable than that made in the other way, but not so astringent and nourishing. Perhaps they are more than their neighbours dis∣posed to observe the moon's influence. They dig their peats, build up their earthen dykes, fell their wood, and even cut rushes always in the moon's decrease, having observed that if these operations are performed in the increase, the peats will always continue moist and burn smoaking, the dykes will moulder, the timber rot, and the rushes tear.</P>
<P>Of all the islanders, the natives of Skie are counted the best physicians, though they use no other remedies than those that are naturally found in their own country. For inflammatory disorders they let blood, administer a kind of ptisan of violets boiled in water, and promote a diaphoresis, by directing the patient to put on a wet shirt, which has been boiled, while it is yet smoking hot: but the ancient method of sweating practised by these islanders seems to have been more effectual. They first heated the earthen floor like an oven; then swept away the fire, covered the place with straw, upon which they poured water, and the patient lying down amidst the steam, underwent a pro∣fuse sweat. To procure passage by stool or urine,
<PB N="491" REF="5100"/>
they give a decoction of the plant dulse, with some fresh butter: as a narcotic, they use a de∣coction of chick-weed warm, by way of fomenta∣tion, the feet, knees, and ancles; and likewise apply the plant in substance warm to the neck, and between the shoulders. As a frontal, for the same purpose, they mix the tops of nettles with the whites of eggs, and lay it in a poultice to the temples. The plant linarich bruised is likewise applied to the head and temples, as a cure for the megrim; as is likewise the erica baccifera boiled in water. For the scarlet fever, they prescribe brandy. The jaundice is cured by searing the ver∣tebra in the manner before described. The sciatica is expelled by rubbing the part affected with the fat of the Carrara fowl; but the most effectual me∣thod of overcoming this distemper, is by raising a blister on the part with the flamula jovis, or wild crowfoot. Some drink an infusion of the flamula jovis, as a purge; and in order, to save their throats from excoriation, swallow it in a vehicle of melted butter. Water-gruel without salt, the infusion of mountain garlic, and of dulse, and the broth of wilks and limpets, are counted specifics in the stone. Scurvy-grass boiled, and eaten with butter, is supposed to be a sovereign cure for the cholic, costiveness, and stitches. An in∣fusion of tansy in whey or whisky, is thought to kill worms. The root of the plant carmel is an aromatic cordial, and carminative, with which the natives give a flavour to their aqua vitae. Wild sage is used both in substance and decoc∣tion, as a remedy against worms in horses; and is said to cure blindness in sheep and cattle, by being chewed and stuffed into their ears. As remedies against fluxes, they give the syrup of bilberries, a decoction of plantane and water, in which the hectic stone, heated red hot, has been
<PB N="492" REF="5110"/>
quenched. For the tooth-ach they apply the flamula jovis to the temples in a limpet shell; or a green turf heated among embers to the side of the head affected. In coughs and hoarseness they bathe the feet in warm water, for the space of fifteen minutes; then rub a quantity of deer's grease into the soals of the feet. For consumptions they administer ale, in the wort of which hart's tongue and maiden's hair have been infused: they prescribe for ordinary drink milk or water, in which the hectic stone has been quenched; the patients wash their hands and feet in the same infusion, and drink plentifully brochan and milk, in which the plant yarrow and the hectic stone have been boiled. They pretend to cure the iliaca passio, by giving a draught of cold water with a little oatmeal in it, and hanging the patient by the heels: a large handful of dulse is exter∣nally applied to the belly, against the same dis∣order, as well as to expel the after-birth. For purges they take strong infusions of scurvy-grass and dulse, with a little fresh butter; and for ape∣rient chsters they inject the decoction of the plant mercury, or iris, with salt butter. They make vulnerary ointments of St. John's wort, or golden rod, mixed with sheep's grease or fresh butter; but the most effectual is supposed to be the fat of fowls made into a pudding in the bird's own stomach. The remedies they use for the bites of vipers and serpents are these: they pluck the rump of a live house-cock, and apply it to the wound, from whence it is believed to suck the poison: the cock immediately swells and dies, and no beast or bird of prey will touch his carcase: they wash the wound with water, in which they have steeped the forky sting, which is no other than the tongue of the adder: they apply to the part affected the head of the serpent that gave the wound: new cheese
<PB N="493" REF="5120"/>
laid in time to the wound, is supposed to extract the poison: we may venture to say, that in many cases none of these remedies will prove effectual. When bones are broken they apply to the fractured part a paste made of barley-meal and the whites of eggs, and sustain the limb with splinters. In∣flammations of the eyes they cure by applying to them the plant fern, mixed up with the white of of an egg, and spread on a pledget of tow: they ripen boils and tumours with a warm poultice of the female jacobea, malaxed with fresh butter. Martin tells us of two brothers, natives of this island, who after they had been about nine or ten hours at sea as fishermen, always found their bellies begin to swell; but never could force a passage, either by stool or urine, until they came ashore, and then they evacuated both ways with∣out any difficulty. At length one of their com∣panions carried a green turf into the boat, which at first was the source of a quarrel, but afterwards produced a very agreeable effect. When their bellies began to swell as usual, and they were racked with excruciating pains, the author of the expedient with difficulty prevailed on them to stand on the turf; in which attitude they succes∣sively obtained a free evacuation: and this con∣trivance never failed in the sequel.</P>
<P>There are two fairs held annually at Portry, on the east side of Skie; the first on the middle of June, the other about the beginning of Septem∣ber. The commodities here sold, are horses, cows, sheep, goats, hides, butter, cheese, fish, and wool. The cattle sold in these fairs swim over to the main land through a mile, or half a mile of sea. Many thousands of these beasts are driven yearly up to England, where they are fatted for the market, and counted delicious eating.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="5130"/>
In Skie, as in the other islands, appear many ruins of Danish forts, watch-towers, beacons, temples, and sepulchral monuments; nor is there wanting a great number of caves or caverns, some of which are capacious, and almost impregnable. All the forts are known by the term <HI>Dun,</HI> such as Dun-Skudborg, Dun-Derig, Dun-Skeriness, Dun-David, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Skie is surrounded by inferior isles. Soa-Bret∣til, to the southward, is five miles in circum∣ference, exhibiting a mixture of heath, wood, morass, and pasture ground, producing red garden corinths, supposed to have been carried thither by birds; but very little improved by agriculture. The island Oronsa, a peninsula at low water, may be about a mile in circuit, and is remarkably fer∣tile. The isle of Pabbay, more to the northward, two miles in compass, produces excellent pasture, and the shore affords plenty of crabs and lobsters. Scalpa, in the same direction, is twice as large, generally mountainous, woody, and well watered with springs and rivulets. On the east side of the island, a stream running down the face of a rock petrifies into a white substance, of which the na∣tives make excellent lime. Near the same place is a quarry of free-stone. On the west side there are divers caves, which serve for lodging to some families that go thither in the summer for the convenience of grazing, hunting, and fishing. All the inhabitants are fishermen; and a law pre∣vails among them, that all their fishing lines must be of an equal length. Here likewise are some Danish forts, one of which, called the castle Vreokle, is three stories high. The property of the island is vested in Mr. Mackleod, a cadet from the laird of Mackleod: he lives in the village of Clachan, which is adorned with a small tower, and provided with an orchard that produces some
<PB N="495" REF="5140"/>
fruit and berries; he is respected with the utmost veneration by his tenants, who are all Protestants, remarkable for their hospitality. The small islands of Rona, Fladda, Altvig, Troda, Fladda-chican, with its surrounding rocks, in which the monk Ogorgon lies buried; Tulm, Ascrib, Timan, Isa, Mingoy, Bria, and Harlas, are too inconsiderable to deserve a particular description: it may suffice to say, that, in general, they are fit for pasture, afford plenty of fish, and a great number of sea∣fowl.</P>
<P>At the distance of four leagues to the south∣ward of Skie, is the small island of Cannay, which with Rum, Egg, Muck, and Aich, lie in a cluster opposite to the coast of Lochaber. Cannay, about two miles in length, is surrounded with rocks, pro∣duces corn and pasture, affords a fishery of cod and ling, and good anchorage on the north-east part of the island. The natives are Roman catholics, and have a church dedicated to St. Columbus: the isle belongs to a gentleman of the name of Macdonald.</P>
<P>Rum extends five miles from north to south, is for the most part mountainous and heathy; yet arable towards the sea-coast, watered with rivers well stored with trout and salmon. The hills afford pasturage to sheep, cattle, and some hun∣dreds of deer. The inhabitants are protestants, who use a small chapel for worship, and the island belongs to Macklean, of Coll.</P>
<P>Egg, being three miles in length, is mountain∣ous from the middle towards the west; but on the other side more plain and arable. On the south side there is a commodious harbour; on the south-west a large cave or cavern large enough to contain three hundred men; on the north-west we find a quarry of soft, white stone; to the southward is the high rock Skeer-egg, with a fresh
<PB N="496" REF="5150"/>
water lake in the middle: this is a natural fort, because there is no access to it, but by one narrow passage. Here are divers wells accounted medi∣cinal, particularly one in the village of Froepen∣nies, and that called St. Katharine's, on the south coast of the island: this fountain having been consecrated by a popish priest, is held in great ve∣neration by the islanders, who generally profess that religion, and are remarkably superstitious. They exercise their devotion in a church on the east side of the isle, dedicated to St. Donnan, who is their tutelar saint. The proprietors of the island are Mackdonald, of Moydort, and Mack∣donald, of Moron.</P>
<P>Muck may be four miles in circumference, mountainous and rocky, yet producing some corn and good pasture, which last serves to feed abund∣ance of sheep and black cattle. The rocks afford excellent hawks, and the sea plenty of fish.</P>
<P>Aich is a very small island, that merits no de∣scription.</P>
<P>At the distance of about four leagues to the north-east, lie the islands of Coll and Tire-iy, di∣vided by a channel half a league in breadth. Coll stretches ten miles in length, and three in breadth, is rocky and mountainous; though towards the north side the ground admits of cultivation, and yields good crops of barley. It is watered with one lake, and divers rivers stocked with trout and salmon. Cod and ling abound on this coast, of a larger size than are those which frequent the ad∣jacent isles and continent. On the south-east coast lie the ridge of rocks, called the Cairn of Coll, which have often proved fatal to mariners. To the south-east stands the castle of Macklean of Coll, the proprietor, who professes the Protestant religion, which is embraced by all the inhabitants. This isle is much more healthy than that of Tire∣iy
<PB N="497" REF="5160"/>
in the neighbourhood; and it is observable, that it produces a greater number of male than female children; whereas, the reverse is remark∣able in the other island.</P>
<P>Tire-iy, so called from Tire, a country, and iy an isthmus, stretches four miles in length, affords no convenient harbour, is generally flat, low, fer∣tile in corn, and its pasture grounds are believed to excel those of any other isle among the He∣brides; yet the western side is rocky and barren. The natives preserve their ale in large earthen vessels, which they prefer to wooden casks. Small whales often run themselves ashore on this island, and are eaten by the inhabitants, who term it sea∣pork, and count it both wholesome and salutary. Here are several Danish forts and circles of stones, like those we have already described. The inha∣bitants profess the protestant communion, and the parish church is called Soroby. The people are subject to the ague, and in the southern parts are mostly bald. The duke of Argyle is pro∣prietor of the island, though it formerly belonged to the laird of Maclean.</P>
<P>Between these islands and the main land, lies Mull, over-against Lochaber, Swoonard, and Moy∣dort, from which it is separated by a narrow chan∣nel. This island, belonging to the sheriffdom of Argyle, extends about twenty-four miles in length, and is nearly of the same breadth. A large ridge of mountains runs through the mid∣dle of the isle, remarkably high in some places. The coast is rocky on the west; but there are anchoring places and bays in different corners of the island. The bay of Duart, on the east side, is counted a good harbour, and much fre∣quented by strangers: Lochbuy, on the oppo∣site shore, affords but indifferent riding: there is likewise the Bloody Bay, opposite to the north
<PB N="498" REF="5170"/>
end of I-colm-kill, fit only for small vessels, to∣gether with Loch-leven to the north-east, Loch∣lay, and Loch-scafford. Near the north-east end of Mull, lies the island Calve, above two miles in compass, and forming with the other a capa∣cious bay, called Tonber-mory, in which the Flo∣rida, one of the largest ships of the Spanish ar∣mada, was blown up by one Smollet of Dumbarton. It was supposed that she had on board a large sum of money; a circumstance which has induced se∣veral adventurers to dive upon the wreck, with the permission of the duke of Argyle. Pieces of gold and silver, beads, pins, toys, and some fine brass cannon have been recovered; but not enough to defray the expence of diving. Mull is remark∣ably well watered with many springs, brooks, rivers, and lakes, in which there is store of salmon and eeis. The sea produces plenty of fish; the shore harbours seals and otters; and the moun∣tains affords shelter to a numerous breed of foxes, that do infinite mischief among the lambs and poultry. Here are wild fowl within land, and sea-birds on the shore in great abundance. The ground yields excellent peat and turf for fewel: the hills and valleys are covered with grass and a variety of herbage, affording sustenance to nu∣merous flocks of sheep, goats, and deer, besides great herds of black cattle, and small mettlesome horses. The air being temperately cold and moist, the natives take large doses of whisky by way of corrector, and chew the charmel root as an excellent restorative. They have two parish churches and a little chapel, and generally pro∣fess the protestant communion. There are three seats or houses that belonged to gentlemen in different parts of the island. Castle-Duart, on the east, built upon a rock, and partly surround∣ed by sea, belonged to Sir John Maclean, chief of
<PB N="499" REF="5180"/>
that ancient clan; but, he having forfeited his estate, this castle, with the major part of the island, became the property of the duke of Argyle: on the west coast stands the castle of Moy, belonging to Maclean of Lochbuy: the third is called the castle of Aros, situated in the middle of the island, but now in ruins. Here are likewise the remains of Danish forts and monuments. Mull is sur∣rounded by many small isles, such as Eorsce, Inch∣kenneth, Vevay, Ulva, Fludday, Lungay, Bach and Call of Bach, together with the inlets Kairn-burg∣more, and Kairn-burg-beg, which are natural fortresses, rendered almost inaccessible by steep rocks and violent currents.</P>
<P>The most celebrated of all the western islands is Jona, likewise called St. Columb-kill, from St. Columba, who came hither from Ireland, and here lies buried. The island stretches two miles in length from south to north in the neighbourhood of Mull, and is about a mile broad from east to west. One end of it is rocky and barren; the other, plain, arable, and fruitful. Columba having con∣verted the nothern Picts by his preaching, their king is said to have bestowed upon him this island, where he erected two churches and two monaste∣ries, and instituted a seminary that soon became famous for learning and sanctity. These founda∣tions were richly endowed by the kings of Scot∣land and lords of the isles: Jona became the ca∣thedral of the bishop of the isles, and, on account of its supposed sanctity, was chosen as a burying∣place for kings, heroes, and churchmen. St. Mary's church in this island is built in form of a cross, in the Gothic manner; on each side of the choir are two chapels, having, at the entrance, large pillars carved in basso-relievo: the steeple, doors, and windows are adorned with curious fret∣work: the altar is large, magnificent, and com∣posed
<PB N="500" REF="5190"/>
of fine polished marble. Within the church several abbots are interred, and among these Mac∣Ilikenich, whose statue of black marble appears as big as the life, in an episcopal habit, with the mi∣tre and crosier: the rest are represented in the same manner, and some distinguished by Latin in∣scriptions. Behind the church are the ruins of a cloister, library, and hall, in which last there used to be public disputations. At the west end of the church, in a little cell, we find the tomb of Co∣lumba, but undistinguished by any inscription. Hard by stands the cross of St. Martin, an intire porphyry stone, eight feet high above the ground, standing on a pedestal, and exhibiting, on the east side, the figure of a tree, and on the west, a large crucifix. A little distance from hence we see the ruins of Dun-ni Manich or Monks fort, built of stone and lime, which seems to have been a kind of raised bastion, on which the monks enjoyed the cool air, and a prospect of the whole country. A little farther westward lie the black stones, so called, not for their colour, which is grey, but on account of the dreadful vengeance which was said to overtake all those who swore an oath on these stones, and were afterwards guilty of perjury. Kneeling on these stones with uplifted hands, Mac∣donald, lord of the isles, confirmed the grants of lands to his adherents and vassals, solemnly swear∣ing before witnesses, that he would never revoke the rights and privileges he then bestowed.</P>
<P>The other church in Jona is called St. Ouran's, from the patron to which it is dedicated. The stateliest tomb in this church belongs to the laird of Mac-kinnon. On the wall above appears a crucifix engraved with the family arms under∣neath. On the tomb-stone lies a statue as big as the life, in armour, a ship under sail, a lion at the head, and another at the feet, with this inscription,
<PB N="501" REF="5200"/>
<HI>Hic est abbas Lachlan Much-fingone, et ejus filius, Abbates de I. Aetatis in Dno. Mo. CCCC. Ann.</HI> But the most remarkable spot is the coemetery on the south side, in which the king and chieftains lie buried under shrines. Each particular vault was distinguished by an inscription; but these are now not legible. In that on the right hand, four kings of Ireland were interred: on the left, eight kings of Norway lie buried; and in the middle∣most, eight and forty kings of Scotland. Here are likewise the tombs of Macdonald of Ila, Gil∣bred, and Paul Sporran, ancient tribes of the same name; the Macleans of Duart, Lochbuy, and Coll, Macalister, likewise a branch of the Mac∣donalds Mac-ouvery of Ulvay, and several digni∣fied clergymen, one of which exhibits this in∣scription: <HI>Hic jacet Johannes Turnbull, quondam episcopus Canterburiensis.</HI> All these monuments are of laymen, adorned with statues in armour, and armorial ensigns engraved in stone.</P>
<P>About a quarter of a mile farther south, is the church of Ronad, the burying-place of several ab∣besses, one of whom is thus inscribed. <HI>Hic jacet Dna. Anna Terleti, filia quondam prioressa de Jona, quae obijt anno Mo. Christi, animam Abrahamo com∣mendamus.</HI> If this inscription be true, the prio∣resses in those days did not live a life of celibacy: though, indeed, a little alteration in the punctu∣ation and orthography, will destroy this supposi∣tion: for example: <HI>Hic jacet Dna. Anna, Terleti filia, quondam prioressa de Jona, &amp;c.</HI> In the mid∣dle of a long pavement belonging to the adjoin∣ing nunnery, stands another stone cross, called Maclean's cross, like that which we have already described: on the shore is a small dock dug to preserve the curich or boat, made of timber co∣vered with hides, in which Columba is said to have transported himself and eighteen ecclesi∣astics
<PB N="502" REF="5210"/>
from Ireland. One copy of this apostle's life, written in the Irish character, which by the bye, is no other than the old Saxon, was in the possession of John Macneil in the isle of Barray; and another in the hands of Macdonald of Benbe∣cula. The monastery of Jona furnished divers bishops to the dioceses of Scotland and England; among others, the famous Aidanus, bishop of Lindisfairn, now Holy Island.</P>
<P>The Isle of Jurah, lying opposite to Knapdale in Argyle, belongs to the duke of that name, is four and twenty miles in length, and in some places seven miles broad. The face of the coun∣try is generally mountainous, and remarkable for four hills, the two highest of which, being very conspicuous both at sea and land, are called by mariners the paps of Jurah. On the coast there is some arable land, and on the hills, good pasture for horses, black cattle, sheep, goats, and deer. On the west side of the island, there is an an∣choring place called Whitfarlan: towards the north end is the bay Da'l yaul; on the same coast ano∣ther riding-place for vessels is formed by the small isles of Jurah, Nin Gowir, and Coney isle. The shore on the west side affords coral and co∣ralline. Between the north end of Jurah and the small isle Scarba, we observe the famous whirlpool called Cory-Vrekan, from Brecan, son to a king of Denmark, who perished in this gulph. His body being cast ashore on the north side of Jurah, was buried in a cave, and his grave is still distinguished by a tomb-stone and altar. In this vortex, which extends about a mile in breadth, the sea begins to boil and fer∣ment with the tide of flood, increasing gradu∣ally to a number of whirlpools, which, in the form of pyramids, spout up the water with a great noise, as high as the mast of a small vessel,
<PB N="503" REF="5220"/>
agitated into such a foam as makes the sea ap∣pear white even at the distance of two leagues. About half flood the violence begins to decrease, and continues to subside, till about half an hour after high-water: then it boils till within an hour of low-water, when the smallest fishing boat may cross it without danger. An English vessel chanc∣ing to pass this way when the vortex was in its most violent agitation, the master and crew mis∣took it for breakers on sunken rocks, by which finding themselves attracted in spite of all their endeavours to tack about, they hoisted out their boat, and thought themselves happy in reaching the shore of Jurah. Mean while the ship, being left to the mercy of the seas and weather, was driven upon the coast of Knapdale, and entered a creek, where the people afterwards found her safe, with all her sails standing. Jurah is fur∣nished with many rivulets and springs of ex∣cellent water, and the air is remarkably healthy; its salubrity being ascribed to the high situation, perpetually fanned by breezes. The natives are hale, strong, mostly of a black complexion, and long lived. One Gilouir Mackirain attained to the age of one hundred and fourscore: a wo∣man of the isle of Scarba lived sevenscore years, and here are several persons turned of one hundred. They are all Protestants, and have a church called Killcorn.</P>
<P>To the westward of Jurah lies the isle of Ila, from which it is separated by a narrow channel. Isla extends twenty-four miles in length from north to south, and eighteen in breadth. On the east side it is roughened with mountains and hills covered with heath: to the southward, the land is tolerably well cultivated. In some parts the inhabitants have found great plenty of limestone, and lead mines are worked in three
<PB N="504" REF="5230"/>
different places. The only harbour in Isla is at Lochdale, near the north end of the island. Here are several rivers and lakes well stored with trout, eels, and salmon. In the center is Loch Finlagan about three miles in circuit, with the little isle of that name in the middle. Here the great Macdonald, lord of the isles, once resided in all the pomp of royalty; but his palace and offices are now in ruins. Here he held his su∣preme court of judicature, consisting of fourteen judges, to which there was an appeal from all the lesser tribunals. Instead of a throne, Macdonald stood on a stone seven feet square, in which there was an impression made to receive his feet; here he was crowned and anointed by the bishop of Argyle and seven inferior priests, in presence of the chieftains, to whom he took a solemn oath, importing that he would maintain their rights and possessions, and do justice to all his vassals. There are several small forts built on the isles in fresh-water lakes, and divers caverns in different parts of the island, which have been used occa∣sionally as places of strength. The air of Isla is not so salubrious as that of Jurah, because it is more low and marshy: nevertheless the peo∣ple enjoy a good share of health: they are all Protestants and have a variety of churches and chapels. The property of the island is at pre∣sent vested in Campbell of Shawfield. On the coast of Ila are several small isles, such as Texa, Ouersa, and Nave; nay, the natives pretend that there is an island four miles in length about thirty leagues to the south-west of Ila. They say it was discovered by the master of an English ship, who found it a low flat, covered with long grass, and watered by a river, on each side of which he saw great heaps of fish bones. A great number of seals lay basking on the rocks, and the cliffs
<PB N="505" REF="5240"/>
were covered with sea-fowl. Finding many planks and boards which the sea had cast on the shore, he ordered his men to raise a pile about two stories, as a land-mark for mariners. After his departure, the inhabitants of Collonsay, in fair weather, discerned from the top of an emi∣nence an object which they supposed to be land, which, however, vanished by next winter, when in all probability the pile was blown down by a storm.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the northward of Isla, lies the island of Collonsa, comprehending Oronsay, from which it is separated only in time of flood. Oronsay is about four miles in circumference, a flat arable surface, producing corn and pasture, adorned with a church, chapel, and monastery, built by the celebrated Columba, to whom they are dedicated: on the altar of the church there was a crucifix decorated with precious stones, the most valuable of which are in possession of the laird of Macduffie, in the village of Raimused, who preserves them as reliques and specifics for all manner of diseases. On the south side of the church are the tombs of this gentleman and the cadets of his family, ornamented in the Gothic manner, with trophies and figures in sculpture: At the east and west sides of the church, stood two stone crosses, each twelve feet high; that on the west, of an entire stone fixed on a pedestal of three steps, with a tree engraved on one side, and a crucifix on the other; there is an inscription underneath, but so effaced by time, as to be no longer legible. On the north side of the church, we observe a small square surrounded with a wall two stories high, and within a lesser square with a wall one story. Three sides of it are adorned with small pillars vaulted above, and on two of these we see inscriptions, which the hand of time
<PB N="506" REF="5250"/>
has effaced. Without this square are several houses for the accommodation of the monks, with a garden at a small distance. The whole extent of Collonsa amounts to four miles in length and one in breadth. The inland part is mountainous, and the soil of that which is ara∣ble produces very scanty harvests; but the in∣habitants breed plenty of sheep, horses, and black cattle. The country is watered with some fresh∣water lakes; and here are seen several Danish forts, like those described in the other islands. The people are generally of a swarthy com∣plexion, and all Protestants. The chief church is Kilouran, which communicated its name to the principal village. In the sands adjoining to this place, some stone coffins were found filled with human bones. The island belongs to the duke of Argyle.</P>
<P>On the west side of Kintyre, lies the isle of Gigay, part of the sheriffdom of Argyle, stretch∣ing four miles in length and one in breadth, yielding good harvests of oats and barley, and excellent pasturage for cattle. It affords no wood of any kind, but abundance of the moss corkir, which dyes cloth of a crimson colour. Here, as in every other isle, there is a well, sup∣posed of great efficacy, exaggerated by the su∣perstition of the people. These are all Pro∣testants, and have a church called Kil-chattan, with an altar, and a great number of tomb-stones, among which is the monument of the Macneils, who possessed the greatest part of the island. At the distance of a quarter of a mile south from Gigay, lies the small islet Caray, about a mile in compass, affording a harbour for small vessels, good pasture, abundance of rabbits, and belonging to Macalaster of Lergy, a branch of the Macdonalds.</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="5260"/>
About six leagues to the south-west of Arran, the remarkable rock of Islesay rises out of the sea, in form of a sugar-loaf; the top, however, is plain, and large enough to contain a thousand men drawn up in battalia. In the midst of this plain there is a fresh-water lake, on the side of which stands a small tower three stories high, a stream of pure water gushes from the side of the rock, which lies altogether inaccessible, except on the west side, by a narrow stair cut out of the stone with great difficulty. Below the rock there is a place where the fishermen pitch their tents in the cod and ling season, and hard by there is good anchorage for their vessels. On the top we likewise find a chapel, and an ancient pavement. Islesay is, in the summer, covered with Solan geese, and other water fowl: it produces hogs, down, and fish, and belongs to the earl of Cassels. The little island Avon, about a mile in circumference, and affording a harbour on the north side, lies south of the mull of Kintyre.</P>
<P>The isle of Bute, extending ten miles in length, appears on the west side of Cowal, from whence it is separated by a narrow channel. Part of it is rocky and barren; but from the mid∣dle southwards, the ground is cultivated, and produces pease, oats, and barley. Here is a quarry of red stone, which the natives have used in building a fort and chapel in the neigh∣bourhood of Rothsay, which is a very ancient royal borough head town, of the shire of Bute and Arran, but very thinly peopled, and main∣tained chiefly by the herring-fishery, with the profits of which all the rents of this island are chiefly paid. On the north side of Rothsay we see the ruins of an ancient fort, with its draw∣bridge, chapel, and barracks. Here are like∣wise
<PB N="508" REF="5270"/>
the remains of some Danish towers, such as Dun-owle and Dun-allin. The natives are healthy and industrious, speak the Erse and the dia∣lect of the Lowlands indifferently, and profess the Protestant religion. The island is divided into two parishes, accommodated with four churches, and belongs chiefly to the earl of Bute, who possesses an elegant seat near Rothsay: but some parts are the property of Stuart of Estick, and Ballantine of Keams, whose houses are well-built and pleasantly situated. To the southward of Rothsay lie the two small islands of Cumbray, belonging to Montgomery of Skellmorly; on the larger is a chapel and a well, the water of which is believed to be a specific for certain distempers.</P>
<P>Between the isle of Bute and Kintyre, the island of Arran presents itself to the view, high and mountainous, affording good pasturage, and extending four and twenty miles from north to south, the breadth scarce amounting to seven. This island produces no timber, yet a few cop∣pices are seen in different places: here are se∣veral lochs and rivers stocked with salmon, and wells of medicinal virtue. The herbage on the hills maintain abundance of sheep and black cattle, with a considerable herd of deer reserved by the proprietor, duke Hamilton, for his own diversion: but as the island slopes every way towards the coast, and several vallies intervene among the mountains, part of the land is cul∣tivated and produces tolerable harvests. Here is plenty of game, though no person dares kill the heath-cock, without an express permission granted by the duke's steward. This island af∣fords fuller's earth, beautiful chrystals and other pebbles of various colours, which are used for seals and jewels. Arran is provided with several
<PB N="509" REF="5280"/>
creeks and bays for the convenience of anchor∣age; but the only good harbour is Lamlash, on the south-east end of the island, where cod and whiting are taken in great plenty. On different parts of the coast, we find caverns, which served as places of retreat in times of trouble; and various monuments of rude stone, formed in the Danish manner. On the sea-shore, near the vil∣lage of Druim-cruey, there is an eminence, about a thousand paces in compass, fenced with a stone wall, and formerly allowed as a sanctuary for men and cattle. On the west side of the bay of Brodick, stands the castle of that name, be∣longing to the duke, four stories high, provided with a tower, encompassed with a high wall and wet ditch, having a bastion on the north side, and an area capable of holding a battalion of soldiers. The duke's bailiff, or steward, resides in this castle, with full power, by deputation from his grace, to levy rents, grant leases, and hold courts of justice. The proprietor has ano∣ther castle on the north side of the island, at the head of Loch Kenistil, in which there is a har∣bour for small vessels. Among the curiosities of this isle, we must not omit mentioning the stone globe of St. Molingrus, who was chaplain to the great Macdonald. It is as large as a goose's egg, of a green colour, and globular shape, supposed to contain the inherent virtue of curing stitches, if applied to the part affected, and in war, to disconcert the enemy, if thrown into the midst of their army: for this reason Macdonald is said to have carried it with him in all his expeditions, which were always crowned with success. The keeping of this stone is the peculiar priviledge of a certain family, known by the name of Mackintosh. They preserve it carefully wrapped up in a double covering of
<PB N="510" REF="5290"/>
linen and woollen, and deposited under lock and key in the secret part of the house, except when it is produced to exercise its healing qua∣lity. The people of Arran are composed of different tribes; but the most ancient is that of Mac Louis, of French extraction, alias Ful∣lerton. The head of this family resides at Kirk∣michel, which is said to have been possessed by his ancestors above seven hundred years ago. He is, by charter from the duke of Hamilton, hereditary coroner of the island, and enjoys the perquisites of that office, which consist of a bushel of oats and a lamb from every village in the island. His business is to pursue and secure all malefactors, and to seize such tenants as refuse to pay their rents. In the execution of his of∣fice, he is attended by three men; but should these prove insufficient, he summons all the in∣habitants to his assistance, and they are obliged to rendezvous at the place where he fixes his coroner's staff. The natives of Arran are strong, healthy, and ingenious, profess the Protestant re∣ligion, speak the Erse and English languages, and have the convenience of several churches and chapels, round which they have built vil∣lages, the chief being Kilmichel.</P>
