<LETTER>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<OPENER>Cousin Pickle,</OPENER>
<P>I Hope you are in a better trim than your aunt'
who hath been fast moored to her bed these
seven weeks, by several feet of under-water log∣ging
in her hold and hollop, whereby I doubt her
planks are rotted, so as she cannot chuse but
fall to pieces in a short time. I have done all in
my power to keep her tight and easy, and free
from sudden squalls that might overstrain her.
And here have been the doctors, who have
skuttled her lower deck, and let out six gallons
water. For my own part, I wonder how the devil
it came there; for you know as how it was a li∣quor
she never took in. But as for those fellows
the doctors, they are like unskilful carpenters,
that in mending one leak, make a couple; and
to she fills again apace But the worst sign of all
is this here, she won't let a drop of Nantz go be∣twixt
the combings of her teeth, and has quite
lost the rudder of her understanding, whereby
she yaws woundily in her speech, palavering
about some foreign part called the New Geereu∣salem,
and wishing herself in a safe birth in the
river Geordun. The parson, I must say, strives
to keep her steady, concerning the navigation of
her soul, and talks very sensibly of charity and the
poor, whereof she hath left a legacy of two hun∣dred
pounds in her will. And here has been Mr.
Gamaliel and your brother my lord, demanding
entrance at the gate, in order to see her; but
I would not suffer them to come aboard, and
pointed my patereroes, which made them sheer
off. Your sister Mrs. Clover keeps close watch
upon her kinswoman, without ever turning in,
and a kind-hearted young woman it is. I should
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
be glad to see you at the garison, if the wind of
your inclination fits that way; and mayhap it
may be a comfort to your aunt, to behold you
along-side of her, when her anchor is apeak. So
no more at present, but rests</P>
<CLOSER>Your friend
And humble servant to command,
<SIGNED>Jno HATCHWAY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Next morning, after the receipt of this epistle,
Peregrine, in order to manifest his regard to his
aunt, as well as his friendship for honest Jack,
set out on horseback for their habitation, at∣tended
by Pipes, who longed to see his old mess∣mate;
but, before he reached the garison, Mrs.
Hatchway had given up the ghost, in the three-score
and fifth year of her age. The widower
seemed to bear his loss with resignation, and be∣haved
very decently upon the occasion, though
he did not undergo those dangerous transports of
sorrow, which some tender-hearted husbands have
selt at the departure of their yoke-fellows. The
lieutenant was naturally a philosopher, and so
well disposed to acquiesce in the dispensations of
providence, that in this, as well as in every other
emergency of his life, he firmly believed, that
every thing which happened was for the best.</P>
<P>Peregrine's task, therefore, was not so great in
comforting him, as in consoling his own sister,
who with great poignancy and sincerity of grief,
lamented the death of the only relation with
whom she had maintained any intimacy of cor∣respondence;
for her mother was as implacable as
ever, in her enmity against her and Peregrine,
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
and rather more determined in her rancour,
that which was originally a sudden transport of
indignation, being by this time settled into a
confirmed inveteracy of hate. As for Gam,
who was now dignified by the country-people
with the appellation of the young squire, he still
acted in the capacity of minister to the caprice
and vengeance of his mother, taking all oppor∣tunities
of disturbing Julia's peace, slandering her
reputation, and committing outrages against the
tenants and domestics of her husband, who was
a man of a quiet and timorous disposition.</P>
<P>But the chief amusement of young Pickle, in
his later years, was the chace, in which he ac∣quired
some renown by his intrepidity and re∣markable
figure, which improved every day in de∣formity;
insomuch, as to suggest a ludicrous
scheme of revenge to a gentleman in the neigh∣bourhood,
who having been affronted by the in∣solence
of Crookback, cloathed a large baboon
that was in his possession, in a dress that re∣sembled
the hunting-equipage of Gam; and or∣dering
the animal to be set astride, and tied upon
the back of his keenest hunter, turned them out
one day after the hounds; and the horse in a little
time outstripping all the rest in the field, the
rider was mistaken for Gam by the whole com∣pany,
who saluted him as he passed with a hol∣low,
observing, that the squire had his usual good
luck, in being better mounted than his neigh∣bours.
Pickle afterwards appearing in his own
person, created great astonishment in the specta∣tors,
one of whom asked if he had split himself
in twain, and pointed out his representative, who
was by this time almost up with the hounds:
upon which, the identical Gam went in pursuit
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
of the impostor; and when he overtook him was
so much enraged at the counterfeit, that he at∣tacked
the baboon whip in hand, and, in all pro∣bability,
would have sacrificed him to his resent∣ment,
had not he been prevented by the other
foxhunters, who interposed, in order to make up
the difference betwixt two brothers of the sport,
and were equally surprised and diverted, when
they distinguished the quality of Crookback's an∣tagonist,
which they rescued from his rage, and
reconveyed to its master.</P>
<P>Peregrine, at the request of his friend Jack,
took charge of his aunt's funeral, to which his
parents were invited, though they did not think
proper to appear, or pay the least regard to his
sollicitations, when he desired permission to wait
upon them in person. Nevertheless, old Gama∣liel,
at the instigation of his wife, afterwards ob∣tained
an order from Doctor's Commons, oblig∣ing
Hatchway to produce the will of his wife, on
the supposition that she had bequeathed to him
some part of the money which (she knew) was at
her own disposal. But from this step he reaped
no other satisfaction than that of finding himself
altogether neglected by the testatrix, who had
left all her effects to her husband, except one
thousand pounds, with her jewels, to Julia's
daughter, the benefaction mentioned in the lieu∣tenant's
letter, and some inconsiderable legacies
to her favourite domesticks.</P>
<P>A few days after the interment of this good
lady, our hero was agreeably surprised with a vi∣sit
from his friend Godfrey, who had come to
England in consequence of that promotion which
he owed to his interest, tho' the soldier himself
placed it to the credit of a certain courtier who
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
had formerly promised to befriend him, and now
finding his advancement unowned, very modest∣ly
arrogated the merit of it to himself. He com∣municated
his good fortune to Pickle, who com∣plimented
him upon it as an event of which he
had no precognition; and at the same time told
him, that, in consequence of his preferment, his
co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sin at Windsor had consented to his being im∣mediately
united in the bands of wedlock with his
lovely Sophy; that the wedding-day was already
fixed; and that nothing would be wanting to his
happiness, if Peregrine would honour the nup∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls
with his presence.</P>
<P>Our hero accepted the invitation with great
eagerness, when he learned that Emilia would be
there in quality of bride's maid; and now repeat∣ed
what he had formerly written to his friend,
namely, that he was not only willing, but ex∣tremely
impatient to attone for his mad behaviour
to that young lady, by laying himself and his
whole fortune at her feet. Godfrey thanked him
for his honourable intention, and promised to use
his influence, and that of Sophy, in his behalf,
tho' he seemed dubious of their success, on ac∣count
of his sister's delicacy, which could not
pardon the least shadow of disrespect. He owned,
indeed, he was not certain that she would appear
in the same company with Pickle; but as she had
made no stipulations on that score, he would in∣terpret
her silence in the most favourable man∣ner,
and keep her in ignorance of his design, un∣til
she should find it too late to retract with any
decency. The hope of seeing and conversing
with Emilia, and perhaps of being reconciled to
her, after having suffered so much and so long
from her displeasure, raised a tumult of ideas in
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
his breast, and produced a strange inquietude of
joy and perturbation. Gauntlet having stayed
with him a few days, and signified the time ap∣pointed
for his spousals, took his leave, in order
to prepare for the occasion; while Peregrine,
with his friend Hatchway, made a tour among his
acquaintance in the country, with a view of
founding their inclinations touching a project
which he had lately conceived, of offering him∣self
as a candidate for a certain borough in the
neighbourhood, at the ensuing election for mem∣bers
of parliament.</P>
<P>This scheme, which was suggested to him by
one of his quality patrons, would have succeeded
according to his wish, had the election taken
place immediately; but before that happened, his
interest was overbalanced by some small accidents
that will be recorded in the sequel. In the mean
time, he repaired to Windsor on the eve of his
friend's marriage, and understood from Godfrey,
that it was with the utmost difficulty he and So∣phy
could prevail upon his sister to be present at
the wedding, when she was informed that her
lover was invited, and that her consent had not
been obtained until they had promised, on the
part of Peregrine, that he should not renew the
old topic, nor even speak to her in the stile of a
former acquaintance.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman was nettled at this pre∣liminary,
to which, however, he said he would
adhere; and so well did he think himself fortified
with pride and resentment, that he resolved to
behave towards her with such indifference, as
would, he hoped, mortify her vanity, and there∣by
punish her for the implacability of her dispo∣sition.
Armed with these sentiments, he was
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
next day introduced by Godsrey to the bride,
who received him with her usual sweetness of
temper and affability; and Emilia being present,
he saluted her with a distant bow, which she ac∣knowledged
with a cold curt'sy, and an aspect of
ice. Tho' this deportment confirmed his dis∣pleasure,
her beauty undermined his resolution;
he thought her charms were infinitely improved
since their last parting, and a thousand fond ima∣ges
recurring to his imagination, he felt his whole
soul dissolving into tenderness and love.</P>
<P>In order to banish those dangerous ideas, he
endeavoured to enter into a gay conversation
with Sophy, on the subject of the approaching
ceremony; but his tongue performed its office
very aukwardly, his eyes were attracted towards
Emilia, as if they had been subject to the power
of fascination; in spite of all his efforts, a deep
sigh escaped from his bosom, and his whole ap∣pearance
indicated anxiety and confusion.</P>
<P>The bridegroom perceiving his condition,
abridged the visit, and having conducted his
companion to his own lodgings, expressed his
concern at having been the innocent occasion of
his uneasiness, by exposing him to the fight of
Emilia, which he perceived had given him pain.
Peregrine, who had by this time recollected the
dictates of his pride, assured him, that he was
very much mistaken in the cause of his disorder,
which was no other than a sudden qualm, to
which he had been for some time subject; and to
shew him how philosophically he could bear the
discain of Emilia, which, with all deference to
her conduct, he could not help thinking a little
too severe, he desired, as the bridegroom had
made preparations for a private ball in the even∣ing,
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
that he would provide him with an agree∣able
partner; in which case he would exhibit un∣doubted
proofs of the tranquillity of his heart. “I
was in hopes (answered Godfrey) of being able,
with the assistance of Sophy,” to make up matters
between you and my sister, and for that reason
kept her unengaged to any other gentleman for
the night; but since she is so peevishly obstinate,
I shall take care to accommodate you with a very
handsome young lady, whose partner will not be
sorry to exchange her for Emilia.</P>
<P>The thoughts of having an opportunity to co∣quet
with another woman, under the eye of this
implacable mistress, supported his spirits during
the ceremony which put Gauntlet in possession of
his heart's desire; and, by means of this cordial,
he found himself so undisturbed at dinner, tho'
he sat opposite to his fair enemy, that he was able
to pass some occasional jokes upon the new-married
couple, with some appearance of mirth
and good humour. Nor did Emily any other∣wise
seem affected by his presence, than by ex∣cepting
him from the participation of those geni∣al
regards which she distributed to the rest of the
company. This easiness of behaviour on her
side, reinforced his resolution, by giving him
pretence to call her sensibility in question; for he
could not conceive how any woman of acute
feelings could sit unmoved, in presence of a man
with whom she had such recent and intimate con∣nexion:
not considering, that she had much more
reason to condemn his affectation of unconcern,
and that her external deportment might, like his
own, be an effort of pride and resentment.</P>
<P>This contest, in point of dissimulation, conti∣nued
till night, when the company was paired
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
for dancing, and Peregrine began the ball by
walking a minuet with the bride; then he took
out the young lady to whom he was recommend∣ed
by Gauntlet, being very well pleased to see
that her person was such as might have inspired
even Emily herself with jealousy, though, at the
same time, he perceived his mistress coupled
with a gay young officer, whom (with all due
deference to his own qualifications) he considered
as no despicable rival. However, he himself first
began hostilities, by becoming all of a sudden
particular with his partner, whom he forthwith
assailed with flattering compliments, that soon
introduced the subject of love, upon which he
expatiated with great art and elocution, using not
only the faculty of speech, but also the language
of the eyes, in which he was a perfect con∣noisseur.</P>
<P>This behaviour soon manifested itself to the
whole assembly, the greatest part of whom be∣lieved
that he was in good earnest captivated by
the heart of his partner, while Emilia, penetrat∣ing
into his design, turned his own artillery upon
himself, by seeming to listen with pleasure to the
addresses of his rival, who was no novice in the
art of making love: she even affected uncommon
vivacity, and giggled aloud at every whisper
which he conveyed into her ear, insomuch that
she, in her turn, afforded speculation to the com∣pany,
who imagined the young soldier had made
a conquest of the bridegroom's sister.</P>
<P>Pickle himself began to cherish the same opi∣nion,
which gradually invaded his good humour,
and, at length, filled his bosom with rage. He
strove to suppress his indignation, and called
every consideration of vanity and revenge to his
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
aid: he endeavoured to wean his eyes from the
fatal object that disturbed him, but they would
not obey his direction and command; he wished
himself deprived of all sensation, when he heard
her laugh, and saw her smile upon the officer;
and, in the course of country-dancing, when he
was obliged to join hands with her, the touch
thrill'd thro' all his nerves, and kindled a flame
within him which he could not contain. In a
word, his endeavours to conceal the situation of
his thoughts, were so violent, that his constitu∣tion
could not endure the shock; the sweat ran
down his forehead in a stream, the colour va∣nished
from his cheeks, his knees began to totter,
and his eyesight to fail: so that he must have
fallen at his full length upon the floor, had not
he retired very abruptly into another room, where
he threw himself upon a couch, and fainted.</P>
<P>In this condition he was found by his friend,
who seeing him withdraw with such symptoms of
disorder, followed him thither; and when he re∣covered
the use of his faculties, pressed him to
make use of a bed in that house, rather than ex∣pose
himself to the night air, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> home to
his own lodgings: but not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prevail
upon him to accept the offer, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im
up in a cloak, and conducting him to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
where he lodged, helped him to undres <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to bed, where he was immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a
violent fit of the ague. Godfrey beh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved with
great tenderness, and would have actually <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore
him company all night, notwithstanding the cir∣cumstances
of his own situation, had not his
friend insisted upon his returning to the company,
and making his apology to his partner for his sud∣den
departure.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18"/>
This was a step absolutely necessary towards
maintaining the quiet of the assembly, which he
found in great consternation, occasioned by his
absence; for some of the ladies seeing the bride∣groom
follow the stranger in his retreat, the
meaning of which they did not comprehend, be∣gan
to be afraid of a quarrel; and Emilia, upon
pretence of that supposition, was so much alarm∣ed,
that she could not stand, and was fain to
have recourse to a smelling bottle.</P>
<P>The bride, who understood the whole my∣stery,
was the only person that acted with deli∣beration
and composure; she imputed Emilia's
disorder to the right cause, which was no other
than concern for the condition of her lover, and
assured the ladies there was nothing extraordinary
in Mr. Pickle's going off, he being subject to
fainting fits, by which he was often overtaken
without any previous notice. The arrival of
Gauntlet confirmed the truth of this declaration;
he made an apology to the company, in the name
of his friend, who, he told them, was suddenly
taken ill; and they returned to their diversion of
dancing, with this variation: Emilia was so dis∣ordered
and fatigued, that she begged to be ex∣cused
from continuing the exercise; and Pere∣grine's
partner being disengaged, was paired with
the young officer for whom she was originally
designed.</P>
<P>Mean while, the bride withdrew into another
apartment, with her sister, and expostulated with
her upon her cruelty to Mr. Pickle, assuring her,
from Godfrey's information, that he had under∣gone
a severe fit on her account, which, in all
likelihood, would have a dangerous effect upon
his constitution. Tho' Emily was inflexible in
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
her answers to the kind remonstrances of the
gentle Sophy, her heart was melting with the
impressions of pity and love; and finding herself
unable to perform the duty of her function, in
putting the bride to bed, she retired to her own
chamber, and, in secret, sympathized with the
distemper of her lover.</P>
<P>In the morning, as early as decency would
permit him to leave the arms of his dear wife,
captain Gauntlet made a visit to Peregrine, who
had passed a very tedious and uneasy night, hav∣ing
been subject to short intervals of delirium,
during which Pipes had found it very difficult to
keep him fast belayed. He owned indeed to
Godfrey, that his imagination had been haunted
by the ideas of Emilia and her officer, which tor∣mented
him to an unspeakable degree of anguish
and distraction; and that he would rather suffer
death than a repetition of such excruciating re∣flections.
He was, however, comforted by his
friend, who assured him, that his sister's inclina∣tions
would, in time, prevail over all the endea∣vours
of resentment and pride, illustrating this
asseveration by an account of the manner in which
she was affected by the knowledge of his disorder,
and advising him to implore the mediation of So∣phy,
in a letter which she should communicate
to Emilia.</P>
<P>This was an opportunity which our hero
thought too favourable to be neglected; and
therefore calling for paper, he sat up in his bed,
and, in the first transports of his emotion, wrote
the following petition to Godfrey's amiable
wife.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE affliction of a contrite heart can never
appeal to your benevolence in vain; and
therefore I presume to approach you, in this sea∣son
of delight, with the language of sorrow, re∣questing
that you will espouse the cause of an un∣happy
lover, who mourns with unutterable an∣guish
over his ruined hope, and interceed for my
pardon with that divine creature, whom, in the
intemperance and excess of passion, I have so mor∣tally
offended. Good heaven! is my guilt in∣expiable?
Am I excluded from all hope of re∣mission?
Am I devoted to misery and despair?
I have offered all the atonement which the most
perfect and sincere penitence could suggest, and
she rejects my humility and repentance. If her
resentment would pursue me to the grave, let her
signify her pleasure; and may I be branded with
the name of villain, and remembered with in∣famy
and detestation to all posterity, if I hesitate
one moment in sacrificing a life which is odious
to Emilia. Ah! madam, while I thus pour forth
the effusions of my grief and distraction, I look
around the apartment in which I lie, and every
well-known object that salutes my view, recals
to my remembrance that fond, that happy day,
on which the fair, the good, the tender hearted
Sophy became my advocate, though I was a
stranger to her acquaintance, and effected a
transporting reconciliation between me and
that same inchanting beauty, that is now so
implacably incensed. If she is not satisfied
with the pangs of remorse and disappointment,
the transports of m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dness I have undergone; let
her prescribe what farther penance she thinks I
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
ought to endure; and when I decline her sen∣tence,
let me be the object of her eternal disdain.</P>
<P>I commit myself, dear madam! dear Sophy!
dear partner of my friend! to your kind inter∣position.
I know you will manage my cause, as
a concern on which my happiness intirely de∣pends;
and I hope every thing from your com∣passion
and benefience, while I fear every thing
from her rigour and barbarity. Yes! I call it
barbarity, a savageness of delicacy altogether in∣consistent
with the tenderness of human nature;
and may the most abject contempt be my por∣tion,
if I live under its infliction! But I begin
to rave. I conjure you by your own humanity
and sweetness of disposition, I conjure you by
your love for the man whom heaven hath de∣creed
your protector, to employ your influence
with that angel of wrath, in behalf of</P>
<CLOSER>Your obliged and
Obedient servant,
<SIGNED>P. PICKLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This epistle was immediately transmitted by
Godfrey to his wife, who perused it with marks
of the most humane sympathy; and carrying it
into her sister's chamber, “Here is something
(said she, presenting the paper) which I must re∣commend
to your serious attention.” Emilia,
who immediately guessed the meaning of this ad∣dress,
absolutely refused to look upon it, or even
to hear it read, till her brother entering the apart∣ment,
reprimanded her sharply for her obstinacy
and pride, accused her of soily and dissimulation,
and entered so warmly into the interests of his
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
friend, that she thought him unkind in his re∣monstrances,
and bursting into a flood of tears,
reproached him with partiality and want of af∣fection.
Godfrey, who entertained the most
perfect love and veneration for his sister, asked
pardon for having given offence, and kissing the
drops from her fair eyes, begg'd she would, for
his sake, listen to the declaration of his friend.</P>
<P>Thus sollicited, she could not refuse to hear
the letter, which when he had repeated, she la∣mented
her own fate, in being the occasion of so
much uneasiness, desired her brother to assure Mr.
Pickle, that she was not a voluntary enemy to
his peace; on the contrary, she wished him all
happiness, tho' she hoped he would not blame
her for consulting her own, in avoiding any fu∣ture
explanation or connexion with a person
whose correspondence she found herself under a
necessity to renounce.</P>
<P>In vain did the new-married couple exhaust
their eloquence in attempting to prove, that the
reparation which our hero had offered was ade∣quate
to the injury she had sustained; that in re∣conciling
herself to a penitent lover, who sub∣scribed
to her own terms of submission, her ho∣nour
would be acquitted by the most scrupulous
and severe judges of decorum; and that her in∣flexibility
would be justly ascribed to the pride
and insensibility of her heart. She turned a deaf
ear to all their arguments, exhortations and in∣treaties,
and threatened to leave the house im∣mediately,
if they would not promise to drop that
subject of discourse.</P>
<P>Godfrey, very much chagrined at the bad suc∣cess
of his endeavours, returned to his friend, and
made as favourable a report of the affair, as the
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
nature of his conversation with Emilia would
permit; but as he could not avoid mentioning
her resolution in the close, Peregrine was obliged
to drink again the bitter draught of disappoint∣ment,
which put his passions into such a state of
agitation, as produced a short extasy of despair,
in which he acted a thousand extravagancies.
This paroxysm, however, soon subsided into a
settled reserve of gloomy resentment, which he
in secret indulged, detaching himself as soon as
possible from the company of the soldier, on pre∣tence
of retiring to rest.</P>
<P>While he lay ruminating upon the circum∣stances
of his present situation, his friend Pipes,
who knew the cause of his anxiety, and firmly
believed that Emilia loved his master in her heart,
howsoever she might attempt to disguise her sen∣timents;
I say, Thomas w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s taken with a con∣ceit
which he thought would set every thing to
rights, and therefore put it in execution, without
farther delay. Laying aside his hat, he ran di∣rectly
to the house of Sophy's father, and affect∣ing
an air of surprize and consternation, to which
he had never before been subject, thundered at
the door with such an alarming knock, as in a
moment brought the whole family into the hall.
When he was admitted, he began to gape, stare,
and pant at the same time, and made no reply,
when Godfrey asked what was the matter, till
Mrs. Gauntlet expressed her apprehensions about
his master; at whose name being mentioned, he
seemed to make an effort to speak, and in a bel∣lowing
tone pronounced “Brought himself up,
split my top-fails!” So saying, he pointed to his
own neck, and rose upon his tiptoes, by way of
explaining the meaning of his words.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="24"/>
Godfrey, without staying to ask another que∣stion,
rushed out, and flew towards the inn, with
the utmost horror and concern; while Sophy,
who did not rightly understand the language of
the messenger, addressing herself to him a second
time, said with great earnestness, “I hope no
accident has happened to Mr. Pickle!” “No
accident at all, (replied Tom) he has only hanged
himself for love.” These words had scarce pro∣ceeded
from his mouth, when Emilia, who stood
listening at the parlour-door, shrieked aloud,
and dropped down senseless upon the floor; while
her sister, who was almost equally shocked at the
intelligence, had recourse to the assistance of her
maid, by whom she was supported from falling.</P>
<P>Pipes hearing Emily's voice, congratulated
himself upon the success of his stratagem, he
sprung to her assistance, and lifting her up into an
easy chair, stood by her, until he saw her re∣cover
from her swoon, and heard her call upon
his master's name, with all the frenzy of despair∣ing
love. Then he bent his course back to the
inn, overjoyed at the opportunity of telling Pe∣regrine
what a confession he had extorted from
his mistress, and extremely vain of this proof of
his own fagacity.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Godfrey arriving at the
house, in which he supposed this fatal catastrophe
had happened, ran up stairs to Peregrine's cham∣ber,
without staying to make any inquiry below;
and finding the door locked, burst it open with
one stroke of his foot. But, what was his amaze∣ment,
when, upon entrance, our hero starting
up from the bed, saluted him with a boisterous
exclamation of “Z—ds! who's there?” He
was struck dumb with astonishment, which also
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
rivetted him to the place where he stood, scarce
crediting the testimony of his own senses, 'till
Peregrine, with an air of discontent which de∣noted
him displeased with his intrusion, dispelled
his apprehension by a second address, saying, “I
see you consider me as a friend, by your using me
without ceremony.”</P>
<P>The soldier, thus convinced of the falsehood of
the information he had received, began to ima∣gine,
that Pickle had projected the plan which
was executed by his servant; and looking upon it
as a piece of unjustifiable sinesse, which might be
attended with very melancholy consequences to
his sister or wife, he answered in a supercilious
tone, that he must blame himself for the inter∣ruption
of his repose, which was intirely owing
to the sorry jest he had set on foot.</P>
<P>Pickle, who was the child of passion, and
more than half mad with impatience before this
visit, hearing himself treated in such a cavalier
manner, advanced close up to Godfrey's breast,
and assuming a stern, or rather frantic counte∣nance,
“Heark ye, Sir, (said he) you are mi∣staken
if you think I jest; I am in downright
earnest I assure you.” Gauntlet, who was not a
man to be brow beaten, seeing himself thus
bearded by a person of whose conduct he had, he
thought, reason to complain, put on his military
look of defiance, and erecting his chest, replied
with an exalted voice, “Mr. Pickle, whether
you was in jest or earnest, you must give me
leave to tell you, that the scheme was childish,
unseasonable, and unkind, not to give it an
ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sher term.” “Death, Sir, (cried our ad∣venturer)
you trifle with my disquiet: if there is
any meaning in your insinuation, explain your∣self,
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
and then I shall know what answer it will be∣fit
me to give.” “I came with very different
sentiments, (resumed the soldier) but since you
urge me to expostulation, and behave with such
unprovoked lostiness of displeasure, I will, with∣out
circumlocution, tax you with having com∣mitted
an outrage upon the peace of my family,
in sending your fellow to alarm us with such an
abrupt account of your having done violence upon
yourself.” Peregrine, confounded at this imputa∣tion,
stood silent, with a most savage aspect of
surprize, eager to know the circumstance to
which his accuser alluded, and incensed to find it
without the sphere of his comprehension.</P>
<P>While these two irritated friends stood fronting
each other with mutual undignation in their eyes
and attitudes, they were joi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d by Pipes, who
without taking the least notice of the situation
in which he found them, told his master, that he
might up with the top-gallant-masts of his heart,
and out with his rejoicing pendants; for as to mi∣stress
Emily, he had clapt her helm a-weather,
the vessel wore, and now she was upon the other
tack, standing right into the harbour of his good
will.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was not yet a connoisseur in
the terms of his lacquey, commanded him, upon
pain of his displeasure, to be more explicit in his
intelligence; and by dint of divers questions, ob∣tained
a perfect knowledge of the scheme which
he had put in execution for his service. This in∣formation
perplexed him not a little; he would
have chastised his servant upon the spot, for his
temerity, had not he plainly perceived, that the
fellow's intention was to promote his ease and
satisfaction: and on the other hand, he knew not
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
how to acquit himself of the suspicion which he
saw Godfrey entertain of his being the projector
of the plan, without condescending to an explana∣tion,
which his present disposition could not brook.
After some pause, however, turning to Pipes, with a
severe frown, “Rascal! (said he) this is the se∣cond
time I have suffered in the opinion of that lady
by yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r ignorance and presumption; if ever you
inter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dle in my affairs for the future, without
express order and direction, by all that's sacred!
I will put you to death without mercy. Away,
and let my horse be saddled this instant.”</P>
<P>Pipes having withdrawn, in order to perform
this piece of duty, our young gentleman, ad∣dressing
himself again to the soldier, and laying
his hand upon his breast, said with a solemnity of
regard, “Captain Gauntlet, upon my honour,
I am altogether innocent of that shallow device
which you impute to my invention; and I don't
think you do justice either to my intellects or ho∣nour,
in supposing me capable of such insolent
absurdity. As for your sister, I have once in my
life affronted her in the madness and impetuosity
of desire; but I have made such acknowledge∣ments,
and offered such atonement, as few wo∣men
of her sphere would have refused; and be∣fore
God! I am determined to endure every tor∣ment
of disappointment and despair, rather than
prostrate myself again to the cruelty of her un∣justifiable
pride.” So saying, he stalked suddenly
down stairs, and took horse immediately, his spi∣rits
being supported by resentment, which prompt∣ed
him to vow within himself, that he would seek
consolation for the disdain of Emilia, in the pos∣session
of the first willing wench he should meet
upon the road.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="28"/>
While he set out for the garison with these sen∣timents,
Gauntlet, in a suspence between anger,
shame and concern, returned to the house of his
father-in-law, where he found his sister still vio∣lently
agitated from the news of Peregrine's death,
the mystery of which he forthwith unravelled,
recounting at the same time the particulars of the
conversation which had happened at the inn, and
describing the demeanour of Pickle with some
expressions of asperity, which were neither agree∣able
to Emilia, nor approved by the gentle So∣phy,
who tenderly chid him, for allowing Pere∣grine
to depart in terms of misunderstanding.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine sets out for the garison, and meets with
a nymph of the read, whom be takes into keeping,
and metamorphoses into a fine laay.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, our hero jogged along in a
profound reverie, which was disturbed by a
beggar-woman and her daughter, who solicited him
for alms, as he passed them on the road. The girl
was about the age of sixteen, and notwithstanding
the wretched equipage in which she appeared, ex∣hibited
to his view a set of agreeable features, en∣livened
with the complexion of health and chear∣fulness.
The resolution I have already mentioned
was still warm in his imagination; and he looked
upon this young mendicant as a very proper ob∣ject
for the performance of his vow. He there∣fore
entered into a conference with the mother,
and for a small sum of money purchased her pro∣perty
in the wench, who did not require much
courtship and intreaty, before she consented to
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
accompany him to any place that he should ap∣point
for her habitation.</P>
<P>This contract being settled to his satisfaction,
he ordered Pipes to seat his acquisition behind
him upon the crupper, and alighting at the first
public house which they found upon the road,
he wrote a letter to Hatchway, desiring him to
receive this hedge-inamorata, and direct her to
be cleaned and cloathed in a decent manner,
with all expedition, so that she should be touch∣able
upon his arrival, which (on that account)
he would defer for the space of one day. This
billet, together with the girl, he committed to
the charge of Pipes, after having laid strong in∣junctions
upon him to abstain from all attempts
upon her chastity, and ordered him to make the
best of his way to the garison, while he himself
crossed the country to a market-town, where he
proposed to spend the night.</P>
<P>Tom thus cautioned, proceeded with his
charge, and being naturally taciturn, opened not
his lips, until he had performed the best half of
his journey. But Thomas, notwithstanding his
irony appearance, was in reality composed of
flesh and blood; and his desire being titillated by
the contact of a buxome wench, whose right arm
embraced his middle as he rode, his thoughts be∣gan
to mutiny against his master, and he found
it almost impossible to withstand the temptation
of making love.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, he wrestled with these rebellious
suggestions with all the reason that God had en∣abled
him to exert; and that being totally over∣come,
his victorious passion suddenly broke out
in this address. “'Sblood! a believe master
thinks I have no more stuff in my body than a
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
dried haddock, to turn me adrift in the dark
with such a spanker. D'ye think he don't, my
dear?” To this question his fellow-traveller re∣plied,
“Swanker! Anan!” And the lover re∣sumed
his suit, saying, “Oons! how you tickle
my timbers! Something shoots from your arm,
through my stowage, to the very keel-stone.
Han't you got quick-silver in your hand?”
“Quicksilver! (said the lady) D—n the silver
that has crossed my hand this month. D'ye
think if I had silver, I shouldn't buy me a smock?”
“ Add<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ooks! ye baggage, (cried the lover) you
shouldn't want a smock nor a petticoat neither,
if you could have a kindness for a true-hearted
sailor, as found and strong as a nine inch cable,
that would keep all clear above-board, and every
thing snug under the hatches,” “Curse your
gum (said the charmer) what's your gay balis
and your hatchets to me?” “ Do but let us
bring to a little, (answered the woer, whose
appetite was by this time whetted to a most ra∣venous
degree) and I'll teach you to box the
compass, my dear. Ah! you strapper, what a
jolly bitch you are!” “Bitch! (exclaimed this
modern Dulcinea, incensed at the opprobrious
term) such a bitch as your mother, you dog.
D—n ye, I've a good mind to box your jaws
instead of your comepiss. I'll let you know
as how I am meat for your master, you saucy
blackguard. You are worse than a dog, you old
flinty-faced, flea-bitten scrub: a dog wears his
own coat, but you wear your master's.”</P>
<P>Such a torrent of disgraceful epithets from a
person who had no cloaths at all, converted the
gallant's love into choler, and he threatened to
dismount and seize her to a tree, when she should
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
have a taste of his cat and nine tails athwart her
quarters; but, instead of being intimidated by
his menaces, she set him at defiance, and held
forth with such a flow of eloquence, as would
have intitled her to a considerable share of reputa∣tion,
even among the nymphs of Billingsgate;
for this young lady, over and above a natural ge∣nius
for altercation, had her talents cultivated
among the venerable society of weeders, podders,
and hoppers, with whom she had associated from
her t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder years. No wonder then, that she
soon obtained a compleat victory over Pipes,
who (as the reader may have observed) was very
little addicted to the exercise of speech: indeed
he was utterly disconcerted by her volubili<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of
tongue; and being altogether unfurnished with
answers to the distinct periods of her discourse,
very wisely chose to save himself the expence of
breath and argument, by giving her a full swing
of cable, so that she might bring herself up;
while he rode onwards, in silent composure,
without taking any farther notice of his fair fel∣low-traveller
than if she had been his master's
cloak-bag.</P>
<P>In spite of all the dispatch he could make, it
was late before he arrived at the garison, where
he delivered the letter and the lady to the lieute∣nant,
who no sooner understood the intention of
his friend, than he ordered all the tubs in the
house to be carried into the hall, and filled with
water; and Tom having provided himself with
swabs and brushes, divested the fair stranger of
her variegated drapery, which was immediately
committed to the flames, and performed up<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n her
soft and sleek person the ceremony of scrubbing,
as it is practised on board of the king's ships of
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
war. Yet the nymph herself did not submit to
this purification without repining: she curs'd the
director, who was upon the spot, with many
abusive allusions to his wooden leg: and as for
Pipes the operator, she employed her talons so
effectually upon his face, that the blood ran over
his nose in sundry streams; and next morning,
when those rivulets were dry, his countenance re∣sembled
the rough bark of a plumb-tree, plaster∣ed
with gum. Nevertheless, he did his duty with
great perseverance, cut off her hair close to the
scalp, handled his brushes with dexterity, ap∣plied
his swabs of different magnitude and texture,
as the case required, and lastly, rinsed her whole
body with a dozen pails of cold water, discharged
upon her head.</P>
<P>These ablutions being executed, he dried her
with towels, accommodated her with a clean
shift, and acting the part of a valet de chambre,
cloathed her from head to foot, in clean and de∣cent
apparel which had belonged to Mrs. Hatch∣way;
by which means her appearance was al∣tered
so much for the better, that when Peregrine
arrived next day, he would scarce believe his own
eyes. He was, for that reason, extremely well
pleased with his purchase, and now resolved to
indulge a whim which seized him at the very in∣stant
of his arrival.</P>
<P>He had (as I believe the reader will readily al∣low)
made considerable progress in the study of
character, from the highest rank to the most
humble station of life, and found it diversified in
the same manner, thro' every degree of subordi∣nation
and precedency: nay, he moreover ob∣served,
that the conversation of those who are
dignin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with the appellation of polite company,
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
is neither more edifying nor entertaining than
that which is met with among the lower classes
of mankind; and that the only essential difference
in point of demeanor, is the form of an education,
which the meanest capacity can acquire, without
much study or application. Possessed of this no∣tion,
he determined to take the young mendicant
under his own tutorage and instruction. In con∣sequence
of which he hoped he should, in a few
weeks, be able to produce her in company, as an
accomplished young lady of uncommon wit, and
an excellent understanding.</P>
<P>This extravagant plan he forthwith began to
execute with great eagerness and industry; and
his endeavours succeeded even beyond his ex∣pectation.
The obstacle, in surmounting of
which he found the greatest difficulty, was an in∣veterate
habit of swearing, which had been in∣dulged
from her infancy, and confirmed by the
example of those among whom she had lived.
However, she had the rudiments of good sense
from nature, which taught her to listen to whol∣some
advice, and was so docile as to comprehend
and retain the lessons which her governor recom∣mended
to her attention; insomuch, that he ven∣tured,
in a few days, to present her at table,
among a set of country squires, to whom she was
introduced as a niece of the lieutenant. In that
capacity she sat with becoming easiness of mien
(for she was as void of the <HI>mauvaise honte</HI> as any
dutchess in the land) bowed very graciously to
the compliments of the gentlemen; and tho' she
said little or nothing, because she was previously
cautioned on that score, she more than once gave
way to laughter, and her mirth happened to be
pretty well timed. In a word, she attracted the
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
applause and admiration of the guests, who, after
she was withdrawn, complimented Mr. Hatch∣way
upon the beauty, breeding and good hu∣mour
of his kinswoman.</P>
<P>But what contributed more than any other cir∣cumstance
to her speedy improvement, was some
small insight into the primer, which she had ac∣quired
at a day-school, during the life of her fa∣ther,
who was a day-labourer in the country.
Upon this foundation did Peregrine build a most
elegant superstructure; he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulled out choice sen∣tences
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom Shakespear, Otway, and Pope, and
taught her to repeat them with emphasis and
theatrical cadence: he then instructed her in the
names and epithets of the most celebrated players,
which he directed her to pronounce occasionally,
with an air of careless familiarity; and perceiv∣ing
that her voice was naturally clear, he en∣riched
it with remnants of opera tunes, to be
hummed during a pause in conversation, which
is generally supplied with the circulation of a
pinch of snuff. By means of this cultivation, she
became a wonderful proficient in the polite
graces of the age; she, with great facility, com∣prehended
the scheme of whist, tho' cribbidge
was her favourite game, with which she had
amused herself in her vacant hours, from her first
entrance into the profession of hopping; and brag
soon g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w familiar to her practice and concep∣tion.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, she was exposed to the com∣pany
of her own sex, being first of all visited by
the parson's daughter, who could not avoid shew∣ing
that civility to Mr. Hatchway's niece, after
she had made her public appearance at church.
Mrs. Clover, who had a great share of penetra∣tion,
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
could not help entertaining some doubts
about this same relation, whose name she had
never heard the▪ uncle mention, during the whole
term of her residence at the garison; but as the
young lady was treated in that character, she
would not refuse her acquaintance, and after
having seen her at the castle, actually invited
Miss Hatchway to her house. In short, she made
a progress thro' almost all the families in the
neighbourhood; and, by dint of her quotations,
(which, by the bye, were not always judiciously
used) she passed for a sprightly young lady, of
uncommon learning and taste.</P>
<P>Peregrine having, in this manner, initiated her
in the beau monde of the country, conducted her
to London, where she was provided with private
lodgings and a female attendant; and put her
immediately under the tuition of his v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>let de
chambre, who had orders to instruct her in danc∣ing
and the French language. He attended her
to plays and concerts, three or four times a
week; and when our hero thought her sufficient∣ly
accustomed to the sight of great company, he
squired her in person to a public assembly, and
danced with her among all the gay ladies of
fashion: not but that there was still an evident
air of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usticity and aukwardness in her demea∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
which was interpreted into an agreeable
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dness of spirit, superior to the forms of com∣mon
breeding. He afterwards found means to
make her acquainted with some distinguished
patterns of her own sex, by whom she was ad∣mitted
into their most elegant parties, and conti∣nued
to make good her pretensions to gentility,
with great circumspection, till one evening, being
at cards with a certain lady, whom she detected
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
in the very fact of unfair conveyance, she taxed
her roundly with the fraud, and brought upon
herself such a torrent of sarcastic reproof, as over-bore
all her maxims of caution, and burst open
the floodgates of her own natural repartee,
twanged off with the appellations of b—and
w—, which she repeated with great vehe∣mence,
in an attitude of manual defiance, to the
terror of her antagonist, and the astonishment of
all present: nay, to such an unguarded pitch
was she provoked, that starting up, she snapt
her fingers, in testimony of disdain, and, as she
quitted the room, applied her hand to that part
which was the last of her that disappeared, invit∣ing
the company to kiss it, by one of its coarsest
denominations.</P>
<P>Peregrine was a little disconcerted at this over-sight
in her behaviour, which, by the daemon of
intelligence, was in a moment conveyed to all
the private companies in town; so that she was
absolutely excluded from all polite communica∣tion,
and Peregrine, for the present, disgraced
among the modest part of his female acquaint∣ance,
many of whom not only forbad him their
houses, on account of the impudent insult he had
committed upon their honour as well as under∣standing,
in palming a common trull upon them,
as a young lady of birth and education, but also
aspersed his family, by affirming that she was ac∣tually
his own cousin-german, whom he had
precipitately raised from the most abject state of
humility and contempt. In revenge for this ca∣lumny,
our young gentleman explained the
whole mystery of her promotion, together with
the motives that induced him to bring her into the
fashionable world; and repeated among his com∣panions,
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
the extravagant encomiums which had
been bestowed upon her by the most discerning
matrons of the age.</P>
<P>Mean while, the insanta herself being rebuked
by her benefactor, for this instance of misbeha∣viour,
promised faithfully to keep a stricter guard
for the future over her conduct, and applied her∣self
with great assiduity to the studies, in which
she was assisted by the Swiss, who gradually lost
the freedom of his heart, while she was profiting
by his instruction. In other words, she made a
conquest of her preceptor, who yielding to the
instigations of the flesh, chose a proper opportu∣nity
to declare his passion, which was powerfully
recommended by his personal qualifications; and
his intentions being honourable, she listened to
his proposals of espousing her in private. In
consequence of this agreement, they made an
elopement together; and being buckled at the
fleet, consummated their nuptials in private lodg∣ings,
by the Seven Dials, from which the hus∣band
next morning sent a letter to our hero, beg∣ging
forgiveness for the clandestine step he had
taken, which he solemnly protested was not ow∣ing
to any abatement in his inviolable regard for
his master, whom he should always honour and
esteem to his latest breath, but intirely to the ir∣resistible
charms of the young lady, to whom he
was now so happy as to be joined in the silken
bonds of marriage.</P>
<P>Peregrine, tho' at first offended at his valet's
presumption, was, upon second thoughts, recon∣ciled
to the event by which he was delivered
from an incumbrance; for by this time he had
performed his frolick, and begun to be tired of
his acquisition. He reflected on the former fide∣lity
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
of the Swiss, which had been manifested in a
long course of service and attachment; and think∣ing
it would be cruelly severe to abandon him to
poverty and distress for one venial trespass, he
resolved to pardon what he had done, and enable
him in some shape to provide for the family
which he had intailed upon himself.</P>
<P>With these sentiments, he sent a favourable
answer to the delinquent, desiring to see him as
soon as his passion would permit him to leave the
arms of his spouse, for an hour or two; and
Hadgi, in obedience to this intimation, repaired
immediately to the lodgings of his master, before
whom he appeared with a most penitential aspect.
Peregrine, tho' he could scarce help laughing at
his rueful length of face, reprimanded him sharp∣ly
for his disrespect and ingratitude, in taking that
by stealth which he might have had for asking;
and the culprit assured him, that next to the ven∣geance
of God, his displeasure was that which,
of all evils, he dreaded to incu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but that love
had distracted his train in such a manner, as to
banish every other consideration but that of grati∣fying
his desire; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e owned, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould
not have been able to preserve his fidelity and
duty to his own father, had they interfered with
the interest of his passion. He th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n appealed to
his master's own heart for the remission of his
guilt, alluding to certain circumstances of our
hero's conduct, which evinced the desperate ef∣fects
of love. In short, he m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>logy
as extorted a smile from his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> judge, who
not only forgave his transgression, but also pro∣mised
to put him in some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> way of earning a
comfortable subsistence.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="39"/>
The Swiss was so much affected with this in∣stance
of generosity, that he fell upon his knees,
and kissed his hand, praying to heaven, with
great f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vour, to make him worthy of such good∣ness
and cond<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsion. His scheme, he said, was
to open a c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehouse and tavern in some credit∣able
part of the town, in hopes of being favour∣ed
with the custom of a numerous acquaintance
he had made among upper servants and reputable
tradesmen, not doubting that his wife would be
an ornament to his bar, and a careful manager of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> affairs. Peregrine approved of the plan, to∣wards
the execution of which he made him and
his wife a present of five hundred pounds, toge∣ther
with a promise of erecting a weekly club
among his friends, for the reputation and advan∣tage
of the house.</P>
<P>Hadgi was so transported with his good fortune,
that he ran to Pipes, who was in the room, and
having hugged him with great cordiality, and
made his obeisance to his master, hied him home
to his yokefellow, to communicate his happiness,
cutting capers, and talking to himself all the
way.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is visited by Pallet; contract, an intimacy with
a New-market nobleman; and is by the knowing∣ones
taken in.</HEAD>
<P>THIS affair being settled, and our adventu∣rer,
for the present, free of all female con∣nexions,
he returned to his former course of fast
wing, among the bucks of the town, and per∣formed
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
innumerable exploits among whores, bul∣lies,
rooks, constables, and justices of the peace.</P>
<P>In the midst of these occupations, he was one
morning visited by his old fellow-traveller Pallet,
whose appearance gave him equal surprize and
concern. Tho' the weather was severe, he was
cloathed in the thin summer-dress which he had
wore at Paris, and was now not only threadbare,
but in some parts actually patched; his stockings,
by a repetition of that practice known among
oeconomists by the term of <HI>coaxing,</HI> hung like
pudding-bags about his ankles; his shirt, tho'
new-wash'd, was of the saffron hue, and in di∣vers
places appeared through the crannies of his
breeches; he had exchanged his own hair for a
smoke-dry'd tye-periwig, which all the flour in
his drudging-box had not been able to whiten;
his eyes were sunk, his jaws lengthened beyond
their usual extension; and he seemed twenty
years older than he looked when he and our hero
parted at Rotterdam.</P>
<P>In spite of all these evidences of decay, he ac∣costed
him with a meagre affectation of content
and good humour, struggled piteously to appear
gay and unconcerned, professed his joy at seeing
him in England, excused himself for having de∣layed
so long to come and present his respects;
alledging, that since his return he had been a
meer slave to the satisfaction of some persons of
quality and taste, who had insisted upon his
finishing some pieces with the utmost expedi∣tion.</P>
<P>Peregrine received him with that compassion
and complaisance which was natural to his dis∣position,
inquired about the healths of Mrs. Pal∣let
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
and his family, and asked if his friend the
doctor was in town. The painter seemed to have
resumed his resentment against that gentleman,
of whom he spoke in contemptuous terms. “The
doctor (said he) is so much overshadowed with
presumption and self-conceit, that his merit has
no relief. It does not rise. There is no keeping
in the picture, my dear Sir. All the same as if I
were to represent the moon under a cloud;
there would be nothing but a deep mass of
shade, with a little tiny speck of light in the
middle, which would only serve to make, as it
were, the darkness visible. You understand me.
Had he taken my advice, it might have been
better for him; but he's bigotted to his own
opinion. You must know, Mr. Pickle, upon
our return to England, I counselled him to com∣pose
a little, smart, clever ode upon my Cleo∣patra.
As Gad shall judge me, I thought it
would have been of some service, in helping him
out of obscurity; for you know, as Sir Richard
observes,
<Q><L>Soon will that die, which adds thy fame to mine.</L>
<L>Let me then live, join'd to a work of thine.</L></Q>
By the bye, there is a most picturesque con∣trast
in these lines, of <HI>thy</HI> and <HI>me, living</HI> and <HI>dy∣ing,</HI>
and <HI>thine</HI> and <HI>mine.</HI> Ah! a pize upon it!
Dick, after all, was the man. Ecod! he
rounded it off. But, to return to this unhappy
young man, would you believe it, he tossed up
his nose at my friendly proposal, and gabbled
something in Greek, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not worth re∣peating.
The case was this, my dear Sir, he
was out of humour at the neglect of the world.
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
He thought the poets of the age were jealous of
his genius, and strove to crush it accordingly,
while the rest of mankind wanted ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e sufficient
to discern it. For my own part, I profess my∣self
one of these; and as the clown in Billy
Shakespear says of the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> oath, had I
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>worn by the doctor's genius, that the pan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes
were naught, they might have been for all that
very good, yet shouldn't I have been forsworn.
Let that be as it will, he retired from town in
great dudgeon, and set up his rest near a hill in
D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbyshire, with two tops, resembling Parnassus,
and a well at the bottom, which he had christened
Hyp-o-the-Green. Egad! if he stays in that h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bitation,
'tis my opinion he'd soon grow green
with the hip indeed. He'll be glad of an oppor∣tunity
to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, and
pay his court to the slighted queen Cleopatra.
Ha! well remembered, by this light. You shall
know, my good Sir, that this same Egyptian
princess has been courted by so many gallants of
taste, that as I hope to live, I found myself in
some sort of a dilemma, because in parting with
her to one, I should have disobliged all his rivals.
Now a man would not chuse to give offence to
his friends, at least I lay it down as a maxim, to
avoid the smallest appearance of ingratitude.
Perhaps I may be in the wrong. But every man
has his way. For this reason, I proposed to all
the candidates, that a lottery or raffle should be
set on foot, by which every individual would
have an equal chance for her good graces, and
the prize to be left to the decision of fortune.
The scheme was mightily relished, and the terms
being such a trifle as half a guinea, the whole
town crouded into my house, in order to sub∣scribe.
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
But there I was their humble servant.
Gentlemen, you must have a little patience till
my own particular friends are served. Among
that number, I do myself the honour to consider
Mr. Pickle. Here is a copy of the proposals;
and if the list should be adorned with his name,
I hope, notwithstanding his merited success
among the young ladies, he will for once be
shunned by that little vixen called Miss Fortune;
he, he, he!”</P>
<P>So saying, he bowed with a thousand apish
conges, and presented his paper to Peregrine,
who seeing the number of subscribers was li∣mited
to one hundred, said he thought him too
moderate in his expectations, as he did not doubt
that his picture would be a cheap purchase at five
hundred, instead of fifty pounds, at which the
price was fixed. To this unexpected remark
Pallet answered, that among connoisseurs he
would not pretend to appraise his picture; but
that, in valuing his works, he was obliged to
have an eye to the Gothic ignorance of the age
in which he lived.</P>
<P>Our adventurer saw at once into the nature of
this raff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, which was no other than a begging
shift to dispose of a paultry piece, that he could
not otherwise have sold for twenty shillings.
However, far from shocking the poor man in
distress, by dropping the least hint of his con∣jecture,
he desired to be favoured with six
chances, if the circumstances of his plan would
indulge him so far; and the painter, after some
hesitation, condescended to comply with his re∣quest,
out of pure friendship and veneration;
tho' he observed, that in so doing he must ex∣clude
some of his most intimate companions.
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
Having received the money, he gave Pickle his
address, desiring he would, with his convenience,
visit the princess, who, he was sure, would dis∣play
her most engaging attractions, in order to
captivate his fancy; and took his leave, extreme∣ly
well pleased with the success of his applica∣tion.</P>
<P>Tho' Peregrine was tempted with the curiosity
of seeing this portrait, which he imagined must
contain some analogy to the ridiculous oddity of
the painter, he would not expose himself to the
disagreeable alternative of applauding the per∣formance,
contrary to the dictates of conscience
and common sense, or of condemning it, to the
unspeakable mortification of the miserable au∣thor;
and therefore never dreamt of returning
the painter's visit: nor did he ever hear of the
lottery's being drawn.</P>
<P>About this time he was invited to spend a few
weeks at the country-seat of a certain nobleman,
with whom he had contracted an acquaintance,
in the course of his debauches, which we have
already described; and his lordship being remark∣able
for his skill and success in horse-racing, his
house was continually filled with the connoisseurs
and admirers of that sport, upon which the
whole conversation turned, insomuch that Pere∣grine
gradually imbibed some knowledge in
horse-flesh, and the diversions of the course; for
the whole occupation of the day, exclusive of
eating and drinking, consisted in viewing, ma∣naging
and exercising his lordship's stud.</P>
<P>Our hero looked upon these amusements with
an eye of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ste, as well as curiosity; he contem∣plated
the animal as a beautiful and elegant part
of the creation, and relished the surprising exer∣tion
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
of its speed with a refined and classical de∣light.
In a little time he became personally ac∣quainted
with every horse in the stable, and in∣terested
himself in the reputation of each; while
he also gratified his appetite for knowledge, in
observing the methods of preparing their bodies,
and training them to the race. His landlord saw
and encouraged his eagerness, from which he
promised himself some advantage; he formed se∣veral
private matches for his entertainment, and
flattered his discernment, by permitting him to
be successful in the first betts he made. Thus
was he artfully decoyed into a spirit of keenness
and adventure, and disposed to depend upon his
own judgment, in opposition to that of people
who had made coursing the sole study of their
lives. He accompanied my lord to Newmarket,
and entering at once into the genius of the place,
was marked as fair game, by all the knowing
ones there assembled, many of whom found
means to <HI>take him in,</HI> in spite of all the cautions
and admonitions of his lordship, who wanted to
reserve him for his own use.</P>
<P>It is almost impossible for any man, let him
be never so fearful or phlegmatic, to be an un∣concerned
spectator in this busy scene. The
daemon of play hovers in the air, like a pesti∣lential
vapour, tainting the minds of all present
with infallible infection, which communicates
from one person to another, like the circulation
of a general pannic. Peregrine was seized with
this epidemic distemper to a violent degree; and
after having lost a few loose hundreds, in his
progress through the various rookeries of the
place, entered into partnership with his noble
friend in a grand match, upon the issue of which
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
he ventured no less than three thousand pounds.
Indeed, he would not have risqued such a con∣siderable
sum, had not his own confidence been
reinforced by the opinion and concurrence of his
lordship, who hazarded an equal bett upon the
same event. These two associates engaged them∣selves
in the penalty of six thousand pounds, to
run one chaise and four against another, three
times round the course; and our adventurer had
the satisfaction of seeing his antagonists distanced
in the first and second heat; but all of a sudden,
one of the horses of his machine was knocked
up, by which accident, the victory was ravished
almost from his very grasp, and he was obliged
to endure the damage and the scorn.</P>
<P>He was deeply affected with this misfortune,
which he imputed to his own extravagance and
temerity, but discovered no external signs of af∣fliction,
because his illustrious partner bore his
loss with the most philosophic resignation, con∣soling
himself, as well as Pickle, with the hope
of making it up, on some other occasion. Ne∣vertheless,
our young gentleman could not help
admiring and even envying his equanimity, not
knowing that his lordship had managed matters
so as to be a gainer by the misfortune; which to
retrieve, Peregrine purchased several horses, at
the recommendation of his friend; and instead
of returning to London, made a tour with him
to all the celebrated races in England, at which,
after several vicissitudes of fortune, he made
shift, before the end of the season, to treble
his loss.</P>
<P>But his hopes seemed to increase with his ill
luck; and in the beginning of winter he came
to town, fully persuaded that fortune must ne∣cessarily
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
change, and that next season he should
reap the happy fruits of his experience. In this
confidence, he seemed to drown all ideas of pru∣dence
and oeconomy; his former expence was
mere parsimony, compared with that which he
now incurred: he subscribed to the opera, and
half a dozen concerts at different parts of the
town; was a benefactor to several hospitals, pur∣chased
a collection of valuable pictures, took an
house, and furnished it in a most magnificent
taste, laid in a large stock of French wines, and
gave extravagant entertainments to his quality-friends,
who in return loaded him with compli∣ment,
and insisted upon his making use of their
interest and good-will.</P>

<P>AMONG these professed patrons, the
greatest part of whom Peregrine saw thro',
there was one great personage, who seemed to
support with dignity the sphere in which fortune
had placed him. His behaviour to Pickle was
not a series of grinning compl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isance, in a flat
repetition of general expressions of friendship and
regard. He demeaned himself with a seemingly
honest reserve, in point of profession; his ad∣vances
to Peregrine appeared to be the result of
deliberation and experiment; he chid the young
gentleman for his extravagance with the autho∣rity
of a parent, and the sincerity of a fast
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
friend; and having, by gradual inquiries, made
himself acquainted with the state of his private
affairs, condemned his conduct with an air of
c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndour and concern. He represented to him
the folly and dangerous consequences of the pro∣stigate
life in which he had plunged himself,
couns<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him with great warmth to sell off his
race-horses, which would otherwise insensibly cat
him up; to ret<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ench all superfluous expence,
which would only serve to expose him to the ri∣dicule
and ingratitude of those who were bene∣fited
by it; to lay out his money upon secure
mortgages, at good interest; and carry into exe∣cution
his former design of standing candidate
for a borough, at the ensuing election for a new
parliament; in which c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, this nobleman pro∣mised
to assist him with his influence and advice;
assuring him, that if he could once procure a seat
in the house, he might look upon his fortune as
already made.</P>
<P>Our adventurer perceived the wisdom and sa∣nity
of this advice, for which he made his ac∣knowledgments
to his generous monitor, pro∣testing
that he would adhere to it in every parti∣cular,
and immediately set about a reformation.
He accordingly took cognizance of his most mi∣nute
affairs, and after an exact scrutiny, gave
his patron to understand, that, exclusive of his
furniture, his fortune was reduced to fourteen
thousand three hundred and thirty pounds, in
Bank and South-Sea annuities, over and above
the garison and its appendages, which he reckoned
at sixty pounds a year. He therefore desired
that as his lordship had been so kind as to favour
him with his friendship and advice, he would ex∣tend
his generosity still <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y putting him in
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
a way of making the most advantage of his mo∣ney
My lord said, that for his own part he did not
chuse to meddle in moneymatters; that he
would find abundance of people ready to borrow it
upon land-security; but that he ought to be ex∣tremely
cautious in a transaction of such conse∣quence;
promising at the same time, to employ
his own steward, in seeking out a mortgager to
whom it might be safely lent.</P>
<P>This agent was accordingly set at work, and
for a few days made a fruitless inquiry; so that
the young gentleman was obliged to have re∣course
to his own intelligence, by which he got
notice of several people of reputed credit, who
offered him mortgages for the whole sum; but
when he made a report of the particulars to his
noble friend, his lordship started such doubts and
objections relating to each, that he was deterred
from entering into any engagements with the pro∣posers;
congratulating himself, in the mean time,
on his good fortune, in being favoured with the
advice and direction of such a sage counsellor.
Nevertheless, he began to be impatient, after
having unsuccessfully consulted all the money-brokers
and conve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancers about town, and re∣solved
to try the expedient of a public advertise∣ment.
But he was persuaded by my lord to
postpone that experiment, until every other me∣thod
should have failed, because it would attract
the attention of all the pettisoggers in London,
who (though they might not be able to overreach)
would infallibly harrass and teize him out
of all tranquillity.</P>
<P>It was on the back of this conversation that
Peregrine, chancing to meet the steward near his
l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd's house, stopped him in the street, to give
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
him an account of his bad luck; at which the
other expressed some concern, and rubbing his
chin with his hand, in a musing posture, told
Pickle, there was a thought just come into his
head, pointing out one way of doing his business
effectually. The youth, upon this intimation,
begg'd he would accompany him to the next cof∣fee-house,
in which having chosen a private situa∣tion,
this grave manager gave him to understand,
that a part of my lord's estate was mortgaged, in
consequence of a debt contracted by his grand∣father,
for provision to the younger children of
the family; and that the equity of redemption
would be foreclosed in a few months, unless the
burthen could be discharged. “My lord (said
he) has always lived in a splendid manner, and
notwithstanding his ample fortune, together with
the profits accruing from the posts he enjoys, he
saves so little money, that, upon this occasion, I
know he will be obliged to borrow ten thousand
pounds, to make up the sum that is requisite to
redeem the mortgage. Now, certain I am, that
when his design comes to be known, he will be
sollicited on all hands, by people desirous of lend∣ing
money upon such undoubted security; and
'tis odds but he has already promised the pre∣ference
to some particular acquaintance. How∣ever,
as I know he has your interest very much
at heart, I will (if you please) found his lord∣ship
upon the subject, and in a day or two give you
notice of my success.”</P>
<P>Peregrine, ravished with the prospect of settling
this affair so much to his satisfaction, thanked
the steward for his friendly hint and undertaking,
which he assured him should be acknowledged by
a more solid proof of his gratitude, provided the
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
business could be brought to bear; and next day,
he was visited by this kind manager, with the
happy news of his lordship's having consented to
borrow ten thousand pounds of his stock, upon
mortgage, at the interest of five <HI>per Cent.</HI> This
information he received as an instance of the sin∣gular
esteem of his noble patron; and the papers
being immediately drawn and executed, the mo∣ney
was deposited in the hands of the mortgager,
who, in the hearing of the lender, laid strong
injunctions on his steward to pay the interest
punctually at quarter-day.</P>
<P>The best part of our hero's fortune being thus
happily deposited, and the agent gratified with a
present of fifty pieces, he began to put his re∣trenching
scheme in execution; all his servan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
(<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ipes excepted) were discharged, his chariot and
running-horses disposed of, his house-keeping
broke up, and his furniture sold by auction: nay,
the heat of his disposition was as remarkable in
this, as in any other transaction of his life; for
every step of his saving project was taken with
such eagerness, and even precipitation, that most
of his companions thought he was either ruined
or mad. But he answered all their expostulations
with a string of prudent apophthegms, such as,
“The shortest follies are the best;” “Better
to retrench upon conviction than compulsion;”
and divers other wise maxims, seemingly the re∣sult
of experience and philosophic reflection. To
such a degree of enthusiasm did his present oeco∣nomy
prevail, that he was actually seized with
the desire of amassing; and as he every day re∣ceived
proposals, from those brokers whom he
had employed, about the disposal of his cash, he
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
at length ventured fifteen hundred pounds upon
bottomry, being tempted by the excessive pre∣mium.</P>
<P>But it must be observed, for the honour of our
adventurer, that this reformation did not at all in∣terfere
with the good qualities of his heart: he
was still as friendly and benevolent as ever, tho'
his liberality was more subjected to the restraint
of reason; and he might have justly pleaded, in
vindication of his generosity, that he retrenched
the superfluiti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in his own way of living, in or∣der
to preserve the power of assisting his fellow-creatures
in distress. Numberless were the ob∣jects
to which he extended his charity in privat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪
Indeed, he exerted this virtue in secret, not only
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n account of avoiding the charge of ostenta∣tion,
but also because he was ashamed of being
detected in such an awkward unsa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hionable prac∣tice,
by the censorious observers of this humane
generation. In this particular, he seemed to
confound the ideas of virtue and vice; for he did
good as other people do evil, that is, by stealth;
and was so capricious in point of behaviour, that
frequently, in public, he wagged his tongue in
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tirical animadversions upon that poverty, which
his hand had, in private, relieved. Yet, far
from shunning the acquaintance, or discouraging
the solicitation of those who, he thought, wanted
his assistance, he was always accessible, open, and
complacent to them, even when the haughtiness
of his temper kept his superiors at a distance;
and often saved a modest man the anguish and
confusion of declaring himself, by penetrating in∣to
his necessity, and anticipating his request, in a
frank offer of his purse and friendship.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="53"/>
Not that he practised this beneficence to all the
needy of his acquaintance, without distinction;
there is always a set of idle profligate fellows,
who having squandered away their own fortunes,
and conquered all sense of honour and shame,
maintain themselves by borrowing from those
who have not yet finished the same career, and
want resolution to resist their importunate de∣mands.
To these he was always inflexible;
though he could not absolutely detach himself from
their company, because, by dint of effrontery,
and such of their original connexions as they have
been able to retain, they find admission to all
places of fashionable resort.</P>
<P>Several insuccessful attacks had been made up∣on
his pocket, by beggars of this class, one of
the most artful of whom, having one day joined
him in the Mall, and made the usual observation
on the weather, damned the fogs of London,
and began a dissertation on the difference of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
preferring that of the county in which he was
born, to any climate under the sun. “Was you
ever in Gloucestershire?” (said he to Peregrin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>)
who replying in the negative, he thus went on:
“I have got a house there, where I should be
glad to see you. Let us go down together, dur∣ing
the Easter-holidays; I can promise you good
country-fare and wholesome exercise; for I have
every thing within myself, and as good a pack of
fox-hounds as any in the three kingdoms. I
shan't pretend to expatiate upon the elegance of
the house, which to be sure is an old building;
and these, you know, are generally cold, and
not very convenient. But, curse the house! the
dirty acres about it are the thing; and a damn'd
fine parcel they are, to be sure. If my old
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
grandmother was dead—she can't live another
season, for she's turned of fourscore, and quite
wore out: nay, as for that matter, I believe I
have got a letter in my pocket, giving an account
of her being despaired of by the doctors. Let me
see—No, d—n it, I left it at home, in the pocket
of another coat.”</P>
<P>Pickle, who from the beginning of this ha∣rangue,
saw its tendency, seemed to yield the
most serious attention to what he said; breaking
in upon it, every now and then, with the inter∣jections,
Hum! Ha! The deuce! and several
civil questions, from which the other con∣ceived
happy omens of success; till perceiving
they had advanced as far as the passage into St.
James's, the mischievous youth interrupted him
all at once, saying, “I see you are for the end
of the walk; this is my way.” With these
words he took his leave of the saunterer, who
would have delayed his retreat, by calling to him
aloud, that he had not yet described the situation
of his c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stle. But Peregrine, without stopping,
answered in the same tone, “Another time w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll
do as well;” and in a moment disappeared, leav∣ing
the projector very much mortified with his dis∣appointment;
for his intention was to close the
description, with a demand of twenty pieces, to
be repaid out of the first remittance he should re∣ceive
from his estate.</P>
<P>It would have been well for our hero, had he
always acted with the same circumspection: but
he had his unguarded moments, in which he fell
a prey to the unsuspecting integrity of his own
heart. There was a person among the number
of his acquaintances, whose conversation he par∣ticularly
relished, because it was frank, agreeable,
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
and fraught with many sensible observations upon
the crast and treachery of mankind. This gen∣tleman
had made shift to discuss a very genteel
fortune, though it was spent with taste and re∣putation,
and now was reduced to his shifts for
the maintenance of his family, which consisted
of a wife and child. Not that he was destitute
of the necessaries of life, being comfortably sup∣plied
by the bounty of his friends: but this was
a provision not at all suited to his inclination;
and he had endeavoured, by divers unsuccessful
schemes, to retrieve his former independency.</P>
<P>Peregrine happened one evening to be sitting
alone in a coffee-house, where he over-heard a
conversation between this schemer and another gen∣tleman,
touching an affair that engaged his atten∣tion.
The stranger had been left trustee for fif∣teen
hundred pounds bequeathed to the other's
daughter by an aunt, and was strongly solicited
to pay the money to the child's father, who as∣sured
him, he had then an opportunity to lay it
out in such a manner, as would greatly conduce
to the advantage of his family. The trustee re∣minded
him of the nature of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> charge, which
made him accountable for the mone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, until the
child should have attained the age of eighteen;
but at the same time gave him to understand,
that if he could procure such security as would
indemnisy him from the consequences, he would
forthwith pay the legacy into his hands. To this
proposal the father replied, that it was not to be
supposed he would risque the fortune of his only
child, upon any idle or precarious issue; and
therefore he thought it reasonable, that he should
have the use of it in the mean time; and that, as
to security, he was lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to trouble any of his
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
friends about an affair which might be compro∣mised
without their interposition; observing, that
he would not look upon his condescension as a
favour, if obtained by a security, on which he
could borrow the same sum from any usurer in
town.</P>
<P>After much importunity on one side, and eva∣sion
on the other, the money'd gentleman told
him, that though he would not surrender the
sum deposited in his hands, for the use of his
daughter, he would lend him what he should
have occasion for, in the mean time; and if, up∣on
her being of age, he should be able to obtain
her concurrence, the money should be placed to
her account; provided he could find any person
of credit, who would join with him in a bond,
for the assurance of the lender. This proviso
was an obstruction which the other would not
have been able to surmount, without great diffi∣culty,
had not his cause been espoused by our
hero, who thought it was pity a man of honour
and understanding should suffer in his principal
concerns, on such a paultry consideration. He
therefore, presuming on his acquaintance, inter∣posed
in the conversation as a friend, who in∣terested
himself in the affair; and being fully in∣formed
of the particulars, offered himself as a
security for the lender.</P>
<P>This gentleman being a stranger to Peregrine,
was next day made acquainted with his funds;
and, without farther scruple, accommodated his
friend with one thousand pounds, for which he
took their bond, payable in six months, though
he protested that the money should never be de∣manded,
until the infant should be of age, unless
some accident should happen which he could not
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
then foresee. Pickle believed this declaration sin∣cere,
because he could have no interest in dis∣sembling:
but what he chiefly depended upon,
for his own security, was the integrity and con∣fidence
of the borrower, who assured him, that
happen what will, he should be able to stand be∣tween
him and all danger; the nature of his plan
being such, as would infallibly treble the sum in a
very few months.</P>
<P>In a little time after this transaction, writs be∣ing
issued out for electing a new parliament, our
adventurer, by the advice of his patron, went
into the country, in order to canvass for a bo∣rough,
and lined his pockets with a competent
share of bank-notes for the occasion. But, in
this project, he unfortunately happened to inter∣fere
with the interest of a great family in the op∣position,
who, for a long series of years, had
made members for that place; and were now so
much offended at the intrusion of our young
gentleman, that they threatened to spend ten
thousand pounds in frustrating his design. This
menace was no other than an incitement to Pe∣regrine,
who confided so much in his own in∣fluence
and address, that he verily believed he
should be able to battle his grace, even in his
own territories, and by that victory establish his
reputation and interest with the minister, who,
through the recommendation of his noble friend,
countenanced his cause, and would have been
very well pleased to see one of his greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
suffer such a disgraceful overthrow, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
would have, moreover, in a great measure shaken
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> credit with his f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction.</P>
<P>Our hero, intoxicated with the ideas of pride
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ambition, put all his talents to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
execution of this project. He spared no expence
in treating the electors; but finding himself ri∣valled,
in this respect, by his competitor, who
was powerfully supported, he had recourse to
those qualifications in which he thought himself
superior. He made balls for the ladies, visited
the matrons of the corporation, adapted himself
to their various humours with surprising facility,
drank with those who loved a cherishing cup in
private, made love to the amorous, prayed with
the religious, gossiped with those who delighted
in scandal, and with great sagacity contrived
agreeable presents to them all. This was the
most effectual method of engaging such electors
as were under the influence of their wives; and
as for the rest, he assailed them in their own
way, setting whole hogsheads of beer and wine
abroach, for the benefit of all comers; and into
those fordid hearts that liquor would not open,
he found means to convey himself by the help of
a golden key.</P>
<P>While he thus exerted himself, his antagonist
was not idle; his age and infirmities would not
permit him to enter personally into their parties;
but his steward and adherents bestirred them∣selves
with great industry and perseverance; and
the market for votes ran so high, that Pickle's
ready money was exhausted before the day of
election; and he was obliged to write to his pa∣tron
an account of the dilemma to which he was
reduced; intreating him to take such speedy mea∣sures,
as would enable him to finish the business
which he had so happily begun.</P>
<P>This nobleman communicated the circum∣stances
of the case to the minister, and in a day
or two our candidate found credit with the re∣ceiver-general
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
of the county, who lent him
twelve hundred pounds on his personal note,
payable on demand. By means of this new sup∣ply,
he managed matters so successfully, that an
evident majority of votes was secured in his inte∣rest;
and nothing could have obstructed his elec∣tion,
had not the noble peer who set up his com∣petitor,
in order to avoid the shame and mortifi∣cation
of being foiled in his own borough, offer∣ed
to compromise the affair with his honour, by
giving up two members in another place, pro∣vided
the opposition should cease in his own cor∣poration.
This proposal was greedily embraced;
and, on the eve of election, Peregrine received
an intimation from his patron, desiring him to
quit his pretensions, on pain of his and the mini∣ster's
displeasure; and promising that he should
be elected for another place.</P>
<P>No other disappointment in life could have given
him such chagrin as he felt at the receit of this
tantalizing order, by which the cup of success was
snatched from his lip, and all the vanity of his
ambitious hope humbled in the dust. He curs'd
the whole chain of his court connexions, inveigh∣ed
with great animosity against the rascally
scheme of politicks, to which he was sacrificed;
and in conclusion swore he would not give up the
fruits of his own address for the pleasure of any
minister upon earth. This laudable resolution,
however, was rendered ineffectual by his friend
the receiver-general, who was bearer of the
message, and (after having, in vain, endeavoured
to persuade him to submission) fairly arrested him
upon the spot for the money he had advanced;
this expedient being performed by virtue of a writ
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
which he had been advised to take out, in case
the young man should prove refractory.</P>
<P>The reader, who, by this time, must be
pretty well acquainted with the disposition of our
adventurer, may easily conceive how he relished
this imprisonment. At first, all the faculties of
his soul were swallowed up in astonishment and
indignation; and some minutes elapsed before
his nerves would obey the impulse of his rage,
which manifested itself in such an application to
the temples of the plaintiff, as laid him sprawling
on the floor. This assault, which was committed
in a tavern whither he had been purposely de∣coyed,
attracted the regard of the bailiff and his
followers, who, to the number of four, rushed
upon him at once, in order to overpower him;
but his wrath inspired him with such additional
strength and agility, that he disengaged himself
from them in a trice, and seizing a poker, which
was the first weapon that presented itself to his
hand, exercised it upon their skulls with incre∣dible
dexterity and execution. The officer him∣self,
who had been the first that presumed to la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
violent hands upon him, felt the first effects of
his fury, in a blow upon the jaws, in consequence
of which he lost three of his teeth, and fell
athwart the body of the receiver, with which he
form'd the figure of a St. Andrew's cross: one of
his myrmidons seeing the fate of his chief, would
not venture to attack the victor in front, but
wheeling to one side, made an attempt upon him
in flank, and was received obliquely by our he∣ro's
left hand and foot, so masterly disposed to t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
right side of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s leg, and the left side of his neck,
that he bolted head foremost into the chimney,
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
where his chin was encountered by the grate,
which, in a moment, feared him to the bone.
The rest of the detachment did not think proper
to maintain the dispute, but evacuating the room
with great expedition, locked the door on the
outside, and bellowed aloud to the receiver's ser∣vants,
beseeching them to come to the assistance
of their master, who was in danger of his life.</P>
<P>Mean while, this gentleman having recollect∣ed
himself, demanded a parley; which having
with difficulty obtained of our incensed candi∣date,
in consequence of the most submissive ap∣plication,
he complained grievously of the young
g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntleman's intemperance and heat of disposition,
and very calmly represented the danger of his
r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shness and indiscretion. He told him, that
nothing could be more outrageous or idle, than
the resistance he had made against the laws of his
country, because he would find it impracticable
to withstand the whole executive power of the
county, which he could easily raise to apprehend
and secure him; that over and above the disgrace
that would accrue to him from this imprudent
conduct, he would knock his own interest on
the head, by disobliging his friends in the admi∣nistration,
who were, to his knowledge, at pre∣sent
very well disposed to do him service; that,
for his own part, what he had done was by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> order of his superiors, and not out of any
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of distressing him; and that, far from be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
his enemy, notwithstanding the shocking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
he had sustained, he was ready to withdraw
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, provided he would listen to any reason∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
terms of accommodation.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was not m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prone to anger
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> open to conviction, being appeased by his
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
condescension, moved by his arguments, and
chid by his own reflection for what he had done
in the precipitation of his wrath, began to give
ear to his remonstrances; and the bailiffs being
ordered to withdraw, they entered into a confe∣rence,
the result of which was our adventurer's
immediate departure for London: so that next
day his competitor was unanimously chosen, be∣cause
no body appeared to oppose his election.</P>
<P>The discontented Pickle, on his arrival in
town, went directly to the house of his patron,
to whom, in the anguish of his disappointment,
he bitterly complained of the treatment he had
received, by which, besides the disgrace of his
overthrow, he was no less than two thousand
pounds out of pocket, exclusive of the debt for
which he stood engaged to the receiver. His
lordship, who was prepared for this expostula∣tion,
on his knowledge of the young man's im∣petuous
temper, answered all the articles of his
charge with great deliberation, giving him to un∣derstand
the motives that induced the minister to
quit his interest in that borough; and soothing
him with assurances that his loss would be amply
rewarded by his honour, to whom he was next
day introduced by this nobleman, in the warmest
stile of recommendation. The minister, who
was a pattern of complaisance, received him with
the most engaging affability; thanked him very
kindly for his endeavours to support and strengthen
the interest of the administration; and faithfully
promised to lay hold on the first opportunity to
express the sense he had of his zeal and attach∣ment;
desiring to see him often at his levee, that
in the multipl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>city <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f business he might not be
in danger of forgetting his services and desert.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine commences minister's dependent; meets
by accident with Mrs. Gauntlet; and descends
gradually, in the condition of life.</HEAD>
<P>THIS reception, favourable as it was, did
not please Peregrine, who had too much
discernment to be cajoled with general promises,
at a time when he thought himself intitled to the
most particular assurance. He accordingly signi∣fied
his disgust to his introductor, giving him to
understand, that he had la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his account with be∣ing
chosen representative of one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se boroughs
for which he had been sacrificed. His lordship
agreed to the reasonableness of his expectation,
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>serving, however, that he could not suppose
the minister would enter upon business with him,
on his first visit; and that it would be time
enough, at his next audience, to communicate
his demand.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this remonstrance, our hero
continued to indulge his suspicion and chagrin,
and even made a point of it with his patron, that
his lordship should next day make application in
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s behalf, left the two seats should be filled up,
on pretence of his inclination's being unknown.
Thus importuned, my lord went to his principal,
and returned with an answer, importing th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his
honour was extremely sorry that Mr. Pickle had
not signified his request before the boroughs in
question were promised to two gentlemen whom
he could not now disappoint, with any regard to
his own credit or interest; but as several persons
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
who would be chosen were, to his certain know∣ledge,
very aged and infirm, he did not doubt
that there would be plenty of vacant seats in a
very short time; and then the young gentleman
might depend upon his friendship.</P>
<P>Peregrine was so much irritated at this intima∣tion,
that in the first transports of his anger he
forgot the respect he owed to his friend, and in
his presence inveighed against the minister, as a
person devoid of gratitude and candour, protest∣ing,
that if ever an opportunity should offer it∣self,
he would spend the whole remains of his
fortune in opposing his measures. The nobleman
having given him time to exhaust the impetuosity
of his passion, rebuked him very calmly for his
disrespectful expressions, which were equally in∣jurious
and indiscreet; assured him that his pro∣ject
of revenge, if ever put in execution, would
redound to his own prejudice and confusion; and
advised him to cultivate and improve, with pa∣tience
and assiduity, the footing he had already
obtained in the minister's good graces.</P>
<P>Our hero convinced of the truth, tho' not sa∣tisfied
with the occasion of his admonitions, took
his leave in a fit of sullen discontent, and began
to ruminate upon the shattered posture of his af∣fairs.
All that now remained of the ample for∣tune
he had inherited, was the sum he had depo∣sited
in his lordship's hands, together with fifteen
hundred pounds he had ventured on bottomry,
and the garison, which he had left for the use and
accommodation of the lieutenant; and on the
per contra side of his account he was debtor for
the supply he had received from the receiver-ge∣neral,
and the money for which he was bound in
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>
behalf of his friend; so that he found himself,
for the first time of his life, very much emba∣rassed
in his circumstances: for, of the first half
year's interest of his ten thousand, which was
punctually paid, he had but fourscore pounds in
bank, without any prospect of a farther supply,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the other term, which was at the distance of
four l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng months. He seriously reflected upon
the uncertainty of human affairs; the ship with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fifteen hundred pounds might be lost, the
gentleman for whom he was security, might
miscarry in this, as well as in his former projects,
and the minister might one day, through policy
or displeasure, expose him to the mercy of his
dependant, who was in possession of his notes.</P>
<P>These suggestions did not at all contribute to
the ease of our adventurer's mind, already ruffled
by his disappointment. He cursed his own solly
and extravagance, by which he was reduced to
such an uncomfortable situation. He compared
his own conduct with that of some young gen∣tlemen
of his acquaintance, who, while he was
squandering away the best part of his inheritance,
had improved their fortunes, strengthened their
interest, and increased their reputation. He was
abandoned by his gayety and good humour, his
countenance gradually contracted itself into a re∣presentation
of severity and care, he dropped all
his amusements and the companions of his plea∣sure,
and turned his whole attention to the mi∣nister,
at whose levee he never failed to appear.</P>
<P>While he thus laboured in the wheel of de∣pendance,
with all that mortification which a
youth of his pride and sensibility may be supposed
to feel from such a disagreeable necessity, he one
day heard himself called by name, as he crossed
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
the Park; and turning, perceived the wife of
captain Gauntlet, with another lady. He no
sooner recognized the kind Sophy, than he ac∣costed
her with his wonted civility of friendship;
but his former sprightly air was metamorphosed
into such an austerity, or rather dejection of fea∣ture,
that she could scarce believe her own eyes;
and in her astonishment “Is it possible (said she)
that the gay Mr. Pickle should be so much altered
in such a short space of time!” He made no
other reply to this exclamation, but by a languid
smile; and asked how long she had been in town;
observing, that he would have paid his compli∣ments
to her at her own lodgings, had he been
favoured with the least intimation of her arrival.
After having thanked him for his politeness, she
told him, it was not owing to any abatement of
her friendship and esteem for him, that she had
omitted to give him that notice; but his abrupt
departure from Windsor, and the manner in
which he quitted Mr. Gauntlet, had given her
just grounds to believe, that they had incurred
his displeasure; which suspicion was reinforced
by his long silence and neglect from that period,
to the present time; when she observed, it was
still farther confirmed, by his forbearing to in∣quire
for Emilia and her brother: “Judge then,
(said she) if I had any reason to believe that you
would be pleased to hear that I was in town.
However, I will not detain you at present, be∣cause
you seem to be engaged about some parti∣cular
business; but, if you will favour me with
your company at breakfast to-morrow, I shall be
much pleased, and honoured to boot, by the
visit.” So saying, she gave him a direction to
her lodgings; and he took his leave, with a
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
faithful promise of seeing her at the appointed
time.</P>
<P>He was very much affected with this advance
of Sophy, which he considered as an instance of
her uncommon sweetness of temper; he felt strange
longings of returning friendship towards Godfrey;
and the remembrance of Emilia melted his heart,
already softened with grief and mortification.
Next day, he did not neglect his engagement,
and had the pleasure of enjoying a long conver∣sation
with this sensible young lady, who gave
him to understand, that her husband was with
his regiment; and presented to him a fine boy,
the first fruits of their love, whom they had
christened by the name of Peregrine, in memory
of the friendship which had subsisted between
Godfrey and our youth.</P>
<P>This proof of their regard, notwithstanding
the interruption in their correspondence, made a
deep impression upon the mind of our adventurer,
who having made the warmest acknowledgements
for this undeserved mark of respect, took the
child in his arms, and almost devoured him with
kisses, protesting before God, that he should al∣ways
consider him with the tenderness of a pa∣rent.
This was the highest compliment he could
pay to the gentle Sophy, who again kindly chid
him for his disdainful and precipitate retreat, im∣mediately
after her marriage; and expressed an
earnest desire of seeing him and the captain re∣conciled.
He assured her, nothing could give
him greater satisfaction than such an event, to
which he would contribute all that lay in his
power, though he could not help looking upon
himself as injured by captain Gauntlet's beha∣viour,
which denoted a suspicion of his honour,
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
as well as contempt for his understanding. The
lady undertook for the concession of her husband,
who (she told him) had been extremely sorry for
his own heat, after Mr. Pickle's departure, and
would have followed him to the garison, in order
to solicit his forgiveness, had not he been re∣strained
by certain punctilio's, occasioned by some
acrimonious expressions that dropt from Peregrine
at the inn.</P>
<P>After having cleared up this misunderstanding,
she proceeded to give an account of Emilia,
whose behaviour, at that juncture, plainly indi∣cated
a continuance of affection for her first lo∣ver;
and desired, that he would give her full
powers to bring that matter also to an accommo∣dation:
“For I am not more certain of my
own existence (said she) than that you are still in
possession of my sister's heart.” At this declara∣tion,
the tear started in his eye, while he shook
his head, and declined her good offices, wishing
that the young lady might be much more happy
than ever he should be able to make her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gauntlet, confounded at these expres∣sions,
and moved by the despondent manner in
which they were delivered, begg'd to know if
any new obstacle was raised, by some late change
in his sentiments or situation: and he, in order
to avoid a painful explanation, told her, that he
had long despaired of being able to vanquish Emi∣lia's
resentment, and for that reason quitted the
pursuit, which he would never renew, howso∣ever
his heart might suffer by that resolution;
though he took heaven to witness, that his love,
esteem, and admiration of her were not in the
least impaired: but the true motive of his laying
aside this design, was the consciousness of his
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
decayed fortune, which, by adding to the sensi∣bility
of his pride, increased the horror of an∣other
repulse. She expressed her concern for this
determination, both on his own account, and in
behalf of Emilia, whose happiness (in her opi∣nion)
depended upon his constancy and affec∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on;
and she would have questioned him more
minutely about the state of his affairs, had not he
discouraged the inquiry, by seeking to introduce
another subject of conversation.</P>
<P>After mutual protestations of friendship and re∣gard,
he promised to visit her often, during her
residence in town; and took his leave in a strange
perplexity of mind, occasioned by the images of
love, intruding upon the remonstrances of carking
care. He had some time ago forsaken those ex∣travagant
companions with whom he had rioted
in the h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yday of his fortune, and began to con∣sort
with a graver and more sober species of ac∣quaintance<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but he now found himself disabled
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cultivating the society of these also, who
were men of ample estates and liberal dispositions;
in consequence of which, their parties were too
expensive for the consumptive state of his fi∣nances;
so that he was obliged to descend ano∣ther
degree, and mingle with a set of old batche∣lors
and younger brothers, who subsisted on slender
annuities, or what is called a bare competency in
the public funds. This association was composed
of second-hand politicians and minor critics, who
in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>renoon saunter in the Mall, or lounge at
sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws of pictures, appear in the drawing-room
once or twice a week, dine at an ordinary, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
disputes in a coffee-house, with an air of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
intelligence, frequent the pit of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d once in a month spend an evening
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
with some noted actor, whose remarkable say∣ings
they repeat for the entertainment of their
ordinary friends.</P>
<P>After all, he found something comfortable
enough in the company of these gentlemen, who
never interested his passions to any violence of
transport, nor teazed him with impertinent cu∣riosity
about his private affairs: for though many
of them had maintained a very long, close, and
friendly correspondence with each other, they
never dreamt of inquiring into particular con∣cerns;
and if one of the two who were most
intimately connected, had been asked how the
other made shift to live, he would have answered,
with great truth, “Really, that is more than I
know.” Notwithstanding this phlegmatic indif∣ference,
which is of the true English production,
they were all inoffensive, good-natured people,
who loved a joke and a song, delighted in telling
a merry story, and prided themselves in the art of
catering, especially in the articles of fresh venison
and wild fowl.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman was not received among
them on the footing of a common member, who
makes interest for his admission; he was courted
as a person of superior genius and importance,
and his compliance looked upon as an honour to
their society. This their idea of his prehemi∣nence
was supported by his conversation, which,
while it was more liberal and learned than that
to which they had been accustomed, was tinc∣tured
with an assuming air, so agreeably diffused,
that instead of producing aversion, it commanded
respect. They not only appealed to him, in all
doubts relating to foreign parts, to which one
and all of them were strangers, but also consulted
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>
his knowledge in history and divinity, which
were frequently the topics of their debates; and
in poetry of all kinds, he decided with such ma∣gisterial
authority, as even weighed against the
opinions of the players themselves. The variety
of characters he had seen and observed, and the
high spheres of life in which he had so lately
moved, furnished him with a thousand entertain∣ing
anecdotes; and when he became a little fa∣miliarized
to his disappointments, so that his na∣tural
vivacity began to revive, he flashed among
them in such a number of bright sallies, as struck
them with admiration, and constituted himself a
classic in wit: insom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch that they began to retail
his remnants, and even invited some particular
friends to come and hear him hold forth. One
of the players, who had for many years strutted
about the taverns in the neighbourhood of Co∣vent-garden,
as the Grand Turk of wit and hu∣mour,
began to find his admirers melt away;
and a certain petulant physician, who had shone
at almost all the Port-clubs in that end of the
town, was actually obliged to import his talents
into the city, where he has now happily taken
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot.</P>
<P>Nor was this success to be wondered at, if we
consider that, over and above his natural genius
and education, our adventurer still had the op∣portunity
of knowing every thing which hap∣pened
among the great, by means of his friend
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adwallader, with whom he still maintained his
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmer intimacy, though it was now checquered
with many occasional tists, owing to the sarcastic
remonstrances of the Misanthrope, who disap∣proved
of those schemes which miscarried with
Peregrine, and now took unseasonable methods
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
of valuing himself upon his own foresight: nay,
he was between whiles like a raven croaking pre∣sages
of more ill luck from the deceit of the mi∣nister,
the dissimulation of his patron, the folly
of the projector for whom he was bound, the
uncertainty of the seas, and the villainy of those
with whom he had entrusted his c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh: for Crab∣tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
saw and considered every thing through a
perspective of spleen, that always reflected the
worst side of human nature.</P>
<P>For these reasons, our young gentleman began
to be disgusted, at certain intervals, with the
character of this old man, whom he now thought
a morose cynic, not so much incensed against the
follies and vices of mankind, as delighted with
the distress of his fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow creatures. Thus he put
the most unfavourable construction on the prin∣ciples
of his friend, because he found himself
justly fallen under the lash of his animadversion.
This self-accusation very often dissolves the closest
friendship: a man, conscious of his own indis∣cretion,
is implacably offended at the rectitude of
his companion's conduct, which he considers as
an insult upon his failings, never to be forgiven,
even though he has not tasted the bitterness of
reproof, which no sinner can commodiously di∣gest.
The friendship, therefore, subsisting be∣tween
Crabtree and Pickle, had of late suffered
several symptomatic shocks that seemed to prog∣nos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icate
a total dissolution; a great deal of
smart dialogue had passed in their private conver∣sations,
and the senior began to repent of having
placed his confidence in such an imprudent, head-strong,
ungovernable youth.</P>
<P>It was in such paroxysms of displeasure, that
be prophesied misfortune to Peregrine, and even
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
told him one morning, that he had dream'd of
the shipwreck of the two East-Indiamen on board
of which he had hazarded his money. But this
was no other than a false vision; for, in a few
weeks, one of them arrived at her moorings in
the river, and he received a thousand, in lieu of
eight hundred pounds which he had lent upon
bond to one of the mates. At the same time he
was informed, that the other ship, in which he
was concerned, had, in all probability, lost her
passage for the season, by being unable to wea∣ther
the Cape. He was not at all concerned at
that piece of news, knowing, that the longer he
should lie out of his money, he would have the
more interest to receive; and finding his present
difficulties removed by this supply, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> heart be∣gan
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>late, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to resume its
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rmer alacrity.</P>
<P>This state of exultation, however, was soon
interrupted by a small accident, which he could
not foresee: he was visited one morning by the
person who had lent his friend a thousand pounds
on his security, and given to understand, that the
borrower had absconded, in consequence <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a dis∣appointment,
by which he had lost the whole
sum, and all hopes of retrieving it; so that our
hero was now liable for the debt, which he be∣sought
him to discharge according to the bond,
that he (the lender) might not suffer by his hu∣manity.
It may be easily conceived, that Pere∣grine
did not receive this intelligence in cold blood.
He cursed his own imprudence in contracting s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch
engagements with an adventurer, whom he did
not sufficiently know, exclaimed against the
treachery of the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ector; and having for some
time indulged his resentment in threats and im∣precations,
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
inquired into the nature of the scheme
which had miscarried.</P>
<P>The lender, who had informed himself of the
whole affair, gratified his curiosity in this parti∣cular,
by telling him that the fugitive had been
cajoled by a certain knight of the post, who un∣dertook
to manage the thousand pounds in such
a manner, as would, in a very little time, make
him perfectly independant; and thus he deli∣neated
the plan: “One half of the sum (said
he) shall be laid out in jewels, which I will
pawn to certain persons of credit and fortune,
who lend money upon such pledges at an exor∣bitant
interest. The other shall be kept for re∣lieving
them, so that they may be again deposited
with a second set of those honourable usurers;
and when they shall have been circulated in this
manner through a variety of hands, we will ex∣tort
money from each of the pawn-brokers, by
threatening them with a public prosecution, for
exacting illegal interest; and I know that they
will bleed freely, rather than be exposed to the
infamy attending such an accusation.” The
scheme was feasible, and though not very ho∣nourable,
made such an impression upon the
needy borrower, that he assented to the proposal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and, by our hero's credit, the money was raised.
The jewels were accordingly purchased, pawne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
relieved, and re-pledged by the agent, who un∣dertook
to manage the whole affair; and so ju∣diciously
was the project executed, that he coul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have easily proved each lender guilty of the
charge. Having thus far successfully transact<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the business, this faithful agent visited them seve∣rally
on his own account, to give them intima∣tion,
that his employer intended to sue them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
the statute of usury; upon which, every one,
for himself, bribed the informer to withdraw his
evidence, by which alone he could be convicted;
and having received these gratifications, he had
thought proper to retreat into France, with the
whole booty, including the original thousand that
put them in motion. In consequence of this
decampment, the borrower had withdrawn him∣self;
so that the lender was obliged to have re∣course
to his security.</P>
<P>This was a very mortifying account to our
young gentleman, who in vain reminded the
narrator of his promise, importing, that he would
not demand the money, until he should be called
to an account by his ward; and observed, that
long before that period, the fugitive might ap∣pear
and discharge the debt. But the other was
deaf to these remonstrances; alledging, that his
promise was provisional, on the supposition that
the borrower would deal candidly and fairly;
that he had forfeited all title to his friendship and
trust, by the scandalous scheme in which he had
embarked; and that his treacherous flight from
his security was no proof of his honesty and in∣tended
return; but on the contrary, a warning,
by which he (the lender) was taught to take
care of himself. He therefore insisted upon h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
being indemnified immediately, on pain of letting
the law take its course; and Peregrine was ac∣tually
obliged to part with the whole sum he had
so lately received. But this payment was not
made without extreme reluctance, indignation,
and denunciation of eternal war against the ab∣sconder,
and the rigid creditor, betwixt whom
he suspected some collusion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Cadwallader acts the part of a comforter to his
friend; and is in his turn consoled by Peregrine,
who begins to find himself a most egregious dupe.</HEAD>
<P>THIS new misfortune, which he justly
charged to the account of his own folly,
recalled his chagrin; and though he endeavoured
with all his might to conceal the affair from the
knowledge of Cadwallader, that prying observer
perceived his countenance overcast; and the pro∣jector's
sudden disappearance alarming his suspi∣cion,
he managed his inquiries with so much art,
that in a few days he made himself acquainted
with every particular of the transaction, and re∣solved
to gratify his spleen at the expence of the
impatient dupe. With this view, he took an
opportunity to accost him with a very serious air,
saying, a friend of his had immediate occasion
for a thousand pounds, and as Peregrine had the
exact sum lying by him, he would take it as a
great favour, if he would part with it for a few
months on undoubted security. Had Pickle
known the true motive of this demand, he
would, in all likelihood, have made a very dis∣agreeable
answer; but Crabtree had wrapt him∣self
up so securely in the dissimulation of his fea∣tures,
that the youth could not possibly penetrate
into his intention; and in the most galling sus∣pence
replied, that the money was otherwise en∣gaged.
The Misanthrope, not contented with
this irritation, assumed the prerogative of a
friend, and questioned him so minutely about the
disposal of the cash, that after numberless eva∣sions,
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
which cost him a world of torture to in∣vent,
he could contain his vexation no longer,
but exclaimed in a rage, “Damn your imperti∣nence!
'tis gone to the devil, and that's enough!”
“Thereafter as it may be (said this tormentor,
with a most provoking indifference of aspect) I
should be glad to know upon what sooting; for
I suppose you have some expectation of advan∣tage
from that quarter.” “'Sdeath! Sir (cried
the impatient youth) if I had any expectation
from hell, I would make interest with you, for I
believe from my soul, you are one of its most
favoured ministers upon earth.” With these
words, he flung out of the room, leaving Cad∣wallader
very well satisfied with the chastisement
he had bestowed.</P>
<P>Peregrine having cooled himself with a solitary
walk in the park, during which the violence of
his choler gradually evaporated, and his reflection
was called to a serious deliberation upon the
posture of his affairs; he resolved to redouble his
diligence and importunity with his patron and the
minister, in order to obtain some fine-cure,
which would indemnify him for the damage he
had sustained on their account. He accordingly
went to his lordship, and signified his demand,
after having told him, that he had suffered seve∣ral
fresh losses, which rendered an immediate
provision of that sort necessary to his credit and
subsistence.</P>
<P>His noble friend commended him for the re∣gard
he manifested for his own interest, which
he considered as a proof of his being at last de∣tached
from the careless inadvertency of youth;
he approved of his demand, which, he assured
him, should be faithfully transmitted to the mi∣nister,
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
and backed with all his influence; and
encouraged his hope, by observing, that some
profitable places were at that time vacant, and,
so far as he knew, unengaged.</P>
<P>This conversation helped to restore the tran∣quillity
of Pickle's breast, tho' he still harboured
resentment against Cadwallader, on account of
the last insult; and on the instant he formed a plan
of revenge. He knew the misanthrope's remit∣tances
from his estate in the country, had been
of late very scanty, in consequence of repairs and
bankruptcies among his tenants: so that, in spite
of all his frugality, he had been but barely able to
maintain his credit, and even that was engaged
on the strength of his running rent. Being there∣fore
intimately acquainted with the particulars of
his fortune, he wrote a letter to Crabtree, sub∣scribed
with the name of his principal farmer's
wife, importing, that her husband being lately
dead, and the greatest part of her cattle destroy∣ed
by the infectious distemper, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e found herself
utterly incapable of paying the rent which was
due, or even of keeping the farm, unless he
would, out of his great goodness, be pleased to
give her some assistance and allow her to sit free
for a twelvemonth to come. This intimation he
found means to convey by post from a market-town
adjoining to the farm, directed in the usual
stile to the cynic, who seeing it stamped with the
known marks, could not possibly suspect any im∣position.</P>
<P>Hackneyed as he was in the ways of life, and
steeled with his boasted stoicism, this epistle
threw him into such an agony of vexation, that a
double proportion of sowering was visible in his as∣pect,
when he was visited by the author, who
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
having observed and followed the postman at a
proper distance, introduced a conversation upon
his own disappointments, in which, among other
circumstances of his own ill-luck, he told him,
that his patron's steward had desired to be excused
from paying the last quarter of his interest pre∣cisely
at the appointed term; for which reason,
he should be utterly void of cash; and therefore
requested, that Crabtree would accommodate
him with an hundred pieces out of his next remit∣tance
from the country.</P>
<P>This demand galled and perplexed the old man
to such a degree, that the muscles of his face as∣sumed
a contraction most peculiarly virulent, and
exhibited the character of Diogenes with a most
lively expression: he knew that a confession of his
true situation would furnish Pickle with an op∣portunity
to make reprisals upon him, with in∣tolerable
triumph; and that, by a downright re∣fusal
to supply his wants, he would for ever for∣feit
his friendship and esteem, and might provoke
him to take ample vengeance for his fordid be∣haviour,
by exposing him, in his native colours,
to the resentment of those whom he had so long
deceived. These considerations kept him some
time in a most rancorous state of suspence, which
Peregrine affected to misinterpret, by bidding
him freely declare his suspicion, if he did not think
it safe to comply with his request, and he would
make shift elsewhere.</P>
<P>This seeming misconstruction increased the
torture of the misanthrope, who, with the ut∣most
irritation of feature, “Oons! (cried he)
what villainy have you noted in my conduct, that
you treat me like a rascally usurer?” Peregrine
very gravely replied, that the question needed no
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
answer; “for (said he) had I considered you as
an usurer, I would have come with a security
under my arm; but, all evasion apart, will you
stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I have the
money?” “Would it were in your belly, with
a barrel of gunpowder! (exclaimed the enraged
cynic) since I must be excruciated, read that
plaguy paper!—'sblood! why didn't nature clap
a pair of long ears and a tail upon me, that I might
be a real ass, and champ thistles on some com∣mon,
independent of my fellow-creatures?
Would I were a worm, that I might creep into
the earth, and thatch my habitation with a single
straw; or rather a wasp or a viper, that I might
make the rascally world feel my resentment: but
why do I talk of rascality? folly, folly is the
scourge of life! Give me a scoundrel (so he be a
sensible one) and I will put him in my heart of
hearts! but a fool is more mischievous than fa∣mine,
pestilence and war. The idiotical h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g
that writes, or causes to be writ, this same let∣ter,
has ruined her family, and broke her hus∣band's
heart, by ignorance and mismanagement;
and she imputes her calamity to providence with
a vengeance; and so I am defrauded of three
hundred pounds, the greatest part of which I owe
to tradesmen whom I have promised to pay this
very quarter. Pox upon her! I would she were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n horned beast, that the distemper might lay
hold on her. The beldame has the impudence
too (after she has brought me into this dilemma)
to solicit my assistance to stock the farm anew▪
Before God, I have a good mind to send her an
halter, and perhaps I might purchase another for
myself, but that I would not furnish food for
laughter to knaves and coxcombs.”</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="81"/>
Peregrine having perused the billet, and listen∣ed
to this ejaculation, replied with great compo∣sure,
that he was ashamed to see a man of his
years and pretensions to philosophy, so ruffled by
a trifle. “What signify all the boasted hardships
you have overcome (said he) and the shrewd ob∣servations
you pretend to have made on human
nature? Where is that stoical indifference you
affirm you have attained, if such a paultry disap∣pointment
can disturb you in this manner? What
is the loss of three hundred pounds, compared
with the misfortunes which I myself have under∣gone
within these two years? Yet you w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll take

all the passions of the heart. You was so kind as
to insult me t' other day in my affliction, by re∣proaching
me with indiscretion and misconduct;
suppose I were now to retort the imputation, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how a man of your profound sagacity could
leave your fortune at the discretion of ignorant
peasants? How could you be so blind as not to
foresee the necessity of repairs, together with the
danger of a bankruptcy, murrain, or thin crop?
Why did not you convert your land into ready
money, and (as you have no connexions in life)
purchase an annuity, on which you might have
lived at your ease, without any fear of the conse∣quence?
Can't you, from the whole budget of
your philosophy, cull one apophthegm to cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le
you in this trivial mischance?”</P>
<P>“Rot your rapidity! (said the cynic, half-choaked
with gall) if the cancer or the pox were
in your throat, I should not be thus tormented
with your tongue: and yet a magpye shall speak
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
infinitely more to the purpose. Don't you know,
Mr. Wiseacre, that my case does not fall within
the province of philosophy? Had I been curtail∣ed
of all my members, racked by the gout and
gravel, deprived of liberty, robbed of an only
child, or visited with the death of a dear friend
like you, philosophy might have contributed to
my consolation; but will philosophy pay my
debts, or free me from the burden of obligation
to a set of fellows whom I despise? Speak—pro∣nounce
—demonstrate—or may heaven close your
mouth for ever!”</P>
<P>“These are the comfortable fruits of your
misanthropy (answered the youth) your laudable
scheme of detaching yourself from the bonds of
society, and of moving in a superior sphere of
your own. Had not you been so peculiarly sage,
and intent upon laughing at mankind, you could
never have been disconcerted by such a pitiful in∣convenience:
any friend would have accommo∣dated
you with the sum in question. But now
the world may retort the laugh; for you stand
upon such an agreeable footing with your ac∣quaintance,
that nothing could please them bet∣ter
than an account of your having given disap∣pointment
the slip, by the help of a noose pro∣perly
applied. This I mention by way of hint,
upon which I would have you chew the cud of
reflection; and should it come to that issue, I
will use my whole interest with the coroner, to
bring in his verdict <HI>Lunacy,</HI> that your carcase may
have christian burial.”</P>
<P>So saying, he withdrew, very well satisfied
with the revenge he had taken, which operated
so violently upon Crabtree, that if it had not
been for the sole consideration mentioned above,
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>
he would, in all probability, have had recourse
to the remedy proposed. But his unwillingness
to oblige and entertain his fellow-creatures, hin∣dered
him from practising that expedient, till, by
course of post, he was happily undeceived with
regard to the situation of his affairs; and that in∣formation
had such an effect upon him, that he
not only forgave our hero for the stratagem, which
he immediately ascribed to the right author, but
also made him a tender of his purse: so that mat∣ters,
for the present, were brought to an amicable
accommodation.</P>
<P>Mean wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, Peregrine never slackened in his
attendance upon the great; he never omitted to
appear upon every levee-day, employed his in∣dustry
and penetration in getting intelligence of
posts that were unfilled, and every day recom∣mended
himself to the good offices of his patron,
who seemed to espouse his interest with great cor∣diality:
nevertheless, he was always too late in
his application, or the place he demanded chanc∣ed
to be out of the minister's gift.</P>
<P>These intimations, tho' communicated in the
most warm professions of friendship and regard,
gave great umbrage to the young gentleman, who
considered them as the evasions of an insincere
courtier, and loudly complained of them as such
to his lordship, signifying, at the same time, an
intention to sell his mortgage for ready money,
which he would expend to the last farthing in
thwarting his honour, in the very first election
he should patronize. His lordship never wanted
a proper exhortation upon these occasions: he
did not now endeavour to pacify him with as∣surances
of the minister's favour, because he per∣ceived
that these medicines had, by repeated use,
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
lost their effect upon our adventurer, whose me∣naces
he now combated, by representing that the
minister's purse was heavier than that of Mr.
Pickle; that therefore, should he make a point
of opposing his interest, the youth must infallibly
fail in the contest: in which case he would find
himself utterly destitute of the means of subsist∣ence,
and consequently precluded from all hope
of provision.</P>
<P>This was an observation, the truth of which
our young gentleman could not pretend to doubt,
tho' it did not at all tend to the vindication of
his honour's conduct. Indeed Pickle began to
suspect the sincerity of his own patron, who, in
his opinion, had trifled with his impatience, and
even eluded, by sorry excuses, his desire of hav∣ing
another private audience of the first mover.
His lordship also began to be less accessible than
usual; and Peregrine had been obliged to dun
the steward with repeated demands, before he
could singer the last quarter of his interest.</P>
<P>Alarmed by these considerations, he went and
consulted the nobleman whom he had obliged in
the affair of his son; and had the mortification
to hear but a very indifferent character of the
person in whom he had so long confided. This
new adviser, who (though a courtier) was a rival
of the other, gave our adventurer to understand,
that he had been leaning upon a broken reed;
that his prosessed patron was a man of a shat∣tered
fortune and decayed interest, which ex∣tended
no farther than a smile and a whisper;
that for his own part, he should have been proud
of an opportunity to use his influence with the
minister in behalf of Mr. Pickle: “But, since
you have put yourself under the protection of
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
another peer, (said he) whose connexions inter∣fere
with mine, I cannot now espouse your
cause, without incurring the imputation of se∣ducing
that nobleman's adherents; a charge
which, of all others, I would most carefully
avoid. However, I shall always be ready to as∣sist
you with my private advice, as a specimen of
which, I now counsel you to insist upon having
another interview with Sir Steady Steerwell him∣self,
that you may in person explain your preten∣sions,
without any risque of being misrepresented;
and endeavour, if possible, to draw him into some
particular promise, from which he cannot retract,
with any regard to his reputation: for general
profession is a necessary armour worn by all mini∣sters
in their own defence, against the importu∣nity
of those whom they will not befriend, and
would not disoblige.”</P>
<P>This advice was so conformable to his own
sentiments, that our adventurer seized the first
opportunity to demand an hearing; and plainly
told his patron, that if he could not be indulged
with that favour, he should look upon his lord∣ship's
influence to be very small, and his own
hopes to be altogether desperate; in which case,
he was resolved to dispose of the mortgage, pur∣chase
an annuity, and live independant.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is indulged with a second audience by the mi∣nister,
of whose sincerity he is convinced. His
pride and ambition revive, and again are mor∣tified.</HEAD>
<P>IF the young gentleman's money had been in
other hands, perhaps the peer would have
been at very little pains, either in gratifying his
demand, or opposing his revenge; but he knew
that a sale of the mortgage could not be effected
without an inquiry, to which he did not wish to
be exposed. He therefore employed all his in∣terest
in procuring the solicited audience; which
being granted, Peregrine, with great warmth
and elocution, expatiated upon the injury his
fortune had suffered in the affair of the borough,
for which he had stood candidate; he took notice
of the disappointment he had sustained in the
other election, reminded him of the promises with
which he had been amused, and in conclusion,
desired to know what he had to expect from his
favour.</P>
<P>The minister having patiently heard him to an
end, replied with a most gracious aspect, that he
was very well informed of his merit and attach∣ment,
and very much disposed to convince him
of the regard which he paid to both; that till of
late, he did not know the nature of his expecta∣tions,
neither had he the power of creating posts
for those whom he was inclined to serve; but if
Mr. Pickle would chalk out any feasible method,
by which he could manifest his sentiments of
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
friendship, he should not be backward in exe∣cuting
the plan.</P>
<P>Peregrine laying hold on this declaration, men∣tioned
several places which he knew to be vacant;
but the old evasion was still used: one of them
was not in his department of business; another
had been promised to the third-son of a certain
earl, before the death of the last possessor; and
a third was incumbered with a pension that ate
up a good half of the appointments. In short,
such obstructions were started to all his proposals,
as he could not possibly surmount; though he
plainly perceived, they were no other than spe∣cious
pretexts to cover the mortifying side of a
refusal. Exasperated, therefore, at this lack of
sincerity and gratitude, “I can easily foresee,
(said he) that such difficulties will never be want∣ing,
when I have any thing to ask; and for that
reason, will save myself the trouble of any far∣ther
application.” So saying, he withdrew in a
very abrupt manner, breathing defiance and re∣venge.
But his patron, who did not think pro∣per
to drive him to extremities, found means to
persuade his honour, to do something for the
pacification of the young man's choler: and that
same evening our adventurer received a message
from his lordship, desiring to see him imme∣diately.</P>
<P>In consequence of this intimation, Pickle went
to his house, and appeared before him with a
very cloudy aspect, which signified to whom it
might concern, that his temper was at present
too much galled to endure reproof; and there∣fore
the sagacious peer forbore taking him to task
for his behaviour during the audience he had ob∣tained;
but gave him to understand, that the
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
minister, in consideration of his services, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt him a bank-note for three hundred pounds,
with a promise of the like sum yearly, until he
could be otherwise provided for. This declara∣tion
in some measure appeased the youth, who
condescended to accept the present; and next
levee-day, made his acknowledgment to the do∣nor,
who favoured him with a smile of infinite
complacency, which intirely dissipated all the re∣mains
of his resentment; f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, as he could not
possibly divine the true cause of his being tem∣porized
with, he looked upon his condescension
as an undoubted proof of Sir Steady's sincerity,
and firmly believed, that he would settle him in
some place with the first opportunity, rather than
continue to pay this pension out of his own
pocket. In all probability, this prediction would
have been verified, had not an unforeseen acci∣dent
in a moment overwhelmed the bark of his
interest at court.</P>
<P>Mean while, this short gleam of good fortune
recalled the ideas of pride and amb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion, which
he had formerly cherished. His countenance
was again lifted up, his good humour <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etrieve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and his mien re-exalted. Indeed, he began to be
considered as a rising man by his fellow-depen∣dants,
who saw the particular notice with which
he was favoured at the public levee; and some of
them, for that reason, were at pains to court his
good graces. He no longer shunned his former
intimates, with whom a good part of his fortune
had been spent, but made up to them in all places
of public resort, with the same case and fami∣liarity
as he had been used to express, and even
reimbarked in some of their excesses, upon the
strength of his sanguine expectation. Cadwallader
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
and he renewed their consultations in the court
of ridicule; and divers exploits were atchieved,
to the confusion of those who had <HI>sailed into the
North of their displeasure.</HI></P>
<P>But these enjoyments were soon interrupted by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> misfortune equally fatal and unexpected: his
noble patron was seized with an apoplectic fit,
from which he was recovered by the physcians,
that they might dispatch him according to rule;
and accordingly, in two months after they were
called, he went the way of all flesh. Peregrine
was very much afflicted at this event, not only
on account of his friendship for the deceased, to
whom he thought himself under many and great
obligations, but also, because he feared that his
own interest would suffer a severe shock, by the
removal of this nobleman, whom he considered
as its chief support. He put himself therefore in
mourning, out of regard to the memory of his
departed friend, and exhibited genuine marks of
sorrow and concern; though he had, in reality,
more cause to grieve than he as yet imagined.</P>
<P>When quarter day came about, he applied to
the steward of his lordship's heir for the interest
of his money, as usual; and the reader will rea∣dily
own he had some reason to be surprized,
when he was told he had no claim either to prin∣cipal
or interest. True it is, the manager talked
very civilly as well as sensibly on the subject.
“Your appearance, Sir, (said he to Pickle)
screens you from all suspicion of an intended
fraud; but the mortgage upon those lands you
mention, was granted to another person many
years before you pretend to have lent that sum;
and I have, this very morning, paid one quar∣ter's
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
interest, as appears from this receipt, which
you may peruse for your satisfaction.”</P>
<P>Peregrine was so thunder-struck at this infor∣mation,
which stripped him of his all, that he
could not utter one word; a circumstance that
did no great honour to his character, in the opi∣nion
of the steward, who, in good earnest, be∣gan
to entertain some doubts of his integrity:
for, among the papers of the deceased, which he
had examined, there was no writing, memo∣randum,
or receipt, relating to this incumbrance.
After a long pause of stupefaction, Peregrine re∣collected
himself so far, as to observe, that either
he was egregiously mistaken, or the predecessor
of his lord the greatest villain upon earth. “But,
Mr. Whatdyecallum, (said he) you must give
me leave to tell you, that your bare assertion, in
this affair, will by no means induce me to put
up quietly with the loss of ten thousand pounds.”</P>
<P>Having thus expressed himself, he retired from
the house, so discontented at this demur, that he
scarce knew whether he moved upon his head or
heels; and the park chancing to lie in his way,
he sauntered about, giving vent to a soliloquy in
praise of his departed friend, the burden of which
was a string of incoherent curses imprecated upon
himself; till his transports, by degrees, giving
way to his reflection, he deliberated seriously
and sorrowfully upon his misfortune, and resolved
to consult lawyers, without loss of time. But,
first of all, he proposed to make personal appli∣cation
to the heir, who, by a candid represen∣tation
of the case, might be inclined to do him
justice.</P>
<P>In consequence of this determination, he next
morning put his writings in his pocket, and went
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
in a chair to the house of the young nobleman,
to whom being admitted by virtue of his appear∣ance,
and a small gratification to the porter, he
explained the whole affair, corroborating his asser∣tions
with the papers which he produced, and
describing the disgrace that would be intailed upon
the memory of the deceased, should he be obliged
to seek redress in a public court of justice.</P>
<P>The executor, who was a person of good
breeding, condoled him upon his loss with great
good nature, though he did not seem much sur∣prized
at his account of the matter; but wished,
that since the fraud must have been committed,
the damage had fallen upon the first mortgager,
who (he said) was a thievish usurer, grown rich
by the distresses of his fellow-creatures. In an∣swer
to our hero's remonstrances, he observed,
that he did not look upon himself as obliged to
pay the least regard to the character of his pre∣decessor,
who had used him with great barbarity
and injustice, not only in excluding him from
his countenance and assistance, but also in preju∣dicing
his inheritance, as much as lay in his
power; so that it could not be reasonably ex∣pected,
that he would pay ten thousand pounds
of his debt, for which he had received no value.
Peregrine, in spite of his chagrin, could not help
owning within himself, that there was a good
deal of reason in this refusal; and after having
given loose to his indignation, in the most vio∣lent
invectives against the defunct, took his leave
of the complaisant heir, and had immediate re∣course
to the advice of counsel, who assured him
that he had an excellent plea, and was accordingly
retained in the cause.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="92"/>
All these measures were taken in the first vi∣gour
of his exertion, during which his spirits were
so flustered with the diversity of passions produced
by his mischance, that he mistook for equanimity
that which was no other than intoxication; and
two whole days elapsed, before he arrived at a
due sense of his misfortune. Then indeed he
underwent a woeful self-examination; every cir∣cumstance
of the inquiry added fresh pangs to his
reflection; and the result of the whole was a
discovery, that his fortune was totally consumed,
and himself reduced to a state of the most de∣plorable
dependance. This suggestion alone
might (in the anguish of his despondency) have
driven him to some desperate course, had not it
been in some measure qualified by the confidence
of his lawyers, and the assurance of the minister,
which (slender as the world hath generally found
them) were the only bulwarks between misery
and him.</P>
<P>The mind is naturally pliable, and, provided
it has the least hope to lean upon, adapts itself
wonderfully to the emergencies of fortune, espe∣cially
when the imagination is gay and luxuriant.
This was the case with our adventurer; instead
of indulging the melancholy ideas which his loss
inspired, he had recourse to the flattering delu∣sions
of hope, soothing himself with unsubstan∣tial
plans of future greatness, and endeavouring
to cover what was past with the veil of oblivion.</P>
<P>After some hesitation, he resolved to make
Crabtree acquainted with his misfortune, that
once for all he might might pass the ordeal of
his satire, without subjecting himself to a long
series of sarcastic hints and doubtful allusions,
which he could not endure. He accordingly
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
took the first opportunity of telling him, that he
was absolutely ruined by the persidy of his pa∣tron,
and desired that he would not aggravate
his affliction, by those cynical remarks which were
peculiar to men of his misanthropical disposition.
Cadwallader listened to this declaration with in∣ternal
surprize, which, however, produced no
alteration in his countenance; and, after some
pause, observed, that our hero had no reason to
look for any new observation from him upon
this event, which he had long foreseen, and daily
expected; and exhorted him, with an ironical
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to console himself with the promise of the
minister, who would doubtless discharge the debts
of his deceased bosom-friend.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine commits himself to the publick, and is
admitted member of a college of authors.</HEAD>
<P>THE bitterness of this explanation being
passed, our young gentleman began to re∣volve
within himself schemes for making up the
deficiencies of his yearly income, which was now
so grievously reduced, and determined to profit,
in some shape or other, by those talents which he
owed to nature and education. He had, in his
affluence, heard of several authors, who, with∣out
any pretensions to genius, or human litera∣ture,
earned a very genteel subsistence, by un∣dertaking
work for booksellers, in which reputa∣tion
was not at all concerned. One (for ex∣ample)
professed all manner of translation, at so
much <HI>per</HI> sheet, and actually kept five or six
amanuenses continually employed, like so many
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
clerks in a compting-house; by which means,
he was enabled to live at his ease, and enjoy his
friend and his bottle, ambitious of no other cha∣racter
than that of an honest man, and a good
neighbour. Another projected a variety of plans
for new dictionaries, which were executed under
his eye by day-labourers; and the province of a
third was history and voyages, collected or abridged
by understrappers of the same class.</P>
<P>Mr. Pickle, in his comparisons, paid such de∣ference
to his own capacity, as banished all
doubts of his being able to excel any of those un∣dertakers,
in their different branches of profes∣sion,
if ever he should be driven to that experi∣ment:
but his ambition prompted him to make
his interest and glory coincide, by attempting
some performance which should do him honour
with the publick, and at the same time establish
his importance among the copy-purchasers in
town. With this view, he worshipped the muse;
and, conscious of the little regard which is, in
this age, paid to every species of poetic compo∣sition,
in which neither satire nor obscenity oc∣curs,
he produced an imitation of Juvenal, and
lashed some conspicuous characters, with equal
truth, spirit, and severity. Though his name
did not appear in the title-page of this produc∣tion,
he managed matters so, as that the work
was universally imputed to the true author, who
was not altogether disappointed in his expecta∣tions
of success; for the impression was imme∣diately
sold off, and the piece became the sub∣ject
of conversation in all assemblies of taste.</P>
<P>This happy exordium not only attracted the
addresses of the booksellers, who made interest
for his acquaintance, but also roused the notice
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
of a society of authors, who stiled themselves
<HI>the college,</HI> from which he was honoured with a
deputation, offering to enroll him a member, by
unanimous consent. The person employed for
this purpose being a bard who had formerly tasted
of our hero's bounty, used all his eloquence to
persuade him to comply with the advances of
their fraternity, which he described in such a
manner, as inflamed the curiosity of Pickle, who
dismissed the embassador, with an acknowledge∣ment
of the great honour they conferred upon
him, and a faithful promise of endeavouring to
merit the continuance of their approbation.</P>
<P>He was afterwards, by the same minister, in∣structed
in the ceremonies of the college; and,
in consequence of his information, composed an
ode, to be publickly recited on the evening of his
introduction. He understood, that this consti∣tution
was no other than a body of authors, in∣corporated
by mutual consent, for their joint ad∣vantage
and satisfaction, opposed to another as∣sembly
of the same kind, their avowed enemies
and detractors. No wonder then, that they
sought to strengthen themselves with such a va∣luable
acquisition as our hero was like to prove.
The college consisted of authors only, and these
of all degrees in point of reputation, from the
fabricator of a song set to music, and sung at
Marybone, to the dramatic bard who had ap∣peared
in buskins upon the stage: nay, one of
the members had actually finished eight books of
an epic poem, for the publication of which, he
was, at that time, soliciting subscriptions.</P>
<P>It cannot be supposed that such a congregation
of the sons of Apollo would sit a whole evening
with order and decorum, unless they were under
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
the check of some established authority: and this
inconvenience having been foreseen, they had
elected a president, vested with full power to si∣lence
any member or members, that should at∣tempt
to disturb the harmony and subordination
of the whole. The sage, who at this time pos∣sessed
the chair, was a person in years, whose
countenance was a lively portraiture of that ran∣corous
discontent which follows repeated dam∣nation.
He had been extremely unfortunate in
his theatrical productions, and was (to use the
words of a prophane wag, who assisted at the
condemnation of his last play) by this time <HI>damn'd
beyond redemption.</HI> Nevertheless, he still tarried
about the skirts of Parnassus, translating some of
the classics, and writing miscellanies; and, by
dint of an invincible assurance, insolence untamed,
the most undaunted virulence of tongue, and
some knowledge of life, he made shift to ac∣quire
and maintain the character of a man of
learning and wit, in the opinion of people who
had neither; that is, thirty-nine in forty of those
with whom he associated himself. He was even
looked upon in this light by some few of the col∣lege;
though the major part of those who fa∣voured
his election, were such as dreaded his ma∣lice,
respected his experience and seniority, or
hated his competitor, who was the epic poet.</P>
<P>The chief end of this society (as I have al∣ready
hinted) was to assist and support each other
in their productions, which they mutually recom∣mended
to sale, with all their art and influence,
not only in private conversation, but also in oc∣casional
epigrams, criticisms, and advertisements
inserted in the public papers. This science,
which is known by the vulgar appellation or
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
<HI>puffing,</HI> they carried to such a pitch of finesse,
that an author very often wrote an abusive an∣swer
to his own performance, in order to inflame
the curiosity of the town, by which it had been
overlook'd. Notwithstanding this general unani∣mity
in the college, a private animosity had long
subsisted between the two rivals I have mention∣ed,
on account of precedence, to which both
laid claim, though, by a majority of votes, it
had been decided in favour of the present chair∣man.
The grudge indeed never proceeded to
any degree of outrage or defiance, but manifested
itself at every meeting, in attempts to eclipse each
other in smart sayings and pregnant repartee; so
that there was always a delicate mess of this kind
of wit served up in the front of the evening, for
the entertainment and example of the junior
members, who never failed to divide upon this
occasion, declaring themselves for one or other of
the combatants, whom they encouraged by their
looks, gestures, and applause, according to the
circumstances of the dispute.</P>
<P>This honourable consistory was held in the
best room of an ale-house, which afforded wine,
punch, or beer, suitable to the purse or inclina∣tion
of every individual, who separately paid for
his own choice: and here was our hero intro∣duced,
in the midst of twenty strangers, who, by
their looks and equipage, formed a very pic∣turesque
variety. He was received with a most
gracious solemnity, and placed upon the right
hand of the president, who having commanded
silence, recited aloud his introductory ode, which
met with universal approbation. Then was
tendered to him the customary oath, obliging
him to consult the honour and advantage of the
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
society, as far as it should lie in his power, in
every station of life: and this being taken, his
temples were bound with a wreath of laurel,
which was kept sacred for such inauguration.</P>
<P>When these rites were performed with all due
ceremony, the new member cast his eyes around
the place, and took a more accurate survey of his
brethren; among whom he observed a strange
collection of periwigs, with regard to the co∣lour,
fashion, and dimensions, which were such
as he had never seen before. Those who sat on
each side, nearest the president, were generally
distinguished by venerable tyes, the foretops of
which exhibited a surprising diversity; some of
them rose slanting backwards, like the glacis of
a fortification; some were elevated in two di∣stinct
eminences, like the hills H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licon and Par∣nassus;
and others were curled and reflected, as
the horns of Jupiter Ammon. Next to these,
the majors took place, many of which were mere
<HI>succedanea,</HI> made by the application of an occa∣sional
rose to the tail of a lank bob; and in the
lower form appeared masses of hair, which would
admit of no description.</P>
<P>Their cloaths were tolerably well suited to
the furniture of their heads, the apparel of the
upper bench being decent and clean, while that
of the second class was thread-bare and soiled;
and at the lower end of the room, he perceived
divers efforts made to conceal rent breeches and
dirty linen: nay, he could distinguish by their
countenances, the different kinds of poetry in
which they exercised the muse; he saw Tragedy
conspicuous in a grave solemnity of regard, Satire
louring in a frown of envy and discontent, Elegy
whining in a funereal aspect, Pastoral dozing in
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
a most insipid languor of face, Ode-writing deli∣neated
in a distracted stare, and Epigram squint∣ing
with a pert sneer. Perhaps our hero refined
too much in his penetration, when he affirmed,
that over and above these discoveries, he could
plainly perceive the state of every one's finances,
and would have undertaken to have guessed each
particular sum, without varying three farthings
from the truth.</P>
<P>The conversation, instead of becoming ge∣neral,
began to fall into parties; and the epic
poet had actually attracted the attention of a pri∣vate
committee, when the chairman interposed,
calling aloud, “No cabals, no conspiracies, gen∣tlemen.”
His rival, thinking it incumbent upon
him to make some reply to this rebuke, answer∣ed,
“We have no secrets; he that hath ears,
let him hear.” This was spoke as an intimation
to the company, whose looks were instantly
whetted with the expectation of their ordinary
meal: but the president seemed to decline the
contest; for, without putting on his fighting face,
he calmly replied, that he had seen Mr. Meta∣phor
tip the wink, and whisper to one of his con∣federates;
and thence judged, that there was
something mysterious on the carpet.</P>
<P>The epic poet, believing his antagonist crest∣fallen,
resolved to take the advantage of his de∣jection,
that he might inhance his own character
in the opinion of the stranger; and with that
view asked, with an air of exultation, if a man
might not be allowed to have a convulsion in his
eye, without being suspected of a conspiracy.
The president, perceiving his drift, and piqued
at his presumption, “To be sure (said he) a
man of a weak head may be very well supposed
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
to have convulsions in his eyes.” This repartee
produced a laugh of triumph among the chair∣man's
adherents; one of whom observed, that
his rival had got a smart rap on the pate. “Yes,
(replied the bard) in that respect Mr. Chairman
has the advantage of me. Had my head been
fortified with a horn-work, I should not have
been so sensible of the stroke.” This retort,
which carried a severe allusion to the president's
wife, lighted up the countenances of the aggres∣sor's
friends, which had begun to be a little ob∣umbrated;
and had a contrary effect upon the
other faction, till their chief, collecting all his
capacity, returned the salute, by observing, that
there was no occasion for an horn-work, when
the covered way was not worth defending.</P>
<P>Such a reprizal upon Mr. Metaphor's yoke∣fellow,
who was by no means remarkable for her
beauty, could not fail to operate upon the hearers;
and as for the bard himself, he was evidently
ruffled by the reflection; to which, however, he,
without hesitation, replied, “Egad! 'tis my opi∣nion,
that if your covered way was laid open,
few people would venture to give the assault.”
“Not unless their batteries were more effectual
than the fire of your wit,” (said the president.)
“As for that matter, (cried the other with pre∣cipitation)
they would have no occasion to batter
in breach; they would find the angle of the <HI>la
pucelle</HI> bastion demolished to their hands: he he!”
“But I believe it would surpass your under∣standing,
(resumed the chairman) to fill up the
<HI>fos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.”</HI> “That, I own, is impracticable, (replied
the bard) there I should meet with an <HI>hiatus
maxime deflendus!”</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="101"/>
The president, exasperated at this insinuation,
in presence of the new member, exclaimed with
indignation in his looks, “And yet, if a body
of pioneers were set at work upon your skull,
they would find rubbish enough to choak up all
the common sewers in town.” Here a groan
was uttered by the admirers of the epic poet,
who taking a pinch of snuff with great compo∣sure,
“When a man grows scurrilous, (said he)
I take it for an undoubted proof of his over∣throw.”
“If that be the case, (cried the other)
you yourself must be the vanquished party; for
you was the first that was driven to personal
abuse.” “I appeal (answered the bard) to
those who can distinguish. Gentlemen, your
judgment?”</P>
<P>This reference produced an universal clamour,
and the whole college was involved in confusion.
Every man entered into dispute with his neigh∣bour,
on the merits of this cause. The chair∣man
interposed his authority in vain; the noise
grew louder and louder; the disputants waxed
warm; the epithets of <HI>blockhead, fool,</HI> and <HI>scoundrel</HI>
were bandied about. Peregrine enjoyed the up∣roar,
and leaping upon the table, founded the
charge to battle, which was immediately com∣menced
in ten different duels; in consequence of
which, the lights were extinguished; the com∣batants
threshed one another without distinction;
the mischievous Pickle distributed sundry random
blows in the dark; and the people below, being
alarmed with the sound of application, the over∣turning
of chairs, and the outcries of those who
were engaged, came up stairs in a body, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
lights, to reconnoitre, and, if possible, quell this
hideous tumult.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="102"/>
Objects were no sooner rendered visible, than
the field of battle exhibited strange groupes of
the standing and the fallen. Each of Mr. Me∣taphor's
eyes was surrounded with a circle of a
livid hue; and the president's nose distilled a
quantity of clotted blood. One of the tragic
authors, finding himself assaulted in the dark,
had, by way of poinard, employed upon his ad∣versary's
throat a knife which lay upon the table,
for the convenience of cutting cheese; but, by
the blessing of God, the edge of it was not keen
enough to enter the skin, which it had only
scratched in divers places. A satirist had almost
bit off the ear of a lyric bard. Shirts and neck-cloaths
were torn to rags; and there was such a
woeful wreck of periwigs on the floor, that no
examination could adjust the property of the own∣ers,
the greatest part of whom were obliged to
use handkerchiefs, by way of night-cap.</P>
<P>The fray, however, ceased at the approach of
those who interposed; part of the combatants
being tired of an exercise, in which they had re∣ceived
nothing but hard blows; part of them be∣ing
intimidated by the remonstrances of the land∣lord
and his company, who threatened to call
the watch; and a very few being ashamed of the
scandalous dispute in which they were detected.
But though the battle was ended, it was impos∣sible,
for that evening, to restore harmony and
good order to the society, which broke up, after
the president had pronounced a short and con∣fused
apology to our adventurer, for the indecent
uproar which had unfortunately happened on the
first night of his admission.</P>
<P>Indeed, Peregrine deliberated with himself,
whether or not his reputation would allow him
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
to appear again among this venerable fraternity:
but, as he knew some of them to be men of real
genius, how ridiculous soever their carriage might
be modified, and was of that laughing disposition,
which is always seeking food for mirth, as Horace
observes of Philippus,
<Q>Risus undique quaerit;</Q>
he resolved to frequent the college, notwithstand∣ing
this accident, which happened at his inaugu∣ration;
being thereto, moreover, induced by his
desire of knowing the private history of the stage,
with which he supposed some of the members
perfectly well acquainted. He was also visited,
before the next meeting, by his introductor, who
assured him, that such a tumult had never hap∣pened
since the institution of the assembly, till
that very night; and promised, that for the fu∣ture,
he should have no cause to be scandalized
at their behaviour.</P>
<P>Persuaded by these motives and assurances, he
trusted himself once more in the midst of their
community, and every thing proceeded with great
decorum; all dispute and altercation was avoided,
and the college applied itself seriously to the pur∣poses
of its meeting; namely, to hear the grie∣vances
of individuals, and assist them with salu∣tary
advice. The first person that craved redress,
was a noisy North Briton, who complained (in a
strange dialect) that he had, in the beginning of
the season, presented a comedy to the manager
of a certain theatre, who, after it had lain six
weeks in his hands, returned it to the author, af∣firming
there was neither sense nor English in the
performance.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104"/>
The president, (who, by the bye) had revised
the piece) thinking his own reputation concern∣ed,
declared, in presence of the whole society,
that with regard to sense, he would not under∣take
to vindicate the production; but, in point
of language, no fault could be justly laid to its
charge: “The case, however, is very plain,
(said he) the manager never gave himself the
trouble to peruse the play, but formed a judgment
of it from the conversation of the author, never
dreaming that it had undergone the revisal of an
English writer: be that as it will, you are infi∣nitely
obliged to him, for having dispatched you
so soon, and I shall have the better opinion of him
for it so long as I live; for I have known other-guess
authors than you (that is, in point of in∣terest
and fame) kept in continual attendance
and dependance during the best part of their lives,
and after all, disappointed in the expectation of
seeing their performances exhibited on the stage.
There are only two methods, by which you have
any chance of introducing your play upon the
theatre; one is compulsive, by the interpo∣sition
of the great, whom a patentee dares not
disoblige; the other, insinuation, by ingratiating
yourself with the manager: you must be recom∣mended
to his notice; you must cultivate his
good graces with all the humility of adulation;
write poems in his praise; if he be an actor, sup∣port
his performance against all censure, though
it should be founded upon demonstration; and in
public coffee-houses, as well as in private parties,
magnify the virtues of his heart, in despite of
truth and illustration. This, indeed, is the most
effectual expedient, and what I advise you to
practise, after you shall have been introduced to
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
his acquaintance, by some person of weight; and
if, by these means, and dint of perseverance,
you can, in three or four years, see your comedy
in rehearsal, you may think yourself extremely
fortunate in your application: for a man, with∣out
interest or pretension, may present a petition
to the captain-general of his majesty's forces,
demanding a commission for the first company
that shall become vacant, and be as likely to
meet with success, as an unsupported author that
offers a performance to the stage. Though a
patentee had no friends of his own to oblige,
why the devil should he put himself to the ex∣pence
and trouble attending the representation of
a new play, and part with three benefit-nights,
to please the vanity and fill the pockets of a
stranger?”</P>
<P>The northern bard began to argue with great
vehemence and vociferation, against the advice
and observations of the chairman, undertaking to
prove from reason, as well as from experience,
that one poet is of greater dignity and importance
to the commonwealth, than all the patentees or
players that ever existed. But he was over-ruled
and silenced in the beginning of his harangue, by
a decree of the council, which was unanimously
of opinion, that the advice he had received was
equally judicious and expedient, and that it would
be his own fault, if he did not profit by the ad∣monition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Further proceedings of the college.</HEAD>
<P>THIS affair was no sooner discussed, than
another gentleman exhibited a complaint,
signifying, that he had undertaken to translate in∣to
English, a certain celebrated author, who had
been cruelly mangled by former attempts; and
that, soon as his design took air, the proprietors
of those miserable translations had endeavoured
to prejudice his work, by industrious insinuations,
contrary to truth and fair dealing, importing,
that he did not understand one word of the lan∣guage
which he pretended to translate. This
being a case that nearly concerned the greatest
part of the audience, it was taken into serious
deliberation: some observed, that it was not only
a malicious effort against the plaintiff, but also a
spiteful advertisement to the public, tending to
promote an inquiry into the abilities of all other
translators, few of whom (it was well known)
were so qualified, as to stand the test of such ex∣amination.
Others said, that over and above
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s consideration, which ought to have its due
weight with the college, there was a necessity
for concerting measures to humble the presump∣tion
of booksellers, who had, from time imme∣morial,
taken all opportunities to oppress and en∣slave
their authors; not only by limiting men of
genius to the wages of a journeyman taylor,
without even allowing them one sabbath in the
week, but also in taking such advantages of their
necessities, as were inconsistent with justice and
humanity, “For example, (said one of the
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
members) after I myself had acquired a little re∣putation
with the town, I was caressed by one of
those tyrants who professed a friendship for me,
and even suppl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed me with money, according to
the exigencies of my situation; so that I looked
upon him as the mirrour of disinterested benevo∣lence;
and had he known my disposition, and
treated me accordingly, I should have writ for
him upon his own terms. After I had used his
friendship in this manner for some time, I hap∣pened
to have occasion for a small sum of money,
and with great confidence made another applica∣tion
to my good friend; when all of a sudden he
put a stop to his generosity, refused to accom∣modate
me in the most abrupt and mortifying
style; and though I was at that time pretty far
advanced in a work for his benefit, which was
a sufficient security for what I owed him, he
roundly asked, how I proposed to pay the money
which I had already borrowed. Thus was I
used like a young whore just come upon the
town, whom the bawd allows to run into her
debt, that she may have it in her power to op∣press
her at pleasure; and if the sufferer com∣plains,
she is treated like the most ungrateful
wretch upon earth; and that too with such appear∣ance
of reason, as may easily mislead an uncon∣cerned
spectator. “You unthankful drab! (she
will say) didn't I take you into my house when
you hadn't a shift to your back, a petticoat to
your tail, nor a morsel of bread to put into your
belly? Ha'n't I cloathed you from head to foot
like a gentlewoman, supported you with board,
lodging, and all necessaries, till your own ex∣travagance
hath brought you into distress; and
now you have the impudence, you nasty, stinking
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
brimstone bungaway! to say you are hardly dealt
with, when I demand no more than my own.”
Thus the whore and the author are equally op∣pressed,
and even left without the melancholy
privilege of complaining; so that they are fain to
subscribe to such terms as their creditors shall
please to impose.</P>
<P>This illustration operated so powerfully upon
the conviction and resentment of the whole col∣lege,
that revenge was universally denounced
against those who had aggrieved the plaintiff; and
after some debate, it was agreed, that he should
make a new translation of some other saleable
book, in opposition to a former version belonging
to the delinquents, and print it in such a small
size, as would enable him to undersell their pro∣perty;
and that this new translation should be
recommended and introduced into the world,
with the whole art and influence of the society.</P>
<P>This affair being settled to the satisfaction of
all present, an author of some character stood
up, and craved the advice and assistance of his
fellows, in punishing a certain nobleman of great
pretensions to taste, who, in consequence of a
production which this gentleman had ushered into
the world, with universal applause, not only de∣sired,
but even eagerly courted his acquaintance.
“He invited me to his house (said he) where I
was overwhelmed with civility and professions of
friendship. He insisted upon my treating him
as an intimate, and calling upon him at all hours,
without ceremony; he made me promise to break∣fast
with him at least three times a week: In
short, I looked upon myself as very fortunate,
in meeting with such advances from a man of his
interest and reputation, who had it in his power
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
to befriend me effectually in my passage through
life; and, that I might not give him any cause
to think I neglected his friendship, I went to his
house in two days, with a view of drinking cho∣colate,
according to appointment: but he had
been so much fatigued with dancing at an assembly
over night, that his valet de chambre would not
venture to wake him so early; and I left my
compliments to his lordship, with a performance
in manuscript, which he had expressed a most
eager desire to peruse. I repeated my visit next
morning, that his impatience to see me might
not have some violent effect upon his constitu∣tion;
and received a message from his minister,
signifying, that he had been highly entertained
with the manuscript I had left, a great part of
which he had read, but was at present so busy in
contriving a proper dress for a private masquerade,
which would be given that same evening, that he
could not have the pleasure of my company at break∣fast.
This was a feasible excuse, which I admitted
accordingly, and in a day or two appeared again,
when his lordship was particularly engaged. This
might possibly be the case; and therefore I re∣turned
the fourth time, in hopes of finding him
more at leisure; but he had gone out about half
an hour before my arrival, and left my perfor∣mance
with his valet de chambre, who assured
me, that his lord had perused it with infinite plea∣sure.
Perhaps I might have retired very well
satisfied with this declaration, had not I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in my
passage through the hall, heard one of the foot∣men,
upon the top of the stair-case, pronounce
with an audible voice, “Will your lordship
please to be at home, when he calls?” It is not
to be supposed that I was pleased at this discovery,
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
which I no sooner made, than turning to my
conductor, “I find, (said I) his lordship is dis∣posed
to be abroad to more people than me this
morning.” The fellow (though a valet de cham∣bre)
blushed at this observation; and I with∣drew,
not a little irritated at the silly peer's disin∣genuity,
and fully resolved to spare him my vi∣sits
for the future. It was not long after this
occasion, that I happened to meet him in the
park, and being naturally civil, I could not pass
him without a salutation of the hat, which he
returned in the most distant manner, though we
were both solitary, and not a soul within view;
and when that very performance, which he had
applauded so warmly, was lately published by sub∣scription,
he did not bespeak so much as one
copy. I have often reflected with wonder upon
this ridiculous inconsistency in the man's conduct,
which looks like the result of a settled design to
render himself odious and contemptible. I never
courted his patronage, nor indeed thought of his
name, until he made interest for my acquaintance;
and if he was disappointed in my conversation,
why did he press me so much to further con∣nexion?”</P>
<P>“The case is very clear, (cried the chair∣man,
interrupting him) he is one of those cox∣combs
who set up for taste, and value them∣selves
upon knowing all men of genius, whom
they would be thought to assist in their produc∣tions.
I will lay an even bet with any man,
that his lordship, on the strength of that slender
interview, together with the opportunity of hav∣ing
seen your performance in manuscript, has al∣ready
hinted to every company in which he is
conversant, that you solicited his assistance in re∣touching
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
the piece, which you have now offered
to the publick, and that he was pleased to favour
you with his advice, but found you obstinately
bigotted to your own opinion, in some points re∣lating
to those very passages which have not met
with the approbation of the town. And as for his
caresses, there was nothing at all extraordinary
in his behaviour. By that time you have lived
to my age, you will not be surprized to see a
courtier's promise and performance of a different
complexion: not but that I would willingly act
as an auxiliary to your resentment, if I thought
it was possible to make him repent of his pitiful
dissimulation; but, if I guess aright, the person
you mean, has long ago conquered all sense of
probity and shame, and therefore is effectually
shielded against the revenge of an author.”</P>
<P>The opinion of the president was sanctioned
by the concurrence of all the members; and all
other complaints and memorials being deferred
till another sitting, the college proceeded to an
exercise of wit, which was generally performed
once every fortnight, with a view to promote the
expectoration of genius. The subject was occa∣sionally
chosen by the chairman, who opened
the game with some shrewd remark naturally
arising from the conversation; and then the ball
was tossed about from one corner of the room
to the other, according to the motions of the
spirit.</P>
<P>That the reader may have a just idea of this
sport, and of the abilities of those who carried
it on, I shall repeat the sallies of this evening,
according to the order and succession in which
they escaped. One of the members observing
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
that Mr. Metaphor was absent, was told by the
person who sat next to him, that the poet had
foul weather at home, and could not stir abroad,
“What! (said the president, interposing, with
the signal upon his countenance) is he wind-bound
in port?” “Wine-bound, I suppose,”
(cried another.) “Hooped with wine! a strange
metaphor!” (said a third.) “Not if he has
got into a hogshead,” (answered a fourth.) “The
hogshead will sooner get into him, (replied a
fifth) it must be a tun or an ocean.” “No
wonder then, if he should be overwhelmed,”
(said a sixth.) “If she should, (cried a seventh)
he will cast up when his gall breaks.” “That
must be very soon, (roared an eighth) for it has
been long ready to burst.” “No, no, (ob∣served
a ninth) he'll stick fast at the bottom,
take my word for it; he has a <HI>natural alacrity
in sinking.</HI>” “And yet, (remarked a tenth) I
have seen him in the clouds.” “Then was he
cloudy, I suppose, (cried the eleventh.) “So
dark, (replied the other) that his meaning could
not be perceived.” “For all that, (said the
twelfth) he is easily seen through.” “You
talk, (answered a thirteenth) as if his head was
made of glass.” “No, no, (cried a fourteenth)
his head is made of more durable stuff; it will
bend before it breaks.” “Yet I have seen it
broken,” (resumed the president.) “Did you
perceive any wit come out at the hole?” (said
another.) “His wit (replied the chairman) is
too subtile to be perceived.”</P>
<P>A third mouth was just opened, when the
exercise was suddenly interrupted by the dread∣ful
cry of fire, which issued from the kitchen,
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
and involved the whole college in confusion.
Every man endeavouring to be the first in mak∣ing
his exit, the door and passage were blocked
up; each individual was pummelled by the per∣son
that happened to be behind him. This com∣munication
produced noise and exclamation;
clouds of smoke rolled upwards into the apart∣ment,
and terror sat on every brow; when Pere∣grine
seeing no prospect of retreating by the
door, opened one of the windows, and fairly
leapt into the street, where he found a crowd of
people assembled to contribute their assistance in
extinguishing the flames. Several members of
the college followed his example, and happily
accomplished their escape: the chairman himself
being unwilling to use the same expedient, stood
trembling on the brink of descent, dubious of his
own agility, and dreading the consequence of
such a leap, when a chair happening to pass, he
laid hold on the opportunity, and by an exertion
of his muscles pitched upon the top of the car∣riage,
which was immediately overturned in the
kennel, to the grievous annoyance of the fare,
which happened to be a certain effeminate beau,
in full dress, on his way to a private assembly.</P>
<P>This phantom of a man, hearing the noise
overhead, and feeling the shock of being over∣thrown,
at the same time, thought that some
whole tenement had fallen upon the chair, and,
in the terror of being crushed to pieces, uttered
a scream which the populace supposed to proceed
from the mouth of a woman; and therefore
went to his assistance, while the chairmen, in∣stead
of ministring to his occasions, no sooner re∣collected
themselves, than they ran in pursuit of
their overthrower, who being accustomed to
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
escapes from bailiffs, dived into a dark alley, and
vanishing in a trice, was not visible to any living
soul, until he appeared next day on Tower-hill.</P>
<P>The humane part of the mob, who bestirred
themselves for the relief of the supposed lady, no
sooner perceived their mistake, in the appearance
of the beau, who stared around him with horror
and affright, than their compassion was changed
into mirth, and they began to pass a great many
unfavoury jokes upon his misfortune, which
they now discovered no inclination to alleviate;
and he found himself very uncomfortably beset,
when Pickle pitying his situation, interposed in
his behalf, and prevailed upon the chairmen to
carry him into the house of an apothecary in the
neighbourhood, to whom his mischance proved
a very advantageous accident; for the fright
operated so violently upon his nerves, that he
was seized with a delirium, and lay a whole fort∣night,
deprived of his senses; during which pe∣riod
he was not neglected in point of medicines,
food and attendance, but royally regaled, as ap∣peared
by the contents of his landlord's bill.</P>
<P>Our adventurer having seen this unfortunate
beau safely housed, returned to the scene of the
other calamity, which, as it was no other than
a foul vent, soon yielded to the endeavours of
the family, and was happily overcome, without
any other bad consequence than that of alarming
the neighbours, disturbing the college, and dis∣ordering
the brain of a beau.</P>
<P>Eager to be acquainted with the particular
constitutions of a society which seemed to open
upon him by degrees, Mr. Pickle did not fail to
appear at the next meeting, when several peti∣tions
were laid before the board, in behalf of
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
those members who were confined in the prisons
of the Fleet, Marshalsea, and King's bench. As
those unhappy authors expected nothing from
their brethren but advice and good offices, which
did not concern the purse, their memorials were
considered with great care and humanity; and,
upon this occasion, Peregrine had it in his power
to manifest his importance to the community;
for he happened to be acquainted with the credi∣tor
of one of the prisoners, and knew that gentle∣man's
severity was owing to his resentment at the
behaviour of the debtor, who had lampooned
him in print, because he refused to comply with
a fresh demand, after he had lent him money to
the amount of a considerable sum. Our young
gentleman therefore understanding that the au∣thor
was penitent, and disposed to make a rea∣sonable
submission, promised to employ his in∣fluence
with the creditor towards an accommo∣dation;
and, in a few days, actually obtained
his release.</P>
<P>These social duties being discharged, the con∣versation
took a general turn, and several new
productions were freely criticised; those espe∣cially
which belonged to authors who were either
unconnected with, or unknown to the college.
Nor did the profession of stage-playing escape the
cognizance of the assembly: a deputation of the
most judicious members being sent weekly to
each theatre, with a view of making remarks
upon the performance of the actors. The two
censors for the preceding week were accordingly
called upon to give in their report; and the
plays which they had reviewed were the <HI>Fair Pe∣nit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt</HI>
and the <HI>Revenge.</HI> The person who had
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
examined the former of these tragedies, owned
that he had made no material observations upon
the principal performers: he said he was, upon
the whole, very well entertained, tho' he had,
at first, mistaken Lothario, by his dress, for a
puppet-shew man, hired for the entertainment of
the guests at Calista's wedding; and was after∣wards
a little surprised at his unreasonable de∣mand,
when, in challenging Horatio to single
combat, he desired such an unweildy antagonist
to meet him a whole mile among rocks; an ex∣pedition
which could not be performed without
imminent danger of broken bones.</P>
<P>Peregrine imagining that this remark proceed∣ed
from his ignorance of the play, observed that
the critick might possibly be misled by the words
of the defiance, which run thus:
<Q><L>West of the town a mile, among the rocks,</L>
<L>Two hours ere noon to-morrow I expect thee.</L></Q></P>
<P>“Sir (answered the censor) I am not acquaint∣ed
with the text, else I should have placed my
observation to the account of the author, instead
of the actor, who made a full stop at the word
<HI>town,</HI> and then pronounced—<HI>a mile among the
rocks,</HI> without the least pause of distinction. Per∣haps,
indeed, in the researches of his great pe∣netration,
he may have discovered that this is the
genuine pointing of the poet, and that Lothario
had actually a design upon the shins of Alta∣mont's
friend: in which case he is to be com∣mended
for this, among his other improvements
in the art of acting; yet I cannot approve of his
refinements in the mystery of dying hard; his
fall, and the circumstances of his death, in the
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>
character of this gay libertine, being, in my opi∣nion,
a lively representation of a tinker oppressed
with gin, who staggers against a post, tumbles
into the kennel, while his hammer and saucepan
drop from his hands, makes divers convulsive
efforts to rise, and finding himself unable to get
up, with many intervening hiccups, addresses
himself to the surrounding mob.”</P>
<P>“I confess (replied Pickle) the action of that
same player is not free from unnatural violence
and ridiculous gesticulation: a kind of false fire
in which he finds his account with the audience,
who never fail to honour it with particular marks
of applause; but I think the simile of the tinker
is too severe, and rather one of those grotesque
comparisons which may subject the most grave
and solemn incidents to ridicule, than a fair and
candid illustration of the fact: as for the perver∣sion
of the author's sense, by an impropriety in
the declamation, it so commonly occurs, even
in the most celebrated actors, that one would
think it was an obstacle not to be surmounted:
the delightful lullaby of the stage is an established
recitative, which seems to have been composed
on the supposition that the sentence is always
concluded at the end of the line; and when the
last word happens to begin a new period, the
sense of the whole must suffer accordingly. I
have heard the Aesopus of the age, who values
himself upon accurate speaking, commit innume∣rable
blunders of this kind, one of which I, at
present, recollect, in a passage of a late play,
which he repeated in this manner:
<Q><L>To beg protection for the men who lie,—</L>
<L>Trembling behind their ramparts.</L></Q>
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
Thus he brought the poor Romans under the
imputation of falshood as well as fear; for, ac∣cording
to his pause, they told lies, as well as
trembled behind their ramparts.”</P>
<P>“These are no other than petty oversights;
(said the second censor) that gentleman (take him
all in all) is certainly the most compleat and un∣blemished
performer that ever appeared on out
stage, notwithstanding the blind adoration which
is paid to his rival. I went two nights ago, with
an express design to criticize his action: I could
find no room for censure, but infinite subject for
admiration and applause. In <HI>Pierre</HI> he is great,
in <HI>Othello</HI> excellent, but in <HI>Zanga</HI> beyond all
imitation. Over and above the distinctness of
pronunciation, the dignity of attitude and ex∣pression
of face, his gestures are so just and signifi∣cant,
that a man, tho' utterly bereft of the sense
of hearing, might, by seeing him only, under∣stand
the meaning of every word he speaks!
Sure nothing can be more exquisite than his
manner of telling Isabella how Alonzo behaved
when he found the incendiary letter which she
had dropt by the Moor's direction; and when,
to crown his vengeance, he discovers himself to
be the contriver of all the mischief that had hap∣pened,
he manifests a perfect master piece of
action, in pronouncing these four little mono∣syllables,
<HI>Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w then, 'twas—I.</HI></P>
<P>Peregrine having eyed the critick some mi∣nutes,
“I fancy (said he) your praise must be
ironical, because, in the very two situations you
mention, I think I have seen that player out∣herod
Herod, or, in other words, exceed all his
other extravagances. The intention of the au∣thor
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
is, that the Moor should communicate to
his confidante a piece of information contained in
a few lines, which, doubtless, ought to be re∣peated
with an air of eagerness and satisfaction,
not with the ridiculous grimace of a monkey, to
which, methought, his action bore an intimate
resemblance, in uttering this plain sentence:
<Q><L>—he took it up;</L>
<L>But scarce was it unfolded to his sight,</L>
<L>When he, as if an arrow pierc'd his eye,</L>
<L>Started, and trembling dropt it on the ground.</L></Q>
In pronouncing the first two words, this egre∣gious
actor stoops down, and seems to take up
something from the stage, then proceeding to re∣peat
what follows, mimicks the manner of un∣folding
a letter; when he mentions the simile of
an arrow piercing the eye, he darts his forefinger
towards that organ, then recoils with great vio∣lence
when the word <HI>started</HI> is expressed; and
when he comes to <HI>trembling dropt it on the ground,</HI>
he throws all his limbs into a tremulous motion,
and shakes the imaginary paper from his hand.
The latter part of the description is carried on
with the same minute gesticulation, while he says,
<Q><L>Pale and aghast a while my victim stood,</L>
<L>Disguised a sigh or two, and puff'd them from him;</L>
<L>Then rubb'd his brow, and took it up again.</L></Q>
The player's countenance assumes a wild stare, he
sighs twice most piteously, as if he were on the
point of suffocation, scrubs his forehead, and
bending his body, apes the action of snatching an
object from the floor. Nor is this dexterity of
dumb shew omitted, when he concludes his inti∣mation
in these three lines:
<Q><PB N="114" REF="120"/>
<L>At first, he look'd as if he meant to read it;</L>
<L>But, check'd by rising fears, he crush'd it thus,</L>
<L>And thrust it, like an adder, in his bosom.</L></Q>
Here the judicious performer imitates the con∣fusion
and concern of Alonzo, seems to cast his
eyes upon something, from which they are imme∣diately
withdrawn, with horror and precipitation,
then shutting his fist with a violent squeeze, as if
he intended to make immediate application to
Isabella's nose, he rams it in his own bosom, with
all the horror and agitation of a thief taken in the
manner. Were the player debarred the use of
speech, and obliged to act to the eyes only of the
audience, this mimickry might be a necessary
conveyance of his meaning; but when he is at
liberty to signify his ideas by language, nothing
can be more trivial, forced, unnatural and an∣tick,
than this superfluous mummery. Not that
I would exclude from the representation the graces
of action, without which the choicest sentiments,
cloathed in the most exquisite expression, would
appear unanimated and insipid; but these are as
different from this ridiculous burlesque, as is the
demeanor of a Tully in the rostrum, from the
tricks of a Jack-pudding on a mountebank's stage▪
and for the truth of what I alledge, I appeal to
the observation of any person who has considered
the elegance of attitude and propriety of gesture,
as they are universally acknowledged in the real
characters of life. Indeed I have known a Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣con,
whose limbs were as eloquent as his tongue:
he never mentioned the word sleep without re∣clining
his head upon his hand; when he had oc∣casion
to talk of an horse, he always started up
and trotted across the room, except when he
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>
was so situated that he could not stir without in∣commoding
the company, and in that case he con∣tented
himself with neighing aloud: if a dog hap∣pened
to be the subject of his conversation, he
wagged his tail, and grinned in a most significant
manner; and one day he expressed his desire of
going backwards with such natural imitation of
his purpose, that every body in the room firmly
believed he had actually overshot himself, and
fortified their nostrils accordingly. Yet no man
ever looked upon this virtuoso to be the standard
of propriety in point of speaking and deportment.
For my own part, I confess the player in question
would, by dint of these qualifications, make a
very good figure in the character of Pantaloon's
lacquey, in the entertainment of Perseus and An∣dromeda,
and perhaps might acquire some repu∣tation,
by turning the <HI>Revenge</HI> into a pantomime;
in which cause, I would advise him to come upon
the stage, provided with an handful of flour, in
order to besmear his face, when he pronounces
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le and aghast,</HI> &amp;c. and methinks he ought to
illustrate the adder with an hideous hiss. But
let us now come to the other situation, in which
this modern Aesopus is supposed to distinguish
himself so much, I mean that same <HI>eclaircissement</HI>
comprehended in <HI>Know then 'twas—I.</HI> His
manner, I own, may be altered since I was pre∣sent
at the representation of that performance;
but certain I am, when I beheld him in that cri∣tical
conjuncture, his behaviour appeared to me
so uncouth, that I really imagined he was visited
by some epileptic distemper; for he stood totter∣ing
and gasping for the space of two minutes, like
a man suddenly struck with the palsy; and after
various distorsions and side-shakings, as if he had
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>
got fleas in his doublet, heaved up from his lungs
the letter <HI>I,</HI> like a huge anchor from foul
ground.”</P>
<P>This criticism was acceptable to the majority
of the college, who had no great veneration for
the player in question; and his admirer, without
making any reply, asked in a whisper, of the
gentleman who sat next to him, if Pickle had not
offered some production to the stage, and met
with a repulse. This question was not conveyed
so softly, but that it reached the ears of our ad∣venturer,
who seemed disposed to make some an∣swer,
when he was prevented by the interposition
of another member, who begged the opinion and
advice of the community, touching a pastoral
which he had just composed. Before he had
time to produce the performance to the inspec∣tion
of the society, the chairman observed,
with a splenetic air, that he ought to have em∣ployed
his time in some more profitable amuse∣ment,
than a species of writing in which he had
formerly met with so little success.</P>
<P>“True it is (replied the author) my last pro∣duction
of this kind was not very favourably re∣ceived;
a circumstance intirely owing to the na∣ture
of the subject, which did not at all interest
the passions of the heart: but here, my dear Sir,
the case is otherwise; this pastoral I composed
upon the death of my own grandmother, who
was a woman, in all respects, worthy of the
tears I have shed over her tomb; and this small
composition is the genuine offspring of unfeigned
sorrow: the blots which are still visible on the
paper, indicate the grief with which I wrote it.
<HI>Lachrymae fecêre lituras.</HI> And sure he must have
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>
a flinty heart who can hear it read with an un∣mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stened
eye.”</P>
<P>“If that be the case (said the president) I
wish you would spare us the affliction of hearing
it rehears'd: all of us, I believe, have real
grievances of our own; so that we need not hunt
after imaginary sorrows.” The poet, notwith∣standing
this discouragement, begg'd hard that he
might exhibit a specimen of his performance; and
being restricted to a few lines, he repeated the
following stanzas, with the most rueful emphasis.</P>
<LG>
<L>Where wast thou, wittol Ward, when hapless fate</L>
<L>From these weak arms mine aged grannam tore:</L>
<L>These pious arms essay'd too late,</L>
<L>To drive the dismal phantom from the door.</L>
<L>Could not thy healing drop, illustrious quack,</L>
<L>Could not thy salutary pill prolong her days,</L>
<L>For whom, so oft, to Marybone, alack!</L>
<L>Thy sorrels dragg'd thee thro' the worst of ways?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oil-dropping Twick'nham did not then detain</L>
<L>Thy steps, tho' tended by the Cambrian maids;</L>
<L>Nor the sweet <HI>environs</HI> of Drury-lane;</L>
<L>Nor dusty Pimlico's embow'ring shades;</L>
<L>Nor Whitehall, by the river's bank,</L>
<L>Beset with rowers dank;</L>
<L>Nor where th' Exchange pours forth its tawny
sons;</L>
<L>Nor where to mix with offal, soil and blood,</L>
<L>Steep Snowhill rolls the sable flood;</L>

<L>Ill doth it now beseem,</L>
<L>That thou should'st doze and dream,</L>

<L>Nor to the waddling duck or gabbling goose,</L>
<L>Did she glad sustenance refuse;</L>
<L>The strutting cock she daily fed,</L>
<L>And turky with his snout so red;</L>
<L>Of chickens careful as the pious hen,</L>
<L>Nor did she overlook the tomtit or the wren;</L>
<L>While redbreast hopp'd before her in the hall,</L>
<L>As if she common mother were of all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For my distracted mind,</L>
<L>What comfort can I find?</L>
<L>O best of grannams! thou art dead and gone,</L>
<L>And I am left behind to weep and moan,</L>
<L>To sing thy dirge in sad funereal lay,</L>
<L>Ah! woe is me! alack! and well-a-day!</L>
</LG>
<P>These interjections at the close of this pathetic
elegy, were not pronounced without the sobs and
tears of the author, who looked wishfully around
him for applause, and having wiped his eyes,
asked the chairman's opinion of what he had
read. That cynical gentleman, who had no
great devotion for the Arcadian, answered with
a most equivocal aspect, “Sad, very sad! sad
enough to draw tears from the eyes of a bum∣bailiff.”
But as the performance was submitted
to the criticism of the whole society, the epic
poet stood up, and thus communicated his sen∣timents.</P>
<P>“Without entering upon a minute inquiry into
the poetical merits of particular images, I must
in general observe, that the stanzas are so irre∣gular
<PB N="119" REF="125"/>
in point of measure, as well as in the num∣ber
of the lines, that they cannot be compre∣hended
under any species of the ancient versifi∣cation.
Then there are many dark allusions in
the <HI>Antistrophe,</HI> which no reader can possibly un∣derstand,
together with a catalogue of the names
of places, for which the author seems to have
rambled strangely from his subject, more studious
of making a silly parade of his skill in poetical
geography, than of interesting the passions of
the heart. Indeed, one would be apt to con∣clude
from this circumstance, that his grief was
mere affectation, did not he blubber so piteously
in the last verse. I could have wished, that more
dignity had been preserved in the stanza which
describes the old gentlewoman's benevolence,
and that the last line had been altogether omitted,
because it conjures up a most ridiculous image of
her having actually hatched that same poultry,
which she is said to have tended with such ma∣ternal
care.”</P>
<P>To these animadversions the censured bard re∣plied,
that the verse, in being irregular, the more
nearly resembled the natural exclamations of real
affliction, and that such irregularity had not only
been excused, but even considered as a beauty
in many modern productions. He owned, that
the allusions might be obscure to some readers,
and therefore he intended to explain them in
notes, at the bottom of the page. As to the
topical descriptions which the critic had censured
so severely, he said they were inserted to amuse
and relieve the imagination of the reader, that he
might not be too much affected with the <HI>Pathos</HI>
of the subject; and with regard to the line,
<Q><PB N="320" REF="126"/>
As if she common mother were of all,</Q>
far from carrying that ludicrous implication he
had mentioned, it certainly conveyed the most
amiable and parental idea of the deceased; and
he did not doubt, that he should find his own
opinion confirmed by that of the public, in a very
comfortable sale of the work.</P>
<P>“So, after all this profession of filial tenderness,
(cried the epic bard) the world will have some
reason to say, you wanted to make a job of your
grandmother's death.” “Perhaps (answered the
other) I shall make a present of the copy to my
bookseller.” “If you desire to be thought al∣together
disinterested in the affair, (resumed the
critic) you ought to print a few copies at your
own expence, and distribute them <HI>gratis</HI> among
your friends; by these means, you will have as
good a chance to see your own talents admired,
and the memory of your grandame immortalized,
as if you had sold the property of the piece for a
thousand pounds.”</P>
<P>This proposal seemed to disconcert the elegiac
writer; when the chairman interposing, “Pshaw!
(said he) why the devil should he be more deli∣cate
in that respect, than those people who fit at
the head o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e? In every single circumstance
to which you have objected, he has expressly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not to say copied, the celebrated pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction
of the universal patron.” “What!
(replied the other) you mean the famous Gosling
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Es{que} son and heir of Sir Marmaduke Scrag,
who seats himself in the chair of judgment, and
gives sentence upon the authors of the age. I
should be glad to know, upon what pretensions
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
to genius this preheminence is founded. Do a
few flimsy odes, barren epistles, pointless epigrams,
and the superstitious suggestions of an half-witted
enthusiast, intitle him to that eminent rank he
maintains in the world of letters? or did he ac∣quire
the reputation of a wit, by a repetition of
trite invectives against a minister, conveyed in a
theatrical cadence, accompanied with the most
ridiculous gestures, before he believed it was his
interest to desert his master, and renounce his
party? For my own part, I never perused any
of his performances, I never saw him open his
mouth in public, I never heard him speak in
private conversation, without recollecting and ap∣plying
these two lines in Pope's Dunciad,
<Q><L>Dulness delighted, ey'd the lively dunce,</L>
<L>Remembring she herself was pertness once.</L></Q>
Yet this antick piece of futility will decide dog∣matically
upon the merits of every new work;
and if the author has not previously scratched
himself into his favour, will pronounce upon it,
with all the insolence and contempt of superci∣lious
presumption. Nor is the levity of his head
less provoking than his arrogance and self-conceit;
the very performance which he yesterday ap∣plauded,
will he to-morrow condemn through
mere caprice; and that which he yesterday men∣tioned
in terms of disdain, will he to-morrow
extol to the skies, provided the author will
humble himself so far, as to adore his superior
genius, and meanly beg his protection. Never
did he befriend a man of poetical merit, who did
not court and retain his favour by such slavish
prostitution, except one author, lately deceased;
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
and even he extended his complaisance too far,
in complimental lines, which the warmth of his
gratitude inspired, though he would never submit
to the tame criticisms of his patron, or offer such
an outrage to his own judgment, as to adopt the
alterations which he proposed.”</P>
<P>“One would imagine, (said the chairman)
that you had made an unsuccessful application to
his patronage; but, notwithstanding all this elo∣quent
declamation, the truth of which I shall
not pretend to invalidate, I do aver, that Gosling
Scrag Es{que} is at this day the best milch-cow that
any author ever stroaked: for, over and above
his vanity, which lays him open to the necessities
of all writers who can tickle, though never so
awkwardly, he possesses such a comfortable share
of simplicity, or rather lack of penetration, as
cannot fail to turn to account with those who
practise upon it. Let a scribbler (for example)
creep into his notice by the most abject venera∣tion,
implore his judgment upon some perfor∣mance,
assume a look of awful admiration at his
remarks, receive and read his emendations with
pretended extasy, exert himself officiously about
his person, make interest to be employed in
running upon his errands, bawl for him upon all
occasions in common conversation, prose and
rhime, sit in presence of this great man, with
an apparent sense of his own nothingness, and
when he opens his mouth, listen <HI>with a foolish
face of praise;</HI> happy! if he has an opportunity
to feed him with the soft pap of dedication, or
by affecting an idiotical ignorance of the manners
of life, to insinuate himself into his opinion, as
a person absolutely detached from all worldly pur∣suits;
like a sly brother of the quill, who, in
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
going out, dropped a bank note upon the floor
of his apartment, in such a manner, as that it
could not escape the notice of Gosling, who view∣ing
it accordingly, “Heavens! (said he, with
his hands and eyes lifted up) what philosophical
contempt must that man have for the pleasures
of wealth!” Yes, I insist upon it, these are
arts which will never fail to engage the friend∣ship
of Mr. Scrag, which will be sooner or later
manifested in some warm sine-cure, ample sub∣scription,
post or reversion; and I advise Mr▪
Spondy to give him the refusal of this same pa∣storal:
who knows but he may have the good
fortune of being listed in the number of his beef∣eaters;
in which case he may, in process of
time, be provided for in the customs or church;
when he is inclined to marry h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> own cook-wench,
his gracious patron may condescend to
give the bride away; and finally settle him in his
old age, as a trading Westminster-justice.”</P>
<P>Mr. Spondy thanked the president for his
wholesome counsel, which he assured him should
not be neglected; and the evening being far ad∣vanced,
the assembly broke up, without any other
remarkable occurrence.</P>

and therefore engaged with some booksellers in a
certain translation, which he obliged himself to
perform for the consideration of two hundred
pounds. The articles of agreement being drawn,
he began his task with great eagerness, rose early
in the morning to his work, at which he laboured
all day long, went abroad with the bats in the
evening, and appeared in the coffee-house, where
he amused himself with the news-papers and

his own apartment, and after a slight repast, be∣took

with flatulencies and indigestion, which pro∣duced
anxiety and dejection of spirits, and the
nature of his situation began in some measure to
discompose his brain; a discovery which he no

of a young physician, who was a member of

most intimate acquaintance.</P>
<P>This son of Aesculapius having considered his

namely, want of exercise; dissuaded him from
such close application to study, until he should
be gradually familiarized to a sedentary life, ad∣vised
him to enjoy his friend and his bottle in mo∣deration,
and wean himself from his former cu∣stoms
by degrees; and, above all things, to rise
immediately after his first sleep, and exercise him∣self
in a morning-walk. In order to render this
l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st part of the prescription the more palatable,
the doctor promised to attend him in these early
excursions, and even to introduce him to a cer∣tain
<PB N="125" REF="131"/>
personage of note, who gave a sort of public
breakfasting to the minor virtuosi of the age,
and often employed his interest in behalf of those
who properly cultivated his countenance and ap∣probation.</P>
<P>This proposal was extremely acceptable to our
young gentleman, who, besides the advantage
which might accrue to him from such a valuable
connexion, foresaw much entertainment and sa∣tisfaction
in the discourse of so many learned
guests. The occasions of his health and in∣terest,
moreover, coincided in another circum∣stance,
the minister's levee being kept betimes in
the morning; so that he could perform his walk,
yield his attendance, and breakfast at this philo∣sophical
board, without incroaching a great deal
upon his other avocations.</P>
<P>Measures being thus preconcerted, the physi∣cian
conducted our adventurer to the house of
this celebrated sage, to whom he recommended
him as a gentleman of genius and taste, who
craved the honour of his acquaintance; but he
had previously smoothed the way to this intro∣duction,
by representing Peregrine as a young
fellow of great ambition, spirit and address, who
could not fail to make a figure in the world;
that, therefore, he would be a creditable addi∣tion
to the subordinates of such a patron, and by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> qualifications, intrepidity and warmth of tem∣per,
turn out a consummate herald of his fame.
Upon these considerations, he met with a most
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reception from the entertainer, who
was a well-bred man, of some learning, genero∣sity
and taste; but his foible was the desire of
being thought the inimitable pattern of all three.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="132"/>
It was with a view to acquire and support this
character, that his house was open to all those
who had any pretensions to literature; conse∣quently
he was surrounded by a strange variety
of pretenders; but none were discouraged, be∣cause
he knew that even the most insignificant
might, in some shape, conduce to the propaga∣tion
of his praise. A babbler, tho' he cannot run
upon the scent, may spring the game, and by his
yelping help to fill up the cry: no wonder then,
that a youth of Pickle's accomplishments was ad∣mitted
and even invited into the pack. After
having enjoyed a very short private audience in
the closet, our young gentleman was shewn into
another room, where half a dozen of his fellow-adherents
waited for their Maecenas, who in a
few minutes appeared, with a most gracious as∣pect,
received the compliments of the morning,
and sat down to breakfast, in the midst of them,
without any further ceremony.</P>
<P>The conversation at first turned upon the wea∣ther,
which was investigated in a very philoso∣phical
manner by one of the company, who
seemed to have consulted all the barometers and
thermometers that ever were invented, before
he would venture to affirm that it was a chill
morning. This subject being accurately discussed,
the chief inquired about the news of the learned
world; and his inclination was no sooner ex∣pressed
than every guest opened his mouth, in or∣der
to gratify his curiosity: but he that first cap∣tivated
his attention was a meagre, shrivelled an∣tiquary,
who looked like an animated mummy,
which had been scorched among the sands of the
desert. He told the patron, that he had by ac∣cident
met with a medal, which, tho' it was de∣faced
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>
by time, he would venture to pronounce a
genuine antique, from the ringing and taste of the
metal, as well as from the colour and compo∣sition
of the rust: so saying, he produced a piece
of copper coin, so consumed and disguised by age,
that scarce a vestige of the impression was to be
perceived. Nevertheless this connoisseur pre∣tended
to distinguish a face in profil, from which
he concluded that the piece was of the Upper em∣pire,
and on the reverse he endeavoured to point
out the bulb of the spear, and part of the parazo∣nium,
which were the insignia of the Roman Vir∣tus,
together with the fragment of one fold of
the multicium in which she was cloathed. He like∣wise
had discovered one angle of the letter N, and,
at some distance, an intire I: from these circum∣stances
conjecturing, and indeed concluding,
that the medal was struck by Severus, in honour
of the victory he obtained over his rival Niger,
after he had forced the passes of mount Taurus.
This criticism seemed very satisfactory to the en∣tertainer,
who having examined the coin by the
help of his spectacles, plainly discerned the parti∣culars
which the owner had mentioned, and was
pleased to term his account of the matter a very
ingenious explanation.</P>
<P>The curiosity was circulated through the hands
of all present, and every virtuoso, in his turn,
licked the copper, and rung it upon the hearth,
declaring his assent to the judgment which had
been pronounced. At length, it fell under the in∣spection
of our young gentleman, who, tho' no
antiquarian, was very well acquainted with the
current coin of his own country, and no sooner
cast his eyes upon this valuable antique, than he
affirmed, without hesitation, that it was no other
<PB N="128" REF="134"/>
than the ruins of an English farthing, and that
same spear, parazonium, and multicium, the re∣mains
of the emblems and drapery with which the
figure of Britannia is delineated on our copper-money.</P>
<P>This hardy asseveration seemed to disconcert
the patron, while it incensed the medallist, who
grinning like an enraged baboon, “What d'ye
tell me of a brass farthing? (said he) Did you
ever know modern brass of such a relish? Do but
taste it, young gentleman; and sure I am, if you
have ever been conversant with subjects of this kind,
you will find as wide a difference in the favour be∣tween
this and an English farthing, as can pos∣sibly
be perceived betwixt an onion and a tur∣nip:
besides, this medal has the true Corinthian
ring; then the attitude is upright, whereas that
of Britannia is reclining; and how is it possible
to mistake a branch of palm for a parazonium?”</P>
<P>All the rest of the company espoused the vir∣tuoso's
side of the question, because the reputation
of each was concerned; and the patron finding
himself in the same predicament, assumed a so∣lemnity
of feature, dashed with a small mixture
of displeasure, and told Peregrine, that as he had
not made that branch of literature his particular
study, he was not surprised to see him mistaken
in his opinion. Pickle immediately understood
the reproof; and tho' he was shocked at the va∣nity
or infatuation of his entertainer and fellow-guests,
asked pardon for his presumption, which
was accordingly excused, in consideration of his
inexperience; and the English sarthing dignified
with the title of a true antique.</P>
<P>The next person that addressed himself to the
chief was a gentleman of a very mathematical
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>
turn, who valued himself upon the improvements
he had made in several domestic machines, and
now presented the plan of a new contrivance for
cutting cabbages, in such a manner as would se∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re
the stock against the rotting rain, and enable
it to produce a plenteous after-crop of delicious
sprouts. In this important machine he had united
the whole mechanic powers, with such massy
complication of iron and wood, that it could not
have been moved without the assistance of an
horse, and a road made for the convenience of
the draught. These objections were so obvious,
that they occurred at first sight to the inspector-general
who greatly commended the invention,
which, he observed, might be applied to several
other useful purposes, could it once be rendered
a little more portable and commodious.</P>
<P>The inventor, who had not foreseen these
difficulties, was not prepared to surmount them;
but he took the hint in good part, and promised
to task his abilities anew, in altering the constitu∣tion
of his design. Not but that he underwent
some severe irony from the rest of the virtuosi,
who complimented him upon the momentous im∣provement
he had made, by which a family
might save a dish of greens in a quarter, for so
trifling an expence as that of purchasing, work∣ing
and maintaining such a stupendous machine:
but no man was more sarcastic in his remarks
upon this piece of mechanism than the naturalist,
who next appealed to the patron's approbation
for a curious disquisition he had made, touching
the procreation of muck flies, in which he had
laid down a curious method of collecting, pre∣serving
and hatching the eggs of these insects,
even in the winter, by certain modifications of
<PB N="130" REF="136"/>
artificial heat. The nature of this discovery was
no sooner communicated, than Peregrine, un∣able
to contain himself, burst into a fit of laugh∣ter,
which insected every person at the table, the
landlord himself not excepted, who found it im∣possible
to preserve his wonted gravity of face.</P>
<P>Such unmannerly mirth did not fail to mortify
the philosopher, who, after some pause, during
which indignation and disdain were painted in his
countenance, reprehended our young gentleman
for his unphilosophical behaviour, and undertook
to prove, that the subject of his inquiry was of in∣finite
consequence to the progress and increase of
natural knowledge: but he found no quarter
from the vengeful engineer, who now retorted
his ironical compliments, with great emphasis,
upon this hot-bed for the generation of vermin,
and advised him to lay the whole process before
the Royal Society, which would, doubtless, pre∣sent
him with a medal, and give him a place
among their memoirs, as a distinguished pro∣moter
of the useful arts. If (said he) you had
employed your studies in finding out some ef∣fectual
method to destroy those infects which
prejudice and annoy mankind, in all probability
you must have been contented with the contem∣plation
of the good you had done; but this cu∣rious
expedient for multiplying maggots, will
surely intitle you to an honourable rank in the
list of learned philosophers.” “I don't wonder
(replied the naturalist) that you should be so
much adverse to the propagation of insects, be∣cause,
in all likelihood, you are afraid that they
will not leave you a cabbage to cut down with
that same miraculous machine.” “Sir (answered
the mechanic, with great bitterness of voice and
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
aspect) if the cabbage be as light-headed as some
muck-worm philosophers, it will not be worth
cutting down.” “I never dispute upon cabbage
with the son of a cucumber,” said the fly-breeder,
alluding to the pedigree of his antago∣nist;
who, impatient of the affront, started up
with fury in his looks, exclaiming, “'Sdeath!
meaning me, Sir?”</P>
<P>Here the patron, perceiving things drawing
towards a rupture, interposed his authority, re∣buking
them for their intemperance, and recom∣mending
to them amity and concord against the
Goths and Vandals of the age, who took all
opportunities of ridiculing and discouraging the
adherents of knowledge and philosophy. After
this exhortation, they had no pretence for carry∣ing
on the dispute, which was dr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt, in all ap∣pearance,
tho' the mechanick still retained his
resentment; and after breakfast, when the com∣pany
broke up, accosted his adversary in the
street, desiring to know how he durst be so in∣solent
as to make that scurrilous reflection upon
his family: the fly-fancier, thus questioned, ac∣cused
the mathematician of having been the ag∣gressor,
in likening his head to a light cabbage;
and here the altercation being renewed, the
engineer proceeded to the illustration of his me∣chanicks,
tilting up his hand like a ballance,
thrusting it forward by way of lever, embracing
the naturalist's nose like a wedge betwixt two of
his fingers, and turning it round, with the mo∣mentum
of a screw or peritrochium. Had they
been obliged to decide the dispute, with equal
arms, the assailant would have had a great advan∣tage
over the other, who was very much his in∣fer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or
in muscular strength; but the philosopher,
<PB N="132" REF="138"/>
being luckily provided with a cane, no sooner
disengaged himself from this opprobrious appli∣cation,
than he handled his weapon with great
dexterity about the head and shoulders of his
antagonist, who, finding this shower of blows
very disagreeable, was fain to betake himself to
his heels for shelter, and was pursued by the
angry victor, who chased him from one end o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the street to the other, affording unspeakable sa∣tisfaction
to the multitude, as well as to our hero
and his introductor, who were spectators of the
whole scene.</P>
<P>Thus was our adventurer initiated in the so∣ciety
of Yelpers, tho' he did not as yet fully un∣derstand
the nature of his office, which was ex∣plained
by the young physician, who chid him
for his blunt behaviour in the case of the medal;
and gave him to understand, that their patron's
favour was neither to be gained, nor preserved by
any man that would pretend to convict him of a
mistake: he therefore counselled him to respect
this foible, and cultivate the old gentleman with
all the zeal and veneration, which a regard to his
own character would permit him to pay. This
task was the easier to one of our young gentle∣man's
pliant disposition, because the virtuoso's
behaviour was absolutely free from that insolent
self-conceit, which he could not bear without
disgust: the senior was, on the contrary, mild
and beneficent; and Pickle was rather pleased
than shocked at this weakness, because it flat∣tered
his vanity with the supposition of his own
superior sense.</P>
<P>Cautioned in this manner, Peregrine profited
so much by his insinuating qualifications, that, in
a very little time, he was looked upon as one of
<PB N="133" REF="139"/>
the chief favourites of the patron, to whom he
dedicated a small occasional poem; and every
body believed he would reap the fruits of his
attachment, among the first of the old gentle∣man's
dependants.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="104" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine finding himself neglected by Sir Steady
Steerwell, expostulates with him in a letter; in
consequence of which, he is forbid his house,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his pension, and incurs the reputation of a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unatick.</HEAD>
<P>THIS prospect of success, together with
his expectations from the minister, whom
he did not neglect, helped to comfort him under
the reverse of fortune which he had undergone,
and the uncertainty of the law-suit, which he
still maintained for the recovery of his ten thou∣sand
pounds. The lawyers, indeed, continued
to drain his pocket of money, while they filled
his brain with unsubstantial hope; and he was
actually obliged to borrow money from his book∣seller,
on the strength of the translation, in order
to satisfy the demands of those ravenous harpies,
rather than lay the misanthrope under any diffi∣culties,
or have recourse to his friend Hatchway,
who lived at the garrison, intirely ignorant of
his distress: and this was not at all alleviated by
the arrival of the Indiaman, in which he had
ventured seven hundred pounds, as we have al∣ready
observed; for he was given to understand,
that the borrower was left dangerously ill at
Bombay when the ship sailed, and that his chance
for retrieving his money was extremely slender.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="140"/>
So situated, it is not to be supposed that he led
a life of tranquillity, tho' he made a shift to
struggle with the remonstrances of misfortune:
yet such a gush of affliction would sometimes rush
upon his thought, as overwhelmed all the ideas
of his hope, and sunk him to the very bottom of
despondence. Every equipage that passed him in
the street, every person of rank and fortune that
occurred to his view, recalled the gay images of
his former life, with such mortifying reflection as
stabbed him to the very soul. He lived, there∣fore,
incessantly exposed to all the pangs of envy
and disquiet. When I say envy, I do not mean
that sordid passion, in consequence of which a
man repines at his neighbour's success, howsoever
deserved; but that self-tormenting indignation
which is inspired by the prosperity of folly, igno∣rance
and vice. Without the intervening gleams
of enjoyment, which he felt in the conversation
of a few friends, he could not have supported his
existence; or, at least, he must have suffered
some violent discomposure of the brain: but one
is still finding some circumstance of alleviation,
even in the worst of conjunctures; and Pickle
was so ingenious in these researches, that he
maintained a good battle with disappointment,
till the revolution of the term at which he had
received his pension of three hundred pounds.</P>
<P>However, seeing the day elapse, without touch∣ing
his allowance, notwithstanding his significant
method of presenting himself at the minister's
levee, when the year was expired, he wrote a
letter to Sir Steady, reminding him of his situa∣tion
and promise, and giving him to understand,
that his occasions were such, as compelled him to
demand his salary for the ensuing year.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="141"/>
In the morning after this letter was conveyed,
the author went to his honour's house, in expec∣tation
of being admitted by particular order; but
was mistaken in his hope, the minister not being
visible. He then made his appearance at the
levee, in hopes of being closetted; but though
he took all opportunities of watching Sir Steady's
eyes, he could not obtain one glance, and had
the pleasure of seeing him retire, without being
favoured with the least notice. These circum∣stances
of wilful neglect were not over and above
agreeable to our hero, who, in the agonies of
vexation and resentment, went home, and com∣posed
a most acrimonious remonstrance to his ho∣nour;
in consequence of which, he was not only
deprived of all pretensions to a private audience,
but expressly denied admittance on a public day,
by Sir Steady's own order.</P>
<P>This prohibition, which announced his total
ruin, filled him with rage, horror and despair:
he cursed the porter who signified the minister's
command, threatening to chastise him upon the
spot for his presumption, and vented the most vi∣rulent
imprecations upon his master, to the asto∣nishment
of those who chanced to enter during
this conference. Having exhausted himself in
these vain exclamations, he returned to his lodg∣ings
in a most frantic condition, biting his lips so
that the blood ran from his mouth, dashing his
head and fists against the sides of his chimney,
and weeping with the most bitter expressions of
woe.</P>
<P>Pipes, whose perception had been just suffi∣cient
to let him see, that there was some difference
between the present and former situation of his
master, over-hearing his transports, essayed to
<PB N="136" REF="142"/>
enter his apartment, with a view of administring
consolation; and finding the door locked on the
inside, desired admittance, protesting, that other∣wise
he would down with the bulk-head, in the
turning of an hand-spike. Peregrine ordered him
to retire, on pain of his displeasure, and swore,
that if he should offer to break open the door,
he would instantly shoot him through the head.
Tom, without paying the least regard to this
injunction, set himself at work immediately;
and his master, exasperated at his want of reve∣rence
and respect, which, in his present paroxysm,
appeared with the most provoking aggravation,
flew into his closet, and snatching up one of his
pistols already loaded, no sooner saw his valet
enter the apartment, in consequence of having
forced the lock, than he presented full at his
face, and drew the trigger, but happily the pri∣ming
flashed in the pan, without communicating
with the charge; so that his furious purpose did
not take effect upon the countenance of honest
Pipes, who disregardful of the attempt, though
he knew the contents of the piece, asked, with∣out
the least alteration of feature, if it must be
foul weather through the whole voyage.</P>
<P>Peregrine, mad as he was, repented of his
mischievous intent against such a faithful ad∣herent,
in the very moment of execution; and
had it proved fatal, according to the design, in
all probability he would have applied another to
his own head. There are certain considerations
that strike upon the mind with irresistible force,
even in the midst of its distraction; the momen∣tary
recollection of some particular scene, occa∣sioned
by the features of the devoted victim,
<PB N="137" REF="143"/>
hath often struck the dagger from the assassin's
hand. By such an impulse was Pipes protected
from any repeated effort of his master's rage;
the friendly cause of his present disobedience
flashed upon the conviction of Peregrine, when
he beheld the rugged front of his valet, in which
also stood disclosed his long and faithful service,
together with the recommendation of the de∣ceased
commodore.</P>
<P>Though his wrath was immediately suppressed,
and his heart torn with remorse for what he had
done, his brows remained still contracted; and
darting a most ferocious regard at the intruder,
“Villain! (said he) how dare you treat me
with such disrespect?” “Why shouldn't I lend
a hand for the preservation of the ship, (answered
the unruffled Pipes) when there is more sail than
ballast aboard, and the pilot quits the helm in de∣spair?
What signifies one or two broken voyages,
so long as our timbers are strong, and our vessel
in good trim: if she loses upon one tack, mayhap
she may gain upon another; and I'll be damn'd,
if one day or other we don't fetch up our lee∣way:
as for the matter of provision, you have
started a pretty good stock of money into my
hold, and you are welcome to hoist it up again
when you wool?”</P>
<P>Here Tom was interrupted by the arrival of
Mr. Crabtree, who seeing Peregrine with a pistol
in his hand, and such wild disorder in his looks,
his head, hands and mouth besmeared with blood,
and, moreover, smelling the gunpowder which
had been burnt, actually believed he had either
committed, or was bent upon murder, and, ac∣cordingly,
retreated down stairs with infinite dis∣patch;
though all his speed could not convey
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
him without the reach of Pipes, who overtaking
him in the passage, carried him back into his
master's apartment, observing by the way, that
this was no time to sheer off, when his confort
stood in need of his assistance.</P>
<P>There was something so ruefully severe in the
countenance of Cadwallader, thus compelled, that
at any other time, our hero would have laughed
at his concern; but at present, there was no∣thing
risible in his disposition: he had, however,
laid aside his pistol, and endeavoured, though in
vain, to compose his internal disturbance; for he
could not utter one syllable to the Misanthrope,
but stood staring at him in silence, with a most
delirious aspect, which did not tend to dispel the
dismay of his friend, who, after some recollec∣tion,
“I wonder, (said he) that you have never
killed your man before. Pray, how may you
have disposed of the body?” Pickle having re∣covered
the faculty of speech, ordered his lacquey
out of the room, and in a most incoherent de∣tail,
made Crabtree acquainted with the perfi∣dious
conduct of the minister.</P>
<P>The confident was very glad to find his fears
disappointed; for he had really concluded, that
some life was lost: and perceiving the youth
too much agitated to be treated by him in his
usual stile, he owned that Sir Steady was a rascal,
encouraged Pickle with the hope of being one day
able to make reprisals upon him; in the mean time,
offered him money for his immediate occasions,
exhorted him to exert his own qualifications in
rendering himself independent of such miscreants,
and finally, counselled him to represent his wrongs
to the nobleman whom he had formerly obliged,
with a view of interesting that peer in his behalf,
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
or at least of obtaining a satisfactory explanation
from the minister, that he might take no prema∣ture
measures of revenge.</P>
<P>These admonitions were so much milder, and
more agreeable than our hero expected from the
Misanthrope, that they had a very favourable ef∣fect
upon his transports, which gradually sub∣sided,
until he became so tractable, as to promise
that he would conform to his advice; in conse∣quence
of which, he next morning waited upon
his lordship, who received him very politely, as
usual, and with great patience heard his com∣plaint,
which, by the bye, he could not repeat
without some hasty ebullitions of passionate re∣sentment.
This peer, after having gently disap∣proved
of the letter of postulation, which had
produced such unfortunate effects, kindly under∣took
to recommend his case to the minister, and
actually performed his promise that same day,
when Sir Steady informed him, to his utter asto∣nishment,
that the poor young gentleman was
disordered in his brain, so that he could not pos∣sibly
be provided for in a place of importance,
with any regard to the service; and it could not
be expected that he (Sir Steady) would support
his extravagance from his own private purse:
that he had indeed, at the solicitation of a no∣bleman
deceased, made him a present of three
hundred pounds, in consideration of some loss
that he pretended to have sustained in an elec∣tion;
but, since that time, had perceived in
him such indisputable marks of lunacy, both
by his distracted letters and personal behaviour,
as obliged him to give order, that he should not
be admitted into the house. To corroborate this
assertion, the minister actually called in the evi∣dence
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
of his own porter, and one of the gentlemen
of his houshold, who had heard the execrations that
escaped our youth, when he first found himself
excluded. In short, the nobleman was convinced,
that Peregrine was certainly and <HI>bona fide</HI> mad
as a March hare; and, by the help of this inti∣mation,
began to recollect some symptoms of
distraction which appeared in his last visit; he re∣membered
a certain incoherence in his speech, a
violence of gesture and wildness of look, that
now evidently denoted a disturbed understanding:
and he determined, for his own credit and secu∣rity,
to disentangle himself from such a dangerous
acquaintance.</P>
<P>With this view, he, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imitation of Sir Steady,
commanded his gate to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shut against our ad∣venturer;
so that when he went to know the re∣sult
of his lordship's conference with the mini∣ster,
the door was flung in his face, and the ja∣nitor
told him through an iron grate, that he
needed not give himself the trouble of calling
again, for his lord desired to be excused from
seeing him. He spoke not a word in answer to
this declaration, which he immediately imputed
to the ill offices of the minister, against whom he
breathed defiance and revenge, in his way to the
lodgings of Cadwallader; who being made ac∣quainted
with the manner of his reception, begg'd
he would desist from all schemes of vengeance,
until he (Crabtree) should be able to unrid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
the mystery of the whole, which he did not doubt
of unveiling, by means of his acquaintance with
a family, in which his lordship often spent the
evening at whist.</P>
<P>It was not long before he had the desired op∣portunity;
the nobleman being under no in∣junctions
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
or obligation to keep the affair secret,
discovered the young gentleman's misfortune, by
way of news, to the first company in which he
happened to be; and Peregrine's name was not
so obscure in the fashionable world, but that his
disorder became the general topic of conversation
for a day; so that his friend soon partook of the
intelligence, and found means to learn the parti∣culars
of the minister's information, as above
related. Nay, he was in danger of becoming a
proselyte to Sir Steady's opinion, when he re∣called
and compared every circumstance which he
knew of Pickle's impatience and impetuosity.</P>
<P>Indeed, nothing more easily gains credit than
an imputation of madness fixed upon any person
whatsoever: for when the suspicion of the world
is roused, and its observation once set at work,
the wisest, the coolest man upon earth, will, by
some particulars in his behaviour, convict himself
of the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arge: every singularity in his dress and
manner (and such are observable in every person)
that before passed unheeded, now rises up in judg∣ment
against him, with all the exaggeration of
the observer's fancy; and the sagacious examiner
perceives distraction in every glance of the eye,
turn of the finger, and motion of the head:
when he speaks, there is a strange peculiarity in
his argument and expression; when he holds his
tongue, his imagination teems with some extra∣vagant
reverie; his sobriety of demeanour is no
other than a lucid interval, and his passion mere
delirium.</P>
<P>If people of the most sedate and insipid life and
conversation are subject to such criticisms, no
wonder that they should take place upon a youth
of Peregrine's fiery disposition, which, on some
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
occasions, would have actually justified any re∣marks
of this kind, which his greatest enemies
could make. He was accordingly represented as
one of those enterprizing Bucks, who, after hav∣ing
spent their fortunes in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iot and excess, are
happily bereft of their understanding, and conse∣quently
insensible of the want and disgrace which
they have intailed upon themselves.</P>
<P>Cadwall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der himself was so much affected with
the report, that for some time he hesitated in his
deliberations upon our hero, before he could pre∣vail
upon himself to communicate to him the in∣formation
he had received, or to treat him in
other respects as a man of sound intellects▪ At
length, however, he ventured to make Pickle ac∣quainted
with the particulars he had learn'd, im∣parting
them with such caution and circumlocu∣tion,
as he thought necessary to prevent the
young gentleman from transgressing all bounds of
temper and moderation: but, for once, he was
agreably deceived in his prognostic. Incensed as
our hero was at the conduct of the minister, he
could not help laughing at the ridiculous asper∣sion,
which, he told his friend, he would soon
refute in a manner that should not be very agree∣ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
to his calumniator; observing that it was a
common practice with this state pilot, thus to
slander those people to whom he lay under obli∣gations
which he had no mind to discharge.
“True it is, (said Peregrine) he has succeeded
more than once in contrivances of this kind,
having actually reduced divers people of weak
heads to such extremity of despair, as hath issued
in downright distraction, whereby he was rid of
their importunities, and his judgment confirmed
at the same time: but I have now (thank heaven)
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>
attained to such a pitch of philosophical re∣solution,
as will support me against all his machi∣nations;
and I will forthwith exhibit the monster
to the public, in his true lineaments of craft, per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idy
and ingratitude.”</P>
<P>This indeed was the plan with which Mr.
Pickle had amused himself during the researches
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Crabtree; and by this time it so effectually
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his imagination, that he believed he
should be able to bring his adversary (in spite of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his power) to his own terms of submission,
by distinguishing himself in the list of those who,
at that period, wrote against the administration.
Nor was this scheme so extravagant as it may
seem to be, had not he overlooked one material
circumstance, which Cadwall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der himself did not
recollect, when he approved of this project.</P>
<P>While he thus meditated vengeance, the fame
of his disorder, in due course of circulation, reached
the ears of that lady of quality, whose memoirs have
appeared in the third volume of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se adventures.
The correspondence with which she had honoured
our hero had been long broke off, for the reason al∣ready
advanced, namely, his dread of being exposed
to her infatuating charms. He had been candid
enough to make her acquainted with this cause of
exiling himself from her presence; and the ad∣mitted
the prudence of his self-restraint, although
she could have been very well satisfied with the
continuance of his intimacy and conversation,
which were not at all beneath the desire of any
lady in the kingdom. Notwithstanding this in∣terruption,
she still retained a friendship and re∣gard
for his character, and felt all the affliction of
a humane heart, at the news of his misfortunes
and deplorable distemper. She had seen him
<PB N="144" REF="150"/>
courted and cultivated in the sun-shine of his pro∣sperity;
but she knew from sad experience, how
all those insect followers shrink away in the winter
of distress. Her compassion represented him as
a poor unhappy lunatic, destitute of all the ne∣cessaries
of life, dragging about the ruins of hu∣man
nature, and exhibiting the spectacle of blasted
youth, to the scorn and abhorrence of his fellow-creatures.
A king with these charitable conside∣rations,
she found means to learn in what part
of the town he lodged; and laying aside all su∣perfluous
ceremony, went in a hackney-chair to
his door, which was opened by the ever-faithful
Pipes.</P>
<P>Her ladyship immediately recollected the fea∣tures
of this trusty follower, whom she could not
help loving in her heart, for his attachment and
fidelity, which, after she had applauded with a
most gracious commendation, she kindly inquired
after the state of his master's health, and asked if
he was in a condition to be seen.</P>
<P>Tom, who could not suppose that the visit of
a fine lady would be unacceptable to a youth or
Peregrine's complexion, made no verbal reply to
the question; but beckoning her ladyship with an
arch significance of feature, at which she could
not forbear smiling, he walked softly up stairs;
and she, in obedience to the signal, followed her
guide into the apartment of our hero, whom she
found at a writing-table, in the very act of com∣posing
an eulogium upon his good friend Sir
Steady. The nature of his work had animated
his countenance with an uncommon degree of
vivacity; and being dressed in a neat dishabille,
his figure could not have appeared to more ad∣vantage,
in the eye of a person who despised the
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
tinsel of unnecessary ornament. She was ex∣tremely
well pleased to see her expectations so
agreeably disappointed; for, instead of the squalid
circumstances and wretched looks attending indi∣gence
and distraction, every thing was decent and
genteel; and the patient's aspect such, as be∣tokened
internal satisfaction. Hearing the rustling
of silk in his room, he lifted up his eyes from the
paper, and seeing her ladyship, was struck with
astonishment and awe, as at the unexpected ap∣parition
of some supernatural being.</P>
<P>Before he could recollect himself from his con∣fusion,
which called the blood into his cheeks,
she told him, that, on the strength of old ac∣quaintance,
she was come to visit him, though it
was a long time since he had given her good rea∣son
to believe, he had absolutely forgot that there
was such a person as she in being. After having
made the most warm acknowledgments for this
unforeseen honour, he assured her ladyship, that
the subject of her reproach was not his fault, but
rather his very great misfortune; and that if it
had been in his power to forget her so easily, as
she seemed to imagine, he should never have
given her cause to tax him with want of duty and
respect.</P>
<P>Still dubious of his situation, she began to con∣verse
with him on different subjects; and he ac∣quitted
himself so well in every particular, that
she no longer doubted his having been misrepre∣sented
by the malice of his enemies; and can∣didly
told him the cause and intent of her coming.
He was not deficient in expressions of gratitude
for this instance of her generosity and friendship,
which even drew tears from his eyes; and as to
the imputation of madness, he explained it so
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>
much to her ladyship's satisfaction, that she ev∣dently
perceived he had been barbarously deale
with, and that the charge was no other than a
most villainous aspersion.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all his endeavours to conceal
the true state of his finances, it was impossible
for him to give this detail, without disclosing
some of the difficulties under which he laboured;
and her ladyship's sagacity divining the rest, she
not only made him a tender of assistance, but
presenting a bank-note for a considerable sum,
insisted upon his acceptance of it, as a trifling
mark of her esteem, and a specimen of what she
was inclined to do in his behalf. But this mark
of her benevolence he would by no means re∣ceive;
assuring her, that though his affairs were
at present a little perplexed, he had never felt
the least circumstance of distress, and begging that
she would not subject him to the burthen of such
an unnecessary obligation.</P>
<P>Being obliged to put up with this refusal, she
protested she would never forgive him, should
she ever hear that he rejected her offer, when he
stood in need of her aid; or if in time to come,
he should not apply to her friendship, if ever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
should find himself incommoded in point of for∣tune:
“An over-delicacy in this respect (said
she) I shall look upon as a disapprobation of my
own conduct; because I myself have been ob∣liged
to have recourse to my friends, in such
emergencies.”</P>
<P>These generous remonstrances and marks of
particular friendship, could not fail to make deep
impression upon the heart of our hero, which stil
smarted from the former impulse of her charmes
he not only felt all those transports which a man
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>
of honour and sensibility may be supposed to feel
upon such an occasion, but the sentiments of a
more tender passion awaking in his breast, he
could not help expressing himself in terms adapted
to the emotions of his soul; and at length plainly
told her, that were he disposed to be a beggar,
he would ask something of infinitely more im∣portance
to his peace, than the charitable assistance
sae had proffered.</P>
<P>Her ladyship had too much penetration to
mistake his meaning; but as she did not chuse to
encourage his advances, pretended to interpret
his intimation into a general compliment of gal∣lantry,
and in a jocose manner, desired he would
not give her any reason to believe his lucid in∣terval
was past. “In faith, my lady, (said he)
I perceive the fit coming on; and I don't see
why I may not use the privilege of my di∣stemper,
so far as to declare myself one of your
must passionate admirers.” “If you do, (re∣pled
her ladyship) I shall not be fool enough to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a madman, unless I were assured that your
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proceeded from your love: and that this
was the case, I suppose you would find it difficult
to prove.” “Nay, Madam, (cried the youth)
I have in this drawer, what will convince you of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> having been mad on that strain; and since
you doubt my pretensions, you must give me
leave to produce my testimonials.” So saying,
he opened a scrutore, and taking out a paper,
presented her with the following song, which he
had written in her praise, immediately after he
was made acquainted with the particulars of her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry.</P>

</LG>
<P>Her ladyship having perused this production,
“Were I inclined to be suspicious, (said she)
I should believe that I had no share in producing
this composition, which seems to have been in∣spired
by a much more amiable object. How∣ever,
I will take your word for your intention,
and thank you for the unmerited compliment,
though I have met with it in such an accidental
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
manner. Nevertheless, I must be so free as to
tell you, it is now high time for you to contract
that unbounded spirit of gallantry, which you
have indulged so long, into a sincere attachment
for the fair Emilia, who, by all accounts, de∣serves
the whole of your attention and regard.”
His nerves thrilled at mention of that name,
which he never heard pronounced without agita∣tion;
and rather than undergo the consequence
of a conversation upon this subject, he chose to
drop the theme of love altogether, and in∣dustriously
introduced some other topic of dis∣course.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He writes against the minister, by whose instiga∣tion

Corpus into the Fleet.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MY lady having prolonged her</HI> stay beyond
the period of a common visit, and re∣peated
her protestations in the most frank and
obliging manner, took her leave of our adven∣turer,
who promised to pay his respects to her in
a few days, at her own house. Mean while, he
resumed his task; and having finished a most se∣vere
remonstrance against Sir Steady, not only
with regard to his private ingratitude, but also
to his male-administration of public affairs, he
sent it to the author of a weekly paper, who had
been long a professed reformer in politics; and it
appeared in a very few days, with a note of the
publisher, desiring the favour of a further corre∣spondence
with the author.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="156"/>
The animadversions contained in this small es∣say
were so spirited and judicious, and a great
many new lights thrown upon the subject with
such perspicuity, as attracted the notice of the
public in an extraordinary manner, and helped
to raise the character of the paper in which it
was inserted. The minister was not the last who
examined the performance, which, in spite of
all his boasted temper, provoked him to such a
degree, that he set his emissaries at work, and
by dint of corruption, procured a sight of the
manuscript in Peregrine's own hand-writing,
which he immediately recognized; and, for fur∣ther
confirmation of his opinion, compared with
the two letters which he had received from our
adventurer. Had he known the young gentle∣man's
talents for declamation were so acute, per∣haps
he would never have given him cause to
complain, but employed him in the vindication of
his own measures; nay, he might still have treated
him like some other authors whom he had brought
over from the opposition, had not the keenness of
this first assault incensed him to a desire of re∣venge.
He, therefore, no sooner made this dis∣covery,
than he conveyed his directions to his
dependant the receiver general, who was possessed
of Pickle's notes; and next day, while our au∣thor
stood within a circle of his acquaintance, at
a certain coffee-house, holding forth with great
eloquence upon the diseases of the state, he was
accosted by a bailiff, who entering the room with
five or six followers, told him aloud, that he had
a writ against him for twelve hundred pounds, at
the suit of Mr. Ravage Gleanum.</P>
<P>The whole company were astonished at this
address, which did not fail to discompose the
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
desendant himself, who (as it were instinctively)
in the midst of his confusion, saluted the officer
across the head with his cane; in consequence of
which application, he was surrounded and dis∣armed
in an instant by the gang, who carried him
off to the next tavern in the most opprobrious
manner. Nor did one of the spectators inter∣pose
in his behalf, or visit him in his confinement
with the least tender of advice or assistance; such
is the zeal of a coffee-house friendship.</P>
<P>This stroke was the more severe upon our
hero, as it was altogether unexpected; for he
had utterly forgot the debt for which he was ar∣rested.
His present indignation was, however,
chiefly kindled against the bailiff, who had done
his office in such a disrespectful manner: and the
first use he made of his recollection in the house
to which they conducted him, was to chastise
him for the insolence and indecency of his beha∣viour.
This task he performed with his bare fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,
every other weapon being previously conveyed
out of his reach; and the delinquent under∣went
his discipline with surprising patience and
resignation, asking pardon with great humility,
and protesting before God, that he had never
will ngly and wittingly used any gentleman with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manners, but had been commanded to arrest
our adventurer according to the express direction
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the creditor, on pain of forfeiding his place.</P>
<P>By this declaration Peregrine was appeased,
and out of a delirium of passion, waked to all
the horrors of reflection. All the glory of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was now eclipsed, all the blossoms of his
hope were blasted, and he saw himself doomed
to the miseries of a jail, without the least pro∣spect
of enlargement, except in the issue of his
<PB N="152" REF="158"/>
law-suit, of which he had, for some time past,
grown less and less confident every day. What
would become of the unfortunate, if the consti∣tution
of the mind did not permit them to
bring one passion into the field against another
passions that operate in the human breast, like
poisons of a different nature, extinguishing each
other's effect. Our hero's grief reigned in full
despotism, until it was deposed by revenge;
during the predominancy of which, he consi∣dered
every thing which had happened as a cir∣cumstance
conducive to its gratification: “If I
must be prisoner for life, (said he to himself) if I
must relinquish all my gay expectations, let me at
least have the satisfaction of clanking my chains
so as to interrupt the repose of my adversary;
and let me search in my own breast for that
peace and contentment, which I have not been
able to find in all the scenes of my success. In
being detached from the world, I shall be deli∣vered
from folly and ingratitude, as well as ex∣empted
from an expence, which I should have
found it very difficult, if not impracticable, to
support; I shall have little or no temptation to
mispend my time, and more undisturbed oppor∣tunity
to earn my subsistence, and prosecute my
revenge. After all, a jail is the best tub to
which a cynic philosopher can retire.”</P>
<P>In consequence of these comfortable reflec∣tions,
he sent a letter to Mr. Crabtree, with an
account of his misfortune, signifying his resolu∣tion
to move himself immediately into the Fleet,
and desiring that he would send him some un∣derstanding
attorney of his acquaintance, who
would direct him in the steps necessary to be
taken for that purpose. The Misanthrope, upon
<PB N="153" REF="159"/>
the receit of this intimation, went in person to
a lawyer, whom he accompanied to the spunging∣house,
whither the prisoner had by this time re∣tired;
and Peregrine was, under the auspices of
this director, conducted to the judge's chamber,
where he was left in the custody of a tipstaff;
and after having paid for a warrant of <HI>Habeas
Corpus,</HI> by him conveyed to the Fleet, and de∣livered
to the care of the warden.</P>
<P>Here he was introduced to the lodge, in which
he was obliged to expose himself a full half hour
to the eyes of all the turnkeys and door-keepers,
who took an accurate survey of his person, that
they might know him again at first fight; and
then he was turned loose into the place called the
master's side, having given a valuable considera∣tion
for that privilege. This is a large range of
building, containing some hundreds of lodging-rooms
for the convenience of the prisoners, who
pay so much <HI>per</HI> week for that accommodation.
In short, this community is like a city detached
from all communication with the neighbouring
parts, regulated by its own laws, and furnished
with peculiar conveniences, for the use of the
inhabitants. There is a coffee-house for the re∣fort
of gentlemen, in which all sorts of liquors
are kept, and a public kitchen, where any quan∣tity
of meat is sold at a very reasonable rate, or
any kind of provision boiled and roasted <HI>gratis,</HI>
for the poor prisoners: nay, there are certain
servants of the public, who are obliged to go to
market, at the pleasure of individuals, without
fee or reward from those who employ them: nor
are they cooped up, so as to be excluded from
the benefit of fresh air, there being an open area
of a considerable extent adjacent to the building,
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
on which they may exercise themselves in walk∣ing,
skittles, bowls, and variety of other diver∣sions,
according to the inclination of each.</P>
<P>Our adventurer being admitted a denizen of
this community, found himself bewildered in the
midst of strangers, who, by their appearance,
did not at all prepossess him in their favour; and
after having strolled about the place with his
friend Cadwallader, repaired to the coffee-house,
in order to be farther informed of the peculiar
customs which it was necessary for him to know.</P>
<P>There, while he endeavoured to pick up in∣telligence
from the bar-keeper, he was acco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted
by a person in canonicals, who very civilly ask∣ing
if he was a new-comer, and being answered
in the affirmative, gave him the salutation of
welcome to the society, and, with great hospi∣tality,
undertook to initiate him in the constitu∣tions
of the brotherhood. This humane clergy∣man
gave him to understand, that his first care
ought to be that of securing a lodging; telling
him, there was a certain number of apartments
in the prison let at the same price, though some
were more commodious than others; and that
when the better sort became vacant, by the re∣moval
of their possessors, those who succeeded in
point of seniority, had the privilege of occupying
the empty tenements, preferable to the rest of
the inhabitants, howsoever respectable they might
otherwise be: that when the jail was very
much crowded, there was but one chamber al∣lotted
for two lodgers; but this was not con∣sidered
as any great hardship on the prisoners,
because, in that case, there was always a suffi∣cient
number of males, who willingly admitted
the females to a share of their apartments and beds:
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
not but the time had been, when this expedient
would not answer the occasion, because, after a
couple had been quartered in every room, there
was a considerable residue still unprovided with
lodging; so that for the time being, the last
comers were obliged to take up their habitation
in Mount Scoundrel, an apartment most mi∣serebly
furnished, in which they lay promiscuously
amidst filth and vermin, until they could be bet∣ter
accommodated in due course of rotation.</P>
<P>Peregrine hearing the description of this place,
began to be very impatient about his night's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;
and the parson perceiving his anxiety, con∣ducted
him, without loss of time, to the warden,
who forthwith put him in possession of a paultry
chamber, for which he agreed to pay half a crown
a week. This point being settled, his director
gave him an account of the different methods of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, either singly, in a mess, or at an ordi∣nary;
and advised him to chuse the last, as the
most reputable, offering to introduce him next
day to the best company in the Fleet, who always
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> together in public.</P>
<P>Pickle having thanked this gentleman for his
civilities, and promised to be governed by his ad∣vice,
invited him to pass the evening at his apart∣ment;
and in the mean time, shut himself up
with Crabtree, in order to deliberate upon the
wreck of his affairs. Of all his ample fortune,
nothing now remained but his wardrobe, which
was not very sumptuous, about thirty guineas in
cash, and the garison, which the Misanthrope
counselled him to convert into ready money, for
his present subsistence. This advice, however,
he absolutely rejected, not only on account of
his having already bestowed it upon Hatchway,
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
during the term of his natural life, but also with
a view of retaining some memorial of the com∣modore's
generosity. He proposed, therefore,
to finish in this retreat the translation which he
had undertaken, and earn his future subsistence
by labour of the same kind. He desired Cad∣wallader
to take charge of his moveables, and
send to him such linen and cloaths as he should
have occasion for in his confinement. But,
among all his difficulties, nothing embarassed him
so much as his faithful Pipes, whom he could no
longer entertain in his service. He knew Tom
had made shift to pick up a competency in the
course of his ministration; but that reflection,
though it in some measure alleviated, could not
wholly prevent the mortification he must suffer in
parting with an affectionate adherent, who was
by this time become as necessary to him as one
of his own members, and who was so accustomed
to live under his command and protection, that
he did not believe the fellow could reconcile him∣self
to any other way of life.</P>
<P>Crabtree, in order to make himself easy on
that score, offered to adopt him in the room of
his own valet, whom he would dismiss; though
he observed, that Pipes had been quite spoiled in
our hero's service. But Peregrine did not chuse
to lay his friend under that inconvenience, know∣ing
that his present lacquey understood and com∣plied
with all the peculiarities of his humour,
which Pipes would never be able to study or re∣gard;
and therefore determined to send him back
to his ship-mate Hatchway, with whom he has
spent the fore-part of his life.</P>
<P>These points being adjusted, the two friends
adjourned to the coffee-house, with a view of in∣quiring
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
into the character of the clergyman, to
whose beneficence our adventurer was so much
indebted; and they learned he was a person who
had incurred the displeasure of the bishop in whose
diocese he was settled, and, being unequal in
power to his antagonist, had been driven to the
Fleet, in consequence of his obstinate opposition;
tho' he still found means to enjoy a pretty consi∣derable
income, by certain irregular practices in
the way of his function, which income was chiefly
consumed in acts of humanity to his fellow-crea∣tures
in distress.</P>
<P>His eulogium was scarce finished, when he en∣tered
the room, according to appointment with
Peregrine, who ordering wine and something for
supper to be carried to his apartment, the trium∣virate
went thither; and Cadwallader taking his
leave for the night, the two fellow-prisoners
passed the evening very sociably, our hero being
entertained by his new companion with the pri∣vate
history of the place, some particulars of
which were extremely curious. He told him,
that the person who attended them at supper,
bowing with the most abject servility, and wor∣shipping
them, every time he opened his mouth,
with the epithets of <HI>your Lordship</HI> and <HI>your Honour,</HI>
had, a few years before, been actually a captain
in the guards; who, after having run his career
in the great world, had threaded every station in
their community, from that of a buck of the
first order, who swaggers about the Fleet in a
laced coat, with a footman and whore, to the
degree of a tapster, in which he was n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w hap∣pily
settled. “If you will take the trouble of
going into the cook's kitchen (said he), you will
perceive a beau metamorphosed into a turn-spit;
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
and there are some hewers of wood and drawers
of water in this microcosm, who have had forests
and fish-ponds of their own: yet, notwithstand∣ing
such a miserable reverse of fortune, they are
neither objects of regard or compassion, because
their misfortunes are the fruits of the most vici∣ous
extravagance, and they are absolutely insen∣sible
of the misery which is their lot. Those of
our fellow-sufferers, who have been reduced by
undeserved losses, or the precipitation of unex∣perienced
youth, never fail to meet with the most
brotherly assistance, provided they behave with
decorum, and a due sense of their unhappy cir∣cumstances.
Nor are we destitute of power to
chastise the licentious, who refuse to comply with
the regulations of the place, and disturb the peace
of the community, with riot and disorder.
Justice is here impartially administered, by a
court of equity, consisting of a select number of
the most respectable inhabitants, who punish all
offenders with equal judgment and resolution,
after they have been fairly convicted of the
crimes laid to their charge.”</P>
<P>The clergyman having thus explained the
oeconomy of the place, as well as the cause of
his own confinement, began to discover signs of
curiosity, touching our hero's situation; and
Pickle, thinking he could do no less for the satis∣faction
of a man, who had treated him in such an
hospitable manner, favoured him with a detail o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the circumstances which produced his imprison∣ment:
at the same time, gratifying his resent∣ment
against the minister, which delighted in
recapitulating the injuries he had received. The
parson, who had been prepossessed in favour of
our youth at first sight, understanding what a
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
considerable part he had acted on the stage of
life, felt his veneration increase; and, pleased
with the opportunity of introducing a stranger of
his consequence to the club, left him to his re∣pose,
or rather to ruminate on an event which
he had not as yet seriously considered.</P>
<P>I might here, in imitation of some celebrated
writers, furnish out a page or two, with the re∣flections
he made upon the instability of human
affairs, the treachery of the world, and the teme∣rity
of youth; and endeavour to decoy the
reader into a smile, by some quaint observation
of my own, touching the sagacious moralizer:
but, besides that I look upon this practice as an
impertinent anticipation of the peruser's thoughts,
I have too much matter of importance upon my
hands, to give the reader the least reason to
believe that I am driven to such paultry shifts, in
order to eke out the volume. Suffice it then, to
say, our adventurer passed a very uneasy night,
not only from the thorny suggestions of his mind,
but likewise from the anguish of his body, which
suffered from the hardness of his couch, as well
as from the natural inhabitants thereof, which
did not tamely suffer his intrusion.</P>
<P>In the morning he was waked by Pipes, who
brought upon his shoulder a portmanteau fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led
with necessaries, according to the direction of
Cadwallader; and tossing it down upon the floor,
regaled himself with a quid, without the least
manifestation of concern. After some pause,
“You see, Pipes, (said his master) to what I
have brought myself.” “Ey, ey, (answered
the valet) once the vessel is ashore, what signifies
talking? We must bear a hand to tow her off,
if we can: if she won't budge for all the anchors
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
and capstans aboard, after we have lightened her,
by cutting away her masts, and heaving our guns
and cargo overboard, why then, mayhap, a brisk
gale of wind, a tide, or current setting from
shore, may float her again in the blast of a
whistle. Here is two hundred and ten guineas
by the tale, in this here canvas-bag; and upon
this scrap of paper—no, avast—that's my dis∣charge
from the parish for Moll Trundle—ey,
here it is—an order for thirty pounds upon the
what-d'ye-call-'em in the city; and two tickets
for twenty-five and eighteen, which I lent, d'ye
see to Sam Studding to buy a cargo of rum,
when he hoisted the sign of the Commodore at
St. Catharine's.” So saying, he spread his whole
stock upon the table, for the acceptance of Pere∣grine;
who, being very much affected with this
fresh instance of his attachment, expressed his
satisfaction at seeing he had been such a good
oeconomist, paid his wages up to that very day,
thanked him for his faithful services, and, ob∣serving
that he himself was no longer in a condi∣tion
to maintain a domestick, advised him to re∣tire
to the garison, where he would be kindly
received by his friend Hatchway, to whom he
would recommend him in the strongest terms.</P>
<P>Pipes looked blank at this unexpected intima∣tion,
to which he replied, that he wanted neither
pay nor provision, but only to be employed as a
tender; and that he would not steer his course for
the garison, unless his master would first take
his lumber aboard. Pickle, however, perempto∣rily
refused to touch a farthing of the money,
which he commanded him to put up; and Pipes
was so mortified at his refusal, that, twisting the
notes together, he threw them into the fire with∣out
<PB N="161" REF="167"/>
hesitation, crying, “Damn the money!”
and the canvas-bag, with its contents, would
have shared the same fate, had not Peregrine
started up, and snatching the paper from the
flames, ordered his valet to forbear, on pain of
being banished for ever from his sight. He told
him, that, for the present, there was a necessity
for his being dismissed, and he discharged him
accordingly; but if he would go and live quietly
with the lieutenant, he promised, on the first
favourable turn of his fortune, to take him again
into his service. In the mean time he gave him
to understand, that he neither wanted, nor would
make any use of his money, which he insisted
upon his pocketing immediately, on pain of for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting
all title to his favour.</P>
<P>Pipes was very much chagrined at these in∣junctions,
to which he made no reply; but
sweeping the money into his bag, stalked off, in
silence, with a look of grief and mortification,
which his countenance had never exhibited before.
Nor was the proud heart of Pickle unmoved
upon this occasion: he could scarce suppress his
sorrow in the presence of Pipes, and, soon as he
was gone, it vented itself in tears.</P>
<P>Having no great pleasure in conversing with his
own thoughts, he dressed himself with all conve∣nient
dispatch, being attended by one of the oc∣casional
valets of the place, who had formerly
been a rich mercer in the city; and this operation
being performed, he went to breakfast at the
coffee-house, where he happened to meet with
his friend the clergyman, and several persons of
genteel appearance, to whom the doctor intro∣duced
him as a new mess-mate. By these gen∣tlemen
he was conducted to a place, where they
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
spent the forenoon in playing at fives, an exer∣cise
in which our hero took singular delight; and
about one o'clock a court was held, for the trial
of two delinquents, who had transgressed the
laws of honesty and good order.</P>
<P>The first who appeared at the bar was an at∣torney,
accused of having picked a gentleman's
pocket of his handkerchief; and the fact being
proved by incontestible evidence, he received
sentence: in consequence of which he was im∣mediately
carried to the public pump, and sub∣jected
to a severe cascade of cold water. This
cause being discussed, they proceeded to the trial
of the other offender, who was a lieutenant of a
man of war, indicted for a riot, which he had
committed in company with a female not yet
taken, against the laws of the place, and the
peace of his fellow-prisoners. The culprit had
been very obstreperous, and absolutely refused to
obey the summons, with many expressions of
contempt and defiance against the authority of
the court; upon which the constables were or∣dered
to bring him to the bar, <HI>vi &amp; armis;</HI> and
he was accordingly brought before the judge,
after having made a most desperate resistance with
a hanger, by which one of the officers was dan∣gerously
wounded. This outrage was such an
aggravation of his crime, that the court would
not venture to decide upon it, but remitted him
to the sentence of the warden; who, by virtue
of his dictatorial power, ordered the rioter to be
loaded with irons, and confined in the strong-room,
which is a dismal dungeon, situated upon
the side of the ditch, infested with toads and
vermin, surcharged with noisome damps, and
impervious to the least ray of light.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="169"/>
Justice being done upon the criminals, our
adventurer and his company adjourned to the
ordinary, which was kept at the coffee-house;
and he found, upon enquiry, that his mess-mates
consisted of one officer, two under-writers, three
projectors, an alchymist, an attorney, a parson, a
brace of poets, a bar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>net, and a knight of the bath.
The dinner, tho' not sumptuous, nor very elegantly
served up, was nevertheless substantial, and pret∣ty
well dressed: the wine was tolerable, and all
the guests as chearful as if they had been utter
strangers to calamity; so that our adventurer
began to relish the company, and mix in the con∣versation,
with that sprightliness and case which
were peculiar to his disposition. The repast
being ended, the reckoning paid, and part of the
gentlemen withdrawn to cards, or other avoca∣tions,
those who remained, among whom Pere∣grine
made one, agreed to spend the afternoon in
conversation over a bowl of punch; and the
liquor being produced, they passed the time very
socially in various topicks of discourse, including
many curious anecdotes relating to their own
affairs. No man scrupled to own the nature of
the debt for which he was confined, unless it
happened to be some piddling affair; but, on the
contrary, boasted of the importance of the sum,
as a circumstance that implied his having been a
person of consequence in life; and he who had
made the most remarkable escapes from bailiffs,
was looked upon as a man of superior genius and
address.</P>
<P>Among other extraordinary adventures of this
kind, none was more romantic than the last
elopement atchieved by the officer; who told
them, he had been arrested for a debt of two
<PB N="164" REF="170"/>
hundred pounds, at a time when he could not
command as many pence, and conveyed to the
bailiff's house, in which he continued a whole
fortnight, moving his lodgings higher and higher,
from time to time, in proportion to the decay
of his credit; until, from the parlour, he had
made a regular ascent to the garret. There
while he ruminated on his next step, which would
have been to the Marshalsea, and saw the night
come on, attended with hunger and cold, the
wind began to blow, and the tiles of the house
rattled with the storm: his imagination was im∣mediately
struck with the idea of escaping unper∣ceived,
amidst the darkness and noise of the tem∣pest,
by creeping out at the window of his apart∣ment,
and making his way over the tops of the
adjoining houses. Glow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng with this prospect,
he examined the passage, which, to his infinite
mortification, he found grated with iron-bars on
the outside; but even this difficulty did not divert
him from his purpose. Conscious of his own
strength, he believed himself able to make an
hole thro' the roof, which seemed to be slender
and crazy; and, on this supposition, he barri∣cadoed
the door with the whole furniture of the
room: then, setting himself to work with a poker,
he in a few minutes effected a passage for his
hand, with which he gradually stript off the
boards and tiling, so as to open a sally-port for
his whole body, thro' which he fairly set himself
tree, groping his way towards the next tenement.
Here, however, he met with an unlucky acci∣dent:
his hat, being blown off his head, chanced
to tumble into the court, just as one of the bai∣liff's
followers was knocking at the door; and
this myrmidon recognizing it immediately, gave
<PB N="165" REF="171"/>
the alarm to his chief, who, running up stairs to
the garret, forced open the door in a twinkling,
notwithstanding the precautions which the pri∣soner
had taken, and, with his attendant, pursued
the fugitive thro' his own track. “After this
chace had continued some time, (said the officer)
to the imminent danger of all three, I found my
progress suddenly stopt by a sky-light, through
which I perceived seven taylors, sitting at work
upon a board. Without the least hesitation or
previous notice, I plunged among them, with my
backside foremost; and, before they could recol∣lect
themselves from the consternation occasioned
by such a strange visit, told them my situation,
and gave them to understand that there was no
time to be lost. One of the number, taking the
hint, led me instantly down stairs, and dismissed
me at the street-door; while the bailiff and his
follower, arriving at the breach, were deterred
from entering by the brethren of my deliverer,
who presenting their shears, like a range of
<HI>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aux de frise,</HI> commanded them to retire, on
pain of immediate death: and the catchpole, ra∣ther
ther than risque his carcase, consented to dis∣charge
the debt, comforting himself with the
hope of making me prisoner again. There,
however, he was disappointed: I kept snug, and
laughed at his escape-warrant, until I was or∣dered
abroad with the regiment, when I convey'd
myself in a hearse to Gravesend, where I em∣barked
for Flanders; but, being obliged to come
over again on the recruiting service, I was nabb'd
on another score: and all the satisfaction my first
captor has been able to obtain, is a writ of de∣tainer;
which, I believe, will fix me in this
place, until the parliament, in its great goodness,
<PB N="166" REF="172"/>
shall think proper to discharge my debts, by a
new act of insolvency.”</P>
<P>Every body owned, that the captain's success
was equal to the hardiness of his enterprize,
which was altogether in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ile of a soldier: but
one of the merchants observed, that he must
have been a bailiff of small experience, who
would trust a prisoner of that consequence in
such an unguarded place. “If the captain (said
he) had fallen into the hands of such a cunning
rascal as the fellow that arrested me, he would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have found it such an easy matter to escape;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the manner in which I was caught, is perhaps
the most extraordinary that ever was practised in
these realms. You must know, gentlemen, I
suffered such losses by ins<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring vessels, during the
war, that I was obliged to stop payment, tho' my
expectations were such as encouraged me to ma∣nage
one branch of business, without coming to
any immediate composition with my creditors.
In short, I received consignments from abroad
as usual; and that I might not be subject to the
visits of those catchpoles, I never stirred abroad,
but, turning my first floor into a warehouse, or∣dered
all my goods to be hoisted up by a crane,
fixed to the upper story of my house. Divers
were the stratagems practised by those ingenious
ferrets, with a view of decoying me from the
walls of my fortification. I received innumerable
messages from people, who wanted to see me at
certain taverns, upon particular business: I was
summoned into the country, to see my own mo∣ther,
who was said to be at the point of death.
A gentlewoman, one night, was taken in labour
on my threshold: at another time, I was dis∣turbed
with the cry of murder in the street; and
<PB N="167" REF="173"/>
once I was alarmed by a false fire. But, being
still upon my guard, I baffled all their attempts,
and thought myself quite secure from their inven∣tion;
when one of those blood-hounds, inspired,
I believe, by the devil himself, contrived a snare
by which I was at last entrapped. He made it
his business to enquire into the particulars of my
traffick; and understanding that, among other
things, there were several chests of Florence en∣tered
at the custom-house on my behalf, he or∣dered
himself to be inclosed in a box of the same
dimensions, with air-holes in the bottom, for the
benefit of breathing, and N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. III. marked
upon the cover; and being conveyed to my door
in a cart, among other goods, was, in his turn,
hoisted up to my warehouse, where I stood with
a hammer, in order to open the chests, that I
might compare the contents with the invoice.
You may guess my surprize and consternation,
when, upon uncovering the box, I saw a bailiff
rearing up his head, like Lazarus from the grave,
and heard him declare that he had a writ against
me for a thousand pounds. Indeed, I aimed the
hammer at his head; but, in the hurry of my
confusion, missed my m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rk: and before I could
repeat the blow, he started up with great agility,
and executed his office in sight of several evi∣dences,
whom he had assembled in the street for
that purpose; so that I could not possibly disen∣tangle
myself from the toil, without incurring an
escape-warrant, from which I had no protection.
But, had I known the contents of the chest, by
all that's good! I would have ordered my porter
to raise it up, as high as the crane would permit,
and then have cut the rope by accident.”</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174"/>
“That expedient, (said the knight with the
red ribbon) would have discouraged him from
such hazardous adventures for the future, and
would have been an example <HI>in terrorem</HI> of all
his brethren. The story puts me in mind of a
d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liverance atchieved by Tom Hackabout, a very
stout honest fellow, an old acquaintance of mine,
who had been so famous for maiming bailiffs,
that another gentleman having been ill used at a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-house, no sooner obtained his liberty
than, with a view of being revenged upon the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he, for five shillings, bought one of
Tom's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which sold at a very large discount,
and taking out a writ upon it, put it into the
hands of the bailiff who had used him ill. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, after a diligent search, had an oppor∣tunity
of executing the writ upon the defendant,
who without ceremony, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roke one of his arms,
fractured his skull, and belaboured him in such a
manner, that he lay without sense and motion on
the spot. By such exploits, this hero became
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that no single bailiff would under∣take
to arrest him; so that he appeared in all
public places, untouched. At length, however,
several officers of the Marshalsea-court entered
into confederacy against him; and two of the
number, attended by three desperate followers,
ventured to arrest him one day in the Strand,
near Hungerford-market: he found it impossible
to make resistance, because the whole gang sprung
upon him at once, like so many tygers, and pi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned
his arms so fast, that he could not wag a
finger. Perceiving himself fairly overpowered,
he desired to be conducted forthwith to jail, and
was stowed in a boat accordingly: by that time
they had reached the middle of the river, he
<PB N="169" REF="175"/>
found means to overset the wherry by accident,
and every man disregarding the prisoner, con∣sulted
his own safety. As for Hackabout, to
whom that element was quite familiar, he mounted
astride upon the keel of the boat, which was
uppermost, and exhorted the bailiffs to swim for
their lives; protesting, before God, that they had
no other chance to be saved.</P>
<P>The watermen were immediately taken up by
some of their own friends, who, far from yield∣ing
any assistance to the catch-poles, kept aloof,
and exulted in their calamity. In short, two of
the five went to the bottom, and never saw the
light of God's sun, and the other three, with
great difficulty, saved themselves by laying bold
on the rudder of a dung-barge, to which they
were carried by the stream, while Tom, with
great deliberation, swam across to the Surry shore.
After this atchievement, he was so much dreaded
by the whole fraternity, that they shivered at the
very mention of his name; and this character,
which some people would think an advantage to
a man in debt, was the greatest misfortune that
could possibly happen to him; because no trades∣man
would give him credit for the least trifle, on
the supposition, that he could not indemnify him∣self
in the common course of law.”</P>
<P>The parson did not approve of Mr. Hacka∣tout'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
method of escaping, which he considered
as a very unchristian attempt upon the lives of
his fellow-subjects: “It is enough (said he) that
we elude the laws of our country, without mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣thering
the officers of justice: for my own part,
I can lay my hand upon my heart, and safely say,
that I forgive from my soul the fellow by whom
I was made prisoner, although the circumstances
<PB N="170" REF="176"/>
of his behaviour were treacherous, wicked and
profane. You must know, Mr. Pickle, I was
one day called into my chapel, in order to join a
couple in the holy bands of matrimony: and my
affairs being at that time so situated, as to lay
me under apprehensions of an arrest, I cautiously
surveyed the man through a lettice which was
made for that purpose, before I would venture
to come within his reach. He was cloathed in
a seaman's jacket and troussers, and had such an
air of simplicity in his countenance, as divested
me of all suspicion: I, therefore, without fur∣ther
scruple, trusted myself in his presence, began
to exercise the duty of my function, and had
actually performed one half of the ceremony,
when the supposed woman, pulling out a paper
from her bosom, exclaimed with a masculine
voice, “Sir, you are my prisoner, I have got a
writ against you for five hundred pounds.” I
was thunderstruck at this declaration, not so
much on account of my own misfortune, which
(thank heaven!) I can bear with patience and
resignation, as at the impiety of the wretch,
firstly, in disguising such a worldly aim, under
the cloak of religion; and, secondly, in prosti∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting
the service, when there was no occasion
for so doing, his design having previously taken
effect. Yet I forgive him, poor soul! because
he knew not what he did; and I hope you, Sir
Sipple, will exert the same christian virtue to∣wards
the man by whom you was likewise over∣reached.”</P>
<P>“O! damn the rascal, (cried the knight)
were I his judge, he should he condemned to
flames everlasting. A villain! to disgrace me
in such a manner, before almost all the fashion∣able
<PB N="171" REF="177"/>
company in town.” Our hero expressing a
curiosity to know the particulars of this adven∣ture,
the knight gratified his desire, by telling
him, that one evening, while he was engaged in
a partie of cards, at a drum in the house of a certain
lady of quality, he was given to understand by
one of the servants, that a stranger, very richly
dressed, was just arrived in a chair, preceded by
five footmen with flambeaus, and that he re∣fused
to come up stairs, until he should be intro∣duced
by Sir Sipple. “Upon this notice (con∣tinued
the knight) I judged it was some of my
quality-friends; and having obtained her ladyship's
permission to bring him up, went down to the hall,
and perceived a person, whom, to the best of my
recollection, I had never seen before. However,
his appearance was so magnificent, that I could
not harbour the least suspicion of his true qua∣lity;
and seeing me advance, he saluted me with
a very genteel bow, observing, that though he
had not the honour of my acquaintance, he
could not dispense with waiting upon me, even
on that occasion, in consequence of a letter which
he had received from a particular friend. So say∣ing,
he put a paper into my hand, intimating,
that he had got a writ against me for ten thou∣sand
pounds, and that it would be my interest to
submit without resistance; for he was provided
with a guard of twenty men, who surrounded
the door in different disguises, determined to se∣cure
me against all opposition. Enraged at the
scoundrel's finesse, and trusting to the assistance
of the real footmen assembled in the hall, “So,
you are a rascally bailiff, (said I) who have as∣sumed
the garb of a gentleman, in order to di∣sturb
her ladyship's company. Take this fel∣low,
<PB N="172" REF="178"/>
my lads, and roll him in the kennel: here
are ten guineas for your trouble.” These words
were no sooner pronounced, than I was seized,
lifted up, placed in a chair, and carried off in the
twinkling of an eye: not but that the servants of
the house, and some other footmen, made a mo∣tion
towards my rescue, and alarmed all the
company above: but the bailiff affirming with
undaunted effrontery, that I was taken up upon
an affair of state, and so many people appearing

supposed messenger to be insulted; and he carried
me to the county-jail, without further lett or mo∣lestation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Pickle seems tolerably well reconciled to his cage,
and is by the clergymen entertained with the me∣moirs
of a noted personage, whom he sees by ac∣cident
in the Fleet.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE knight had</HI> scarce finished this narra∣tive,
when our hero was told, that a gen∣tleman
in the coffee-room wanted to see him;
and when he went thither, he found his friend
Crabtree, who had transacted all his affairs, ac∣cording
to the determination of the preceding
day; and now gave him an account of the re∣marks
he had over-heard on the subject of his
misfortune: for the manner of the arrest was so
public and extraordinary, that those who were
present, immediately propagated it among their
acquaintance; and it was that same evening dis∣coursed
upon at several tea and card-tables, with
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>
this variation from the truth, that the debt a∣mounted
to twelve thousand, instead of twelve
hundred pounds: from which circumstance it was
conjectured, that Peregrine was a bite from the
beginning, who had found credit on account of
his effrontery and appearance, and imposed him∣self
upon the town as a young gentleman of for∣tune.
They rejoiced, therefore, at his calamity,
which they considered as a just punishment for
his fraud and presumption, and began to review
certain particulars of his conduct, that plainly
demonstrated him to be a rank adventurer, long
before he had arrived at this end of his career.</P>
<P>Pickle, who now believed his glory was set
for ever, received this intelligence with that dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in
which enables a man to detach himself ef∣fectually
from the world, and, with great tran∣quillity,
gave the Misanthrope an entertaining
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tail of what he had seen and heard since their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st parting. While they amused themselves in
this manner over a dish of coffee, they were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ined by the parson, who congratulated our hero
upon his bearing mischance with such philosophic
quiet, and began to regale the two friends with
some curious circumstances relating to the private
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the several prisoners, as they happened
to come in.</P>
<P>At length a gentleman entered, at sight of
whom the clergyman rose up, and saluted him
with a most reverential bow, which was gra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ously
returned by the stranger, who, with a
young man that attended him, retired to the other
end of the room. They were no sooner out of
hearing, than the communicative priest desired
his company to take particular notice of this per∣son
to whom he had paid his respects: “That
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
man (said he) is this day one of the most flagrant
instances of neglected virtue which the world
can produce. Over and above a cool, discerning
head, fraught with uncommon learning and ex∣perience,
he is possessed of such fortitude and re∣solution,
as no difficulties can discourage, and
no danger impair; and so indefatigable is his hu∣manity,
that even now, while he is surrounded
with such embarassments, as would distract the
brain of any ordinary mortal, he has added con∣siderably
to his incumbrances, by taking under
his protection that young gentleman, who, in∣duced
by his character, appealed to his benevo∣lence
for redress of the grievances under which
he labours from the villainy of his guardian.”</P>
<P>Peregrine's curiosity being excited by this en∣comium,
he asked the name of this generous pa∣tron,
of which when he was informed, “I am
no stranger (said he) to the fame of that gentle∣man,
who has made a considerable noise in the
world, on account of that great cause he under∣took
in defence of an unhappy orphan; and since
he is a person of such an amiable disposition, I
am heartily sorry to find that his endeavours have
not met with that successful issue which their
good fortune in the beginning seemed to pro∣mise.
Indeed, the circumstance of his espousing
that cause was so uncommon and romantic, and
the depravity of the human heart so universal,
that some people, unacquainted with his real cha∣racter,
imagined his views were altogether selfish;
and some were not wanting, who affirmed he
was a mere adventurer. Nevertheless, I must
do him the justice to own. I have heard some of
the most virulent of those who were concerned
<PB N="175" REF="181"/>
on the other side of the question, bear testimony
in his favour, observing, that he was deceived in∣to
the expence of the whole, by the plausible
story which at first engaged his compassion. Your
description of his character confirms me in the
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me opinion; though I am quite ignorant of the
affair, the particulars of which I should be glad
to learn, as well as a genuine account of his
own life, many circumstances of which are by
his enemies, I believe, egregiously misrepre∣sented.”</P>
<P>“Sir,” (answered the priest) that is a piece of
satisfaction which I am glad to find myself ca∣pable
of giving you: I have had the pleasure of
being acquainted with Mr. M—from his
youth, and every thing which I shall relate con∣cerning
him, you may depend upon as a fact
which hath fallen under my own cognizance,
or been vouched upon the credit of undoubted
evidence.</P>
<P>Mr. M—'s father was a minister of the esta∣blished
church of Scotland, descended from a
very ancient clan, and his mother nearly related
to a noble family in the northern part of that
kingdom. While the son was boarded at a public
school, where he made good progress in the
Latin tongue, his father died, and he was left an
orphan to the care of an uncle, who, finding
him determined against any servile employment,
kept him at school, that he might prepare himself
for the university, with a view of being quali∣fied
for his father's profession.</P>
<P>Here his imagination was so heated by the war∣like
atchievements he found recorded in the Latin
authors, such as Caesar, Curtius and Buchanan,
<PB N="176" REF="182"/>
that he was seized with an irresistible thirst of
military glory, and desire of trying his fortune
in the army; and his majesty's troops taking
the field, in consequence of the rebellion which
happened in the year seventeen hundred and
fifteen, this young adventurer, thinking no life
equal to that of a soldier, found means to fur∣nish
himself with a fufil and bayonet, and
leaving the school, repaired to the camp near
Stirling, with a view of signalizing himself in
the field, though he was at that time but just
turned of thirteen. He offered his service to se∣veral
officers, in hope of being inlisted in their
companies; but they would not receive him, be∣cause
they rightly concluded that he was some
school-boy broke loose, without the knowledge or
consent of his relations. Notwithstanding this
discouragement, he continued in camp, curiously
prying into every part of the service; and such
was the resolution conspicuous in him, even at
such a tender age, that after his small finances
were exhausted, he persisted in his design; and,
because he would not make his wants known,
actually subsisted for several days on hips, haws
and sloes, and other spontaneous fruits which
he gathered in the woods and fields. Mean
while, he never failed to be present, when any
regiment, or corps of men, were drawn out to
be exercised and reviewed, and accompanied them
in all their evolutions, which he had learned to
great perfection, by observing the companies
which were quartered in the place where he was
at school▪ This eagerness and perseverance attract∣ed
the notice of many officers, who after having
commended his spirit and zeal, pressed him to re∣turn
to his parents, and even threatened to expel
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>
him from the camp, if he would not comply with
their advice.</P>
<P>These remonstrances having no other effect
than that of warning him to avoid his monitors,
they thought proper to alter their behaviour to∣wards
him, took him into their protection, and
even into their mess; and what above all other
marks of favour, pleased the young soldier most,
permitted him to incorporate in the battalion,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take his turn of duty with the other men. In
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> happy situation he was discovered by a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of his mother, who was a captain in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
and who used all his authority and influence
in persuading M—to return to school, but
finding him deaf to his admonitions and threats,
he took him under his own care, and when the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> marched to Dumblane, left him at Stirling,
with express injunction to keep himself within
the walls.</P>
<P>He temporized with his kinsman, fearing that
should he seem refractory, the captain would
have ordered him to be shut up in the castle; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the desire of seeing a battle, no
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saw his relation marched off the ground,
than he mixed in with another regiment, to
which his former patrons belonged, and pro∣ceeded
to the field, where he distinguished him∣self▪
even at that early time of life, by his gal∣lantry,
in helping to retrieve a pair of colours be∣longing
to M—n's regiment; so that after the
affair, he was presented to the duke of Argyle,
and recommended strongly to brigadier Grant,
who invited him into his regiment, and promised
to provide for him with the first opportunity:
But that gentleman in a little time lost his com∣mand
upon the duke's disgrace, and the regiment
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>
was ordered for Ireland, being given to colonel
Nassau, whose favour, the young volunteer ac∣quired
to such a degree, that he was recommend∣ed
to the king for an ensigncy, which in all pro∣bability
he would have obtained, had not the re∣giment
been unluckily reduced.</P>
<P>In consequence of this reduction, which happen∣ed
in the most severe season of the year, he was
obliged to return to his own country, thro' infi∣nite
hardships, to which he was exposed from the
narrowness of his circumstances; and continuing
still enamoured of a military life, he entered into
the regiment of Scotch greys, at that time com∣manded
by the late Sir James Campbell, who be∣ing
acquainted with his family and character, en∣couraged
him with the promise of speedy prefer∣ment.
In this corps he remained three years,
during which, he had no opportunity of seeing
actual service, except at the affair of Glensheel;
and this life of insipid quiet, must have hung heavy
upon a youth of M—'s active disposition, had
not he found exercise for the mind, in reading
books of amusement, history, voyages, and geo∣graphy,
together with those that treated of the
art of war ancient and modern, for which
he contracted such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an eager appetite, that he
used to spend sixteen hours a day in this em∣ployment.
About that time, he became ac∣quainted
with a gentleman of learning and taste,
who observing his indefatigable application, and
insatiable thirst after knowledge▪ took upon
himself the charge of superintending his stu∣dies;
and by the direction of such an able guide,
the young soldier converted his attention to a
more solid and profitable course of reading▪ So
inordinate was his desire of making speedy advan∣ces
<PB N="179" REF="185"/>
in the paths of learning, that within the com∣pass
of three months, he diligently perused the
writings of Lock, and Malbranche, and made
himself master of the first fix, and of the ele∣venth
and twelfth books of Euclid's elements.
He considered Puffendorf and Grotius with un∣common
care, acquired a tolerable degree of
knowledge in the French language, and his ima∣gination
was so captivated with the desire of
learning, that seeing no prospect of a war, or
views of being provided for in the service, he
quitted the army, and went through a regular
course of university education. Having made
such progress in his studies, he resolved to qualify
himself for the church, and acquired such a stock
of school divinity under the instructions of a learn∣ed
professor at Edinburgh, that he more than
once mounted the rostrum, in the public hall,
and held forth with uncommon applause: But
being discouraged from a prosecution of his plan,
by the unreasonable austerity of some of the
Scotch clergy, by whom, the most indifferent
and innocent words and actions, were often
misconstrued into levity and misconduct; he
resolved to embrace the first favourable oppor∣tunity
of going abroad, being enflamed with the
desire of seeing foreign countries, and actually set
out for Holland, where for the space of two years,
he studied the Roman law, with the law of na∣ture
and nations, under the famous professors
Tolieu and Barbyrac.</P>
<P>Having thus finished his school education, he
set out for Paris, with a view to make himself
perfect in the French language, and learn such
useful exercises, as might be acquired with the
wretched remnant of his slender estate, which
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>
was by that time reduced very low. In his
journey through the Netherlands, he went to Na∣mure,
and paid his respects to bishop Strickland
and general Collier, by whom we was received
with great civility, in consequence of letters of
recommendation, with which he was provided
from the Hague, and the old general assured him
of his protection and interest for a pair of colour,
if he was disposed to enter into the Dutch Service.</P>
<P>Tho' he was by that time, pretty weil cured
of his military Don Quixotism, he would not to∣tally
decline the generous proffer, for which he
thanked him in the most grateful terms, telling
the general that he would pay his duty to him on
his return from France, and then, if he could
determine upon returning to the army, should
think himself highly honoured in being under his
command.</P>
<P>After a stay of two months in Flanders, he
proceeded to Paris, and far from taking up his
ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itation in the suburbs of St. Germ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, ac∣cording
to the custom of English travellers, he
hired a private lodging on the other side of the
river, and associated chiefly with French officers,
who (their youthful s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llies being over) are allow∣ed
to be the politest gentlemen of that kingdom.
In this scheme he found his account so much,
that he could not but wonder at the folly of his
countrymen, who lose the main scope of their
going abroad, by spending their time and fortune
idly with one another.</P>
<P>During his residence in Holland, he had made
himself acquainted with the best authors in the
French language, so that he was able to share in
their conversation; a circumstance from which he
found great benefit; for, it not only improved
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
him in his knowledge of that tongue, but also
tended to the enlargement of his acquaintance, in
the course of which, he contracted intimacies in
some families of good fashion, especially those of
the long robe, which would have enabled him to
pass his time very agreeably, had he been a little
easier in point of fortune: but his finances, not∣withstanding
the most rigid oeconomy, being, in
a few months, reduced to a very low ebb, the
prospect of indigence threw a damp upon all his
pleasures, tho' he never suffered himself to be
thereby, in any degree, dispirited; being in that
respect, of so happy a disposition, that conscious
poverty or abundance made very slight impres∣sions
upon his m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>This consumption of his cash, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
him in some perplexity; and he delibe∣rated
with himself whether he should return to
general Collier, or repair to London, where he
might possibly fall into some business not unbe∣coming
a gentleman; tho' he was very much
mortified to find himself incapable of gratifying
an inor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inate desire which possessed him of mak∣ing
the grand tour, or at least, of visiting the
southern parts of France.</P>
<P>While he thus hesitated between different sug∣gestion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
he was one morning, visited by a gen∣tleman
who had sought and cultivated his friend∣ship,
and for whom he had done a good office, in
supporting him with spirit, against a brutal Ger∣man,
with whom he had an affair of honour
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his gentleman came to propose a party for a
fortnight, to Fontainbleau, where the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urt then
was: and the prop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sal being declined by M—with
more than usual stiffness, his friend was ve∣ry
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gent to know the reason of his refusal, and
<PB N="182" REF="188"/>
at length, with some confusion, said, “Perhaps
your finances are low.” M—replied, that
he had wherewithal to defray the expence of his
journey to London, where he could be furnished
with a fresh supply; and this answer was no sooner
made, than the other taking him by the hand,
“My dear friend, (said he) I am not unacquaint∣ed
with your affairs, and would have offered you
my credit long ago, if I had thought it would be
acceptable; even now, I do not pretend to give
you money, but desire and insist upon it, that
you will accept of the loan of these two pieces of
paper, to be repayed when you marry a woman
with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, or
obtain an employment of a thousand a year.”
So saying he presented him with two actions of
above two thousand livres each.</P>
<P>M—was astonished at this unexpected
instance of generosity in a stranger, and with
suitable acknowledgment, peremptorily refused
to incur such an obligation; but at length, he
was, by dint of importunity, and warm expostu∣lation
prevailed upon to accept one of the actions,
on condition that the gentleman would take his
note for the sum; and this he absolutely rejected,
until M—promised to draw upon him for
double the value, or more, in case he should at
any time want a further supply. This uncom∣mon
act of friendship and generosity, M—af∣terwards
had an opportunity to repay ten-fold,
tho' he could not help regretting the occasion, on
his friend's account. That worthy man having,
by placing too much confidence in a villanous
lawyer, and a chain of other misfortunes, invol∣ved
himself and his amiable lady in a labyrinth
of difficulties, which threatened the total ruin of
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>
his family; M—felt the inexpressible satisfac∣tion
of delivering his benefactor from the snare.</P>
<P>Being thus reinforced by the generosity of his
friend, M—resolved to execute his former
plan of seeing the south of France, together with
the seaports of Spain, as far as Cadiz, from
whence he proposed to take a passage for London
by sea, and with this view, sent forwards his
trunks by the diligence to Lyons, determined to
ride post, in order to enjoy a better view of the
country, and for the conveniency of stopping at
those places where there was any thing remark∣able
to be seen or enquired into. While he was
employed in taking leave of his Parisian friends,
who furnished him with abundant recommenda∣tion,
a gentleman of his own country, who spoke
little or no French, hearing of his intention, beg∣ged
the favour of accompanying him in his expe∣dition.</P>
<P>With this new companion, therefore, he set
out for Lyons, where he was perfectly well
received by the intendant and some of the
best families of the place, in consequence of
his letters of recommendation; and after a
short stay in that city, proceeded down the
Rhone, to Avignon, in what is called the <HI>coche
d'eau;</HI> then visiting the principal towns of
Dauphiné, Languedoc and Provence, he return∣ed
to the delightful city of Marseilles, where he
and his fellow traveller were so much captivated
by the serenity of the air, the good nature and
hospitality of the sprightly inhabitants, that they
never dreamed of changing their quarters, during
the whole winter, and part of the spring: Here
he acquired the acquaintance of the marquis
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
D'Argens, attorney-general in the parliament of
Aix, and of his eldest son, who now makes so
great a figure in the literary world; and when the
affair of father Girard and madamoiselle Cadiere
began to make a noise, he accompanied these two
gentlemen to Toulon, where the marquis was
ordered to take precognition of the facts.</P>
<P>On his return to Marseilles, he found a
certain noble lord of great fortune, under the
direction of a Swiss governor, who had ac∣commodated
him with two of his own relations,
of the same country, by way of companions,
together with five servants in his train. They
being absolute strangers in the place, M—introduced
them to the intendant, and several
other good families; and had the good fortune to
be so agreeable to his lordship, that he proposed,
and even pressed him to live with him in England,
as a friend and companion; and to take upon him
the superintendance of his affairs, in which case,
he would settle upon him four hundred a year for
life.</P>
<P>This proposal was too advantageous to be
slighted by a person of no fortune, or fixed esta∣blishment;
he, therefore, made no difficulty of
closing with it: but as his lordship's departure
was fixed to a short day, and he urged him to
accompany him to Paris, and from thence to
England, M—thought it would be improper
and indecent to interfere with the office of his
governor, who might take umbrage at his favour,
and therefore excused himself from a compliance
with his lordship's request, until his minority
should be expired, as he was within a few months
of being of age. However, he repeated his im∣portunities
so earnestly, and the governor joined
<PB N="185" REF="191"/>
in the request, with such appearance of cordiality,
that he was prevailed upon to comply with their
joint desire; and, in a few days, set out with
them for Paris, by the way of Lyons. But be∣fore
they had been three days in this city, M—perceived
a total change in the behaviour of the
Swiss and his two relations, who, in all probabi∣lity,
became jealous of his influence with his
lordship; and he no sooner made this discovery,
than he resolved to withdraw himself from such a
disagreeable participation of that young noble∣man's
favour. He therefore, in spite of all his
lordship's intreaties and remonstrances, quitted
him for the present; alledging, as a pretext, that
he had a longing desire to see Switzerland and
the banks of the Rhine, and promising to meet
him again in England.</P>
<P>This his intention being made known to the
governor and his friends, their countenances im∣mediately
cleared up, their courtesy and com∣plaisance
returned, and they even furnished him
with letters for Geneva, Lausane, Bern, and
Soleures; in consequence of which, he met with
unusual civilities at these places. Having made
this tour with his Scotch friend, (who came up
to him before he left Lyons) and visited the most
considerable towns on both fides of the Rhine,
and the courts of the Electors Palatine, Mentz,
and Cologn, he arrived in Holland; and from
thence, thro' the Netherlands, repaired to Lon∣don,
where he found my lord just returned from
Paris.</P>
<P>His lordship received him with expressions of
uncommon joy, would not suffer him to stir from
him for several days, and introduced him to his
relations.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="192"/>
M—accompanied his lordship from London
to his country-seat, where he was indeed treated
with great friendship and confidence, and con∣sulted
in every thing; but the noble peer never
once made mention of the annuity which he had
promised to settle upon him; nor did M—re∣mind
him of it, because he conceived it was his
affair to fulfil his engagements of his own ac∣cord.
M—being tired of the manner of liv∣ing
at this place, made an excursion to Bath,
where he staid about a fortnight, to partake of
the diversions; and, upon his return, found his
lordship making dispositions for another journey
to Paris.</P>
<P>Surprised at this sudden resolution, he endea∣voured
to dissuade him from it; but his remon∣strances
were rendered ineffectual by the insinua∣tions
of a foreigner, who had come over with him,
and filled his imagination with extravagant notions
of pleasure, infinitely superior to any which he
could enjoy while he was in the trammels, and
under the restraints of a governor. He, there∣fore,
turned a deaf ear to all M—'s arguments,
and int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eated him to accompany him in the
journey: but this gentleman, foreseeing that a
young man, like my lord, of strong passions,
and easy to be misled, would, in all probability,
squander away great sums of money, in a way
that would neither do credit to himself, or to
those who were concerned with him, resisted all
his solicitations, on pretence of having business of
consequence at London; and afterwards had rea∣son
to be extremely well pleased with his own
conduct in this particular.</P>
<P>Before he set out on this expedition, M—, in
justice to himself, reminded him of the proposal
<PB N="187" REF="193"/>
which he had made to him at Marseilles, desiring
to know if he had altered his design in that par∣ticular;
in which case, he would turn his thoughts
some other way; as he would not in the least be
thought to intrude or pin himself upon any man.
My lord protested, in the most solemn man∣ner,
that he still continued in his former reso∣lution;
and again beseeching him to bear him
company into France, promised that every thing
should be settled to his satisfaction, upon their
return to England. M—, however, still per∣sisted
in his refusal, for the abovementioned rea∣sons:
and tho' he never heard more of the an∣nuity,
he nevertheless continued to serve his lord∣ship
with his advice and good offices ever after; par∣ticularly
in directing his choice to an alliance with
a lady of eminent virtue, the daughter of a noble
lord, more conspicuous for his shining parts than
the splendor of his titles, (a circumstance upon
which he always reflected with particular satis∣faction,
as well on account of the extraordinary
merit of the lady, as because it vested in her
children a considerable part of that great estate,
which, of right, belonged to her grandmother)
and afterwards put him in a way to retrieve
his estate from a heavy load of debt he had con∣tracted.
When my lord set out on his Paris ex∣pedition,
the money M—had received from his
generous friend at Paris was almost reduced to the
last guinea. He had not yet reaped the least
benefit from his engagements with his lordship;
and disdaining to ask for a supply from him, he
knew not how to subsist, with any degree of
credit, 'till his return.</P>
<P>This uncomfortable prospect was the more
disagreeable to him, as, at that time of life, he
<PB N="188" REF="194"/>
was much inclined to appear in the gay world,
had contracted a taste for plays, opera's, and other
public diversions, and acquired an acquaintance
with many people of good fashion, which could
not be maintained without a considerable expence.
In this emergency, he thought he could not em∣ploy
his idle time more profitably than in trans∣lating,
from foreign languages, such books as were
then chiefly in vogue; and upon application to a
friend▪ who was a man of letters, he was furnished
with as much business of that kind as he could pos∣sibly
manage, and wrote some pamphlets on the
reigning controversies of that time, that had the
good fortune to please. He was also concerned
in a monthly journal of literature, and the work
was carried on by the two friends jointly, tho'
M—did not at all appear in the partnership.
By these means he not only spent his mornings
in useful exercise, but supplied himself with mo∣ney
for what the French call the <HI>menus plaisirs,</HI>
d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring the whole summer. He frequented all the
assemblies in and about London, and considerably
enlarged his acquaintance among the fair sex.</P>
<P>He had, upon his first arrival in England, be∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me
acquainted with a lady at an assembly not
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from London; and tho', at that time, he had
n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oughts of extending his views farther th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the usual g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antry of the place, he met with such
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> marks of her regard in the sequel,
and was so particularly encouraged by the advice
of another lady, with whom he had been intimate
in France, and who was now of their parties, that
he could not help entertaining hopes of making an
impression upon the heart of his agreeable partner,
who was a young lady of an ample fortune, and
great expectations. He, therefore, cultivated her
good graces with all the assiduity and address of
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
which he was master; and succeeded so well in
his endeavours, that after a due course of attend∣ance,
and the death of an aunt, by which she
received an accession of fortune, to the amount of
three and twenty thousand pounds, he ventured
to declare his passion, and she not only heard
him with patience and approbation, but also re∣plied
in terms adequate to his warmest wish.</P>
<P>Finding himself so favourably received, he
pressed her to secure his happiness by marriage;
but, to this proposal, she objected the recency of
her kinswoman's death, which would have ren∣dered
such a step highly indecent, and the dis∣pleasure
of her other relations, from whom she
had still greater expectations, and who at that
time importuned her to marry a cousin of her
own, whom she could not like. However, that
M—might have no cause to repine at her delay,
she freely entered with him into an intimacy of
correspondence; during which, nothing could
have added to their mutual felicity, which was
the more poignant and resined, from the myste∣rious
and romantic manner of their enjoying it;
for, tho' he publickly visited her as an acquain∣tance,
his behaviour, on these occasions, was al∣ways
so distant, respectful, and reserved, that the
rest of the company could not possibly suspect the
nature of their reciprocal attachment: in conse∣quence
of which, they used to have private in∣terviews,
unknown to every soul upon earth, ex∣cept
her maid, who was necessarily intrusted with
the secret.</P>
<P>In this manner they enjoyed the conversation of
each other for above twelve months, without the
least interruption; and tho' the stability of Mr.
M—'s fortune intirely depended upon their mar∣riage,
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
yet as he perceived his mistress so averse to
it, he never urged it with vehemence, nor was at
all anxious on that score; being easily induced to
defer a ceremony which, as he then thought,
could in no shape have added to their sati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>faction,
tho' he hath since altered his sentiments.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, his indulgent mistress, in
order to set his mind at ease in that particular,
and in full confidence of his honour, insisted on
his accepting a de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of gift of her whole fortune,
in consideration of their intended marriage; and
after some difficulty, he was prevailed upon to
receive this proof of her esteem, well knowing
that it would still be in his power to return the
obligation. Tho' she often intreated him to take
upon himself the intire administration of her
finances, and upon divers occasions pressed him
to accept of large sums, he never once abused
her generous disposition, or solicited her for
money, except for some humane purpose, which
she was always more ready to fulfil than he to
propose.</P>
<P>In the course of this correspondence, he be∣came
acquainted with some of her female rela∣tions;
and, among the rest, with a young lady,
so eminently adorned with all the qualifications of
mind and person, that, notwithstanding all his
philosophy and caution, he could not behold and
converse with her, without being deeply smitten
with her charms. He did all in his power to dis∣courage
this dangerous invasion in the beginning,
and to conceal the least symptom of it from her
relation: he summoned all his reflection to his
aid; and thinking it would be base and dishonest
to cherish any sentiment, repugnant to the affec∣tion
which he owed to a mistress, who had placed
such unlimited confidence in him, he attempted
<PB N="191" REF="197"/>
to stifle the infant flame by avoiding the amiable
inspirer of it. But the passion had taken too
deep a root in his heart, to be so easily extirpated:
his absence from the dear object, increased the
impatience of his love. The intestine conflict
between that and gratitude, deprived him of his
rest and appetite. He was, in a short time,
emaciated by continual watching, anxiety, and
want of nourishment; and so much altered from
his usual chearfulness, that his mistress being sur∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ised
and alarmed at the change, which, from
the symptoms, she judged was owing to some
uneasiness of mind, took all imaginable pains to
discover the càuse.</P>
<P>In all probability, it did not escape her pene∣tration;
for she, more than once, asked if he was
in love with her cousin; protesting that, far from
being an obstacle to his happiness, she would, in
that case, be an advocate for his passion. How∣ever,
this declaration was never made without
manifest signs of anxiety and uneasiness, which
made such an impression upon the heart of M—,
that he resolved to sacrifice his happiness, and even
his life, rather than take any step which might be
construed into an injury or insult to a person who
had treated him with such generosity and good∣ness.</P>
<P>In consequence of this resolution, he formed
another which was to go abroad, under pretence
of recovering his health, but in reality, to avoid
the temptation, as well as the suspicion of being
inconstant; and in this design he was confirmed
by his physician, who actually thought him in the
first stage of a consumption, and therefore advis∣ed
him to repair to the south of France. He
communicated his design, with the doctor's opi∣nion,
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
to the lady, who agreed to it with much less
difficulty than he found in conquering his own
reluctance, at parting with the dear object of his
love. The consent of his generous mistress being
obtained, he waited upon her with the instrument
whereby she had made the conveyance of her for∣tune
to him; and all his remonstrances being in∣sufficient
to persuade her to take it back, he can∣celled
it in her presence, and placed it in that
state, upon her toilet, while she was dressing;
whereupon she shed a torrent of tears, saying she
now plainly perceived that he wanted to tear
himself from her, and that his affections were
settled upon another. He was sensibly affected
by this proof of her concern; and endeavoured
to calm the perturbation of her mind, by vow∣ing
eternal fidelity, and pressing her to accept of
his hand in due form, before his departure. By
these means her transports were quieted for the
present, and the marriage deferred, for the same
prudential reasons which had hitherto prevented
it.</P>
<P>Matters being thus compromised, and the day
fixed for his departure, she, together with
her faithful maid, one morning visited him
for the first time at his own lodgings; and
after breakfast, desiring to speak with him in pri∣vate,
he conducted her into another room, where
assuming an unusual gravity of aspect, “My dear
M—(said she) you are now going to leave
me, and God alone knows if ever we shall meet
again: therefore, if you really love me with that
tenderness which you profess, you will accept of
this mark of my friendship and unalterable affec∣tion:
it will at least be a provision for your jour∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y;
and if any accident should befal me, before
I have the happiness of receiving you again into
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>
my arms, I shall have the satisfaction of knowing
that you are not altogether without resource.”
So saying, she put an embroidered pocket-book
into his hand. He expressed the high sense he
had of her generosity and affection in the most
pathetic terms, and begg'd leave to suspend his
acceptance, until he should know the contents of
her present, which was so extraordinary, that he
absolutely refused to receive it: he was, how∣ever,
by her repeated intreaties, in a manner
compelled to receive about one half, and she af∣terwards
insisted upon his taking a reinforcement
of a considerable sum for the expence of his
journey.</P>
<P>Having stayed with her ten days beyond the
time he had fixed for his departure, and settled
the method of their correspondence, he took his
leave with an heart full of sorrow, anxiety and
distraction, produced from the different sugge∣stions
of his duty and love. He then set out for
France, and after a short stay at Paris, proceeded
for Aix in Provence, and from thence to Mar∣seilles,
at which two places he continued for
some months: but nothing he met with being
able to dissipate those melancholy ideas which
still preyed upon his imagination, and affected his
spirits, he endeavoured to elude them with a suc∣cession
of new objects; and with that view, per∣suaded
a counsellor of the parliament of Aix, a
man of great worth, learning and good humour,
to accompany him, in making a tour of those parts
of France which he had not yet seen. On their
return from this excursion, they found at Aix an
Italian Abbé, a person of character, and great
knowledge of men and books, who having tra∣velled
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
all over Germany and France, was so far
on his return to his own country.</P>
<P>M—having, by means of his friend the
counsellor, contracted an acquaintance with this
gentleman, and being desirous of seeing some
parts of Italy, particularly the carnival at Venice,
they set out together from Marseilles, in a tartan,
for Genoa, coasting it all the way, and lying
on shore every night. Having shewn him what
was most remarkable in this city, his friend the
Abbé was so obliging, as to conduct him thro'
Tuscany, and the most remarkable cities in Lom∣bardy,
to Venice, where M—insisted upon
defraying the expence of the whole tour, in con∣sideration
of the Abbé's complaisance, which had
been of infinite service to him, in the course of
this expedition. Having remained five weeks at
Venice, he was preparing to set out for Rome
with some English gentlemen whom he had met
by accident, when he was all of a sudden ob∣liged
to change his resolution, by some disagree∣able
letters which he received from London.
He had, from his first departure, corresponded
with his generous, though inconstant mistress,
with a religious exactness and punctuality; nor
was she, for some time, less observant of the
agreement they had made. Nevertheless, she,
by degrees, became so negligent and cold in her
expression, and so slack in her correspondence,
that he could not help observing and upbraiding
her with such indifference; and her endeavours
to palliate it were supported by pretexts so frivo∣lous,
as to be easily seen through by a lover of
very little discernment.</P>
<P>While he tortured himself with conjectures
about the cause of this unexpected change, he
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eceived such intelligence from England, as,
when joined with what he himself had perceived,
by her manner of writing, left him little or no
room to doubt of her fickleness and inconstancy.
Nevertheless, as he knew by experience, that in∣formations
of that kind are not to be intirely re∣lied
upon, he resolved to be more certainly ap∣prized;
and for that end, departed immediately
for London, by the way of Tirol, Bavaria, Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace
and Paris.</P>
<P>On his arrival in England, he learned with in∣finite
concern, that his intelligence had not been
at all exaggerated; and his sorrow was inexpres∣sible,
to find a person, endowed with so many
other noble and amiable qualities seduced into
an indiscretion, that, of necessity, must ruin the
whole plan which had been concerted between
them for their mutual happiness. She made
several attempts, by letters and interviews, to
palliate her conduct, and soften him into a recon∣ciliation;
but his honour being concerned, he
remained deaf to all her intreaties and proposals.
Nevertheless, I have often heard him say, that
he could not help loving her, and revering the
memory of a person to whose generosity and
goodness he owed his fortune, and one whose
foibles were over balanced by a thousand good
qualities. He often insisted on a restitution; but,
far from complying with that proposal, she hath
afterwards often endeavoured to lay him under
yet greater obligations of the same kind, and
importuned him, with the warmest solicitations,
to renew their former correspondence, which he
as often declined.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="202"/>
M—took this instance of the inconstancy
of the sex so much to heart, that he had almost
resolved, for the future, to keep clear of all en∣gagements
for life, and returned to Paris, in or∣der
to dissipate his anxiety, where he hired an
apartment in one of the academies in the ex∣ercises
whereof he took singular delight. Dur∣ing
his residence at this place, he had the good
fortune to ingratiate himself with a great general,
a descendant of one of the most ancient and il∣lustrious
families in France; having attracted his
notice by some remarks he had written on Fo∣lard's
Polybius, which were accidentally shewn
to that great man by one of his aids du camp,
who was a particular friend of M—. The
favour he had thus acquired, was strengthened by
his assiduities and attention. Upon his return to
London, he sent some of Handel's newest com∣positions
to the prince, who was particularly fond
of that gentleman's productions; together with
Clark's edition of Caesar; and in the spring of
the same year, before the French army took the
field, he was honoured with a most obliging let∣ter
from the prince, inviting him to come over,
if he wanted to see the operations of the cam∣paign,
and desring he would give himself no
trouble about his equipage.</P>
<P>M—having still some remains of a military
disposition, and conceiving this to be a more fa∣vourable
opportunity than any he should ever
meet with again, readily embraced the offer, and
sacrificed the soft delights of love, which at that
time he enjoyed without controul, to an eager,
laborious and dangerous curi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sity. In that and
the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowing campaign, during which he was
present at the siege of Philipsburg, and several
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>
other actions, he enlarged his acquaintance among
the French officers, especially those of the graver
sort, who had a taste for books and literature;
and the friendship and interest of those gentlemen
were afterwards of singular service to him, tho'
in an affair altogether foreign from their pro∣fession.</P>
<P>He had all along made diligent inquiry into the
trade and manufactures of the countries through
which he had occasion to travel, more particu∣larly
those of Holland, England and France;
and as he was well acquainted with the revenue
and farms of this last kingdom, he saw with con∣cern
the great disadvantages under which our to∣bacco-trade
(the most considerable branch of our
commerce with that people) was carried on;
what inconsiderable returns were made to the
planters, out of the low price given by the French
company; and how much it was in the power
of that company to reduce it still lower. M—had
formed a scheme to remedy this evil, so far
as it related to national loss or gain, by not per∣mitting
the duty of one penny in the pound, old
subsidy, to be drawn back, on tobacco re ex∣ported.
He demonstrated to the ministry of that
time, that so inconsiderable a duty could not in
the least diminish the demand from abroad, which
was the only circumstance to be apprehended,
and that the yearly produce of that revenue would
amount to one hundred and twenty thousand
pounds, without one shilling additional expence
to the public: but the ministry having the excise∣scheme
then in contemplation, could think of no
other, till that should be tried; and that project hav∣ing
miscarried, he renewed his application, when
they approved of his scheme in every particular,
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
but discovered a surprising backwardness to carry
it into execution.</P>
<P>His expectations in this quarter being disap∣pointed,
he, by the interposition of his friends,
presented a plan to the French company, in which
he set forth the advantages that would accrue to
themselves, from fixing the price, securing that
sort of tobacco which best suited the taste of the
public and their manufacture; and finally, pro∣posed
to furnish them with any quantity, at
the price which they paid in the port of Lon∣don.</P>
<P>After some dispute, they agreed to his pro∣posal,
and contracted with him for fifteen thou∣sand
hogsheads a year, for which they obliged
themselves to pay ready money, on its arrival in
any one or more convenient ports in the south or
western coasts of Great Britain, that he should
please to fix upon for that purpose. M—no
sooner obtained this contract, than he immedi∣ately
set out for America, in order to put it in
execu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion; and, by way of companion, carried
with him a little French abbé, a man of humour,
wit and learning, with whom he had been long
acquainted, and for whom he had done many
good offices.</P>
<P>On his arrival in Virginia, which opportunely
happened at a time when all the gentlemen were
assembled in the capital of that province, he pub∣lished
a memorial, representing the disadvantages
under which their trade was carried on, the true
method of redressing their own grievances in
that respect, and proposing to contract with them
for the yearly quantity of fifteen thousand hogs∣heads
of such tobacco as was fit for the French
market, at a price which he demonstrated to be
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
considerably greater than that which they had
formerly received.</P>
<P>This remonstrance met with all the success
and encouragement he could expect: the prin∣cipal
planters seeing their own interest concern∣ed,
readily assented to the proposal, which, by
their influence, was also relished by the rest;
and the only difficulty that remained, related to
the security for payment of the bills on the ar∣rival
of the tobacco in England, and to the time
stipulated for the continuance of the contract.</P>
<P>In order to remove these objections, Mr. M—returned
to Europe, and found the French com∣pany
of farmers disposed to agree to every thing
he desired for facilitating the execution of the
contract, and perfectly well pleased with the
sample which he had already sent: but his good
friend the abbé, (whom he had left behind him in
America) by an unparalleled piece of treachery,
found means to overturn the whole project. He
secretly wrote a memorial to the company, im∣porting,
that he found by experience, M—could
afford to furnish them at a much lower
price than that which they had agreed to give;
and that, by being in possession of the contract
for five years, as was intended according to the
proposal, he would have the company so much in
his power, that they must afterwards submit to
any price he should please to impose; and that if
they thought him worthy of such a trust, he
would undertake to furnish them at an easier rate,
in conjunction with some of the leading men in
Virginia and Maryland, with whom, he said, he
had already concerted measures for that purpose.</P>
<P>The company were so much alarmed at these
insinuations, that they declined complying with
<PB N="200" REF="206"/>
Mr. M—'s demands until the abbé's return;
and though they afterwards used all their endea∣vours
to persuade him to be concerned with that
little traitor in his undertaking, (by which he
might still have been a very considerable gainer)
he resisted all their solicitations, and plainly told
them in the abbé's presence, that he would ne∣ver
prostitute his own principles so far, as to
enter into engagements of any kind with a person
of his character, much less in a scheme that had
a manifest tendency to lower the market-price of
tobacco in England.</P>
<P>Thus ended a project the most extensive, sim∣ple
and easy, and (as appeared by the trial made)
the best calculated to raise an immense fortune,
of any that was ever undertaken or planned by a
private person; a project, in the execution of
which, M—had the good of the public, and
the glory of putting in a flourishing condition
that valuable branch of our trade, (which gives
employment to two great provinces, and above
two hundred sail of ships) much more at heart
than his own private interest. It was reasonable
to expect, that a man, whose debts M—had
paid more than once, whom he had obliged in
many other respects, and whom he had carried
with him, at a very considerable expence, on
this expedition, merely with a view of bettering
his fortune, would have acted with common ho∣nesty,
if not with gratitude: but such was the
depravity of this little monster's heart, that on
his death-bed he left a considerable fortune to
mere stra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s, with whom he had little or no
connexion, without the least thought of refund∣ing
the money advanced for him by M—, in
order to prevent his rotting in jail.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="207"/>
When M—had once obtained a command
of money, he, by his knowledge in several
branches of trade, as well as by the assistance of
some intelligent friends at Paris a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d London,
found means to employ it to very good purpose;
and had he been a man of that selfish disposition,
which too much prevails in the world, he might
have been, at this day, master of a very ample
fortune: but his ear was never deaf to the voice
of distress, nor his beneficent heart shut against
the calamities of his fellow-creatures. He was even
ingenious in contriving the most delicate methods
of relieving modest indigence, and, by his in∣dustrious
benevolence, often anticipated the re∣quests
of misery.</P>
<P>I could relate a number of examples to illus∣trate
my assertions, in some of which you would
perceive the most disinterested generosity; but such
a detail would trespass too much upon your time,
and I do not pretend to dwell upon every minute
circumstance of his conduct. Let it suffice to
say, that, upon the declaration of war with Spain,
he gave up all his commercial schemes, and called
in his money from all quarters, with a view of
sitting down, for the rest of his life, contented
with what he had got, and restraining his libe∣ralities
to what he could spare from his yearly
income. This was a very prudential resolu∣tion,
could he have kept it: but, upon the break∣ing
out of that war, he could not, without con∣cern,
see many gentlemen of merit, who had
been recommended to him, disappointed of com∣missions,
meerly for want of money to satisfy
the expectations of the commission-brokers of
that time; and therefore launched out consider∣able
sums for them on their bare notes, great
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
part whereof was lost by the death of some in
the unfortunate expedition to the West-Indies.</P>
<P>He, at length, after many other actions of the
like nature, from motives of pure humanity,
love of justice, and abhorrence of oppression,
embarked in a cause, every way the most impor∣tant
that ever came under the discussion of the
courts of law in these kingdoms; whether it be
considered in relation to the extraordinary nature
of the case, or the immense property of no less
than fifty thousand pounds a year, and three
peerages, that depended upon it.</P>
<P>In the year 1740, the brave admiral who at
that time commanded his majesty's fleet in the
West-Indies, among the other transactions of his
squadron, transmitted to the duke of Newcastle,
mentioned a young man, who, tho' in the capa∣city
of a common sailor on board one of the ships
under his command, laid claim to the estate and
titles of the earl of A—. These pretensions
were no sooner communicated in the public pa∣pers,
than they became the subject of conversa∣tion
in all companies; and the person whom they
chiefly affected, being alarmed at the appearance
of a competitor, tho' at such distance, began to
put himself in motion, and take all the precau∣tions
which he thought necessary to defeat the
endeavours of the young upstart. Indeed, the
early intelligence he received of Mr. A—y's
making himself known in the West-Indies, fur∣nished
him with numberless advantages over that
unhappy young gentleman: for, being in posses∣sion
of a plentiful fortune, and lord of many
manors in the neighbourhood of the very place
where the claimant was born, he knew all the
witnesses who could give the most material
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
evidence of his legitimacy; and, if his probity
did not restrain him, had, by his power and in∣fluence,
sufficient opportunity and means of apply∣ing
to the passions and interests of the witnesses,
to silence many, and gain over others to his side:
while his competitor, by an absence of fifteen or
sixteen years from his native country, the want
of education and friends, together with his
present helpless situation, was rendered abso∣lutely
incapable of taking any step for his own
advantage. And although his worthy uncle's
conspicuous virtue, and religious regard for jus∣tice
and truth, might possibly be an unconquet∣able
restraint to his taking any undue advan∣tages;
yet the consciences of that huge army of
emissaries he kept in pay, were not altogether so
very tender and scrupulous. This much, how∣ever,
may be said, without derogation from, or
impeachment of the noble earl's nice virtue and
honour, that he took care to compromise all dif∣ferences
with the other branches of the family,
whose interests were, in this affair, connected
with his own, by sharing the estate with them, and
also retained most of the eminent council within
the bar of both kingdoms against this formidable
b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stard, before any suit was instituted by him.</P>
<P>While he was thus entrenching himself against
the attack of a poor forlorn youth, at the distance
of fifteen hundred leagues, continually exposed
to the dangers of the sea, the war, and an un∣healthy
climate, Mr. M—, in the common
course of conversation, chanced to ask some
questions relating to this romantic pretender, of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> H—, who was at that time the present
lord A—y's chief agent. This man, when
p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essed, could not help owning that the late lord
<PB N="204" REF="210"/>
A—m actually left a son, who had been spirited
away into America, soon after his father's death;
but said he did not know whether this was the
same person.</P>
<P>This information could not fail to make an
impression on the humanity of Mr. M—, who,
being acquainted with the genius of the wicked
party who had possessed themselves of this un∣happy
young man's estate and honours, expressed
no small anxiety and apprehension lest they should
take him off by some means or other; and, even
then, seemed disposed to contribute towards the
support of the friendless orphan, and to enquire
more circumstantially into the nature of his claim.
In the mean time his occasions called him to
France; and, during his absence, Mr. A—y
arrived in London, in the month of October
1741.—”</P>
<P>Here the clergyman was interrupted by Pere∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine,
who said there was something so extra∣ordinary,
not to call it improbable, in the ac∣count
he had heard of the young gentleman's
being sent into exile, that he would look upon
himself as infinitely obliged to the doctor, if he
would favour him with a true representation of
that transaction, as well as of the manner in
which he arrived and was known at the island of
Jamaica.</P>
<P>The parson, in compliance with our hero's
request, taking up the story from the beginning,
“Mr. A—y (said he) is the son of Arthur late
lord baron of A—m, by his wife Mary Sh—d,
natural daughter to John duke of B—and
N—by, whom he publickly married on the
21st day of July 1706, contrary to the inclina∣tion
of his mother, and all his other relations,
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>
particularly Arthur late earl of A—y, who bore
an implacable enmity to the duke her father,
and, for that reason, did all that lay in his power
to traverse the marriage: but, finding his endea∣vours
ineffectual, he was so much offended, that
he would never be perfectly reconciled to lord
A—m, tho' he was his presumptive heir. After
their nuptials, they cohabited together in Eng∣land
for the space of two or three years; during
which she miscarried more than once: and he
being a man of levity, and an extravagant dispo∣sition,
not only squandered away all that he had
received of his wife's fortune, but also contracted
many considerable debts, which obliged him to
make a precipitate retreat into Ireland, leaving
his lady behind him in the house with his mother
and sisters; who, having also been averse to the
match, had always looked upon her with eyes
of disgust.</P>
<P>It was not likely that harmony should long
subsist in this family, especially as lady A—m
was a woman of a lofty spirit, who could not
tamely bear insults and ill-usage from persons,
who, she had reason to believe, were her ene∣mies
at heart. Accordingly a misunderstanding
soon happened among them, which was fomented
by the malice of one of her sisters-in-law: divers
scandalous reports of her misconduct, to which the
empty pretensions of a vain, wretched coxcomb
(who was made use of as an infamous tool for that
purpose) gave a colourable pretext, were trumped
up, and transmitted, with many false and aggravating
circumstances, to her husband in Ireland; who,
being a giddy, unthinking man, was so much in∣censed
at these insinuations, that, in the first
transports of his passion, he sent to his mother a
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
power of attorney, that she might sue for a
divorce in his behalf. A libel was thereupon ex∣hibited,
containing many scandalous allegations,
void of any real foundation in truth; but being
unsupported by any manner of proof, it was at
length dismissed with costs, after it had depended
upwards of two years.</P>
<P>Lord A—m, finding himself abused by the
misrepresentations of his mother and sister, dis∣covered
an inclination to be reconciled to his
lady: in consequence of which, she was sent over
to Dublin by her father, to the care of a gentle∣man
in that city; in whose house she was received
by her husband, with all the demonstrations of
love and esteem. From thence he conducted her
to his lodgings, and then to his country-house;
where she had the misfortune to suffer a miscar∣riage,
through fear and resentment of my lord's
behaviour, which was often brutal and indecent.
From the country they removed to Dublin, about
the latter end of July, or beginning of August
1714; where they had not long continued, when
her ladyship was known to be again with child.</P>
<P>Lord A—m and his issue being next in re∣mainder
to the honours and estate of Arthur earl
of A—a, was extremely solicitous to have a son;
and, warned by the frequent miscarriages of his
lady, resolved to curb the natural impatience and
rusticity of his disposition, that she might not, as
formerly, suffer by his outrageous conduct. He
accordingly cherished her with uncommon ten∣derness
and care; and her pregnancy being pretty
far advanced, conducted her to his country-seat,
where she was delivered of Mr. A—y, about the
latter end of April or beginning of May; for none
of the witnesses have been able, at this distance, with
absolute certainty, to fix the precise time of his
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>
birth, and there was no register kept in the
parish: and, as an additional misfortune, no gen∣tlemen
of fashion lived in that parish; nor did
those who lived at any considerable distance, care
to cultivate an acquaintance with a man of lord
A—m's strange conduct.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, the occasion was celebrated
by his lordship's tenants and dependants upon
the spot, and in the neighbouring town of New
R—ss, by bonfires, illuminations, and other re∣joicings;
which have made such an impression
upon the minds of the people, that, in the place
where they happened, and the contiguous parishes,
several hundred people have already declared their
knowledge and remembrance of this event, in
spite of the great power of the claimant's adver∣sary
in that quarter, and the great pains and in∣direct
methods taken by his numberless agents
and emissaries, as well as by those who are in∣terested
with him, in the event of the suit, to
corrupt and suppress the evidence.</P>
<P>Lord A—m, after the birth of this son,
who was sent to nurse in the neighbourhood,
according to the custom of the country, (where
people of the highest distinction put their children
out to nurse into farm-houses and cabbins) lived
in harmony with his lady for the space of two
years: but having, by his folly and extravagance,
reduced himself to great difficulties, he demanded
the remainder of her fortune from her father the
duke of B—, who absolutely refused to part
with a shilling, until a proper settlement should
be made on his daughter, which by that time he
had put out of his own power to do, by his folly
and extravagance.</P>
<P>As her ladyship, by her endeavours to reform
the oeconomy of her house, had incurred the dis∣pleasure
<PB N="208" REF="214"/>
of some idle, profligate fellows, who had
fastened themselves upon her husband, and helped
to consume his substance, they seized this oppor∣tunity
of the duke's refusal; and, in order to be
revenged upon the innocent lady, persuaded lord
A—m, that the only means of extracting money
from his grace would be to turn her away, on
pretence of infidelity to his bed, for which, they
hinted, there was but too much foundation. At
their suggestions, a most infamous plan was pro∣jected;
in the execution of which, one P—, a
poor, unbred, simple, country booby, whom they
had decoyed into a snare, lost one of his ears,
and the injured lady retired that same day to New
R—ss, where she continued several years. She
did not, however, leave the house, without
struggling hard to carry her child along with her;
but, far from enjoying such indulgence, strict
orders were given, that the boy should not, for
the future, be brought within her sight. This
base, inhuman treatment, instead of answering the
end proposed, produced such a contrary effect,
that the duke of B—, by a codicil to his will,
in which he reflects upon lord A—m's evil tem∣per,
directed his executors to pay to his daughter
an annuity of one hundred pounds, while her lord
and she should continue to live separate; and this
allowance ceased on lord A—m's death.</P>
<P>While she remained inthis solitary situation,
the child was universally known and received as
the legitimate son and heir of her lord, whose af∣fection
for the boy was so conspicuous, that in
the midst of his own necessities, he never failed
to maintain him in the dress and equipage of a
young nobleman. In the course of his infancy,
his father having often changed his place of resi∣dence,
<PB N="209" REF="215"/>
the child was put under the instruction of
a great many different schoolmasters, so that he
was perfectly well known in a great many dif∣ferent
parts of the kingdom; and his mother
seized all opportunities (which were but rare, on
account of his father's orders to the contrary) of
seeing, and giving him proofs of her maternal
tenderness, until she set out for England, after
having been long in a declining state of health,
by a paralytical disorder; upon the consequence
of which, such dependance was placed by her in∣considerate
husband, who was by this time re∣duced
to extreme poverty, that he actually mar∣ried
a woman whom he had long kept as a mi∣stress;
and this creature no sooner understood
that lady Al—m was departed from Ireland, than
she openly avowed her marriage, and went about
publickly with lord A—m, visiting his ac∣quaintances
in character of his wife.</P>
<P>From this aera may be dated the beginning of
Mr. A—y's misfortunes: this artful woman,
who had formerly treated the child with an ap∣pearance
of fondness, in order to ingratiate her∣self
with the father, now looking upon herself
as sufficiently established in the family, thought
it was high time to alter her behaviour with re∣gard
to the unfortunate boy; and accordingly,
for obvious reasons, employed a thousand arti∣fices
to alienate the heart of this weak father
from his unhappy offspring: yet, notwithstand∣ing
all her insinuations, nature still maintained her
influence in his heart; and though she often
found means to irritate him by artful and mali∣cious
accusations, his resentment never extended
farther than fatherly correction; and she would
have found it impossible to accomplish his ruin,
<PB N="210" REF="216"/>
had not her efforts been reinforced by a new
auxiliary, who was no other than his uncle, the
present usurper of his title and estate; yet even
this confederacy was over-awed, in some mea∣sure,
by the fear of alarming the unfortunate
mother, till her distemper increased to a most
deplorable degree of the dead palsy, and the death
of her father had reduced her to a most forlorn
and abject state of distress. Then they ventured
upon the execution of their projects; and (though
their aims were widely different) concurred in
their endeavours to remove the hapless boy, as
the common obstacle to both.</P>
<P>Lord Al—m, who (as I have already ob∣served)
was a man of weak intellects, and ut∣terly
void of any fixed principle of action, being,
by this time, reduced to such a pitch of misery,
that he was often obliged to pawn his wearing-apparel,
in order to p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocure the common neces∣saries
of life; and having no other fund remain∣ing,
with which he could relieve his present ne∣cessities,
except his sale of the reversion of the
A—a estate, to which the nonage of his son
was an effectual bar, he was advised by his vir∣tuous
brother, and the rest of his counsellors, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urmount this difficulty, by secreting his son, and
spreading a report of his death. This honest
project he the more readily embraced, because he
knew that no act of his could frustrate the child's
succession. Accordingly, the boy was removed
from the school at which he was then boarded, to
the house of one K—gh, an agent and ac∣complice
of the present earl of A—a, where
he was kept for several months closely confined;
and in the mean time, it was industriously re∣ported
that he was dead.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="217"/>
This previous measure being taken, lord A—m
published advertisements in the gazettes, offering
reversions of the A—a estate to sale; and
emissaries of various kinds were employed, to in∣veigle
such as were ignorant of the nature of the
settlement of these estates, or strangers to the
affairs of his family. Some people, imposed up∣on
by the report of the child's death, were drawn
in to purchase, thinking themselves safe in the
concurrence of his lordship's brother, upon pre∣sumption
that he was next in remainder to the
succession; others, tempted by the smallness of
the price, (which rarely exceeded half a year's
purchase, as appears by many deeds) though they
doubted the truth of the boy's being dead, ran
small risques on the contingency of his dying be∣fore
he should be of age, or in hope of his being
prevailed upon to confirm the grants of his fa∣ther;
and many more were treating with him on
the same notions, when their transactions were
suddenly interrupted, and the scheme of raising
more money, for the present, defeated by the
unexpected appearance of the boy, who being
naturally sprightly and impatient of restraint, had
found means to break from his confinement, and
wandered up and down the streets of Dublin,
avoiding his father's house, and choosing to en∣counter
all sorts of distress, rather than subject
himself again to the cruelty and malice of the
woman who supplied his mother's place. Thus
deba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red his father's protection, and destitute of
any fixed habitation, he herded with all the loose,
idle, and disorderly youths in Dublin, skulking
chiefly about the college, several members and
students of which, taking pity on his misfor∣tunes,
supplied him at different times with cloaths
<PB N="212" REF="218"/>
and money. In this unsettled and uncomfortable
way of life did he remain, from the year 1725
to the latter end of November 1727; at which
time his father died so miserably poor, that he
was actually buried at the public expence.</P>
<P>This unfortunate nobleman was no sooner
dead, than his brother Richard, now earl of
A—a, taking advantage of the non-age and
helpless situation of his nephew, seized upon all
the papers of the defunct, and afterwards usurped
the title of lord A—m, to the surprize of the
servants, and others who were acquainted with
the affairs of the family. This usurpation, bold
as it was, produced no other effect than that of
his being insulted by the populace as he went
through the streets, and the refusal of the
king at arms to enrol the certificate of his bro∣ther's
having died without issue. The first of
these inconveniences he bore without any sense of
shame, tho' not without repining, conscious that
it would gradually vanish with the novelty of his
invasion; and as to the last, he conquered it by
means well known and obvious.</P>
<P>Nor will it seem strange, that he should thus
invade the rights of an orphan with impunity, if
people will consider, that the late lord A—m
had not only squandered away his fortune, with
the most ridiculous extravagance, but also asso∣ciated
himself with low company; so that he
was little known, and less regarded, by persons
of any rank and figure in life; and his child, of
consequence, debarred of the advantages which
might have accrued from valuable connexions.
And tho' it was universally known, that lady
A—m had a son in Ireland, such was the ob∣scurity
in which the father had lived, during the
<PB N="213" REF="219"/>
last years of his life, that few of the nobility
could be supposed to be acquainted with the par∣tic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lar
circumstances of a transaction in which
they had no concern, and which had happened at
the distance of twelve years before the date of this
usurpation. Moreover, as their first information
was no other than common fame, the public cla∣mour
occasioned by the separation, might inspire
such as were strangers to the family affairs, with
a mistaken notion of the child's having been
born about or after the time of that event. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urry and bustle occasioned by the arrival of the
lord lieutenant about this period, the reports in∣custriously
propagated of the claimant's death,
the obscurity and concealment in which the boy
was obliged to live, in order to elude the wicked
attempts of his uncle, might also contribute to
his peaceable enjoyment of an empty title: and
lastly, lord chancellor W—m, whose immediate
province it was to issue writs for parliament, was
an utter stranger in Ireland, unacquainted with
the descents of families, and consequently did
not examine farther than the certificate enrolled
in the books of the king at arms. Over and
above these circumstances, which naturally ac∣count
for the success of the imposture, it may be
observed, that the hapless youth had not one re∣lation
alive, on the side of his father, whose in∣terest
it was not to forward or connive at his
destruction; that his grand-father the duke of
B—was dead; and that his mother was then
in England, in a forlorn, destitute, dying condi∣tion,
secreted from the world, and even from
her own relations, by her woman Mary H—,
who had a particular interest to secrete her, and
altogether dependant upon a miserable and preca∣rious
<PB N="214" REF="220"/>
allowance from the dutchess of B—, to
whose caprice she was moreover a most wretched
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>withstanding these concurring circum∣stances
in favour of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he did not think
himself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> while the orphan had any chance
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> who would undertake h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
cause; and there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a plan for his being
kidnapped, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to America as a slave. His
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in this humane scheme, was a person
who carried on the trade of transp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rting servants
to our plantations▪ and was deeply interested on
this occasion, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving for a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> trifle, purchased
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> A—m the reversion of a con∣siderable
part of the A—a estate; which shame∣ful
bargain was confirmed by the brother, but
could never take place, unless the boy could be
effectually removed.</P>
<P>Every thing being settled with this auxiliary,
several ruffians were employed in search of the
unhappy victim; and the first attempt that was
made upon him, in which his uncle personally
assisted, happening near one of the great markets
of the city of Dublin, an honest butcher, with
the assistance of his neighbours, rescued him by
force from their cruel hands. This, however,
was but a short respite; for (tho', warned by this
adventure, the boy seldom crept out of his lurk∣ing
places, without the most cautious circum∣spection)
he was, in March 1727, discovered by
the diligence of his persecutors, and forcibly
dragged on board of a ship bound for Newcastle
on Delaware river in America, where he was
sold as a slave, and kept to hard labour, much
above his age or strength, for the space of thir∣teen
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>
years, during which he was transferred from
one person to another.</P>
<P>While he remained in this servile situation, he
often mentioned, to those in whom he thought
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch confidence might be placed, the circum∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nces
of his birth and title, together with the
manner of his being exiled from his native coun∣try;
although, in this particular, he neglected a
caution which he had received in his passage,
importing, that such discovery would cost him
his life. Mean while the usurper quietly enjoyed
his right; and to those who questioned him about
his brother's son, constantly replied, that the
boy had been dead for several years. And Arthur
earl of A—a dying in April 1737, he, upon
pretence of being next heir, succeeded to the
honours and estate of that nobleman.</P>
<P>The term of the nephew's bondage, which
had been lengthened out beyond the usual time,
on account of his repeated attempts to escape,
being expired in the year 1739, he hired himself
as a common sailor in a trading vessel bound to
Jamaica; and there, being entered on board of
one of his majesty's ships under the command of
admiral Vernon, openly declared his parentage
and pretensions. This extraordinary claim,
which made a great noise in the fleet, reaching
the ears of one lieutenant S—n, nearly related
to the usurper's Irish wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, he believed the young
gentleman to be an impostor; and thinking it
was incumbent upon him to discover the cheat,
he went on board of the ship to which the
claimant belonged, and, having heard the account
which he gave of himself, was, notwithstanding
his prepossessions, convinced of the truth of what
he alledged: and, on his return to his own ship,
<PB N="216" REF="222"/>
chanced to mention this extraordinary affair upon
the quarter-deck, in the hearing of Mr. B—n,
one of the midshipmen, who had formerly been
at school with Mr. A—y. This young gentle∣man
not only told the lieutenant, that he had
been school-fellow with lord A—m's son, but
also declared that he should know him again, if
not greatly altered, as he still retained a perfect
idea of his countenance.</P>
<P>Upon this intimation, the lieutenant proposed
that the experiment should be tried; and went
with the midshipman on board the ship that the
claimant was in for that purpose. After all the sai∣lors
had been assembled upon deck, Mr. B—n, cast∣ing
his eyes around, immediately distinguished Mr.
A—y in the croud, and laying his hand on his
shoulder, “This is the man,” said he; affirm∣ing
at the same time, that, while he continued
at school with him, the claimant was reputed
and respected as lord A—m's son and heir, and
maintained in all respects suitable to the dignity
of his rank. Nay, he was, in like manner, re∣cogn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zed
by several other persons in the fleet,
who had known him in his infancy.</P>
<P>These things being reported to the admiral,
he generously ordered him to be supplied with
necessaries, and treated like a gentleman; and,
in his next dispatches, transmitted an account of
the affair to the duke of Newcastle, among the
other transactions of the fleet.</P>
<P>In September or October 1741, Mr. A—y
arrived in London; and the first person to whom
he applied for advice and assistance, was a man of
the law, nea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly related to the families of A—a
and A—m, and well acquainted with the parti∣cular
affairs of each, who, far from treating him
<PB N="217" REF="223"/>
as a bastard and impostor, received him with
civility and seeming kindness, asked him to eat,
presented him with a piece of money, and, ex∣cusing
himself from meddling in the affair, ad∣vised
him to go to Ireland, as the most proper
place for commencing a suit for the recovery of
his right.</P>
<P>Before the young gentleman had an oppor∣tunity,
or indeed any inclination, to comply with
this advice, he was accidentally met in the street
by that same H—n, who, as I have mentioned,
gave Mr. M—r the first insight into the affair:
this man immediately knew the claimant, having
been formerly an agent for his father, and after∣wards
a creature of his uncle's, with whom he
was, not without reason, suspected to be con∣cerned
in kidnapping and transporting his nephew.
Be that as it will, his connections with the
usurper were now broke off by a quarrel, in con∣sequence
of which he had thrown up his agency;
and he invited the hapless stranger to his house,
with a view of making all possible advantage of
such a guest.</P>
<P>There he had not long remained, when his
treacherous landlord, tampering with his inexpe∣rience,
effected a marriage between him and the
daughter of one of his own friends, who lodged
in his house at the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me time: but afterwards,
seeing no person of consequence willing to espous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his cause, he looked upon him as an incum∣brance,
and wanted to rid his hands of him ac∣cordingly.
He remembered that Mr. M—r had
expressed himself with all the humanity of ap∣prehension,
in favour of the unfortunate young
nobleman, before his arrival in England; and
being well acquainted with the generosity of his
<PB N="218" REF="224"/>
disposition, he no sooner understood that he was
returned from France, than he waited upon him
with an account of Mr. A—y's being safely ar∣rived.
Mr. M—r was sincerely rejoiced to
find, that a person who had been so cruelly in∣jured,
and undergone so long and continued a scene
of distress, was restored to a country where he
was sure of obtaining justice, and where every
good man (as he imagined) would make the cause
his own: and, being informed that the youth
was in want of necessaries, he gave twenty guineas
to H—n for his use, and promised to do him all
the service in his power; but had no intention to
take upon himself the whole weight of such an
important affair, or indeed to appear in the cause,
until he should be fully and throughly satis∣fied
that the claimant's pretensions were well
founded.</P>
<P>In the mean time, H—n insinuating that the
young gentleman was not safe in his present
lodging, from the machinations of his enemies,
M—r accommodated him with an apartment in
his own house; where he was at great pains to
remedy the defect in his education, by rendering
him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to appear as a gentleman in the world:
and having received from him all the intelligence
he could give, r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lating to his own affair, laid the
case before council, and dispatched a person to
Ireland, to make further enquiries upon the same
subject; who, on his first arrival in that king∣dom,
found the claimant's birth was as publickly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as any circumstance of that kind could
possibly be, at so great a distance of time.</P>
<P>The usurper and his friends gave all the inter∣ruption
in their power to any researches concern∣ing
t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t affair; and had recourse to every art and
<PB N="219" REF="225"/>
expedient that could be invented, to prevent its
being brought to a legal discussion: privilege,
bills in chancery, orders of court surreptitiously
and illegally obtained, and every other invention,
was made use of to bar and prevent a fair and
honest trial by a jury. The usurper himself, and
his agents, at the same time that they formed
divers conspiracies against his life, in vain endea∣voured
to detach Mr. M—r from the orphan's
cause by innumerable artifices, insinuati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g, ca∣joling,
and misrepresenting with surprising dex∣terity
and perseverance.</P>
<P>His protector, far from being satisfied with their
reasons, was not only deaf to their remonstrances,
but, believing him in danger from their repeated ef∣forts,
had him privately conveyed into the coun∣try;
where an unhappy accident (which he hath
ever since sincerely regreted) furnished his adver∣sary
a colourable pretext to cut him off in the
beginning of his career.</P>
<P>A man happening to l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se his life, by the acci∣dental
discharge of a piece, that chanced to be
in the young gentleman's hands, the account of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> misfortune no sooner reached the ears of his
uncle, than he expressed the most immoderate
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at having found so good a handle for destroy∣i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g
him, under colour of law. He immediately
constitated himself prosecutor, set his emissaries
at work to secure a coroner's inquest suited to his
cruel purposes; set out for the place in person,
to take care that the prisoner should not escape;
ins<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lted him in jail, in the most inhuman man∣ner;
employed a whole army of attornies and
agents, to spirit up and carry on a most virulent
prosecution; practised all the unfair methods that
could be invented, in order that the unhappy
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>
gentleman should be transported to Newgate,
from the healthy prison to which he was at first
committed; endeavoured to inveigle him into
destructive confessions; and, not to mention other
more infamous arts employed in the affair of evi∣dence,
attempted to surprize him upon his trial,
in the absence of his witnesses and council, con∣trary
to a previous agreement with the prosecu∣tor's
own attorney: nay, he even appeared in
person upon the bench at the trial, in order to
intimidate the evidence, and brow-beat the un∣fortunate
prisoner at the bar, and expended above
a thousand pounds in that prosecution. In spite
of all his wicked efforts, however, which were
defeated by the spirit and indefatigable industry
of Mr. M—r, the young gentleman was ho∣nourably
acquitted, to the evident satisfaction of
all the impartial; the misfortune that gave a
handle for that unnatural prosecution, appearing
to a demonstration to have been a mere ac∣cident.</P>
<P>In a few months, his protector, who had now
openly espoused his cause, (taking with him two
gentlemen to witness his transactions) conducted
him to his native country, with a view to be
better informed of the strength of his pretensions,
than he could be by the intelligences he had hi∣therto
received, or by the claimant's own dark
and almost obliterated remembrance of the facts
which were essential to be known. Upon their
arrival in Dublin, application was made to those
persons whom Mr. A—y had named as his
schoolmasters and companions, together with the
servants and neighbours of his father. These,
though examined separately, without having the
least previous intimation of what the claimant
<PB N="221" REF="227"/>
had reported, agreed in their accounts with him,
as well as with one another, and mentioned
many other people as acquainted with the same
facts to whom Mr. M—r had recourse, and
still met with the same unvaried information. By
these means, he made such progress in his in∣quiries,
that in less than two months no fewer
than one hundred persons, from different quarters
of the kingdom, either personally, or by letters,
communicated their knowledge of the claimant,
in declarations consonant with one another, as
well as with the accounts he gave of himself.
Several servants who had lived with his father,
and been deceived with the story of his death,
so industriously propagated by his uncle, no sooner
heard of his being in Dublin, than they came
from different parts of the country to see him;
and though great pains were taken to deceive
them, they, nevertheless, knew him at first sight;
some of them fell upon their knees, to thank
heaven for his preservation, embraced his legs,
and shed tears of joy for his return.</P>
<P>Although the conduct of his adversary, parti∣cularly
in the above-mentioned prosecution, toge∣ther
with the evidence that already appeared,
were sufficient to convince all mankind of the
truth of the claimant's pretensions, Mr. M—r,
in order to be further satisfied, resolved to see
how he would be received upon the spot where he
was born; justly concluding, that if he was really
an impostor, the bastard of a kitchen-wench,
produced in a country intirely possessed by his
enemy and his allies, he must be looked upon in
that place with the utmost detestation and con∣tempt.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="228"/>
This his intention was no sooner known to the
adverse party, than their agents and friends, from
all quarters, repaired to that place with all pos∣sible
dispatch, and used all their influence with
the people, in remonstrances, threats, and all
the other arts they could devise, not only to dis∣countenance
the claimant upon his arrival, but
even to spirit up a mob to insult him. Notwith∣standing
these precautions, and the servile awe
and subjection in which tenants are kept by their
landlords in that part of the country, as soon as
it was known that Mr. A—y approached the
town, the inhabitants crowded out in great mul∣titudes
to receive and welcome him, and accom∣panied
him into town with acclamations and other
expressions of joy, insomuch that the agents of
his adversary durst not shew their faces. The
sovereign of the corporation, who was a parti∣cular
creature and favourite of the usurper, and
whose all depended upon the issue of the cause,
was so conscious of the stranger's right, and so
much awed by the behaviour of the people, who
knew that consciousness, that he did not think it
safe, even to preserve the appearance of neu∣trality
upon this occasion, but actually held the
stirrup while Mr. A—y dismounted from his
horse.</P>
<P>This sense of conviction in the people, mani∣fested
itself still more powerfully, when he re∣turned
to the same place in the year 1744, about
which time lord A—a being informed of his
resolution, determined again to be before-hand
with him, and set out in person with his agents
and friends, some of whom were detached before
him, to prepare for his reception, and induce the
people to meet him in a body, and accompany
<PB N="223" REF="229"/>
him to town, with such expressions of welcome
as they had before bestowed on his nephew: but
in spite of all their art and interest, he was suf∣fered
to pass through the street in a mournful si∣lence;
and though several barrels of beer were
produced, to court the favour of the populace,
they had no other effect than that of drawing their
ridicule upon the donor; whereas, when Mr.
A—y, two days afterwards, appeared, all the
inhabitants, with garlands, streamers, music, and
other ensigns of joy, crowded out to meet him,
and ushered him into town with such demonstra∣tions
of pleasure and good-will, that the noble
peer found it convenient to hide himself from the
resentment of his own tenants, the effects of
which he must have severely felt, had not he been
screened by the timely remonstrances of Mr.
M—r, and the other gentlemen who accompa∣nied
his competitor.</P>
<P>Nor did his apprehension vanish with the trans∣actions
of this day; the town was again in uproar
on the Sunday following, when it was known
that Mr. A—y intended to come thither, from
Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>main, to church: they went out to meet him
as before, and conducted him to the church-door
with acclamations, which terrified his uncle to
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch a degree, that he sted with precipitation in
a boat, and so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n after inti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely quitted the place.</P>
<P>It would be almost an endless task to enumerate
the particular st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps that were taken by one side
to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, and by the other to delay the trial:
the yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g gentleman's adversaries finding that
they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not, by all the subterfuges and arts
they had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vade it, repeated attempts were
made to ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssinate him and his protector, and
every obstruction thrown in the way of his cause
<PB N="224" REF="230"/>
which craft could invent, villany execute, and
undue influence confirm. But all these difficul∣ties
were surmounted by the vigilance, constancy,
courage and sagacity of M—r; and, at last,
the affair was brought to a very solemn trial at
bar, which being continued, by several adjourn∣ments,
from the eleventh to the twenty-fifth day
of November, a verdict was found for the
claimant, by a jury of gentlemen, which, in point
of reputation and property, cannot be easily pa∣ralelled
in the annals of that or any other coun∣try;
a jury that could by no means be suspected
of prepossessions in favour of Mr. An—y, (to
whose person they were absolute strangers) espe∣cially
if we consider that a gentleman in their
neighbourhood, who was nephew to the foreman,
and nearly related to some of the rest of their
number, forfeited a considerable estate by their
decision.</P>
<P>This verdict (said the parson) gave the highest
satisfaction to all impartial persons that were with∣in
reach of being truly informed of their pro∣ceedings,
and of the different genius and conduct
of the parties engaged in the contest; but more
especially to such as were in court (as I was) at
the trial, and had an opportunity of observing
the characters and behaviour of the persons who
appeared there to give evidence.—To such it
was very apparent, that all the witnesses produced
there on the part of the uncle, were either his
tenants, dependents, pot-companions, or persons
some way or other interested in the issue of the
suit, and remarkable for a low kind of cunning:
that many of them were persons of profligate
lives, who deserved no credit: that (independent
of the levi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of their characters) those of them
<PB N="225" REF="231"/>
who went under the denomination of colonels,
(colonel L—fts alone excepted, who had nothing
to say, and was only brought there in order to
give credit to that party) made so ridiculous a fi∣gure,
and gave so absurd, contradictory and in∣consistent
an evidence, as no court or jury could
give the least degree of credit to.—On the other
hand, it was observed, that the nephew and Mr.
M—r his chief manager, (being absolute strangers
in that country, and unacquainted with the cha∣racters
of the persons they had to deal with) were
obliged to lay before the court and jury such evi∣dence
as came to their hand, some of whom
plainly appeared to have been put upon them by
their adversaries, with a design to hurt—It was
also manifest, that the witnesses produced for Mr.
A—y were such as could have no manner of
connexion with him, nor any dep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndence what∣soever
upon him, to influence the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evidence;
for the far greatest part of them had never seen
him from his infancy, till the trial began; and
that many of them (though poor and undignified
with the title of colonels) were people of unble∣mished
character, of great simplicity, and such as
no man in his senses would pitch upon to support
a bad cause.—It is plain that the jury, (whose
well-known honour, impartiality and penetration
must be revered by all who are acquainted with
them) were not under the least difficulty about
their verdict; for they were not inclosed above
half an hour, when they returned with it.—
These gentlemen could not help observing the
great inequality of the parties engaged, the great
advantages that the uncle had in every other re∣spect
(except the truth and justice of his case)
over the nephew, by means of his vast posses∣sions,
<PB N="226" REF="232"/>
and of his power and influence all round
the place of his birth; nor could the contrast be∣tween
the different genius's of the two parties
escape their observation.—They could not but
see and conclude, that a person who had con∣fessedly
transported and sold his orphan-nephew
into slavery, who, on his return, had carried on
so unwarrantable and cruel a prosecution to take
away his life, under colour of law, and who had
also given such glaring proofs of his skill and dex∣terity
in the management of witnesses for that
cruel purpose, was in like manner capable of ex∣erting
the same happy talent on this occasion,
when his all was at stake; more especially, as he
had so many others who were equally interested
with himself, and whose abilities, in that respect,
fell nothing short of his own, to second him in
it.—The gentlemen of the jury had also a near
view of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in which the witnesses deli∣vered
their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and had from thence an
opp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtunity of observing many circumstances and
distinguishing characteristics of truth and falshood,
from which a great deal could be gathered, that
could not be adequately conveyed by any printed
account, how exact soever; consequently, they
must have been much better judges of the evi∣dence
on which they founded their verdict, than
any person, who had not the same opportunity,
can possibly be.</P>
<P>These, Mr. Pickle, were my reflections on
what I had occasion to observe concerning that
famous trial; and on my return to England two
years after, I could not help pitying the self-suf∣ficiency
of some people, who, at this distance,
pretended to pass their judgment on that verdict
with as great positiveness, as if they had been in
<PB N="227" REF="233"/>
the secrets of the cause, or upon the jury who
tried it; and that from no better authority, than
the declamations of lord An—a's emissaries,
and some falsified printed accounts, artfully cook∣ed
up, on purpose to mislead and deceive.</P>
<P>But to return from this digression, lord A—a,
the defendant in that cause, was so conscious of
the strength and merits of his injured nephew's
case, and that a verdict would go against him,
that he ordered a writ of error to be made out
before the trial was ended; and the verdict was
no sooner given, than he immediately lodged it,
though he well knew he had no manner of error
to assign. This expedient was practised merely
for vexation and delay, in order to keep Mr. A—y
from the possession of the small estate he had re∣covered
by the verdict; that, his slender funds
being exhausted, he might be deprived of other
means to prosecute his right; and, by the most
oppressive contrivances and scandalous chicanery,
it has been kept up to this day, without his being
able to assign the least shadow of any error.</P>
<P>Lord A—a was not the only antagonist
that Mr. A—y had to deal with; all the dif∣ferent
branches of the A—a family, who had
been worrying one another at law ever since the
death of the late earl of A—a, about the par∣tition
of his great estate, were now firmly united
in an association against this unfortunate gentle∣man;
mutual deeds were executed among them,
by which many great lordships and estates were
given up by the uncle to persons who had no
right to possess them, in order to engage them to
side with him against his nephew, in withholding
the unjust possession of the remainder.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="234"/>
These confederates having held several consul∣tations
against their common enemy, and finding
that his cause gathered daily strength since the trial,
by the accession of many witnesses of figure and
reputation, who had not been heard of before;
and that the only chance they had to prevent the
speedy establishment of his right, and their own
destruction, was by stripping Mr. M—r of the
little money that yet remained, and stopping all
further resources whereby he might be enabled to
proceed; they, therefore, came to a determined
resolution to carry that hopeful scheme into exe∣cution;
and, in pursuance thereof, they have le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
no expedient or stratagem, how extraordinary or
scandalous soever, unpractised to distress Mr.
An—y and that gentleman. For that end, all
the oppressive arts and dilatory expensive con∣trivances
that the fertile invention of the lowest
pettifoggers of the law could possibly devise, have
with great dexterity been played off against them
in fruitless, quibbling, and malicious suits, intirely
foreign to the merits of the cause. Not to men∣tion
numberless other acts of oppression, the most
extraordinary and unprecedented proceedings, by
means whereof this sham writ of error hath been
kept on foot ever since November 1743, is to
me (said the doctor) a most flagrant instance,
not only of the prevalency of power and money,
(when employed, as in the present case, against an
unfortunate, helpless man, disabled, as he is, of
the means of ascertaining his right) but of the
badness of a cause, that hath recourse to so many
iniquitous expedients to support it.</P>
<P>In a word, the whole conduct of lord A—a
and his party, from the beginning to this time,
hath been such, as sufficiently manifests, that it
<PB N="229" REF="235"/>
could proceed from no other motives than a con∣sciousness
of Mr. A—y's right, and of their own
illegal usurpations, and from a terror of trusting
the merits of their case to a fair discussion by the
laws of their country: and that the intention and
main drift of all their proceedings plainly tends to
stifle and smother the merits of the case from the
knowledge of the world, by oppressive arts and
and ingenious delays, rather than trust it to the
candid determination of an honest jury. What
else could be the motives of kid-knapping the
claimant, and transporting him when an infant?
of the various attempts made upon his life since
his return? of the attempts to divest him of all
assistance to ascertain his right, by endeavouring
so solicitously to prevail on Mr. M—r to abandon
him in the beginning? of retaining an army of
counsel, before any suit had been commenced?
of the many sinister attempts to prevent the trial
at bar? of the various arts made use of to terri∣fy
any one from appearing as witness for the
claimant, and to seduce those who had appeared?
of the shameless, unprecedented, low tricks now
practised, to keep him out of the possession of that
estate for which he had obtained the verdict, there∣by
to disable him from bringing his cause to a fur∣hearing,
and of the attempts made to buy up
Mr. M—'s debts, and to spirit up suits
against him? Is it not obvious from all these c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cumstances,
as well as from the obstruction they
have given to the attorney-general's proceeding to
make a report to his majesty, on the claimant's pe∣tition
to the King for the peerage, which was re∣ferred
by his majesty to that gentleman, so far back
as 1743; that all their efforts are bent to that one
point of stifling, rather than suffering the merits of
<PB N="230" REF="236"/>
this cause to come to a fair and candid hearing;
and that the sole consideration at present between
them and this unfortunate man is not, whether
he is right or wrong, but whether he shall or shall
not find money to bring this cause to a final de∣termination.</P>
<P>Lord A—a and his confederates not thinking
themselves safe with all these expedients, while
there was a possibility of their antagonist's ob∣taining
any assistance from such as humanity,
compassion, generosity, or a love of justice might
induce to lay open their purses to his assistance,
in ascertaining his right, have, by themselves and
their numerous emissaries, employed all the arts
of calumny, slander and detraction against him,
by traducing his cause, vilifying his person, and
most basely and cruelly tearing his character to
pieces, by a thousand misrepresentations, pur∣posely
invented and industriously propagated in all
places of resort, which is a kind of cowardly as∣sassination
that there is no guarding against: yet,
in spite of all these machinations, and the shameful
indifference of mankind, who stand aloof uncon∣cerned,
and see this unhappy gentleman most in∣humanly
oppressed by the weight of lawless power
and faction, M—r, far from suffering himself
to be dejected by the multiplying difficulties that
c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oud upon him, still exerts himself with amazing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and assiduity, and will (I doubt not)
bring the affair he began and carried on with so
so much spirit, while his finances lasted, to an
happy conclusion.</P>
<P>It would exc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the bounds of my intention,
and perhaps trespass too much upon your time,
were I to enumerate the low artifices and shame∣ful
quibbles, by which the usurper has found
<PB N="231" REF="237"/>
means to procrastinate the decision of the contest
between him and his hapless nephew, or to give a
detail of the damage and perplexity which Mr. M—
has sustained and been involved in, by the trea∣chery
and ingratitude of some who listed them∣selves
under him in the prosecution of this affair,
and by the villainy of others, who, under various
pretences of material discoveries they had to
make, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had fastened themselves upon him,
and continued to do all the mischief in their
power, until the cloven foot was detected.</P>
<P>One instance, however, is so flagrantly flagi∣tious,
that I cannot resist the inclination I feel to
relate it, as an example of the most infernal per∣fidy
that perhaps ever entered the human heart.
I have already mentioned the part which H—n
acted in the beginning of M—'s connection with
the unfortunate stranger, and hinted that the
said H—n lay under many obligations to that
gentleman, before Mr. A—y's arrival in England.
He had been chief agent to lord A—y, and, as
it afterwards appeared, received several payments
of a secret pension which that lord enjoyed, for
which he either could not, or would not account.
His lordship, therefore, in order to compel him
to it, took out writs against him, and his house
was continually surrounded with catchpoles for
the space of two whole years.</P>
<P>Mr. M—believing, from H—n's own ac∣count
of the matter, that the poor man was
greatly injured, and persecuted on account of his
attachment to the unhappy young gentleman,
did him all the good offices in his power, and
became security for him on several occasions:
nay, such was his opinion of his integrity, that
after Mr. A—y was cleared of the prosecution
<PB N="232" REF="238"/>
carried on against him by his uncle, his person
was trusted to the care of this hypocrite, who
desired that the young gentleman might lodge at
his house for the convenience of air, M—'s
own occasions calling him often into the country.</P>
<P>Having thus, by his consummate dissimulation,
acquired such a valuable charge, he wrote a let∣ter
to one of lord A—y's attornies, offering to
betray Mr. An—ey; provided his lordship would
settle his account, and give him a discharge for
eight hundred pounds of the pension, which he
had received, and not accounted for. Mr. M—,
informed of this treacherous proposal, imme∣diately
removed his lodger from his house into
his own, without assigning his reasons for so
doing, until he was obliged to declare it, in
order to free himself from the importunities of
H—n, who earnestly solicited his return. This
miscreant finding himself detected, and disap∣pointed
in his villainous design, was so much en∣raged
at his miscarriage, that, forgetting all the
benefits he had received from M—for a series of
years, he practised all the mischief that his ma∣lice
could contrive against him; and at length
entered into a confederacy with one G—tr-y,
and several other abandoned wretches, who, as
before said, under various pretences of being able
to make material discoveries, and otherwise to
serve the cause, had found means to be employed
in some extra-business relating to it, tho' their
real intention was to betray the claimant.</P>
<P>These confederates, in conjunction with some
other auxiliaries of infamous character, being in∣formed
that Mr. M—r was on the point of securing
a considerable sum, to enable him to prosecute Mr.
An—y's right, and to bring it to a happy conclu∣sion▪
<PB N="233" REF="239"/>
contrived a deep laid scheme to disappoint
him in it, and at once to ruin the cause. And
previous measures being taken for that wicked
purpose, they imposed upon the young gentle∣man's
inexperience and credulity, by insinuations
equally false, plausible, and malicious; to which
they at length gained his belief, by the mention
of some circumstances that gave what they al∣leged
an air of probability, and even of truth.
They swore that Mr. M—had taken out an
action against him for a very large sum of money;
that they had actually seen the writ; that the
intention of it was to throw him into prison for
life, and ruin his cause, in consequence of an
agreement made by him with lord A—ey, and
his other enemies, to retrieve the money that
he had laid out in the cause.</P>
<P>This plausible tale was enforced with such an
air of truth, candor, and earnest concern for his
safety, and was strengthened by so many impre∣cations,
and corroborating circumstances of their
invention, as would have staggered one of much
greater experience, and knowledge of mankind,
than Mr. A—ey could be supposed at that time.
The notion of perpetual imprisonment, and the
certain ruin they made him believe his cause was
threatened with, worked upon his imagination to
such a degree, that he suffered himself to be led
like a lamb to the slaughter, by this artful band
of villains; who secreted him at the lodgings of
one Pr—nt—ce, an intimate of G—y's, for
several days, under colour of his being hunted
by bailiffs employed by Mr. M—, where he was
not only obliged by them to change his name,
but even his wife was not suffered to have access
to him.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="240"/>
Their design was to have sold him, or drawn
him into a ruinous compromise with his adversa∣ries,
for a valuable consideration to themselves.
But as no ties are binding among such a knot of
villains, the rest of the conspirators were jockied
by G—st—ey; who, in order to monopolize the
advantage to himself, hurried his prize into the
country, and secreted him even from his conse∣derates,
in a place of concealment one hundred
miles from London, under the same ridiculous
pretence of M—'s having taken out a writ
against him, and of bailiffs being in pursuit of
him every where round London.</P>
<P>He was no sooner there than G—st—ey, as a
previous step to the other villany he intended,
tricked him out of a bond for six thousand pounds,
under colour of his having a person ready to ad∣vance
the like sum upon it, as an immediate fund
for carrying on his cause; assuring him, at the
same time, that he had a set of gentlemen ready,
who were willing to advance twenty-five thou∣sand
pounds more for the same purpose, and to
allow him five hundred pounds a year for his
maintenance, 'till his cause should be made an
end of, provided that Mr. M—should have no
further concern with him or his cause.</P>
<P>Mr. A—ey, having by this time received some
intimations of the deceit that had been put upon
him, made answer, that he should look upon
himself as a very ungrateful monster, indeed, if
he deserted a person who had saved his life, and
so generously ventured his own, together with
his fortune, in his cause, until he should first be
certain of the truth of what was alleged of him,
and absolutely rejected the proposal. G—st—ey,
who had no other view in making it than to
<PB N="235" REF="241"/>
cover the secret villany he meditated against him,
and to facilitate the execution thereof; easily re∣ceded
from it, when he found Mr. A—ey so
averse to it, and undertook nevertheless to raise
the money; adding, that he might, if he pleased,
return to Mr. M—whenever it was secured.
The whole drift of this pretended undertaking to
raise the twenty-five thousand pounds, was only
to lay a foundation for a dexterous contrivance
to draw Mr. A—ey unwarily into the execution
of a deed, relinquishing all his right and title,
under a notion of its being a deed to secure the
repayment of that sum.</P>
<P>G—ft—ey having, as he imagined, so far
paved the way for the execution of such a deed,
enters into an agreement with an agent, em∣ployed
for that purpose by Mr. A—ey's adver∣saries,
purporting, that in consideration of the
payment of a bond for six thousand pounds, which
he, G—st—ey, had, as he pretended, laid out in
Mr. A—ey's cause, and of an annuity of seven
hundred pounds a year, he was to procure for
them from Mr. A—ey a deed, ready executed,
relinquishing all right and title to the An—ey
estate and honours. Every thing being prepared
for the execution of this infernal scheme, un∣known
to Mr. A—ey, G—st—ey then thought
proper to send for him to town from his retire∣ment,
in order, as he pretended, to execute a
security for twenty-five thousand pounds.</P>
<P>This intended victim to that villain's avarice,
no sooner arrived in town, full of hopes of money
to carry on his cause, and of agreeably surprising
his friend and protector Mr. M—with so sea∣sonable
and unexpected a reinforcement, than
an unforeseen difficulty arose, concerning the pay∣ment
<PB N="236" REF="242"/>
of G—st—ey's six thousand pound bond▪
That money was to have been raised out of the
estate of a lunatic, which could not be done
without the leave of the Court of Chancery, to
whom an account must have been given of the
intended application of it. While preparations
were making to rectify this omission, G—st—ey
immediately carried Mr. A—ey again into the
country, lest he should happen to be undeceived
by some means or other.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this wicked machination
was providentially discovered by Mr. M—r, be∣fore
it could be carried into execution, by means
of the jealousies that arose among the conspira∣tors
themselves; and was, at the same time, con∣firmed
to him by a person whom the very agent
for the An—ey party had entrusted with the
secret. M—r no sooner detected it than he com∣municated
his discovery to one of Mr. A—ey's
council, a man of great worth; and immediate∣ly
thereupon, took proper measures to defeat
it. He then found means to lay open to Mr.
A—ey himself, the treacherous scheme that was
laid for his destruction: he was highly sensible of
it; and could never afterwards reflect on the
snare that he had so unwarily been drawn into,
and had so narrowly escaped, without a mixture
of horror, shame, and gratitude to his deliverer.</P>
<P>The consummate assurance of the monsters
who were engaged in this plot, after they had
been detected, and upbraided with their treachery,
is scarce to be parallelled; for they not only
owned the fact of spiriting Mr. A—ey away, in
the manner abovementioned, but justified their
doing it, as tending to his service. They also
maintained, that they had actually secured the
<PB N="237" REF="243"/>
twenty-five thousand pounds for him, tho' they
never could name any one person who was to
have advanced the money. No man was more
active in this scheme than H—n; nor any man
more solicitous to keep Mr. A—ey up in the false
impressions he had received, or in projecting me∣thods
to ruin his protector, than he.</P>
<P>Among many other expedients for that pur∣pose,
a most malicious attempt was made to lodge
an information against him, for treasonable prac∣tices,
with the secretary of state, notwithstanding
the repeated proofs he had given of his loyalty;
and, as a preparatory step to this accusation, a
letter, which this traitor dictated, was copied by
another person, and actually sent to the earl of
C—d, importing, that the person who
copied the letter had an affair of consequence to
communicate to his lordship▪ if he would appoint
a time for receiving the information. But that
person, upon full conviction of the villany of the
scheme, absolutely refused to proceed f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rther in
it; so that his malice once more proved abortive:
and before he had time to execute any other con∣trivance
of the same nature, he was imprisoned
in this very jail for debt.</P>
<P>Here, finding his creditors inexorable, and
himself destitute of all other resource, he made
application to the very man whom he had injured
in such an outrageous manner, set forth his de∣plorable
case in the most pathetic terms, and in∣treated
him, with the most abject humility, to
use his influence in his behalf. The distress of
this varlet immediately disarmed M—r of his
resentment, and even excited his compassion;
and, without sending any answer to his remon∣strances,
he interce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for him with his credi∣tors:
<PB N="238" REF="244"/>
and the person to whom he was chiefly in∣debted,
refusing to release him without security,
this unwearied benefactor joined with the prisoner
in a bond for above one hundred and forty pounds,
by which he obtained his release.</P>
<P>He was no sooner discharged, however, than
he entered into fresh combinations with G—y
and others, in order to thwart his deliverer in his
schemes of raising money, and otherwise to dis∣tress
and deprive him of liberty; for which pur∣pose,
no art or industry (perjury not excepted)
hath been spared. And, what is still more extra∣ordinary,
this per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idious monster having found
money to take up the bond, in consequence of
which he regained his freedom, hath procured a
writ against M—r, upon that very obligation;
and taken assignments to some other debts of that
gentleman, with the same christian intention.
But, hitherto, he hath, by surprising sagacity
and unshaken resolution, baffled all their infernal
contrivances, and retorted some of their machi∣nations
on their own heads: and at this time,
when he is supposed by some, and represented by
others, as under the circumstances of oblivion
and despondence, he proceeds in his design with
the utmost calmness and intrepidity, meditating
schemes, and ripening measures, that will one
day confound his enemies, and attract the notice
and admiration of mankind.”</P>
<P>Peregrine, having thanked the priest for his
obliging information, expressed his surprize at the
scandalous inattention of the world to an affair of
such importance; observing, that, by such inhu∣man
neglect, this unfortunate young gentleman,
Mr. A—ey, was absolutely deprived of all the
benefit of society; the sole end of which is, to
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
protect the rights, redress the grievances, and
promote the happiness of individuals. As for
the character of M—r, he said it was so roman∣tically
singular in all its circumstances, that, tho'
other motives were wanting, curiosity alone
would induce him to seek his acquaintance; but
he did not at all wonder at the ungrateful returns
which had been made to his generosity by H—n,
and many others, whom he had served in a man∣ner
that few, besides himself, would have done;
for he had been long convinced of the truth
conveyed in these lines of a celebrated Italian
author:</P>
<P>Li beneficii, the per la loro grandezza, non
puonno esser guiderdonati, con la scelerata moneta
dell' ingratitudine, sono pagati.</P>
<P>“The story which you have related of that
young gentleman, (said he) bears a very strong
resemblance to the fate of a Spanish nobleman,
as it was communicated to me by one of his own
intimate friends at Paris. The countess d'Al∣varez
died immediately after the birth of a son,
and the husband surviving her but three years,
the child was left sole heir to his honours and
estate, under the guardianship of his uncle, who
had a small fortune and a great many children.
This inhuman relation, coveting the wealth of
his infant ward, formed a design against the life
of the helpless orphan, and trusted the execution
of it to his valet de chambre, who was tempted
to undertake the murder by the promise of a con∣siderable
reward. He accordingly stabbed the
boy with a knife, in three different places, on
the right side of his neck: but, as he was not
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
used to such barbarous attempts, his hand failed
in the performance; and he was seized with such
remorse, that, percei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the wounds were not
mortal, he carried the hapless victim to the house
of a surgeon, by whose care they were healed:
and in the mean time, that he might not forfeit
his recompence, found means to persuade his
employer, that his orders were performed. A
bundle being made up for the purpose, was pub∣lickly
interred as the body of the child, who was
said to have been suddenly carried off by a con∣vulsion;
and the uncle, without opposition, suc∣ceeded
to his honours and estate. The boy being
cured of his hurts, was, about the age of six,
delivered, with a small sum of money, to a mer∣chant
just embarking for Turkey; who was given
to understand, that he was the bastard of a man
of quality; and that, for family reasons, it was
necessary to conceal his birth.</P>
<P>While the unfortunate orphan remained in this
deplorable state of bondage, all the children of
the usurper died one after another; and he him∣self
being taken dangerously ill, attributed all his
afflictions to the just judgment of God, and com∣municated
his anxiety on that subject to the
valet de chambre, who had been employed in the
murder of his nephew. That domestic, in order
to quiet his master's conscience, and calm the
perturbation of his spirits, confessed what he had
done, and gave him hopes of still finding the
boy, by dint of industry and expence. The un∣happy
child being the only hope of the family of
Alvarez, the uncle immediately ordered a minute
inquiry to be set on foot; in consequence of
which he was informed, that the orphan had been
sold to a Turk, who had afterwards transferred
<PB N="241" REF="247"/>
him to an English merchant, by whom he was
conveyed to London.</P>
<P>An express was immediately dispatched to this
capital, where he understood that the unhappy
exile had, in consideration of his faithful ser∣vices,
been bound apprentice to a French barber-surgeon;
and after he had sufficiently qualified
himself in that profession, been received into the
family of the count de Gallas, at that time the
emperor's embassador at the court of London.
From the house of this nobleman, he was traced
into the service of count d'Ober<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>torf, where he
had married his lady's chamber-maid, and then
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one to settle as a surgeon in Bohemia.</P>
<P>In the course of these inquiries, several years
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>psed; his uncle, who was very much attached
to the house of Austria, lived at Barcelona, when
the father of this empress queen resided in that
city, and lent him a very considerable sum of
money in the most pressing emergency of his af∣fairs:
and when that prince was on the point of
returning to Germany, the old count finding his
end approaching, sent his father confessor to his
majesty, with a circumstantial account of the
barbarity he had practised against his nephew,
for which he implored forgiveness, and begg'd he
would give orders, that the orphan, when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound,
should inherit the dignities and fortune which he
had unjustly usurped.</P>
<P>His majesty assured the old man, that he might
make himself easy on that score, and ordered the
confessor to follow him to Vienna, immediately
after the count's death, in order to assist his en∣deavours
in finding out the injured heir. The
priest did not fail to yield obedience to this com∣mand:
<PB N="242" REF="248"/>
he informed himself of certain natu∣ral
marks on the young count's body, which
were known to the nurse and women who at∣tended
him in his infancy; and, with a gen∣tleman
whom the emperor ordered to accompany
him, set out for Bohemia, where he soon found
the object of his inquiry, in the capacity of major
domo to a nobleman of that country, he having
quitted his profession of surgery for that office.</P>
<P>He was not a little surprized, when he found
himself circumstantially catechised about the par∣ticulars
of his life, by persons commissioned for
that purpose by the emperor. He told them,
that he was absolutely ignorant of his own birth,
though he had been informed, during his resi∣dence
in Turkey, that he was the bastard of a
Spanish grandee, and gave them a minute detail
of the pilgrimage he had undergone. This in∣formation
agreeing with the intelligence which
the priest had already received, and being corro∣borated
by the marks upon his body, and the very
scars of the wounds which had been inflicted upon
him in his infancy, the confessor, without fur∣ther
hesitation, saluted him by the name of count
d'Alvarez, grandee of Spain, and explained the
whole mystery of his fortune.</P>
<P>If he was agreeably amazed at this explana∣tion,
the case was otherwise with his wife, who
thought herself in great danger of being aban∣doned
by an husband of such high rank; but he
immediately dispelled her apprehension, by as∣suring
her, that as she had shared in his adver∣sity,
she should also partake of his good fortune.
He set out immediately for Vienna, to make his
acknowledgements to the emperor, who favoured
<PB N="243" REF="249"/>
him with a very gracious reception, promised to
use his influence, so that he might enjoy the ho∣nours
and estate of his family; and, in the mean
time, acknowledged himself his debtor for four
hundred thousand florins, which he had borrowed
from his uncle. He threw himself at the feet of
his august protector, expressed the most grateful
sense of his goodness, and begg'd he might be
permitted to settle in some of his imperial ma∣jesty's
dominions.</P>
<P>This request was immediately granted; he was
allowed to purchase land in any part of the here∣ditary
dominions of the house of Austria, to the
amount of the sum I have mentioned; and made
choice of the country of Ratibor in Silesia, where,
in all probability, he still resides.”</P>
<P>Peregrine had scarce finished this narrative,
when he perceived Mr. M—r slip something
into the hand of the young man with whom he
had been conversing at the other end of the room,
and rise up from the table, in order to take his
leave. He at once understood the meaning of
this conveyance, and longed for an opportunity
to be acquainted with such a rare instance of pri∣mitive
benevolence; but the consciousness of his
present situation hindered him from making any
advance, that might be construed into forward∣ness
or presumption.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is surprised with the appearance of Hatchway
and Pipes, who take up their habitation in his
neighbourhood, contrary to his inclination and ex∣press
desire.</HEAD>
<P>BEING now regularly initiated in the mys∣teries
of the Fleet, and reconciled in some
measure to the customs of the place, he began
to bear the edge of reflection without wincing;
and thinking it would be highly imprudent in him
to defer, any longer, the purposes by which only
he could enjoy any ease and satisfaction in his
confinement, he resolved to resume his task of
translating, and every week compose an occa∣sional
paper, by way of revenge upon the mini∣ster,
against whom he had denounced eternal
war. With this view he locked himself up in
his chamber, and went to work with great eager∣ness
and application; when he was interrupted by
a ticket-porter, who, putting a letter in his hand,
vanished in a moment, before he had time to
peruse the contents.</P>
<P>Our hero, opening the billet, was not a little
surprised to find a bank-note for fifty pounds,
inclosed in a blank sheet of paper; and having
exercised his memory and penetration on the sub∣ject
of this unexpected windfall, had just con∣cluded,
that it could come from no other than
the lady who had so kindly visited him a few days
before, when his ears were suddenly invaded by
the well-known sound of that whistle which al∣ways
hung about the neck of Pipes, as a memo∣rial
of his former occupation; and this tune
<PB N="245" REF="251"/>
being performed, he heard the noise of a wooden
leg ascending the stair; upon which he opened
his door, and beheld his friend Hatchway, with
his old ship-mate at his back.</P>
<P>After a cordial shake of the hand, with the
usual salutation of “What cheer, cousin Pickle?”
honest Jack seated himself without ceremony;
and casting his eyes around the apartment, “Split
my topstay-sail! (said he, with an arch sneer)
you have got into a snug birth, cousin. Here
you may fit all weathers, without being turned
out to take your watch, and no fear of the ship's
dragging her anchor. You ha'n't much room
to spare, 'tis true: an' I had known as how you
stowed so close, Tom should have slung my own
hammock for you, and then you mought have
knocked down this great lubberly hurricane house.
But, mayhap, you turn in double, and so you
don't chuse to trust yourself and your doxy to a
clue and canvas.”</P>
<P>Pickle bore his jokes with great good-humour,
rallied him in his turn about the dairy-maid at
the garrison, enquired about his friends in the
country, asked if he had been to visit his niece,
and, finally, expressed a desire of knowing the
cause of his journey to London. The lieutenant
satisfied his curiosity in all these particulars; and,
in answer to the last question, observed, that
understanding, from the information of Pipes,
that he was land-locked, he had come from the
country in order to tow him into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffing. “I
know not how the wind sits (said he); but if so
be, as three thousand pounds will bring you clear
of the cape, say the word, and you shan't lie
wind-bound another glass, for want of the
money.”</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="252"/>
This was an offer which few people, in our
hero's situation, would have altogether refused;
especially as he had all the reason in the world to
believe, that, far from being a vain, unmeaning
compliment, it was the genuine tribute of friend∣ship,
which the lieutenant would have willingly,
ay and with pleasure, paid. Nevertheless, Pere∣grine
peremptorily refused his assistance, tho' not
without expressing himself in terms of acknow∣ledgment
suitable to the occasion; and told him,
it would be time enough to make use of his gene∣rosity,
when he should find himself destitute of
all other resource. Jack employed all his rheto∣rick,
with a view of persuading him to take this
opportunity to procure his own enlargement;
and, finding his arguments ineffectual, insisted
upon his accepting an immediate supply for his
necessary occasions; swearing, with great vehe∣mence,
that he would never return to the gari∣son,
unless he would put him upon the footing of
any other tenant, and receive his rent accord∣ingly.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman as positively swore, that
he never would consider him in that light; re∣monstrating,
that he had long ago settled the
house upon him for life, as a pledge of his own
esteem, as well as in conformity with the com∣modore's
desire; and beseeching him to return to
his usual avocations, protested that, if ever his
situation should subject him to the necessity of
borrowing from his friends, Mr. Hatchway should
be the first man to whom he would apply himself
for succour. To convince him that this was not
the case at present, he produced the bank-note,
which he had received in the letter, together
with his own ready money; and mentioned some
<PB N="247" REF="253"/>
other funds, which he invented <HI>extempore,</HI> in
order to amuse the lieutenant's concern. In the
close of this expostulation, he desired Pipes to
conduct Mr. Hatchway to the coffee-house,
where he might entertain himself with the news∣papers
for half an hour; during which he would
put on his cloaths, and bespeak something for
dinner, that they might enjoy each other's com∣pany,
as long as his occasions would permit him
to stay in that place.</P>
<P>The two sailors were no sooner gone, than he
took up the pen, and wrote the following letter,
in which he inclosed the bank-note, to his gene∣rous
benefactress:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR humanity is not more ingenious than
my suspicion. In vain you attempt to im∣pose
upon me by an act of generosity, which no
person upon earth, but your ladyship, is capable
of committing. Tho' your name was not sub∣scribed
on the paper, your sentiments were fully
displayed in the contents, which I must beg leave
to restore, with the same sense of gratitude, and
for the same reasons I expressed, when last I had
the honour to converse with you upon this sub∣ject.
Tho' I am deprived of my liberty, by the
villainy and ingratitude of mankind, I am not
yet destitute of the other conveniencies of life;
and, therefore, beg to be excused from incurring
an unnecessary addition to that load of obligation
you have already laid upon,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE>
Your ladyship's most devoted,
Humble servant,
<SIGNED>Peregrine Pickle.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="248" REF="254"/>
Having dressed himself, and repaired to the
place of appointment, he dispatched this epistle
by the hands of Pipes, who was ordered to leave
it at her ladyship's house, without staying for an
answer; and in the mean time gave directions
for dinner, which he and his friend Hatchway
ate very chearfully in his own apartment, after
he had entertained him with a sight of all the
curiosities in the place. During their repast,
Jack repeated his kind offers to our adventurer,
who declined them with his former obstinacy,
and begged he might be no more importuned on
that subject: but, if he insisted upon giving some
fresh proofs of his friendship, he might have an
opportunity of exhibiting it in taking Pipes un∣der
his care and protection; for nothing affected
him so much as his inability to provide for such
a faithful adherent.</P>
<P>The lieutenant desired he would give himself
no trouble upon that score; he being, of his own
accord, perfectly well disposed to befriend his
old ship-mate, who should never want, while he
had a shilling to spare. But he began to drop
some hints of an intention to fix his quarters in
the Fleet, observing, that the air seemed to be
very good in that place, and that he was tired of
living in the country. What he said did not
amount to a plain declaration, and therefore Pe∣regrine
did not answer it as such, tho' he per∣ceived
his drift; and took an opportunity of de∣scribing
the inconveniences of the place, in such
a manner, as he hoped would deter him from
putting such an extravagant plan in execution.</P>
<P>This expedient, however, far from answering
the end proposed, had a quite contrary effect,
and furnished Hatchway with an argument against
<PB N="249" REF="255"/>
his own unwillingness to quit such a disagreeable
place. And, in all probability, Jack would have
been more explicit, with regard to the scheme he
had proposed, if the conversation had not been
interrupted by the arrival of Cadwallader, who
never failed in the performance of his diurnal
visit. Hatchway, conjecturing that this stranger
might have some private business with his friend,
quitted the apartment, on pretence of taking a
turn: and meeting Pipes at the door, desired his
company to the Bear, by which name the open
space is distinguished; where, during a course of
perambulation, these two companions held a
council upon Pickle: in consequence of which it
was determined, since he obstinately persisted to
refuse their assistance, that they should take lodg∣ings
in his neighbourhood, with a view of being
at hand to minister unto his occasions, in spite of
his false delicacy, according to the emergency of
his affairs.</P>
<P>This resolution being taken, they consulted the
bar-keeper of the coffee-house about lodging,
and she directed them to the warden; to whom
the lieutenant, in his great wisdom, represented
himself as a kinsman to Peregrine, who, rather
than leave that young gentleman by himself to
the unavoidable discomforts of a prison, was in∣clined
to keep him company, 'till such time as
his affairs could be put in order. This measure
he the more anxiously desired to take, because
the prisoner was sometimes subject to a disordered
imagination, upon which occasion he stood in
need of extraordinary attendance; and therefore
he (the lieutenant) intreated the warden to ac∣commodate
him with a lodging for himself and
his servant, for which he was ready to make any
<PB N="250" REF="256"/>
reasonable acknowledgment. The warden, who
was a sensible and humane man, could not help
applauding his resolution; and several rooms
being at that time unoccupied, he put him im∣mediately
in possession of a couple, which were
forthwith prepared for his reception.</P>
<P>This affair being settled to his satisfaction, he
dispatched Pipes for his portmanteau; and re∣turning
to the coffee-house, sound Peregrine,
with whom he spent the remaining part of the
evening. Our hero, taking it for granted that
he proposed to set out for the garison next day,
wrote a memorandum of some books which he
had left in that habitation, and which he now
desired Jack to send up to town by the waggon,
directed for Mr. Crabtree; and cautioned him
against giving the least hint of his misfortune in
the neighbourhood, that it might remain, as long
as possible, concealed from the knowledge of his
sister, (who, he knew, would afflict herself im∣moderately
at the news) nor reach the ears of
the rest of his family, who would exult and
triumph over his distress.</P>
<P>Hatchway listened to his injunctions with great
attention, and promised to demean himself ac∣cordingly:
then the discourse shifted to an agree∣able
recapitulation of the merry scenes they had
formerly acted together; and the evening being
pretty far advanced, Peregrine, with seeming re∣luctance,
told him that the gates of the Fleet
would in a few minutes be shut for the night,
and that there was an absolute necessity for his
withdrawing to his lodging. Jack replied, that
he could not think of parting with him so soon,
after such a long separation; and that he was de∣termined
to stay with him an hour or two longer,
<PB N="251" REF="257"/>
if he should be obliged to take up his lodging in
the streets. Pickle, rather than disoblige his
guest, indulged him in his desire, and resolved to
give him a share of his own bed. A pair of
chickens and 'sparagus were bespoken for supper,
at which Pipes attended with an air of internal
satisfaction; and the bottle was bandied about in
a jovial manner 'till midnight, when the lieu∣tenant
rose up to take his leave, observing, that
being fatigued with riding, he was inclined to
turn-in. Pipes, upon this intimation, produced
a lanthorn ready lighted; and Jack, shaking his
entertainer by the hand, wished him good-night,
and promised to visit him again betimes in the
morning.</P>
<P>Peregrine, imagining that this behaviour pro∣ceeded
from the wine, which he had plentifully
drank, told him, that if he was disposed to sleep,
his bed was ready prepared in the room, and or∣dered
his attendant to undress his master; upon
which Mr. Hatchway gave him to understand,
that he had no occasion to incommode his friend,
having already provided a lodging for himself:
and the young gentleman demanding an explana∣tion,
he frankly owned what he had done, say∣ing,
“You gave me such a dismal account of
the place, that I could not think of leaving you
in it without company.” Our young gentle∣man,
who was naturally impatient of benefits,
and foresaw that this uncommon instance of
Hatchway's friendship would encroach upon the
plan which he had formed for his own subsistence,
by engrossing his time and attention, so as that
he should not be able to prosecute his labours;
closeted the lieutenant next day, and demon∣strated
to him the folly and ill consequences of
<PB N="252" REF="258"/>
the step he had taken. He observed, that the
world in general would look upon it as the effect
of mere madness; and, if his relations were so
disposed, they might make it the foundation of a
statute of lunacy against him; that his absence
from the garison must be a very great detriment
to his private affairs; and, lastly, that his presence
in the Fleet would be a very great hindrance to
Pickle himself, whose hope of regaining his li∣berty
altogether depended upon his being de∣tached
from all company and interruption.</P>
<P>To these remonstrances Jack replied, that, as
to the opinion of the world, it was no more to
him than a rotten net-line; and if his relations
had a mind to have his upper works condemned,
he did not doubt but he should be able to stand
the survey, without being declared unfit for ser∣vice;
that he had no affairs at the garison, but
such as would keep cold; and with regard to
Pickle's being interrupted by his presence, he gave
him his word, that he would never come along∣side
of him, except when he should give him the
signal for holding discourse. In conclusion, he
signified his resolution to stay where he was, at
all events, without making himself accountable
to any person whatsoever.</P>
<P>Peregrine seeing him determined, desisted from
any further importunity; resolving, however, to
tire him out of his plan by reserve and superci∣lious
neglect; for he could not bear the thought
of being so notoriously obliged by any person upon
earth. With this view he quitted the lieute∣nant,
upon some slight pretence; after having
told him, that he could not have the pleasure of
his company at dinner, because he was engaged
with a particular club of his fellow-prisoners.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="259"/>
Jack was a stranger to the punctilios of beha∣viour,
and therefore did not take this declaration
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but had immediate recourse to the advice
of his counsellor Mr. Pipes, who proposed that
he should go to the coffee-house and kitchen,
and give the people to understand that he would
pay for all such liquor and provisions as Mr.
Pickle should order to be sent to his own lodging.
This expedient was immediately practised; and,
as there was no credit in the place, Hatchway
deposited a sum of money, by way of security,
to the cook and the vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tner, intimating, that
there was a necessity for taking that method of
befriending his cousin Peregrine, who was subject
to strange whims, that rendered it impossible to
serve him any other way.</P>
<P>In consequence of these insinuations, it was
that same day rumoured about the Fleet, that
Mr. Pickle was an unhappy gentleman disordered
in his understanding, and that the lieutenant was
his near relation, who had subjected himself to
the inconvenience of living in a jail, with the
sole view of keeping a strict eye over his conduct.
This report, however, did not reach the ears of
our hero till next day, when he sent one of the
runners of the Fleet, who attended him, to be∣speak
and pay for a couple of pullets, and some∣thing
else, for dinner, to which he had already
invited his friend Hatchway, in hope of being
able to persuade him to retire into the country,
after he had undergone a whole day's mortifica∣tion
in the place. The messenger returned with
an assurance, that the dinner should be made ready
according to his directions, and restored the mo∣ney,
observing that his kinsman had paid for what
was bespoke.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="260"/>
Peregrine was equally surprized and disgusted
at this information, and resolved to chide the
lieutenant severely, for his unseasonable treat,
which he considered as a thing repugnant to his
reputation. Mean while, he dispatched his at∣tendant
for wine to the coffee-house, and finding
his credit bolstered up in that place by the same
means, was enraged at the presumption of Jack's
friendship, and questioned the valet about it, with
such manifestation of displeasure, that the fellow,
afraid of disobliging such a good master, frankly
communicated the story which was circulated at
his expence. The young gentleman was so much
incensed at this piece of intelligence, that he
wrote a bitter expostulation to the lieutenant,
wherein he not only retracted his invitation, but
declared that he would never converse with him,
while he should remain within the place.</P>
<P>Having thus obeyed the dictates of his anger,
he gave notice to the cook, that he should not
have occasion for what was ordered; and repair∣ing
to the coffee-house, told the landlord, that
whereas he understood the stranger with the
wooden leg had prepossessed him and others with
ridiculous notions, tending to bring the sanity of
his intellects in question; and, to confirm this
imputation, had, under the pretence of consan∣guinity,
undertaken to defray his expences; he
could not help (in justice to himself) declaring,
that the lame person was, in reality, the madman,
who had given his keepers the slip; that, there∣fore,
he (the landlord) would not find his ac∣count
in complying with his orders, and encou∣raging
him to frequent his house; and that, for
his own part, he would never enter the door, or
favour him with the least trifle of his custom, if
<PB N="255" REF="261"/>
ever he should, for the future, find himself an∣ticipated
in his payments by that unhappy lu∣natic.</P>
<P>The vintner was confounded at this retorted
charge; and, after much perplexity and delibe∣ration,
concluded, that both parties were distract∣ed;
the stranger, in paying a man's debts against
his will, and Pickle, in being offended at such
forwardness of friendship.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">These associates commit an assault upon Crabtree,
for which they are banished from the Fleet.
Peregrine begins to feel the effects of confine∣ment.</HEAD>
<P>OUR adventurer having dined at the ordi∣nary,
and in the afternoon retired to his
own apartment, as usual, with his friend Cad∣wallader;
Hatchway and his associate, after they
had been obliged to discuss the provision for which
they had paid, renewed their conference upon
the old subject; and Pipes giving his mess-mate
to understand, that Peregrine's chief confident
was the old deaf batchelor, whom he had seen at
his lodging the preceding day, Mr. Hatchway,
in his great penetration, discovered, that the
young gentleman's obstinacy proceeded from the
advice of the Misanthrope, whom, for that rea∣son,
it was their business to chastise. Pipes en∣tered
into this opinion the more willingly, as he
had all along believed the senior to be a sort of
wizzard, or some caco-daemon, whom it was not
very creditable to be acquainted with. Indeed,
he had been inspired with this notion by the
<PB N="256" REF="262"/>
insinuations of Hadgi, who had formerly dropped
some hints touching Crabtree's profound know∣ledge
in the magic art; mentioning, in particu∣lar,
his being possessed of the philosopher's stone;
an assertion to which Tom had given implicit
credit, until his master was sent to prison for
debt, when he could no longer suppose Cadwal∣lader
lord of such a valuable secret, else he would
have certainly procured the enlargement of his
most intimate friend.</P>
<P>With these sentiments he espoused the resent∣ment
of Hatchway; and they determined to seize
the supposed conjurer, with the first opportunity,
on his return from his visit to Peregrine, and,
without hesitation, exercise upon him the disci∣pline
of the pump. This plan they would have
executed that same evening, had not the misan∣thrope
luckily withdrawn himself, by accident,
before it was dark, and even before they had in∣telligence
of his retreat. But, next day, they
kept themselves upon the watch 'till he appeared,
and Pipes lifting his hat, as Crabtree passed, “O
damn ye, old Dunny (said he), you and I must
grapple by and by; and, a'gad! I shall lie so near
your quarter, that your ear-ports will let in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound, tho'f they were double caulked with
oakum.”</P>
<P>The misanthrope's ears were not quite so fast
closed, but that they received this intimation;
which, tho' delivered in terms that he did not
well understand, had such an effect upon his ap∣prehension,
that he signified his doubts to Pere∣grine,
observing, that he did not much like the
looks of that same ruffian with the wooden leg.
Pickle assured him, he had nothing to fear from
the two sailors, who could have no cause of re∣sentment
<PB N="257" REF="263"/>
against him; or, if they had, would not
venture to take any step, which they knew must
block up all the avenues to that reconcilement,
about which they were so anxious; and, more∣over,
give such offence to the governor of the
place, as would infallibly induce him to expel
them both from his territories.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this assurance, the young gen∣tleman
was not so confident of the lieutenant's
discretion, as to believe that Crabtree's fears
were altogether without foundation: he forth∣with
conjectured that Jack had taken umbrage
at an intimacy, from which he found himself
excluded, and imputed his disgrace to the insi∣nuations
of Cadwallader, whom, in all likelihood,
he intended to punish for his supposed advice.
He knew his friend could sustain no great damage
from the lieutenant's resentment, in a place which
he could immediately alarm with his cries, and
therefore wished he might fall into the snare, be∣cause
it would furnish him with a pretence of
complaint; in consequence of which, the sailors
would be obliged to shift their quarters, so as that
he should be rid of their company, in which he
at present could find no enjoyment.</P>
<P>Every thing happened as he had foreseen; the
misanthrope, in his retreat from Peregrine's
chamber, was assaulted by Hatchway and his as∣sociate,
who seized him by the collar without
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mony, and began to drag him towards the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, at which they would have certainly com∣pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mented
him with a very disagreeable bath, had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he exalted his voice in such a manner, as in
a moment brought a number of the inhabitants,
and Pickle himself to his aid. The assailants
would have persisted in their design, had the op∣position
<PB N="258" REF="264"/>
been such, as they could have faced with
any possibility of success; nor did they quit their
prey, before a dozen, at least, had come to his
rescue, and Peregrine, with a menacing aspect
and air of authority, commanded his old valet to
withdraw: then they thought proper to sheer off,
and betake themselves to close quarters, while
our hero accompanied the affrighted Cadwallader
to the gate, and exhibited to the warden a formal
complaint against the rioters, upon whom he re∣torted
the charge of lunacy, which was supported
by the evidence of twenty persons, who had been
eye-witnesses of the outrage committed against
the old gentleman.</P>
<P>The governor, in consequence of this infor∣mation,
sent a message to Mr. Hatchway, warn∣ing
him to move his lodging next day, on pain
of being expelled; and the lieutenant contuma∣ciously
refusing to comply with this intimation,
was in the morning, while he amused himself in
walking upon the bear, suddenly surrounded by
the constables of the court, who took him and
his adherent prisoners, before they were aware,
and delivered them into the hands of the turn∣keys,
by whom they were immediately dismissed,
and their baggage conveyed to the side of the
ditch.</P>
<P>This expulsion was not performed without an
obstinate opposition on the part of the delin∣quents,
who, had they not been surprized, would
have set the whole Fleet at defiance, and, in all
probability, acted divers tragedies, before they
could have been over powered. Things being
circumstanced as they were, the lieutenant did
not part with his conductor, without tweaking
his nose, by way of farewel; and Pipes, in imi∣tation
<PB N="259" REF="265"/>
of such a laudable example, communicated
a token of remembrance, in an application to the
sole eye of his attendant, who, scorning to be
out-done in this kind of courtesy, returned the
compliment with such good will, that Tom's or∣gan
performed the office of a multiplying glass.
These were mutual hints for stripping; and ac∣cordingly,
each was naked from the waist up∣wards
in a trice. A ring of butchers from the
market was immediately formed; a couple of the
reverend Flamens, who, in morning-gowns, ply
for marriages in that quarter of the town, con∣stituted
themselves seconds and umpires of the
approaching contest, and the battle began with∣out
further preparation. The combatants were,
in point of strength and agility, pretty equally
matched; but the jailor had been regularly train∣ed
to the art of bruising: he had more than once
signalized himself in public, for his prowess and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in this exercise, and lost one eye upon the
stage, in the course of his exploits. This was a
misfortune of which Pipes did not fail to take the
advantage: he had already sustained several hard
knocks upon his temples and jaw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and found it
impracticable to smite his antagonist upon the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tualling-office, so dexterously was it defended
against assault: upon which he changed his bat∣tery,
and being ambi-dexter, raised such a clatter
upon the turnkey's blind side, that this hero, be∣lieving
him left-handed, converted his attention
that way, and opposed the unenlightened side of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> face to the right-hand of Pipes, which being
thus unprovided against, slily bestowed upon him
a peg under the fifth rib, that in an instant laid
him senseless on the pavement, at the feet of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>queror, who was congratulated upon his vic∣tory,
<PB N="260" REF="266"/>
not only by his friend Hatchway, but also
by all the by-standers, particularly the priest who
had espoused his cause, and now invited the
strangers to his lodging in a neighbouring ale∣house,
where they were entertained so much to
their liking, that they determined to seek no
other habitation while they should continue in
town: and notwithstanding the disgrace and dis∣couragement
they had met with, in their endea∣vours
to serve our adventurer, they were still re∣solved
to persevere in their good offices, or, in
the vulgar phrase, to see him out.</P>
<P>While they settled themselves in this manner,
and acquired familiar connexions round all the
purlieus of the dit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, Peregrine found himself
deprived of the company of Cadwallader, who
signified by letter, that he did not chuse to ha∣zard
his person again in visiting him, while such
assassins occupied the avenues through which he
must pass; for he had been at pains to inquire
into the motions of the seamen, and informed
himself exactly of the harbour in which they
were moored.</P>
<P>Our hero had been so much accustomed to the
conversation of Crabtree, which was altogether
suitable to the singularity of his own disposition,
that he could very ill afford to be debarred of it
at this juncture, when almost every other source
of enjoyment was stopped. He was, however,
obliged to submit to the hardships of his situa∣tion;
and as the characters of his fellow-pri∣soners
did not at all improve upon him, he was
compelled to seek for satisfaction within himself.
Not but that he had an opportunity of conversing
with some people, who neither wanted sense, nor
were deficient in point of principle; yet there
<PB N="261" REF="267"/>
appeared in the behaviour of them all, without
exception, a certain want of decorum, a squalor
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sentiment, a sort of jailish cast contracted in
the course of confinement, which disgusted the
delicacy of our hero's observation. He, therefore,
detached himself from their parties as much as he
could, without giving offence to those among
whom he was obliged to live, and resumed his
labours with incredible eagerness and perse∣verance,
his spirits being supported by the success
of some severe <HI>Philippi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> which he occasionally
published against the author of his misfortune.</P>
<P>Nor was his humanity unemployed in the va∣cations
of his revenge: a man must be void of all
sympathy and compassion, who can reside among
so many miserable objects, without feeling an in∣clination
to relieve their distress. Every day almost
presented to his view such lamentable scenes, as
were most likely to attract his notice, and en∣gage
his benevolence. Reverses of fortune, at∣tended
with the most deplorable circumstances of
domestic woe, were continually intruding upon
his acquaintance; his ears were invaded with the
cries of the hapless wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, who from the enjoy∣ment
of affluence and pleasure, was forced to
follow her husband to this abode of wretchedness
and want; his eyes were every minute assailed
with the naked and meagre appearances of hunger
and cold; and his fancy teemed with a thousand
aggravations of their misery.</P>
<P>Thus situated, his purse was never shut, while
his heart remained open. Without reflecting up∣on
the slenderness of his store, he exercised his
charity to all the children of distress, and acquired
a popularity which, though pleasing, was far
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being profitable. In short, his bounty kept
<PB N="262" REF="268"/>
no pace with his circumstances, and in a little
time he was utterly exhausted. He had recourse
to his bookseller, from whom, with great diffi∣culty,
be obtained a small reinforcement; and
immediately relapsed into the same want of re∣tention.
He was conscious of his infirmity, and
found it incurable: he foresaw, that by his own
industry he should never be able to defray the
expence of these occasions; and this reflection
sunk deep into his mind: the approbation of the
public, which he had earned or might acquire,
like a cordial often repeated, began to lose its
effect upon his imagination; his health suffered
by his sedentary life and austere application; his
eye-sight failed, his appetite forsook him, his spi∣rits
decayed; so that he became melancholy, list∣less,
and altogether incapable of prosecuting the
only means he had left for his subsistence; and
(what did not at all contribute to the alleviation
of these particulars) he was given to understand
by his lawyer, that he had lost his cause, and
was condemned in costs. Even this was not
the most mortifying piece of intelligence he re∣ceived;
he at the same time learn'd, that his
bookseller was bankrupt, and his friend Crabtree
at the point of death.</P>
<P>These were comfortable considerations to a
youth of Peregrine's disposition, which was so
capricious, that the more his misery increased,
the more haughty and inflexible he became.
Rather than be beholden to Hatchway, who still
hovered about the gate, eager for an opportunity
to assist him, he chose to undergo the want o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
almost every convenience of life, and actually
pledged his wearing-apparel to an Irish pawn∣broker
in the Fleet, for money to purchase those
<PB N="263" REF="269"/>
things, without which he must have absolutely
perished. He was gradually irritated by his mis∣fortunes
into a rancorous resentment against man∣kind
in general, and his heart so alienated from
the enjoyments of life, that he did not care how
soon he quitted his miserable existence. Though
he had shocking examples of the vicissitudes of
fortune continually before his eyes, he could ne∣ver
be reconciled to the idea of living like his
fellow-sufferers, in the most abject degree of de∣pendance.
If he refused to accept of favours
from his own allies and intimate friends, whom
he had formerly obliged, it is not to be supposed
that he would listen to proposals of that kind
from any of his fellow-prisoners, with whom he
had contracted acquaintance: he was even more
cautious than ever of incurring obligations; he
now shunned his former mess-mates, in order to
avoid disagreeable tenders of friendship; and ima∣gining
that he perceived an inclination in the
clergyman, to learn the state of his finances, he
discouraged and declined the explanation, and
at length secluded himself from all society.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He receives an unexpected visit; and the clouds of
misfortune begin to separate.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE he pined in this forlorn condi∣tion,
with an equal abhorrence of the
world and himself, captain Gauntlet arrived in
town, in order to employ his interest for pro∣motion
in the army; and, in consequence of his
wife's particular desire, made it his business to
inquire for Peregrine, to whom he longed to be
<PB N="264" REF="270"/>
reconciled, even at the expence of a slight sub∣mission.
But he could hear no tidings of him,
at the place to which he was directed; and, on
the supposition that our hero had gone to reside
in the country, applied himself to his own busi∣ness,
with intention to renew his enquiries, af∣ter
that affair should be transacted. He commu∣nicated
his demands to his supposed patron, who
had assumed the merit of making him a captain,
and been gratified with a valuable present on that
consideration; and was cajoled with hopes of suc∣ceeding
in his present aim, by the same interest.</P>
<P>Mean while, he became acquainted with one
of the clerks belonging to the war office, whose
advice and assistance, he was told, would be a
furtherance to his scheme; and as he had occasion
to discourse with this gentleman, upon the cir∣cumstances
of his expectation, he learned that
the nobleman, upon whom he depended, was a
person of no consequence in the state, and alto∣gether
incapable of assisting him in his advance∣ment.
At the same time, his counsellor ex∣pressed
his surprize that captain Gauntlet did not
rather interest in his cause the noble peer, to
whose good offices he owed his last commission.</P>
<P>This remark introduced an explanation, by
which Godfrey discovered, to his infinite asto∣nishment,
the mistake in which he had continued
so long, with regard to his patron; tho' he could
not divine the motive which induced a nobleman,
with whom he had no acquaintance or connec∣tion,
to interpose his influence in his behalf.
Whatsoever that might be, he thought it was his
duty to make his acknowledgment; and for that
purpose, went next morning to his house, where
he was politely received, and given to understand,
<PB N="265" REF="271"/>
that Mr. Pickle was the person to whose friend∣ship
he was indebted for his last promotion.</P>
<P>Inexpressible were the transports of gratitude,
affection, and remorse, that took possession of
the soul of Gauntlet, when this mystery was un∣folded.
“Good heaven! (cried he, lifting up
his hands) have I lived so long in a state of ani∣mosity
with my benefactor? I intended to have
reconciled myself to him, at any rate, before I
was sensible of this obligation; but now I shall
not enjoy a moment's quiet, until I have an op∣portunity
of expressing to him my sense of his
heroic friendship. I presume, from the nature of
the favour conferred upon him, in my behalf,
that Mr. Pickle is well known to your lordship;
and I should think myself extremely happy, if
you could inform me in what part of the coun∣try
he is to be found: for the person with whom
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lodged, some time ago, could give me no in∣telligence
of his motions.”</P>
<P>The nobleman, touched with this instance of
generous self-denial in Peregrine, as well as with
the sensibility of his friend, lamented the unhap∣piness
of our hero, while he gave Gau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tlet to
understand that he had been long disordered in
his intellects, in consequence of having squan∣dered
away his fortune; and that his creditors
had thrown him into the Fleet-prison: but whe∣ther
he still continued in that confinement, or
was released from his misfortunes by death, his
lordship did not know, because he had never
enquired.</P>
<P>Godfrey no sooner received this intimation,
than (his blood boiling with grief and impatience)
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e craved pardon for his abrupt departure; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his informer on the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant, r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mbarked
<PB N="266" REF="272"/>
in his hackney-coach, and ordered himself to be
conveyed directly to the Fleet. As the vehicle
proceeded along one side of the market, he was
surprised with the appearance of Hatchway and
Pipes, who stood cheapening collyflowers at a
green-stall, their heads being cased in worsted
night-caps, half covered with their hats, and a
short tobacco-pipe in the mouth of each. He
was rejoiced at sight of the two seamen, which
he took for an happy omen of finding his friend;
and, ordering the coachman to stop the carriage,
called to the lieutenant by his name. Jack re∣plying
with an <HI>Hilloah,</HI> looked behind him, and
recognizing the face of his old acquaintance, ran
up to the coach with great eagerness, and shaking
the captain heartily by the hand, “Odd's heart!
(said he) I'm glad thou ha'st fallen in with us:
we shall now be able to find the trim of the ves∣sel,
and lay her about on the other tack. For
my own part, I have had many a consort in my
time, that is, in the way of good-fellowship, and
I always made shift to ware 'em at one time or
another: but this headstrong toad will neither
obey the helm nor the sheet; and, for aught I
know, will founder where he lies at anchor.”</P>
<P>Gauntlet, who conceived part of his meaning,
alighted immediately; and being conducted to
the sailor's lodging, was informed of every thing
that had passed between the lieutenant and Pickle.
He, in his turn, communicated to Jack the dis∣covery
which he had made, with regard to his
commission; at which the other gave no signs of
surprize: but taking the pipe from his mouth,
“Why, look ye, captain, (said he) that's not
the only good turn you have owed him. That
same money you received from the commodore,
<PB N="267" REF="273"/>
as an old debt, was all a sham, contrived by
Pickle for your service; but a' wool drive under
his bare poles, without sails and rigging, or a
mess of provision on board, rather than take the
same assistance from another man.”</P>
<P>Godfrey was not only amazed, but chagrined
at the knowledge of this anecdote; which gave
umbrage to his pride, while it stimulated his de∣sire
of doing something in return for the obliga∣tion.
He enquired into the present circumstances
of the prisoner; and understanding that he was
indisposed, and but indifferently provided with
the common necessaries of life, tho' still deaf to
all offers of assistance, began to be extremely
concerned at the account of his savage obstinacy
and pride, which would, he feared, exclude him
from the privilege of relieving him in his distress.
However, he resolved to leave no expedient un∣tried,
that might have any tendency to surmount
such destructive prejudice; and, entering the jail,
was directed to the apartment of the wretched
prisoner. He knocked softly at the door, and
when it was opened, started back with horror
and astonishment: the figure that presented itself
to his view, was the remains of his once happy
friend; but so miserably altered and disguised,
that his features were scarce cognizable. The
florid, the sprightly, the gay, the elevated youth,
was now metamorphosed into a wan, dejected,
meagre, squalid spectre; the hollow-eyed repre∣sentative
of distemper, indigence and despair:
yet his eyes retained a certain ferocity, which
threw a dismal gleam athwart the cloudiness of
his aspect, and he, in silence, viewed his old
companion with a look betokening confusion and
disdain. As for Gauntlet, he could not, with∣out
<PB N="268" REF="274"/>
emotion, behold such a woful reverse of fate,
in a person for whom he entertained the noblest
sentiments of friendship, gratitude and esteem:
his sorrow was at first too big for utterance, and
he shed a flood of tears before he could pronounce
one word.</P>
<P>Peregrine, in spite of his misanthropy, could
not help being affected with this uncommon tes∣timony
of regard; but he strove to stifle his sen∣sations:
his brows contracted themselves into a
severer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rown, his eyes kindled into the appear∣ance
of live coals; he waved with his hand, in
signal for Godfrey to be gone, and leave such a
wretch as him to the miseries of his fate; and
finding nature too strong to be suppressed, uttered
a deep groan, and wept aloud.</P>
<P>The soldier, seeing him thus melted, unable
to restrain the strong impulse of his affection,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forwards, and clasping him in his arms,
“My dearest friend, and best benefactor, (said
he) I am come hither to humble myself for the
offence I was so unhappy as to give, at our last
parting; to beg a reconciliation, to thank you
for the ease and affluence I have enjoyed through
your means, and to rescue you, in spite of your∣self,
from this melancholy situation; of which,
but an hour ago, I was utterly ignorant. Do not
deny me the satisfaction of acquitting myself, in
point of duty and obligation. You must cer∣tainly
have had some regard for a person, in
whose favour you have exerted yourself so much;
and if any part of that esteem remains, you will
not refuse him an opportunity of approving him∣self,
in some measure, worthy of it. Let me
not suffer the most mortifying of all repulses,
that of slighted friendship; but kindly sacrifice
<PB N="269" REF="275"/>
your resentment and inflexibility to the request of
one, who is at all times ready to sacrifice his
life for your honour and advantage. If you will
not yield to my intreaties, have some regard to
the wishes of my Sophy, who laid me under the
strongest injunctions to solicit your forgiveness,
even before she knew how much I was indebted
to your generosity; or, if that consideration
should be of no weight, I hope you will relax a
little for the sake of poor Emilia, whose resent∣ment
hath been long subdued by her affection,
and who now droops in secret at your neglect.”</P>
<P>Every word of this address, delivered in the
most pathetic manner, made an impression upon
the mind of Peregrine: he was affected with the
submission of his friend, who, in reality, had
given him no just cause to complain. He knew
that no ordinary motive had swayed him to a
condescension, so extraordinary in a man of his
punctilious temper: he considered it, therefore,
as the genuine effect of eager gratitude and dis∣interested
love, and his heart began to relent ac∣cordingly.
When he heard himself conjured in
the name of the gentle Sophy, his obstinacy was
quite overcome; and when Emilia was recalled
to his remembrance, his whole frame underwent
a violent agitation. He took his friend by the
hand, with a softened look; and soon as he re∣covered
the faculty of speech, which had been
overpowered in the conflict of passions that trans∣ported
him, protested, that he retained no ves∣tige
of animosity, but considered him in the light
of an affectionate comrade, the ties of whose
friendship, adversity could not unbind. He men∣tioned
Sophy in the most respectful terms; spoke
of Emilia with the most reverential awe, as the
<PB N="270" REF="276"/>
object of his inviolable love and veneration; but
disclaimed all hope of ever more attracting her
regard; and excused himself from profiting by
Godfrey's kind intention, declaring, with a re∣solute
air, that he had broke off all connection
with mankind, and that he impatiently longed
for the hour of his dissolution, which, if it should
not soon arrive by the course of nature, he was
resolved to hasten with his own hands, rather
than be exposed to the contempt, and more in∣tolerable
pity, of a rascally world.</P>
<P>Gauntlet argued against this frantic determi∣nation
with all the vehemence of expostulating
friendship; but his remonstrances did not produce
the desired effect upon our desperate hero, who
calmly refuted all his arguments, and asserted the
rectitude of his design from the pretended maxims
of reason and true philosophy.</P>
<P>While this dispute was carried on with eager∣ness
on one side, and deliberation on the other,
a letter was brought to Peregrine, who threw it
carelesly aside unopened, tho' the superscription
was in an hand-writing to which he was a
stranger; and, in all probability, the contents
would never have been perused, had not Gaunt∣let
insisted upon his waving all ceremony, and
reading it forthwith. Thus solicited, Pickle un∣sealed
the billet, which, to his no small surprize,
contained the following intimation:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mr. P. Pickle,
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS comes to inform you, that, after many
dangers and disappointments, I am, by the
blessing of God, safely arrived in the Downs, on
<PB N="271" REF="277"/>
board of the Gomberoon Indiaman, having
made a tolerable voyage; by which I hope I shall
be enabled to repay, with interest, the seven
hundred pounds which I borrowed of you before
my departure from England. I take this oppor∣tunity
of writing by our purser, who goes express
with dispatches for the company, that you may
have this satisfactory notice, as soon as possible,
relating to one whom I suppose you have long
given over as lost. I have inclosed it in a letter
to my broker, who, I hope, knows your address,
and will forward it accordingly: and I am, with
respect, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER>Your most humble servant,
<SIGNED>Benjamin Chintz.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>He had no sooner taken a cursory view of this
agreeable epistle, than his countenance cleared
up, and reaching it to his friend, with a smile,
“There (said he) is a more convincing argu∣ment,
on your side of the question, than all the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asuists in the universe can advance.” Gauntlet,
wondering at this observation, took the paper,
and casting his eyes greedily upon the contents,
congratulated him upon the receit of it, with
extravagant demonstrations of joy: “Not on
account of the sum (said he) which, upon my
honour, I would, with pleasure, pay three times
over for your convenience and satisfaction; but
because it seems to have reconciled you to life,
and disposed your mind for re-enjoying the com∣forts
of society.”</P>
<P>The instantaneous effect which this unexpected
smile of fortune produced in the appearance of
our adventurer, is altogether inconceivable! it
<PB N="272" REF="278"/>
plumped up his cheeks in a moment, unbended
and enlightened every feature of his face; ele∣vated
his head, which had begun to sink, as it
were, between his shoulders; and from a squeak∣ing,
dispirited tone, swelled up his voice to a
clear, manly accent. Godfrey, taking advan∣tage
of this favourable change, began to regale
him with prospects of future success: he reminded
him of his youth and qualifications, which were
certainly designed for better days than those he
had as yet seen; he pointed out various paths,
by which he might arrive at wealth and reputa∣tion;
he importuned him to accept of a sum
for his immediate occasions; and earnestly begged,
that he would allow him to discharge the debt
for which he was confined: observing, that
Sophy's fortune had enabled him to exhibit that
proof of his gratitude, without any detriment to
his affairs; and protesting, that he should not
believe himself in possession of Mr. Pickle's
esteem, unless he was permitted to make some
such return of good-will to the man, who had
not only raised him from indigence and scorn to
competence and reputable rank, but also im∣powered
him to obtain the possession of an excel∣lent
woman, who had filled up the measure of
his felicity.</P>
<P>Peregrine declared himself already overpaid for
all his good offices, by the pleasure he enjoyed
in employing them, and the happy effects they
had produced, in the mutual satisfaction of two
persons so dear to his affection; and assured his
friend, that one time or other he would set his
conscience at ease, and remove the scruples of
his honour, by having recourse to his assistance:
but, at present, he could not make use of his
<PB N="273" REF="279"/>
friendship, without giving just cause of offence
to honest Hatchway, who was prior to him in
point of solicitation, and had manifested his at∣tachment
with surprising obstinacy and per∣severance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="110" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine reconciles himself to the lieutenant; and
renews his connection with society. Divers plans
are projected in his behalf; and he has occasion
to exhibit a remarkable proof of self-denial.</HEAD>
<P>THE captain, with reluctance, yielded the
preference in this particular to Jack, who
was immediately invited to a conference, by a
note subscribed with Pickle's own hand. He was
found at the prison-gate waiting for Gauntlet, to
know the issue of his negotiation; and no sooner
received this summons than he set all his sails,
and made the best of his way to his friend's
apartment; being admitted by the turnkey, in
consequence of Peregrine's request, communi∣cated
by the messenger who carried the billet.
Pipes followed close in the wake of his ship∣mate;
and, in a few minutes after the note had
been dispatched, Peregrine and Gauntlet hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
the sound of the stump, ascending the wooden
stair-case with such velocity, that they at first
mistook it for the application of drum-sticks to
the head of an empty barrel. This uncommon
speed, however, was attended with a misfortune:
he chanced to overlook a small defect in one of
the steps, and, his prop plunging into a hole, he
sell backwards, to the imminent danger of his
life. Tom was luckily at his back, and sustained
<PB N="274" REF="280"/>
him in his arms, so as that he escaped without
any other damage than the loss of his wooden
leg, which was snapt in the middle, by the weight
of his body, in falling: and such was his impa∣tience,
that he would not give himself the
trouble to disengage the fractured member; but
unbuckling the whole equipage in a trice, left it
sticking in the crevice, saying a rotten cable was
not worth heaving up, and, in this natural state
of mutilation, hopp'd into the room with infi∣nite
expedition.</P>
<P>Peregrine taking him cordially by the hand,
seated him upon one side of his bed; and after
having made an apology for that reserve, of which
he had so justly complained, asked, if he could
conveniently accommodate him with the loan of
twenty guineas. The lieutenant, without open∣ing
his mouth, pulled out his purse; and Pipes,
who overheard the demand, applying the whistle
to his lips, performed a loud overture, in token
of his joy. Matters being thus brought to an
accommodation, our hero told the captain, that
he should be glad of his company at dinner, with
their common friend Hatchway, if he would in
the mean time leave him to the ministry of Pipes;
and the soldier went away for the present, in
order to pay a short visit to his uncle, who, at
that time, languished in a declining state of
health, promising to return at the appointed
hour.</P>
<P>The lieutenant, having survey'd the dismal
appearance of his friend, could not help being
moved at the spectacle, and began to upbraid him
wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h his obstinate pride, which (he swore) was
no better than self-murder. But the young gen∣tleman
interrupted him in the course of his mo∣ralizing,
<PB N="275" REF="281"/>
by telling him he had reasons for his
conduct, which, perhaps, he should impart in
due season; but, at present, his design was to
alter that plan of behaviour, and make himself
some amends for the misery he had undergone.
He accordingly sent Pipes to redeem his cloaths
from the pawnbroker's wardrobe, and bespeak
something comfortable for dinner. And when
Godfrey came back, he was very agreeably sur∣prised
to see such a favourable alteration in his
externals; for, by the assistance of his valet, he
had purified himself from the dregs of his distress,
and now appeared in a decent suit, with clean
linnen, while his face was disencumbered of the
hair that overshadowed it, and his apartment
prepared for the reception of company.</P>
<P>They enjoyed their meal with great satisfac∣tion,
entertaining one another with a recapitu∣lation
of their former adventures at the garison;
and in the afternoon, Gauntlet taking his leave,
in order to write a letter to his sister, at the desire
of his uncle, who finding his end approaching,
wanted to see her without loss of time, Peregrine
made his appearance on the bear, and was com∣plimented
on his coming abroad again, not only
by his old mess-mates, who had not seen him for
many weeks, but by a number of those objects
whom his liberality had fed, before his funds
were exhausted. Hatchway was, by his interest
with the warden, put in possession of his former
quarters, and Pipes dispatched to make inqui∣ry
about Crabtree at his former lodging, where
he learn'd, that the Misanthrope, after a very
severe fit of illness, was removed to Kensington
Gravel-pits, for the convenience of breathing a
purer air than that of London.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="282"/>
In consequence of this information, Peregrine,
who knew the narrowness of the old gentleman's
fortune, next day desired his friend Gauntlet to
take the trouble of visiting him, in his name,
with a letter, in which he expressed great con∣cern
for his indisposition, gave him notice of the
fortunate intelligence he had received from the
Downs, and conjured him to make use of his
purse, if he was in the least hampered in his cir∣cumstances.
The captain took coach imme∣diately,
and set out for the place, according to
the direction which Pipes had procured.</P>
<P>Cadwallader having seen him at Bath, knew
him again at first sight; and, though reduced to
a skeleton, believed himself in such a fair way of
doing well, that he would have accompanied him
to the Fleet immediately, had not he been re∣strained
by his nurse, who had been, by his phy∣sician,
invested with full authority to dispute and
oppose his will, in every thing that she should
think prejudicial to his health; for he was con∣sidered,
by those who had the care of him, as
an old humourist, not a little distempered in his
brain▪ He inquired particularly about the sailors,
who (he said) had deterred him from carrying
on his usual correspondence with Pickle, and
been the immediate cause of his indisposition, by
terrifying him into a sever: and understanding
that the breach between Pickle and Hatchway
was happily cemented, and that he was no longer
in any danger from the lieutenant's resentment, he
promised to be at the Fleet with the first conve∣nient
opportunity; and, in the mean time, wrote
an answer to Peregrine's letter, importing, that
he was obliged to him for his offer, but had not
the least occasion for his assistance.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="283"/>
In a few days, our adventurer recovered his
vigour, complexion and vivacity; he mingled
again in the diversions and parties of the place;
he received, in a little time, the money he had
lent upon bottomry, which, together with the
interest, amounted to upwards of eleven hundred
pounds. The possession of this sum, while it
buoyed up his spirits, involved him in perplexity.
Sometimes he thought it was incumbent upon
him, as a man of honour, to employ the greatest
part of it, in diminishing the debt for which he
suffered; on the other hand, he considered that
obligation effaced, by the treacherous behaviour
of his creditor, who had injured him to ten times
the value of the sum; and in these sentiments,
entertained thoughts of attempting his escape
from prison, with a view of conveying himself,
with the shipwreck of his fortune, to another
country, in which he might use it to better ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>Both suggestions were attended with such
doubts and difficulties, that he hesitated between
them, and for the present, laid out a thousand
pounds in stock, the interest of which, together
with the fruits of his own industry, he hoped,
would support him above want in his confine∣ment,
until something should occur, that would
point out the expediency of some other deter∣mination.
Gauntlet still insisted upon having
the honour of obtaining his liberty, at the ex∣pence
of taking up his notes to Gleanum, and ex∣horted
him to purchase a commission with part
of the money which he had retrieved. The lieu∣tenant
affirmed, that it was his privilege to pro∣cure
the release of his cousin Pickle, because he
enjoyed a very handsome sum by his aunt, which
<PB N="278" REF="284"/>
of right belonged to the young gentleman, to
whom he was, moreover, indebted for the use
of his furniture, and for the very house that
stood over his head; and that, although he had
already made a will in his favour, he should never
be satisfied, nor easy in his mind, so long as he
remained deprived of his liberty, and wanted any
of the conveniences of life.</P>
<P>Cadwallader, who by this time assisted at their
councils, and was best acquainted with the pecu∣liarity
and unbending disposition of the youth,
proposed, that seeing he was so averse to obliga∣tions,
Mr. Hatchway should purchase of him
the garison with its appendages, which, at a
moderate price, would sell for more money than
would be sufficient to discharge his debts; and
that, if the servile subordination of the army
did not suit his inclinations, he might, with his
reversion, buy a comfortable annuity, and retire
with him to the country, where he might live
absolutely independent, and entertain himself, as
usual, with the ridiculous characters of mankind.</P>
<P>This plan was, to Pickle, less disagreeable than
any other project which had as yet been suggested;
and the lieutenant declared himself ready to exe∣cute
his part of it, without delay: but the sol∣dier
was mortified at the thoughts of seeing his
assistance unnecessary, and eagerly objected to the
retirement, as a scheme that would blast the
fairest promises of fame and fortune, and bury
his youth and talents in solitude and obscurity.
This earnest opposition on the part of Gauntlet,
hindered our adventurer from forming any imme∣diate
resolution; which was also retarded by his
unwillingness to part with the garrison upon any
terms, because he looked upon it as a part of his
<PB N="279" REF="285"/>
inheritance, which he could not dispose of, with∣out
committing an insult upon the memory of
the deceased commodore.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="111" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is engaged in a very extraordinary correspon∣dence,
which is interrupted by a very unexpected
event.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE this affair was in agitation, the
captain told him, in the course of con∣versation,
that Emilia was arrived in town, and
had enquired about Mr. Pickle with such an
eagerness of concern, as seemed to proclaim that
she was in some measure informed of his misfor∣tune:
he, therefore, desired to know if he might
be allowed to make her acquainted with his situa∣tion,
provided he should be again importuned by
her on that subject, which he had at first industri∣ously
waved.</P>
<P>This proof, or rather presumption of her sym∣pathising
regard, did not fail to operate power∣fully
upon the bosom of Peregrine, which was
immediately filled with those tumults which love,
ill stifled, frequently excites. He observed, that
his disgrace was such as could not be effectually
concealed; therefore he saw no reason for de∣priving
himself of Emilia's compassion, since he
was for ever excluded from her affection; and
desired Godfrey to present to his sister the lowly
respects of a despairing lover.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding his declaration of despon∣dence
on this head, his imagination involuntarily
teemed with more agreeable ideas: the proposal
of Crabtree had taken root in his reflection, and
<PB N="280" REF="286"/>
he could not help forming plans of pastoral feli∣city,
in the arms of the lovely Emilia, remote
from those pompous scenes, which he now de∣tested
and despised. He amused his fancy with
the prospect of being able to support her in a
state of independency, by means of the slender
annuity which it was in his power to purchase,
together with the fruits of those endeavours,
which would profitably employ his vacant hours;
and foresaw provision for his growing family in
the friendship of the lieutenant, who had already
constituted him his heir. He even parcelled out
his hours, among the necessary cares of the world,
the pleasures of domestic bliss, and the enjoy∣ments
of a country life; and spent the night
in ideal parties with his charming bride, some∣times
walking by the sedgy bank of some transpa∣rent
stream, sometimes pruning the luxuriant
vine, and sometimes sitting in social converse with
her, in a shady grove of his own planting.</P>
<P>These, however, were no more than the
shadowy phantoms of imagination, which, he
well knew, would never be realized: not that
he believed such happiness unattainable by a per∣son
in his circumstances; but because he would
not stoop to propose a scheme, which might, in
any shape, seem to interfere with the interest of
Emilia, or subject himself to a repulse from that
young lady, who had rejected his addresses in the
zenith of his fortune.</P>
<P>While he diverted himself with these agreeable
reveries, an unexpected event intervened, in which
she and her brother were deeply interested. The
uncle was tapped for the dropsy, and died in a
few days after the operation; having bequeathed,
in his will, five thousand pounds to his nephew,
<PB N="281" REF="287"/>
and twice that sum to his niece, who had always
enjoyed the greatest share of his favour.</P>
<P>If our adventurer, before this occurrence,
looked upon his love for Emilia as a passion which
it was necessary, at any rate, to conquer or sup∣press;
he now considered her accession of for∣tune
as a circumstance which confirmed that ne∣cessity,
and resolved to discourage every thought
on that subject, which should tend to the propa∣gation
of hope: when one day, in the midst of a
conversation calculated for the purpose, Godfrey
put into his hand a letter directed to Mr. Pickle,
in the hand-writing of Emilia; which the youth
no sooner recognized, than his cheeks were co∣vered
with a crimson dye, and he began to
tremble with violent agitation: for he, at once,
guessed the import of the billet, which he kissed
with great reverence and devotion, and was not
at all surprised when he read the following words.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have performed a sufficient sacrifice to my
reputation, in retaining hitherto the appear∣ance
of that resentment, which I had long ago
dismissed; and as the late favourable change in
my situation, impowers me to avow my genuine
sentiments, without fear of censure, or suspicion
of mercenary design, I take this opportunity to
assure you, that if I still maintain that place in
your heart, which I was vain enough to think I
once possessed, I am willing to make the first ad∣vances
to an accommodation; and have actually
furnished my brother with full powers to conclude
it, in the name of your appea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Emilia.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="282" REF="288"/>
Pickle, having kissed the subscription with great
ardour, fell upon his knees, and lifting up his
eyes, “Thank heaven! (cried he, with an air
of transport) I have not been mistaken in my
opinion of that generous maid. I believed her
inspired with the most dignified and heroic senti∣ments,
and now she gives me a convincing proof
of her magnanimity: it is now my business to
approve myself worthy of her regard. May
heaven inflict upon me the keenest arrows of its
vengeance, if I do not, at this instant, contem∣plate
the character of Emilia with the most per∣fect
love and adoration; yet, amiable and in∣chanting
as she is, I am, more than ever, deter∣mined
to sacrifice the interest of my passion to
my glory, tho' my life should fail in the contest;
and even to refuse an offer, which, otherwise,
the whole universe should not bribe me to
forego.”</P>
<P>This declaration was not so unexpected as un∣welcome
to his friend Gauntlet, who represented
that his glory was not at all interested in the
affair; because he had already vindicated his ge∣nerosity,
in repeated proffers to lay his whole
fortune at Emilia's feet, when it was impossible
that any thing selfish could enter into the propo∣sal:
but that, in rejecting her present purpose,
he would give the world an opportunity to say
that his pride was capricious, his obstinacy invin∣cible,
and his sister undeniable reason to believe,
that either his passion for her was dissembled, or
the ardour of it considerably abated.</P>
<P>In answer to these remonstrances, Pickle ob∣served,
that he had long set the world at de∣fiance;
and as to the opinion of Emilia, he did
not doubt that she would applaud, in her heart,
<PB N="283" REF="289"/>
the resolution he had taken, and do justice to the
purity of his intention.</P>
<P>It was not an easy task to divert our hero from
his designs, at any time of life; but, since his
confinement, his inflexibility was become almost
insurmountable. The captain, therefore, after
having discharged his conscience, in assuring him
that his sister's happiness was at stake, that his
mother had approved of the step she had taken,
and that he himself should be extremely mortified
at his refusal, forbore to press him with further
argument, which served only to rivet him the
more strongly in his own opinion; and undertook
to deliver this answer to Emilia's letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT I revere the dignity of your virtue
with the utmost veneration, and love you
infinitely more than life, I am at all times ready

my destiny, that, in order to justify your gene∣rosity,
I must refuse to profit by your condescen∣sion.
Madam, I am doomed to be for ever
wretched; and to sigh, without ceasing, for the
possession of that jewel, which, tho' now in my
offer, I dare not enjoy. I shall not pretend to

Emilia, who knew the nicety of our hero's
pride, had foreseen the purport of this epistle,
before it came to her hands: she did not, there∣fore,
despair of success, nor desist from the pro∣secution
of her plan; which was no other than
that of securing her own happiness, in espousing
the man upon whom she had fixed her unalter∣able
affection. Confident of his honour, and
fully satisfied of the mutual passion with which
they were inspired, she gradually decoyed him
into a literary correspondence, wherein she at∣tempted
to refute the arguments on which he
grounded his refusal; and, without doubt, the
young gentleman was not a little pleased with
the enjoyment of such delightful commerce, in
the course of which he had (more than ever) an
opportunity of admiring the poignancy of her
wit, and the elegance of her understanding.</P>
<P>The contemplation of such excellency, while
it strengthened the chains with which she held
him enslaved, added emulation to the other mo∣tives
that induced him to maintain the dispute;
and much subtlety of reasoning was expended
upon both sides of this very particular question,
without any prospect of conviction on either
part: 'till, at last, she began to despair of making
him a proselyte to her opinion by dint of argu∣ment;
and resolved, for the future, to apply her∣self
chiefly to the irresistible prepossessions of his
love, which were not at all diminished or im∣paired
by the essays of her pen. With this view
she proposed a conference, pretending that it was
impossible to convey all her reflections, upon this
subject, in a series of short letters; and Godfrey
undertook to bail him for the day: but, conscious
of her power, he would not trust himself in her
<PB N="285" REF="291"/>
presence, tho' his heart throbbed with all the
eagerness of desire to see her fair eyes disrobed
of that resentment which they had wore so long,
and to enjoy the ravishing sweets of a fond re∣conciliation.</P>
<P>Nature could not have held out against such
powerful attacks, had not the pride and caprice
of his disposition been gratified to the full in the
triumph of his resistance: he looked upon the
contest as altogether original, and persevered
with obstinacy, because he thought himself sure
of favourable terms, whenever he should be dis∣posed
to capitulate. Perhaps he might have over∣shot
himself, in the course of his perseverance:
a young lady of Emilia's fortune and attractions,
could not fail to find herself surrounded by temp∣tations,
which few women can resist. She might
have misinterpreted the meaning of some para∣graph,
or taken umbrage at an unguarded ex∣pression
in one of Peregrine's letters: she might
have been tired out by his obstinate peculiarity,
or, at the long run, construed it into madness,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light, or indifference; or, rather than waste her
prime in fruitless endeavours to subdue the pride
of an headstrong humorist, listen to the voice of
some admirer, fraught with qualifications suffi∣cient
to engage her esteem and affection. But
all these possibilities were providentially prevented
by an accident, attended with more important
consequences than any we have hitherto re∣counted.</P>
<P>Early one morning, Pipes was disturbed by
the arrival of a messenger, who had been sent
express from the country by Mr. Clover, with a
packet for the lieutenant, and arrived in town
overnight; but as he was obliged to have re∣course
<PB N="286" REF="292"/>
to the information of Jack's correspondent
in the city, touching the place of his abode, be∣fore
he demanded entrance at the Fleet, the gate
was shut; nor would the turnkeys admit him,
al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o' he told them, that he was charged with a
message of the utmost consequence; so that he
was fain to tarry' till day-break, when he, at his
earnest solicitation, was allowed to enter.</P>
<P>Hatchway, opening the packet, found a letter
inclosed for Peregrine, with an earnest request,
that he would forward it to the hands of that
young gentleman with all possible dispatch. Jack,
who could not dive into the meaning of this ex∣traordinary
injunction, began to imagine that
Mrs. Clover lay at the point of death, and
wanted to take her last farewel of her brother;
and this conceit worked so strongly upon his
imagination, that, while he huddled on his
cloaths, and made the best of his way to the
apartment of our hero, he could not help cursing,
within himself, the folly of the husband in send∣ing
such disagreeable messages to a man of Pere∣grine's
impatient temper, already soured by his
own uneasy situation.</P>
<P>This reflection would have induced him to
suppress the letter, had not he been afraid to
tamper with the ticklish disposition of his friend,
to whom, while he delivered it, “As for my
own part, (said he) mayhap I may have as much
natural affection as another; but, when my spouse
parted, I bore my misfortune like a British man
and a Christian: for, why? he's no better than
a fresh-water sailor, who knows not how to stem
the current of mischance.”</P>
<P>Pickle being waked from a pleasant dream,
in which the fair Emilia was principally con∣cerned,
<PB N="287" REF="293"/>
and, hearing this strange preamble, sat
up in his bed, and unsealed the letter, in a state
of mortification and disgust: but what were the
emotions of his soul, when he read the following
intimation!</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Dear brother,</OPENER>
<P>IT hath pleased God to take your father sud∣denly
off, by a fit of the apoplexy; and as he
has died intestate, I give you this notice, that
you may, with all speed, come down and take
possession of your right, in despite of master Gam
and his mother, who, you may be sure, do not
sit easy under this unexpected dispensation of pro∣vidence.
I have, by virtue of being a justice of
the peace, taken such precautions as I thought
necessary for your advantage; and the funeral
shall be deferred until your pleasure be known.
Your sister, tho' sincerely afflicted with her fa∣ther's
fate, submits to the will of heaven with
laudable resignation, and begs you will set out
for this place without delay; in which request
she is joined by, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER>Your affectionate brother, and
Humble servant,
<SIGNED>Charles Clover.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Peregrine, at first, looked upon this epistle as
a meer illusion of the brain, and a continuation
of the reverie in which he had been engaged. He
read it ten times over, without being persuaded
that he was actually awake: he rubbed his eyes,
and shook his head, in order to shake off the
drowsy vapours that surrounded him: he hemm'd
thrice with great vo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iferation, snapp'd his fingers,
<PB N="288" REF="294"/>
tweak'd his nose, started up from his bed, and,
opening the casement, took a survey of the well-known
objects that appeared on each side of his
habitation. Every thing seemed congr'ous and
connected, and he said, within himself, “Sure
this is the most distinct dream that ever sleep
produced. Then he had recourse again to the
paper, which he carefully perused, without find∣ing
any variation from his first notion of the
contents.</P>
<P>Hatchway, seeing all this extravagance of ac∣tion,
accompanied with a wild stare of distrac∣tion,
began to believe that his head was at length
fairly turned, and was really meditating means
for securing his person; when Pickle, in a tone
of surprize, exclaimed, “Good God! am I,
or am I not awake?” “Why, look ye, cousin
Pickle, (replied the lieutenant) that is a question
which the deep sea-line of my understanding is
not long enough to sound: but, howsomever,
tho'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I can't trust to the observation I have taken,
it shall go hard but I will fall upon a way to guess
whereabouts we are.” So saying, he lifted up a
pitcher full of cold water, that stood behind the
outward door, and discharged it in the face of
Peregrine, without ceremony or hesitation.</P>
<P>This remedy produced the desired effect: un∣palatable
as it was, the young gentleman no
sooner recovered his breath, which was endan∣gered
by such a sudden application, than he thank'd
his friend Jack for the seasonable operation he had
performed; and having no longer any just reason
to doubt the reality of what appealed so con∣vincingly
to his senses, he shifted himself on the
instant, not without hurry and trepidation; and
putting on his morning-dress, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allied forth to the
<PB N="289" REF="295"/>
bear, in order to deliberate with himself on the
important intelligence he had received.</P>
<P>Hatchway, not yet fully convinced of his sanity,
and curious to know the purport of the letter,
which had affected him in such an extraordinary
manner, carefully attended his footsteps in this
excursion, in hope of being favoured with his
confidence, in the course of their perambulation.
Our hero no sooner appeared at the street-door,
than he was saluted by the messenger, who
having posted himself in the way for that pur∣pose,
“God bless your noble honour, squire
Pickle, (cried he) and give you joy of succeed∣ing
to your father's estate.” These words had
scarce proceeded from his mouth, when the lieu∣tenant
hopping eagerly towards the countryman,
squeezed his hand with great affection, and asked
if the old gentleman had actually taken his de∣parture:
“Ay, master Hatchway, (replied the
other) in such a woundy haste, that he forgot to
make a will.” “Body of me! (exclaimed the
seaman) these are the best tidings I have heard
since I first went to sea. Here, my lad, take my
purse, and stow thyself chocque-full of the best
liquor in the land.” So saying, he tipped the
peasant with ten pieces, and immediately the
whole place ecchoed with the sound of Tom's
instrument; while Peregrine, repairing to the
walk, communicated the billet to his honest
friend, who, at his desire, went forthwith to the
lodgings of captain Gauntlet, and returned in
less than half an hour with that gentleman, who
(I need not say) was heartily rejoiced at the oc∣casion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine holds a consultation with his friends, in
consequence of which he bids adieu to the Fleet.
He arrives at his father's house, and asserts his
right of inheritance.</HEAD>
<P>NOR did our hero keep the misanthrope in
ignorance of this happy turn of fortune:
Pipes was dispatched to the senior, with a mes∣sage
requesting his immediate presence; and he
accordingly appeared, in obedience to the sum∣mons,
growling with discontent, for having been
deprived of several hours of his natural rest. His
mouth was immediately stopped with the letter, at
which he <HI>smiled horrible a ghastly grin;</HI> and, after
a compliment of congratulation, they entered in∣to
close divan, about the measures to be taken in
consequence of this event.</P>
<P>There was no room for much debate: it was
unanimously agreed, that Pickle should set out,
with all possible dispatch, for the garison, to
which Gauntlet and Hatchway resolved to at∣tend
him; and Pipes was accordingly ordered to
prepare a couple of post-chaises, while Godfrey
went to procure bail for his friend, and provide
them with money for the expence of the expedi∣tion,
but not before he was desired by Peregrine
to conceal this piece of news from his sister, that
our youth might have an opportunity to surprise
her in a more interesting manner, after he
should have settled his affairs.</P>
<P>All these previous steps being taken in less than
an hour, our hero took his leave of the Fleet,
after he had left twenty guineas with the warden
<PB N="291" REF="297"/>
for the relief of the poor prisoners, a great num∣ber
of whom conveyed him to the gate, pouring
forth prayers for his long life and prosperity; and
he took the road to the garison, in the most ele∣vated
transports of joy, unallayed with the least
mixture of grief at the death of a parent whose
paternal tenderness he had never known; so that
his breast was absolutely a stranger to that boast∣ed
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or instinct of affection, by which the
charities are supposed to subsist.</P>
<P>Of all the journeys he had ever made, this,
sure, was the most delightful: he felt all the ex∣tasy
that must naturally be produced in a young
man of his imagination, from such a sudden tran∣sition,
in point of circumstance; he found him∣self
delivered from confinement and disgrace,
without being obliged to any person upon earth
for his deliverance; he had it now in his power
to retort the contempt of the world, in a man∣ner
suited to his most sanguine wish; he was re∣conciled
to his friend, and enabled to gratify his
love, even upon his own terms; and saw himself
in possession of a fortune more ample than his first
inheritance, with a stock of experience that
would steer him clear of all those quicksands
among which he had been formerly wrecked.</P>
<P>In the middle of their journey, while they
halted at an inn for a short refreshment and
change of horses, a postilion ran up to Peregrine
in the yard, and falling at his feet, clasped his
knees with great eagerness and agitation, and pre∣sented
to him the individual face of his old valet
de chambre. The youth perceiving him in such
an abject garb and attitude, commanded him to
rise, and tell the cause of such a miserable reverse
in his fortune. Upon which H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dgi gave him to
<PB N="292" REF="298"/>
understand, that he had been ruined by his wife,
who having robbed him of all his cash and valu∣able
effects, had eloped from his house, with
one of his own customers, who appeared in the
character of a French count, but was in reality
no other than an Italian fidler; that, in conse∣quence
of this retreat, he (the husband) was dis∣abled
from paying a considerable sum which he
had set apart for his wine-merchant, who being
disappointed in his expectation, took out an ex∣tent
against his effects; and the rest of his cre∣ditors
following his example, hunted him out of
house and home: so that, finding his person in
danger at London, he had been obliged to escape
into the country, skulking about from one vil∣lage
to another, till being quite destitute of all
support, he had undertaken his present office, to
save himself from starving.</P>
<P>Peregrine listened with compassion to his la∣mentable
tale, which too well accounted for his
not appearing in the Fleet, with offers of service
to his master in distress, a circumstance that
Pickle had all along imputed to his avarice and
ingratitude; and he assured him, that as he had
been the means of throwing in his way the temp∣tation
to which he fell a sacrifice, he would charge
himself with the retrieval of his affairs: in the
mean time, he made him taste of his bounty, and
desired him to continue in his present employ∣ment,
until he should return from the garison,
when he would consider his situation, and do
something for his immediate relief.</P>
<P>Hadgi attempted to kiss his shoe, and wept, or
affected to weep, with sensibility, at this gracious
reception; he even made a merit of his unwil∣lingness
to exercise his new occupation, and ear∣nestly
<PB N="293" REF="299"/>
begged that he might be allowed to give
immediate attendance upon his dear master, from
whom he could not bear the thoughts of a second
parting. His intreaties were reinforced by the
intercession of his two friends, in consequence of
which the Swiss was permitted to follow them at
his own leisure, while they set forwards, after a
slight repast, and reached the place of their de∣stination
before ten o' clock at night.</P>
<P>Peregrine, instead of alighting at the garison,
rode straightway to his father's house; and no
person appearing to receive him, not even a ser∣vant
to take care of his chai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, he dismounted
without assistance, and being followed by his
two friends, advanced into the hall, where per∣ceiving
a bell-rope, he made immediate applica∣tion
to it, in such a manner as brought a couple
of footmen into his presence. After having repri∣manded
them, with a stern look, for their ne∣glect,
in point of attendance, he commanded
them to shew him into an apartment; and, as
they seemed unwilling to yield obedience to his
orders, asked if they did not belong to the fa∣mily?</P>
<P>One of them, who took upon himself the of∣fice
of spokesman, replied with a sullen air, that
they had been in the service of old Mr. Pickle,
and now that he was dead, thought themselves
bound to obey no body but their lady, and her son
Mr. Gamaliel. This declaration had scarce pro∣ceeded
from his mouth, when our hero gave them
to understand, that since they were not disposed
to own any other master, they must change their
quarters immediately; and ordered them to de∣camp
without further preparation: and as they
still continued restiff, they were kicked out of
<PB N="294" REF="300"/>
doors by the captain and his friend Hatchway.
Squire Gam, who overheard every thing that
passed, and was now more than ever inflamed
with that rancour which he had sucked with his
mother's milk, flew to the assistance of his ad∣herents,
with a pistol in each hand, bellowing
<HI>Thieves! thieves!</HI> with great vociferation, as if
he had mistaken the business of the strangers, and
actually believed himself in danger of being
robbed. Under this pretence he discharged a
piece at his brother, who luckily escaping the
shot, closed with him in a moment, and wrest∣ing
the other pistol from his gripe, turned him
out into the court-yard, to the consolation of his
two dependants.</P>
<P>By this time, Pipes and the two postilions had
taken possession of the stables, without being op∣posed
by the coachman and his deputy, who
quietly submitted to the authority of their new
sovereign; but the noise of the pistol had alarm∣ed
Mrs. Pickle, who running down stairs, with
the most frantic appearance, attended by two
maids and the curate, who still maintained his
place of chaplain and ghostly director in the fa∣mily,
would have assaulted our hero with her
nails, had not she been restrained by her attend∣ants,
who, tho' they prevented her from using
her hands, could not hinder her from exercising
her tongue, which she wagged against him with
all the virulence of malice. She ask'd, if he
was come to butcher his brother, to insult his fa∣ther's
corpse, and triumph in her affliction; she
bestowed upon him the epithets of spendthrift,
jailbird, and unnatural ruffian; she begg'd par∣don
of God for having brought such a monster
into the world, accused him of having brought
<PB N="295" REF="301"/>
his father's grey hairs with sorrow to the grave;
and affirmed, that were he to touch the body, it
would bleed at his approach.</P>
<P>Without pretending to refute the articles of
this ridiculous charge, he allowed her to ring out
her alarm; and then calmly replied, that if she
did not quietly retire to her chamber, and behave
as became a person in her present situation, he
should insist upon her removing to another lodg∣ing,
without delay; for he was determined to be
master in his own family. The lady, who, in
all probability, expected that he would endea∣vour
to appease her with all the tenderness of filial
submission, was so much exasperated at his ca∣valier
behaviour, that her constitution could not
support the transports of her spirits; and she was
carried off by her women, in a fit, while the
officious clergyman was dismiss'd after his pupil,
with all the circumstances of disgrace.</P>
<P>Our hero having thus made his quarters good,
took possession of the best apartment in the house,
and sent notice of his arrival to Mr. Clover, who,
with his wife, visited him in less than an hour,
and was not a little surprised to find him so sud∣denly
settled in his father's house. The meeting
of Julia and her brother was extremely pathetic.
She had always loved him with uncommon
tenderness, and looked upon him as the orna∣ment
of her family; but she had heard of his ex∣travagancies
with regret, and tho' she considered
the stories that were circulated at his expence, as
the malicious exaggerations of his mother and her
darling son, her apprehension had been grievously
alarmed by an account of his imprisonment and
distress, which had been accidentally conveyed
to that country by a gentleman from London,
<PB N="296" REF="302"/>
who had been formerly of his acquaintance: she
could not, therefore, without the most tender
emotions of joy, see him, as it were, restored to his
rightful inheritance, and re-established in that
station of life which she thought he could fill with
dignity and importance.</P>
<P>After their mutual expressions of affection, she
retired to her mother's chamber, with a view to
make a second offer of her service and attend∣ance,
which had been already rejected with scorn
since her father's death; while Peregrine con∣sulted
his brother-in-law, about the affairs of the
family, so far as they had fallen within his cog∣nizance
and observation.</P>
<P>Mr. Clover told him, that though he was
never favoured with the confidence of the de∣funct,
he knew some of his intimates, who had
been tampered with by Mrs. Pickle, and even
engaged to second the remonstrances by which
she had often endeavoured to persuade her hus∣band
to settle his affairs by a formal will; but
that he had from time to time evaded their im∣portunities
with surprising excuses of procrastina∣tion,
that plainly appeared to be the result of in∣vention
and design, far above the supposed pitch
of his capacity; a circumstance from which Mr.
Clover concluded, that the old gentleman ima∣gined
his life would not have been secure, had
he once taken such a step as must have rendered it
unnecessary to the independence of his second son.
He moreover observed, that, in consequence of
this information, he no sooner heard of Mr.
Pickle's death, which happened at the club, than
he went directly, with a lawyer, to his house,
before any cab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l or conspiracy could be formed
against the rightful heir; and, in presence of
<PB N="297" REF="303"/>
witnesses provided for the purpose, sealed up all
the papers of the deceased, after the widow had,
in the first transports of her sorrow and vexation,
fairly owned, that her husband had died in∣testate.</P>
<P>Pereg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine was extremely well satisfied with
this intelligence, by which all his doubts were
dispelled, and having chearfully supped with his
friends on a cold collation which his brother-in-law
had brought in his chariot, they retired to
rest, in different chambers, after Julia had met
with another repulse from her capricious mother,
whose overflowing rage had now subsided into the
former channel of calm inveteracy.</P>
<P>Next morning the house was supplied with
some servants from the garison, and preparations
made for the funeral of the deceased; and Gam
having taken lodgings in the neighbourhood,
came with a chaise and cart to demand his mo∣ther,
together with his own cloaths, and her per∣sonal
effects.</P>
<P>Our hero, tho' he would not suffer him to en∣ter
the door, allowed his proposal to be commu∣nicated
to the widow, who eagerly embraced the
opportunity of removing, and was, with her own
baggage, and that of her beloved son, conveyed
to the place which he had prepared for her re∣ception;
whither she was followed by her wo∣man,
who was desired by Peregrine to assure her
mistress, that, until a regular provision could be
settled upon her, she might command him, in
point of money, or any other accommodation in
his power.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He performs the last offices to his father, and returns
to London, upon a very interesting design.</HEAD>
<P>SUITS of mourning being provided for him∣self,
his friends and adherents, and every
other previous measure taken, suitable to the oc∣casion,
his father was interred, in a private man∣ner,
in the parish-church; and his papers being
examined, in presence of many persons of ho∣nour
and integrity, invited for that purpose, no
will was found, or any other deed, in favour of
the second son, tho' it appeared by the marriage
settlement, that the widow was intitled to a join∣ture
of five hundred pounds a year. The rest
of his papers consisted of East-India bonds,
South-sea annuities, mortgages, notes and as∣signments,
to the amount of fourscore thousand
seven hundred and sixty pounds, exclusive of the
house, plate and furniture, horses, equipage and
cattle, with the garden and park adjacent, to a
very considerable extent.</P>
<P>This was a sum that even exceeded his ex∣pectation,
and could not fail to entertain his
fancy with the most agreeable ideas. He found
himself immediately a man of vast consequence
among his country neighbours, who visited him
with compliments of congratulation, and treated
him with such respect as would have effectually
spoiled any young man of his disposition, who
had not the same advantages of experience as he
had already purchased at a very extravagant
price. Thus shielded with caution, he bore his
prosperity with surprising temperance; every
<PB N="299" REF="305"/>
body was charmed with his affability and mode∣ration;
and when he made a circuit round the
gentlemen of the district, in order to repay the
courtesy which he owed, he was caressed by
them with uncommon assiduity, and advised to
offer himself as a candidate for the county, at the
next election, which, they supposed, would soon
happen, because the present member was in a
declining state of health. Nor did his person
and address escape unheeded by the ladies, many
of whom did not scruple to spread their attrac∣tions
before him, with a view of captivating such
a valuable prize: nay, such an impression did
this legacy make upon a certain peer, who re∣sided
in this part of the country, that he culti∣vated
Pickle's acquaintance with great eagerness,
and, without circumlocution, offered to him in
marriage his only daughter, with a very con∣siderable
fortune.</P>
<P>Our hero expressed himself, upon this occa∣sion,
as became a man of honour, sensibility and
politeness; and frankly gave his lordship to un∣derstand,
that his heart was already engaged.
He was pleased with the opportunity of making
such a sacrifice to his passion for Emilia, which,
by this time, inflamed his thoughts to such a de∣gree
of impatience, that he resolved to depart for
London, with all possible speed; and for that
purpose industriously employed almost every hour
of his time in regulating his domestic affairs. He
paid off all his father's servants, and hired others,
at the recommendation of his sister, who pro∣mised
to superintend his houshold in his absence:
he advanced the first half-yearly payment of his
mother's jointure; and as for his brother Gam,
he gave him divers opportunities of acknowledg∣ing
<PB N="300" REF="306"/>
his faults, so as that he might have answered
to his own conscience for taking any step in his
favour; but that young gentleman was not yet
sufficiently humbled by misfortune, and not only
forbore to make any overtures of peace, but also
took all occasions to slander the conduct and re∣vile
the person of our hero, being, in this prac∣tice,
comforted and abetted by his righteous
mamma.</P>
<P>Every thing being thus settled for the present,
the triumvirate set out on their return to town, in
the fame manner with that in which they had ar∣rived
in the country, except in this small varia∣tion,
that Hatchway's chaise-companion was
now the valet de chambre refitted, instead of
Pipes, who, with another lacquey, attended
them on horseback. When they had performed
two thirds of their way to London, they chanced
to overtake a country squire, on his return from
a visit to one of his neighbours, who had enter∣tained
him with such hospitality, that (as the lieu∣tenant
observed) he rolled himself almost gun∣wale
to, at every motion of his horse, which
was a fine hunter; and when the chaises pass'd
him at full speed, he set up the sportsman's hol∣low,
in a voice that founded like a French horn,
clapping spurs to Sorrel at the same time, in order
to keep up with the pace of the machine.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was animated with an uncom∣mon
flow of spirits, ordered his postilion to pro∣ceed
more softly; and entered into conversation
with the stranger, touching the make and mettle
of his horse, upon which he descanted with so
much learning, that the squire was astonished at
his knowledge, and so engaged with his manner
of discourse, that, when they approached his
<PB N="301" REF="307"/>
habitation, he invited the young gentleman and
his company to halt, and drink a bottle of his
ale; and was so pressing in his solicitation, that
they complied with his request. He accordingly
conducted them through a spacious avenue, that
extended as far as the highway, to the gate of a
large <HI>chateau,</HI> of a most noble and venerable ap∣pearance,
which induced them to alight and
view the apartments, contrary to their first inten∣tion
of drinking a glass of his October at the
door.</P>
<P>The rooms were every way suitable to the
magnificence of the outside, and our hero ima∣gined
they had made a tour through the whole
sweep, when the landlord gave him to under∣stand
that they had not yet seen the best apart∣ment
of the house, and immediately led them
into a spacious dining-room, which Peregrine
did not enter without giving manifest signs of un∣common
astonishment. The pannels all round
were covered with portraits, at full length, by
Vandyke; and not one of them appeared with∣out
a ridiculous tye-perriwig, in the style of those
that usually hang over the shops of two-penny
barbers. The strait boots in which the figures
had been originally painted, and the other cir∣cumstances
of attitude and drapery, so incon∣sistent
with this monstrous furniture of the head,
exhibited such a ludicrous appearance, that Pickle's
wonder, in a little time, gave way to his mirth,
and he was seized with a violent fit of laughter,
which had well nigh deprived him of his breath.</P>
<P>The squire, half pleased and half offended at
this expression of ridicule, “I know (said he)
what makes you laugh so woefully: you think it
strange to zee my yorefathers booted and spurred,
<PB N="302" REF="308"/>
with huge three tailed perriwigs on their pates.
The truth of the matter is this: I could not
abide to zee the pictures of my vamily, with a
parcel of loose hair hanging about their eyes,
like zo many colts; and zo I employed a painter
vellow from Lundon to clap decent perriwigs
upon their skulls, at the rate of vive shillings a
head, and offered him three shillings a-piece to
furnish each with an handzome pair of shoes and
stockings: but the rascal, thinking I must have
'em done at any price, after their heads were
covered, haggled with me for your shillings a
picture; and zo, rather than be imposed upon,
I turned him off, and shall let 'em stand as they
are, 'till zome more reasonable brother of the
brush comes round the country.”</P>
<P>Pickle commended his resolution, tho', in his
heart, he blessed himself from such a barbarous
Goth; and, after they had dispatched two or
three bottles of his beer, they proceeded on their
journey, and arrived in town about eleven at
night.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. the Last.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He enjoys an interview with Emilia, and makes
himself ample amends for all the mortifications
of his life.</HEAD>
<P>GODFREY, who had taken leave of his
sister, on pretence of making a short ex∣cursion
with Peregrine, whose health required the
enjoyment of fresh air, after his long confine∣ment,
sent a message to her, that same night,
announcing his arrival, and giving her notice
that he would breakfast with her next morning;
<PB N="303" REF="309"/>
when he and our hero, who had dressed himself
for the purpose, taking a hackney-coach, repaired
to her lodging, and were introduced into a par∣lour,
adjoining to that in which the tea-table was
set. Here they had not waited many minutes
when they heard the sound of feet, coming down
stairs; upon which our hero's heart began to
beat the alarm, and he concealed himself behind
the screen, by the direction of his friend, whose
ears being saluted with Sophy's voice from the
next room, he flew into it with great ardour,
and enjoyed upon her lips the sweet transports of
a meeting so unexpected; for he had left her in
her father's house at Windsor.</P>
<P>Amidst these emotions, he had almost forgot
the situation of Peregrine; when Emilia, as∣suming
an enchanting air, “Is not this (said
she) a most provoking scene to a young woman
like me, who am doomed to wear the willow,
by the strange caprice of my lover? Upon my
word, brother, you have done me infinite pre∣judice,
in promoting this jaunt with my obsti∣nate
correspondent; who, I suppose, is so ra∣vished
with this transient glimpse of liberty, that
he will never be persuaded to incur unnecessary
confinement for the future.” “My dear sister,
(replied the captain, tauntingly) your own pride
set him the example; so you must e'en stand to
the consequence of his imitation.” “'Tis a
hard case, however, (answered the fair offender)
that I should suffer all my life, by one venial
trespass. Heigh ho! who would imagine that a
sprightly girl, such as I, with ten thousand pounds,
should go a begging? I have a good mind to
marry the next person that asks me the question,
in order to be revenged upon this unyielding
<PB N="304" REF="310"/>
humourist. Did the dear fellow discover no in∣clination
to see me, in all the term of his release∣ment?
Well, if ever I can catch the fugitive
again, he shall sing in his cage for life.”</P>
<P>It is impossible to convey to the reader a just
idea of Peregrine's transports, while he over∣heard
this declaration; which was no sooner pro∣nounced,
than, unable to resist the impetuosity
of his passion, he sprung from his lurking place,
exclaiming, “Here I surrender;” and rushing
into her presence, was so dazzled with her beau∣ty,
that his speech failed: he was fixed, like a
statue, to the floor; and all his faculties were
absorpt in admiration. Indeed, she was now in
the full bloom of her charms, and it was nearly
impossible to look upon her without emotion.
What then must have been the extasy of our
youth, whose passion was whetted with all the
incitements which could stimulate the human
heart! The ladies screamed with surprize at his
appearance, and Emilia underwent such agitation
as flushed every charm with irresistible energy:
her cheeks glowed with a most delicate suffusion,
and her bosom heaved with such bewitching un∣dulation,
that the cambrick could not conceal
or contain the snowy hemispheres, that rose like
a vision of paradise to his view.</P>
<P>While he was almost fainting with unutterable
delight, she seemed ready to sink under the tu∣mults
of tenderness and confusion; when our
hero, perceiving her condition, obeyed the im∣pulse
of his love, and circled the charmer in his
arms, without suffering the least frown or symp∣tom
of displeasure. Not all the pleasures of his
life, had amounted to the ineffable joy of this
embrace, in which he continued for some mi∣nutes
<PB N="305" REF="311"/>
totally entranced. He fastened upon her
pouting lips, with all the eagerness of rapture;
and, while his brain seemed to whirl round with
transport, exclaimed in a delirium of bliss,
“Heaven and earth! this is too much to bear!”</P>
<P>His imagination was accordingly relieved, and
his attention in some measure divided, by the in∣terposition
of Sophy, who kindly chid him for
his having overlooked his old friends: thus ac∣costed,
he quitted his delicious armful, and, sa∣luting
Mrs. Gauntlet, asked pardon for his ne∣glect;
observing, that such rudeness was excuse∣able,
considering the long and unhappy exile
which he had suffered, from the jewel of his
soul. Then turning to Emilia, “I am come,
madam, (said he) to claim the performance of
your promise, which I can produce under your
own fair hand: you may, therefore, lay aside all
superfluous ceremony and shyness, and crown
my happiness without farther delay; for, upon
my soul! my thoughts are wound up to the last
pitch of expectation, and I shall certainly run
distracted, if I am doomed to any term of pro∣bation.”</P>
<P>His mistress, having by this time recollected
herself, replied with a most exhilerating smile,
“I ought to punish you, for your obstinacy, with
the mortification of a twelve-month's trial; but
'tis dangerous to tamper with an admirer of your
disposition, and therefore, I think▪ I must make
sure of you while it is in my power.” “You
are willing, then, to take me for better for worse,
in presence of heaven and these witnesses?” cried
Peregrine, kneeling, and applying her hand to
his lips. At this interrogation, her features
softened into an amazing expression of conde∣scending
<PB N="306" REF="312"/>
love; and while she darted a side-glance,
that thrilled to his marrow, and heaved a sigh
more soft than zephyr's balmy wing, her answer
was, “Why—ay—and heaven grant me pa∣tience
to bear the humours of such a yoke-fellow.”
“And may the same powers (replied
the youth) grant me life and opportunity to ma∣nifest
the immensity of my love. Mean while,
I have eighty thousand pounds, which shall be laid
immediately in your lap.”</P>
<P>So saying, he sealed the contract upon her lips,
and explained the mystery of his last words,
which had begun to operate upon the wonder
of the two sisters. Sophy was agreeably surprised
with the account of his good fortune: nor was
it, in all probability, unacceptable to the lovely
Emilia; tho', from this information, she took an
opportunity to upbraid her admirer with the in∣flexibility
of his pride, which (she scrupled not
to say) would have baffled all the suggestions of
his passion, had not it been gratified by this pro∣vidential
event.</P>
<P>Matters being thus happily matured, the lover
begged that immediate recourse might be had to
the church, and his happiness ascertained before
night. But the bride objected, with great vehe∣mence,
to such precipitation, being desirous of
her mother's presence at the ceremony; and she
was seconded in her opinion by her brother's
wife: upon which Peregrine, maddening with
desire, assaulted her with the most earnest in∣treaties,
representing, that, as her mother's con∣sent
was already obtained, there was surely no
necessity for a delay, that must infallibly make
a dangerous impression upon his brain and con∣stitution.
He fell at her feet, in all the agony of
<PB N="307" REF="313"/>
impatience; swore that his life and intellects
would actually be in jeopardy by her refusal; and
when she attempted to argue him out of his de∣mand,
began to rave with such extravagance,
that Sophy was frightened into conviction: and
Godfrey enforcing the remonstrances of his friend,
the amiable Emilia was teized into compliance.</P>
<P>After breakfast the bridegroom and his com∣panion
set out for the Commons for a l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cence,
having first agreed upon the house at which the
ceremony should be performed, in the lodgings
of the bride: and the permission being obtained,
they found means to engage a clergyman, who
undertook to attend them at their own time and
place. Then a ring was purchased for the occa∣sion;
and they went in search of the lieutenant,
with whom they dined at a tavern, and not only
made him acquainted with the steps they had
taken, but desired that he would stand god-father
to the bride: an employment which Jack accepted
with demonstrations of particular satisfaction;
'till chancing to look into the street, and seeing
Cadwallader approach the door, in consequence
of a message they had sent to him by Pipes, he
declined the office in favour of the senior; who
was accordingly ordained for that purpose, on the
supposition that such a mark of regard might faci∣litate
his concurrence with a match, which,
otherwise, he would certainly oppose, as he was
a professed enemy to wedlock, and, as yet, igno∣rant
of Peregrine's intention.</P>
<P>After having congratulated Pickle upon his
succession, and shook his two friends by the
hand, the misanthrope asked whose mare was
dead, that he was summoned in such a plaguy
hurry from his dinner, which he had been fain
<PB N="308" REF="314"/>
to gobble up like a cannibal. Our hero gave him
to understand, that they had made an appointment
to drink tea with two agreeable ladies, and were
unwilling that he should lose the opportunity of
enjoying an entertainment which he loved so
much. Crabtree, shrivelling up his face, like an
autumn leaf, at this intimation, cursed his com∣plaisance,
and swore they should keep their assig∣nation
without him; for he and letchery had
shook hands many years ago.</P>
<P>The bridegroom, however, likening him unto
an old co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chman, who still delights in the smack
of the whip, and dropping some flattering hints
of his manhood, even at these years, he was gra∣dually
prevailed upon to accompany them to the
place of rendezvous; where, being ushered into
a dining-room, they had not waited three mi∣nutes
when they were joined by the parson, who
had observed the hour with great punctuality.</P>
<P>This gentleman no sooner entered the room,
than Cadwallader, in a whisper to Gauntlet,
asked if that was not the cock-bawd; and be∣fore
the captain could make any reply, “What
an uncons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ionable whore-master the rogue is!
(said he) scarce discharged from confinement,
and sweetened with a little fresh air, and yet he
we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches with a pimp in canonicals in his pay.”
The door again opened, and Emilia broke in
upon them, with such dignity of mien, and di∣vinity
of aspect, as inspired every spectator with
astonishment and admiration. The lieutenant,
who had not seen her since her charms were
ripened into such perfection, expressed his won∣der
and approbation in an exclamation of “Add's
zooks! what a glorious galley!” and the misan∣thrope's
visage was instantly metamorphosed into
<PB N="309" REF="315"/>
the face of a mountain-goat; he licked his lips
instinctively, snuffed the air, and squinted with
a most horrible obliquity of vision.</P>
<P>The bride and her sister being seated, and
Hatchway having renewed his acquaintance with
the former, who recognized him with particular
civility, Peregrine withdrew into another apart∣ment
with his friend Crabtree, to whom he im∣parted
the design of this meeting, which the lat∣ter
no sooner understood, than he attempted to
retreat, without making any other reply than
that of “Pshaw! rot your matrimony! can't
you put your neck in the noose, without my be∣ing
a witness of your solly?”</P>
<P>The young gentleman, in order to vanquish
this aversion, stepped to the door of the next
room, and begged the favour of speaking with
Emilia, to whom he introduced the testy old
batchelor, as one of his particular friends, who
desired to have the honour of giving her away.
The bewitching smile with which she received
his salute, and granted his request, at once over∣came
the disapprobra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>santhrope, who
with a relaxation in his countenance which had
never been perceived before that instant, thank∣ed
her in the most polite terms for such an agree∣able
mark of distinction. He accordingly led her
into the dining-room, where the ceremony was
performed without delay; and after the husband
had asserted his prerogative on her lips, the
whole company saluted her by the name of Mrs.
Pickle.</P>
<P>I shall leave the sensible reader to judge what
passed at this juncture, within the bosoms of the
new-married couple: Peregrine's heart was fired
with inexpressible ardour and impatience; while
<PB N="310" REF="316"/>
the transports of the bride were mingled with a
dash of diffidence and apprehension. Gauntl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
saw it would be too much for both, to bear their
present tantalizing situation till night, without
some amusement to diverge their thoughts; and
therefore proposed to pass part of the evening at
the public entertainment in Marybone-gardens,
which were at that time frequented by the best
company in town. The scheme was relished by
the discreet Sophy, who saw the meaning of the
proposal, and the bride submitted to the persua∣sion
of her sister; so that, after tea, two coaches
were called, and Peregrine was forcibly separated
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his charmer, during the conveyance.</P>
<P>While they stood before the orchestra, listen∣ing
to an English ballad, which was sung in a
very agreeable manner, our hero perceived a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>audry Frenchman leaning against a post, and en∣tertaining
himself with a soliloquy upon the bar∣barous
want of taste in England, so conspicuous
in the applause which was given to that miserable
performance; and as his remarks were not made
without some insolent reflections upon the na∣tion,
he marked him as a proper object for his ri∣dicule,
and began to project some scheme for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
him to the mirth of the company, because
he looked upon him as some pert valet de cham∣bre,
who assumed the character of a gentleman,
by the night; when he was saved the trouble of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>venting by an accident which the foreigner of
himself incurred.</P>
<P>One of the waiters belonging to the place, had
marked with chalk the score of a company whom
he attended, on the very post which the French∣man
had thought proper to occupy: so that,
when he walked away, he carried off the greatest
<PB N="311" REF="317"/>
part of the reckoning upon his bag and shoulders.
The servant coming to add another bottle to the
account, perceived almost the whole particulars
of the bill effaced, and began to raise an hideous
outcry against the people that stood nearest him:
upon which our hero told him how the misfor∣tune
had happened, and pointed out the person
who bore the impression upon his back. This
intelligence was no sooner communicated, than
the waiter, calling some of his brethren to his as∣sistance,
went in pursuit of the delinquent (while
Pickle desired his company to take notice) and
telling him, that he had carried off part of a rec∣koning,
desired he would return, that they might
compare the marks upon his bag with the frag∣ment
which remained upon the post.</P>
<P>The Frenchman, who did not understand one
word of the English language, seeing himself ac∣costed
in a very petulant manner by this attend∣ant,
at first imagined that he and his companions
came with a design to affront him, because he
was a foreigner; and therefore thinking it in∣cumbent
upon him to support the dignity of his
nation, began to talk very big in his native
tongue, and, in order to inforce his words, laid
his hand upon his sword, in a very menacing
posture: upon which the confederates flew upon
him, and securing both his arms, led him back∣ward
through a lane of people, who laughed
heartily at his captivity, which he now believed to
be the effect of an information laid against him,
for some trespass upon our laws, and, with a
most ludicrous expression of fear, protested, that
he was utterly ignorant and innocent of the
crime for which he was apprehended.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="318"/>
Being conducted to the spot, his back was ap∣plied
to the post, and the separate parts of the
score matched like two exchequer tallies; by
which means they were able to ascertain the rec∣koning,
and then dismiss'd the counterpart, who
had stood under their hands, with a most rueful
face of expectation, and afforded merriment to a
whole crowd of spectators, a great part of whom
gave him a convoy to the gate, by which he
made his retreat with great expedition.</P>
<P>The new-married couple and their company
having made shift to spend the evening, and
supped on a flight collation in one of the boxes,
Peregrine's patience was almost quite exhausted;
and taking Godfrey aside, he imparted his inten∣tion
to withdraw in private from the sea-wit of his
friend Hatchway, who would, otherwise, retard his
bliss, with unseasonable impediments, which, at
present, he could not possibly bear. Gauntlet,
who sympathized with his impatience, undertook
to intoxicate the lieutenant with bumpers to the
joy of the bride, and, in the mean time, desired
Sophy to retire with his sister, under the auspices
of Cadwallader, who promised to squire them
home.</P>
<P>The ladies were accordingly conducted to the
coach, and Jack proposed to the captain, that,
for the sake of the joke, the bridegroom should
be plied with liquor, in such a manner as would
effectually disable him from enjoying the fruits of
his good fortune for one night at least. Gauntlet
seemed to relish the scheme, and they prevailed
upon Pickle to accompany them to a certain ta∣vern,
on pretence of drinking a farewel glass to
a single life; there the bottle was circulated, till
Hatchway's brain began to suffer innovation, and
<PB N="313" REF="319"/>
as he had secured our hero's hat and sword, he
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt no apprehension of an elopement, which,
however, was effected; and the youth hastened
on the wings of love to the arms of his enchant∣ing
bride. He found Crabtree in a parlour, wait∣ing
for his return, and disposed to entertain him
with a lecture upon temperance; to which he paid
very little attention, but ringing for Emilia's
maid, desired to know if her mistress was a-bed.
Being answered in the affirmative, he sent her up
stairs to announce his arrival, undressed himself to
a loose gown and slippers, and wishing the mi∣santhrope
good-night, after having desired to soe
him next day, followed in person to the delicious
scene, where he found her elegantly dished out,
the fairest daughter of chastity and love.</P>
<P>When he approached, she was overwhelmed
with confusion, and hid her lovely face from his
transported view; while Mrs. Gauntlet, seeing his
eyes kindled at the occasion, kissed her charming
sister, who, throwing her snowy arms about her
neck, would have detained her in the room, had
not Peregrine gently disengaged her confidante
from her embrace, and conducted her trembling
to the door; which having bolted and barrica∣doed,
he profited by his good fortune, and his
felicity was perfect.</P>
<P>Next day he rose about noon, and found his
three friends assembled, when he learned that Jack
had fallen in his own snare, and been obliged to
lie in the same tavern where he fell: a circum∣stance
of which he was so much ashamed, that
Peregrine and his wife escaped many jokes, which
he would have certainly cracked, had he not lain
under the predicament of this disgrace. In half
an hour after he came down, Mrs. Pickle appear∣ed
<PB N="314" REF="320"/>
with Sophy, blushing like Aurora or the god∣dess
of health, and sending forth emanations of
beauty unparallelled: she was complimented upon
her change of situation by all present, and by
none more warmly than by old Crabtree, who de∣clared
himself so well satisfied with his friend's
fortune, as to be almost reconciled to that institu∣tion,
against which he had declaimed during the
best part of his life.</P>
<P>An express was immediately dispatched to Mrs.
Gauntlet, with an account of her daughter's mar∣riage;
a town-house was hired, and an handsome
equipage set up, in which the new-married pair
appeared at all public places, to the astonishment
of our adventurer's fair weather friends, and the
admiration of all the world: for, in point of fi∣gure,
such another couple was not to be found in
the whole united kingdom. Envy despaired, and
detraction was struck dumb, when our hero's new
accession of fortune was consigned to the celebra∣tion
of public fame: Emilia attracted the notice
of all observers, from the pert templar to the So∣vereign
himself, who was pleased to bestow enco∣miums
upon the excellence of her beauty. Many
persons of consequence, who had dropped the ac∣quaintance
of Peregrine, in the beginning of his
decline, now made open efforts to cultivate his
friendship anew: but he discouraged all these ad∣vances
with the most mortifying disdain; and one
day, when the nobleman, whom he had formerly
obliged, came up to him in the drawing-room,
with the salutation of “Your servant, Mr. Pickle”,
he eyed him with a look of ineffable contempt,
saying, “I suppose your lordship is mistaken in
your man,” and turned his head another way, in
presence of the whole court.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="321"/>
When he had made a circuit round all the
places frequented by the beau-monde, to the utter
confusion of those against whom his resentment
was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ paid off his debts, and settled his
money-matters in town: Hatchway was dismissed
to the country, in order to prepare for the recep∣tion
of his fair Emilia; and in a few days after
his departure, the whole company (Cadwallader
himself included) set out for his father's house,
and, in their way, took up Mrs. Gauntlet the
mother, who was sincerely rejoiced to see our
hero in the capacity of her son-in-law. From
her habitation they proceeded homewards at an
easy pace, and, amidst the acclamations of the
whole parish, entered their own house, where
Emilia was received in the most tender manner,
by Mr. Clover's wife, who had provided every
thing for her ease and accommodation, and, next
day, surrendered unto her the management of
her own houshold affairs.</P>
