<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>ON a mild evening in September last,
as the two nieces of Col. Dormer, a
gentleman of small fortune, in Rutland, were
leaning over the terrace wall of their uncle's
garden, admiring the radiant lustre of the
setting sun, the mixed gold and azure which
played on a rustic temple belonging to a
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
neighbouring villa, praising the heart-felt
pleasures of retirement, and the tranquil
joys of a rural life, the lovely Lady H—,
whose charms had raised her to the most
distinguished rank, happened to pass by, in
a superb carriage, with a numerous train of
attendants, in her way to the North.</P>
<P>The sisters, for which we shall hereafter
account, were differently affected: Louisa
beheld this splendid equipage with languid
admiration, and returned to contemplate the
objects which had before engaged her at∣tention.</P>
<P>The eyes of Maria, on the contrary, fol∣lowed
the coach till it was out of sight: she
continued some time after gazing at vacan∣cy:
awaking at length from her reverie, she
looked at her sister in silence; she sighed;
her bosom beat with an emotion unknown
before; she forgot “the radiant lustre of
the setting sun, the mixed gold and azure
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
which played on the rustic temple, the
heart-felt pleasures of retirement, the
tranquil joys of a rural life;” and felt,
for the first time, the poison of ambition at
her heart.</P>
<P>She walked slowly, with her sister, to∣wards
the house; she stopped—after a short
pause—“Don't you think, Louisa?”—she
hesitated—conscious of the idea which filled
her whole soul, she fixed her eyes on the
ground; the rising blush of modesty ex∣panded
on her lovely cheek.</P>
<P>The supper-bell now made them quicken
their pace; but, before they obey its sum∣mons,
let me introduce to the acquaintance
of my reader the two heroines of my story,
with the respectable man under whose roof
they had passed the last ten years of their
lives.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>LOUISA and Maria Villiers were
the twin daughters of a country gen∣tleman;
or, to use a phrase more suited to
his character, a <HI>squire,</HI> a race happily almost
extinct, who was descended from a worthy
family in Nottinghamshire. To give his
history in few words, before he arrived at
the age of thirty-two he had wasted a de∣cent
estate in the elegant pleasures of
racing, cock-fighting, and drinking, with
beings as much below the standard of hu∣manity
as himself; and sent out of the
world, with a broken heart, an amiable wife
after two years marriage.</P>
<P>He died himself, happily for his daugh∣ters,
whilst they were still of an age to pro∣fit
by the excellent education given them by
their mother's brother, Col. Dormer; who,
in every literary pursuit becoming their sex,
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
had been himself their preceptor; and who
had gone even beyond the bounds of his
little fortune to procure them, as far as his
remote situation and retired manner of living
made possible, those external accomplish∣ments
on which most grave people are apt
to set too little value; or, in the words of
a late noble writer, to give them “The
Graces.”</P>
<P>This gentleman, the worthy protector of
our heroines, was the younger son of the
younger son of a very noble family in a
distant part of the kingdom: he had en∣tered
early into the army, where he had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erved with honour; but a weak constitu∣tion,
some military disappointments, a native
love of retirement, a quarrel with the head
of his family, and the death of a wife he
loved to adoration, had determined him to
quit the service at thirty, though he had
every thing to hope from continuing in it:
he had bought a small house, with an estate
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
of about five hundred pounds a year, at
Belfont, a delightful village in Rutland;
where, as the human mind must always have
a pursuit, he acquired a passion for garden∣ing;
a passion which filled up those hours
which might have lain heavy on his hands,
and chased the monster <HI>Ennui,</HI> to avoid
whose chilling embrace, men turn rakes,
heroes, gamesters, politicians, and hunt
Folly through her ever-varying circles.</P>
<P>But to return: the shattered remains of
Mr. Villiers's estate, after paying a heavy
load of debt, produced about three thou∣sand
pounds; which, with good birth, and
a more than common share of beauty, com∣posed
the whole patrimony of our amiable
orphans.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE said, my heroines were hand∣some:
they were much more; they had
the soul, as well as the outward form, of
beauty: they had countenance, character,
expression.</P>
<P>Louisa was fair, her features regular, her
hair auburn, her eyes the celestial blue of
the poets: she had a look of blended soft∣ness,
languor, and indolence, which strongly
painted the native features of her mind.</P>
<P>Maria—But as she is to stand on the
foreground of the picture, she deserves a
more particular description.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>MARIA then—</OPENER>
<P>Her face was oval, her complexion
brown, her eyes dark and full of fire, her
nose Greek, her mouth small, her teeth re∣gular
and of the most pearly whiteness, her
under lip a little pouting. Her chesnut
tresses would have waved (if the despotic
tyrant Fashion had allowed them the liberty
of waving) in natural ringlets down her bo∣som.
She was tall, and elegantly formed;
her every motion exquisitely graceful: but
it was a gracefulness I know not how to de∣fine;
it was what courts may improve, but
cannot bestow; it was native, I had almost
said <HI>wild;</HI> it was unstudied, spontaneous,
and varied, as the lovely play of the leaves
when gently agitated by the breath of Ze∣phyr.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Natural in all, she had, when conversing
with those she loved, a smile of bewitching
sweetness; but, when injured, a look of in∣effable
disdain; a look which however be∣came
her, because it evidently arose from
the occasion.</P>
<P>Warm, sincere, simple, unaffected, undis∣guised,
every turn of temper and of senti∣ment
was painted instantaneously on her
countenance.</P>
<P>She had one charm, which is of infinitely
more importance than is generally sup∣posed;
I mean, that luxurious melody of
voice in speaking, which passes irresistibly
to the heart.</P>
<P>Though beauty was the portion of each,
yet nothing could have less resemblance
than the persons of these sisters; though
virtue formed the basis of each character,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
yet nothing could differ more than the fea∣tures
of their minds. Louisa was mild, in∣active,
tender, romantic; Maria quick, im∣patient,
sprightly, playful: nor were their
views and wishes less opposite; Louisa fan∣cied
Happiness reposed on roses in the shade,
Maria sighed to pursue the fugitive goddess
through the brilliant mazes of the world.
Each had the bloom of health; but it
glowed more vivid on the cheek of Maria.</P>
<P>Col. Dormer, their uncle and guardian,
though he had passed his youth in the
mixed society of mankind, still retained that
beautiful simplicity of character which is
generally the companion of very exalted un∣derstanding:
he was well-bred, as much
from his early intercourse with the great
world (an intercourse which had been long
almost entirely suspended), as from the feel∣ings
of a heart naturally desirous to please;
but that good-breeding never passed the
bounds of the most exact and undeviating
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
sincerity. Generous to the extent of his
income, frank, hospitable, chearful, his ta∣ble
was the seat of decent plenty and convi∣vial
delight.</P>
<P>An enthusiastic admirer of truth, nature,
and genuine beauty; his house, his gar∣dens,
his fields, every thing around him, re∣flected
his own mind.</P>
<P>Simplicity, neatness, elegance, were the
characteristics of his little domain: delicate
in his choice, attentive in his culture, his
flowers bloomed more fair, his fruit had a
more delicious flavour, than those of his
more opulent neighbours.</P>
<P>Indeed his most striking failing was that
of valuing himself rather too much on this
subordinate merit: he would, I am afraid,
have been better pleased with the reputa∣tion
of being the most skilful gardener, than
the best officer, or even the worthiest man,
in the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
He was tall, had fine eyes, a dark and ra∣ther
pale complexion; with the air and de∣portment
of a man who had seen that world
from which he had long withdrawn.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Dormer this evening perceived a
thoughtfulness and constraint in
Maria's behaviour, which, being unusual,
exceedingly alarmed him: he told her so;
she pleaded, what she really felt, the head∣ach,
and retired early to her apartment.</P>
<P>She passed the night without rest; the
ideas of coaches, coronets, titles, filled her
mind, and effectually murdered sleep. She
rose, determined to pass the winter in Lon∣don,
the only place where, according to her
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
new-born idea, beauty and merit were al∣lowed
their sterling value; but greatly per∣plexed
in what manner to propose to her
uncle a design which she was absolutely cer∣tain
he would disapprove.</P>
<P>Col. Dormer, though he knew the human
heart, had yet never thought of taking his
nieces into more active scenes of life: he
had fallen into the common mistake of peo∣ple
past the meridian of their days, who,
feeling tranquillity their greatest good, do
not sufficiently reflect that it is insipid at
that season when expectation and the wish
for novelty are the springs which actuate
the mind; when all opens fair on the dawn∣ing
imagination, and a thousand ideal plea∣sures
play in the chearful rays of hope.</P>
<P>Youth is of itself gay and vivacious;
Maria possessed in a superior degree every
charm of that enchanting age; her conver∣sation
exceedingly amused him, and it never
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
occurred to him that his might not equally
amuse her, or that she could have a wish
beyond the little paradise of Belfont.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>MARIA wished to methodize her plan,
a plan she was however resolved at
all events to pursue, before she proposed the
journey to her uncle. After waiting two
months, a conjuncture presented itself, which
seemed favourable to her wishes: by the will
of a relation she was, though not of age, to
receive immediately a legacy of two hundred
pounds, which she was to employ in what∣ever
manner she thought proper, without
accounting to her guardian.</P>
<P>A favourite servant of her late mother, a
woman of worthy character, had just before
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
taken a house in Berners-street, and had
written to entreat her recommendation of
some single lady to hire her best apartments,
which she assured her were fitted up with
the utmost elegance.</P>
<P>And, what made this house particularly
agreeable to her, it was in the next street
to a lady with whom she had made an ac∣quaintance
the preceding summer; a lady
whom she extremely loved, and under whose
protection she hoped to be introduced, with
every advantage, into the brilliant circle for
which her heart now so ardently panted.</P>
<P>This lady, Mrs. Herbert, was a young
widow of fashion and unblemished charac∣ter;
rich, good-humoured, lively, dissi∣pated,
and a little capricious; she had
spent the summer with a family in Col.
Dormer's neighbourhood, and, finding no
being half so pleasing in the little <HI>coterie</HI>
with whom she lived when in the country,
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
had distinguished Maria by a very flattering
preference; a preference which her young
heart, then unemployed, ever on the <HI>qui
vive,</HI> and not absolutely satisfied with the
calm though steady affection of her sister,
returned by the most animated friendship.</P>
<P>Nor was Mrs. Herbert insensible to Ma∣ria's
regard; on the contrary, she had her
perpetually with her, and found a thousand
charms in her conversation: she had indeed
taken such an amazing fancy to her, that
nothing but this amiable girl's being fifty
times handsomer than herself, could have
prevented her giving her an invitation to
her house in town.</P>
<P>Mrs. Herbert really loved Maria, as much
as she could love any thing except admira∣tion;
but that was her primary object, and
she well knew, the science of light and shade
was as necessary a study to a beauty as to a
painter.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
She therefore chose for her constant
companion, particularly in public, a long,
lean, brown, young lady, of good family,
and not ungenteel, but with a face about
three scruples handsomer than that of Me∣dusa;
doated on the Opera and Ranelagh
because there were no two places where peo∣ple
looked so well; and abjured the Pan∣theon,
not because it was <HI>triste,</HI> but because
it was unbecoming.</P>
<P>To this friend Maria would at first have
communicated her design, had she not pleased
herself with the idea of surprizing her by
an unexpected visit.</P>
<P>She was a little tempted to ask Louisa to
accompany her; but when she reflected, that
by so doing she should leave her uncle in
absolute solitude, she waved the idea, and
determined to undertake the journey alone.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21"/>
Had she asked her concurrence, she had
however probably been refused. Louisa's
blue eyes had not been turned on the rustic
temple merely to admire the radiant lustre
of the setting sun, but to contemplate <HI>the
human face divine,</HI> in the person of a very
handsome youth, the only son of the squire
of the parish, but who, happily, had not an
atom of squire-ism in his composition.</P>
<P>In short, Louisa loved; Maria's hour was
not yet come; a distinction which will suf∣ficiently
account for the different manner in
which they had been affected by the brilli∣ant
object which had banished peace from
the bosom of the latter.</P>
<P>After settling the plan with herself, Ma∣ria
determined to pursue it the moment she
could assume sufficient courage to disclose
to Col. Dormer her wish to pass a few
months in London.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22"/>
She knew he would remonstrate, but she
had previously resolved it should be in vain:
she was clear his disapprobation would be
only temporary; and painted to herself in
glowing colours his rapture and surprize,
when he should see her return to Belfont,
after an absence of two or three months, with
a ducal coronet on her coach; an event of
which she had not the remotest doubt.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>TO recount all Maria's timid efforts to
unveil her purpose to her uncle, and
to observe how often her heart failed her,
would be exceedingly uninteresting to the
reader. Suffice it then to say, that, after
several weeks of irresolution, during which
the agitation of her mind exceedingly af∣fected
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
her temper, and in some degree her
health, Maria proposed the journey with
hesitation, and her uncle resisted with firm∣ness;
till, at last, wearied out, not con∣vinced,
and at once distressed and softened
by seeing the gloom continue, which he
hoped would have passed over like a light
cloud before the summer breeze, he, after a
thousand cautions against the arts of a world
to which she was a perfect stranger, reluc∣tantly
gave his consent.</P>
<P>He cautioned her, not against the giants
of modern novel, who carry off young ladies
by force in post-chaises and six with the
blinds up, and confine free-born English
women in their country houses, under the
guardianship of monsters in the shape of fat
housekeepers, from which durance they are
happily released by the compassion of Ro∣bert
the butler; but against worthless ac∣quaintance,
unmerited calumny, and ruinous
expence.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
The first dangers he knew were generally
imaginary, the latter, alas! too real.</P>
<P>After many long conversations, in which
this amiable old man drew a faithful pic∣ture
of the various evils to which she was
going unnecessarily to expose herself; and
which she heard with the attention gene∣rally
given by presumptuous, believing,
unsuspecting youth to the prudent lessons of
wary experience; her journey was fixed for
Tuesday the 10th of January; and an old
grey-headed footman, who had lived twenty
years with Mr. Dormer, was ordered to pre∣pare
to go with her, and attend on her
whilst in town.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>BEHOLD her at length in possession of
her uncle's consent, though obtained
in a manner which did not quite satisfy her
feelings.</P>
<P>His arguments appeared to have some
weight, though she was pre-determined not
to be convinced by them. She saw some∣thing
like just drawing in the dark shades
of his pencil, though the lines seemed a
good deal exaggerated: she reflected, she
doubted; but, after settling a balance in
her mind, she found her own scale prepon∣derate;
and easily obviated all the dangers
he had so elaborately displayed, by deter∣mining
to make no new acquaintance to
whom she should not be introduced by her
friend, Mrs. Herbert; and to return, if un∣successful,
to the tranquil shades of Belfont,
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
as soon as the legacy, which she had appro∣priated
to the execution of her plan, should
be expended.</P>
<P>As to calumny, such was her knowledge
of the world, that she thought herself secure
from its attacks, only by resolving not to
merit them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>ON Tuesday then, the 10th of January,
about ten o'clock, Col. Dormer's post∣chaise
(for he would not trust her to any
other conveyance) drove up to the door.</P>
<P>The tears of her sister, the benevolent
concern on the countenance of her uncle,
with her own involuntary horror at leaving
what was almost her paternal roof, and
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
parting with friends so tenderly attached to
her, a little shook her resolution: but her
desire of pursuing this ardent impulse of her
soul, was a resistless torrent, which her own
good sense, and her respect for the opinion
of the man on earth whom she believed the
wisest and best, in vain opposed.</P>
<P>Louisa prest her to her bosom; neither
of them were able to speak. Mr. Dormer
led her to the chaise; he kissed her cheek,
“My dear child,” said he, “as I cannot
prevent your embarking on the tempes∣tuous
ocean of the world, I have only this
to add; when beat by the storm, remem∣ber
you have a safe port always within
your reach.”</P>
<P>The chaise, attended by John on horse∣back,
had proceeded through half the vil∣lage,
when, on turning the corner of a
street, the terrace of her uncle's garden
struck Maria's sight: the tears gushed from
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
her eyes, her heart reproached her with in∣gratitude,
she felt her uncle's excess of
goodness, she felt the happiness she was go∣ing
to quit, and was on the point of order∣ing
the servants to return: she had even let
down the fore-glass of the chaise for that
purpose, when the fond deceiver, Hope,
painted to her lively imagination the gaudy
scene which had originally misled her. Her
sister's affection, her uncle's accumulated
kindness, the silent language of her own
heart, every whisper of discretion and of
sentiment, the pictures drawn by Truth and
Nature, faded away before the dazzling blaze
of a coronet.</P>
<P>She drew up the glass, and proceeded on
her journey, her bosom beating with min∣gled
regret and expectation. We will leave
her on the road, and return for a moment
to Belfont.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Dormer and Louisa stood some
time at the window without speak∣ing:
at length the latter put an end to the
silence, by venturing to ask her uncle a
question, which probably the reader may
have been inclined to ask already; “Why,
if he foresaw such dangers in her sister's
being in London unprotected, he had not
himself accompanied her?”</P>
<P>He was struck by the question, as it had
more than once obtruded itself on his own
mind: he answered her as he had before
answered himself: he pleaded his decline of
life, his indolence of temper, his delicate
health, his disgust of the world, his love of
tranquillity and retirement.</P>
<P>He did not perhaps himself really per∣ceive
the governing spring of his reluctance
to quit Belfont.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30"/>
At another season he would not have hesi∣tated
a moment; but to leave his garden
during the three most important months of
the year—his early flowers, his hyacinths
then ready to blow, his tulips, his anemo∣nies,
his auriculas; his lovely new polyan∣thus,
the invaluable present of a curious
friend at the Hague—all the blooming hope
of the genial spring, the floral pride of the
rising year—all, all, would too probably pe∣rish,
if he left the tender nurselings, or (to
speak in technical terms) the <HI>babes,</HI> at this
critical juncture.</P>
<P>Gentle Critic, if thou art not a Florist,
reflect one moment, that the ruling passion
is, in its effects, the same, has the same art
of throwing a veil over our reason, what∣ever
happens to be its object.</P>
<P>Man of the World, consider, that the pur∣suit
of the Florist is, at least, innoxious: no
ruined virgin, no agonizing parent, weep
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
his blameless pleasures: he pursues beauty
without the wish to destroy it: tender of
his lovely charge, he resembles the vernal
breeze, thou the chilling blight which
marks its progress by destruction.</P>
<P>But to resume our story. Louisa was
unwilling to carry the subject too far; she
trembled lest her uncle should return her
question by another—it was so natural <HI>she</HI>
should have desired to accompany her sister
—so natural Col. Dormer should be sur∣prized
she never made the offer.—She there∣fore
changed her style, spoke of Mrs. Her∣bert's
attachment to Maria, of the immense
advantage of having such a friend to con∣sult
on every occasion, a friend in possession
of general esteem, and able to introduce her
with <HI>eclat</HI> into the best company; of the
great faithfulness of John, and the good
woman in whose house Maria was to reside;
and concluded by observing, that her sister's
excursion would amuse and perhaps improve
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
her; and could have no further ill conse∣quence
than dissipating a part (or what if
all) of the legacy which seemed to have
been left her for that very purpose.</P>
<P>They passed into the garden, and from
the terrace cast a tender look at the great
road, where they endeavoured to trace the
wheels of Maria's carriage.</P>
<P>Mr. Dormer was absorbed in thought;
Louisa perhaps stole, unobserved, a look at
the rustic temple.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>MARIA's chaise flew along with a ve∣locity
almost equal to her impa∣tience,
till it stopped at the Bell at Stilton;
where, reflecting on the inconvenience her
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
uncle must suffer by being without a car∣riage,
she, though contrary to his express
injunction, sent it back, and took a post∣chaise
the rest of the way.</P>
<P>In compassion to old John, who found
some difficulty in keeping up with her, she
slept that night at Biggleswade, and got
into London about five the next afternoon,
without meeting with any adventure worthy
the dignity of history to recount.</P>
<P>Mrs. Merrick, with whom she was to
lodge, a little, fair, fat, honest, loquacious,
good-humoured, good sort of personage, of
about forty-six, met her at the door with a
thousand curtesies, a thousand smiles of un∣dissembled
affection, and conducted her to
her apartment, where she had scarce en∣tered,
when she dispatched a card to inform
Mrs. Herbert of her arrival, and to beg to
see her immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34"/>
Her heart danced with hope, she counted
the moments with impatience: John re∣turned;
she met him on the stairs; when he
informed her, the lady was at Paris, and the
time of her being in England uncertain.</P>
<P>It is not necessary to paint her disappoint∣ment;
she was however constrained to sub∣mit;
she drank her tea, she supped, she re∣tired
to rest; she passed the next day, and
the next, in solitude; it was the first time
in her life she had been alone; she sat
down pensive to her silent meal; the shades
of evening came, but came unattended by
the chearful voice of domestic pleasure; the
enlivening smile of friendship, the social, the
convivial hour was far away.</P>
<P>She listened, in expectation of she knew
not what; she heard a thousand coaches,
but they passed her door; she saw crowds,
but to these crowds she was unknown: she
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
seemed a solitary being, cut off from the so∣ciety
of human kind; she sighed for the
shades of Belfont; the promised scene of
happiness she found a dreary void.</P>

<P>A Thousand moralists and philosophers
have declaimed on the joys of soli∣tude,
on the advantages of silent contempla∣tion.
May I be allowed to suspect them of
affectation, if not of falsehood? For my
own part, I had rather be a beggar happy
in the converse of my fellow beggars, than
a princess condemned to solitary greatness.</P>
<P>My heroine, for which I love her, thought,
or rather felt, in the same manner: unable
to bear any longer that divine state of hea∣venly
solitude and contemplation so praised
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
by the wise men of whom I have been
speaking, she on the fourth evening invited
Mrs. Merrick, the good woman of the house,
to sup with her; she thought any company
better than none, and she thought justly;
if it was only for the pleasure of hearing the
sound of one's own voice—if only—In
short, a human being who can live without
conversation must be little better than a
beast, and ought to be driven out to eat
grass with Nebuchadnezzar.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the course of the evening's conversa∣tion,
Mrs. Merrick had hinted her sur∣prize
at Maria's coming to town to live by
herself; and, on being acquainted with her
disappointment in respect to Mrs. Herbert,
had begged leave to introduce her▪ to a
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
mighty agreeable widow lady, to whom this
good woman had formerly been house∣keeper,
and who lived in the same street.
This lady was, to use Mrs. Merrick's own
phraseology, one of <HI>the quality,</HI> and kept
the very best <HI>of</HI> company.</P>
<P>Maria's heart bounded with joy at the
proposal; she had no time to lose; her
money might be all spent before Mrs. Her∣bert
returned; the resource of which I shall
speak presently might fail; and though there
were several ladies then in town who visited
at Col. Dormer's, yet she was not suffici∣ently
intimate with any one of them to ex∣pect
the kind of protection she wanted.</P>
<P>Mrs. Merrick waited on the lady in the
morning; who, after a very minute enquiry
into Maria's situation, family, character,
and connexions, and on hearing she was
a particular friend of Mrs. Herbert's,
whom she happened to visit, readily under∣took
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
the office of her <HI>chaperon,</HI> and invited
her to a rout at her house in the following
week; first passing through the necessary
introductory form of rapping very hard at
her door, and leaving a card,</P>
<P>Lady Hardy at home Jan. 19th.</P>

<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>BEHOLD her now happy, on the eve
of being introduced into the world,
that world for which her little heart panted:
the radiant picture drawn by Hope again
started into ideal existence, and resumed its
pristine glow.</P>
<P>As she wished to proportion the means to
the end, she went to her bureau, and
counted her wealth: she found it amounted
to an hundred and ninety-four pounds thir∣teen
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
shillings and six-pence, a sum which
she supposed would last her a good part of
the winter.</P>
<P>But, should it be expended sooner, she
had another resource: a mine unopened;
and to all but herself, undiscovered; a mine
she thought inexhaustible.</P>
<P>To be explicit, she had <HI>genius,</HI> that ema∣nation
of the Divinity, that fatal gift of
heaven, pleasing to others, ruinous to its
possessor.</P>
<P>From almost infancy she had</P>
<P>“Lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came.”
but had never found sufficient courage to
own this circumstance, even to her sister, to
whom she had no other secret.</P>
<P>Her portmanteau was her only <HI>confidante;</HI>
and it now contained a novel, an epic poem,
and a tragedy.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40"/>
Though she had expectations from the
two first, yet it was on the last she placed
her dependance.</P>
<P>Diffident as she was by nature, that en∣thusiasm
inseparable from true genius, broke
through the veil which modesty would have
thrown over the merit of this piece; she
felt she had succeeded beyond her warmest
hopes: the fable was interesting and pa∣thetic,
the characters strongly marked, and
the language at once mellifluous and sub∣lime.</P>
<P>Certain of her tragedy being received
with rapture by the managers, if her affairs
should oblige her to offer it, she had no dif∣ficulty,
but in determining to which house
to give the preference.</P>
<P>The shining talents of Mr. Garrick, of
which she had heard and read so much,
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
would have left no room for doubt, had she
not been accidentally informed this great
actor had left off playing himself in new
pieces; a circumstance extremely mortify∣ing
to her self-love, as she had drawn the
hero of her piece with a view to his per∣forming
the character.</P>
<P>At length she determined to take every
possible opportunity of seeing tragedies at
both theatres, and to regulate her conduct
by the different degrees of merit in the per∣formers.</P>
<P>As she had however no present intention
of entering the lists of fame, she descended
from the heights of Parnassus to consult
Mrs. Merrick (with whom we will leave her
for the present) on the oeconomy of her
dress for Lady Hardy's rout, the expected
aera of a new life of happiness.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>I KNOW not which, of two very com∣mon
errors, most merits reprehension,
the thoughtless passion of young ladies in
the country to see London, or the short∣sighted
wisdom of their papas and mammas,
such I mean whose situations give them the
power to comply, in neglecting to indulge
<PB N="44" REF="44"/>
this very pardonable inclination; an incli∣nation
founded on the restless curiosity of
the human mind, and never dangerous but
when controlled.</P>
<P>Let your children, ye careful parents, see
this world of which they entertain such fal∣lacious
ideas. Let their own experience,
for they will never grow wise from yours,
break the gay bubble which fond imagina∣tion
had formed; let them run the giddy
round of fashionable amusement unre∣strained,
and satiety will soon be the cer∣tain
effect of your complaisance.</P>
<P>Let them see this boasted world, but be
yourselves their guides through the whirling
maze; be constant sharers in all their plea∣surable
pursuits; and, whilst you lead them
through the flowery road of dissipation,
shew them the rocks and precipices by
which it is surrounded.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="45"/>
Inspire them with a disgust of bad com∣pany,
by introducing them into good; and
prevent their mixing in diversions dangerous
to morals, by suffering them to enjoy freely
such as have a contrary tendency; such as,
whilst they improve and inform the mind,
contribute to elevate, to enlarge, to refine
the heart.</P>
<P>In order to secure this important point,
you need in general only leave them to
themselves; they will almost always chuse
better than you; their taste is natural, yours
too often acquired.</P>
<P>They will never voluntarily offer incense
at the shrine of <HI>Pam;</HI> they will be cold to
that destructive passion, Play; that passion
which levels youth and age, wisdom and
folly, dignity and meanness, vice and virtue;
which quenches every spark of the divine
fire within us; blunts the edge of wit, ren∣ders
<PB N="46" REF="46"/>
knowledge useless, undermines the em∣pire
of beauty, and tears the palm from the
brow of honour; that passion which con∣tracts
the understanding, hardens the heart,
annihilates all the finer feelings of the soul,
and renders human society a state of selfish
uncomfortable warfare.</P>
<P>But they will run with avidity to the
theatres of every kind: with the noble
enthusiasm of uncorrupted taste, they will
worship the sister Muses, the lovely Powers
of Poesy and of Song.</P>
<P>Hurried away by the charms of decla∣mation
and of harmony, their bosoms will
beat responsive to the magic sounds; sounds
rendered more interesting by all the graces
of action.</P>
<P>Their souls will be harrowed up by Lear
and by Medea, nor will they refuse a tear
to the expiring Montezuma.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="47"/>
They will weep with Romeo; and from
your relation of the past, regret that Juliet's
grave is not ideal.</P>
<P>They will not be equally delighted with
the Comic Muse. Youth are better judges
of the Passions than the Manners.</P>
<P>But a truce with reflection. We left
Maria, with the officious Mrs. Merrick, as∣sorting
ornaments for Lady Hardy's rout.</P>
<P>We should premise that she had, as in
politeness bound, paid her ladyship a morn∣ing
visit, had found her at home, and had
been most graciously received.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE 19th of January at length arrived.
Maria, to her native charms, had ad∣ded
all the adventitious advantages of dress
in her power: she had exhausted a third
part of her little treasury in preparing for
this important moment.</P>
<P>John being dispatched to call a chair, we
will dedicate the interval, till his return, to
Lady Hardy.</P>
<P>This worthy dowager, under whose happy
auspices our heroine was to be introduced
into the <HI>beau monde,</HI> was the relict of an an∣cient
baronet, of one of the best families in
the kingdom, who, observing her a hand∣some
healthy country girl, whilst dairy-maid
at his seat in—shire, took a fancy to
her, and kept her several years.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="49"/>
As she was at once artful and imperious,
she gained such an ascendant over her anti∣quated
lover, that at the end of fifteen
years, during which he had turned her out
of the house, and taken her in again, at
least fifteen times, he, in the first kind mo∣ments
of reconciliation, after a quarrel which
had lasted longer than usual, very gene∣rously
made her an honest woman, and
about a year from the date of this honoura∣ble
alliance was kind enough to make his
exit, leaving her in possession of two thou∣sand
pounds a year, half of which was in
her own disposal.</P>
<P>As the people of distinction in the neigh∣bourhood
shewed no very striking propen∣sity
to cultivate her Ladyship's acquaintance,
she very sensibly determined to transplant
herself to London, that seat of true hospita∣lity
and universal benevolence; where any
lady, who has a large house, an elegant
<PB N="50" REF="50"/>
carriage, well drest footmen, will play gold
loo, and now and then give a supper, may
with very little difficulty, and without pro∣ducing
a certificate of her virtuous life and
conversation (unless her deviations from the
rule of right have been very public indeed),
make her way into <HI>company,</HI> often into <HI>good
company,</HI> and sometimes, but this is rather
uncommon, into <HI>the best.</HI></P>
<P>But, that we may not rate her ladyship's
sagacity too high, it is proper to observe,
that this plan was not originally her own,
but was first suggested to her by a gentle∣man,
with whom, whilst he was on a visit
to the late Sir John, she had contracted a
friendship of the most interesting kind.</P>
<P>This gentleman, who, from having been
a lieutenant in the East-India Company's
service, had assumed the title of Captain, was
so admirable an oeconomist, that he main∣tained
a carriage and two footmen, drest
<PB N="51" REF="51"/>
well, and kept <HI>pretty good company,</HI> on an
annuity of sixty pounds a year.</P>
<P>We will suppose her Ladyship fixed in
town, aspiring to <HI>bon ton;</HI> her house, her
equipage, her dress, her parties, her sup∣pers,
arranged in due form by her friend
Captain Wilson.</P>
<P>We will suppose, that, by the assistance
of this worthy gentleman, who had repre∣sented
her to his female card acquaintance
as a woman of good family and connexions,
the widow of a baronet, with a great estate
and a large sum of ready money in her own
disposal, fine diamonds, an elegant equi∣page,
and a perfect ignorance of the mys∣teries
of the card-table (a circumstance
which greatly facilitated her admission), she
had been received into, and was become one
of the principal ornaments of, a society,
which merits, and therefore shall have, a
chapter devoted to its service.</P>

<P>THOSE of our readers who know the
world, or, to speak with more pro∣priety,
the town, and especially those who
play much at loo, that sovereign leveller of
all distinctions, need not be told, that, be∣sides
the various circles and semicircles into
which people of fashion are necessarily di∣vided
and subdivided, in a capital so im∣mense,
so opulent, so full of <HI>noblesse,</HI> as
London, there is a <HI>coterie</HI> which may, not
improperly, be considered as the intermedi∣ate
state between good and bad company,
as it touches the two extremities, and par∣takes
something of the nature of both; and,
whilst it is frequented by some persons of
rank, fashion, and character, admits without
scruple well-drest men of whom nobody
ever heard, ladies of equivocal fame, and
gamblers of almost every denomination.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="53"/>
This heterogeneous mass of unknown
gentlemen, self-made captains, demireps,
neglected coquets, antiquated virgins, and
dowagers <HI>sur le retour;</HI> in which however the
women are both in rank and reputation
greatly superior to the men; is by their ene∣mies
(and who have not enemies?) distin∣guished
by the appellation of <HI>a certain set.</HI></P>

if even title alone, abstracted from all
regard to character, or to the qualities of
the head and heart, could constitute good
company, <HI>a certain set</HI> would undoubtedly
merit that name: but if its ever-open gate
stands ready to admit all who, from what∣ever
cause, are either utterly rejected, or
coldly received, in more estimable society,
we may, without hesitation, venture to re∣fuse
it, collectively, that honourable appel∣lation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>OUR digression being ended, we beg
leave to resume Lady Hardy.</P>
<P>This amiable protectress of the blooming
Maria was, at the time when our history
commences, about the age of forty-three,
from which she had the modesty to sub∣tract
only eleven years.</P>
<P>She was, as to her person, what in the
country is called a hearty, hale, comely,
portly, woman; tall, large made, plump;
with coarse features, a ruddy complexion,
<PB N="55" REF="55"/>
and an air and manner not very expressive
of feminine softness.</P>
<P>Her tone of voice was strong and mascu∣line;
her address forward and self-sufficient;
she had an easy confidence, which nothing
could disconcert, a good natural understand∣ing,
with that instinctive cunning which in
the common concerns of life is of more im∣portance
than all the understanding in the
world.</P>
<P>She was vain, ignorant, insolent, as∣suming,
vociferous, and satirical; which
last quality she found of infinite service in
intimidating all who were once unfortu∣nately
enrolled on her visiting list, from
daring to drop her acquaintance.</P>
<P>She was gallant, but without much deli∣cacy
of choice; her first favourite, from a
similarity of sentiment, was Captain Wilson;
but though he was her <HI>home,</HI> yet her heart
<PB N="56" REF="56"/>
sometimes deviated into a temporary <HI>visit,</HI>
when she met with a handsome ensign whose
time hung heavy on his hands.</P>
<P>She was however so disinterested a lover
of virtue, that though she has now and
then, as we have already said, ventured to
disobey its dictates herself, she would not
allow any of her acquaintance to transgress
its smallest law with impunity; nor was she
ever known to give quarter to the minutest
degree of female indiscretion in another.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN and the chair arrived; Maria set
out; Lady Hardy received her at the
top of the stairs, praised her beauty, criti∣cized
her dress, laughed at her <HI>mauvaise
honte</HI> (for she blushed, trembled, and stam∣mered
<PB N="57" REF="57"/>
like an idiot), and led her into the
assembly.</P>
<P>Maria entered the rooms, equally agitated
by pleasure and apprehension: on advancing,
a cold tremor seized her, she turned pale,
she stopped; she felt, and felt painfully, the
disadvantage of not having been earlier in∣troduced
into the world; she wanted that
happy self-confidence which is the indul∣gent
companion of unblushing folly, but
which those of strong sense and quick feel∣ings
can only acquire by being, almost from
infancy, in a crowd.</P>
<P>She looked round her with a timidity
which for a time suspended all her powers:
the lights, the numerous company, the glare
of dress, the impertinently enquiring eyes of
the women, who had been apprized they
were to see a new beauty; the more com∣placent,
but not less curious, regards of a
few of the men (the greater part being too
<PB N="58" REF="58"/>
much engrossed by their cards to have af∣forded
a glance even to Venus herself, if
she had descended <HI>in propria persona</HI>) dis∣concerted,
and almost turned her to a
statue.</P>
<P>She was awed, she was intimidated by a
set of beings in the aggregate, whom consi∣dered
individually she would probably have
despised; at least if she had known their true
characters.</P>
<P>A confused murmur of admiration, as
Lady Hardy led her through the apart∣ments,
added at once to her embarrassment
and her charms.</P>
<P>As beauty was a flower not very common
in this autumnal <HI>parterre,</HI> the lovely Maria
excited astonishment; she would have ex∣cited
more animated sensations had any men
but gamesters been present: but I need not
inform my Reader that a true gamester is
not a <HI>sensitive,</HI> but a <HI>frost</HI> plant.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="59"/>
He is of no <HI>sex;</HI> as he is of no <HI>age,</HI> no

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>A Quarter of an hour had elapsed, our
heroine had recovered her presence of
mind; her apprehensions had given place to
unmixed pleasure; her ideas were still in
some degree tumultuous, but it was the tu∣mult
of delight: when Lady Hardy offered
her a card for one of the gold quadrille
tables; she was too happy not to be in∣clined
to comply with any thing: but had
not this been the case, though she hated
play, yet she wanted resolution to refuse.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="60"/>
She sat down without having dared to en∣quire
into the stake, and was surprized at
being asked for twenty guineas to put into
the pool.</P>
<P>As she carried her little exchequer in her
pocket, she was however amply prepared,
and had the good fortune to rise from the
table thirty guineas richer than she sat
down: a circumstance which, it may be
supposed, did not diminish her happiness.</P>
<P>She had just cut out, and was passing
from one room to another, Lady Hardy
leaning with an air of intimacy on her arm,
when a servant announced Lord Melvile.</P>
<P>She turned hastily at the sound of a title;
a sound for which she had listened impa∣tiently
the whole evening in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="61"/>
This young nobleman, the only son of
the Earl of Claremont, whose rank and cha∣racter
intitled him to shine in more distin∣guished
circles, happening to dine in the
neighbourhood, had accidentally, in his way
to Arthur's, rambled into Lady Hardy's,
whose parties he generally honoured with
his presence about once a year.</P>
<P>The first object that struck his sight was
Maria, her countenance drest in smiles of
undissembled pleasure, talking earnestly to
Lady Hardy.</P>
<P>So much beauty, under such protection,
must necessarily attract the notice of every
man who was at all its votary.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile's eyes met those of Maria;
she blushed; he regarded her with an at∣tention
the most flattering possible to her
charms; but in which, if she had known
<PB N="62" REF="62"/>
the world, she would probably have ob∣served
a mixture of something like hope,
not quite so flattering to her virtue.</P>
<P>If the well-known character of her <HI>chape∣ron,</HI>
“whom (to borrow the admirable de∣finition
of Fielding) every body knew to
be what nobody chose to call her,” might
naturally encourage ideas unfavourable to
Maria's honour, her own present appear∣ance
was not very well adapted to destroy
them.</P>
<P>The transport of seeing herself in the
chearful haunts of men after a week of un∣comfortable
solitude, the admiration she had
excited, perhaps her success at play which
pointed out a new source of <HI>ways and means,</HI>
with the revival of that brilliant imagination
which had at first seduced her from Belfont,
and the sight of a man she thought formed
to realize her fairy dreams of greatness; all
conspired to give a glow to her complexion,
<PB N="63" REF="63"/>
a fire to her eyes, a gaiety, I had almost said
a <HI>levity,</HI> to her air, which it was not difficult
to misinterpret.</P>
<P>Fresh and blooming as Hebe, playful as
the Mother of the Loves, her form, her
manner, invited the spoiler, whom the pu∣rity
of her heart would, if known, have
repelled.</P>
<P>If she appeared charming to Lord Mel∣vile,
he did not seem less so to her.</P>
<P>Amongst such men as composed Lady
Hardy's assembly, he seemed, what indeed
he was, a being of a superior order.</P>
<P>To a countenance full of expression, eyes
that anticipated all he meant to say, and a
form more perfect than that of the Belvedere
Apollo, Lord Melvile added that air of di∣stinction,
that easy dignity, compared to
which, beauty alone is a meer dead letter.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="64"/>
His address was polite, spirited, insinu∣ating;
his conversation that happy mixture
of good sense and frivolousness which makes
the most pleasing of all compounds, and is
so particularly agreeable to women.</P>
<P>He had read, he had travelled; he knew
books and mankind; but the latter had un∣fortunately
been shewn to him through the
wrong end of the perspective.</P>
<P>His father, Lord Claremont, besides being
naturally of a gloomy and suspicious turn of
mind, had seen the world in the way most
likely to give him unfavourable impressions
of it; he had stood high in administration;
and, on a change of men, had figured not
less conspicuously on the side of opposition:
the school of modern politicks not being the
purest school of rectitude, he had found a
great part of those with whom he co-ope∣rated
knaves, and therefore naturally
<PB N="65" REF="65"/>
enough, though very falsely, concluded
knavery to be the characteristic of mankind.</P>
<P>For such a world he had endeavoured to
form his son, and had, in this view, spared
no expence or trouble to improve and adorn
his person, polish his behaviour, cultivate
his understanding, and corrupt his heart;
in all which points his labours had been
crowned with tolerable success.</P>
<P>He found it however impossible to eradi∣cate,
and very difficult even to suspend, a
warm susceptibility of soul, and an extreme
good-nature, both which strongly opposed
those cold, uncomfortable, selfish maxims, on
which he endeavoured to form Lord Mel∣vile's
character.</P>
<P>He read him unceasing lectures on the
universal depravity of mankind, the sup∣posed
total selfishness of the human heart;
and, to confirm his precepts by the more
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>
forcible language of example, he introduced
him early into the intimate society of a set
of men, whose general principles were as
profligate as their outward conduct was re∣gular
and decent; and of women who prac∣tised
every vice with impunity, under the
mask of hypocrisy, and the sanction of <HI>bon
ton.</HI></P>
<P>To pursue my favourite allusion: in the
variegated garden of human life and man∣ners,
he industriously pointed out the weeds
to his son's observation, and concealed from
him with not less sedulous anxiety the flowers
with which it at least equally abounds.</P>
<P>Though he had instilled these destructive
principles into the young bosom of Lord
Melvile, principles calculated not only to
loosen the bonds that hold society together,
but to rob it of all its sweets, he had in∣structed
him to conceal them with the ut∣most
care.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="67"/>
He had taught him to “smile without
being pleased, to caress without affection;”
to profess friendship for the man he regarded
with aversion, and respect and esteem for the
woman he beheld with contempt: to dress
vice in the graceful garb of virtue, and con∣ceal
a heart filled with the deepest design,
under the beauteous veil of honest unsus∣pecting
integrity.</P>
<P>He had succeeded in making him one of
the most pleasing men in the world; he had
not absolutely failed in making him one of
the most artful. But, though his system of
conduct was formed on his father's plan, his
heart frequently revolted against it: his
principles were narrow and selfish, his feel∣ings

<P>SUCH was the man who now addressed
Maria, with that insinuating respect,
that graceful ease, that gentleness of man∣ner,
that softened tone of voice, that mix∣ture
of every thing seducing, which good
sense and good breeding equally dictate to
the man who wishes to gain the heart of
woman, and which was so peculiarly adapted
to ensnare that of our heroine.</P>
<P>Lady Hardy pressed him to play: he
pleaded an engagement, which obliged him,
however unwilling, to go in a quarter of an
hour.</P>
<P>She again offered a card to Maria—the
timid Maria now found courage to refuse:
Lady Hardy smiled maliciously; her young
friend blushed, and sat down.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="69"/>
Lord Melvile took the chair next her, he
talked, she found a thousand charms in all
he said; the subjects of his conversation
were trifles, but those trifles from him were
so interesting!—
<Q>“Then he would talk—good gods, how he would talk!”</Q></P>
<P>Her heart felt sensations to which she had
till this instant been a stranger—she did not
doubt he was actuated by the same emo∣tions
—he had asked, with an air of the ut∣most
anxiety, where so much beauty had
been till then concealed—that countenance
could not deceive—he certainly loved—all
she had heard, all she had read, of sympathy,
was realized—she anticipated the joy her
uncle and her dear Louisa would feel on
receiving her next letter—she blessed the
happy impulse that had brought her to
town.—These were the first moments in
which she could be said to live—they danced
away on downy pinions.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="70"/>
We will suppose Lord Melvile's quarter of
an hour, which he had however more than
doubled, was expired, we will suppose he
had left the assembly; we will imagine Maria,
after having followed him to the door with
her eyes, sitting pensively gazing on her fan,
insensible to all around her, when she was
suddenly awakened from her <HI>reverie</HI> by
Lady Hardy's presenting her to some of her
female friends, who were dispersing their
cards of invitation with a liberal hand. She
exchanged a profusion of civilities, and
found herself invited to sixteen card parties
in the course of the coming eight days.</P>
<P>My Reader will perhaps be surprized at
the facility with which she had made all this
acquaintance, as she was an utter stranger to
all the company: it may be therefore ne∣cessary
to observe, that, besides her being
represented as much richer than she really
was by Mrs. Merrick, who did not know
<PB N="71" REF="71"/>
the extent of her old master's extravagance,
and her playing ill enough, though she had
won to-night, to promise their avarice a har∣vest;
<HI>a certain set</HI> pique themselves more on
the quantity than the specific quality of their
visitants, and therefore pay a constant atten∣tion
to the great object of encreasing the
number of their tables.</P>
<P>The difficulty in respect to many <HI>coteries</HI>
is how to <HI>get in;</HI> may we be permitted to
say, the only difficulty in respect to this
truly hospitable one is how to <HI>get out?</HI></P>
<P>Miss Villiers's chair came, and was in due
course announced: as the party was begin∣ning
to break up, and she felt herself un∣tuned,
as to play, for the evening, she
gladly embraced the opportunity this event
presented of making her escape, as we shall
do of concluding the chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>MARIA returned from her visit, full
of a thousand pleasing ideas. She
sat down, and wrote a short letter to
Louisa.</P>
<P>“She had passed a delightful evening in
the best company, at the house of a very
respectable lady, the widow of a baronet;
had been invited by half a dozen ladies of
the most estimable character, to parties
where she should see only persons of the
first fashion; had attracted the notice of the
most amiable young nobleman in town, the
heir of an immense fortune.—But his rank
and fortune were the least considerations—
she had found the man she should have
chosen had she seen him in a cottage—the
man on earth formed to make her happy—
had found him in the most distinguished
rank—had found him possest of that be∣witching
delicacy of sentiment—that dear
<PB N="73" REF="73"/>
sensibility—that perfect honour—that noble
simplicity of character—that dignity of man∣ner
—his looks exprest such benevolence of
heart—such candour was painted on his
countenance—it was Virtue adorned by the
Graces—his eyes spoke the language of
truth and tenderness—their souls were
formed for each other—it was his least
merit to be the most lovely of mankind.”</P>
<P>She would have filled a folio sheet in this
Pindaric style, the style of a girl bred in
shades, who loves for the first time, if the
bellman had not reminded her to seal and
send away her letter.</P>
<P>She retired to bed, but joy kept her
waking: the idea of Lord Melvile pursued
her; she endeavoured to recollect every syl∣lable
he had said; his disinterested senti∣ments,
so resembling her own; his tone of
voice; those expressive changes of counte∣nance
—the eyes were the index of the
<PB N="74" REF="74"/>
mind—his had said—Good heavens! what
had they not said?</P>
<P>Lady Hardy had told her in a whisper at
parting, that Lord Melvile wore her chains:
she wished it too ardently not to have be∣lieved
it on much slighter evidence.</P>
<P>She was now clearly convinced of what
she had always believed, that there is be∣tween
certain souls a secret sympathy, which
it is almost impossible to resist.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>WE should be happy if that scrupulous
regard to truth, which is the first
duty of an historian, and from which it is
our firm resolution never to deviate, would
permit us to say, this wonderful sympathy
<PB N="75" REF="75"/>
was as strong on the side of Lord Melvile:
but the plain fact is, he went from Lady
Hardy's to Arthur's, played deep, won a
very considerable sum, retired home at two,
in all the pride of triumphant success, to
Mademoiselle Dorignon, and forgot, before
he reached Grosvenor-street, that there ex∣isted
such a being as Miss Villiers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>HOW then account for his Lordship's
temporary attention to the latter, or
for his having lengthened his quarter of an
hour at Lady Hardy's?</P>
<P>Nothing is more easy. Whilst he conti∣nued
to see Maria, and for some hours
after, he thought her charming; but he was
too much inured to beauty, to receive from
<PB N="76" REF="76"/>
it very forcible or very lasting impressions,
though it never failed to excite his admira∣tion
for the moment.</P>
<P>His attention to her was natural: she was
the only very handsome woman in the room;
she was young; she was new; she had,
though educated in the country, an air of
fashion, an elegance of manner as well as
of person, which the rest of this respectable
company in some degree wanted; she had
fine sense, and sprightliness, mixed with a
very interesting style of sentiment; she had
with him, that lively desire to please which
seldom fails of attaining its end; and what
was of still more importance, she had distin∣guished
him, the moment she saw him, in
the manner most flattering to his self-love.</P>
<P>His coquetry had therefore given the ad∣ditional
quarter of an hour; he had ob∣served
her refusal to engage at quadrille;
and, on the information of her blush, and
<PB N="77" REF="77"/>
Lady Hardy's very intelligible smile, had
justly placed it to his own account; he
thought this complaisance demanded some
little sacrifice on his part, and what less
could he make than an idle quarter of an
hour?</P>
<P>In short, he wished to secure, though his
present engagements left him without the
least intention to pursue, his conquest.</P>
<P>He even quitted her with a kind of half
reluctance, and went so far as to enquire
her name.</P>
<P>As his chair past along the streets, he
recollected her with pleasure; it was indeed
that tranquil, languid, unimpassioned style
of pleasure with which he had formerly con∣templated
the statue of the Medicean Ve∣nus;
but still it was pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="78"/>
He thought of her, it is true, without
emotion, but he <HI>thought of her;</HI> her image,
in all its native loveliness,</P>
<P>“Played round his head,—”
though it
“Came not to his heart.”—</P>
<P>It accompanied him to St. James's-Street,
mounted the stairs, seated itself by him at
the table, nor absolutely retired till the last
decisive throw, by making him master of
unexpected thousands, banished every idea
but that of his good fortune.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Melvile hastened home, as we
have said, with his prize, to Mademoi∣selle
Dorignon; a female more distin∣guished
<PB N="79" REF="79"/>
by her spirit than her charms; but
possest of that happy <HI>je ne sçai quoi</HI> which
so effectually answers the end of beauty:
a female who, to use the emphatical words
of the sweet swan of Twickenham;
<Q><L>“Was just not ugly, and was just not mad:</L>
<L>Yet ne'er so sure our passion to create,</L>
<L>As when she touch'd the bounds of all we hate.”</L></Q></P>
<P>His Lordship, having found this <HI>jewel of a
woman</HI> a noxious weed in the capital of a
neighbouring kingdom, had kindly con∣descended,
such is the empire of caprice, to
transplant her into <HI>his own fair garden.</HI></P>
<P>She presided at his table, and did the ho∣nours
of his house; a situation, however, for
which neither her birth or education had
very distinguishingly fitted her.</P>
<P>This amiable object of his Lordship's pre∣sent
inclination was the daughter of an arti∣zan
at Paris, had fallen early into the hands
<PB N="80" REF="80"/>
of an officer in the Swiss guards, had com∣pleted
her studies in the Rue St. Honoré,
where, after a variety of adventures, she
had attracted the notice of an old French
nobleman, who, after entering into a con∣vention
with her as his declared mistress,
being disgusted with a few little vivacities
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o which the warmth of her temper made
her sometimes unhappily subject, obligingly
contrived to transfer her to <HI>mi Lor Anglois,</HI>
as the easiest way of getting rid of her, with∣out
altercation, trouble, or expence: a cir∣cumstance
which we beg leave to submit to
the consideration of every English gentleman
when he sets out on his travels.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile found an elegant supper,
ready to be served, <HI>et des convives,</HI> the
younger sister of Dorignon, just arrived,
and a little Marquis, who, on pretence of
joining his regiment, then in garrison in the
Provinces, had left Paris, with all the
money he could procure, and eloped to
London with <HI>la petite Janeton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="81"/>
The countenance of Dorignon was drest
in smiles, which, being unusual, had the
greater power of attraction.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile, who, as he had made
supper wait an hour, expected a storm, was
enchanted with his reception. He entered
with ardour into the interests of <HI>la petite
Janeton,</HI> and prest her earnestly to fix her
residence in his house; an invitation she had
too much <HI>politesse</HI> to refuse.</P>
<P>Dorignon was this evening uncommonly
brilliant: she had carried her point in re∣spect
to her sister, without even having had
the trouble to signify her commands.</P>
<P>She was in some pain about Mons. le
Marquis, who might be an impediment to
her sister's advancement, and who could be
of no further service, as the voyage was
made, and his <HI>louis'</HI> reduced almost to the
<PB N="82" REF="82"/>
singular number: she however considered
she was in a country of liberty, where no∣thing
in nature was more easy, if he should
grow troublesome, than to give him his au∣dience
of dismission.</P>
<P>She might even, by a little <HI>tour d'addresse,</HI>
make a merit of delivering him up to his
father.</P>
<P>Full of these agreeable ideas, and a thou∣sand
more which presented themselves to her
fertile imagination, she put in practice all
her convivial powers of pleasing, the fruits
of her extensive knowledge of the heart of
man, and the various roads by which it is
accessible.</P>
<P>The divine creature! What engaging vi∣vacity!
What fire! What <HI>piquantes ca∣prices!</HI>
What were a thousand Villiers's to
the enchanting Dorignon!—Not handsome,
it must be confessed, nor very young; <HI>mais,
si enjouée! si amusante! si eveillée!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="83"/>
Her sallies indeed were sometimes a little
eccentric; but did not those very sallies
stamp a greater value on her paroxysms of
good humour? Could any thing be so insi∣pid
as meer youth and beauty? so <HI>ennuieuse</HI>
as eternal complaisance?</P>
<P>She was ruining him, it is true; <HI>mais
n'importe;</HI> was he the first man of fashion
she had ruined? To say nothing of her
French conquests, had not Sir George—
and Lord Y—worn her chains?</P>
<P>And was it not the <HI>ton</HI> to be a little <HI>de∣rangé?</HI>
Would not a wife, at any time, re∣trieve
his affairs?</P>
<P>Such a proof too she had given of her
disinterested attachment! had she not for
him (for so he had been taught to believe)
abandoned Mons. le Duc—in the very
first month of their arrangement? Mons. le
<PB N="84" REF="84"/>
Duc, it must be owned, was old and poor;
but still it was a sacrifice, and he ought to
be grateful.</P>
<P>To be grateful? We know not what idea
this phrase may present to our reader; but
to us it seems to want no comment.</P>
<P>His Lordship was not however sensible his
passion for the fair stranger was on the de∣cline:
perhaps he did not chuse to perceive
it, as he felt he had not sufficient resolution
to give her her <HI>congé,</HI> though he knew his
submission to her impertinent tyranny had
extremely lowered his character.</P>
<P>A little inclination, and more caprice,
had at first forged those chains which habit
and indolence had now riveted too strongly
for common efforts to break: his good-na∣ture
too contributed to render it difficult for
him to make those efforts.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="85"/>
And wherefore should he undertake so
painful a task? If she had, in some little
degree, ceased to interest, yet she still con∣tinued
to amuse, him; and to be amused
was of infinitely more consequence than
people in general imagined.</P>
<P>Besides, his bondage could not be of long
continuance: his father, who wanted money
to pay off a mortgage, would necessarily
marry him, and then the affair would die a
natural death, without any unpleasing ex∣ertion
on his side, or any pretence for al∣tercation
or reproaches on hers.</P>
<P>She could not expect him to disobey his
<HI>cher pere;</HI> and if she did, he should yield
to his <HI>cher pere</HI> the task of bringing her to
reason.</P>

<P>WE will leave Miss Villiers to enlarge
the circle of her very estimable
friends, to become in due form one of <HI>a cer∣tain
set,</HI> to make her fortune at gold qua∣drille,
to draw designs for her future coro∣net,
and to dream of the all-accomplished
Lord Melville.</P>
<P>We will leave the all-accomplished Lord

of the enchanting Dorignon; to
endeavour at twining festive wreaths round
the galling fetters he finds himself unable
to break, whilst we make a short visit to our
deserted friends at Belfont.</P>
<P>But let us first do justice to our heroine's
skill in physiognomy, by observing, that as
Lord Melvile was by nature all she had re∣presented
<PB N="87" REF="87"/>
him in her letter to her sister, she
could not fairly be accused of having painted
him ill.</P>
<P>His virtues, though in a great degree
expunged from his mind, by the very worst
of all possible educations, had left their
amiable traces still visible on his counte∣nance;

and keener observation than the inno∣cent

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT was one of those clear frosty mornings
in January<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The 21st of January, 1775.</NOTE>, which make us often for∣get
the season, the blue serene almost rival∣ing
the brightest tints of a summer sky,
when Col. Dormer and Louisa, impatient
to hear from their dear wanderer, drove, as
<PB N="92" REF="90"/>
soon as they had breakfasted, to meet their
letters at Stamford.</P>
<P>Col. Dormer was surprized at receiving
no answer from Mrs. Herbert; to whom he
had written the day after Maria left Bel∣font,
to recommend her in the strongest
terms to that friendship she had so warmly
professed for this amiable girl, which he
began to fear absence had totally destroyed.</P>
<P>He was not less surprized that Maria had
not mentioned this friend of her heart in
either of the two letters which he had al∣ready
received from her.</P>
<P>He considered the scene of dissipation in
which Mrs. Herbert was immersed, and
therefore excused that silence for which he
was prepared; but could not account for
so blameable an inattention in Maria: he
had, this very day, written to chide her
gently for so unpardonable a neglect, and
<PB N="93" REF="91"/>
to ask a thousand questions respecting her
fair friend.</P>
<P>As Maria abhorred every approach to
deceit, she had herself reflected on this
omission, and thought herself obliged in
honour to communicate to her uncle a cir∣cumstance,
of which, for his own tranquil∣lity,
she could have wished him to remain
ignorant: she had done this in the letter
that now waited him at Stamford; she
however softened the information by saying
what was true, that Mrs. Herbert was every
day expected in England; and that, in the
mean time, she was under the protection of
a lady who was so happy as to be of her
acquaintance.</P>
<P>This letter, having been written the day
of her visit to Lady Hardy, and sent away
before she left her own house, arrived at
the same time with that to Louisa, giving
an account of the delightful evening she
<PB N="94" REF="92"/>
had past in <HI>the best company,</HI> and of her
new-born passion for Lord Melvile.</P>
<P>Louisa, who, though romantic, was less
subject to receive sudden impressions, and a
thousand times more discreet than Maria,
saw a great deal to disapprove in her sister's
letter; she therefore made use of that li∣berty
to which every human being, of
every age and sex, has an unquestioned
right, and in which her uncle had always
indulged them, even when children, of ne∣ver
communicating their letters, except from
choice: she read it attentively, folded it up,
and, saying her sister was well, put it with
great seeming composure in her pocket.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="95" REF="93"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>LOUISA was, however, alarmed. She
knew the purity of Maria's heart, the
dignity of her sentiments; but she also
knew her indiscretion: she knew she was
much less beloved in the little circle of their
acquaintance than herself, and that any im∣prudence
of hers would therefore be infi∣nitely
more fatal.</P>
<P>There was a regularity in the mind of
Louisa, which set her amiable qualities in
the clearest and most favourable light: the
virtues of Maria, on the contrary, though
perhaps stronger, were wild and Pindaric,
and therefore too often mistaken or over∣looked.</P>
<P>Louisa's attention was always at home;
she was polite to every creature with whom
she conversed, and polite almost equally to
<PB N="96" REF="94"/>
all: Maria's soul was on wing to oblige the
few she loved; but she was subject to little
absences in the common intercourse of life;
absences which wore the appearance of a
pride to which her heart was a stranger,
and which very naturally made her a thou∣sand
enemies whom she had never thought
of offending.</P>
<P>From a similar inattention, Maria was in∣discreet:
she overlooked, perhaps she de∣spised,
those trifling forms, which mask vice,
and protect virtue.</P>
<P>Conscious of her own integrity, and true
even to excess, she disdained every species
of disguise.</P>
<P>Had she faults? they appeared in their
native colours to every eye.</P>
<P>Had she virtues? she left them to shine
by their own unborrowed lustre.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="95"/>
Her mind, not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess pure and unsullied,
was obvious and transparent as the clear ri∣vulet
in the sequestered vale.</P>
<P>Maria should have avoided with care that
world in which she was so fond of mixing:
of the whole human race she was least
formed to be safe and happy in the undistin∣guished
general mass of society. Sincere,
rash, credulous as an infant, she invited
deceit, and stood a ready prey to the arts
of the selfish and designing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THESE were Louisa's reflections (nor
were her uncle's very dissimilar) dur∣ing
the remainder of their morning's airing;
reflections, only interrupted by two or three
very uninteresting visits to as many very un∣interesting
<PB N="98" REF="96"/>
gentlemen and ladies (uninterest∣ing
we mean to our Readers, who are
strangers to the chit-chat and politicks of
the little, though lovely, county of Rut∣land),
whose houses they must necessarily
pass in their way home.</P>
<P>The more Louisa considered her sister's
situation and turn of mind, the more she
found herself alarmed for her.</P>
<P>She trembled at dangers of which she
could however form only a very indistinct
and inadequate idea; and, as she had a high
opinion of her own <HI>comparative</HI> discretion,
was almost resolved to propose to her uncle
passing a month with Maria in town, and en∣deavouring
to bring her back to Belfont as
soon as that month should be at an end.</P>
<P>Nothing could be better concerted, or
more kind, than this determination, which
continued firm to the very entrance of their
own village.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="97"/>
She hesitated a little as she passed the
manor-house, and saw the sun-beams glitter
on the dear rustic temple, which was con∣stantly
honoured with her passing glance.</P>
<P>She began, as the chaise turned the cor∣ner
of her uncle's garden wall, to think her
design a little absurd; and condemned it as
absolutely wild and extravagant, on seeing
Mr. Montague, who was to spend only a
month longer at his father's, ring the bell
at the court-gate, in order to pay his cus∣tomary
morning visit, a visit he seldom
omitted.</P>
<P>He was to go back to College in a month:
that month—that little month—He was not
to return to Belfont till June—there would
be time enough to go to her sister after.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="100" REF="98"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Montague was the gentleman of
whom we made a slight mention <HI>en
passant</HI> in the beginning of this our history,
as the magnet which drew Louisa's eyes to
the rustic temple, and the latent cause of
her attachment to the shades of Belfont.</P>
<P>He was the only son of the lord of the
manor, to whom the whole village, except
Col. Dormer's estate, belonged.</P>
<P>He had been educated at Eton till seven∣teen;
and at the time when we have chosen
to begin our narrative, being exactly one-and-twenty,
was a fellow-commoner of Tri∣nity
College, Cambridge, where he had the
reputation of being a young man of un∣common
genius, and an excellent classical
scholar.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="99"/>
His father, a man of strong sense, a kind
of rural philosopher, who held the present
<HI>macaroni</HI> race in the utmost horror, had
taken infinite pains to accomplish him in all
those manly exercises, of which force, agi∣lity,
and health, are generally both the con∣sequence
and the reward.</P>
<P>He was of opinion, in which we entirely
agree with him, though against great autho∣rities,
that strength of body had a natural
tendency to produce strength of mind.</P>
<P>Active and light as air, Mr. Montague
danced, fenced, walked, rode, played
cricket, and shot flying, better than any
man, of whatever rank, in the next seven
counties: nor was he quite untaught in the
less gentleman-like exercises of quarter-staff,
boxing, and wrestling; exercises which the
good old man insisted, by multiplying the
means of defence, were calculated to in∣crease
courage, a consideration of no little
importance.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="100"/>
As his father had the best pack of hounds
in the neighbourhood, and was himself a
keen sportsman, he had early inspired him
with the ambition of being <HI>in at the death:</HI>
and though hunting was not his favourite
amusement, yet in these degenerate days,
when the robust race of hardy Nimrods are
dwindled to
<Q>“Puny insects shivering at a breeze—”</Q>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e might very well pass for an excellent fox∣hunter.</P>
<P>By the way, it might not be amiss at pre∣sent,
to encourage the race of <HI>squires,</HI> in or∣der
to keep up that of <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>But to Mr. Montague; his accomplish∣ments
were not all of the corporeal kind;
he was passionately attached to the enchant∣ing
sisters, Poetry and Music; had written
odes and sonnets which Horace and Petrarch
need not have blushed at owning; and was
<PB N="103" REF="101"/>
no mean proficient on that graceful and ele∣gant
instrument the <HI>viol de gamba.</HI></P>
<P>He was generous, humane, open, brave;
disdaining disguise, as below the dignity of
man, yet detesting that affected blunt im∣pertinence
which is generally the mask of a
villain.</P>
<P>He was easy, courteous, attentive, well∣bred;
but without the high Parisian var∣nish.</P>
<P>Though he set little value himself on this
species of merit, yet he might, without
being accused of presumption, have enrolled
himself on the list of handsome men.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more interesting than
his countenance; a countenance on which
candour, benevolence, and truth, were pic∣tured
in the strongest colours.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="102"/>
His eyes were dark, and expressive of the
utmost sensibility of heart; his complexion
brown, his hair the most beautiful chesnut;
his smile insinuating almost beyond de∣scription.</P>
<P>Tall, genteel, and finely proportioned; he
had the easy mien and unconstrained deport∣ment
of a gentleman, though he had never
breathed any air but that of his native
country.</P>
<P>His father, a determined enemy to the
modern system of education, was of opinion
<HI>the Graces,</HI> if they must be sought abroad,
might be purchased insinitely too dear.</P>
<P>He dared to assert, they might be ac∣quired
without leaving England; and that
a man naturally formed to become their dis∣ciple,
might find them in the lore of an∣cient
days, or sporting on the banks of
<PB N="105" REF="103"/>
Cam or of Isis. “Where, he observed,
should we seek the Graces, but in the
seats of their allies, the Muses?”</P>
<P>He thought Horace, not to mention
Pope, a better teacher of urbanity than the
best dancing-master Paris, or even Versailles,
could produce; and that more politeness
might be learned from the conversation of
a well-educated English woman, of fashion
and of honour, than by the strictest attend∣ance
at the <HI>ruclle</HI> of <HI>Madame la Presidente,</HI>
the highest distinction at which a travelling
Englishman, unless of the first rank, almost
ever arrives.</P>
<P>He observed, and his observation was not
the less true for having been made before,
that our <HI>boy</HI> travellers generally culled the
follies and vices of every clime, and with
the most happy dexterity contrived to leave
the national virtues of every country be∣hind.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="104"/>
“I had rather,” said he, “my son
should come ungracefully into a room,
than that he should violate all the ties
that hold society together, and wound
the bosom of domestic happiness.”</P>
<P>“But I see no occasion for either: I think
a man may be exceedingly well-bred,
without endeavouring to seduce the wife
of his friend, or even of the man by
whom he has been hospitably enter∣tained.”</P>
<P>“I think love the most likely means to
refine the heart, and soften the manners;
but I think, the more estimable the ob∣ject,
the more forcibly the means will
operate on the mind.”</P>
<P>“Of this at least I am certain, that the
worst-bred men that have fallen within
the circle of my acquaintance, have been
<PB N="107" REF="105"/>
in general the most profligate and un∣principled.”</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>THE amiable young man we have been
describing, had from almost child∣hood
regarded Louisa with a partiality which
had insensibly grown up into the most ardent
and tender affection, though from being ha∣bitual
he had never suspected it to be love.</P>
<P>When a boy, he never returned from
school without bringing his dear Louisa a
present to the utmost extent of his little
sinances.</P>
<P>The first partridges he ever shot were car∣ried
to his Louisa; his air of triumph was a
little checked by the fear of her thinking
him cruel.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="106"/>
As he grew towards man, Louisa was the
subject of his sonnets, his constant partner
in the dance.</P>
<P>In short, from twelve years old to the
present moment, he had persisted in shew∣ing
her those thousand almost unnoticed at∣tentions
which steal so imperceptibly on the
soul.</P>
<P>Louisa was much better acquainted with
the state of her own heart.</P>
<P>More retired, less amused, less distracted
by variety of objects and of pursuits, she
had leisure for reflection, and was not to
learn that she loved; but, as the dear ob∣ject
of her affection had never declared any
attachment to her beyond the bounds of
friendship, she had with the utmost care
concealed her sentiments even from her
sister, though she could not from herself.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="107"/>
Mr. Montague saw her with a delight of
which he had never asked himself the source;
but which he found so pleasing, he was
willing to indulge it at all events.</P>
<P>He would perhaps have been long before
he discovered the nature of his affection,
had not a man of such fortune, as it was
scarce to be imagined Col. Dormer would
refuse for his niece, seen her at a ball, and
declared his intention of addressing her.</P>
<P>From this moment jealousy opened his
eyes to the passion which had lain almost
unperceived in his heart; and he deter∣mined
on endeavouring immediately to ex∣plore
that of Louisa.</P>
<P>Having taken this resolution, he hastened
to Col. Dormer's, and met them at the
door, as we have already said, returning
from their airing.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="108"/>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>JOY, we have already observed, had, af∣ter
her evening's adventure at Lady
Hardy's, banished sleep from the bright eyes
of Maria.</P>
<P>We would not however wish to be lite∣rally
understood; she slept, but her slum∣bers
were short and interrupted.</P>
<P>Those broken intervals of rest h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> charms
which she had never found in the calmest
moments of perfect repose.</P>
<P>Tranquillity had bid adieu to her agi∣tated
bosom; but a more interesting, a more
<PB N="111" REF="109"/>
pleasing, guest had taken possession of the
vacant place.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile, respectful, insinuating, ten∣der,
attentive; Lord Melvile, triumphant in
all the pride of youth and manly beauty;
Lord Melvile, crowned with wreaths of
myrtle by the Graces, presented himself in∣cessantly
to her creative imagination.</P>
<P>She awaked, she regretted the fleeting
phantom; she again resigned herself to sleep,
the enchanting vision returned more lovely
than ever.</P>
<P>How delightful must these enthusiastic
slumbers have appeared to a heart like hers!
a heart formed with the quickest sensibility;
a sensibility which had never yet found its
object! a heart which recoiled at the state
of apathy and inaction in which it had hi∣therto
vegetated!</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="110"/>
She arose at nine, and prepared to ar∣range
the business of the day.</P>
<P>The first two hours were devoted to her
<HI>friseur:</HI> she had a morning visit to pay af∣terwards
to Lady Hardy; and was to be in∣troduced
in the evening by this indulgent
friend to a brilliant card party, for which
she had received an invitation at her house
the preceding night.</P>
<P>The lady by whom she was invited had
been particularly distinguished by Lord
Melvile; she had asked him to be of this
party, and he had made a bow of acknow∣ledgement
and assent.</P>
<P>She meditated during breakfast on the
events of her little life of <HI>bon ton;</HI> she
counted her winnings at play; she-read
over again all her cards of invitation; she
recollected every particular of her conver∣sation
<PB N="113" REF="111"/>
with the <HI>most lovely of mankind;</HI> and
regretted the time she had so unfortunately
lost in the country.</P>
<P>She made her morning visit to Lady
Hardy: she returned; Mons. De—ar∣rived;
she was <HI>frisée comme une ange.</HI></P>
<P>She sat down to her toilet: she studied
her dress with the minutest attention; an
attention she had never before given to this
very important business of female life.</P>
<P>She was too much in earnest not to suc∣ceed.
Lady Hardy called at seven; our
fair heroine accompanied her, more radiant
than the star of morning.</P>
<P>She entered the rooms; she mixed in the
circle who were not at play; she found al∣most
the same faces as the night before; she
did not however find the same admiration;
as she was no longer new, she attracted very
little notice.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="112"/>
She looked round with a glance of en∣quiry;
that glance of enquiry was vain;
alas! the <HI>most charming of mankind</HI> was far
away. Her cheek glowed with a blush of
wounded sensibility and disappointment.</P>
<P>She sat down to quadrille; she knew not
a card she played: her eyes were continu∣ally
turned towards the door; her heart
fluttered at the sound of every carriage
which stopped.</P>
<P>The second pool ended, she was pressed
to play on; she played, not from inclina∣tion,
but that childish, that timid flexibi∣lity,
which is the source, not only of half
the follies, but of more than half the vices,
of mankind.</P>
<P>She lost considerably: but her loss was
not the subject nearest her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="113"/>
The hours past on; she grew impatient;
she looked every moment at her watch: ten
o'clock came; no Lord Melvile appeared.</P>
<P>She found the women displeasing, the
men detestable; she was out of humour;
she had the head-ach, she had the spleen.</P>
<P>The lady of the house saw her uneasiness,
and relieved her; she arose from the table,
made an apology to Lady Hardy, and re∣tired.</P>
<P>Politeness would perhaps have advised
her waiting for her friend; but a stronger
principle of action than politeness impelled
her to quit the assembly.</P>
<P>She hurried home; she asked with eager∣ness
if any person had called; if any mes∣sage
—not a human being had been
there.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="114"/>
It was strange—she had overheard him
ask her name and address: he knew she was
to be that evening at Mrs. M—'s; he
had been asked; he had appeared to accept
the invitation.</P>
<P>He might at least have sent to enquire
after her health.</P>
<P>Could he love her, and not endeavour to
see her? She had not had a doubt of meet∣ing
him at Mrs. M—'s.</P>
<P>She sat down to supper; her chicken was
ill drest, it was not eatable—she could not
conceive how Mrs. Merrick could be so
mistaken. She could not taste it; she or∣dered
John to take away: she shed tears of
regret and vexation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>WE should little amuse the Reader in
going through the uninteresting de∣tail
of half a dozen more such parties;
where the blooming Maria suffered the mar∣tyrdom
of mixing with people, for whose
society (if society is a name to be given to
this species of intercourse) she had not the
smallest taste; and of passing her whole time
at the card table, though play was the thing
on earth she most detested.</P>
<P>She suffered this too without any event to
enliven and vary the scene; without any
change of situation, except a very sensible
and alarming diminution of her finances;
and without so much as hearing the name
of the man, in the dear hope of seeing
whom she had made these engagements.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="116"/>
After about a fortnight spent in this
amiable, this very interesting style of life;
a style of life so congenial to the feelings of
her soul; so admirably adapted to youth,
beauty, and sensibility; she was proceeding
to determine, in a fit of disgust, to leave
London immediately, and return to the
bosom of domestic happiness, when Lady
Hardy came in, and, observing her cha∣grin,
asked her to go with her that evening
to the opera.</P>
<P>“There, my dear,” said she, “you will
hear Rauzzini in a new opera of Sac∣chini;
there you will see the brilliant
Baccelli. It is, I am told, a divine opera;
it is the second night; it is Saturday; <HI>all
the world will be there.</HI>”</P>
<P>“And there, my dear,” added she with
a significant glance, “you will be certain
of seeing Lord Melvile, who is languish∣ing
<PB N="119" REF="117"/>
for an opportunity of telling you to
what a degree you have charmed him.”</P>
<P>A stroke of electricity could not have
had a more instantaneous effect than this
last sentence.</P>
<P>Maria's gloom was dissipated; her eyes
re-assumed their fire, and London all its
powers of pleasing.</P>
<P>“But I thought, my dear Madam, your
ladyship had been engaged this evening
on a charitable party, to play loo with a
sick friend.”</P>
<P>“Yes, child, but the party is broke; my
sick friend, who was turned of fourscore,
has done the most impertinent impolite
thing in the world, she chose to die last
night, sitting up in her bed, in a fit of
coughing, with a flush of trumps in her
hand.”</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="118"/>
“They say, but I don't believe a syllable
of the story, that there were three Pams
found, after her death, under her pil∣low.”</P>
<P>Maria looked astonished; and Lady
Hardy proceeded.</P>
<P>“She has used that young Ensign ex∣tremely
ill: she promised, in my hearing,
to provide liberally for him in her will;
and I find she has not left him a shilling.”</P>
<P>“I hear she has settled annuities on all
her dogs except Julio (who had dis∣obliged
her by taking notice of a little
citizen's wife in the park), and that she
has left her chambermaid executrix.”</P>
<P>“There is no accounting for the caprices
of old women: for my part, I think Ju∣lio,
except the Ensign, the only support∣able
being in her house.”</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="119"/>
“The dear little creature! a true Bolog∣nese!
such eyes! and so much the air of
a dog of quality!”</P>
<P>“I will allow that a citizen's wife is not
a proper acquaintance for the dog, and
the favourite dog too, of a woman of
fashion; but his motive was pardonable,
for this citizen's wife had been his first
protectress, and had brought him to Eng∣land.”</P>
<P>“But I must leave you, my dear Miss
Villiers: I have only just time to dress
and dine. Remember to put on all your
charms.”</P>
<P>Maria had not perfectly understood that
part of the conversation which related to
Mrs. T—.</P>
<P>She saw no great harm in her being in∣nocently
amused at fourscore; on the con∣trary,
<PB N="122" REF="120"/>
she thought fourscore the age at
which amusement was particularly neces∣sary;
and what amusement more innocent
than cards with a few chosen friends?</P>
<P>What surprized her most was Lady
Hardy's contemptuous manner of speaking
to-day, of that very friend for whom she
had heard her express the warmest affection
last night.</P>
<P>That friend too just expired; a circum∣stance
which should rather have silenced the
voice of disapprobation.</P>
<P>She disbelieved the anecdote of the three
Pams; admired (though she was sorry for
little Julio) Mrs. T—'s diffusive huma∣nity,
which extended even to her canine de∣pendants;
but execrated her unjust severity
to her grandson, for such she very naturally
concluded the neglected Ensign to be.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>IT may appear extraordinary, that Maria
had been a month in town without hav∣ing
been once at the Opera.</P>
<P>It was much more so, considering one
part of her plan, that she had never been
at the other theatres; but she was entirely
under the guidance of Lady Hardy; and
the ladies of <HI>a certain set</HI> look on going to
public places as so much time lost from the
important business of the card-table.</P>
<P>Nor was it now Montezuma, though <HI>all
the world was to be there,</HI> which drew this
accomplished dowager to the Opera.</P>
<P>The little accident of her dear friend's
decease had broke the loo party, when it
was unfortunately too late to make another;
and the approaching evening was a burden
she knew no other way to get rid of.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="122"/>
She might indeed have gone to the Play;
but—good heavens! the Play on an Opera
night—not a creature there whose name one
has even heard—she had besides not the
least interest with Johnson.</P>
<P>The Opera was therefore her <HI>pis aller.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>THEY went early, and seated them∣selves
between the two centre pillars
in the pit.</P>
<P>Lady Hardy amused her young friend
till the Opera began, with telling her the
names of all the company as they came in.</P>
<P>The overture was played, and the cur∣tain
drew up; the opera advanced; Rauz∣zini
<PB N="125" REF="123"/>
appeared; he sung an air; our heroine
was enchanted.</P>
<P>Maria adored music; the first passion of
her heart was the theatre: she had never
heard Italian music but at her own harpsi∣chord;
she had never seen any theatrical
representation but in a country town.</P>
<P>My reader will therefore imagine her
transport: she gave attention still as night
to the whole.</P>
<P>The music (worthy of Sacchini); the
voice, the taste, the blooming youth, the
animated action, of Rauzzini; the beauty
of the theatre; the splendor of the decora∣tions;
the force, the execution, of the
brilliant Baccelli; the grace of Vallony;
and let me add, what is not the least orna∣ment
of an opera, the striking <HI>coup d'oeil</HI> of
the assembled audience; an audience which
the world cannot parallel, composed of all
<PB N="126" REF="124"/>
that is great and lovely in the kingdom;
struck her young mind with an extasy al∣most
too great for words.</P>
<P>Absorbed in pleasure, she did all but
<HI>forget</HI> Lord Melvile.</P>
<P>Just at the moment when Rauzzini, ex∣piring
in Montezuma, shews himself not
less an actor than he is an accomplished
singer; at the moment when her whole soul
was employed in admiration; the god of
her idolatry appeared in Fop's alley, lean∣ing
carelessly, with an air of the most philo∣sophic
indifference, but in an attitude of
infinite grace, against the corner box, with
his friend, Sir Charles Watson, on his left
hand.</P>
<P>He was to-night drest with the most criti∣cal
elegance: his cloaths were from France,
and in the <HI>buon gusto</HI> of Versailles; his <HI>che∣veux
flottant</HI> rivaled in studied negligence
<PB N="127" REF="125"/>
the waving tresses of Fierville, or of Vestris
himself.</P>
<P>Lady Hardy interrupted our heroine's
attention to the hero of the drama, by whis∣pering
softly in her ear the still more in∣teresting
name of Lord Melvile.</P>
<P>She turned her head quick, she saw him,
she blushed, her foolish heart fluttered; the
opera was in its turn forgotten; his eyes
met hers, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> observed her confusion, he
enjoyed his triumph; inspired by coquetry,
not less the weakness of one sex than of the
other, he came forward into the pit; after
some efforts, he reached the seat on which
she sat; he addressed her with the most sub∣missive,
the most persuasive, air; his eyes
assumed that insinuating, that deceitful soft∣ness,
which had already misled her inexpe∣rienced
heart.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="126"/>
He said ten thousand flattering things,
which she too easily believed; he begged
permission to visit her, which she had not
resolution to refuse; he engaged himself to
meet her the next night at Lady Hardy's.</P>
<P>He returned to his friend: they retired
together to the coffee-room, where the fol∣lowing
conversation took place.</P>
<P>“<HI>A propos,</HI> Melvile, who is that im∣mense
fine girl to whom you was talking
just now in the pit?”</P>
<P>“The very woman, Charles, of whom
I was speaking to you last night. Don't
you think her lovely?”</P>
<P>“Lovely? she is enchanting—will you
introduce me?”</P>
<P>“With pleasure! I love to communicate
happiness.”</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="127"/>
“But when?—how!—to-night—now
—this very instant—as they go out.”</P>
<P>“A little patience, my good friend; to∣morrow
night you shall see her at Hardy's.
This good lady keeps Sunday; and your
acquaintance, as you are the <HI>ton,</HI> will be
an acquisition of which she will be proud,
and for which I shall receive her thanks.”</P>
<P>“I may depend on you?”</P>
<P>“Do you doubt my honour? She may
be worth <HI>your</HI> attention, as you are at
present unemployed.”</P>
<P>“But pray? I want the <HI>carte du pais.</HI>
This divine girl? is she kind?”</P>
<P>“I should think not: though her man∣ner
is a little equivocal. She is at least,
you see, <HI>en bon train.</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="128"/>
“She is in good hands certainly. But
to be plain; you have no designs there
yourself? for I would by no means in∣terfere.”</P>
<P>“None, upon my word; though I think
her angelic, and her behaviour to me has
not been discouraging: but I have too
much on my hands already.”</P>
<P>“Who, and what, is she? I never saw
her before. Is she of fashion? she has
that air.”</P>
<P>“All I know of her, I learnt from Hardy's
<HI>maitre d'hotel,</HI> of whom I enquired. She
is just come from the country, is alone in
a lodging, and her name is Villiers. This
is all the fellow himself ever heard about
her. You know Hardy is not very scru∣pulous
in her acquaintance, nor indeed
has she a right to be so.”</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="129"/>
“Alone in lodgings? That circumstance
is promising: she is certainly nobody:
therefore one may hazard breaking
through forms.”</P>
<P>“O fear nothing, Charles: the conquest
will not be difficult.”</P>
<P>“You know I am naturally timid with
women.”</P>
<P>“Your timidity here would be absurd,
She seems to me a little adventurer, who
is looking out for men of a certain rank:
I know not with what design, nor is it
material. You will best learn her views
from herself: perhaps they may differ
from yours, but you will probably bring
her to reason.”</P>
<P>In these terms of respect, esteem, and ten∣der
veneration, did <HI>the most amiable of man∣kind</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="130"/>
speak of a woman, who thought <HI>him</HI>
all but a divinity, and who amused herself
with the idea of their hearts having been
formed for each other.</P>
<P>Yet let us be candid: Lord Melvile
might in some degree stand excused.</P>
<P>The impropriety of her unprotected situa∣tion,
and her apparent intimacy with a wo∣man
of Lady Hardy's very equivocal cha∣racter,
were sufficient pleas to justify suspi∣cion.</P>
<P>Had he only silently doubted her conduct,
we would have forgiven him; but the very
unfeeling manner in which he endeavoured
to awaken those doubts in the mind of an∣other,
was equally mean, unjust, and un∣manly.</P>
<P>Nor was he less culpable in attempting
to ensnare her into an inclination which
<PB N="133" REF="131"/>
promised to make her unhappy, and which
could afford no advantage to himself, situ∣ated
as he was, but the gratification of a
contemptible selfish vanity, the lowest of
all human passions.</P>
<P>After encountering some little difficulties
in getting to their coach, the ladies drove
to Miss Villiers's lodgings, where they
supped together.</P>
<P>A new world had opened on the mind of
Maria. How different was this evening from
those spent at cards, with the society in
which she had lived the last fortnight!</P>
<P>She was enchanted with the entertain∣ment,
and not less with the audience.</P>
<P>With all her partiality for Lord Melvile,
she could not avoid observing, that though
he really looked much handsomer this even∣ing
than when she had first seen him, yet
<PB N="134" REF="132"/>
that the striking air of easy dignity, which
had so particularly charmed her, was not,
as at Lady Hardy's, solely appropriated to
his Lordship.</P>
<P>He had there appeared a being of a su∣perior
order; he was here only an elegant
man of fashion amongst his equals.</P>
<P>He retained the same air of distinction,
the same graces of deportment; but he
shared these advantages with a thousand
others; whereas at Lady Hardy's they were
peculiar to himself.</P>
<P>She <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elt also, but she felt it without envy,
of which not an atom entered into her com∣position,
that she was not the only handsome
woman in London.</P>
<P>Lady Hardy to-night, by the whole tenor
of her conversation, endeavoured to fan into
a flame that spark of inclination which
<PB N="135" REF="133"/>
Maria, who was sincerity itself, had con∣fessed
for Lord Melvile: an attempt in
which she succeeded but too well.</P>
<P>She did this with no more important
view than that of bringing a man of his
rank oftener to her house; as she was a
little ashamed, and not without reason, of
the general style of her male visitants.</P>
<P>As to the cruelty of sacrificing the peace,
and perhaps the honour, of a young, inno∣cent,
unsuspecting woman, who regarded
her as her guide and protectress, to so very
trifling an interest of her own, it weighed
little with her: she was a woman of the
world, and consequently above the weak∣ness
of feeling for any thing but herself.</P>
<P>Had she been questioned on this point,
she would have said coolly, “'Tis her

<P>ON Lord Melvile's return from the ope∣ra,
he found a message inviting him
to breakfast with his father the next morn∣ing.</P>
<P>He went at ten; and found his Lordship,
in an elegant <HI>dishabille,</HI> reclining on a
sopha, reading a political pamphlet, with a
dish of chocolate in his hand.</P>
<P>“Good morrow, Melvile: you looked
like an Adonis last night at the opera: I
never saw you so well drest.”</P>
<P>“Your Lordship is partial—I really
thought I looked ill.”</P>
<P>“You are mistaken. There was in your
whole air and manner a well-fancied <HI>non∣chalance,</HI>
which could not fail of its effect.
<PB N="137" REF="135"/>
Your second attitude in Fop's alley was
enchanting.”</P>
<P>“O, my Lord, you flatter.”</P>
<P>“No, indeed—the women were all of
my opinion.”</P>
<P>“But to business.—I believe, Melvile, I
shall marry you in about six weeks.”</P>
<P>“As you please, my Lord; you know I
never interfere in family affairs.”</P>
<P>“And in those of the heart, you will do
me the justice to own, I never take upon
me to dictate.”</P>
<P>“But to our marriage.—The lady I think
of is the only daughter of a Nabob, who
is just returned from making the tour of
Europe with his family.”</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="136"/>
“The fellow, to be sure, is a scoundrel;
but no matter. He has offered us eighty
thousand pounds down; a handsome sum,
for which we have great present occasion.”</P>
<P>“You know the mortgage is large; I
want to build a house in Mansfield-street:
and you, I fancy, can dispense with a
little ready money.”</P>
<P>“Why, certainly, my Lord—at my time
of life, you know—”</P>
<P>“I understand you; and will comply
with every thing reasonable.”</P>
<P>“But pray, Melvile, what do you intend
to do with Dorignon? She must positively
abdicate.”</P>
<P>“I should be glad to make some provi∣sion
for her, and to get rid of her with∣out
<PB N="139" REF="137"/>
noise: but I intend to leave that to
your Lordship's management.”</P>
<P>“You will do well. I have a West In∣dian
in my eye for her, who is worth her
attention; and have planned an excursion
of ten days to my house in Yorkshire,
where I hope to settle the arrangement.”</P>
<P>“I would have you go with us, stay one
day; contrive to quarrel with her, which
is not difficult; pique her vanity, which
will naturally put her on conquetting with
our West Indian; pretend business, come
to town, leave them both behind, and the
rest will follow of course.”</P>
<P>Some company arriving, put an end to
the visit.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile returned home, to think of
his marriage, settle the sum necessary to
pay his debts, dine with Dorignon, and
<PB N="140" REF="138"/>
prepare to introduce his friend, Sir Charles
Watson, at Lady Hardy's assembly in the

<P>THE unbounded complaisance of that
inconsistent monarch Charles the Se∣cond
to the prejudices of his good friends
the Dissenters (prejudices which were how∣ever
the constant objects of his ridicule),
having shut the door on all rational and in∣nocent
amusements on a day evidently in∣tended
by the beneficent Lord of all, not
only as a day of public worship, but of re∣laxation
from care and labour; a London
Sunday is generally passed by people of
fashion at cards—by the better sort of mer∣cantile
inhabitants in parties out of town—
and by the lower class, consisting princi∣pally
<PB N="141" REF="139"/>
of mechanics and young apprentices,
either in absolute sotting at clubs of choice
spirits, or in cultivating an acquaintance
with ladies <HI>of the town,</HI> and gentlemen <HI>of

let us return to our heroine, and to the <HI>con∣versazione</HI>

from a caprice for which we cannot ac∣count,
never suffered play on a Sunday,

<P>A <HI>Conversazione</HI> without cards, being in
England, and perhaps every where
else, if the company is numerous, the dull∣est
of all possible things, and the least pro∣ductive
of conversation; it is usual for those
ladies who do not play on Sundays, to run
incessantly from one house to another; by
which means they are themselves at least
amused with the sight of different faces;
and the rooms through which they pass in
perpetual review, by presenting a constantly
moving picture, are rendered less melan∣choly
than they would appear if composed
of the same unvarying circle of half-ani∣mated,
and almost vegetative, beings.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock, the tide of company
at Lady Hardy's being at the highest, Lord
Melvile, and his friend Sir Charles Watson,
entered the rooms.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="141"/>
After introducing his friend to the lady
of the house, Lord Melvile advanced alone
to the place where Maria, whose cheek was
suffused with the blush of pleasure at his
sight, sat impatiently expecting his arrival.</P>
<P>He approached her with the most respect∣ful
air, assumed a look of the most insinu∣ating
tenderness; said little, but with that
irresolute tone of voice, that seeming timi∣dity,
so exactly resembling love, and so dan∣gerous
to women who do not know the
world.</P>
<P>His coquetry redoubled at Sir Charles's
approach; he even thought her more lovely
on seeing her so much the admiration of
another.</P>
<P>He entreated permission to visit her, which
he obtained; he asked the same permission
for his friend, which she declined granting,
<PB N="144" REF="142"/>
meerly for the pleasure of marking more
strongly the preference she gave him to all
the rest of his sex.</P>
<P>His eyes sparkled with the joy of con∣quest,
and of triumph over Sir Charles;
which was not unobserved by the latter,
who redoubled his assiduity, but without
the least effect; and at length, piqued at
his ill success, left the field in possession of
his rival.</P>
<P>Inebriated with gratified vanity, Lord
Melvile staid very late, and left Maria fully
convinced of the reality of her conquest.</P>
<P>She returned home, in the greatest har∣mony
of temper imaginable; she asked Mrs.
Merrick a thousand questions about her fa∣mily
and affairs; promised her <HI>her</HI> protec∣tion,
with the most condescending goodness;
destined her eldest son, then at Paris, for my
Lord's valet de chambre; thought of her
<PB N="145" REF="143"/>
daughter for her own woman; and, in short,
considered every light in which Lady Mel∣vile
could be useful to this worthy creature;
and anticipated, with delight, her future
power of exercising the native beneficence
of her heart.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Melvile, who felt himself uneasy
and constrained in the presence of Do∣rignon,
from the consciousness of his inten∣tion
to part with her, and of the plan laid to
make her engage in another connexion, and
whose vanity was agreeably flattered by the
artless attention, and very obvious partiality,
of the young, the lovely, the unaffected,
the innocent, Maria, paid a visit to the
latter on Monday, in his way to Cavendish∣square,
where he was to dine with Lord
Claremont, and settle the preparations for
<PB N="146" REF="144"/>
their journey into Yorkshire, which was to
take place the next morning.</P>
<P>He found her laone, he made a long visit,
he led her to talk more, and on a greater
variety of subjects, than she had had an op∣portunity
of doing at Lady Hardy's.</P>
<P>The pleasure of seeing him, and the lively
desire of fixing a heart on the possession of
which she felt her own happiness depended,
called forth all her native vivacity, and gave
new graces to an understanding naturally
strong, and improved and polished by the
cares of her excellent uncle Col. Dormer.</P>
<P>He found the charms of her mind not less
attractive than those of her form; and, if he
had possessed a heart, it would have been
undoubtedly in the greatest possible danger.</P>
<P>He was however safe: the dissipated life
to which he had been long accustomed, the
<PB N="147" REF="145"/>
false principles he had imbibed in the course
of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very ill-directed education, and his
early connexions with the most abandoned
of the other sex, which naturally gave him
unfavourable ideas of the best, had de∣stroyed
all the finer feelings of his soul, and
rendered him almost a Stoic to every species
of beauty.</P>
<P>Charming as Maria was, and pleasing as
he found her conversation, she amused and
flattered, without interesting, him.</P>
<P>He felt infinitely more pleasure in the
idea of triumphing over his friend Sir
Charles, than in that of being beloved by
a woman whom he thought of all women
most lovely.</P>
<P>Dead to the genuine transports of love
and delicate friendship, incapable of the
tender ties of affection, of those endearing
relations which strew the thorny paths of
<PB N="148" REF="146"/>
life with unfading roses, vanity was the
only sentiment of which he really felt the
empire; and Dorignon herself had only
held him by that imperious caprice, those
well-dissembled variations of temper and of
character, of which women of her wretched
profession know the effect, and which, by
keeping the mind in continual agitation, the
passions in perpetual play, prevent their
subsiding into that torpid calm which is the
mortal, the incurable, disease of inclina∣tion.</P>
<P>He left the unexperienced Maria fully
persuaded of his tenderness: he had looked
passionately, talked incoherently, and dur∣ing
the whole visit had addressed her in that
equivocal style which self-love, especially
when attended by ignorance of the world,
never fails to interpret to its own advantage.</P>
<P>He had vowed there was enchantment in
her form, in her conversation, in her smile,
<PB N="149" REF="147"/>
which it was not in man to resist; had left
the room three times with well-dissembled
reluctance, and had returned as often to
bid her <HI>once more</HI> adieu.</P>
<P>She had not the remotest doubt of his in∣tention
to marry her: a mind like his must
be incapable of any views, but such as were
dictated by the most perfect honour.</P>
<P>She fondly imagined the journey he was
going to take with his father had been con∣certed
by himself, in order to secure a fa∣vourable
opportunity of confessing a passion
which her birth and connexions (we mean
her <HI>family</HI> connexions) gave Lord Clare∣mont
no pretence to disapprove.</P>
<P>She therefore depended on his Lordship's
acquiescence; for as to fortune, she thought
that a consideration infinitely below the at∣tention
of a man of his elevated rank.

Hope and joy at present-filled all her
soul; her heart, devoted to Lord Melvile,
supposed Lord Melvile existed only for
her.</P>
<P>Alas! how fatally was she deceived! Her
beauty had indeed made some impression on
his senses; but it was an impression as light,
and as easily effaced, as the flying footstep
on the falling snow.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>ON Tuesday morning the fourteenth of
February, Lord Claremont and Lord
Melvile in one chaise, the West Indian and
Mademoiselle Dorignon in another, set out,
<HI>with a grand retinus,</HI> for the seat of the for∣mer
in Yorkshire.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="151"/>
Their journey was attended with no re∣markable
circumstance, except a kind of
half revival of Lord Melvile's passion for
Dorignon.</P>
<P>As this foreign fair had two points in
view, one of which it was absolutely neces∣sary
she should carry, to revive the expiring
fires of an old lover, and fan the just be∣ginning
flame in the heart of a new one, she
played off the whole artillery of her charms
on the road: she was more sprightly, more
<HI>eveillé,</HI> more enchantingly capricious, than
ever; and, far from being in danger of fail∣ing
in her two grand designs, seemed almost
certain of succeeding in both.</P>
<P>She was, it must be confessed, uncom∣monly
amusing; but this was not all: such
is the folly of the human heart, that we are
apt to value whatever we seem in danger of
Iosing; and Lord Melvile was unable to
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>
bear the idea of another's possessing the af∣fection
of the woman whom he himself had
the day before been so eagerly anxious to
get rid of.</P>
<P>Her being in the chaise with the West
Indian gave him a thousand pangs, and it
was with difficulty he restrained himself
from desiring an exchange, a proposition
which he knew his father, who had a great
deal to say to him, would not easily have
forgiven.</P>
<P>We will leave our travellers to pursue
their journey, to be met some miles from the
village by the tenants, to be conducted by
these faithful vassals to the mansion-house
of this once adored family; to that mansion
heretofore the seat of elegant hospitality
and convivial pleasure; that mansion to
which in better days Lady Claremont, the
lovely, the amiable mother of Lord Mel∣vile,
had led the Virtues, the Muses, and
the Graces.</P>

<P>POOR Maria! This journey was a
stroke she did not expect. How give
wings to the lazy-footed time? How pass
the tedious hours of Lord Melvile's absence
from London?</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="155"/>
Lady Hardy came in, laughed at her gra∣vity,
and, though with great difficulty, se∣duced
her to a card party: she lost fifty
guineas at loo, found the company detesta∣ble,
and came home determined to play no
more; her little exchequer was wasting
away, and she was in danger of being dis∣trest
before her great plan was accom∣plished;
a plan in which her heart was now
interested, though vanity had been its pri∣meval
source.</P>
<P>She could indeed have applied to the ma∣nagers
of one of the theatres, in respect to
the tragedy she had brought with her to
town; but rather wished, unless her affairs
should oblige her to precipitate her mea∣sures,
to wait till she was Lady Melvile be∣fore
she allowed it to be represented; as the
performance of a woman of quality would
naturally attract general attention, and ap∣pear
with double eclat.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="156"/>
If this event, of which she, had little
doubt, should take place, it was her deter∣mination
to give the profits of her play to
a public charity; a circumstance which
would alone, she was convinced, secure its
reception; especially with the acting mana∣ger
of Drury-Lane, of whose extensive be∣nevolence;
and disinterested protection of the
drooping Muses, she had read, with tears of
undissembled pleasure, a very warm and
elaborate encomium in that impartial vehi∣cle
of truth and candour, the Morning-Post.</P>
<P>All concern for her loss at cards being
absorbed in these agreeable reflections, she
took out a pencil, and drew a sketch of a
dress for the heroine of her play.</P>
<P>This important affair finished, she resigned
herself to the God of slumbers, who, to
sooth her soul to peace, twined myrtle and
<PB N="158" REF="157"/>
laurel with his poppies: in other words,
she dreamed of Lord Melvile, and her tra∣gedy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>MARIA'S latent passion for the theatre
being, by this train of thinking,
awakened, she determined on going to see
the new tragedy of Braganza, which was
announced for the following day; and to
which, as it was the <HI>ton,</HI> Lady Hardy had
promised to accompany her.</P>
<P>Whilst she was at breakfast therefore she
sent John to Drury-Lane to take a box;
or, if that could not be had, places, for the
new tragedy.</P>
<P>John returned, with this answer, that
every part of the house was taken, and not
<PB N="159" REF="158"/>
a single place to be had for Braganza till
the thirtieth night.</P>
<P>Great as her disappointment was, she
could not help feeling infinite pleasure at
such a proof of the taste of the present age
for dramatic entertainments of superior
merit.</P>
<P>She anticipated her own success in that of
this estimable author; and congratulated
herself on the happiness of having written
for the theatre at a time when it was so evi∣dently
the interest of the managers to take
new pieces, since this tragedy had already
ensured them thirty full houses.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="160" REF="159"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>JUST at the moment of John's return,
Lady Hardy entered the room; she
heard his message, and Maria's reflection,
with a smile.</P>
<P>“My dear,” said she, “you know no∣thing
of these affairs; the house being
engaged for thirty nights is a jest, as
there are not so many nights during the
season on which it is possible this tragedy
can be played▪ but there are a set of
people, favourites of the housekeeper,
many of them people whom nobody
knows, who are to be served first; and
till they have determined on what nights
to go, no other person can be admitted:
you will perhaps imagine this preference
is given to rank and consequence; not at
all: I have known a countess refused a
<PB N="161" REF="160"/>
box, which has been given to the wife of
her linendraper.”</P>
<P>“You look incredulous, my dear: I
will convince and oblige you at the same
time: I have a friend who is on the fa∣vourite
list, she shall send for a box for
to-morrow night, and we will be of her
party: give me pen, ink, and paper, this
moment.”</P>
<P>“La Rose, step to Mrs. H—, and
bring an answer to this note.”</P>
<P>La Rose returned with Mrs. H—'s
compliments, that her ladyship might de∣pend
on a box for Braganza the next night,
or any other she chose.</P>
<P>“You must know, my dear,” pursued
Lady Hardy, “that this incomprehensible
conduct of the managers is one reason
why people of fashion have, in some de∣gree,
<PB N="162" REF="161"/>
deserted the play houses, and de∣voted
so many of their evenings to cards:
my good friend Pam has infinite obliga∣tions
to the politicks of Drury-Lane.”</P>
<P>“But, my dear Miss Villiers, I have
something much more important to say to
you: you are young and inexperienced,
and want the advice of a sincere friend
like me: you are playing a losing game,
with every winning card in your hand.”</P>
<P>“You expect to fix Lord Melvile (for I
am no stranger to your most secret views)
by waiting at home in solitude for his vi∣sits.
Nothing can be so absurd, believe
me, as this conduct: if you wish to attract
the attention of a man of fashion, it must
be by becoming a fashionable woman.”</P>
<P>“You are in a road where you promise
to go far, if you do not unfortunately
mistake your way.”</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="162"/>
“You have youth, beauty, politeness,
understanding; and, wherever you ac∣quired
it, an air of the world: you have
every personal requisite to make an <HI>eclat,</HI>
but you want that exterior splendor which
alone can set your perfections in full day.”</P>
<P>“If you wish to carry your point, you
must have a house, servants, carriage,
and a thousand other necessary <HI>et ceteras,</HI>
without which you will ever be regarded
as one whom nobody knows, and be ad∣mitted
into good company by a kind of
courtesy which is exceedingly humili∣ating.”</P>
<P>“Your poor old John, with his sank
grey locks, and antique civility, trotting
before a hackney chair, is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight more
ridiculous than you, who know little of
this town, can imagine.”</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="163"/>
“Let me send you my coach-maker to∣morrow;
I will find you a ready-furnished
house, and a footman with the true inso∣lence
of a domestick of condition. Pur∣sue
this plan, give cards and suppers; be
at every fashionable place of amusement,
drest with the most studied elegance,
draw a crowd of men about you, be
talked of all over the town as a new
beauty, and in less than six weeks I shall
see Lady Melvile's carriage at my door.”</P>
<P>Ideas so consonant to Maria's wishes,
could not fail of being attended to with de∣light:
she forgot the state of her almost ex∣hausted
finances, and consented to all Lady
Hardy proposed: after a moment's reflec∣tion,
she objected to taking a house, as she
was determined on no account to leave Mrs.
Merrick; she agreed, without hesitation,
to take a more fashionable footman, but
without parting from her faithful John, and
to hire a chariot by the month.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="164"/>
She was particularly anxious to make
this new arrangement before Lord Melvile
returned from the country: Lady Hardy
undertook the whole; and it was agreed be∣tween
them, that her carriage and new foot∣man
should attend her the Saturday morn∣ing
following.</P>
<P>Behold her then on the eve of appear∣ing,
besides an apartment at three guineas
a week, with a carriage and two footmen,
on an income of less than an hundred
pounds a year.</P>
<P>Perfect madness!—I readily grant it, and
it would be happy for society, if this mad∣ness
was confined to the young, the inex∣perienced,
the sanguine, bosom of our he∣roine;
whose reliance, however ill founded,
on Lord Melvile's honourable passion was
such, that she thought a month the longest
time this imprudent expence could conti∣nue;
<PB N="166" REF="165"/>
nay, she determined it should be the
longest, and resolved absolutely to leave
London the latter end of March, if she was
not before that time Lady Melvile.</P>
<P>She also considered that, if necessary, she
had a considerable sum in bank in her port∣manteau:
she estimated her epic poem at
100<HI>l.,</HI> her novel at 200<HI>l.,</HI> and her play,
including the copy, at 500<HI>l.;</HI> on the whole
800<HI>l.:</HI> a sum, in the aggregate, to which
the little additional expences she was going
to incur bore no manner of proportion.</P>
<P>She had some little debts to milliners,
hairdressers, &amp;c. but they were trifles; she
had money remaining in her bureau; into
the precise sum she had not had the courage
to scrutinize.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>SHE rose next morning to prepare for
Braganza: she was to be in a stage∣box,
and therefore her friend had advised
her to give great attention to her dress.</P>
<P>It was of importance that she should
strike; she had been only seen at a few card
parties, where beauty is of all qualities the
most useless, and the least regarded.</P>
<P>This exhibition of her figure might, with
great propriety, be called <HI>her second appear∣ance
in public:</HI> she had been once at the
opera, but she had been at no other place
of amusement.</P>
<P>She was impatient for six o'clock; six
o'clock came; Lady Hardy called for her;
they joined their party in the stage-box of
Drury-Lane.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="167"/>
Maria was absorbed in expectation; she
forgot herself; she thought of nothing but
the entertainment she was going to receive.</P>
<P>She had heard much of the tragedy which
was to be performed; she had heard still
more of the admirable actress who was to
play the principal character.</P>
<P>Whilst the other ladies of the party were
laughing, talking, whispering, and looking
round with their glasses to reconnoitre their
acquaintance in the boxes, Maria was ea∣gerly
listening to the play.</P>
<P>The first act passed, the second began:
the hero and heroine of the piece had not
yet appeared; Maria expected them with
the warmest impatience.</P>
<P>The beautiful description of the tri∣umphant
entry of the royal pair, a descrip∣tion
<PB N="169" REF="168"/>
adorned with all the flowery charms of
diction, raised her ideas of the bright
Louisa very high; nor were those ideas in
the least degree disappointed: she found
descriptive colouring, in this instance, ri∣valed
by truth.</P>
<P>The bright Louisa of the theatre ap∣peared;
she came forward.</P>
<P>The beauty of her form, the easy ma∣jesty
of her deportment, secured Maria's
partiality before she spoke;</P>
<P>“Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye;
In every gesture dignity and love.”</P>
<P>The play proceeded, the heroic dutchess
of Braganza strove to awaken the latent

She found her judgement satisfied, but
her heart was still unmoved: the author's
thoughts were bold, sublime, and some∣times
uncommon: his style was manly,
nervous, poetic; but the whole was hitherto
unimpassioned.</P>
<P>She felt the strongest degree of approba∣tion,
but she felt no more; she was pleased▪
but not enraptured.</P>
<P>The part of Louisa was fine writing, de∣livered
indeed with all the graces of which
meer poetry is susceptible; but it was still
only fine writing: the tragedy and the
actress excited her admiration; but even
the highest degree of admiration alone is a
sentiment too cold to fill a mind awakened
and ardent like that of Maria.</P>
<P>The last scene arrived; the distress rose;
the great actress, whom Maria had so eagerly
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
expected, pierced the veil which the languid
power of declamation had thrown round
her; she burst forth in a blaze which ar∣roused
every dormant spark of sensibility,
even in the most inattentive of her auditors.</P>
<P>Filled with the noblest enthusiasm, the di∣vine
fire of genius, she appeared almost more
than mortal.</P>
<P>It was Louisa herself, the indignant
queen, the tender wife, the steady heroine,
the generous victim to the happiness of her
people.</P>
<P>Her voice, her look, her attitude—the
whole <HI>tableau</HI> was striking beyond descrip∣tion.</P>
<P>But you must have heard her, grasping
the tyrant's arm, pronounce,
<Q>“Feel! do I shrink, or tremble?”</Q>
to form any adequate idea of the excellence
of her performance.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173"/>
Every heart was chilled with terror, re∣spiration
was suspended through the whole
house; the dagger seemed pointed at each
particular bosom, and the shout of exulta∣tion
on her breaking from the traitor (whose
part was admirably sustained) almost spoke
the danger real.</P>
<P>The beautiful, the expressive, the pic∣turesque,
change of her countenance, on
finding herself in safety with her Juan, calls
for the vivid pencil of Raphael himself.</P>
<P>Maria was satisfied; her warmest ideas of
theatrical perfection were realized; she was
on fire to give her tragedy to the public;
she forgot her design of waiting till she was
Lady Melvile; and resolved to send to the
Manager the next morning.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>MISS Villiers returned from the thea∣tre
happy in having found an actress
capable of filling the character of her poetic
heroine.</P>
<P>Determined not to lose a moment in her
application, she sketched half a dozen let∣ters
to the Manager; none of which pleased
her, though they would perhaps have satis∣fied
the most critical judges.</P>
<P>On reflection she thought a personal ap∣plication
would be best, and therefore threw
her letters into the fire.</P>
<P>One only difficulty remained, that of
finding some respectable man of learning;
for a man of learning she determined it
should be, who could with propriety intro∣duce
her to the acting manager.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175"/>
As she was now absolutely resolved to
have her tragedy performed immediately,
she was under no concern about her finances.</P>
<P>She looked on her expected third-nights
as a bank already established, on which she
might almost venture to draw at sight.</P>
<P>Perfectly easy therefore on this very
important point, she took courage to count
the remains of her exchequer, which to her
astonishment amounted to no more than
twenty-nine pounds eleven shillings.</P>
<P>Her heart recoiled, even through all her
gay dreams of future prosperity; she was
agitated, she was alarmed at her situation:
she had her frizeur, her milliner, her man∣tua-maker,
and her lodgings, to pay.</P>
<P>She was on the point of plunging into an
immoderate encrease of expence, without
any adequate income to support it.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176"/>
Too proud to submit to being in debt,
she ordered John to call in all her bills the
next morning.</P>
<P>She sat down to supper; she rose without
tasting it; she felt terrors she had never be∣fore
experienced.</P>
<P>She went to her bureau; she took out her
play, she read it once more; all her sanguine
hopes returned; she retired to bed in a
more tranquil state of mind than could have
been expected from the view of her trea∣sury.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>AS Miss Villiers was drinking her second
dish of tea in the morning, she recol∣lected
the story of Moliere's Old Woman.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="177"/>
It occurred to her that she might be mis∣taken
as to the merits of her piece; her
own judgement was least of all others to be
depended on.</P>
<P>She rang her bell, she desired Mrs. Mer∣rick
to walk up stairs.</P>
<P>After some little hesitation, she assumed
sufficient courage to trust this worthy woman
with a secret, to her of the utmost impor∣tance;
and on her earnest request to read
her tragedy.</P>
<P>She began several times, was intimidated,
and laid down the manuscript; her courage
however came by degrees, and the play re∣ceived
infinite advantage from the fine tones
of one of the most mellifluous voices in the
world.</P>
<P>Mrs. Merrick's tears, the genuine tribute
of unfeigned and native sensibility to real
<PB N="177" REF="178"/>
genius, gave Maria the purest, the most ex∣quisite
delight.</P>
<P>She communicated to her the extreme
embarrassment she was under in respect to
the manager, which she was, unexpectedly,
so fortunate as to remove.</P>
<P>One of the sublimest poets, and most ju∣dicious
critics, this enlightened age has pro∣duced,
had, it seems, lived a year in her
house before she came to Berner's-street.</P>
<P>The candor and beneficence of his mind,
his advanced time of life, his birth (for he
was of a noble family), and the extreme
respectability of his character, to which
Maria was no stranger, rendered him the
properest person on earth to consult.</P>
<P>He was the more so, as he had himself
declined writing for the theatre, and had
consequently no interest to warp his judge∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179"/>
It was therefore settled that Mrs. Merrick
should that day wait on Mr. Hammond,
the name of this amiable man; should give
him the tragedy to read, and invite him to
dine the next day with Miss Villiers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE next day came; Mr. Hammond
was announced.</P>
<P>He entered the room: Miss Villiers saw
a little man, about sixty, plainly drest, but
with a neatness which, if neatness could be
<HI>outré,</HI> would have been so. His eyes were
quick and penetrating, his countenance ex∣pressive,
and his air that of a gentleman,
and a man of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180"/>
Maria's cheeks were suffused with crimson
at his approach; she trembled; her voice
faltered; and she felt all the disadvantage of
strong sensibility and modesty united: guilt
itself could scarce have affected her more
painfully than consciousness of Mr. Ham∣mond's
having seen her tragedy.</P>
<P>Timid, bashful, fearful of having commit∣ted
an absurdity, she was afraid to meet his
eyes.</P>
<P>She might have judged too favourably of
her own production; she might be mistaken,
so might Mrs. Merrick. A thousand terrors
crowded on her imagination; she would
have given the world to have recovered her
play unread.</P>
<P>A criminal before his judge never felt
more than the blushing Maria before the
gentle, the indulgent critic, who entered the
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
room, impressed with the most lively senti∣ments
of admiration for her genius; and
who, struck with her beauty, would have
forgiven her an offence of a much deeper
dye than that of possessing talents on which
she would have had a right to pride her∣self,
if pride was a passion becoming the
state of humanity.</P>
<P>He observed her confusion, and endea∣voured
to dissipate it by the most polite at∣tention,
and by turning the conversation,
after thanking her for the pleasure she had
given him, to other subjects; till dinner re∣lieved
her from the very irksome constraint
under which she suffered.</P>
<P>It has been said, the most unpleasant in∣stant
of our lives is the quarter of an hour
before dinner is served: no person perhaps
ever experienced this more strongly than
Miss Villiers.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182"/>
Dinner was at length served, and was re∣moved:
the coffee was on the table, where
constraint had given place to mutual confi∣dence.</P>
<P>After Mr. Hammond had, by impercep∣tible
degrees, led Maria into the subject on
which his visit was founded, he addressed
her in the following terms:</P>
<P>“I have read your tragedy, young lady,
with astonishment; the fable is interes∣ting,
the conduct such as the severest
judgement must approve; the manners
painted in the most glowing colours, and
the style even luxuriantly poetical; but
what I most admire are those little strokes
of tenderness and passion which seize so
instantaneously on the heart.”</P>
<P>“You have literally a <HI>Muse of fire;</HI> and
had you lived in those happy days when
the dramatic Muse, like her enchanting
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>
sisters, trod the flowery paths of Parnassus
unfettered, you promise fair to have ri∣valed
even the great Poet of Nature.”</P>
<P>Miss Villiers blushed, her eyes sparkled
with pleasure; Mr. Hammond proceeded:</P>
<P>“But, alas! you have many difficulties to
surmount, of which you have not at pre∣sent
the remotest idea: you will perhaps
be astonished when I tell you, it requires
no small degree of interest even to get
your play read. Just this degree of inte∣rest
I believe I possess; and you may com∣mand
my utmost services.”</P>
<P>“You will then, Sir, be so obliging to
accompany me”—</P>
<P>“No, my dear madam, I will take upon
myself the disagreeable task of seeing the
manager: the delicacy of your sex and
character make it highly improper you
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
should wait, which might probably be the
case, amongst the unhappy train whom
dire necessity oblige to submit to humilia∣tions,
from which the free spirit of genius
flies with horror.”</P>
<P>“I am obliged, though with reluctance,
to leave you: in a week I will wait on
you with your tragedy, and shall be
happy if I bring you the answer you
wish.”</P>
<P>“Do not, however, be too sanguine in
your expectations; if I am not misin∣formed,
it is only by servilities, of which
I already pronounce you incapable, or by
the weight of great connexions, that access
can be had to the theatres.”</P>
<P>Maria was delighted with the first part of
this speech; the latter she looked on as the
peevishness of age, and perhaps of disap∣pointment.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="185"/>
Mr. Hammond retired; Miss Villiers com∣municated
her supposed success, a success
she now thought inevitable, to Mrs. Mer∣rick;
who was as much convinced as her∣self,
that it was impossible the manager
could refuse a tragedy of such merit, and
recommended to him by one of the greatest
geniuses of the age.</P>
<P>The character of the heroine too was so
calculated to shew all the powers of Mrs.
Yates to advantage—this alone, Maria was
clear, would ensure its reception.</P>
<P>Whatever knowledge Miss Villiers wanted,
she certainly was an adept in that of the
world, and especially the little world of the
theatre.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>ON the third day from his leaving Lon∣don,
Lord Claremont, with his son,
and his very respectable friends, reached the
seat of his glorious ancestors, a line of he∣roes
dear to their country, about ten mi∣nutes
before dinner was served.</P>
<P>We should have premised that <HI>la petite
Janneton,</HI> having business of her own to
transact, staid in town, and made no part
of this illustrious band.</P>
<P>The noble master of this superb mansion
led Dorignon through a suite of magnificent
apartments, once honoured by other guests,
and, entering the dining-room, placed her at
the head of his table, of which he desired
her to do the honours.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187"/>
Lord Melvile blushed, a spark of virtue
still remained unextinguished in his bosom;
his degenerate passions had not entirely con∣quered
the faithful monitor within; his
heart revolted to see this wretched woman
occupy the seat once filled by his noble, his
amiable, mother.</P>
<P>He ate little, he was gloomy, he was si∣lent;
the sprightly sallies of Dorignon
missed of their usual effect.</P>
<P>He looked up, the picture of Lady Clare∣mont
met his eyes; the blood rushed to his
heart, a tear of remorse started, he fancied
he saw the picture glow with indignation;
he rose from table, pretended illness, and
retired.</P>
<P>Neither Dorignon, nor Lord Claremont,
had the least idea of the cause of Lord
Melvile's emotion, though it was too ob∣vious
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
to escape the eyes of either: both
were surprized at his retiring; but, as Lord
Claremont took no notice of his absence,
Dorignon thought it prudent to observe the
same conduct.</P>
<P>No other visible cause appearing, the
convivial trio imagined his lordship's preci∣pitate
retreat arose from his jealousy of the
West Indian, who, full of the same idea,
enjoyed his supposed triumph over a rival
in every respect so much his superior.</P>
<P>The dinner, the wines, were exquisite;
the glass went round; Dorignon, convinced
she had riveted Lord Melvile's chains more
firmly than ever, displayed all the charms
of her <HI>sçavoir vivre;</HI> she was singing a
<HI>chanson à boire</HI> when a servant informed the
company that Lord Melvile had set out for
London in ten minutes after he left the
room.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="189"/>
Dorignon did not expect this stroke; it
disconcerted all her measures; she hesitated
what step to take, turned alternately red and
pale, and was on the point of proposing to
follow him, when Lord Claremont, who
chose to dissemble his surprize, told her his
son was gone to town by his order, on some
unforeseen business of great importance to
himself; but that he and Mr. Martin, the
name of her new lover, would do all in
their power to amuse her till Lord Melvile's
return, which he supposed would be in
about a week.</P>
<P>How this week was passed in Yorkshire
will hereafter appear. Let us at present
attend Lord Melvile to town.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Melvile, on leaving the dining-room,
retired to his own apartment,
his heart torn by contending passions, which
banished peace from his agitated bosom; he
despised himself for his attachment to so un∣worthy
an object as Dorignon, yet felt not
the less strongly the ascendant she had
gained over his heart.</P>
<P>He saw no alternative between submit∣ting
to resume his inglorious chains, and set∣ting
out that moment for London: his in∣clination
pointed out the first; but shame,
remorse, his respect for the memory of his
noble mother, and perhaps a mixture of
jealousy and despight, carried it for the
latter.</P>
<P>He found some difficulty in taking this
laudable resolution, and, conscious of his
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
own weakness, determined on setting out
without seeing Dorignon, and without giv∣ing
his indignation time to cool.</P>
<P>He threw himself into the chaise, and
drove from the door; he looked back, hap∣pily
for him, his Circé was not in sight.</P>
<P>The chaise drove on; Lord Melvile had
courage to persevere in advancing, though
Dorignon's idea perpetually obtruded itself
on his imagination; the charms of her form
indeed were not such as justified his infatua∣tion;
she was, in respect to personal attrac∣tions,
much below mediocrity; but her
sprightly sallies, her <HI>sçavoir vivre,</HI> her <HI>pi∣quantes
caprices;</HI> her unbounded, her liber∣tine
vivacity, unfettered by the chains of
either politeness, decency, or good-nature;
her dexterity in varying the scene from
storm to sunshine, from rage to softness;
in short, those wretched artifices to which
beauty need not, and probity will not, de∣scend,
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>
held him in a state of willing sla∣very,
from which he scarce had firmness of
mind enough to attempt getting released.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Melvile reached Grantham that
night, though very late; he sat down
and wrote to Dorignon; he upbraided, he
soothed, he upbraided again; he tore the
letter; he determined to break his chains.</P>
<P>He reflected on his life of gallantry; he
was dissatisfied; he blushed for the indeli∣cacy
of his past attachments; he deter∣mined
to renounce the pursuit of venal
beauty.</P>
<P>He wished to be beloved, to seek an affair
of the heart; he did well; refinement in
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>
vice is one step, and no inconsiderable one,
towards virtue.</P>
<P>This train of thinking naturally led him
to remember the blooming, the amiable,
the lovely, the innocent Maria, who, with
every charm of youth and beauty which the
abandoned Dorignon wanted, had the re∣commendation
of having distinguished him
from all his sex; she had convinced him of
her unaffected tenderness by endeavouring to
conceal it, and by a thousand little circum∣stances,
which, though sufficiently percepti∣ble,
are difficult to describe.</P>
<P>He therefore determined on pursuing his
conquest, and destined Miss Villiers to the
honour of being his favourite sultana, as
soon as decency, after his marriage, would
allow him to make an arrangement.</P>
<P>His heart, for a moment, revolted at the
idea of seduction; but he soon-silenced the
unwelcome monitor.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194"/>
He was born with better feelings; he was
naturally humane, tender, compassionate;
but he had, unfortunately for himself, been
educated by a father, who, as we have al∣ready
observed, had taken the most unwea∣ried
pains to eradicate from his expanding
mind those social affections which the Deity
has planted in our bosoms for the wisest
purposes.</P>
<P>By the repeated instructions of this fa∣ther,
whom he both loved and revered, he
had reasoned himself into the persuasion,
tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there exists no real principle of action
but what is merely selfish; and that the first,
indeed the only, duty of every being, is to
pursue its own particular gratification.</P>
<P>In respect to the other sex, his reverend
Mentor had assured him, that woman is as
much destined, by the Creator, the prey of
man, as the lamb of the wolf; and that
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
compunction was as little required, and
would be as contrary to the rule of right,
and the established order of nature, in the
one pursuit as in the other.</P>
<P>Allow me to observe, that immorality in the
extreme, that abandoned state of mind, in the
composition of which hardness of heart makes
a necessary ingredient, is seldom attained by
the young. Pure, unmixed, unfeeling de∣pravity
is the glorious privilege of age.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile's heart, that faithful ad∣viser
when we obey its cooler dictates, told
him these principles were erroneous; but
he had been directed to study morals, as
a science, in the admirable writings of the
new French philosophers; a race, who, dis∣satisfied
with the beauteous workmanship of
heaven, have endeavoured, to the utmost
extent of their limited abilities, to mould
human nature into a form as distorted, and
as different from that which the great Crea∣tor
<PB N="195" REF="196"/>
gave it, as the head of a North Ameri∣can
savage, or the foot of a Chinese woman
of quality.</P>
<P>Illustrious *******! Scientific *****!
Bright luminaries of France! who have taken
such meritorious pains to convince mankind
they are on a level with the beasts that pe∣rish!
How much are human life and man∣ners
indebted to your beneficent labours!</P>
<P>Let it however lower the swelling top∣sails
of your <HI>amour propre,</HI> to be informed,
that you are, in this instance, following,
and at a great distance, one of the cast
modes of England, <HI>les esprits forts</HI> of this
kingdom, being at present only to be found
amongst the <HI>canaille.</HI></P>
<P>Free-thinking, to take this respectable
word in its perverted modern sense, is, with
us, a fashion <HI>passé,</HI> which we have left to
the common people, and our domestics.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="197"/>
A few young men, indeed, like Lord
Melvile, catch it on the rebound at Paris,
whither it has travelled with our one-horse
chaises; and a few old ones, like his noble
father, retain it because it was the <HI>ton</HI> when
they were boys; but it is by no means the
fashionable creed of modern English good
company.</P>
<P>But to return to Lord Melvile.</P>
<P>Behold him philosophically determined,
on principles which appeared to him at
once rational, and becoming a man of ho∣nour,
to break with Dorignon, marry the
nabob's daughter, and take Miss Villiers
into keeping.</P>
<P>If a sigh of regret escaped him, it was not
for the innocent object of his vicious pur∣suit;
it was not for his intended bride, who
might for aught he knew, as he had never
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
seen her, be the most amiable of women; it
was only excited by the idea of parting with
the enchanting Dorignon—

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>THE bright Maria, whose views were
diametrically opposite to those of her
noble lover, rose early on Monday morn∣ing,
all-unknowing of the honour intended
her, to take a review of the debts she had
contracted, and compare them, not with
her exchequer, <HI>that</HI> was in a melancholy
state of decline, but with the ideal profits
of her literary performances.</P>
<P>John, being called upon, produced her
bills; which, including mercer, milliner,
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
mantua-maker, hair-dresser, lodgings, and
twenty little et ceteras, amounted exactly to
one hundred and twenty-eight pounds more
than she was at present mistress of.</P>
<P>But what of that? Her first night at
Drury-Lane would more than pay it.</P>
<P>At the moment when she was settling (on
paper) so discouraging a balance, a balance
so extremely in her own disfavour, her new
footman, hired by her obliging friend, Lady
Hardy, presented himself to her notice; and
her new chariot drove up to the door.</P>
<P>Reflection, that sober matron, that un∣welcome
guest to the young, the gay, the
giddy, the enthusiastically sanguine, would
fain have obtruded herself at this instant,
but was refused; she paid Maria a momen∣tary
visit, but no more.</P>
<P>How was it possible to attend to her rigid
dictates? The chariot was so elegantly de∣signed,
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
so highly varnished—the colour of
the lining so admirably adapted to her com∣plexion—
the new footman so well drest, so
well powdered, so <HI>degagée,</HI> so very differ∣ent
from poor old John—Lady Hardy had
so clearly demonstrated, that it was impossi∣ble
to exist in London without a carriage—</P>
<P>A little additional expence for only a
month was, at all events, so trifling, so un∣interesting
an object—she had such a va∣riety
of resources, and all so certain—</P>
<P>Should even all her hopes of literary suc∣cess
vanish, which was to the last degree im∣probable,
these little demands could be of
no consequence, her present prospects con∣sidered.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile would, undoubtedly, on
their approaching union, make a present of
her fortune to her sister, Louisa, who would
of course be happy to free her from this
temporary embarrassment.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="201"/>
She threw aside the bills, stepped into the
chariot, her new footman, with John, be∣hind:
drove to Lady Hardy's, who, after
saying a thousand agreeable things to her
on her new arrangement, accompanied her
to Hyde Park; where, after congratulating
her on the very proper step she had taken,
and assuring her of her eternal and inviola∣ble
friendship, she engaged her, by a pro∣mise
of not asking her to play, to be of a

regulated by the exactest laws of <HI>bon

<P>She descended, her little heart fluttering
with pleasure, at appearing in a style so
becoming the future Lady Melvile.</P>
<P>She had always been accustomed to the
convenience of a carriage, but never before
to the splendor of one.</P>
<P>Her father's old family landau, and her

<P>Her chariot, and new footman, did not
less excite the curiosity of the gentle dowa∣gers,
who with no friendly eye beheld youth
and beauty like hers.</P>
<P>She was sitting, absorbed in contempla∣tion;
meditating perhaps on the choice of
a subject for her next tragedy, and uncon∣scious
she was the subject of attention, when
the door opened, and she saw enter the
room—no other than the god of her idola∣try,
the all-accomplished Lord Melvile,
whom she imagined far distant, at his fa∣ther's
seat in Yorkshire.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204"/>
Surprize and joy threw her off her guard:
by an involuntary, and to herself almost
unperceived, impulse, she started from her
seat, and met him in the middle of the
room.</P>
<P>His triumphant smile of gratified vanity
brought her back, for a moment, to com∣mon
sense; she recollected she was violating
the rules of decorum, and retired, blushing,
to her chair.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile seated himself by her,
without seeming to know there was any
other person in the room.</P>
<P>His foftened tone of voice, the pleasure
visible in his eyes, Miss Villiers's apparent
confusion, the glance of tenderness she could
not conceal, all tended to confirm ideas un∣favourable
to the honour of our heroine;
and might indeed have justified them in
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
minds much more inclined to candor than
any present.</P>
<P>The point was now decided; nothing
could be more clear; she had refused to
play in expectation of her lover—the cha∣riot
too—the whole mystery was now fully
unveiled.</P>
<P>Swift as the electrical fire, the malignant
whisper ran from table to table.</P>
<P>Detraction, however, had not yet ventured
to speak her own genuine language; she
had employed only the small still voice of
timid suspicion.</P>
<P>She had just appeared, glided lightly
round the rooms, and retired.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Melvile had arrived in Grosve∣nor-street
at one; had dressed, and
dined at home alone.</P>
<P>He found his house a des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> without the
enlivening caprices of Dorignon.</P>
<P>He traversed the apartments, where soli∣tude
and silence reigned.</P>
<P>The festive board, the lively repartee,
the song, the dance, were no more.</P>
<P>He felt an involuntary sadness, which he
determined to remove by dissipation.</P>
<P>He ordered his chair, called at the Pan∣theon,
spoke to some of his friends, engaged
himself to sup with Lady B. heard half a
song, and found his melancholy increase.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207"/>
His bosom still felt a frightful void; the
image of Dorignon still haunted him; she
still occupied a heart accustomed to her
chains; Miss Villiers alone could dispossess
her.</P>
<P>To Miss Villiers's lodgings, therefore, he
directed his chairmen; where being in∣formed
she was at Lady Hardy's assembly,
he resolved on honouring this amiable re∣lict
with a visit.</P>
<P>Thus much by way of parenthesis, and
we proceed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>LADY Hardy, who had overheard
some good-natured conjectures in re∣spect
to her young friend, was exceedingly
<PB N="207" REF="208"/>
alarmed; not for her young friend, but for
herself; for her own honour, and the im∣maculate
reputation of her assemblies.</P>
<P>To the fame, as well as to the happiness,
of Miss Villiers, considered abstractedly as
Miss Villiers, she was most stoically indif∣ferent;
but to what might be said to her
disadvantage as the acquaintance of Lady
Hardy, and by Lady Hardy introduced into
the fashionable world, she was even trem∣blingly
alive.</P>
<P>She had found her one <HI>whom nobody
knew,</HI> and had produced her as a woman of
character and fashion to this respectable
set, to whom she was therefore responsible
for all which might happen.</P>
<P>She was sensible her own situation in the
ever-varying region of <HI>bon ton</HI> was a fabrick
raised on a very sandy foundation; and
that, if the least atom should give way, the
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
whole superstructure would probably fall
to the ground.</P>
<P>She had no other choice remaining than
either to support Miss Villiers as a person
of family and character, for whose conduct
she dare be answerable; or to give her up
as a little adventurer, who had deceived
her, and was unworthy her future protec∣tion.</P>
<P>Had she been able to develop Lord Mel∣vile's
real intentions in respect to this lovely
girl, she would have found no difficulty in
taking her measures: but his behaviour was
to the last degree equivocal; he seemed to
like her, he shewed her the most pointed,
the most respectful attention; and the ac∣count
Mrs. Merrick had given of Miss
Villiers's birth and connexions, seemed to set
her above any address inconsistent with ho∣nour.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="210"/>
The good lady was, it must be observed,
a stranger to his lordship's treaty with the
nabob's daughter, which the trump of
Fame had not yet announced to the world.</P>
<P>This important secret, had she known
it, would have determined her conduct in a
moment; but she could not give up the
flattering idea of seeing her house graced
with the presence of Lady Melvile, who
with such personal attractions, if this very
probable event should take place, must in∣fallibly
be soon at the head of the fashion∣able
world.</P>
<P>In this perplexing uncertainty, as her
oracle, Captain Wilson, happened not to
be present to give her his opinion, she
thought it most prudent to endeavour at si∣lencing
the rising murmur of slander, by
drawing Lord Melvile's attention from
Maria, and engaging him in conversation
herself.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211"/>
“Did your lordship look in at the Pan∣theon?”</P>
<P>“I did, madam, and staid about five mi∣nutes.”</P>
<P>“Was there much company, my lord?”</P>
<P>“A great number of people, madam,
and some that one knew. Lady B—was
there, and looked like a divinity.”</P>
<P>(Here Miss Villiers changed colour, and
his lordship proceeded.)</P>
<P>“One goes every where sometimes, but I
detest the Pantheon; 'tis the temple of
<HI>ennui</HI>—'tis a church over a charnel∣house.”</P>
<P>Here Lady Hardy being called away, to
settle a dispute about a renounce at a whist∣table
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
in another room, Lord Melvile, after
talking about five minutes in a half-whisper
to our heroine, rose rather abruptly, and
desired his chair to be called.</P>
<P>Our heroine (truth obliges us to confess
her inconceivable indiscretion) rose at the
same instant; and the hall re-echoed with
“Miss Villiers's carriage and servants!”</P>
<P>A thousand enquiring glances followed
them (for they went together) through the
<HI>suite</HI> of apartments; a thousand mouths,
eager to speak, opened at once; a thou∣sand
faded countenances bloomed anew with
a momentary glow of malevolent delight.</P>
<P>The potent goddess of detraction now
returned triumphant to the charge, ex∣panded
her dusky pinions unappalled, and
shed her venom on each antiquated bosom.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="213"/>
Three hoary Sibyls formed a private con∣clave,
in a corner of the saloon.</P>
<P>“'Tis too plain, madam; I suspected
something when I saw the chariot.”</P>
<P>“Who could have believed it?—Such a
look of innocence—well—I shall never
depend on faces again.”</P>
<P>“Is it possible your ladyship should be a
stranger to this affair?—the whole town
have known it above a month.”</P>
<P>“He has dismissed the Frenchwoman
he brought with him from Paris; a young
person of family<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lest our readers should be surprized at this account of Dorignon, let it be remembered, she was <HI>dismissed;</HI> and, as these good ladies supposed, on pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pose to make room for Miss Villiers.</NOTE> whom he inhumanly
seduced, and has taken this creature to
supply her place.”</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="214"/>
“Pray, madam, who is this paragon of
Lady Hardy's? I have never been able to
discover her origin.”</P>
<P>“Nor anybody else, I believe, madam.
For my part, I am astonished Lady Hardy
<HI>lets such people in.</HI>”</P>
<P>But this indulgent trio were not the only
persons whose attention were fixed on Miss
Villiers.</P>
<P>Curiosity had her hundred eyes awake.</P>
<P>Half the company at the card-tables
wished their respective parties at an end,
that they might be at liberty to investigate
this weighty affair.</P>
<P>Lady Blast left her pool, unfinished, to
the care of a friend, on purpose to have the
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
satisfaction of seeing where Lord Melvile
stopped.</P>
<P>She had the transcendent happiness, as
her coach crossed the street, to see his lord∣ship's
chair and servants at Miss Villiers's
door.</P>
<P>Had she waited three minutes longer,
she would have seen him go away, as he
was engaged to sup with the beautiful Lady
B—; but that was not the point at which
she aimed.</P>
<P>She hurried home, and dispatched cards
to a dozen of her female friends (a venera∣ble
band, who had figured forty years be∣fore
as her sister demi-reps), to drink cho∣colate
with her at twelve the next morning.</P>
<P>She assembled the dread divan, in order to
pass sentence of banishment from good com∣pany
on Miss Villiers.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="216"/>
We will leave this respectable <HI>court of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laims,</HI> to examine the charge now prepar∣ing
by Lady Blast against Miss Villiers, to
settle our heroine's pretensions to continue
one of the <HI>beau monde,</HI> and to issue their im∣perial
mandate in consequence of their sage
determination, whatever that may be; whilst
the lovely victim of their assiduous malevo∣lence,
unconscious of the storm impending
over her head, soars aloft on the lucid wings
of hope; and, far from imagining herself on
the point of being degraded from her pre∣sent
moderate rank in life, enjoys by antici∣pation
the charms of a station infinitely
more elevated.</P>
