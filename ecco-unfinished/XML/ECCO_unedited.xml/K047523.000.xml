<HEAD>The Wonderful Old Man.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by <HI>George Alexander Steevens.</HI></BYLINE>

<LG>
<L>THERE was an Old Man, and tho' it's not common,</L>
<L>Yet if he said true, he was born of a woman;</L>
<L>And, tho' it's incredible, yet I've been told</L>
<L>He was once a meer infant, but age made him old.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whene'er he was hungry, he long'd for some meat,</L>
<L>And if he could get it, 'twas said he would eat;</L>
<L>When thirsty, he'd drink, if you gave him a pot,</L>
<L>And the liquor most commonly ran down his throat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He seldom or ever could see without light,</L>
<L>And yet I've been told he could hear in the night:</L>
<L>He has oft been awake in the day-time, 'tis said,</L>
<L>And has fallen asleep as he lay in his bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis reported his tongue always mov'd when he talk'd,</L>
<L>And he stirr'd both his legs and his arms as he walk'd,</L>
<L>His gait was so odd, had you seen him, you'd burst,</L>
<L>For one leg or t'other wou'd always be first.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His face was the oddest that ever was seen,</L>
<L>For if 'twas not wash'd, it was seldom quite clean;</L>
<L>He shew'd most his teeth, if he happen'd to grin,</L>
<L>And his mouth stood across 'twixt his nose &amp; his chin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length he fell sick, as old chronicles tell,</L>
<L>And then, as they say, he was not very well;</L>
<L>But what is more strange! in so weak a condition,</L>
<L>As he cou'd not give fees, he cou'd get no physician.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What pity he dy'd! yet 'tis said that his death</L>
<L>Was occasion'd at last by the want of his breath;</L>
<L>But peace to his bones that in ashes now moulder,</L>
<L>Had he liv'd a day longer, he'd been a day older!</L>
