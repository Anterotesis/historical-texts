<HEAD>The Case of Protestant Dissenters
in Carolina.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LIberty</HI> being the only sure and lasting Foundation of our Quiet
and Satisfaction in this World, a Community can never be
reduc'd to any State, in which it will not have a right to
use all Methods, absolutely necessary to secure that Liberty
when it is in danger, or to regain it when it is lost: Nor can there
be any Condition of any single Person in that Community imagin'd
or devis'd, in which it will not be his truer Interest to give his Assistance
to secure or recover the Liberty of that Community, than to endanger
or destroy it, tho he were by that means to get all the Power of the Com∣munity
into his own Hands. For how much soever he might think it for
his Interest to inslave others; yet it may be thought as much for the In∣terest
of others to inslave him. And the surest way to secure himself a∣gainst
coming into so base and miserable a Condition, is no longer to
insist upon governing his Actions towards others, by his own licentious
and uncertain Humor, lest another should pretend to act as arbitrari∣ly
and uncertainly towards him: But to submit, that his own Actions
as well as the Actions of all others should be bound by a stated and
certain Rule; which when he transgresses, will bring him under
greater Inconveniences than can be compensated by the Advantages,
which may accrue to him by the Transgression. And this very Re∣straint
that Men put themselves under, securing to 'em as far as may be
at the same time, the Freedom of acting according to a known and
stated Rule, is what we call Liberty: And being the Foundation of all
their other Privileges, is what it must necessarily be their common In∣terest
to preserve.</P>
<P>And as Liberty is the only Foundation of our Quiet and Satisfaction
in this World; so <HI>Liberty of Conscience</HI> is the only Security that any Go∣vernment
can give us for our safe Passage thro this World to another.
And Liberty of Conscience being a Liberty for every Man to believe
what appears to him to be true, and to act pursuant to his Belief in
matters relating to another Life, that don't disturb the Publick
Peace; 'tis no wonder, if Men are generally so much more tender of
this Branch of Liberty, than they are of any other: Because both the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Interests of another World are infinitely more our Concern to secure,
than the Ease and Satisfaction of the present; and that even our
Civil Liberty it self becomes precarious and defeasible, where the
Liberty of Mens Consciences has not the strongest Securitys that may
be. For People can never be sure that a Government will not force
'em to act according to its uncertain and arbitrary Determinations,
in matters that relate to the Peace of the Community, instead of
allowing them the Freedom to act according to a stated and certain
Rule, which will not allow 'em the Liberty to act according to their own
Opinion, in matters which relate not at all to the Community: Nay in
matters, which as they can do no body good or hurt besides themselves;
so in matters which can do them no good or hurt, but in relation to
another World: And whether they will do them any good or hurt in
that respect, can't be known to the Government neither.</P>
<P>And those will be apt to think themselves less secure of Civil Liberty,
after once their Religious Libertys have been violated, who consider,
that Governments being erected for the Good of the Community, may
have a right in some extraordinary Cases to break in upon the known
and stated Rules of acting, in order to a Publick Good; which the Poli∣ticians
have call'd <HI>Jus Dominationis.</HI> But that they can never have
a right to hinder the Liberty that all Men have to think, and act in
matters of Faith and Worship, as shall seem to them most reasonable
and convenient; because the Good of the Society can never require it,
unless it can require a Government to tempt Men to turn Knaves and
Villains, for Knavery and Villany sake: For that is all that Persecution
and Violence offer'd to Mens Consciences can be design'd to do. So that
in a word, if any Government breaks in upon the Liberty of Conscience,
it breaks in upon an indefeasible Right of the People, and commits a Vi∣olation,
which must necessarily turn to the Prejudice of the Community;
and may therefore much more easily break in upon Civil Liberty, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho very sacred, must be allow'd to be defeasible, and lawfully to be bro∣ken
in upon in such Cases, where the Good of the Community absolutely
requires it. And when a Government has once broken in upon the Li∣berty
of any one Man's Conscience, or upon the Consciences of any Body
of Men, Civil Liberty is not only thereby endanger'd, but no other Body
of Men can promise themselves any <HI>lasting Security</HI> for the Liberty
of their Consciences. For tho some religious Bodys of Men may
have better Securitys than others, yet there can be no Security to any,
that can outlive the Change of Opinion in the Government, but that
of an Universal and Absolute Toleration: Which indeed can hardly
ever be destroy'd. Because it will never be the Interest of the Go∣vernment
to destroy it, however the Government may happen to
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
change their Opinion in Religion; and because 'twill always be the In∣terest
of every Man that is subject to that Government, to take all
proper Methods to preserve it. We have seen all the Laws, made in
our own Country for the Security of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> repeal'd
and trampl'd on by a Government of a different Persuasion: Where∣as
had an Universal and Absolute Toleration been establish'd, the
Church had escap'd a Persecution that ensu'd. So that upon the whole,
Oppression and Persecution are not only against <HI>Natural Equity,</HI> and the
<HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Example</HI> of the Author of <HI>the Christian Religion:</HI> Nor is
Persecution in particular only altogether inconsistent with the <HI>first
Principles of the Reformation;</HI> but both Persecution and Oppression are
against the <HI>true Interest of all Communitys,</HI> and of <HI>every</HI> Man, and of
every <HI>Set of Men</HI> in 'em.</P>
<P>And that Oppression and Persecution are <HI>generally thought to be so,</HI>
appears from hence; that in the great Contest that is on foot at pre∣sent
both Abroad and at Home, the several contending Powers and
Partys either really aim at the restoring and securing Liberty, or at
least pretend to do so; as well knowing, that no Number of Men
cou'd be brought to interest themselves in their Quarrel on any o∣ther
score. Thus whilst the Confederates are endeavouring to se∣cure
the Libertys of <HI>Europe,</HI> by dispossessing the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> of
the Throne of <HI>Spain;</HI> and to restore the Rights of <HI>Spain,</HI> by placing
a Prince of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> in it; the King of <HI>France</HI> pretends
to have only pursu'd a Will made in the favour of his Grandson in
seizing on that Monarchy, and to have prevented the Injury that
wou'd have accru'd to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by dismembring it. And whilst
some of the Northern Powers don't think the Reform'd Religion se∣cure,
till the exorbitant Power of the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> is reduc'd;
The Roman Catholicks industriously give it out every where, that
the Success of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> portends Ruin to their Church;
because that House is in so strict a League with Hereticks: And endea∣vour
to frighten the poor bigotted People with the Stakes and Gibbets,
the Plots and Conspiracys, the Croisadocs and Inquisitions, and all those
other Tragical Engines of Blood and Violence, which they have never
suffer'd Hereticks to be unacquainted with, whenever their Power has
been equal to their implacable Malice and ill Will. And thus at Home,
whilst the Low Church have protected the Dissenters from the Perse∣cution
of the High Church, in order to maintain their own Liberty as well
as that of the Dissenters; and have been enabled since by the Assistance
of the Dissenters to ward off a Persecution against themselves, which
it had been afterwards in the power of the High Church to have
commenc'd against them, when they had so pleas'd; the High Church
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
have endeavour'd to suggest and insinuate in all Parts of the King∣dom,
that the Church is in Danger, and that they shan't have the Li∣berty
of being High Churchmen any longer, from too strict a Cor∣respondence,
that they observe, it seems, between the Low Church
and Dissenters.</P>
<P>And no wonder there is such a struggle for Liberty in reality
or pretence in all Parts of <HI>Christendom,</HI> since every Man that is
sensible of the inestimable value of Liberty, is at the same time sen∣sible,
that it can receive no hurt in any Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> without en∣dangering
it in all others. For Persecution and Slavery, like a Fire,
waste and destroy as long as there is any thing left for them to prey
upon. Nor is there any Security against them, but the checking
them at their first Appearing; since if they be suffer'd to spread, no
body can say where they will stop. Nor does any body in the Case
of Fire (nor shou'd they in the other Cases) trust to his distance
from it, at its first Beginning; but instead of pleasing himself with
the deluding Hopes that it will go out of it self, places all his Confi∣dence
and Security in this, that every one takes it for a common E∣nemy,
and thinks himself oblig'd, for his own sake, to lend the best.
Assistance he can to quench it. I hope therefore no body, who has
these Apprehensions of the Value and <HI>tender Nature of Liberty,</HI> will
be angry with me, that I am giving the best Assistance I can, to ex∣tinguish
a Flame, that is broke out in one of the remotest Parts of her
Majesty's Dominions. For tho it began here at Home, yet as it has
been often observ'd to happen in great Fires, it has catch'd in dis∣continuous
Buildings, and has spread still further and further, till it
has at last reach'd some of the most distant Parts of the World. An
Attempt was but made to disable Protestant Dissenters from bearing
any Office in <HI>England,</HI> and presently they were excluded from them
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from Sitting in the Commons House of Assembly in
<HI>Carolina.</HI> So that since it appears in Fact, as well as in Reason, that
no Part of the <HI>English</HI> Dominions is out of Danger, by its distance
from the Place where this Fire first appear'd; nor secure, because it
seem'd but a small one just kindled: I promise my self that it will
be taken kindly that I give my helping Hand to the putting it out in
any Place where it yet remains. And that it will not be ill taken, if
the Water, and Buckets, and other Engines be not in my Custody;
nor those that are to manage 'em under my Direction, and nothing
more be in my Power; if I only give the Notice, and cry Fire, in
order to bring others to my Aid, and to dispose those who have the
more particular Care of these Matters, to apply themselves, by all
proper Methods, to stop its spreading any further.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
But I know it will be justly expected that I shou'd satisfy every Bo∣dy
that I don't give a false Alarm. That I may not therefore be
wanting in this Point, I will here transcribe some part of an Act
made in the Assembly of <HI>Carolina</HI> in the year 1704. intitul'd, <HI>An
Act for the more effectual Preservation of the Government of this Pro∣vince,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N<SUP>o</SUP> 6.</NOTE>
&amp;c. referring the Reader to the Act it self hereunto annex'd,
for his further Satisfaction. Part of that Act runs thus: <HI>Be it there∣fore
enacted by and with the Authority,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That every Person after the Ra∣tification
of this Act, that shall be chosen a Member of the Commons House
of Assembly, that hath not, within the space of 12 months before such his Elec∣tion,
receiv'd the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the Rites and
Vsage of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>as establish'd by Law; such person after his
Election, and before he be permitted to sit and vote in the said House, shall
receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the Rites and
Vsage of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>in some publick Church, upon some
Lord's Day, commonly call'd Sunday, immediately after Divine Service and
Sermon; and every of the said Persons, in open Assembly, in a full House
duly sitting, with their Speaker in his Chair, shall deliver a Certificate of
such his receiving the said Sacrament, as aforesaid, under the Hand of the
respective Minister, or shall make Proof of the Truth thereof by two credible
Witnesses at the least upon Oath.</HI> By which it plainly appears, that pro∣testant
Dissenters are by this Act <HI>rendred incapable of sitting in the Com∣mons
House of Assembly;</HI> and consequently, that they are depriv'd
of a Capacity which the Law had given them, and which there∣fore
was as much <HI>theirs,</HI> as any other thing they laid claim to: Since
'tis the Law alone in Civil Governments that makes this thing Mine,
and that thing another Man's. Nor is it of an insignificant thing
that they are depriv'd by this Law neither: For as Legal Capacitys in
every Country are the Foundations of all the Happiness a Man can have
in that Country; so the Capacity this Act deprives them of, is one of
the highest a Man can have in that Country, either in respect of <HI>Vse∣fulness</HI>
or <HI>Honour:</HI> And a Capacity, to which they had as <HI>good a Title,</HI>
as to a Capacity of holding or devising an Estate, by Grant, Sale,
Deed of Gift or Testament, or of contracting any Relation in Life,
or of holding or executing any Place or Office, or of having any Ti∣tle,
or Mark of Distinction and Honour.</P>
<P>And as the Capacity to sit in the Commons House of Assembly is
not only a Capacity of the greatest Power, but of the greatest Dis∣tinction
and Honour; so the taking it away is a Note of great <HI>Infa∣my</HI>
and Disgrace, for it's singling 'em out as Knaves and Rascals, who
are not fit to be intrusted with the Libertys of the People in the
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
same degree that other Men are; and 'tis but giving them an ill
Name, and the Mob will not fail to treat 'em accordingly. This
I mention the rather, because I find by <HI>a Representation of several Grie∣vances
in</HI> Carolina, <HI>sign'd by several of the Members of the Commons
House of Assembly, and other principal Inhabitants, to the Lords Proprie∣tors,
dated the 26th of</HI> June, 1703. that those who had then (and
who have still) the chief Power of that Province in their Hands,
are very well acquainted with such tumultuous Manners of Proceed∣ings,
as may be more particularly seen in the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th,
14th, 15th and 16th Articles of the said Representation, a Copy
whereof is hereunto annex'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">N<SUP>o</SUP> 5.</NOTE>. By which Articles it plainly ap∣pears,
that after the prevailing Party in the Assembly had abus'd
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evil'd some worthy Members of that Assembly, and treated
them with the most reflecting Language imaginable, only for in∣sisting
upon some things that were absolutely necessary for the pre∣serving
the Dignity of that House, and the Freedom of their Elec∣tions;
the Mob was rais'd upon 'em, and incourag'd to insult 'em for
four or five days in a very riotous manner, to their great Damage,
and the manifest Danger of their Lives. During which time, the
Governme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was so far from quelling the Riot, or punishing the Ri∣oters;
that as all Methods were taken to raise, countenance and incou∣rage
it whilst it lasted<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>; so, like Methods have been us'd to skreen the
Rioters and their Abettors from Justice ever since. In order whereto
the principal Promoters of this Riot have been put into the chief
Places of the Law. And I suppose no body will find it difficult to
beleive, that these riotous, tumultuous and insolent Proceedings have
been very grievous and frequent since the passing this Act as well as
before. And as these Insolences must be born patiently by the Pro∣testant
Dissenters, and without any hopes of Redress, if they con∣tinue
there; so they can't quit the Place, if these Insolences become
insupportable, without sustaining great <HI>Damage</HI> in their Estates, and
exposing themselves to manifest <HI>Dangers</HI> and Inconveniences in trans∣porting
their Familys and Effects. So that upon the whole, this Act
will appear not only to deprive the Protestant Dissenters of some∣thing
that was theirs, but to deprive 'em of a <HI>Capacity</HI> of <HI>Honour</HI> as
well as <HI>Power,</HI> and to brand 'em with a Mark of great <HI>Infamy</HI> and Re∣proach;
and at the same time either to expose 'em to the <HI>Insolences</HI>
that usually accompany such a Character, if they shou'd have Hardi∣ness
enough to stay in the Province, or, which is worse, to the
great <HI>Damage</HI> and <HI>Danger</HI> of their <HI>Estates</HI> and <HI>Familys</HI> if they can't.</P>
<P>Now the making Men uneasy for the sake of any Opinion that they
hold in Matters of Religion, which does not disturb the Publick
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Peace, is <HI>Persecution:</HI> Whether they are made uneasy by inflicting
any Corporal or Pecuniary Punishment, or by depriving them of any
Privilege; and whether that Privilege be Power, Honour, or Repu∣tation,
it makes no difference. For still every thing that makes a
Man uneasy is Punishment; and the inflicting that Punishment for
Conscience-sake, makes it Persecution. And what can it be then
but a severe Persecution, to rob Men of a Capacity for the sake of
their Conscience, by which they can be of the most publick Use and
Service? Usefulness being the greatest Pleasure, and justly deem'd
by all good Men the truest and noblest End of Life; in which Men
come nearest to the Character of our B. Saviour, who went about doing
good; and even to that of our great Creator, whose Goodness is over
all his Works. And since Marks of Honour and high Trusts are Re∣wards
of Merit and Greatness, What can the taking away the very Ca∣pacity
of 'em be, but Punishments? And what can Punishments be but
Persecution, if inflicted for Conscience-sake? And if the bare tak∣ing
away a Mark of Honour, and advantageous Distinction for Con∣science-sake,
must be deem'd a Persecution, 'tis certain, that it must be
as great an Aggravation and Enhancement of that Persecution, to
brand Men with a Mark of Distinction to their disadvantage, and ex∣pose
them as Men not fit to be trusted in publick Concerns; as if every
Dissenter there was to stand upon a Stage, or in their Courts of
Justice, with a Paper upon his Breast, notifying him to be a Prote∣stant
Dissenter, and therefore to be shunned and avoided as a Be∣trayer
of the highest Trusts of the Province. The Insolences which
may follow such a Character as this, may oblige the Dissenters to quit
the Province, to the very great Loss and Damage of their Estates:
And in that Case, this Exclusion will amount, not only to a heavy
Fine, but to Banishment it self; and perhaps to Mutilation, and loss
of Life or Limb, before they get out of the Country.</P>
<P>This is the Persecution this Act exposes Protestant Dissenters to at
present. But what Persecution can they <HI>be secure against for the fu∣ture,</HI>
upon the Principles on which this Act is founded? Nay, what
persecuting Bills mayn't they, who are thought to have justly de∣serv'd
this Treatment, apprehend from a Commons House of Assem∣bly,
compos'd of almost none but such as thought they deserv'd it?
For if the Commons House of Assembly have a Right to bring in a
Bill, to deprive Protestant Dissenters of the Capacity of sitting in
that House; mayn't they bring others to deprive 'em of any other Ca∣pacity
of Honour that they now hold? And if they can bring in a
Bill to punish 'em with this Mark of Disgrace, can't they bring in a
Bill or Bills to punish 'em with any greater? If they can call 'em
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Rogues and Rascals by Implication, can't they call 'em so in terms at
length when they please? And mayn't they then treat them as such;
and bring in a Bill to Pillory or Cart 'em, or burn 'em in the Cheek; or
put any the most publick Badge of Infamy upon 'em that they think
fit? For when they once come to be thought Rogues and Rascals, Di∣sturbers
of the Publick Peace; it's then intirely in the Breast of the
House to bring in a Bill or Bills, in order to inflict such further Pu∣nishments,
and to take such other Precautions against them as the
Exigency of the Case, that is, according as the Security of the Pub∣lick
shall require.</P>
<P>Nay, and will not the Publick Security <HI>require</HI> that <HI>more</HI> should be
done? For if Protestant Dissenters in <HI>Carolina</HI> are not fit to re∣main
capable of the Legislative Power, it can't be thought safe to let
them remain capable of any part of the Executive Power. And when
they are not capable of Representing, it can never be thought safe to
let 'em remain capable of being Represented. For if they should be
intrusted with the Power of Electing, they may elect Men, that may
restore them to all the Capacities, of which for the Publick Safety they
have been depriv'd: And if they should not be capable of Electing,
it can't be thought prudent to let 'em enjoy the Property which enti∣tles
others to that Right. For Power will follow Property, and if
they are suffer'd to hold their Property, they may regain their
Power: And when their Lands shall be confiscated, 'twill not be safe
to suffer a parcel of exasperated and desperate Men to remain in the
Country; and so they must either banish 'em, or send 'em to the
Gallows: Or if common Compassion and Humanity should so far
prevail against consistency with these Principles, as to let this present
Set of Dissenters live out the time that Nature has allotted 'em, they
must necessarily forbid 'em to Marry, or oblige 'em to Castration;
that a Race of such Monsters may no longer be continued to the dan∣ger
and disturbance of the Publick Peace. And if Protestant Dis∣senters
may be exposed, made incapable of all Offices, of Electing, or
being Elected to the Commons House of Assembly; if they may be con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fiscated
and proscribed, and that the first of these Steps, after it is once
taken, does naturally, and in good Policy ought to lead Men on to
all the others; the Dissenters have but a slender Security, that such
Measures shall not be taken from the Temper of those Men, who by
virtue of this Act must compose the Commons House of Assembly. And
this Bill having past the Deputies of the Proprietors, who (as
things stand now in <HI>Carolina</HI>) compose the Upper House, and the
Proprietors themselves having Ratify'd it; the Protestant Dissen∣ters
can have no Security, that they will not pass and ratify
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
any of the other, when they shall come to be offer'd to 'em.
And let no body think these Inferences to be Visionary and Chime∣rical,
and the mere Guesses and Conjectures of a Splenetick Man:
Let them that think so, shew me a Country where Persecutors have
ever stopt of themselves, after they have once got Power into
their hands; and being contented with their first Beginnings, have
made no further progress: Or that they have not proceeded from one
degree of Violence to another, till they arriv'd at long run at the
last; if they have not been prevented by some publick Calamity,
Distress or Exigency, that has made them think it unsafe for them∣selves
to carry their Violences to that degree. So that it has been a
common Observation, that Persecution never stops till it comes to
Fire and Faggot, and only stops there because it can go no fur∣ther.</P>
<P>Upon
which account, as well as many others, it is an Oppression
in it self so odious, and so generally thought to be so; that after that
is fully prov'd upon any Law, there needs nothing more to be said
against it: For that it self is saying, That it is against <HI>Natural Equity,</HI>
the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> the <HI>first Principles of the Reformation,</HI> and the
<HI>true Interest</HI> of every Community. I shan't therefore go about to
prove this Law to deserve these general Characters, but only give
those ill Characters of this Law, which are peculiar to it self; and
prove particularly, that it is a great Instance of Ingratitude to the
Protestant Dissenters, that it is Ruinous and Destructive to the Pro∣vince,
and a Breach of the Original Contract between the Proprietors
and the People that inhabit it.</P>
<P>'Tis in the first place a most <HI>unjust Return</HI> to the Dissenters, for
their quiet, impartial and obliging Behaviour to their Neighbours,
and for their kind and respectful Deportment to the Church of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
So far were they from undermining the Church, or attempting
any thing against it, that they contributed voluntarily to the Main∣tenance
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Minister in <HI>Gharles-Town,</HI> the Ca∣pital
of this Province, the only Church of <HI>England</HI> Minister that
there was at that time in the Province, before there was any publick
Maintenance settled on him. And about the Year 1698. Mr. <HI>Blake</HI> a
Dissenting Governour, thinking the Maintenance of the Minister too
precarious, procur'd an Act of Assembly (in which there were a
great number of Dissenters) for the settling a very convenient House,
with a Glebe, two Servants, and 150 <HI>i. per Ann.</HI> upon the Minister
of that Church for ever. And after the said Act had pass'd through
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
the two Houses by his Influence, he gave the Assent to it: The Go∣vernor
in <HI>Carolina</HI> having a Negative upon all Bills, after they have
past thro both Houses. And as he made several considerable Presents
to him; so his Lady, tho a Dissenter as well as he, gave some things
for adorning the Pulpit. This was the worst Effect that the Church ever
felt, of the Dissenters Power in <HI>Carolina.</HI> So far were they from re∣pealing
any Laws in favour of the Church, when they had the Power
in their Hands; that they made these <HI>Contributions,</HI> and settl'd this
<HI>Endowment</HI> upon the Church of <HI>Charles</HI> Town by Law, tho they were
under no Obligations to do so; but such as arose from the deference
they had to the Government of <HI>England,</HI> and a grateful Sense both of
the Liberty it had granted to 'em, and of a Generosity somewhat akin
to this, which the Churchmen had shewn in their Regard. And as
they were under no other Obligations, so they had no apparent
Interest that could induce them to the one or the other, besides that
which should induce Men to all handsom and generous Actions. It
might perhaps indeed be imagin'd at this distance, that this was
done to court Popularity with the Churchmen, in order to get them∣selves
elected for the future. But no Body can imagine this but a
perfect Stranger to the Province, for 'tis notorious that above two
Thirds of the People of <HI>Carolina</HI> are Dissenters. So that nothing
seems to have engag'd them to this Christian Behaviour, but a truly
Christian Spirit; which appears from the liberal Maintenance that
they settl'd upon the Minister, as well as from the Principles, which
in all probability engag'd them to settle it. These are the generous
Dispositions, which an Universal and Absolute Toleration permitted
Humanity and the Christian Religion to inspire Men withal in <HI>Caro∣lina:</HI>
And which it would by a Parity of Reason produce every where
else. For by this Instance it is plain that it is not the Differences in
Opinion between the Church and Dissenters, that alienate the Minds
of the one from the other; and 'tis as plain that it is only the In∣juries
done to the Dissenters upon account of these Differences, that
do. But when Men once feel any Power oppressive and injurious,
'tis no Wonder if they then endeavour to lessen it.</P>
<P>But so far has the want of Provocations been able to work <HI>these</HI>
Dispositions in another set of Men in <HI>Carolina,</HI> who would fain be
thought the only Churchmen there, that even these singular and un∣constrain'd
Kindnesses and Benefactions of the Dissenters to the
Churchmen have not been able to do it; but have only tended to
give them the <HI>Hardiness,</HI> as the impartial Behaviour of the Dissenters
has, to the continuing to them the <HI>Power to make this disqualifying Law.</HI>
A Law which hereby manifestly appears to be a returning of Evil for
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Good, instead of what good Laws, as well as good Actions, should be
a returning of Good for Evil. What can such Ingratitude as this do,
but make those that are guilty of it appear to be void of all Principles
of Humanity and the Christian Religion, and render them odious both
to God and Man? And if the Men that have made this Act should
pass for good Churchmen, and be thought and said to have done it
for the Service of the Church, and should be supported and counte∣nanc'd
in it, by Men that assume and appropriate that Character to
themselves; what can all this tend to, but to render the Church as
odious as they are? For a Church that teaches and abets Ingrati∣tude,
may pass for any Church rather than a Christian one. And
since nothing is more apt to provoke Men than Injurys, heighten'd
by Ingratitude, what can in any likelihood keep Protestant Dissenters
easy there, unless they shou'd take themselves to be the Tribe, which,
according to the Patriarch's Prediction, was to be a strong Ass,
couching under his Burden; and so shou'd think themselves oblig'd not
to endeavour to fling off their Burden, in order to fulfil the Prophecy?</P>
<P>And indeed <HI>Carolina</HI> is not the only Part of her Majesty's Domi∣nions,
where the Protestant Dissenters have seem'd to act upon this
Persuasion, and to have born the weight of the Protestant Re∣ligion,
without sharing the better part of its peculiar Advantages.
They have been forc'd both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> to yield themselves
a perpetual Sacrifice to their Persecutors, rather than to take Liber∣ty
in common with the Papists, to the Ruin of the Protestant Reli∣gion,
and our Civil Libertys. They have expos'd themselves as far,
to procure Exclusions, Revolutions, and such like Securitys for our
Religion and Libertys, as any other Set of Men whatsoever: But
when any such Securitys have been obtain'd, they still, like the Ass,
have born the Burden of the Taxes, of Loans, and any thing else,
for the Support of the Government; tho they have been so far from
usually having had any of the fine Trappings, that other Animals,
which are often more for Show than Service, have been adorn'd with;
that they have not yet obtain'd any Security in <HI>Ireland</HI> against the
heavy Load of former Persecutions, and have obtain'd no such Secu∣rity
in <HI>England,</HI> as can prevent their Enemys riding them in several
Parts of the Kingdom. And this I say, that the Protestant Dissen∣ters
in <HI>Carolina</HI> may have this Consolation, such as it is, till they
can obtain a better, That they are not the only Protestant Dissenters,
who don't meet with their Rewards in this World, and are to wait
for them with Patience in another.</P>
<P>And indeed the Christian Religion will oblige them to wait with
Patience: But yet the Ingratitude of those in <HI>Carolina,</HI> that make it
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
necessary for them to do so, can never be thought any thing by con∣sidering
Men, but the height of Imprudence and Folly. For it is do∣ing
all they can to make their Friends and Benefactors turn their
greatest Enemys, and to make them more their Enemys, who are so
at present. And this particular Ingratitude of a Set of Men in <HI>Ca∣rolina,</HI>
who arrogate to themselves the name of Churchmen, is the
greatest Provocation that can be given to the Dissenters, to <HI>repent</HI> of
the kind and handsom Usage they have always given them there;
and to teach the Dissenters, whenever they have it in their Power
again, to <HI>use</HI> them hardly, and <HI>keep them under;</HI> since they are not to
be won by such Instances of unexampl'd Kindness and Generosity.
The unforeseen Changes and Alterations to which all Governments
are subject, ought to teach all Partys Moderation, and especially those
who are in Power; but the Government of <HI>Carolina</HI> altering neces∣sarily
with its Proprietors, and its Proprietorships shifting daily from
one Owner to another, and being thereby liable to more frequent and
sudden Alterations than almost any free Government in the World
besides, makes Heat and Violence in any Set of Men in Power there,
a greater Presumption and Madness than in any other: For it is giv∣ing
an ill Precedent, that every one easily foresees, by selling a Pro∣prietorship
to day, may turn against themselves to morrow. And that
which makes Violence in these Men yet the more frantick and unac∣countable,
is, that perhaps the very Title of the Proprietors, and
consequently all the Title which this Set of Men have to Power (they
deriving all their Power from these Proprietors) may appear to have
a great many more Flaws than one, when it comes to be look'd into.
And such Violence and Ingratitude as this, may put Persons upon such
an Examination of their Title for the good of the Publick, as per∣haps
they wou'd not have undertaken barely for their own private
Advantage.</P>
<P>But tho all Ingratitude be Folly and against our true Interest, yet
the Folly of all those, whether Proprietors or Inhabitants of <HI>Carolina,</HI>
who have had any hand in passing this Law; and the Manner in which
they have acted inconsistently with their own <HI>true Interest</HI> and Advan∣tage,
is abundantly more obvious and complicated, than an Act
of mere Ingratitude can be. 'Tis a known Maxim, that all In∣fringements
upon Liberty, and particularly upon Liberty of
Conscience, the most valuable, and perhaps the only indefeasible
Branch of Liberty, tend to <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acken Industry,</HI> to <HI>hinder Propagation</HI> and
Increase, to <HI>prevent</HI> Men from coming to <HI>settle</HI> in those parts of the
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
World which are the most inviting, and to <HI>drive</HI> those who are al∣ready
fix'd and settled there, to seek new Habitations in the very
Sinks of the Universe, where they may but enjoy this desir'd Liber∣ty.
We have a clear and undeniable Instance of this in <HI>Greece,</HI> where
there are not now, under the absolute Government of the Great
Turk, according to a modest Computation, the one hundredth part of
the Inhabitants, that there were when they were free Governments:
And by this means that Country is perfectly over-run with Briars
and Thorns; and an inexpressible face of Barrenness, Poverty
and Want, covers all that Territory, which was once justly re∣nown'd
for the greatest Fruitfulness, Trade and Riches of the
World. And the Misery which the <HI>late</HI> Persecution has produc'd in
the Country, and in the Towns and Villages of <HI>France,</HI> in so short a
Time, is a very convincing Proof, that all Violations of Liberty of
Conscience will produce the same fatal Effects, as violating the Civil.
Rights of Mankind. And on the contrary, <HI>Holland,</HI> a perfect Bog,
fit for nothing but what it was, the Habitation of a few poor Fisher∣men,
is, by the great regard it has to the maintaining Liberty, and
particularly Liberty of Conscience, become the very Garden of this
part of the World.</P>
<P>But that we may not talk of Places at a distance only, Have not
the Persecutions that have been set on foot here at <HI>home,</HI> by Prote∣stants
against Protestants, ever since the Reformation, driven an infi∣nite
number of People from our happy Climate, from their Habita∣tions,
Friends, Relations, and Christian Acquaintance, to run the
hazards of transporting themselves, with their Families and Effects,
to very remote Parts of the World, either wholly uncultivated and
uninhabited, or where there were none but a wild ignorant and sa∣vage
People, who had nothing but this to recommend them, that
they were by far preferable to their Oppressors?</P>
<P>If then Persecution can drive Men from the best Countrys,
and depopulate the most healthful Climates, the most fertile
Soils, and the most cultivated Regions; will it not easily de∣populate
a <HI>Country which has not these Advantages?</HI> The ve∣ry
Reasons which drove Men from hence to <HI>Carolina,</HI> or which
tempted them to stay there, are now <HI>ceased,</HI> and <HI>drive</HI> Men from
thence into other parts of the World. Liberty of Conscience, the
Pearl of great Price, that the Dissenting Inhabitants have sold all they
had to purchase, they are now depriv'd of; and the very Property
that possibly others of baser Minds might go to seek, they have now
no great reason to think themselves secure of neither: Nay, the ve∣ry
Reproach which they perhaps avoided here, when they for sook
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
their native Country, has overtaken them there, where they are
now counted as the Off-scouring of all things. Whilst, God be
prais'd, the Liberty that had left our happy Island, and was banish'd
to these remote Parts of the English Dominions, has visited it again;
and seems now likely to continue and fix amongst us. So that the
Birth and Destruction of this Province, will in all probability be
owing to the same Cause: For there are now great Numbers of the
principal Inhabitants, who have resolv'd to transplant themselves
into other Parts, as soon as they shall see that there is no Redress a∣gainst
this Act to be obtain'd.</P>
<P>But perhaps the People of <HI>Carolina</HI> are in the Case of the Antient
<HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> or at least of the present <HI>Swiss,</HI> and have more
Inhabitants than that barren Country can maintain: And that there∣fore
they were oblig'd to make this Law to <HI>thin it,</HI> and drive some of
them away. This wou'd be thought a severe Sarcasm if it were said
in <HI>Carolina,</HI> or to any that knows that Province; there being not
above a Thousand Souls to inhabit a most fruitful Country of Three
hundred Miles in length, and no Man can tell how many in breadth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Charter <HI>p.</HI> 1. as also the 2d Charter.</NOTE>
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second having granted the Proprietors all the Land
Westward in a direct Line, between 31 and 36 degrees of Nor∣thern
Latitude to the South Seas. Therefore this is said only to give
those a true Notion of this Law, who are perfect Strangers to the
Place.</P>
<P>But then possibly it will be imagin'd, that this Act affects but a
few of the Inhabitants of this Province, and those the Mean, the
Lazy, and the Vicious; and that therefore it is but sacrificing a <HI>small
Number of unworthy</HI> Men to the Peace and Quiet of a Country:
Or that it is but letting out a little ill Blood, which is readily to be
parted with for the Health and Vigor of the Body Politick, tho per∣haps
it may not abound with too great Quantity of that which is of a
just Temperament. Something like this at least was pretended and
alledged against the Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> when Persecution drove
them from hence to those parts of the World: But this is so far
from being the true Reason of passing this Act, that the Facts them∣selves
are notoriously false; as indeed they were in respect of those
whom the Penal Laws drove from hence. But yet with this diffe∣rence,
that this Pretext, according to the Prejudices that were ge∣nearlly
entertain'd against the Dissenters here, carried some Face and
Plausibility along with it; whilst there is not the least colour for
these Allegations there: The Protestant Dissenters being above two
Thirds of the Inhabitants of <HI>Carolina,</HI> as well as the most sober, or∣derly,
and the richest, that is, the most Landed and Trading Men in
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
the Province. Such a Character as this of the Dissenters of that
Province, I am afraid won't be taken upon Trust, from the bare
Assertion of a Man that writes in their defence, and that in an Age
when no Accounts of Writers are much farther allow'd than they
produce Vouchers for; but especially when they are in favour
of Dissenters, where the least Article is hardly to be taken upon
the best Credit. But I hope the Account which the Minister of the
Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> formerly a Non-Juror, that has
resided there for several Years, gives of them, may be allow'd to be
a good Authority. He has this remarkable Passage, in a Letter which
he writes to a Reverend Dean of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> Dr. <HI>St—nh—p,</HI>
a Copy whereof is hereunto annex'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 12.</NOTE> “<HI>And I a little favouring the
Dissenters, who generally are the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berest, most numerous and richest
People of this Province; Some Men that are now in Power have for that
reason been my Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>And for whose sake, I pray, must two Thirds of such Inhabitants
be driven away? Why truly if you will believe the same Authori∣ty,
which I think in this Case no body will dispute, 'tis for the sake of
a Set of the most <HI>irreligious, flagitious, tyrannical Men</HI> in the whole Pro∣vince;
who appropriate to themselves the Name of <HI>Church men,</HI> tho
they seldom or never go to Church themselves, have never receiv'd
the Sacrament these five Years; and have little other Pretensions to
this Title, than their unwearied Endeavours to prevent their scru∣pulous
and conscientions Neighbours from going to worship God any
where else. His Words are these in the same Letter, <HI>Our last Assembly
being composed of many Men of very loose and corrupt Morals,</HI> &amp;c. And in
his Petition to the Palatine and Proprietors of <HI>Carolina</HI> hercunto an∣nex'd,
he tells them, <HI>That he is sorry to inform their Lordships,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 13.</NOTE> <HI>that most of
the late Members of Assembly, have been constant Absenters from the Holy
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; tho for these five Years past he has ad∣ministred
it in his Church at least six times a Year: So that it is no wonder
they have inserted an absurd Oath in a late Act, to be taken by Members
of the Commons House of Assembly, instead of conforming to the Church
of</HI> England, <HI>by receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according
to the Rites of the said Church.</HI> And in another part of his Petition
he says, <HI>That many of the Members of the Commons House that past this
disqualifying Law, are constant absenters from the Church; and Eleven
of them were never known to receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper;
and so perhaps their Religion may be to seek.</HI> And the whole Petition
sufficiently sets forth their tyrannical Proceedings, of which we shall
give a farther and a more particular account. And in his Case
hereunto annexed, he calls them a set of <HI>illiterate and unreasonable</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N. 14.</NOTE>
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
<HI>Men:</HI> So that according to the Account of this Clergy-man, this
Act will be so far from letting out the ill Blood of <HI>Carolina,</HI> that it
will let out that good Blood, whose Office it is in the Opinion of
some <HI>Physicians</HI> to be the <HI>FraeEnum bilis,</HI> and to leave nothing but ill Hu∣mours
to over-run the Body without controul. 'I will be to sling
away the Salt of this Province, which is to be its Savor; and to give
up every thing there to Tastlesness or Corruption.</P>
<P>But in order to give the true Character of this Set of Men,
there is no necessity to quote any Works but their own. They
have drawn their Picture to the Life in this <HI>infamous Act,</HI> and in
several of their <HI>Proceedings</HI> that have pav'd the way to it. In
which we may plainly discover Irreligion and Oppression to be
the very Complexion and principal Lines of their Minds. But
in order to let the World see what were the Views that induc'd
this Faction to endeavour to obtain this Law, whose tendency
to ruin the Province must have been so obvious to them, as to make
them sensible that they themselves were at last to become Sharers in
the Calamity; it is necessary to let the World know the State of
<HI>Carolina</HI> at the time of their b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inging in this Bill into the Assembly.
And in order to give an Account of the State of this Province at that
time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> we must go as far back as the Year 1700. When upon the death
of Governour <HI>blake,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Moore</HI> procur'd himself to be elected
Governour in his room, by divers indirect and illegal Practices. This E∣lection
is made by the Council, which is compos'd of the Proprietors
Deputys: And they are the Heads of that Faction from which all the
M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erys of this Province chiefly proceed. They appear'd extreme∣ly
follicitous to put Power into this Man's hands, in hopes no doubt
to have it given back into their own; that so they might thereby have
an opportuaity to repair their broken Fortunes at the Expence of the
Publick. After they had by these Methods obtain'd a Governour,
whose Debts and Necessities were like to put him upon any violent
Measures, that could turn to the private Advantage of the Faction:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the first place made all his Efforts to <HI>fill up</HI> a <HI>Council;</HI> and in the
next place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> which was in the Year 1701. to obtain such a <HI>Commons
House</HI> of Assembly, as would be most subservient to his private
Views: Both of which he obtain'd accordingly, and the last by the
most illegal Elections and Returns,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> that perhaps a free Country ever
heard of. And to prevent a Redress of these undue Elections, he
<HI>arbitra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> proragu'd</HI> the Assembly several times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 2.</NOTE> when the Commons
House were enqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring into the said Elections. And when the Assem∣bly
was to be susserd to meet, in order to quiet the Clamours that
were amongst the People against such Arbitrary Proceedings, an
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
illegal, expensive, and hazardous Expedition, was propos'd against
Fort St. <HI>Augustine;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 3.</NOTE> partly to enrich themselves out of the Mony that
should be allowed for that Expedition, and out of the Booty that
should be taken;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 6.</NOTE> (tho, by Law, that ought to be divided amongst
the Soldiers) and partly to <HI>prevent</HI> an <HI>Enquiry</HI> into these undue Elec∣tions.
And that no body might attempt or move the same Enquiry
again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 10.</NOTE> nor oppose the said Expedition, the Assembly was deny'd the
<HI>Liberty of Free Debate.</HI> When it was propos'd in the House to con∣firm
the Fundamental Constitutions, which they knew would settle
the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 8.</NOTE> and prevent their Abuses; they <HI>ridicul'd them as void
and absurd</HI> in themselves, and not fit to be declar'd the Rule of the
Government: Tho it was by these very Constitutions, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Power of a Commons House of Assembly. But it was necessary
to keep the Province in this unsettled condition, on purpose that they
might have the better Pretence to act or not to act, according to the
said Constitutions, as it should best suit with their private Interest.
And as the said Governour and Council had prevented any Parlia∣mentary
Enquirys into Irregularitys, that had been committed in
past Elections and Returns to Parliament; so they <HI>rejected a Bill</HI> for
regulating Elections, and preventing the like Abuses for the future
(which passed twice through the Commons House) without so much
as a Conference.</P>
<P>And to terrify those Members who still stood up in the Commons
House, for the Dignity of that House, and the Libertys of the Pro∣vince,
a <HI>Riot</HI> was rais'd upon them by the Justices of the Peace, the
Militia Officers, and other Agents of the Governor and Council, to
their great Damage and Danger, in manifest Violation of the Liber∣ty
of the Subject, and of the Privileges of Parliament. And one
of the Commons House of Assembly was violently drag'd on board a
Ship, there unlawfully detain'd, and threatned to be hang'd or car∣ry'd
to <HI>Jamaica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> or left on some remote and desolate Island. As this
Riot was <HI>rais'd, encourag'd and countenan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d</HI> by the said Governor and
Council, and as no Asistance cou'd be obtain'd to quell it; so all
Methods to <HI>enquire</HI> into and <HI>punish</HI> the same have been render'd inef∣fectual,
and the Course of Justice entirely stopt. For Sir <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>Johnson</HI> was made Governor in the room of the said Governor
<HI>Moore;</HI> the said Governor <HI>Moore</HI> was presently made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ge∣neral,
and Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, another of the chief Abertors of the Riot,
the, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, who in this Proviace is sole
Judge. Sir <HI>Nath <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Johnson</HI> was General of the <HI>Leeward</HI> Islands in
the Reign of the late King <HI>James;</HI> but he quitted his Government
upon the Revolution, and retir'd to <HI>Carolina,</HI> where he liv'd private∣ly
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
till the Death of the late King <HI>James:</HI> Upon which he first took
the Oaths to the Government, and some time after was made Go∣vernor
of the Province. And he has since his being Governor ap∣pointed
such Sheriffs as prevent all Prosecutions of this Riot at their
Assizes or Quarter-Sessions (which are the only Courts of Justice in
this Province where Crimes of this Nature can be try'd, and where
the said Mr. <HI>Trott</HI> is sole Judg) by returning such Jurors as were known
Abettors of the said Riot. So that there is a total failure of Justice,
and nothing but Corruption in the whole Frame and Administration
of Government.</P>
<P>These Conspirators however saw that a new Parliament might set
all things to rights again. And therefore when the time of a new
Election came,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fundamen∣tal Consit∣utions, No. 2. §. 73.</NOTE> which, according to their Constitution, is once in
two years, they resolv'd to procure a Commons House of Assembly
of the same Complexion with the former, and by more illegal Prac∣tices,
if those they had us'd in the former Elections wou'd not do
their Business. Their Designs took effect, and such a Commons
House of Assembly was return'd, as fully answer'd their Expectations.
But because they saw that the illegal Methods they had taken at these
two Elections, and that they shou'd be fore'd to take in future Elections,
wou'd at length, when Men came to cool, set the Minds of all the Peo∣ple
against them; and that then a Parliament wou'd in all proba∣bility
be chosen that wou'd enquire into these Grievances, and take
effectual care to bring the Authors of them to condign Punishment;
therefore they now resolv'd to carry on their Violences <HI>by Law,</HI> and
cover and sanctify them by that usual Pretext. Knowing therefore,
that those who had been the most active in endeavouring to prevent
the Ruin of the Constitution, were Dissenters; and that if they
cou'd once exclude them the Commons House of Assembly, they
shou'd never be in Danger of being call'd to account, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
thus the Constitution of the Proviace in all its Paris, to their own
A varice and Ambition; because there is not a sufficient number of
moderate Churchmen in the Proviace, who are qualify'd by their la∣terest
and Figure for being chosen into the Commons House to out∣vote
their Faction; they brough' in this Bill to exclude Protess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>

<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
only obliges <HI>some</HI> Persons that shall hereafter be chosen Members of
the Commons House of Assembly, so to conform, and so to receive
the Sacrament. And whom does it so oblige? Why those who con∣scientiously
receive the Sacrament, according to its Institution, with
the Dissenters; but scruple to receive it, according to some Rites of
human Additions, in the Church; which are allow'd by the Church it
self to be indifferent, and scrupl'd by some of these Dissenters as un∣lawful.
And whom does it not oblige? Why those who impiously
refuse to receive it any where, and to prepare and fit themselves
rightly so to do, according to our Saviour's positive Injunction and
Command. Which is to exclude some conscientious Men out of the
Commons House, and to make an express Provision to keep in several
of those, who resolve to lead Lives, for which their own Conscien∣ces
reproach and condemn them. And this is the sense that the afore∣said
Clergyman has of this Act, who tells the Palatine and Proprietors,
in the Petition above quoted, <HI>That be cannot think it will be much for the
Credit and Service of the Church of</HI> England <HI>there, that a Door shou'd be so
directly open'd, and such Provision made for the most Loose and Prostigate

Oath appointed by the said Act.</HI></P>
<P>But to what <HI>Absurditys,</HI> to what <HI>Inconsistencys,</HI> to what <HI>Villany</HI> will
not Faction and Bigotry lead Men? Here is an Act, whose Title and
enacting Part do in such explicite and positive Terms contradict and
overthrow each other, as leaves no room for the blindest Charity to
excuse the Men who fram'd and pass'd it, from the most design'd
Cheat and Hypocrisy imaginable. Nor does the Title and Act com∣par'd
together contain all its Illusions. For the very Preamble of the
Act it self is founded upon two manifest Falshoods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <HI>That is hath seen
found by Experience,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and that by the Laws and Usage of</HI> England,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and is every whit as inconsistent with the Body of the Act, as
the Title is. For it asserts that nothing is more inconsistent with the
Christian Religion, and particularly with the Doctrine of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> than Persecution for Conscience only: And nevertheless
enacts, That every body shall be Persecuted who abstains from re∣ceiving
the Sacrament, according to certain Rites of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> for Conscience only. It asserts, That a Man may be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cere
Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essor of the Religion of the Chruch of <HI>England,</HI> and a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cere

<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Nor was this Bill fram'd to exclude Protestant Dissenters only the
Commons House of Assembly, but <HI>all moderate Churchmen,</HI> and to fill
the House with Men of the most high and violent Principles in the
Province. So much the Framers of this Act had it in their View to
strengthen a mere Faction, that arrogate to themselves the name of
Churchmen. For it takes all imaginable Care, that when by this
Act a Dissenter shall be turn'd out of the Commons House of Assem∣bly,
a Man of high and violent Principles may <HI>ipso facto</HI> suceed
him. For they do not enact, that upon a Dissenter's being turn'd out,
a new Writ shall issue, as in all Reason and Justice they ought to
have done, lest the County that sent a Dissenter, shou'd send a
Churchman, who shou'd prove as little to their prupose. But in∣stead
of ordering a new Writ to issue, order contrary to the very
nature of a fair Representation, that the Candidate, that had the
greatest Number of Votes next to the Dissenter, shall be the Repre∣sentative
of that County: Men of violent and persecuting Principles
being the Men that are usually Competitors with the Dissenters at
such Elections.</P>
<P>And thus they have secur'd the Commons House of Assembly to
their own Faction: And by securing that, they have, as far as the
nature of their Proprietary Constitution will permit, <HI>secur'd the Go∣vernment</HI>
entirely in their own Hands; they having no upper House,
consisting of an Hereditary Landed Nobility, as by both the first and
last fundamental Constitutions they ought to have. Instead of which,
their upper House consists only of the Deputys of the Proprietors,
who also compose the Council. By which means the Board of Pro∣prietors
have the power of three E'states, as well as all the executive
Power of the Province; whereas by their fundamental Constitutions
they ought to have but the Power of one. And thus the most equal
and best balanc'd Government, that perhaps ever was in the World,
where the several Parts of the Governement were the truest Checks
upon each other that con'd possibly be devis'd, is dwindled into a
single Faction subject to no Check or Controul.</P>
<P>Thus we see with what Views to the State this Act was past. And in∣deed
I scarce believe any body ever thought that this Act in <HI>Carolina,</HI>
or a Bill of a like Nature here, was ever design'd for the good of
the State; which all narrowing and secluding Laws must necessarily
weaken and enervate. Upon which account some were against a
Bill of a like Nature here in a time of War, that wou'd have been
for it, for the sake of the Church, in a time of Peace. Tho that only
amounts to this, That they were against weakening <HI>England</HI> in a time
of War, lest the Church shou'd suffer by it; but that they wou d
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
be for weakening it in a time of Peace, because the Church wou'd
then be out of Danger. Thus a Society, which some Men call the
Church, is set up as a Corporation within our selves, whose Interest
is directly inconsistent with the Good of the State; at the same time,
that it is thought superior to that of the State: Which it seems is to
be intirely subordinated to the Benefit and Advantage of this Soci∣ety,
whenever they come in competition. And tho the Sabbath was
made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath; yet it shou'd seem,
that, in their Opinion, Mankind was made for a Set of Men that
call themselves the Church, and not the Church for Mankind. So
that the only Dispute between those Men, who were against a Bill of
a like nature here, because it was a time of War, and those who
were for it, not withstanding it was a time of War, was only which
was most for the Benefit of this Corporation; whereas the Good of
<HI>England</HI> was quite out of the Question depending betwixt them.</P>
<P>But they might easily have seen that such an Act as that wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d have
put the <HI>Church,</HI> as it is a distinct Society from the State, into almost
as great Danger as the State it self. For it had put the Church intire∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
into the Hands of a Faction, which might have turn'd against the
Church it self, and set up for the Nonjuring or <HI>Galliean</HI> Church, or
have got the whole Ecclesiastical Power into their own Hands, and
have made a lay-Church, and themselves the Bishops of it. For when
a Tyrannical Power is once establish'd, the very Men that establish'd
it have no Security that they shan't be the first that shall feel its dire
Effects; or at least, that they shall not be drawn into and suck'd up
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a that bottomless and unsatiable Whirlpool. This I mention the
rather, because it is what has actually happen'd in <HI>Carolina.</HI> For the
very Faction that this Act has confirm'd and established there, has
since censur'd the Reverend Mr. <HI>Marsson,</HI> Minister of the Church o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>England</HI> in <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> for three Passages of a Sermon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by

<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
And they have since colour'd over their Violences against this
Clergyman by a Law, as they did their Violences against the Peo∣ple
in general, as has been before observ'd. And have since this
Censure and Ordinance brought in an Act, as prejudicial and fatal to
Episcopacy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 10.</NOTE> as the former was to the Toleration: A Copy of which
is hereunto annex'd. By which Act they have intirely wrested the
Jurisdiction over the Clergy, out of the Hands of the Bishop of
the Diocess, and have set up a High Commission Court, and given
themselves a merely Ecclesiastical Cognizance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the case of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. Mars<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere∣unto an∣nexd, N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 14.</NOTE> as it was notorious
they threatned they wou'd some time before they accomplish'd their
Design. And a much larger Cognizance it is, and a much greater
Power, than the Crown or the Bishops have over the Clergy here.
And however quietly this may be submitted to by the Diocesan,
now 'tis done by good Churchmen, yet 'tis easy to conceive what an
incredible Clamour this wou'd have rais'd, as a Design to ruin the
very Essence the Being of an Episcopal Church, if it had been done
by any others. But 'tis very evident, that Characters and Names are
first fix'd upon Men, and that all their Actions are judg'd of by
those Characters. And so it comes to pass, that some Men are ne∣ver
allow'd to do any thing for the Service of the Church, as others
can sanctity the greatest Sacrilege. Thus among the Pure, every
thing is pure; whilst by the Impure, every thing is desil'd. By this
means are the most illegal Practices against this Clergyman justify'd
by a Law, that is it self as illegal. And no body, I believe, that
takes this to be the Case, will at all wonder, that Men that have as∣sum'd
a Power to themselves so destructive of the Constitution of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> have since us'd that Power as injuriously as they
have acquir'd it, to the depriving this Gentleman <HI>ab Officio,</HI> as the
Commons House had done by an Ordinance, <HI>a Beneficio.</HI> For 'tis
to be observ'd, to this Clergyman's Honour, that he preach'd in his
Church as long as the Government wou'd allow him that Liberty,
after he had been, by the most complicated Injustice imaginable, de∣priv'd
of his Salary by an Ordinance of both Houses.</P>
<P>By all which it appears, that the sole view of that Set of Men, who have
abetted and pass'd this Act, was so far from being any design to restrain
the Dissenters for the Good of the Church or State, that it was nothing
but a Conspiracy to destroy the Dissenters, and every thing in their Civil
and Ecclesiastical Constitution, that did but restrain'em from an uncon∣trolable D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mination in the one and the other, in order to make them∣selves
by the Ruin of both. But every thing that did but check or re∣strain'em
being now remov'd out of the way, and the Faction having
ingross'd and perpetuated the whole Power of the Province in their
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
own hands, they found they had nothing to fear but from <HI>England;</HI>
where they knew a Redress of these Grievances might be obtain'd.
And they were so justly apprehensive lest these Arbitrary and Tyran∣nical
Proceedings should come under the Cognizance of the Queen
in Parliament, or in her Courts of <HI>Westminster-ball,</HI> whose Na∣ture
and Principles make Justice and Mercy the happy Temperature
of her Reign; that they took all imaginable Precautions to prevent
any Accounts of these intolerable Grievances from being sent hither
They were very sensible, that her Majesty, who takes care that the
meanest and the remotest of her good Subjects, as well as those who
have the Misfortune to differ from her, should find in so great a Mea∣sure
the Equity, and the Gentleness of her Administration; That She,
I say, would never suffer her free and liege People of <HI>Carolina</HI> to be
the only Persons who should unfortunately feel the heavy Yoke of
Persecution and Slavery.</P>
<P>They therefore in the first place were very watchful to prevent Mr.
<HI>A-b</HI> from coming over into <HI>England</HI> in behalf of these opprest People;
so that it was not without the greatest Hazard and Difficulty that he
got away from <HI>Carolina</HI> to <HI>Virginia,</HI> where he was forc'd to stay till
his Powers and Instructions could be convey'd after him. From thence
he came to <HI>England,</HI> and after he had been here some time, and made
earnest Application to the <HI>Palatine</HI> and the Board of Proprietors for
a Redress of these Grievances without any manner of Success, and
without any farther hopes of obtaining any, he resolv'd to have pub∣lish'd
a full Account of all these Grievances in a Pamphlet entitul'd,
The present State of <HI>Carolina.</HI> But he only liv'd to print a Sheet of
it;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> and his Papers being sent over to his Relations in <HI>Carolina</HI> by
Mr. <HI>M—sel—y</HI> his pretended Friend and Confident, were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
deliver'd to the Governor's Agents, and as treacherously received by
them. And they finding themselves justly expos'd in 'em, have sliss'd
and supprest 'em to the great Injury of his Relations, and the opprest
People of <HI>Carolina:</HI> Since the Account of a Gentleman so throughly
acquainted with their Constitution and the Violations of it, and who
was so sensibly touch'd with the Injuries he saw and felt in conse∣quence
of those Violations, must needs be but indifferently supply'd by
any other hand: Especially considering that the Governor and his
Agents have prosecuted and insulted several of the Inhabitants, and
particularly <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndgrave Smith,</HI> upon the account of some private Letters
which they sent to the said Mr. <HI>A—b,</HI> whilit he was in <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gini</HI> and
<HI>England,</HI> and which were sound among the Papers that were deliver'd
by the said Mr. <HI>M—sel—y</HI> to the Governor's Agents. And by
these and such like Methods they have terrify'd and fighten'd others
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
from sending the like Accounts. They take great care too to intercept
such Accounts as they can't intirely prevent; and deter us from printing
some of those Accounts we have, by the barbarous Usage they have given
to those, whom they have discover'd to have corresponded with the
said Mr. <HI>A—b.</HI> This Account of the Arbitrary Proceedings of the
Government against such as dare write their Mind too freely, will I
hope excuse it to the Reader, if some of the Accounts we have given
of the Grievances of <HI>Carolina,</HI> be not so clear or so well vouch'd as
might be wish'd; together with the Misfortune that befel two Ships,
which were coming from thence to <HI>England;</HI> by which, notwith∣standing
these Arbitrary Proceedings, some of the Principal Inhabi∣tants
had ventur'd to send a full Account of the present State of
things there to Mr. <HI>B—ne,</HI> the present Agent on their behalf. And
as Providence has favour'd the Authors of these Grievances by the loss
of these two Ships; so they hope by all the steps which they themselves
have taken, that they shall be skreen'd for ever <HI>from Justice, and</HI> that
they have <HI>perpetuated the Power of making and executing Laws</HI> in the
hands of a <HI>small Faction,</HI> that will not fail to <HI>enact both partial and en∣snaring
Laws,</HI> at the same time that they take care <HI>to execute the Laws</HI>
they make <HI>with the same partiality</HI> with which theymade them; and so
turn the whole <HI>Course of Justice</HI> into nothing but <HI>Favor and Oppression.</HI></P>
<P>To the Shame of the Protestant Religion, of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and the free Spirit of an <HI>Englishman,</HI> must such an Act and such
Practices as these for ever stand upon Record! Proceedings that per∣haps
the Jesuits, out of all the Archives which contain the History of
their bloody Contrivances and Machinations to propagate Slavery and
Superstition, can hardly produce any thing to out-shine! Proceedings
which will not only give just Scandal to all Christian People, but even
to the barbarous and savage Natives of the Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chapter N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p.<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> the their Conversion
to the Christian Faith is said to be one of the Motives which induc'd the
King to grant the Charter. But these Proceedings instead of converting
'em will justly <HI>scare 'em,</HI> and keep 'em at a distance from a Religion
whose Professors they find to be guilty of such Practices, or at least to
ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and countenance'em; instead of those convincing Methods of <HI>Gen∣tlen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss,
good Usage and Probity, sutable to the Rules and Designs of the Gospel,</HI>
by which, as the 97<HI>th</HI> § of the Fundamental Constitutions admirably
expresses it, they can alone be won over to embrace and unfeignedly
receive the Truth. And I hope all Men who have been celebrated for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons and Heads of the Church, as that its very Security has been
at least pretended to ebb and flow with their Power and Credit in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
I hope, I say, if any such have had any hand in passing this Bill, that
they will either disown what they have done, and convince the World
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
of the Sincerity of their Repentance, by undoing what they have so
unjustly done; or if they will not, that in Justice to the Church of
<HI>England</HI> they will disown her, or at least that she will for her own
Honour disown them. And if any of the Persons who have had
any hand in passing this Bill, have any design to bring in a Bill of a like
Nature here; 'tis to be hop'd, that the Dissenters in <HI>Carolina</HI> will at
least gain their Assistance by that means towards the repealing it there,
till the like Act be obtain'd here. Since 'tis certain that the Me∣thods
by which this Bill has been obtain'd there, and the Effects it has
produc'd, are very far from recommending it to any true Friend of
our Constitution in Church or State.</P>
<P>Thus it appears what the Men are that this Act will in all Probabi∣lity
drive out of that Province, and what sort of Men they are that
drive 'em out of it. Let us see then the Ruin and Destruction that
must necessarily ensue upon its being abandon'd, by such a Number of
such Inhabitants as this Act alone will drive away; without reckoning
those that may be driven away by the other Infractions upon their
Constitution in Church and State, that have both preceded and fol∣low'd
it. And even the Depopulation that this Act will produce, must
necessarily be the utter <HI>Ruin</HI> of that Colony. For the Riches of a
Country are its Productions, which are to be barter'd for other Pro∣ductions,
of other Parts of the World. Its Productions are the
Effects of Industry, and Industry the necessary Effect of the Number
and Increase of Inhabitants. So that if you hinder the Increase and
lessen the Number of the People, you abate and put a stop to all the
rest. When the Hands are gone, that us'd to manure the Land,
clean the Rice, and graze the Cattle; and when the Merchants are
remov'd, that dealt in Furs, Pitch, Tar, Corn, Slaves and Negroes,
with other profitable Commodities, what will Proprietorships,
Signiorys, Baronys and Colonys be worth? And what will become
of the Revenue of Industry, that arises from the very Management of
these several Branches of Trade?</P>
<P>The <HI>first Proprietors</HI> were so sensible that nothing could people that
Province, and enrich it, but an Universal and Absolute Toleration,
that they made the most express and ample Provision for such a To∣leration,
that ever was made in any Constitution in the World.
As may be seen § 96,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> 101, 102, 106. of the fundamental Consti∣tutions
of <HI>Carolina:</HI> Which I am satisfy'd will give a sensible Pleasure
to all true Friends to Liberty, who have not seen those Paragraphs, to
peruse. And that which is the more remarkable, is, that this ample
Provision was made by several of the Proprietors, who were at that
time <HI>chief Instruments of the Persecution</HI> that was carried on against
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
the Protestant Dissenters here, as the <HI>Lord Chancellor Clarendon,</HI> the
<HI>Duke of Albermarle,</HI> Master of the Horse, and others: Well knowing,
that how much soever it might be for their private Interest to insti∣gate
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. to prosecure his Protestant dissenting Sub∣jects
in <HI>England,</HI> and to promote those Prosecutions as much as they
cou'd, in order to keep the Places and Power of <HI>England</HI> in their own
hands, that so they might make their Fortunes at the Expence of the
Publick; yet that nothing but the largest and best secur'd Toleration
cou'd ever make a Country, of which they were the Proprietors, turn
to a good account. And tho this Conduct does not much commend
their Faithfulness, as Stewards to the King or the Publick; yet it
makes their prudent management of a Province, which they were
to govern for themselves, the more conspicuous. Nor did this uni∣versal
and absolute Toleration disappoint and frustrate their Ex∣pectations:
For tho <HI>Carolina</HI> wants a good Port, and is without some
other things that wou'd promote and facilitate Trade, yet by virtue of
this ample Toleration, and its Security in such an equal Constitution of
Government, it became one of the most flourishing of all our Colonys.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Successors</HI> of the first Proprietors seem to have been so
sensible, that nothing could tend more to the making this Colony
rich and prosperous, than pursuing the same Measures, that they re∣solv'd
upon confirming the Toleration that was at first granted.
For in the Constitutions they sent over in the Year 1669. tho they left
out the greatest part of the 96<HI>th</HI> Paragraph of the first Fundamental
Constitutions, because they design'd to reduce those Constitutions to a
smaller number; yet they left out nothing but what was barely in∣troductory
to the Constituting and Ordaining part of that very Para∣graph;
but have left the Ordaining part it self intire: And so they
have all the other Paragraphs which were just now cited out of the
first Fundamental Constitutions; which together with the 102<HI>d</HI> and
106<HI>th</HI> Paragraphs, may be seen in the last Fundamental Constitu∣tions,
§. 27<HI>th,</HI> 31<HI>st,</HI> 32<HI>d,</HI> 36<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>principal Merchants</HI> in <HI>London</HI> trading to <HI>Carolina</HI> were so
sensible how prejudicial breaking in upon the Toleration there must
be to the good of the Country in general, and to trade in particular,
that they sign'd a Petition to the Lord <HI>Gr—nu—lie</HI> their present Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine,
and the rest of the Proprietors, representing how prejudicial it
won'd be to the true Interest of that Colony upon many accounts; and
p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying that they would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isallow the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Copy where for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> anne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, No. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> and order its Repeal.
Which Petition they lodg'd in the hands of Mr. <HI>B—ne</HI> the Agent
here on behalf of the oppress'd People of that Province. But he found
the said Palatine so resolv'd to pass this Act, that he saw it was to no
purpose to deli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it to him.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28"/>
But tho the <HI>present Palatine</HI> has pursu'd quite different Measures
from all his Predecessors; and has obtain'd the Confent of a majo∣rity
of that Board of Proprietors, which was summon'd and met up∣on
that occasion, to consirm this unprecedented Law; and tho 'tis
most the Business of the rest of the Proprietors to enquire, whether
these Measures of his are the effect of want of due consideration, and
a true knowledg of his Interest, or of sheer Bigotry and Faction;
or whether the Party his Excellency is pleas'd to <HI>head and coun∣tenance,</HI>
as he has thought fit to express himself, have any secret
Ways to recompense him for gratifying them at the Expence of
his own apparent Interest and Obligations: Yet I believe every
considering Person will think it the Business of the Government to
take care, that by such Methods as these, a flourishing Colony be not
dep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pulated; and that a very useful and beneficial Trade, which
<HI>England</HI> drives with that Colony, and which that Colony drives
with <HI>England,</HI> and several of the Plantations, to the raising her Ma∣jesty's
Customs, as well as to the great conveniency and enriching
of her Majesty's Subjects, be not discourag'd or interrupted.</P>
<P>Thus it appears how great an Instance of Ingratitude to the Dis∣senters
this Act is; and how highly prejudicial to the Queen, to
Trade, to the Proprietors and the Inhabitants of <HI>Carolina.</HI> And the
Ingratitude and destructive Nature of this Act to the true Interest of
that Province, does not only six those Characters upon the Act it
self, but upon those that pass'd it; since its Injustice and Oppression
are too obvious for almost any one not to have seen, that did not
wilfully shut his Eyes. But however it might perhaps be said, to ex∣cuse
them from being conscious of the Injustice and Oppression of
this Act, that it is barely possible for those that pass'd it to have been
ignorant of the generous Behaviour of the Dissenters; and to have
been so perfectly injudicious and unexperienc'd in publick Affairs, as
to imagine that to be for the Good of the Country, which must ine∣vitably
prove its Ruin; or to have been so set upon doing something,
that according to their Prejudices and mistaken Notions might be for
the Service of the Church, as to have intirely forgot and over look'd
the Civil Interest of the Province. I say, all this might be said in
excuse of this Act, and those that pass'd it, if it were not a <HI>Breach of
the ex, uss Original Contract</HI> between the Proprietors and the People
of <HI>Carolina.</HI> But if this Act appears to be a Breach of that Contract,
I think, as nothing further need to be said against the Act, so nothing
can be said in vindication of the Makers of it. For when Men come
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
once to breaking of Faith, tho plighted in the most solemn manner
that can be devis'd; let it be broke with Hereticks or Schismaticks,
or whom you please, and let it be done never so much for the Service
of God and his Church; I think, I say, such Men can't have the good
Opinion of any Protestant any longer, or easily obtain it of any disin∣terested
one, to stand up in their Vindication or Excuse.</P>
<P>I suppose't will be easily allow'd to me, in order to make good this
Charge, that any Law of <HI>Carolina</HI> that contradicts the <HI>Charter,</HI> or
the fundamental Constitutions of that Province, is a Breach of the
Original Contract between the Proprietors and the People. For
tho the two Charters (which do but grant different Parcels of Land,
but are else <HI>verbatim</HI> the same) being Grants from the Crown to the
Proprietors, of all the Title, Powers and Privileges which they
have as Proprietors of <HI>Carolina</HI> upon certain Conditions, is imme∣diately
a Contract between the Sovereign and the Proprietors; up∣on
which account any thing done by the Proprietors against the Char∣ter
is a Forfeiture of the Charter, upon which a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> will
lie: Yet several of the Limitations in that Charter being Provisions
made by the Sovereign, in favour of his Liege and Free People who
shou'd transplant themselves thither, and in Justice to those Inhabi∣tants
who were already there, and were not subject to the Title,
Powers and Privileges granted by such Charter, nor cou'd not be
made subject to the said Title, Powers and Privileges, without
their own Consent; therefore all such Limitations of the Proprie∣tors,
in favour of the People, may be consider'd as tacit Stipulations
of the Proprietors with the People themselves: Since they have sub∣mitted
to the Proprietors, or transplanted themselves to the Colony,
upon the just Presumption, that the Proprietors wou'd act pursuant
to such Provisoes and Limitations.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>fundamental Constitutions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sec. the Breamble to the first Fundamen∣tal consti∣tution, N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2. See also §. 120. of the said Constitu∣tions.</NOTE> they being the Rule of Go∣vernment,
which, pursuant to the Charters, the first Proprietors oblig'd
themselves their Heirs and Successors to observe perpetually, in the most
binding ways that cou'd be devis'd, in case the People shou'd accept 'em;
if the People hereupon did accept 'em, they immediately became an ex∣press
Contract between the Proprietors and the People; and must ne∣cessarily
be consider'd as such. Accordingly they were thought so good
a Rule of Government by those who were settled there before the
Grant of this Charter, and by several here, who transplanted them∣selves
thither, in considence that they wou'd be observ'd as the per∣petual
Rule and Form of Government, that they were respectively
sworn to or subscrib'd by all those that continu'd in <HI>Carolina,</HI> or came
to settle there, as the fundamental Constitutions of the Province:
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
And no Person cou'd become a Freeman, or enter upon any Office,
or vote or act in either House of Assembly, that had not first sworn
to them, or subscribed them, according to the Provision made in
the 117 § of the said Constitutions: Which runs thus, <HI>Nor shall
any Person, of what Condition or Degree soever, above seventeen years
old, have any Estate or Possession in</HI> Carolina, <HI>or Protection or Benefit
of the Law there, who hath not before a Precinct-Register subscrib'd these
Fundamental Constitutions.</HI></P>
<P>By which means the Proprietors became for ever bound to observe
these Constitutions, as the perpetual Rule of their Government, and can
never become disengag'd, till all such of the People, as have consented to
'em, consent to repeal 'em, in the same manner in which they consented
to them; that is to say, till they consent to repeal them <HI>in Person.</HI> For
their <HI>Consent by their Representatives</HI> can never be thought sufficient,
unless Representatives were chosen on purpose to consent to repeal
the present fundamental Constitutions, or settle new Constitutions,
as to them shou'd seem most meet and convenient. For a Represen∣tative
of the People is no farther a Representative than he is de∣sign'd
to represent them. Now the Representatives of the People
of <HI>Carolina</HI> are chosen by their Principals, pursuant to these Consti∣tutions,
and are chosen to act in representing them, only in pursu∣ance
of these Constitutions. And accordingly it is provided by the
Constitutions, §. 77. <HI>That if any proprietor or his Deputy, before the Palatine
or his Deputy's Consent be given to an Act of Parliament, shall enter his Pro∣testation
against the said Act, as contrary to any of the fundamental
Constitutions; that in such Case, after a full and free Debate, the se∣veral
Estates shall enter into four several Chambers, and if the Majority
of any of the four Estates shall vote that the Law is not agreeable to these
fundamental Constitutions, then it shall pass no further, but be as if it
had never been propos'd.</HI> By which the Parliament of <HI>Carolina</HI> plainly
appears to be ty'd up by these Constitutions, and to have no power to
give them up, or to consent to their being repeal'd. So that it is very
plain that the Parliament of <HI>Carolina</HI> can no more consent to alter or
give up the fundamental Constitutions of <HI>Carolina,</HI> than the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>England</HI> can give up <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> or the very Being and
Power of Parliaments.</P>
<P>But it is farther to be consider'd, that there is <HI>no Parliament</HI> properly
speaking in <HI>Carolina.</HI> For there is no Upper House, consisting of the
Hereditary Landed Nobility of that Province, <HI>viz.</HI> Landgraves and
Cassiques, as by the fundamental Constitutions there ought to be. And
they are the only Men that have any right to lay claim to the Stile and
Powers of the Upper House. Indeed the Deputys of the Proprietors
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
arrogate to themselves the Stile and Powers of the Upper House; but
they, or any other Set of Men than the Landgraves and Cassiques, may
as well pretend to be the Proprietors or the Commons House, as the
Upper House of Parliament of that Province. And therefore the
Preamble to the fundamental Constitutions, that were drawn up in
1968,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 3.</NOTE> and sent over by Major <HI>Daniel,</HI> runs thus: <HI>We the Lords Pro∣prietors,
with the Consent and Advice of the Landgraves and Cassiques,
and Commons in this present Parliament assembled,</HI> &amp;c. A certain Argu∣ment
that the Proprietors were satisfy'd that these Constitutions
cou'd not be settled, nor the other repeal'd, without the Advice, at
least, of the Landgraves and Cassiques, as well as the Commons in
Parliament assembled. So that there being no Upper House of Parli∣ament
in <HI>Carolina,</HI> the Proprietors can never be releas'd from the
first fundamental Constitutions, tho a Parliament should be thought
to have the Power to release them; because without an Upper House
there is no Parliament.</P>
<P>But so far is it from being true, that the Parliament of <HI>Carolina</HI>
has ever consented to the repealing these Constitutions of 1669,
that the very <HI>Commons House of Assembly with the Depu'ys of the
Proprietors,</HI> who arrogate to themselves the Stile and Power of the
Upper House, have never consented to repeal them. So that ei∣ther
these are their Constitutions, or they have none at all. And
if it be <HI>pretended that they have none at all,</HI> I would fain know how
any of them came by any of the Property they are now seiz'd
of? By what Power the People ever met to chuse Men to repre∣sent
them in the Commons House of Assembly? By what Power
the Sheri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s return'd them? Or by what Power such a Number of
Men assum'd to themselves the Stile or Power of a Commons House of
Assembly? All of which must have been prior to all Laws. So that
'tis certain, that the Fundamental Constitutions of 1609, common∣ly
call'd the first Fundamental Constitutions, are and remain the Fun∣damental
Constitutions of <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed the Proprietors agreed to some <HI>other Fundamental Constitu∣tions,</HI>
commonly call'd the last Fundamental Constitutions; and sent
them over by Major <HI>Damd</HI> in the year 1698,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> to <HI>be confirm'd, by and with
the Consent of the Hereditary Nobility, Landgraves and Cassiques, and the
Commons in Parl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iament assembled,</HI> tho very little disse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g in any thing
but length from those of 16<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>9. But these never were confirm'd in
Parliament, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is there any Parliament (of which Landgraves and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> compose one House) to confirm them. So that there is not
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etence to say that these of 1698, are the fundamental
Constitution of <HI>Carolina,</HI> or that those of 1669 are not.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>
Thus it appears that the Charters and the Fundamental Constitu∣tions
of 1669, are the original Contract between the Proprietors
and the People: Let us see then how this Contract has been bro∣ken
by this disqualifying Act. And the <HI>Inconsistency</HI> of this Act
with this Contract, will appear very plainly, if we consider the
Matter and Form of this Law, and the Manner of obtaining it. The
<HI>Act it self</HI> is absolutely inconsistent with the <HI>Charter of</HI> K. <HI>Charles</HI> II.
<HI>That Charter empowers the Proprietors to make,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Charter, p. 3. col. 1. hereunto am<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d, N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1.</NOTE> <HI>ordain and enact Laws;
only of and with the Advice, Assent and Approbation of the Freemen of
the said Province, or of the greater part of them, or of their Delegates
or Deputys.</HI> Now by this Act the Commons House of Assembly
may happen to be so compos'd, as that there shall not be <HI>one De∣puty</HI>
or Delegate of the Freemen of the Province in it. For by
this Act it may so happen, that not one that shall sit there, shall
have a Majority of the Votes of the Freemen; without which,
I suppose, 'twill not be pretended that any one is a Deputy or
Delegate. For upon supposition that a Dissenter shou'd stand
for every Place that has a Right to send a Deputy or Delegate to
Parliament, and should have never so great a Majority of Votes
in all those Places, and be return'd; yet upon the Meeting of
the Commons House of Assembly, they ought all to quit their
Seats, pursuant to this Act; and those Candidates, who had the
next Majority of Votes to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Act, c. u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> must fill their Places, tho per∣haps
they had not the half of the Votes, that the Delegate had,
being a Dissenter.</P>
<P>And tho perhaps it will be said, that I have put a Case which
can never happen; because if it shou'd happen, that all the Members,
that shou'd be return'd to Parliament, should be Dissenters, they
would repeal this Law, and continue themselves the first thing
they did; yet if this shou'd be done, in such Case, 'tis what ac∣cording
to this Act cou'd not be done. And at least this Absurdi∣ty
will follow, that, in such Case, according to Law the Com∣mons
House of Assembly would consist of a Body of Men legally
return'd, in which there was not one Delegate of the People.
And it may in <HI>Fact</HI> happen according to this Act, that the Pro∣prietors
may make Laws without a Majority of the Delegates of
the Freemen, all the Delegates being present; which is a Case as
much against the Charter as the other. The Commons House of
Assembly in <HI>Carolina</HI> consists of Thirty: Let us suppose then Four∣teen
of these Thirty, duly return'd by the Sher<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, to be Dissen∣ters;
the other Sixteen must turn them out, and vote those Can∣didates
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
into the House, who had the greatest Number of Votes
next to them, in their Places. In that case the House wou'd con∣sist
of sixteen Delegates and fourteen Men, who are no more De∣legates,
than they are Nobility or Proprietors. Let us further
suppose one of the sixteen to die, and then before his Place
cou'd be fill'd, the House would consist of fifteen Delegates and four∣teen
Men, who in reality are no Delegates. Let us then suppose a
Bill to be brought into the Commons House, thus compos'd and
constituted; and let us suppose one of the Delegates (whom we
will farther suppose to be the Speaker) with the fourteen Men who
are no Delegates, to be for this Bill, and the other fourteen Dele∣gates
to be against it: In this Case, the House being equally divided,
the Speaker with the fourteen Men, who are no Delegates, wou'd
carry this Bill against the fourteen Delegates; and so a Bill wou'd
pass thro the Commons House, with the Advice and Consent of but
one Delegate against fourteen.</P>
<P>But if so great a Breach and Violation of the Charter should never
happen to the Freemen by this disqualifying Act, as may happen in
the Cases which we have just now put; yet whenever this Act is put
in execution, and a Man that has a Minority is voted into the House in
pursuance of this Act, there will be an utter Defeating of the Right
the Freemen of the respective Countys have to a <HI>Representation,</HI> pursu∣ant
to the said Charter. For a Man, who is not chosen by the Majo∣rity,
is no more a Representative, than a Proprietor, or any thing else.</P>
<P>Thus this Act appears to be inconsistent with the Charter, in as
much as, by virtue of it, Laws may be made without the Advice
and Consent of the Freemen, or their Delegates: But neither is it
consistent with the Charter for the Proprietors to make what Laws
<HI>they please, with the Consent of the said Freemen or their Delegates.</HI> For
the Charter restrains the said Proprietors to the making of such Laws
only, of and with the Advice and Consent of the Freemen, as shall
be consonant to Reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed Charter, p. 4. col. 2.</NOTE> and agreeable, as near as may be, to the
Laws of <HI>England.</HI> Let us enquire then whether this Act be not in∣consistent
with these Restrictions and Provisoes.</P>
<P>The first of these Restrictions is <HI>Consonancy to Reason;</HI> by which two
things are chiefly intended: That the Laws made of and with the Ad∣vice
of the Freemen should be founded in Equity and Justice, and that
they should be for the Advantage and Service of the Publick. But is
the excluding Protestant Dissenters the Commons House of Assembly
<HI>founded in Equity and Justice?</HI> Is it just or equitable to exclude those
from so high a Trust, who have as great a share of that which is to
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
be intrusted as any there? Is it just to exclude two Thirds of the
Inhabitants for the sake of one? Is it equitable to deprive them
of the High Trusts of that Province, who bear by far the greater
share of its Burdens? Is it fair to deprive those of this Privi∣lege,
who transplanted themselves thither, to the great Danger
and Hazard of their Lives and Effects; and became subject to the
Proprietors, upon the Prospect of being equally capable of this
Privilege with the rest of their Neighbours? Or is it reasonable,
to make those incapable, that are every way as capable as any,
and that are by far more capable than some who remain so? To
put a Mark of Disgrace upon those who have done nothing to
deserve it? And to raise Fears and Apprehensions in those who
ought to live with the Peace and Quiet of Mind, that belongs to an
<HI>English</HI> Subject?</P>
<P>And from what has been said before, it must follow, that this
Law is as far from being for the <HI>Advantage and Interest</HI> of that Pro∣vince,
as Persecution is from being for its Advantage in general;
and that it is particularly as far from being for its Interest,
as it can be to seclude a Body of Men from ever advising with
the Properietors about making and ordaining Laws, who are
as well fitted by their Prudence, Integrity and Interest, to advise
with 'em, as any in the Province. In one word, 'tis as much
against the Interest of that Province, as a Persecution can be,
that will drive away two Thirds of the Inhabitants, which in
all don't exceed 10000 Souls, out of a Country, which is inha∣bited
from North to South about 150 Miles, and about 50 from
East to West: And which must in Reason, as it has in Fact, end in
establishing the Government in a Faction, to the utter Ruin of
the Constitution in Church and State: And that can end in nothing,
but driving away the best, and leaving only the worst of the few
Inhabitants, that shall remain.</P>
<P>The other Restriction is, <HI>Agreeableness as near as may be to the
Laws of</HI> England. This the Framers of this Act were so sensible
of, that they found this Act upon the Supposition that the like Act
is in force in <HI>England:</HI> A plain Intimation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the l'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>amble to the Act, N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 6. p. 38.</NOTE> that they knew that
this Act cou'd not be valid without it. However false the Asser∣tion
is, yet, I suppose, the Framers of this Act had positive Infor∣mation,
that after the Occasional Bill should pass here (which their
Correspondents it seems were very sure of) that another would pass
for excluding the Dissenters the House of Commons. And tho, God
be prais'd, their Information prov'd false; yet it lets us farther into
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
the secret Designs of the Authors and Promoters of the Occa∣sional
Bill here, than they cou'd ever yet be brought to own.
But it has been an old Observation, that under some Admini∣strations,
the best home News was always to be seen in the Arti∣cles
from <HI>Paris:</HI> And I believe it has been this once as true of
the Accounts from <HI>Carolina:</HI> And perhaps the farther Laws and
Preceedings there will confirm this Observation, and will give us
the best Light into the Steps that were to have been taken here,
if the Predictions which were sent to <HI>Carolina</HI> about a Bill of the
same nature in <HI>England,</HI> in order to give the better face to this Bill
there, had come to pass.</P>
<P>Nor is this Act more inconsistent with the Charter, than with the
<HI>Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina.</HI> They provide, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 97, 101.
<HI>That</HI> since the Natives of that Place, who will be concern'd in our Plan∣tations,
are utter Strangers to Christianity, whose Idolatry, Ignorance,
or Mistake, gives us no Right to expel or use them ill; and that those
who remove from other Parts to plant there, will unavoidably be of dif∣ferent
Opinions concerning Matters of Religion, the Liberty whereof they
will expect to have allow'd them; and <HI>that</HI> it will not be reasonable for
us on this account to keep them out, <HI>therefore</HI> that Civil Peace may
be maintain'd amidst the diversity of Opinions, and our Agreement
and Compact with all Men may be duly and faithfully observ'd, the
Violation whereof, upon what pretence soever, cannot be without great Of∣fence
to Almighty God, and great Scandal to the true Religion which we
profess: And also that Jews, Heathens, and other Dissenters from the
Purity of Christian Religion, may not be scar'd and kept at a distance from
it; but by having an opportunity of acquaninting themselves with the
Truth and Reasonableness of its Doctrines, and the Peaceableness and Inof∣sensiveness
of its Professors, may by good Usage and Persuasion, and all
those convincing Methods of Gentleness and Meekness, sutable to the Rules
and Design of the Gospel, be won over to embrace, and unfeignedly rec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive
the Truth. <HI>Therefore the said Constitutions among other things
provide, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 101. That</HI> no Person above seventeen Years of Age, shall have
any benefit or protection of the Law, or be capable of any place of Pro∣fit
or Honour, which is not a Member of some Church or Profession,
having his Name recorded in some one religious Record at once. <HI>The
Constitutions therefore require nothing more to make any Per∣son
capable of any Place of profit or Honour, than to be a Mem∣ber
of some Church or Profession, and to have his Name in some
one, and but one religious Record at once. So that this Act that</HI>
requires <HI>Men to be of the Profession of the Church of</HI> England <HI>only,
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
to make them capable of sitting in the Commons House of Assem∣bly,
is a direct violation of these Fundamental Constitutions. And
as the Ordaining part of this Act is a violation of them, so is the</HI>
Preamble <HI>too, upon which the ordaining part of this Act is built.
For that supposes, that the best way to prevent Contentions, and
Animosities in the Commons House of Assembly, upon the ac∣count
of different Persuasions and Interests in Matters of Religion,
is to make Persons of a different Persuasion, incapable of the Ho∣nour
of</HI> sitting <HI>there. Whereas the</HI> 97th <HI>and the</HI> 101 st <HI>Paragraphs
assert,</HI> That to maintain Civil Peace amidst the diversities of Opinions,
<HI>the best way is to</HI> require nothing more to make Men capable of any Places
of Honour or Profit, than to be of some one Profession or other.</P>
<P>Thus we see upon how many Accounts this Act it self is inconsi∣stent
with the Original Contract. Nor is it less so upon the account
of those <HI>illegal and undue Methods</HI> by which it was obtain'd: So that
had this Act been never so consonent to Reason, and agreeable to
the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> yet it had been <HI>ipso facto</HI> void, because it
was obtain'd in a manner directly contrary to other Provisions of
the Charter, and of the Fundamental Constitutions. For it was
in the first place pass'd without the Advice and Consent of those,
without whom no Law can pass in <HI>Carolina.</HI> For it is provided by
the Fundamental Constitutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fund. Const. N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 9, 71.</NOTE> That the Parliament of <HI>Carolina</HI>
shall consist of <HI>Landgraves and Cassiques</HI> (who are by their Dignity
to have Right of Session, and are the Hereditary Nobility of <HI>Caro∣lina</HI>)
as well as of Proprietors and Freeholders; and that no Act
shall pass but with their Consent and Advice. But this Act was obtain'd
without so much as calling the said Landgraves and Cassiques; so far
was this Act from passing with their Advice and Consent. By which
it is plain, that this is no more an Act of <HI>Carolina,</HI> than an Act pass'd
by the Queen, with the Advice of the Commons, without the Advice
of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, would be a law of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And as this Act was past without the Advice and Consent
of those who ought to have been call'd; so it was in the next
place pass'd by <HI>those who had no Right</HI> to Ordain or Enact any
Law or Ordinance whatsoever. The Charter gives the Proprietors
power to pass Laws consonant to Reason, and agreeable, as near as
may be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charter, N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 1. p. Col. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>un Con N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>2.</NOTE> to the Laws of <HI>England; only by and with the Advice of the
Freemen, or of the majority of the said Freemen, or of their</HI> Delegates.
And the Fundamental Constitutions require, that every Man that
chuses a Member of Parliament, shall have fifty Acres of Free∣hold.
But this disqualifying Act was pass'd by Delegates, who were
chosen in <HI>Berkley</HI>-County (which sends Twenty out of the Thirty
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
that compose that whole Commons House of Assembly) by Jews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Repr. N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 5. Art. 18.</NOTE>
Strangers, Sailors, Servants, Negroes; and by almost every French∣man,
who never profer'd themselves to take the Oaths of Alle∣giance
(which was the only thing requir'd of them, in order to
their Naturalization) in <HI>Craven</HI> and <HI>Berkley</HI>-County. All these
Votes were taken by the Sheriff, according to express Instructions
from some in the Government, as the said Sheriff publickly con∣fess'd.
And the Candidates they voted for were Return'd by the
Majority that such illegal Votes gave them, to the great Prejudice
of the other Candidates, and the Freemen and Free-holders of
the said Countys. Nor has there been any Redress to be had in
the Commons House of Assembly against these undue Elections and
Returns.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding that the Commons House of Assembly was
compos'd of Members so unduly Chosen and Return'd; yet as bad as it
was, the Faction saw, they should not be able to get this Act to pass
that House, but by surprize. Wherefore the Governor, Sir <HI>Nath.
Johnson,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Address, No. 7. Col. 1.</NOTE> prorogu'd the Assembly, after it had met, to the 10<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May.</HI>
The Assembly was disperst, and several of the Members went to
their respective Countys, and order'd their Affairs so, as that they
might be able to return when the Prorogation should expire.
But all on a sudden, contrary to the very nature of a Progroga∣tion,
they were call'd together by Proclamation, to sit on the
26th of <HI>April.</HI> But that the Members might not be too much
alarm'd, the Assembly was continu'd together Seven or Eight days,
with little or no Business before them. But on the 4th of <HI>May,</HI>
when the Members at a distance were under no apprehension of
any Matter coming upon the Stage, which should induce them to
return, to the great Inconveniency of their own Business, before
the said 10<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May;</HI> I say, upon the said 4<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> this Bill
was brought into the Commons House of Assembly, and hurry'd
so precipitately through that House, that it past the 6<HI>th,</HI> four days
before the Time came, to which they were prorogu'd; and conse∣quently
<HI>four days before any legal Assembly cou'd be held.</HI> By this means
there were never above Twenty three Members of the Commons
House present from the 26<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May.</HI> From
whence it follows, that almost one Fourth of the House must have
been absent: And of the Twenty three that were present, there
was but One more for it than against it; and several of those
that were against it, were Members of the Church of <HI>England.</HI>
And if the other Seven had been there, the Bill had, in all pro∣bability,

never pass'd: So that it could never have <HI>got thro the wor st
Commons House</HI> that ever sat in <HI>Carolina,</HI> but by such <HI>like illegal
Practices,</HI> as had procur'd the Elections and Returns of the Majority of
those that compos'd it.</P>
<P>And to the rest of these Arbitrary Proceedings, the Upper House
added that of the refusing <HI>Landgrave Joseph Morton,</HI> a Deputy to
one of the Proprietors, the Liberty of entring his <HI>Protestation</HI> and
Dissent: Notwithstanding that there is an express Provision made
for a Liberty of protesting in the 77<HI>th</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Fundamental Consti∣tutions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 2.</NOTE>
Nor is a Deputy's Right of Protesting only the bare
empty Privilege, to have it stand upon Record, that he did not
give his Consent to such a Law; but is the Foundation of putting
a Question to each of the several Estates separately, whether the
Act be not contrary to the Fundamental Constitutions, and of a Right
that the Majority of any of the Estates have in such case to the
rejecting the said Act; as may be fully seen in the said 77<HI>th</HI> Paragraph.</P>
<P>But that it may appear that this Act wants nothing that can
tend to make it the most finish'd Piece of Injustice, of any thing that
ever had the Face of Law; it must be noted, that it is not only illegal
upon the account of the Matter of the Law, and the Methods of
obtaining it; but upon the account of its very <HI>Form and Stile.</HI> For
there is first of all an Usurpation of the Regal Authority in the
Stile of the Act. For it runs thus: Be it enacted by his Excellency
<HI>John Lord Granville,</HI> and the rest of the true <HI>and absolute Lords and
Proprietors of</HI> Carolina: A Stile never assum'd by them till very
lately. Nor can it be pleaded in Vindication of this Stile, that they
are stil'd so in the Charter: For there they are stil'd so with two
Savings, neither of which are here exprest:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 1. p. 2 col. 2.</NOTE> The one of the Right
of the Crown, the other of the <HI>English</HI> Subjects settl'd there at the
time of the granting the Charter, if there were any.</P>
<P>And as it has too much upon this Account to have the Form of an Act
of <HI>Carolina;</HI> so it has too little upon another. For this Act is not said
to be enacted by the Palatine, and the rest of the Proprietors <HI>by and
with the Advice of the Landgraves and Cassiques,</HI> as 'tis plain all their Acts
should run; as fully appears by the Form of the Preamble to the
first and second Fundamental Constitutions: But instead of being
enacted in this Form, it is only said to be enacted by the Authority
of the Palatine, and the rest of the Proprietors, by and with the
Advice and Consent of the <HI>rest of the Members of the General Assembly.</HI>
A Stile altogether as new as is that of the Proprietors. By all
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
which it plainly appears, that it is almost impossible for any Act to
have any Absurdity or Illegality that this has not.</P>
<P>And tho it very much imports the Palatine, and the Proprietors to
take Care to inform themselves of the true State of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and to be
watchful in discovering and rectifying any Abuses that may creep into
the Administration of Government there; both in a just Regard to their
own true Interest, and Obligations to the Interest of the People,
who have subjected themselves to their Government: Yet they have
been so far from this, as to <HI>neglect</HI> the repeated Applications of the poor
oppress'd People against this Law, with the greatest Partiality and
Arbitraryness imaginable. Mr. <HI>A—h,</HI> who was first sent over as
Agent in their behalf, would have told the World how little Encou∣ragement
he had met with from the palatine and Proprietors, if he had
liv'd to have finish'd a Tract which he was publishing (and which we
have mention'd before) entitul'd <HI>The present State of Affairs in</HI> Carolina.
And Mr. <HI>B—ne,</HI> who succeeded this Gentleman in his Solicitation on their
behalf, apply'd to the Palatine seven Weeks before he could obtain a
Board of Proprietors to be call'd, in order to consider whether this Bill
should be ratify'd or repeal'd. When it was call'd, one Mr. <HI>A—chd—le,</HI>
who is become a Proprietor since the passing this Act, and was formerly
Governor of <HI>Carolina,</HI> whose Prudence and Integrity procur'd him
the universal Respect of the Inhabitants there, oppos'd the ratifying
this Bill at the said Board; as a Bill, that was highly injurious to the
Protestant Dissenters of that Province in particular, and to the
true Interest of the Proprietors and all the People in general: But
the Answer he receiv'd from the Palatine to all his Reasons, was
this; which shews that no Reasons of that kind, how strongly
soever they might be urg'd, could have any weight with him;
<HI>Sir, you are of one Opinion, and I am of another, and our Lives may
not be long enough to end the Controversy; I am for this Bill, and
this is the Party that I will head and countenance.</HI> After he had ex∣press'd
himself in this manner, Mr. <HI>B—ne</HI> pray'd he might be
heard by Counsel against this Act, to satisfy his Principals that
he had neglected nothing that cou'd be for their Service; tho
he easily perceiv'd from the Answer his Excellency gave Mr.
<HI>A—chd—le,</HI> that it cou'd serve no other end: But he only re∣ceiv'd
this Answer; <HI>What Business has Counsel here? It is a pruden∣cial
A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t in me, and I will do as I see fit: I see no harm at all in
this Bill, and am resolv'd to pass it.</HI> How happy is the Province
that has a Palatine of such singular Justice, Prudence and Huma∣nity?
And how unhapy is the Country that has lost a Minister
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
endu'd with so many great and excellent Qualitys? Well may
both Church and State be thought to be in danger by the Me∣morialist,
when so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>minent a Patron of the Libertys of the one,
and of the Religion of the other, shall have lost any share of his
Credit and Preferments. Accordingly he sign'd the Bill that day,
the Board consisting but of three of the Proprietors present, and
two Proxys, which were lodg'd in his Excellency's Hands.</P>
<P>When no more notice is taken of the Application that is made to
this Board by Numbers, nor any Redress given to publick Grievan∣ces,
'tis no wonder if <HI>private Complaints</HI> are entirely neglected. The
Clergyman, who is Minister of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> has this therefore to
comfort himself withal, that his Case is not particular, tho the Pro∣prietors
have had no regard to the repeated Complaints that he has
made to them, of the Insolencys offer'd him in the Streets, where
his Gown was torn off his Back, and he whipt with a Horsewhip,
and beaten and abusd'd in a most barbarous manner by some of the
most considerable of that Party, which his Excellency <HI>is resolv'd to
head and countenance.</HI></P>
<P>But tho neither the Palatine, nor the Majority of the Board of Pro∣prietors
have had any Relentings on the account of these oppress'd
People; yet the <HI>same Commons House</HI> of Assembly, which pass'd this
Act, have thought it to be so contrary to natural Equity, the Chris∣tian
Religion, and the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to be
so great an Instance of Ingratitude to the Dissenters, and so highly
injurious and destructive to their Libertys and Constitution, that a
Bill to repeal the said Act past thro that House, about half a year
after they had pass'd it. But it was lost in the Upper House, where
every thing is carry'd according to the Inclinations of the Palatine,
and those Proprietors, who give up themselves to be directed and
influenc'd by him. And upon the Commons House passing the said
repealing Bill, the Governor, in great Indignation, dissolv'd the said
Commons House, by the name of the <HI>Unsteddy Assembly.</HI></P>
<P>This is a true and faithful Account, both of the State of <HI>Caro∣lina,</HI>
which occasion'd the passing this Act, and the deplorable Con∣dition
into which this Act has brought it. And as no body, who
does not question his Excellency's Veracity, can imagine that he did
not sincerely design to head and countenance nothing but a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>action in
<HI>Carolma,</HI> when he declar'd he wou'd do so; so he has given no body
since any Reason to think that he has alter'd his Resolutions. And it
would therefore be the greatest Folly and Presumption imaginable, to
hope for a Redress from his Exccellency, or from those Proprietors
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
who are influenc'd by him (and who make a Majority at that Board)
of any Grievances, how publick soever, if they may but be for the
private Advantages of that Party. And his Excellency, together with
those Proprietors, making a Majority at that Board, gives this heavy
Accent to all the Miserys of the People, and particularly of the Dis∣senters
of that Province, That according to the present Frame of
Government that obtains there, they are irremediable.</P>

shall be of any Force, unless it be ratified
in open Parliament during the same Ses∣sion,
by the Palatine or his Deputy,
and Three more of the Lords Proprietors,
or their Deputies, and then not to con∣tinue
longer in Force but until the next
biennial Parliament, unless in the mean
time it be ratified under the Hands and
Seals of the Palatine himself, and Three
more of the Lords Proprietors themselves,

biennial Parliament.</P>
<P>§. 77. Any Proprietor or his Deputy
may enter his Protestation against any
Act of the Parliament, before the Palatine
or his Deputy's Consent be given as afore∣said,
if he shall conceive the said Act to
be contrary to this Establishment, or any
of these Fundamental Constitutions of the
Government. And in such case, after a
full and free Debate, the several Estates
shall retire into Four several Chambers,
the Palatine and Proprietors into one, the
Landgraves into another, the <HI>Cassiques</HI> in∣to
another, and those chosen by the Pre∣cincts
into a Fourth; and if the Major part
of any of the Four Estates shall Vote, that
the Law is not agreeable to this Establish∣ment,
and these Fundamental Constituti∣ons
of the Government, then it shall pass
no farther, but be as if it had never been
proposed.</P>
<P>§. 78 The <HI>Quorum</HI> of the Parliament
shall be one Half of those who are Mem∣bers,
and capable of sitting in the House
that present Sessions of Parliament. The
<HI>Quorum</HI> of each of the Chambers of Parlia∣ment,
shall be one Half of the Members
of that Chamber.</P>
<P>§. 79. To avoid Multiplicity of Laws,
which by Degrees always change the
right Foundations of the Original Govern∣ment;
All Acts of Parliament whatsoe∣ver,
in whatsoever form passed or enacted,
shall at the End of a Hundred Years after
their enacting, respectively cease and de∣termine
of themselves, and without any
repeal become null and void, as if no such
Acts or Laws had ever been made.</P>
<P>§. 80. Since Multiplicity of Comments,
as well as of Laws, have great inconveni∣encies,
and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rve only to obscure and per∣plex;
all manner of Comments and Ex∣positions
of any part of these Fundamen∣tal
Constitutions, or any part of the Com∣mon
or Statute Law of <HI>Carolina,</HI> are ab∣solutely
prohibited.</P>

Precinct, wherein shall be enrolled
all Deeds, Leases, Judgments, Mort∣gages,

<P>§. 84. There shall be a Registry in e∣very

<P>§. 86. The Time of every one's Age
that is born in <HI>Carolina,</HI> shall be reckon∣ed
from the Day that his Birth is entred in
the Registry, and not before.</P>
<P>§. 87. No Marriage shall be lawful,
whatever Contract and Ceremony they
have used, till both the Parties mutually
own it before the Register of the Place,
where they were married, and he registers
<PB N="21" REF="62"/>
it, with the Names of the Father and Mo∣ther

House or Ground, shall pay to the said
Register One Shilling <HI>per</HI> Week, for each
such Neglect, reckoning from the Time
of each Birth or Death respectively, to
the Time of Registring it.</P>
<P>§. 90. In like manner the Births,

the Freeholders of the Colony: His
Estate shall be above a Hundred Acres
of Freehold within the said Colony, and
such subordinate Officers appointed for
his Assistance, as the County Court shall
find requisite, and shall be established by
the said County Court. The Election of
the subordinate annual Officers shall be
also in the Freeholders of the Colony.</P>
<P>§. 92. All Towns Incorporate shall be
governed by a Mayor, Twelve Alder∣men,
and Twenty Four of the Common-Council.
The said Common-Council
shall be chosen by the present Housholders
of the said Town; the Aldermen shall be
chosen out of the Common-Council, and
the Mayor out of the Aldermen by the
Palatine's Court.</P>
<P>§. 93. It being of great Consequence
to the Plantation, that Port-Towns
should be built and preserved; There∣fore
whosover shall lade or unlade any
Commodity at any other Place but a
Port-Town, shall forfeit to the Lords
Proprietors for each Tun so laden or un∣laden,
the Sum of I'en Pounds Sterling,

Port-Town for ever.</P>
<P>§ 95. No Man shall be permitted to
be a Freeman of <HI>Carolina,</HI> er to have any
Estate or Habitation within it, that doth
not acknowledge a God, and that God is
publickly and solemnly to be worshipped.</P>
<P>§ 96. As the Country comes to be
suffticiently Planted and Distributed into
fit Divisions, it shall belong to the Parlia∣ment
to take care for the Building of
Churches, and the publick Maintenance
of Divines, to be employed in the Exer∣cise
of Religion, according to the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> which being the only true and
Orthodox, and the National Religion of
all the King's Dominions, is so also o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Ca∣rolina,</HI>
and therefore it alone shall be al∣lowed
to receive publick Maintenance by
Grant of Parliament.</P>
<P>§ 97. But since the Natives of that Place
who will be concerned in our Plantation,
are utterly Strangers to Christianity,
whose Idolatry, Ignorance, or Mistake,
gives us no Right to expel, or use them
ill; and those who remove from other
Parts to plant there, wild unavoida<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be of
different Opinions concerning Matters of
Religion, the Liberty whereof they will ex∣pect
to have allowed them, and it will not
be reasonable for us, on this Account, to
keep them out; That Civil Peace may be
maintained amidst the Diversity of Opi∣nions,
and our Agreement and Compact
with all Men, may be duly and faithfully
observed, the Violation whereof upon
what Pretence soever, cannot be without
great Offence to Almighty God, and
great Scandal to the true Religion which
we profess; and also that <HI>Jews,</HI> Heathens,
and other Dissen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers from the Purity of
Christian Religion, may not be scared
and kept at a Distance from it, but by
having an Opportunity of acquanting
themselves with the Truth and Reasona∣bleness
of its Doctrines, and the Peacea∣bleness
and Inoffensiveness of its Profes∣sors,
may be good Usage and Perswasion,
and all those convincing Methods of Gen∣tleness
and Meekness, suitable to the
Rules and Design of the Gospel, be won
over to embrace, and unfeignedly receive
the Truth; therefore, any seven, or
more Persons agreeing in any Religion,
shall constitute a Church or Profession, to
which they shall give some Name, to di∣stinguish
it from others.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="63"/>
§ 98. The Terms of Admittance and
Communion with any Church or Profes∣sion,
shall be written in a Book, and there∣in
be subscribed by all the Members of
the said Church or Profession; which
Book shall be kept by the Publick Register
of the Precinct where they reside.</P>
<P>§ 99 The Time of every ones Sub∣scription
and Admittance, shall be dated
in the said Book, or Religious Record.</P>
<P>§. 100. In the Terms of Communion
of every Church or Profession, these fol∣lowing
shall be three, without which no
Agreement or Assembly of Men, upon
Pretence of Religion, shall be accounted
a Church or Profession, within these
Rules:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That there is a GOD.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That GOD is publickly to be wor∣shipped.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That it is lawful, and the Duty of
every Man, being thereunto called by those
that Govern, to bear Witness to truth; and
that every Church or Profession shall in their
Terms of Communion set down the external
Way whereby they Witness a Truth as in the
Presence of God, whether it be by laying
Hands on, or kissing the <HI>Bible,</HI> as in the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> or by holding up the
Hand, or any other sensible Way.</ITEM>

<P>§ 101. No Person above seventeen
Years of Age, shall have any Benefit or

Religious Assembly.</P>
<P>§. 103. No Person whatsoever, shall

<P>§. 104. Any Person subscribing the

said Church or Profession, before the Pre∣cinct

cease to be a Member of that Church or
Profession.</P>
<P>§. 106 No Man shall use any re∣proachful,
reviling, or abusive Language,
against the Religion of any Church or
Profession, that being the certain way of
disturbing the Peace, and of hindring the
Coversion of any to the Truth, by en∣gaging
them in Quarrels and Animosi∣ties,
to the hatred of the Professors and
that Profession, which otherwise they
might be brought to assent to.</P>
<P>§. 107. Since <HI>Charity</HI> obliges us to wish
well to the Souls of all Men, and Reli∣gion
ought to alter nothing in any Man's
Civil Estate or Right, it shall be lawful
for Slaves as well as others, to enter them∣selves,

any of them shall think best, and
thereof be as fully Members as any Free∣man.
But yet no Slave shall hereby be

<P>OUR Late Soveraign Lord King

better Settlement of the Government of

Government may be made most agreeable
to the Monarchy under which we live, and
of which this Province is a Part; and that
we may avoid erecting a numerous De∣mocracy,
We the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> of the
Province aforesaid, with the Advice and
Consent of the <HI>Landgraves</HI> and <HI>Cassiques</HI>
and Commons in this present Parliament
assembled, have agreed to this following
From of Government, to be perpetually
establish'd amongst us, unto which we do
oblige our selves, our Heirs and Successors,
in the most binding Ways that can be de∣vised.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="66"/>
1. THE <HI>Proprietor's Court</HI> shall consist
of the <HI>Palatine,</HI> and Seven <HI>Pro∣prietors;</HI>
wherein nothing shall be acted
without the Presence and Consent of the
<HI>Palatine,</HI> and Three others of the <HI>Lords

to call and dissolve Parliaments, to par∣don
all Offences, to make Elections of all
Offices in the <HI>Proprietor</HI>'s Disposal, to no∣minate
and appoint Port Towns; and al∣so,
shall have Power by their Order, to
the Treasurer, to dispose of all publick
Treasure, excepting Money granted by
the Parliament, and by them directed to
some particular publick use: And also,
shall have a Negative upon all Acts, Or∣ders,
Votes and Judgments of the Parlia∣ment.
And shall have all Power granted
to the <HI>Lords Proprietors,</HI> by their Patent,
from our Sovereign Lord the King, ex∣cept

whose real and personal Estate does not
amount to Pounds.</P>
<P>10. The present Number of the Re∣presentatives

<HEAD>THE
Present State of Affairs
IN
CAROLINA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By <HI>JOHN ASH,</HI> Gent.</BYLINE>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sent by several of the Inhabitants of that Colony, to
deliver their Representation thereof to, and seek
Redress from, the Lords Proprietors of that Pro∣vince:
Together with an Account of his Reception,
by the Honourable the Lord Granvill, their Palatine,
President, or Chief of the Proprietors.</HEAD>
<P>ON the Death of <HI>Joseph Blake,</HI> Es{que}
Governour, and one of the <HI>Pro∣prietors</HI>
of <HI>Carolina,</HI> the <HI>Proprietors</HI> Depu∣ties
met, according to their Instructions
in such Case, proceeded to elect a new
Governour; and by them <HI>Landgrave Jo∣seph
Morton</HI> was Elected Governour. But
<HI>James Moor,</HI> Es{que} one of the said Depu∣ties,
knowing the Party he had amongst
the Deputies, and nothing regarding
how Disloyal, how Derogatory from
the just Right of the <HI>English</HI> Throne
that Objection was, objected against the
said <HI>Landgrave Joseph Morton,</HI> That he
the said <HI>Joseph Morton</HI> had made a Breach
of the Trust reposed in him by the true
and absolute <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Proprietors,</HI> &amp;c.
by accepting of a Commission for Judge
of the Admiralty from King <HI>William,</HI>
when at the same Time he had a Com∣mission
from the said Proprietors for the
said Office, in whom the Disposal of the
same was: Now, besides the Disloyalty
of this Objection, it was also false; for
it appears not by the Charter, That the
<HI>Proprietors</HI> can impower any one to try
Persons for Facts committed out of their
Dominions, and which is necessary for
such Judge; yet such was his Interest,
that on this his Objection, <HI>Landgrave
<PB N="30" REF="71"/>
Morton</HI> was Rejected, and the said <HI>James
Moore</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lected and declared Governour.
Of this <HI>landgrave Morton</HI> Inform'd, and
Complain'd to the <HI>Proprietors,</HI> but to no
purpose.</P>
<P>The Power thus bodly gotten, Mr.
<HI>Moore</HI> resolves to make the best use of it;
and therefore finding himself too poor,
even with the Countenance of his Office,
to make any considerable Profit of the
<HI>Indian</HI> Trade, he says a Design of get∣ting
it wholly into his Power. This he
attempted by getting a Bill brought into
the Assembly at the latter end of the
Year 1700, Intituled, <HI>A Bill for Regula∣ting
the</HI> Indian <HI>Trade,</HI> but so contriv'd as
to have made him wholly Master of it.
But Mr. <HI>Robert Stephens,</HI> Mr. <HI>Trott</HI> then
no Courtier) and some others so plainly
shew'd its ill Aim, that it was thrown out
of the Assembly, as it was again in the be∣ginning
of the Year 1701. On which Mr.
<HI>Moore</HI> perceiving, That that Assembly
could not be prevailed with to answer his
Ends, he dissolved the Assembly, and
about the latter End of that Year a New
one was chosen, at the Election of which,
tho' the Right of Electing be by the
Charter in the Freeholders only, he so
Influenc'd the Sheriff, that Strangers,
Servants, Aliens, nay <HI>Malatoes</HI> and <HI>Ne∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>
were Polled, and Returns made
accordingly. Such as at the Place oppo∣sed
those Practices, were abused, nay, as∣faulted
by Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s Favourites. By
this Means, having got several into the
Assembly, of neither Sense nor Credit,
but such as would Vote as he would have
them, he there kept them from being
thrown out on the Petition of those who
were unjustly excluded by their being
Return'd, by repeated and strangely pro∣cur'd
Adjournments and Prorogations,
until the Proclamation of our New War
with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> arriv'd. Then
possessing the People by Stories with
hopes of mighty Plunder, he got a De∣sign
that he had proposed to the Assem∣bly
before, of going against St. <HI>Augustin,</HI>
a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> belonging to <HI>Spain,</HI> a little to the
Southward of <HI>Carolina,</HI> to be approved,
tho' in truth it was no more than a Pro∣ject
of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>booting under the specious
Name of War, for neither the Prepara∣tion
nor the Performance will permit
any one to believe it was meant for any
other Purpose, or the least Good of the
Colony.</P>
<P>However, it was approved, and Two
Thousand Pounds were raised to equip
his Honour and his Comrades out for
their beloved Exercise of Plundering,
and Slave-catching. This they perform∣ed
well enough, but carrying on the Pre∣tence
too far, and coming to sit down
before the strong Castle of St. <HI>Augustin,</HI>
while they were sending their Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder to
<HI>Jamaica</HI> by their trusty Officers, under
Colour of seeking Supplies, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding for
Bombs and Morrars, in the midst of all
their Riot and M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le, they were alarm'd
by the coming of Four Vessels into the
Harbour, in which were (they say) 200
Enemies. At first, being encouraged by
Wine up to a Height above performing
any Thing, the General <HI>Moore</HI> resolves
bravely to put on Board his Eight Ves∣sels
then riding in the Harbour, all their
Goods and Plunder, and with his few Men
about 500, Fight thro' the Enemy, and
so come Home. But the Pillow, which
often lets out Heat to make way for
Caution, changed this his Resolution;
So the next Day, having destroyed as
many of his own Ships, and as much of
his War Stores and Provisions as the
haste they were in would allow, he re∣treats
with such Caution and Dispatch,
that he lost not one Man by the Ene∣my.</P>
<P>This
Expedition, whatever the Go∣vernour
or General (if you please) got
by it, brought a Debt on the Country
(besides the 2000<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. first raised) o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> near
6000<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. for the Payment of which (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Security of the Country, as was said)
the Assembly was called; they enq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
into the Debt, bring in a Bill to raise
the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, consider of defending the South∣ward
open to the Enemy; but of that the
<HI>Courtiers</HI> made but a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, even in the
House, and it yet is (as I hear) neglect∣ed;
as also a Bill for Regulating Electi∣ons
for the Future, for to the Breaches
of the Freeholders Rights, our p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent
Miseries they saw were plainly owing,
<PB N="31" REF="72"/>
nor had those Members, who sat by
Means of those illegal Practices, the
Courage to oppose it; so it past the As∣sembly,
but being sent up to the Gover∣nour
in Council, it was there thrown out;
on which Fifteen Members (the Assem∣bly
consists of Thirty) left the House,
resolving no longer to cover with their
Authority the pernicious Practices of
the <HI>Ministry,</HI> since nothing useful for the
Country could be obtained.</P>
<P>On this several of Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s Favou∣rites,
after having been treated by him
(and thereunto encourag'd, as is said)
headed the Rabble, and in a riotous
Manner, sought after (threatning open∣ly
to murther them) several Persons
thought the chief Opposers and Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li∣kers
of Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s Management;
some they met with, Members of the
Assembly, one Deputy, several rich
Merchants, and good Planters, Confi∣ning,
Striking and Abusing them; and
for several Days continuing these Disor∣ders,
particularly breaking open a House
one Night on a poor Woman, and so abu∣sing
her, that thereupon she brought
forth a dead Child, whose Scull, Arm,
and Back-bone was broken, and one
Eye forc'd out of its Head, as the Chyrur∣gion,
who delivered her, deposed; but
this Violence not producing that Submis∣sion
as was expected, that Assembly was
Dissolv'd.</P>
<P>Of this Riot, Complaint was several
times, while it lafted, made to Mr.
<HI>Moore;</HI> but he would not try to suppress
it, nor, when in some Measure over,
would he take any Care that they should
be Prosecuted; nor so much as oblige
such of them, as <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndgrave, Thomas Smith,</HI>
regularly demanded Security of the Peace
from, to give the same: Nay, one Mr.
<HI>Stephens,</HI> who was not in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own then,
but heard he was named by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ters
as one of the proscribed, going with se∣veral
who had been injur'd, to see how
Mr. <HI>Moore</HI> would receive them, was,
while <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting by Mr. <HI>Moore</HI> at his own
Table, by a Servant of Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s pull'd
backwards by the Hair of his Head, struck
and wounded, and all only for his im∣pertinent
Curiosity, as he was told on
that Occasion. He desires the Gover∣nour
to bind this his Servant to his good
Behaviour, and oblige him to appear to
answer this Action at the next Sessions,
but nothing was done. The now Gover∣nour,
Sir <HI>Nathaniel Johnson,</HI> was hereby
oblig'd to take on him the Government.
To him immediately the Injur'd apply'd
for Justice, but are denied; and, tho'
the Grand Jury, a little after he took on
him his Office, after having receiv'd a
Record of the Riot from <HI>Landgrave Bel∣linger</HI>
on his own View, and on Examina∣tion
of Witnesses and Depositions in re∣lation
to the Outrage committed on the
Woman with Child, presented it to the
Court as a great Grievance, that this
Riot was not looked into, nor the Rio∣ters
prosecuted, Yet no Justice against
them could be obtain'd, the Judge giving
for Answer, <HI>It was before the Council his
Superiors.</HI> The present Governour, That
it was an Action done before his coming
to the Government, that he thought the
Time of prosecution <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>psed, but would
take care the like should be no more.</P>
<P>Then a new Assembly was called, and
at the Election for <HI>Berkeley</HI> and <HI>Craven.</HI>
County, (for in <HI>Colleton</HI> County there
was no Opposition) the Violences in
Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s Time, and all other illegal
Practices were with more Violence re∣peated
and openly avow'd by the present
Governour and his Friends. On this <HI>Jo∣seph
Morton</HI> and <HI>Edmund Bellinger, Land∣graves,</HI>
and Deputies of the Lords Pre∣prietors,
all the other Members of <HI>Col∣leton</HI>
County, and several of the greatest
Worth and Reputation in <HI>Berkeley</HI> County
prevail'd with me to come for <HI>England,</HI>
and represent to our Proprietors our mi∣serable
State; which When I should be
gone, for before they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they

squeeze from him 60<HI>l.</HI> for the present
Governour, whereas the other had been
content with Fifty, for that Favour, which
they would perswade <HI>John Martin</HI> was
necessary for him: But he thought this
too oppressive, so makes his Escape, not
daring to stay in that Country. But be∣fore
he goes, discovers a Design Mr.
<HI>Moore</HI> had of Employing him the said <HI>John
Martin</HI> in a private Trade with the
<HI>French,</HI> in which its more then likely
others were to be concern'd. 'Tis true, I
can't, by the Evidence I have here, le∣gally
convict them of this Design of hold∣ing
Commerce with Her Majesty's Ene∣mies;
but I think the original Letter I

nor for the same Reason can I here
give a full Account of that partial Pro∣secution
which the same <HI>James Moore,</HI> as
Attorney-General, made against one
—<HI>Alford</HI> his Servant or Trader, ac∣cus'd
of having hir'd and assisted an <HI>In∣dian</HI>
Slave in Murthering his Master
<HI>John Henry,</HI> Servant or Trader to Mr.
<HI>James Stanyarn,</HI> not for any Quarrel
that was between them, but only to re∣move
a too successful Competitor in that
Trade of which the Grand Jury held at
<HI>Charles</HI> Town in, last com∣plain'd,
desired the Tryal therefore to
be defer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d till the Witnesses wanting
might be present, and the <HI>Indian,</HI> who,
confessing the Fact was condemn'd, might
till the Tryal should be over, be Re∣priev'd;
all which the said <HI>James Moore,</HI>
with heat opposed, tho' the Judge
thought it reasonable, and answer'd their
Desire.</P>
<P>To confirm and strengthen the Truth
of this my Relation, I have thought fit
to offer to the Reader the Representa∣tion
as drawn by those who sent me,
whose Names are Subscrib'd; as also
the Minutes of the Election of Mr. <HI>Moore,</HI>
and the Message from the Grand Jury to
the Court about the Riot.</P>

<HEAD>To his Excellency John Granvill, Es{que} Palatine, and to the
rest of the true and absolute Lords and Proprietors of the
Province of Carolina.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Representation and Address of several of the Members of this
present Assembly returned for Colleton County, and other the
Inhabitants of this Province, whose Names are hereunto sub∣scribed.</HEAD>
<P>May it please your Lordships,</P>
<P>ALtho the miserable Estate of this Co∣lony
will be sufficiently known to
your Lordships, from the Relation of <HI>John
Ash,</HI> Es{que} who is fully intrusted by us to
remonstrate our Grievances to your Lord∣ships;
yet we think our selves exceeding∣ly
bound and obliged to lay before you
what we think does concern your Lord∣ships
Honours, and the Peoples Rights and
Privileges: For if the Question were a∣bout
Matters of small moment, we should
be ashamed to be importunate, and un∣willing
to give the least trouble to your
Lordships; but considering that the very
Foundation of our lawful Rights, hath of
late been struck at by Persons, who have
more regard to their private Interest than
the publick Good, we humbly conceive,
that it cannot stand with the Duty we owe
to our selves as <HI>Englishmen,</HI> or to our Po∣sterity,
to sit down contented with less
than that which every Liege and Free∣born
Subject of the Crown of <HI>England</HI>
may, and of right ought to have. And
therefore lest our Silence should be pre∣judicial
to so important a Cause, we hum∣bly
crave your Lordships leave, faithfully
and impartially to represent to you the
great and notorious Violations and In∣fringements
of our Laws and Liberties, un∣der
which we suffer.</P>
<P>We shall go no further back, but date
the unhappy Cause and Grounds of our
Complaints from and immediately after
the Death of the late Governor <HI>Blake;</HI>
For the Choice and Election of a Governor
to succeed him being intrusted with your
Lordships Deputys here, that Person a∣mongst
your said Deputys who made the
strongest Party in the Counsel, did carry
the Government by perverting the Design,
and breaking thro the Rules and Instruc∣tions
agreed to by your Lordships for such
Election. And this manifestly appear'd in
the unjust Election of the late Governor
<HI>Moore,</HI> in prejudice of Landgrave <HI>Mor∣ton</HI>'s
Title, who (after he was Elected by a
Majority of the Council then present) was
objected against by the said <HI>Moore,</HI> and ex∣cluded
only because he had accepted of
a Commission from the King: And as the
said <HI>Moore</HI> acquir'd and obtain'd the Go∣vernment
of this Province by Fraud,
Flattery and trifling Exceptions, as afore∣said;
so has he endeavour'd ever since to
manage all things by base and indirect
Methods, and crafty Projects, which made
his Government miserably unfortunate to
us all. The great personal Debts and Ne∣cessities
which the said late Governor
<HI>Moore</HI> had to struggle with, may well be
thought to have put him upon, and promp∣ted
him to designs to enrich himself at the
publick Peace and Welfare: And because
these his Designs cou'd not possibly be
effected by himself alone, he knew very
well, that to engage the Council to his
Interest, and to have an Assembly chosen
to his liking, wou'd be the way effectually
to compleat and accomplish his Ends and
Purposes: Thereupon 'tis manifest, there
being Vacancies in the Council for Persons
fit, and worthy to represent your Lord∣ships,
and your Lordships Pleasure not be∣ing
<PB N="34" REF="75"/>
then signified and known therein, those
very Vacancies were supplied by such Per∣sons
whom he beforehand knew, and was
well satisfied and assured would be for his
Use and Purpose; and it's as well known,
that the Debates and Consultations of the
Council have all along been carried on,
and managed to the Ends aforesaid.</P>
<P>And pursuant to his said Design, he did
by indirect Practices endeavor that such an
Assembly might be chosen as would be a∣greeable
in their Temper and Disposition
with his Designs and Resolutions: This
was to be brought about, tho the very
Foundation of our <HI>English</HI> Rights and Li∣berties
were undermin'd and utterly sub∣verted
in the Attempt.</P>
<P>1. We therefore in the first place humbly
represent to your Lordships, and we do
assert and maintain, That it is one of the
fundamental Rights and unquestionable
Privileges belonging to <HI>English-men,</HI> that
all Elections of their Representatives to
serve in Parliament ought to be free and
indifferent, without any Prayer or Com∣mandment
to the contrary; and that no A∣lien
born out of the Allegiance of the
Crown of <HI>England,</HI> unless he be otherwise
especially qualify'd, ought to elect for, or
be elected to serve as a Member of As∣sembly;
all which notwithstanding, at the
Election of Members of Assembly to serve
for <HI>Berkly</HI> County made in the Month of
<HI>November,</HI> 1701. there were several great
Abuses made and committed, against the
Ancient Usages and Customs of this Pro∣vince,
and contrary to Law, particularly
an Act intitul'd, <HI>An Act for Regulating E∣lections,</HI>
&amp;c. and to the great Dissatisfac∣tion,
and manifest Prejudice of the several
Inhabitants of this Province, Candidates
and others. For so it was, may it please
your Lordships, that at the said Election,
much Threatnings, many Intreaties, and
other unjustifiable Actions were made use of,
and illegal and unqualify'd Votes given in
to the Sheriff, and by him receiv'd and re∣turn'd,
particularly the Votes of very many
unqualified Alien▪ were taken and enter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,
the Votes of several Members of the Coun∣cil
were filed and receiv'd, a great number
of Servants, and poor and indigent Persons,
voted promiscuously with their Masters and
Creditors, as also several free <HI>Negroes</HI> were
receiv'd, and taken for as good Electors as
the best Freeholders in the Province. So
that we leave it with your Lordships to
judg, whether admitting Aliens, Strangers,
Servants, Negroes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as good and quali∣fied
Voters, can be thought any ways agree∣able
to King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Patent to your Lord∣ships,
or the <HI>English</HI> Constitution of Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>II. We represent to your Lordships,
that when at the meeting of the Assembly,
divers Candidates, by Petition by them ex∣hibited,
pray'd to be heard against the
Return of the Sheriff for <HI>Berkly</HI> County of
the Election aforesaid, and insisted upon
their Right, and that the Sheriff's Return
was false and illegal; and the said Assembly,
the better and more impartially to inquire
into the ill Practices at the said Election,
did first of all resolve to begin upon Pri∣vileges
and Elections, that the late Go∣vernor
<HI>Moore,</HI> to prevent such Inquiry, did
several times prorogue the said As∣sembly.</P>
<P>III. That when the said Assembly were
at last suffer'd to sit, the Inquiry and Ex∣amination
into the Sheriff's Return of the
last Election was obstructed, and industri∣ously
prevented, by setting on foot an ill∣laid
Design of raising Forces to attaque St.
<HI>Augustine.</HI></P>
<P>IV. That notwithstanding your Lordships
repeated Commands to your Deputies to
procure a good Regulation of the <HI>Indian</HI>
Trade, on which our friendly Correspon∣dence
with all our Neighbouring <HI>Indians,</HI>
and the Peace and Safety of this Colony
chiefly depends, yet the said late Governor
<HI>Moore</HI> has been by his Artifices, the chief
(if not the only) occasion of obstructing
the same, designing nothing less than in∣grossing
the same for himself and Accom∣plices;
having already almost utterly r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d
the Trade for Skins and F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs (where∣by
we held our chief Correspondence with
<HI>England</HI>) and turn'd it into a Trade of
<HI>Indian</HI> catching or Slave-making, whereby
the <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>West</HI> of us are
already involv'd in Blood and Confusion;
a Trade so odious and abominable, that
every other Colony in <HI>America</HI> (altho they
have equal Temptation) abhor to follow.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="76"/>
V. That the said late Governor <HI>Moore</HI>
did grant Commissions to <HI>Anthony Dods∣worth,
Robert Mackoone</HI> and others, to set
upon, assault, kill, destroy, and take
Captive as many <HI>Indians</HI> as they possible
could, the Profit and Produce of which
<HI>Indian</HI> Slaves were turn'd to his private use;
whereas such Undertakings, unjust and bar∣barous
in themselves, will in all probability
draw upon us an <HI>Indian</HI> War, with all the
dreadful Consequences of it.</P>
<P>VI. We represent to your Lordships,
that the late unfortunate, ill-contrived,
and worse-managed Expedition against
<HI>St. Augustine,</HI> was principally set on foot
by the said late Governor and his Adhe∣rents;
and that if any Person in the said
late Assembly undertook to speak against
it, and to shew how unfit and unable we
were at that time for such an Attempt, he
was presently look'd upon by them as an
Enemy and Traitor to his Country, and
reviled and affronted in the said Assembly,
altho the true Design of the Expedition
was no other than catching and making
Slaves of <HI>Indians</HI> for private Advantage,
and improverishing the Country. And this
will plainly appear, when your Lordships
know that your Country is brought more
in Debt at this time, and upon this occa∣sion,
than ever since its first Settlement,
if we put all the Debts we have owed
together. And that the Expedition was
to enrich themselves, will appear particu∣larly,
because whatsoever Booty, as rich
Silks, great Quantity of Church-Plate,
with a great many other costly Church.
Ornaments and Utensils taken by our Sol∣diers
at <HI>St. Augustine,</HI> are now detained
in the Possession of the said late Gover∣nor
and his Officers, contrary to an Act of
Assembly made, for an equal Division of
the same among the Soldiers.</P>
<P>VII. That the said late Governor would
have had the said Expedition against <HI>St.
Augustine</HI> begun and undertaken before the
War with <HI>Spain</HI> was proclaimed here; and
this was vehemently urged by his Interest
in the said Assembly; but with much ado,
being put to the Vote, was carried in the
Negative. And when at last the Expe∣dition
was ordered, the Management of
the said late Governor was such in all it.
Steps, particularly in relation to his shame∣ful
Retreat, and burning the Country's
Vessels, that we are ashamed to mention
the same, till we have a Free Assembly,
before which the matter may▪ be fairly
tried, which is the only thing the said
late Governor and his Adherents are most
afraid of.</P>
<P>VIII. That in the said late Assembly,
the Constitutions sent by Major <HI>Daniel</HI>
were offer'd for their passing, urg'd with
great Strength of Reason for to have
them pass'd by Mr. <HI>Ash;</HI> but they were
opposed by Mr. <HI>Trott,</HI> Mr. <HI>Howes,</HI> and
others the said Governor's Creatures, and
several reflecting Words used by the said
<HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ott</HI> and <HI>Howes</HI> concerning them, expo∣sing
the Constitutions as ridiculous and
void in themselves; thereby endeavouring
(notwithstanding your Lordships care of
us) to keep the People in an unsettled
Condition, that from time to time they
might the more easily be imposed on by
them.</P>
<P>IX. That after the People returned
from <HI>St. Augustine,</HI> the time for the said
Assembly to meet, according to the last
Prorogation, was just at hand; when
they met, they went upon the Inquiry of
the Charges the Country had been at in
the said Expedition, and were upon De∣bate
for the finding out ways and means
for the Payment of the Country's Debts,
for securing the Colony, for the settling
of Elections for the future, and for grant∣ing
as much Freedom to the <HI>French</HI> and
other Aliens as could be granted by the
Assembly, or the <HI>French</HI> reasonably expect.
<HI>A Bill for the better Regulating Elections,</HI>
passed the Lower House twice, and was
sent up to the said Governor and Coun∣cil,
where it was rejected without so much
as a Conference; upon which several of
the Members, jealous of their Privilege,
and being so ordered by those that sent
them, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the House, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad entr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng their
Protestation, a Copy of which Mr. <HI>Ash</HI>
has to shew your Lordships, and to which
we refer you.</P>
<P>X. But what we have yet to represent
to your Lordships, makes very deep <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣pressions
on us, and is not to be thought
on by us, but with the greatest Regret and
Concern. For altho the Members of the
late Assembly, who protested and did leave
<PB N="36" REF="77"/>
the House as aforesaid (hoping that the
next day they might find things in better
order, and some temperating means found
out, which might have given some tole∣rable
Assurance of having their Libertys
secured) went every one of them to the
House on the morrow, and frankly offered
to sit longer, if the rest of the Assembly
would join with them to assert their
Rights; but instead of any Compliance,
they were abus'd, revil'd, and treated
with the most reflecting Language imagi∣nable,
very unbecoming an Assembly.
And we further represent to your Lord∣ships,
that in a day or two after such
Abuse given them in the House, several
of the said Members, <HI>viz.</HI> the said <HI>John
Ash,</HI> Es{que} Landgrave <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> and
others, were assaulted and set upon in
the open Street, without any Provocation
or Affront by them given or offered. The
said <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> was set upon by Lieute∣nant
Colonel <HI>George Dearsby,</HI> who with his
Sword drawn, and the Point held at the
said <HI>Smith</HI>'s Belly, swore he would kill
him, and if he had not been prevented,
would have done the said <HI>Smith</HI> some con∣siderable
mischief, to the endangering of
his Life. The said <HI>John Ash</HI> walking along
the Street, was assaulted by a rude, drun∣ken,
ungovernable Rabble, headed, en∣couraged
and abetted by the said <HI>Dearsby,
Thomas Dalton, Nicholas Nary,</HI> and other
Persons, Inhabitants, who set upon the
said <HI>Ash,</HI> used him villanously and barba∣rously:
and that Evening, when he the
said <HI>Ash</HI> was retired into a Friend's Cham∣ber
for Security, the same armed Multi∣tude
came to the House where the said
<HI>Ash</HI> was, and demanded him down, assu∣ring
him at the same time that they
would do him no hurt, but only wanted
to discourse with him: upon which Assu∣rance
he came down to them; who not∣withstanding,
being encouraged and as∣sisted
by Captain <HI>Rhett</HI> and others, drew
him by Force and Violence on board his
the said <HI>Rhett</HI>'s Ship, reviling and threat∣ning
of him as they drag'd him along;
and having gotten him on board the said
<HI>Rhett</HI>'s Ship, they sometimes told him
they would carry him to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and at
other times threatned to hang him, or
leave him on some remote Island.</P>
<P>XI. That the said late Governor had
the same way (immediately before the Riot
began) treated a great many of the Per∣sons
concerned therein, and used such
Expressions to them, as gave them, next
their Drink, the greatest Encouragements
for what they acted, by telling them that
the protesting Members would bring the
People on their Heads for neglecting to
pay the Country's Debts, which if it
should happen he knew not who could
blame them; in the mean time he thank'd
them for their close Adherence to him in
all his Concerns. And after the Riot be∣gan
(of part of which he was an Eye∣witness)
having first drank with some of
them, he withdrew himself out of the
way, thereby giving them greater Incou∣ragement
to proceed in their Tumultuous
Practices, and by his Example and Absence
discouraging the inferior Officers from
executing their Duty.</P>
<P>XII. That whilst the said Riot conti∣nued,
which was four or five Days, Land∣grave
<HI>Edmond Bellinger,</HI> who was a Justice
of the Peace, there being no other to be
seen that understood his Office, went our
to suppress and record the aforesaid Riot;
but the Rioters no sooner saw him, than
they called him all the opprobrious Names
they could think of, and the said <HI>Rhett</HI>
came up to him and struck him over the
Head with his Cane, and continued beating
and stricking of him for a considerable
time, as by the said Record herewith
sent your Lordships will more fully ap∣pear.</P>
<P>XIII. That the said Rioters beat and
abused Mr. <HI>Joseph Boone,</HI> and put him in
danger and fear of his Life, without any
Provocation by him given or offered; and
that for four or five days successively, and
at other times after, the said Rioters un∣usually
armed and weapon'd to the great
terror of the People, frightned and ter∣rified
Persons, that they were forced
to leave the Town, their Affairs and
Interests exposed to the Mercy of a licen∣tious
Rabble.</P>
<P>XIV. That some of the said Rioters,
whilst the Riot was at the Church, went
one night to the House of <HI>John Smith,</HI> a
Butcher in <HI>Charles-Town;</HI> and there being
a Woman big with Child in the said
<PB N="37" REF="78"/>
House, they with Force opened the Door,
threw her down, and otherwise misused
her, that she brought forth a dead Child,
with the Back and Skullbroken.</P>
<P>XV. That the said <HI>John Ash, Thomas
Smith, James Byres, Joseph Boone,</HI> and
others, complained to the said late Go∣vernor
and his Council, setting forth the
Abuses and barbarous Usages they had met
withal from the aforesaid Rioters, and the
Danger they were yet in, for that the
said Rioters were still in Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but
they met with no other Satisfaction from
them, than that the said late Governor
shifted off the matter, by saying it was a
business fit for a Justice of Peace; and
being asked by <HI>James Byres,</HI> whether or
not he look'd on himself, as Governor,
obliged to keep the Peace of the Province?
he replied, that was a Question he was
not obliged to answer.</P>
<P>XVI. That before the next Sessions of
the Peace holden for the said Province,
Sir <HI>Nathaniel Johnson</HI> was proclaimed, and
took upon him the Government, and then
Mr. <HI>Trott</HI> had a Commission to be Judg,
and the said late Governor was made
Attorny General, so that it was in vain to
expect any Relief or Remedy here: How∣ever,
the said <HI>Edmond Bellinger</HI> did what
in him lay to have the said Riot inquired
into, gave in the Record thereof to the
Bench, and some of the Grand Jury urged
to have it presented, but to no purpose,
for some of the Abetters of the Rioters
being of the Jury, and making Friends
there, stopt the whole Proceeding.</P>
<P>XVII. We further represent to your
Lordships, that contrary to the Rights and
Privileges which we ought to enjoy, the
last Election of Members to serve for
<HI>Berkly</HI> County, was managed with greater
Injustice to the Freemen of this Province
than the former: For at this last Election,
Jews, Strangers, Sailors, Servants, Negroes,
and almost every <HI>French</HI> Man in <HI>Craven</HI> and
<HI>Berkly</HI> County came down to elect, and
their Votes were taken, and the Persons
by them votes for, were returned by the
Sheriff, to the manifest wrong and preju∣dice
of other Candidates.</P>
<P>Things standing with us, as is before
faithfully represented to your Lordships,
we thought it our Duty, since we can
have no Remedy or Relief in <HI>Carolina,</HI> to
apply our selves to your Lordships, whose
Paternal Care and Concern for us, we
question not, will be signally evidenced and
extended unto us upon such occasions, and
in such extremities: For when once our
Lawful Rights and Privileges are denied
us, when Foreigners and Strangers shall
make our Laws, when we can have no
Protection from those who ought, and
are intrusted by your Lordships, to see
the Laws executed; when, in a word,
Force is made the Arbiter of all Diffe∣rences,
and all things reduced to a State
of Confusion, it is surely a time, if ever
there be one, for a People to complain:
and miserable are those Subjects, who
must be hectored and domineered over by
their Fellow-Subjects, even by those who
have hardly any other way to support
their decayed Fortunes but at the Expence
of the Publick. It may be worth your
Lordships while to reflect what might have
been the occasion, that so few Persons of
Interest, Honour and Education, come
amongst us, and that good People go,
and are going from us, when the Colony
is in a thriving Condition; certainly it is
because the <HI>English</HI> Liberties, that all her
Majesty's Subjects in all other Places in her
Dominions justly claim▪ are notoriously
trampled on, to the great Discouragement
of Settlers. As to the <HI>French,</HI> they have
hitherto lived peaceably, and with due
Encouragement amongst us; but when we
see and consider, that they are often made
Tools of, and imposed upon, and persua∣ded
by ill-designing Persons here, to carry
on sinister Designs to the general Disad∣vantage
of the Country, and how easily
they are drawn into Error
s, by reason
they have not a right understanding of
our Language, and are ignorant of our
Laws, we can't imagine that we do them
any hurt, by making good and wholesom
Laws for us and them, since we oblige
them by no other Laws whatsoever, or
upon any account, than what we our selves
are obliged by, and live under. What
then have we to entreat for and pray of
your Lordships? Nothing less, than that
your Lordships would be pleased to take
all and singular the Premises into your
<PB N="38" REF="79"/>
serious Considerations, to settle and esta∣blish
the Peace of this Colony on such a
sure Foundation, that it may be beyond
the Wit and Malice, and out of the power
of ill-designing Men to disturb it for the
time to come. And lastly, we on behalf
of our selves and her Majesty's Liege
Subjects, Inhabitants of this Province, do
more especially pray and desire your Lord∣ships,
that you would be pleased to give
Directions for calling a Free General As∣sembly,
which will undoubedly assist
your Lordships to redress and remove the
Grievances aforesaid, settle the Peace and
Prosperity of this Colony, and procure
that chearful Obedience which ought to
be rendred to your Lordships, under her
present Majesty; carrying with it the Offer
of our Fortunes and best Endeavours for
her Majesty's and your Lordships Honors,
as a real Testimony of our Thankfulness.</P>
<P>May it please your Lordships,</P>
<P>ALL the Complaints and Grievances
above exprest, cannot be supposed
to be personally known, and proveable
by every of us the Subscribers of the
same (tho there be none of us, but to
our sad Experience can witness too many
of them) but we make no doubt, when
your Lordships shall order such a Method
for Enquiry into the Truth of the Premises,
as may be free, without partiality and
brow-beating of the Persons to be exa∣mined
thereon, they will be made as
evident, as that the Sun at Noon shines in
our Hemisphere.</P>
<CLOSER>That your Lordships may long and prospe∣rously
live, is the Prayer of, may it
please your Lordships, your Lordships
most humble and most obedient Servants.
<HI>Signed by above 150 of the Principal
Inhabitants.</HI></CLOSER>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>(Numb. 6)
An Act for the more effectual Preservation of the Government of
this Province, by requiring all Persons that shall hereafter be
chosen Members of the Commons House of Assembly, and sit in
the same, to take the Oaths and subscribe the Declaration ap∣pointed
by this Act; and to conform to the Religious Worship in
this Province, according to the Church of England; and to
receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the
Rites and Vsage of the said Church.</HEAD>
<P>AS nothing is more contrary to the
Profession of the Christian Religion,
and particularly to the Doctrine of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> than Persecution for
Conscience only: Nevertheless,</P>
<P>Whereas it hath been found by Expe∣rience,
that the admitting of Persons of
different Persuasions and Interest in Mat∣ters
of Religion, to sit and vote in the
Commons House of Assembly, hath often
caused great Contentions and Animositys
in this Province, and hath very much ob∣structed
the Publick Business; and whereas
by the Laws and Usage of <HI>England,</HI> all
Members of Parliament are obliged to
conform to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> by
receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's
Supper, according to the Rites of the said
Church.</P>
<P>Be it therefore Enacted, by his Excel∣lency
<HI>John</HI> Lord <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranville,</HI> Palatine, and
the rest of the true and absolute Lords
and Proprietors of this Province, by and
with the Advice and Consent of the rest
of the Members of the General Assembly,

<HEAD>(Numb. 7.)
To His Excellency, John Lord Granville Palatine, and to
the rest of the true and absolute Lords and Proprietors of
the Province of Carolina.</HEAD>
<OPENER>May it please Your Lordships;</OPENER>
<P>BY an Address sent Your Lordships by
<HI>John Ash</HI> Es{que} bearing date the 26<HI>th</HI>
of <HI>June,</HI> 1703. several of the Inhabi∣tants
of this part of Your Province, set
forth to Your Lordships the undue Elec∣tion
of the present Assembly; and besides
the heavy Taxes they have laid on Us,
and the severe Impositions on Trade (the
Consequences of the vain Attempt on St.
<HI>Augustine</HI>) we are more particularly to
make our Complaints to Your Lordships,
of the great and unparallel'd Breach they
have made in the Charter, granted Your
Lordships by K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. and of our
Privileges therein contained. The Assem∣bly
having been prorogued to the 10<HI>th</HI> of
<HI>May;</HI> it was however called together by
Proclamation, to sit the 6<HI>th</HI> of <HI>April:</HI>
And having continued together seven or
eight Days, with little or no Business be∣fore
them (to the great surprize of the
generality of the People) on a sudden,
without any previous Notice, on the 4<HI>th</HI>
of <HI>May</HI> a Bill was brought into the House
(the Copy whereof We have herewith
sent your Lordships) to exclude by a Sa∣cramental
Test all Dissenters from sitting
in the Commons House of Assembly. This
Bill was hurried on so, that on the 6<HI>th</HI> it
past the House; there being, after all their
Endeavours, but Twelve for it, and Ele∣ven
against it; whereof several were
Members of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> In
the Upper House, tho it past with less
Opposition, yet the Landgrave <HI>Joseph Mor∣ton</HI>
was deny'd the liberty of Entring his
Reasons for his Dissent.</P>
<P>We are unable (my Lords) to describe
the Consternation of the Generality of the
People at these violent Proceedings: All
moderate Persons are extreamly dissatis∣fied,
and the Dissenters themselves under
the last degree of Confusion and Discon∣tent;
desiring, with Grief of Heart, that
Your Lordships, in your Great Wisdom
and Goodness, will take Their present
Condition into Your serious Considera∣tions,
and order a Repeal of the afore∣said
Act, so prejudicial to their Liberties;
for which they humbly offer to Your
Lordships these following Reasons.</P>
<P>1. K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, having by
His Charter to Your Lordships, given His
Subjects, the Freemen and Freeholders of
this Province, by themselves or their De∣legates,
the privilege of Advising and Con∣senting
with Your Lordships, to all such
Laws as shall be made here, and the Dis∣senters
being a very large part of the
Freemen, and Freeholders, and incoura∣ged
to transport themselves, Families, and
<PB N="42" REF="83"/>
Estates, hither by the said Privileges, are
notwithstanding excluded from the Pri∣vilege
of being Delegates, or Represen∣tatives
of the People in their Assemblies
by the said Act, to the manifest Violation
of the Charter.</P>
<P>2. The Dissenters, in all the rest of Her
Majesty's Governments in <HI>America,</HI> being
by no Laws excluded from being chosen
into Assemblys in the respective Colonys;
and the Dissenters here, having a Right
thereunto in this Government, not only as
Freemen, but by the Concessions in the
Charter, have the greater Reason to com∣plain
of their present Sufferings.</P>
<P>3. We cannot too feelingly assure your
Lordships, that the said Act tends not
only to the great Prejudice, and utter
Discouragement of her Majesty's good
Subjects, the Dissenters here, in rending
from them that fundamental Privilege,
which they and their Ancestors have peace∣ably
enjoy'd ever since the first Settlement
of this Colony; but will also be a very
great Discouragement to them in their se∣veral
Trades and Employments, and a fa∣tal
Discouragement of the further and bet∣ter
Settlement of this Part of your Lord∣ships
Province.</P>
<P>For a further Account of these Things,
we refer your; Lordships to Mr. <HI>Joseph
Boone,</HI> by whose Hands we send this to
your Lordships, desiring you to give Cre∣dit
to what he shall further offer to your
Lordships on our behalf. Wishing your
Lordships good Health and Prosperity, we
are</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>(Numb. 8.)
The Letter of Mrs. Blake, Widow of the late Governor, to
the Lords Proprietors.</HEAD>
<OPENER>May it please your Lordships,</OPENER>
<P>THE Share my Son has the Honour to
have with your Lordships in the Pro∣priety
of this Province, together with the
publick Concern I have for the Propriety
thereof, oblige me at this time to give you
this Trouble, and to lay before your
Lordships a short Representation of the
many Grievances the People are oppressed
with.</P>
<P>The precipitate and fatal Undertaking
against St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> and the Consequen∣ces
thereof, carried on by a Party, have in∣volved
the Country in a Debt of about
10000l. to the Ruin of our Trade, the
Toss of our Credit abroad, and infinite
Dissatisfactions at home.</P>
<P>Towards Satisfaction of which Debt, an
Act was contriv'd for forcing the Currency
of Bills of Credit to the value of 6000l.
These Bills were declar'd Current in all Pay∣ments,
and the Resuser of them finable in
double the value of the Sum refus'd; where∣by
the boldest Stroke has been given to
the Property of the Settlers in this Pro∣vince
that ever was known in any Country,
not govern'd by arbitrary Power: And the
bad Consequences of this forced Currency,
in relation to Trade with Strangers, are so
great, that they can scarcely be expressed,
without being more prolix than the
Bounds of a Letter can allow. Your
Lordships very well know, that if the
Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> did not conceive such
a Method destructive of the Peoples Pro∣perty,
and of the utmost Danger to Com∣merce,
they could not need any Projection
of Ways and Means, for raising of what
Mony the Government's Affairs do require;
but there has nothing of this been weigh'd
by your Lordships Deputies here, or by
the packed Members of our Commons
House of Assembly: Besides all this, the
<PB N="43" REF="84"/>
People are not satisfied how many Bills are
truly sent abroad; and the great Concern
Mr. <HI>James Smith,</HI> alias <HI>Serureir</HI> (who
cheated the <HI>Scots</HI> Company of a conside∣rable
Sum of Mony, and with his Keeper
made his Escape from <HI>London</HI> hither) had
in this Contrivance, doth give a Jealousy
of indirect Practices therein so prevalent
among the People, as must end in Confu∣sion
and Disorder.</P>
<P>Neither have they stopt here, but to
our present Amazement, and the Increase
of our Fears of their evil Designs for the
future, they have proceeded to pass an
Act for the Exclusion of all Dissenters from
their Right to sit in the Commons House
of Assembly, and obliging them to take
the Sacrament according to the Rites of the
Church of <HI>England;</HI> in the same Act in∣serting
a Clause, to qualify the most pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igate
of themselves for Admission into
Assemblies by a declaratory Oath, altho
they never take the Sacrament: This Act
(after much underhand Dealing) was pas∣sed
in a hurry, and carried by Twelve on∣ly
against Eleven, the above Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI>
who has neither Interest nor Reputation,
being one of the Number of the Twelve.</P>
<P>By the Artifices of these Men, the ho∣nest
and well-meaning People have been
all along set against your Lordships Consti∣tutions;
they therefore seeing, that by
passing of them, their indirect and arbi∣trary
Proceedings would be in a great mea∣sure
prevented: But now the Eyes of the
People are somewhat more opened, and
they begin to be sensible of the Delusions
and Oppressions they have been involved
in, your Deputies decline offering the
Constitutions to the People, altho your
Lordships (as I am well informed) have
often of late commanded it of them.</P>
<P>I know there has already been made to
your Lordships, by Mr. <HI>John Ash,</HI> a Repre∣sentation
of the People's Sufferings here;
and that there will be at this time, and up∣on
this Occasion, a farther Account of
these Affairs sent your Lordships by many
of the good People in the behalf of them∣selves
and others, most sensibly affected
with the Loss of these Privileges, which
by King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Charter to your Lord∣ships,
has been the Right and Usage of
their Ancestors and themselves, ever since
the first Settlement of the Province: And
my earnest Request to your Lordships is,
That in your great Wisdom, you would be
pleased to give them such a Hearing and
speedy Redress, as may conduce most to
the Glory of God, your Lordships Ho∣nour,
and the Welfare and Prosperity of
your Colony; and you will highly oblige</P>

these are the Words in the Sermon, we

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am glad to see you in the List amongst
other Learned and Worthy Divines,
and other Persons of the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign
Parts; considering the Acquaintance I
had with you at the Free-School in <HI>Lei∣cester,</HI>
and afterwards at <HI>Cambridge</HI> whilst
we were Contemporaries together there.
I'm the more embolden'd and encoura∣ged
humbly to request of you, that you'll
afford me your best Assistance in that
Honourable and Reverend Society, in
the unjust and illegal Oppression I do at
the present undergo, in this remote Cor∣ner
of the World. The true state of my
Case being summarily comprized in my
enclosed Petition to the Board of our
Lords Proprietors, I sent the same Peti∣tion
in <HI>November</HI> last to his Excellency
<HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Granville</HI> our <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the
rest of the Lords Proprietors of this Pro∣vince.
My Objections against a late Act
passed here, were not in that; so I desire
the Favour of you to peruse this, to the
end you may make the best Advantage
of it for me you can, at your Honoura∣ble
and Reverend Society. I have writ
to one Mr. <HI>George Franklin,</HI> an Apothe∣cary
in <HI>Long-Lane,</HI> over-against the <HI>Char∣ter-House</HI>
Street, to wait upon you for it,
that he may present it to our Lords
Proprietors, for fear this War time my
former may have miscarried: He was
an <HI>Eaton</HI> Scholar, whose Father was a
Doctor of Physick at <HI>Windsor,</HI> and of
<HI>Coll. Camb.</HI> He lived here 17 Years, and
was my Churchwarden two Years: He
will satisfy your Curiosity in any Que∣stions
about me, or this Countrey. I
wrote in <HI>November</HI> last to my Lord of
<HI>London,</HI> Mr. <HI>Harper</HI> at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Palace,
and to some other Friends of mine in
<HI>London,</HI> about this Business, but have as
yet received no Answer to my Letters.
I intreat you to be a Friend to me and
and my Church in your Honourable So∣ciety.
I'm known to the Two Archbi∣shops,
Sir <HI>George Wheeler,</HI> Dr. <HI>Beveridge,</HI>
Dr. <HI>Bray,</HI> and to some others of the
Worthy Members of the Society, who
I hope will be an <HI>Asylum</HI> to me in my
oppress'd Innocence. His Grace of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI>
was pleased at my leaving <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
(which was above 5 Years since)
to promise me upon my Application to
him, to assist me and my Church here, to
the best of his Power: I beg the Favour
of you to give my humble Duty to his
Grace, and to be a Remembrancer of
me to him, as you have an Opportuni∣ty,
I was personally recommended to
his Favour, by Dr. <HI>Comber,</HI> the late Dean
of <HI>Durham</HI> (of Sacred Memory) who
knew me very well at <HI>Newcastle</HI> and
<HI>Durham.</HI> I took the Oath at <HI>Monmoutl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> to King <HI>William;</HI> and after
that, his Grace of <HI>York</HI> was pleased to
vouchsafe me many Favours, whilst I
supply'd that Church, and lived in his
Diocese; which was about Two Years.
I craved his Blessing and Prayers in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
at my Leaving <HI>England;</HI> he was
pleased to be very kind to me, and I
suppose hath not yet forgot me. The
Enclosed will satisfy all the Friends
I can make in your Worthy Society,
that I do stand in need of their Patro∣nage
and best Assistance.</P>
<P>I being Married since my Arrival here,
and having Three small Children, I can∣not
as yet see <HI>England;</HI> tho the present
Circumstances of this once I lourishing
Colony, doth make me with my sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there.</P>
<P><HI>Our last Assembly (being composed of ma∣ny
Men of very loose and corrupt Morals)
did make some very odd and unjust <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fiable
Laws, which have occasioned great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and Animosities here: And I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little favour∣ing
the Dissenters, who generally are the So
<PB N="58" REF="99"/>
berest, most Numerous, and Richest People of
this Province; some Men that are now in
Power, have for that Reason been pleased to
be my Enemies.</HI> Tho' I bless God, I have
some very good Friends here, and I do
still Preach in my Church Twice every
Lord's-Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' our present Pow∣ers
have dealt as bad with me, as <HI>Pha∣raoh</HI>
dealt with the <HI>Israelites,</HI> that took
away their Straw, yet required their full
Tale of Bricks: So the present Powers
here have unjustly robb'd me of my
Legal Rights; and yet not only require
the full Tale of Sermons and Service
from me, but do multiply my Sermons
and Service, by appointing many Fast-Days
at this time that we are threatned
with an Invasion from the publick Ene∣mies
of the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> The
Ship that brings you these Papers, doth
carry to <HI>England</HI> a young Clergyman,
call'd Mr. <HI>Thomas;</HI> he was sent hither by
my Lord Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and the So∣ciety
for Propagating the Gospel in Fo∣reign
Parts, to labour in the Conversion
of a Nation of our <HI>Indians,</HI> call'd the
<HI>Yamoses,</HI> who revolted from the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
to us. He was recommended to me by
his Reverence Dr. <HI>Bray,</HI> for that Work:
The <HI>Indians</HI> being <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Chri∣stians,
desired a Priest amongst them,
and he came upon the Letters of Cap∣tain
<HI>Nairne</HI> and Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI> to the Bi∣shop
of <HI>London,</HI> for a Minister for them.
Upon his Arrival here he did not obey
his Mission and Orders at home, but
displac'd one Mr. <HI>Kendall,</HI> tho invited
into this Colony by several Letters
from his Church at <HI>Bermudas,</HI> call'd
St. <HI>George</HI>'s, where he had been several
Years settled: Poor Mr. <HI>Kendall</HI> went
distracted upon his ill usage here by some
Great Ones on this Young Man's ac∣count,
and he and his Wife forc'd out
of the Province, and I bear that he's
since dead. A young Deacon, one Mr
<HI>Wormel,</HI> (whose Father was a Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ater
of St. <HI>Catherine</HI>'s) I found here, they
us'd him so ill, that he also dy'd distract∣ed.
Mr <HI>Corb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> an Acquaintance and
Neighbour of mine in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI>
when I was Curate to Dr. <HI>Crawford,</HI> and
Mr <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> came <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by
chance, and I got him settled in a Con∣gregation
at <HI>Gooscreek,</HI> where in half a
Year they causelesly quarrel'd with him,
(tho he desired none of their Money)
and forced him out of the Colony; who
is since dead at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI>
Thus hath this Colony made Three E∣piscopally-ordained
Ministers, within
less than Five Years, the Emblems of all
Misery, and by false Calumnies and
Slanders, and malicious and false Accu∣sations,
made them most base in the eyes
of all good Christians. Their Charge
against me, and Censure and Ordinance
thereupon, to stop my Legal Salary, are
now I hope in <HI>London,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI>
will bring them to you, or others of the
Society; with a Sermon of mine on the
Fifth Commandment, from which the
most material part of the Charge is ta∣ken,
when you please.</P>
<P>Now this Young Man is gone off,
here's no Church-of-<HI>England</HI> Minister,
but my self and Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> who is a
Master of Arts of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Dublin;</HI> he
hath been here 20 Years, and formerly I
am afraid not very Regular and Sober;
tho I hope he much reformed: He hath
been arraigned at Bar here, and a Priso∣ner
near a Year, for a Passage only in a
Funeral Sermon, that reflected upon a
Deputy. So that whatsoever Stories this
young Man Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> may tell your
Society, about a late Act of Assembly
here, to invite over Ministers here, un∣less
the Queen be pleased to send us o∣ver
a Governor that will protect us ac∣cording
to Law, there's no trusting to
any Acts of this Place. The Lords have
had a Quaker for their Governor; and
their Deputies here, who call themselves
our Ordinaries, are many of them no
Friends either to Clergymen, or Learn∣ing;
as I found the last <HI>Whitsontide,</HI>
when a Bully lash'd me causlesly with
has Whip, and tore my Gown from my
Back; and upon my Complaint to the
Lords Deputies of the Indignities put
upon me, our Chief Justice, and most
of them (except the Governor) took
has Part. The Governor hath but a
Vote in the Council of Deputies, and
so they do as they please. This Bully∣ing
<PB N="59" REF="100"/>
Soldiers Creatures in the Assembly,
have been the occasion of my present
Sufferings and Troubles.</P>
<P>God forbid that I should represent the
state of things here so to you and to your
Society, as to discourage your Zeals in
the Propagation of the Gospel here, and
more particularly of that Excellent
Church, of which I am an unworthy
Member: But having by my Five Years
Residence found some people in Power
here so whimsical and humoursome, and
those too whom I have done the best of
my Endeavours to oblige, by the Drudge∣ry
of Boarding and Teaching their Chil∣dren
the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, that out of my
Respect to my Brethren of the Clergy
of University Education (which this
young Man Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> never had), I
would have them very cautious of ven∣turing
hither, till they have some Assu∣rance
of being better protected in their
Legal Rights, than I and several others
have experimentally found.</P>
<P>I do very much approve of the great∣est
part of the Act which establishes Re∣ligious
Worship in this Province. Those
parts of which I object against for just
Reasons, are contained in the inclosed
Petition to his Excellency the <HI>Palatine,</HI>
and the rest of the Lords Proprietors,
which as you have opportunity, I in∣treat
you to shew the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI>
his Reverence Dr. <HI>Bray,</HI> and to others of
your Worthy Society. I have sent
Dr. <HI>Bray</HI> some Letters, which are not
answer'd, and so do not know where
he is.</P>
<P>The Reverend Dr. <HI>Beveridge</HI> perused
my Testimonials from <HI>Stamford, Whitby,</HI>
and <HI>Newcastle,</HI> where I lived much whilst
a Non-Juror: He was much my Friend
in the Consistory at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, at my
leaving <HI>England;</HI> and I would have trou∣bled
him with a few Lines, if I had not
heard that he is deservedly promoted to
the Bishoprick of <HI>Bath and Wells.</HI> If
the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> and the Society do
send us any more Ministers, I desire they
may be Regular and Sober Men, and
such as will a little couragiously assert
the Dignity of their Function, the Rights
and Privileges of Churchmen, and their
Canons and Laws: If they be Men of
Mean and Sneaking Spirits, they will be
abused and despised here. I think the
best Service your Honourable Society
can do this young Man Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> is
to maintain him a few Years at one of
our Universities, where he may better
learn the Principles and Government of
the Church of <HI>England</HI> established by
Law, and some other useful Learning,
which I am afraid he wants.</P>
<P>I beg the Favour of you to assist me
and my Church here all you can in your
Honourable Society, and in <HI>London,</HI> by
endeavouring by a Paper under your
Hand, and some other Members of your
Society, to the Board of the Lords Pro∣prietors,
to prevent, if possible, the Act
about Establishment of Religious Wor∣ship,
being Ratified by them, with that
Clause in it, where Twenty Commis∣sioners
for Church-Government are con∣stituted.
I hope you'll pardon this Free∣dom
and Trouble from a <HI>quondam</HI>
Schoolfellow and Acquaintance in Exile.
I do remain,</P>
<CLOSER>Reverend Sir,
Your most Humble Servant,
<SIGNED>Edward Marston.</SIGNED>
I should take it kindly, if your Society, and my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> would send
us some Indigent <HI>quondam</HI> Non-Juror. I have a great Acquaintance in <HI>England</HI>
with many of those Men, as Mr. <HI>Robert Jenkins,</HI> Dr. <HI>Wagstaff,</HI> Mr. <HI>Billers,</HI> and se∣veral
others; but I hope most of them are now provided for at home in the Church
again.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>To His Excellency, John Lord Granville, Palatine, and the
rest of the True and Absolute Lords Proprietors of Caro∣lina:</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Humble Petition of the Reverend Mr. Edward Mar∣ston,
Minister of the Church of England in Charles-Town,
in South-Carolina,</HEAD>
<OPENER>Humbly sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT whereas Your Honours
Humble Petitioner was legally
put into possession of the Church of
<HI>Charles-Town</HI> in <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and there∣by
lawfully intitled to a Salary for ex∣ercising
the Offices of the Ministerial
Function in the aforesaid Church, ac∣cording
to the Rites and Ceremonies of
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> being lawfully
authorized so to do by the Right Ho∣nourable
and Right Reverend Father in
God, <HI>Henry</HI> Lord Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who
was pleased to recommend him to his
Excellency the Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> at that time
Palatine, and to the other Lords Propri∣etors,
for their Letter to their Deputies
here; as also to recommend him by
two several Letters, to the Right Ho∣nourable
Colonel <HI>Blake,</HI> at that time Go∣vernor
here; upon which Recom∣mendations
he was duly elected Mini∣ster
of <HI>Charles-Town</HI> Church, accord∣ing
to an Act of Assembly, ratified
and confirmed by his Excellency the Pa∣latine,
and the rest of the Lords Proprie∣tors;
and hath since his being settled in
the aforesaid Church, been diligent in
his Studies, and in teaching of Scholars
the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue for some Years, as
also in the due performance of his Mini∣sterial
Function; and hath also lived a
Sober and Regular Life, according to
the Canons of the Church of <HI>England:</HI>
Nevertheless the Late Lower House
of Assembly were pleased to begin a
Causeless Quarrel with him in <HI>April</HI> last,
about part of a Speech penn'd by Your
Petitioner, at the Request of the Right
Honourable Governor, wherein the e∣recting
of a Vestry in the Church of
<HI>Charles-Town,</HI> for the better managing of
the Church Affairs, and of Moneys gi∣ven
towards the erecting of a Free-School,
and other Charitable Uses, as
also some Things towards the better ob∣servation
of the Lord's Day, and the Sup∣pressing
of Vice and Wickedness here,
were recommended to their Considerati∣on.</P>
<P>The
Lower House in a Paper under
the Hand of <HI>Job How,</HI> Es{que} their Spea∣ker,
were pleased falsly to abuse Your
Petitioner, by fixing several Scurrilous
Epithets upon him, which he hopes he
hath not deserved in this Country; as
he can make appear by the Hands of
most Sober Churchmen, and Members
of Dissenters of several Denominations,
if Your Honours require it. His Ruin
was at that time threatned by some
<HI>Members of Loose and Corrupt Morals,</HI> but
was not accomplish'd. At the Sessions
of Assembly, <HI>October</HI> last, the Lower
House sent for him to lay two of his
Sermons before them, formerly preach'd
by him in his Church, before the Right
Honourable Governor; he did at first
scruple it, as not knowing them to have
any Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over him:
He went directly from their House to
the Right Honourable Governor, and
laid them before him, as Ordinary of the
Province, who was pleased at that time
to be Cholerick with him, because the
Night before he had made <HI>Landgrave
Smith</HI> a Visit, at the House of the Mes∣senger.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="102"/>
The Lower House of Assembly gave
Mr. <HI>Marston</HI> very much Trouble in at∣tending
their House about this Affair,
and drew up a Charge against him, stuft
ful of Falsities; to which he reply'd by
several Papers; in all which he deny'd
most of the Things he was charged with,
and offer'd to prove them false, in case
they would allow him a Hearing; which
they nor the Upper House never al∣low'd
him, but concurred in a Censure,
with an Ordinance thereupon, to deprive
him of his Salary, without everacquaint∣ing
him with it till after it was signed,
contrary to all Equity and Justice:
They stopt 50. <HI>l.</HI> that was due to him by
an Act of Assembly, <HI>Aug.</HI> 19. and my
Pay from that time to <HI>October</HI> the 22d,
the Day of the Date of their Ordinance.
By their <HI>Arbitrary Proceedings,</HI> Your Pe∣titioner,
his Wife, and three Small Chil∣dren,
and three more in Family, are de∣prived
of their Legal Subsistance in this
Extravagantly Dear Place, of all Neces∣saries
for the Support of Life.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner doth humbly suppli∣cate
Your Honours, That you will be
graciously pleas'd to hear his Cause
pleaded at Your Honourable Board by
his Lawyers, before You concur with
our Assembly in the Overthrow of him
and his Family in this Remote Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner was forced into Exile
for not taking the Oaths to the late King
<HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and was depri∣ved
of a Good Living in <HI>England</HI> upon
that Account; he having been a great
Sufferer for the Crown, is the more
emboldened to beg of Your Honours
what he's deny'd here, <HI>viz.</HI> the Benefit
of the Charter granted by King <HI>Charles</HI>
the IId. to his Excellency the Palatine,
and the rest of the True and Absolute
Lords Proprietors of this Province, un∣der
the Broad Seal of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>That Patent doth give no power to
the Lower House of Assembly to make
Ordinances, but only to the Lords Pro∣prietors
by themselves, or their Deputies,
and only at such times as the Assemby
of the Freemen cannot be so suddenly
called as there may be occasion to re∣quire
the same; and such Ordinances
are commanded by the aforesaid Patent
to be reasonable, and not repugnant nor
contrary, but as near as may be agreea∣ble
to the Laws and Statutes of the
Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI> and so as the same
Ordinances do not extend to the bind∣ing,
charging, or taking away of
the Right or Interest of any Per∣son
or Persons in their Freeholds,
Goods, or Chattels whatsoever. Your
Petitioner doth beg of your Ho∣nours,
that you'll be pleased to give his
Cause a Hearing before you. His Ser∣mon
on the Fifth Commandment, from
which the Lower House of Assembly
here, have taken upon Trust and Hear∣say
only, the most material part of their
Charge against him, with the other Pa∣pers
well-attested for true Copies, that

him, are now in <HI>London,</HI> and will be
laid before your Board, whenever you
please to appoint a time. Your Petitio∣ner
doth beg Pardon of you for the
Trouble of this long Petition; but Ne∣cessity
that hath no Law, hath compelled
him to it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT cannot be improper certainly, for
one of your Clergy here in <HI>Carolina,</HI>
to make an Address of this Nature to
your Lordships. If the Office be any
ones, 'tis yours to vindicate the oppress'd
Innocence of those that are under your
Discipline and Government.</P>
<P>A <HI>Vertigo</HI> and Spirit of Giddiness hath
possest some of those in Power here of
late, which makes their Heads turn
round upon their Shoulders, and their
Hearts Unquiet and Discontented within
them. They have not wanted here in
Town nor Countrey, neither these Five
Years since my Arrival, for good Ser∣mons
Twice every Lord's Day, and
many other Occasional ones, besides
some Hundreds of very useful and pra∣ctical
Books I have distributed amongst
the People here; notwithstanding many
People of this Province will not be per∣suaded
by any means to Live and Love
like Christians. <HI>I'm sorry to inform your
Honours, That most of the late Members of
Assembly, have been constant Absenters
from the Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Sup∣per;
though for these Five Years last past, I
have publickly Administred it in my Church
at the least Six times in the Year; so 'tis no
wonder they have incerted an absurd Oath
in a late Act, to be taken by Members of the
Commons House of Assembly, instead of Con∣forming
to the Church of</HI> England <HI>by receiv∣ing
the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper ac∣cording
to the Rites of the said Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whatever may be pretended by some
here,</HI> I cannot think that it will be much for
the Credit and Service of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere, that a door should be so directly
opened, and such Provisions made for the ad∣mitting
the most loose and prostigate Persons
to Sit and Vote in the making of our Laws,
who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but take the Oath appointed by the
late Act.</P>
<P>I suppose that by this time your De∣puties
in this Province have offered to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ur Honourable Board, an Act of As∣sembly
passed here, Entituled, <HI>An Act
for the Establishment of the Religious Wor∣ship
in this Province, according to the Church
of</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I do humbly offer the following Ar∣guments
and Objections against that part
of it, which constitutes a Court of
Twenty Commissioners for Ecclesiastical
Causes, before it be ratified by your
Lordships.</P>
<P>'Tis well known that by the common
Law of <HI>England,</HI> all manner of Ecclesi∣astical
Jurisdiction was in the Crown,
and declared to be so by the Act of 1.
<HI>Eliz.</HI> I. and by that Act Power given to
the Crown, to assign Commissioners to
exercise this Jurisdiction; which was
accordingly done by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
King <HI>James</HI> the First, and King <HI>Charles</HI>
the First, until the 17<HI>th</HI> Year of His
Reign; When an Act was made, which
with a <HI>Non Obstante,</HI> to the 1. <HI>Eliz.</HI> I. Re∣pealed,
Annulled, Revoked, Annihilated,
and utterly made void for ever that Clause
of the 1. <HI>Eliz.</HI> I. whereby the Crown
had Power by Letters Patents to erect an
High Commission Court in Ecclesiasti∣cal
Matters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>By which aforementioned Act, the
Power of exercising Ecclesiastical Juris∣diction
by Commissioners is taken away,
that it provides no such Power shall ever
for the future be delegated by the Crown
to any Person or Persons whatsoever.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> I object against that Paragraph
of the Act, because it seems to contra∣dict,
or however is not reconcileable to
the Preamble of that Act, which settles
a Maintenance on the Minister of the
Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Charles-Town.</HI> The
Preamble of that Act of Assembly, is,
Whereas his late Majesty, King <HI>Charles</HI>
the II. of Blessed and Happy Memory,
hath by his Letters Patents, and Royal
Grants of the Province of <HI>Carolina,</HI> to
<PB N="63" REF="104"/>
the Lords Proprietors provided and taken
care, That no Religious Minister, ex∣cept
that by Law established in the
Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> should have any
publick Maintenance.</P>
<P>'Tis well known, that Episcopa∣cy
is established by Law in the Kingdom
of <HI>England,</HI> and all Episcopally ordained
Ministers by their Oath of Canonical
Obedience are bound to approve of
Church Government by Bishops.</P>
<P>The Oath of Canonical Obedience is
this:
<Q><P>I <HI>E. M.</HI> do Swear, That I do approve
the Doctrine and Discipline, or Government
Establish'd in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as
concerning all Things necessary to Salva∣tion,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will I ever give my consent to alter
this Government of this Church, by Arch∣bishops,
Bishops, Deans, and Arch-Deacons,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> as it stands now Established, and as by
Law it ought to stand. And all these things
I do plainly and sincerely Acknowledge and
Swear, according to the common Sense and Un∣derstanding
of the same Words without Equi∣vocation,
or mental Evasion, or secret Reser∣vation
whatsoever. And this I do heartily,
willingly, and truly, upon the Faith of a
Christian. So help me God in Jesus Christ.</P></Q></P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> I do object against part of the
Act, which erects High Commissioners
for Ecclesiastical Causes, as being con∣trary
to the Charter under the Broad
Seal of <HI>England</HI> to this Province.</P>
<P>That Charter says, That all By-Laws
of this Province shall be consonant to
Reason, and as near as may be conveni∣ently
agreeable to the Laws and Customs
of the Realm of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis well known, that King <HI>James</HI> the
II's. High Commission Court in Ecclesi∣astical
Affairs was condemned as Illegal,
by the Learned Divines and Lawyers of
<HI>England;</HI> and if the King or Queen who
are Supream in Ecclesiastical Affairs,
cannot legally erect such Commissioners,
sure the subordinate Powers under them
have no legal Power to constitute such
Commissioners. The Charter farther
says, that the By-Laws of this Province
must be consonant to Reason. In the Act
of Assembly that erects Commissioners
in Ecclesiastical Affairs, 'tis Enacted,
That whatever Minister shall Marry any
within the degree of Consanguinity
forbidden in the Table of Marriage, he
shall forfeit an 100 <HI>l.</HI> though it be with
a License from the Governor, or Publi∣cation
of the Banns Three several Holi∣days.
How Consonant that part of the
Law is to Reason, I leave to all judicious
People to judge.</P>
<P>The only design of Marriage Licen∣ses
that I know of being to satisfy the
Minister, that the Coast is clear from all
Precontracts, Consanguinity, or other
lawful Letts and Impediments of Mar∣riage.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly.</HI>
I object against Fourteen of the
Twenty Commissioners appointed by
the Act, for displacing Ministers be∣cause
they were Members of the late
Assembly: Wherein Mr. <HI>Edward Marston</HI>
was unfairly and unjustly used: There∣fore
he protests against the Power over
him they may challenge by Virtue of
that Act. <HI>Besides, they are many of them
constant Absenters from the Church;</HI> and
<HI>Eleven of them were never known to receive
the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and so
perhaps their Religion may be to seek.</HI> For the
aforesaid and several other weighty Rea∣sons,
your Petitioner, Mr. <HI>Edward Marston,</HI>
legal Minister of St. <HI>Phillip</HI>'s Church in
<HI>Charles-Town,</HI> doth beg of your Honours
not to ratify that part of the Act offer'd
to your Board, by your Deputies here,
in which, Twenty Commissioners are
impower'd to displace Ministers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
And in case they give Him Molestation
by Virtue of that Act passed here, before
your Honours have confirmed it, He
doth protest against their Lawful
Power over Him as Commissioners; and
<PB N="64" REF="105"/>
appeals to your Honourable Board from
them, and to the Queen's Courts of Ju∣stice
in <HI>England;</HI> and as a Priest of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> He will Appeal to
his Bishop and his Courts. Which He
presumes he may do by a particular-Law
of the Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Your Petitioner shall ever Pray for your

<HEAD>The CASE of the Reverend Mr. Edward
Marston, Minister of the Church belong∣ing
to the Church of England in Charles-Town,
in South Carolina, truly stated.</HEAD>
<P>AT the Meeting of the General As∣sembly
of the Province in <HI>April,</HI>
in 1704. he was order'd by the Right
Honourable Governour Sir <HI>Nath. John∣ston,</HI>
to write down in a Paper what he
thought would be proper, for the better
Suppressing of Vice and Wickedness in
this Town and Country, especially on
the Lord's Day; and what other Things
he thought convenient for the better
Management of the Affairs of the Church,
and publick Monies given towards the
Erecting of a Free-School, and other pi∣ous
Uses. Mr. <HI>Marston</HI> obey'd the Order,
and when the Governour had read the
Paper, he reply'd, That it was modest
and reasonable, and that he would pro∣pose
the Contents thereof to the As∣sembly,
which accordingly he did: Some
few Days after, he sent for Mr. <HI>Marston,</HI>
to shew him the Reply of the Lower
House of Assembly to that part of the
Speech, penn'd by Mr. <HI>Marston,</HI> under
the Hand of <HI>Job How,</HI> Es{que} Speaker, in
which Mr. <HI>Marston</HI> was scurrilously abused,
and very false Epithets fix'd upon him by
them.</P>
<P>That part of the Governour's Speech
is in Packet to Br. <HI>Wigly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>About the same time, the Right Ho∣nourable
Governour acquainted Mr.</HI> Mar∣ston,
That some of the Members of the As∣sembly
were endeavouring to wrest the Ec∣clesiastical
Jurisdiction of the Province out
of the Hands of the Right Honourable and
Right Reverend Father in God, <HI>Henry,</HI>
Lord Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and out of the
Hands of the Right Honourable Governour,
Sir <HI>Nathaniel Johnston,</HI> as Ordinary;
<HI>which was the Occasion of the Paper,
called,</HI> A Reply to those Members, <HI>&amp;c. sent
in the aforesaid Packet also.</HI></P>
<P>The Governour was pleased to quash
their Design at that Time; so the Pa∣per
was never sent to any of them; but
being threaten'd in the House of Co∣lonel
<HI>Risbee,</HI> one of the Members of the
Assembly, about <HI>August</HI> last, <HI>That at the
next Sessions of Assembly I should see the
Bishop of</HI> London'<HI>s Jurisdiction abolish'd
here,</HI> I put the aforesaid Reply into the
Hands of Col. <HI>Risbee.</HI></P>
<P>Sometime after the Meeting of the
Assembly in <HI>Octob.</HI> last, Landgrave <HI>Smith</HI>
was made a Prisoner, by a Vote of the
Lower House of Assembly. On the first
Day of his Confinement Mr <HI>Marston</HI>
made him a Visit, to acquaint him with
the Death of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Wil∣liam
Corbin,</HI> for sometime Minister of the
Congregation at <HI>Goos Creck</HI> in this Co∣lony:
The next Morning, after my
Visit, Col. <HI>Risbee</HI> moved in the Lower
House, as soon as it was set, That I
should be order'd to say before the House
2 Sermons preach'd by me, one in <HI>April</HI>
last, the other about Three Weeks be∣fore.
I obey'd their Order, and attend∣ed
the House, with the Two Members
that came for me. My Paper in Packet
to Br <HI>Wigly,</HI> dated <HI>October</HI> the 11th, will
acquaint you with my Answer to them,
<PB N="66" REF="107"/>
as the other Papers will with all the Pro∣ceedings
of the Assembly against me af∣ter
that.</P>
<P>I went from the Lower House of As∣sembly
directly to the Right Honourable
the Governour, and laid the Sermons
before him, as Ordinary, he also having
been an Auditor of both of them. He
was pleased at that Time to be chole∣rick
and angry, because I had visited
Landgrave <HI>Smith,</HI> and refused to take
Notice of my Sermons, or of the Trou∣ble
the Lower House of Assembly had
given me about them. I apply'd my
self to him and the Council by several
submissive Letters, in all which I hum∣bly
crav'd of them, That I might be
allow'd an Hearing to vindicate my self
from those false Accusations which were
charged against me by the Lower House
of Assembly. They would not allow me
an Hearing, but concurr'd with the Lower
House in the Censure and Ordinance
thereupon, to deprive me of my Sala∣ry,
the necessary Subsistence of my self,
a Wife, Three Children, and Three
more in Family, in this extravagantly
dear Place of all Necessaries for the
Support of Life.</P>
<P>I was not made acquainted with the
Conference of both the Houses about
this Affair; but they chose that very
Day to agree upon my Ruine, in which
they knew I was busied to prepare a
Funeral Sermon for Capt. <HI>Weekly.</HI></P>
<P>I'm at the present a Confessor, for assert∣ing
the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of the
Bishop of <HI>London</HI> in this Province, and
the Prerogative of being Ordinary here,
of our Right Honourable the Gover∣nour,
against some illiterate and unrea∣sonable
Men of the Lower House of
Assembly of this Province, who at their
Sessions in <HI>April</HI> last, were endeavouring
to wrest the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
out of the aforesaid Hands; and at their
last Session in <HI>October,</HI> did accomplish
their Design, by getting an Act pass'd
for con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ituting Ruling Lay-Elders, or
<HI>Carolina</HI> Bishops, to turn out Clergy∣men
from their Churches as they please.
But, I hope, it will be proved, That
their new Act of Assembly is repug∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t,
and contrary to the Laws of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and therefore by the Patent un∣der
the Broad-Seal of <HI>England,</HI> of no
Validity here.</P>
<P>Some Paragraphs out of the Patent
under the Broad-Seal of <HI>England</HI> to the
Lords Proprietors of <HI>Carolina,</HI> in the
last of the Patents from King <HI>Charles</HI>
the Second.</P>
<P>No Law to be imposed, without the
Assent of the Freemen, or of the great∣est
part of them▪ or of their Dele∣gates
or Deputies, they are to be pub∣lished.</P>
<P>No
other Power granted to the De∣legates,
or Deputies of the Freemen,
by the Patent under the Broad-Seal,
but of giving their Assent to enact
Laws.</P>
<P>And because Assemblies of the Dele∣gates
aud Deputies of the Freemen can∣not
be so suddenly called, as there may
be Occasion to require the same; Power
is given to the Lords Proprietors, by
themselves, or their Deputies or Ma∣gistrates
in that Behalf lawfully au∣thoriz'd,
full Power and Authority from
Time to Time to make and ordain fit
and wholsome Orders and Ordinances
within the Province or Territory afore∣said,
and to publish the same to all to
whom it may concern.</P>
<P>Which Laws and Ordinances we do
by these Presents strictly charge and
command to be inviolably observ'd with∣in
the said Province, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> under the
Penalties therein express'd;—so as
such Laws and Ordinances be reasona∣ble,
and not repugnant nor contrary,
but as near as may be agreeable to the
Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom of
<HI>England.</HI> And so as the same Ordi∣nances
do not extend to the binding,
charging, or taking away of the Right
or Interest of any Person or Persons in
their Freehold, Goods, or Chattels what∣soever.</P>
<P>Faith,
Allegiance and Sovereign Do∣minion,
are, by the Patent, due to King
<HI>Charles</HI> the Second, his Heirs and Suc∣cessors
for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="108"/>
By the Patent, the Province of <HI>Caro∣lina</HI>
is held of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI>
as the Mannor of East <HI>Greenwich,</HI> in
the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> in free and com∣mon
Soccage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Yielding and paying Yearly to the
Crown of <HI>England</HI> for the same the
Fourth part of all Gold and Silver
Ore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> over and besides the Yearly Rent
of Twenty Marks.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere,</HI> Whether the Delegates and
Deputies of the Freemen, whose Lords
do hold their Lands of the Crown of
<HI>England,</HI> in the aforesaid Tenure, can
legally assume or claim to themselves the
Power, Privileges and Immunities of the
House of Commons of the High Court
of Parliament in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lower House of Assembly in <HI>Ca∣rolina</HI>
do imprison, by a Vote of the
House, <HI>sine Die,</HI> and bid Defiance to
the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, though made
in Force here by an Act of Assem∣bly.</P>
