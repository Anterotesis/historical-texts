<HEAD>THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BIRDS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The IBIS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which the Romans adopted. It has no name in European languages, as being unknown in our climates. Ac∣cording to Albertus, it was called in Egyptian <HI>Leheras.</HI> In Avi∣cenna, the word <HI>Anschuz</HI> denotes the Ibis. St. Jerome was mis∣taken in translating <HI>Janschuph (Leviticus,</HI> ii. <HI>Isaiah,</HI> xxxiv.) by Ibis, for a nocturnal bird is meant in that passage. Some inter∣preters rendor the Hebrew word <HI>Tinschemet</HI> by Ibis.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the superstitious practices that have ever degraded the human race, the wor∣ship of animals might be deemed the most abject and the most absurd: and yet did that propen∣sity originate from the purest of motives. In the early ages of the world, man was on all sides encompassed by dangers, and had to struggle naked and unarmed against the formidable at∣tacks of his numerous foes. Those animals, therefore, which conspired with his efforts to destroy and eradicate the hostile tribes, were na∣turally
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
entitled to his regard and affection. But the sentiment of gratitude afterwards degene∣rated into veneration; and fear and interest, nourishing the groveling propension, both the useful and the pernicious creatures were alike exalted into the rank of gods.</P>
<P>Egypt is one of those countries where animal∣worship was of the highest antiquity, and ob∣served with the most scrupulous attention, for many ages; and that humiliating species of ido∣latry, which is authenticated by all the monu∣ments that have been transmitted to posterity, seems to prove, that the original settlers had long contended with the noxious animals. In fact, crocodiles, serpents, grasshoppers, and all the other loathsome creatures, teemed in the deep and spacious mud, deluged by the annual inundation of the river. The heat of a tropical sun fostering the rich slime would engender infi∣nite numbers of offensive and shapeless beings, which would successively be effaced, till the earth, purged of its impurities, was occupied by nobler inhabitants.</P>
<P><Q>"Swarms of little venomous serpents," the early historians relate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rodotus, <HI>Euterpe,</HI> N° 76. Aelian, Solinus, Marcellinus, Pomponius Mela, <HI>lib.</HI> iii. 8.</NOTE>, “rose out of the slime of marshes, and flying in a great body towards Egypt, would have entered into that country and spread desolation, had not the Ibis op∣posed itself to their inroad, and repelled them.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10"/>
Was not this the source of the superstitious ve∣neration paid to that bird? The priests encou∣raged the notions of the vulgar; when the gods, they said, deigned to assume a visible form, it was that of the Ibis. Their tutelar deity <HI>Thoth</HI> or Mercury, the inventor of arts and of laws, had already undergone that transformation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plato in <HI>Phaedr.</HI></NOTE>; and Ovid, faithful to this ancient mythology, in the battle of the gods and giants, conceals Mer∣cury under the wings of an Ibis, &amp;c <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Metam. <HI>lib.</HI> v.</NOTE>. But set∣ting aside all these fables, we have still to exa∣mine the history of the combats between these birds and the serpents. Herodotus assures us, that he went to view the field of battle. <Q>“Near the town Butus,”</Q> he says▪ <Q>“on the confines of Arabia, where the mountains open into the vast plain of Egypt, I there saw immense heaps of serpents' bones <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herodotus, <HI>Euterpe,</HI> N<SUP>os</SUP> 75 and 76.</NOTE>.”</Q> Cicero cites this passage <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. <HI>De Nat. Deorum.</HI></NOTE>, and Pliny seems to confirm it, by say∣ing, that the Egyptians invoke the Ibises against the invasion of serpents <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. Lib. x. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We read also in the historian Josephus, that when Moses made war on the Aethiopians, he carried, in cages of <HI>papyrus,</HI> a great number of Ibises, to oppose them to the serpents <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antiq. Judaic.</HI> lib. ii. 10.</NOTE>. This
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
story, which is not very probable, is easily ex∣plained by a fact mentioned by Maillet, in his description of Egypt: <Q>“A bird named <HI>Pharaoh's capon</HI> (known to be the Ibis) follows more than an hundred leagues the caravans in their route to Mecca, for the sake of the dung left at the encampments, though at other times it is never seen on that track <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Description de l'Egypt, <HI>partie</HI> II. p. 23.</NOTE>”</Q>. We may presume, that the Ibises thus accompanied the Hebrew nation in their march out of Egypt; and that Josephus has disfigured the fact, by as∣cribing to the prudence of the general what was due only to the instinct of the birds; and has introduced the army of Aethiopians and the cages of papyrus to embellish his narration, and to exalt our idea of the legislator of the Jews.</P>
<P>To kill the Ibis was, among the Egyptians, forbidden under pain of death <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herodotus, <HI>uti supra.</HI></NOTE>. That peo∣ple, whose temper was equally gloomy and vain, invented the lugubrious art of preparing mummies, by which they endeavoured, we may say, to perpetuate death, and to counteract the benevolent views of nature, which, in compas∣sion to our feelings, labours assiduously to efface every dismal and funereal image. Not only were they solicitous to preserve human bodies, they applied their skill in embalming to the sacred animals. Many receptacles of mum∣mies
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
which have been dug up in the plain of Saccara are called <HI>bird-pits,</HI> because only birds are found embalmed, particularly the Ibis, con∣tained in tall earthen pots, whose orifice is stopped with cement. We have received several of these vessels; and in all of them we discover∣ed a sort of doll, formed by the bandages which encased the bird, of which the greatest part fell into black dust when the ligatures were removed. We could however perceive all the bones of a bird, with the feathers sticking to some bits of flesh that remained solid. From these frag∣ments we could judge of the size of the bird, which was nearly equal to that of the curlew; and the bill, which was preserved in two of the mummies, showed the genus: it was as thick as that of a stork, was curved like the bill of the curlew, but not channelled: and as its curva∣ture is equal throughout, we may place the Ibis between the stork and the curlews <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See one of the bills represented by Edwards, <HI>plate</HI> 105.</NOTE>. In fact, so nearly is it related to both these genera of birds, that the modern naturalists have ranged it with the latter, and the ancients had classed it with the former. <Q>Herodotus has distinctly cha∣racterized the Ibis, by saying that “its bill is much hooked, and its legs like those of the crane." He takes notice of two species: The first," he relates, "is entirely black; the second, which constantly occurs, is all
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
white, except the tips of the feathers of the wing and tail, which are very black; and the neck and head, which are only covered with skin.”</Q></P>
<P>But I must here remove the obscurity with which this passage of Herodotus has been in∣volved by the ignorance of translators, and which casts an air of fable and absurdity on the whole. <Q>A clause which ought to have been rendered literally, <HI>“which oftener occur among men's feet,</HI> runs thus in their versions, <HI>these indeed have feet like men.”</HI></Q> Naturalists, at a loss to conceive the import of this odd compa∣rison, have strained to explain or palliate it. They suppose that Herodotus mistook the stork for the white ibis, and imagined its flat toes to resemble those of a man. But this interpreta∣tion was unsatisfactory; and the Ibis with human feet might have been rejected among the fables. Yet under this absurd image was it admitted as a real existence; and we cannot help being sur∣prized to find at present this account inserted in the memoirs of a learned academy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“The other species (the White Ibis) has its feet fashioned like the human feet.”</Q> <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>moires de l'Academie des Inscriptions &amp; Belles Lettres,</HI> tome ix. p. 28.</P></NOTE>: though the chimera is only the production of the trans∣lator of that ancient historian, whose candour in acknowledging the uncertainty of his narratives, when drawn from other information, ought to
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
procure him credit in subjects that came under his own observation.</P>
<P>Aristotle, too, discriminates two species of Ibis; he adds, that the white kind is spread over all Egypt, except near Pelusium, where only the black ones occur, which are seen in no other part of the country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Animal. <HI>lib.</HI> ix. 27.</NOTE>. Pliny repeats this par∣ticular observation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. <HI>lib.</HI> x. 30.</NOTE>. But all the ancients, at the same time that they remark the difference of the two birds in point of colour, ascribe to them both the same common figure, habits, and instincts; and regard Egypt, in exclusion to every other country, as their proper abode <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strabo places them also on a fresh-water lake, near Lichas, in the extremity of Africa.</NOTE>. If it was carried abroad, they alledge, it lan∣guished out its days, consumed by the desire of revisiting its native soil <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Aelian.</NOTE>. A bird so ardently attached to its country, naturally became the emblem of it: the figure of the Ibis, in the hieroglyphics, denotes Egypt, and few images or characters are oftener repeated on all the mo∣numents. They appear on most of the obe∣lisks; on the base of the statue of the Nile, at the Belvidere in Rome, and also in the garden of the Thuilleries at Paris. In the medal of Adrian, where Egypt appears prostrate, the Ibis is placed at her side; and this bird is figured with an
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
elephant in the medal of Quintus Marius, to signify Egypt and Lybia, the scenes of his ex∣ploits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If such was the popular and ancient regard paid to the Ibis, it is not surprizing that its his∣tory has been charged with fables. It has been said to procreate with its bill <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aelian.</NOTE>: Solinus seems not to doubt this; but Aristotle justly ridicules the notion of virgin purity in this sacred bird <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Generatione Animalium, lib.</HI> iii. 6.</NOTE>. Pierius relates a wonder of an opposite kind; he says that, according to the ancients, the ba∣silisk was hatched from an Ibis' egg, formed in that bird from the venom of all the serpents which it devoured. They have also asserted that the crocodiles and serpents, when touched with an Ibis' feather, remained motionless as if enchanted, and often died on the spot. Zoro∣aster, Democritus, and Philo have advanced these tales; and other authors have represented it as living to an extreme age: the priests of Hermopolis pretended even that it might be immortal, and as a proof they showed Appion an Ibis so old, they said, that it was no more subject to death.</P>
<P>These are but part of the fictions on the sub∣ject of the Ibis, fabricated in the religious land of Egypt: superstition ever runs into extremes; but if we consider the political motives that
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
would induce a legislator to establish the wor∣ship of useful animals, we must admit the ne∣cessity in that country of preserving and multi∣plying them, in order to repress or extirpate the noxious tribes. Cicero <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Aegyptii nullam belluam, nisi ob aliquam utilitatem quam ex eâ caperent, consecrârunt velut Ibes, maximam vim serpentium consiciunt, cum sint aves excclsae, cruribus rigidis, corneo prcceroque rostro; aver∣tunt pestem ab Aegypto, cùm volucres angues, ex vastitate Lybiae, vento Africo invectas, intersiciunt atque consumunt, ex quo fit ut illae nec morsu vivae noceant nec odore mortuae; eam ob rem invocantur ab Aegyptiis Ibes.—</HI>De Nat. Deor. <HI>lib.</HI> i.</P>
<P>M. Perrault has mistaken the latter part of this sentence. <HI>An∣ciens Memoires de l' Academie,</HI> tom. iii. partie 3.</P></NOTE> remarks judiciously, that no animals were held sacred by the Egyp∣tians but such as merited regard from extreme utility to them: an <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We can scarce give this as the reason of the worship of the crocodile: but that animal had adoration paid it only in a single city of the Arsinoïte tribe, while its antagonist, the ichneumon, was venerated all over Egypt. Besides, in this city of crocodiles, these destructive animals were worshipped under the impression of fear, with the idle view to detain them from visiting a place whi∣ther the stream naturally never bor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them.</NOTE> opinion moderate and wise, very different from the sentence of the severe and violent Juvenal, who reckons the veneration paid to the Ibis among the crimes of Egypt; and inveighs against that worship, which superstition no doubt overstrained, but which prudence ought to maintain; since such is the weakness of man, that the most profound law∣givers have made that spurious passion the foun∣dation of their structures.</P>
<P>But to consider the natural history of the Ibis,
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
we find it has a strong appetite to feed on ser∣pents, and even a sort of antipathy to all rep∣tiles. Belon assures us that it continues to kill them, though sated with prey. Diodorus Si∣culus says, that night and day the Ibis, walking by the verge of the water, watches reptiles, searching for their eggs, and destroying the beetles and grasshoppers which they meet. Accustomed to respectful treatment in Egypt, these birds advanced without fear into the midst of the cities. Strabo relates, that they filled the streets and lanes of Alexandria to such a degree as to become troublesome and importunate, con∣suming indeed the filth, but also attacking pro∣visions, and defiling every thing with their dung: inconveniencies which would shock the delicate and polished Greek, though the Egyp∣tians so grossly superstitious, might cheerfully submit to them.</P>
<P>These birds breed on the palm-trees, and place their nest in the thick bunches of the sharp leaves, to be safe from the attacks of their enemies, the cats <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philo, <HI>de propriet. Animal.</HI></NOTE>. It appears that they lay four eggs, such at least is the number which we may infer from the explication given by Pignorius of the table of Isiacus: <Q>He says, that the Ibis “makes its eggs after the manner of the moon <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ad lunae rationem ova fingit.</HI> Mens.

<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
other import than what Dr. Shaw has noticed, that the bird lays as many eggs as the moon has phases.

<P>THIS bird is somewhat larger than the cur∣lew, and somewhat smaller than the stork: its length from the point of the bill to the end of the nails is about three feet and an half. Herodotus describes it as having tall naked legs; the face and front equally destitute of feathers; the bill hooked; the quills of the tail and wings black, and the rest of the plumage white. To these characters we shall add some other properties not mentioned by the ancient historian: The bill is rounded, and terminates in a blunt point; the neck is of an equal thick∣ness throughout, and not clothed with pendant feathers like that of the stork.</P>
<P>Perrault described and dissected one of these birds, which had lived in the <HI>menagerie</HI> at Ver∣sailles. He found, on comparing it with a stork, that it was smaller, but its bill and feet proportionally longer; that the feet of the stork were only four parts of the whole length of the
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
bird, while those of the Ibis were five parts. He observed the same proportional difference to obtain between their bills and their necks. The wings appeared very large; their quills were black, and all the rest of the plumage was white, inclined a little to rusty, and diversified only by some purple and reddish spots under the wings; the top of the head, the orbits, and the under side of the throat, were void of feathers, but covered by a red wrinkled skin; the bill was thick at the root, round, an inch and half in diameter, and curved the whole length; it was of a light yellow at its origin and deep orange near the extremity: the sides of the bill were sharp, and so hard that they might cut serpents <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Corneo proceroque rostro.</HI> Cicero, <HI>uti supra.</HI></NOTE>, which is probably the way that the bird takes to destroy them; for the tip being blunt it could scarce pierce them.</P>
<P>The lower part of the legs was red, and mea∣sured more than four inches; though Belon, in his figure of the black ibis, represents it as only one inch in length; both that part and the foot were entirely covered with hexagonal scales. The scales which incrusted the toes were cut into tablets, and the nails were point∣ed, straight, and blackish. Both sides of the mid-toe were bordered by the rudiments of a membrane, which, in the two other toes, ap∣peared only on the inside.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="22"/>
Though the Ibis is not granivorous, its ven∣tricle is a sort of gizzard, whose inner mem∣brane is rough and wrinkled. We have more than once remarked this incongruity in the structure of birds; in the cassowary, for instance, which does not feed on flesh, the stomach is membranous like that of the eagle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An interesting circumstance in this description concerns the passage of the chyle in the intestines of birds. Injections were made into the mesenteric vein of one of the storks dissected with the Ibis, and the liquor passed into the cavity of the intestines: and a portion of intestine having been filled with milk and tied at both ends, the compressed liquor passed into the mesenteric vein. Perhaps, adds the anatomist, this passage is common to all the tribe of birds; and as they exhibit no lacteal veins, we may justly conjecture, that this is the course of the chyle in passing from the intestines into the mesentery.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Perrault found the intestines to be four feet eight inches long; the heart was of a middling size, and not extremely large, as Merula pre∣tended; the tongue, which was very short, and concealed at the bottom of the bill, was only a small cartilage invested by a fleshy membrane; which gave occasion to Solinus' remark, that this bird had no bill. The globe of the eye was small, not exceeding six lines in diameter. <Q>"This White Ibis," says Perrault, “and ano∣ther which was kept at the <HI>menagerie</HI> at Ver∣sailles, both of them brought from Egypt, were the only birds of this kind ever seen in France.”</Q> According to him, all the descriptions of the modern authors have been borrowed from the
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
ancients. This remark appears to be just; for Belon did not recognize the White Ibis in Egypt, which is improbable, if he had not taken it for a stork. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the White Ibis, <HI>Tantalus-Ibis:</HI> "Its face is red, its bill yellow, its feet gray, its wing-quills black, its body tawny-whitish."</NOTE></P>

the head, from the origin of the bill to beyond the eyes. This Curlew is large, but not so thick as the European; its legs are taller, and its bill longer and stronger, and much thicker near the head.

<P>These birds keep together in flocks, whether they fly or perch on trees, where their number and their flame-coloured plumage render them conspicuous objects <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The guaras fly in flocks, and their scarlet plumage forms a very beautiful spectacle in the beams of the sun.”</Q> <HI>Hist.

Seldom one of these Curlews is seen alone, or if one should happen

to stray from the flock, it hastens to join its companions. But these societies are distinguish∣ed by their age, the old birds keeping separate from the young. Their hatches begin in Ja∣nuary and end in May; they lay their eggs, which are greenish, in the large plants that grow under the mangroves, or amidst the bram∣bles, on some sticks collected. The young ones may easily be caught by the hand, even when the mother leads them out to search for insects and small crabs, which are their principal food: they are not wild, and they soon become recon∣ciled to the domestic state. <Q>"I reared one," says M. de la Borde, “which I have kept up∣wards of two years; it fed out of my hand very familiarly, and never missed the time of dinner and supper: it ate bread, flesh either raw, dressed, or salted, fish, every thing in short was acceptable; it showed however a pre∣ference to fowls' and fishes' guts, and with that view it frequently paid a visit to the kitchen. At other times it was constantly employed seeking earth-worms, either round the house or in the garden beside the negro who was at work on the ground. In the evening it re∣tired of its own accord into a hen-house, where it reposed with an hundred fowls: it roosted on the highest bar, and with violent strokes of its bill drove off all the hens that had occu∣pied its place; and often during the night it took pleasure in annoying its fellow-lodgers.
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
It was rouzed early in the morning, and be∣gan by making three or four circuits round the house; sometimes it went to the sea∣shore, but did not stop there. I never heard it utter any cry except a little croaking, which seemed to be an expression of fear at the sight of a dog or other animal. It had a great anti∣pathy to cats, but did not fear them; ran fierce and undaunted upon them. It was killed near the house in a bog by a sportsman, who took it for a wild curlew.”</Q></P>

<P>WE abridge the name <HI>acacalotl,</HI> bestowed on this curlew in Mexico, into <HI>Acalot:</HI> it is indigenous in that country; and, like most of the rest, its front is bald and covered with a reddish skin: its bill is blue; the neck and back of the head clothed with feathers, which are brown in∣termixed with white and green; the wings shine with green and purple reflections.

The Greeks, besides giving it other names expressive of its cry, denominated it <HI>the wild peacock</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>), on account of its crest and its elegant colours: yet this crest is very different from
<PB N="48" REF="58"/>
that of the peacock, it consisting only of some long unwebbed and very slender feathers; and of its plumage, the under side is white, the upper of a dark east, and it is only when held close to the eye that we can perceive the brilliant gold reflections. In some parts of France, the Lap∣wing has the denomination of <HI>dix-huit</HI> (eigh∣teen) because these two syllables, pronounced faintly, express, with tolerable accuracy, its cry. which many languages have endeavoured to de∣note by imitative sounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gyfytz, Giwitz, Kiwitz, Czieik,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. In rising up it vents one or two screams, which it often repeats at intervals as it flies, even during the night <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It imitates the tremulous voice of a goat, while it flies in the night-time. <HI>Rzacynski.</HI></NOTE>: its wings are powerful, and much exercised; for in the air it long maintains its flight, and rises to a great height, and on the ground it springs and bounds, and skims from spot to spot.</P>
<P>The Lapwing is joyous, and perpetually in motion; it sports and frolics a thousand ways in the air; it assumes, at times, every imaginable posture, its belly sometimes even turned upwards or sidewise, and its wings expanded perpendi∣cularly; and no bird wheels and flickers so nimbly.</P>
<P>The Lapwings arrive in our meadows in great flocks about the beginning of March, or even as early as the end of February, after the first open weather, when the wind is southerly. At this
<PB N="49" REF="59"/>
season they alight in the fields of green corn <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon, Nat. des Oiseaux, <HI>liv.</HI> iv. 17.</NOTE>, or in the morning cover the low marshy grounds in search of worms, which they dextrously draw from their holes: when the bird meets with one of those little clusters of pellets, or rolls of earth, which are thrown out by the worm's perfora∣tions, it first gently removes the mould from the mouth of the hole, strikes the ground at the side with its foot, and steadily and attentively waits the issue; the reptile, alarmed by the shock, emerges from its retreat, and is instantly seized <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“To ascertain this circumstance," says M. Baillon, "I employed the same stratagem: in a field of green corn, and in the garden, I beat the earth for a short time, and I saw the worms coming out; I pressed down a stake, which I then turned in all directions to shake the soil: this method, which is said to be used by the cur∣lews, succeeds still quicker; the worms crawled out in crowds, even at the distance of a fathom from the stake.”</Q></P></NOTE>. In the evening the Lapwings pursue a different plan; they run along the grass, and feel under their feet the worms, which now come forth, invited by the coolness of the air: thus they obtain a plentiful meal, and afterwards they wash their bill and feet in the small pools or rivulets.</P>
<P>These birds are difficult to be approached, and seem to descry the fowler at a great dis∣tance: we can gain nearer them in a strong wind, for then they fly with difficulty. When they are congregated and ready to rise together, they all flap their wings with an equal motion; and as they keep close to each other, and their
<PB N="50" REF="60"/>
under side is white, the ground, which was darkened by their numbers, appears at once white. But this great society, which these birds form on their arrival, dissolves when the vernal warmth invites to love, and in two or three days they disperse. The signal is given by battles between the males; the females seem to avoid the contentions, and first abandon the flock, as if unconcerned in the quarrels: but, in fact, they draw off the combatants to form a sweeter and more intimate union, which lasts three months.</P>
<P>The hatch is conducted in April; it consists of three or four ablong eggs, of a dull green, much spotted with black: these are dropped in the marshes, on the little heads or clods of earth raised above the surface of the plain; a precau∣tion which seems necessary to guard against the accidental swelling of the water, but which, however, leaves the nest exposed. To make a site for it, they are contented with cropping, close to the surface, a little round space in the grass, which soon withers about it, from the heat of incubation; and if we find the grass fresh and verdant, we may infer that the eggs have not been covered. It is said, that these eggs are good to eat, and in many provinces great quan∣tities are gathered for market. But is it not an incroachment on the rights of nature, an inva∣sion on her property, to destroy thus the tender germs of species which we cannot multiply?
<PB N="51" REF="61"/>
The eggs of domestic poultry are in a manner our own creation, but those of independent birds belong only to the common mother of all.</P>
<P>The incubation of the Lapwing, as in most other birds, lasts twenty days: the female sits assiduously; if any thing alarms it, and drives it from its nest, it runs a little way, cowering through the grass, and does not rise till at a good distance from its eggs, that it may not betray the spot. The old hens, whose nests have been robbed, will not again breed exposed in the marshes; they retire among the growing corn, and there in tranquillity make their second hatch: the young ones, less experienced, are not deterred by their loss, and they risk their nest a second, or even a third time in the same place; but these after∣layings never exceed one or two eggs.</P>
<P>The young Lapwings, two or three days after being hatched, run among the grass and follow their parents: these from solicitude often betray the little family, and discover the retreat, as they flutter backwards and forwards over the fowler's head with cries of inquietude, which are aug∣mented as he approaches the spot where the brood had squatted on the first alarm. When pushed to extremity they betake themselves to running, and it is difficult to catch them with∣out the assistance of a dog, for they are as alert as partridges. At this age they are covered with
<PB N="52" REF="62"/>
a blackish down, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aded under with long white hairs; but in Jul they drop this garb, and ac∣quire their beaut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful plumage.</P>
<P>The great ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciation now begins to be re∣newed: all the Lapwings of the same marsh, young or old, assemble; those of the adjacent marshes join them, and in a short time, a body of five or six hundred are collected. They hover in the air, saunter in the meadows, and, after rain, they disperse among the plowed fields.</P>
<P>These birds are reckoned inconstant, and in∣deed they seldom remain above twenty-four hours in the same tract: but this volatility is occasioned by the scantiness of food; if the worms of a certain haunt be consumed in one day, the flock must remove on the following. In the month of October the Lapwings are very fat, and this is the time when they live in greatest abun∣dance; because in this wetseason the worms swarm on the surface; but the cold winds which blow about the end of the month constrain them to retire into the earth, and thus oblige the Lap∣wings to pass into another climate. This is the general cause of migration in the vermivorous birds. On the approach of winter, they advance towards the south, where the rains are only be∣gun, and, for a like reason, they return in the spring; the excessive heat and dryness of the summer in those latitudes having the same effect as great cold in confining the worms in
<PB N="53" REF="63"/>
the ground <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Baillon, to whom we are indebted for the best details in this history of the Lapwing, confirms our idea with respect to the cause of the return of the Lapwing from south to north, by an observation which he made himself in the Antilles. <Q>"The ground," says he, “is, during six months of the year, extremely hard and parched in the Antilles; not a single drop of rain falls in the whole of that time; I have seen cracks in the valleys four inches broad, and seve∣ral feet deep; no worm can then live at the surface; accordingly, in the dry season, no vermivorous bird is observed in these instands; but on the first days after the rains set in, they arrive in swarms, and come, I suppose, from the low deluged lands on the eastern shores of Florida, from the Bahamas, and a multitude of other islands, lying north or north-west from the Antilles: all these wet places are the cradle of the water-fowl of these islands, and per∣haps of a part of the great continent of America.”</Q></NOTE>. And that the time of migration is the same throughout the whole of our hemi∣sphere, is evinced by this circumstance, that at Kamtschatka October is denominated <HI>the month of Lapwings</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pikis koatch; pikis</HI> is the name of the bird. <HI>Gmelin.</HI></NOTE>; which, as in our latitudes, is the time of their departure.</P>
<P>Belon says, that the Lapwing is <HI>known over the whole earth;</HI> and the species is indeed widely dis∣persed. We have just mentioned their being found in the eastern extremity of Asia; they are met with also in the interior parts of that vast region <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">"The Lapwings are very numerous in Persia." <HI>Lettres Edi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣antes, trentieme Recucil,</HI> p. 317.</NOTE>, and they are seen in the whole of Eu∣rope.

<PB N="54" REF="64"/>
are spread in a meadow, and a few stakes and one or two live Lapwings set in the middle space to entice the birds; or the fowler, concealed in his lodge, imitates their cry with a call made of fine bark; and the whole flock, thus betrayed, alight and are ensnared. Olina mentions the course of November as the time of the greatest captures; and from his account it appears, that in Italy the Lapwings remain congregated the whole winter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Hebert assures us, that a few remain in Brie till the depth of winter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The flesh of the Lapwing is held in consider∣able estimation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is much valued in some of the provinces: in Lorraine there is an old proverb, <HI>Qui n'a pas mangé de Vanneau, ne sait pas ce que gibier vaut</HI> (He that has not eaten Lapwing, knows not what game is worth).</NOTE>; yet those who have drawn the nice line of pious abstinence have, by way of favour, admitted it into the diet of mortification. This bird has a very muscular stomach, lined with an inadhesive membrane, covered by the liver, and containing, as usual, a few small peb∣bles; the intestinal tube is about two feet long: it has two <HI>caeca</HI> directed forwards, each more than two inches long; a gall-bladder adhering to the liver and the <HI>duodenum:</HI> the liver is large, and divided into two lobes <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>; the <HI>oesophagus</HI> about six inches long, dilated into a bag before its insertion; the palate is rough with small fleshy points, which lie backwards; the tongue
<PB N="55" REF="65"/>
is narrow, rounded at the tip, and ten lines in length. Willughby observes, that the ears are placed higher in the Lapwing than in other birds.</P>
<P>There is no distinction, in point of size, be∣tween the male and the female, but, in the colours of the plumage, some differences occur, though Aldrovandus says, that he did not per∣ceive any. The tints of the female are in ge∣neral more dilute, and the black parts mixed with gray: its crest is also smaller than that of the male, whose head seems to be rather larger and rounder. In both the feathers are thick and well clothed with down, which is black near the body: the under side and the verge of the wings, near the shoulders, are white, and also the belly, the two outer feathers of the tail, and the first half of the rest: there is a white point on each side of the bill, and a streak of the same colour on the eye: all the rest of the plumage is of a black ground, but enriched by fine re∣flections of a metallic lustre, changing into green and gold-red, particularly on the head and the wings: the black on the throat and the fore∣part of the neck is spotted with white, but on the breast it forms alone a broad round space, and, like the black of the wings, it is glossed with bronze green: the coverts of the tail are rufous:—but as the plumage frequently varies somewhat in different individuals, it will be un∣necessary to be more particular in the descrip∣tion;

I shall only observe, that the tuft is not inserted in the front, but in the back of the head, which is more graceful; it consists of five or six delicate threads, of a jet black, the two upper ones cover the rest, and are much longer. The bill is black, pretty short and small, not ex∣ceeding twelve or thirteen lines, inflated near the point: the feet are tall and slender, and of a brown red, as well as the lower part of the legs, which is naked for the space of seven or eight lines, the outer and middle toes are joined at their origin by a small membrane; the hind one is very short, and does not reach the ground: the tail does not extend beyond the wings when they are closed: the total length of the bird is ele∣ven or twelve inches, and its bulk is nearly that of a common pigeon.</P>

<P>THIS bird is by Belon termed the <HI>gray-plo∣ver;</HI> and in fact it resembles the plover as much as the lapwing, perhaps more: it has in∣deed, like the latter, the small hind toe, which is wanting in the plover, a difference which has induced naturalists to separate these birds. But it must be observed that this toe is smaller than that of the lapwing, and hardly apparent; and that also it has scarce any of the colours of the lapwing. It might be regarded as a lapwing because it has a fourth toe; or as a plover, be∣cause it has no tuft, and since its habits and its garb are those of the plovers.</P>
<P>Klein will not even admit that this small dif∣ference in the toes is a general character, but justly regards it as an anomaly; and he insists
<PB N="68" REF="78"/>
that the lapwings and plovers have so many common characters as to constitute only one great family. Accordingly, some naturalists have termed it a lapwing, others a plover: and, to compromise the matter, and retain the ana∣logies, we have denominated it the <HI>Lapwing-Plover.</HI> Fowlers call it the <HI>sea-plover,</HI> which is an improper appellation, since it con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts with the common plovers; and Belon takes it to be the leader of their flocks, because it has a louder and stronger voice than the rest. It is some∣what larger than the golden plover; its bill is proportionally longer and stouter: all its plu∣mage is light ash-gray, and almost white under the body, mixed with brownish spots on the upper side of the body and on the sides; the quills of the wing are blackish; the tail is short, and does not project beyond the wing.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus conjectures, with a good deal of probability, that this bird is mentioned by Aris∣totle under the name of <HI>pardalis.</HI> But we must observe that the philosopher does not seem to speak of it as a bird with which he was himself acquainted; for the following are his expres∣sions: <Q>“The <HI>pardalis</HI> is said to be in a great measure a gregarious bird, and never found alone; its plumage is entirely cinereous; it is, in point of size, next the <HI>molliceps;</HI> its pi∣nions and feet are vigorous; its voice not deep, but frequent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Animal, <HI>lib.</HI> ix. 23.</NOTE>.”</Q> Add to this, that the
<PB N="69" REF="79"/>
name <HI>pardalis</HI> signifies a mottled plumage. All the other properties belong equaily to the family of the plovers or of the lapwing.</P>
<P>Willughby assures us, that this bird is seen frequently in the territories of the Venetian state, where it is called <HI>squatarola.</HI> Marsigli reckons it an inhabitant of the banks of the Danube. Schwenckfeld inserts it in the num∣ber of Silesian birds; Rzacynski, in those of Poland; and Sibbald, in those of Scotland. Hence this species, like all the lapwings, is ex∣tremely diffused. Does Linnaeus allude to any peculiarity of its history, when in one of his editions he denominates it <HI>tringa augusti mensis</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Syst. Nat.</HI> ed. 10. Gen. 60.

And does it really appear in Sweden in the month of August?—The hind toe of this bird is so small, and so little apparent, that with Brisson we shall not hesitate to refer to it the <HI>brown lapwing</HI> of Schwenckfeld, though he says expressly that it wants the hind toe.</P>
<P>To this species also we shall refer, as being closely related, the <HI>variegated lapwing</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Tringa-Squatarola, <HI>var.Gmel.</HI></P>

<PB N="70" REF="80"/>
in a few tints, it being more spotted in this variegated Lapwing. Both of them, according to Brisson, haunt the sea-shore; but it is cer∣tain, from the authorities which we have cited, that these birds occur also at a distance from the coast and in inland countries. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Gray Sandpiper: <Q>“Its bill is black, its feet greenish; its body gray, and white below.”</Q> In England these birds are seen during winter in small and unfrequent flocks.

<HEAD>The PLOVERS. LES PLUVIERS. <HI>Buff.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE social instinct is not bestowed on all the species of birds; but, in those which it cements, the union is firmer and more unshaken than in other animals; not only their flocks are more numerous and more constantly embo∣died: the whole community seems to have but one will; and the same appetites, projects, and pleasures actuate each individual. Birds are more prolific than the quadrupeds, they live in greater plenty, and their motions are performed with greater ease and celerity. The compact∣ness of their squadrons, and the power of their voice, enable them to transfuse their sentiments and intentions, and to act by mutual concert. And the sagacity exercised in interpreting their signals begets among them affection, trust, and the gentle habits of peace and concord. The societies of quadrupeds, whether formed volun∣tarily in the wilds of nature, or contracted and upheld by the influence of man, cannot be com∣pared with the congregations of the birds. Pi∣geons grow fond of their common dwelling;
<PB N="72" REF="82"/>
and their attachment is the stronger the more numerous their flock: quails assemble, and con∣cert their migration: the gallinaceous tribes possess, even in the savage state, those social ha∣bits which domestication only nourishes and un∣folds: lastly, all the birds which scatter in the woods or disperse in the fields, gather together in the autumn; and after chearing the bright days of that late season with gay sport, they depart embodied, in quest of milder winters and happier climates. All these combinations and movements of the feathered race are conducted independently of the guidance or controul of man, though performed under his eye. But his in∣terference in the associations of quadrupeds dis∣unites and disperses them. The marmot, form∣ed by nature for society, now lives solitary and exiled on the summits of mountains; the bea∣ver, disposed still more to friendship, and almost civilized, has been driven into the deepest wilds. Man has destroyed or prevented all union among animals: that of the horse has been extinguished, and the whole species sub∣jected to the rein <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The horses which have grown wild on the plains of Buenos-Ayres go in large flocks, run together, feed together, and give all the marks of mutual attachment and intelligence, and of delight∣ing in society. The same is the case with the wild dogs in Ca∣nada and other parts of North America. We can scarce doubt but that the other domestic species, that of the camel, so long re∣duced to subjection; that of the ox and of the sheep, which man has disunited by degrading them with servitude; were also natu∣rally social, and displayed in the wild state, ennobled by freedom, those tender tokens of regard and affection with which we behold them mutually soothe their slavery.</NOTE>: even the elephant has been
<PB N="73" REF="83"/>
reduced to constraint, notwithstanding his vast strength, and his constant sterility in the domes∣tic state. The birds alone have escaped the do∣mination of the tyrant; and their society is as free as the element which they inhabit. His attacks can destroy only the life of the indivi∣dual; the species may suffer a diminution of its numbers, but its instincts, habits, and oeconomy remain untouched. There are many species even which are known to us only from their social propensity, and are never seen but at the time of their general muster, when vast multi∣tudes are assembled. Such in general are the companies of many water-fowls, and in particu∣lar that of the Plovers.</P>
<P>They appear in numerous bodies in the pro∣vinces of France during the autumnal rains, and from this circumstance they derive their name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From <HI>pluvia,</HI> rain. Gesner supposes it to come from <HI>pulvis,</HI> dust; which is much less probable, there being many other birds besides Plovers that welter in dust.</NOTE>. They frequent, like the lapwings, the wet bottoms and slimy grounds, where they search for worms and insects: they go into the water in the morning to wash their bill and feet, which are clotted with mud by their employ∣ment; a habit which is common also to the woodcocks, the lapwings, the curlews, and many
<PB N="74" REF="84"/>
other birds which feed on worms. They strike the ground with their feet to elicit these, and often they extract them from their retreat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. Baillon, of Montreuil-sur-mer.</NOTE>. Though the Plovers are usually very fat, their intestines are found to be so empty, that it has been supposed that they could live on air; but it is probable that the soft substance of the worms turns wholly into nourishment, and leaves little excrement. They seem however capable of supporting a long abstinence: Schwenckfeld says, that he kept one fourteen days, which during the whole time only drank some water, and swallowed a few grains of sand.</P>
<P>Seldom do the Plovers remain more than twenty-four hours in the same place: as they are very numerous, they quickly consume the provisions which it affords, and are then obliged to remove to another pasture. The first snows compel them to leave our climates, and seek milder regions: however, a considerable num∣ber of them remain in our maritime provinces <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Picardy, according to M. Baillon, many of these birds continue in the neighbourhood of Montreuil-sur-mer, till the in∣tense frosts set in.</NOTE> till the hard frosts.

<PB N="75" REF="85"/>
seen, says Longolius. And, according to Be∣lon, their smallest companies amount at least to fifty. When on the ground they never rest, but are incessantly engaged in the search of food; they are almost perpetually in motion: several keep watch while the rest of the flock are feed∣ing, and on the least symptom of danger they utter a shrill scream, which is the signal of flight. On wing, they follow the wind, and maintain a pretty singular arrangement; and thus advancing in front, they form in the air transverse zones, very narrow and exceedingly long: sometimes there are several of these zones parallel, of small depth, but wide extended in cross lines.</P>
<P>When on the ground these birds run much, and very swiftly; they continue in a flock the whole day, and only separate to pass the night: they disperse in the evening to a certain haunt, where each reposes apart; but at day-break, the one first awake or the most watchful, which fowlers term the <HI>caller,</HI> though perhaps it is the sentinel, sounds the cry <HI>hui, hieu, huit,</HI> and in an instant they obey the summons and collect to∣gether. This is the time chosen for catching them: a clap-net is stretched before dawn fac∣ing the place where they sleep; a number of fowlers encircle it, and as soon as the call is heard, they throw themselves flat on the ground till the birds gather; then they rise up, shout, and throw their sticks into the air; so that the
<PB N="76" REF="86"/>
Plovers are frightened, and hurrying away with a low flight they strike against the net, which drops upon them, and often the whole flock is taken. This plan is always attended with great success; but a single bird-catcher can in a simpler way ensnare considerable numbers: he conceals himself behind his net, and attracts the birds by means of a call of bark. They are caught in abundance in the plains of Beauce and of Champagne. Though very common in Italy, they are esteemed excellent game: Belon says, that in his time a Plover was sold often as dea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a hare; he adds, that they preferred the young ones, which he calls <HI>guillemots.</HI></P>
<P>The chase of the Plovers, and their mode of living in that season, are almost the whole we know of their natural history. Transient guests rather than inhabitants of our fields, they disap∣pear on the snow's falling; repass without halt∣ing in the spring, and leave us when the other birds arrive. It would seem, that the gentle warmth of that season, which awakens the dor∣mant faculties of the other birds, makes a con∣trary impression on the Plovers: they proceed to the more northern countries to breed, and rear their young, for during the whole summer we never see them. Then they inhabit Lapland, and other parts of the north of Europe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Collection Academique, <HI>partie <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rangere,</HI> tome xi. <HI>Aca∣demie de Stockholm,</HI> p. 60.</NOTE>, and
<PB N="77" REF="87"/>
probably those of Asia. Their progress is the same in America; since they are common to both continents, and are observed in the spring at Hudson's Bay advancing farther north <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voy. <HI>tom.</HI> xv. <HI>p.</HI> 267.</NOTE>. After arriving in flocks in those arctic tracts, they separate into pairs; and the more intimate union of love breaks, or rather suspends for a time, the general society of friendship. Hence Klein, an inhabitant of Dantzick, remarks, that the Plovers live solitary in low grounds and meadows.</P>
<P>The species which in our climates appears as numerous at least as that of the lapwing, is less diffused. According to Aldrovandus, fewer Plovers are caught in Italy than lapwings, and they are not found in Switzerland and other countries, where the lapwings are frequent. But perhaps the Plover, advancing farther to the north than the lapwing, gains as much terri∣tory as it relinquishes in the south. It seems also to have occupied a spacious tract in the new world, which has afforded an ample range to many species of birds, because there the temperature is more uniform throughout, and the climates more obscurely discriminated.</P>
<P>The Golden Plover may be regarded as the representative of the whole family of Plovers; and what we have said of their habits and oeco∣nomy refer to it: but species are included, which we proceed to enumerate and describe.</P>

Albin represents it too small in his figure, since in his description he assigns greater weight and measures than to the common Dot∣terel: indeed the chief difference consists in this, that it wants the cross bar below the breast, and that the whole of that part, with the sto∣mach and the fore side of the neck, are light∣gray washed with yellowish. It appears to me therefore unnecessary to multiply species on such slight foundations. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Dotterel, <HI>Charadrius-Morinellus:</HI> <Q>“Its breast ferruginous; a white linear bar on its eye-brows and breast; its feet black."

<P>IT is scarce equal to the little ringed plover, but its neck is longer and its bill stronger: the upper side of the head, of the neck, and of the back, is black; and there is a streak of the same colour on the eyes, and some black waves on the breast: the great quills of the wing are mixed with black and white: the other parts of the wing, the middle quills and coverts, are of an handsome gray; the fore side of the neck is rusty white, and the belly white; it has three toes, like the plover, but the bill is larger and thicker, and the inflation is more perceptible. These differences seem to constitute a shade in the genus, and I have therefore given it a dis∣tinct name.</P>

<P>THERE are few persons who reside in the provinces of Picardy, Orleanois, Beauce, Champagne, and Burgundy, but must have heard in the fields, in the evening, during the months of September, October, and November, the repeated cries <HI>tūrrlui, tūrrlui,</HI> of these birds: this is their call, which often re-echoes from hill to hill; and as it resembles the arti∣culated sound of the curlew, it has probably given occasion to the appellation of land cur∣lew <HI>(courlis de terre.)</HI> Belon says, that at first sight it appears so like the little bustard, that he gave it the same name. But it is neither a cur∣lew nor a bustard: it is rather a plover, though
<PB REF="115"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE THICK KNEED BUSTARD.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="103" REF="116"/>
it has several peculiar features and habits, that disjoin it from the other species.</P>
<P>This bird is much larger than the golden plover, and even exceeds the woodcock: its thick legs have a remarkable swelling below the knee; for which reason Belon has applied the epithet <HI>oedicnemus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Formed from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to swell, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the upper part of the leg or knee.</NOTE>. Like the plover it has only three toes, which are very short: its legs and feet are yellow; its bill yellowish from the origin to the middle, and from thence blackish to the extremity; and is of the same shape with that of the plover, only thicker: all the plumage is of a light gray and rusty-gray ground, and speckled with dashes of brown and blackish, the strokes very distinct on the neck and breast, and more confused on the back and the wings, which are crossed with a whitish bar: two streaks of rusty white pass above and below the eye: the ground is rusty colour on the back and neck, and white under the belly, which is not speckled.</P>
<P>This bird has great power of wing; it springs at a distance, especially in the day-time, and flies pretty near the ground: it runs on the sward and in the fields, as swiftly as a dog; and hence, in some provinces, it has been termed <HI>the surveyor</HI> (arpenteur.) After running, it stops short, holding its body and head still <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Albin.</NOTE>; and on
<PB N="104" REF="117"/>
the least noise it squats on the ground. Flies, beetles, small snails, &amp;c. are its chief food, toge∣ther with some other insects that are found in fallow grounds, such as crickets, grasshoppers, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Baillon, who has observed this bird on the coasts of Picardy, informs us, that it also eats little black lizards, which it finds on the downs, and even small adders.</NOTE>: for it constantly inhabits the brows of banks, and prefers the stony, sandy, and dry spots. In Beauce, Salerne tells us, bad land is called <HI>curlew-land.</HI> These birds, solitary and tranquil during the day, begin to stir on the ap∣proach of the evening; then they spread on all sides, flying rapidly, and crying on the heights with all their might: their voice, which is heard at a great distance, resembles the sound of a third flute, dwelling on three or four tones, from a flat to a sharp. This is the time that they approach our dwellings <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sloane.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These nocturnal habits seem to shew, that this bird sees better in the night than in the day; yet is its sight very acute in the day-time: the position too of its large eyes enables it to see as well before as behind: it descries the sportsman at a good distance, so that it can rise and escape before he gets within shot of it. It is as wild as it is timorous; fear alone confines it during the day, and permits it not to come abroad or utter its cries till night: and so invin∣cible is its timidity, that if a person enter the
<PB N="105" REF="118"/>
room where it is kept, it endeavours to conceal itself, or sneak off, and runs against whatever happens to be in its way. It is said, that this bird foresees the changes of the weather, and an∣nounces rain: Gesner remarks, that even when confined, it is much disturbed before a storm.</P>
<P>This Great Plover, or Stone Curlew, forms an exception to the numerous species, which having a part of their leg naked, are reckoned inhabi∣tants of shores and boggy grounds; since it keeps ever at a distance from water or marshes, and resides in dry upland situations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may hence see with what little reason Gesner took it for the <HI>charadrios</HI> of Aristotle, which is decidedly a shore bird. See the article of the <HI>Ring-Plover.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>These are not the only habits in which they differ from the plovers. The seasons of their migrations are not the same; for they retire in November, during the latter rains of autumn, having, previous to their departure, which com∣mences at night <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>, collected at the call of their leader, in flocks of three or four hundred; and they return early in the spring, being seen in the end of March in Beauce, Sologne, Berry, and some other provinces of France. The female lays only two, or sometimes three eggs, on the naked ground, between stones <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>, or in a small hole which she forms in the sand of heaths or
<PB N="106" REF="119"/>
downs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During the eight days which I wandered on the dry sands that cover the sea-shore from the mouth of the Somme to the extremity of the Boulonnois, I met with a nest which appeared to be that of the <HI>saint-germer</HI> (stone-curlew). To ascertain this, I remained sit∣ting on the sand till evening, having raised a little hillock in front to conceal myself. The birds which inhabit those sands being ac∣customed to see the surface perpetually changed by the wind, are not in the least disturbed at finding new cavities or elevations. My trouble was recompensed: in the evening the bird came to her eggs, and I recognized it to be the <HI>saint-germer,</HI> or stone-curlew: her nest placed exposed on a flat in a sand-plain, consisted only of a little hole of an inch, and of an eliptical shape, containing three eggs, pretty large, and of a singular colour. <HI>Observation made by M. Baillon, of Montreuil-sur-mer.</HI></NOTE>. The male pursues her eagerly in the love season; he is as constant as he is ardent, and never deserts her: he assists in leading the young, and instructing them to distinguish their food. The education is tedious; for though the brood can soon walk after they are hatched, it is a considerable time before they have strength sufficient to fly. Belon found some that could not use their wings in the end of October; which induced him to suppose that the eggs are laid at a late season. But the Chevalier Desmazy, who observed these birds at Malta <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Malta it is called <HI>tolaride.</HI></NOTE>, informs us, that they have regularly two hatches, one in the spring, and another in the end of August. He also assures us, that the incubation lasts thirty days. The young ones are excellent game, and the adults likewise are eaten, though their flesh is blacker and dryer. The chase of
<PB N="107" REF="120"/>
the stone curlews was reserved in Malta for the master, before the introduction of our partridges, about the middle of last century <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the time of the grand master, Martin de Redin.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These birds do not, like the plovers, advance into the north in summer; at least Linnaeus has not inserted them in his <HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI> Wil∣lugh by assures us, that in England they are found in Norfolk and in Cornwall; yet Charleton, who gives himself out for an experienced sportsman, confesses that he never met with any. Indeed, the wild disposition of the stone curlew, and its retirement during the day, might long conceal it from the eyes of observers; and Belon, who first discovered it in France, remarks that no person could then tell him its name.</P>
<P>I had one of these birds a month or five weeks at my house in the country. It fed on soup, bread, and raw flesh, and preferred the last. It a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not only in the day-time, but also at night; for its provision, when given in the evening, was observed to be diminished next morning.</P>
<P>This bird seemed to me of a peaceful temper, but timorous and wild; and I am induced to think that this is really the case, as it is seldom seen in the day, and prefers the obscurity of night for its associations. I observed, that as soon as it perceived a person, even at a distance, it endeavoured to escape, and was so overcome with fear, as to hurt itself in the flurry. It is, therefore, one of those birds which nature has
<PB N="108" REF="121"/>
destined to live remote from us, and has endued with the instinct for that purpose.</P>
<P>The one which I mention uttered no cry; it only made, two or three nights before its death, a sort of feeble whistle, which was perhaps an expression of pain, for the root of its bill and its feet were much gashed, owing to its violent struggling in the cage, at the sight of any new object. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Thick-knee'd Bustard, <HI>Charadrius Oedicnemus:</HI> <Q>“It is gray; its two primary wing-quills black, and in the middle white; its bill sharp; its feet cinereous.”</Q>These birds are very frequent in Norfolk; they breed in rabbit burrows; their eggs are olive, with reddish spots.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE Long-Shank is among the birds what the jerboa is among the quadrupeds: its legs, which are thrice as long as the body, pre∣sent a monstrous disproportion. Such extrava∣gant and random productions of nature exhibit the traces of her magnificent and boundless plan; and, like shades in a picture, they heighten by their contrast the beauty of the scene. The enormous length of this bird's legs will hardly allow it to reach the earth with its bill to gather
<PB N="110" REF="124"/>
its food; they are also slender, weak, and totter∣ing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus, <HI>tom.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 444.</NOTE>; and its three toes are disproportionally small, and give a base too narrow for its tall body. Hence the names of this bird in the an∣cient and modern languages refer to the softness and pliancy of its legs, and to their extreme length.</P>
<P>The slow laborious pace of this bird <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Incessus, nisi aequali alarum expansione librata sit, difficilis vide∣tur in tantâ crurum &amp; pedum longitudine &amp; exilitate.</HI> Sibbald.</NOTE> seems however to be compensated by its power of fly∣ing. Its wings are long, and extend beyond its tail, which is pretty short; their colour, as well as that of the back, is glossed with greenish blue; the back of the head is brown-gray: the upper side of the neck is mixed with blackish and white: all the under surface is white from the throat to the end of the tail: the feet are red, and eight inches high, including the naked part, which is three inches: the protuberance of the knee is strongly marked on its smooth, slender legs: the bill is black, cylindrical, a little flat at the sides near the point, two inches and ten lines long, close inserted on an elevated front, which gives the head a round shape.</P>
<P>We are little acquainted with the habits of this bird, whose species is scanty and rare <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">We received a Long-Shank from Beauvoir, in Lower Poitou, as an unknown bird; which proves that it seldom appears on those coasts: this was killed in an old salt-pit; it was remarked in fly∣ing to stretch its legs backwards eight inches beyond the tail.</NOTE>. It
<PB N="111" REF="125"/>
probably lives on insects and worms, at the verge of streams and marshes. <Q>Pliny mentions it under the name <HI>himantopus,</HI> and says, “that it is a native of Egypt, and subsists chiefly on flies, and has never been kept more than a few days alive in Italy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. x. 46. Oppian likewise calls it <HI>himantopus. (Exeuti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. lib.</HI> ii.)</NOTE>.”</Q>Yet Belon speaks of it as an inhabitant of France; and the Count Marsigli saw it on the Danube. It appears also to frequent the northern countries; for though Klein says that he never saw it on the coasts of the Baltic, Sibbald did in Scotland, and has ac∣curately described one that was killed near Dumfries <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Scotia Illustrata,</HI> par. II. lib. iii. p. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Long-Shank occurs also in the new continent. Fernandez saw a species or rather a variety in New Spain; and he says that this bird, an inhabitant of cold countries, does not descend till winter to Mexico; yet Sloane ranks it among the Jamaica birds. It follows from these apparently contradictory authorities, that the species of the Long-Shank, which contains exceedingly few individuals, is diffused or rather dispersed, like that of the ring plover, in very remote countries.—The Mexican Long-Shank, indicated by Fernandez, is rather larger than that of Europe; it has a mixture of white in the black of its wings: but these differences

<P>THOSE birds which disperse in our fields or retire under the shade of our forests, inha∣bit the most enchanting scenes, and the most peaceful retreats of nature. But such is not the lot of all the feathered race: some are confined to the solitary shores; to the naked beach, where the billows dispute the possession of the land; to the rocks, on which the surges dash and roar; and to the insulated shelving banks which are beaten by the murmuring waves. In these de∣sert stations, so formidable to every other being,
<PB N="114" REF="129"/>
a few birds, such as the Oyster-catcher, obtain subsistance and security, and even enjoy pleasure and love. It lives on sea-worms, oysters, lim∣pets, and other bivalves, which it gathers on the sand of the sea-shore: it keeps constantly on the banks, which are left dry at low water, or on the little channels, where it follows the refluent tide; and never retires farther than the sandy hillocks which limit the beach. This bird has also been called the <HI>sea-pie,</HI> not only on account of its plumage, which is black and white, but because it makes a continual noise or cry, espe∣cially when it is in flocks: this cry is shrill and abrupt, repeated incessantly whether at rest or on the wing.</P>
<P>This bird is seldom seen on most of the French coasts; yet it is known in Saintonge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, and in Picardy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. Baillon, of Montreuil-sur-mer.</NOTE>. In the latter province it sometimes breeds, and arrives in very consider∣able flocks when the wind is at east or north-west. They repose on the sand of the beach, waiting for a fair wind to waft them to their usual abode. They are believed to come from Great Britain, where they are indeed very com∣mon, particularly on the eastern coasts of that island <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. They also advance farther north; for they are found in Gothland, in the isle of Oë∣land <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 161.</NOTE>,
<PB N="115" REF="130"/>
and in the Danish islands, as far as Nor∣way <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brunnich, <HI>Ornithol. Borealis,</HI> No 189.</NOTE> and Iceland. On the other hand, Cap∣tain Cook saw them on the coasts of <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> and near the Straits of Magellan <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>“Sea-pies or black Oyster-catchers inhabit, with many other birds, the verge of these coasts, surrounded by immense floating beds of samphire on the east point of <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> and of the Strait.”</Q>—<HI>Cook's second Voyage.</HI></NOTE>. They have been discovered at Dusky Bay in New Zea∣land: Dampier remarked them on the shores of New Holland; and Kaempfer assures us, that they are as common in Japan as in Europe. Thus the Oyster-catcher inhabits all the shores of the ancient continent; and we need not be surprized to find it in the new. Father Feuillée observed it on the east of <HI>Terra Firma:</HI> Wafer at Darien: Catesby at Carolina and the Bahama Islands: Page du Pratz at Louisiana <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The hatchet-bill is so called, because its bill is red, and fa∣shioned like the head of an hatchet: its feet are also of a very fine red, for which reason it is often named <HI>red-foot.</HI> As it lives wholly on shell-fish, it frequents the sea-side, and is never seen on the land, except before some great tempest, which its retreat announces.”</Q> Le Page du Pratz. <HI>Histoire de la Louisiane, tom.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 117.</NOTE>. And this species, so diffused, has no variety, but every where the same, and disjoined from all others. None indeed of the shore birds has, with the sta∣ture of the Oyster-catcher, and its short legs, the same form of bill, or the same habits and oeconomy.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="131"/>
This bird is as large as the crow; its bill four inches long, contracted, and, as it were, com∣pressed vertically above the nostrils, and flatten∣ed at the sides like a wedge as far as the tip, whose square section forms a cutting edge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Page du Pratz, <HI>ut supra.</HI></NOTE>: a structure peculiar to itself, and which enables its bill to raise up and detach the oysters, limpets and other shell-fish from their beds and ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks.</P>
<P>The Oyster-catcher is one of those few birds which have only three toes. This single cir∣cumstance has led systematic writers to range it next the bustard. Yet it is apparent how wide is the separation in the order of nature; for not only this bird haunts the sea-shores, it even swims, though its feet are almost entirely devoid of membranes. It is true that, according to M. Baillon, who observed the Oyster-catcher on the coasts of Picardy, its method of swimming is merely passive, but it has no aversion to re∣pose on the water, and leaves the sea for the land whenever it chooses.</P>
<P>Its black and white plumage, and its long bill, have given occasion to the inaccurate appella∣tions of <HI>sea-pie</HI> and <HI>sea-woodcock:</HI> the name <HI>Oyster-catcher</HI> is proper, since it expresses its mode of subsisting. Catesby found oysters in its stomach, and Willughby entire limpets. The organ of di∣gestion is spacious and muscular, according to
<PB N="117" REF="132"/>
Belon; who adds, that the flesh of the bird is black and hard, and of a rank taste. Yet M. Baillon avers, that the Oyster-catcher is always fat in the winter, and that the young ones are tolerably pleasant food. He kept one more than two months in his garden, where it lived chiefly on earth-worms like the curlews, but also ate raw flesh and bread, with which it was well content. It drank indifferently either salt or fresh water, without shewing the least preference to either: yet in the state of nature these birds never inhabit the marshes or the mouths of ri∣vers; they remain constantly on or near the beach; probably because fresh waters do not afford the proper subsistence.</P>
<P>The Oyster-catcher makes no nest; its eggs, which are grayish and spotted with black, it lays on the naked sand, out of the reach of the tide, but without any preparation for their reception; it only seems to select a high spot, strewed with fragments of shells. The number of eggs is usually four or five, and the time of incubation is twenty or twenty-one days: the female does not cover them assiduously; she seems, in this respect, to do as most of the birds that inhabit the sea-shores, and to leave the hatch to the sun's heat part of the day, leaving her charge at nine or ten o'clock of the morning, and not returning, unless on occasion of rain, till three in the afternoon. The young, when they have just burst the shell, are covered with a blackish
<PB N="118" REF="133"/>
down. They crawl on the sand the first day; they soon begin to run, and then they conceal themselves so well in the tufts of grass that it is difficult to find them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. Baillon, of Montreuil-sur-mer.&gt;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bill and feet of the Oyster-catcher are of a fine coral red: hence Belon has called it <HI>haematopus</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, blood, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the foot.</NOTE>, taking it for the <HI>himantopus</HI> of Pliny; but these two names ought not to be confounded, or applied to the same bird. The former signifies <HI>red legs,</HI> and might be referred to the Oyster-catcher; but it is not found in Pliny, though Dalechamp reads it so: and the latter, expressive of tall, frail, and slender legs, belongs not to the Oyster-catcher, but to the long-shank. A word of Pliny in this passage might have apprized Belon of his mistake; <HI>praecipue ei pabulum muscae</HI> <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> flies are its chief food, <HI>lib.</HI> x. 47.</NOTE>: the himantopus, which feeds on flies, can never be the Oyster-catcher, which lives on shell-fish.</P>
<P>Willughby, in cautioning us not to confound this bird, under the name of <HI>haemantopus,</HI> with the himantopus with long and delicate legs, seems to point out another mistake of Belon's; who, in his description of the Oyster-catcher, attributes to it this delicacy of feet, incompatible, it would seem, with its mode of life, which obliges it to clamber on the edges of rocks. Its feet and
<PB N="119" REF="134"/>
toes are covered with a rough and hard scale. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“The legs are strong and thick... and the feet remarkable by the hard and scaly skin which covers them.... Nature having not only given them a bill fashioned for opening oysters, but hav∣ing also armed their legs and feet with scales against the sharp edges.”</Q>—Catesby, <HI>vol.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 85.</P></NOTE>. It is more than probable, therefore, that here, as in other cases, the confusion of names has begotten that of the objects: the term <HI>himan∣topus</HI> ought to be appropriated to the long∣shank, and <HI>haematopus</HI> ought to be entirely ex∣punged, as vague and undefined.</P>
<P>The outer and middle toes of the Oyster∣catcher are connected as far as the first joint by a portion of a membrane, and all the three are surrounded with a membranous edge. Its eye∣lids are red, as well as its bill, and its iris is gold-yellow; above each eye there is a little white spot: the head, the neck, the shoulders, are black, and also the upper surface of the wings; but this black is deeper in the male than in the female: under the throat there is a white collar; all the under side of the body from the breast is white, and the half of the tail, whose tip is black: a white bar, formed by the great coverts, intersects the dun black of the wing; and these colours have probably sug∣gested the name of <HI>pie,</HI> though it differs from that bird in every other respect, particularly in the length of its tail, which is only four inches, and covered three-fourths by the wing: the

<P>THE two birds represented in N<SUP>os</SUP> 795 and 892 of our <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> are of a new genus, which required a distinct name. They resem∣ble the plover in the feet, which have only three toes, but differ in the shape of the bill, which is curved, whereas that of the plovers is straight and inflated near the end. The first was killed in France, where it had probably strayed, since no other has been seen. It ran with rapidity along the shore, and hence it de∣rived its name. We have since received from the coast of Coromandel a bird entirely similar in form, and different only in its colours; so that it may be regarded as a variety, or at least a kindred species. Both of them have larger legs than the plovers; they are as large, but not so thick; their toes are very short, particularly the two lateral ones. The plumage of the first is gray, washed with rufous brown; on the eye
<PB N="122" REF="137"/>
is a lighter streak, almost white, which stretches backwards, and below it a black streak rising from the outer angle of the eye: the top of the head is rufous; the quills of the wing are black, and each feather of the tail, except the two middle ones, has a black spot, with another white one near the point.</P>
<P>The second, which came from Coromandel, is rather smaller than the first; the fore side of the neck and breast of a fine chesnut-rufous, which loses itself in black on the belly; the quills of the wing are black; the upper surface gray; the lower belly white; the head enve∣loped with rufous nearly as in the first: in both the bill and feet are yellowish white.</P>

<P>WE adopt the name <HI>Turn-stone,</HI> given by Catesby, because it indicates the singular habit which this bird has of turning over the stones at the water's-edge, to discover the worms and insects that lurk under these; whereas all the other shore-birds content themselves with searching in the sand or mud. <Q>"Being at sea," says Catesby, “forty leagues from Florida, in the latitude of 31 degrees, a bird flew on our ship, and was caught. It was very alert in turning the stones that lay beside it: in doing so, it used only its upper mandible, and was able to turn over very nimbly stones of three pounds weight <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carolina, vol. i. p. 72.</NOTE>.”</Q> This action implies singular force and dexterity in a bird which is hardly so large as the dusky sandpiper.
<PB N="124" REF="140"/>
It has a bill of a harder and more horny sub∣stance than the other little shore-birds, and it forms a small family amid that numerous tribe: the bill is thick at the root, and gradually tapers to a point: the upper-part is somewhat com∣pressed, and appears to rise with a slight curve: it is black, and an inch long: the feet have no membranes, are pretty short, and of an orange-colour.</P>
<P>The plumage of the Turn-stone resembles that of the ringed plover, in the white and black which intersect it, but without tracing distinctly a collar, and in the mixture of rufous on the back. This similarity in its colours has proba∣bly misled Brown, Willughby, and Ray, who have given it the appellation <HI>morinellus</HI> (dotterel); though it is of a kind entirely distinct from the plovers, being furnished with a fourth toe and a differently shaped bill.</P>
<P>The species of the Turn-stone is common to both continents. It is known on the west coast of England, where these appear generally in small companies of three or four <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. They are equally known on the coast of Norfolk <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>, and in some of the islands of Gothland <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heligholmen</HI> and <HI>Clasen:</HI> Fauna Suecica, No 154.</NOTE>; and we have reason to believe that it is the same bird which, on the shores of Picardy, is called the <HI>bune.</HI> We received one from the Cape of Good Hope,
<PB N="125" REF="141"/>
which was of the same size, and, except some slight differences, of the same colour with that of Europe. Catesby saw these birds near the coasts of Florida <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“Comparing this bird with the description which Mr. Wil∣lughby gives of the sea-lark (turn-stone), I found it was the same species.”</Q> Catesby.</P></NOTE>; and we cannot divine why Brisson reckons the American Turn-stone differ∣ent from the European. We received one also from Cayenne, which was only somewhat larger; and Edwards mentions another sent from Hud∣son's Bay. Thus this species, though it con∣tains few individuals, has, like many other aqua∣tic birds, spread from north to south in both continents, following the sea-shore, which yields it subsistence.</P>
<P>The gray Turn-stone of Cayenne appears to be a variety of this species, and to which we should refer the two birds represented in the <HI>Planches Enluminées,</HI> under the appellations of <HI>Coulon-chaud de Cayenne,</HI> and <HI>Coulon-chaud gris de Cayenne;</HI> for we can perceive no essential difference. We should even regard them as the females of the first species, of which the male would have stronger colours; but we suspend our judgment, because Willughby assures us that he could dis∣cern no difference between the plumage of the male and female of the Turn-stones which he described. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Turn-stone. <HI>Tringa-Interpres:</HI> <Q>“Its feet are red, its body black, variegated with white and ferrugi∣nous; its breast and belly white.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>THOUGH this bird has received the names of Ouzel, of Stare, of Thrush, or of Wag∣tail, it is a water-fowl, which frequents the lakes and rills on lofty mountains. It resembles the blackbird in size, only somewhat shorter, and in the colour of its plumage, which is almost black; it has also a white space on the breast: but it is taciturn, it walks leisurely with measured steps, and runs beside the springs and brooks, which it never leaves <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfield.</NOTE>; preferring the limpid streams, whose fall is rapid, and whose bed is broken with stones and fragments of rocks. It is found near torrents and cascades,
<PB REF="143"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE WATER OUZEL.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="127" REF="144"/>
and especially in the pebbly channels of clear rivulets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Water-Ouzel has a very wide mouth; its feathers are greasy like the ducks, which enables it the easier to dive under water for aquatic insects: it forms its nest with moss near rivulets, and fa∣shions it like a vault: its eggs are four in number. <HI>Extract of a let∣ter from Dr. Hermann to M. de Montbeillard, dated Strasburg, 22d Sep∣tember</HI> 1774.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Its habits are very singular. Aquatic birds with palmated feet swim or dive; those which inhabit the shores, without wetting their body, wade with their tall legs; but the Water-Ouzel walks quite into the flood, following the declivity of the ground: it is observed to enter by degrees, till the water reaches its neck; and it still advances, holding its head not higher than usual, though completely immersed: it continues to walk under the water, and even descends to the bottom, where it saunters as on the dry bank. We are indebted to M. Hebert for the first account of this extraordinary habit, which I know not to belong to any other bird. I shall here give the observations which he was pleased to communicate to me.</P>
<P><Q>“I lay ambushed on the verge of the lake Nantua, in a hut formed of pine-branches and snow, where I patiently waited till a boat, which was rowing on the lake, should drive some wild-ducks to the water's edge. I ob∣served without being perceived: before me was a small inlet, the bottom of which gently
<PB N="128" REF="145"/>
shelved, and might be about two or three feet deep in the middle. A Water-Ouzel stopped here more than an hour, and I had full leisure to view its manoeuvres. It entered into the water, disappeared, and again emerged on the other side of the inlet, which it thus repeat∣edly forded. It traversed the whole of the bot∣tom, and seemed not to have changed its ele∣ment, and discovered no hesitation or reluc∣tance in the immersion. However, I per∣ceived several times, that as often as it waded deeper than the knee, it displayed its wings, and allowed them to hang to the ground. I remarked, too, that when I could discern it at the bottom of the water, it appeared inveloped with air, which gave it a brilliant surface; like some sorts of beetles, which are always in wa∣ter, inclosed with a bubble of air. Its view in dropping its wings on entering the water, might be to confine this air; it was certainly never without some, and it seemed to quiver. These singular habits of the Water-Ouzel were unknown to all the sportsmen whom I have talked with; and, perhaps, without the accident of the snow-hut, I should have ever been ignorant of them: but I can aver, that the bird came to my very feet, and, that I might observe it, I did not kill it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. Hebert to M. le Comte de Buffon,</NOTE>.”</Q></P>
<P>The history of birds presents few facts more curious than the foregoing. Linnaeus had
<PB N="129" REF="146"/>
rightly said, that the Water-Ouzel descends into the streams, and again emerges with much dexterity; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fauna Suecica.</NOTE>; and Willughby had remarked that, though cloven-footed, this bird dived: but nei∣ther of them seems to have known that it plunged in order to walk on the bottom. We may easily suppose, that for this purpose a peb∣bly channel and clear water are requisite, and that a slimy ground would be altogether impro∣per. Accordingly, this bird is found only in mountainous countries, at sources of rivers, and in the torrents which pour down from the rocks; as in Westmorland and other hilly parts of England <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>: in France, among the mountains of Bugey and Vossges, and in Switzerland <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>. It sits on the stones through which the rills wind their course. It flies very swiftly straight for∣ward, razing the surface of the water, like a kingfisher. When on wing, it utters a fee∣ble cry, especially in the season of spring: it then associates with its female, though at all other times it goes single <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>. The female lays four or five eggs; conceals her nest with great care, and often places it near the paper-mills constructed on brooks.</P>
<P>The season in which Hebert saw the Water-Ouzel, proves that it is not a bird of passage.
<PB N="130" REF="147"/>
It remains all winter in our mountains, and dreads not the rigour of winter even in Sweden, where it seeks the cataracts and whirlpools, which are not affected by the frost <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fauna Su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cica.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The nails of this bird are very strong and curved, and serve to clasp the pebbles, as it walks at the bottom of the water: the feet have the same conformation as those of the land ouzels: like them also, it has the hind toe and nail stronger than those placed before, and those toes are distinctly parted, and without any por∣tion of membrane, as Willughby supposed. The leg is feathered to the knee; the bill is short and slender, both mandibles tapering equally, and arched slightly near the point.</P>
<P>The bill of this bird, the feet and the neck being short, we might conceive it requisite to walk under the water, to catch the small fish and aquatic insects on which it feeds. Its plu∣mage, which is thick and clothed with down, seems impenetrable by water, which enables it to remain without inconvenience in that fluid; its eyes are large, of a fine brown; the eye-lids white, and they must be kept open under water, that the bird may distinguish its prey.</P>
<P>A fine white space covers the neck and breast; the head and the upper side of the neck, as far as the shoulders and the border of the white space, are rusty ash-colour, or chesnut; the
<PB N="131" REF="148"/>
back, the belly, and the wings, which reach not beyond the tail, are of a blackish and slaty cinereous; the tail is very short, and has nothing remarkable. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Water-Ouzel, <HI>Turdus-Cinclus:</HI> <Q>“Its bill and feet are black; its straps white; its tail and rump gray and brown.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>THIS bird has the speckled plumage and the size of the throstle: its feet resemble those of the preceding; its nails are large and hooked, particularly the hind one; but its bill is similar to that of the purre, of the dusky sandpiper, and of other small shore birds, and the lower part of its leg is naked: it is therefore wide of being a thrush. It appears to be a foreign spe∣cies, little related to the European birds: yet Edwards presumes that it is common to both continents, as he received one from the county of Essex, where it had strayed, no other hav∣ing ever been seen there.</P>
<P>The bill is eleven or twelve lines in length: it is flesh-coloured at the base, and brown near the point; the upper mandible is marked on each side by a furrow, which extends from the nos∣trils to the extremity of the bill; the upper sur∣face of the body is sprinkled with blackish spots
<PB N="133" REF="150"/>

<P>IT is probable that in some of the northern countries there are traditionary anecdotes of this bird, since it retains the name of Canute, the Dane, king of England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That monarch is said to have been remarkably fond of the flesh of this bird. <HI>Willughby.</HI></NOTE>. It would much resemble the gray lapwing, were it as large, and its bill otherwise shaped. This is pretty thick at the base, and tapers gradually to the extremity, which is not very pointed, yet not inflated like the bill of the lapwing: all the upper side of the body is cinereous and waved; the white tips of the great coverts trace a line on the wing; blackish crescents on the white-gray ground mark the feathers of the rump: all the under side of the body is white spotted with gray on the th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oat and breast; the lower part of the leg is naked; the tail does not exceed the closed wings. Willughby says, that he saw one of these birds in Lincolnshire, about the begin∣ning of winter, and that they remain there two
<PB N="135" REF="152"/>
or three months, in flocks by the sea-shore, and afterwards disappear: he adds, that he saw another near Liverpool. That which Edwards describes, was found in the London market, in the hard winter of 1740; which makes me think that they never advance to the south of Great Britain, but in the most severe seasons. They must, however, be more common in the northern parts of that island, since Willughby describes a method of fattening them, by feeding them with bread soaked in milk, and speaks of the exquisite flavour thus communicated to their flesh. He subjoins, that, at first sight, a person would not distinguish them from the sandpipers <HI>(tringoe),</HI> but by the white bar on the wing. The bill, he remarks, too, is of a harder substance than usual in other birds, in which its structure resembles that of the woodcock.</P>
<P>An indication given by Linnaeus would shew, that this bird is found in Sweden; yet does a difficulty occur: for, according to Willughby, the feet of the <HI>Knot</HI> are cloven, but Linnaeus re∣presents his <HI>Canutus</HI> as having its outer toe con∣nected by the first joint to that of the middle. If both these observers have been accurate, we must regard the two birds as belonging to dis∣tinct ipecies. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Knot, <HI>Tringa-Canutus:</HI> <Q>“Its bill is smooth, its feet ashy, its primary wing-quills serrated, its outermost tail-quill spotless white.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The RAILS. LE RALES. <HI>Buff.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THESE birds constitute a large family, and their habits are different from those of the other shore-birds, which reside on sands and gravel. The Rails, on the contrary, inha∣bit only the slimy margins of pools and rivers, especially low grounds covered with flags and other large marsh plants. This mode of liv∣ing is habitual and common to all the species of water rails. The land rail frequents mea∣dows, and from the disagreeable cry, or rather rattling in the throat, of this bird, is derived the generic name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Raler,</HI> in French, signifies <HI>to rattle in one's throat.</HI></NOTE>. In all the Rails, the body is slender, and shrunk at the sides; the tail ex∣tremely short; the head small; the bill pretty like that of the gallinaceous kind, though much longer, and not so thick; a portion of the leg above the knee is bare; the three fore toes with∣out membranes, and very long: they do not, like other birds, draw their feet under their belly in flying, but allow them to hang down; their wings are small and very concave, and their flight is short.</P>

<P>IN wet meadows, from the time the grass is grown till it be cut down, there issues from the thickest part of the herbage a raucous voice, or rather a broken, harsh cry, <HI>crĕk, crĕk, crĕk,</HI> much like the noise made by stripping forcibly the teeth of a large comb under the fingers: as we approach the sound retires, and is heard at a
<PB N="138" REF="156"/>
remove of fifty paces. It is the Land Rail that emits this cry, which might be taken for the croaking of a reptile <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Longolius, <HI>apud Gesnerum.</HI></NOTE>. This bird seldom es∣capes by flight, but almost always walks nimbly through the thickest grass, where it leaves a re∣markable track. It begins to be heard about the 10th or 12th of May, at the same time with the quails, which it seems ever to accompany <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They arrive and retire together, according to Longolius.</NOTE>. Hence, as the quails too inhabit meadows, and as the Land Rail is less common, and rather larger, it has been supposed to be their leader <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Animal.</HI> lib. viii. 12.</NOTE>, and therefore called the <HI>king of the quails.</HI> But it differs from these in the characters of its con∣formation, which are common to the other rails, and in general to the marsh birds <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Klein.</NOTE>, as Aristotle has well observed <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Lib. viii. 2.</NOTE>. The chief resemblance which this rail bears to the quail consists in its plumage, which however is browner and more golden; fulvous predominates on the wings; blackish and rusty from the colours of the body; these are disposed on the flanks by transverse lines, and are all paler in the female, which is rather smaller also than the male.</P>
<P>A gratuitous extension of the imaginary ana∣logy between the Land Rail and the quail has likewise impressed the notion of an equal fecun∣dity.
<PB N="139" REF="157"/>
But, from repeated observations, we are assured, that it seldom lays eight or ten eggs, never eighteen or twenty, as supposed: indeed, were we to admit such multiplication, the spe∣cies would be more numerous, considering how well the nest is concealed. This nest is negli∣gently constructed with a little moss or dry grass, and placed usually in some small hollow in the turf: the eggs, larger than those of the quail, are sprinkled with broader reddish spots. The young crakes run as soon as they burst the shell, following their mother, but quit not the meadow till the scythe sweeps away their habi∣tation. The late hatches are plundered by the hands of the mower. All the other broods then shelter themselves in the fields of buck∣wheat, among oats, and in waste grounds over∣spread with broom, where they are found often in summer: a few return again to the meadows about the end of that season.</P>
<P>We may know when a dog lights on the scent of the Land Rail, from his keen search, his number of false tracks, and the obstinacy with which the bird persists in keeping the ground, insomuch that it may be sometimes caught by the hand: it often stops short, and squats down; the dog pushing eagerly forward, overshoots the spot, and loses the trace; the Rail, it is said, pro∣fits by his blunder, and runs back on its path; nor does it spring till driven to the last extre∣mity, and then it rises to a good height before
<PB N="140" REF="158"/>
it stretches onwards. It flies heavily, and never to a great distance. It is usually seen to alight, but in vain should we search for it; before the fowler has reached the spot, the bird has tripped off more than an hundred paces. The fleetness of its feet compensates for the tardiness of its wings: all its little excursions, its windings, and its doublings in the fields and meadows, are performed by running. When about however to retire into other countries, it feels, like the quail, unusual vigour, which fits it for perform∣ing the distant journey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I asked the Tatares how this bird, not being able to fly, could retire in winter: they told me that the Tatares and the Assanians knew well that it could not of itself pass into another country; but that when the cranes retire in autumn, each takes a rail upon its back, and conveys it to a warmer climate.</P>
<P><HI>Gmelin, Voyage en Siberie, tom.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 115.</P></NOTE>. It commences its flight during the night, and aided by a favoura∣ble wind it advances into the south of France, where it attempts the passage of the Mediterra∣nean. Many perish, no doubt, in these migra∣tions, and it is remarked that their numbers are fewer on their return.</P>
<P>The Land Rail is never seen in the south of France but in its passage: it does not breed in Provence <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Memoirs communicated by the Marquis de Pioleue.</NOTE>. Belon says, that it is rare in Can∣dia, though pretty common in Greece and Italy: it is found therefore in that island only in its transits of spring and autumn. The migrations of this bird extend more to the north than to
<PB N="141" REF="159"/>
the south; and, notwithstanding the slowness of its flight, it penetrates into Poland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rzyczyski.</NOTE>, Sweden <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE>, Denmark, and even Norway <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Muller, Brunnich.</NOTE>. It is said to be rare in England <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Turner says, that he never saw or heard it anywhere but in Northumberland: yet Dr. Tancred Robinson avers that it is found also in the northern part of Great Britain; and Sir Robert Sibbald reckons it among the birds of Scotland.</NOTE>, and found only in some par∣ticular districts, though common in Ireland <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Willughby and Ray.</NOTE>.

<P>The Land Rail repairs to the northern coun∣tries as much for the sake of cool situations, as to obtain its proper food; since, though it eats seeds, especially those of broom, trefoil, grom∣well, and fattens in the cage on millet and grain <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>, it prefers insects, slugs, worms; and these, which are necessary for its young, can be found only in shady wet grounds <NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Willughby, Schwenckfeld, L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>maeus.</NOTE>. But when grown up, every sort of aliment suits it: it be∣comes fat, and its flesh exquisite. It is caught, like the quail, by a net, into which it is decoyed by an imitation of its cry, <HI>crĕk, crĕk, crĕk,</HI> by
<PB N="142" REF="160"/>
rubbing hard the blade of a knife on an in∣dented bone <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Longolius.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Most of the names given in different lan∣guages to this bird are evidently formed to imi∣tate this singular cry <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Schryck, Scherck, Korn-Knaerr, Corn-Crek, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Hence Turner, and some other naturalists, have supposed it to be <HI>crex</HI> of the ancients. But that term appears to have been applied by the ancients to other birds. Philus gives the <HI>crex</HI> the epithet of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>sluggish-winged,</HI> which would indeed suit the Land Rail. Aristophanes represents it as mi∣grating from Libya: Aristotle says, that it is <HI>quarrelsome,</HI> which may have been attributed to it from the analogy to the quail; but he adds, that the <HI>crex</HI> seeks to destroy the nests of the black-bird <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. ix. 1.</NOTE>, which cannot apply to the rail, since it never inhabits the woods.

bird, for it stuck to its concealment with the obstinacy of the land rail. It causes the same trouble to the sportsman, raises the same impa∣tience in the dog, which it misleads and dis∣tracts, and protracts as long as possible its spring∣ing. It is nearly as large as the land rail, but its bill is longer, and reddish at the point; its feet are of a dull red: Ray says, that in some species these are yellow, and that this difference may proceed from the sex. The belly and sides are striped across with whitish bars on a blackish ground: the colours are disposed the same as in all the rails: the throat, the breast, the stomach, are of a fine slate-gray: the upper surface is of an olive brown rufous.</P>

<P>THIS is a small water rail, not exceeding a lark in size.

<PB N="148" REF="167"/>
sinks with the water. It lays seven or eight eggs; and the floating young are hatched all black. Their education is speedy; for they run, swim, dive, and soon separate, each to lead a so∣litary, savage life, which prevails even in the season of love: since, except during actual coi∣tion, the male discards his female, pays no ten∣der attentions or caresses, indulges in no frolics or joyous airs, and feels none of those soft de∣lights, the sweet preludes of fruition. Unhappy beings, who never breathe a sigh to the objects of their passion! insipid loves, whose sole end is to procure posterity!</P>
<P>Its habits wild, its instinct stupid, the <HI>Marouette</HI> is unsusceptible of education, nor is even ca∣pable of being tamed. We raised one, how∣ever, which lived a whole summer on crumbs of bread and hemp-seed: when by itself, it kept constantly in a large bowl of water; but if a person entered the closet where it was shut, it ran to conceal itself in a small dark corner, without venting cries or murmurs. In the state of liberty, however, it has a sharp piercing voice, much like the scream of a young bird of prey: and though it has no propensity to society, as soon as one cries, another repeats the sound, which is thus conveyed through all the rest in the district.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marouette,</HI> like all the rails, is so obsti∣nately averse to rise, that the sportsman often seizes it with his hand, or fells it with a stick.
<PB N="149" REF="168"/>
If it finds a bush in its retreat, it climbs upon it, and from the top of its asylum beholds the dogs brushing along in fault: this habit is common to it and to the water rail. It dives, swims, and even swims under water, when hard pushed.</P>
<P>These birds disappear in the depth of winter, but return early in the spring; and even in the month of February they are common in some provinces of France and Italy.

<P>THERE are four different species known by the name of <HI>Tiklin</HI> in the Philippine islands.

Its bill also is longer, even than in proportion; its plumage is gray, or a little rusty on the fore side of the body, and mixed with blackish or brown on the back and the wings; the belly is striped with white and black cross bars, as in most of the other rails. Two species, or at least two varieties of these birds, are found in Cayenne; and they differ widely in size, some being as large as a godwit, and others scarcely equal to the common water rail.</P>

<P>IF we attended only to the shape of the bill and feet, we should reckon this bird a rail; but its tail is much longer, and we have therefore adopted a compound name, expressive of this character, <HI>Caurâle</HI> or <HI>Queue Râle</HI> (tail-rail). Its plumage is rich, though the colours are dark: to form an idea of it, we may compare it to the wings of those fine shining flies, in which black, brown, rufous, fulvous, and light gray, inter∣mingled in zones and zig-zags, compose a soft enchanting mixture. Such particularly is the plumage of the wings and tail; the head is hooded with black, and there are long white lines above and below the eye; the bill is ex∣actly that of the rail, except that it is rather longer; and the head, the neck, and the body are also longer than in the rail; the tail is five inches, and projects two beyond the wings; the foot is thick, twenty-six lines high, and the
<PB N="162" REF="182"/>
naked part of the leg ten: the rudiment of a membrane is broader and more apparent than in the rail. The total length, from the point of the bill, which is twenty-seven lines, to that of the tail, is fifteen inches.</P>
<P>This bird has not hitherto been described, and was but lately discovered. It is found, though rarely, in the interior parts of Guiana, where it inhabits the sides of rivers: it lives solitary, and makes a slow plaintive whistle, which is imitated to decoy it.</P>

<P>NATURE passes by gradations from the shape of the rail to that of the Water Hen, whose body is also compressed at the sides, its bill of a similar form but shorter, and in this respect liker that of the gallinaceous tribe: its head too is bare, and covered with a thick mem∣brane; a character of which vestiges may be found in certain species of rails <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. It flies like∣wise with its feet hanging down: its toes are extended in the same manner as those of the rails, but are furnished their whole length with a membranous edging; and this is the interme∣diate▪ shade between the birds with cloven feet and those with webbed feet.</P>
<P>The habits of the Water Hen correspond to
<PB N="164" REF="185"/>
its conformation: it is oftener in the water than the rail, though it does not swim much, but only crosses from one side to another. It lurks the greatest part of the day among the reeds, or under the roots of alders, willows, and oziers, and leaves not its retreat until evening: it frequents less the marshes and bogs than the rivers and pools. Its nest is placed close to the brink of the water, and constructed with a large heap of broken reeds and rushes interwoven. The mother quits her nest every evening, hav∣ing previously covered the eggs with herbs and rushes. The young run as soon as they are hatched, like those of the rail, and in the same way are led by their dam to the water: and, no doubt, it is for this reason that the parents, con∣sulting future convenience, always build their nest so near the surface. So well is the little fa∣mily conducted and concealed, that it is difficult to rob it during the very short term of its edu∣cation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The Water Hens conceal their young so well; that I have never seen them, though I have fowled much in marshes at all seasons.”</Q> <HI>Note of M.

<P>The Water Hens quit the cold hilly parts in

<P>But though the Water Hen is not migratory, and is every where scarce, it has been planted by nature in most of the known regions, even the remotest. Captain Cook found it in the isle of Norfolk <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Second Voyage, <HI>vol.</HI> ii.</NOTE>, and in New Zealand <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The water or wood hens, though numerous enough here, are so scarce in other parts, that I never saw but one.

It is true that we are not certain whe∣ther all those mentioned by travellers are of the same species with ours.

We may discriminate, however, three species or va∣rieties of Water Hens, which never, we are assur∣ed, contract affinity with each other, though they haunt the same pools. Those found in Europe are distinguished by their size, and the middle ones are the most common: they are about the bulk of a pullet six months old; the length from the bill to the tail is a foot, and from the bill to the nails fourteen or fifteen inches; the bill is yellow at the point, and red at the base; the membranous space on the front is also red, and so is the lower part of the thigh above the knee; the feet are greenish; all the plumage is of a dull iron gray, clouded with white under the body, and greenish brown gray above; a white line borders the wing; the tail,
<PB N="167" REF="188"/>

In the fe∣male, which is rather smaller, the colours are lighter, the white waves on the belly are more distinct, and the throat is white: the space on the forehead is, in young subjects, covered with a down more like hair than feathers. A young Water Hen, which we opened, had in its stomach portions of small fish and aquatic plants mixed with gravel: the gizzard was very thick and muscular, like that of the domestic hen: the bone of the <HI>sternum</HI> appeared to us much smaller that usual in birds; and if this difference was not owing to the age, it would partly confirm the assertion of Belon, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and <HI>ischium</HI> are of a different shape in the Water Hen from the same bones in other birds. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Water Hen, <HI>Fulica Chloropus:</HI> "Its front is fulvous, its bracelets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> the coloured rings above the knees.</NOTE> red, its body blackish."

<P>THE accounts of Greenland mention this bird as a water hen, but it may be some species of diver or grebe. In the male, the back and neck are white; the belly black, and the head verging on violet. In the female, the plumage is yellow, mixed and edged with black, so as to appear gray at a distance. These birds are very numerous in Greenland, especially in winter: they are seen flying in the morning from the bays to the islets, where they subsist on shell-fish; and in the evening they return to their retreats, where they pass the night. They follow the windings of the coast in their flight, and the sinuosities of the straits between the islets. They seldom fly over land, unless the force of the wind, particularly when it blows from the north, confines their excursions. The sportsmen seize this opportunity to fire at them from some promontory; those that are killed are picked up by a canoe, for such as are wounded go to the bottom, and never more appear <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Histoire Generale des Voyages, <HI>tom.</HI> xix. p. 44.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><Q>"THE Jacana of the Brazilians," says Marc∣grave, “must be ranged with the wa∣ter-hens, which it resembles in its instincts, in its habits, in the round shape of its body, in the form of its bill, and in the smallness of its head.”</Q> Yet it appears to us to differ es∣sentially from these birds by singular and even peculiar characters: it has spurs on the shoul∣ders, and shreds of membranes on the fore side of the head; its toes and nails are extremely long; the hind-toe is as long as the fore-toe; all the nails are straight, round, and drawn out like needles; and from this circumstance proba∣bly it received at St. Domingo the appellation of <HI>Surgeon.</HI> The species is common in all the marshes of Brazil; and we are assured that it occurs also in Guiana and St. Domingo. We may presume that it is likewise found in all the
<PB N="178" REF="200"/>
tropical parts of America, both on the conti∣nent and in the islands, as far as New Spain; though Fernandez seems to speak of it only from report, since he makes it come from the north, whereas it is really a native of the south.</P>
<P>We know four or five Jacanas, which are of the same bulk, and differ only in colour. The first species given by Fernandez is the fourth of Marcgrave. The head, the neck, and the fore∣side of the body of this bird, are black tinged with violet; the great quills of the wing are greenish; the rest of the upper surface is fine chesnut, with a purplish or ferruginous cast: each wing is armed with a pointed spur inserted in the shoulder, exactly like the spines of the crisped ray-fish; a membrane, taking its origin at the root of the bill, spreads on the front, and divides into three portions, leaving also a barbel on each side; the bill is straight, inflated some∣what at the point, and of a fine yellow jonquil, like the spurs; the tail is very short, and this character, as well as the form of the bill, the tail, the toes, and the height of the legs, of which the half is covered with feathers, belongs equally to all the species of Jacanas. Marcgrave seems to exaggerate, when he compares their bulk to that of a pigeon; for their body is not larger than the quail, only their legs are much taller; their neck is also longer, and their head
<PB N="179" REF="201"/>
smaller: they are always very lean; yet it is said their flesh is palatable.</P>
<P>The first species of Jacana is pretty common at St. Domingo, whence it was sent us by M. Lefebure Deshayes, under the appellation of <HI>Chevalier mordoré armé</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> The armed ferruginous horseman.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>"These birds," he says, “go commonly in pairs, and when separated by some accident they call each other: they are very wild, and the sportsman cannot approach them but by wiles, covering himself with leaves, or running behind the bushes or the reeds. They are seen regularly in St. Domingo during the rainy months of May and November, or shortly after: yet a few are seen at other times, which would shew that the places of their habitual abode are not very remote. But they are never found except in marshes,” or at the sides of pools and brooks.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The flight of these birds is not lofty, but pretty rapid: in rising they vent a shrill, squeaking cry, which is heard far, and seems to bear some resemblance to that of the white owl. The poultry are alarmed, taking it for the scream of a bird of prey, though the Jacana is very remote from that tribe. Na∣ture we might suppose has armed it for war, yet we know not any foe which it combats.”</Q></P>
<P>This analogy to the armed lapwings, which are quarrelsome and noisy birds, and have a
<PB N="180" REF="202"/>
similar form of bill, seems to have induced some naturalists to class them together <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adanson. See the Supplement of the Encyclopedie, article <HI>Aguapeca.</HI></NOTE>. But they differ in the shape of their body and of their head, and in so far resemble the water-hen, from which, however, they are distinguished by the peculiar conformation of their feet. The Jacanas may therefore be reckoned a separate genus, ap∣propriated to the new continent. Their abode, and their structure, sufficiently shew that they live and feed after the manner of the other shore∣birds. And though Fernandez says that they frequent only the salt basons near sea-mark, it appears from the above quotation that they oc∣cur in the interior parts of the country, on the verge of fresh waters <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Chesnut Jacana, <HI>Parra-Jacana:</HI> "Its hind nails very long, and its feet greenish."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE Brazilians call this bird <HI>Agua-pecaca:</HI> we term it <HI>Jacana-Peca,</HI> to suggest both its genus and its species. <Q>It differs little from the preceding: "Its colours," says Marcgrave, “are more dilute, and its wings browner; each wing is armed with a spur, which serves as a weapon of defence; but its head is not co∣vered with membrane.”</Q> The name <HI>Porphy∣rion,</HI> which Barrere has given to this bird, seems intended to denote its red feet.

summer in the ditches round the town of Cayenne; and in the rainy season they appear even in the open parts of the new town: they lurk among the rushes, and live on fish and water insects.”</Q> It would seem that in Guiana, as well as in Brazil, there are several species or varieties of these birds, which are known under different names. Aublet informs us, that the surgeon-bird is pretty common in Guiana, in the meres, the basons, and the plashes of the savannas; that it sits on the broad leaves of the water-lily; and that the natives give it the appellation of <HI>kinkin,</HI> expres∣sive of its shrill note.</P>

The present is an instance. As this bird seemed to bear some resemblance to the gallinaceous tribe, it got the name of <HI>hen,</HI> but as, at the same time, it differed widely, and excelled by its beauty and port, it received the epithet of <HI>Sultana.</HI> But the term <HI>Porphyrion,</HI> indicating the red or purple tint of its bill and feet, was more just and character∣istic: and should we not rebuild the fine ruins

<PB N="187" REF="210"/>
of learned antiquity, and restore to nature those brilliant images and those faithful portraits from the delicate pencil of the Greeks, ever awake to her beauties and her animation?</P>
<P>Let us therefore give the history of the Por∣phyrion, before we speak of the Sultana Hen. Aristotle, in Athenaeus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deipnos.</HI> 9.</NOTE>, describes the Porphy∣rion to be a bird with long legs and pinnated feet, the plumage blue, the bill purple, and firmly fixed to the front, and its bulk equal to that of a domestic cock. According to the reading of Athenaeus, Aristotle subjoined that it had five toes; which would have been erro∣neous, though some other ancient authors have alledged it. But among the moderns, Isidorus has fallen into a much greater error, which has been copied by Albertus, who says that one of its feet is webbed and calculated for swimming, and that the other is fitted for running like the land birds: which is equally false and absurd, and must mean nothing more than that the Porphyrion is a shore bird, and lives on the confines of the land and water. It appears, in∣deed, to be amphibious; for, in the domestic state, it eats fruits, flesh, and fish: its stomach has the same structure with that of those birds which live equally on animal and on vegetable food <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences, depuis 1666 jusqu'en 1669, <HI>tom.</HI> iii. <HI>partie</HI> 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="211"/>
It is therefore easily reared: it charms by its noble port, its fine shapes, its brilliant plumage, enriched with intermingled tints of purple and beryl: its disposition is mild and peaceable: it consorts with its domestic companions, though of different species, and selects some favourite among them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See in Aelian the story of a Porphyrion which died of grief, after having lost the cock its companion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is also a pulverulent bird, like the cock: yet it employs its feet, like a hand, to carry food to its bill <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pliny, <HI>lib.</HI> x. 46.</NOTE>. This habit seems to result from its proportions, the neck being short, and the legs very tall; so that it is fatiguing to stoop to the ground.—The ancients had made most of these remarks on the Porphyrion, and it is one of the birds which they have described the best.</P>
<P>Both the Greeks and Romans, notwithstand∣ing their voracious luxury, abstained from eating the Porphyrion. They brought it from Lybia <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Alexander the Myndian, in Athenaeus, reckons the Porphyrion in the number of Lybian birds, and relates that it was sacred to the gods in that country. According to Diodorus Siculus, Porphy∣rions were brought from the heart of Syria, with other kinds of birds distinguished by their rich colours.</NOTE>, from Comagene, and from the Balearic islands <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Pliny, <HI>lib.</HI> x. 46 and 49.</NOTE>, to be fed <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, and to be placed in their palaces and temples, where it was left at liberty as a guest <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Aelian, <HI>lib.</HI> iii. 41.</NOTE>,
<PB N="189" REF="212"/>
whose noble aspect, whose gentle disposition, and whose elegant plumage, merited such ho∣nours.</P>
<P>Now if we compare this Porphyrion of the ancients with our Sultana Hen, figured in N° 810, <HI>Planches Enluminées,</HI> it appears that this bird, which was brought to us from Madagascar un∣der the name of <HI>taleve</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>taleva</HI> is a river bird of the bulk of a hen, which has many violet feathers; and its front, its bill, and its feet red. Flacourt speaks of it with admiration. <HI>Hist. Gen. des Voyages,</HI> t. viii. p. 606.—The French navigators call this bird <HI>blue hen.</HI> <Q>“The blue hens of Madagascar have bred on the isle of France.”</Q> <HI>Remarks made in 1773, by the Viscount de Querhoënt.</HI></NOTE>, is exactly the same. The academicians, who have described a similar one, recognized also the Porphyrion in the Sul∣tana Hen. It is about two feet long from the bill to the claws: the toes are extremely long, and completely parted, without the least vestige of membrane: they are disposed as usual, three before and one behind; and Gesner was mis∣taken when he represented them as placed two and two: the neck is very short in proportion to the length of the legs, which are featherless: the feet are very long; the tail is very short; the bill is shaped like a flat cone at the sides, and is pretty short: the last property which charac∣terises this bird is, that its front is bald, like that of the coot's, and covered with a plate, which, extending to the top of the head, spreads into an oval, and seems to be formed by the production of the horny substance of the bill. This is
<PB N="190" REF="213"/>
what Aristotle expresses in Athenaeus, by saying that the Porphyrion has its bill strongly attached to its head. The academicians found two pretty large <HI>caeca,</HI> which expanded into sacs; and the inflation of the lower part of the <HI>aesophagus</HI> seems to supply the place of a craw, which, Pliny says, is wanting in this bird.</P>
<P>This Sultana Hen, described by the Acade∣micians, is the first bird of the kind that has been seen by the moderns. Gesner speaks only from report, and from a drawing of it: Wil∣lughby says, that no naturalist has seen the Por∣phyrion. We owe to the Marquis de Nesle the pleasure of having seen it alive; and we express our most respectful thanks for what we regard as a debt of Natural History, which every day is enriched by his enlightened and generous taste: he has put it in our power to verify in a great measure, on his Sultana Hen, what the an∣cients have said of their Porphyrion. This bird is very gentle and innocent, and at the same time timorous, fugitive, fond of solitude and retirement, concealing itself as much as possi∣ble when it eats. It cries from fear when one approaches, at first with a faint sound, which afterwards grows shriller and louder, and ends with two or three dull and hollow claps: while in a cheerful mood, it vents softer and calmer accents. It seems to prefer fruits and roots, particularly those of the succories, to every other sort of food, though it can also live on seeds. If

offered a fish, it eagerly seizes it, and devours it greedily. Often it repeatedly soaks its provi∣sions in water. How small soever its morsel may be, it constantly clenches it with its long toes, bending the hind one over the rest, and holding its foot half raised; it then eats by crumbs.</P>
<P>Scarce any bird has more beautiful colours; the blue of its plumage is soft and glossy, em∣bellished with brilliant reflections; its long feet, and the plate from the top of its head to the root of its bill, are of a fine red, and a tuft of white feathers under the tail heightens the lustre of its charming garb. Except that it is rather smaller, the female differs not from the male, which exceeds the partridge, but is infe∣rior to a common hen. The Marquis de Nesle brought this pair from Sicily, where, according to the note which he obligingly communicated to us, they are known under the name of <HI>Gallo∣fagiani:</HI> they are found on the lake Lentini, above Catana, and are sold for a moderate price in that city, as well as in Syracuse and the ad∣jacent towns. They appear alive in the public places, and plant themselves beside the sellers of vegetables and fruits to pick up the refuse: and this beautiful bird, which the Romans lodg∣ed in their temples, now experiences the decline of Italy. That fact shows that the Sultana Hens have been naturalized in Sicily from a few pairs of these Porphyrions introduced from
<PB N="192" REF="215"/>
Africa; and in all probability this fine species has been propagated, in like manner, in some other countries; for we see from a passage of Gesner, that this naturalist was convinced that these birds are found in Spain, and even in the south of France.</P>
<P>This bird is one of those which are by nature most disposed to domestication, and to multiply them would be both agreeable and useful. The pair kept in the voleries of the Marquis de Nesle, nestled last spring (1778); both male and female laboured in constructing the nest; they placed it at some height from the ground, on a projection of the wall, with a heap of sticks and straws: the eggs were six in number, white, with a rough shell, exactly round, and about the size of a demi-billiard. The female was not assiduous in covering; and a common hen was substituted, but without success. We may surely expect another hatch to be more prospe∣rous if carefully attended by the mother herself; for this purpose these birds ought to enjoy the calm and retreat which they seek, and especially in the season of love. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the purple Gallinule, <HI>Fulica Porphyrio:</HI> "Its front is red, many bracelets; its body green, below violet."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>BIRDS, WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE SULTANA HEN.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<P>SINCE the primary stock of the Sultana Hen inhabits the southern regions of our conti∣nent, it is not probable that the climates of the north produce the secondary species. We must therefore reject the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth species of Brisson, which he pre∣sumes to have the frontal plate, though Gesner, from whom he borrowed the descriptions, gives no indication of this plate, either in his text or by his figures. The second of these appears to be a rail, and accordingly we have ranged it in that genus: the four others are water hens, as the original author himself says. With regard to the ninth species of Brisson, which he calls the <HI>Sultana Hen of Hudson's Bay,</HI> it ought to be excluded, both on account of the climate, and because Edwards gives it as a coot, remark∣ing at the same time that it is more akin to the rail. Notwithstanding these retrenchments, there still remain three species in the ancient continent, which seem to form the intermediate

<P>THIS bird comes from China: it is fifteen or sixteen inches long. It has none of the rich tints that seem peculiar to this genus of birds, and perhaps the specimen is a female. All the upper side of the body is brown or blackish cinereous; the belly is rufous; the fore side of the body, of the neck, and of the throat, and the circle about the eyes, are white; the frontal plate is small, and the bill varies somewhat from the conical shape which obtains in the true Sul∣tana; it is longer, and resembles more the bill of the water hens.</P>

<PB N="196" REF="219"/>
difficult to determine whether it ought to be referred to the sultanas, the water hens, or even the rails: all that we know of it is a short hint given by Petiver in his addition to Ray's Sy∣nopsis; but this indication, like all the others of that fragment, is formed from drawings sent from Madras, and expresses not the discriminat∣ing characters. Brisson makes it his tenth spe∣cies of Sultana Hen, and by consequence pre∣sumes that it has the frontal plate, though Pe∣tiver never mentions it: on the contrary, he says, that its bill is slender, sharp, and longish; he applies the names of <HI>crake</HI> and <HI>rail,</HI> and he represents it as equal in bulk to a goose.

least analogous. The present is a native of Guiana: it is only somewhat larger than the water-rail. It resembles our Sultana Hen so closely, that in the whole history of birds there are few examples of analogies so intimate be∣tween those of the two continents. Its back is blueish green; and all the fore side of the body is soft violet-blue, which covers also the neck and head, assuming a deeper cast.

<P>THIS Mexican bird, which Brisson refers to our sultana hen, or porphyrion of the an∣cients, differs by several characters: besides that we can hardly suppose that a bird of such laborious flight could pass from the one conti∣nent into the other; the toes and feet of the Acintli are not red, but yellow or greenish; all its plumage is blackish purple, intermingled with some white feathers. Fernandez gives it the names of <HI>quachilton</HI> and <HI>yacacintli;</HI> the lat∣ter of which we have adopted, and shortened. The denomination of <HI>avis siliquastrini capitis</HI> is very expressive, and shows that the flat frontal plate is like a large pod, a character which con∣nects this bird with the coots and sultana hens. Fernandez adds, that the Acintli crows like a cock during the night and at the break of day; which might afford a suspicion that it belongs not to the genus of the sultana hen, whose voice bears no resemblance to that of the cock.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="222"/>
A bird of a species nearly allied to this, if not the same, is described by Father Feuillée, under the name of <HI>water hen</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The female has its crown deep fulvous; its mantle of the same colour; its facings white; its wings greenish, mixed with a little fulvous; the quills sky-blue, mixed with a little green: these birds are very lean, and have a disagreeable marshy taste.”</Q> <HI>Feuillée.</HI></NOTE>: it has the character of the sultana, the broad flat escutcheon on the front; all its attire is blue, except a cowl of black on the head and neck. Feuillée remarks also differences of colours between the male and female, which occur not in our sultana hens, in which the female is smaller than the male, but both perfectly alike in colours.</P>
<P>Nature has therefore produced at great dis∣tances the species of sultana hens, but always in the southern latitudes.

<P>THE species of the Coot commences the ex∣tensive tribe of true aquatic birds.

It is seldom seen on land, and is there so bewildered and defenceless, that it frequently suffers itself to be caught with the hand. It spends the whole day on the pools, which it prefers to the rivers; and, except in walking from one pool to another, it never sets foot on

shore: and if the interval be considerable, it has recourse to its wings, and rises very high; but commonly it flies only in the night <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“I never saw it fly during the day but to avoid the fowler; but I have heard it pass over my head at all hours of the night.”</Q> <HI>Observation of M. Hebert.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Coots, like many other water fowl, see best in the dusk, and the older ones never seek their food but in the night <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">According to Salerne, the Coot, when other food fails (and this can seldom happen) dives, and tears up from the bottom of the water the root of a great rush, which it gives its young to suck.</NOTE>. They lurk among the rushes the greatest part of the day; and when disturbed in their retreat, they will bury themselves in the mud rather than spring. They seem to make an effort in commencing the mo∣tion so natural to other birds; and whether on water or on land they rise with difficulty. The young Coots, less solitary or circumspect, are seen at all hours of the day bouncing with small leaps out of the water, one fronting another. They suffer the fowler to approach, yet eye him steadily; and they plunge so nimbly, the instant they perceive the flash, that often they elude the shot. But in autumn, when these birds leave the small pools and assemble on the lakes, vast quan∣tities are caught <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Particularly in Lorraine, on the great pools of Tiaucourt and of Indre.</NOTE>. For this purpose, a num∣ber of skiffs are arranged in a line extending the breadth of the lake; this little fleet is rowed
<PB N="202" REF="226"/>
forward, and drives the Coots into some inlet: the birds, then, urged by fear and necessity, rise at once into the air, and, endeavouring to regain the open water, they pass over the heads of the fowlers, and receive a general and destructive fire. The same plan of operation is now con∣ducted at the other end of the lake, where those which escaped have alighted; and what is sin∣gular, neither the clamours of the sportsmen, the report of the muskets, the spectacle of the range of boats, nor the death of their compa∣nions, can induce these birds to betake to dis∣tant flight. They do not quit this scene of car∣nage till the night following; and a few linger behind next morning.</P>
<P>These indolent birds have deservedly many foes: the moor buzzard sucks their eggs, and plun∣ders their young; and to this destruction must be imputed the fewness of their number, consi∣dering that they are very prolific. The Coot lays eighteen or twenty eggs, which are of a dirty white, and almost as large as a hen's; and if the first hatch be destroyed, the mother has often a second, of ten or twelve eggs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observation of M. Baillon.</NOTE>. She builds in deluged spots covered with dry reeds: she selects a tuft, on which she raises a structure above the level of the water, and lines the ca∣vity with little dry herbs and tops of reeds, forming a large shapeless nest, distinguishable at
<PB N="203" REF="227"/>
a distance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is little probability that the Coot, as Salerne alledges, makes two nests, one for hatching, and another for lodging her young. What may have given rise to this notion is, that the brood, after they have once quitted the nest, never return to it, but squat with their mother among the rushes.</NOTE>. She sits twenty-two or twenty∣three days, and as soon as the young are hatched they jump out of the nest, and never return again. The mother cherishes them under her wings, and they sleep round her beneath the reeds: she leads them to the water, in which they swim and dive well, from the moment of their birth. They are covered at first with a smoky black down, and look very ugly; only the trace is to be seen of the white plate des∣tined to ornament their front. It is then that the bird of prey assails them so cruelly, and often devours the dam and her brood <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same Salerne pretends, that the Coot defends itself against the bird of prey, by presenting its talons, which are, indeed, pretty sharp: but this feeble resistance must generally be of little avail.</NOTE>. The old Coots, which have repeatedly lost their callow offspring, grow cautious from misfortune, and conceal their nests among the flags on the mar∣gin of the pools; and keep together their young among these thick coverts. These alone perpe∣tuate the species; for so great is the depopula∣tion of the rest, that a good observer, who has particularly studied the oeconomy of the Coots <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Baillon.</NOTE>, reckons that not above one-tenth escape the talons of the birds of prey, particularly those of the moor buzzard.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="228"/>
The Coots breed early in the spring, and eggs are found in their body as soon as the end of winter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>. They reside on our pools the greatest part of the year, and in some places they are permanent settlers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As in Lower Picardy, according to the observations of M. Baillon.</NOTE>. Yet in autumn they all leave the small pools, and resort to the large ones, where they assemble in a great flock: there they often remain till December; and when the snows, and especially the frosts, drive them from the high and chill tracts, they de∣scend into the plains, which enjoy a milder tem∣perature; and the want of water, rather than the cold, constrains them to shift their haunts. M. Hebert saw them in a very severe winter on the lake of Nantua, which is late in freezing: he saw them also in the plains of Brie, though in small numbers, in the depth of winter. But, most probably, the bulk of the species remove by degrees to the adjacent countries, which are warmer: for, as their flight is laborious and tardy, they cannot journey to any great distance; and indeed they appear again as early as Fe∣bruary.</P>
<P>The Coots are spread through the whole of Europe, from Italy to Sweden: they are found, too, in Asia <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lettres Edifiantes, <HI>thirtieth collection, p.</HI> 317.</NOTE>. They occur in Greenland, if Egede rightly translates two words in the lan∣guage
<PB N="205" REF="229"/>
of the natives, by the great and little Coot <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Navia</HI> and <HI>Navialursoak.</HI></NOTE>. In fact, the species consists of two fa∣milies, which live in the same lake without ever cohabiting, and are distinguished from each other solely by their bulk, and not by the colour of the frontal plate, as some pretend; for in both that is usually white, and becomes red only in the season of love.</P>
<P>This thick naked membrane, which covers the fore side of the head like an escutcheon, and which made the ancients give the Coot the epithet of <HI>bald,</HI> seems to be a production of the upper layer of the substance of the bill, which is soft, and almost fleshy near the root. The bill is fashioned into a flat cone at the sides, and is bluish white; when in the season of courtship, the frontal plate assumes its vermilion tint.</P>
<P>All the plumage is furnished with a thick down, covered with delicate close feathers; it is of a leaden-black, full and deep on the head and neck, with a white streak on the fold of the wing: no difference indicates the sex. The Coot is as large as a domestic hen, and its head and body are nearly of the same form: its toes are half-webbed, fringed fully on both sides with a membrane, scalloped into festoons, whose knots correspond to the joints of the <HI>phalanges:</HI> these membranes are, like the feet, of a leaden colour: above the knee a small portion of the naked leg is circled with red: the thighs are
<PB N="206" REF="230"/>
thick and fleshy. These birds have a gizzard, two large <HI>caeca,</HI> and a capacious gall-bladder <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>. They live chiefly, as well as the water-hens, on aquatic insects, small fish, and leeches; yet they also gather seeds, and swallow pebbles: their flesh is black, lean, and has a slight marshy taste.</P>
<P>In the state of liberty, the Coot has two dif∣ferent cries, the one broken, the other drawl∣ing: it is the latter, no doubt, from which Ara∣tus draws a prognostic <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Haud modicos tremulo fundens è gutture cantus.</HI> Apud Cicer. <HI>lib.</HI> i. <HI>De Nat.

One of these birds, taken in March 1779, near Montbard, among the vines, whither it had been driven by a violent wind, afforded me an opportunity, for the space of a month, during which it was kept alive, of making the following observations. It refused, at first, all sorts of dressed food, bread, cheese, and flesh, raw or boiled: it rejected also earth-worms and young frogs, whether dead or alive. It required to be crammed with gobbets of soaked bread. It was extremely fond of a tray full of water, and would repose whole hours in it. It sought also to hide itself; though it was not wild, and suffered itself to be laid hold of, only pecking, with a few strokes, the hand that was about to seize it, and
<PB N="208" REF="232"/>
these so feeble, either because of the softness of the bill, or the weakness of the muscles, as hardly to make any impression on the skin: it betrayed neither anger nor impatience; it made no endeavour to escape, and shewed no surprize or fear. But this stupid tranquillity, this total want of vigour and courage, proceeded probably from its bewildered condition, remote from its proper element and its usual habits. It seemed deaf and mute; any noise made close to its ear never moved it, or drew the least in∣clination of its head; and though it was often pursued and teazed, it never vented the smallest cry. We have the water-hen equally mute in captivity. The misery of slavery is greater than is supposed, since it sometimes bereaves its un∣happy victims of even the power of com∣plaining. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Greater Coot, <HI>Fulica Aterrima:</HI> "Its front is white, its bracelets red, its body blackish."</NOTE></P>

<P>THE Grebe is well known by those beauti∣ful silvery white muffs, which have the soft closeness of down, the elasticity of fea∣thers, and the lustre of silk. Its undressed plumage, particularly that of the breast, is really a fine down, very close and firm, and regularly disposed, whose glistening filaments lie upon each other, and join, so as to form a glassy, shining surface, equally impenetrable by cold or humidity. This clothing, so well adapted to the rigours of season and of climate, was neces∣sary to the Grebe, which in the severest win∣ters remains constantly in the water, like the divers; insomuch that it has often been con∣founded with them under the common name <HI>colymbus</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>to go into the water.</HI></NOTE>. But the Grebes differ essentially from the divers, which have their toes com∣pletely
<PB N="214" REF="238"/>
webbed, and not edged with a scalloped membrane, parted at each toe; not to mention other distinctions, which shall be afterwards stat∣ed. Accordingly, accurate naturalists, appro∣priating to the divers the terms <HI>mergus, uria,</HI> and <HI>oethya,</HI> restrict that of <HI>colymbus</HI> to the great and little Grebes.</P>
<P>By its structure, the Grebe is destined to in∣habit the waters; its legs are placed entirely behind, and almost sunk into its belly, so that only the feet appear, and are like oars; they na∣turally throw themselves outwards, and could not support the body of the bird on the ground, unless it stood quite erect. In this position, the striking with its wings would, instead of raising it into the air, only overturn it; since the legs could not aid the impulsion. It requires there∣fore a great effort to begin its flight on land; and, as if conscious of this imbecility, it is observed to avoid the shore; and to prevent its being driven thither, it always swims against the wind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oppian. <HI>Exeutic. lib.</HI> ii.</NOTE>. If unfortunately a wave casts it on the brink, it continues struggling with its feet and wings, though for the most part in vain, to mount into the air, and return to the water: it may be then caught by the hand, in spite of the violent strokes it gives with its bill in defence. But it is as nimble in the water as it is feeble on land: it swims, dives, dashes through the waves, and runs on the surface with surprising rapidity;
<PB N="215" REF="239"/>
its motions are said even to be never quicker and brisker than when under water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. It pur∣sues the fish to a very great depth <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>, and is of∣ten caught in fishermen's nets. It dives deeper than the scoter duck, which is taken only on beds of shell-fish left bare by the ebb-tide; while the Grebes are taken in the open sea, often at more than twenty feet depth.</P>
<P>The Grebes frequent equally the sea and the fresh waters, though naturalists have scarce spoken but of those which are seen on lakes, pools, and inlets of rivers <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>. Several species oc∣cur on the coasts of Brittany, Picardy, and in the channel <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The little and crested Grebes, according to M. Baillon.</NOTE>. The Grebe of the lake of Geneva, which is found also on that of Zuric, and on the other lakes of Switzerland <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE>, and sometimes on that of Nantua, and even on certain pools of Burgundy and Lorraine, is the kind best known. It is rather larger than the coot; its length from the bill to the rump is a foot five inches, and from the bill to the nails a foot and nine or ten inches: all the upper side of the body is deep brown but glossy, and all the fore side is of a very fine silvery white. Like all the other Grebes, it has a small head, a straight and point∣ed bill, and from the corners a small naked red skin extends to the eye; its wings are short and
<PB N="216" REF="240"/>
somewhat disproportioned to the body. The bird rises with difficulty, but after it has caught the wind, it flies far <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. Its voice is loud and rough <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner and Belon.</NOTE>. Its leg, or rather its tarsus, is wi∣dened and flattened laterally; the scales with which it is covered form on the hind part a double indenting; the nails are broad and flat: the tail is wanting in all the grebes, but they have on the rump the tubercles, in which the tail-quills are usually inserted, but these tuber∣cles are smaller than in other birds, and only bear a tuft of small feathers.</P>
<P>These birds are commonly very fat: not only they feed their young with little fishes, they eat sea-weed and other plants <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>, and swallow mud <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>. White feathers too are often found in their sto∣mach; not that they devour birds, they catch the down which plays on the water, mistaking it for a small fish. It is most probable that the Grebes, like the cormorants, cast up the residue of digestion; at least fish-bones are found rolled into pellets and unaltered at the bottom of the ventricle.</P>
<P>The fishers of Picardy resort to the English coast in search of the Grebes' nests, since they do not breed on that of France <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Observations of M. Baillon.</NOTE>; and they find these in the holes of rocks, into which the birds
<PB N="217" REF="241"/>
probably fly, since they cannot climb, and whence the young must throw themselves into the sea. But on our large pools they build with reeds and rushes interwoven, and the nest is half dipped in the water, though not entirely afloat, as Linnaeus asserts, but shut and attached to the reeds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations of M. Lottinger.</NOTE>. It commonly contains two eggs, sel∣dom three. Against the month of June the young nestlings are seen swimming with their dam <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The genus of these birds consists of two fa∣milies differing in size. To the large sort we shall appropriate the name <HI>grebes,</HI> and to the small, that of <HI>chesnuts (castagneux):</HI> this division is natural and ancient, and seems to be indicated by Athenaeus under the terms <HI>colymbis</HI> and <HI>colym∣bida;</HI> since to the latter he constantly joins the epithet of <HI>little.</HI> There is however considerable variety in regard to size. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Tippet Grebe, <HI>Colymbus Urinator:</HI> <Q>“Its head is smooth, its lower eye-lid yellow, a white spot on the wings.”</Q> The Grebes are very attentive in feeding their young, and will even carry them when tired on their back or under their wings. Their flesh is rank, but their fat is supposed to have great virtue in rheumatic complaints. On the lake of Geneva, these birds appear in small flocks of ten or twelve: they sell fourteen shillings a-piece. The skin, with the beautiful plumage on the under side of the body, is made into muffs and tippets. This species is rare in England.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE feathers on the crown of the head ex∣tend a little behind, and form a sort of crest, which it raises or depresses according as it is tranquil or discomposed.

<P>THIS Grebe has a black tuft, divided behind as it were into two horns; it has also a sort of mane, rufous at the root, black at the point, cut round the neck; which gives it a very odd look, and makes it to be regarded as a monstrous species.

<P>This Horned Grebe seems to be extensively spread: it is known in Italy, in Switzerland, in Germany, in Poland, in Holland, and in Eng∣land. As it is of a very singular figure, it has been every where remarked. Fernandez de∣scribes

<P>THERE is the same difference with regard to bulk between the two horned grebes as between the two crested grebes. The little Horned Grebe has two pencils of feathers, which growing out from behind the eyes, form its horns of an orange rufous: this is also the colour of the fore side of the neck and of the flanks; the top of the neck is clothed with puffed feathers, not broken, however, or intersected by a ridge; these feathers are brown tinged with greenish, and so is the upper side of the head: the man∣tle is brown, and the breast silvery white, as in the other grebes. It is of this in particular that the nest is said by Linnaeus to float on the water: he adds, that it lays four of five eggs, and that the female is entirely gray <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> No 123.</NOTE>.</P>

But its being found in North America is no reason why Brisson should infer that it is the same with the <HI>Yaca∣pitzahoac</HI> of Fernandez; which indeed appears to be a grebe, but is not sufficiently characte∣rized. With regard to the <HI>Trapazorola</HI> of Gesner, as likewise of Brisson, it is most proba∣bly a <HI>chesnut;</HI> at least it is not a horned grebe, since Gesner expressly mentions its having no crest.</P>

<P>THOUGH many aquatic birds dive even to the bottom of the water in pursuit of their prey, the name of <HI>Diver</HI> has been appropriated to a small family, distinguished from the rest by their strait pointed bill, and their three fore toes connected together by an entire membrane, which throws a hem along the inner toe, from which the hind one is parted: their nails are also small and pointed; their tail is extremely short, and scarce visible; their feet are very flat, and placed quite behind the body; lastly, their leg is concealed in the lower belly, a disposi∣tion well adapted for swimming, but almost in∣compatible with walking. In fact, the Divers, when on land, are obliged, like the grebes, to stand erect, and cannot maintain their balance: but in the water their motions are so nimble and prompt, that, the instant they perceive the flash of a gun, they plunge and escape the ball <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The Divers of Louisiana are the same with ours, and when they see the fire of the touch-pan, they dive so nimbly, that the lead cannot hit them; for which reason they are called <HI>lead-eaters.</HI>”</Q> Le Page Dupratz, <HI>Hist. de la Louisiane,</HI> tom. ii. p. 115.</NOTE>.

Accordingly, expert fowlers fasten a bit of paste∣board to their piece, in such manner as to leave the aim free, and yet screen from the bird the gleam of the priming.</P>
<P>We know five species of Divers, two of which, a greater and a lesser, occur equally on the fresh waters of inland countries, and on the salt flood near the sea-shore: The three other species seem to be attached wholly to the coasts, particularly in the north.</P>

<P>THIS Diver is almost as large and as tall as the goose. It is known on the lakes of Switzerland; and the name <HI>Fluder,</HI> which it re∣ceives on that of Constance, alludes, according to Gesner's remark, to its laborious motion on land, struggling at once with its wings and its feet. It never rises but from the water; and in that element its motions are as easy as they are
<PB REF="261"/>
<FIGURE>

<PB N="235" REF="262"/>
rapid. It dives to very great depths, and swims under water to the distance of an hundred paces without emerging to take breath: a portion of air included in its dilated wind-pipe supplies its respiration during this interval. The same is the case with other divers and grebes; they glide through the water freely in all directions; in it they find their food, their shelter, their asylum: when the bird of prey hovers above them, or the fowler appears on the shore, they plunge for safety. But man, still more formida∣ble by his address than by his strength, prepares snares for them, even in the bottom of their re∣treat: a net or a line baited with a small fish, allures the unwary bird; it swallows death with the repast, and perishes in that element where it received birth; for its nest is placed on the water amidst the tall rushes.</P>
<P>Aristotle justly observes, that the Divers be∣gin to breed in early spring, and that the gulls do not breed till the end of that season, or the beginning of summer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Animal. <HI>lib.</HI> v. 9.</NOTE>. But Pliny, who often merely copies the philosopher, has here injudi∣ciously contradicted him, by employing the name <HI>Mergus</HI> to signify an aquatic bird which nestles in trees <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mergi &amp; in arboribus pariunt,</HI> lib. x. 32. He likewise confounds the Diver with certain gulls, when he attributes to it the habit of devouring the excrements of other birds. <HI>Mergi soliti sunt devorare quae ceterae reddunt,</HI> lib. x. 47.</NOTE>; a property which belongs to
<PB N="236" REF="263"/>
the cormorant and some other aquatic birds, but which has no relation to the Divers, since they nestle at the foot of rushes.</P>
<P>Some observers have asserted that the Great Diver was very silent: yet Gesner ascribes to it a singular and loud cry; but probably this is sel∣dom heard.</P>
<P>Willughby seems to admit a variety, in which the back is of an uniform colour; whereas, in the ordinary kind, the upper surface is waved with light gray on a brown gray, and this brown, clouded and dotted with whitish, ap∣pears on the upper side of the head and neck, which is besides ornamented below by a half collar tinged with the same colours, terminated with fine white on the breast and the under side of the body. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Colymbus Immer:</HI> <Q>“Its body is blackish above, waved with white, below entirely white.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>THIS Diver resembles the preceding in its colours, and has likewise all the fore side of its body white: its back, and the upper side of its neck and head, are blackish-cinereous, entirely sprinkled with little white drops. The largest of this kind measure at the utmost a foot nine inches from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail, and two feet to the extremity of the toes, and the alar extent is two feet and an half; whereas the preceding species is two feet and an half from the bill to the nails, and four feet across the wings. Their natural habits are nearly the same.</P>
<P>The Little Divers are seen at all times on our pools, which they do not quit till the ice obliges them to flit to the rivers and brooks of running water: they depart in the night-time, and re∣move as little as possible from their former haunts. It was remarked, even in the time of
<PB N="238" REF="265"/>
Aristotle, that they did not disappear in winter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Animal. <HI>lib.</HI> v. 9.</NOTE>. That philosopher also says, that they lay two or three eggs: but our sportsmen make them to lay three or four, and say, that when a person ap∣proaches the nest, the mother plunges into the water, and that the young ones just hatched throw themselves after her. The swimming and diving of these birds are always attended with noise, and with a very quick agitation of their wings and tail. The motion of their feet impels them forward, not in the line of their body, but sidewise in the diagonal. M. Hebert observed this in a captive Diver, which being held by a long string, took always that direc∣tion: it appeared to have lost nothing of its na∣tural liberty: it was kept on a river, where it lived by catching small fish. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] The speckled Diver lays its eggs near the verge of mari∣time lakes: they are oval, dusky with some black spots, and as large as those of a goose.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The SEA-CAT DIVER.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THIRD SPECIES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Diver, which is very like the little fresh-water Diver, was sent to us from the coasts of Picardy, which it frequents, particu∣larly
<PB N="239" REF="266"/>
in winter, and where it is called by the fishers <HI>cat-marin,</HI> because it eats much young fry. They are often caught in the nets spread for the scoter-ducks, with which they generally arrive; for they are observed to retire in sum∣mer, as if they spent that season in more north∣ern countries. Some, however, breed in the Scilly isles on the rocks, which they gain by springing from the water, having taken advan∣tage of a swell: for, like the other Divers, they can hardly rise from the land <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“I one day found two of these Divers, which had been cast ashore by the waves; they were lying on the sand, working their feet and wings, and crawling with difficulty: I gathered them like stones, yet they were not wounded; and one of them thrown up, flew, dived, and played on the water before my eyes.”</Q> <HI>Ob∣servation communicated by M. Baillon, of Montreuil-sur-mer.</HI></NOTE>; nor can they even run but on the waves, which they rapidly graze in an erect attitude, the lower part of their body being immersed.</P>
<P>This bird enters with the tide into the mouths of rivers. It prefers small smelts, and the fry of the sturgeon and conger. As it swims almost as fast as other birds fly, and dives as well as fish, it has every possible advantage for seizing its fugitive prey.</P>
<P>The young ones, less dextrous and less expe∣rienced than the old, subsist only on shrimps; yet both are, at all seasons, extremely fat. M. Baillon, who has carefully observed these Divers on the coasts of Picardy, and who has furnished
<PB N="240" REF="267"/>
us with these details, subjoins, that the female is distinguished by being two inches shorter than the male, which measures two feet three inches from the point of the bill to the end of the nails, and its alar extent three feet two inches: the plumage of the young ones, till moulting, is a smoky black, without any of the white spots sprinkled on the back of the adults.</P>
<P>We shall refer to this kind, as a variety, a black-headed Diver, which Brisson makes his fifth species, and applies to it the names given by Willughby and Ray, which refer only to the northern Diver.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, though not with re∣gard to any particular species of Divers, that the flesh of these birds is improved by living, in Lough Foyle, near Londonderry in Ireland, on a certain plant, whose stalk is soft, and almost as sweet, it is said, as a sugar-cane.</P>

<P><HI>LUMME</HI> or <HI>Loom</HI> in Lapponic signifies <HI>lame,</HI> alluding to the tottering pace of this bird when on land: it seldom however comes ashore, but swims almost constantly, and breeds at the verge of the flood on desert coasts.

<P>The Lumme is smaller than the imbrim, and about the bulk of a duck; its back is black sprinkled with little white squares; the throat is black, and also the fore side of the head, of which the upper side is covered with gray fea∣thers; the top of the neck is clothed with simi∣lar

Gen. des Voyages, tom.</HI> xv. <HI>p.</HI> 309.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears that these Divers scarcely ever quit the northern seas; though, according to Klein, they visit from time to time the coasts of the Baltic, and are well known through the whole of Sweden <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fauna Suecica.</NOTE>. Their principal abode is on the shores of Norway, Iceland, and Greenland: these they frequent the whole summer, and there breed their young, which they rear with singular care and solicitude. On this subject, Anderson gives details which would be interest∣ing, were they all accurate. He says that they lay only two eggs, and that as soon as a young Lumme is able to quit the nest, the parents lead it to the water, the one flying always above it to keep off the bird of prey, and the other be∣low to receive it in case it should fall; and that if notwithstanding their assistance, the nestling fall to the ground, the parents rush after it, and rather than forsake it, they suffer themselves to be caught by men or eaten by foxes, which ever watch those opportunities, and which, in those bleak frozen regions, are constrained to turn all their sagacity and wiles against the birds. This
<PB N="245" REF="273"/>
author adds, that when the Lummes have once reached the sea with their young, they return no more to land. He affirms even that the old ones which have accidentally lost their family, or are past breeding, never revisit the shore, but swim always in flocks of sixty or a hundred. <Q>“If we throw a young one into the sea before a flock of Lummes, they will all gather round it, and strive to attend it; nay they will fight about it till the victor leads it off: but if the mother happen to intervene, the quarrel im∣mediately ceases, and the infant is consigned to her care.”</Q></P>
<P>On the approach of winter, these birds retire, and appear not again until the spring. Ander∣son conjectures, that, shaping their course be∣tween the east and the west, they arrive in America: and Edwards in fact admits that this species is common both to the northern seas of that continent and of Europe. We might add those of Asia; for the red-throated diver brought from Siberia, and represented under that name in our <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> is exactly the same with that of Edwards, <HI>pl.</HI> 97, which this naturalist gives as the female Lumme from the unimpeached vera∣city of his correspondent Isham, a good ob∣server, who sent both cock and hen from Green∣land.</P>

The Spitzbergen <HI>Lumb</HI> of Martens appears, ac∣cording to Ray's observation, to be different from the Lummes of Greenland and Iceland, since <HI>its bill is hooked:</HI> yet its attachment to its young, and the manner in which it leads them to the sea, defending them from the bird of prey, show a great analogy to these birds in its natural habits <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The bill of the <HI>Lumb</HI> resembles much that of the diver pi∣geon, except that it is somewhat harder and more hooked.

<P>The Merganser is of a middle size, between the duck and the goose: but in its stature, its plumage, and its short flight, is more allied to the duck. Its name, <HI>diver-goose, (mergus-anser)</HI> seems to have been formed by Gesner injudici∣ously; for the resemblance of its bill to that of
<PB REF="277"/>

<PB N="249" REF="278"/>
the diver, on which that appellation rests, is very imperfect. The bill is nearly cylindrical, and strait to the point, like that of the diver; but differs inasmuch as the point is bent in the fashion of a crooked nail, with a hard, horny substance; it differs also because the edges are be et with indentings reflected backwards: the tongue is rough, with hard <HI>papillae</HI> turned back∣wards like the indentings on the bill, which serve to hold the slippery fish, and even to draw it into the throat of the bird: accordingly, with a gluttonous voracity, it swallows fish much larger than can enter entire into its stomach: the head first lodges in the oesophagus, and is digested before the body can descend.</P>
<P>The Merganser swims with all its body sub∣merged, and only its head out of the water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus and Wormius.</NOTE>: it dives deep, remains long under water, and tra∣verses a great space before it again appears. Though its wings are short, it flies rapidly, and oftenest it shoots above the surface of the wa∣ter <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rzyczynski.</NOTE>: it then appears almost entirely white, and is therefore denominated <HI>harle blanc</HI> in some parts of France, as in Brie, where however it is rare. Yet the fore side of its body is washed with pale yellow: the upper side of the neck and all the head are black, changing by reflec∣tions into green; and the feathers, which are slender, silky, long, and bristled up from the nape

to the front, augment much the bulk of the head: the back consists of three colours, black on the top and on the great coverts of the wings, white on the middle ones and most of the co∣verts, and handsomely fringed with gray upon white at the rump: the tail is gray: the eyes, the feet, and part of the bill, are red.</P>
<P>The Merganser, we have seen, is a very beau∣tiful bird; but its flesh is dry and unpleasant food <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon relates the vulgar proverb, <HI>He who would regale the de∣vil, might serve him with merganser and cormorant.</HI></NOTE>.

In Switzerland their appearance on the lakes is supposed to forebode a severe winter: and though they must be known on the Loire, since there, according to Belon, they received the name of <HI>harle</HI> or <HI>herle,</HI> that observer him∣self intimates, that they retire in winter to more southern climates, for he saw them entering from the north into Egypt; yet he says, that in every other season except winter they are found on the Nile, which is difficult to reconcile.</P>

The female is distinguished from the male by its head being of a duller rufous, its back gray, and all the fore side of its body white, faintly tinged with fulvous on the breast.</P>
<P>According to Willughby, this species is very common on the lagoons of Venice; and since Muller affirms that it is found in Denmark and Norway, and Linnaeus, that it also inhabits Lapland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Knipa</HI> of Schoeffer, <HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI></NOTE>, it probably frequents the interme∣diate countries. In fact, Schwenckfeld assures us, that this bird passes into Silesia, where it is seen in the beginning of winter on the pools among the mountains. Salerne says that it is very common on the Loire; but from his manner of speaking of it, he seems to have ob∣served it very inattentively. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Crested Merganser, <HI>Mergus-Ser∣rator:</HI> <Q>“Its crest is hanging; its breast tawny and variegated;

<P>WE rank these birds together, because they differ less than the male and female in this genus; especially as they are nearly of the same size. Belon, who has described one under the name of <HI>tiers (third)</HI> says that it was so called as being intermediate, or <HI>the third between the duck and the morillon,</HI> and that its wings imitate, by their motley colours, the variety of the mo∣rillon's
<PB N="256" REF="285"/>
wings: he was mistaken however in joining his <HI>tiers</HI> with this bird, since its bill is entirely different from that of the morillon; and its bulk approaches more to that of the duck. This description exactly suits then the <HI>Mergus Leucomelanus (black and white merganser)</HI> of Brisson; it also agrees with his <HI>Mergus Niger,</HI> (or <HI>black merganser)</HI> except that the neck of this last has a bay cast, and that its tail is black: the bill and feet of both are red. Schwenck∣feld says, that the former are seldom seen in Silesia; but he does not by that expression in∣sinuate that the latter is more common there, while he remarks that some of these appear on the rivers in March on the breaking up of the ice.</P>

<P>THE great difference between the male and female in this genus occasions much con∣fusion in the nomenclature: and we strongly
<PB N="257" REF="286"/>
suspect that if the Stellated Merganser were bet∣ter described and better known, it would be found to be the female of some of the foregoing species. Willughby was of this opinion, and regarded it as the female of the mantled Mer∣ganser; and indeed it has the peculiar property of that bird, being found sometimes entirely white. Brisson gives it the epithet <HI>stellated,</HI> from a white spot, figured like a star, which is placed, he says, below a black spot that sur∣rounds the eyes. The upper side of the head is bay colour, the mantle blackish brown, all the fore side of the body is white, and the wing is partly white, partly black; the bill is black, or lead-coloured, as in the mantled Merganser; and these two birds are nearly of the same size. Gesner says, that this Merganser is called in Switzerland the <HI>Ice Duck,</HI> because it does not appear on the lakes till hard frost sets in. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Mergus Minutus:</HI> <Q>“Its head is smooth and gray, a black bar on its eye, a white spot under the eye.”</Q> In winter, these birds visit the shores of our island, from the northern regions.</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS Merganser, which is found in Virgi∣nia, is very remarkable for a fine edged crown on its head, black in the circumference, and white in the middle, formed of feathers ele∣vated to a disk; which has a fine effect, but ap∣pears to advantage only in the living bird. Its breast and belly are white; the bill, the face, the neck, and the back, are black; the quills of the tail and wings are brown; the innermost in the wings are black, and marked with a white streak. This bird is nearly as large as a duck: the fe∣male is entirely brown, and its crest is smaller than that of the male. Fernandez has described both under the Mexican name <HI>Ecatototl,</HI> with the epithet <HI>wind-bird,</HI> without mentioning the reason.

maternal tenderness, tearing its breast to nourish its languishing family with its blood. This tale, which the Egyptians had before re∣lated of the vulture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horus Apollo.</NOTE>, cannot apply to the Peli∣can, which lives in abundance <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">St. Augustine and St. Jerome seem to be the authors of the application of this fable, originally Egyptian, to the Pelican.</NOTE>, and even en∣joys an advantage over the other piscivorous birds, being provided with a bag for storing its provisions.</P>

It therefore supports itself easily, and for a length of time, in the air: it balances itself with alertness, and never changes its place but to dart directly downwards on its prey, which cannot escape; for the violence of the
<PB N="261" REF="291"/>
dash, and its wide-spread wings, which strike and cover the surface of the water, make it boil and whirl <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Petr. Martyr.</HI> Nov. Orb. decad. i. lib. 6.</NOTE>, and at the same time stun the fish, and deprive it of the power of flight <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Labat and Dutertre.</NOTE>. Such is their mode of fishing when alone; but in large flocks they vary their manoeuvres, and act in concert: they range themselves in a line, and swim in company, forming a large circle, which they contract by degrees to inclose the fishes <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Adanson, <HI>Voyage au Senegal, p.</HI> 136.</NOTE>, and they share the capture at their conve∣nience.</P>
<P>These birds spend in fishing the hours of the morning and evening, when the finny tribe are most in motion; and chuse the places where they are most plentiful. It is amusing to behold them sweeping the water, rising a few fathoms above it, falling with their neck extended and their sac half full; then ascending with effort to drop again <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Nieremberg, <HI>Hist. Nat. lib.</HI> x. <HI>p.</HI> 223.</NOTE>, and continuing this exertion till their wide bag is entirely filled.

<P>It appears to me, that this instinct of the Pe∣lican, of not swallowing its prey at first, but collecting a provision, might be turned to ac∣count; and that, like the cormorant, it might be

<P>The feathers on its neck are only a short down; those on the nape are longer, and form a sort of tuft; its head is flat at the sides; its eyes are small, and placed in two broad naked cheeks; its tail is composed of eighteen quills; the co∣lours of its bill are yellow and pale orange on a gray ground, with streaks of bright red on the middle and near the extremity; this bill is flattened above like a broad blade, with a longi∣tudinal

applied by the ancients to this large bird, the latter refers to its strange voice, which they compared to the braying of an ass. Klein sup∣poses that it makes this noise with its throat plunged in the water; but this idea seems to be borrowed from the bittern, for the Pelican ut∣ters its raucous cry far from the water, and screams loudest in open air.

<P>The first name <HI>pelecanus</HI> or <HI>pelicanus</HI> has mis∣led the translators of Aristotle, and even Cicero and Pliny: they have rendered it by the word <HI>platea,</HI> which would confound the <HI>Pelican</HI> with the <HI>spoon-bill.</HI> When Aristotle says that the <HI>pelecanus</HI> swallows thin shell-fish and casts them up half-digested, in order to separate the meat which they contain, he imputes to it a habit which agrees better with the spoon-bill, consi∣dering the structure of its <HI>oesophagus:</HI> for the pouch of the Pelican is not a stomach where digestion is begun; and Pliny inaccurately com∣pared the manner in which the <HI>onocrotalus</HI> swallows and brings up its food to the process carried on in ruminating animals. <Q>“There is nothing here,”</Q> M.

<PB N="272" REF="302"/>
remarks, <Q>“but what enters into the general plan of the organization of birds: all of them have a craw in which their food is lodged; in the Pelican it lies without and under the bill, in∣stead of being concealed within, and placed at the bottom of the <HI>oesophagus.</HI> But this exte∣rior craw has not the digestive heat of that of other birds, and in this bag the Pelican car∣ries the fish entire to its young. To disgorge them it presses the pouch against its breast; and this very natural act may have given rise to the fable so generally told, that the Pelican opens its breast to nourish its offspring with its blood.”</Q></P>
<P>The nest of the Pelican is commonly found at the verge of waters; it places it flat on the ground <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon, Sonnerat, and others.—<Q>“They lay on the bare ground, and cover their eggs in this situation....

There was a number of young ones on our islet.... I took two young ones, which I fastened to a stake, and I had the pleasure, for some days, of seeing the mother, which fed them and remained the whole of the day with them, passing the night on a tree above their heads; all the three were grown so familiar that they allowed me to touch them, and the young ones took very graci∣ously the little fish which I offered them, and which they put first into their pouch. I believe that I should have brought them away, if their dirtiness had not hindered me: they are filthier than geese or ducks; and we may say that their life is divided into three acts, to seek food, to sleep, and to eject every minute heaps of excrements as large as one's hand.”</Q> Labat, <HI>Nouveau Voyage aux iles de l'Amerique, tom.</HI> viii. <HI>pp.</HI> 294, 296.</NOTE>; and Salerne was mistaken, confound∣ing

It seems that nature has provided with singu∣lar caution against the suffocation of the Peli∣can: when, to swallow its prey, it opens under water its whole bag, the <HI>trachea arteria,</HI> then leaving the <HI>vertebrae</HI> of the neck, adheres under this bag, and occasions a very sensible swelling; at the same time two sphincter muscles contract the <HI>aesophagus</HI> in such manner as to completely prevent the water from entering <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences, <HI>p.</HI> 196.</NOTE>. At the bottom of this same bag is concealed a tongue so short, that the bird has been believed to have none <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE>; the nostrils also are almost invisible, and placed at the root of the bill; the heart is very large; the kidney very small; the <HI>caeca</HI> equally small, and much less in proportion than in the goose, the duck, and the swan: Lastly, Aldrovandus assures us, that the Pelican has only twelve ribs; and he observes that a strong membrane, furnished with thick muscles, covers the pinions.</P>

<PB N="276" REF="306"/>
spread under the skin through the whole body of the Pelican. It may even be said that this is a general fact, more conspicuous indeed in the case of the Pelican, but which obtains in all birds, and which M. Lory, a celebrated and learned physician at Paris, has demonstrated by tracing the communication from the atmosphere to the bones and the pipes of the quills. In the Pelican, the air passes from the breast into the axillary sinuses, whence it insinuates into the vesicles of the thick and swelled cellular mem∣brane which covers the muscles and envelopes the whole body, under the membrane in which the feathers are rooted; these vesicles are in∣flated to such a degree, that on pressing the bo∣dy, the air is observed to escape every way under the fingers. During expiration, the air compress∣ed in the breast passes into the sinuses, and thence spreads into all the vesicles of the cellular tex∣ture: by blowing into the <HI>trachea arteria,</HI> we may even make the course of the air sensible to the eye. We may conceive therefore how
<PB N="277" REF="307"/>
much the Pelican may enlarge its volume with∣out increasing its weight, and how much this must facilitate the flight of this great bird.</P>

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the PELICAN.</HEAD>
<P>WE have observed in many articles of this Natural History, that in general the spe∣cies of the large birds, like those of the large quadrupeds, exist single, detached, and almost without varieties; that they also appear every∣where the same; whereas under each genus or in each family of small animals, and especially in those of the little birds, there is a multitude of breeds more or less akin to the parent stock, and which have improperly been denominated <HI>species.</HI> That term, and the metaphysical no∣tion which it involves, often withdraws us from
<PB N="278" REF="308"/>
the true knowledge of the shades of nature in her productions, much more than the names of <HI>varieties,</HI> of <HI>breeds,</HI> and of <HI>families.</HI> But this lineage, which is lost amidst the collateral branches in the small species, maintains itself among the large ones; for they admit of few varieties only, which may always be easily re∣ferred to their primary trunk. The ostrich, the cassowary, the condor, the swan, all the birds of the first magnitude, have few or no va∣rieties in their species. Those which may be reckoned the second order in bulk or strength, such as the crane, the stork, the pelican, the albatross, admit of only a small number of these varieties, which in the Pelican may be reduced to two.</P>

<P>WE have already remarked, that the plumage of the Pelican is subject to vary, and that, according to the age, it is more or less white
<PB N="279" REF="309"/>
and tinged with a little rose-colour: it seems to vary also from circumstances, for it is some∣times mixed with gray and black. These dif∣ferences have been remarked between indivi∣duals which undoubtedly belonged to the same species <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“Some had their plumage entirely white, with the light and transparent cast of flesh-colour, except the wings, whose great quills had a tinge of gray and black; the others were of a much more decided flesh or rose-colour.”</Q> <HI>Memoires de Academie des Sciences,</HI> &amp;c.

But these intermingled colours are so little removed from a general gray or brown cast, that Klein has not hesitated to assert posi∣tively that the brown and white pelicans are only varieties of the same species. Sir Hans Sloane, who had carefully observed the Brown Pelicans of America, confesses also that they appeared to be th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same with the white peli∣cans. Oviedo, speaking of the pelicans with a cinereous plumage which occur on the rivers of the Antilles, remarks, that some of them are of a very fine white <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voy. <HI>tom.</HI> xiii. <HI>p.</HI> 228.</NOTE>. We are inclined to think that the brown colour is the garb of the young ones; for the Brown Pelicans have generally been found to be smaller than the white. Those seen near Hudson's Bay were also smaller and of a dusky cast <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ellis, and l'Hist. Gen. des Voy. <HI>tom.</HI> xiv. <HI>p.</HI> 663; and <HI>tom.</HI> xv. <HI>p.</HI> 268.</NOTE>; so that their white is not oc∣casioned by the severity of the climate. The
<PB N="280" REF="310"/>
same variety of colour is observed in the hot countries of the ancient continent. Sonnerat, after having described two pelicans of the Phi∣lippine islands, the one brown and the other rose-colour, expresses a suspicion, as we do, that he had only viewed the same bird at different ages. And what confirms our opinion, Brisson has given a Philippine pelican, which seems to form the intermediate shade, being not entirely gray or brown, but having only the wings and part of the back of that colour, and the rest white <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“Above gray cinereous, below white, the rump of the same colour; the head and neck bright whitish, with a longitudinal bar on the upper part of the neck, variegated with brown and whitish; the greater wing-quills cinereous blackish, the tail∣quills cinereous white, their shafts blackish, the lateral ones bright white at their origin.”</Q></P></NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Pelecanus Fuscus:</HI> <Q>“It is ash∣brown, its primary wing-quills black, its throat furnished with a pouch.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>IF the indenting of the bill of this Mexican Pelican be natural and regular, like that of the bill of the merganser and some other birds, this particular character would suffice to consti∣tute a different species, though Brisson gives it only as a variety: but if this indenting be formed by the accidental chipping of the edges of the bill, as we have remarked in the bill of certain calaos, the accidental difference deserves not even to be admitted as a variety; and we lean more to this opinion, as Hernandez men∣tions the common pelican and the Indented∣billed Pelican as inhabiting the same places.</P>

<PB N="283" REF="314"/>
webbed feet, which swims and dives with equal facility, and devours multitudes of fish: it is nearly of the bulk of the goose, of a narrower form, rather thin than thick, and lengthened by a large tail more spread than usual in the aquatic birds; this tail consists of fourteen stiff feathers like those of the woodpecker's tail; they are black glossed with green, like almost all the rest of the plumage: the back is waved with black festoons on a brown ground; but these shades vary in different individuals, for Salerne says, that the colour of the plumage is some∣times a greenish black: all of them have two white spots on the outside of the legs; with a white gorget, which embraces the top of the neck like a chin-piece: there are white feathery filaments like bristles, stuck on the top of the neck and the upper part of the head, of which the front and the sides are bald <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“Some animals are naturally bald, as the ostriches and the water ravens, which thence derive their Greek name.”</Q> <HI>Plin.</HI> lib. ii. 38.</NOTE>: a skin, also naked, clothes the under side of the bill, which is straight to the point, where it is bent into a very sharp hook.</P>
<P>The Cormorant is one of the few birds which have four toes connected together by a single piece of membrane. We might thence infer that it is a very great swimmer; yet it remains less in the water than many other aquatic birds,
<PB N="284" REF="315"/>
whose soles are neither so continuous nor so broad: it frequently flies and perches on trees. Aristotle ascribes this habit to it alone of all the <HI>palmiped</HI> birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Animal.</HI> lib. viii. 3.</NOTE>; but it is common to the pe∣lican, the booby, the frigate, the anhinga, and the tropic bird; and what is singular, these birds, together with it, form the small number of the aquatic species which have the four toes con∣nected by continuous membranes. This coin∣cidence has induced modern ornithologists to range five or six birds under the generic name of <HI>pelican</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Klein and Linnaeus have formed this family. The Cormo∣rant there figures, under the appellation <HI>pelecanus carbo;</HI> the fri∣gate, under that of <HI>pelecanus aquilus,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. But the analogy must be strained for the sake of a scholastic generalization; when, from the resemblance of a single part, the same appellation is given to species so different from each other as that of the tropic bird, for instance, and that of the common pelican.</P>
<P>The Cormorant is so dextrous in fishing, and so voracious, that when it visits a pool, it com∣mits alone more havoc than a whole flock of other piscivorous birds. Fortunately, it resides almost constantly on the sea-shores, and seldom occurs in inland countries <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“On the 27th of January (1779) a Cormorant was brought to me, which was just killed on the side of the river Ouche: it had perched on a willow.”</Q> <HI>Extract of a letter from M.

<PB N="285" REF="316"/>
with the rapidity of a dart, its prey scarce ever escapes, and it almost always emerges holding a fish across in its bill: to swallow the victim it employs a singular expedient; it tosses up the fish in the air, and dextrously catches the head in fall∣ing, so that the fins lie flat and favour the passage down the throat, while the membranous skin that lines the under side of its bill stretches to admit the whole body of the fish, which is often very large in proportion to the neck of the bird.</P>
<P>In some countries, as in China, and formerly in England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to Lynceus in Willughby.</NOTE>, the skill of the Cormorant in fish∣ing was turned to profit: for, by buckling a ring about the lower part of its neck, to prevent de∣glutition, and accustoming it to return with its acquisitions in its bill to its master, it was made, so to say, a domestic fisher. On the rivers of China, the Cormorants, thus buckled, are perched on the prows of the boats, and on a signal being given, by striking the water with an oar, they plunge into that element, and quickly emerge with a fish, which is taken out of their bill; and this toil is continued, till its master, satisfied with the earnings, loosens its collar, and permits it to fish for its own account <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nieremberg.

Their bill is furnished below with a skin of a fine orange colour, which extends under the throat a few lines, and dilates at pleasure. The iris is of a fine light green;

the pupil black; the orbit edged with a violet skin: the tail is formed like that of the wood∣pecker, containing fourteen hard sharp quills.

what is singular, they support alike the heat of that climate and the cold of Siberia. It appears, however, that the severe winters of the northern regions oblige them to migrate: for those which in summer inhabit the lakes in the neighbourhood of Selenginskoi, where they are called <HI>baclans,</HI> have been observed to retire in autumn to Lake Bai∣kal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“The inhabitants of these cantons believe that when the <HI>bac∣lans</HI> make their nests on the top of a tree, it grows dry; in fact, we saw that all the trees where were nests of these birds had wi∣thered; but perhaps they chuse trees already decayed.”</Q> Gmelin; <HI>Voyage en Siberie, tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 244.</P></NOTE>, there to spend the winter. The same must be the case with the <HI>ouriles,</HI> or Cormorants of Kamtschatka, well described by Krascheninicoff <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voy. <HI>tom.</HI> xix. <HI>p.</HI> 272.</NOTE>, and indicated in the fabulous relation of the Kamtschadales, who say that these birds have bartered their tongue with the wild goats, for the tufts of white bristles on their neck and thighs <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem. <HI>tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 272.</NOTE>: yet is it false that these birds have no tongue; and Steller avers, that they sound day and night with a voice like the note of a little hoarse trumpet.</P>
<P>These Cormorants of Kamtschatka pass the night, gathered in flocks, on the projections of craggy rocks, from which they often fall to the ground during their sleep, and then become the prey of the foxes, which are ever on the watch. In the day-time, the Kamtschadales search for their
<PB N="289" REF="320"/>
eggs, at the risk of tumbling upon the precipices, or dashing into the sea. And to catch the birds themselves, they fasten a running knot to the end of a rod: the heavy, indolent Cormorant, when once seated, cares not to stir, but only turns his head from right to left to avoid the noose, which is at last slipped on his neck.</P>
<P>The head of the Cormorant is sensibly flat, like that of most diving birds; its eyes are placed very much forward, and near the corners of the bill, whose substance is very hard, and shining like horn; the feet are black, short, and very strong; the tarsus is very broad, and flattened sidewise; the middle nail is serrated interiorly, like that of the heron; the pinions are very long, but clothed with short quills, which makes it fly heavily, as Schwenckfeld observes.

<P>THE heaviness or rather indolence natural to all the Cormorants, is still more remark∣able in the present; which has, for that reason, been styled the <HI>Shag</HI> or <HI>Ninny (Niais</HI> ou <HI>Nigaud).</HI> This species is not less diffused than the for∣mer: it occurs particularly in the islands and the extremities of the southern continents. Cook and Forster found it on the island of Georgia; which, though not inhabited, and almost inacces∣sible by man, is stocked with these little Cormo∣rants, which share the domain with the penguins, and lodge among the tufts of rushy grass, the only vegetable production in that dreary tract. Staten-land is similar, and contains likewise great numbers of birds. An island in the Straits of Magellan was so full of them, that Captain Cook called it <HI>Shag Island.</HI> It is in these extremities

of the globe that nature, benumbed with cold, has allowed five or six species still to subsist, the last inhabitants of the territories invaded by the progress of refrigeration: they live in calm apa∣thy, the gloomy prelude of the eternal silence which soon will there establish its iron reign <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The gradual refrigeration of the earth is a favourite hypothesis of our ingenious author. He had supposed that a comet, reeling in its eccentric orbit, dashed against the sun, and struck off that ignit∣ed matter, which, gathering into globes and recovering from dis∣order, formed our planetary system. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made a great many ex∣periments with heated metallic balls of different diameters, to dis∣cover their rate of cooling: and in his Epochs of Nature, the most fanciful of all his works, he transferred these deductions to the globe of the earth; he poetically delineated its condition at the various stages of cooling; and he predicted the glacial crust, which, in pro∣cess of ages, will imprison old ocean.</P>
<P>But this account of the formation of the world is totally incon∣sistent with the established laws of motion; and even were it ad∣mitted, it would only remove the difficulty a single step; for how was the comet produced? The experiments with heated balls are inconclusive. Bodies have no natural tendency to cool, any more than to heat: they only maintain an equality of temperature with the surrounding matter. In ordinary cases, cooling is produced by the successive application of different portions of air to the hot surface. A body colder than the atmosphere would in the same manner be heated. In the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, the progress of heating or cooling is much slower; and could a perfect vacuum be obtained, there is every reason to think that a body would for ever retain the same temperature. The earth would therefore preserve perpetually its heat; and even though we should suppose it to be environed with a sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le aether (which is altogether improba∣ble) the communication of this heat to other planets or systems would be extremely slow and imperceptible. Nay, if there be any difference, the earth is growing warmer, by the incessant absorption of the sun's rays: yet so vast is its mass, that this effect will not much exceed a degree in a thousand years. History seems to corroborate this conjecture. Witness the ancient and modern state of Italy, a coun∣try which has remained nearly in the same state of cultivation.</P>
<P>With regard to the huge bones dug up in Siberia, and believed to be those of the elephant, which is a native of hot climates, they pro∣bably belong to some animal whose species is now extinct. Such at∣least was the decision of the celebrated Dr. Hunter, upon examining the bones found near the Ohio, in the back parts of North Ame∣rica. <HI>T.</HI></P></NOTE>.
<PB N="292" REF="323"/>
"One is astonished," says Captain Cook, <Q>“at the peace which prevails in this land. The animals that inhabit it would seem to have formed a league not to disturb their mutual tranquillity. The sea-lions occupy the greatest part of the coast; the white bears reside in the interior part of the island; and the Shags lodge in the loftiest rocks: the penguins settle where they have easiest communication with the sea; and the other birds chuse places more retired. We have seen all these animals in∣termingled and walking together, like cattle or poultry in a farm-yard, without offering the least injury to each other.”</Q></P>
<P>In these dreary wastes, naked, and almost frozen, the Shags breed in the ragged sides of rocks, or the projecting cliffs that overhang the ocean. In some parts, their nests are found among small patches▪ of flags, or in the tall tufts of the coarse grass which we have mentioned. There they inhabit, collected in thousands: the report of a musket does not disperse them; they only rise a few feet, and alight again into their nests. Nor need we use fire-arms, for they may
<PB N="293" REF="324"/>
be felled with sticks, and yet their companions will not be alarmed, or endeavour to escape from the massacre. Their flesh, especially that of the young ones, is pretty good food.</P>
<P>These birds do not stray far into the sea, and seldom lose sight of land. Like the penguins, they are clothed with a very thick plumage, well adapted to guard against the severe and continual cold of the frozen regions which they inhabit. Forster seems to admit several species or varieties of this bird; but as he does not suf∣ficiently distinguish them, and as the different mode of nestling on tufts or in the crevices of rocks is insufficient to discriminate the species, we shall describe only the common Shag known in our climates.</P>
<P>They are pretty numerous on the coast of Cornwal and in the Irish sea, particularly on the Isle of Man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>. They are found also on the shores of Prussia <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Klein.</NOTE>, and in Holland <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE> near Se∣venhuis, where they breed on tall trees. Wil∣lughby says, that they swim with their body entirely immersed, and only their head out of the water; and that they are as nimble and alert in that element as they are sluggish on land, and escape the shot by diving the instant they per∣ceive the flash. In general, the Shag has the same natural habits with those of the cormo∣rant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“To swallow a fish it tosses it into the air, and catches with its bill the head foremost. We have seen it perform this ma∣noeuvre with such address, that it never missed.”</Q> <HI>Ancient Me∣moires de l'Academie des Sciences, tom.</HI> iii. <HI>partie</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 214.</NOTE>,
<PB N="294" REF="325"/>
which it resembles in its figure and in its colours: the difference consists in this, that its body and limbs are smaller and more slender, its plumage brown under the body, its throat not naked, and that there are only twelve quills in the tail <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ray and Willughby.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some ornithologists have stiled the Shag the <HI>palmiped jay:</HI> but this is as little proper as the vulgar appellation of <HI>water raven</HI> given to the cormorant. The <HI>palmiped jays</HI> which Captain Wallis met with in the Pacific Ocean <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In latitude 20 degrees 50 minutes north.</NOTE> are probably a species of Shag; and to it we shall also refer the <HI>handsome cormorants</HI> of which Captain Cook saw large flocks nestled in small cavities, which these birds seemed to have wi∣dened for themselves in a rock of schist, whose broken sides terminate New Zealand.</P>
<P>The interior organization of the Shag pre∣sents many curious particulars, which we shall extract from the observations of the Academi∣cians. A bony ring embraces the <HI>trachea ar∣teria</HI> above the bifurcation: the <HI>pylorus</HI> is not inserted at the bottom of the stomach as usual, but opens into the middle of that ventricle, leaving one - half hanging below; and this lower part is very fleshy and muscular, so as to
<PB N="295" REF="326"/>
force up by its contraction the food to the ori∣fice of the <HI>pylorus:</HI> if we blow into the <HI>oeso∣phagus,</HI> it swells and appears a continuation of the stomach, which otherwise is separated from it by a narrow ring: the intestines are inclosed in an <HI>epiploon,</HI> well lined with fat, of the con∣sistence of tallow; this fact is an exception to what Pliny says in general of oviparous animals, that they have no epiploon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. ii. 37.</NOTE>. The shape of the kidnies is singular; they are not parted into three lobes, as in other birds, but jagged like a cock's comb on their convex portion, and di∣vided from the rest of the lower belly by a membrane which invests them: the <HI>cornea</HI> of the eye is of a bright red, and the crystalline ap∣proaches the spherical form, as in fish: the base of the bill is furnished with a red skin, which also surrounds the eye: the aperture of the nos∣trils is so narrow a slit as to have escaped ob∣servers, who have asserted, that the cormorants, both the greater and the lesser, want the nos∣trils: the greatest toe in these two species is the outer, composed of five <HI>phalanges,</HI> the next one containing three, the third three, and the last, which is the shortest, only two: the feet are of a shining black, and armed with pointed nails <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M. Perrault refutes seriously the fable of Gesner, who says, that there is a kind of cormorant which has a membranous foot, with which it swims, and another whose toes are naked, with which it seizes its prey.</NOTE>:

under the feathers there is a very fine down, as thick as that of the swan; small silky fea∣thers, close like velvet, cover the head; from which Perrault infers, that the cormorant is not the bald raven, <HI>phalacrocorax,</HI> of the ancients. But he ought to have qualified this assertion, having himself observed before, that on the sea∣shores there occurs a great cormorant different from the small cormorant or shag: and this bald-headed great cormorant is, as we have seen, the true <HI>phalacrocorax</HI> of the ancients. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Shag, <HI>Pelecanus-Graculus:</HI> <Q>“Its tail is rounded; its body black, below brown; it has twelve wing-quills.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The SEA SWALLOWS. LE HIRONDELLES DE MER. <HI>Buff.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF the multitude of names <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In German <HI>See Schwalbe:</HI> in Swedish, and the other northern languages, <HI>Taern, Terns, Stirn;</HI> whence Turner derives the name <HI>Sterna,</HI> adopted by nomenclators to distinguish this genus of birds.</NOTE> transferred for the most part improperly from the land animals to those of the sea, a few have been happily applied; such as that of the Swallow, given to a small family of piscivorous birds, which resemble our swallows by their long wings and forked tail, and by their continual circling on the surface of the water. As the land swallows flutter swiftly in the fields or round our dwellings in search of winged insects, so the Sea Swallows circle and glance rapidly on the liquid plains, and nimbly snatch the little fish which play on the surface. Such resem∣blance in the form and habits of these two kinds of birds might, in some measure, justify their receiving the same appellation: yet they differ essentially in the shape of their bill, and the structure of their feet. The Sea Swallows have small membranes shrunk between their
<PB N="298" REF="329"/>
toes, which are not adapted for swimming <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence Aldrovandus, looking upon the Sea Swallows as little gulls, distinguishes them by the name of cloven-footed gulls, <HI>lib.</HI> xix. 10. <HI>de laris fissipedibus.</HI></NOTE>; for nature seems to have bestowed on these birds only the power of their wings, which are extremely long, and scooped like those of the common swallows. They likewise glide and circle, sink and rise in the air, crossing and en∣twining their various irregular track in a thou∣sand directions <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>“Sailors call those nimble birds found at sea, <HI>croiseurs (crossers)</HI> when they are large; <HI>goelettes</HI> when they are small.”</Q> <HI>Remarks made by the Viscount de Querhoënt.</HI></NOTE>; their flight is impelled by starts of momentary caprice, and led by the sudden glimpse of their fugitive prey. They snatch the victim on wing, or alight only a moment to the surface; for they are averse to swim, though their half-webbed feet might con∣tribute to that purpose. They reside commonly on the sea-shores, and frequent also lakes and great rivers. The Sea Swallows, in flying, scream loud and shrill like the martins, espe∣cially when, in calm weather, they rise to a great height in the air, or when they congregate in summer to make distant excursions, but parti∣cularly in the breeding season, at which time they are more than ever restless and clamorous, perpetually redoubling their motions and their cries: and as they are always extremely nume∣rous, we can hardly, without being stunned with
<PB N="299" REF="330"/>
the noise, approach the shore, where they have disposed their eggs or collected their young. They arrive in flocks on our western coasts in the beginning of May <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observation made on those of Picardy, by M. Baillon.</NOTE>: most of them remain without quitting the beach; others advance farther, and following the rivers, seek the lakes and the large pools <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As that of Indre, near Dieuze in Lorraine, which, including its windings and inlets, is seven leagues in compass.</NOTE>. Every where they live on small fish, and sometimes they even snap winged insects in the air. The report of fire∣arms does not intimidate them, and this signal of danger, so far from driving them off, seems rather to attract them; for the instant the fowler hits one of a flock, the rest croud about their wounded companion, and drop with it to the surface of the water. The land swallows are likewise remarked to gather at the noise of a gun, or at least they are not frighted away. Does not this habit proceed from a blind secu∣rity? Birds that are hurried incessantly with a rapid flight, are more incautious than such as squat in the furrows or perch on the trees; they have not learnt, like these, to observe and dis∣tinguish us, and to fly from their most dange∣rous enemies.</P>
<P>The feet of the Sea Swallows differ not from those of the land swallows, except that they are semi-palmated; for in both they are very small
<PB N="300" REF="331"/>
and short, and unfit for walking. The pointed nails which arm the toes seem not more neces∣sary to the Sea Swallow than to the land one, since these birds equally seize the prey with the bill: that of the Sea Swallow is straight, ta∣pered to a point, smooth, not indented, and flat at the sides. The wings are so long, that the bird when at rest seems incumbered by them, and in the air appears all wing. But if this great power of flight makes the Sea Swallow an inhabitant of the air, it has other properties that distinguish it as an inhabitant of the water: for, besides the scalloped membrane between the toes, a small portion of the leg, as in almost all the aquatic birds, is bare, and the body is co∣vered with a thick and very close down.</P>
<P>This family of Sea Swallows includes a num∣ber of species, most of which have crossed the ocean, and stocked its shores.

They digest the fish as quickly almost as they catch it; the part which touches the bottom of the stomach dissolves first: the same effect is observed in herons and gulls. So great is the digestive power, that the Sea Swallow can, after the interval of an hour or two, make a second meal. They fight fre∣quently, quarrelling about their prey.

<P>These birds pair on their arrival about the first days of May. Each female drops in a small hole on the naked sand two or three eggs, very large in proportion to her bulk.

If a person approach the nests, the pa∣rents will rush precipitately from aloft, and flut∣ter round him with loud reiterated screams of anger and inquietude.</P>
<P>Their eggs are not all of the same colour, some being very brown, others gray, and others almost greenish: these last probably belong to young pairs; for they are rather smaller, and it is known that of all birds which have coloured eggs, those of old ones are d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eper stained, rather thicker, and less pointed than those of young ones, especially in their first layings.

<P>THIS Sea Swallow is named <HI>Guifette</HI> on the coast of Picardy. Its plumage, which is white under the body, is agreeably variegated with black behind the head, with brown clouded with rusty on the back, and with a handsome gray fringed with whitish on the wings. It is of a middle size between the two preceding, but differs in several particulars with regard to ha∣bits and oeconomy. Baillon, who compares it with the great sea-swallow, says, that it is dis∣tinguished by many characters: 1. It does not continually seek its food on the sea; it is not pis∣civorous, but rather insectivorous, feeding as much on flies and other insects, which it snaps in the air, as on those which it catches on the water: 2. It is not so clamorous as the great sea-swallow: 3. It does not lay on the naked sand, but chuses in the marshes a tuft of herbs
<PB N="309" REF="343"/>
or moss in some insulated hillock amidst the water or on its brink; it carries thither some dry stalks of herbs, and drops its eggs, which are generally three in number: 4. It covers assiduously seventeen days, and all the chicks burst the shell the same day.</P>
<P>The young cannot fly till after a month, and yet they retire early with their parents, and of∣ten before the greater terns. They are seen flying along the Seine and the Loire at the time of their passage. Their flight resembles that of the greater terns; they are even continually in the air: they fly oftener skimming the sur∣face of the water, and rise very high, and with great rapidity.</P>

Of more than six hundred nests, I saw only three that contained two chicks or two eggs: all the rest had only one.

In one part of the island, where a flock was settled, I found in all the nests the young bird already grown, and not a single egg. Next morning I light∣ed on another colony, where was only one egg on which incubation had begun, but no chick: this egg, which surprized me by its magnitude, is yellowish, with brown spots and other spots of pale violet, more crouded on the broad end.

The birds that we are now to survey, have received from nature only half that faculty: large and strong, armed with a firm bill, provided with long wings, and with feet completely and broadly palmated, they are fitted to exercise their powers both in the air and in the water, they are invited to act and to live; yet they seem ignorant what exer∣tions they should make, or what precautions they should observe, to escape that death which per∣petually threatens them. Though diffused from one end of the world to the other, from the seas of the north to those of the south, they have no where learnt to distinguish their most dangerous enemy: the sight of man does not intimidate or discompose them. They suffer themselves to

be taken, not only at sea on the ships' yards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These birds are called <HI>Boobies</HI> (fous) because of their great s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upidity, their silly aspect, and their habit of continually shaking the head and shivering when alighted on ships' yards, or other parts, where they suffer themselves to be taken by the hand. <HI>Feuillée.—</HI>If the Booby sees a ship, either in open sea or near land, it will com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to perch on the masts; and sometimes, if a person stretches out his hand, the bird will alight upon it. In my voyage to the islands, there was one which passed so often over my head, that I transfixed it with a half-pike. <HI>Dutertre.—</HI>These birds are not at all shy, either on land or at sea; they approach a vessel without seeming to fear any thing, when they chance to come in the way: the report of a fowling-piece, or any other noise, will not deter them. I have some∣times seen one of these solitary Boobies come to rove about the ship at evening, and to alight on the yards, where the sailors caught them without their shewing the smallest inclination to escape. <HI>Ob∣servations communicated by M. de la Borde, King's physician at Cayenne.</HI> See also Labat, <HI>Nouveau Voyage aux îles de l'Amcrique: Paris, 1722, tom.</HI> vi. <HI>p.</HI> 481.

As the mental powers and the moral quali∣ties of animals are derived from their constitu∣tion, we must attribute the excessive sluggishness and helpless security of the Boobies to some phy∣sical cause; and this, most probably, is the diffi∣culty of putting their long wings in motion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We shall see that the frigat itself, notwithstanding its vigorous wing, has the same difficulty in taking its flight.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But man is not their only foe; their want of courage exposes them to another enemy, which perpetually harrasses them. This is the frigat, or man-of-war bird. It rushes upon the Boo∣bies which it descries, pursues them without in∣termission, and obliges them, by blows with its wings and its bill, to surrender their prey, which it instantly seizes and swallows <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I had the pleasure to see the frigats give chase to the Boobies: when they retire in bodies at evening from the labours of the day, the frigats watch their return, and, rushing on, oblige them to scream for assistance, and to disgorge some fish, which they carry to their young. <HI>Feuillee.—</HI>The Boobies repair at night to repose on the island of Rodrigue, and the frigats, which are large birds, and so called because of the rapidity of their flight, wait for them every evening on the tops of the trees; they rise very high, and dart down upon them like a hawk upon his prey, not to kill them, but to make them disgorge; the Booby, struck in this way by the fri∣gat, throws up a fish, which the latter snatches in the air: often the Booby screams, and discovers a reluctance to part with its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>; but the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igat scorns its cries, and, rising again, comes down with such a blow as to stun the poor bird, and compel an immediate surrender. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guat.</HI></NOTE>: for the silly,

As soon as the pirate perceives that it has caught a fish, he flies furiously against it, and obliges it to dive under wa∣ter for safety; the pirate not being able to follow it, hovers above the water till the Booby is obliged to emerge for respiration, and then attacks it again while spent and breathless, and compels it to surrender its fish; it now returns to its labours, and has to suf∣fer fresh attacks from its indefatigable enemy.”</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Boobies hover above the surface of the water, scarce moving their wings, and drop on the fish the instant it emerges <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>. Their flight, though rapid and well supported, is greatly in∣ferior to that of the frigat. Accordingly, they do not roam so far, and their appearance is re∣garded by navigators as a pretty certain sign of the nearness of some land <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Boobies do not go very far to sea, and seldom lose sight of land. <HI>Forster.—</HI>A few days after our departure from Java, we saw Boobies about the ship for several nights together; and as these birds go to roost on land in the evening, we conjectured that there was some island near us; perhaps it was the island of Selam, whose name and position are very differently marked on the charts. <HI>Cook.—</HI>Our latitude was 24° 28′ (on the 21st May 1770, near New Holland); we had found on the preceding days several sea birds, called Boobies, but we had not that sight to-day. On the night of the 21st, there passed near the ship a small flock flying to the north-west; and in the morning, from an hour before sun-rise to half an hour after, there were continual flights that came from the north north-west, and disappeared toward the south south-east; we saw none thattook another direction, which led us to suppose, that at the bottom of a deep bay lying south of us, there was a lagoon, or shallow ri∣ver, whither these birds repaired to seek their food during the day, and that on the north of us there was situated some island to which they retired. <HI>Cook.—Note,</HI> We must confess that some voyagers, and among others Father Feuillée, say that Boobies are found seve∣ral hundred leagues at sea; and that Captain Cook himself seems to reckon them, at least in certain circumstances, as more certain to∣kens of the proximity of land than the frigats, with which he classes them in the following passage. <Q>“The weather was pleasant, and every day we saw some of the birds which are esteemed to be signs of nearness of land, such as Boobies, frigats, tropic birds, and gulls. We believed that they came from the island of St. Matthew or Ascension, which we had left pretty near us.”</Q></NOTE>. Yet several of
<PB N="330" REF="365"/>
these birds frequent our northern coasts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the article of the Gannet.</NOTE>, and occur in the remotest and most sequestered islands in the midst of the ocean <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At Rodrigue, <HI>Leguat:</HI> at Ascension, <HI>Cook:</HI> at the Calamiane islands, and at Timor, <HI>Gemelli Careri:</HI> at Sabuda in New Guinea, and at New Holland, <HI>Dampier:</HI> in all the islands scattered under the southern tropic, <HI>Forster:</HI> in the Great Antilles, <HI>Feuillée, Labat, Dutertre,</HI> &amp;c.: in the Bay of Campeachy, <HI>Dampier.</HI></NOTE>. There they live in companies, with the gulls, the tropic birds, &amp;c. and the frigat, their inveterate foe, has fol∣lowed them to their retreats.</P>
<P>Dampier gives a curious account of the hosti∣lities between the man-of-war birds and the Boobies, in the Alcrane islands, on the coast of Yucatan. <Q>“These birds were crowded so thick that I could not,”</Q> he says, <Q>“pass their haunt without being incommoded by their pecking. I observed that they were ranged in pairs, which made me presume that they were male and female. When I struck them, some flew
<PB N="331" REF="366"/>
away, but the greater number remained, and would not stir for all I could do to rouze them. I remarked also, that the man-of-war birds and the Boobies always placed sentinels over their young, especially when they went to sea for provision. Of the man-of-war birds, many were sick or maimed, and seemed unfit to procure their subsistence. They lived not with the rest of their kind, whether they were expelled from the society, or had sepa∣rated from choice: these were dispersed in different places, probably that they might have a better opportunity of pillaging. I once saw more than twenty on one of the islands sally out from time to time into the open country, to carry off booty, and they returned again almost immediately. When one sur∣prized a young Booby that had no guard, he gave it a violent peck on the back to make it disgorge, which it did instantly: it cast up one or two fish about the bulk of one's hand, which the old man-of-war bird swallowed still more hastily. The vigorous ones play the same game with the old Boobies which they find at sea. I saw one myself which flew right against a Booby, and with one stroke of its bill, made him deliver up a fish which he had just swallowed. The man-of-war bird darted so rapidly as to catch it in the air before it could fall into the water.”</Q></P>
<P>The Boobies resemble most the cormorants in
<PB N="332" REF="367"/>
their shape and organization, except that their bill is not terminated in a hook, but in a point slightly curved: they differ also, because their tail projects not beyond their wings. They have their toes connected by a single piece of membrane; the nail of the mid-one is serrated on the inside: their eyes are encircled by a na∣ked skin; their bill is straight, conical, and some∣what hooked at the end, and the sides are finely indented; the nostrils are not apparent, and their place is occupied only by two hollow channels. But the most remarkable property of the bill is, that the upper mandible is articulated, as it were, and formed of three pieces joined by two futures; the first is traced near the point, which therefore appears like a detached nail; the second is situated at the root of the bill near the head, which enables the bird to raise the tip of its upper mandible two inches, without opening the bill <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“What is most remarkable in these birds, the upper mandible, two inches below the mouth, is jointed in such manner that it can rise two inches above the lower mandible, without the bill being opened.”</Q> <HI>Catesby.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>These birds utter a loud cry, partaking of that of the raven and of the goose; and this is heard particularly when they are pursued by the fri∣gat, or when, assembled together, they are seized by some sudden panic <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“We had been hunting goats at night (in the island of As∣cension); the reports of the piece which we fired had fright∣ened the Boobies in the neighbourhood: they all screamed toge∣ther, and the rest replied at short distances, which made a hideous din.” <HI>Note communicated by the Viscount de Quer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oënt.</HI></Q></P></NOTE>.

Dam∣pier remarks, that in the isle of Aves they breed on trees, though in other places they nestle on the ground, and always a number in the same haunt; for a community, not of instinct but of weakness, seems to collect them together.

<P>THIS bird, which seems to be most common in the Antilles, is of a middle size be∣tween the duck and the goose: its length, from the end of the bill to that of the tail, is two feet five inches, and a foot eleven inches to the extremities of the nails: its bill is four inches

<P>Simple as this garb is, it is insufficient, as Catesby observes, to characterize the species, so many are the individual varieties which it contains. <Q>"I observed," says he, “one that had a white belly and a brown back; another, whose breast and belly were white, and others which were entirely brown.”</Q> Some travellers seem to denominate this species the <HI>fulvous bird</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The birds which the French in the Antilles call <HI>fauves,</HI> because of the colour of their back, are white under the belly; they are of the bulk of a water hen, but are usually so lean that their plumage is the only part of them the least valuable: they have the feet of ducks, and the pointed bill of woodcocks; they live on small fish, like the fri∣gats, but they are the most stupid of the birds, either at sea or on land, in the Antilles; since, whether that they easily tire on wing, or that they take the ships for floating rocks, as soon as they per∣ceive one, especially if towards night, they immediately come to alight upon it, and are so silly as to suffer themselves to be taken by the hand. <HI>Histoire Naturelle &amp; Morale des Antilles; Rotterdam,</HI> 1658; <HI>p.</HI> 148.</NOTE>. The flesh is black, and has a marshy flavour; yet the sailors and adventurers of the Antilles often fed on it.

<P>WE have remarked, that there is much di∣versity of white and brown in the pre∣ceding species, yet we cannot class this with it; the more so as Dutertre, who saw both alive, distinguished them from one another. They are indeed very different, since what is white in the one is brown in the other; viz. the back, the neck, and the head, which is besides rather smaller. It appears also to be less stupid; it sel∣dom perches on trees, and still less does it suffer itself to be caught on the ships' yards; yet it inhabits the same places with the pre∣ceding, and both are found on the island of Ascension. <Q>"There are," says the Viscount de Querhoënt, “in this island, thousands of common Boobies; the white are less numerous; both kinds are seen perched upon heaps of stones, ge∣nerally in pairs. They are found at all hours, and will never stir till hunger obliges them to fish. Their general resort is on the windward side of the

<P>THIS bird is the largest of its genus, being equal to the goose, and its wings measur∣ing six feet across: its plumage is deep brown, sprinkled with small white spots on the head, with broader ones on the breast, and with others still broader on the back; the belly is dirty white.

<P>An individual of this species was taken in the neighbourhood of the city of Eu, on the 18th of October, 1772. No doubt it had been sur∣prized far at sea by rough weather, and driven by the violence of the wind upon our coasts. The person who found it had only to throw his coat over it: it was kept some time; at first it would not stoop to take a fish, but required it to be held as high as its bill. It sat always squat, and was averse to motion; but after be∣ing accustomed to live on land, it walked and became familiar; it even importunately followed its master, making at intervals a shrill raucous cry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extract of a letter from the Abbe Vincent, professor in the college of the city of Eu, inserted in the <HI>Journal de Physique</HI> for June, 1773.</NOTE>.</P>

Perhaps, if their migra∣tions were well known, it would be found, that they join the other species of boobies on the coasts of Florida; the general rendezvous of all the birds which descend from the boreal regions, and have vigour of wing sufficient to traverse the Atlantic ocean. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the Gannet, <HI>Pelecanus Bassanus:</HI> <Q>“Its tail is wedge-shaped; its body white; its bill, its primary wing-quills black; its face blue.”</Q> It has a small dilatable pouch un∣der its chin, able to contain five or six herrings, which, in the breeding season, it carries to its family. Its legs and toes are black, with a stripe of fine velvet green on the fore part: the tail contains twelve sharp taper quills. The egg is white, and rather smaller than that of a common goose: if it be removed, the bird will lay another; and if this be equally unfortunate, she will even lay a third. The nest is large, and composed of substances that float on the water, as sea-weeds, fog, shavings, &amp;c. It is very proba∣ble, that the Gannets attend the progress of the herrings; the fish∣ermen reckon them a sure sign of the approach of the shoal. In December, these birds are frequently seen near Lisbon, diving for sardines, a kind of pilchards. They descend from a vast height, and plunge many fathoms under water. In Scotland they are usually called <HI>Solan-geese;</HI> in Cornwall and Ireland <HI>Gannets;</HI> and in Wales <HI>Gan.</HI> The inhabitants of St. Kilda, we are assured by Mar∣tin, take often 22,600 of the young birds annually, besides a pro∣digious number of eggs. These spoils are the chief subsistance of these hardy islanders, and they store up their provisions in pyra∣midal stone buildings, covering them over with peat-ashes. The Craig of Ailsa resembles much in appearance the Bass-isle: of the latter, we have an elegant description, by the immortal discoverer of the circulation of the blood, Dr. Harvey.</P>
<P>I shall take the liberty of subjoining a translation of it: <Q>“There is a small island which the Scotch call the <HI>Bass,</HI> not above a mile in circuit. In the months of June and July, the surface of this island is so strewed with nests, and eggs, and young birds, that a person can hardly set his foot without treading on them. And so vast is the multitude of those which fly over head, that like clouds, they darken the sun and the sky; and such is their clangorous noise, that you can scarce hear the voice of your companions. If from the summit of the lofty precipice, you look towards the sea which spreads below, you will perceive, wherever you turn your eyes, birds innumerable of various kinds, swimming and hunting for their prey. If sailing round, you survey the im∣pending cliff, you will see in every crag and fissure of the indent∣ed rock, birds of all sorts and sizes, which would out-number the stars that appear in a clear night. If from a distance you be∣hold the flocks roving about the island, you would imagine them to be a vast swarm of bees.”</Q>—<HI>De Generat.

<P>THE steadiness and rapidity with which this bird moves through the air, have procured it the name of <HI>Frigat.</HI> It surpasses all the winged sailors in the boldness, the vigour, and the extent of its flight; poised on wings of prodigious length, which support it without perceptible motion, it swims gently through the tranquil air, waiting to dart on its prey with the rapidity of a flash: but if the atmosphere is embroiled with tempests, the Frigat, nimble as the wind, ascends above the clouds, and stretches beyond the region of storms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>.

The hostilities which he commits
<PB N="349" REF="386"/>
have led sailors to bestow on him the appella∣tion of <HI>Man-of-War bird</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dampier.</NOTE>. He has the au∣dacity even to set man at defiance; <Q>“On land∣ing at the island of Ascension,”</Q> says the Vis∣count de Querhoënt, <Q>“we were surrounded by a cloud of Frigats. With a blow of my cane I knocked down one, which attempted to snatch a fish out of my hand: at the same time many of them flew a few feet above the kettle which was boiling ashore, and endea∣voured to carry off the flesh, though a part of the ship's company attended it.”</Q></P>
<P>This temerity of the Frigat proceeds as much from the force of its arms, and the boldness of its flight, as from its voracity. It is fitted by nature for war: its talons are sharp, its bill ter∣minates in a very pointed hook, its legs are short and strong, its flight is rapid, its sight acute: all these qualities seem to mark an analogy to the eagle, and to constitute it the tyrant of the air at sea <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hence, in the Linnaean system, the Frigat is denominated <HI>Pe∣lecanus Aquilus,</HI> or Eagle Pelican.</NOTE>. But its structure is calculated for the watery element, and, though it seldom or never swims, its four toes are connected by a single scalloped membrane. In this respect, it ap∣proaches
<PB N="350" REF="387"/>
the cormorants, the boobies, and the pelicans, which may be regarded as perfect pal∣mipeds. The bill of the Frigat is peculiarly calculated for rapine, since it terminates in a sharp hooked tip, and yet differs essentially from that of the birds of prey, being very long, the upper mandible somewhat concave, and the hook, placed quite at the point, seems to form a detached piece, as in the bill of the boobies, which it resembles by its sutures and by the want of external nostrils.</P>
<P>The Frigat is not larger than a hen, but its wings extend eight, ten, and even fourteen feet. This prodigious expansion enables it to perform its distant excursions, and transports it into the midst of the ocean, where it is often the only object between the sky and the water that gra∣tifies the longing eyes of the mariner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“We were accompanied with no bird in our route; a white booby or a Frigat appeared now and then at a great distance (between 15° and 20° south latitude).”</Q> <HI>Cook.</HI></NOTE>; but this excessive length of wings has also its in∣convenience; and, like the booby, the Frigat can hardly rise after it has alighted, so that when surprized in that situation it may be felled to the ground <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>“I went one of these last days to hunt Frigats on their islet at the extremity of Guadaloupe; we were three or four persons, and in less than two hours we took three or four hundred; we sur∣prized the grown ones on the branches, or in their nest, and as they had great difficulty in taking wing, we had time to stun them with the blows of sticks." <HI>Dutertre.—"</HI>They leave their eggs with diffi∣culty, and suffer themselves to be knocked down with sticks: I have often been witness and actor of this butchery.”</Q> <HI>M. de la Borde.</HI></NOTE>. A cliff or the summit of a
<PB N="351" REF="388"/>
tree is required, and even then it costs great effort to mount on wing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dutertre.</NOTE>. We may suppose that all the palmated birds which perch have no object in view but to commence more easily their flight; for that habit is not suited to the structure of their feet, and it is only on elevated points that they can display their enormous wings and exert their pinions.</P>
<P>Hence the Frigats retire to settle on the high cliffs or woody islets, to breed undisturbed <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The sea rocks, and the little desert isles, are the retreats of these birds; and in such sequestered spots they nestle.”</Q> <HI>Hist.

It was called the <HI>islet of Frigats,</HI> and still bears that name, though they have changed their retreat; for in the years 1643 and 1644, many persons hunted them so closely, that they were obliged to forsake the islet.”</Q> <HI>Dutertre.</HI></NOTE>. Dampier remarks, that they build their nests on trees, in sequestered spots near the sea; they lay one or two eggs, which are white, with a carnation tinge, and having small dots of crim∣son. The young ones are at first covered with a light gray down; their feet are of the same colour, and their bill is almost white <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Observation made by the Viscount de Querhoënt at the island of Ascension.</NOTE>: but this colour afterwards changes, and the bill grows
<PB N="352" REF="389"/>
red or black, and bluish in the middle; the same alteration takes place in the toes. The head is pretty large, and flat above; the eyes are large, black and brilliant, and encircled by a bluish skin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Feuilléé.</NOTE>. Under the throat of the adult male, there is a large fleshy membrane of bright red, more or less inflated or pendulous. No person has distinctly described these parts; but if they belonged exclusively to the male, they might bear some analogy to the caruncle of the turkey-cock, which swells and reddens, when the bird is stimulated by love or rage.</P>
<P>The Frigats are distinguished afar at sea, not only by the excessive length of their wings, but by the very forked shape of their tail <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Portuguese call the Frigat <HI>Rabo Forcado,</HI> on account of its very forked tail.</NOTE>.

<P>THESE two names, sometimes conjoined, sometimes separated, have hitherto served ra∣ther to confound than to discriminate the species comprehended in one of the most numerous families of the aquatic birds.

Nay, we may discover vestiges of the same division among the Greeks; for the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which occurs in Aristotle, Aratus, and other authors, seems to denote a particular kind of Gulls.

But if the <HI>fulica</HI> of the ancients be the same with our coot, the property ascribed to it by the Roman poet, of playing on the beach previous to a storm <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—<HI>cumque marinae</HI></L>
<L><HI>In sicco ludunt fulicae—</HI>Virg. <HI>Georg.</HI> i. 362.</L></Q></NOTE>, would be without foundation <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The epithet which Cicero gives to the coot, in translating the same idea of Aratus, applies not to that bird, but agrees well with the gull:
<Q><L>Cana fulix itidem fugiens è gurgite ponti,</L>
<L>Nuntiat horribiles clamans instare procellas.</L></Q></NOTE>, since that bird does not live on the sea. The character which Aristotle gives of his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that it swallows the salt spume, and is caught by that bait, can apply only to a vora∣cious bird, such as the Gull or the Mew. Al∣drovandus accordingly concludes, after compar∣ing these circumstances, that the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Aristotle is <HI>generic,</HI> and that the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is specific, or ra∣ther belongs to some subordinate species of the same genus. But a remark which Turner has made on the voice of these birds, seems to throw us again into uncertainty: he conceives that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is imitative of that of the Mew, which usually concludes its shrill cries by a low, short accent, or a sort of sneezing, <HI>keph;</HI> while
<PB N="356" REF="393"/>
the gull terminates its scream by a deeper tone, <HI>cob.</HI></P>
<P>The Greek name <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> will correspond then, in our division, to the Latin <HI>gavia,</HI> and will pro∣perly denote the inferior species, or <HI>the Mews:</HI> while the appellation <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>larus,</HI> will signify the larger species, or <HI>the Gulls.</HI> And to fix a term of comparison in this scale of magnitude, we shall reckon all those birds <HI>Gulls,</HI> which ex∣ceed a duck in bulk, and measure eighteen or twenty inches from the point of the bill to the end of the tail; and all under that dimension we shall denominate <HI>Mews.</HI> It would thence follow, that the sixth species, which Brisson calls the <HI>first Mew,</HI> ought to be ranged with the Gulls, and that many of the Gulls in the Linnaean system must be class<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with the Mews: but before we descend into the detail, we shall exhibit the general characters and habits common to the whole genus.</P>
<P>All the Gulls and Mews are alike voracious and clamorous; they might be styled the vul∣tures of the sea; they devour carrion of every kind which floats on the surface, or is cast on shore. As cowardly as they are gluttonous, they attack only weak animals, and vent their fury on dead bodies. Their ignoble port, their importu∣nate cries, their edged and hooked bill, present the hateful picture of birds sanguinary and basely cruel. They fight rancorously together on the scene of carnage; and even when they
<PB N="357" REF="394"/>
are shut up, and their ferocious humour is soured by captivity, they wound each other without apparent motive, and the first from which blood is drawn falls a victim to the rest; for their fury then rises to a pitch, and they tear in pieces the wretch which they had wounded without cause <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observation made by M. Baillon, of Montreuil-sur-mer.</NOTE>. This excess of cruelty is scarce seen but in the large species; but all of them, when at liberty, continually watch an opportunity to steal the food or prey of their companions. Every thing is acceptable to their voracity <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>“I have often given my Mews buzzards, ravens, new-born kittens, rabbits, and other dead animals; they devoured them as greedily as they would do fish: I have still two which can easily swallow stares and sea-larks without plucking a feather; their throat is a gulph which devours every thing.”</Q> <HI>Note communi∣cated by M.

They swallow the bait and the hook; they dart with such violence as to transfix them∣selves on the point where the fisherman places the herring or pilcher as a snare. Nor is this the only way to allure them; Oppian asserts, that if a board be painted with figures of fish, these birds will dash against it.—But ought not
<PB N="358" REF="395"/>
these portraits to be as perfect as those of the grapes by Parrhasius?</P>
<P>Both the Gulls and the Mews have a long cutting bill, flat on the sides, with the point fortified and bent into a hook, and a protuberant corner at the lower mandible. These characters are more apparent and decided in the Gulls, but yet occur in all the species of Mews: by these they are distinguished also from the terns, which have neither the hook on the upper mandible, nor the protuberance on the lower; not to men∣tion that the largest of the terns is inferior to the least of the Mews. The Mews have their tail not forked but entire: their leg, or rather their tarsus, is very high; and they would have the tallest legs of all the palmated birds, did not those of the flamingo, the avoset, and the long-shank still exceed them, whose structure is so misproportioned that they might be regarded as monstrous species. All the Gulls and Mews have three toes connected by an entire mem∣brane, and the hind toe detached, but very small: their head is large, and its carriage ungraceful, being sunk almost between the shoulders, whe∣ther they walk or repose. They run swiftly on the beach, and fly still better above the waves: their long wings, which when closed exceed the tail, and the quantity of feathers with which their body is clothed, make them very light <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have a proverb, <HI>You are as light as a Mew.</HI> Martens.</NOTE>.
<PB N="359" REF="396"/>
They have also a very thick down <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus says, that in Holland the down of the Mew is much used; but it would be hard to believe what he adds, that this down heaves up at full moon, by a sympathetic concord with the swelling of the tide.</NOTE>, which is of a bluish colour, especially on the stomach. They are hatched with that down, but the other fea∣thers are late in growing; and they acquire not completely their colours, to wit, the fine white of the body, and the black or bluish gray on the mantle, till after several moultings, and in their third year. Oppian seems to have known this progress of their colours; for he says that these birds, as they grow old, become blue.</P>
<P>They keep in flocks on the sea-shores; some running, some flying, and others alighting; the beach and the downs seem quickened by their numbers and their confused motions, and resound incessantly with their noisy cries. In general, no birds are more common on our coasts, and they are found an hundred leagues at sea. They frequent the islands and maritime countries of every climate. Navigators meet with them in all parts of the globe <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Gulls are as common in Japan as in Europe. <HI>Kaempfer.—</HI>There are different kinds of them at the Cape of Good Hope, whose cry is like that of the European Gulls. <HI>The Viscount de Querhoënt.—</HI>As long as we were on this bank, which extends as far as Cape Needles (off Madagascar) we saw Gulls. <HI>Cook:—</HI>he also saw Gulls at Cape Froward, in the Straits of Magellan; at New Holland; at New Zealand; near Statenland; in all the low islands of the south∣ern Archipelago; and many of the natives of Easter Island wore a wooden hoop decked with the white feathers of Gulls, which waved in the air.—Clouds of Gulls produce in a great measure the dung which covers the island of Iquique, and which is carried, under the name of <HI>guana,</HI> into the valley of Arica. <HI>Le Gentil.—</HI>The Gull of Louisiana is like that of France. <HI>Dupratz.—</HI>A number of Gulls and other birds came (at the Malouine islands) to hover on the water, and darted upon the fish with extreme swiftness; they led us to discover the proper season for catching sardines; if held a mo∣ment suspended, they threw up that fish entire as it was just swal∣lowed: these birds lay round the pools, on green plants like the wa∣ter-lily, a great number of excellent wholesome eggs. <HI>Bougain∣ville.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>The same observation holds with respect to France; for many species of this bird are seen on our coasts, both in summer and in winter: on the western shores they are called <HI>mauves,</HI> or <HI>miaules,</HI> and on the southern <HI>gabians.</HI> Every where they are noted for their voracity and their disagreeable importunate cries.

When they purpose to eat, they re∣move this crust, then half open the bird. I know not how they preserve the carcase from corruption, for I have seen some that had been roasted eight days before, which is the more surpriz∣ing, as in twelve hours most kinds of flesh in those countries run into putrefaction.”</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Curious to observe by ourselves the habits of these birds, we sought to procure some alive; and M. Baillon, who is ever ready to oblige us, sent a large Gull with a black mantle of the first species, and a gray-mantled Gull of the second species. We have kept them fifteen months in a garden, where we could observe them at all times. They showed at first evident signs of their malevolent temper, pursuing each other continually, the large one never permitting the small one to eat beside him. They lived on soaked bread, the guts of game and of poultry, and other offals from the kitchen, none of which they ever refused. They also gathered worms and snails in the garden, and could easily sepa∣rate the shells. They often went to bathe in a
<PB N="363" REF="400"/>
small bason, and on coming out of the water they shook themselves, clapped their wings, and then preened their plumage, like the geese and ducks. They roved at night, and were often seen walking out at ten or eleven o'clock. They do not, like most other birds, conceal their head under their wing when they sleep; they only turn it behind, resting the bill between the upper side of the wing and the back.</P>
<P>When a person tried to catch these birds, they bit and pecked with rancour: to master them without suffering injury, it was necessary to throw an handkerchief over their head. If one pursued them, they quickened their pace by spreading their wings. Usually they walked slowly and ungracefully. Their sloth was be∣trayed even in their rage; for when the largest pursued the other, he walked leisurely, without seeming to care whether he should overtake it; nor did the other show any anxiety to escape, and when it reckoned itself to be at a sufficient distance, it stopped; and it repeated this exer∣tion as often as it was pressed, so as to keep al∣ways beyond its enemy's reach, as if remoteness was sufficient to destroy the antipathy.—Must not thus the weak ever retire for safety before the strong? But unfortunately tyranny, in the hands of man, is an engine which extends as far as his thought!</P>
<P>These birds appeared the whole winter to
<PB N="364" REF="401"/>
forget the use of their wings. They discovered no inclination to fly away: they were indeed well fed, and their gluttonous appetite could not torment them. But in the spring they felt new appetites, and showed other desires; they en∣deavoured to rise into the air, and would have escaped, had not several inches been clipt from their wings: they could therefore only spring by jerks, or whirl on their feet with their wings expanded. The passion of love, which wakens with the season, seemed to suppress the instinct of antipathy, and destroy their mutual enmity: for they seemed to fondle each other, and though they did not consort, being of different species, they ate, slept, and rested together. But their plaintive cries and restless motions, suffi∣ciently declared, that the sweetest sentiment of nature was provoked, not satisfied.</P>

<P>THIS Gull has its plumage of an uniform dusky brown over the whole body, except the belly, which is striped across with brown on a gray ground, and the great quills of the wing, which are black. It is somewhat smaller than the preceding, its length from the bill to the extremity of the tail being only a foot and eight inches, and an inch less to the nails, which are sharp and stout. Ray observes, that the whole habit of the body of this bird bespeaks rapine and carnage; and such indeed is the base and cruel aspect of all the sanguinary tribes of gulls. It is to this species that naturalists have gene∣rally referred the <HI>Catarractes</HI> of Aristotle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist.

with what Willughby reports of the great gull, that it dashes its head against the board on which the fishermen fix the bait.

familiarity of a voracioús animal, which hunger only attaches to the hand that feeds it. It swallowed flat fish almost as broad as its body; and with equal avidity it devoured raw flesh, and even small animals entire, such as moles, rats, and birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whence probably the fable of Oviedo <HI>(Hist. Ind. Occid.</HI> lib. xiv. 18.) has been applied to the Grisard, of a bird which has one foot webbed for swimming, and the other armed with talons for seizing its prey.</NOTE>. A gull of this kind, which Anderson received from Greenland, attacked small animals, and fiercely defended itself with its bill against dogs and cats, and took pleasure in biting their tails. On showing it a white handkerchief, it was sure to scream with a piercing tone, as if that recalled to its memory some foe which it dreaded at sea.</P>
<P>All the Grisards are, according to the obser∣vations of M. Baillon, of a dirty and dark gray when young; but after the first moult the tint grows more dilute, the belly and the neck whiten first, and, in three moults, the plumage is entirely waved and freckled with gray and white, such as we have described it. The white afterwards continues to gain ground, and the aged birds are entirely hoary. If the plu∣mage, therefore, were the sole foundation of distinction, we should admit an unnecessary number of species, since nature varies to such degree the colours with the years.</P>

<P>Belon perceived some analogy between the head of the Variegated Gull and that of the eagle: but, in its sordid groveling habits, it much more resembles the vultures. Its stout, hardy constitution renders it capable of bearing the most inclement weather; and mariners have remarked, that it cares little for storms at sea. It is well clothed with feathers, which seem to form the chief part of the bulk of its very lean body. But we are not certain if all these birds be constantly lean; for the one which we chanced to see, had a hook sticking in its palate, and grown over with callous flesh, which must have hindered it from swallowing easily.</P>
<P>According to Anderson, it has an air-bag un∣der its skin, like that of the pelican <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He adds some anatomical details: <Q>“Each lobe of the lungs is formed like a separate lung in shape of a purse; the crystalline of the eye is spherical like that of fishes; the heart has only one chamber; the bill is perforated with four nostrils, two disclosed, and two concealed under the feathers at the root of the bill.”</Q> <HI>Hist.

Martens, <Q>“they flock about it, and steal large pieces of the blubber.

<P>IT is probable that this Gull, described by Father Feuillée, and which is nearly as large as the gray-mantled Gull, is only a shade or va∣riety of that species, or of some of the preced∣ing, at a certain age. Its figure and structure seem to lead to that inference. Its mantle, says the Jesuit, is gray mixed with white, and so is the upper surface of the neck, of which the fore side is light gray, and all its <HI>livery:</HI> the quills of the tail are dull red lead colour, and the top of the head is gray. He adds, as a singular property, that the inner toe has only two joints, the middle one three, and the outer four, which is therefore the longest; but this structure, the most favourable for swimming, since the broadest part of the sole has thus the greatest compass of motion, occurs in a great number of aquatic birds, and even among the waders.

<P>FROM what we have said of the wagels, which whiten with age, we might suppose that this is only an old one; but it is much smaller than that gull; its bill is neither so large, nor so strong, and its plumage is pur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> white, without any tinge or spot of gray. It exceeds not fifteen inches from the end of the bill to that of the tail. It is described in Cap∣tain Phipps's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The whole bird is snowy and spotless; its bill lead-coloured; its orbits saffron, ash-leaden; its nails black; its hind-toe jointed and nailed; its wings longer than its tail; its tail equal, and longer than its feet. The whole length of the bird, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail, is sixteen inches; the distance between the tips of the spread wings, thirty-seven inches; the bill two inches.”</Q></NOTE> voyage to the north: he observes very properly, that this species has not been de∣lineated in the Linnaean fystem, and that the bird called <HI>raths-herr,</HI> or senator, by Martens, perfectly resembles it, except in the feet, to which Martens attributes only three toes. But if we suppose the fourth toe, which is very mi∣nute,
<PB N="381" REF="420"/>
to have escaped the observation of that na∣vigator, it would exactly correspond to his <HI>raths-herr.</HI> Its whiteness surpasses that of snow; and the stately pace of the bird on the ice has pro∣cured it the appellation of <HI>raths-herr,</HI> or senator. Its voice is low and strong; and whereas the little mews or <HI>kirmews</HI> seem to call <HI>kir</HI> or <HI>kair,</HI> the Senator sounds <HI>kar.</HI> It is usually solitary, unless some prey collects a certain number of them. Martens saw them alight on the carcases of sea∣horses, and devour their dung. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Larus Eburneus:</HI> <Q>“It is all white, its orbits saffron, its bill and feet lead-coloured.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<P><Q>“WHILE we were cutting up the whale-blubber,”</Q> says Martens, <Q>“a number of these birds came screaming about our ship,

This bird exceeds not in bulk the white mew; it is only fifteen inches long: the plumage consists of a fine white ground on the fore side of the body, and gray on the mantle, marked with some streaks of the same gray that form a kind of half-collar on the upper side of the neck; it is distinguished also by spots of white and black mixed on the coverts of the wing, with varieties, however, which we shall mention. The hind toe, which is very small in all the mews, is scarce perceptible in this one, as Belon and Ray observe. And hence Martens says, that it has only three toes: he adds, that it always flies rapidly against the wind, however violent this blows; but that it is perpetually pursued and harrassed by the bird <HI>strundt-jager</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">i. e. <HI>Dung-hunter.</HI></NOTE>, and constrained to void its excrements, which the latter greedily swallows. In a subsequent article <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the article of the <HI>Dung-bird.</HI></NOTE>, we shall find that this depraved taste has been erroneously imputed to the <HI>strundt∣jager.</HI></P>
<P>This Spotted Mew occurs not only in the seas of the north, it also inhabits the coasts of Eng∣land <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE> and Scotland <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Sibbald.</NOTE>. Belon, who met with it
<PB N="383" REF="422"/>
in Greece, says, that he recognized it merely from the name <HI>laros,</HI> which it still bears in that country: and Martens, after having observed it at Spitzbergen, found it again in the Spanish seas, somewhat different, indeed, yet still distin∣guishable; whence he very judiciously infers, that animals of the same species in distant coun∣tries must ever receive impressions from the cli∣mates. So great is the difference in the present case, that this species has been split into two: the <HI>cinereous mew</HI> of Brisson, and his <HI>cinereous spotted mew,</HI> are unquestionably the same, as a comparison of the figures will evince. And what completely establishes our position, is a series of subjects, which exhibits a gradual pro∣gress of the black and white of the wing, from the mottled colours to the simple gray. The gray half-collar on the top of the neck is com∣mon to all the individuals of this species.</P>
<P>Flocks of these Mews appeared suddenly near Semur in Auxois, in the month of February 1775. They were very easily killed▪ and were found dead or half-starved with hunger in the mea∣dows, the fields, and the brinks of rivulets. On opening them, their stomach was found to con∣tain some fragments of fishes, and their intes∣tines a blackish jelly. These birds were not known in the country; their appearance lasted only a fortnight; they were brought by a strong south wind, which blew all that time <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observation communicated by M. de Montbeillard.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Kittiwake, <HI>Larus Riga:</HI> <Q>“It is white, its back hoa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, its tail-quills entirely white; its feet have three toes.”</Q>—Specific character of the Tarrock, <HI>Larus Tridacty∣lus:</HI> <Q>“It is whitish, its back somewhat hoary, its tail-quills, except the outermost, tipt with black; its feet have three toes.”</Q> But Mr. Latham very properly classes them under the same species, the Tarrock being only the young bird.</NOTE></P>

M. Baillon has made the following observations on the different shades of colours that its plumage assumes in the successive moultings: in the first year the quills of the wings are blackish; and not till the second moulting do they acquire the distinct black and the white spots with which they are variegated: no young Mew has a white tail, the end is always black or gray; at the same age the head and the upper side of the neck are marked with some spots, which are by degrees obliterated, and give place to pure white: the bill and the feet gain not their full colour till two years old.</P>
<P>To these general observations, very impor∣tant as they are to stop the unnecessary mul∣tiplication of species from individual varieties, M. Baillon adds some on the particular nature of the Blue-footed Mew. It is more difficult to tame than the rest, yet it seems not so wild in the state of liberty: it fights less, and is not so voracious as most of the others; but it is not so sprightly as the little cinereous Mew. When kept in a garden, it sought earth-worms: if of∣fered small birds, it would not touch them till they were half-torn; which shews that it is not
<PB N="386" REF="425"/>
so carnivorous as the gulls. And as it is not so lively or cheerful as the little Mews, which re∣main to be described, it seems, by its size and its instincts, to hold the middle rank between them both. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Common Sea-Mew, <HI>Larus Canus:</HI> "It is white, its back hoary."

<P>ITS inferior size, and the different colour of its legs, distinguish this Mew from the pre∣ceding, which it resembles exactly in its co∣lours. It has the same light cinereous and bluish on its mantle, the same black scallops spotted with white on the great quills of the wing, and lastly, the same snowy white over all the plumage, except a black speckle, which ap∣pears
<PB N="387" REF="426"/>
constantly on the sides of the neck behind the eye. The livery of the young ones consists of brown spots on the coverts of the wing. In the aged, the feathers of the belly have a slight tint of rose colour; and it is not till the second or third year, that the legs and the bill degenerate from a fine red into a livid complexion.</P>
<P>This and the laughing Mew are the two least of the whole family. They exceed not the bulk of a large pigeon, and their body is much thinner: they are thirteen or fourteen inches long. They are very handsome, clean, and ac∣tive; less vicious than the large species, yet more lively. They eat many insects, and during summer they make a thousand evolutions in the air after beetles and flies. They take such quantities of those, that their stomachs are filled up to their bill. They follow the rise of the tide <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sometimes they advance very far: M.

<P><HI>The Laughing Gull.</HI> Catesby, Penn. and Lath.</P></Q>
<P>THE cry of this little Mew bears some re∣semblance to a hoarse laugh; and hence its epithet. It is somewhat larger than a pi∣geon; but, like all the mews, its body appears much more bulky than in reality. The quan∣tity of fine feathers with which it is clothed, makes it very light; hence it flies almost continu∣ally over the water; and during its short intervals on land, it is extremely bustling and noisy, par∣ticularly in the breeding season, when these birds are most collected <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>. It lays six olive
<PB N="390" REF="429"/>
eggs spotted with black; the young ones are good food, and, according to the British Zoo∣logy, they are taken in great numbers in the counties of Essex and Stafford.</P>
<P>Some of these Laughing Mews settle on the rivers and even the pools of inland countries <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kramer and Schwenckfeld. These birds are seen on the Thames, near Gravesend, according to Albin.</NOTE>; and they seem to frequent the seas of both con∣tinents. Catesby found them at the Bahama Islands: Fernandez describes them under the Mexican name <HI>pipixcan:</HI> and, like all the other mews, they abound most in the northern countries. Martens, who observed them in Spitzbergen, and calls them <HI>kirmews,</HI> says, that they lay on whitish moss, in which the eggs can hardly be distinguished, being also dirty white, or greenish dotted with black; they are as large as those of pigeons, but very sharp at the end; the yolk is red, and the albugineous liquor is bluish. Martens says, that he ate of them, and found them very good, tasting like the eggs of lapwings. The parents dart boldly on the person who dares to rob their nest, and with loud cries they endeavour to drive him off by striking with their bills. The first syllable of their name <HI>kirmew,</HI> is expressive of their notes, according to the same traveller; who remarks, however, that their voice differs in the various regions which they inhabit, the polar tracts, the
<PB N="391" REF="430"/>
coasts of Scotland, those of Ireland, and the Ger∣man Ocean. He asserts that, in general, a dif∣ference may be perceived in the cries of animals of the same species, resulting from the influence of climate; and this diversity may indeed ob∣tain, especially in birds, for the tones of animals are the expressions of their most usual sensa∣tions; and the feathered race are delicately sensi∣ble to the variations of the atmosphere, and to the impressions of temperature.</P>
<P>Martens observes likewise, that the Mews of Spitzbergen have finer and more hairy feathers than those of our seas. This difference, too, arises from the climate. Another, which seems to be derived from the age of the individual, consists in the colour of the bill and the feet: in some these are red, in others black. But what proves that this difference does not consti∣tute two distinct species is, that the intermediate shade occurs in several subjects; some having the bill red, and the legs only reddish, and others having the bill red at the tip only, and the rest black. Thus we admit but one species of Laugh∣ing Mew; the difference which led Brisson to make a subdivision, lying entirely in the colour of the bill and of the legs. In the female, the front and throat are marked with white, whereas the whole head of the male is covered with a black cap: the great quills of the wing are also partly this colour: the mantle is bluish cine∣reous, and the rest of the body white. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the Black-headed Gull, <HI>Larus Ridi∣bundus:</HI> "It is whitish, its head blackish, its bill and feet red."—Specific character of the Laughing Gull, <HI>Larus Atricilla:</HI> <Q>“It is somewhat hoary, its head blackish, its bill red, its feet black.”</Q></P>
<P>We shall transcribe Dr. Plott's account of the manner of catching the Pewits last century in Staffordshire. After relating some mar∣vellous stories respecting their attachment to the lord of the manor, he thus proceeds: <Q>“Being of the migratory kind, their first ap∣pearance is not till the latter end of February, and then in number scarce above six, which come as harbingers to the rest, to see whe∣ther the hafts or islands in the pools (upon which they build their nests) be prepared for them; but these never so much as lighten, but fly over the pool, scarce staying an hour: about the 6th of March following, there comes a pretty considerable flight of an hundred or more, and then they alight on the hafts, and stay all day, but are gone again at night. About our Lady∣day, or sooner in a forward spring, they come to stay for good, otherwise not till the beginning of April, when they build their nests, which they make not of sticks, but heath and rushes, making them but shallow, and laying generally but four eggs, three and five more rarely, which are about the bigness of a small hen egg. The hafts or islands are prepared for them between Mi∣chaelmas and Christmas, by cutting down the reeds and rushes, and putting them aside in the nooks and corners of the hafts, and in the valleys, to make them level; for should they be permitted to rot on the islands, the pewits would not endure them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“After three weeks sitting the young ones are hatched, and about a month after they are almost ready to fly, which usually happens on the 3d of June, when the proprietor of the pool orders them to be driven and catched, the gentry coming from all parts to see the sport: the manner is thus—They pitch a rabbet-net on the bank∣side, in the most convenient place over-against the hafts, the net in the middle being about ten yards from the side, but close at the ends in the manner of a bow; then six or seven men wade into the pool, beyond the pewits, over-against the net, with long staves, and drive them from the hafts, whence they all swim to the bank∣side, and landing, run like lapwings into the net, where people are standing ready to take them up, and put them into two pens made within the bow of the net, which are built round, about three yards diameter, and a yard high, or somewhat better, with small stakes driven into the ground in a circle, and interwoven with broom and other raddles.”</Q>—(This description is illustrated by an engraving).</P>

“In which manner there have been taken in one morning fifty dozens at a driving, which, at five shillings a dozen (the ancient price of them) comes to £. 12. 105.: but at several drifts that have been anciently made in the same morning, there have been as many taken as have sold for £. 30; so that some years the profit of them has amounted to £. 50 or £. 60, beside what the generous proprietor usually presents his relations and the nobility and gen∣try of the county withal, which he constantly does in a plentiful manner, sending them to their houses in crates alive; so that feed∣ing them with livers and other entrails of beasts, they may kill them at what distance of time they please, according as occasions pre∣sent themselves, they being accounted a good dish at the most plen∣tiful” tables.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But they commonly appoint three days of driving them, within fourteen days, or thereabouts, of the 2d or 3d of June; which, while they are doing, some have observed a certain old one that seems to be somewhat more concerned than the rest, being clamorous, and striking down upon the heads of the men; which has given ground of suspicion that they have some government among them, and that this is their prince that is so much concerned for its subjects. And it is further observed, that when there is great plenty of them, the Lent-corn of the country is much the better, and so the cow-pas∣tures too, by reason they pick up all the worms and the fern-flies, which, though bred in the fern, yet nip and feed on the young corn and grass, and hinder their growth.”</Q> (The pools of Staffordshire, which the pewits frequented, were Pewit Pool, in the parish of Norbury, and Sebben Pool, in the parish of High Offley). <HI>Plott's Natural History of Staffordshire, pp.</HI> 232 and 233.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>WE suspect that this bird is no other than our spotted mew <HI>(kittiwake)</HI> which visits the inland parts of England during winter. We make this conjecture, because its bulk is the same, and its plumage similar, only brown where the other is gray: and it is well known that these birds when young have a darker cast, not to mention how easily the shades may be confounded in a description or drawing. If that of the British Zoology had been better, we could have spoken with more confidence. How∣ever, this Mew lives in winter on earth-worms, and when its stomach is overloaded, it disgorges them half-digested; which is the origin of the <HI>star-shot</HI> or <HI>star-gelly.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the Winter-Mew, <HI>Larus Hybernus:</HI> <Q>“It is white; its top, the back of its head, and the sides of its neck, spotted; its back cinereous; the first of its wing-quills black; its tail marked with a black bar near the tip.”</Q>—There is a passage in Morton's History of Northamptonshire, which, as it throws light on the oeconomy of the Winter-Mew, and indeed on the nature of birds in general, deserves a place in this work.</P>
<P><Q>"I shall here," says the intelligent author, “set down my remarks upon that <HI>gelatinous</HI> body called <HI>star-gelly, star-shot,</HI> or <HI>star-fall'n;</HI> so named because vulgarly believed to fall from a star, or to be the recrement of the meteor which is called the falling or shooting star, or rather the meteor itself shot down to the earth. It is generally a clear, almost sky-coloured, tremulous, viscid, or tenacious gelly; but in water glib and slippery. To the hand it is as cold as we gene∣rally say a frog is; and is apt to strike a chillness into it. 'Tis found in lumps or masses of a certain size. The largest I have seen was about the bigness of a goose egg. Those that are found fresh and new, are generally entire, very little, if at all, broken or dis∣persed: some of the masses are curled or convoluted somewhat like the <HI>ileum,</HI> or as a garden-snail appears when the shell is broken off from it. In consistence and colour, it pretty much resembles boiled starch, or rather a solution of <HI>gum tragacanth.</HI> I set some of this gelly on the fire in a silver vessel: it did not dissolve, as does cold boiled starch when it is set again upon the fire; but became thick and viscous; the more fluid or watery part of it having gone off in vapour. I let it stand till the humidity was all evaporated. To the bottom of the vessel adhered certain skins and vessels, like those of animal bodies. The inside of the porringer upon this operation exhibited a glistering like that of isinglass; and there proceeded from it a kind of greasy smell. Another experiment I made of the gelly broken and put into spring-water, which I set to seeth upon the fire, but not much of it dissolved. A piece of muslin being dipt into it so managed as with starch, was stiffened as with that. The gloss that it gave to the muslin might be rubbed off. The gelly being put into water, some of it subsided; some did not. In the pieces that floated I observed several bubbles, which I thought were formed by the water intruded into and retained in the pores” of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is sometimes found with patches of a dirty yellow in it; sometimes with black specks resembling little pellets of grumous blood. Breaking one of the lumps, I discovered and took out of it several pieces of tough skin, and of long tenacious string-like bo∣dies. Macerating another of these masses that I might clear the strings, as I called them, from the softer or more pulpy part of the gelly, I found them branched and distended through the whole mass. The smaller branches in size and figure like capillary blood∣vessels of a blackish red. With these were broad pieces of a very thin film or membrane. The mass, though a large one of the sort, might be drawn up and suspended by these strings. The gelly, when it has been kept for some time, becomes putrid, and has a strong smell, like that of a dead carcase in a putrid state. Chickens” will eat it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“This star-shot, as it is called, is very rarely to be met with on the tillage-lands. At Oxendon, and in most other places, we find it chiefly in the lower and moister ground, particularly on the ledges of sod, upon the sides of trenches in meadows, upon and near the banks of brooks or pools, on ant-hills and mould-banks now and then in great plenty. It occurs sometimes in dry, barren, and heathy ground. It does not appear for any number of years suc∣cessively in one and the same place. At Pisford, in January 1702, was shown me a mass of star-gelly lying upon a dead hedge that I am well assured had its first appearance there. The like has been found upon a flat board at the top of a cherry-ladder, in Mr. Courtman's garden at Thorpe. The last in as compact a mass as” those upon the ground are usually found in.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“As to the origin of this body, it has in many particulars a near analogy with animal substances; as the description of it plainly shows. And by several other circumstances that are not men∣tioned, it appears to me to be only the disgorging or casting of birds of three or four sorts; of those sort of fowl in particular that at certain seasons do feed very plentifully upon earth-worms and the like; and especially of the <HI>sea-maw,</HI> and the <HI>winter-mew</HI> or <HI>coddy-moddies</HI> birds of the gull kind, which are very ravenous. The <HI>coddy-moddies</HI> come up into this country in great numbers at the time this star-shot is generally found, viz. in the autumn and the winter months: frequent those very places where it usually occurs, viz. moist meadows and the banks of brooks, more rarely ploughed lands; and greedily devour carth-worms, which in those places, and about that time of the year, are very nume∣rous. They generally come up the vallies, where our brooks and rivers run, very early in the morning, even before the shep∣herds or any body else are abroad in the fields; especially in foggy mornings and before a storm, in such seasons and in such weather as in a particular manner invite the earth-worms out of their holes and recesses up upon the surface: and the birds return again to seaward. In the month of September, 1708, I saw a <HI>coddy-moddy</HI> shot down to the ground, that on her fall upon the ground, when almost half-dead, disgorged a heap of half-digested” earth-worms, much resembling the gelly called star-shot.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“In fine, having compared the notes or marks of that disgorge or casting with those of the gelly, called star-shot, I found them so much alike, I am satisfied the latter is for the main the same origin as is the former. Some of these masses I take to be dis∣gorged by herons and bitterns after having fed upon frogs, which they sometimes do. Sir William Craven once shot a bittern by one of Winwick pools, which after great heaving and working of her breast, at length discharged a quantity of this sort of gelly. The worthy Mr. Thomas Clerke, of Watford, assures me, that he has seen a mass of star-gelly, wherein appeared the head and other parts of a frog almost dissolved into a gelly, like to that which encompassed it. Having kept a parcel of frogs spawn some time by me, it had a smell very like that of corrupted star-shot. Others of them, it is not unlikely, are disgorged by crows, when they feed over-abundantly on earth-worms. The carrion crow will likewise feed upon frogs and toads too, pecking them into pieces, and so devouring them; whereas the herons, &amp;c. swallow them whole. The gelly upon the dead hedge, and on the cherry-ladder, in the instances above-mentioned, I am apt to” think came from crows or rooks....</Q></P>
<P><Q>“'Tis usual with birds, the more ravenous sort especially, to cast up what is uneasy and burthensome to their stomachs. This is well known to those who are conversant and experienced in the business of ordering and managing of birds, especially hawks. We may reasonably suppose, that all other birds that have a membranous stomach, and voracious appetite, do the same upon any the like occasion; these in particular I have now mention∣ed, namely, herons and bitterns, which have a membranous sto∣mach, as have all the carnivorous birds: and the Winter-Mew, and the carrion crow, whose stomachs are not furnished with such thick muscles, as are those of the granivorous birds. These, the <HI>Winter-Mew</HI> particularly, having glutted and overcharged their stomachs with earth-worms, or the like cold and viscid food, they cast it up again not duly dissolved; then especially when the earth-worms, &amp;c. are a new or more uncommon sort of food to them. We have a parallel instance in some sorts of fishes, accord∣ing to the curious and judicious Mr. Ray, who takes the <HI>Ballae Marinae,</HI> which are little round lumps (some of them as big as tennis-balls) of <HI>felstu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae</HI> amassed together, to be cast out of fishes stomachs.”</Q></P></NOTE></P>

AFTER this enumeration of the species of Gulls and Mews well described and distinctly known, we shall mention a few others, which might probably be ranged with the preceding, if their indications were more complete.</P>
<P N="1">1. That which Brisson calls <HI>the little gray mew,</HI> saying, that it is <HI>equal in bulk to the great cinereous mew;</HI> and which seems to differ from that species, or from that of the gray-mantled bill, because it has white mixed with gray on the back.</P>
<P N="2">2. That great Sea-Mew, mentioned by An∣derson, which preys on an excellent fish, called in Iceland <HI>runmagen.</HI> He tells us, that this bird carries it ashore, and eats only the liver; and that the peasants instruct the children to run up to the Mew as soon as it alights, and snatch from it the fish.</P>
<P N="3">3. The bird killed by Mr. Banks, in the la∣titude of 1° 7′ north, and longitude 28° 50′, and which he terms the <HI>black-footed gull,</HI> or <HI>larus cre∣pidatus.</HI> The excrements were of a bright red,
<PB N="399" REF="438"/>
approaching that of the liquor contained in the <HI>helix,</HI> which floats on the sea; which renders it probable that the bird feeds on that shell-fish.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Mew called by the inhabitants of the island of Luçon <HI>taringting,</HI> and which, from the character of vivacity ascribed to it, and its habit of running swiftly on the shore, may be either the little gray mew or the laughing mew.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Mew of the lake of Mexico, called by the inhabitants <HI>acuicuitzcatl,</HI> and of which Fernandez says nothing more.</P>
<P N="6">6. Lastly, a Gull observed by the Viscount de Querhoënt, in the road off the Cape of Good Hope, and which, from the account he oblig∣ingly communicated, must be a sort of the black-mantle, but its legs, instead of red, are sea-green.</P>

<P>CONSIDERING its size and figure, this bird might be ranged with the mews. But if it be of that family, it has lost all fraternal affection; for it is the avowed and eternal per∣secutor of its kindred, and particularly of the kittiwake. It keeps a steady eye on them, and when it perceives them betake to flight, it pur∣sues without intermission. The people of the north report that its object is to obtain the excrements from those unhappy little mews; and they have, for that reason, called it <HI>Strund∣jager,</HI> to which <HI>Stercorarius</HI> is synonymous. Most probably, however, this bird does not devour the dung, but only the fish which the kittiwakes drop from their bill or disgorge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Some naturalists have alledged, that certain species of gulls pursue others for their excrements. I have done all that was in my power to ascertain this fact, which I was always averse to be∣lieve. I have frequently repaired to the sea-shore to make obser∣vations, and have discovered what give rise to the fable. It is this:</P>
<P>This gulls maintain with each other a perpetual contest about their carnage, at least the great and middle species: when one comes out of the water with a fish in its bill, the first which per∣ceives it shoots down to snatch the prey; and if the fortunate plun∣derer hastens not to swallow the capture, it will be pursued in its turn by others still stronger, which strike it violently with their bill; it cannot avoid them but by escaping, or by repelling its ene∣my; and whether that the fish incumbers its flight, or that it is over∣come with fear, or sensible that the fish is the sole motive of the pursuit, it quickly throws it up; the other, which sees it drop, catches it dextrously before it reaches the water, and seldom misses to receive it.</P>
<P>The fish appears always white in the air, because it reflects the light, and seems, by reason of the celerity of the flight, to drop be∣hind the gull which vomits it. These two circumstances have de∣ceived observers.</P>
<P>I have verified the same fact in my garden; I chased some large gulls shouting after them; they ran and disgorged the fish which they had just swallowed; I threw it to them, and they caught it in the air, with as much alertness as dogs. <HI>Note communicated by M. Baillon, of Montreuil-sur-mer.</HI></P></NOTE>:

especially as it catches fish itself, and also eats whale's blubber; and amidst the abundance of nourishment with which the sea supplies its in∣habitants, it would be very strange if the Labbe was reduced to swallow what all the rest re∣ject.</P>
<P>No person has better described these birds than Ghister, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Stockholm. <Q>"The flight of the Labbe," says he, “is swift and poised, like that of the goshawk. The strongest wind cannot hinder it from catching in the air the small fish thrown to it by the fishermen. When they
<PB N="402" REF="442"/>
call <HI>lab, lab,</HI> it immediately repairs to receive the fish, whether raw or dressed, or the other food which is offered to it. It also takes the herrings out of the busses, and if they are salt∣ed, it washes them before swallowing. One can hardly approach it or fire upon it, un∣less some bait be thrown. But the fishermen are kind to it, as it is an almost infallible sign of a herring-shoal; and when the Labbe does not appear, their success is small. This bird is almost always on the sea; generally two or three appear together, and very sel∣dom five or six. When it cannot find pro∣vision at sea, it comes to the beach and at∣tacks the mews, which scream on its appear∣ance: but it rushes on them, and overtaking them, it alights on their back, and obliges them to cast up the fish which they had just swallowed. This bird, as well as the mews, lays its eggs on the rocks; the male is blacker and rather larger than the female <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collection Academique, <HI>partie etrangere, tom.</HI> xi. <HI>p.</HI> 51.</NOTE>.”</Q></P>
<P>Though it is the Long-tailed Labbe to which these observations seem chiefly to apply, we con∣ceive that they relate also to the species now under consideration, whose tail is fashioned so that the two middle feathers are the longest, but do not much exceed the others. Its bulk is nearly equal to that of the little mew, and its colour is dun cinereous, waved with gray∣ish <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This colour is lighter below the body; and sometimes, accord∣ing to Martens, the belly is white.</NOTE>:
<PB N="403" REF="443"/>
the wings are very large, and the legs are formed as in the mews, only not quite so strong; the toes are shorter. But the bill differs more from that of these birds, the end of the upper mandible being armed with a nail or hook that appears added; a character in which the bill of the Labbe resembles that of the petrels, though the nostrils are not tubular.</P>
<P>The Labbe has, in the carriage of its head, something of the bird of prey, and its predatory life belies not its appearance. It walks with its body erect, and screams very loud: it seems, says Martens, to pronounce <HI>i-ja</HI> or <HI>johan,</HI> when heard at a distance, and its voice resounds. Their mode of life necessarily disperses them; and that navigator says, that they are rarely found toge∣ther: he adds, that the species seemed not to be numerous, and that he met with few about Spitzbergen. The stormy winds of the month of November, 1779, drove two of these birds upon the coasts of Picardy: they were sent to us by M. Baillon, and from them we have made the preceding description. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Larus Crepidatus:</HI> <Q>“Its two mid∣dle tail quills are longer than the rest.”</Q> It is found in the north∣ern parts of Europe and America, and even on the Atlantic.

<P>THE production of the two middle feathers of the tail in two detached and diverging shafts, characterises this species, which is of the same bulk with the preceding. It has a black cap on the head; its neck is white, and all the rest of its plumage gray: sometimes the two long feathers of the tail are black. This bird was sent to us from Siberia, and we think that it is the same species with that found by Gmelin in the plains of Mangasea, near the banks of the river Jenisea. It occurs likewise in Norway, and even in Finmark and Angermania: and Edwards received it from Hudson's Bay, where, he observes, the English, no doubt on account of its hostilities against the mew, call it the <HI>Man-of-war Bird;</HI> a name beforehand applied,
<PB N="405" REF="445"/>
and with better reason, to the frigat. That au∣thor adds, that, from the length of its wings and the weakness of its legs, he should have judged that this bird lived more flying at sea than walking on land: yet, he remarks, the feet are as rough as a file, and proper to cling to the slippery backs of large fishes. Edwards enter∣tains the same opinion with us, that the Labbe, by the form of its bill, is intermediate between the mews and petrels.</P>
<P>Brisson reckons a third species of Labbe, the <HI>Stercorarius Striatus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“Above brown; the feathers edged at the tip with tawny; below dirty white, striped transversely with brown; its head brown; its throat whitish brown; its tail-quills white at their origin, and deep brown the rest of their length.”</Q> <HI>Brisson.</HI></P></NOTE>; but, as it is founded on Edwards' description, who regarded it as the female of the Long-tailed Labbe, we cannot adopt it. We also are of opinion, that it is only a variety from age or sex; and we even suspect that our first species might perhaps ad∣mit the same arrangement. In that case, we should have only one kind of Labbe, of which the adult or male would be that with two long feathers in the tail, and the female would be that represented by Edwards; the mantle deep ash∣brown on the wings and tail, with the fore side of the body of a dirty white gray; the thighs, the lower belly, and the rump, crossed with blackish and brown lines. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Larus Parasiticus:</HI> <Q>“Its two mid∣dle tail-quills are very long.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>IF regularity of form in animals, and symme∣try of proportion, strike us as graceful and beautiful, and if the rank which we assign them corresponds to the feelings they excite; nature knows not such distinctions. She loves them because they are the children of her creation; and her attachment requires no other plea. She cherishes alike in the desert the elegant <HI>gazel</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antilope-Dorcas.</HI> Linn. <HI>The Barbarian Antelope.</HI> Penn.</NOTE> and the shapeless camel; the pretty musk <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Moschus Pygmoeus.</HI> Linn. <HI>The Guinea Musk,</HI> Penn.</NOTE> and the gigantic <HI>giraff</HI> <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Camelopardalis-Giraffa.</HI> Linn. <HI>The Camelopard.</HI> Penn.</NOTE>: she launches into the air at once the magnificent eagle and the hideous vulture; and she conceals under the earth and in the waters generations innumerable of insects, fashioned in every fantastic shape. All varieties of figure and structure she admits, provided they are suited to the subsistence and propagation of the kind. The <HI>mantes</HI> live under the form of a leaf: the sea-urchins are imprisoned within a spherical shell: the vital juices filter and circulate
<PB N="407" REF="447"/>
through the branches of the <HI>asterias.</HI> The head of the <HI>zygena</HI> is flattened into a hammer; and the whole body of the moon - fish is rolled into a spiny globe. And do not a thousand other productions of figures equally strange demon∣strate, that the universal mother has aimed at diffusing animation, and of extending it to all possible forms? Not content with varying the traces and shades of the original pictures, does not she seem solicitous to draw communicating lines from each genus to all the others; and thus, from her rudest sketches to her most finished performances, all are connected and interwoven? Thus we have seen that the ostrich, the cassowary, and the dodo, by the shortness of their wings, the weight of their body, and the largeness of the bones of their legs, form the shade between the quadrupeds and the birds: the penguins are a-kin to the fish: and the Anhinga, the subject of this article, exhibits a reptile grafted on the body of a bird. Its ex∣cessively long and slender neck, and its small cylindrical head, rolled out like a spindle, of the same girth with the neck, and drawn out into a long sharp bill, resemble both the figure and the motion of a snake, whether the bird nimbly ex∣tends its head to fly from the tops of trees, or unfolds it and darts it into the water to pierce the fishes.</P>
<P>These singular analogies have equally struck all who have observed the Anhinga in its na∣tive
<PB N="408" REF="448"/>
country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave.—Barrere.</NOTE> (Brazil and Guiana); they strike us even in the dried specimens of our cabinets. The plumage of the neck and head does not alter its slender shape; for it is a close down, shaven like velvet: the eyes are of a bril∣liar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> black, with the iris golden, and encircled by a naked skin: the bill is jagged at the tip with small indentings turned backwards. The body is scarcely seven inches long, and the neck alone measures double.</P>
<P>The extreme length of the neck is not the only disproportion that strikes us in the figure of the Anhinga. Its large and broad tail, composed of twelve spread feathers, differs no less from the short round shape which obtains in most of the swimming birds: yet the Anhinga swims, and even dives, only holding its head out of the water, in which it plunges entirely on the least suspicion of danger: for it is very wild, and can never be surprized on land. It keeps con∣stantly on the water, or perched on the tallest trees, by the sides of rivers and in overflowed savannas. It builds its nest on these trees, and repairs among them to pass the night. Yet it is en∣tirely palmated, its four toes being connected by a single piece of membrane, and the nail of the middle one serrated within. These coincidences of structure and habits seem to indicate an affi∣nity between the Anhinga and the cormorant
<PB N="409" REF="449"/>
and boobies; but its small cylindrical head, and its bill drawn out to a point, without any hook, distinguish it from these two kinds of birds.—The skin of the Anhinga is very thick, and the flesh commonly fat, but has a disagreeable oily taste: Marcgrave found it to be no better <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han that of the gull, which is surely very bad.</P>
<P>None of the three Anhingas figured in our <HI>Planches Enluminées</HI> exactly resembles that de∣scribed by Marcgrave. N° 960 has, like that naturalist's, the upper side of the back dotted, the end of the tail fringed with gray, and the rest of a shining black: but all the body is black, the head and neck are not gray, and the breast is of a silvery white.

Yet we think that these two birds, which were brought from Cayenne, are really of the same species with the Brazilian Anhinga, described by Marcgrave; the differ∣ences of colours not exceeding what, in the plumage of the water birds especially, might result from age or sex. Marcgrave remarks too, that the nails of his Anhinga were reflect∣ed and very sharp, and that it uses them to catch fish; that its wings are large, and reach,
<PB N="410" REF="450"/>
when closed, to the middle of its long tail. He seems, however, to over-rate its bulk in com∣paring it to the duck. The Anhinga which we know, may be about thirty inches, or even more, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail: but this large tail and its long neck occupy the largest share of this measure, and its body does not appear to exceed that of a morillon. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Plotus Anhinga:</HI> <Q>“Its head is smooth; its belly white.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>THE mode of life, the habits, and oeconomy of animals, are not so free as might be sup∣posed. Their actions result not from inclina∣tion and choice, but are the necessary effects of their peculiar organization and structure. Nor do they seek ever to infringe or evade the law of their constitution: the eagle never abandons his rocks, or the heron her shores: the one shoots down from the aerial regions, to plunder or murder the lamb, founding his prescriptive right on his strength, his armour, and his habi∣tual rapine; the other, standing in the mire, pa∣tiently expects the glimpse of its fugitive prey. The woodpecker never forsakes the trees, round which he is appointed to creep. The snipe must for ever remain in its marshes; the lark in its furrows, and the warbler in its groves. All the granivorous birds seek the inhabited countries, and attend on the progress of cultivation. While
<PB N="413" REF="453"/>
those which prefer wild fruits and berries, per∣petually fly before us, and cherish the wilds, and forests, and mountains: there, remote from the dwellings of man, they obey the injunctions of nature. She retains the hazel grous under the thick shade of pines; the solitary blackbird un∣der his rock; the oriole in the forests, which re∣sound with its notes; while the bustard seeks its subsistence on the dry commons, and the rail in the wet meadows. Such are the eternal, immu∣table decrees of nature, as permanent as their forms: these great possessions she never resigns, and on these we vainly hope to encroach. And are we not continually reminded of the weakness of our empire? She obliges us even to receive troublesome and noxious species: the rats make a lodgment in our houses, the martins in our windows, the sparrows in our roofs; and when she conducts the stork to the top of our old ruinous towers, already the habitation of the mournful family of nocturnal birds, does she not hasten to resume the possessions which we have usurped for a time, but which the silent lapse of ages will infallibly restore to her?</P>
<P>Thus the numerous and diversified species of birds, led by instinct, and confined by their wants to the different districts of nature, have apportioned among themselves the air, the earth, and the water. Each holds its place, and en∣joys its little domain, and the means of subsist∣ence, which the extent or defect of its faculties
<PB N="414" REF="454"/>
will augment or abridge. And as all the possi∣ble gradations in the scale of existence must be filled up, some species, confined to a single mode of support, cannot vary the use of those imper∣fect instruments which nature has bestowed on them. Thus the spoonbill seems formed for ga∣thering shell-fish: the small flexible strap and the reflected arch of the avoset's bill, reduce it to live on fish-spawn: the oyster-catcher has an ax-shaped bill, calculated for opening the shells: and the crossbill could not subsist, were it not dextrous in plucking the scales from the fir∣cones. Lastly, the <HI>Shearbill</HI> could neither eat sidewise, nor gather food, nor peck forwards; its bill consisting of two pieces extremely unequal, the lower mandible, being long and extended dis∣proportionately, projects far beyond the upper, into which it falls like a razor into its haft <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>. To catch its prey with this awkward and defec∣tive instrument, the bird is obliged to fly, skim∣ming the surface, and with its lower mandible cutting the water. By this necessary and labo∣rious exertion, the only one it can perform, it shovels up the fish, and earns its subsistence <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They feed on small fish, which they catch flying where the water is shallow; they keep their lower mandible almost always in the water, and when they feel a fish they close both mandibles, which may be termed the blades. <HI>Memoirs on the Natural History of Guiana, communicated by M. de la Borde, king's physician at Cryenne.</HI></NOTE>. Hence some observers have called it <HI>cutwater:</HI> the name <HI>Shearbill (bec-en-ciseau)</HI> is derived from
<PB N="415" REF="455"/>
the structure of its bill; the lower mandible be∣ing hollowed out by a channel, and furnished with two sharp ledges, receives the upper one, which is flattened like a blade.</P>
<P>The point of the bill is black, the part next the head is red, and so are the feet, which have the same structure as those of the gulls. The Shearbill is nearly equal to the little cinereous mew: the whole upper surface of the body, the fore side of the neck, and the front, are white: it has also a white streak on the wing, some of whose quills, and also the lateral ones of the tail, are partly white: all the rest of the plumage is black, or blackish brown: in some subjects it is simply brown, which appears to indi∣cate a variety from age <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rynchops Fulva.</HI> Linn. Specific character: "It is fulvous, its bill black." However, Gmelin reckons it only a variety.</NOTE>; for, according to Catesby, the male and female are of the same colour.</P>
<P>These birds are found on the coasts of Caro∣lina and of Guiana; on the latter they are nu∣merous, and appear in flocks, almost always on wing, and only alight in the mire. Though their wings are very long, their flight is remarked to be slow <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>airs communicated by M. de la Borde.</NOTE>: if it were swift, they could not dis∣tinguish and raise their prey, as they rushed along
<PB N="416" REF="456"/>

<P>The species seems peculiar to the American seas; nor can we extend it to the East Indies, because Ray's continuator mentions a drawing sent from Madras, but which was perhaps made elsewhere. We are also of opinion, that the sheerwater of the South Sea, so often mentioned by Captain Cook, is not the same with the Shearbill of Cayenne, though they have received the same name: for, besides the immense differ∣ence between the hot climate of Cayenne and the pinching colds of the South Seas, it ap∣pears, from two passages of his narrative, that his sheerwaters were petrels <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“We now began to see some of that sort of petrels so well known to sailors by the name of sheerwaters, latitude 58° 10′ S. longitude 50° 54′ E." <HI>Second Voyage,</HI> vol. i. p. 45.—"We had another opportunity of examining two different albatrosses, and a large black species of sheerwater, <HI>Procellaria Aequinoxialis:</HI> we had now been nine weeks out of sight of land.”</Q> <HI>Idem.</HI></P>

<P>MAN, who rules with haughty sway on land, is scarce known in another great division of nature's vast empire. On the stormy face of the seas, he finds enemies of superior force, ob∣stacles that baffle his art, and dangers that exceed his courage. When he dares to pass those bar∣riers of the world, all the elements combine to punish his audacity, and nature reclaims that do∣minion which he vainly aspires to usurp; there he is a fugitive, not a master. If he disturbs the inhabitants, if he ensnares or transfixes some un∣happy victims, the bulk of them, safe in the bosom of the abyss, will in some future period see the winds and storms, and piercing colds, sweep from the face of the ocean its troublesome and destructive guests.</P>
<P>In fact the animals, which nature, though with feebler faculties, has fortified against the billows and the tempests, know not our dominion. Most of the sea-birds suffer us to approach them, and even to seize them, with a degree of unconcern that appears to border on stupidity, but which

clearly evinces that man is to them a new and strange being, and that, far removed from his controul, they enjoy full and entire liberty. We have already seen several instances of that appa∣rent weakness, or rather profound security, which characterizes the winged inhabitants of the ocean. The Noddy, of which we now treat, has been termed the <HI>foolish sparrow (passer stultus);</HI> a very inaccurate denomination, since the Noddy is not a sparrow, but resembles a tern or little mew, and, in fact, forms the gradation between these two kinds of birds: for it has the feet of the mew, and the bill of the tern. All its plumage is dark brown, except a white space, like a cowl, on the top of the head. Its bulk is nearly equal to that of the common tern.</P>
<P>We have adopted the name <HI>Noddy</HI> (Noddi) which occurs frequently in English voyages <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly in those of Dampier and Cook.</NOTE>, because it expresses the stupidity, or silly con∣fidence, with which the bird alights on the masts and yards of ships <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These are stupid birds, which, like the boobies, allow them∣selves to be caught by the hand, on the yards and the rigging of the vessel, on which they alight. <HI>Catesby.</HI></NOTE> and even on the sailors' hands <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Thouaroux</HI> (the name of the Noddies in Cayenne) come to fish on very ample space, in company with the frigats; I never saw them alight on the water, like the gulls; but at night they come roving about the vessels to find repose, and the sailors catch them by lying on the top of the stern, and stretching out their hand, upon which the birds make no scruple to alight. <HI>Memoirs communicated by M. de la Borde, king's physician at Cayenne.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

No one yet knows to what distance any of the oceanic birds go to sea; for my own part, I do not believe that there is one in the whole tribe that can be relied on, in pointing out the vicinity of land. <HI>Idem.—</HI>The Noddies are seen more than an hundred leagues from land. <HI>Catesby.</HI> (The egg-bird of Cook is the same with the Noddy of Dampier, and is the sooty tern, <HI>Sterna Fuliginosa,</HI> already described).</NOTE>; but is very numerous in its haunts. <Q>"At Cayenne," says M. de la Borde, “there are an hundred Noddies for one booby, or man-of-war bird: they particularly cover the rock of the <HI>Grand Connetable,</HI> whence they come to fly about the vessels; and when a cannon is fired, they rise embo∣died in a thick cloud.”</Q> Catesby also saw them in great numbers, flying together, and dropping continually on the surface of the sea, to catch the little fish, shoals of which are impelled by violent winds. The birds seem to perform their part with great alacrity and cheer∣fulness, if we judge from the variety of their cries, and their great noise, which may be heard some miles. <Q>"All this," adds Catesby, “has place only in the breeding season, when they lay their eggs on the naked rock <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On those of Bahama. <HI>Catesby.—</HI>On the isle of Rocca. <HI>Dam∣pier.:—</HI>On the south side of St. Helena, by several small islets, which are properly but rocks, where we see thousands of black gulls, whose eggs, which are very good eating, were laid on the bare rock.

<P>THE webbed birds have, for the most part, short legs. Those of the Avoset are very long; and this disproportion, which would almost alone distinguish it, is attended with a character still more singular, that is, the inversion of its bill, which is bent into an arc of a circle, whose centre lies above the head: the substance of the bill is soft and almost membranous at its tip <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE>; it is thin, weak, slender, compressed horizontally, and incapable of defence and effort. It is one of
<PB REF="464"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE SCOOPING AVOSET.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="423" REF="465"/>
those errors or essays of nature, which if carried a little farther would destroy itself; for if the cur∣vature of the bill were a degree increased, the bird could not procure any sort of food, and the organ destined for the support of life would in∣fallibly occasion its destruction. The bill of the Avoset may therefore be regarded as the extreme model which nature could trace, or at least pre∣serve; and for that reason it is the most distant from the forms exhibited in other birds.</P>
<P>It is even difficult to conceive how this bird feeds by help of an instrument that can neither peck nor seize its prey, but only rake in the softest mud. It seems to employ itself in search∣ing the froth of the waves for fish-spawn, which appears to be its chief support. It probably eats worms also; for its bowels contain a glutinous substance, fat to the touch, of a colour bordering on orange yellow, in which are some vestiges of fish-spawn and aquatic insects. This gelatinous mass is always mixed in the stomach with little white crystalline stones <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby says, that he could find nothing else.</NOTE>: sometimes in the intestines there occurs a gray or earthy green matter, which seems to be the slimy sediment which fresh waters, swelled by rains, deposit on their bed. The Avoset frequents the mouths of rivers and streams <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At least in Picardy, where these observations were made. (In England also, at the mouth of the Severn.)</NOTE>, in preference to other parts of the sea-shore.</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="466"/>
This bird is somewhat larger than the lap∣wing: its legs are seven or eight inches high; its neck is long, and its head round; its plu∣mage is snowy white on all the fore side of the body, and intersected with black on the back; the tail is white, the bill black, and the feet blue.</P>
<P>The Avoset runs by means of its long legs on bottoms covered with five or six inches of water: but in deeper parts, it swims, and in all its mo∣tions it appears lively, alert, and volatile. It stays but a short while in the same place; and in its passages to the coast of Picardy, in April and November, it often disappears the morning after its arrival: so that sportsmen find great dif∣ficulty to kill or catch a few. They are still more rare in the inland country: yet Salerne says, that they have been seen to advance pretty high on the Loire. He assures us, that they are very numerous on the coasts of Low Poitou, where they breed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Avoset is very rare in the Orleanois...On the contrary, nothing is more common on the coasts of Lower Poitou; and in the breeding season, the peasants take their eggs by thousands to eat: when driven off its nest, it counterfeits lameness as much or more than any other bird. <HI>Salerne.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears from the route which the Avosets hold in their passage, that, on the approach of winter, they journey towards the south, and re∣turn in the spring to the north: for they occur in Denmark <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Muller and Brunnich.</NOTE>, in Sweden, on the southern

These birds only visit Prussia <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Rzaczynski.</NOTE>; they very seldom appear in Sweden; and, according to Aldrovandus, they are not more frequent in Italy, though well known there, and justly named <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Beccotorto;</HI> i. e. twisted-bill.</NOTE>. Some fowlers have assured us, that their cry may be expressed by the syl∣lables, <HI>crex, crex.</HI> But we cannot, on such slen∣der authority, infer, that the Avoset is the same with the crex of Aristotle:—"For the <HI>crex,"</HI> says the philosopher, <Q><HI>“wages war against the</HI>” <HI>oriole and the blackbird.</HI></Q> And the Avoset can certainly have no quarrel with two birds which inhabit the woods. Besides, the cry, <HI>crex, crex,</HI> belongs equally to the jaducka snipe and the land rail.</P>
<P>In most of the Avosets there is dirt on the rump, and the feathers seem worn off by rubbing. Probably these birds wipe their bill on their feathers, or lodge it among them when they sleep; since the form seems as cum∣bersome to be disposed during rest, as awkward for action, unless, like the pigeon, it lays its head on its breast during repose.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="468"/>
The observer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Baillon, of Montreuil-sur-mer.</NOTE> who has communicated these facts is persuaded, that the Avoset is at first gray, and he adopts this opinion because many of those which arrive in November have the tips of their scapular feathers gray, as well as those of the rump: but these feathers, and those which cover the wings, preserve longest the livery of their birth: the dull colour of the great quills of the wings, and the pale tint of their legs, which in the adults are of a fine blue, leave no doubt but the Avosets whose plumage is mixed with gray are young ones. There are few exterior differ∣ences in this species between the male and fe∣male: the old males have much black, but the old females have nearly the same; only the latter seem to be smaller, and the head of the former rounder, with the fleshy tubercle that rises under the skin, near the eye, more inflated. We ought not to admit varieties into the species, though the Avosets of Sweden, according to Linnaeus, have the rump black, which is white in the multitudes that inhabit a certain lake in Lower Austria, as Kramer remarks.</P>
<P>Whether from timidity or address, the Avoset shuns snares, and is very difficult to take <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“I have practised every possible stratagem to take these birds, but could never succeed.”</Q> <HI>Observations communicated by M.

<P>ALL the birds which swim, and whose toes are connected by membranes, have the leg short, the thigh contracted, and often partly concealed under the belly. Their feet con∣structed and disposed like broad oars, with a short handle, and in an oblique position, seem expressly calculated for impelling the little ani∣mated ship: the bird is at once the vessel, the rudder, and the pilot. But amidst this grand fleet of winged navigators, three species form a separate squadron: their feet are indeed furnish∣ed with membranes like the other swimming birds, but they are at the same time raised on tall legs, and, in this respect, resemble the wa∣ders. Thus they form the intermediate grada∣tion between two very different classes.</P>
<P>These three birds with tall legs and palmated feet are the avoset, the flamingo, and the Run∣ner, so called according to Aldrovandus, be∣cause
<PB N="429" REF="471"/>
it runs swiftly along the shores. That na∣turalist, to whom alone we are indebted for the account of this bird, tells us, that it is not rare in Italy. But it is unknown in France, and in all probability it occurs in no other country of Europe, at least it is very uncommon. Charle∣ton says, that he saw one, without mentioning whence it came. According to Aldrovandus, the things of this bird are short in proportion to the length of its legs: the bill is yellow throughout, but black at the tip; it is short, and does not open much: the mantle is iron gray, and the belly white: two white feathers with black points cover the tail. This is all that the naturalist informs us; he adds nothing about its measures; but, if we judge from his figure, they are nearly the same with those of the plover.</P>
<P>Both Aristotle and Athenaeus speak of a bird that runs swiftly, and which they term <HI>trochilos,</HI> saying, <Q>that “it comes in calm weather, to seek its food on the water.”</Q> But is this bird a palmiped and swimmer, as Aldrovandus asserts, while he refers to it his courier; or is it not, as Aelian hints, a wader of the kind of gallinules or ringed plovers? It seems difficult to decide, from the scanty information transmitted from the an∣cients. All that we can gather is, that this <HI>trochilos</HI> is an aquatic bird; and with some pro∣bability Aelian refers to it the report of anti∣quity, that it entered boldly the jaws of the
<PB N="430" REF="472"/>
crocodile to eat the leeches, and warn it of the approach of the <HI>ichneumon.</HI> This fable has been applied the most absurdly imaginable to the gold-crested wren, from a confusion of names, that little chorister being often termed <HI>trochilos,</HI> because of its whirling flight.</P>

<P>THE name <HI>Phoenicopterus,</HI> applied by the Greeks, and adopted by the Romans, expresses the striking feature of this bird—the crimson colour of its wings. But this is not the only remarkable character of the bird: the bill is flattened with a sudden bend above, thick and squared below, like a broad spoon; its legs are excessively tall; its neck is long and slender; its body is more elevated, though smaller, than that of the stork, and pre∣sents a singular and conspicuous figure among the great waders.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="475"/>
Those large semi-palmated birds, which haunt the sides of waters, but neither dive nor swim, are judiciously reckoned by Willughby distinct and independent species: for the Flamingo in particular seems to form the gradation between them and the class of the great swimmers, which it resembles by its half-webs, and because the membrane stretched between the toes re∣cedes in the middle by two scallops. All the toes are very short, and the outer one extremely little: the body also is small in proportion to the length of its wings and neck. Scaliger compares it to that of the heron, and Gesner to that of the stork; remarking, as well as Wil∣lughby, the excessive length of the slender neck. <Q>“When the Flamingo has attained its full growth,”</Q> says Catesby, <Q>“it is not heavier than a wild duck, and is yet five feet high.”</Q> These great differences in size, noticed by au∣thors, have a reference to the age as well as to the varieties which they have also remarked in the plumage. This is generally soft and silky, and washed with red tints of greater or less vi∣vacity and extent: the great quills of the wing are constantly black: the coverts, both the greater and lesser, the exterior and interior, are imbued with fine flame-colour; which spreads and dilutes by degrees over the back and the rump, the breast and the neck; on the upper part of which, and on the head, the plumage is a
<PB N="433" REF="476"/>
shaven and velvet down. The top of the head is nacked; the neck is very slender, and the bill is broad; so that the bird has an uncommon ap∣pearance. Its skull seems to be raised and its throat dilated before, to receive the lower man∣dible, which is very broad at its origin. The two mandibles form a round and straight canal as far as their middle; after which the upper one bends suddenly, and its convexity changes into a broad surface: the lower mandible reflects proportionally, but always preserves the shape of a broad gutter; and the upper one, by a small curvature at its point, applies to the ex∣tremity of the lower mandible. The sides of both are beset internally with a small black in∣denting, whose points are turned backwards. Dr. Grew, who has described this bill with great accuracy, remarks also a filament within, un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the upper mandible, and which divides it in the middle. It is black from its tip to where it bends, and from thence to the root it is white in the dead bird, but, in the living subject, it seems liable to vary; since Gesner asserts, that it is of a bright red, Aldrovandus that it is brown, Willughby that it is blueish, and Seba that it is yellow. <Q>"To a small round head," says Du∣tertre, “is joined a large bill four inches long, half red, half black, and bent into the form of a spoon.”</Q> The Academicians, who have de∣scribed this bird under the name of <HI>Bécharu,</HI>
<PB N="434" REF="477"/>
say, that its bill is of a pale red, and contains a thick tongue edged with fleshy <HI>papillae,</HI> turned backwards, which fills the cavity or the large spoon of the lower mandible. Wormius also describes this extraordinary bill; and Aldrovan∣dus remarks how much nature has sported in its conformation: Ray speaks of its strange figure. But none of them have examined it with such attention as to decide a point which we should be glad to ascertain, viz. whether, as many naturalists alledge, the upper mandible is moveable, while the lower is fixed.</P>
<P>Of two figures of this bird, published by Al∣drovandus, and sent to him from Sardinia, the one expresses not the characters of the bill, which are accurately portrayed in the other. And we must remark by the way, that in our plate the swelling and flattening of the bill are too faint, and that it is represented too much pointed.</P>
<P>Pliny seems to class this bird with the storks, and Seba has injudiciously supposed that the <HI>phoenicopterus</HI> was ranked by the ancients with the ibis. But it belongs to neither of these kinds: it forms a separate division. And be∣sides, when the ancients placed together analo∣gous species, they did not follow the narrow views, or adhere to the scholastic methods, of our nomenclators; they observed in nature cer∣tain resemblances of habits and faculties, which they conjoined in the same group.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="478"/>
We may reasonably wonder that the name <HI>phoenicopterus</HI> occurs not in Aristotle, though mentioned by Aristophanes, who ranges it among the marsh birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.

The Flamingo is undoubtedly a migratory bird, but visits only the warm and temperate regions, and never penetrates to the northern tracts. In certain seasons, they appear in se∣veral places, nor can we be certain whence they come, but they never seem to travel to∣wards the north; and if some solitary stragglers are found at times in the interior parts of France, they have been driven thither in a storm. Salerne relates, as an extraordinary oc∣currence, that one was killed on the Loire. The hot countries are the scene of their migra∣tions: and they have traversed the Atlantic; for they are of the small number of birds that in∣habit the tropical regions of both continents <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the island of Mauritius, or of France, there are many of the birds called <HI>giants,</HI> because they carry their head six feet high; they are exceeding tall, and their neck is very long; their body is not larger than that of a goose: they feed in marshy places; and the dogs often take them by surprize, as they require a considerable time to rise from the ground. We once saw one at Rodrigue, and it was so fat that we caught it with the hand: it is the only one which we ever remarked, which makes me think that it had been driven thither by some violent wind, which it could not resist.

They are seen east from the plain <HI>Cul-de-sac,</HI> in a great pool which contains many islets; but the number of these birds is observed to diminish in proportion as the marshes are drained, and the tall timber cut down which skirts them. <HI>Extract from the Me∣moirs communicated by the Chevalier Lefebvre Deshayes.</HI></NOTE>, in the Antilles and the Caribbee islands <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Hernandez, Rochefort.</NOTE>, where

They occur also in Peru <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Laet.</NOTE>, and as far as Chili <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Frezier.</NOTE>. In short, there are few parts of South America where navigators have not met with them.</P>
<P>These American Flamingos are entirely the same with those of Europe and Africa. The species appears single and disjoined, since it admits of no variety.</P>
<P>These birds breed on the coasts of Cuba and of the Bahama islands <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Catesby.</NOTE> on the deluged shores, and the low islets, such as that of <HI>Aves</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Fifty leagues to the windward of Dominica.</NOTE>, where Labat found a number with their nests. These are little heaps of clayey and miry soil gathered from the marshes, and raised about twenty inches into a pyramid in the middle of the water, which constantly washes the base; the top is truncat∣ed, hollow, and smooth, and, without any bed of feathers or herbs, receives the eggs, which the bird covers, says Catesby, by sitting across the hillock <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">I was shown a great number of these nests; they resemble truncated cones, composed of fat earth, about eighteen or twenty inches high, and as much in diameter at the base; they are always in water, that is, in meres or marshes: these cones are solid to the height of the water, and then hollow like a pot bored at top; in this they lay two eggs, which they hatch by resting on them, and covering the hole with their tail. I broke some, but found nei∣ther feathers, nor herbs, nor any thing that might receive the eggs: the bottom is somewhat concave, and the sides are very even. <HI>Labat.</HI></NOTE>, its legs hanging down, like a man
<PB N="440" REF="483"/>
on a stool: so that only the rump and lower belly are of service in the incubation. This singular position it is obliged to adopt on ac∣count of the length of its legs, which could never be bent under it if it were squat. Dam∣pier gives the same description of the mode of hatching in the island of Sal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They make their nest in the marshes, where they can find plenty of slime, which they heap with their claws, and form hil∣locks resembling little islets, and which appear a foot and a half above the water; they make the base broad, and taper the struc∣ture gradually to the top, where they leave a small hollow to receive their eggs. When they lay or hatch, they stand erect, not on the top but very near it, their feet on the ground and in the water, leaning themselves against the hillock, and covering the nest with their tail: their legs are very long, and as they make their nest on the ground, they could not, without injuring their eggs or their young, have their legs in the nest, nor sit, nor support their whole body but for this wonderful instinct which nature has given them. They never lay more than two eggs, and seldom fewer. Their young ones cannot fly till they are almost full grown; but will run prodigiously fast. <HI>Dampier.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The nests are always placed in the salt∣marshes; they contain only two or at most three eggs, which are white, as thick as those of a goose, and somewhat longer. The young do not begin to fly till they have gained almost their full growth; but they run remarkably swiftly a few days after they are hatched.</P>
<P>The plumage is at first of a light gray, and that colour becomes deeper, in proportion as
<PB N="441" REF="484"/>
their feathers grow; but it requires ten or twelve months before their body attains its full size, and then they assume their fine colour, whose tints are faint when they are young, and grow deeper and brighter as they advance in age <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They differ in colour, their plumage being white when they are young; then, in proportion as they grow, they become rose co∣loured; and lastly, when aged, they are entirely carnation. <HI>De Laet, and Labat.</HI></NOTE>. Ac∣cording to Catesby, two years pass before they acquire the whole of their beautiful red colour. Father Dutertre makes the same remark <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The young are much whiter than the old ones; they incline to red as they grow old: I have seen some also which had their wings mixed with red, black, and white feathers; I believe that these are males.”</Q></NOTE>. But whatever be the progress of this tint in the plumage, the wing first acquires the colour, and is always brighter than the other parts. The red afterwards spreads from the wing to the rump, then to the back and the breast, and as far as the neck: only in some individuals there are slight varieties of shades, which seem to fol∣low the differences of climate: for example, the Flamingo of Senegal seemed to have a deep red, and that of Cayenne inclined to orange; but that variation was not enough to constitute two spe∣cies, as Barrere has done.</P>
<P>Their food is in every country nearly the same. They eat shell-fish, fish-spawn, and aquatic in∣sects: they seek them in the mud, into which they thrust their bill and part of their head; at
<PB N="442" REF="485"/>
the same time they continually push their feet downwards, to carry the prey with the slime to their bill, which is fitted by its indenting to re∣tain any substance. It is a small seed, says Catesby, like millet, that they bring up by thus puddling in the mire. But it probably is nothing else than the egg of some insect; for the flies and gnats are surely as abundant in the over∣flowed plains of America as in the low grounds of the north, where Maupertuis saw whole lakes covered with such eggs, resembling the grains of millet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oeuvres de Maupertuis, <HI>tom.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 116.</NOTE>. In the islands of the new world, these birds may find abundance of this sort of food; but on the coasts of Europe they subsist on fish, the indentings of their bill serv∣ing like teeth to hold the slippery prey.</P>
<P>They appear to prefer the sea-shore: if they are seen on rivers, such as the Rhone <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Peiresc. vita, <HI>lib.</HI> ii.</NOTE>, it is never far from their mouth. They haunt more constantly the inlets, salt - marshes, and low coasts; and it has been observed, that in rear∣ing them they require salt-water to drink <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Laet, Labat, and Charlevoix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These birds always go in flocks; and to fish, they naturally form themselves into a line, which at a distance has a singular appearance, like a file of soldiers <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voy. <HI>tom.</HI> xii. <HI>p.</HI> 229.</NOTE>. This propensity to dispose themselves in ranks still adheres to them when,
<PB N="443" REF="486"/>
placed one against another, they repose on the beach <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They usually rest upon their legs, one against the other, in a single line; in this situation any person at the distance of half a mile would take them for a brick wall, because they have exactly the same colour. <HI>Roberts, Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom.</HI> xi. <HI>p.</HI> 364.</NOTE>. They station sentinels and keep a sort of guard, as usual with all gregarious birds. When they are engaged in fishing, their head plunged in the water, one of them remains sentry, keeping his head erect <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“They are constantly on their guard against any surprizal by their enemies, and it is alledged that some stand as sentinels while the rest are occupied in searching for food; besides, they are said to smell powder at a distance, and are therefore approached with difficulty. Our old buccaneers employed a stratagem sor killing them similar to what the people of Florida are said to use, in order to approach the deer; they covered themselves with ox∣skins, and advanced against the wind upon the Flamingos, which, being accustomed to see oxen feed in the savannas, are not intimi∣dated, and thus the hunters can easily fire at them.”</Q> <HI>Charleuoix.</HI></P></NOTE>: on the least menace of danger, he gives a loud cry, audi∣ble at a great distance, and much like the sound of a trumpet <NOTE N="&amp;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“These birds have such a strong voice, that any person hear∣ing them would suppose they were trumpets sounding; and while they have their head concealed, dabbling in the water, like the swans, to find there subsistence, there is always one that continues erect as sentinel, its neck extended, its eye watchful, its head roving: as soon as it perceives a person, it sounds the trumpet, gives alarm to its district, rises the first on wing, and all the rest follow it.”</Q> <HI>Idem.</HI></P></NOTE>; instantly the whole flock rises, and preserves in its flight an order similar to that of cranes. Yet if these birds be suddenly sur∣prized, they remain stupid and motionless thro' fear, and afford the fowler time to knock them
<PB N="444" REF="487"/>
down one after another. Of this we are informed by Dutertre, and it may also reconcile the oppo∣site accounts of navigators; some representing the Flamingos as timorous birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“Their hearing and smell are so acute, that they can wind at a great distance the fowlers and the fire-arms; and also, to avoid all surprize, they prefer alighting on open places in the midst of marshes, whence they can descry their enemies from afar, and there is always one of the band that keeps watch.</Q>” Rochefort, <HI>Hist. des Antilles.</HI></NOTE>, which can hardly be approached <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These birds are difficult to approach: Dampier and two other fowlers having placed themselves in the evening near their retreat, surprized them so successfully as to kill fourteen at three shots, <HI>Roberts,</HI> in the <HI>Hist.

<P>Their flesh is highly esteemed. Catesby com∣pares its delicacy to that of the partridge: Dam∣pier says, that it has a very good flavour, though lean: Dutertre found it to be excellent, notwith∣standing a slight marshy taste.

One of these Flamingos, caught nearly in the same manner, lived fifteen years in our court-yard; it continued on good terms with the poultry, and even caressed its fellow∣lodgers, the turkies and ducks, by scratching their back with its bill. It fed on the same grain as the other poultry, provided that it was wetted with a little water; it could eat only by turning the bill to lay hold of its food sidewise: it dabbled like the ducks, and knew those persons so well who usually took care of it, that when hungry it went to them and pulled their clothes with its bill: it often kept itself mid-legs in water, seldom changing its place, and plunging from time to time its head to the bottom, to catch small fishes, which it prefers to grain. Sometimes it ran on the water, striking it alternately with its claws, and support∣ing itself by the motion of its wings half extended. It was not fond of swimming, but only of puddling with its feet in shallow water. When it fell, it rose with great difficulty; and accordingly it never rested on its belly to sleep: it only drew one of its legs under it, leaned upon the other, passed its neck upon its back, and concealed its head between the end of its wing and its body, always on the side opposite to the leg which was bent.”</Q> <HI>Letter from M.

for though very wild in the state of liberty, the Flamingo, when once caught, is submissive, and even affectionate. In fact, it has rather a timo∣rous than a lofty spirit; and the same fear which prompts it to fly, subdues it after it is taken. The Indians have completely tamed them. M. De Peiresc saw them very familiar, since he gives several particulars of their domestic life. They eat more in the night, he says, than in the day, and soak their bread in water. They are sensi∣ble to cold, and creep so close to the fire as to burn their feet; and when one leg is disabled,
<PB N="448" REF="491"/>
they walk on the other, and assist their motion by using their bill like a crutch on the ground. They sleep little, and rest only on one leg, the other being drawn under the belly. Yet they are delicate, and difficult to rear in our cli∣mates: it appears even, that, though pliant to the habits of captivity, that state is very unsuitable to their nature, since they cannot support it long, but drag out a languishing existence; for they never propagate when re∣duced to domestication.</P>
