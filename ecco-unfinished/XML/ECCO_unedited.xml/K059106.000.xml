And at once con∣vince you how just a Sense I have of your Worth and Honour; That you are a Gentleman of a most profound Judgement, every Action of your Life is a sufficient Testimony: But since you have kindly condescended to distract the poor Players with your Understanding, you are become an inimitable Original In short, Sir, there's no doing you Justice; thou excellent young Man.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I am to depend intirely on the Favours of the Town; I think 'tis necessary to give publick Reasons for publick Proceedings.</P>
<P>During the Rehearsal of the following Work, call'd, <HI>The Art of Management;</HI> or, <HI>Tragedy expell'd</HI>. I heard from different Hands that I was to suffer from Civil Power, for exhibiting a Satyr on the Managers of <HI>Drury Lane</HI>. Now, Whether any one about Town know such Persons as Squire <HI>Brainless</HI>, or Mr. <HI>Bloodbolt</HI>, is doubtful; for I solemnly protest I don't; I can't but say that I think the Name of <HI>Brainless</HI> very applicable to a <HI>Blockhead</HI>, as that of <HI>Bloodbolt</HI> may be to a <HI>Bully</HI>. And if there are any People in the World who act in real Life, as those two Characters are suppos'd to do, I am certain they must be very much confounded and ashamed to acknowledge themselves piqued tho' the Cap should sit.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>And as for satyrizing the Managers, I don't know that there are any Persons there who can properly claim that Title, for since the two Gentle∣men (who governed six Years ago) have been dead, and the other quitted it, I don't know any one Circumstance that has look'd like Order or Decorum during that Time, (a few Months ex∣cepted) but of that I shall say no more; lest I grow vain (or at least thought to be so) in Com∣mendation of one who truly deserves my Praise.</P>
<P>As to the Farce, if any Gentleman thinks him∣self touch'd home, or but slightly glanced at, let me advise him to keep his Sentiments to himself.</P>
<P>A prudent Man wou'd I'm sure; and he must be a most egregious Fool who wou'd reject my Council.</P>
<P>But now I shall proceed to give a just Account of the Manner of my being discharged, as to the Reasons, that will be as difficult a Task for me as for the Gentleman who did it; for he has often spoke of me as one, whom he thought, worth Ac∣ceptance (as a Player) in any Theatre; therefore, any contrary Reason after such a Declaration wou'd be ridiculous; but I had a Letter sent me, to inform me, the Charge being too high, made it necessary to lessen i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by dismissing me. I confess it was what I did not in the least expect, as being ignorant of having deserved it; when a Motion was made for my being recall'd, tho' not by me; I was refused, and it was not long before we lest off playing; (that I at a Quarter of an Hour's Warning, twice read two capital Parts, <HI>viz.</HI> The Queen in <HI>Essex</HI>, and another Night <HI>Cleopatra)</HI>
<PB REF="7"/>
which, I believe, I did not appear scandalous in, if I may be allowed to judge by the good Nature of the Audience, tho' on such Occasions they are generally tender to young Players.</P>
<P>I can't but say 'tis hard to be deprived of the Means of an honest Livelihood, without giving some immediate Provocation; and for my private Misconduct, which it seems, has been (for want of a better alledged as a Reason) tho' a bad one; for while my Follies only are hurtful to my self, I know no Right that any Persons, unless Relations, or very good Friends, have to call me to Account. I'll allow private Virtues heighten publick Merits, but then the Want of thòse private Virtues wont affect an Actors Performance.</P>
<P>And for me, tho' I confess it with a Blush, I have paid so little Regard to my self, that I ra∣ther have made my Faults too conspicuous, than that I have conceal'd them; so the Town will hardly be surpriz'd at what they have been so long acquainted with.</P>

<HEAD>An Occasional PROLOGUE Spoken by Mrs. CHARKE.</HEAD>
<L>WHEN the first Pair from Paradice were driv'n,</L>
<L>They si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h'd, thly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ept, and mourn'd their latest Heav'n</L>
<L>With Grief unbounded, left their native Seat,</L>
<L>While resounding Echos, did their Woes repeat,</L>
<L>I, like them from ancient <HI>Drury</HI> expell'd,</L>
<L>Why I know not, yet helpless to be repeal'd,</L>
<L>To this poor Refuge, unwillingly I flew,</L>
<L>And humbly refer my hapless Cause to you;</L>
<L>When injured then the worst Judges we become,</L>
<L>And partial to our selves heighten our Oppressor's Doom,</L>
<L>No, I rather chuse your Pity than your Scorn▪</L>
<L>Of all Ills that's the hardest to be born,</L>
<L>That I have Faults unlimited, I do confess,</L>
<L>Yet that, makes not the Wrong of o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers less;</L>
<L>All my Hopes do on your Smiles depend,</L>
<L>Nay, my bounded Wishes ask no o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Friend;</L>
<L>Since exil'd thus from my dear native Land,</L>
<L>And cast on Fortune's Stream; afford a saving Hand.</L>
<L>Your friendly Pity I must earnestly implore,</L>
<L>And tenderly assist to waft me to the Shore,</L>
<L>With uwearied Toil I'll hourly strive to please,</L>
<L>If successful think't a Conquest gain'd with Ease,</L>
<L>To your good Nature ever pay a just Regard,</L>
<L>And think each Effort too little for the sweet Reward.</L>

<P>Truly, Sir, very poorly. All our best Players are discharged, and those that know nothing at all of the Matter, are— to have their Salaries rais'd!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Head.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I find our wise Manager is resolv'd his Players should not put him out of Counte¦nance, by having more Wit than himself?</P>

<P>For my part, I am in a perfec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Maze! And for my Soul can't see what he▪ driving at!— Prithee! what is this new Co¦medy we are to rehearse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh, a most elegant Entertainment, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assure ye! 'Tis a Performance which can't chus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but please!

And I believe the first o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its kind that ever was exhibited. 'Tis to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> performed by Merry Andrews, Monkies, Bears and Prize-Fighters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Head.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Monstrous! that Acting should be se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon such a wretched Footing! but 'tis im¦possible the Town can encourage it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Dict.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Egad! Sir, they had better; for M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<HI>Bloodbolt</HI> wrote the Thing; and the Town must all meet him at the <HI>Bear-Garden</HI>, if they offer to disapprove it; nay we have some of that Fraternity placed here, as Box and Gal∣lery-Keepers, to frighten the Audience into Applause.!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Head.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If the Town don't rise in Arms against these Proceedings, it never deserves a decent Entertainment again; but I have some private Reasons to believe, that this won't hold long, and that you'll see a new Face of Business here shortly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Dict.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O! for that Matter, Sir, I have seen above twenty this Morning already; — Why we have got all the Merry Andrews from <HI>Bar∣tholomew</HI> Fair; and I believe in a little Time, we shall have Rope dancing to entertain the Audience, while the House is filling.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Head.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not unlikely truly!— But pray can you give a List of those discharg'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, I believe I have 'em all down, but there's one who has her Discharge whom you don't suspect! Mrs. <HI>Tragie—!</HI></P>

<P>How did she receive it.</P>

<P>O! most heroically! for she conceal'd her Surprize as much as possible, but pity'd our Managers want of Judgment, more than her own Disappointment.!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Glidew.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>DEar Mrs. <HI>Pinwell</HI>, you know 'tis not in my Power to speak for you, for Mr. <HI>Brainless</HI> is endeavouring every Day to find out a Clause in my Articles, that he may discharge me too: Nay, sometimes sends for me to practice a new Dance of a <HI>Sun∣day</HI> Morning, (which, to say Truth, I never deny'd doing, because he shou'd not have the Pleasure of making that a Plea, for getting rid of me.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very hard, that I who have been these 10 Years in the House, shou'd be turn'd out, without any Reason. I am sure, Madam, you can witness for me, I never have once been guilty of Neglect, and really I think I know my Business as well as Mrs. <HI>Pinwell!</HI> who came in, but last Season! I know well enough why she's a Favourite! People are not blind! Let her think as she pleases! However least said is soonest mended! For my Part, I value my self as much in my Stuff-Gown, as she in her Silks and her Velvet Manteel. Well! kissing goes by Favour! So I'll say no more! However,
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Ma'am, if you can serve me, I shall be migh∣tily oblig'd to ye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Glide.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed 'tis quite out of my Power, therefore don't depend on me; however I'll put you in a Way, which is, to apply to Mr. <HI>Diction</HI> the Prompter, for he is prime Mini∣ster, now I assure ye, and his Word goes farther than any Body's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I give you many Thanks, Ma'am, you know, Ma'am, if 'twas your own Case, you'd think it mighty hard Ma'am! But I am vastly oblig'd to you, Ma'am! for your Advice, Ma'am! and, will certainly take it, Ma'am! I thank you, Ma'am, a thousand Times. <STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Glide.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>DEar Mr. <HI>Bloodbolt!</HI> when are we to begin, I have been above two Hours in the House, and there's nothing done yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Blood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well! when you have stay'd two Hours longer, may be there may be more done, then! Zounds! are you not paid for being here!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Glide.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lard, Sir! don't swear! you really fancy your self at the Head of your <HI>Bear-Gar∣den</HI> Troop — I'm not us'd to such Language, not I, nor I won't bear it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Blood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you may leave it! Damme!
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
who cares! A parcel of senseless Women are to be eternal Plagues to a Man! And then when he dislikes it.—Truly I won't bear it!— And I'll stay no longer— 'Sblood! and a good Riddance! — I'll engage to furnish the House with a much better Company, and at a cheaper Rate, ay, and have Business carried on as it shou'd be; — I'll make a Bear Play, Pierrot, or a Monkey, Harlequin, that shall out-do any we have now upon the Stage!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Glide.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For that Matter, Sir, I don't doubt seeing your own Cook-Maid, exhibiting a Tra∣gedy Queen before its long; and your Ostler play Sir <HI>Harry Wildair!</HI></P>

<P>Well, well; bring 'em to the Office— I hir'd 'em Yesterday, when they were upon the Bellcony's — Cleaver Fellows faith! Damme! we'll let the Town see, what they never saw before. I warrant 'em!</P>

<P>And ten to one never will desire to see again!— Mercy on me! there's Manage∣ment—O! how this poor House is fall'n! since I first knew it! — I swear my Heart akes to think on't.—Well, I'll e'en fit me down in

<SPEAKER><HI>Head.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, no more; Learn rather to make yourself a real Loss, to them, than a happy Riddance; will your acting ill make them, or yourself most. Let Reason get the better of these mad Passions! and be advis'd by me. You know I wish you well; and as you are ally'd to me, consequently, have you more at Heart.</P>
