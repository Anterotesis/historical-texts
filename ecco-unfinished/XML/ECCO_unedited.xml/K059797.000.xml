<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T the first Appearance of this Treatise, I make no Doubt of its being taken for such another Ro∣mance as <HI>Robinson Cruso;</HI> but whoever expects to find here the sine Inventions of a prolifick Brain will be de∣ceiv'd; for so far as every Body concern'd in the Publication knows, it is nothing else but a plain, honest Narrative of Matter of Fact. The Original was wrote by <HI>Robert Drury,</HI> which consisting of eight Quires in <HI>Folio,</HI> each of near an hundred Pages, it was ne∣cessary to contract it, and put it in a more agreeable Method: But he constantly attended the Transcriber, and also the Printer, so that the utmost Care has been taken to be well in∣form'd of every dubious, strange, and intri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te Circumstance. And as to the large Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of Credit which we give him, it will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sound not to arise from an implicit Faith, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every Thing he might think proper to re∣late;
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
but from the strong Proof the Matters related receive by concurring Testimony, and the Nature of the Thing.</P>
<P>I at first wonder'd how Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> ven∣tur'd to say in his Certificate, <HI>That he believ'd the Account he gave of his surprising Adven∣tures to be true:</HI> But inquiring into the Cha∣racter of that Gentleman, I found him to he a Person of the highest Reputation for Inte∣grity and Honour; to which if we add, his known Solidity and good Sense, his Fortune, and Station of Life; there is no Room left to suppose he would countenance any trifling Fa∣bles or Impositions; yet this did not fully sa∣tisfy me, till diligently perusing the History, we find at <HI>Yong-Owl,</HI> where he took the Author on Board, <HI>William Purser</HI> was their Linguist for several Months, and he speaking <HI>English</HI> perfectly, 'tis not doubted but this Gentleman, as well as the Captains of the other Ships, in∣form'd themselves by his Means all they could of so singular and remarkable a Case. Now 'tis to be observ'd, that this <HI>William Purser</HI> was a Native of <HI>Feraingher,</HI> knew Mr. <HI>Drury</HI> there, and was an Eye-Witness to his carry∣ing the <HI>Elodge</HI> in their Expedition to <HI>Antern∣droea,</HI> and to several other the other most doubtful Circumstances here related, and his Adventures for several Years together.</P>
<P>After this, the Captain went to <HI>Munnon∣garo,</HI> alias <HI>Massalege,</HI> where he saw <HI>Nich Dove,</HI> one of the Boys ship-wreck'd in the <HI>De∣grave,</HI> and sav'd in the Massacre in <HI>Antern¦droca;</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
so that it was in the Captain's Power to come at more than two Thirds of what is contain'd in this History, besides the Opportu∣nity of conversing with him in their long Voy∣age to the <HI>West Indies,</HI> and after to <HI>England.</HI> The second Voyage which <HI>Drury</HI> made was al∣so in Capt. <HI>Macket</HI>'s Service, tho' not in the Ship commanded by himself; yet he was a principal Proprietor in the Ship and Cargo commanded by Capt. <HI>White,</HI> as well as of his own and some others; the Captain also con∣firm'd this to me in Conversation, adding <HI>That he had seen others in his last Voyage there, as well Natives who spake</HI> English <HI>and knew</HI> Drury, <HI>as some who were sav'd by Flight with Capt.</HI> Drummond, <HI>with this material Particular, That this very Captain</HI> Drummond <HI>was the Man whom</HI> Drury <HI>sup∣poses him to be; and that he was kill'd at</HI> Tullea, <HI>seven Leagues to the Northward of</HI> Augustine Bay, <HI>by one</HI> Lewes, <HI>a Jamaica Negro.</HI> This Gentleman continu'd his Friend∣ship for <HI>Drury,</HI> even to be his Patron to this Day, which he wou'd not have done, had he not known him to be a Person of Innocence and Probity, tho' his own well-known Life and Conversation does sufficiently demonstrate this; so that on the whole, I think, we have no Reason to doubt his Veracity in any mate∣rial Circumstance.</P>
<P>The Account here given of the Religion of these People, may be thought by some to be in∣vented by the Transcriber to serve an End, or
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
Inclination of his own, but so far is this from being the Case, that the most to-be-suspected Part of the Account of this Religion is Fact, as related by <HI>Drury;</HI> and particularly the re∣markable Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>errence with <HI>Deaan Murnan∣zack,</HI> his ridiculing of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Rib, <HI>God's talking with Men, making the World in six D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys, and resting the seventh</HI> his taking these Things for childish Notions of <HI>Drury</HI>'s, and more especially saying and repeating <HI>they were old Women Stories,</HI> are no other than thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prince's own Words, and were more str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngly confirm'd with Additions of the same Nature, on strictly examining and interroga∣ting the Author; whose Character and Circum∣stances are also to be consider'd, as that he was but <HI>14</HI> Years of Age when he embark'd on this unfortunate Voyage, his being educated at a <HI>Grammer-School,</HI> and in the <HI>Religion of the Establish'd Church;</HI> that ever since he came home he has firmly adher'd to the same▪ even to <HI>Bigotry;</HI> so that it wou'd be a Weakness to imagine he was able or willing to invent any such Thing, which might fa∣vour <HI>Free thinking,</HI> or <HI>Natural Religion,</HI> in Opposition to <HI>Reveal'd;</HI> since they were Mat∣ters he scarce ever troubl'd himself to enquire after. And in all those Places where <HI>Religi∣on</HI> is touch'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>Govern∣ment,</HI> the Transcriber is only answerable for puting some Reflections in the Author's Mout<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which as it is the only Artifice here us'd, he makes no Scruple to own, and confess that he
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
could not pass such remarkable and agree∣able Topicks without making proper Appli∣cations, and taking useful Instructions from them; yet the Love of these Subjects has not induc'd the Transcriber to alter any Facts, or add any Fiction of his own; Mr. <HI>Drury</HI> must answer for every Occurrence, the Cha∣racter of every Person, his Conversation or Business with them.</P>
<P>There are Authors, who pretend to say the Religion of these People is <HI>Mahometanism;</HI> from what they drew this Conclusion, or where they had their Information is unknown to me; since their <HI>Sacrifices, Antipathy to Revelation,</HI> and the <HI>Only Place where a</HI> Moorish <HI>Ship, who are</HI> Mahometans <HI>come, Swine's Flesh is eaten;</HI> obviously shew there can be nothing in more direct Opposition to it: There is no one Circumstance like it ex∣cept <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and that is well known by those learn'd in ancient History, to have been common to some <HI>Eastern Nations,</HI> even before the <HI>Jews</HI> had it; and where there is no Reason to think the Name of the <HI>Jews</HI> was ever heard. (For they were an inconsi∣derable People, consin'd by their own Laws to themselves, unskill'd in Arts and Sciences, and useless to the World.) And of this there is more Proof than what <HI>Herodotus</HI> says, as well as from the Reason of the Thing; for there is a Separation of a white Excrement always made behind the <HI>Glans,</HI> and if the <HI>Prepuce</HI> so closely covers it that it cannot be
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
expell'd, it corrodes, frets, and causes dange∣rous Inflamations. There is also a grievous Disorder sometimes happens to Children, the Heat of their Water so excoriating the <HI>Prepuce,</HI> that it joyns, and grows together in form of a Bladder, holding the <HI>Urine</HI> that it cannot pass, till the <HI>Prepuce</HI> is cut; besides the Injuries to Generation, which oblige People to undergo the Operation at an advanc'd Age; so that these Inconveni∣ences and Pain, which are very often found in hot Countries, have put Men on this Invention to prevent it in their Children.</P>
<P>But I am ready to suspect, we shall have more Reason presently to think, the <HI>Jews</HI> de∣riv'd a great deal from them, instead of they from the <HI>Jews;</HI> that their Religion is more ancient, is evident from several obvious Rea∣sons. <HI>First,</HI> By their regarding Dreams, and divining by them, which, so early as the <HI>Mosaical</HI> Law, the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were warn'd against. <HI>2dly,</HI> These People shave their Hair all off in mourning for the Dead: This <HI>Moses</HI> expresly commands the <HI>Isralites</HI> not to do. And the <HI>Jews</HI> do still superstitiously observe This, and suffer their Hair to grow in their Mourning. I was going to quote two or three Texts in <HI>Numbers, Deuteronomy, &amp;c.</HI> but on Consideration find it would be endless and unnecessary; for from almost the Beginning of <HI>Genesis,</HI> thro' the Pentateuch and all other the Narrative, as well as preceptive Part of the Old Testament are full of Instances of this Nature. <HI>3dly, Moses</HI> commanded none but
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
Males to be sacrificed; on the contrary, these sacrifice <HI>Cows</HI> for the most Part. The Sacri∣fices here are not accompanied with many Ce∣remonies which it is plain were added after∣wards. On this Island they are only Feasts with the Addition of a very little Superstition: They have no burnt Offerings; but near their Sepulchres, which with Gums burnt likewise, may only arise from a Defence against cada∣verous Scents. <HI>4thly,</HI> But the most remarka∣ble Instance of all is, that the <HI>Owley,</HI> which these <HI>Madagascar</HI> People use to divine by, and procure extraordinary Dreams with, is evi∣dently the <HI>Ephod</HI> and <HI>Teraphim,</HI> which the <HI>Levite</HI> us'd, who liv'd in <HI>Micah</HI>'s House, see <HI>Judges 17.</HI> And which the <HI>Israelites</HI> could never be wholly brought off from, tho' contra∣ry to their Law; for it was against the Com∣mand, that <HI>Abimelech,</HI> the Priest, consulted an <HI>Ephod</HI> for <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>I am very sensible that some have taken these <HI>Teraphim</HI> for Images like a Man; and there is a shew of Reason in it from <HI>Mi∣chal, S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul</HI>'s Daughter's putting One in <HI>Da∣vid</HI>'s Bed to deceive her Father's Messengers whilst he escap'd; tho' I am rather inclin'd to think it alludes to some Divination by the <HI>Teraphim,</HI> which she us'd in his Behalf; for <HI>Teraphim</HI> is the plural Number, therefore could not fignifie only one Image: Neither could the gods which <HI>Rachel</HI> stole from her Father <HI>Laban,</HI> be one god as big as a Man; for she sat on them, and hid them. The Word is here in the Original, <HI>Teraphim,</HI> tho' tran∣slated
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
<HI>gods:</HI> Then in <HI>Hosea, c. iii. v. 4. an Image,</HI> an <HI>Ephod</HI> and <HI>Teraphim</HI> are all mention'd in one Versc, plainly shewing, that they are distinct Things. It is further to be remark'd, that by this <HI>Teraphim</HI> they in∣vok'd the Dead, which is exactly the same as these People do by the <HI>Owley,</HI> always invok∣ing the Spirits of their Fore-fathers, which is expressly forbid to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> and often sharply in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eigh'd against by the Prophets: Those, who have any Pleasure in Reading <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Superstitions of the <HI>Jewish Cabbalists,</HI> may find a great deal of this Kind of Divi∣nation by <HI>Ephod</HI> and <HI>Teraphim;</HI> and that these Spirits are Messengers, who go in the Night to God, and bring back Messages.</P>
<P>This is exactly the very Notion these Peo∣ple have of their <HI>Owleys:</HI> If there should be any Reason to suppose an Image was meant by this <HI>Teraphim,</HI> it would not much alter the Case; for after the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and other Nations improv'd in Sculpture, as well as in other Arts, they might come to carving it into an Image; but this <HI>Owley</HI> is plainly the Ori∣ginal; we find <HI>Ephod</HI> and <HI>Teraphim</HI> join'd together in several Places of Scripture; now an <HI>Ephod</HI> is well known to be <HI>a little Linnen Garment,</HI> and this <HI>Owley</HI> being fix'd to a Swash, finely adorn'd, for a Man to wear, is evidently the same as <HI>Ephod</HI> and <HI>Teraphim;</HI> and whether the High-Priest's fine <HI>Ephod,</HI> and <HI>Breast-plate,</HI> with <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> was not an Improvement from this Original,
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
is no absurd Question, or rather no Question at all; for 'tis evident it was for the same Uses; <HI>(viz.)</HI> to <HI>wear,</HI> and <HI>divine by.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may see the original of the Noti∣on of familiar Spirits, which has been still further improv'd by the <HI>Chimeras</HI> of Witch∣craft, Sorcery, and the like; all which have no other Foundation, than on the Notion of the Spirits, which these People say attend their <HI>Owleys,</HI> as Messengers to God, and arises from Mens dreaming often naturally, and sometimes, significantly (at least, most are apt to think so;) and this is no more than a Superstitious En∣deavour to do it profitably for Advice, and Fore-knowledge in Emergencies.</P>
<P>That these People had not their Religion from any polite, or learn'd Nation, is plain by their retaining no Notion, or Memory of Letters; nor their having a Horse amongst them, or so necessary a Machine as a Wheel of any kind, either for Carriage, or other Use, which could never have been forgot, had they ever had it. That these <HI>Madagascar</HI> People came first from <HI>Africa</HI> is certain, by their Co∣lour; and, perhaps, from the <HI>Abyssines,</HI> or even from <HI>Aegypt.</HI> The <HI>Virzimbers,</HI> indeed, by their woolly Heads, must come from the more Southern Part of <HI>Africa;</HI> Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> says, <HI>Deaan Toak-Offu</HI> told him they had a Tra∣dition of their Coming on the Island many Ages ago in large Canoes: But let them come from where they will, it is evident that their Religion is the most antient in the known World,
<PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
and not much remov'd from pure natural Re∣ligion; and whether the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and the <HI>Canaanites</HI> had their Religion from them, or that they are <HI>Aegyptians</HI> originally, it had its Rise long before the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were in Bondage; for <HI>Egypt</HI> was then a very polite Country; and also to be remembred, that they were not <HI>Idolaters</HI> any more than their Neigh∣bours before <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Time. It is worth observing, that <HI>Melchizedech</HI> was a King, and call'd the Priest of the Most High God, a Phrase which exactly corresponds to <HI>Deaan Unghorray,</HI> or the Highest God; as does al∣so this Custom of the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Kings, or Lords, who perform themselves all the reli∣gious Offices, where the Publick is concern'd.</P>
<P>I can but just touch on these Things, yet these Hints, tho hasty, and undigested, may o∣pen a Door to such a Discovery of the Original of practical Religion as well reveal'd as natural, as is little expected. We have al∣ready exceeded the Number of Sheets design'd for this Book, and too long delay'd the Publi∣cation; so that on no Account, can I at pre∣sent examine Authors proper to be consulted; but am oblig'd, unwillingly to leave this a∣greeable Enquiry; yet not without Thoughts of reassuming it: A Gentleman of undoubted In∣tegrity, and good Sense, having given me Hopes of some curious Remarks he has made in the most unknown Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> up in several Parts of the Country, at a Distance from the Sea: Where the People have not been
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
corrupted by <HI>Europeans,</HI> he has found them to be Innocent, Humane, and Moral; as he also confirm'd the Account our Author has gi∣ven of These.</P>
<P>But as much haste as I am in, I must not pass over the Observation, That Men in the State of Nature, and considering God as the Author of the Universe, form no other Noti∣ons of him, but what are consistent with <HI>Ju∣stice, Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Goodness:</HI> They see him to have perfectly finish'd his Work, and that he wants no Alterations, and Amendments, nor repents of his Actions, as some would pre∣tend, as if he did Things like weak, rash Mor∣tals inadvertently; much less can they bear to hear of the worst of Passions attributed to the perfect divine Being; such as Anger, Revenge, and Jealousie: God has given Men the Sense of tasting, to judge what Food is proper for the Support of Life; and as he has form'd them fit for Society, so he has given them Perception, and Reason to judge what will conduce most to their Peace and Happiness in social Communities; and we need look no fur∣ther for the Original of moral, and politick Laws, than to the most simple, and natural Sensations; (for I shall not call them Ideas) of Pleasure and Pain.</P>
<P>If we consider Mankind in his true natural State, we shall not see him as the <HI>Hobbists</HI> would ridicuously insinuate, who imagine only Men of the Male-kind fighting with one ano∣ther; on the Contrary, we find Mankind
<PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>
Male and Female, and the most ardent Appe∣tites will then plainly appear to be a Fondness for their Women, and a Tenderness for their Off-spring, and this is even common to them with some Brutes; and therefore the <HI>true State of Nature:</HI> From hence arise benign Dis∣positions, Softness of Temper and Friendships, these being more pleasant and safe than Quar∣relling, and Fighting; they natural improve and prosecute them, taking Care not to be di∣sturb'd in their Enjoyments. In this natural unsophisticated View of the Human Species, we shall find it to be impossible for forty Fa∣milies to subsist together, without some Com∣pact, or Agreement to punish, or expel Adul∣terers, Murderers, and Thieves, even for the Space of one Year (I had like to have said not one Quarter of the Time; but that it would have come too near twice forty Days.) The Respect due from Children to Parents is taught them early by those Parents, and grows up with them; besides the Gratitude naturally arising to those, who have fed, and protected them when they were helpless Infants; so that it is no wonder to find a Law here <HI>against cursing of Parents.</HI> The Notion of the Be∣ing of One supreme Author of Nature, arises from natural Reflections on the visible Har∣mony and Uniformity of the Universe, and seeing Men and Things did not produce them∣selves. The Reverence due to this Stupen∣dious Being, is only a pious, and rightly turn'd <HI>Amazement, Dread,</HI> and <HI>Respect;</HI>
<PB N="xv" REF="15"/>
so that it is as little wonderful as any Thing else that we find here, they swear <HI>not profanely.</HI> The Division of the Month arises from the Moon, and the full Moon divides it naturally in half; the other Di∣vision into Weeks or Quarters is a very small, if any Improvement; as to a Sab∣bath, these People have no Notion, the Day they allow their Slaves for themselves is not Weekly, but at Random, according to the Necessity of the Case, or Humanity of the Master: And why may not the <HI>Seventh</HI> have been allowed to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> when Slaves to the <HI>Aegyptians?</HI></P>
<P>It is with the most solèmn Delight I consi∣der the Devotion of these People, who seek God on every Occasion, for his Assistance in Necessity, and with Piety, and Gratitude return Thanks for Benefits; yet have they neither Temple, Tabernacle, Groves, or any other Places of Worship, neither Festival or any Set-Day, or Times, nor Priests to do it for them. The <HI>Umossees</HI> or Prophets indeed, direct the making their <HI>Owley</HI> of particular Roots, or Woods, having, as they tell them, Magical Properties agreeing to the Spirits; and also they must be made at proper Times: These have, introduo'd some trifling Superstitions; such as arise from the <HI>Weaknesses</HI> of human Nature, not the Vices of designing, tyrannical Priests; but they never yet dar'd to break in upon the great, and glorious Attributes of Wisdom,
<PB N="xvi" REF="16"/>
Perfection, and Goodness in the most high God; much less have they presum'd to af∣front the Reason of Mankind, and in∣terrupt their Happiness by so dangerous an Example, as predicating Immorality, and Passions of the supreme Author of our Be∣ing; a Consideration worthy the Regard of some People, to lead them to look into themselves, and see if in introducing their artificial Systems of Religion, they have not dishonour'd God as much as Man can do, and corrupted Mankind.</P>
<P>Let none think this Account of their Reli∣gion is taken only on Mr. <HI>Drury</HI>'s Credit, for the Island is of late much frequented; and as many People as have been there might be brought to prove as much as is necessary to justify the foregoing Observations. <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Morals of the People, their Circumci∣sion, Sacrificing, and Use of these <HI>Owleys;</HI> also on the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> for many hun∣dred Leagues, they have such a like Ma∣chine call'd there <HI>Fetiss,</HI> and use it in Reli∣gious Offices, as I also have seen, tho' I had no Opportunity to examine enough into it: They are also where <HI>Europeans,</HI> or <HI>Maho∣metans</HI> have not corrupted them; <HI>Innocent, Moral,</HI> and <HI>Humane.</HI></P>

<HI>MADAGASCAR:</HI> OR, <HI>Robert Drury</HI>'S JOURNAL DURING Fifteen Years Captivity on that ISLAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y Design, in the ensuing History, is to give a plain and honest Narrative of Matters of Fact; I shall not, therefore, make use of any artful Inventions or bor∣row'd Phrases to lengthen or embellish it; nor shall I offer any other Reflections than what naturally occurr'd from my many uncommon and surprising Adventures. And,</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="19"/>
I hope, it will not be improper to acquaint my Readers, that I was not fourteen Years of Age when these Miseries and Misfortunes first befel me; so that my Youth as well as Igno∣rance of the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Language, render'd me incapable of making those many curious Obser∣vations, which One of a riper Age and better Judgment (freed from Slavery) might have done with less Difficulty, and to much greater Advantage. For,</P>
<P>I, <HI>ROBERT DRƲRY,</HI> was born on the 24th of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1687. in <HI>Crutched Fryars, London,</HI> where my Father then liv'd; but soon after remov'd to the <HI>Old Jury</HI> near <HI>Cheap-side,</HI> where he was well known and es∣teem'd for keeping that noted House, call'd <HI>The King's Head,</HI> or otherwise distinguish'd by the Name of the <HI>Bcef-Stake House;</HI> and to which there was all my Father's Time a great Resort of Merchants and Gentlemen of the best Rank and Character.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the Education my Father bestow'd on me, I cou'd not be brought to think of any Art, Science, Trade, Busi∣ness, or Profession of any kind whatsoever, but <HI>Going to Sea:</HI> And as soon as I was capable of answering any Questions propounded to me concerning what Business or Profession my Ge∣nius led me to, I discover'd no Inclination to any thing but <HI>the Sea.</HI> And I well remember
<PB N="3" REF="20"/>
that from Eleven Years of Age, my Mind had taken such an unhappy Bent this Way, that it grew with my Stature, and at length be∣came an obstinate Resolution; and not all the tender Insinuations of my dear and indulgent Mother, tho' she once intreated me on her Knees, nor the Perswasions of my tender Fa∣ther, and other Friends, could make any Im∣pression on me.</P>
<P>WHEN they found their Endeavours were in vain, they then try'd another Method, and by a seeming Compliance with my Desire, did propose, and would have procur'd a short Voy∣age for me; hoping that the Dangers I should be liable to, and the Hardships I should see others suffer, would terrify me from persist∣ing in that Course of Life. But,</P>
<P>SUCH was my unhappy Obstinacy, that no∣thing would serve me, but what was for my Ruin; and Providence herein justly punish'd my Disobedience, by granting me the foolish Choice I had wickedly made, in direct Oppo∣sition to my Duty, and the earnest Entrea∣ties of my Friends. Thus did this Perverse∣ness of mine bring along with it its own Pains and Punishment. Nothing but an <HI>East India</HI> Voyage wou'd serve my Turn; for no other Reason that I know of, but because I had a Cousin at <HI>Bengal,</HI> whose Name was <HI>John Steel,</HI> in the New <HI>East India</HI> Company's Service; it being before the Companies were united.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="21"/>
MY Father shew'd his Care and Tender∣ness for me by his manner of fitting me out, plentifully supplying me with the usual extra∣ordinary Provisions, and all other Necessaries for the Voyage; besides these, I had a Cargo to the Value of an hundred Pounds, which was a very sufficient one for a Boy of my Age. I went as a Passenger, well recommended to Capt. <HI>William Younge,</HI> my Passage and Freight of Cargo were agreed for, and we embark'd.</P>
<P>THE Ship which Captain <HI>Younge</HI> commanded in this unfortunate Voyage was the <HI>DEGRAVE,</HI> of 700 Tuns Burden, and mounted 52 Guns. I am not going to give an Account of any of the common Occurrences of the Voyage, or to take Notice of more than two or three extraordi∣nary Accidents, and of what only is necessary to lead to my Purpose; which is the History of our Fate on <HI>Madagascar</HI> in our Return home∣ward, together with my own Miseries and Va∣riety of Fortune during fifteen Years space in that scarce known, tho' large Country.</P>
<P>WE pass'd through the <HI>Downs</HI> on <HI>Feb.</HI> 19. 1701. when Admiral <HI>Bembo</HI> (whose Son, Mr. <HI>John Bembo,</HI> was fourth Mate of our Ship) lay there with the Squadron of Ships under his Command bound to the <HI>West Indies;</HI> and we ar∣riv'd at Fort <HI>St. George</HI> in the <HI>East Indies,</HI> in three Months and twenty Days from the <HI>Downs,</HI> having stopp'd in our Passage one Week at the
<PB N="5" REF="22"/>
<HI>Canaries;</HI> and came to an Anchor there in the Evening.</P>
<P>WE had on board Monsieur <HI>Lapie,</HI> a Jeweller, and his Son, who went designedly to settle there; and one would have thought, being so near the End of his Voyage, he had great Rea∣son to hope, or rather to be assur'd, he had obtain'd his Desire; the Ship being safe at Anchor in Sight of the Place, and within half a dozen Miles. But see how Providence disap∣points us, and interrupts our Designs! and what an adverse and merciless Fate directed, and accompany'd this unhappy Ship, and all concern'd in it!</P>
<P>THE Barge was hoisted out the next Morn∣ing, in order to put these unfortunate People on Shoar; we rode about two Leagues off. They put off, and we did not expect their Return till the next Day; but about eight a Clock at Night a Voice was heard hailing the Ship; it surpris'd our People, but some of them soon knew it to be the Voice of <HI>Jo∣seph Chamberlain,</HI> who was one of the Barge's Crew: They hoisted out the Pinnace, and rowing towards the Voice, found him swim∣ming on an Oar, who told us, that as soon as they came to the <HI>Bar,</HI> a great <HI>Sea</HI> struck them on the Lar-board Side, and over-set her; he could see nothing what became of the rest of the Company, and suppos'd they
<PB N="6" REF="23"/>
were all drowned; for the Current set to Sea∣ward, but he, being a good Swimmer, and with the help of one of the Boat's Oars which he happen'd on, made shift to fetch with∣in Call of the Ship: We immediately hung a Light on the Top-Mast Head to guide others, if happily, any had been like him alive and swimming; but no more of them were ever seen, or heard of. There perish'd by this Dis∣aster Mr. <HI>John Lapie,</HI> his Son, and their Cook, the Coxswain and nine of the Boat's Crew; they had also with them very considerable Effects in Goods, Silver, &amp;c. to some thou∣sand Pounds Value.</P>
<P>Two Days after we weigh'd Anchor, and sail'd to <HI>Maslapatan,</HI> where we staid a Month, and from thence to <HI>Bengall.</HI> My Cousin hear∣ing I was arriv'd came on board to see me, and to take me and my Effects on Shoar with him; but my Father had a more prudent Regard to my Welfare than I could be capa∣ble of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t those Years; for my Cousin being only a Pilot, my Father had desir'd Capt <HI>Younge</HI> to inform himself of his Circumstan∣ces, Fortune and Reputation, and if he found him not of sufficient Ability or Honesty to be entrusted with me and my Effects, that he should not let me go on Shoar to him.</P>
<P>THE Captain perform'd the Trust my Fa∣ther committed to him very honourably, and
<PB N="7" REF="24"/>
would not let me go with my Kinsman; but took my Cargo, and dispos'd of it himself, and bought me in Return the Commodities of the Country; and would have brought me back again according to his Contract with my Fa∣ther, had Providence permitted him. My Cou∣sin soon after our Arrival dy'd, and we had a great Mortality amongst our Ship's Crew; for during our Stay here which was nine Months, we bury'd above forty of our People: The Chief Mate was the first of Note, and about a Month after him Captain <HI>Younge</HI> himself dy'd of a Fever, happy at least in this, that he dy'd in Peace, and liv'd not to bear his Part in the many Miseries which his Son, and we under∣went afterwards; for this Son being second Mate, and the Chief Mate being already dead, and now the Captain his Father, he became Captain of Course; so that there was still a Captain <HI>Younge.</HI></P>
<P>THE only Good which I got at <HI>Bengall,</HI> and which prov'd of any Advantage to me after∣wards, was, that I here learnt to swim, which has two or three times since sav'd my Life and Liberty; and I attain'd to be so great a Proficient in swimming by the help of good Companions, that it was a common Practice for half a dozen of us to tye a <HI>Rupee</HI> apiece (which is about the Value of 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> English) in an Handkerchief about our Middles, and
<PB N="8" REF="25"/>
swim four or five Miles up or down the Ri∣ver; and when we came on Shoar, the <HI>Gen∣tees</HI> or <HI>Moors</HI> would lend us Cloaths to put on while we staid; thus we us'd to sit and regale ourselves for a few Hours with Arrack Punch and a Dinner, and then swim back again.</P>
<P>OUR Business being at length finish'd at <HI>Ben∣gail,</HI> we sail'd from thence, and had at that Time about 120 Hands on board, besides two Women and myself, and a few other Passen∣gers; as we were going down the River our Ship ran aground and stuck fast; but a very strong Tide running, it turn'd her round and the next High-water we got off, and as we then thought without Damage; but when we came to Sea she prov'd so leaky, that we were forc'd to keep two Chain-Pumps conti∣nually going: We were two Months in this Condition, at length we fetcht <HI>Mauritius,</HI> which is an Island in the Latitude of 16½ South, and to the Eastward of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> inhabited by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who very civilly treated, and assisted us with all that was in their Power: We made a Tent on Shoar, in which we stow'd a great Part of our Cargo; for we took out as many of our Goods as we could, to search for the Leak, but could not find it.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>Boon,</HI> a Pyrate, had been here about two Months before, he having just then plunder'd a very rich <HI>Moorish</HI> Ship, and had taken
<PB N="9" REF="26"/>
out of her fifty <HI>Lascars.</HI> (For that is the Name which our <HI>English</HI> Seamen call these <HI>Moorish</HI> People by.) <HI>Boon</HI> lost his own Ship on this Island, and the Pyrates were glad to make a small Sloop of their Long-boat, to get off the Island with; and were therefore forc'd to leave the <HI>Lascars</HI> behind them. These People we took with us, thinking they would be of use, and save our Hands from returning so often to the Pump; they having for two Months before but little Rest.</P>
<P>WE found here very good <HI>Fish, Turtle, Goats,</HI> and some <HI>Beef;</HI> we staid about a Month, and then departed, shaping our Course directly for the Cape of <HI>Good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>THE Leak gain'd upon us more and more, and we had much adoe to keep her above Water: Our Men were all tired, and spent with continual Labour, pumping and bailing Night and Day, when by our reckoning we were 100 Leagues to the Southward of <HI>Ma∣dagascar:</HI> We heav'd over-board several of our Guns and heavy Goods to lighten her. The Captain was for keeping on his Course to the Cape, but the Ship's Company were all against it, being of Opinion, that they could not make her swim long enough, judging them∣selves at that time about 600 Leagues from it, and but 100 from <HI>Madagascar,</HI> which was the nearest Land.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="27"/>
WITH much Difficulty they at length pre∣vail'd with the Captain to put back to <HI>Ma∣dagascar.</HI> The Wind favouring us, the third Day in the Morning they sent me and the Captain's Boy up to the Mast-head to look out for Land, since they cou'd spare no Body else: In such Extremity of Life and Death, my being a Pas∣senger was not consider'd, and accordingly I went up, and sat there two Hours and an half before I spy'd any thing like Land; and when I first saw it I told my Companion, but not being sure would not call out; for the Case was of such Consequence, that there was no trifling, nor amusing them with vain Hopes. However, at length, I plainly discover'd a white Cliff, and a Smoak at a Distance from the Cliff; I then cry'd out <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, Land.</HI></P>
<P>SEVERAL then ran up the Shrouds, and even the Captain himself to see it; One amongst them knew the Land, and said it was <HI>Port Dauphine;</HI> and that the King of that Part of the Island was at Enmity with all white Men, and treated all the <HI>Europeans</HI> he met with very barbarously: The Reason of which, and a short History of King <HI>Samuel,</HI> (for that was his Name) I shall have Occasion here∣after to mention. This Information put us into the utmost Confusion and Despair, and was indeed our utter Ruin. The Man who inform'd us was right to the best of his Know∣ledge;
<PB N="11" REF="28"/>
for they were, indeed, Enemies to the <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and had murder'd all they could find on the Island, in Revenge for an Injury some of that Country had formerly done to King <HI>Samuel;</HI> but to no other white Men: So that had we put in there, we had at least sav'd our Lives, and some of our Cargo; but who can account for the Infatuation of Mankind when destin'd to their Destruction! Our Fate was six'd, and we were to be destroy'd in the most tragical Manner, and all our Endeavours to save ourselves serv'd only to prolong our Misery.</P>
<P><HI>Port Dauphine</HI> we durst not put into, for fear of falling immediately into the Hands of re∣vengeful and barbarous Murderers, as we then thought them: We could not get to the Northward, the Wind being North-East; nei∣ther was there any Harbour or Port to the West-ward, but what was a Week's sail to it. The Western Shoar is steep too.</P>
<P>HEREUPON the Captain resolv'd to steer a∣long the Western Coast, and see if he could find any Place fit to run her into, or put ashoar with Safety of our Lives. We were at length pretty near the Shoar, but no Place could be found, and her Hold was now half full of Water, the Men went to the Captain, and ask'd him what he design'd to do, for she could swim no longer. He went into the Round-house for a Minute or two, and when
<PB N="12" REF="29"/>
he came out he ask'd them, if they desir'd he should run the Ship on shore at all Hazards; to which they all assented, and cry'd out <HI>Any Thing to save our Lives.</HI> Now here was a Sand which ran along for two Leagues; we came within a quarter of a Mile of the Shoar, and let go an Anchor first without the Breakers, and then cut down all our Masts and our Rig∣ging, threw our Guns and Goods over-board, and try'd all the Means we could, to make her swim till we could get ourselves on Shoar. We had lost our Long-boat and Pinnace at <HI>Bengall,</HI> and had only one small Boat left, we therefore made a Raft with some Planks and Yards.</P>
<P>THERE were at that time some of the Na∣tives fishing, who seeing us in Distress, made a Smoak on Shoar to guide and invite us; but we had heard such a bad Character of the Country, that we could not tell what to ex∣pect from them, tho'we were inform'd this was another Prince's Dominions.</P>
<P>WE finish'd the Raft in the Night, and in the Morning sent Mr. <HI>Prat,</HI> our Chief Mate, and four Men in the Boat with a long Rope for a Warp, to fasten on the Land. Here a great Sea constantly runs on the Rocks, and before they got to the Land their Boat was stav'd in Pieces; but, being pretty near, by the help of some of the Negroes (Natives) they
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="30"/>
<P>p. 12</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="13" REF="31"/>
sav'd that part of the Boat to which the Rope was fasten'd: We had two <HI>English</HI> Women on board, one of them would not go on the Raft, not would the Captain; but the other Wo∣man, and about forty or fifty of us went: I stript myself of all my Cloaths, but took two Purses of Money and a silver Cup, and made them fast about my Middle; we haul'd by the Rope towards the Shoar, but were no sooner among the Breakers than the first Sea turn'd the Raft over, and wash'd us off; some swam to the Raft again, but were soon wash'd off; the Woman was drowned just by me, for I could not save her. I div'd under every Wave, and with great Difficulty got on Shoar, as did every Body else who were on the Raft, but the Woman. There was such a Surff run, and the Sea broke so high, that we durst not venture out to return the Raft; which the Cap∣tain observing, order'd the Cable to be cut, and let the Ship drive nearer the Land, where she soon beat to pieces: The Captain got on Shoar with his Father's Heart in his Hand, which, according to his Request when dying, was put in a Bottle, to be brought to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and bury'd at <HI>Dover.</HI> At length they all got on Shoar on Pieces of the Ship, Planks, &amp;c. except two Men who were drowned, and the Woman I mention'd before: The other Woman escap'd, tho' she was so full of Wa∣ter
<PB N="14" REF="32"/>
as well as some Others, that we were forc'd to roll and rub them well to make them dis∣gorge the Water; we laid them also before a great Fire made for that purpose, and in time reviv'd them. We were in all with the <HI>Lascars</HI> above one hundred and sixty.</P>
<P>THE Country began now to be alarm'd, and we had already two or three hundred Negroes about us, picking up Pieces of Silk and fine Callico; the Mussin they regarded not. Our Goods were driven ashoar in whole Bails, for what with Salt-petre and other Things, we rec∣kon'd there might be then left three hundred Tuns; notwithstanding what we threw over∣board at several times before.</P>
<P>THERE was one Negroe brought an Ox down to us, and made Signs that we should kill him; we sign'd to them to shoot him for us, for we had sav'd no Ammunition; which when one of them observ'd, he lent us his Gun ready loaded, with which one of our Men shot the Bullock.</P>
<P>IT was shocking, and even terrible to me, to see the Negroes cut the Beast, Skin and Flesh together, and sometimes the Guts too, then toss it into the Fire or Ashes, as it hap∣pen'd, and eat it half roasted; I did not know but they would devour us so; for they seem'd to me like what I had heard related of <HI>Canni∣bals:</HI> Every Thing before our Eyes appear'd
<PB N="15" REF="33"/>
horrid and frightful, and excited most dismal Thoughts and dreadful Expectations.</P>
<P>IF I here discover'd a little more Concern than became a Man, I hope my tender Years, little Knowledge and less Experience will ex∣cuse me: This tragical Scene made such a deep Impression on me, that when any Accident brings it to my Mind, I start, and am shock'd with the frightful Remembrance. If my Ob∣servations are not so many, or so just and good as they should be, they must not be look'd on to come from a Man, but a Boy; for as I grew in Years, it will appear, I grew in Know∣ledge and Courage, was capable of making more proper Remarks, and also of enterprising more hazardous and dangerous Things.</P>
<P>WHILE the Negroes were busy opening our Bails, and taking what they lik'd, I observ'd some of them regarded the Iron they found more than all those Goods which we call va∣luable; and took a great deal of Pains to break any pieces of Timber they met with, which had Iron in them. I broke open my Chest, and took out only one Suit of Cloaths, leaving the rest to whomsoever had a Mind to them.</P>
<P>WE remain'd thus two Days and Nights with∣out resolving on any one Thing, and not know∣ing what to do. We were told <HI>Port Dauphine</HI> was but 60 Miles from us, but the Notion we had of their being a barbarous People prevented our
<PB N="16" REF="34"/>
going thither; but this Debate was soon deter∣min'd for us by the Dean (or as our <HI>English</HI> Sailors call him) King of that Part of the Country.</P>
<P>FOR next Evening about Nine of the Clock, we heard a Man call out <HI>Ho-lo,</HI> at a great Di∣stance, like an <HI>Englishman</HI> (as he prov'd to be) who being answer'd came nearer, and ask'd <HI>Who we were.</HI> We told him the Crew of an <HI>English East-India</HI> Ship, which prov'd so leaky, that we were forc'd to run her in here, as the first Land we could make, to save our Lives. Hereupon he came to us, and being desir'd sat down with us by our Fire, and told the Captain that the King had sent him to tell us, We had no Reason to fear any Thing tho' we were in a strange Coun∣try; and that he would come down himself the next Day to see us. The Captain desir'd him to give us what Account he could of the Coun∣try and the Natives; and also how he came there. We all crowded about him, not so much out of Curiosity to hear a Novelty, as to be able to judge by his Relation, what our Fate was like to be: The Circumstances of his Story were so very remarkable, and so much concern'd us, that I dare say, I can give it you almost in his own Words; which were as follow.</P>
<P><Q>“”I am an <HI>English-man,</HI> born in the County of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> my Parents, and every Body
<PB N="17" REF="35"/>
who should have taken Care of me being dead, I went to Sea very young. My first Voyage was to the <HI>West Indies,</HI> but seeing much was not to be got there, I was re∣solv'd to try the <HI>East Indies,</HI> and going thi∣ther was taken by a Pirate about an hun∣dred Leagues to the East-ward of this Island: They plunder'd the Ship of all her Rig∣ging, Ammunition and Liquor; they took me and nine Men more out of her, and then let the Ship go. In the time I was with them they took some rich Prizes, and I seemingly join'd with them, since there was no Help to prevent it; we us'd to resort to this Island for Refreshments. I was soon tir'd of going a pyrating, and be∣ing at Anchor in <HI>Mattatan</HI> Road, where the Canoes came off as usual to sell us <HI>Rice, Plantins, Milk,</HI> and <HI>Honey,</HI> &amp;c. our Boat could not go ashoar, there is such a great Sea breaks upon the Strand; I took this Opportunity to feign myself sick, and un∣able to stand or walk: and sent such Word to the Captain (whose Name I must not declare being sworn to the contrary) de∣siring him to let me go on Shoar, hoping the Land Air would refresh me; to which he consented. I dress'd myself, and carry'd as much Gold and other rich Things as I could stow in my Pockets; but acquainted
<PB N="18" REF="36"/>
no Man with my Intention, because not one on Board shew'd any Inclination to leave their dangerous and villainous Engagements, I stepp'd into the Canoe with no little Sa∣tisfaction, thinking myself more happy in this Country, heathenish and barbarous as it is, than with my former Companions; the Captain sent a Canoe for me, but bad the Men tell him I was not capable of going to Sea any more; and he never sent again.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”I had been here about three Months, when Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> in a Merchant Ship, came to trade about the Island; three Days after his Arrival a Pyrate took him as he rode at Anchor: The Pyrates gave Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> his own Long-Boat, and a few Ne∣cessaries. There was one Capt. <HI>Steward</HI> with Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> him they permitted to go ashoar also, and three or four Hands more; it was very calm, and the Sea consequently moderate, so they got safe on Shoar. Here was at the same time another <HI>Englishman</HI> and his Wife, who came from <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> who were Company for me. When my Compa∣nion and I saw the Long-Boat come on Shoar, and the Ship sail away, we guess'd the Rea∣son, and went down to meet them, and to invite them to our Cottages, which were a Mile from the Sea-side. My Companion,
<PB N="19" REF="37"/>
by the Help of his Wife, was better provi∣ded to entertain them than myself; we could speak enough of the Language of the Country to deal with the Natives for what we wanted; which was a great Help to those who but just then arriv'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”CAPTAIN <HI>Drummond</HI> was very melancholy for the Loss of his Ship, and his being in such a remote and barbarous Place, and therefore resolv'd to get if possible to St. <HI>Augustine</HI> Bay, which is a Place where Ships often come to get fresh Provisions and Wa∣ter: He ask'd us if we would go with him, to which we readily agreed. In a Week's Time we had got Provisions enough, such as <HI>Beef, Rice, Water,</HI> and <HI>Firing,</HI> and made the Long-boat tight. We were nine Per∣sons in all with my Companion's Wife, and one Negroe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WE sail'd three or four Days along the Shoar, and were got to the Southward of <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> when the Wind shifted, and blow'd so hard we could not carry sail; so that in short, we drove on Shoar within three or four Leagues of this Place where we now are. We sav'd all our Lives with our Money, Guns, Powder, Shot, &amp;c. but the Long-Boat was stav'd in pieces. The Natives, who liv'd near the Sea, seeing us in this Distress, came down to succour us, and carried us up to
<PB N="20" REF="38"/>
their Town; for they found we understood a little of their Language, and having also a Negroe with us they were not afraid, tho' they never saw any white Men before; and they were so civil, that we wanted for nothing which they could assist us with, but they soon sent up into the Coun∣try, to let their <HI>Dean,</HI> or King, know of us, who sent his Son and a commanding Officer with fifty Men to fetch us. They were all arm'd with Guns and Lances; we refus'd to go with them, and were as re∣solute as we durst be in opposing them; but they soon made themselves Masters of our Ammunition. Capt. <HI>Drummend</HI> was for de∣fending ourselves to the last Extremity, and not deliver our Arms; but it was my Opi∣nion, that it was impossible to get off from them by Force, because of their Number; and therefore advis'd Compliance, and see if we could not obtain our Desires by sof∣ter Means. We told them we desir'd to go to <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> (St. <HI>Augustine</HI> Bay we thought too far to travel by Land) but, in short, we were not at our own Dispo∣sal, for they oblig'd us to go with them. We made it three Days Travel to the prin∣cipal Town where their King's Residence was. When we came there, and went to see him, he was drinking <HI>Toake</HI> (which is made
<PB N="21" REF="39"/>
of Honey and Water like <HI>Mead)</HI> his Sons and Generals were with him; they were all very merry. He ask'd Captain <HI>Drummond</HI> to drink, but the Captain pretended he was sick, and refus'd it. I was the Interpreter between them; the King bad me tell him he should want for nothing which the Coun∣try afforded. The Captain desir'd I would return for Answer, that he wanted to be in his own Country, and begg'd he would give us Leave to go where we might get Shipping. On this the King look'd sternly, and <HI>said,</HI> Let the Captain know, if he does not understand when he is well I do; there are several Kings on this Island have white Men live among them, and why shall not I, since our Gods have sent you here? You shall never go as long as I live. As soon as Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> understood this, his Co∣lour rose, and looking as sternly at the King, <HI>he reply'd,</HI> Let him know, that if I could have suspected this before-hand, he should never have seen my Face alive; I would have sent some of their black Souls to Hell: It is not their Gods, it's nothing but For∣tune and Chance has put me into his Power, and by FORTUNE I may be deliver'd from him. Hereupon he got up without taking his Leave, and went to our Cottage. I stay'd long enough to tell the King what
<PB N="22" REF="40"/>
he had said, and without waiting for an Answer, got up and follow'd the Captain. The King seeing Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> go away in a Passion, to appease him sent one of his Generals with an Ox for us to kill, and de∣sir'd the Captain to make himself easy; we should be well provided for, if we could eat an Ox every Day we should have it. The Captain sent my Companion's Wife, whose Name was <HI>Deude,</HI> with a Compli∣ment to the King, and to thank him for the Care he took to provide so plentifully for our Support; but withal to tell him, we did not think Life worth preserving with∣out Freedom to enjoy it; and if we could not get home to our Native Country it would be no Favour to let us live.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WE continu'd thus about a Fortnight before we made any Attempt to escape; we computed ourselves to be about five Days Journey from <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> whither we at length agreed to go, and to steal away by Night, and got what Provision we thought proper: Ammunition, or Arms we had none, nor could get any, except that my Companion had two Pocket-Pistols which the Natives had not discover'd when they plunder'd us: The Country was woody▪ and we thought to conceal ourselves wel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enough in the Woods. According to this
<PB N="23" REF="41"/>
Resolution, on a Moon-light Night, we got out of the Town undiscover'd, and were soon in the Woods. By Day-light they miss'd us, and the News being carry'd to the King, he immediately order'd us to be sought for, and pursu'd. They soon track'd us, for our Shoes distinguish'd our Footing from that of the bare-foot Natives; and having got into our Path, they came up with us just before Night, and knowing we had nothing to defend ourselves, did not offer any Violence to us, but told us we must go back with them to their King. Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> told them we would not go back, when they saw our Resolution, and that they could not persuade us with fair Words, they took hold of us. They who seiz'd my Companion not having hold of both his Hands, he had an Opportunity to take out his Pistol, with which he shot one of them and wounded him: They seem'd enrag'd at this, however they did nothing to us but bind us, till they had made a strict Search, for fear we should have con∣ceal'd more Pistols; but no more being found than these of my Companion's, they march'd back with us to their King. When he saw us, he look'd upon us with a frown∣ing and threatning Face; and he having but one Eye and thin Jaws, his Countenance,
<PB N="24" REF="42"/>
when he frown'd, seem'd more terrible. He bad me tell the Captain, and all of them, that if ever we offer'd to run away again he would make us repent it. As to the Man who was wounded, and for the doing of which we had some Fear, neither he, nor any Body else said any Thing about it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THIS was about two Months ago; since that Time nothing remarkable has happen'd, till Yesterday News came of your being cast away; and the King immediately order'd me down with the Message which I have deliver'd to you from him. My Friends are guarded for fear they should make their Escape, and come to you; as for me, I sweeten him, and tell him I will remain with him as long as I live, and he puts some Con∣fidence in me. This, Sir, is a true Account of the Misfortunes and Miseries we are un∣der; and which, I am afraid, will be more now our Numbers are increas'd.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sam</HI> having made an End of his Story, which every Body listen'd to very attentively, we separated, and went with heavy Hearts to our respective Quarters, which were under the Bushes. It was very late, and we endeavour'd to repose ourselves as well as we could; the Pieces of Muslin serv'd us to spread on the
<PB N="25" REF="43"/>
Ground for Beds; but as for my Part, I slept not at all. Now my wicked Obstinacy appear'd to my View, and my tender Mother's begging me on her Knees not to go to Sea, gave me the most distracting Torture. I could see my Error now, and repent; but who could I blame but myself? Here were many poor Men who had no other Way to live, but I had no such Necessity; I wilfully run into Misery, and I had it. Tears I might, and did shed enough; but could not complain of Fate or Provi∣dence, for my Punishment was just, tho' ter∣rible.</P>
<P>AS soon as Day-light appear'd we were all up, and most of my Fellow-sufferers got no more Rest than I; for the Man's Relation had made us give over all Hopes of Re∣lief, and nothing but Lamentation, Distress, and Despair appear'd in all its dismal various Forms in every Man according to their diffe∣rent Constitutions. We could save neither Arms nor Ammunition, the Want of which fi∣nish'd our Destruction; for near one hundred and seventy People would have made their Way thorow that Part of the Country where we wanted to travel, had we wherewithal to have defended ourselves; but Fate had or∣dain'd it to be as it was, which was in eve∣ry respect in the worst Manner it could have been. So that we had only our Lives left
<PB N="26" REF="44"/>
us, for no other Use but to be sensible of Pain, Misery, and perpetual Slavery; which was the best we could then expect.</P>
<P>ABOUT one a Clock in the Afternoon, the King came down with about two hundred Ne∣groes. They brought no Fire-Arms with them, for fear we should snatch them; but they were arm'd with Lances. When we saw them coming towards us, we all stood together in a Body, with our Captain at the Head of us, fronting them: When they came near, he call'd <HI>Sam,</HI> which was the Man's Name he sent to us, and ask'd him which was our Captain; being shew'd him, he came to him, took him by the Hand, and said <HI>Salamonger, Captain;</HI> which is a common Term of Salu∣tation, like saying <HI>Your Servant, Sir.</HI> The Captain return'd him the same Answer; <HI>Sam</HI> having before told him what was proper to say to the King. He brought with him four large Bullocks, six Callabashes of Toak, ten Baskets of Potatoes, and two Pots of Honey; these he presented to our Captain, and gave us also two or three earthen Pots to boil our Meat and other Victuals in: We immediately roasted the Potatoes. He stay'd two Hours with us, before he went to the Cottage where he design'd to lye that Night, and ask'd several Questions about our Ship, and the Manner of her being lost. He told the Captain he
<PB N="27" REF="45"/>
was sorry for his Misfortunes and Loss, tho▪ in my Opinion he was glad of it; for he was, as I found afterwards, more brutish and dishonest than most of the other Kings on the Island; and his whole Nation were cloath'd for many Years out of the Goods they sav'd from our Wreck. He said nothing at this Time to our Captain of carrying us up to his Residence.</P>
<P>THE next Morning he came to visit us again, and then he told us we must prepare to go along with him to his Town, and there he would plentifully provide for us, and we should want for nothing the Country afforded. Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> bid the Interpreter tell the King, he return'd him a thousand Thanks for the Ci∣vilities he had already receiv'd; and that he was not only unable to make him Satisfac∣tion, but very unwilling to put him to the further Trouble and Charge of maintaining so many People. The King reply'd, that if we were as many more he should not think us a Trouble or Charge; for he should be sufficiently recompenc'd by the Honour of having so many white Men in his Dominions.</P>
<P>THE Captain by this last Speech perceiv'd his whole Intention, which so shock'd him, that he could not tell what to say to him; but after considering a little, and looking earnestly at <HI>Sam,</HI> he bad him say, that we
<PB N="28" REF="46"/>
have Wives, Children, and Relations, who want us and we them; that it is impossible for us to live here always; and therefore we desire he will let us go to some Port where we may meet with Ships, and return to our native Country. The King stood a good while before he answer'd again; but at length he bid <HI>Sam</HI> tell us, that we should stay in his Country till some Ships came there to trade; and then we should go home. The Captain knowing there was no Port in his Dominions, nor any Harbour for a Ship to put into, took it to be only a Trick and a Compli∣ment; for we might stay for ever before a Ship came there to trade. He therefore bad <HI>Sam</HI> tell him he would think of it, and re∣turn him an Answer to Morrow; upon this the King departed, and gave us no more Trouble that Day.</P>
<P>AFTER he was gone the Captain call'd us all together, and in a very moving Speech address'd himself to us, saying, <Q>“I am now on an Equality with every Man here pre∣sent, my Fortune as low, and my Life no more to be valu'd; I, therefore, do not pre∣tend to command, but to consult with you what is proper to be done in the present Extremity." He further said, "I am happy in this, that tho' my own Life and Liberty are lost as well as yours, yet no∣thing
<PB N="29" REF="47"/>
of this Misfortune is owing to me; for I would rather have kept on my Course to the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> and trusted Pro∣vidence in a leaky Ship than put in here, but you were all against it; for in my Opinion, Death is much rather to be pre∣fer'd to our present Slavery, and what we are further threaten'd with. In Death our Miseries will have an End, but now who can tell the Troubles and Torments we shall yet undergo?</Q> <HI>(At this the Tears stood in his Eyes.)</HI> <Q>“I desire you to consider, <HI>said he,</HI> that we have no Arms nor Ammunition wherewith to defend ourselves; and I have endeavour'd to persuade the King to give us a Passage thorow his Country to a Sea∣port, but all in vain; therefore, <HI>says he,</HI> think of it, and consult your own Safety as well as you can, only agree in one Mind, and I am ready to do any thing you would have me: As for my Life, I set no Value upon it; it is not now worth preserving, only to try if I can serve you with it. Re∣member, I must return an Answer to Mor∣row Morning, and I will advise nothing, nor do any thing myself.”</Q></P>
<P>WE went together and consulted, as the Captain advis'd, and soon agreed; for there was, indeed, not much Choice to be made: The King had refus'd to give us Leave to go
<PB N="30" REF="48"/>
to a Sea-port, and we had no Arms to fight and to force our Way, if we could have found it: So we resolv'd to go quietly up the Country with the King; where, perhaps, we should see Captain <HI>Drummond</HI> and the other People, who, being gallant and resolute Men, and by this time a little acquainted with the Natives, might be capable of advising us.</P>
<P>WITH this Resolution we acquainted the Captain, who was very well contented with it; for, indeed, he did not much Care what became of himself, since he had lost his Ship and Fortune, and despair'd of ever getting off the Island.</P>
<P>THE next Morning the King came to visit the Captain, they saluted each other as usual, and sat down together upon the Sand, we stand∣ing round them: When they were seated, the King bid <HI>Sam</HI> ask the Captain whether he was ready to travel; for it would be best to walk in the Cool of the Morning, and rest at Noon. The Captain observ'd, that he did not ask whether he had a Mind to go, as might be rea∣sonably expected, seeing he pretended to give him time to consider of it; but peremptorily ask'd if he was ready to go. The Captain see∣ing there was no help, and having our Consent, it signify'd nothing to dispute it; so he told him we were ready to go when he pleas'd. At this the King seem'd very well satisfy'd, and
<PB N="31" REF="49"/>
bid <HI>Sam</HI> tell us he would go and break-fast; and advis'd us to do so too, that we might be the better able to travel.</P>
<P>BUT we had little Satisfaction in eating and drinking, especially now the Hour was come, that we must leave the Sea-side; and it gall'd us to the quick, to think how we were forc'd up the Country at the Pleasure of heathenish Negroes, like a Flock of Sheep, without Power to make Terms for ourselves like Men. Some curs'd, and others lamented their hard For∣tune, nor were Reflections wanting; for my part, I could not then see any Reason to blame any Body; only I have since thought that our Captain was young, and had not so much Experience as his Father, who, perhaps, would not have put to Sea from <HI>Mauritius</HI> in a leaky Ship, but have took the Company's Cargo out, and left it there till they sent another Ship for it, and sav'd all our Lives; however it was as it pleased Fate!</P>
<P>THE King sent, and the Word was given <HI>To go:</HI> I was always ready, for I would carry nothing with me but what I brought ashoar; but many of our People took Pieces of Silk and fine Callico. We assembl'd together, and went where the King's Tent was. We were no sooner come but he was for marching. We left the Sea with heavy Hearts, looking very
<PB N="32" REF="50"/>
wishfully back as long as we could discern it; and as often as we did, we could see the Negroes hard at work, breaking up our Bails; and inriching themselves with the Plunder of our Goods; for there was so much to be got, that but few went back with the King.</P>
<P>OUR People were in very indifferent Case for travelling; every Body tir'd with working and want of Rest; many lam'd with Hurts receiv'd in getting on Shoar: Some also with∣out Shoes, and most with bad Ones; then the Country near the Sea-side and some few Miles further is woody, full of short Under∣wood and thorny Shrubs, which tore out Cloaths to Rags; for the Path was very nar∣row, and before this Accident but little prac∣tis'd; the Ground also sandy: So that when the Sun was advanc'd pretty high, it scorch'd our Feet that we were not able to walk.</P>
<P>ABOUT Noon we came to one of their small mean Villages, consisting of about eight or ten Houses, or rather Huts; for they were not above six or seven Feet high, and eight or nine Feet long, and their Doors not above three or four Feet high: Our People crept into these Hovels to rest, and to see what they could meet with to refresh themselves▪ Some found Honey, some Milk, others Beef; for the King had given us Leave to take what∣soever came to Hand of Eatables. The In∣habitants
<PB N="33" REF="51"/>
were all absent, the Men down at the Sea-side making Advantage of our Wreck, and the Women and Children fled into the Woods at our Approach. We pass'd thorow several of these poor Villages, but saw few or none of the People. Here we repos'd ourselves till the Heat of the Sun was abated, making a very poor Retaliation on them by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obbing them of Trifles, while they were enriching themselves out of our most valuable Commo∣dities: However, I observ'd some of our People seem'd a little to gratify their Revenge in it.</P>
<P>IN the Cool of the Afternoon we march'd again, and in a little time came to a more open Country and better Path. The King hav∣ing now got us some Miles from the Sea, lest us, and went before to his Seat, leaving us to march as we could in our own Time, hav∣ing before taken Care that we should not want Provisions, and left his (Chief Officer, whom tho' of a petty Army, we shall call) General strict Orders to provide whatsoever we wanted, which the Country would afford.</P>
<P>AT Night we came to another of these little Villages, where we kill'd a Bullock, and got some earthen Pots to boil our Meat in; the Water was very dirty, they having none but what they fetch'd a great Way out of Holes and Pits in the Woods, and kept in Calabashes or long Tubs, which hold four or five Gallons
<PB N="34" REF="52"/>
each; however it serv'd our Turn, for then we were not curious. We repos'd ourselves as well as we could on the Ground, and rose the next Morning by Day-light, <HI>Sam</HI> calling on us to march in the Cool of the Morning. We eat a Breakfast of Beef without any Bread kind, or Roots in the Room of Bread, and the Meat full of Sand; but at that Time Eating and Drink∣ing was the least of our Care. We pass'd this D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y much after the same manner as the Day before, only with a little more Difficulty to those who wanted Shoes, whose Feet were sorely prick'd and h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t in the Woods.</P>
<P>THE third Day of our March we reach'd to our Journey's End: We were forc'd to walk faster this Day than either of the former, hav∣ing more Ground to travel, and less Time to do it in; for we were to be at the King's Town before Sun-set. This Day I lost one of my Purses, but the Loss was not of any Importance to me then; for it would have been of little Use had I kept it: Yet in all this great Concern, where my Life and Li∣berty were in such imminent Danger, it was no small Addition to my Trouble to lose a Medal, which my Mother had giv'n me at our parting as a Token to remember her.</P>
<P>THE Residence of this King is about fifty Miles from the Sea-side; for I suppose, we might travel sixteen or seventeen Miles a Day.
<PB N="35" REF="53"/>
It stands in a Wood, and is secur'd in a par∣ticular manner with Trees all round it, which seem to have been planted there when very young; they grow very streight and tall, and so near together, that a small Dog can't pass between them. They are also naturally arm'd with large strong Thorns, so that there's no breaking thorow, nor climbing over. There are but two Passages, or Gates, no wider than for two to go a-breast: One of these to the North∣ward, and the other to the Southward; the whole in Compass is about a Mile.</P>
<P>WHEN we came near we halted, whilst <HI>Sam</HI> went to acquaint the King of our coming, who order'd us to stay till he had made him∣self ready to receive us; our Captain too put us into Form as well as he could, ordering all our Baggage, and Things which our People brought with them, to be laid down under a <HI>Tamarind</HI> Tree, and three or four <HI>Lascars</HI> to look after it. He soon sent for us, and we march'd in Order by Fours. The King was sitting on a Mat cross-legg'd in the open Air, just before the Door of his House, having a Gun leaning on his Shoulder, and a Brace of Pistols lying by him; his Sons and Kinsmen in the same manner sitting on the Ground on each Hand with Guns and Lances; his People joining them on both Sides, forming together an Half-moon; they too were most of them
<PB N="36" REF="54"/>
arm'd with Guns and Lances. There were Mats spread from one End of the People to the other for us to sit on, so that when we had join'd them, the whole Assembly made almost a Circle. We were a little concern'd to see them all arm'd, till <HI>Sam</HI> told us, it was their Custom never to go from one House to another without their Guns and Lances.</P>
<P>AFTER we were seated, the King (by <HI>Sam)</HI> bid the Captain <HI>Welcome,</HI> and sent for ten Ca∣labashes of <HI>Toake;</HI> six he gave to our People, three to his own, and one he kept betwixt our Captain and himself. He also sent for Cap∣tain <HI>Drummond,</HI> Captain <HI>Steward,</HI> and the rest of their Company. Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> arose to sa∣lute them, and the common Civilities being over, the Captains sat by each other. The King order'd a Servant to pour out some <HI>Toake</HI> into a clean earthen Cup, which he had for himself, and drank it up without any Form of Compliment by drinking to any Body; but order'd some to be pour'd out for our Cap∣tain in another Cup that was dirty, which our Captain refus'd. The King ask'd the Rea∣son of it, and was told by <HI>Sam,</HI> that it was because it was dirty; so the King sent a Man to wash it. The Captain ask'd for the King's Cup, but <HI>Sam</HI> inform'd him that neither <HI>Black</HI> nor <HI>White</HI> ever drank out of his Cup, not even his Wives or Children; and this is the gene∣ral
<PB N="37" REF="55"/>
Custom of the Country. When I saw the Servant returning with the Cup wash'd, which our Captain had refus'd, I took out my sil∣ver Cup, and presented it to him; after we had all drank out of it, the King desir'd to see it, and was so wonderfully delighted with it, that he begg'd it. But the Captain told him it was none of his own, it belong'd to a Boy that was behind him. I call'd to <HI>Sam,</HI> and desir'd him to tell the King, <Q>that “”seeing so many People had drank out of it, I did conceive,</Q> it could not be proper for his Use. At this he, and his People too, laugh'd hear∣tily. He desir'd me to stand up that he might see me; however I kept my Cup this Time. Night drawing on he took his Leave, order∣ing us a Bullock for our Supper. He would not trust us all to lye in the Town, there were but few of us lay within the Gates, besides our Captain, Mr. <HI>Prat,</HI> our chief Mate, Mr. <HI>Bembo,</HI> our second Mate, and myself. We had a Hutch order'd us next to Capt. <HI>Drum∣mond</HI> and his Companions, but the rest of the People lay without the Gate under the Trees.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner we liv'd for a few Days: I know not what particular Amusements some of our People found to pass away their melan∣choly Hours; but there occurr'd to me an Affair of a most agreeable and surprising Na∣ture; and which many would have made a
<PB N="38" REF="56"/>
much better Use than I did. <Q>“”This King had a Daughter, a Girl, as One might guess, about thirteen or fourteen Years of Age, and she us'd to talk often to me a great While together, tho' I did not understand a Word she said. She seem'd to be very desirous I should apprehend her Meaning, but she was modest, and us'd no unhandsom Ge∣stures to explain any loose Inclinations, and no such Thing came into my Head; so that our Conversation on my side tended to nothing: Which she at length perceiv∣ing, sent <HI>Sam</HI> to me one Day, to desire I would come to her Nurse's House, where she was brought up, and eat something with her. I went along with him, and when we came there, I found a Mat spread on one side of the House, on which she de∣sir'd us to sit; and order'd one of her Slaves to boil some <HI>Guinca</HI> Corn and Milk, and roast some Beef. She sate down over a∣gainst me, and tho' I had no Notion of LOVE, yet I could not help observing a particular Softness in her speaking to me; and when she ask'd <HI>Sam</HI> of our Misfortunes, she shew'd a great deal of Concern and Pity, and look'd at me with some uncommon Plea∣sure, as People do at Pictures which please them, and star'd me almost out of Counte∣nance. I thought she was resolv'd to know
<PB N="39" REF="57"/>
me again, she remark'd me so all over. She was wondrous courteous and obliging, and often sigh'd with Pity at the Sense she seem'd to have of our miserable Condition. I look'd upon her to be a good-natur'd Crea∣ture, and that Curiosity more than Love had made her desirous of being acquainted with a <HI>White Man,</HI> which is so strange a Sight in their Country. We were just en∣tring into the best Part of the Conversation, and our Interpreter had began at her Request, to tell me the Reason of her extraordinary Courtesy and Observation of me, when her Mother came to the Door, and ask'd her to take a Walk without the Gates to see the white Men. I was concern'd at this Interruption, and she seem'd much more vex'd at it herself; but it would have been imprudent to have refus'd her Mother's Re∣quest; so she went with her Mother, and we return'd. <HI>Sam</HI> told me she had order'd him to acquaint me that she was in Love with me; but charg'd him to say nothing of it to any other Man, either white or black. I was strangely surpris'd at this plain Declaration, and that this was the End of her coveting so much of my Com∣pany. Since I came to be a Man, I have wonder'd at the Thoughts of my own Stu∣pidity, so as to put a young Lady to the
<PB N="40" REF="58"/>
Expence of acquainting me with her Love, and exposing herself to another Man. I have nothing to offer in Excuse, but that being a Youth not sixteen Years of Age, the Disco∣very of so great a Secret created in me more Fear than Love, lest the Consequen∣ces of this Affair might prove fatal to me. The same Night she sent again for me, and I went accordingly, and there behav'd my∣self with all the Deceney and good Man∣ners, as Policy and Gratitude for her Ci∣vilities oblig'd me to. I knew she was the King's Favourite, and that he dearly lov'd her, I was, therefore, more fearful of dis∣obliging her, lest she might tell her Fa∣ther what Story she pleas'd, and destroy me. At length I found she was afraid of her Father's knowing it; so that I look'd on myself to be in Danger on both Sides, and for this Reason, when <HI>Sam</HI> told me she desir'd my Company again the next Night, I pretended myself to be very sick, and unable to go; so that this Affair which might have afforded much Pleasure to some others, prov'd to me, in my then Circum∣stances, a Matter of Vexation and Trou∣ble; but two Days after an End was put to our Amour,</Q> if I may call it so.</P>
<P>EVERY Morning we us'd to go in a Body, and visit the King; till one Morning he bid
<PB N="41" REF="59"/>
<HI>Sam</HI> tell us, that he had a very potent Ene∣my to the Westward, who had hitherto been too powerful for him; but since his Gods had sent him some white Men, he would take this Opportunity once more to try his Strength with our Assistance; but in the mean time he must distribute us among his Sons, who liv'd at other Towns, as well for more convenient Provisions for such a Number of us (there not being Room enough in this Town) as to ease himself of a Charge too great and trouble∣some for him alone to sustain. He also sent to me this Night to beg the Cup, which I did not refuse him, knowing it was in his Power to take it by Force. This Parting was a terrible Blow to us, and we return'd to our Cottages with heavy Hearts, knowing if we could not find some Way to prevent our Se∣paration, there remain'd for us no Hopes of ever getting off the Island.</P>
<P>HEREUPON the three Captains, <HI>viz. Drum∣mond, Sieward,</HI> and <HI>Younge</HI> enter'd immediately into a Consultation with a few only of the chief of our People, to consult what was proper to be done on this emergent Occasion, and to make some Attempt for our precious Liberty. It was Captain <HI>Drummond,</HI> as I heard afterwards, who propos'd to take the King Prisoner; and by that Means to make their own Terms with the People. Now Captain
<PB N="42" REF="60"/>
<HI>Drummond</HI> and some others were experienc'd Men, and of gallant enterprising Spirits; our Captain had Courage enough, but he was too young. However every Body approv'd the Proposition, and the Time and Manner of the Execution was fix'd. I was too young to be of the Council, so I will not pretend to re∣late what Reasons were giv'n for and against the Proposal, tho' I was told afterwards. But that Night I was wholly ignorant, I observ'd Cap∣tain <HI>Younge</HI> and Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbo</HI> to talk with great Earnestness, but softly, and with Caution: However, I slept sound, till I was wak'd in the Morning by a great and sudden Noise in the Town, occasion'd by the putting their Plot in Execution. Our People went as usual, early in the Morning to visit the King (by what Mistake it came to pass that I was not call'd I know not) when some of them were got to the Prince's House, the Signal was giv'n by one of Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI>'s Mens firing a Pi∣stol; at which the King was seis'd, and his Son at the same Time.</P>
<P>THIS immediately alarm'd the whole Town: I started up, and jump'd out as I lay, with∣out Shoes, being frighted at the sudden Cry and Uproar: Not knowing what was the Matter, and seeing the Negroes running out of the Town, I ran with them, till I was espy'd by one of our Men, who call'd me back; and
<PB N="43" REF="61"/>
I was as much amas'd as the Natives, to see the King, his Wife, and one of his Sons, with their Hands ty'd behind them, and guarded by our People. They soon plunder'd the King's House, and every other Place, where they could find any Thing fit for their Pur∣pose. We happen'd to find about thirty small Arms, some Powder and Shot, and some got Lances. The People (as I before observ'd) ran out of this Town, but they did it only to gather more Strength; for they soon a∣larm'd the Country, and return'd with great Numbers from all the Neighbouring Towns, and besieg'd us. They fir'd in upon us, and wounded one of our Men in the Groin, on which Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> bid <HI>Sam</HI> tell the King if they fir'd any more, they would immediately kill him. When the King heard their Reso∣lution, he call'd to his Men, and desir'd them to forbear firing, if they had a Mind to save his Life.</P>
<P>THIS Attempt, indeed, was bold and ha∣zardous, and some, perhaps may think it cri∣minal; howbeit I shall say but little in its Defence: Yet since I have arriv'd to Years of Maturity, I cannot but reflect, that if <HI>Nature,</HI> ev'n in a Christian Country, <HI>will rebel against Principle,</HI> what will <HI>It</HI> not do for Life and Li∣berty under Heathenism!</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="62"/>
HOWEVER, at length we put ourselves in Or∣der, and march'd out of the Town: Six Men arm'd march'd in the Front, and in the Body where the King was, six went arm'd before him, and six behind; three before his Son, and three behind him; and six brought up the Rear, in which were the <HI>Lascars.</HI> Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> out of Pity releas'd the Queen, and let her go whither she pleas'd; but she would not leave her Husband.</P>
<P>BY that Time we had got about four Miles on our March, the wounded Man fainted; and we could not stay to make Provision to carry him, but were forc'd to leave him by the Side of a Pond of Water; where, as I was afterwards inform'd, they soon put him out of his Pain, by sticking their Lances in almost every Part of his Body. About two or three Miles further we got out of the Woods, and found ourselves in a large open Plain where we could see all around us, and soon found that our Enemies were near and numerous, threatning immediately to attack us. We fac'd toward them, our arm'd Men in the Front, and the King bound before them. <HI>Sam</HI> was order'd to tell him, that they did not design to hurt either him or his Son, nor to carry them to their Enemies Country; that our Design was only to detain them as Pledges for our Safe-guard, while we pass'd
<PB N="45" REF="63"/>
thorow his Dominions; and as soon as we came to the Borders of <HI>Port-Dauphine</HI> Coun∣try we would let them go again, and give them back the Arms and Ammunition we took from them; but if any Violence was offer'd to us we would sacrifice them, and this we desir'd him to tell his People.</P>
<P>UPON which he call'd one of his Generals, and bid him not be afraid to come to him, for he should receive no Harm. Accordingly he left his Gun and Lance behind him, and came to us, where he was assur'd by us and the King of our Intention; hereupon he told us there should not be a Gun fir'd at us while we kept the King alive, and us'd him well.</P>
<P>WHEN this Parley was over, we continu'd our March thorow the Plain till near Eve∣ning, many without Shoes as well as myself, and some sick; which oblig'd us to take up our Quarters sooner than we would have done; so that every Body was faint, and glad to rest themselves. The King bid <HI>Sam</HI> to tell us, that he had order'd an Ox to be brought to us By-and-by. We made a round Trench, like a Ring, in the Midst of which we plac'd the black King and his Son; our Captain and some few others were appointed to guard them: Our armed Men were divided into four Parties as might best secure us. We had just finish'd our Camp, when the Officer who
<PB N="46" REF="64"/>
had been with us came, and three Men with him bringing a Bullock. He brought some roasted Meat in his Hand, and an Horn of Water for the King; so we loos'd his and his Son's Hands that they might feed them∣selves. They eat a little, and gave the rest to Capt. <HI>Younge.</HI></P>
<P>IN the mean Time we were busy in killing the Ox, we desir'd the King to send some of his People into the Woods for some Fuel; which he readily did, and they soon brought us a sufficient Quantity. But all this While we had no Water, which we as much wanted as Meat, and complain'd to the King, who told us there was none to be got near that Place by some Miles; that which was given him in the Horn being brought from that Pond where we left the wounded Man; which we guess'd might be about ten Miles Distance. This very much dishearten'd us, for we were parch'd up with Thirst, the more encreas'd by the Fatigue of our long March, and the Heat of the Country. However there was no Help for us, and bear it we must. When the King and his Son had supp'd we bound their Hands before them, that they might sleep as easy as they could; so we, after having cut up our Bullock, and divided it amongst us, broil'd and eat it, tho' with little Satisfaction for Want of Water; and when we had made as good
<PB N="47" REF="65"/>
a Supper as our miserable Circumstances would admit of, we also endeavour'd to repose our∣selves. The three Captains agreed to watch by Turns, and divided our People into three Parties for that Purpose. The King desir'd his Wife to go Home and comfort his Chil∣dren, particularly recommending to her Care his beloved Daughter. She went at his Re∣quest, but wept at parting, as did also the King and his Son. We who were not on the Watch lay down, and a wretched Night we had, for it was a stony Ground and little Grass; but our Thirst increasing was the most intol∣lerable Misery of all.</P>
<P>BY Day-light we arose, which was the se∣cond Day of our Travel, and the better to strengthen ourselves for our Journey, we eat some of the Remains of our Beef; but it was a miserable Repast without Drink. However we put ourselves in Order as the Day before and went forwards; the Natives, who all this While observ'd our Motions, seeing us moving they mov'd too, but kept at a greater Di∣stance, and went into our Camp after we had left it to see what they could find, and they did not wholly lose their Labour; for many of our People were glad to leave half those <HI>In∣dia</HI> Goods they brought out of the Town be∣hind them, that they might travel the bet∣ter. We walk'd with more Ease half this
<PB N="48" REF="66"/>
Day than the Day before, it proving cloudy Weather and cool. About Noon the Gene∣ral, who was with us before, came with some roast Meat, and an Horn of Water for the King and his Son, and fed them; for we did not loose their Hands. The General bid <HI>Sam</HI> ask the Captains, if they would release the King for six Guns. I perceiv'd there was a Debate between them and Mr. <HI>Bembo</HI> what to do. Some thinking the six Guns would be of great Use to us, especially seeing we should still have the King's Son. Others were of Opinion, that it would be safer for us to keep the King; but it was at last agreed to part with him. We told the General, if they would give us six very good Guns, and pro∣mise not to follow us, but return back with their King, we would let him go; and that as soon as we came to the River <HI>Manderra,</HI> which parted his Dominions from those of <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> we would release the King's Son, and leave with him all their Arms be∣hind us.</P>
<P>THE General was surpris'd at this unex∣pected Condescention of our People, and di∣spatch'd away one of his Men to the King's other Sons, who were not far off with their Army, to acquaint them of it; they soon sent the six Guns, for in half an Hour's Time they return'd to us with them. They made the
<PB N="49" REF="67"/>
more Haste fearing our Minds should change: We detain'd them no longer in suspence than while we took the Guns to pieces, to see whether they were good; and finding them better than we could have expected in such a Country, we releas'd their King, and sent him away with the General. He took his Leave of the Prince, and went to his Army. We were so very near as to see the Ceremony of his Sons meeting him at that time, who fell down and embrac'd his Knees with great Earnestness, shedding Tears for Joy: After they had kiss'd, and lick'd his Knees and Legs for five or six Minutes, they arose to give his Head Officers an Opportunity of do∣ing the same, and after them many others; all whom express'd a most sincere and passio∣nate Affection to him in this Manner, and show'd excessive Joy at receiving him again; they then fell to shouting, hallowing, and fi∣ring their Guns to declare their great Satis∣faction.</P>
<P>WE could not help stopping to see this Scene, which being a little over, we march'd forward, tho' after a poor Manner; for tho' it continu'd cloudy, yet the Afternoon was sultry hot, and our Thirst increasing, our People began to be sensibly weaker and weak∣er; but the Captains walk'd slowly on, which made our travelling something easier. We
<PB N="50" REF="68"/>
as'd the Prince if there was no Water near, who told us, there was none to be got till we came to <HI>Manderra</HI> River, which we could not reach that Night. We made him our Guide, tho' it was not easy for us to miss the Way; for we had inform'd ourselves from the Natives, that the Plain we were in was long, and of no great Breadth in Proportion to the Length, but extended itself near <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West</HI> to the River. When we came to a sandy Place, it being pretty near Sun-set, we halted and form'd our Camp, which was somewhat softer to lye on than our former Night's. The Natives seeing us begin to in∣camp, they also form'd theirs. They divided themselves into six Parties, and so order'd the Matter that they very near surrounded us; which did not a little daunt us. However, we appointed the Watch as before, but to our Misfortune here were neither Meat nor Wa∣ter, and we almost parch'd to Death; and to so great an Extremity were we reduc'd, that we crawl'd on the Ground to lick the Dew; and this was all the Means we had to moisten our Lips.</P>
<P>THE next Day, which was the third of our March, we rose early, and soon put forward as well as we could; the Negroes, strictly ob∣serving our Motions, were as ready as we; but we plac'd our armed Men in the Front,
<PB N="51" REF="69"/>
resolving to make a Push for it if they at∣tempted to hinder us. They divided, and let us pass without Molestation, and we travell'd all the Morning without any Thing remar∣kable, till we got to a little round Hill, on which there stood a prodigious large Tub, six Foot high, and held as near as might be guess'd about an hundred Gallons; this was full of <HI>Toake,</HI> and our People were going to drink it, when <HI>Sam</HI> came and push'd it over, and spilt all the Liquor; asking us if we were mad, that we could not see this was design'd as a Plot for our Destruction: For it was set in this droughty Place to tempt us to drink, with Design either to poison us im∣mediately, or so to intoxicate us, that they might rescue their Prince, and murder us at their Pleasure.</P>
<P>WHILE we were wondring at this, the Ge∣neral, and two or three more came towards us, and ask'd <HI>Sam</HI> why he spilt the <HI>Toake?</HI> To which he gave him no Answer, but bid him be gone about his Business. The Gene∣ral desir'd to speak with the Prince, and af∣ter a little Talk with him, order'd <HI>Sam</HI> to acquaint Capt. <HI>Younge,</HI> that if he would re∣lease the Prince, they would give him three of the Head-men of the Country in his Room. The Captain told him, if he would be one himself they would agree to it. He excus'd
<PB N="52" REF="70"/>
himself because of his Family, which, he pre∣tended, would be distracted for him; but he promis'd, that his own Brother, who had none, should be sent as one of the Hostages.</P>
<P>CAPT. <HI>Younge,</HI> who thought they follow'd us for nothing but their Prince; and that if we releas'd him, they would go back and leave us, told the General he was content it should be so. Hereupon he hasted immediate∣ly to the Army, and acquainted the other Princes with it; for the King went streight home as soon as he departed from us. We march d on, resolving to lose no Time, and about an Hour after the General return'd with three Men; and told us, he had brought his Brother, and two more of the Chief of their People to exchange for the Prince; and as to the Arms we had which belong'd to their King, we might, when we had done with them, leave them according to our Promise with these three Men, who would take Care to have them fetch'd home.</P>
<P>WE took the three Men, and ty'd their Hands behind them; and then deliver'd the Prince to him. He shook Hands with our Cap∣tains, and went to the Army: His Brethren seeing him coming ran to meet him, as did also many others; and there seem'd to be more Rejoicing for his Deliverance than there was before for the King's.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="71"/>
WE proceeded on our Journey as well as our feeble Limbs would carry us, without Meat and Drink, and soon saw Capt. <HI>Younge</HI>'s Mistake; for the Negroes, instead of going back, came nearer to us, and some march'd before us; so that we expected every Mi∣nute when they would assault us. We had a young Lad who lost his Leg at <HI>Bengal,</HI> but had a wooden One, tho' well fitted, yet was he not able to keep up with us; for we, be∣ing now surpris'd by their surrounding us, hasten'd on more than before; insomuch that we were forc'd to leave this poor Lad be∣hind us. We saw them as they came up with him take off his wooden Leg, and make Sport with it, bidding him follow us; till at length they thrust their Lances into his Body, and left him wallowing in his Blood. We now saw plainly what we had to expect from them, and therefore hurry'd on as fast as our feeble Limbs could carry us till Sun-set; when we came to a large <HI>Tamarind</HI> Tree, which we climb'd for the Leaves to chew, because they were sour; it not being then the Fruit-season.</P>
<P>THE three black Men we had Prisoners see∣ing what had pass'd, began to be afraid of their Lives; for they thought if their People attack'd us they were sure to be kill'd; they therefore call'd <HI>Sam</HI> and the Captains, and
<PB N="54" REF="72"/>
told them they had a Proposal to make, which would be for the Safety of all our Lives: It was, <Q>“That as soon as it was dark, we should silently march from this Place, and walk all Night.”</Q> The Captains lik'd the Propo∣sal, and order'd us not to sleep, but to be ready as soon as the Word was giv'n to go forward, This was very hard, considering how tir'd we were the Day before; but we were glad to submit to any Thing that gave us Hopes of escaping from those <HI>Barbarians.</HI> As soon as it was dark enough to conceal our Flight, we assembl'd together, and took some Muslin and Call<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>co and hung them upon the Bushes, that the Spies, who, we knew, watch'd us, might think we still remain'd there.</P>
<P>WE walk'd off very silently and slowly, and undiscover'd by them. Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> was taken so ill he could not walk, and there were none of us able to carry him; at last we re∣solv'd to make the three <HI>Blacks</HI> carry him by Turns. When we had thus travell'd most part of the Night, we came to a Thicket among some <HI>Cotton</HI> Trees, where the Man who carry'd Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> pretending to heave himself up to give a Lift, threw the Captain on the Ground, and ran away into the Wood, and we never saw him again. We took more Care of the other two, and led him, whose Turn it was to carry the Captain, with a Rope about his Neck.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="73"/>
WE travell'd a great many Miles this Night, notwithstanding our weak Condition, and were glad when we saw the Day break; for the Ne∣groes had told us if we travell'd all Night, be∣fore half the next Morning was past we should be at <HI>Manderra</HI> River: And their Informa∣tion was true, for as we went on and came to a little Hill, the Sun just rising, they shew'd us the River. It was a great way off, yet the Hopes we had of coming to it in a little time, and of getting Water to quench our parched Bodies, gave us no small Pleasure, and our Spirits began to revive even at the Sight of it. That this was also the Bounds of this King's Dominion gave us some Comfort, tho' there were no Inhabitants to protect us with∣in several Miles on the other Side. Some of our People who were tir'd began to take the Liberty of sitting down; thinking the Ne∣groe Army would never come in Sight of us again.</P>
<P>BUT this flattering Prospect of Safety quick∣ly vanish'd, for as soon as they miss'd us in the Morning, they ran after us like so many Grey-hounds; and by that time we got with∣in a Mile of <HI>Manderra</HI> River they overtook us, and began immediately to slaughter our Men then resting under the Trees, striking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Lances into their Sides and Throats. I was one of those who could not travel well,
<PB N="56" REF="74"/>
but there were twenty behind me; the Wo∣man who was sav'd in our Ship was next to me. I, seeing them kill our People as they overtook them, tore off my Coat, and after∣wards my Wastcoat, throwing them away, that they should not hinder me in running; for the foremost of our People being got over the River, and I not far off, took Courage; but as I look'd back at the Pop of a Gun, I saw the Woman fall, and the Negroes sticking their Lances in her Sides. It was my Turn next, for the same Negroes came after me, and I was just got to the River-side as they fir'd a Gun at me; but I jump'd into it. Our Men who had got over made a Stand on the other Side to defend us who were behind; and for all the Negroes follow'd me close, I would not go thorow the River, without stop∣ping to drink two or three Times out of my Hat, till I was swell'd with Water.</P>
<P>I got over to our People, and whilst we were on the Bank, and fac'd them, they would not attempt to go over. Our Captains ask'd me if there were any more of our People to be expected, I told him no; they were all kill'd. We waited, however, a little, and see∣ing no Hopes of any escaping to us we march'd on. We had a Wood to go thorow, and the Negroes follow'd us as soon as they saw us gone from the Banks. They got into the
<PB N="57" REF="75"/>
Woods, and skulk'd behind the Trees, firing every now and then at us, and killing three or four of our Men. We had not travell'd above two Miles in this Wood, before we came to a large sandy open Place that we could see no End to, and here they resolv'd to stop our Progress; knowing if we went much further, we should be within hearing of King <HI>Samuel</HI>'s People, who were their Enemy, and would rea∣dily assist us. They, therefore, divided them∣selves into several Bodies, in Order to break in upon us on every Side; and we, seeing their De∣signs, were resolv'd to sell our Lives and Liber∣ties as dear as we could Hereupon our Cap∣tains put us in as good Order as was possi∣ble, and divided our armed People into four Divisions: One under the Command of each Captain, and the other under Mr. <HI>John Bembo;</HI> the rest who had no Arms, or were disabled, we cover'd as well as we could in a little Val∣ley; and with them were the two Negroe Hostages.</P>
<P>WE had not above six and thirty Fire-Arms amongst us, and not many more People fit to fight; so that we were a poor Hand∣ful to withstand an Army of two or three Thousand. When they found we made a Stand to oppose them, they did so too; and after their accustom'd Manner (where it could be done) three or four of them in a Place threw
<PB N="58" REF="76"/>
up the Sand before them to cover themselves, and being also beneath us down-hill, we could see only their Heads: Their Shot flew very fast over us, and we kept them in Play from Noon till six in the Afternoon; by which Time all our Shot was gone. Our People who had Money made Slugs of it; and when that was done, they took the middle Screws out of their Guns, and charg'd their Pieces with them. When they could find no more Shot, they knew not what to do: Now we began to reflect on them who advis'd the de∣livering up the King, and afterwards his Son; when keeping them would have been our Safe∣guard. The two Negroes in our Custody ex∣pected every Minute to be kill'd, when they saw some of our People wounded; but their Death would do us no Good, and, therefore, we did not hurt them.</P>
<P>AT length it was agreed to send the Wo∣man <HI>Dudey</HI> and her Husband to them with a Flag of Truce, as well to protract the Time, as to know what they wanted: So we ty'd a Piece of red Silk to a Lance, and sent them away. All this While they kept firing at us, not knowing what we meant by not firing again. They shot at those who carry'd the Flag, but when they saw they came nearer to them, and were not arm'd, the Prince gave Orders to cease. <HI>Dudey</HI> was Interpreter, and
<PB N="59" REF="77"/>
told them, that our Captain was willing to make Peace with them, and would deliver up the two Hostages, and send the Guns and Ammunition we took away with us, as soon as we got a little further into this Country. They said they would let us go in the Morning, if we would deliver up our Arms and the Men; but they would not let us that Eve∣ning because it was dark. Their Reason was, That if we got away that Night, we should send some of King's <HI>Samuel</HI>'s People, who were their utter Enemies, to revenge ourselves upon them.</P>
<P>WE could not tell what Resolution to come to, we were willing enough to let the two Men (whom they call'd Generals) go; but we were loth to part with our Arms: Most of us, and our Captain were of Opinion, that they follow'd us only for them, and were for delivering our Arms; but Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> Capt. <HI>Steward,</HI> and their People, with Mr. <HI>Bem∣bo</HI> and some of our People were against it; Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> particularly express'd a great Concern to see us so easy to be impos'd up∣on; and told us, that we might see their Words were worth nothing. But most Voices carry'd it, and Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> being of the Opi∣nion to do it, it was agreed, and in short, soon done; for <HI>Dudey</HI> had no sooner Orders to go and tell them, but they sent People to
<PB N="60" REF="78"/>
fetch the Arms from us. However Capt. <HI>Drum∣mand,</HI> and his Companions claim'd theirs as their own Property, which they brought on Shoar with them, so would not deliver them; nor would <HI>Dudey</HI>'s Husband. The Negroes well knew we had but few left, and went away seemingly contented for that Night. <HI>Dudey</HI> came back to us, and told us, that they would let us go in the Morning; and Night now coming on, we laid down on the Sand, to repose ourselves as well as our distressed Cir∣cumstances would admit; for besides the Hun∣ger and Fatigue we suffer'd, a thousand Re∣flections came now into our Heads of what Barbarity we had seen them use the Day be∣fore; and that it was now in their Power to do with us what they pleas'd.</P>
<P>DAY began to break, which was the fourth of our miserable Journey, we look'd up as soon as we could see one another, and im∣mediately miss'd Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> Capt. <HI>Stew∣ard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bembo, Dudey,</HI> and her Husband, and four or five more, who went away si∣lently in the Night without saying any thing to us. Now our Fate approach'd, and we were come to the End of this miserable Journey; which, after so bold an Attempt, we undertook for the Preservation of our Lives and Liberty; and a TRAGICAL ON<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it was. For,</P>

<P><PB N="61" REF="80"/>
IT was no sooner Broad-day Light, but the Negroes came to us, and the Prince stood talking with <HI>Sam</HI> a little While; Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> ask'd him what they said to him. He an∣swer'd, <Q>“They wanted to know where Cap∣tain <HI>Drummond</HI> and the rest were.”</Q> They had scarce done speaking, when one of the Princes took hold of me, and deliver'd me to one of his Men; there were three or four Youths more besides myself, and much about my Age, whom they seiz'd, and deliver'd to their People in like manner; who bound our Hands with Ropes.</P>
<P>I was just ty'd, when I saw the same Prince stick his Lance into Capt. <HI>Younge</HI>'s Throat, and afterwards into his Sides. He had no sooner kill'd him, but he went on to another, and the rest of his People immediately fol∣low'd his Example, and soon murder'd eve∣ry Man; they then fell to stripping them of their Cloaths, and even butchering them; for they ript open several of their Bellies. As for my part, I did not know what more mise∣rable Death might be design'd for me; for one of the Generals came with his Lance lifted up to strike me, but was hinder'd by the Man who held me, giving him some Reason that I could not then understand; but I was after∣ward inform'd, he told him I was reserv'd for the King's Grandson. But this would not hin∣der
<PB N="62" REF="81"/>
the Officer from rifling me; for he, feel∣ing my Purse without Side my Breeches, and not readily finding the Pocket-hole, in a Fury, with his Lance cut away my Breeches, and narrowly miss'd my Flesh.</P>
<P>WHEN they had made an End of their But∣chery, and cloath'd themselves with the Gar∣ments of the slain, they march'd away in great Haste for fear of <HI>Port Dauphine</HI> People; for they suppos'd that Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> and the rest had been gone long enough to alarm them, and send some Forces down to our Rescue. Now whether the Negroes might not think we had sent them away on Purpose to get Help; and this might enrage and provoke them to murde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us, I can't say; but certain it is, we were persu'd by a merciless Fate, and were the most unfortunate Wretches in the Universe; for I was afterwards inform'd, that we were scarce march'd off the Spot, and our murder'd People not quite cold, be∣fore two thousand of King <HI>Samuel</HI>'s Men came down to rescue us.</P>
<P>AND now I can't help thinking, that my Reader will say, Why did we not send two or three of our People as soon as ever we got over the River? To which I can only answer, I think we were all infatuated; for with Ease it might have been done, especi∣ally since we had the Woman <HI>Dudey,</HI> to go
<PB N="63" REF="82"/>
with them as an Interpreter, and we might have kept <HI>Sam</HI> with us: But I saw none of these Reasons then, I was but a Youth, and it could not be expected from me. And why Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> was for releasing the King, and afterwards his Son, is what I can't pretend to account for. Certainly, the Plot was well laid, and as well executed at first, but miserably conducted afterwards; and indeed, 'tis scarce credible, that so many People could be so surprisingly stupid as we then were; and this I have often wonder'd at since I have attain'd to a mature Age, and could reflect with more Judgment.</P>
<P>WHAT I have to offer for a Reason in this Affair, is, <Q>“That as All of us had a great Affection for our Captain's Father, so it caus'd us to think the better of what his Son did.”</Q> But I found since to my great Grief, that our young Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> wanted Ripeness of Judgment, and Experience in the World; for Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> as I well re∣member, oppos'd him in several Things, but by whatsoever ill Conduct or Folly we might contribute to the bringing on our Fate, so it was; and I am relating a real Transaction of Matter of Fact, and not inventing a Fiction, or telling what might have been; or what should have been instead of what was; but thus were my Friends massacred, myself and
<PB N="64" REF="83"/>
three more made Slaves: For they sav'd only four of us alive, the Eldest of us was not a∣bove sixteen Years of Age, and we were im∣mediately separated, for they march'd directly off the Spot. As for <HI>Sam,</HI> I reckon him not amongst us, because he went off with the Ne∣groe People: I never saw him after, but I heard he liv'd a Freeman under Deaan <HI>Crindo;</HI> and whether he was so just to us as he should have been is somewhat doubtful. All the Way we went, I had the ghastly Prospect of our Mens mangled Corps in passing thorow the Woods to the River. I was not now so thirsty as when we first pass'd it, but so faint for Want of Victuals that I could scarce stand on my Legs, having had none for three Days. My Master seem'd concern'd for me, but hasten'd over the River before he would bait; and in a proper and pleasant Place by the River∣side, he order'd his People to stop, and make a Fire, and now I was in hopes of eating; for some of his Servants having carry'd Bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on their Backs, they cut it into long Pieces, like Ropes, with the Hyde, and dress'd, and eat it half-roasted according to their Custom, and gave it me in the same Manner; this I thought the sweetest Morsel I ever eat in my Life; tho' a Beggar in <HI>England</HI> would not have touch'd it. We rested here about an Hour, when he who had the Care of me made
<PB N="65" REF="84"/>
Signs to know if I was able to walk; and I, being a little refresh'd, got up and travell'd the remaining Part of the Day with more Ease <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han I expected; they walking leisurely, as I perceiv'd, on purpose to favour me.</P>
<P>AT Night we came to a Wood, where we were to lodge; and there we met three or four Men whom my Master had sent to look for some Cattle, and they brought with them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo Bullocks; one of which my Master sent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his Brother, for him and his People, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he other was kill'd for us; for the Army was now separated, and every Body going home with their respective Chief to their own Habitation. Here my Master came to me, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd gave me a Lance, pointing to me to cut <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut some Beef for myself. I cut about a Pound without the Hyde, which he, perceiving, impu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to my Ignorance, and so cut a Piece with the Hyde, and dress'd it himself for me; which I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, not daring to refuse it. After Supper eve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Man went to pulling up Grass by the Roots <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lye on, and my Guardian pull'd enough <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or himself and me; I then laid myself down, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd he laid by me, but his black Skin smell'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strong, that I was forc'd to turn my Back <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n him all Night. I had but little Rest, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he horrid Spectacle of my massacred Friends <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as constantly before me, and made me start <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om Sleep as soon as I clos'd my Eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="85"/>
AT Break of Day we arose, and after the usual Repast march'd on till Noon, when we baited among some shady Trees near a Pond of Water: This very Pond, I per∣ceiv'd, we had pass'd by three Days before, within two hundred Yards, when we were dy∣ing with Thirst, and the Negroes told us there was no Water near us.</P>
<P>WHILE some were making a Fire, I observ'd several others were digging up and down among the Grass. I wonder'd what they were doing, and went toward one of them, whom I found pulling out of the Ground a long white Root, which I knew to be a <HI>Yam,</HI> having seen them at <HI>Bengal;</HI> they soon furnish'd themselves with what they wanted. I found they grew wild; some of them were a Yard long, and as thick as the Calf of One's Leg; they gave me some, which I roasted and eat, with great Pleasure, instead of Bread with my Beef: They are very good Food.</P>
<P>WE came that Evening to a little Town, which we no sooner enter'd, but the Women and Children came running about me, pinch∣ing and striking me with the Back of their Hands, and shewing other Signs of Derision and Contempt; at which I could not forbear weeping, but when my Guardian observ'd it, he came and drove them away. All the empty Houses were taken up by my Master, his Bro∣ther,
<PB N="67" REF="86"/>
and other Head-men, so that my Guar∣dian and I lay in the open Air. The Abuses I met with from the Women and Children, put a thousand distracting Thoughts into my Head; as, <Q>“that I might be kept alive only to be carry'd to the King and his Son; who would, probably, be fill'd with Resent∣ment at our late seizing, and making them Prisoners; and to gratify their Pleasure and Revenge, might order me to be put to Death before their Faces by some very horrible Torments.”</Q> Such Thoughts as these so dis∣order'd me, that when once thro' Weariness I fell into a Slumber, I had a terrible Dream, which so frighted me, that I started up∣right, and trembl'd in every Joint; and no Sleep could I get that Night.</P>
<P>WHEN it was broad Day-light we march'd on our Way homeward (for now I must call it so) and in three or four Hour's Time we arriv'd at a pretty large Town, with three great <HI>Tamarind</HI> Trees before it. One of the Negroes carry'd a large Shell, which, as soon as he blow'd, sounded like a Post-boy's Horn. This brought the Women to a great House in the Middle of the Town about twelve Foot high; which I soon found to be my Master's. He had scarce seated himself at his Door, when his Wife came out crawling <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n her Hands and Knees till she came to him,

and then lick'd his Feet; when she had done, his Mother did the same; and all the Women in the Town saluted their Husbands in the same Manner: Then every one went to their own Home, except my Master's Brother, who, tho' he had a House, had no Wife to go to, and so he staid.</P>
<P>MY Mistress beckon'd me to go in and sit down, I perceiv'd a great deal of serious Dis∣course pass'd between my Master and her; and by her looking so earnestly at me, while he was talking, I conjectur'd he was telling our tragical Story; and I observ'd the Tears to stand in her Eyes. She order'd some Carra∣vances to be boil'd for our Dinner, they are like <HI>grey Peas;</HI> she gave me some, but they look'd as if they had been boil'd in dirty Water: She perceiving I did not like them, strain'd them off the Water, and put some Milk to them; and then I made a tolerable Meal of them. She gave me a Mat to lye down on, and a Piece of Callico about two Yards to cover me. She made me understand that she wanted to know my Name, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> told her was <HI>Robin.</HI> I, having receiv'd so much Civility from my Mistress, began to be better satisfy'd than before; and then laid me down, and slept without any Fear or Care, as near as I could guess, about four Hours by the Sun. When I wak'd, my Mistress call'd
<PB N="69" REF="88"/>
me by my Name, and gave me some Milk to drink. She talk'd a great deal to me, but I understood not a Word she said. My Ma∣ster was all this While sitting with his Bro∣ther without the Door, regaling themselves with drinking <HI>Toake.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN Night came, I found I was to lye in the same Place; for there was no other Room. My Master and Mistress lay in the Middle, and the whole House was not above fourteen Foot long and twelve wide; so that I laid a-cross close to his Feet. On this manner I liv'd, and lay three or four Nights, till one Night he call'd me by my Name, as I suppose, to know whether I was awake; b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I answer'd him as often as he call'd, which was three or four Times. I fancy he would have been better pleas'd if I had slept sound, and had not heard him; for the next Eve∣ning he carry'd me to his Aunt's House, and made me to understand I must lye there: At this Aunt's House I remain'd Day and Night, and us'd to walk out with her and her Daughter to the Plantations, which were newly made, and where they had sow'd <HI>Gui∣nea</HI> Corn and planted Potatoes. When we came home at Evening, I us'd to go and vi∣sit my Master and Mistress; she us'd to give me Milk, sometimes fresh and sometimes sour. They were not in haste to put me to
<PB N="70" REF="89"/>
Work, and indeed, I could do them but little Service, being wholly ignorant of their Lan∣guage; besides he did not want working Slaves, having above two hundred to serve his Oc∣casions.</P>
<P>My Master, whose Name was <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow,</HI> was Grandson to <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> who was absolute Lord of this Country, and his Wife was the Daughter of a King to the Northward, whom they overcame in a Battle; and she was one of the Captives which <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> took: For this Reason it was she took Compassion on me, being herself a Slave, and in a strange Country, and only preferr'd to be Wife to my Master by Courtesy.</P>
<P>I began after a While to reconcile myself to their manner of Eating, seeing no better was to be had; only I would pull off some of the Hair from the Hyde of the Beef. I us'd of∣ten to think how happy my Brother and Si∣ster liv'd at my Father's Table; and that even some Beggars in <HI>England</HI> far'd better in this respect than I did here. But when I found that No-body liv'd better I made myself easy, and had pretty well got over all my Fears of be∣ing kill'd, till an Accident happen'd, which put me into most dreadful Apprehensions for an Hour's Time. My Master took me along with him one Evening with some of his People into the Woods; I saw Preparations for kill∣ing
<PB N="71" REF="90"/>
and dressing a Bullock, or some such Thing; but seeing none to kill, and it being now dark, I observ'd them to walk about with Caution, and to talk softly, and all the Symptoms of some secret Design; I presently fell a-crying, and thought they were going to kill and eat me; but my Fears were soon over, when I saw two Slaves dragging along a Bullock with a Rope about his Horns, in whose Throat my Master stuck his Lance. They immediately fell to cutting him up, and dressing the Intrails after their Manner. The Carcass was divided and shar'd, and I observ'd every Man went and hid his Meat in some private Place, from whence he might fetch it by Night. When our Business was finish'd, we separated and went home, some one Way and some another; they would not go in a Body for fear of being taken Notice of. I now began to find, that we were all this While stealing other Folks Cattle; I had, indeed, before wonder'd, that the Aunt I liv'd with would often dress Meat in the Night; but this clear'd up the Mystery. Howbeit this was not the only Time I was com∣pell'd to assist in this kind of Theft.</P>
<P>IN three or four Months Time, I began to understand the Names of common Things in their Language. I went one Day with my Master and Mistress into the Plantations, where the Slaves were hoeing the Weeds from
<PB N="72" REF="91"/>
Carravances, which were just above the Ground▪ They gave me a Hoe, but I having no Mind to work, pretended to be very ignorant, and hoed up Carravances and Weeds together; at which they laugh'd, and took away my Hoe. But this Artifice proy'd of little Service to me, for my Master, finding that either I could not, or would not work in the Plantations, was resolv'd to set me about some other Bu∣siness; such, at least, as I could not do wrong▪ So the next Day, he, shewing me his Cattle, told me, I must take Care of them, and drive them to Water; and see that they did not break into his own, and other Peoples Plan∣tations. Now here is no Distinction or Pro∣perty of Lands, but every Man feeds his Beasts, and pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts where he thinks sit. This Business I lik'd better than the other; because there were three or four Boys more of this Town about my Age, who also had Cattle to look after: The worst was, we had a great Way to drive them to Water, and back again; besides, I had a long Tub, which held about three Gallons, to carry home with me; for all the Water we us'd in the House was fetch'd from this Place where the Cattle drank. Notwithstand∣ing this we had Time enough, for we join'd our Herds together, and in the Heat of the Day, when the Cattle would lye down in the Shade, we had three or four Hour's Time to
<PB N="73" REF="92"/>
go into the Woods to get wild Yams. I had been thus long in the Country, and never knew how they struck Fire; till I, wanting to roast some of my Yams, ask'd the Boys where their Fire was? The unlucky Rogues shew'd me their Hands, and said, <HI>Here it is;</HI> but one of them soon shew'd me how they did it. He took one Stick like half a Gun Ram∣mer, and another a great deal thicker, both of one Sort of Wood, and rubb'd the former upon the latter, till there came a Dust from it, then a Smoak, and soon after Fire.</P>
<P>WE sometimes went into the Woods, and stole Peoples Honey, and eat it, as we found it, with the Wax. We us'd, when we could spare time enough, to look for a Creature which I call a <HI>Ground-Hog;</HI> and which in their Language is call'd <HI>Tondruck.</HI> It is about the Bigness of a Cat, but its Nose, Eyes and Ears are like a Hog; it has Bristles also on its Back, and no Tail; the Feet are like a Rabbit's. Their chief Food is Beetles and young Snails, which they rout up with their Noses: They have above twenty young Ones at a Litter, to which they give suck. In the colder Time of the Year (for tho' there is no Season which can properly be call'd <HI>Winter,</HI> yet one Time of the Year is sensibly colder than the other) these Creatures hide themselves in the Ground after a most wonderful manner. They first
<PB N="74" REF="93"/>
dig a Hole right down about two Foot deep, then they work sloping downwards two or three Foot one Way, and then as much ano∣ther, making Angles; all the Way they work they throw the Earth behind with their Fore∣feet, and make it as firm with their Hind-feet as if no Passage had been made; when they have thus work'd a good Way downward and forward, they then work a-slant upwards in the same manner, till they come within half a Foot of the Surface; there they make a little Hole, just big enough for them to turn round in, and here they lye four or five Months without any Appearance of Food all the Time; and what is yet more strange, they are as fat at the End of this Time as when they first went in. It is no small Difficulty to find them, for when we have found out some Marks of the Place, where, we think, they began to dig, we are often frustrated in digging after them; they work so cunningly, that we know not which Way to dig for the Hole they lye in; but we take much Pains after them, for they are excellent Food; their Skin is as brown and crisp as a Pig's. We eat the <HI>Hedge-Hogs</HI> too, but they are nothing near so good; these also get into Holes of Trees, and hide themselves all the cold Weather; where they remain for some Months, and by all that could be perceiv'd, without Food.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="94"/>
THIS keeping of Cattle I lik'd well enough, except in the hot Season; when it was a great Fatigue to drive them every other Day some Miles to Water: But in the colder Season we had no such Occasion, for there falls so great a Dew, that we find it sufficient to drive them into the Grass about Break of Day; and even the Inhabitants of this Part of the Country of <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> who live at a Distance from Water, go out into the Fields with two wooden Platters and a Tub, and in an Hour's Time will gather eight or ten Gallons of Dew-water: It will not keep, but will turn sour in a Day or two.</P>
<P>I had not liv'd this Life above a Year, when my Master went to War, or (as I un∣derstood afterward) rather to plunder a People to the Westward, against whom they have an irreconcileable Enmity; they having surpris'd <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Father in his Town by Night, and kill'd him.</P>
<P>MY Master told me I must not look after Cattle any more; he was going to War, and had other Business for me. I offer'd my Ser∣vice to go with him: He answer'd, they were to travel Night and Day; that it was a long and hard Journey, and I could not be able to undergo the Fatigue; but that my Business must be to look after his Wife, and be her Guardian. He gave me a strict Charge
<PB N="76" REF="95"/>
to lye in the fame House with her, and ne∣ver to let her go out any where without me. After giving her Instructions to the same Pur∣pose, he took his Leave, and with most of his People went on their Journey.</P>
<P>I now liv'd at Ease, and my Mistrefs was very kind to me. I went abroad when she did; eat when she eat; and lay in the House with her; both of us punctually observing my Master's Orders: Nor did I see she had any Uneafiness at it, or Inclination to do other∣wise. But I was not so easy myself, for the Thoughts of my Friends and Native Coun∣try, and the little Probability I had of ever seeing them again, made me very melancholy; insomuch that sometimes I could not for bear weeping.</P>
<P>My Mistress would often ask me whether I was sick, or wanted any Thing; I was loth to tell her the Reason: But one Day, I took the Courage to tell her I wanted to see the other three Lads who were sav'd, and taken Captives when I was. She bid me not to con∣cern myself about that, she would go with me herself, and had a Curiosity to hear us talk in our own Language. She enquir'd of her Neighbours where they were, who told us they were not all together; but that there was one liv'd a little Way off about four or five Miles; so the next Morning we went
<PB N="77" REF="96"/>
thither, and ask'd for the white Boy. He was gone to carry his Fellow-Servants some Victuals to the Plantation, but on a Messen∣ger going to him, he ran home immediately, being as desirous of seeing me as I was him; we embrac'd each other with great Passion, and express'd ourselves rather in Tears than Words. We had been very familiar on Ship∣board, and I delighted to treat him often with Punch; he being a civil Lad, and could play well on the Violin. We lamented our hard Fate, and griev'd to see how wretchedly we look'd, naked, except a small Clout about our Middles, and our Skins spotted like a Leopard's; for we not being us'd to be thus expos'd to the Sun, were scorch'd and flead, and our Skins of∣ten rose up in Blisters. We condol'd each other's Misfortunes, and agreed if either got to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> to give the other's Friends an Account. We enquir'd of one another after the other two Lads; but were equally ignorant what was become of them. My Mistress observ'd us with much Attention, and shew'd a deep Concern at our Grief; but with great Re∣luctancy and many Tears we were forc'd at last to part.</P>
<P>WE had not been at Home two Hours, be∣fore a Messenger arriv'd from my Master with News of his Success, and that he would be at Home in a Fortnight. My Mistress, and all
<PB N="78" REF="97"/>
the Women who had Husbands abroad, went immediately to making of <HI>Toake.</HI> In the mean time I fell dangerously sick with Grief, but was tolerably recover'd before my Master's Return.</P>
<P>HE made his Entry into Town in a trium∣phant Manner: The Trumpet-Shells blowing, and some People before him dancing all the Way with Guns in their Hands. At the En∣trance the foremost Men fir'd their Guns to∣ward the Ground; which is the Signal of a Return with Victory. <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> and his Brother <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> came after them with Attendants; next follow'd the Cattle and Slaves he had taken from the Enemy. After they were seated in Form before my Master <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s House, his Wife, and the Women came as usual, and lick'd his Feet; and the Men too whom he left in the Town behind him when he went to war. I stood all this While looking on, till he espy'd me, and call'd me to him. I went toward him in the usual Posture of the Country when they go toward a great Man; that is, with my Hands lifted up, and in a Praying-Form. When I came near, I gave him the Compli∣ment of <HI>Salamonger Ʋmba;</HI> but did not kneel down as others did, having a sort of super∣stitious Reluctancy to it, thinking it an Ado∣ration that I ought to pay to none but God.
<PB N="79" REF="98"/>
But this Excuse would not serve him, for he ask'd me, if I thought myself too great a Man, to pay him the same Respect his own Wife did, who was a King's Daughter; and also his own Mother. But I peremptorily re∣fus'd it, and told him I would obey all his other Commands, and do what Work he pleas'd; but this I could not do. On this he fell into a Passion, telling me, how he had sav'd me from being kill'd among my Coun∣try-men; and that I was his Slave, &amp;c. but notwithstanding this, I still continu'd obstinate. Hereupon he rose from his Seat, and with his Lance made a Stroke at me with all his Force; but his Brother giving it a Push on one Side, he miss'd me. He was going to repeat his Blow, when his Brother stood up between us, and begg'd for me: He refus'd to pardon me, except I would lick his Feet. His Brother desir'd he would give him a little Time to talk with me, which he did; and af∣ter he had talk'd with me, and told me the Danger of not doing it, and that in submitting to it I did no more than what many great Princes were forc'd to do, when taken Priso∣ners. I found, at length, 'twas best to comply; so I went in and ask'd Pardon, and perform'd the Ceremony as others had done. He told me, he readily forgave me; but would make me sensible I was a Slave. I did not much
<PB N="80" REF="99"/>
regard his Threats, for seeing no Hopes of returning to <HI>England,</HI> I set but little Value on my Life.</P>
<P>THE next Day I fell into another Broil much more dangerous than the former; from which I did not expect to escape.</P>
<P>MY Master perform'd the Ceremony of Thanksgiving to God for his Deliverance from the Hazards of War, and for the Vic∣tory obtain'd; which is done after this Man∣ner: <Q>“The People have in their Houses a small portable Utensil consecrated to re∣ligious Uses, and is a sort of a Houshold Altar; which they call the <HI>Owley.</HI> It is made of a peculiar Wood, in Bits neatly join'd, and making almost the Form of an Half∣moon with the Horns downwards, between which are plac'd two <HI>Alligator</HI>'s Teeth; this is adorn'd with divers sorts of Beads, and a Sash fasten'd to it behind; which a Man is to tye about his Waste when he goes to War.”</Q> [I shall not here pretend to give a full Account of their religious Wor∣ship; for I had not been long enough in the Country, to know the true Meaning of what they did and said.] <Q>“”However I observ'd them to bring two Forks from the Wood, and place them in the Ground; on which was laid a Beam, slender at each End, and about six Foot long, with two or three
<PB N="81" REF="100"/>
Pegs in it; on this they hung the <HI>Owley.</HI> Behind it was a long Pole, to which was ty'd a Bullock: They had a Pan with some live Coals, on which they strow'd a sweet∣scented Gum, and plac'd it under the <HI>Owley.</HI> Then they took some of the Hairs of the Tail, and from under the Chin, and the Eye-brows of the Ox, and put them on the <HI>Owley.</HI> Then <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> my Master, us'd some Gesture with Knives in his Hand, and made his Prayer; in which the People join'd. They next threw the Ox on the Ground with his Legs ty'd, and the <HI>Deaan</HI> cut his Throat; for they having no Priests, the chief Man, whether of the Country, Town, or Family, performs all divine Offices himself. The People being seated on Mats round about, my Master call'd to me to sit down, and say as the People said, which I refus'd. He went on with his Devotion, and when he had done, he takes the <HI>Owley</HI> in one Hand and his Lance in the other, and came toward me, asking me, Which I would rather choose, either to assist in their Ceremony of re∣turning Thanks, or be struck thorow with his Lance. Now I, thinking this sort of Worship to be wicked Idolatry, and that they paid their Devotions to the <HI>Owley</HI> as a God, told him, I would sooner dye than
<PB N="82" REF="101"/>
worship false Gods. He went back to put the <HI>Owley</HI> in its Place, and came to me: He took me by the Hand to lead me out of Town, and kill me; his Brother, and all the People about him, us'd many Argu∣ments and Intreaties to persuade him against killing me; but in vain, till his Brother at last grew resolute, and told him, he would that Minute leave him, and see his Face no more, if he offer'd to act such a Piece of Cruelty; and rose up to be gone. When <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> saw his Brother go∣ing in good Earnest, he call'd him back; and told him, He would spare my Life, but I should have a very tiresome One with him; for he would be reveng'd on me one Way or another for my Contempt of him. <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> told him, he should not concern himself about that; all he begg'd for was my Life. On this he wink'd upon me to kneel down, and lick his Feet; which I did, asking Pardon and thanking him for sparing me. When I got up, I, of my own Accord, kneel'd down to <HI>Deaan Sambo,</HI> and lick'd his Feet very sincerely and heartily, thanking him for having thus twice sav'd my Life.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN all Things were settl'd, I was or∣der'd to my former Post of <HI>Cow-Keeper.</HI> I had a great deal of Trouble sometimes with these
<PB N="83" REF="102"/>
Cattle, for they are very nimble and unruly; they are fine Beasts, and notwithstanding their Size, which is the largest in the World, they would jump over high Fences. They have a Hump between their Shoulders, almost like a Camel's, all Fat and Flesh; some of which might weigh, as near as I can guess, about three or fourscore Pound; they are also beautifully colour'd, some streak'd like a Tyger, others black with white Spots, and some white with black Spots; or half black and half white. They do not give so much Milk as our Cattle in <HI>England,</HI> nor will they suffer themselves to be milk'd at any Time, till the Calf has first suck'd; so that they keep a Calf for every Cow all the Year, or till the Cow is big again; and they seldom miss a Season. Here are al∣so some Sheep with great heavy Tails, like <HI>Turky</HI> Sheep; but they are not woolly as ours, rather hairy as a Goat. Here are also Goats, a few, like those in other Nations. They bring up no Hogs, there are enough in the Country, and very mischievous to the Plan∣tations; for they will sometimes break in, rout up and destroy the Potatoes and other Things. So that we are forc'd to set Traps to catch them; but in this Country of <HI>Anterndroea</HI> No∣body eats them, except the poor and ordi∣nary People.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="103"/>
WHILE I was peaceably looking after my Cattle, and every Thing seem'd quiet and easy, a sudden Piece of News chang'd at once the Scene of our Affairs, and call'd my Master to War in good Earnest.</P>
<P>IT is a common Practice sor Parties to go out, and surprize their Enemies by Night, when least expected: On these Expeditions every Man generally carries a piece of Meat in his Hand, and getting into the Town in the Dead of Night, they throw the Meat to the Dogs to prevent their Barking. When they are all enter'd, one fires a Musquet, and making no other Noise, the Inhabitants suddenly ri∣sing, and hastily getting out of the Doors of their low Huts in a stooping Posture, are stabb'd with Lances; the young Ones and Wo∣men they take captive, and drive away with them all the Cattle they can find, burn the Town, and return home by private unprac∣tis'd Ways. On this manner did <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow,</HI> his Brother, and some others of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s People enter some of the King of <HI>Mefaughla</HI>'s remote and defenceless Towns; to retaliate which on <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s People, he musters an Army of three thousand Men, and enter'd <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> resolving either to fight him in the Field, or attack him in his own Town <HI>Fenno-arevo,</HI> and burn it; and accordingly sent a Messenger to <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> to tell him
<PB N="85" REF="104"/>
so: To which he answer'd, <Q>“”He would not stir out of the Town, but wait for him there; and hop'd he would be as good as his Word.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> therefore, summons all his People to come to him, and be ready at hand in <HI>Fenno-arevo,</HI> or the neighbouring Villages. He had four Sons who were Chiefs of Towns, and had People under them; besides Nephews and Grandsons. His Sons were <HI>Deaan Mun∣dumbo, Deaan Frukey, Deaan Trodaughe,</HI> and <HI>Deaan Chahary;</HI> but it was his great Misfor∣tune, that <HI>Deaan Chahary</HI> was gone with five hundred able Men to traffick into <HI>Feraingher;</HI> which is <HI>Augustine</HI>-Bay Country.</P>
<P>'Tis their Custom in Time of War to hide their Wives, Children, and Cattle in remote secret Places in the Woods, that the Enemy may not find them when they plunder the Country; but the Women and Children are never with the Cattle, lest their bellowing should make a Discovery. The Women can, for the most part, secure themselves, by draw∣ing a Bough after them as they go to their hiding Place; which prevents their Tract from being follow'd. On this manner did my Ma∣ster, and his People secure their Wives, Chil∣dren and Cattle; with the latter I was left, and therefore am not able to give an exact Account of this War, knowing only what was
<PB N="86" REF="105"/>
told me when they came back; which in ge∣neral was as follows.</P>
<P><Q>“”THAT <HI>Deaan Woozington,</HI> the King, and his Son <HI>Chemermaundy,</HI> and <HI>Ryopheck,</HI> his Ne∣phew, a gallant Man, commanded the Army of <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> enter'd the Country without Opposition; for <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> having receiv'd his Message, that he would come, and burn him in his Town, took Care first to secure the Families and Cattle of his People, and then drew all his armed Men there, re∣resolving to wait his Coming; but <HI>Deaan Mundumber, Frukey,</HI> and the younger Chiefs, had not Patience to hear of his passing qui∣etly without Resistance; so they press'd the King against his Will to let them go out with two thousand Men, and oppose him in his March. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was resolute, and would not stir out of his Town. This Ar∣my was commanded in Chief by <HI>Deaan Mun∣dumber</HI> and <HI>Frukey,</HI> who behav'd themselves with great Bravery and good Conduct, first sending Word to <HI>Deaan Woozington,</HI> that they were come by their Father's Command to give him a Welcome into their Country, and hop'd he would meet them. To which he answer'd, He would assuredly see them, and make himself welcome; and was as good as his Word. They join'd Battle, and <HI>Mundumber</HI> was forc'd to retire; which he
<PB N="87" REF="106"/>
did in good Order after a sharp and obsti∣nate Fight; in which <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI>'s Son was dangerously wounded. <HI>Deaan Mundumber</HI> return'd to his Father with eight hundred Men, and would have persuaded him to go out with his Forces, and give <HI>Deaan Woo∣zington</HI> Battle; but the old King was obsti∣nate, and would not: So <HI>Mundumber</HI> re∣main'd with him, fortifying the Town as well as they could.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AFTER this <HI>Deaan Frukey</HI> and <HI>Trodaughe</HI> took a Pass between two Hills, and cutting down great Trees to defend them, they had en∣tirely stop'd <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI>'s Progress, tho' he attack'd them in a vigorous Manner, and was as gallantly receiv'd and repuls'd; till <HI>Ryopheck,</HI> by the Help of a Man who knew the Country, got by a By-path behind them; and <HI>Deaan Woozington,</HI> at the same time with <HI>Ryopheck,</HI> charging them again, <HI>Frukey,</HI> and his Brethren were forc'd to re∣tire; which they did with great Resolu∣tion thorow <HI>Ryopheck</HI>'s Party. In this Ac∣tion <HI>Ryopheck,</HI> who was always in the hot∣test Place, did with very much Difficulty escape.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”IN the End <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> got to <HI>Fenno-arevo,</HI> and attack'd it in a vigorous Manner; but was as bravely repuls'd: <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> and his Sons resisting till
<PB N="88" REF="107"/>
they were overpower'd; and when their Enemies were got within the Town, they even then defended every Inch of Ground, till <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> himself was forc'd to cut down some of the Trees, which are their Walls, to make a Passage for their Escape. He so much rely'd on his own Strength and Courage, that he kept his Wife and Daugh∣ter in his House, tho' all the other Wo∣men and Children were sent away; who fell into the Hands of <HI>Deaan Woozington,</HI> and were made Captives. The Town was burnt, after having been first plunder'd of such Trifles as their Riches consist in, the chief of which are <HI>Beads;</HI> these they often dig Holes for, and hide: So that there is nothing to be got but <HI>Iron Shavels, Hoes, Earthen</HI> and <HI>Wooden Dishes, Spoons,</HI> &amp;c. some Cattle, indeed, they found, which were brought into the Town to sustain them∣selves during the Siege; and in such Cases these Cattle live well enough on the That∣ches of the Houses. They had also fill'd a great many Tubs with Water.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was inconsolable for the Loss of his Wife and Daughter, and like a di∣stracted Man; till his Sons told him, if he would now join them, as he should have done at first, they were yet able to deal with <HI>Deaan Woozington.</HI> And accordingly they

muster'd all their Forces into one Army, and made a Number equal to their Ene∣mies. <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> not being appris'd of this, was detaching a thousand Men to plunder the Country, search for and bring in all the Women, Children, and Cattle they could find; as they always do after an entire Victory. When <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> ap∣pear'd in his View with his potent Army, and sent Messengers to tell him, he must either deliver the Queen and Princess, with the other People and Cattle he had got, or immediately decamp, and fight them. <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> sent him Word, he did not de∣sire to keep his Wife and Daughter, nor did he come for Slaves or Cattle, he hav∣ing enough already; but he, <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> had sent him a Challenge, bragging that his Strength was superiour to any of the Kings on the Island by the Addition of white Men, of which he boasted to have had a great Number, and which he came to see, but finding none, he now hop'd that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Pride was a little humbl'd; so he was ready to send him his Wife and Daugh∣ter again: But for the few Slaves and Cattle he had taken, his People should keep them to make some Recompence for the Robbe∣ries, which <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> and others had com∣mitted in his Country.</Q></P>

<Q>“”IN the End a Peace was concluded, and sworn to by the Generals of each Side, with the usual Solemnity of killing an Ox, and each General eating a Piece of the Liver from off the Point of a Lance, and wishing that whoever fires the first Gun, it might be the Destruction of him. The Ceremony being over, Rejoicings were made on both Sides▪ <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> return'd into his own Country, and <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> to rebuild his ruin'd Town, which is done almost as soon as destroy'd; and all his Chiefs each with his People to their respective Homes.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN we were settl'd again, I, and three Boys more, who belong'd to some principal Men of our Town were sent some Miles off with two hundred Head of Cattle to live by ourselves, and look after them. We had not among them above five or six which gave Milk, and this was all the Provision we had to live upon; what we wanted more, we must search for in the Woods, and get it where, and when we could find it. My Mistress gave me an earthen Pot to warm my Milk in, a Calabash to drink out of, and a Mat to lye upon for my Bed. My Master gave me an Hatchet to make Fences with, and a Lance; telling me, I must sight if any Body came to steal my Cattle: He also gave me a new Clout to wear after the manner of their Country, my other be∣ing
<PB N="91" REF="110"/>
worn out; this for the ordinary People is not much broader than a Napkin: They call it a <HI>Lamber,</HI> and so shall I for the fu∣ture; the Name of <HI>A—se-Clout</HI> (by which our <HI>English</HI> Seamen call this Garment to signify its Use) being too gross an Expression.</P>
<P>WE drove our Cattle to the designed Place, and the first Thing we set about was to build us an House, which we soon finish'd; for it took us no more Time than one Day and an half. We next finish'd our Cow-Pen, and a small One for the Calves, to keep them from sucking while we milk'd the Cows. Our House was a poor little Hut, not well-thatch'd, and it being now the rainy Time (which is their Winter, and is sometimes very cold) we had but a very indifferent Lodging. We kept a Fire, and happy was he who could first get to lye down nearest it; all the Covering we had was our Lambers, which we pull'd off to lay over us. Now, it was, I felt the Misery of my Slavery, being almost famish'd; for good and substantial Food we could get none, ex∣cept now and then a small Fowl, which creeps on the Ground; and which we took in Traps.</P>
<P>WE liv'd thus almost three Months, and having eat no other Flesh, we began to con∣trive the killing one of our Master's Beasts, and dress it secretly. A great many Projects were talk'd of, till at length I propos'd one
<PB N="92" REF="111"/>
which was agreed to; which was, to kill a Cow, by stabbing her in the Side with a Stick made sharp; and make another Cow's Horn bloody, which belong'd to the same Man, that he might think it was done by goring. But then a Dispute arose, whose Beast should be hill'd; for every one was for shifting it from his Master. However, I soon determin'd that, by drawing Lots with four Sticks shorter than each other; and I so manag'd it, by keeping the longest in my Hand, that it came not to my Master's Turn to have his Cow kill'd.</P>
<P>WHEN the Business was done, away ran the Boy to acquaint his Master, that one Heifer was kill'd by another; he came immediately with his Family, and finding a Cow with a bloody Horn, concluded it was done by her; so giving it some Blows in a Passion, he fell <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o cutting up the dead Beast, and gave us a good-large Piece besides the Guts and Legs; and then went home again. Thus far we succeeded well, but our chief Design was, un∣der Colour of having Meat giv'n us by our Ma∣sters, to kill another Heifer; and if any Per∣son came to see us (as we were not far from People, tho' we were from our own Homes) who should ask how we came by Beef? we could tell them our Masters gave it us. But we grew too venturous by our Success, for one Day having kill'd one, which stray'd from
<PB N="93" REF="112"/>
some other People amongst ours; our Masters, unluckily for us, came to see their Cattle, which they found in the Cow-Pens, but none of us being near, they began to suspect us; and therefore, dividing themselves to make a more diligent Search, one of them heard a Noise in the Wood, like cutting down Trees, where we were very busy; and, following the Sound, soon smelt roast Meat: Our Dogs too, like ourselves, were so hungry, that they minded nothing but their Bellies; tho' at other Times they were very watchful, and would give us Notice if a Mouse did but stir: Howbeit our Masters surpris'd us, and came at once amongst us with their Guns cock'd, cry∣ing out, <HI>Vonne terach com boar;</HI> which in Eng∣lish is, <HI>Kill them, Sons of Bitches.</HI></P>
<P>I need not relate what a Fright we were in, expecting nothing but immediate Death; and, indeed, it prov'd but little better to the other three. They took Time to ask us whose Beast it was, and being inform'd it was a strange one; they told us, the Crime was the same; for if we had got the Habit of killing Cattle privately, they knew theirs must some Time be our Prey when no others offer'd; and, therefore, were resolv'd to punish us. Hereupon my Comrades Masters took each his Slave, and in an Instant (Ah, woful Fate!) castrated them. I, not liking that sort of
<PB N="94" REF="113"/>
Punishment, fell down at my Master's Feet, and told him how careful I had been of his Cattle; and that I had rather run the Risque of my Life, by his shooting me at a reasonable Di∣stance, than sustain so great a Loss. To this he listen'd, and taking me out of the Wood, he ty'd my Arms behind me round a Tree, and plac'd himself at a great Distance, (I suppose about fourscore Yards) then seeming to take good Aim at me, fir'd, but miss'd me: Whe∣ther he did it on purpose I can't say, but I am apt to think he did; imagining the Terror was enough, and seeing how severely the others were punish'd. They took their Leaves of us, telling us, if ever they found us doing the like again, nothing should save us from im∣mediate Death.</P>
<P>THEY were no sooner gone from us, but I began to reflect on the Injustice of our Masters, who, tho' they had Cattle of their own, would often oblige us to go with them on several of their thievish Expeditions, and yet so se∣verely punish'd us for one poor Crime to satisfy our Hunger. However, after all, I was forc'd to be Doctor to my poor afflicted Comrades, for their Masters took no Care of them; so I warm'd some Water, and wash'd off the Blood, and dress'd their Wounds: I was also forc'd, while we remain'd there, to look after all the Cattle, and to milk them
<PB N="95" REF="114"/>
too; for they were not recover'd, when Or∣ders was brought us to return home with our Cattle. My Comrades being but just able to walk, I made the Messenger, who came to us, help to drive the Cattle.</P>
<P>WHEN I came home, I was soon made sen∣sible, that <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro,</HI> King of <HI>Antenosa,</HI> had giv'n my Master this Trouble, by march∣ing his People into <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> and demanding of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> Satisfaction for the Murder of the white Men. Now, tho' this was two Years and an half before (for so long I had been in the Country) yet I soon heard that Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> Capt. <HI>Steward,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bembo,</HI> and the rest, who escap'd the Night before the Massacre, were with him; and that there had not been, in all that Time, a Ship come to <HI>Port-Dauphine,</HI> for them to return home in▪ but that notwithstanding they liv'd free, and intirely at their own Disposal. This <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI> was King <HI>Samuel,</HI> whom I mention'd before; whose History I shall relate in its pro∣per Place, and whose Dominions were on the other Side of the River <HI>Manderra.</HI></P>
<P>I was no sooner come home, but I was taken from the Cattle, and put under the Care of two Men; who were to guard me, and see that I did not run away to King <HI>Samuel.</HI> The next Day, we heard the <HI>Antenosa</HI> People were within ten or twelve Miles of our Town, which put
<PB N="96" REF="115"/>
them all into a great Fright and Hurry. The Cattle were sent one Way, and the Women and Children into the Woods another, and poor <HI>Robin,</HI> their white Slave, along with them with his Hands ty'd behind him: But I had not been long there, before a Messenger came in great haste to my Mistress, ordering her <Q>“to send me to my Master in the Camp; for the white Men were to buy me, and had agreed to give two Buccanere Guns.”</Q> My Mistress was loth to part with me, I dissembl'd as much as I could, and pretended I should have been glad to stay with them now, since I had been so long among them; tho' at the same Time I had much ado to conceal my Joy. I kneel'd down, and lick'd her Feet, thanking her for her Civilities; and away I went with the Messenger, in great Hopes now, of seeing some of my Country∣men again, and getting to <HI>England.</HI> But see how Fortune tantaliz'd me! It was about twen∣ty Miles, as I guess, to the Camp, where my Master was; and it might be somewhat after Midnight when we arriv'd there: My Master, set a Watch over me the remaining Part of the Night, and made me swear I would never tell the Hiding-places of their Wives and Cattle; which I very readily did.</P>
<P>THE next Morning King <HI>Samuel</HI> sent to know if I was come, and they would let an hun∣dred
<PB N="97" REF="116"/>
Men come down with me between the two Camps, and he would send an hundred to meet them with the two Buccanere Guns. Which being agreed to, <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> order'd my Master to go with the Party; and King <HI>Samuel,</HI> seeing them coming forward, order d his Men to go, and meet them; among whom were Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> and the rest of the white Men. When we came pretty near one another, Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> being glad to see me, call'd to me by my Name; and ask'd me how I did. My Master, who stood by me, clapp'd his Hand upon my Mouth, and vow'd if I offer'd to speak he would kill me; so that I durst not answer. Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> finding I did not answer, thought, as I suppose, that I could not hear; whereupon he, and the white Men came nearer to us. My Master seeing them advancing, thought they came to take me by Force, and cheat them of the two Guns; he, therefore, order'd his Men to fire at them: So that instead of a Parley, and changing me for the two Guns, a Skirmish began; the Shot and Lances flew at one ano∣ther, and both Armies advanc'd to support each other's Party. I was immediately sent away under a strong Guard to the Woods, where I parted from my Mistress the Night before: So that this fine Prospect of Delive∣rance was only a short, transitory Dream of
<PB N="98" REF="117"/>
Liberty, which immediately vanish'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and made me only feel the Misery of Slavery more sensibly than before. I know not well which Way I went back, but, sure I am, it was insuch-like Disorder of Mind as a condemn'd Criminal has, when going to Execution: But in a few Hours I found myself in my former Station; my Legs in <HI>Parra-Pingo</HI> (a Fasten∣ing almost like Fetters) for fear I should run away: My old Companions were about me, my Mistress, and the Women very glad to see me again; but I was too dull to compli∣ment them, they could have nothing from me but Tears and Exclamations at my hard For∣tune. I wish'd for Death, and was very near being gratify'd in my Desire two Days after.</P>
<P>THE next Day News was brought us of <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI>'s returning back to his own Country; he being (as they said) forc'd to retire by <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> tho' the <HI>Antenosa</HI> Army was twice their Number. We were also or∣der'd to go home, and I was releas'd from <HI>Parra-Pingo,</HI> and allow'd to walk at Liberty; my Guard being also discharg'd.</P>
<P>THE Day following came <HI>Deaan Mevarrow, Deaan Sambo,</HI> and their little Army, entring the Town with great Pomp and Grandeur, as if they had gain'd some notable Victory; tho' I heard of nothing but a little Bush-fighting and Ambuscadoes. However, the <HI>Deaan</HI> sat
<PB N="99" REF="118"/>
himself down with his Brother, other Chiefs and the rest in the usual Form before his House: My Mistress, according to Custom crept out to lick her Hero's Feet; when she had done, the rest of the Women did the like; and after them the Slaves, among whom was myself. As I was getting up to go away, he bad me stay; I stood some Time hearing him tell his Wife, what a Coward <HI>Deaan Tu∣ley-Noro</HI> was to run away, tho' he had twice their Number of Men. After he had done, he turn'd his Head, and with an angry Coun∣tenance, ask'd me, <Q>“What the white Men said to me when they call'd me? Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> they only ask'd me how I did? And nothing else, <HI>said he. I reply'd,</HI> No, Sir.”</Q> At this he rose up, cock'd his Gun, and put∣ting the Muzzle to my Breast, with his Finger to the Trigger, <HI>said,</HI> <Q>“If I did not tell him the Truth he would shoot me that Instant.”</Q> I was not much daunted, not regarding my Life in the melancholy Humour I then was, so with very little Concern, I told him the same again. At which he pull'd the Trigger, but Providence being pleas'd to preserve me for some other Purpose, the Cock snapp'd and miss'd Fire. Whether the Prime was wet in the Pan, or by what Miracle it was, I can't say; but he took his Lance to stab me, when his Brother, and the rest of his chief Men ran
<PB N="100" REF="119"/>
in between us; and told him, <Q>“It was bar∣barous and cruel; and that he had better have kill'd me at first, than to have sav'd me only to terrify me with Death on eve∣ry trivial Occasion; there being no Reason at all for this.”</Q> With much Persuasion he return'd to his Seat, and told them, <Q>“There was Reason to suspect the white Men had form'd a Plot to do some unfair Thing; else why did they come nearer than they should have done?”</Q> And, indeed, their Fears proceeded from a natural Dread they have on them of white Men, ten of whom will drive fifty black Men before them. And then Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> and the rest being compleat∣ly arm'd with Pistols in their Girdles, made them the more terrible to them. What was the true Reason of King <HI>Samuel</HI>'s retiring thus I don't know; but when this Broil was over, I was very inquisitive to understand the whole Transaction, which was thus related to me.</P>
<P><Q>“”King <HI>Samuel</HI>'s Design was to march di∣rectly to <HI>Fenno-arcvo,</HI> and come upon <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> before he could be provided for him: His Way lay thorow a large Plain, call'd <HI>Ambovo,</HI> leading to a great Wood, which they must also pass thorow. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> having more timely Notice than they ex∣pected, laid an Ambuscado in the Wood; King <HI>Samuel</HI> was lame of the Court, and
<PB N="101" REF="120"/>
carry'd on Mens Shoulders, him and great Part of his Army they suffer'd to enter the Wood, and then the Signal being given, <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Men rose, and attack'd them so vigorously, and with such Advantage, (knowing the Wood, which the others did not;) that King <HI>Samuel</HI> himself had like to have been taken; but was gallantly de∣fended by the white Men, and others of his bravest People. However, they were forc'd to retire into the Plain, where they encamp'd, as did also <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s People close by the Wood-side, and even in it; securing themselves by that Means from the superior Number of the <HI>Antenosa</HI> Army, which, they say, consisted of six thousand Men; and here they came to parlying. King <HI>Samuel</HI> sent one of his Chiefs to tell <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> That he came not for Lucre of his Cattle, nor for Slaves; but he hav∣ing been brought up among white Men, all such were his Friends; and he look'd on himself oblig'd in Duty and Honour to de∣mand some Satisfaction of <HI>Deaan Crindo▪</HI> for the white Men which he had barbarously kill'd; and if there were any left alive, he desir'd to have them, that he might send them to their native Country.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> gave good Attention to the Messenger, and then return'd an Answer to
<PB N="102" REF="121"/>
this Purpose: That he wonder'd <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI> should trouble himself with o∣ther People's Business; as to the white Men who were ship-wreck'd on his Coast, he look'd upon it, that the great God had sent them there; he, having a potent Ene∣my, and knowing the white Men to be skil∣ful in War, as also of couragious Spirits, did design not to flight the Help his Gods had sent him; but to desire their Assistance in his Wars: Accordingly he treated them with the greatest Civility as Friends, and maintain'd them as well as his Country would afford, they wanting for nothing he could procure them; and after all, tho' they had, in a violent Manner, seiz'd him and Prince <HI>Murnanzack,</HI> and made them Pri∣soners, he would condescend so far to <HI>Tuley-Noro</HI> to tell him (tho' under no Obligations to give him an Account of his Actions or make Excuses) that neither himself nor Prince <HI>Murnanzack</HI> were present, or any ways aiding or assisting in their Deaths; but that Action was done by some of his Sons and Nephews, to revenge their bar∣barous seizing him and Prince <HI>Murnanzack.</HI> And to convince him, he does not tell him this as an Excuse thro' a mean-spirited Fear; since his Sons did think fit to do it, he will justify and defend them in it; and thinks
<PB N="103" REF="122"/>
they did the white Men Justice: That he knows but of one living out of four Boys that were sav'd at that Time; who, he finds by Inquiry, is in <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s Hands; as to the other three, one dy'd by Sickness, another was kill'd by his Master for his Wickedness; and the third is run away, or lost; for No-body could tell what became of him: And as to him who was living, he should not have him, without giving such a Price as his Master thought proper.</Q></P>
<P>Now I am apt to think by several Circum∣stances, that this Answer might seem to King <HI>Samuel</HI> to carry some Reason with it; and That, in my Opinion, prevail'd more on him to re∣turn to <HI>Antenosa,</HI> than all the Force my brag∣ging Master talk'd of, or than all that <HI>Crindo</HI>'s Army was able to do.</P>
<P>HOWEVER they told me, that King <HI>Samuel,</HI> in his Reply to this, excus'd the Violence the white Men offer'd to <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> by say∣ing, <Q>“That they did it only to secure their own Flight from him for their Liberty; that they did not, nor ever design'd to hurt, or wrong him: However since there was no raising the dead to Life, if he would send six hundred Head of Cattle, it should be taken for a Satisfaction: As for me, he was content to buy me; and desir'd to know
<PB N="104" REF="123"/>
what they demanded for me. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> sent Word, That as to me, they requir'd two Buccaneer Guns; but as to his De∣mand of six hundred Head of Cattle, he was not to have Laws and arbitrary Com∣mands impos'd on him by any King in the World; that if they wanted Provision, he was ready to make them a Present; for it should not be said <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI> came to see him, and he would not give him a Dinner; and, therefore, had order'd his Peo∣ple to give him six Oxen, and a Bull.”</Q></P>
<P>SOME said, King <HI>Samuel</HI> resented this as an Affront, and would have attack'd the <HI>Antern∣droeans</HI> immediately; but was dissuaded by Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> and the rest, there being no Likelyhood of any Engagement but Bush-fight∣ing; which must be to the Advantage of the <HI>Anterndrocans</HI> in their own Country; and in Possession of the Wood: So finding that no other Terms were to be had, they accepted of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Present, which his Men did indeed want, and went on in their Parley about me; the Success of which you have already seen. But,</P>
<P>I must not pass over a Piece of Supersti∣tion practis'd here: There are a Sort of People in this Country, who pretend to a great deal of Knowledge in the Magical Virtue of Roots, Trees, Plants, and other such like Matters;
<PB N="105" REF="124"/>
and of their Power to perform strange Things by Charms made of them. One of these Con∣jurers, or <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> (as the Natives call them) advis'd <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> to take a certain Powder which he gave him, and to strip off a Piece of the Skin of the Tail of the Bull, which he ad∣vis'd should be a white One too, because <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI> was a whitish Man; and to put this Magical Powder on the Wound, as also to mix some of it with Water, and give it to the Bull to drink before it was giv'n to the <HI>Antenosa</HI> Men. Now this was not done to make the Creature un∣wholsome, and thereby procure Deaths or Dis∣eases amongst their Enemies in the common Way; but it was expected to work some Witch∣craft, or super-natural Operation on them. Now it happen'd in two Months after this, that King <HI>Samuel</HI> died; he was at that Time very infirm, and had been so long before; which with the Fatigue of this Journey might hasten his End. But there were not wanting People superstitious enough, to think his Death was the Effect of this Conjuration, tho' we might be sure he eat none of the Bull, there being Oxen at the same Time; for these Ne∣groes would not make Oxen any more than we white Men, did they not know them to be, in every respect, preferable to Bulls.</P>
<P>AND since I have had an Occasion to say so much of King <HI>Samuel,</HI> I suppose my Reader
<PB N="106" REF="125"/>
will have Curiosity enough to desire to know, who this King with a Christian Name was; and for what Reason he should endeavour to assist us, and revenge our Wrongs. His living near the Sea, and the Riches he and his People got by trading with the <HI>English,</HI> may pass as a sufficient Reason for the Friendship this King shew'd to our People; and, indeed, all over the Island they are Friends to the <HI>English,</HI> ex∣cept in some few Places remote from the Sea: But King <HI>Samuel</HI>'s History being very singu∣lar, I shall here relate it as I learn'd it at Times from the Natives. Whether any of the <HI>French</HI> Authors of Voyages have wrote any Thing of him I know not; nor have I had the Opportunity of seeing their Histories of <HI>Ma∣dagascar</HI> to compare with this of mine: It is exactly as the People themselves told me, and I shall not alter, or vary from their Account of it, whether it is agreeable to what others have said, or no.</P>
<P><Q>“”THIS Part of the Country, to which the <HI>French</HI> have given the Name of <HI>Port-Dau∣phine,</HI> is call'd, in the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Language, <HI>Antenosa.</HI> About ninety Years ago, there came hither two <HI>French</HI> Ships; on what Ac∣count, Voyage, or Business they were, I can't learn; but they came to an Anchor close under the Land in a very good Har∣bour. The Captains observing that there
<PB N="107" REF="126"/>
were Plenty of Cattle, and all Provisions, as also a very good Soil, concluded that one of them should stay here, and make a Settlement; hereupon they cast Lots who should remain on the Island, and he on whom the Lot fell was Captain <HI>Mesmerrico.</HI></Q> [I must here desire my Reader to take Notice, that this is the Name the Natives told me, who, very likely, being unlearned, may pro∣nounce it very different from the true Name; but besides, as it is also some Time since, and they have no Writings or Records of Things, so consequently, they can have no History, but by Tradition, as the Father tells the Son, and so on to succeeding Generations.] <Q>“”This Captain <HI>Mesmerrico</HI> landed with two hundred white Men, well arm'd, with Store of Am∣munition and other Necessaries proper for the Building of a Fort, which they imme∣diately began. The Natives no sooner ob∣serv'd their Intention, but they endeavour'd to hinder them; this ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a War, in which the <HI>French</HI> were the Conquerors, who took at several Times many Prisoners: In this War, the King of <HI>Antenosa</HI> and his Brother were kill'd; and amongst many o∣ther Children which were taken, the King's Son was one. When the <HI>French</HI> had sup∣press'd the Natives, and built their Fort, the Ships sail'd away to <HI>France,</HI> and carry'd
<PB N="108" REF="127"/>
this young Prince, and many other Cap∣tives with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BY that Time the Ships had been gone a Year, the Natives began to be better re∣concil'd to the <HI>French-men;</HI> only they pri∣vately resented the carrying away their young Prince, and did not well like to be govern'd at the Pleasure of Foreigners; however the <HI>French,</HI> by their obliging Be∣haviour, gain'd Friendship among them; marrying, and living up and down at Peace in several Towns distant from each other, not above five or six in a Place. They also join'd with the Natives in their Wars a∣gainst a King, who liv'd to the North-ward, whom they routed, and took many Slaves and Cattle. On this manner they liv'd some Years with great Security, neglecting their Fort, and spreading themselves all over the whole Country of <HI>Antenosa;</HI> having Families and many Children, the Natives observing them to increase, and remembring their Prince whom they barbarously sent away, and see∣ing them thus dispers'd, thought this the only Opportunity to free themselves from the Usurpation of Foreigners: Hereupon they form'd a Plot to destroy all the white Men in one Day; and accordingly a <HI>Wed∣nesday</HI> being appointed, it was executed; and they left not a white Man alive in <HI>Antenosa.</HI></Q></P>

<Q>“”NOT long after a <HI>French</HI> Ship came there as usual: The <HI>Maurominters,</HI> or Slaves, who had a Love for the <HI>French,</HI> got a Canoe, and went off to them, and told them their Coun∣try-men were all murder'd. The Captain was much concern'd at the News, but could not revenge them; being glad to get safe away himself, without once attempting to go on Shore.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY, having now No-body to interrupt them, put their Government into its Ori∣ginal Form, by choosing a King who was the nearest related to their former; for there was no other Son but him whom the <HI>French</HI> took captive.

anchor'd as near as they could, that they might be within the Reach of their Guns, if any Violence should be offer'd to them. The Natives, who came down to speak to them, ask'd if they were <HI>English</HI> or <HI>French:</HI> They told them the latter, but that they were sent by the <HI>French</HI> King with Presents, and to make a Peace with them. The King they had chosen, whom I mention'd before, had been dead about a Month past, and no new One yet elected in his Room; but the old Queen (Mother of the Prince they had carry'd away some Years before) who was still living, order'd the Ambassador to be conducted to her House. His Men carry'd a great many Things of no great Cost a∣mongst them, but such as they knew to be greatly valu'd in this Country; and which, he was assur'd, would please her. These he presented in the Name of the <HI>French</HI> King; and she testify'd her Satisfaction in receiving them, by entertaining the Cap∣tain in the best Manner she could invent. This Day past in Compliments, Presenting, and Ceremony, so far as their little Know∣ledge carry'd them; the next Day she sent for the Captain, and told him, they must both swear according to the Custom of her Country.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="130"/>
<Q>“”THE Captain having agreed to the Ce∣remony, it was perform'd after the follow∣ing Manner: The holy <HI>Owley,</HI> which we have already describ'd, was brought out, and hung on a Piece of Wood laid a-cross two Forks, all which was cut down on purpose; as was also a long Pole, to which the Bullock was ty'd; this was provided by the Queen, and being kill'd, they took some of the Tail, and some of the Hair of the Nose and Eye-brows, and put them on some live Coals smoaking under the <HI>Owley;</HI> they then took some of the Blood, which they sprinkl'd on it, and on the Beam it hung on; the Liver also was roasted, and a Piece of that plac'd on it; two Pieces were put on two Lances, and these two Lances stuck in the Ground betwixt the Queen and the Ambassador; the Queen swore first to this Purpose.</Q></P>
<P>I Swear by the Great God above, by the Four Gods of the Four Quarters of the World, by the Spirits of my Forefathers, and before this holy <HI>Owley,</HI> that neither Myself, nor any of my Off∣spring, or People, who assist at this solemn Oath, for themselves and their Off-spring, will wittingly kill any <HI>French-man,</HI> unless they first kill some of us; and if We, or any of Ʋs, mean any other but the plain and honest Truth by This, may this
<PB N="112" REF="131"/>
Liver, which I now eat, be turn'd into Poison in my Belly, and kill me instantly.</P>
<P><Q>“”WHEN she had said this, she took the Piece of Liver off the Lance, and eat it; when she had done, the Ambassador did the same.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THE Captain staid on Shoar three or four Days after this, sending on Board what Pro∣vision his People wanted. A firm Friend∣ship being now establish'd between them, they strove who should outdo the other in Civilities. The Captain invited the Queen to go on board his Ship, and she very rea∣dily went with several of the Chief of her People; and were treated by the Captain with Magnificence, and very much to her Satisfaction. She return'd on Shore in the Ship's Boat, and after Landing did not im∣mediately walk up from the Sea-side, but stood looking about her. The <HI>French-men,</HI> not regarding the Presence of the black Queen, stripp'd, and swam about to wash and cool themselves; the Queen could not help observing the Whiteness of their Skins, which being so different from theirs, she indulg'd her Curiosity in looking on them; till seeing one Man, whose Skin was much darker than the rest of his Companions, as he came toward the Shoar, and was going
<PB N="113" REF="132"/>
to put on his Cloaths, she espy'd a Mole under his left Pap; she went near to him im∣mediately, and, looking more diligently on it, hinder'd him from putting on his Shirt. She cry'd out, she was positive he was her Son, who had been carry'd away, when a Child, many Years before; and had not Patience to contain herself, but ran to him, crying for Joy that she had found her Son, and threw her Arms about his Neck. This sur∣pris'd all the People, as well Blacks as Whites, till having recover'd herself a little, she turn'd to them, and told them this was her Son; and shew'd them the Mark. They, who had known the young Prince, came near, view'd the Mole, and were of her Opinion, that it must be he, and no other. The <HI>French-men</HI> could not tell what to make of this, nor what might be the Consequence; and began to be in Fear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THE Captain, therefore, taking the Man aside, advis'd him to give as cunning▪An∣swers as he could to what Questions they should ask him for their Safety's sake: Now there were several Blacks who spoke <HI>French,</HI> and by their Means the <HI>French-men</HI> as soon understood the Queen as themselves did. She bid these ask him, <HI>If he knew the Coun∣try he was born in?</HI> He answer'd, <HI>He could remember nothing of it, for he was carry'd from</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="133"/>
<HI>his Native Place when a Child.</HI> She ask'd him, <HI>If he knew her?</HI> He said, <HI>He could not pretend to say he did; but he thought she re∣sembl'd somebody he was us'd to when young:</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THIS confirm'd them, more and more in their Opinion: As to his being white skin'd, that, they thought, might easily be from his wearing Cloaths during the Time he was absent from thence; his Hair was black like theirs, so that it was concluded it must be their Prince. The Queen was in Rap∣tures of Joy for finding her Son, and the Na∣tives were for choosing him King directly; he being the next Heir. They ask'd him, <HI>What Name he went by?</HI> He told them, <HI>He never remember'd himself to be call'd by any other Name than</HI> Samuel; but they gave him what, they thought, was his Origi∣nal Name, compounded with <HI>Tuley;</HI> which signify'd <HI>His Return,</HI> or <HI>Arrival:</HI> So they call'd him <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro, [Deaan,</HI> it may be observ'd, is an universal Title of Honour, signifying <HI>Lord;]</HI> and he was also further saluted immediately with the Title of <HI>Panzacker</HI> (which is <HI>King)</HI> of <HI>Antenosa.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THE Captain, and other <HI>French-men</HI> were surpris'd to find the Man acted his Part so well; not perceiving at first that he was in Earnest, and was as ready to be made a King as they were to choose him; tho' it
<PB N="115" REF="134"/>
was in this heathenish Place. He had here immediately under his Command twelve thousand fighting Men, and a fine, large, plentiful Country to live in at his Plea∣sure. The Ship sail'd away, and left him; but as often as the <HI>French</HI> had Occasion for what this Island afforded, they us'd to put into <HI>Port-Dauphine;</HI></Q> and trade with him.</P>
<P><Q>“ABOUT three or four Years before we were cast away, it happen'd that a <HI>French</HI> Ship being there, some of the Men got drunk on Shoar; and quarrelling with some of the Natives, told them, King <HI>Samuel</HI> was not their lawful King; but that he was yet living in <HI>France.</HI> This might have been of very ill Consequence to him, but he took such Care to prevent it as no One could blame him for: He sent for the Man who spoke the Words, and order'd him to be shot to Death; he also commanded his Companions to depart forthwith, and told them, That if ever they, or any of their Country-men came there again, he would take Care they should never go alive off the Island.”</Q> And this last Adventure be∣ing known to our Man, who advis'd us against putting into <HI>Port-Dauphine,</HI> made him say, <HI>He was barbarous to all white People;</HI> but he had heard the Story imperfectly, and from thence arose the Mistake which prov'd so fatal to us.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="135"/>
BY this Conference between <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> and King <HI>Samuel,</HI> I came to the Knowledge of what happen'd to the white Boys, who were taken with me; so far, at least, as the Natives knew themselves: As also, that the Prince, who was seis'd by our People, and made Prisoner with <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> their King, was not, strictly speaking, his Son, but <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> his Nephew; whose Right <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> had u∣surp'd, as we shall find hereafter: But a Word in their Language signifying <HI>Off-spring,</HI> and comprehending as well <HI>Grandsons</HI> and <HI>Nephews</HI> as <HI>Sons,</HI> was the Cause we did not distinguish the Difference. But,</P>
<P>To return to my own History: The Fray between my Master and me being over, by the Iutercession of <HI>Deaan Sambo,</HI> and the other Chiefs, he order'd me to be carry'd to the Plantations to work there; telling me, <Q>“If I hoed the Carravances and Weeds toge∣ther, as I did at first; he would hoe my St—es out.”</Q> I went away very content∣edly, not caring where I was, so it was where I could not see him; for he now became more hateful to me than ever.</P>
<P>OUR Plantation was about five Miles from Home, and he came not above once in a Month to see us. He took no Care for my Maintenance, nor the rest of his Slaves; we must provide for ourselves. But then every
<PB N="117" REF="136"/>
Man had as much Land as he pleas'd to cul∣tivate for his own Use; and one Day in a Week to work for himself. When I first came, I found it hard enough to keep myself alive; I was oblig'd on Moon-light Nights, after I had done my Master's Work, to go in∣to the Woods, and look for wild Yams for my Sustenance, and many Times I could find no more than was sufficient for one Meal; which, however, I was forc'd to lengthen out for the next Day's Support.</P>
<P>MY Fellow-Slaves were, indeed, as kind to me as they could asford; they having Planta∣tions of their own: They gave me Carra∣vances, and such Victuals at they had; espe∣cially on dark Nights, and Times when I could not shift for myself. I work'd a Night or two in a Week, in clearing and burning the Weeds, and Things off the Piece of Ground I design'd for my own Plantation; but the speediest Thing I could plant to produce myself Food was Potatoes. I liv'd this mi∣serable Life for two or three Months, and it was a Year before I was rightly settl'd, and had Plenty.</P>
<P>HONEY is one of the most profitable and useful Things this Country produces; and they have it in Plenty, if they will take proper Care. There's little Trouble in managing Bees, which are here very numerous; they will readily come
<PB N="118" REF="137"/>
to their Hives, or <HI>Tohokes,</HI> as the Natives call them; and in making these I took a particu∣lar Delight: They are Part of the Body of a Tree, call'd <HI>Fontuoletch,</HI> first cut off about a Yard long, and then split right down; having dug out the Middle with our Hatchets (in which we are not very nice) we bind the two Parts together in their natural Position, so that the Hive is a hollow Cylinder; we leave a Hole at the Bottom for them to enter: And this is all the Care that need be taken.</P>
<P>I had almost two hundred of these Hives; but some of my Neighbours us'd often to rob them: Once I catch'd a Boy, following him by his Track, and carry'd him to his Father; about three or four Days after, I went to demand Satisfaction for the Honey he stole, and destroying my Hives; his Fa∣ther made very few Words with me, but gave me two Hatchets, a Hoe, and ten Strings of yellow Beads; I was very well contented with this, thinking myself as rich as a grent Merchant. But soon after, I happen'd on a secure Way of preserving my Honey; the relating which will give a just Notion of al∣most the only Superstition these People are addicted to.</P>
<P>I have already mention'd the <HI>Ʋmossees,</HI> who pretend to be Magicians, Sorcerers, and For∣tune-tellers. One of these <HI>Ʋmossees</HI> was on
<PB N="119" REF="138"/>
his Travels from <HI>Antenosa</HI> into our Country, and in his Way took up his Lodging at my Master's Town; my Master had been that Day in the Woods to see his Bee-Hives, and found a great many of them robb'd: He re∣turn'd in the Evening in a very great Passion, threatning to shoot whomsoever he should catch stealing his Honey. This <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> com∣ing in this Juncture to pay his Respects to him, and hearing his Complaint, told him, he could give him somewhat that would ef∣fectually prevent his Honey from being stole; but he was afraid to tell it him, because it would kill that Person who eat the stolen Honey: <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> said, he did not care if they were all kill'd. In the End they agreed, the <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> was to have two Cows and two Calves, if it effected the Business, and was to stay to see the Success.</P>
<P>THE next Morning he goes into the Woods, and singles out a Tree call'd <HI>Roe-bouche;</HI> we have no such-like in <HI>England,</HI> nor is it much to the Purpose; for I suppose any Tree would have done his Business as well. He goes to the Eastward of this Tree, and dug up a Piece of its Root, and then he goes to the Westward, and dug up another Piece of the Root of the same Tree; he takes the Eastern Root, and directs <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> to rub it on a Stone with a little Water, and sprinkle
<PB N="120" REF="139"/>
the Water among the Bees and Honey-combs in the Hives; and if any one steals the Ho∣ney and eats it, in a Quarter of a Day (for they reckon not by Hours) they will swell, and break out in Spots like a Leopard from Head to Foot; and in three Days they will dye. This pleas'd <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> but then says he, <Q>“How shall I do, when I want to to use my Honey for myself and Family?”</Q> Says the <HI>Ʋmossee,</HI> <Q>“”I have here a Remedy for that in my Hand, which is no other than a Root of the same Tree, but dug to the West; and when you go to take your Honey, only rub a little of this on ano∣ther Stone (not the same) with Water, and sprinkle the Hives; then will the Eastern Root have no Power: But if any Body has stole your Honey, and finds the Effects of it, and you have a Mind to be merciful, and save his Life, give him some of this Western Root, which he call'd <HI>Vau∣hovalumy,</HI> or Root of Life; it will take off all the Swelling and Spots, and restore him to Health.</Q></P>
<P>ALL this was mighty well, but the Busi∣ness was to try if it would answer all these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pretences of the <HI>Ʋmossee,</HI> which <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> was very eager to know; and there∣fore, having sprinkl'd his Hives with the East∣ern Root according to Directions, he propos'd
<PB N="121" REF="140"/>
it to several to try it, and he would give them an Ox for their Pains; but No-body offering themselves, he order'd it to be cry'd about the Country, and by this Means it came to my Ears. Now I had before observ'd the Sim∣plicity of the People on these Occasions, and that these <HI>Ʋmossees</HI> made a Property of their Ignorance, to cheat and impose on them; I knew there was nothing else in this, and that it had already the Effect desir'd, by terrify∣ing the People; and having a great deal of Honey myself, I thought, if I could, by any Means, pretend I had the Secret it would pre∣serve mine. I, therefore, sent Word to my Master that I would try it; provided he would communicate the Secret to me if I surviv'd the Experiment. He very readily sent for me, and agreed to it, promising me over and a∣bove a great Reward.</P>
<P>I went with my Master and several other People to the Hive, which was sprinkl'd with the Poison, as they call it; and taking the Honey out by Handfuls I eat it before them, asking them if they would partake with me? They said, they would not touch it for a thousand Cattle, making several Grimaces in the mean time, and dreading what would befa▪ me for my Presumption. When I had fill'd my Belly, and cloy'd myself, my Master would have me Home with him to be ready to have it
<PB N="122" REF="141"/>
expell'd, but I chose rather to go to Play with my Comrades; by which Means I had Time to think of some Way to deceive them. As Luck would have it, being in the Fields, I espy'd a Calf sucking a Cow, and No-body in View; so I ty'd up the Calf with my Lam∣ber, and milk'd the Cow into my Mouth as long as the Cow would give Milk; this, and the Honey together had the desir'd Effect; for it began to swell me, and rumble in my Belly that it might be heard. Away I went to my Comrades, who seeing my Belly swell'd, and hearing the rumbling, advis'd me to run Home; and cry'd out I was poison'd. I pre∣tended to step behind a Hedge on some Oc∣sion, but it was only to beat myself with Nettles; the Pimples and Redness rais'd from this did the more affright them; for there appear'd on me all the Signs and Symptoms of Poison, which the <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> had before de∣scrib'd; and to compleat the Deceit, you may be sure, I did not fail heavily to complain, and cry out; hereupon some ran before me, and others help'd me Home.</P>
<P>My Master had prepar'd the Water with the <HI>Vauhovalumy,</HI> or Root of Life; the Peo∣ple, terrify'd at the Danger I was in, flock'd to the House; pitying me, and admiring the great Learning of the <HI>Ʋmossee;</HI> who did not himself perceive the Cheat. Well, I
<PB N="123" REF="142"/>
drank the Medicine, and after lying down three or four Hours all was vanish'd, and I was well; the <HI>Vauhovalumy</HI> was esteem'd a great Medicine, the <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> a very great and wise Man, and did not a little value himself upon it; repenting that he had parted with the Secret so cheap, saying, <HI>He would have twenty Cows for it of the next who wanted it. Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> to gratify him, bid him choose his two Cows and two Calves out of all his Cattle in the Cow-pen; which he did, and departed. My Master, on my Promise of Secrecy, disclos'd both the Roots to me, and the Manner of finding and using them; for the Pain I had suffer'd, and the Hazard, he believ'd, I underwent, he gave me a Cow and a Calf; I then thought I had made a very good Day's Work.</P>
<P>WHEN I return'd to my Plantation, my Neighbours, and Fellow-Slaves having seen the terrible Effects of this Poison, desir'd me to put a Mark on all my Hives; that when they went out a Honey-thieving they might not be kill'd, by happening on any of mine. This was the Thing I aim'd at, and according∣ly I put a white Stick before every Hive, and never after this lost my Honey: No-body would go near my Hives, for Fear my Bees should sting them, and their Stings be of more dangerous Consequence than those of others.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="143"/>
I, having now a Cow and Calf, had Milk of my own, and was as rich as my Fellow-Slaves; besides the Gain I made of my Ho∣ney, by selling forty or fifty Gallons a Year, to other People for <HI>Hatchets, Beads,</HI> &amp;c. who make <HI>Toak</HI> with it; more especially against their <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and other Feasts.</P>
<P>I liv'd thus about three Years, which, with two Years and a half before, made almost an Ap∣prenticeship in this Country: My Master came one Day to see how we went on, and taking more than ordinary Notice of my Manner of working, he at length told me I must go Home with him, and keep his Cattle, which were near the Town. This was much less Work than digging, and cultivating his Plantation; however I was pretty well reconcil'd to it, since my own Plantation was likewise so much im∣prov'd; but he providing for me now, and my Honey being safe, I was not much con∣cern'd at my Removal: So away I went, dri∣ving my own Cattle, which were now en∣creas'd, having a Cow and Calf, besides two Heifers. My Houshold-Furniture too was not so much, but I was able to carry it away my∣self at once; yet I was as rich, and had as much as other People of my Condition, and more than many of them.</P>
<P>I built me an House, and a Cow-pen for my own Cattle in less than two Days: Now
<PB N="125" REF="144"/>
was I in my first Station again, looking after Cattle; the hardest of my Labour was (as I said before) every other Night bringing Home either a Tub, or a Callabash four or five Miles full of Water; but considering I was a Slave, it was as easy living as I could expect.</P>
<P>I had not continu'd long in this last Sta∣tion, before a common Calamity reduc'd us to miserable Circumstances: The epidemical Evil of this Island is, Their <HI>Frequent Quar∣rels with one another;</HI> and the very Cause so many of them are sold to the <HI>Europeans</HI> for Slaves. This is a dangerous and destruc∣tive Misfortune to a People, otherwise good natur'd and well inclin'd, who have whol∣some stated Laws for determining Disputes, and punishing Crimes; of which I shall give an Account in a proper Place: But what I have observ'd is, that the supreme King of any Country has seldom Force enough, to bring the lesser Chiefs in his Dominions to answer, in a judicial Manner, to the Wrongs they do one another, or the Mistakes and Errors committed by Chance; but they fight it out, making Slaves of, impoverishing, and destroying one another, after the Manner I am now going to relate; in which I myself was a grievous Sufferer.</P>
<P>EVERY Thing seem'd happy, and peace∣able: No foreign Enemy for a long Time
<PB N="126" REF="145"/>
disturb'd us. But what I took Notice of, when first a Slave, was my Master's, and others stealing their Neighbours Cattle, and their Neighbours doing also the same by them; for they were equally addicted to this Kind of Thievery: So that it could not easily be known, who was the Ag∣gressor in the present Quarrel. But one Day, when I, and some others went about five or six Miles to water our Cattle, hav∣ing two Men arm'd with Guns to guard us as usual, it happen'd in our going Home, that, tho' the greater Number of them went on slowly, grazing as they pass'd a∣long, some of the Milch-Cows ran home∣ward before the rest; wanting to be suck'd by their Calves. The Men, knowing me to be light of Foot, desir'd me to run after and stop them, that they might be kept in a Body; but they being got a great Way off, it was some Time before I could stop them. When I turn'd about, I was sur∣pris'd to see one of our Men shooting in∣to a Body of Men, who drove the Cattle a contrary Way; and running from them toward me, they soon espy'd me, and the Cattle with me, and ran after us. Here∣upon I left the Cattle, and fled, as fast as I could, Home to my Master, and got there the first of any Body; puffing, and blow∣ing,
<PB N="127" REF="146"/>
being frighten'd and out of Breath, in imperfect Exclamations I told him, an Army had taken our Cattle; and one of our Men, named <HI>Roy'nsowra,</HI> had fir'd, and kill'd a Man; but I could not tell him who the Ene∣my were, nor on what Account they did it. While my Master and the rest were talking with me, in came two or three more; who said it was <HI>Deaan Chahary</HI> and his Brother <HI>Deaan Frukey,</HI> two of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Sons. It seems, our Master had been discover'd stealing three of <HI>Deaan Frukey</HI>'s Cattle; and this they did out of Revenge. All was in Confusion and Hurry at once; every Man taking his Arms, <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> bid them follow him, which they were as ready to do as himself to lead; for it was a gene∣ral Loss. All the Milch Cows, and Home∣kept Cattle were gone, and now away go all the Men in Persuit of them; except some old and incapable Persons. Amongst others I was broke too, having lost my Cow and Heifers; my Calf, indeed, was left at Home, bellowing for its Dam, as did every Body's else; between whom, and the crying of the Women and Children, there was a most confused, and frightful Uproar.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Frukey,</HI> who then was (or pre∣tended to be) the injur'd Person, liv'd with∣in
<PB N="128" REF="147"/>
two, or three Miles of our Watering-place; but they drove our Cattle a great Way more to the Northward to <HI>Deaan Cha∣hary</HI>'s Town, which was better - fortify'd, and more capable of being defended from the Assault, which, they justly expected, we should make against it. Our People, notwithstanding the Passion they were in, and the Speed they made, yet follow'd them with great Circumspection; having Spies running softly before, by whom they found their Enemies were enter'd the Town with their Booty. Our People, not being provi∣ded with Strength enough, and having no Time to call in the Help of their Neighbours, did not attempt to assault <HI>Deaan Chahary</HI>'s Town; but silently and undiscover'd turn'd off, and went about five Miles further; where they kept all their breeding Cattle. These they took, it being now late in the Night; the few Keepers they had were at a Distance and fast asleep, knowing nothing of the Matter; so they drove away the Beasts without any Noise, and came home∣wards as fast as possible. We look'd out all the Morning, expecting them every Mi∣nute to return; at length we espy'd them with a vast large Drove of Cattle, con∣taining as many, or more than our own; being above five hundred. We all thought
<PB N="129" REF="148"/>
they had recover'd their own; and I more especially was thinking, how I should kiss my Cow for Joy of seeing her again; but we soon perceiv'd they were Strangers, and I, not be∣ing with them, had no Share in the Booty.</P>
<P>MY Master, and several others, after they had divided them, kill'd some Oxen; we made a jovial Feast, and some of our People sent me Presents of Meat. The next Day my Ma∣ster sent me away to look after the Cattle as before; and himself went to repair some Breaches in his Town-Walls, by putting in Poles cut down on Purpose, and made Prepa∣rations for a War. But he had not Patience to stay at Home, and see if his Enemies would come to give him any new Distur∣bance; tho' the Reprizals he had made on them might have well contented him, being more than he lost; nothing would serve him, but in two or three Days Time he would go, and surprize his Enemies Town by Night, and left his own unguarded, and had just such Suc∣cess as so precipitate a Conduct deserv'd: For the very Morning after they went on their Expedition, as I, and others were watering the Cattle, and carefully regarding them, lest they should run towards their own Home, which was nearer than our Town to the Wa∣tering-place; about twenty Men rush'd out of a Thicket of Bushes, and leap'd upon us
<PB N="130" REF="149"/>
like so many Tigers at their Prey. I, and three or four Boys had Time to start out of their Clutches, and run for it; but they soon came up with the rest, carrying them back, and all the Cattle and other Slaves who were with them; while some follow'd me, hollowing, yelping, and threatning they would kill me, if I did not stop, and yield myself their Captive; but turning about, and perceiving I gain'd Ground of them, I ran on for a Mile and half at least, before I came to any Place to shelter myself; at length, I got to a Wood, which I knew, where I soon lost them; and they re∣turn'd back to their Companions, who march'd off with their Prisoners and Cattle. I, perceiv∣ing them gone, hasted home; when I enter'd the Town, the Women immediately flock'd about me; for they saw by my Countenance, and the Confusion I was in, that some Evil had hap∣pen'd: I soon made them sensible of the Loss, and they as soon reflected on their Husbands ill Conduct; who, to follow the Dictates of a blind Passion, and revenge themselves on their Ene∣mies, would leave all that was valuable to them∣selves unguarded, to become a Prey to those very Enemies; who, they might be sure, had Spies out to give Notice of every Opportu∣nity, which might be of Advantage to them.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> return'd about Evening, when, for his Welcome-home, the News of
<PB N="131" REF="150"/>
this, which happen'd at Sun-rising, was told him. I also understood, the Expedition they went on had been fruitless; for tho' they arriv'd at their Enemies Town an Hour be∣fore Day-light, yet so vigilant were they, in sending out Spies every Way Night and Day▪ that they discover'd our People, and alarm'd the Towns-folks; who came out and met them: And all that was done, as I could hear, was only scolding at one another, like Wo∣men, with a <HI>You began first,</HI> and <HI>You gave the first Occasion,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> began to fire a little at them at a Distance, and they return'd it; but without Execution on either Side. A Kinsman coming soon after Day-light to <HI>Deaan Frukey</HI>'s Assistance, <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow</HI> thought best to retire; but not with∣out telling them, <Q>“If his Kinsman, and his People had not come, he would have had all his Cattle again in a few Hours.”</Q> To which they answer'd, <Q>“That they would not only keep his Cattle, but that their own, which he had lately carry'd away by Sur∣prize, were by this Time in their own Pos∣session again, as he would find at his Re∣turn Home;”</Q> and so in Truth he found it. At which he was heartily vex'd, but we had kill'd a pretty many of them first, and stock'd ourselves with Provision. He vow'd Revenge on his Uncles, and accordingly provides for
<PB N="132" REF="151"/>
another Enterprize; which they set out up∣on in three Days after. He ask'd me, if I was willing to go with them, I very readily embrac'd the Offer; for there was Safety no where now, and it was as little Danger with them as at Home: So he furnish'd me with a Gun, Cartouch-box, and Powder-horn, &amp;c. and I commenc'd Souldier.</P>
<P>WE sally'd out of our Town just as it was dark, for we had a great Way to go: <HI>Deaan Frukey,</HI> with all his People, having deserted their own Town as not defensible, and mov'd to his Brother's, which was many Miles fur∣ther to the Northward. We march'd very swiftly, but silently; never speaking to one another, but in Whispers. My Skin appear∣ing white, they thought it might be seen at a Distance in the dark, and thereby discover us to our Enemies Spies; they, therefore, made me daub myself all over with Mud.</P>
<P>WE arriv'd two Hours before Day near the Town, and sent two Men, who knew it well, to go round it, and search for Breaches, or weak Places in the Fortifications: They return'd, having discover'd two Breaches; as also the private Way, which is always pro∣vided for the Women and Children to escape to the Woods by, in Case of a Surprize. Near this Place we laid an Ambuscade of thirty Men, who were not to fire, or make any Noise,
<PB N="133" REF="152"/>
only to seize the Women in their Flight. Our Army was divided in three Parts: <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow</HI> with his, attack'd the most difficult Breach of the two in the Walls, a Chief Man of his the other, and <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> the Gate, in whose Party I was; for my Master would not take me with him, thinking I could not well bear to tread on the Thorns in the For∣tification.</P>
<P>THERE were three Gates, one within ano∣ther: The Signal for us to attack was the fi∣ring the first Gun; which was when <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow,</HI> and the other Chief had secur'd the out-side of the Breaches: It was a Quarter of an Hour we waited in Expectation before the Gun was fir'd; the Towns-men were immediately in Arms, and almost as ready as we; for they secur'd the inner Gate, at the Time when we enter'd the outer, and came furiously on to∣wards us; but we drove them back. How∣ever they maintain'd the other a long Time, till <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> had, with much Difficul∣ty, enter'd thorow the Breach; he had one of his principal Men shot in the Belly just be∣fore him; which so enrag'd him that he leap'd down, and the rest follow'd. About the same Time we push'd vigorously those we engag'd with, enter'd the Town, and immediately heard the Outcry of the Women, who were surpris'd by our Ambuscade, and almost all taken. The
<PB N="134" REF="153"/>
Men got off, by a Breach of their own making, into the Woods, and left us the Town to plunder and burn; which we did not fail to do. I got some Cotton, wooden Platters and Spoons. We found here a great many of our Cattle, and looking about, I espy'd my Cow, and now thought myself sure of her; but see the ill Effects of too great Security, we had now a great Booty of Slaves and Cattle; the latter we drove out of the Town before us, neglecting to secure them with a Guard before them, thinking we had entirely defeated, and dis∣pers'd all our Enemies; when in Truth, they were encreas'd, and kept in a Body in the Woods, observing our Motions, and watching an Opportunity for their Advantage. They soon perceiv'd the Cattle defenceless, and had nothing to do, but to turn them out of the Way we put them into, and drive them a little into the Woods; where we lost them all again, as soon as we had got them: For marching to regain them, our Enemy appear'd in a formidable Body, firing at us, and even offering us Battle. Here they kill'd us one Man: We had miss'd several of our People before, while we were in the Town; and searching about, found three of them wounded, and four of our principal, and stoutest Men kill'd. This very much afflicted <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow,</HI> and all the rest, and abated their Cou∣rage;
<PB N="135" REF="154" MS="y"/>
so that they thought of nothing, but retiring with the Slaves they had taken, and getting out of the Reach of their Enemy as fast as they could. Accordingly they left the plain open Road we came by, and went thorow the Woods, a most wretched Way for ten Miles or more, full of Thorns and Briars, and per∣petually in Fear of Ambuscades. However, we stopp'd to make a Bier, to carry our wounded Men upon, and then march'd on, but with great Circumspection, thinking every Bird which stir'd, an Enemy in Ambuscade. After we were thorow this long Wood, we still went by unpractis'd Ways; so that it was just dark as we got Home. It is customary, let the Success be good or bad, for the Chief to set down with his People before his own House; the Women soon flock'd about him to know the News; and notwithstanding the Prize of Slaves we brought with us, here was but a melancholy Scene; for the Wives, Re∣lations, and Friends of the Men who were kill'd, made great Lamentation. However, some Calves were kill'd, and we refresh'd our∣selves after our Fatigue, as well as we could, every Man at his own Home, and being wea∣ry, laid down to sleep; but before Day-light we were waken'd by the Firing of a Gun. Our Enemies, by our Conduct the Day be∣fore, found we were dispirited, and resolv'd
<PB N="136" REF="155"/>
to give us no Time to recruit; so they fol∣low'd us, and attack'd our Town, as we had done theirs; but I think, they did not be∣have with so much Judgment and good Conduct as we did at their Town: For the first Thing we did on the Alarm, was to order a Party to secure the Wives, Children, and valuable Slaves; in which we succeeded happily, and convey'd them safe out of the Town to their Hiding-place. We defended ourselves as long as we could, but not with so much Resolu∣tion as we should have done at another Time; yet we retir'd with little Loss, and left them the Town to plunder, as we had done theirs. There was very little of Value for them, the Women carrying off what their Haste would admit of; and as for Cattle, there was none but a few Calves, whose Dams they had feiz'd at first; and they were in so much Haste, that they could not drive them away; so they kill'd them, and carry'd as much of their Carcases away for Food, as they could con∣veniently. They never attempted to go in Search for the Women, but they call'd; and told us, <Q>“We should have no Rest, till they had their Wives and Children again.”</Q> We told them, <Q>“We would have our Cattle a∣gain, and keep their Wives too.”</Q> They seem'd pleas'd with this Revenge on us, and it was no small Satisfaction to our People,
<PB N="137" REF="156"/>
tho' they were defeated this Time, to find, that notwithstanding the Disadvantage they took us at, we were, at least, their Match.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> our King, had by this Time the News carry'd him; who immedi∣ately undertook to reconcile us, and accord∣ingly sent Messengers to both Parties, to know the Cause of the Quarrel, and the Demands on each Side. <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> sent Word he was ready to oblige the King, and would live in Peace with his Uncles, if they would send him all his Cattle again; and <HI>Deaan Fru∣key,</HI> and <HI>Chahary</HI> wanted their Wives again, and said, They would return what Cattle was left alive of ours; but they had kill'd a third Part, and refus'd to make up the Number; so that the King could not persuade <HI>Deaan Frukey,</HI> to make up the Number of our Cattle; nor us to send them their Wives without them. Our Master sent the King Word, that <Q>“”All the Force he had, join'd with his Sons, should not oblige him to restore their Wives and Children on other Terms.</Q></P>
<P>THESE haughty Answers <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> re∣sented, and was resolv'd, by Force, to reduce them to a Compliance; and in Order there∣to, musters an Army of a thousand Men, and design'd to come to <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> first. Now <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> could not, on these Occasions, raise a great Army, because there was a Dispute
<PB N="138" REF="157"/>
always subsisting between him and his Ne∣phew <HI>Murnanzack,</HI> whose Father was <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s elder Brother; who dying when his Son was young, and his Country invaded by an Enemy, this Uncle took on him the Charge of the Government; and when possess'd of it, would never lay it down. <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> was not only a gallant Man in War, but also of as fine Accomplishments as this illiterate Country could produce, as we shall see here∣after. He was just, honourable, and exceed∣ing generous and affable; he had three Bro∣thers, who were Lords, Judges, and Chiefs of Towns, who together could make up an Army not much inferior to their Uncle's; besides he was very much esteem'd, and belov'd all over the Country. Now in Case of a foreign War, they all readily join'd to oppose the common Enemy of their Country, as we have seen them do against the Kings of <HI>Merfaughla</HI> and <HI>Antenosa;</HI> but amongst themselves they always regarded each other with jealous and watch∣ful Eyes; therefore <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> could bring no greater an Army against us, than was con∣sistent with the Safety of his own, and his Sons Towns.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> had Notice of this Design against him, by a Friend of his in <HI>Fenno-arevo,</HI> who ran from thence to our Town by Night and was back again before Day-light undis∣cover'd.
<PB N="139" REF="158"/>
My Master had a Cousin, with whom he had an intimate Friendship, and whose Fa∣ther was as potent a Lord as any in <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Dominions; to this Uncle, whose Name was <HI>Mephontey,</HI> did he fly, with his People, for Protection. We soon pack'd up our (little) ALL, which we sav'd from our Ene∣mies. My whole Stock of Provision and Hous∣hold-Furniture worth carrying away, was a∣bout a Gallon of Carravances, a Mat to lye on, a Hatchet, and little Spade to dig wild Yams. We wanted no Hoes now, that Work was at a Stop in this Country. All our Plan∣tations, and most of the Produce, laid up in little Store-houses, we now left to our Ene∣mies; or whomsoever had a Mind to do as they pleas'd with them. In half a Day we arriv'd at <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI>'s Town, who treated my Master with great Civility, and assur'd him of his Protection; and that he would de∣fend him, and his People to the last Extre∣mity. The Chiefs had Houses given them, and we common People built for ourselves in any Part of the Town, where we could find Room; I made a very small and slight One serve my Turn, for I did not know how soon it might be burnt.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was with us in three Days Time, and encamp'd before the Town: He sent to <HI>Deaan Mephontey,</HI> desiring him, <Q>“”To
<PB N="140" REF="159"/>
deliver up <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> and all his Peo∣ple;</Q> and bid him detain them at his Peril. To which <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI> sent a resolute An∣swer, <Q>“”That he would protect any Strangers, who were good People, and fled to him for Relief when they were in Distress, much more would he do for Friends and Rela∣lations; and if <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> would have them, he must get them by Force; for he would defend them to the utmost of his Power.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> made Preparation to attack the Town the next Morning, and we to defend it: And in Order thereunto, the Women and Chil∣dren were sent away in the dark to the Woods; not all into one Place, but at Distances in small Companies. I was order'd with a Guard to see my Mistress safe, and some other Women and Slaves with her, which I did; and after mark∣ing the Place to find it again, I return'd to the Town, where we liv'd well that Night, dressing and eating Beef, &amp;c. for we had some Cattle of our own, such as I was sent to keep at first, breeding Cows, Heifers, and Oxen; which were a great Way off, when <HI>Deaan Frukey</HI> seiz'd tbe Milch Cows; but we wanted Wa∣ter, which was a great Misfortune to us; our Enemies being so near, we could fetch none all the Day before.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="160"/>
THE next Morning we were all up by Break of Day, and every Man at his Station, as it was appointed the Day before; mine was be∣hind my Master, who had two Guns; one of which I was to keep and load, while he fir'd with the other. It was broad Day before our Enemies began the Attack, they fir'd so brisk∣ly upon us, that for almost a Quarter of an Hour we could not see them for Smoak; but when their Fire abated a little, we return'd it as hotly upon them. On the second Onset they came nearer to us, and the Lances began now to fly at one another; one of which went thorow my Lamber, and scratch'd me; I was a little scar'd at first, but soon recovering my Spirits, I return'd them the Lance over the Fortification, in the same Manner it came to me. The Cattle were very troublesome to us; several being wounded, ran up and down and disorder'd the rest, like so many wild Bulls. We fought thus for four Hours, with great Fury on both Sides; till <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> finding he could not enter the Town, call'd off his Forces, and retreated to his Camp. <HI>Deaan Mephontey,</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> were for sallying out, but <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI>'s Son <HI>Batoengha,</HI> with some Difficulty, persuaded them against it, suspecting an Ambuscade. We had several People kill'd on both Sides, and some wounded, whom we convey'd out of the
<PB N="142" REF="161"/>
Town, after the Fight, to their Wives. We bury'd the dead under the Fortification, and sent out Spies to observe the Enemy, who brought us Intelligence they were very quiet, regarding nothing but killing Cattle, and fetch∣ing Wood to dress their Meat. When this In∣telligence was repeated, and we were suffici∣ently assur'd, they would give us no more Trouble that Day, our People kill'd, and dress'd Beef also; but we were parch'd up with Thirst: You might here have seen Men, with their Tongues hanging out of their Mouths thro' excessive Heat. This Want of Water is the most intolerable of all Calamities, a painful Misery not to be express'd in Words. It may be remember'd, that when I first came into this Country, I had felt the Anguish for al∣most four Days, and know by dear Expe∣rience, that Hunger is not to be compar'd to Thirst; but I had Relief sooner than my Neighbours, for my Master sent me, and two Slaves out of the Town, with Provisions for our Mistress, and those with her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; where, by the Way, we found a little Water.</P>
<P>I had some Difficulty to find the Place, where I left her the Night before; however, at length we came to them, whom we found in great Concern for our Welfare: My Mistress was sitting on her Legs crying, for hearing the Guns firing, and, at length, ceasing all at
<PB N="143" REF="162"/>
once, she thought the Town was taken, and her Husband kill'd; but the Sight of us dis∣sipated all her Fears. I cut down some Boughs of Trees with large Leaves, which serv'd very well for Dishes and Plates, and cutting the roast Meat, I brought on my Back, into Pieces, I serv'd it up to my Mistress. I don't que∣stion, but some will remark, that she had not so much Delicacy, as we see in fine Ladies of her high Rank and Distinction in <HI>Europe,</HI> yet I dare say, she enjoy'd as good a Repast, and as much to her Satisfaction, as any of them would have done in her Circumstances. When I had serv'd her, I divided the rest among my Fellow-Servants, her Women, who accompa∣ny'd her; and my Orders being to stay with her, I sent the two Men away; they had brought a good deal of raw Meat, and in the Night I could make a Fire to dress it, which could not be seen at any great Distance tho∣row so thick a Wood, when in the Day-time the Smoak might have discover'd us. I went at a Distance, and dug wild Yams, which were very acceptable for their Moisture, this Place being destitute of Water; but as much as they wanted them, they would not venture to dig for themselves till licame, lest the Noise might betray them to the Enemy.</P>
<P>AT Night we sat very socially round the Fire, while I entertain'd them with the Story
<PB N="144" REF="163"/>
of the Fight, and my own Danger. I also roasted my Meat, and hung it up in Trees, out of the Reach of wild Dogs and Foxes. When it was Time to go to Sleep, I told them I had no Bed, having forgot my Mat in the Hurry. They laugh'd at me for this, and my Mistress said, <HI>Sure you don't doubt, but we will make Room for one Man amongst us;</HI> and bid me <HI>choose my Place.</HI> Now I might be free enough with the young Women-Slaves, tho' not with herself; so we lay down very close together all Night, but very innocently.</P>
<P>I had formerly wonder'd, why my Master made no Scruple of trusting me with his Wife, contrary to his Care of her in respect to other Men, and to the Custom of the Country; but when I began to consider, how hazardous it was for any Woman, who was liable to be call'd to an Account for her Actions, to have an Affair with a white Man, the Wonder ceas'd; for if a Woman should prove with Child, the Colour of the Off-spring would de∣clare the Father. But I must not let this pass with any Thing which may be taken as a Hint to this Lady's Prejudice; for I sincerely declare, I never once discover'd in her any criminal Inclinations; notwithstanding what may be said here, or elsewhere, of some such Liberties, which would not look well in <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI> Women.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="164"/>
WE arose by Day-break, and listen'd very diligently for the Noise of Guns, but heard none; and in a little While the two Men came again to us, and brought us more Meat. They told us, that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> had sent a threat∣ning Message to <HI>Deaan Mephontey,</HI> to tell him, <Q>“That if he did not oblige <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> to come out to him, and submit to his De∣cision of the Quarrel between him and <HI>Deaan Frukey,</HI> that he would humble their haughty Spirits by Force; for he would there re∣main with his Army till he starv'd them, and also guard the Watering-place, that they should not come at it.”</Q> <HI>Deaan Me∣phontey</HI> return'd as resolute an Answer, <Q>“”That he did not fear starving, having Provisions enough of all Sorts; a great Number of Cattle, and Houses enough for them to live on for three Months; besides which, he had Strength sufficient to force his Way out of the Town whenever he had a Mind; and, therefore, advis'd <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> not to put it to the Hazard of a Trial; but to depart contented with the Repulse he had already met with.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER the Men had told all they had to say, they return'd home, and we all went to digging of Yams; even my Mistress too would make one amongst us: So I sharpen'd Sticks for them, and they pull'd off their Lambers,
<PB N="146" REF="165"/>
because they would not dirty them; some of which a Rag - Woman in <HI>England</HI> would scarce have taken up. My Mistress's, indeed, was a fine silk One of divers Colours, and very large, hanging almost down to her Feet, and a Fringe at the Bottom. They took more Li∣berties with me than they would with others' laughing and saying, they did not regard me as a Man; seeing I discover'd no manly Inclina∣tions. My Reader, perhaps, will scarce credit it, but this was my Behaviour and my Reso∣lution at that Time, and long after; and I told them, <HI>That I would not till I return'd to</HI> England. They said, <HI>They were sure that would never be.</HI> I liv'd very idly, and merrily, the few Days I remain'd here; there were about a Dozen of them, besides my Mistress: And, indeed, I did not care how long the War lasted; for it was easy living, my Provision being given me all the Time, and no Work to do. As to the Ha∣zard of the War, I did not trouble myself about it; I had nothing to lose but my Life, and that I did not much regard in the Circum∣stances I was in, and the Despair of ever get∣ting Home; but we had not yet seen all the Miseries of a Civil War.</P>
<P>EVERY Morning we us'd to listen very at∣tentively for the Noise of Guns; when at length came one os the Slaves alone without Meat; and having seated himself (as is always the
<PB N="147" REF="166"/>
Custom of every Body, Slaves more especially▪ before they speak;) he then told us, <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was gone, and my Master had sent for us Home. This was joyful News, we sat down to Breakfast together, sung, and were as merry as so many Beggars. My Mistress hasten'd to be gone, for she was uneasy till she came to her Husband, whom she no sooner saw, than she fell on her Knees, and lick'd his Feet; and he saluted her after the Manner of the Country; which is, by touching their Noses together.</P>
<P>Now the Reason of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s sudden Departure was, on his hearing that <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack</HI> had seiz'd six hundred of his Cattle; he might have taken them all, but he did this only to begin the Dispute. We stay'd, never∣theless, a Week longer at <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI>'s Town, till we were well inform'd how the Matter stood between them; and that we were sure, we had no more to fear on that Side. <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> we were told, had sent to <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> to know on what Account he seiz'd those Cattle; and whether he meant to take <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s Part? and receiv'd for An∣swer, <Q>“”That he did it to begin his Claim on him for his Right of Dominion; and which he suppos'd, and expected he would as un∣justly dispute with him, as he had unjustly usurp'd it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="167"/>
THIS was a mortifying Stroke, and hap∣pen'd at an unlucky Juncture: <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack</HI> was always a formidable Competitor, and was look'd on as such, whenever he should think proper to assert his Right; and he chose this Opportunity (no Doubt) on Purpose, when <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> had weaken'd himself, by affronting <HI>Deaan Mevarrow, Deaan Sambo,</HI> and their Friend <HI>Deaan Mephontey. Crindo</HI> was soon sensible of his Error, and endeavour'd to soften Matters, by sending Messengers to them all, to tell them, <Q>“”That what he had done was only to correct his Grandsons; and what was necessary to restore the Peace of the Country, which they, and his Son <HI>Fru∣key</HI> had violated; and tho' he began with the former, yet <HI>Frukey</HI> had far'd no better, if he had prov'd refractory; he, therefore, hop'd they would consider his good Inten∣tion,</Q> and not break Friendship with him.</P>
<P>THREE or Four Days after this, we de∣parted from <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI>'s, not without returning many Thanks for these great De∣monstrations of Friendship, and Hospitality. We went Home, (homeward I should say) for the Way we found, and the Place of our late Aboad; but not a House left to put our Heads in. Our Plantations too were destroy'd, and the very Barns and Store-houses burnt; so that we had nothing to live on, but what
<PB N="149" REF="168"/>
the Woods afforded, and a few Cattle among the richest and chiefest Men; who were, in Truth, very good, and communicated to their poor Neighbours.</P>
<P>THE Town being so utterly destroy'd, as not to be repair'd, <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> resolv'd to build a new One; and going about to look for a proper Place, at length, a Wood was found so thick, that a Dog could not creep into it. This, therefore, was more than half fortify'd; so all Hands went to Work to make a Vacancy in it; the Men cut down the Trees, Bushes and Briars, and the Women and Children dragg'd them away; so that in three Days, we clear'd a pretty large Space to build our Houses in: But it was Summer∣time, and we were not in so much Haste for Houses, as for Defences against an Enemy. We, therefore, set about fortifying it with Bodies of Trees, which we cut about sixteen or eighteen Foot long; these we stuck into the Ground so close together, that no Creature could get between them. We thought our∣selves not secure enough with one Row only of these Poles or Trees; but we made three or four one within another, round the whole Space of the Town; leaving no Vacancy, only a small and private Passage for conveying the Women, Children, and Slaves thorow, in Case of an Enemy's Approach; and this was so
<PB N="150" REF="169"/>
contriv'd, as not easily to be seen, or known by Strangers. We made only one Gate∣way, or Entrance, which was narrow too, and defended with four prodigious thick and strong Doors, one within another.</P>
<P>THE Walls being finish'd, we had nothing now to do, but every Man to build a House for himself and Family. We, who were Slaves to <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> went all Hands to work to build his first; some cut Wood, others fetch'd Grass to fill up the Sides with; while I, and about thirty more, went a long Way, I dare say, ten or twelve Miles for <HI>Annevoes,</HI> which are the Leaves of a Tree like a <HI>Coco∣nut</HI> Tree; these we split, and cover the House with at the Top; it makes a Thatch hand∣somer, and stronger than any in <HI>England:</HI> But these Trees were so scarce and far from hence, that single Men could not go often enough, in any reasonable Time, to fetch the Leaves; and as great a Number as we were, we went twice for as much only as would cover one House.</P>
<P>WHEN we had finish'd our Master's, we went about our own Hutches; and as at <HI>Deaan Me∣phontey's,</HI> so here also, a small one serv'd my Turn; for notwithstanding our strong Walls and Fortification, I did not know whether we should be able to keep them long; as it prov'd soon after: So I made my Hut no bigger, than to have Room convenient to lye at my
<PB N="151" REF="170"/>
Length, and make a Fire in; if, by Fortune, I should get any Victuals to dress.</P>
<P>ABOUT a Week after we were settl'd in our New Town, a Messenger, (or rather, an Am∣bassador) arriv'd from <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> with twenty People in his Retinue. His Business was to sound <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s Inclinations, and (if there was any Room) to desire his Friendship: He soon found there was Reason to hope for Success, and, therefore, deliver'd his Message the first Night he came. To which <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> answer'd, He would consider of it, consult his People, and give him his Answer the next Morning. In the mean Time, he gave him a Slave's House to repose himself in, as is the Custom on such Occasions; and sent a Bullock for him, and his Attendants. He next sent out Messengers to all the Chiefs and Freemen, to come and consult with him on a Matter of great Im∣portance. I was present, and saw this Assem∣bly, <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> being seated, the Principals plac'd them∣selves on either Hand; and the other Freemen on each Side of them.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> open'd the Consultation by telling them, <Q>“”That <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> had sent a very honourable Messenger to him to desire his Friendship and Assistance. We must not forget, <HI>says he,</HI> that <HI>Deaan</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="171"/>
<HI>Murnanzack</HI> was a serviceable Friend to us in the Quarrel we had formerly with <HI>Deaan Termerre;</HI> therefore, we are indebted to him on that Score. <HI>Chahary,</HI> and <HI>Frukey</HI> will always be irreconcileable Enemies, so long as we have their Wives and Fami∣lies; and you agree with me not to deli∣ver them, unless they will return all the Cattle they took from us; which they obstinately refuse: Then <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> is their Father, and will be partial, notwith∣standing his Pretences to Peace, and do∣ing Justice; but how he has lately us'd us, is too fresh in Memory to need Repe∣tition. The Justice of <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Claim to the Dominïon, is, I suppose, in∣disputable; whether <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> may not justify himself on the Posture of Affairs in assuming the Authority, is what we will not enter into the Consideration of; but it is of Consequence to us to consider, whe∣ther <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> has Force enough to go through the Dispute, and protect us and other Friends who may join him. This requires the deepest Examination, the Chance of War is doubtful, and you have Families, Slaves, and Cattle to lose as well as I; debate it sedately, and let me have your Resolution,</Q> which shall be mine.</P>

THEY argu'd with one another a good While, debating the Case which was most to their In∣terest, and consider'd the dangerous Circum∣stances they were in; and that it was most likely they should be safest in joining with <HI>Deaan Murnanzack:</HI> They then agreed, that One of them should declare the Result of their Consultation to the <HI>Deaan.</HI> He, therefore, spoke in the Name of the rest, and said, <Q>“”They desir'd him, if he agreed to their Opinion, that he would conclude a solemn Friendship with <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> and they would faithfully observe, and support him to the utmost of their Power.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN I saw the Manner and Form of this Assembly, our Parliament in <HI>Great Britain</HI> run strangely in my Head, I thought this very like it; and tho' I was but a Boy when I went from Home, yet my Father keeping a publick House, I remember often to have heard Gentle∣men disputing with one another about the Power of the Prince, to command the People to do what he pleas'd without consulting them; while others said, a King had no Power without a Parliament. Then they would dispute about the Original of Parliaments, and the Power they had; and who brought the Use of them first into <HI>England;</HI> in this too they seldom agreed. Some said the <HI>Saxons,</HI> others it was since their Time; while many were of Opi∣nions
<PB N="154" REF="173"/>
different from either of these. Now I think this might be decided without refer∣ring to Authors and Histories, That the Ori∣ginal of Parliaments was long before the <HI>Sax∣ons</HI> or <HI>Romans</HI> either: for I imagine, that <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and other Countries too, were once like <HI>Madagascar,</HI> without the Knowledge of Let∣ters, and Coin'd Money; it was then impos∣sible for Princes and Lords to command Peo∣ple, or dispose of them contrary to their In∣clinations, or Interest: For I suppose those Princes to be like my Master, who had not, nor could have any separate Army, or Inte∣rest; but when any Neighbour crav'd their Help, or Enemy had offended them, they as∣sembl'd before the House of their Chief, and there they consulted what Measures were pro∣per to be taken for their Safety and Interest: If War was agreed on, the same Men took their Arms, and the Lord headed them, as my Master did here; and when they return'd, every Man went Home to his Family. Thus the People are themselves their own Army and Defence, and the Lord could not oblige them to do those Things, which the greater Part did not think convenient to do; because he had no Army to force them. This was, with∣out Doubt, the Condition of all other Coun∣tries once, and must have remain'd so, if Peo∣ple had not betray'd themselves unwarily in∣to
<PB N="155" REF="174"/>
the Power of one Man, by giving him Wealth and Authority to raise an Army, keep it in Pay himself, and use it at Discretion for their Defence; with which he wickedly in∣sulted, and abus'd them. But in the State of Nature, and the Beginning of Mens joining in Societies, this was the Form of Government; and with due Reverence to the Learned, I think, we need not turn over many Volumes to find the Original of <HI>British Parliaments;</HI> for they are earlier than all their Histories, or even Letters themselves; and as to their Power, it is founded on the strongest <HI>Basis,</HI> REASON and NATURE.</P>
<P>THE Alliance being resolv'd on, the next Morning <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> sent for the Mes∣senger, and told him, he had consulted his People, and they unanimously agreed to assist <HI>Deaan Murnanzack;</HI> and desir'd that their Friendship might be bound with the usual Solemnity: So an Ox was brought and kill'd, the Liver roasted, and put on Lances, and <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Ambassador, and a chief Man deputed by <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> eat the Liver between them, repeating the Impreca∣tion; that they wish'd it might prove Poison, and a further Curse might be sent by God upon them, who first broke the Alliance.</P>
<P>THIS solemn Ratification being finish'd, the Ox was divided between the Ambassador's
<PB N="156" REF="175"/>
People, and ours who were present, and eat it together; after which, he, and his Atten∣dants departed. And now <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> repented the Building of this Town, for he would have gone, and liv'd near <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack,</HI> whose Country bounded on <HI>Mer∣faughla</HI> on one Side, and was within ten or twelve Miles on the other Side of <HI>Fenno-are∣vo:</HI> He had three Brethren, <HI>Deaan Mussecorrow</HI> liv'd near him; <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> on the Moun∣tains of <HI>Yong-gorvo,</HI> of whom we shall have Occasion to give a large Account; and <HI>Rer Mimebolambo,</HI> the youngest, who liv'd but five Miles from us to the Eastward; and this last being so very near us, we were ready at Hand to join in any Enterprise, or to suc∣cour one another; yet we did not think our∣selves safe, and, therefore, we took Care not to let <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> know our Intentions, till we had been out on one Expedition, and then we better secur'd ourselves.</P>
<P>BUT the Course of my History leads me to relate <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Attacking <HI>Deaan Mundumber</HI>'s Town; where he took three hun∣dred Cattle, and a great many Prisoners, Wo∣men, and Children, for it is never the Cus∣tom to take Men; if they can't get away from their Enemies, they are kill'd. Among the Captives were <HI>Deaan Mundumber</HI>'s Wife, and his only Child, a Daughter. After they
<PB N="157" REF="176"/>
had plunder'd the Town, they were going to burn it, when <HI>Deaan Murnanzaok</HI> hinder'd them, and march'd into the Plain, waiting to see if <HI>Deaan Mundumber</HI> would rally, and give him Battle. They appeard, indeed, but at a great Distance, not daring to come near him; which, when he saw, he march'd home∣wards, yet not without doing a very generous Action; which was sending back <HI>Deaan Mun∣dumber</HI>'s Wife and Daughter to him; telling her, he did not mean it as a Compliment to her Husband, but in respect to herself, and Family; she being Neice to the King of <HI>Yung-Owl,</HI> one of the greatest Princes on the Island: Nor did he do it to give him an Example of returning the like; for he had no Wife, and was well assur'd, by the Help of God who would favour his just Cause, that it would not be in his Power to take his Family.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> heard of his Son's Town being taken, he thought it was high Time to revenge them; and accordingly musters a great Army, threatning how he would ruin the Country, destory the Men, and make Slaves of their Families. He also sent to our Master to join him, which he peremptorily refus'd, saying, "He would not join with his profess'd "Enemies against his experienc'd Friends;" but did not declare his Intentions of being against him. They both sent to <HI>Deaan Me∣phontey,</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="177"/>
but he refus'd to be concern'd on ei∣ther Side, and was as good as his Word; for his Dominions extending to the River <HI>Man∣derra,</HI> the Bounds of <HI>Antenosa,</HI> he was appre∣hensive the <HI>Antenosa</HI> People might take the Advantage of his Absence, and plunder his Towns and Country.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> march'd from <HI>Fenno∣arevo,</HI> he did not leave his Towns quite desti∣tute of Men, for Fear of <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> and <HI>Afferrer;</HI> but he never suspected us. While he was gone <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mevar∣row</HI> join'd their Forces, and went out to see what they could get; they surpris'd three Towns, the Men making a very weak Resistance; so they brought off about two hundred Cattle and fifty Slaves. My Master was discover'd by my being (a white Man) with him. This was unexpected to them, and <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Wife immediately sent him Word of it; and that she was in Fear of us. To which he answer'd, <Q>“He would soon dispatch the Business he was about, and then he would be sufficiently re∣veng'd of <HI>Deaan Mevarrow;”</HI></Q> but we took Care to be provided for him.</P>
<P>IN the Way homewards, the Cattle and Slaves were divided equally between <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> and <HI>Rer Mimebolambo;</HI> and they then resolv'd, that it was absolutely necessary to live together in one Town. Ours was the
<PB N="159" REF="178"/>
strongest, but not large enough; theirs was much larger, and they had also a great many empty Houses, which were left by some who went away when the Wars broke out; so it was agreed we should go there. We lost no Time, for the very same Day we went Home, we pack'd up our Goods, and march'd away to <HI>Merhaundrovarta,</HI> which was the Name of <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI>'s Town; and deserted our own in a Fortnight after we had built it. Thus were we driven about like wild Boars, which in this Country change their Holes every Day, and go from one Wood to ano∣ther, for Fear the wild Dogs should find them out. And we were not only forc'd to secure our∣selves against the Surprises of a Body of our Enemies, but living so near each other, three or four, or half a dozen of their Men would often lurk privately in the Woods near Towns, to see if they could catch a Woman, Child, or Slave of ours straying out, or on any Business, as dig∣ging wild Yams, &amp;c. so that we had very sel∣dom any Thing else to eat but Beef; and those who had it of their own gave to them who had none.</P>
<P>BUT I had an Employment here, which maintain'd me handsomely; and it seem'd as if Providence had pleas'd to appoint it on pur∣pose for my Support in this Time of Scarcity: The People of this Part of the Island do not
<PB N="160" REF="179"/>
care to eat Beef, which is not kill'd by one descended from a Race of Kings; now my Ma∣ster, just before the War broke out, growing high and proud, and having none but himself, and his Brother to do these Offices, they were sometimes oblig'd to go five or six Miles to kill an Ox: He, at length, consider'd that these People have a great Opinion of all white Men, and more especially taking me for the Cap∣tain's Son, whom they look'd upon to be the same as a King, I was thought of honourable Descent enough to be preferr'd to the Dig∣nity of a Butcher; tho' in Truth, I did no more than cut the Throat of the Beast, and they cut him up themselves; for this I always had my Fee, which was a large Piece of Meat. My Master, as well as many others, saw that this was a very ridiculous Custom; but he also knew that the Vulgar are not to be violently oppos'd in their old WAYS, be they ever so foolish and absurd; and had <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> peevishly refus'd to do this Office, and call'd it a silly Humour of theirs, such an abrupt Inno∣vation would have been attended with almost a general Desertion; for they would have gone, and liv'd under other Lords: He, therefore, con∣triv'd to substitute me in his Place, and by that Means did (as all wise Governors will) seemingly conform to Custom to Oblige the People; yet by an ingenious Expedient shifted off from him∣self a mean and troublesome Office.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="180"/>
THE next Morning the Cattle were shar'd, my Master had ten, his Brother six, and the principal Men one a Piece; some others one between two; and we Slaves one between four. Now I wanted not Beef, for I was of∣ten employ'd, while in this Town, to kill the Beasts; nevertheless I was oblig'd to agree with my Partners to kill ours, for they wanted it tho' I did not. I liv'd pretty well here, often changing Beef for Potatoes, &amp;c. with the Towns-People, and here we heard of the Ravage <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> made in the Country: The People, who were ally'd to <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack,</HI> and liv'd in small Towns, left their Habitations, and went with their Families and Cattle beyond <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s to∣ward the Sea, where they were under his Pro∣tection. When <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> came to the de∣serted Towns, he burnt them, and utterly de∣stroy'd the Plantations, pulling up every Thing by the Roots, as if his Design was to cause a Famine in the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> was all this While with his Brother <HI>Mussecorow,</HI> marching towards them, and had such good Intelligence, that he came under Cover of a Wood undiscover'd, almost upon them. They were then making wretched Havock of a very large Plantation of Pota∣toes, and some other adjacent Ones. He di∣vided his Army into four Parts, resolving to
<PB N="162" REF="181"/>
attack them on every Side, while they were about their accursed Business, himself boldly shewing his Face in Front, whom they hur∣ry'd to oppose; while the other Parties firing each from their Post, kill'd a great many, and put the rest into Confusion. However, they made a vigorous Resistance, retreating and forcing their Way to a Wood; where it was not practicable to follow them. Here <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> rally'd them, and put them in good Order, in proper Divisions, each one un∣der his own, or one of his Son's Command; for his three Sons, <HI>Mundumber, Chahary,</HI> and <HI>Frukey</HI> were with him: They were a great many more in Number than the other, some said, near twice as many; which <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack</HI> knew very well, as also his Uncle's Courage; but he was, nevertheless, resolv'd to engage him: And tho' he had Time enough to have retreated, yet he only march'd back into the Plain, to have good Ground and Time to form his Army; which he did, and waited for his Enemy's Coming to attack him. It was not long before they fell on very furi∣ously, and were as hotly receiv'd, firing and throwing Lances; till <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> per∣ceiving his Brother <HI>Mussecorrow</HI>'s Division be∣gan to give Ground, he was resolv'd to make one vigorous Push himself, and throwing away his Gun, he, with six small Lances in his
<PB N="163" REF="182"/>
Hand, challeng'd several of his principal Men to follow him, if they durst, into the thickest of the Enemy's Body, which they very gal∣lantly did; but he, being formost, ran like an enraged Lion, and in spite of all their Fire and flying Lances, came to close fighting Hand to Hand with his Lances; and those gallant Men with him following his Exam∣ple, drove all that Division of their Enemy's Army back, and put it into utter Confusion; and they, not being able to abide their Fury, ran for it. They broke into the very Part where <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> himself was fighting, who had been struck through with a Lance by one of <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Companions, had he not generously himself prevented it; desiring them not to kill his Uncle. He left his Peo∣ple to persue them, and himself ran to assist <HI>Mussecorrow,</HI> who, at the same Time, made a bold Push, being asham'd to be out-done; ne∣vertheless they had been ruin'd, had not <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> himself came to their Assistance in that Juncture; but they were soon in one general Rout and Disorder, running towards the Woods, where <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> follow'd them to keep them from rallying; and car∣ry'd on the Pursuit till he saw they were di∣spirited, and making towards their own Home to recruit themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="183"/>
<HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> finding he could do no good with <HI>Murnanzack,</HI> was resolv'd he would not be idle, and let <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> and <HI>Rer Mime∣bolambo</HI> join him, and make him stronger; so he resolv'd as well out of Policy as Revenge to attack us: But he had no sooner declar'd his Intentions, and prepar'd for it, than a Friend of <HI>Mevarrow</HI>'s came out by Night, and acquainted him with it: On this Informa∣tion he consulted with <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> for their Defence; and in Order thereunto, con∣sidering there were so many Cattle in Town as would disturb them in an Engagement, he propos'd sending some away to <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack</HI>'s; where the other People had se∣cur'd theirs. <HI>Deaan Rer Mimebolambo</HI> would not send any of his, but my Master, willing to have something to live on, in Case they should lose what they had here, pick'd out forty Beasts; some of our richest Men also sent some six, and some more or less apiece: In short, there were in all fourscore and eleven Beasts separated from the rest to be sent a∣way. I perceiv'd what was going forward, and would have hid myself, and been out of Sight; for I did not know whether I should live so well there as here, besides it was a great Number for one Person to take Care of: But there was no Remedy, No-body else would send a Slave with me, and my Master
<PB N="165" REF="184"/>
would spare no more himself than one, and he look'd on me to be the most capable of any one Man to do it; so ordering six or seven Men with Arms to guard and conduct me, I took my Leave of my Friends and Acquain∣tance, and went forward.</P>
<P>WE were oblig'd to go round about by tedious unpractis'd Ways, and to look out di∣ligently, for Fear our Enemies should inter∣cept us; but we had chosen an Opportunity when they were dispirited by their Defeat, and suspected nothing of any such Prize be∣ing near them: So we arriv'd in two Days at <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s Town on the Hills of <HI>Yong∣gorvo,</HI> where we stopp'd two Days to rest our Cattle; and were going on the third in the Morning, when we heard a Shell blow. This put the Town and Country in an Uproar, expecting Enemies; they ran immediately to defend the Passage up the Hill (for there is but one) when presently came two Messen∣gers from <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> to <HI>Deaan Affer∣rer,</HI> to tell him, that he was at the Bottom of the Hill coming to visit him. When my Guardians saw them join, and perceiv'd it was <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> as soon as the usual Civili∣ties were over between the two Brothers, they went to <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> and told him, that <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> had sent some Cattle, and a Man to look after them, to be convey'd somewhere
<PB N="166" REF="185"/>
under his Protection. <Q>“He bid them thank <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> for his Friendship and As∣sistance; and tell him, His Cattle should have the same Care taken of them as his own; for he would put them together.”</Q> After they had deliver'd up their Charge, they took their Leaves of me; and return'd.</P>
<P><HI>WHEN</HI> Deaan Murnanzack <HI>came to see the Cattle, and found me left with them, he seem'd surpris'd: He ask'd me, if</HI> I was Cow∣keeper? <HI>and said,</HI> He never heard of a white Man being put to look after Cattle. <HI>I told him,</HI> It was my Master's Pleasure, and that I did not dispute it with him; but must do it as well as I could.</P>
<P>THREE Days after <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> went homeward, ordering three Servants to assist me, and we follow'd in the Rear; we had also with us above a dozen other People, who car∣ry'd Provision, Bedding, &amp;c. for their Ma∣sters. When we were down the Hill I found a new Scene, the Soil was of a quite different Colour and Nature, yellow Clay with Stones, which made m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Feet uneasy, being us'd be∣fore to a sandy Country; but I was soon har∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en▪d to it: The Trees also were different, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aller. This was the Place I had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wish'd to see for the wild Cattle, of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I had heard so much: I soon found the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> they made thorow the Woods;
<PB N="167" REF="186"/>
which render'd it easier driving mine than in other Woods.</P>
<P>ABOUT Noon we rested in a Grove: The whole Country is very beautiful, and finely water'd with Springs and Rivulets. They shew'd me some wild Cattle standing under the Trees; I was eager to see them nearer, and taking a Gun in my Hand, went toward them; but within thirty Yards I was oblig'd to creep on the Ground, hiding myself as well as I could with the Grass, which is very long. When I came nearer to them, I saw three other Bulls running directly toward me; their Eyes sparkl'd with Fire, their Ears prick'd upright, and foaming at the Mouth; it was suppos'd they fled from some Hun∣ters. They put me into a great Fright, in∣somuch that I thought of nothing but firing at them, to frighten them away; but as Luck would have it, I shot, and wounded one so that he fell: Notwithstanding he was down, I expected the others would have assaulted me, and, therefore, laid flat on my Face, not da∣ring to stir for Fear; till hearing no other Noise, but my Companions hallowing at a Di∣stance, I look'd up, and saw they were all run away, but the wounded one, kicking upon the Ground; whom I durst not go near, till they came, and put us both out of our Pain, by cutting his Throat, and extolling me for my
<PB N="168" REF="187"/>
Courage, and being an excellent Marks-man! See how contrary to one's Expectation Things happen▪ I thought of being laugh'd at for my Cowardice, and was applauded by Mistake, and Chance, for Bravery.</P>
<P>WHILE they were cutting up the Bull, I could not forbear looking with Wonder, at those, which they call'd <HI>Wild Cattle,</HI> and which are, indeed, so here; but they are so like our <HI>English</HI> Cattle in every respect, that I could see no Difference: Nor since I have been bet∣ter acquainted with them have I discover'd any; except that, I think, the Horns of our Bulls in <HI>England</HI> are somewhat shorter, and they roar louder than these wild Bulls. When we had cut up our Beef, we roasted some; and were not a little pleas'd with the Thoughts of our Masters leaving us, because we should not spoil their Sport, and we happen'd on better Luck than they, and had Beef to eat sooner; as also some ready to dress for them at the Place appointed to meet at Night: You may be sure, this Bull-beef could not be comparable in Goodness to that of the tame; especially after it had run so much before it was kill'd. These wild Cattle sometimes give the Hunters a Chace of several Miles after they are wounded, which makes the Flesh very indifferent Meat, especially if it is a Bull; but People are glad of what they can get,
<PB N="169" REF="188"/>
when they are in Want: For these wild Cat∣tle are a great Benefit to People in remote Parts, who, in necessitous Times, come here on hunting; tho' they are also as plentiful in another vast Tract of Forest Land of some hundred Miles in Extent; of which I shall have an Occasion to give an Account, and also of their suppos'd Original. The Place where we baited at Noon, and lay this Night were agreeable and delightful Groves; and so, in∣deed, is all this Country for several Days Jour∣nies, abounding in wild Honey, wild Boars, good, wholesom and pleasant Fruits of the Trees and Earth; and these in such Variety, that Men may not only find enough to sa∣tisfy their Hunger and Thirst; but even to indulge their luxurious Appetites, without the Pains of cultivating and planting; and many do so live.</P>
<P>AMONG the most useful and pleasant Fruits of the Earth is the <HI>Faungidge,</HI> which I here first saw; my Companions taking me with them into the thickest Woods. They look first for the Place, which is a tender Creeper, or wild Vine taking hold of a Tree, or any Thing which stands next it; twining round the Body, even to the Top of the Tree, and dividing itself into several Branches, like a Vine. I never observ'd any Fruit it bore, and was amas'd, when they told me, it was the Root
<PB N="170" REF="189"/>
of this, which produc'd the <HI>Faungidge;</HI> and yet instead of digging at the Root, they went about half a dozen Yards from it round a∣bout, and struck the Ground with the End of their Lances, to find where it sounded hol∣low; and there digging, they took up the <HI>Faungidge.</HI> The Root spreads a great Way under Ground, and there are but few Branches of it, which bear the <HI>Faungidge:</HI> So that it might be endless tracing it from where it ap∣pears above Ground. The first which I saw dug here, was not much less in Bulk than a Gallon Runlet: It is red and smooth with∣out, the Coat as thin as a Parchment, the In∣side is white, and has a milky Juice; it eats as soft as a Water-Mellon, but has no Seeds in it; it is both Meat and Drink, very whol∣some, and always eaten raw.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Verlaway</HI> is of the same Kind, very little different in every respect; except that the Skin of the latter is thinner, but so tough, that it must be par'd with a Knife. There is another Sort of this, call'd the <HI>Verlaway-voler;</HI> which we look on to be unwhosome: I once saw a Man, who had eaten some of it, and it made him swell and sick; but by giv∣ing him some melted Fat to drink, he brought it up, and was reliev'd. This <HI>Verlaway-voler</HI> is easily known, it being more beautiful to the Eye, and the Leaf which springs from it is very indifferent.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="190"/>
THE next Day I saw excellent Sport: For <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> not leaving us, as he did the Day before, in the Morning we saw one single Bull alone in the Midst of a large Plain; he, having a Mind for a little Diversion, order'd us to stop, while himself, and two more drove my Cattle toward the Bull; who no sooner saw them approach, but he fell a roaring, and dig∣ging up the Ground with his Horns, as if he expected some other was coming to fight him; when he perceiv'd Cows, he shew'd an Inclina∣tion to be better acquainted with them: The <HI>Deaan,</HI> and his Companions conceal'd them∣selves under Cover of the Cows, and letting them graze a little, and then driving them a little, till the wild Bull was amongst them; and just as he was putting his Nose to a Cow's Tail, <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> from under another Cow's Belly, stuck a Lance in his Flank; a∣way he ran with it, but not till he had ano∣ther stuck in his Side: And now they had Room for the Sport they aim'd at, which was not unlike what I have heard describ'd of <HI>Spanish</HI> Bull-Feasts. Several now came in∣to the Chace, he ran near a Mile out-right before he stopp'd, and turn'd to the Pursuers; which is what they always do, when they find themselves sorely wounded; and then let every Man take Care of himself: For it is a dange∣rous Encounter, as it was here, the Beast was
<PB N="172" REF="191"/>
outragious, and turning upon them, ran di∣rectly at the Man who threw a Lance at him, while another from behind threw another; then the Bull turn'd again, as he always does, to the Man whom he sees throw at him; and the Hunters being divided to take him which Way soever he turns, and also keeping a good Distance, as well to prevent hurting one ano∣ther, as to give him Scope to play in, they at length kill'd him; but this sometimes proves a tragical Pastime, and I have seen a Man kill'd at it.</P>
<P>THIS Night we lay in a Wood, where we found <HI>Faungidge</HI> enough; thus we liv'd deli∣ciously with only what the Country yielded us. I ty'd up my Calves every Night, to keep my Cows from straying, and was forc'd to rise two or three Times, to see that none of my Cattle got among the wild Ones; for when∣ever they do, it is troublesome catching them again; they running whenever they see the others run, and almost as fast.</P>
<P>THE next Day at Noon we halted at a Spring, which comes from the highest Hill in this Island, call'd <HI>Vohitch-Maner,</HI> or Red-Hill; <HI>Vohitch</HI> signifying Hill, or Mountain. I drove my Cattle into a fine Valley, where there was good Grass; and there came among them a wild Bull, and mounted one of my Cows: I had a great Mind to try to kill him, tho'
<PB N="173" REF="192"/>
I almost shook for Fear; they are terrible Creatures to any Body's View who is not us'd to them, and it was this Fear was the Cause of my ill Success; for covering myself under another Cow, I made such an awkward Stroak at him, that I wounded one of my own in∣stead of him. However, as it did not prove mortal I conceal'd it; not so much for Fear of any Danger I was in from the Anger of my Master, as that I knew I should have been laugh'd at, for wounding a tame Cow instead of a wild Bull.</P>
<P>WE set up early this Afternnoon, in a Place conveniently situated near good Water; and then we went out to see for <HI>Wild Honey</HI> and <HI>Faungidge.</HI> I had the good Fortune to meet with a large Hole in a hollow Tree full of it; I made a Fire, and with a Brand smoak'd the Bees out. I next cut down a <HI>Vounturk,</HI> to make a Vessel like a Tub, to put my Honey in. This <HI>Vounturk</HI> is a Tree, or Plant, (for I don't know which to call it) of a very sin∣gular Shape and Nature: It grows upright about sixteen or eighteen Foot high, small below, big in the Middle, and small again above, like a Nine-pin; at the Top are two or three Branches bearing very long Leaves; in the Spring they have Blossoms, but I never saw any Fruit come to Perfection; the outer Bark is whitish, like old Lead, and full of

Thorns four or five Inches long; which are, however, very easily struck off with a Lance, with which also we cut the Bark round, and the Tree immediately falls down, not being able to support itself: We then take away what Length we want, and with our Hands pull out the spungy Substance on the Inside, till within three or four Inches of the Bot∣tom. Thus we make a Vessel light and easy of Carriage, and in one of these I put my Ho∣ney. The Liquor of this <HI>Vounturk</HI> is good Drink, and even fit to boil any Thing in, when Water is scarce. I found also some <HI>Faun∣gidge.</HI> When I return'd, I went to <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack,</HI> and made him a Present of some Ho∣ney; which is a Compliment our Lords always expect.</P>
<P>IT was now Night, and they were going a Beef-hunting: When they go out on Purpose to kill the best Beasts, they always choose a dark Night. They admitted me, on my Re∣quest, to go with them; bidding me wash myself, as they all did, that we might not smell of Smoak, nor Sweat. I took two Lan∣ces as usual, but they made me leave one be∣hind me, lest two might rattle in my Hand. These Cattle feed only in the Night, and if they did not take all these Precautions they could never surprise them; for they are al∣ways on their Guard, snorting with their Noses,
<PB N="175" REF="194"/>
and listening after Enemies. We can hear them bellow, and the Bulls roar a great Way off; by which we know where they are, and always go round till they are directly to the Windward of us: For if we were to go toward them with the Wind, they would soon scent us. When we had got the Wind and Cattle right-a-head, and were within hearing, we walk'd very softly and circumspectly; pulling the Top of the Grass with our Hands, as near as was possible, mimicking the Noise a Cow makes with biting it. They no sooner heard us, but they were all hush on a sudden; no bellowing, nor grazing, but stood still listen∣ing: Which when we perceiv'd, we all stood likewise without speaking, or walking, only three or four who understood it best, kept pulling the Grass. When the Cattle had li∣sten'd, till (as we suppose) they took us to be some of their own Kind, they fell to gra∣zing again, and we walk'd cautiously on nearer, mimicking them. <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> made me keep behind, for fear they should espy my white Skin, and be frighted; he also gave me his Lamber to cover myself with, which was black Silk; so that if I had been in their View, they could have seen nothing but my Face; for the Grass is above Knee deep.</P>
<P>WE got at length amongst them, so that one of our Men (as he told me) with some
<PB N="176" REF="195"/>
Grass in his Hand, and under the Cover of a Bush, took hold of the Dug of a Cow, and felt whether she gave Milk; but finding she did not, he concluded she was not lean; and therefore stuck his Lance into her Belly, and pull'd it out again, making no other Motion himself. The Cow which is wounded will, perhaps, give a Spring, and make a Noise, as if another had run her Horns against her; and this is so common among them, that the Herd is not disturb'd by it: So that our Peo∣ple stuck three or four on this Manner, and left them, with Intent to come the next Morn∣ing, and track them by their Blood; it being dangerous to come near them in the Night: For when they find themselves sorely wounded, they run away from their Companions, and will assault any Man they see. They are com∣monly found lying dead, or fallen in some Wood, or Shelter of Bushes, as if they en∣deavour'd to hide themselves. Just as we were going away, and I had return'd <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack</HI> his Lamber, a Calf, who was mor∣tally wounded, began to make an Uproar; and running about, made the Herd suspect something: So that away they ran, and the Calf came directly at me, and beat me back∣wards; I catch'd hold of his Leg, and call'd out for Help. This Accident caus'd Laugh∣ter, and was a Jest upon me, for calling out
<PB N="177" REF="196"/>
for Help against a little Calf: However, they took him, cut him to Pieces, and carry'd him away; of whom we made a good Supper. I have heard, that notwithstanding the Wild∣ness of these Cattle; the Cows will stand still to have their Dugs handl'd, and in the Night have been milk'd into an Horn; but as I ne∣ver did this myself, I cannot vouch the Truth of it; yet I have been so often told it, I can∣not help crediting it.</P>
<P>WE made no Haste homeward, for ourselves and Cattle too, liv'd as well as we could there; so that tho' we kept going on, yet we made several Days more of our Journey than we should have done. A Day, or two, after this Beef-hunt∣ing, we had an accidental Sport of another kind: Our Dogs had got the Scent of wild Hogs in a Thicket, and were very busy running round it; but could find no Entrance for a long Time. At length they discover'd the Path the Swine had made, and attempted to enter the Wood by it; the Passage was defended by a huge Boar, who fought the Dogs, and wounded one of them dangerously: Now what with the Dogs and the Swine, here was such a yelping, grunting, and squaulling, that the Woods rang with their Noise; and one would have thought, all the Hogs in the Island had agreed to meet here, and sight out their Quarrel against us.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="197"/>
WE laid down our Burdens, and some of us went to them, arm'd with Guns and Lan∣ces; <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> shot the Boar, who wounded his Dog; when immediately came another, and defended the Entrance, fighting so resolutely, that neither the Dogs, nor our∣selves could come at the Herd, who were within; till we made a Way behind them with our Hatchets and Lances, and then fir'd, and kill'd some of the stoutest who turn'd to us: The others seeing themselves attack'd behind, fought their Way through the Dogs, and ran for it, with the Dogs after them. It is im∣possible to describe in Words the Noise there was, especially after several were wounded. We found seven dead, besides some so hurt that they could not make off; we pick'd out only one of the fattest, for there are very few will eat them. I did not dare to take it, be∣cause of my Office of killing Beeves; and the Eating of Swine's Flesh is so contemptible, that I should have lessen'd my Dignity, and been degraded from my Office; which, what∣ever mean Thoughts I might have, as to the Honour of it, I had too great an Opinion of its Value, to part with for the Gratification of my Appetite in one Meal; for they are curious to a Punctilio in this Case, that if the Daughter of a King is marry'd to any one that is not of a King's Family, their Children are
<PB N="179" REF="198"/>
not admitted to the Honour of killing Beeves, tho' the Father be a Freeman, and a Chief amongst his Neighbours.</P>
<P>EVERY Evening we us'd to sit down near the Prince, and talk of one thing or another to pass away the Time: Now it is the ge∣neral Usage of the Princes here, to converse very familiarly with every Body; yet do they, nevertheless, preserve a decent State and Di∣stinction. The People all over the Island have a religious Regard to Dreams, and think that the good <HI>Daemon</HI> (for I know not what Name else to give to the inferior Deities, which, they say, attends each to its respective <HI>Owley)</HI> comes, and tells them in their Dreams, when they ought to do a Thing, or to warn them of some Danger; more especially after a Sacrifice and Prayer made to God, and Invocation of this <HI>Daemon.</HI> I very well remember the Discourse this Evening was on this Subject; the next Morning <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> came to me as I was alone, and talk'd very freely with me about many Things; particularly advising me to take what Beef I wanted, and could carry, for we should have no more Oppor∣tunities of killing wild Cattle after this Day. When I observ'd him desirous of Conversa∣tion, I told him, if there was any Thing in Dreams, as some had said the Night before, I should have a great Deal of Anger from
<PB N="180" REF="199"/>
him that Day, having dream'd, <Q>“That I was at my Father's House, with my Parents and Relations about me; my Pockets full of Gold, and they giving more. This, <HI>I said,</HI> did not only throw me into a Melancholy when I awak'd, to find myself naked in a Wood, and a strange Country, instead of my Fa∣ther's House; but it also gave me some Concern, for that I had always remark'd when I was a Boy in <HI>England,</HI> and also un∣der my Master <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> that to dream of <HI>Plenty of Gold-Money</HI> was a certain Sign of Anger.”</Q> At this <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> smil'd, and answer'd, <Q>“I wonder that you, who, but last Night, laugh'd at the Talk of God's sending Dreams by the good <HI>Daemons,</HI> should now be afraid of one. However, <HI>says he,</HI> I dare say, you will be mistaken in this, for I don't know any Thing you can do to make me angry.”</Q> I would not have my Reader think, I trouble him with this Story, meerly for the sake of telling a foolish Dream; but it prov'd the Introduction to something very remarkable, and furnish'd us with a Discourse the next Evening worth repeating.</P>
<P>THE next Day we roasted our Beef, and laid it to cool, in Order to bind up in a Bur∣den, which we call <HI>an Enter,</HI> to carry at our Backs. I had nothing to do but to provide for myself, and what with my Beef and Ho∣ney,
<PB N="181" REF="200"/>
I was pretty well loaded, and as well contented, for I liv'd plentifully and delici∣ously; my Honey also mix'd with Water made me a pleasant Drink. This was the last Day of our passing through these Groves and Habitations of the wild Cattle; some of which they made another Attempt to surround, more for the Sport-sake than Want of Beef; and in this, I, for Want of Knowledge, spoil'd all their Diversion, by crossing the Way they were running, which was towards the Place where <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> laid in Ambush for them: This caus'd them to run another Way, and put him into a furious Passion at first; insomuch that he lifted up his Lance, threat∣ning to kill me, and I expected no less; which made me get away from him as fast as I could, and keep out of Sight, dreading some such barbarous Treatment, as I had before receiv'd from <HI>Deaan Mevarrow:</HI> But this Prince was of a more generous Disposition, for when his Passion was over, he sent for me, and desir'd I would come in the Evening, as usual, and sit down by him; which I did: He then de∣sir'd me to give him some Account of the Customs of my Country; and particularly, <HI>What God, or Gods we worship,</HI> since I seem'd to have so little Regard to theirs; and that I would be free, and tell them what Things, I (who had been a great Traveller) had seen
<PB N="182" REF="201"/>
in Order to pass the Evening away the plea∣santer. And first says he, <HI>What God do you adore?</HI> On this the Company drew round me, and I began. But,</P>
<P>I first desir'd them to tell me, <Q>“If they did not know there was a God above the Skies.”</Q> I could not say <HI>Heaven,</HI> beause there was no Word in their Language which signifies <HI>Heaven;</HI> nor could I perceive, that they had any Notion of what Christians mean by <HI>Hea∣ven,</HI> as the Place of God's Residence, and Mansion of the Saints after this Life. They told me, <Q>“”There was a God above, the su∣preme one Lord of all other Gods, Daemons, or Spirits whatsoever. This very God, <HI>said I,</HI> is the God we worship; for we know of no other inferior Gods, nor do we pay Adoration, or make Prayers to any Thing else, but this One, the Supreme and Only God, and think it not good to adore any other. And do you not, <HI>said they,</HI> make Prayers and Sacrifices, and call upon one of these Guardian <HI>Daemons</HI> to assist you, and let you know the Mind of God, and warn you of Dangers, and protect you? If your Country-men had such <HI>Owleys</HI> as we have, the good <HI>Daemons</HI> who are invok'd, when we sacrifice before them, would have assisted ye; and that Night, when ye lay on the Sands, ye would have been told in
<PB N="183" REF="202"/>
Dreams of the Danger, and been directed to escape before Morning.</Q></P>
<P>To this I answer'd, <Q>“That all good Men in <HI>England</HI> acknowledge God's Providence, and I think it was by the Providence of God that I was sav'd from Death; and why God did not think fit, that the rest should save their Lives, is what I do not pretend to know: But I cannot conceive that your <HI>Owleys,</HI> which to me you seem to worship, and pray to, should have a Spirit, or a God within them, and come in the Night when you are asleep, and tell you such Things. I see they are Wood, and <HI>Alli∣gators</HI> Teeth, only dress'd up; and I see, and know how they are made, and I am sure other Wood, and other <HI>Alligators</HI> Teeth are not living Spirits to speak, and see Things present, much less Things to come; and we think it abominable to pay that Adoration to any Thing, which belongs on∣ly to God; since the great God himself has forbid us to worship any Thing but him∣self.”</Q></P>
<P><HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> listen'd to me with At∣tention, and then turn'd to some of his Peo∣ple, and reason'd a good While with them, partly vindicating me, and endeavouring to explain, and argue with them on these <HI>Ow∣leys;</HI> which I find since, I had not a just No∣tion
<PB N="184" REF="203"/>
of; but I was too young when reduc'd to this Slavery, and had neither Companions nor Books to assist me, that I did not attend to make those Remarks then, which I could now do.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed, when the <HI>Deaan</HI> had done talking with them, he turn'd to me, and said, <Q>“”I think it strange, that you, who but this Morning told me a Dream of yours, and you saw it happen'd true, as you expected, should argue against these <HI>Owleys;</HI> you mis∣take us, it is not the Wood, nor the <HI>Alli∣gators</HI> Teeth, but there are certain Guar∣dian <HI>Daemons,</HI> who will take Care of Na∣tions, Families and private Men; and if you have one of these <HI>Owleys,</HI> and give it the Name of some Guardian Spirit, it will attend you▪ For how could you come by the Knowledge this Morning, that I should be angry with you, if one of these good <HI>Daemons</HI> had not come to you, and shew'd it, and thereby gave you Warning; and if you had not had this Warning, perhaps, you might have been kill'd, tho' I did not design it. But Mens Passions are unruly, and I was provok'd, tho' I say not this to reproach you, as if I thought you spoil'd our Hunting on Purpose; for I know very well you did not mean any Harm, only I put you in Mind, that you argue against
<PB N="185" REF="204"/>
your-self: Besides, if the Spirits of our Fore-fathers, or these Guardian <HI>Daemons</HI> did not shew Men these Things, how should they know them? No Man could tell that I should be angry with you, when you had not given me Occasion; nor did you design to give me any, and nothing was done to expect any such Thing: I hope, you don't think, that the great God him∣self came, and told you, when these infe∣rior Spirits, of whom there are so many, could better come: But you said just now, that the Great, Supreme God had told you, that you must worship nothing but him∣self, pray, Did any white Men ever see this Great God above? Or does he come often, and talk with them, and not with us?</Q></P>
<P>TO which I answer'd, that <Q>“No Man ever saw God, but some of our Fore-fathers did once, many Ages ago, hear his Voice, when he came down, and appear'd to them in a Cloud." But, <HI>says he,</HI> if this was so many Years ago, and there is no such Thing now, nor any Man in the World living, black or white, that ever heard God's Voice, or saw him in a Cloud, how are you sure it is true? And you say it is many Ages ago, Things may be so chang'd, or misreprented, from what they were, when your first Fore-fathers told them, that you cannot depend
<PB N="186" REF="205"/>
on their Certainty.”</Q> I was here at a great Loss, because they had no Knowledge of Let∣ters; and therefore, I could not make them understanding any Thing of the Scriptures: I only told them, we had a Way of preserv∣ing the Memory of Things, which they knew nothing of; and by this Means, I said, we had an Account of the <HI>Beginning of the World,</HI> and of <HI>Its being created by God;</HI> and that I could tell them a great many strange Things relating thereunto; which they then desir'd to hear.</P>
<P>AND accordingly I told them, that the <HI>World was originally dark, and a confused Heap;</HI> and that <HI>God made the Sun and Moon, Beast, Fish, Fowl, Trees, Herbs,</HI> and ever Thing else. They still continu'd the first Objection; and, as they thought, with more Reason than before. <Q>“For, <HI>said one of them,</HI> if you have a better Way of keeping the Memory of Things than we, yet I am sure, you can't have the Know∣ledge of what was done, before there was any Man made to see it.”</Q> To this I re∣ply'd, <Q>“That God had reveal'd the Know∣ledge of this, and a great deal more to some particular Persons:”</Q> Which they glad∣ly attending to hear, I went on to the <HI>Crea∣tion of Man,</HI> and then of the <HI>Woman's being made out of a Rib, which God took from him while h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was asleep.</HI> At this they all broke
<PB N="187" REF="206"/>
out into Amazement and Laughter, and <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> said, <Q>“It was a plain Untruth; and that it was a Shame to tell it with a serious Countenance; by this, <HI>he said,</HI> he knew all the rest was false, for if this was true, a Woman would have a Rib more than a Man, and a Man want one on one Side, and have fewer than on the other.”</Q> Here I committed a great Error thro' Igno∣rance, which, however, I can't help confessing; I hope, our Divines, and all good Christians will consider the Circumstances I was in, and forgive me: For I had no more Wit, than to insist on the Truth of it; and affirm what I had heard, when a Child, from ignorant Per∣sons, <Q>“That a Man had one Rib less on one Side than the other;”</Q> and I had Assurance enough to put the whole Argument upon this Issue, and offer'd to lay my Life as a Wager on it. The Prince laugh'd at me, and refus'd my Wager; but we had two Women with us, one was very lean, whom they call'd, and told her Ribs, finding them equal; and then a Man, and found the same: But they were not all of them convinc'd of the true Num∣ber, not perfectly satisfying themselves, nor could I myself, in attempting to count them after them. From this Time, I perceiv'd, <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> treated all I said on Reli∣gon with Contempt, and immediately resum'd
<PB N="188" REF="207"/>
his former Objection with more Vigour, and said, <Q>“That to talk what was done before Man was made was silly; and that what I said of God's talking with Men, and tell∣ing them such Things had no Proof; and the Things I pretended to know, and talk of, were only old Womens Stories. How∣ever, <HI>says he,</HI> go on, and give us some fur∣ther Account of this God of yours, who for∣merly talk'd with Men.”</Q> Then I went on with the Scripture Story of <HI>God's Wrath, and the Flood, which destroy'd all Men and Beasts on the Earth, but those in the Ark; and of</HI> Noah<HI>'s taking Male and Female of every Kind to pre∣serve them.</HI> Here another objected, and said, <Q>“If they had been all destroy'd, could not God, who made them at first, make more at his Pleasure?”</Q> But I went on, and told them of the <HI>Rainbow;</HI> and that it was made as <HI>a Sign to signify that the World should never be drowned again. Deaan Murnanzack</HI> objected, <Q>“That they had no Memory of any such Thing deliver'd to them from their Fore∣fathers; besides, <HI>says he,</HI> if none but <HI>Noah,</HI> with his Sons and Daughters were sav'd, pray was <HI>Noah</HI> a white Man, or a black Man?”</Q> To which I answer'd, <Q>“Sir, I per∣ceive you give no Credit to what I say of this Nature.”</Q> He said, <Q>“There are a great many Things which I don't know,
<PB N="189" REF="208"/>
and shall be glad to be inform'd of; and would give Credit to any Thing, that a reasonable Man can give Credit to; but most of these Things are nothing but old Womens Stories; and I am sure all white Men will not talk as you do.”</Q> These were his very Words, which he repeated several Times, and was the Conclusion of the Argument, and the Evening's Conference. It was no small Trou∣ble to me, to find how the Truth suffer'd by my Weakness; but I was in some Hope, that <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> who was a Man of great Understanding, might consider that I was but a Child when I left <HI>England,</HI> and therefore, not well acquainted with the Things I under∣took to inform them of.</P>
<P>THE next Day we went forward directly, for we were now past all the wild Cattle; and therefore, <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> hasten'd homeward. About the Middle of the After∣noon, we came to a Place where the Road divided; here the Prince halted, as I found, on Purpose to take his Leave of me, order∣ing two Men to conduct me, and my Cattle, to his Cow-keeper. Here we parted, and we laid that Night near the Banks of a River, which bounds <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Country, and runs into <HI>Madamvovo,</HI> the great River, which passes thorow <HI>Anterndroea.</HI> To this Place, where I was going, all the Cattle come
<PB N="190" REF="209"/>
to Water. As we pass'd thorow the Woods, we met a Company of Men and Women go∣ing to fetch Water; they stop'd, and gaz'd at me with Wonder, having never seen a white Man; asking the Men who accompa∣ny'd me, What I was? and Where I came from? who roguishly told them, <Q>“They found me in the Forest among the wild Cattle, and were going to present me to the Prince.”</Q> I, to carry on the Jest, ran toward the Women, speaking some gibberish, and frighted one of them into Fits; inso∣much that the rest had much a-do to reco∣ver her; for which I was afterwards very sorry.</P>
<P>THIS Wood reach'd from the River about seven Miles, without any Break, or Plain, till within a Mile of the Town. I was concern'd to think, what a great Way I had to drive my Cattle to Water every other Day; but it prov'd better than I expected, for there be∣ing eight or ten of us, we took it by Turns; so that it did not come to each one's Turn above once in sixteen or twenty Days: Then there being no Grass by the Way, there was no Hindrance; and when they return'd hun∣gry, they would go home fast enough.</P>
<P>THE People here had never seen a white Man before, so that I was a very surprising Sight to them at first; but they were soon
<PB N="191" REF="210"/>
acquainted with me, and I became very ser∣viceable: For whenever they had an Ox to kill, they were forc'd to go a great Way for one of the Royal Family; this Trouble I now sav'd them, and liv'd well myself by it. I was frequently sent for on these Occa∣sions, and had always my Fee, which was four or five Ribs to carry home with me; besides the Leg roasted for my Entertaiment there. I seldom went without a Boy to at∣tend me, there being always some ready; be∣cause I was able to gratify them with some of my Beef. I had also enough to live like other People, who are very free and gene∣rous, in communicating something of what∣ever they have to their Neighbours: When I came home with my Beef, I us'd to set on the Pot, and send Messes out to all my Neigh∣bours; which they did not fail to return, whenever it was in their Power: And it may be observ'd in the whole Course of this Hi∣story, that all the People of this Island de∣light in this free, and good-natur'd Manner of Living.</P>
<P>WHEN I was sent for, the House was al∣ways put in Order, the <HI>Owley</HI> dress'd, and plac'd in View; I was often employ'd▪ to kill a Sacrifice, as in Case of a Circumcision, or a Person's being sick; and since I had the afore-recited Conference with <HI>Deaan Murnan∣zack,</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="211"/>
I us'd out of Curiosity to listen to the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Prayers; and once or twice I attempted to talk of the Christian Religion. When I men∣tion'd the <HI>Resurrection of the Body,</HI> they told me, <Q>“It must be a Lye; and to talk to them of <HI>burning in Fire after this Life</HI> was abomi∣nable: For, <HI>said they,</HI> no Man can feel af∣ter he is dead, and except we can see Peo∣ple rais'd from Death, we will not give Credit to it.”</Q> I attempted to tell them of <HI>God's Appearing</HI> and <HI>Giving the Ten Commandments,</HI> but soon found it signify'd nothing; for they have the Purport and Meaning of all of them by Nature.</P>
<P>HERE are Laws against <HI>Adultery, Theft</HI> and <HI>Murder;</HI> and they have such an Esteem for their Parents, that they regard, and honour them even after Death; and there is also a Fine inflicted on a Man, who shall curse ano∣ther Man's Parents. They never swear pro∣fanely, but these Things they do, <Q>“because, <HI>said they,</HI> it is convenient and proper; and we could not live one by another, if there were not such Laws; and therefore, there was no Occasion for the Great God to speak these Things.”</Q> The <HI>Fourth Commandment,</HI> indeed, they do not seem to have any Notion of, except that they allow their Slaves one Day for themselves; but they have no religious Duties to perform. And when I us▪d to tell
<PB N="193" REF="212"/>
them, that we kept it holy, because <HI>God rested on it.</HI> They said, <Q>“This was like the rest; and <HI>ask'd,</HI> How I could tell what God did before there was any M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n?”</Q> And indeed, I found myself sensibly grow into Contempt with them, for talking of these Things, and was likely to get the Reputation of a common, idle Liar; so that I was forc'd to desist.</P>
<P>IN short, I had no Way to prove any Thing I said, and that Failure of the <HI>Rib</HI> in my Con∣versation with <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> was a mor∣tifying Stroak to me; and tho' I, at first, thought my ill Success in the Argument was owing to my own Ignorance, yet I have had a great many scrupulous Thoughts arise in my Mind since; and sure I am, that all was not owing to my Weakness, for our Divi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es have not furnish'd us with Arguments strong enough▪ And I don't know, but they would be hard put to it to prove those Things themselves to these People, since Miracles are ceas'd. Neither do I know what Miracle could be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow wrought, to prove what was done before any M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n was born. They are, here, Fools enough to be impos'd on by the <HI>Ʋmossees,</HI> or Conjurors; who, they think, do strange Things; yet they don't imagine, that they converse with the Great God. They think, indeed, that there are Spirits, which may be good or bad, who come in Dreams, and tell these <HI>Ʋmossees</HI> many Things; yet
<PB N="194" REF="213"/>
they do not take them to be more pious, or better Men than others, tho' they imagine them to be more knowing. However, the Awe, which my Education had fix'd on me, kept me from joining in any of their Worship, for Fear it should be Idolatry; and here was no such Thing as Persecution for Religion ever thought of among them; so that I was en∣tirely to think, and do as I pleas'd, so long as I did not affront them. I have not forgot <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s threatning to kill me at first, but it must be observ'd, there was nothing in that, but a Pride and Ill-nature peculiar to himself; as appear'd by <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI>'s hin∣dring him, and reconciling us, without obli∣ging me to join in the Ceremony.</P>
<P>I had not liv'd here above six Weeks, be∣fore I heard that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> had attack'd <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI>'s Town, and burnt it, killing two Men, and taking some of their Wives and Children captive, with almost all their Cattle. I was very much concern'd at this News, not∣withstanding that <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> had several Times in Passion attempted to kill me; yet living so long in his Family, I could not but be affected with their Misfortunes. We us'd to have here a great Deal of flying News re∣lating to their Wars; one Day an Account of a Battle fought, and the next Day a Contra∣diction of it; their Reports being just as much

small Plantations, and what Nature produ∣ces; which is indeed sufficient. They never trouble themselves, who is Lord of any par∣ticular Place, or King of the whole. <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Cow-keeper, who was my Go∣vernor, had in the former Part of his Time liv'd on this Manner, and was, therefore, ac∣quainted with some of their private Settle∣ments; he conceiv'd that I, being a Man of a singular Colour, might be impos'd on them for a Prince of <HI>Murnanzack</HI>'s Family, they be∣ing very ignorant; and yet not more so than some vulgar People in <HI>Europe,</HI> who imagine that their Princes are something more Excellent, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Extraordinary in their Make, or Shape, from the rest of Mankind. In short, the Business was agreed on, I was to have one Third of what Presents we should get, he another, and the Persons who compos'd my Retinue the other Third. They procur'd me a fine silk Lam∣ber, two, or three Strings of gawdy Beads for a Necklace, and a Gun to carry on my Shoulder; my Name on this Occasion was <HI>Rer Mimebolambo,</HI> who living the furthest off, there was the less Hazard of a Discovery; since no Man among them had ever seen any of the Family in their Lives. Twenty Men of our Neighbours were my Attendants, and we practis'd three or four Days before we went, they waiting on me, and calling me by that
<PB N="197" REF="216"/>
Name and Title, that every Man might be perfect in the Part he had to act.</P>
<P>AT length we set out, and made a very grand and formal March, with Shells blow∣ing in the Rear, as is the Custom: We had about ten, or a dozen Miles to the Place, when we came within half a Mile, my Go∣vernor, and one to attend him, went before to acquaint them, that <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s youngest Brother, <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> was passing this Way, and understanding there were Peo∣ple hereabouts, desir'd they would spare him some Provisions for himself and Retinue. We halted till we thought he had deliver'd his Message, and prepar'd them; then we march'd on in Form and Order: When we came into their little Village, I found the Mat spread for me to sit down upon, and all of them, Men, Women, and Children crawling upon their Hands and Knees to lick my Feet. My own People acted their Parts exactly, shew∣ing me the same Honour as was due to the Person I represented; for I was no sooner sat down, than one ran to fetch Water, while another brought a Callabash to receive it, and held for a third, who wash'd my Feet. I order'd my chief Man (who was in Reality my Governor) to procure a House for me; there were but five in the Place besides a few Huts for their Children. He pitch'd on one
<PB N="198" REF="217"/>
of the best, and left the Owner to shift for himself.</P>
<P>THEY stood in Admiration, having never seen any One command with such Authority in their Lives. The Chief call'd the rest to him, and consulted what Present was proper to make suitable to my Dignity. Some of them return'd in a short Time, bringing several Gallons of <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn, and more of Carra∣vances; but the old Man did not come him∣self till near Evening, when he brought four Men loaded; two with as much Honey as they could well carry, and two with as much Carravances; which were plac'd before me. The old Man sat down at a Distance, and surpriz'd with Awe, in a trembling Tone told me, <Q>“He hop'd I would accept his small Present; that he had no more to command on this short Notice.”</Q> I pity'd the poor Wretch, and chear'd him up, telling him, <Q>“”I was well pleas'd; that this was sufficient, and more than I expected from him;</Q> defiring him to sit, and bear me Company, while my People went to some of his Neighbours; for I sent them out some one Way, and some another, to get what they could: And what∣ever the People could spare, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> particularly order'd, they should bring themselves, and taste it; lest it should be damag'd by the Charms of the <HI>Ʋmossee.</HI> The old Man reco∣ver'd
<PB N="199" REF="218"/>
his Spirits in Time, and began to talk very freely; saying, <Q>“It was no Wonder, that my Father and Brethren rul'd over them; for God and the <HI>Daemons</HI> had made a Distinction in us from other Men: And if I had, <HI>says he,</HI> met you in a Wood alone, I should have fallen down, and paid my Duty to you; for surely, the <HI>Varzachars</HI> (or White-men) cannot be whiter than this young Prince is.”</Q> Thus he run on, describing all my Features, and praising me in his Manner; for his Tongue was set on running, and I could not tell what to say to him, nor when he would stop; but as Luck would have it, a sharp Man of my Retinue came in, and in a drolling Manner answer'd him, saying, <Q>“”I don't wonder, old Father, that you are surpris'd at the different Co∣lour, excellent Features, and Make of the Prince; but you must consider, my good old Man, that God has not made us equal; but he is pleas'd to distinguish those whom he designs for the Government of Man∣kind, by making them in such particular Form and Colour, that no Man can be ig∣norant of their Superiority: For if all were of the same Shape and Colour, People would choose one from among themselves, whom they thought most wise and valiant, to be their Lord, King, and Commander; and
<PB N="200" REF="219"/>
if they did not like him, perhaps, they would go from him, and live under ano∣ther, or choose another from amongst them∣selves; but if God has made any particu∣lar Man, or Family for Princes, and has ordain'd that they shall be Lords and Ma∣sters of all Mankind, You may be sure he has made them more excellent for Beauty, and has given them such Marks, as every Man who sees them must know them by; and immediately fall down, and acknowledge their divine Right, Authority, and Power over them. Ay, ay, <HI>says the old Man,</HI> it is true, as you say; for I remember my Father went once in two or three Years, to carry Honey to <HI>Deaan Mernindgarevo,</HI> who was <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Father; and, <HI>they say,</HI> he was of a Copper Colour; but his Hair was black like ours. Yes, <HI>says the other,</HI> he was a little different, and not much; but <HI>Deaan Mungaz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ungarevo,</HI> which was this Prince's Father, marry'd a Woman from <HI>Port Dauphine;</HI> and it is said, she was a white Man's Daughter. Yes, yes, <HI>says the old Man,</HI> there's something in that, in∣deed; but I don't understand these Marks you mention of God's making in Princes. Pray, are all Princes of his fine Colour and Make▪ And has God mark'd them all for Kings? I can't say, <HI>says the other,</HI> but this
<PB N="201" REF="220"/>
is the whitest.</Q>—In the Interim, as I began to be tyr'd with the Dialogue, came some of the People, who were sent for, bring∣ing their Presents, and licking my Feet; and so broke off the Discourse.</P>
<P>I found that my People had roguishly plot∣ted this Drollery amongst themselves to de∣ceive these poor Peasants, and carry'd it on with admirable Ingenuity and Success; for as they told me, one of these last ask'd how he should know who to pay his Respects to? and was roundly answer'd, <Q>“Do you think God has not distinguish'd Princes from o∣ther Men; you will soon know him by his excellent Colour and Form.”</Q> But I doubt, I have tyr'd my Reader with the long Tale of this Farce: In short, we got well by it; we had design'd to have proceeded further into the Country; but were so well provided with all we wanted, that we had no Occasion for any more; every Man having as much as he could carry: So the next Day they made up their <HI>Enters,</HI> all except myself, who kept my State. When we came home, we di∣vided it according to Agreement; and after I had sent Presents to my Neighbours, I had enough for, two or three Months.</P>
<P>THIS was too happy a Life, for my adverse Fate to suffer me to continue long in: For before a Year came about, I was order'd home
<PB N="202" REF="221"/>
again with my Cattle; three Men being sent by <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> to conduct me. The Civil War had now been a Year and half, which reduc'd every On<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to great Straits; so that they wanted these Catrle to live on, the rest being consum'd by themselves, or taken by the Enemy; their Enemies also being in as bad Circumstances, or worse. We return'd the same Way I came, thorow the Forests of wild Cattle, and hunted as we went, till we arriv'd at <HI>Deaan Afferer</HI>'s Town on <HI>Yong-gorvo.</HI> I was very melancholy all the Way, and here began first to think of making my Escape to some Sea-Port Town at the Hazard of my Life; tho' it was a long Time before I had an Opportunity to effect it. When I arriv'd at <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI>'s Town, where my Master and his People still liv'd, I found none but dull Countenances, yet they were glad at my safe Arrival, being hereby richer than their Neigh∣bours, whether Friends or Enemies; for my Cattle were increas'd. They thank'd me for my Care, which was all the Pay I got, and my Master was too surly to do that; but my butchering Office brought me the usual Fees; by which Means I liv'd as well as others.</P>
<P>MY Business was still to follow the Cow-Tail for the whole Town, no Body being willing to trust their Children, or Servants;
<PB N="203" REF="222"/>
and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> durst not peremptorily command, even his own young Slaves, to any Thing which might hazard their being taken by the Enemy; lest their Parents and Friends should resent it, and leave him to▪ go, and live under other Lords. As for their white Slave, he had no Parents, nor Relations, to lament his Loss, if kill'd, or taken; and, therefore, the only fit Person to be expos'd to Dan∣ger.</P>
<P>THE War was not carried on so hotly as at first, for their Courage was cool'd on all Sides; nor was there so much to be got by plundering one another, as at the Beginning; but it was not long before our original Ene∣mies, <HI>Chahary</HI> and <HI>Frukey,</HI> heard we had Cat∣tle, and one Day, as I was tending them at some Distance from the Town, they came with two hundred Men, surpris'd, and took the Cattle, and pursu'd me in a most furious Man∣ner with a savage yelling, firing, and throw∣ing Lances, calling out, <HI>Kill him, cut him to pieces,</HI> &amp;c. but I got the Start of them, and fled into a Thicket so full of Prickles and strong great Thorns, that my Flesh was mi∣serably torn from Head to Foot; neverthe∣less I hid myself in the Midst of it: They still follow'd me with their bruitish Cries, be∣ginning to cut a Passage to come at me; but just as I had giv'n up myself for lost, of a
<PB N="204" REF="223"/>
sudden I observ'd them run as fast back a∣gain. I was some Time before I could under∣stand the Meaning, till at length I found our People had heard the Uproar, and came up∣on them: So that they had now as much as they could do to save their own Lives. They could not drive off the Beasts, but resolving to do all the Mischief they could, they kill'd and wounded every one of them, and then fled. I was forc'd to keep my Station, and was not without Fear some of them would be driven upon me; till I perceiv'd by the Noise of the Guns, that they went further off; I then crept out, and found one of their chief Men fallen, and wounded, with two Lan∣ces in his Hand. He look'd me full in the Face with his Eyes dazling, and was going to speak, when I snatch'd one of his Lances out of his Hand, telling him, it was my Time now, and he was doubly my Enemy, and im∣mediately struck him dead. When our People saw me, they thought, I was cut with Lan∣ces; for I was all over bloody, and had se∣veral large Rents in my Flesh, my Feet al∣most cut to Pieces, and many large Thorns yet sticking in me: So that when I came to recover from the Fright, and to be cool, I was in great Pain. The Women and Chil∣dren soon came to help carry the slain Cat∣tle into Town; there not being above fif∣teen
<PB N="205" REF="224"/>
alive, and those sorely wounded. While these were busy with the Beasts, I told <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> that I took two Lances from a Man, who was grievously wounded; but alive at the Side of the Thicket. I durst not tell them I kill'd him, for he had near Relations among our People, and I did not know, but they might privately revenge his Death on me; for they griev'd at it, and begg'd his Body to bury; which was granted.</P>
<P>WHEN I came Home, my Mistress very compassionately order'd, and assisted a Slave to wash, and dress my Wounds, and pull out the Thorns. It was many Days before I was well, and I was not a little glad, I had no more Cattle to look after; notwithstanding the Want, which, I knew, must immediately follow. However, for a few Days we had Beef enough, and more than we could well dispence with, while it was sweet.</P>
<P>BY that Time I was got well, my Master found another Employment for me, which was to go into the Woods to dig wild Yams for him, and his Wife; the Beef was now consum'd, and there was scarce any Thing else to be found hereabouts to live on, and now we severely felt the Miseries of a Civil War. I went a great Way sometimes, before I could find enow of these for my Master and self, being seldom able to bring home sufficient to
<PB N="206" REF="225"/>
serve me for a Breakfast the next Day; it be∣ing as much as I could do, with a whole Day's Search and Labour, to please my Master. In∣deed, I always made sure of one Meal, kin∣dling a Fire, and roasting some in the Woods.</P>
<P>ONE Morning just at Sun-rising (for I have Reason to remember it) my Master, and some of the Chiefs were sitting in the Gate of the Town, and reflecting on their Poverty and Mis∣fortunes, <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> said he had tasted no Beef a great While, and ask'd if they knew of any Body who had Cattle. They told him none of his, or <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI>'s People; but there was a Man in <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI>'s Juris∣diction, about four or five Miles off, who had some good Beeves. He immediately calls a Man, and me, near to him, and told us, we must go, and bring away privately one of those Beasts, bidding us to choose a fat One. I began to make Excuses, and said, <Q>“I was af∣fraid to go, and steal other Mens Cattle▪ Besides, <HI>says I,</HI> I am the only white Man in all this Country, and if I should be seen at a Distance, they will know me to be your Slave, and that you sent me.”</Q> He reso∣lutely told me, <Q>“It was his Pleasure I should go;”</Q> and order'd the Man to go immedi∣ately, and provide a Rope. I begg'd on my Knees that he would send another, but in vain; however, as he turn'd away, speaking to other
<PB N="207" REF="226"/>
People, and I, at the same Time, seeing some of my Fellow-Slaves going towards the Woods, stole away, thinking when he did not see me, he would appoint another in my Room; but he turn'd suddenly, and espying me going off, took up his Gun, and fir'd at me; the Shot went thorow the Straw Cap I had on, and I was so near, that the Wadding hit my Back. He, perceiving he had not kill'd me, took up two Lances, and before the People could stop his Hand, he threw one at me. He rav'd, and call'd me an hundred vile Names; as for swear∣ing, they know nothing of it: At length he was pacify'd, and on my Submission, and the Intreaty of his Friends, he forgave me; but insisted on my going. There being no Reme∣dy, I proceeded on the Design with the Man, tho' with many Lamentations at my hard For∣tune, and wretched Slavery.</P>
<P>WE soon came near the Place we were di∣rected to, and after a little wandering about, we espy'd near half a Score Cows grazing; our next Business was to look about diligently, to see if the Cow-keeper was near them; for my Part, I was never in more Fear in my Life scarce, the Noise of the pretty little Li∣zards, who play about in the Sun-shine, and make the Leaves rustle, appear'd then in my Ears like the leaping out of Men from an Am∣buscade; but after listening, and going round
<PB N="208" REF="227"/>
every Way for a considerable Time, we, at length, ventur'd to sally out from among the Trees, and pitching upon one of the fattest; my Comrade took the Rope, which was till then twisted about his Middle, and slung her: We had much ado to get her away from her Companions, but at last we conquer'd her, and drove her thorow the Woods, for we durst not go near any Paths, or open Places, and by Noon arriv'd fafe at Home; where she was, in a few Minutes, cut up by above a dozen Hands at one, for Fear the Owner should miss her, and follow the Track. The Meat was divided into two hundred Pieces, and distributed to as many People. My Part∣ner and I had an Udder, and a Piece of the Buttock, which is the usual Fee to those who bring in a Beast on this Manner, or from an Enemy: As almost every One in the Town had a little, this was all eat immediately; and the next Day we were in the same Case as before.</P>
<P>IT was now Winter, and the Yams could not so easily be found, the Stalks being so wither'd; that we were reduc'd to miserable Want, and almost famish'd: If we could eat once a Day, it was luxurious Living; inso∣much that when the Children cry'd for Food, tho' they had none all Day, their Mothers could with Authority snap short at them; and
<PB N="209" REF="228"/>
say, <HI>Would ye be Gluttons? Did ye not eat Yes∣terday?</HI> These shocking, and pitiful Dialogues between the hungry Infants and their wretched Mothers, I heard for some Months, and our calamitous Circumstances appear'd in our mea∣gre and ghastly Countenances. Here was no Fighting, and Plundering now; our Enemies never troubl'd us, nor we them: Thus we liv'd for eight, or nine Months, after the Loss of our Cattle. Our Enemies were somewhat more miserable than we, because <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack,</HI> and his Brother, who liv'd on the other Side, often disturb'd their Rest, and de∣priv'd them of the only Happiness of wretched Poverty; which is▪ to sleep away for one half of their Time, the acute Sense of their Mi∣sery.</P>
<P>WHILE <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> and every Body else wish'd for Peace, but could find no Expedi∣ent to bring it about; and <HI>Deaan Murnan∣zack</HI>'s Success had made them despair of it with Honour; Providence threw an Accident in the Way, which effected it. <HI>Rer Vovvern,</HI> King of <HI>Feraingher,</HI> which is St. <HI>Augustine Bay</HI> Coun∣try, had declar'd War against our common Enemy <HI>Woozington;</HI> and had sent an Ambas∣sador, whose Name was <HI>Ry-Nanno,</HI> an able, and experienc'd Person in the Knowledge of Mankind, whose Errand was to reconcile the quarrelling Lords of <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> and obtain
<PB N="210" REF="229"/>
their Friendship and Assistance in the com∣mon Cause. He no soonet arriv'd at <HI>Fenno∣arevo,</HI> but the joyful News flew about the Country, and reach'd our Ears; <HI>Deaan Crin∣do</HI> made no Scruple of admitting <HI>Ry-Nanno,</HI> to make the first Overtures from him to his Nephew <HI>Murnanzack;</HI> whither the Ambassa∣dor was then gone when we heard it.</P>
<P>IT was with some Reluctancy, that this Prince listen'd to Peace; for his Uncle's Be∣haviour, and that of his Sons was so inhu∣man and savage, in destroying the Cattle of Relations and Country-men, rooting up the Plantations, and other gross Inhumanites; that he almost forgot his private Wrongs, and look'd on <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> as the general Enemy of Mankind; who, to gratify his bru∣tish Passion, endeavour'd to bring about irre∣parable Desolation and universal Destruction; notwithstanding the Examples he himself had shewn at the first breaking out of the Quar∣rels: With what admirable Generosity did he treat both <HI>Crindo</HI> and <HI>Mundumber,</HI> their Peo∣ple, Towns, and Effects? plainly shewing that he aim'd at nothing, but doing himself Justice, and deciding a Controversy; and that the mur∣dering of Men, and ruining of Countries were abominable: Aad as <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> told me, it was his Piety at last determin'd him to a Recon∣ciliation; for he thought God could never
<PB N="211" REF="230"/>
look favourably on a Man, who would re∣fuse to relieve Mankind from such Miseries, as his Country-men then suffer'd; and This only mov'd him, in the Height of Success, to wave the Prosecution of his own Interest, when it stood in Competition with the pub∣lick Good. These were the pious Resolu∣tions of this great Man, notwithstanding the Laugh he made of Reveal'd Religion; or, at least, of my Manner of attempting to teach it him. I wish, that our Christian Priests, who build so much on a more than ordi∣nary Knowledge of God's Will, would make their Lives Examples, as his was; and teach Princes, and others too, to be in Reality so truly just, honourable, and good as this gal∣lant black Prince was in all his Actions; and yet I question not, but he must be call'd an illiterate Heathen.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> had finish'd his Negotia∣tion with <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> he pass'd by <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> well knowing he would acquiesce with what his Brother had done; and came to us, to make up the Difference between <HI>Chahary</HI> and <HI>Frukey</HI> our Enemies, and Us. He con∣demn'd them very boldly for their Folly, in persisting so obstinately on their private Re∣sentments to the Ruin of themselves, and their Country; and told them, it was repre∣sented in a scandalous Manner to all the Kings
<PB N="212" REF="231"/>
on the Island. He met with no great Difficul∣ty in the Reconciliation, which being effected, he told them, that <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> had a Quarrel against <HI>Woozington,</HI> for several gross Affronts and Insults: Among the rest, he had call'd a Dog by the Name <HI>Rer Vovvern;</HI> and he, <HI>Ry-Nanno,</HI> expected next Summer to come, and beg their Assistance against <HI>Woozington;</HI> but his Errand was then principally out of Friend∣ship, to put an End to their destructive Quar∣rels. This he did effectually, in a few Days the Peace was concluded, and declar'd pub∣lickly all over the Country.</P>
<P>WHILE <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> was delivering his first Speech to <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mevar∣row,</HI> I observ'd him to fix his Eye upon me, and when he had done, he look'd at me with Concern in his Face; and calling to me in broken English, <HI>You, white Man, come hither▪</HI> He ask'd me my Name, then turning to my Master, said, <Q>“”Here's a white Bird among Crows, in our Country they are common, Ships coming there frequently; but they wear Cloaths, eat, and drink with the Lords▪ This poor young Man looks piteously, why do you let him go without Cloaths? Pray be charitable to a distressed Stranger, and don't use him cruelly.</Q> <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> an∣swer'd, <Q>“I have not us'd him cruelly enough, you don't know how his Friends serv'd
<PB N="213" REF="232"/>
<HI>Deaan Crindo.</HI> Yes, says <HI>Ry-Nanno,</HI> I know perfectly well the whole Story; and that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> us'd them barbarously, in re∣fusing to let them go on their Request to a Sea-port, where Ships come, in Order to return Home. If <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> had this white Man, he would give him some Cloaths, which his Country-men have left behind, and take Care of him as of his own Son, till a Ship comes to carry him away.”</Q></P>
<P>I could not forbear listning to this Dis∣course with the greatest Attention, and wanted an Opportunity to talk privately with him, which I did at Night; for he brought some Cattle, which <HI>Murnanzack</HI> had giv'n him, know∣ing we had none; and I was sent for to kill a Bullock. By this Means I had an Opportunity to tell him in broken English, <HI>That I would come, and see him at Night.</HI> Accordingly I went, and he receiv'd me with great Civility: After we were sat, he enquir'd into the whole History of our Shipwreck and Misfortune. I gave him a full Account thereof, as also of my Master's cruel Usage, and my miserable Slavery. The Relation of my wretched Case made me weep, and drew Tears from his Eyes. He told me, he would endeavour to buy me of <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow,</HI> and comforted me as well as he could. I stay'd late with him, and when I went Home, the Hopes I entertain'd of his relieving me,
<PB N="214" REF="233"/>
kept me waking all Night. The next Day, after he had talk'd with my Master of their own Affairs, he ask'd him, if he was willing to sell his white Man, and he would give him a handsome young Man, capable of doing him more Service, or a Buccaneer Gun; which he pleas'd.</P>
<P>I was sitting among my Fellow-Slaves, ea∣gerly regarding what the Result would be, when my Master call'd to me to stand up; I began to hope, it was to make the Bargain. Instead of that, <HI>says he,</HI> <Q>“Look on that white Slave; for looking after Cattle, digging of wild Yams, and improving of Honey, there is not the Fellow of him; and tho' a Buc∣caneer Gun is the Price of a Slave, I will not take two for him.”</Q> <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> then shew'd him three or four Slaves, but <HI>Mevar∣row</HI> told him plainly, he would not part with me on any Conditions. Then turning to me, ask'd, <Q>“If I had not a Mind to dig some wild Yams for him, as well as his other Slaves, who were just gone out before?”</Q> So I was forc'd to take up my Hatchet, Shovel, and Lance, and go into the Woods; but in∣stead of searching for Yams, I sat down, and cry'd till I was almost blind. However, I was oblig'd to find some to carry Home, which was difficult enough, for the Stalks were now wither'd; yet I made up a Bundle after roast∣ing
<PB N="215" REF="234"/>
them, but had none for myself. When I came Home, my Master thought I had been idle, and said, <Q>“I suppose, you are mightily troubl'd, because <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> is not your Ma∣ster.”</Q> I went Home, and laid me down on my Mat, and had a Log of Wood under my Head for my Pillow, till a great While after it was dark; and then I went privately to <HI>Ry-Nanno.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER I sat down as usual, he told me, he was glad to see me again; and ask'd what Success I had, which I told him; as also that my Master had greatly abus'd me for bringing no more Yams. He said, <Q>“I was the first white Man he ever saw, who had a black Man for his Master; and tho' he could not buy me, yet he did not doubt, but <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> would find some Way to get me into <HI>Feraingher;</HI> when he came next Sum∣mer toward this Country." But I answer'd, I was afraid my Master would not take me to the Wars for that Reason, and I de∣spair'd of ever getting my Liberty; but that I was resolv'd to try as soon as my Master went out any where to the Wars, and left me behind.”</Q> <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> comforted me, and said, <Q>“The same Providence which had preserv'd me hitherto would deliver me in the End, and he did not doubt of seeing me at St. <HI>Augustine Bay;</HI> for, <HI>says he,</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="235"/>
there are but few Ships come now to <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> since the Death of <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro:</HI> That, indeed, is the nearest Sea-port, for ours is a great Way off.”</Q> I desir'd, he would please to tell me, how many Days Journey it was, and which Way he came: <Q>“For, <HI>said I,</HI> I am resolv'd to attempt my Escape; if they overtake me, I shall be kill'd, and be out of my Misery; and if I fall into any other Master's Power, he can't be worse than this.”</Q> <HI>Ry-Nunno</HI> told me, that the whole Country of <HI>Merfaughta</HI> lay between us, extending itself from the ut∣most Part of <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> where <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack</HI>'s Cattle are kept, to the River, which runs into St. <HI>Augustine Bay,</HI> which River is call'd <HI>Oneghayloghe;</HI> that he was forty two Days on his Journey, but he could have perform'd it in less than half the Time, if they had not hunted, and took their Pleasure by the Way: <Q>“For, <HI>says he,</HI> the whole Country is so well provided with what is proper for a Man to live on, that One need not carry Pro∣vision, except he is in Haste: There are wild Cattle in great Part of it; then there is <HI>Faungidge, Verlaway,</HI> wild Honey and wild Yams; some, or other of them, or all of them to be had wherever you go.”</Q> I in∣quir'd what Kings liv'd in the Way? He said None; for there were three. <HI>Rer Trortrock</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="236"/>
is the first to the Northward, then <HI>Rer Chulu-Mossu-Andro</HI> and <HI>Zaffentumppoey;</HI> this last at the Head of the River <HI>Oneghayloghe,</HI> to the Eastward; but there are none of their Peo∣ple live within almost two long Days Jour∣ney of the Road. He told me, the nearest Way was by the Foot of <HI>Yong-gorvo</HI> Hills, till One comes to the West-side of it; then strike over to the North-ward half a Day's Journey, if then I went betwixt the North and West, I cou'd not miss the Way. I ask'd him a great many Questions more till it was late, and was going away; but he would not suffer me till I had supp'd with him. The next Day he took his Leave of my Master, and I stole away to bid him Farewel, and thank him for his Civility. They were packing up his Pro∣vision, &amp;c. He advis'd me to oblige <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> in every Thing, lest he should kill me, or do me a Mischief; and bid me not despair of getting Home to <HI>England.</HI> He then gave me a large Piece of Beef, and after re∣peated Expressions of my Gratitude for his charitable Concern for me, I parted from him with much Regret. When I consider'd on what had pass'd, I began to have quite diffe∣rent Thoughts, as if I had been in another Country; for I found here were a great many People, and Nations too, who understood Hu∣manity; but it was my Misfortune to hap∣pen
<PB N="218" REF="237"/>
among the worst People of the whole Island.</P>
<P>THE next Day the Cryer went about the Town, ordering all <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s Slaves to muster before his Door. I went among the rest to know his Will and Pleasure, which was to get ready to pack up our Goods, and march the next Morning to our own Town; which was accordingly done by every Body with Pleasure except me, who was indifferent where I liv'd: So after Leave taken of <HI>Rer Mimebolambo,</HI> and his People, we march'd Home, and found our Houses very little worse than when we left them; for they were then new-built. The next Command was to attend, and receive Axes and Hoes to pre∣pare the Ground for planting. Some clear'd it of the Wood and Briars, while others ho'd it up instead of Plowing: Our Master sent to his Uncle <HI>Mephontey</HI> for <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn and Carravances, which were soon sow'd; and then gave his Slaves a Fortnight's Time to make their own Plantations. I was forc'd to desire <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> to beg my Master to give me two Days more to look after my Honey; which I had left secur'd from Thieves by the white Sticks, on Pretence of being poison'd by the Charm of the <HI>Ʋmossee.</HI> He gave me Leave, and I took three large Tubs, each of which held five or six Gallons, and as many
<PB N="219" REF="238"/>
Callabashes. I had further to go than from our old Town, which was burnt; but when I came there, I found them as I left them, untouch'd; and the Honey prodigiously en∣creas'd. I smoak'd the Bees out, and took the greatest Part of the Honey and Wax away, but not all, leaving them some to live on; for they will return to the Hives themselves, and when they swarm, go to new Ones with∣out any of that Trouble we have in <HI>England.</HI> I found some fine <HI>Virginia</HI> Honey with white Wax, which I put in my Callabashes: It being two Years since I had seen them, I had almost forgot where to look for some of them; for they were at a great Distance from one ano∣ther, up and down in the Wood. However, I fill'd all my Vessels, and left as much more behind for another Journey. I had more now than I could carry Home at once, so that I was oblig'd to return the next Day for it. When I had brought it Home, I went to my Ma∣ster, and presented him with one of the Tubs: Now these Lords always expect a Present on such Occasions. When my Master saw me bring such a large Tub-ful, he was surpris'd; and ask'd me, <HI>Why I brought him so much?</HI> For I must do him the Justice to say he was not covetous.</P>
<P>BESIDES, Here are no Officers to go about, and demand any certain Quantity; but the
<PB N="220" REF="239"/>
People must go themselves, and carry a Pre∣sent of whatever their Plantations and Indu∣stry produce; as Carravances, <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn, Potatoes, &amp;c. but it is only as an Acknow∣ledgment of Homage; and a Callabash would have been sufficient for me: But I told him, I knew he had a Circumcision-Feast to make, and I had a great deal, and so desir'd him to accept it. He told me, it was true; and for that Use he would buy all the Honey I had to spare, and give me a Cow and a Calf for it as soon as he had some Cattle.</P>
<P>THE Civil War being over, we liv'd at Ease, could dig our wild Yams without Fear: People now went to and fro in the Country to visit one another, and every Body attended their Plantations; but it was six Months after this before we had Plenty. My Conversation with <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> was still for ever in my Mind, and I wanted only an Opportunty of my Ma∣ster's going abroad on some Expedition, to execute my Resolution of endeavouring to es∣cape. Nothing happen'd all this While, but there was one <HI>Rer Ambarroch,</HI> a petty Prince, to the Northward, who, a little before the Civil War began, had receiv'd, and detain'd eight Slaves of <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s, and thirty Head of his Cattle; and when the <HI>Deaan</HI> sent a special Messenger to demand them, he re∣turn'd for Answer, <HI>That he might come himself,</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="240"/>
<HI>and feteh them.</HI> He being now at Leisure, <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> and he agreed to join their For∣ces, and having obtain'd Leave of <HI>Deaan Crin∣do,</HI> they prepar'd to march. I expected to be left behind with my usual Charge of his Wife, and thought it would be a proper Opportunity for my Design; but standing before him with two Lances in my Hand, says he, <Q>“You shall not always live at Home like a Woman, you shall go to the Wars with me; the Sight of a white Man arm'd will fright those People in the Mountains where we are go∣ing:”</Q> So taking my two Lances away, <Q>“Here, <HI>says he,</HI> is one of your Grand-father's Arms, I suppose, you can manage this bet∣ter than ours; prepare yourself for the March.”</Q> I desir'd one of my Lances, which he gave me, and twenty Musket-Balls, some Powder, and two Flints. I took my Mat as usual, but my Master gave it to one of his Slaves to carry for me; so I walk'd like a Gentleman without any Luggage.</P>
<P>OUR little Army consisted of about three hundred Men besides Slaves: We went to the Northward all the first Day, the second Day we got into the Forest to the East of <HI>Yong∣gorvo,</HI> where the wild Cattle are, we hunted, and kill'd some Beef, while four Men were sent out as Spies toward <HI>Rer Ambarroch</HI>'s Town, to see how it was fortify'd. We were almost
<PB N="222" REF="241"/>
a Day's Journey from it; for it was not pro∣per to go nearer, lest some of their People should have discover'd us hunting, and alarm'd the Town; for they live chiefly on wild Cat∣tle. Our Spies return'd, and brought Word that it was an open Place without any Fortifi∣cation. We march'd all Night, and by Break of Day arriv'd at the Town, divided ourselves to surround it, and fir'd into their Houses to rouse them; the Barking of the Dogs and the Noise of the Guns soon awaken'd them, and away they run; for we gave them no Time to muster together: So we fell to plundering, and taking what Prisoners we could get; I saw the Prince's House, and ran directly toward it, hoping to take him Prisoner; he jump'd out, and fir'd at me, I was going to return it, when a Man threw a Lance at me, which I put off, and fir'd at him, and stopp'd his Run∣ning; but by this Means the Prince got off.</P>
<P>I enter'd the House, and found his Wife and Daughter sitting with two or three Slaves: I took hold of the Ladies Hands, and brought them both out, and let other People go in, and plunder the House as they pleas'd, for I had a good Prize; but one of <HI>Rer Mimebo∣lambo</HI>'s Men, who had taking Nothing, would have took one of my Captives from me: I told him, I suppos'd he was a Coward, and had sneak'd behind a Tree in the Action, or
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="242"/>
<P>P. 222</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="223" REF="243"/>
else he might have taken something or other. He insisted on it, and reproach'd me with be∣ing a Slave, till some of our People came up, when he was sorc'd to depart with Shame; for a Complaint was made to <HI>Deaan Mevar∣row,</HI> who justify'd me, and severely repri∣manded the Man. Now an Agreement was made before we set out, that the Cattle should be divided; but Captives should remain to those who took them. When we had drove all the Men away, we got what Cattle we could find together, and hasten'd thorow the Wood with them, expecting that the Enemy would rally and attack us. When we got in∣to the Plain, we halted, and made ready to receive them; they soon came according to Expectation, as I suppose, about two hun∣dred.</P>
<P>I deliver'd my two Captives, as did every One else theirs to the Slaves in the Rear, while we march'd; and coming very near them, they also meeting us, we made a Dis∣charge almost all at once, and kill'd them three or four Men. We halted a little to load again, and observ'd them stand amaz'd and daunted, looking more particularly on some one remarkable Person, who was fall'n; I being soon loaded, and a few more ran di∣rectly to them; they seeing us come so near, which is not usual, fir'd at us, and ran away:
<PB N="224" REF="244"/>
We follow'd them till they got into the Wood, and then return'd to the main Army. They came out of the Wood again on our Retreat, and follow'd us at a Distance, being willing to see the last of their Wives, Children and Cattle; and to observe us, if any Accident should happen, which might give them an Advantage to recover them, or any Part of them.</P>
<P>AT Noon we halted near a Spring, in a shady Grove, to refresh ourselves; for we were fasting. My Master being seated, call'd to me to bring my two Captives before him; and having commended me for my Behavi∣our in the Action, he told me, I should keep one of them myself; and desir'd I would make my Choice, and he would have the other. I soon determin'd for the young One, being in Truth, extremely pleas'd with her from the very Moment I took her. She was about six∣teen Years of Age, her Mother was not a∣bove four, or five and thirty; She I presented to my Master. My Choice also pleas'd him, for he had a Mind to do a generous Action; so calling her to him, he told her, <Q>“Her Husband had brought all this upon him∣self by his unjust and churlish Proceedings, and I have done no more than he bid me; I am come myself, and have fetch'd away all my Women; and I perceive some of my
<PB N="225" REF="245"/>
own Cattle, with enough of his, to pay me and my Friends for our Trouble; as for yourself, I will give you your Liberty; go back to <HI>Rer Amborroch,</HI> and tell him, If he would have his Daughter and Cattle again, he must come, and fetch them; you see she is fallen into my white Man's Hands, and I will not take her from him. And, <HI>says I,</HI> he shall spill all the white Man's Blood before he shall have her again.”</Q> Af∣ter she had eaten some Meat, which <HI>Mevarrow</HI> gave her, she came to me to take Leave of her Daughter. They both cry'd, not expect∣ing ever to see each other again; I pity'd them heartily, and should have dismis'd the young One; but to confess the Truth, I was downright in Love with her, having never be∣fore seen any Woman I lik'd so well; tho' I had been here so many Years. However I com∣forted the Mother as well as I could, and told her, <Q>“Not to lament too much for her Daugh∣ter, she should live very well; I would take more Care of her than of myself, and tho' I was not a black Man, I had as tender a Heart as any black Man whatever, and de∣sign'd to make her my Wife, if she lik'd it: If not, <HI>I said,</HI> I did not know whether she would live so easy a Life.”</Q> Her Mother ask'd her, "What she thought of that? <HI>She answer'd,</HI> <Q>“She was at my Disposal, and not at
<PB N="226" REF="246"/>
her own; and desir'd her Duty might be presented to her Father: And mine too, if you please, Mother, <HI>said I.”</HI></Q> So after a little more Discourse they parted. She took her Leave of <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> thanking him for his Civility, and went away by herself: But I suppose, she had not far to go alone; they were, no doubt, as near as they durst come, in the Woods, observing us, tho' we ne∣ver saw them any more; yet we kept a strict Guard all Day, and the next Night. I was very careful of my pretty Prisoner, tying a Rope about her Middle, with the Ends about myself, and laid her close to me, holding her fast also in my Arms; she only laugh'd, and jested with me for it, but I was so fear∣ful of her getting away, that I could not sleep. We march'd very swiftly the next Day, and when we halted, <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> parted the Cattle, each had two hundred and eleven; and then they separated, taking the nearest Way home.</P>
<P>JUST before we enter'd the Town, we halted again to divide the Cattle among ourselves; the <HI>Deaan</HI> had thirty, his Brother ten, each of the other Principals one; whosoever had two Slaves retain'd one of them, and deli∣ver'd the other to their Lord, and had a Cow and Calf instead of it: If two Men got a Slave between them, they had each a Cow for it;
<PB N="227" REF="247"/>
every Man, who had not a Slave, was to have a Cow, if the Number would admit of it; if not, one between two. And this is a gene∣ral, and fixed Law for dividing an Enemies Spoil.</P>
<P>MY Master told me I had but one Slave, I alledg'd he had taken one away, and might have kept it; but I found he was only in Jest: For he gave me a Cow and a Calf for her whom he sent away, and would have had me pick'd out another Cow and Calf for my Honey, which I refus'd; so he chose them for me himself of the best of the Cattle. Thus I became rich at once, having two Cows and their Calves, and an handsome <HI>Zorzer Ampeller.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we came near the Gates of the Town the Shells were blown, and the Women came all running to see what was the Meaning of it, not expecting us so soon; but when they knew us, they ran back to their Houses till we enter'd in Triumph, and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> was seated; then his Wife came out, and lick'd his Feet, and after her the rest of the Women, and then each to her respective Husband. I thought I had now a Wife, and as fine a One too as the best of them, and the next Time we return'd from such an Expedition, I should have Homage done me. My Mistress sent, and desir'd to see my Lady, I went along with her; She would have her set down on the same Mat with herself,
<PB N="228" REF="248"/>
and could not forbear shedding Tears, it hav∣ing been her own Case, and charg'd me to use her tenderly. I said, I did not design to make a Slave of her, but a <HI>Valle,</HI> or Wife.</P>
<P>I had a Stock of Honey, which I left with a Neighbour, as also Carravances; and having Milk from my Cows, I made a very tolerable Supper for my Bride, and myself; and was for∣mal enough to mimick Matrimony as far as I could, by taking her by the Hand, and saying, <HI>I was willing to make her a tender, and faith∣ful Husband;</HI> and ask'd her, <HI>If she was willing to be a faithful, and loving Wife;</HI> to which she chearfully agreed: And so we lay down, and were as happy as our Circumstances would ad∣mit of; notwithstanding we had no Bride-Men and Maids, nor Throwing of Stockings.</P>
<P>SOME of my Readers will, perhaps, wonder how I could so passionately love a black Wo∣man; but let them consider, I had been several Years in the Country, and they were become natural to me. Then She was very handsome, of a middle Stature, streight and exactly shap'd, her Features regular, and her Skin soft, fine, and delicate, as any Ladies in <HI>Europe.</HI> Indeed, all the Women are soft and fine skinn'd, who are of any Rank, and carefully brought up. There are uncleanly, course-skinn'd Creatures among the vulgar, as well as in <HI>Europe;</HI> but the Women are not naked as some of the <HI>Guinea</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="249"/>
Negroes. Their Cloathing is a Lamber much longer than the Mens, reaching to their Feet from their Middle; above it, and joining un∣der the Lamber, is a Garment like a streight Shift, covering all the Body to the Neck, and short Sleeves. This is commonly made of Cotton, and of a dark Colour; the Women of the better Sort adorn it with Beads very handsomely, especially on the Back; where they are rang'd in Rows, coming cross one a∣nother; and being of different Colours, they make a large double Cross, so like a Union-Flag, that One would imagine they copy'd it.</P>
<P>THUS much as to the Description of the Person and Habits of these Women; in which I will not pretend to prefer them to our <HI>Eu∣ropeans:</HI> And yet notwithstanding I have been so long in <HI>England,</HI> I can't help confessing, 'tis with Pleasure I think of mine; and with Con∣cern I remember our Parting: For as to their Fidelity, Behaviour to their Husbands, good∣natur'd Dispositions and agreeable Conversa∣tion, so far as their little Knowledge extends, I think the <HI>Europeans</HI> must not compare with them. We white People have a very con∣temptible, and mean Opinion of these Blacks; and a great One of ourselves. They also have a great Opinion of us, and think we excel them vastly in Knowledge, Arts and Sciences; so far they are right, but if an impartial Compa∣rison
<PB N="230" REF="250"/>
was to be made of their Virtue, I think, the Negroe Heathens will excel the white Chri∣stians. It will be remark'd, I dare say, that the best Character I could give myself to re∣commend me to my Wife's Mother was, <HI>That I had as tender an Heart as a Black;</HI> for they, certainly, treat one another with more Hu∣manity than we do. Here is no One mise∣rable, if it is in the Power of his Neighbours to help him; here is Love, Tenderness, and Gener<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sity, which might shame us; and Mo∣ral Honesty too: And this not only just in this one Country of <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> but all over the Island; even in other Places more than here▪ <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> may be alledg'd as an Excep∣tion to this Moral Honesty, for his stealing his Neighbours Cattle: This is true, but there will be bad Men in every Country; yet it must be observ'd, he did it against Consci∣ence, and was self-condemn'd; for he knew Justice as well as any One, witness his Pay∣ing me my Cow and Calf for my Honey; and many other Things. There is a wide Diffe∣rence between the Capacities and Virtues of some Men; it is not with Pleasure, that I men∣tion <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Name with <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow</HI>'s in the same Page; yet the peculiar Vices of the latter are not an Objection against the National Virtues of his Country.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="251"/>
MY Reader, I hope, will excuse this Digres∣sion, by remembring the only Pleasure I had to alleviate the Misery of my Slavery while in <HI>Anterndroea.</HI> I look'd after my Master's Cat∣tle as before, but then I had some of my own, and an agreeable Companion to go Home to, who took Care to dress my Victuals; and hav∣ing Plenty of Honey, I was never without Toak in the House, for my Wife and I to enjoy ourselves with, and entertain a Friend. So that I liv'd as well as any of my Neigh∣bours, and being now less fatigu'd than for∣merly, I was capable of taking more Notice than before, of the Religion and Laws of the Country: And as I am going to relate a Cir∣cumcision Feast, it will not be improper to give first an Account of the Religion, which is, indeed, but little.</P>
<P>THEY acknowledge, and adore the Only One Supreme God, whom they call <HI>Deaan Ʋnghor∣ray;</HI> which signifies the <HI>Lord Above:</HI> They say, there are four other Lords, each to his respective Quarter of the World, whose Names are <HI>Deaan Antemoor,</HI> or the Northern Lord; <HI>Deaan Meguddummateme,</HI> the Southern Lord; <HI>Deaan Androwfertraer,</HI> the Western; and <HI>Deaan Anabeleshey,</HI> the Eastern: This last, they say, is the Dispenser of Plagues, and Miseries to Mankind, by the Permission or Command of the Great God; the Others also are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tors
<PB N="232" REF="252"/>
of his Commands; but chiefly Dispensers of Benefits. These four they look on as Me∣diators between Men and the Great God; from whence they have a great Veneration for them, and recommend themselves to them in their Prayers and Sacrifices.</P>
<P>I have already giv'n some Account of the <HI>Om∣leys▪</HI> by which they seem to have the same No∣tion, as some superstitious People in <HI>Europe</HI> have formerly had of familiar Spirits; because they send them, as it were, on Messages with their Prayers to the Great God; and expect them to come after a Sacrifice, and tell in Dreams what they have to do; and also warn them of Dangers. This agrees pretty near to the No∣tion, which some Christians have had of Guar∣dian Angels; or some Philosophers of a good, and bad Genius; or rather is more exactly a∣greeable to a very ancient, and long-received Opinion of <HI>Daemons;</HI> and therefore, not hav∣ing any other Word so fit in our Language, I choose to distinguish them by that; for <HI>Owley</HI> is no more than the general Name of the Uten∣sil, or Altar; which is rather like a <HI>Talisma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or <HI>Sigil,</HI> to which the <HI>Daemon</HI> is suppos'd to be attach'd; and by which, as a proper <HI>Me∣dium,</HI> they will be invok'd: For there are al∣most as many different <HI>Daemons</HI> with proper Names, as there are People who have <HI>Owleys</HI> Some of which are, <HI>Ry-Leffu, Tompack-Offnarev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
<PB N="233" REF="253"/>
<HI>Lalla-petu, Deer-mesacker, Deer-hurzolavor, Ry∣mungary, Ry-ove.</HI> Then they also invoke the Spirits of their Fore-fathers, and have a great Veneration for them; calling upon them by Names giv'n after their Decease: Insomuch that they account it a Crime to mention them by the Names they had when living; and this Name is chiefly known by the Word <HI>Garevo</HI> at the End of it; as may be observ'd in the Names of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s and <HI>Deaan Murnan∣zack</HI>'s Fathers, when repeated by my Mock-Retinue among the Peasants.</P>
<P>THE Veneration they have for the Memory of their Fore-fathers, and the Assurance they have of their Spirits always existing, appears in every Circumstance of the few religious Du∣ties they perform: The Burial of the Dead is very singular, and solemn. I have often taken Notice of the great Humanity, with which, on all Occasions, they treat each other in all Calamities and Misfortunes; so also in Sick∣ness they frequently visit, and contribute all they can to the Help of the afflicted Family, and Restoration of the sick Person. At a De∣cease all the Relations and Neighbours come to the House, the Women lament, and the Men assist in the Preparations for the Funeral. The first Thing is to pitch upon a Tree for the Coffin; then a Cow, or an Ox is kill'd, and some of the Blood sprinkl'd on it; pray∣ing
<PB N="234" REF="254"/>
to their Fore-fathers, and the <HI>Daemons,</HI> and Demy Gods to assist them, and take Care that the Tree split not in falling, nor that any Man be hurt by cutting, or felling it. After the Tree is down, they cut it about a Foot longer than the Corps, and split it downright Length-ways; (for they always choose a Tree which they know will split so;) and dig both Parts hollow, making them like two Throughs. It is then fit to be carry'd to the House, the Corps being in the mean Time wash'd, and wrapp'd up in a Lamber, or perhaps, in two Lambers, and sow'd fast There is all this While Frankincense, or a Gum very like it, burning in the House. They seldom keep the Corps above one Day, especially in hot Wea∣ther. They put the Corps in the Troughs, closing them together, and carry it on six Mens Shoulders. Every Family has a peculiar Bury∣ing-place, which no other Person durst infringe upon, or break into; nor, indeed, does any Body attempt it. This is inclos'd, and fenc'd round with Sticks like Pallisadoes, when they come near the Place, the Corps is set down without it, and they proceed to the rest of the Ceremony; which is to make four Fires, one at each Corner on the Out-side of the Bu∣rying-place: On these Fires they burn the Ox or Cow, which was before kill'd on Purpose, dividing it into Quarters, and consuming it
<PB N="235" REF="255"/>
wholly with the Fire; then they sprinkle Frankincense on the Coals, and spread them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound about. This being done, the Chief, or Eldest of the Family goes close to the Gate of the Burying-place, and holla's aloud seve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Times; after which he calls upon all the Dead there deposited, beginning at the Ear∣iest, and proceeding to the latest, every One distinctly by Name; and for the Conclusion <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ells them, <Q>“Here is a Grand-child, or Re∣lation come to lye among them, and hopes they will receive him as a Friend.”</Q> Then he opens the Gate, and two or three Persons are sent in to dig the Grave, which is com∣monly made seven or eight Foot deep; and the Corps is plac'd in it, and cover'd with the Earth, without saying any more. No Body is permitted to enter here, but some of the nearest Relations and the Bearers; and the Door is immediately clos'd up again. There are commonly a great Number of People with∣out, who are busy'd in cutting up, and divi∣ding among themselves the Cattle, which are given them for that Purpose; if it is a great and rich Family who can afford it: But the poorer Sort can't gratify their Friends so boun∣tifully. Once a Year they commonly go to this Burying-place to clear it of Weeds, and make it clean; but they never enter it till they have burnt a Cow, or Bullock before it.

I have also known some, who, during a Per∣son's Sickness, will go and make a Sacrifice and Prayer here, to invoke the Help of the Spirits of their Fore-fathers; but this is not general. And if any Man has some Ceremo∣nies of his own, which Others do not com∣monly use, no Person is offended; nor do they trouble themselves about it. The Reason is, here are no People, who pretend to be greater Favourites of the supreme God than other Men, and particularly commission'd to inter∣pret, and declare his Will. No One has yet been hardy enough to attempt this, and if any One should, he would meet with few to cre∣dit him; much less would they be brought to make <HI>Deaans,</HI> or Great Men of them.</P>
<P>EVERY Man here, a poor Man as well as a Lord, is a Priest for himself and Family, and expects an Answer by the <HI>Daemons</HI> in his Dreams. If he differs in his Ceremonies from his Neigh∣bour, as there is no Damage giv'n, or receiv'd, there is no Hatred arises; but if they were to set apart Men, and to give them a certain Number of Cattle and Slaves every Year, to perform some certain peculiar Ceremonies, and instead of praying to God themselves, leave it to these to do it for them, and prescribe Rules and Seasons to them, these very People would soon be their Masters: For they would terrify them with the Anger of God, and Demy-Gods,
<PB N="237" REF="257"/>
and make Parties among the People to sup∣port their Interest, for Fear of losing their Substance and Honours; and in the End pu∣nish any innocent Person for their impudent Inventions, under Pretence of <HI>Daemons</HI> coming in the Night from God, and commanding them so to do. We had an Example of the Easiness of Mankind's being impos'd on, by these Pretenders to Prophecy, in my Master <HI>Mevarrow;</HI> and of the Artifice of the Imposers in a Neighbour of ours.</P>
<P>THERE was a Person of Distinction liv'd a∣bout two Hours Walk from us, call'd <HI>Deaan Olaavor,</HI> whose Father dy'd while I was here; and he was preparing to inter him in the Bury∣ing-place of the Family, when the Night be∣fore, <HI>He dream'd his Father appear'd to him:</HI> Or, as he said, <HI>His Father appear'd to him in a Dream, and desir'd him not to bury his Corps; but keep it in a</HI> Sundock, <HI>or Chest, and build a little House for it.</HI> This he perform'd, building a House, as One might guess, about three hundred Yards from the Town to the Eastward; whither he us'd to go, and make Prayers and Sacrifices, and then pretended his Father's Spirit, which he call'd <HI>Lulu-bay,</HI> or the Great Spirit, us'd to come, and tell him strange Things, which should happen to his Neighbours. He came fre∣quently to <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> who gave Ear to almost all he said; which <HI>Olaavor</HI> soon found
<PB N="238" REF="258"/>
how to turn to his Advantage: And when the troublesome Times came on, he would come frequently to <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> and tell him how an∣gry <HI>Lulu-bay</HI> was, and what Misfortunes he threaten'd him with. Now, whether, as he was a cunning Man, he guess'd right from the Reason of Things, or, whether he dream'd right; for sometimes, indeed, it happen'd, as he said; and often otherwise. But the Design seem'd to me chiefly to get an Heifer now and then for a pretended Sacrifice, and often Presents of Strings of Beads, and other Things, for the Pains he was at, in going on Purpose to appease the Wrath, and procure the Assistance of <HI>Lulu-bay.</HI> The Advantage he made of this was so visible, that many People suspected him of Artifice; but at length a Brother of <HI>Deaan Olaavor</HI>'s went to the Wars, and was kill'd; and <HI>Lulu-bay</HI> never came in a Dream, to warn either of them of the Danger. This open'd the Eyes of a great many more, but an Excuse was at hand, <Q>“That this Brother had neg∣lected to sacrifice, and pray to <HI>Lulu-bay;</HI> and therefore, he suffer'd him to fall.”</Q> Yet <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> and some of the silliest of the People still continu'd their superstitious Opi∣nion of this Great Spirit, being afraid to speak, or think any Thing contemptible of it; hav∣ing always ready the Excuse of mean-spirited Bigots, <Q>“That those were safer who paid a
<PB N="239" REF="259"/>
venerable Respect to <HI>Lulu-bay,</HI> than those who did not. Let the Case be how it will, if he was not a great and powerful Spirit, capable of hurting them, or doing them good, but that the whole was a Fiction of <HI>Deaan Olaavor</HI>'s, yet it was no Damage to think he was so, and do him Honours; but if he was in Reality such a potent Spirit, and they should contemn him, then they were sure to suffer for their Contempt.”</Q> This was the foolish Answer those timerous People would give, when they were ask'd the Reason of their tame Compliance to <HI>Deaan Olaavor,</HI> and would have been as good an Ex∣cuse for their worshipping a <HI>Potatoe,</HI> had any Man told them, he had a Revelation in his Dream, that it was a <HI>Demy-God.</HI> I think, my Reader may arrive at a more satisfactory Knowledge of the native Disposition of the People in Morals and Religion, from such In∣stances and Occurrences, than from any set and formal Description, which I can make; I shall, therefore, persue my History, and re∣late here in its proper Place the Feast, and Ceremony of the Circumcision of <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow</HI>'s Son.</P>
<P><Q>“”THE Toak was made some Weeks before∣hand, by boiling the Honey and Combs together, after the Manner of <HI>Mead.</HI> They fill'd a great many Tubs, some as large as
<PB N="240" REF="260"/>
a Butt, and some smaller; a Shed being built, and thatch'd over on purpose, to place them in. When the Day was appointed, Messengers were sent about the Country to invite their Relations and Friends. Three or four Days before the Circumcision, you might see the Beginning of a Festival, Peo∣ple went about blowing of Horns, and beat∣ing of Drums Night and Day; and some Toak out of the lesser Vessels was given them. <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> had procur'd two large Oxen from <HI>Deaan Murnanzack.</HI> They who liv'd furthest off came the Day before, and Toak was giv'n them. When I came Home in the Evening I found the Town full of People, some wallowing on the Ground, and some staggering; scarce any One sober, either Men, Women, or Children: And here One might sensibly perceive the Ef∣fects of Peace and Seeurity, People being wholly abandon'd to Drinking and Merry∣making, without Fear or Care. My Wife, I perceiv'd, had been among them, but had the Prudence to retire Home in Time; for I found her cover'd up asleep.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND now the Day being come, I return'd from looking after my Cattle before Noon, to bring up the two Oxen, and a Bull; whose Legs being immediately ty'd fast, they were thrown along on the Ground:
<PB N="241" REF="261"/>
The Child was near a Year old, for they have no certain Time of doing it: He was was dress'd up with Beads, and a Skain of white Cotton-Thread on his Head. There was a great Concourse of People: Some brought Presents according to their Abi∣lity, as a Cow, or Calf, Beads, Iron Sho∣vels, Hatchets, &amp;c. Every One was serv'd with a little Toak in a Callabash once only before the Ceremony. Things being now ready, they waited for the Signal from the <HI>Ʋmossee,</HI> who was all this While measuring his Shadow with his Feet; and when it came to the Length of three and an half of his Feet, he gave the Word; Then a Principal of the near Relations, who had the Child in his Arms, ran with him to the Bull, and putting the Child's right Hand on the Bull's right Horn,</Q> said these Words,</P>
<P>Tyhew Deaan ƲNGHORRAY, Deaan An∣temoor, Deaan Anebeleshy, Deaan Androfer∣traer, Deaan Meguddumdummateun, an Ruoy Owley, Heer-razehu, ittoey Zorjer, ittoey ac∣quo toey Anomebay loyhe ittoey handrabeck en∣ney Raffa loyhe.</P>
<P>Which is in English, <Q>“”LET the Great God Above, the Lords of the four Quarters of the World, and the <HI>Daemons</HI> prosper this Child, and make a
<PB N="242" REF="262"/>
great Man of him, and let him be strong as this Bull, and overcome his Enemies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”IF the Bull roars while the Boy's Hand is on his Horn, they look on it as an unfor∣tunate <HI>Omen</HI> of his being sickly, or unhap∣py in Life; and all the Business the <HI>Ʋmos∣see</HI> has, is only such Superstition as this, to tell them, <HI>When is the most lucky Hour, or Minute, to do it in;</HI> like a Fortune-teller: But as to the religious Part of the Cere∣mony, he has nothing to do with it. If there is any Religion intended by it, which is some Question, for any experienc'd Man of the Neighbourhood, whom, they suppose, best understands it, performs the Office, by feeling for the Head of the Yard, and cutting the Fore-skin off as close as they can, two Men holding the Child's Legs and Arms: As to the Name, it's giv'n before, and often chang'd afterwards; this Child's was <HI>Ry-mocker.</HI> When the Fore-skin is cut off, a Man stands ready with a Stick, like a Gun-Rammer, the big∣gest End of which is cut pointed; on this he puts the Fore-skin, and going to the Wood, throws it to the Eastward. When the Ceremony is finish'd, the Child is de∣liver'd to its Mother, who is all this While sitting on a Mat, and the Women round
<PB N="243" REF="263"/>
her. And now the Revel began, the Thatch was pull'd from off the Toak-house, and I was order'd to kill the Bull and the Oxen; but these not being enough, my Master sent me for three of those which his Friends brought him; for there were Abundance of People to be fed. Before they began to drink, he took Care to secure their Wea∣pons, and no Man was suffer'd to have ei∣ther Gun or Lance; and then they went to boiling, broiling, and roasting of Meat, and drinking of Toak, singing, hallowing, blowing of Shells, and drumming, as long as they were able. I don't think there were twenty sober Persons among them. This continu'd all Night, some went away the next Morning; but most stay'd till Eve∣ning:</Q> So that the Feast lasted three Days.</P>
<P>THESE People are great Lovers of Toak; and some of the ordinary Fellows as great Sots as any in <HI>England,</HI> and as lazy; for they will sell their <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn, Carravances, and even their very Spades and Shovels, and live on what the Woods afford; their Lambers too must go for Toak, and make a very ordinary One serve their Turn, just to cover their Na∣kedness. It is made of the <HI>Wooring,</HI> a Tree so call'd; which they cut down with a Lance: The onter Bark they take away, and the in∣ner, which is white, they peel off entire, and
<PB N="244" REF="264"/>
beat with a Stick till 'tis soft and pliable; and then it is fit to wear as a Lamber, but it can't be wash'd. The Lambers for the most part are made of Cotton, dy'd in the Yarn, except the richer and great People, who buy the Silks and Callicoes at Sea-port Towns, and at a great Price, as a Cow and a Calf, for no more than will make one Lamber: Other Cloaths the Men wear not, but they adorn themselves with <HI>Mananelers,</HI> which are Rings for their Wrists; and these both Men and Women of Distinc∣tion wear. They are sometimes of Gold (but where they get it is more than I know, and perhaps, worth enquiring after;) often of Silver, but more often of Copper; which I found at length is produc'd, and made in the Country as well as Iron. They dress their Heads handsomely, curling up their Hair to make it lye close; for they have Hair on their Heads, and not Wool, as the <HI>Guinea</HI> Ne∣groes; neither are their Noses flat, tho' they are small, nor their Lips so big; but their Hair is always black, and for the most part curls naturally. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Family are di∣stinguishable for their long Hair, and their Copper-colour'd Skins. Here are several good Laws, notwithstanding they have no Know∣ledge of Letters, yet are they fix'd in their Minds, and deliver'd from one to another; some of which I remember.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="265"/>
<Q>“”IF One assaults another malicioufly, and breaks a Leg, or an Arm, the Offender is fin'd fifteen Head of Cattle to the Injur'd.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“”IF two Men quarrel, and One curses the other's Father and Mother, be they dead or alive, and his Antagonist retorts not the Curse against his Father and Mother, he recovers for Damage two Beeves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“IF a Man is catch'd robbing his Neigh∣bour of an Ox, or a Cow, he is forc'd to restore ten for it.”</Q> And this is rigoroufly executed too, notwithstanding my Master broke this good Law; but he was, like great Men all over the World, seldom to be held by the ordinary Laws of their Country; and yet he, as well as most others, found at last, those who were able to deal with him; and was convinc'd by dear Experience, that if a Man will live at all among Men, he must be bound by the gene∣ral Rules, which the Society in which he lives has fram'd for their Conveniency and Peace; without which Men are not herded Animals, but every One a single Savage, erect Brute, and the World an uncultivated Wilderness.</P>
<P><Q>“”IF One is taken stealing of <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn, Carravances, Potatoes, &amp;c. out of the Plan∣tations, he forfeits a Cow and Calf to the

As,</P>

<P>MY Master <HI>Mevarrow</HI> suspected a young Man to be great with his Wife, or as he said, knew he us'd to lye with her. Whether he had any Proof I cannot say, yet I remem∣ber every Body expected the young Man would be kill'd for it; but his Brother being a chief Man, and Favourite too of the <HI>Deaan</HI>'s, and the Civil Wars coming on, he seem'd to neglect it; but now in peaceable Times, two Years after the Offence, the Man being con∣stantly in his View, he thought of punish∣ing him, and accordingly, he and <HI>Deaan</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="248" REF="268"/>
the young Man, his Brother, and some few Slaves of us to attend them, were in the Woods, it being so contriv'd on Purpose, un∣der pretence of stealing, and killing a Cow; <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> drew the young Man with him in∣to a remote Part of the Woods, distant from us, when in a little Time we heard him holla three Times; at which Instant <HI>Deaan Mcvarrow</HI> arose, and pretending to stretch himself with his Lance in his Hand, he strook the young Man's Brother through the Body. This so surpris'd us all, that we ran some one Way, and some another, thinking our Master mad, and some of us went home, and said so; for this Per∣son whom he kill'd was not the Adulterer: But he had been our Master's Counsel-keeper, and knew all the secret lurking Holes of the Women and Cattle, and thinking he would turn his Enemy, and revenge his Brother's Death, thought it safest to dispatch him too; for <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> had kill'd the suppos'd Adul∣terer just as he holla'd, which was the Sig∣nal agreed on between them; but whether he knew <HI>Deaan M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>varrow</HI>'s Design on the other I can't tell; for there were several other Peo∣ple, which he had brought there, as if he design'd they should be Witnesses of it. <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> being the Executioner, made me strong∣ly imagine there was more than Suspicion; for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was no cruel Man, as I knew by Expe∣rience:

Yet I had a very good Opinion be∣fore of my Mistress, having never myself seen any Thing like it in her Conduct. But I had now almost done with this Family and Country, for every Occurrence and Circumstance in my Affairs had some Tendency to forward my De∣parture and Escape, which I, at length, ef∣fected.</P>
<P>IT happen'd not long after this, that while I went by Stealth to see my own Plantation, my Corn, &amp;c. being near ripe; in the mean Time some of my Cattle broke into the Plan∣tation of a principal Man, and did him some Damage. I soon heard of it by my Fellow-Slaves, and went to seek the Beasts; but they were drove Home to the Town by the Plan∣ter's Servants with heavy Complaints: I knew the Danger of going within View, or Reach of my Master; and therefore, turn'd aside into the Wood, to consider what Step was next to be taken. I, at length, remember'd the Friend∣ship between <HI>Deaan Olaavor</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mevar∣row,</HI> and therefore went directly to him, and told him my Case, begging his Endeavours to reconcile me to my Master. He readily a∣gred to it, made me welcome, and desir'd me to stay that Night, and the next Day and Night, and on the third he would go with me himself; but Business hinder'd him so that he could not go before. By this Means I was
<PB N="250" REF="270"/>
absent long enough to alarm them with the Fear of my Desertion. However <HI>Deaan Olaa∣vor</HI> went with me according to his Word, and after he had expostulated the Case, and pro∣cur'd my Pardon, I was sent for in, and re∣stor'd to Favour, with only some Admoni∣tions for my future Behaviour. After the Conversation on my Fault and Pardon was ended, they fell into familiar Discourse; and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> clapp'd his Hand to his Mouth, which is an Action they use, when they are fill'd with Wonder at any Thing.</P>
<P><Q><HI>“Deaan Olaavor!</HI> Yesterday, <HI>says he,</HI> I sent for an <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> to advise with about <HI>Robin;</HI> and to divine what was become of him: After he had conjur'd a great While, he told me, I should see <HI>Robin</HI> once more; but the next Time he goes away, I should ne∣ver see him again under my Command. He will have a Master to the Northward, with whom he will not live long, but will still go farther Northward, and have more Ma∣sters; and at length return to his Native Country.”</Q> I could not help listening with Attention and Pleasure to what he said, tho' I had no Reliance on these Fortune-tellers. I was getting up to go Home to my Wife, when my Master call'd me: <Q>“Stay, <HI>says he,</HI> I have something to do with you before you go.”</Q> Seeing me look a little terrify'd, <Q>“I shall do
<PB N="251" REF="271"/>
you no Harm, <HI>says he,</HI> only make sure of you.”</Q> Immediately the <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> was sent for, and then, I perceiv'd, they were going to inchant me, (as they think) that I should not run away. I had seen this Magical Drollery perform'd before on Slaves they suspect; often forcing an Oath upon them by the <HI>Daemon Fer∣monner.</HI> And when these poor Wretches have afterwards endeavour'd to fly, and get bewil∣der'd in Woods and unknown Ways, or hurt themselves by a Fall, or any common Acci∣dent; they are silly enough to think the <HI>Dae∣mon Fermonner</HI> has done it, and confounded them, and dazzled their Eyes, that they shall not find the Way. Two or three Instances of this Nature in an Age, are enough to make Fools give Credit to the whole.</P>
<P>AT length enters the wrinkled old Wizard, with solemn Pace, and a leering Sneer in his hagger'd Countenance, shaking his projecting Noddle: <Q>“”Ha!—Well I see you have him.—I told you so.—Who is he that dares to despise my Prophetick Spirit? You see as much is prov'd true, as the Time will permit.—Neglect my Advice for the fu∣ture, and look to the Northward for your Slave.—But in vain may you look, and send too; it will be then to late.—The Spirits who are at my Command may do somewhat now.

<PB N="252" REF="272"/>
<HI>Deaan Olaavor?</HI></Q> (Who was not so great a Bigot as <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> notwithstanding his <HI>Lulu-bay.)</HI> <Q><HI>“Robin</HI> never run away at all, he would have come yesterday, if I could have spar'd Time; so here's nothing at all of what you talk of. "Pray, wise old Man go on, says <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> (interrupting <HI>Olaavor)</HI> I sent for you on Purpose to take your Advice.—Prepare the Charms.”</Q> Away goes the fumbling old Fellow to work, scra∣ping a Root, and mixing of Things, which I knew, had neither Good nor Harm in them; (for I was afraid of nothing but his Nose drop∣ping into it;) muttering all the While betwixt his few broken Teeth, Words that neither himself, nor any One else knew any Meaning to. When the Dose was prepar'd, he call'd it the <HI>Fermonner,</HI> and put it into Carravances boil'd on Purpose, and it was given me in a Callabash: But before I eat it, he hung seve∣ral Roots about me; one over my Eyes, one at my Back, one on my Breast, and one on each Leg, giving every one a Name; then scraping a little from each of them, and put∣ting it into the Mess of Carravances, I was order'd to eat it, which I did without any Concern; in the mean While he pronounc'd his Prayers and Curses over me. <Q>“”Whenever he thinks of running away, remember, O You <HI>Deaan Fermonner,</HI> how he has eaten what
<PB N="253" REF="273"/>
belongs to you; and also,</Q> O Ye, &amp;c. <HI>[Here he nam'd all the Spirits belonging to other charm'd Roots.]</HI> <Q>“how he has eaten what belongs to you; and if he offers to go away, arise in his Stomach, O <HI>Deaan Fermonner,</HI> and make him so sick, that he shall not be able to stir: And Ye, which have guarded his several Parts, break his Back; let his Breast be tormented with Pain, and his Legs chain'd, as with <HI>Parra-pingo's;</HI> and if he sets for∣ward join all your Powers, and break his Legs the first Time he jumps, or steps over any Thing in his Way.”</Q> Thus he went on for a long Time, but in a more abrupt Manner without any Method, with his Hands tossing, and his Voice changing, high and low, with an hundred impertinent Repetitions, and cant Words of his own Invention; raving like a fanatical Enthusiast. When he had tyr'd him∣self with Preaching, he takes off the Charms, making me lick every one of them. <Q>“”Now let him go, <HI>says he,</HI> where he pleases; the <HI>Dae∣mons</HI> which attend these Charms will soon acquaint me, and I shall inform his Master.</Q></P>
<P>I had a Holliday giv'n me this Day, for my Master was in a good Humout, being highly pleas'd with what he had done; and sent ano∣ther to do my Business. When I came Home, I found my Wife sitting in a melancholy Po∣sture, being under great Concern, for Fear I
<PB N="254" REF="274"/>
should be kill'd. She would have prepar'd me something to eat, but I told her I had din'd, and related the whole Affair to her. She was glad I got off so well, aud wonder'd I was so dull at it, knowing I did not regard any of these Ceremonies, and made a Jest of them; but I had quite different Thoughts than she was aware on, or than I durst trust her with; which broke my Rest so, that I scarce ever slept sound there any more. I found I must now run away at all Hazards; for if Sickness, or any common Accident had attended me, such was <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow</HI>'s Superstition, that he would certainly have thought it had been done by these Dae∣mons or Spirits invok'd in this Conjuration; and took it for an infallible Sign of my Intenti∣on to go from him, and very probably in his Passion would have kill"d me. So that these Conjurations, which <HI>Mevarrow</HI> depended on to hinder me from going, had the direct contrary Effect, and was the most pressing Motive, that could have happen'd to force me to it, and made it absolutely necessary that it should be so; yet I have often thought how unaccounta∣bly true his Prediction, or Guess prov'd, even in the very Circumstances of it.</P>
<P>WHILE my Head was full of Projections, which Way to bring it about, I could not help saying somewhat relating to my Design to a very civil, honest, young Man, who kept
<PB N="255" REF="275"/>
Cattle always near me; and was a Captive from another Country. I ask'd him one Day where he came from? and he said from the Northward; I told him if I was so near my own Country as he was, I would not stay here in Slavery. Nor would I, <HI>says he,</HI> were it not for the <HI>Daemons,</HI> who, I am afraid, will break my Bones ever since the <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> curs'd me so, as he did you; at which I laugh'd. <Q>“Why, <HI>says he,</HI> if you are not afraid of that, you may get away with as much Ease as I.”</Q> I startled at this, and told him, <Q>“I suppose he did it to try me.”</Q> But he offer'd to en∣ter into a solemn Oath before the <HI>Owley,</HI> that he meant no such Thing, and would assist me in it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I went no further with the Ar∣gument that Day, but the next I try'd him; for after swearing him in a religious Man∣ner, and knowing him to be like most Peo∣ple, more religiously dispos'd under Misfor∣tunes than in Prosperity; I freely confess'd my Desire was to go, and ask'd his Advice: He told me, <Q>“I had nothing to do, but fly directly to <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> who would pro∣tect me, and treat me civilly; that when <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI>'s Army came next Summer, I might easily get to them, who would be glad to oblige the white Men by sending me Home in the first Ship which arriv'd at <HI>Fer∣raignher:</HI>

So that if you get from hence, you will soon get to some Town where Ships come.”</Q> I thank'd him for his Advice, and told him, I would shew him my Bee-hives, and the Roots of which the Charm was made. This I did to make him keep the Secret. And,</P>
<P>NOW I had but one hard Task more to go through, and that was to persuade my Wife to fly with me; or let me carry her Home to her Father. It was no easy Matter to break my Mind to her, but at length catch∣ing her in an Humour talking of her Friends, and wishing she could see them; I told her, if she would be resolute, and secret, and al∣ways love me, I would carry her to them, and stay with her; but she was superstitious too, and afraid I should be hurt by the Charms of the <HI>Ʋmossee:</HI> So that I could not insist up∣on it any surther. But to part with her, and leave her in Slavery, and perhaps, to be ill∣us'd on my Account, was a mortifying Stroak to me, for I lov'd her sincerely.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, there was a Necessity, my Re∣solution was fix'd, and I had no Time to lose; it was now rainy Weather, and I stay'd only till it should be fair again, which was about a Fortnight: Near which Time I took my
<PB N="257" REF="277"/>
Companion into the Woods, shew'd him my Hives, and also the Manner of digging the Roots for the Charms; for it was to no Pur∣pose to attempt to undeceive him. The Night before I went away I left an Heifer in the Field on Purpose, telling my Friend, <HI>When I call'd, and desir'd him to look after my Cattle, while I went after the Heifer; that should be the Signal of my Departure.</HI> He told me it was two Days Walk to <HI>Yong-gorvo;</HI> but I said I would run it in one, and did not doubt of getting safe thi∣ther, even tho' my Master should send after me; if I was but two Hours before them. When I came Home with my Cattle, my Ma∣ster look'd on them, and miss'd the Heifer; but after chiding me a little, he bid me get up early in the Morning, and look for it, be∣fore it broke into any Person's Plantation.</P>
<P>THIS was what I plotted, for to have the whole Day before me; but now came the hard∣est Task, which was to take Leave of my Wife. It was some Satisfaction that I had no Child by her: I was almost afraid to tell her, but at length, after making her swear solemnly by the <HI>Owley,</HI> that she would keep the Secret I should intrust her with, I told her I was go∣ing, and the only Trouble I had was parting with her. She begg'd, and cry'd, but there was no staying any longer for me here, my Life was every Day in Danger. Had I been
<PB N="258" REF="278"/>
in any other Part of the Country, where I could have liv'd free, easy, and safe, I don't know what Effects the Love I had for her might have produc'd. At length she was a little ap∣peas'd from her first Passion, and I broke from her Arms by Break of Day, with what Pain those of my Readers who are tender Lovers, can bet∣ter imagine than I describe. I drove my Cattle into the Field, where my Companion was rea∣dy; I did not go near him for Fear of Spies, but call'd, and bid him take Care of my Cattle; he said Yes, Yes: And away I walk'd, or ra∣ther ran; for by that Time the Sun was two Hours high, I was got thorow the first Woods, which is not much less than ten Miles, if it could be measur'd.</P>
<P>I had now a Plain to go over of five or six Miles, here I look'd back often, for Fear of Persuers, but saw none; for my Wife and Friend, as I heard afterwards, were both faith∣ful. I came to a Pond about Noon, where I just wash'd, and refresh'd myself, and kept going on, till at length I espy'd the white Clift of <HI>Yong-gorvo.</HI> It is very high, and look'd like Land seen seven or eight Leagues at Sea; but I was not discourag'd; and two Hours be∣fore Night I was at the Foot of it. It is a good half Hour's brisk Walk to go up the Hill to <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s Town, where I at length ar∣riv'd, and went directly to him. He thought
<PB N="259" REF="279"/>
when he saw me, that I came with a Message from <HI>Deaan Mevarrow;</HI> but I threw myself at his Feet, and begg'd his Protection; telling him all the Hardships I had endur'd by my Master's Barbarity, and the eminent Danger my Life was in every Day; and now more than ever.</P>
<P>HE no sooner perceiv'd the Reason of my Coming, than I discover'd a Pleasure in his Countenance, and he told me, he would pro∣tect me, and I should be no longer a Slave; he would give me a Gun, and I should do nothing but go along with him. Now Car∣rying a Gun here, like Wearing a Sword in <HI>England,</HI> is the Mark of a Gentleman: <HI>Says he,</HI> <Q>“”You look with this Lance in your Hand, like a <HI>Mall-a-Coss;</HI></Q> (which is a Nick-name they give meanest of the Natives) <Q>“you shall appear like a white Man as you are.”</Q> I lick'd his Feet with great Satisfaction, and return'd him Thanks; nor did I forget to ac∣knowledge the Goodness of God, who had thus far prosper'd my Endeavours for Liber∣ty, and to desire his further Assistance.</P>
<P>WHEN I told them I came in one Day from my own House, there was no Body gave Cre∣dit to it; but about a Week after came two Messengers from <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> to <HI>demand his white Slave, and to reproach</HI> Deaan Afferrer, <HI>for not sending me back by some of his own Peo∣ple</HI>
<PB N="260" REF="280"/>
<HI>as soon as I arriv'd there.</HI> This haughty Mes∣sage made him laugh. <HI>Says he,</HI> "Send him back! and by my own People too! and his <Q>“white Slave! No Body ever saw a white Man a Slave before; nor has he any Right to make a Slave of him. I look upon him as a distressed Man, fled to me for Relief; and I will not expose him to Misery. I shall not make a Slave of him, he is at his Liberty, and may stay with me, or go any where else whenever he pleases.”</Q> He said a great deal more relating to our People and <HI>Deaan Crindo;</HI> which being to the same Pur∣pose as Others have said before, I shall not re∣peat. In short, he convinc'd the two Men, in∣somuch that they excus'd themselves, saying <HI>They only came with a Message.</HI> And, <HI>says he, I only tell you what to say to</HI> Deaan Mevarrow. And then enter'd into a familiar Conversa∣tion with them, and ask'd them the Day I came away; when they told him he was sur∣pris'd; and so were they to find I had walk'd it all in one Day; for I don't thiuk it less than sixty <HI>English</HI> Miles. I could not forbear reflect∣ing on them, for having Faith in these <HI>Ʋmos∣sees,</HI> <Q>“”See, <HI>says I,</HI> how my Legs are broke, and how the Spirits have hinder'd me.</Q> <HI>They said,</HI> I was a white Man, and they had no Power over me. After <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> had or∣der'd them a House and Provisions, and I had
<PB N="261" REF="281"/>
enquir'd after my Wife, I took my Leave of them with Pleasure; for I had some Doubt before what might be the Effect of <HI>Deaan Me∣varrow</HI>'s demanding me.</P>
<P>AND now I liv'd, indeed, with more Free∣dom than ever I did before; for I walk'd a∣bout with my Gun on my Shoulder, eat, when the <HI>Deaan</HI> eat, tho' not in the same Dish; for no One does that here. I had nothing to do, but to go along with him a hunting; by which Means I made myself perfect in all the Ways of taking wild Cattle: My main Business was observing the Country, and enquiring the Way which <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> was expected to come.</P>
<P>I chose to go often on Hunting, on Purpose to take Notice of the notable Mountains, which might be so many Land-marks to me. Here is besides <HI>Vohitch Futey,</HI> or white Hill, another very high Mountain more to the North-ward, call'd <HI>Vohitch Manner,</HI> or red Hill. It is like a Sugar-Loaf, and runs towering up a great Height; the Inhabitants think it to be the highest in the World. After I had liv'd thus six Months, almost the only Time that I did not go a hunting with them, <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> met them accidently in the Forest, as he was coming to give <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> and the other Lords Notice of the <HI>Feraignher</HI> Army being on their March. This was such pleasing News to me, that I could not tell how to conceal my Joy, and
<PB N="262" REF="282"/>
therefore, walk'd into the Woods, for Fear they should discover my Intention by my Be∣haviour. I would have return'd God Thanks in English, for the Hopes I had of getting to a Sea-port Town; but found I had forgot my native Language, and could scarce put three English Words together. However, the <HI>Ma∣dagascar</HI> Tongue serv'd me well enough to ex∣press my pious Sentiments.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> told me, when I came Home, of his seeing <HI>Ry-Nanno,</HI> and the News he brought of <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI>'s Death, and his Son's <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI>'s succeeding him; and of his Ne∣phew <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s commanding the Army, assisted by his Brother <HI>Rer Befaugher</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI>'s Brother <HI>Rer Mundrosser.</HI> As I was talking with the <HI>Deaan,</HI> I could not help say∣ing I was sorry for <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI>'s Death, be∣cause he was so good a Friend to white Men. I perceiv'd immediately he suspected my De∣sign, but it was in a civil Manner, he told me he hop'd I had no Occasion to change my Place of Aboad thro' his Usage of me. To which I reply'd, and thank'd him for his Favours, and said, <Q>“I had no Thoughts of changing my Habitation; that I was sensible I liv'd as well, or better than I could do any where else.”</Q> And, indeed, this was true; for he treated me very handsomely. I eat, and drank as he did, and did no Work; but I found
<PB N="263" REF="283"/>
by this, that he was not willing to part with me; and therefore I was oblig'd to be more close and cunning than I should have been, had I not made this Discovery.</P>
<P>NOW Orders were sent to the three Towns under <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s Command, that no One should go out a hunting of wild Cattle; but prepare to hunt the wild Boar, by which they meant the King of <HI>Merfaughla;</HI> and all Hands were at Work, cleaning, and fitting up their Arms; for here are Artificers, who can make, or mend a Spring, and do several other Things to Guns as well as Lances. The Women made Caps to distinguish us in the Wars; they are made of the same as our Mats: The Children beat <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn for to carry with us. I made ready <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s, and my own Gun, and cast Shot, or rather Slugs, by making a Hole in Clay, with a round Stick to cast the Lead in, and cutting it in pieces about half an Inch long. They also buy Shot at the Sea-ports, but this was made, as I guess, of the Lead, which they had from the Wreck of our Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> went back to <HI>Deaan Trongba,</HI> to meet him at <HI>Vohitch Manner</HI> according to Ap∣pointment; and in a Fortnight's Time. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> sent Orders for us to march, and meet him at the River, where we water'd our Cattle in <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Country. I might have staid at Home, but was resolv'd at the Ha∣zard
<PB N="264" REF="284"/>
of my Life to go with them, I told <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> I was afraid of my old Master <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> whom to be sure, I should see there: But he bid me not be uneasy, for he would protect me; and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> would not make a Distur∣bance in the Army. But it happen'd better than I expected, for <HI>Mevarrow</HI> was left at Home sick of the <HI>Colah;</HI> which is what is call'd in <HI>Guinea,</HI> or the <HI>West Indies,</HI> the <HI>Yaws.</HI> <Q>“”It is a wretched Distemper, not unlike the <HI>Pox,</HI> affecting the Bones and Joints with great Pain and Soreness, breaking out all over in Blotches and dry Scabs, infesting the privy Parts, and under the Arm-pits chiefly; yet is it not the <HI>Pox:</HI> For I have known Chil∣dren of three or four Years old have it, whose Parents never had it; tho' there are very few who escape it once in their Life-time, but they have it no more. For it is, in that respect, like the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and also catch'd as that is, or the <HI>Itch.</HI> Insomuch that a Person who never had it, if he fol∣lows One infected in the long Grass, or Bushes, he will surely catch it; also by ly∣ing, or sitting on the same Mat, or even eating, and drinking after the diseased Per∣son. For this Reason they send their Chil∣dren, when they have it, to nurse to some who live alone in remote Places; and when a Man or Family is taken with it, they ob∣lige
<PB N="265" REF="285"/>
them to go into the Woods, and re∣main till they are cur'd; which is very of∣ten a whole Year, and sometimes two Years.</Q></P>
<P>IT was good News to me, to hear that <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> was left at Home infected with this Distemper; and that <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> commanded the People in his Room. I knew experimen∣tally this last was none of my Enemy, tho' the same Evening he came, he demanded me in his Brother's Name; but when <HI>Deaan Affer∣rer</HI> expostulated the Case, and told him what he had said to the former Messengers, and added, <Q>“”That it was natural for a Man to fly for his Life, who was every Day in Fear of it, and us'd like a Brute, even tho' he had been a lawful Slave; which he insisted on was not my Case.</Q> <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> soon gave up the Argument, and turn'd to me, asking, <Q>“If he had not several Times sav'd me, and bid me not be afraid, for he would not in∣sist on it any more; desiring I would come often, and see him as a Friend.”</Q> I grate∣fully acknowledg'd his Favours, and thank'd him for this last signal One; for he confirm'd the Account I had giv'n of myself before.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> having Notice of the Day the <HI>Feraingher</HI> Army would join them, put him∣self in Order to receive them with a great Deal of Form and Ceremony. He was seated under a great <HI>Tamarind</HI> Tree, his Sons accord∣ing
<PB N="266" REF="286"/>
to their Seniority▪ on his Right-hand, and all their People; on his Left were <HI>Deaan Mur∣nanzack,</HI> and his Brethren with all their People; forming a Line of above a quarter of a Mile in length. After a little While the <HI>Feraingher</HI> Ar∣my appear'd, and as they approach'd us, they came Dancing with each a Gun in their Left-hand, and a Lance in the Right; their Shells sounding and Drums beating. At a little Di∣stance they fired some Pieces to salute us, which was returned on our Side, and now the three Generals, <HI>Deaan Trongha, Rer Befaugher,</HI> and <HI>Rer Mundrosser,</HI> went up to <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> and the Rest; and after the usual Salutations, they were all feated under the <HI>Tamarind</HI> Tree, and ten Calabashes of Toak sent for by <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> to entertain them. I sat all this While behind <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> with his Gun in my Hand. After mutual Assurances of their League of Friend∣ship, they settled the Division of the Prizes of Cattle, which was, that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> and his Sons should have one thrid; <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> and his Brethren another third; and <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> and his Brother and Cousin, the other.</P>
<P>AFTER they had settl'd their own Affairs, and began to be chearful over their Toak, <Q>“”says <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> You have got a white Man amongst you I see. Yes, <HI>says Deaan Crindo,</HI> this is one of those who took me and my Nephew Prisoners; and would have
<PB N="267" REF="287"/>
deliver'd us into <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI>'s Hands▪ who was our Enemy. I don't think, <HI>says Deaan Trongha,</HI> they would have done you any Harm; you must certainly have done them some great Injury first. I did them no Wrong, <HI>reply'd the other,</HI> unless main∣taining them well was wronging them: They wanted indeed to go to <HI>Antenosa,</HI> and I would keep them with me to assist in the Wars. And was not this, says <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> a great Injury, and a just Provoca∣tion, to keep Free Men against their Will in a strange Country? But I will relate a very remarkable Affair of my Grand∣father's, with these white Men, before he was well acquainted with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”There came an <HI>English</HI> Ship to our Sea Town, (which they call St. <HI>Augustine Bay)</HI> for to buy Provisions, and get Water; they did not go up to my Grandfather's Town, but he went down to them, and present∣ed the Captain with two Oxen, as a free Gift; and the Captain freely gave him a Gun, and some Powder and Shot. The white Men built a House on the Shore to put some sick Men in. It happen'd some Days after we had been here, that the white Men, and some of ours, got drunk together, and a Quarrel arose among them. They beat one another with their Fists at
<PB N="268" REF="288"/>
first, but at length Weapons were us'd, and a white Man was kill'd by one of ours. So soon as the News was carry'd to the Ship, the Captain came on Shore, and after enquiring into the Matter, he took hold of the King, while his People ran to the Boat, and fetch'd their Arms. My Father, and <HI>Rer Vovvern,</HI> immediately headed our Peo∣ple, and would have fought them; but were hindred by my Grandfather; for he was sure of being kill'd, by one Side or the other; so he went quietly on board their Ship. The Fisher-men were not at all a∣fraid of the white Men, notwithstanding this Disturbance, for they knew them well, and were acquainted with their Manners; so they went on board, and ask'd <HI>what the Captain requir'd of the King?</HI> He said, <HI>Satis∣faction for the white Man who was kill'd.</HI> They return'd, and ask'd in the Name of the King's two Sons, <HI>What Satisfaction they demanded?</HI> The Captain reply'd, <HI>They must send him the Man who kill'd the</HI> English-man, <HI>and ten Oxen for the Damage.</HI> The Fisher-man had no more Wit than to deliver his Message in publick; which the Murderer hearing, ran directly into the Woods; so that when they sent to take him he was gone. The Fisher-man return'd to the Cap∣tain, and told him, they had made dili∣gent
<PB N="269" REF="289"/>
Search for the Man, but he was fled; and if he would have a Slave or two, or twenty Oxen, they were ready to give it him. The Captain was very angry at this, and sent Word, that he would have the <HI>same Man,</HI> for he had Murder'd his Man bar∣barously; and if they did not find him, he would keep their Father: But he would grant them ten Days Time to search for him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”DURING these ten Days, my Grandfather's Legs had Irons upon them, to keep him from getting away; but he eat and drank with the Captain all the Time, and was very civilly treated. When the ten Days were expir'd, and the Captain was satisfied they could not find the Murderer, he took the Irons off the King's Legs; and ask'd him, If he would enter into a religious Oath, never to wrong any <HI>English-man,</HI> nor suffer his People to do it. To which my Grand∣father readily agreed. And after he had din'd with the Captain, they came on Shore together. How, says <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> do you and your Family eat with white Men? Yes, says <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> we <HI>Andry Voler</HI> (which is the Sur-name of the Family) do eat out of the same Dish, and drink out of the same Cup, and esteem them as our own Family. We never pretend to as∣sume
<PB N="270" REF="290"/>
a Power over them, they come, and go, and do as they please with us; and if a∣ny idle Fellows do ill Things, their Cap∣tains do not hinder their being punish'd. We have great Profit by these white Men coming amongst us, which they would not do, if we did not treat them civilly. Besides, our Grandfather has bound us all with an Oath, and a Curse. on all our Posterity, who shall use an <HI>English-man</HI> ill. For when he, and the Captain came on Shore, the <HI>Owley</HI> was brought out, and they swore solemnly to a perpetual Friendship, which we do all strictly observe; and think God will not prosper us if we break it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“MY Grand-father gave the Captain twenty Oxen, which he receiv'd; but he would re∣turn the full Value of them in Guns, and other Things. And if we had this white Man amongst us, we should give him Cloaths, which his Country-men have left who dy'd there. Says <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> he will hardly wear any of his own Country Cloaths a∣gain.”</Q> Better you were hang'd, <HI>thought I,</HI> tho' I durst not say so.</P>
<P>THE next Day we march'd to the Borders of <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> and encamp'd: I lay always in <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s Tent. The next Morning we decamp'd again, and march'd a great Way in∣to the Country, towards <HI>Manner-ronder</HI> (a small
<PB N="271" REF="291"/>
River passing by <HI>Woozington</HI>'s Chief Town) we passed thorow several small Towns, but found them all deserted by the Inhabitants; and by the dryness of the Dung of the Cat∣tle, we judg'd they had been gone a Fortnight: For <HI>Woozington</HI> was a politick Man, and would leave nothing for us to live on, neither would he waste his Army in fruitless Skirmishes and weak Attempts; but wait till he had obtain'd the Knowledge of our Strength by his Spies, and also got all the Force he could to oppose us. A Man came to me privately from <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> with a Message, that he desir'd to speak with me. To which I answer'd, I would, as soon as I could possibly contrive to come without any Notice taken. Which I accom∣plish'd in two or three Days, telling <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> I was going to see <HI>Deaan Sambo.</HI> To this he reply'd, I need not ask him Leave; yet he bid me not go any where else. By which I knew well what he meant; and that he was jealous of me. However, I returned, and by private Ways in the dark, got to <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s Tent; there were a great ma∣ny with him. He spoke to me in <HI>English,</HI> ask∣ing me, <HI>how I did,</HI> I was forc'd to answer in the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Language, telling him, <HI>I had forgot to speak my Mother Tongue.</HI> This, and my being naked, mov'd his Compassion; that he spake as tender Things to me as my own
<PB N="272" REF="292"/>
Father could; and wish'd he could find any Means to take me with him, he would send me Home in the first Ship. While we were talking, <HI>Rer Befaugher</HI> came in, who taking me by the Hand, said, <HI>Ah Brother, how do you do?</HI> I could answer, <HI>Very well;</HI> but could speak no more <HI>English</HI> without a Mixture of this Coun∣try Language. They told me there had lately been some <HI>English</HI> Men of War to seek for Py∣rates, and they had directed them to St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s and <HI>Mattatanna,</HI> on the other side of the Island; that there was but one white Man then amongst them, and he was a <HI>Dutch-man;</HI> an <HI>English-man</HI> had been kill'd not long since in the Wars. I told him, I resolv'd, at the Hazard of my Life, to escape, and follow them; but they said they would buy me if they gave six Slaves for me. After Thanks for their Civility, and agreeing not to take any publick Notice of one another, I took my Leave of them, and went to <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI>'s Tent; who also treated me very hand∣somely, telling me, he was going to live by himself, and ask'd me if I would come to him, which I promis'd to do; I took my Leave and return'd to our Tent. The next Morning a Consultation was held, in which it was resolv'd to divide the Army into three Parts, and march a-breast one another; but at the distance of a quarter of a Mile. We saw no Body all this While, till we were near the Chief Town; and
<PB N="273" REF="293"/>
then we perceiv'd Spies observing us; but the Town was deserted. We passed the River <HI>Man∣ner-ronder,</HI> and encamp'd on the Plain; where we had not been long, before three Men came and call'd to our People, and bid them tell <HI>Deaan Crin∣do,</HI> that <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> would come, and pay him a Visit the next Morning. Now he was a cunning Man, and full of Stratagems; so not∣withstanding this bold Challenge, they knew he would endeavour to surprise, or over-reach them by Policy; so we went hard to Work every Man to fortify the Camp, which was form'd in a Circle. Trees were cut down, and forked Limbs set up, the Spaces fill'd with great pieces of Wood, pil'd one on another length ways, four Foot high, and joining close, made a Wall of it: Then we dug the Ground about a Foot deep, and about seven Foot wide, throw∣ing up the Earth against the wooden Pile mak∣ing the Wall stronger; we left only two nar∣row Entrances. The loose small Boughs, with the Leaves on, were thrown, as it were, care∣lessly without side to hide the Fortification; so that it seem'd like nothing but a common Way they have of concealing their Numbers: When we made our Camp secure, some Cattle were kill'd, and all Hands to Supper, and then we laid down under our Tent Cloths; for we did not set up our Tents, nor pull off our Lambers, but lay close under the Fortification, ready for
<PB N="274" REF="294"/>
an Attack; the Slaves who carried the Provi∣sion were plac'd in the Center.</P>
<P>WE arose at Day-break, putting our Guns through Holes in our Wall left on Purpose, and kneel'd to fight with the more Ease and better Aim. We had not not been up above ten Minutes, before we saw them coming down furiously upon us. While we were attending to receive them, another Party appear'd on the opposite Side, thinking to have come on our Backs; but we being in a Ring were all Front. Our Shells were sounded, and our Drums beat; but we soon changed this for another sort of Noise. When they came within thirty Yards they fir'd briskly, still coming forward; and thinking nothing of our Wall, expected we should soon give way from behind the Boughs. I observ'd their Eyes red with smoak∣ing <HI>Jermaughler,</HI> which made them more daring than usual. (I shall describe this after the Relation of the Fight) <HI>Ry-Opheck,</HI> with a Body of Men, attack'd one of the Entrances of our Camp; he came jumping along, his Eyes like Fire, a Lance in one Hand, a Gun in the o∣ther, and his People running after him so fu∣riously, that <HI>Trodaughe,</HI> who should have de∣fended the Passage, gave way with his People. We were employ'd on our Side, and did not know it, till he had got within our Camp; when one of our chief Men turning, and seeing <HI>Ry-Opheck</HI>
<PB N="275" REF="295"/>
stabbing our Men, and they running before fir'd at him, and shot him in the Belly. When he found himself wounded he went back again, and fell about thirty or forty Yards from the Place; his People ran back when he did, instead of revenging him. (See how common Men mi∣mick a General's Behaviour!) But when they saw him fall, they return'd to bring off his Bo∣dy, and this brought on a fierce Contest in the open Field; for <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> leap'd over the Works, and most of us who were his Peo∣ple after him, and made them retire. Here a Man, distinguishable from the rest by his yel∣lowish Colour, and who seem'd of superior Rank, took Aim at me, and missing, I return'd his Compliment, wounded him in the Thigh, and running up to him, found his Hand full of Powder to charge again, and menacing with his Countenance and Words; but I snatch'd his Lance from him, and prevented him from doing any further Mischief to me▪ or any Body else. Another such Push on the opposite Side entirely defeated the Enemy that they fled, and we persued them, but not far; because we would not divide ourselves, least <HI>Woozington</HI> should have turn'd, and took the Advantage of our Disorder; which he would certainly have done, had an Opportunity presented.</P>
<P>WHEN we return'd to our Camp, the <HI>Deaans</HI> all assembl'd at <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Tent, who took
<PB N="276" REF="296"/>
Notice of every Man according to his Merit, thanking them for their Conduct and Bravery: He next enquir'd of every One what Men they had lost, and found not above sixteen kill'd, and thirteen wounded. Then he sent out to count the dead Bodies of the Enemy, and found one hundred and seventy five; among whom were sixteen great Men, two of <HI>Woozington</HI>'s younger Sons, <HI>Metorolahatch,</HI> and <HI>Rer Fungenzer;</HI> his Nephews, <HI>Ry-Opheck</HI> and <HI>Rer Chula;</HI> the Others Names I never knew. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> order'd the Bodies of these sixteen to be cut to Pieces, and thrown about the Field, that their Friends might not bury them. We march'd two or three Days after, further into <HI>Merfaughla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> plundering, and spoiling their Plantations.</P>
<Q>“These People being more addicted to smoak <HI>Jermaughler</HI> than Others, it will be proper to describe it here. It is a Plant about five Foot high, bearing a small long Leaf, and a Cod, containing about a dozen Seeds like <HI>Hempseed:</HI> They mix the Leaves and Seeds together, lay them in the Sun three or four Days, till they are very dry; and then they are fit to be smoak'd. They make Pipes of a Reed, or rather small Cane, and sometimes they have a very long Shell which does well enough. It makes them drunk, their Eyes look red and fiery, and their Looks wild and fierce. It is easie to know a Man who
<PB N="277" REF="297"/>
smoaks <HI>Jermaughler;</HI> while the Effects last, they are more vigorous and fierce; being as it were distracted. Those who use it much, are good for nothing, but when they are drunk with it. I had once the Curiosity to try a little myself, it made my Head swim, that I was sick, and as it were drunk for three Days; so that I never meddl'd any more with it.”</Q>
<P>WE were two Days before our Spies could discover any Cattle. At length they came and told us, they had heard the bellowing of some; and a thousand Men were order'd to fetch them. They were gone a Week, but they return'd with above two thousand Beeves, and two hun∣dred and fifty Captives; Women, and Children. This great Prize made them eager to go again; so on a Consultation, a Camp was form'd, and fortify'd as before; in which, <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> re∣main'd with four thousand Men, while two thousand went out to plunder; and when they return'd, other two thousand were to go.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Afferrer, Deaan Sambo, Rer Mimebo∣lambo,</HI> and <HI>Rer Befaugher,</HI> went out with two thousand Men. We had three or four for Guides, who knew the Country well, and where they us'd to feed their Cattle: Nevertheless, we were two Days before we came into any of their Tracks, and then they were all drove off; and, as appear'd by their Marks, different
<PB N="278" REF="298"/>
So our Army divided, <HI>Deaan Sambo,</HI> and <HI>Rer Befaugher,</HI> went to the Northward, and we to the South-West. We march'd in the Tracks all Day, and the next Night being Moon-shine: In the Morning we found ourselves near the Sea, where they had drove the Beasts to the Water's Edge, that the ebbing, and flowing, and wash of the Sea, might efface their Foot-steps on the Sands; which in a great Measure, it did: But we march'd on all Day, till we found out where they turn'd out towards the Woods. The next Morning our Spies came in, and told us, they heard a Cow bellow. We soon came to the Plain, where we found above an hun∣dred, but these did not satisfy us; and there∣fore, well observing their Foot-steps, we trac'd them farther, and found eight or nine hundred. Here were two or three hundred Sheep, which we kill'd; the best of them we dress'd for Meat, and left the Others to rot. But we wanted Water, having had none for near two Days. At length, one of our Scouts discover'd a Pond of thick Water, where the Cattle us'd to drink; and this, hot and foul as it was, we eagerly drank; no better being to be got. Till this Time we saw no Enemies, tho' we expected them; for the Cow-herds fled from the Cattle in our Sight, no doubt, to alarm their Masters. And as some of us were taking up this Wa∣ter, as clean as we could, in our Calabashes,
<PB N="279" REF="299"/>
One of our Company was stooping down, wash∣ing his Lamber, a Volley of Shot was fir'd a∣mong us, before we perceiv'd any Body. We look'd up, and saw about eight or ten Men running back into the Wood, which was ex∣tended along on the other Side the Water, within three, or fourscore Yards. We fir'd some Shot at them, but they vanish'd out of Sight. There was none of us hurt, but the Man who was washing his Lamber, and he re∣ceiv'd a Shot in his Fundament; which instant∣ly kill'd him.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING I had been superstiti∣ously addicted to regard certain fix'd Cha∣racters, or Hieroglyphicks, when they happen'd to me in Dreams, (which was but seldom) and us'd to find they foretold Things to me: Yet I could not help observing, what a re∣markable Instance we had here, of the Vani∣ty of trusting to Dreams; and I did not fail to make Use of it to <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> and to turn their superstitious Praying to their <HI>Ow∣leys</HI> into Ridicule. For he seeing me come in a Hurry, and having heard Guns go off, ask'd, <HI>What News?</HI> <Q>“I told him, Nothing, but a Man was kill'd by the Order of his Gods. How! says the <HI>Deaan,</HI> by the Order of his Gods! What do you mean by that? Why, <HI>says I,</HI> a Man pray'd to his <HI>Owley</HI> last Night, and when he went to lye down, bid
<PB N="280" REF="300"/>
it be sure to come when he was asleep. Ac∣cording to his Desire, the <HI>Daemon,</HI> which at∣tends his <HI>Owley,</HI> came, and told him in a Dream; or which is all one, he dream'd he told him, That he must wash his Lamber the next Morning. In Obedience to this di∣vine Vision, he went along with us to the watering Place, having no other Business there, and stooping to wash his Lamber, was kill'd by a Shot, which he receiv'd in his Back-side, from some of our fugitive Ene∣mies; who fir'd, ran away, and hurt no o∣ther Man.”</Q> I had no Fear of <HI>Deaan Af∣ferrer</HI>'s being angry with me, Persecution for differing from them in Religion, is not yet thought of there.</P>
<P>I remember one Instance whilst I liv'd with <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> of a more stupid blind Bigot∣try than this. A young Man, who had an <HI>Owley,</HI> the <HI>Daemon</HI> of which, was call'd <HI>Ry-leffu.</HI> He pray'd one Night to him, and <HI>Ry-leffu</HI> came in a Dream, telling him, his Brother must shoot at him. Away he goes, early in the Morning, above an Hour's Walk to his Bro∣ther, telling his Dream, and desiring him to perform the Order of <HI>Ry-leffu.</HI> His Brother perswaded him against it, but the other re∣ply'd, It must be done; or worse will follow. Well, then <HI>says he,</HI> I will shoot towards you, and miss you. No, says the <HI>Devout-Man,</HI> it
<PB N="281" REF="301"/>
must be done according to Order, without Eva∣sion; and the <HI>Daemon</HI> will certainly defend me from Hurt. The Brother at length was over∣rul'd, and loads his Piece, but would stand about thirty Yards, and fire at his lower Parts; notwithstanding his Care he broke a Leg, and then reflecting on his own Credulity, to be wrought upon to do so much Damage, ran la∣menting to assist the wounded Bigot. In short, with the usual Means, but not without some of the Fat of a Sacrifice, which was laid on the <HI>Owley</HI> of <HI>Ry-leffu,</HI> he was cur'd; tho' he never perfectly recover'd the Use of his Leg.</P>
<P>WE drove our Cattle to the Sea-side, the same Way we came, by the Water's Edge, and went round that Bay, which is call'd <HI>St. John</HI>'s. I took good Notice of it; there is a Ridge of Rocks, which seem'd to me to extend quite thwart it, so as to leave no Entrance; but if there was a Channel wide enough for Ships to come in, it would be an excellent Harbour; for the Water is very smooth within. I heard that hereabouts on the Coast of <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Ship was cast away two or three Years before ours, and the People all murder'd; but the Rea∣son, or any Particulars thereof, I could not learn. They have no Canoes, neither here, nor in <HI>Anterndro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a;</HI> therefore they can have no Com∣merce with Ships: For they are People of the most treacherous Dispositions to white Men of
<PB N="282" REF="302"/>
any in the Island. Whether their little Ac∣quaintance with <HI>Europeans</HI> makes them afraid of them? I know they have Notions, that white Men are very much addicted to fighting, and are not so tender-hearted as themselves. This may be a great Reason of their destroying them for very slight Provocations; for they always think the white Men have some barbarous De∣signs on them. So that they are ever suspi∣cious, and on their Guard, dreading the daring Boldness and superior Skill the <HI>Europeans</HI> have of them in War.</P>
<P>As to their Mercy; where they have con∣quer'd them, as in <HI>Antenosa</HI> the <HI>French</HI> did, they made Slaves of them, inverted the whole Order of their Government; and being chiefly igno∣rant Seamen, who pretended thus to rule, they regarded neither Morality, Civility, nor com∣mon Decency, making no Distinction of Persons, confounding all Order, and treating every black Man as if he was a Brute, so much beneath themselves, as not to have a Claim in their Opi∣nions to the common natural Rights of human Creatures: So that killing them was no more than killing a Brute. I do not make this as a National Reflection on the <HI>French</HI> only, tho' were Credit to be giv'n to half what the Na∣tives say, there were many scandalous and hor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Things done: Our own Country-men are not to be exempted from the just Cause of this
<PB N="283" REF="303"/>
Scandal on white Men; for the Behaviour of <HI>English</HI> Pyrates, and others too, who are not willing to be call'd so, has been very barba∣rous. And in the Countries of <HI>Anterndroea</HI> and <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> where only strange Stories are told, and they have no experimental Knowledge to distinguish that wicked Men are the Production of every Land; and having here seen no good Ones, every white Man is look'd on as not less a Monster than we think a <HI>Cambal.</HI></P>
<P>WE return'd to our Camp with the Cattle four Days before <HI>Rer Befaugher,</HI> who also got a good Prize of Captives, which they discover'd by seeing a Smoak; they had Cattle too. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was impatient to be at Home, for fear <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> should go into his Country to plunder it; but <HI>Rer Mundrosser</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mus∣secoro</HI> would go in their Turn to see what they could get; and return'd with Slaves and Cattle. We had no Enemy all this While came near us, <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> staying in the Camp after we return'd. I told <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> I would go, aud see <HI>Deaan Sambo,</HI> as before; on Purpose to cover my Visit to the other. He treated me with the same Civility as at first; but while we were talking, in came one of <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s Slaves, and told me, his Master wanted to speak with me. I durst not go aside to speak privately to <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> before him, nor would I stay, as he would have had me; but
<PB N="284" REF="304"/>
went directly along with the Man, dreading ill Treatment. When I came, he was in a vio∣lent Passion, charging me with deceiving him; and asking, <Q>“Whether I went to agree about going away with them? However he would take Care I should not go out of <HI>Anterndroea.</HI> I might go any where among their Country∣men; but he would not part with me.”</Q> I found he would be my Master, tho' he was a much better than <HI>Deaan Mevarrow;</HI> for he neither offer'd to kill, or strike me. It was fourteen Days before <HI>Rer Mundrosser</HI> return'd; he also brought Slaves and Cattle. The Cattle were divided the next Day, and the Army march'd back into <HI>Anterndroea;</HI> for <HI>Deaan Crin∣do</HI> would not agree to let the <HI>Feraingher</HI> People go Home, till they had accompany'd him into his own Country out of Danger: Our Habita∣tion on <HI>Yong-gorvo</HI> Hills was in the Way. The Night before we parted, <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> with his Brother and Cousin, came to take their Leave of <HI>Deaan Afferrer;</HI> after some other Discourse he ask'd him, <HI>If he would part with his white Man, and he would give three Slaves for him.</HI> This was a handsome Price, but my Master, for so I must call him, said, <HI>He would not take three Times three for me:</HI> So no more was said, and <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> went away. I had an Opportu∣nity the next Morning, before they march'd, to see one of the <HI>Feraingher</HI> Men, and bid him
<PB N="285" REF="305"/>
tell his General, that I would be with them in three or four Days; for I was resolv'd to run away, and follow their Tracks. But I was pre∣vented at present, for being suspected, two Men were order'd never to let me go out of Sight, Night or Day, till we got Home; and for two Months after, I was never suffer'd to go any where without some Body with me.</P>
<P>BEFORE I take my Leave of <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> it will be but just to give my Readers an Ac∣count of what few Things I noted, and have not hitherto been describ'd; and which indeed, are but few, considering the many Things, which a curious Person would have employ'd himself in observing: But when it is consider'd how young I was when I came here, how I past the Prime of my Years in Slavery among these illiterate People, and the little or no Hopes I had of ever getting off the Island; I dare say it will not be expected I should at this Time have known what was worth a curious Person's Re∣gard. However, I shall not supply these Defects of mine, as many Travellers have done, with In∣ventions of their own; Things that were for the Use of Mankind I could not help knowing: What are in common with other Places, such as <HI>Bonana's, Plantanes, Monkies, Turtle,</HI> and an hundred other such like, I have no Occasion to describe here.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="306"/>
NEAR the Sea Side, there is no good Thing to be found, either on the Trees, or within the Earth, for at least three or four Miles; nothing but short prickly Wood, bearing no eatable Fruit. In the Country, there is great Variety of Fruit; among which, is a Currant, growing on a Tree, not a Bush, as in <HI>Europe;</HI> it is very pleasant. Here is a very large Tree, that bears a <HI>Plumb,</HI> which is black when ripe, and as big as a <HI>Cherry,</HI> with little Stones like Grapes: There are Thorns on the Tree two In∣ches long. Here is a Fruit like a <HI>Slow,</HI> growing also on a prickly Bush; but it is very sweet. Another Fruit grows on very tall Trees, speck∣led like a <HI>Sparrow</HI>'s Egg, and in the same Form, full of Seeds and a sweet Juice: It is held a certain Cure for <HI>Fluxes;</HI> the Leaf of it is like a <HI>Pear-Tree</HI> Leaf. Here is a Tree, whose Leaves, and tender Sprigs sting like Nettles: The Root of this is of great Use in Scarcity of Water, which is in a great many Parts of this Country; and this Root being spungy, it retains a great deal of Juice: We beat it in a wooden Mortar, (in which we beat our <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn)# and squeeze the Liquor out. The Bark of the Tree is good to make Ropes of. Here is good Wood for Building; as also <HI>Cedar</HI> and <HI>Ebony,</HI> but none fit to make Ship-Masts of. The Plains are well cover'd with several Sorts of Grass, and of dif∣ferent Colours; which grow to a much greater
<PB N="287" REF="307"/>
Height than any in <HI>England:</HI> They never cut any for Hay, for before the old is dead, new is sprung up under it; but they commonly set the old Grass on Fire. Here is also <HI>Tabacco,</HI> which is smoak'd in Reeds, or Shells, as some do the <HI>Jermaughla.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I was in <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Coun∣try, I went sometimes a fishing; but as I said before, they have no Canoes, so we only go on the Rocks, and fish with Hooks and Lines; ne∣ver with Nets. We us'd commonly to go by Night at low Water, with Lights, and take the Fish out of deep little Holes (Asleep as the Negroes say.) Here are a great many <HI>Lobsters</HI> and <HI>Craw-fish;</HI> they never run away when they see the Lights. We have also a sharp Pike made on Purpose to stick Fish. Here are <HI>Eels,</HI> also the <HI>Sword-Fish,</HI> and some such Fish as are common to other Countries in the same Climate; but many such as I never saw any where else. Here is one Fish, round like a <HI>Turnip,</HI> and full of Prickles, I suppose, it may be call'd the <HI>Sea-Hedge-hog;</HI> but in their Language it is call'd <HI>Sorer-reake.</HI> Here are also good <HI>Turtle.</HI></P>
<P>I never knew of any Beasts of Prey, such as <HI>Tygers, Lyons,</HI> &amp;c. the <HI>Wild Foxes, wild Boars,</HI> and <HI>wild Dogs</HI> are the worst we have in <HI>An∣terndroea.</HI> Here is a Creature of the <HI>Serpent</HI>-Kind and Form, very large: One of which I
<PB N="288" REF="308"/>
kill'd, by tearing its great Jaws asunder with my Hands; it was not venemous, nor did I ever know of a Serpent, which kill'd, or hurt any Man by its Venom, during the whole Time off my being here: They have bit People, and the same Hurt has accru'd, as is usual from the Bite of any Beast; and no worse.</P>
<P>WHILE I was in <HI>Yong-gorve,</HI> our Business and Diverston was chiefly hunting of wild Cattle; and here I observ'd the People call these Cat∣tle <HI>Hattoy's</HI> Cattle, or <HI>Anomebay Rer Hattoy:</HI> The Tradition they have of their Original is, that these Cattle belong'd to a great Man, call'd <HI>Rer Hattoy;</HI> and he being very covetous would kill none, but let them encrease, and run a∣bout where they would. He liv'd in the wild Forest, but his Family and People after his Death, went to live with a King of an Inland Dominion, call'd <HI>Ʋnt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>maroche;</HI> and left most of their Cattle behind. Others say, that <HI>Rer Hattoy</HI> was kill'd with most of his People, and the other Cattle being better esteem'd his were neglected; and being in the Forests, they en∣creas'd without Interruption: But this does not acconnt for the Way they came into the Island. This <HI>Hattoy,</HI> they all say, was a Na∣tive; so that I rather think these were the original Cattle of the Country, and the tame Beeves were imported; because on the Coast of <HI>Natal</HI> and <HI>Dilligoe</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> there are the
<PB N="289" REF="309"/>
same Cattle with Humpsion their Backs. These were preferr'd to the others, and bred up while <HI>Hattoy's</HI> were neglected: And what confirms this Opinion is, here are two Sorts of People, as if they were two distinct Species of Man∣kind; of which I shall have an Occasion to give a large Account in its proper Place.</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> had narrowly watch'd me for about two Months; till he thought the Track of the <HI>Feraingher</HI> Army was not to be found by the Grass being grown. He took me with him to hunt these <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cattle again; we had very good Sport, had it not ended tragi∣cally: For we kill'd five Cows, and were going a∣way, but a Bull ran off with a Lance in his Belly, and we not being willing to lose it ran after him; and stuck two or three more in his Sides When he felt his Wounds smart, he grew en∣rag'd, and turn'd to us. One bold Man threw another Lance, and hit him on the Back; he ran directly at the Man who hurt him, we hal∣lo'd to frighten him off; but he persu'd his Enemy, and overtaking him, toss'd him some Yards above his Head: The Ground was stony where he fell, and we durst not throw Lances for fear of hitting the Man, who was all this While endeavouring to rise; but the Bull push'd him down as often as he attempted it, tram∣pling on him with his Feet, and pushing with his Horns, he soon kill'd him; having broke
<PB N="290" REF="310"/>
his Ribs. When we saw the Man was dead, we threw more Lances, till the Bull fell down like a Log. I have known them fight so long, that they have been dead before they fell; hav∣ing fix'd their Feet wide, and dy'd standing so firm, that we have been forc'd to pull them down by the Tail. They were oblig'd to dress the Meat this Evening, because of going home the next Day with the Corps of their Neigh∣bour. After we had roasted the Beef, and supp'd, we made up our <HI>Enters</HI> against the next Morning. I pack'd up as much as I could well carry; for I was resolv'd to go away this Night. I laid down when the rest did, but could not sleep for thinking of the hazardous Journey I was going to undertake. Every One else slept sound, being tyr'd and their Bellies full; so that about Midnight I took up my Burden, and walk'd away, directing my Course to the North∣ward, not without recommending myself to God's Providence to be my Conducter.</P>
<P>THE Direction I had from <HI>Ry-Nanno,</HI> and which, I found on Enquiry from others, was to go to the Southward, till I came to <HI>Vohitch futey,</HI> and leave it on my right Hand, di∣recting my Course between the North and West, till I came to the great River <HI>Oneghaloyhe,</HI> which goes to <HI>St. Augustine Bay;</HI> then keep a∣long the River, till I should see High-land run∣ning along the Western-most Parts of the Fo∣rest;
<PB N="291" REF="311"/>
and then pass over the River, and go a∣way to the Westward.</P>
<P>I walk'd very hard all Night, and when Day appear'd I saw the white Mountains very near: By this I found, I had made a great Progress, and therefore would not hide myself as I at first design'd; but proceeded on my Journey, looking well about me, conceiving how hard it would be for them to overtake, and find me, if they attempted it. I went very mer∣rily on, singing <HI>Madagascar</HI> Songs; for I had forgot to sing in <HI>English.</HI> The Noise of the wild Cattle would sometimes make me start, thinking they were my Pursuers. I came to a pleasant Brook, where I baited; and at Sun∣set look'd out for a Covert in a Thicket to lye in; I found none but what was too far out of my Way: So I contented myself with lying in the open Plain, pulling up Grass for a Bed, and a Stone-pillow; making a small Fire to warm my Beef. I durst not make a great One, for fear of being espy'd at a Distance; for in the Afternoon I could discern some Fires to the Eastward of the Mountain. I was disturb'd in my Sleep by Night-walkers, whom I took for furious Pursuers, and accordingly took up my Lances to defend myself; but when I was perfectly awake, I found they were only some of the Inhabitants of the Forest, <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cat∣tle, snorting at the Smell of my Fire, and
<PB N="292" REF="312"/>
ran away much more afraid of me than I of them.</P>
<P>THE second Day in the Morning I stay'd till the Sun appear'd before I went forward, that I might know how to steer my Course; for being abreast of <HI>Vohitch futey,</HI> I walk'd more moderately; and tho' I was out of Danger of being overtaken by <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s People, yet I did not know what other Men might be in the Forest hunting of Beeves; so that I was very circumspect. Nothing remarkable hap∣pen'd this Day, I look'd out for a Lodging ear∣ly this Evening, seeing the Clouds gather'd black, and found a large thick Tree, where I made a Fire, warm'd some Meat, and hung up the rest to keep it as dry as I could; for I had nothing else that the Rain could hurt. At length it came as I expected, in a violent Man∣ner, with Thunder and Lightning; it soon came thorow my Roof, I crouded myself to∣gether, with my Head on my Knees, my Hands betwixt my Legs, and my little Lamber co∣ver'd my Ears. The Rain ran down like a Flood, but it being warm I did not much re∣gard it; in three or four Hours it was fair Weather, and I laid down, and slept sound.</P>
<P>THE next Morning I dry'd my Beef at a Fire, which I made on Purpose; for it was the third Day since it was kill'd; but I was very careful of it, not knowing how to kill more at
<PB N="293" REF="313"/>
that Time: So I made it up in clean Grass, and went forward. The Mountains, over which I was to pass, seem'd very high, craggy, and thick with Wood, and no Path nor Opening to be found: It look'd somewhat dismal, but I was resolutely bent to run all Hazards. Those Mountains seem'd to me to run quite thwart the Island, and appear'd like, what we call at Sea, <HI>Double Land;</HI> one Hill behind another. I saw nothing all this Day but wild Cattle, and now and then a wild dog; it was fair Weather, and I slept sound this Night.</P>
<P>THE fourth Day I walk'd till Noon, when I baited to dine; my Beef was now very in∣different: As I was walking forward in the Af∣ternoon, I saw about a dozen Men before me; I skulk'd in a Bush, peeping to see if they had discover'd me; but was soon out of my Pain, observing them surrounding some Cattle a good Way to the Westward on a Hill. I was also on another Hill, so that I perceiv'd them throw their Lances, and discern'd three Beeves fall; which, I was sure, were more than they could carry away at one. I stay'd where I was, re∣solving when they were gone to have some Beef. They soon fell to Work, cutting up the Beasts, and making every Man his Burden, hanging the rest up in a Tree, that the wild Dogs should not get it, and went Home to the Eastward. When they were gone, and I
<PB N="294" REF="314"/>
had look'd well about me, I threw away my stinking Meat, went to the Tree, and took as much as I could well carry; with which I march'd toward the Mountains, not daring to rest for fear they should return, and espy me. In an Hour's Time I got to the Foot of the Hills in the thick Woods, and seeing no Path, nor Track of Men, nor any Hopes of finding any, not knowing which Way to look for one, I resolv'd to go thorow all; but happening on a Run of Water, I took up my Quarters near it, made a Fire, cut some wooden Spits, and roasted my Beef; I kept my Fire burning all Night, for fear the Foxes should come, and attack me.</P>
<P>THE next Morning I made up my <HI>Enter</HI> with Grass, binding it with Bark of Trees, and pro∣ceeded up the Hill: My Burden was now much lighter. I got to the Top in an Hour, tho' I found no Path but what Swine had made; which was not always in my Way. I per∣ceiv'd here was <HI>Faungidge</HI> and <HI>Verlaway</HI> enough, which pleas'd me, tho' I did not at present want it. I climb'd a high Tree to look about me, but could discover no Entrance: Nothing but Hills and Vales one beyond another; a cragged dismal Wilderness was all which pre∣sented itself to my View. I would have gone down again, had there not been Danger of be∣ing seen by the Hunters; besides I could not
<PB N="295" REF="315"/>
tell whether to look East or West for the Pas∣sage; so setting a Lance up an End, I turn'd the Way it fell, tho' I thought it was due North, or rather a little to the Eastward. However, Superstition prevail'd where Reason had no∣thing to offer; for I was as likely to be right that Way as any other; and if I went to the Northward, so long as I knew it, I must go when I could to the Westward, as Sailors are forc'd to do sometimes, run their Latitude first, and their Longitude after. I went down this Hill, and up another, which took me a∣bout an Hour's Walk; but when I came to descend this, it was steep right up and down. I unwarily threw down my Lances, Hatchet, and Burden, thinking to go down by a very tall Tree, whose Top-Branches just reach'd close to the Brow, but could not do it; yet rather than lose my Lances, I made Ropes of the Bark of a Tree, and fastning them to the strongest Branches, slid down, I dare say, not less than thirty Foot. I pass'd over a fine Spring, and Run of Water in the Vale, the Hill on the other Side was a craggy steep Rock; however I found a Way to ascend, and on the Top climb'd a Tree again; but there was the same dismal Prospect. Here I dug <HI>Faungidge,</HI> it being Sun-set, and espying a Hole in a large Rock, I design'd to take up my Lodging there; but peeping in, of a sudden I heard such an
<PB N="296" REF="316"/>
Outcry, which, with the Eccho in the Rock, made so confus'd a Noise, that I knew not what to make of it. My Fears prevail'd, and I imagin'd Pursuers and Enemies; for it drew nearer: So setting my Back to a Tree, with my two Lances in my Hand, I waited for the Murderers, when immediately came squeaking toward me a Herd of wild Swine; who ran away as much frighted as myself. When I had recover'd my Senses, I made two Fires for fear of Foxes, and laid down on my hard Bed; for here was no Grass, and a stony Place.</P>
<P>THE next Morning, which was the sixth Day, I made a very good Breakfast with <HI>Faun∣gidge</HI> and Bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the Hill extending North and South, I went strait on till it gradually declin'd into a Valley, in which was a small River running Westward: And I am apt to think it was the Head of <HI>Manner-ronder,</HI> near which we fought <HI>Deaan <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ington.</HI> By that Time I arriv'd to the Top of the next Hill it was near Evening; for I was not much less than two Hours ascending it; and yet I went no small Pace considering my Burden, tho' it was not very heavy now. As I was looking out for the best Lodging, that is a Place with the fairest Stones in it, I espy'd a Swarm of Bees; this was a joyful Sight, for it was Food that wou'd not corrupt with keeping: I soon cut down a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to put the Honey in▪ and smoak'd them out.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="317"/>
I made such an hearty, and agreable Supper this Night, with Honey, Faungidge, and Beef, that I slept too sound; even till I was wak'd with a severe Correction, for my thoughtless Security. A <HI>Fox</HI> had got hold of my Heel, and was for dragging me along; I startl'd, and catching a Fire-brand, gave him a blow, which stagger'd him; but he recovering, flew at my Face. I was up an end by this Time, and re∣cover'd one of my Lances, with which, I pre∣vented his ever assaulting me again; but he made such a Howling, as brought several more about him. I saw three, with their Eyes spark∣ling, but they kept at a Distance; for I soon made a Blaze, with some light dry Wood I had laid near me, on Purpose to keep a Flame all Night; but did not wake to renew it, as I should have done: So that my two Fires, being re∣duc'd to Embers, one of them ventur'd between them; and, it is well, he did not seize my Throat first; for I have known such an Accident, when Men have negligently slept where they haunt. After I had made up my Fires, and drove away my Enemies, I examin'd my Heel, and found two Holes on each Side, made by his Teeth; I bound it up with a piece of my Lam∣ber, as well as I could; and making a great Fire, threw the <HI>Fox</HI> upon it by Way of Re∣venge. I had none of that Pleasure in eating my Breakfast this Morning, as I had in my last
<PB N="298" REF="318"/>
Night's Supper. Besides, my Beef was a little too tender now; but as I had Honey enough for a Week, and Faungidge easy to be found, I did not much trouble myself.</P>
<P>I walk'd on this seventh Day, favouring my lame Foot, resting once only all Day: This Way happen'd to be plain, and easy. At Eve∣ning, I came to a Place where several Bodies of Trees, dead and dry, lay: This I thought was a proper Lodging; so making four Fires, very large, I sat me down to Supper, and ven∣tur'd to sleep with my Fires round me; but my Heel now pain'd me extreamly, and was much swell'd, so that I could not go forward the next Day; but finding Faungidge within twenty, or thirty Yards of me, I digg'd several, and contented myself to remain here till my Foot should be better. My Beef was soon gone, but Faungidge was both Water and Food. I sav'd some of my Beef-fat, to dress my Heel with; which, with the Rest I gave it, in six Days, took away all the Swelling; for so long I remain'd here. During which Time I made such large Fires by Night, that if they could have been seen, were like those of a great Ar∣my. I had not far to go for Wood, or any thing else which I wanted; or at least, which I could hope for here.</P>
<P>AFTER this six Days Peest, it being the four∣teenth since I left <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> I went for∣ward,
<PB N="299" REF="319"/>
and pass'd over three very high Hills that Day. My Honey was now gone, and I could find no more; so that Faungidge was my Diet.</P>
<P>THE fifteenth Day I walk'd very stoutly a∣gain, and pass'd over several rough, craggy Hills, which were very tiresome. I always took Care to get dry Wood enough, for I never lay down without four Fires.</P>
<P>THE sixteenth Day, I had not travel'd three Hours, when I perceiv'd the Earth to be of ano∣ther Colour: It was Chalky before, and now Clay. This excited my Curiosity, to climb the first high Tree I could, from which I discover'd an Opening to the Northward, which gave me no little Pleasure; but it was at a greater Di∣stance than I could reach that Night; so I took up my Lodging as before. I was disturb'd this Night by a Herd of wild Swine.</P>
<P>THE seventeenth Day I walk'd very hard, being in haste to get thorow this Wilderness: It was still up, and down Hills. About Noon I got into the open Country, and could look a∣bout with Pleasure, and walk on level Ground. I was like a Man deliver'd from a Prison, hav∣ing been twelve Days in this mountainous Wil∣derness. I was almost six Days actually tra∣veling, and I think, I did not walk less than twenty Miles a Day: It might have been pass'd in three Days, if I had been so fortunate as to have found the Path.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="320"/>
I had not been long in the Plain, before I ar∣riv'd at a little Wood, where I took up my Lodging; because here was Firing enough, and Faungidge, which I was not a little glad to see; having been in some Fear of wanting Provision in the Plains: But I had yet a far greater Hope of being supplied, for I was wak'd in the Night by the Roaring of a Bull, by which I found myself sure it was the great Northern Forest of wild Cattle which <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> had told me of.</P>
<P>THE next Day, which was the eighteenth, I saw several Herds of <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cattle; and found here were more than in the Southern Forest. I look'd about me, to see if I could discover Hunters, or if I could observe the Crows to hover about any particular Place; for I might then expect a Beast, who had been wounded, was fallen there. In the Afternoon I came to a River, which was deep and large: As I was seeking for a Place to wade, or swim over, I saw a large <HI>Alligator:</HI> I still walk'd on the Banks, and saw three more. This was a mortifying Sight, and almost dispirited me. I walk'd till I came to a shallower Place, and went into the River about ten Yards, thinking to have swam over the rest in four or five Mi∣nutes; but before I swam, I espy'd an <HI>Alli∣gator</HI> making toward me. I ran back, and he
<PB N="301" REF="321"/>
pursu'd, till I got into very shallow Water, and then he return'd into the deep; for they never attack a Man on Shore. It vex'd me to be stopt by a River, not above an hundred Yards over. At length, I remembred when I was at <HI>Bengall,</HI> where are the largest <HI>Alligators</HI> in the World, and who have been so bold, as to take a Man▪out of a shallow Boat; that if we came off from the Shore in the Night, we made a small Fire at the Head, and another at the Stern of the Boat, which the <HI>Alligator</HI> would not come near. Distress puts a Man on Inven∣tion, something like this must be done; for here was no dwelling, nor going back: So choos∣ing a Stick fit for a Fire-brand, I cut it into long Splinters, and waited till it was almost dark; then binding my two Fire-sticks to the top of one of my Lances, with the two Lances and Hatchet in one Hand, my Fire-brand burn∣ing in the other, and my Lamber twisted, and ty'd fast about my Lances, I went into the Water (recommending myself to Providence) turn'd on my Back, and swam over.</P>
<P>THE Place where I chose to swim over had a Gap thorow the Thickets on each Side over against one another; which made it look like an accustom'd Passage, either for Men, or Cat∣tle. I was no sooner landed, than I heard some wild Cattle feeding; so speedily extinguishing my Fire, and silently washing myself, that they
<PB N="302" REF="322"/>
should not smell me, I stood close under Cover of a thick Bush in the Passage, where I expect∣ed they would come to drink. The Wind was fortunately with them, by which Means, they could not scent me; tho' they snorted often to smell for Enemies. I stood ready with my Lance, and did not wait long before a vast Herd came, running thorow the Passage to the River; and as they went, I push'd my Lance, as force∣ably as I was able, into above forty of them; endeavouring to hit them in the Belly. They ran roaring, fighting, and pushing one another, as it were to revenge the Blows they felt; not expecting any other Enemies, but what were a∣mongst themselves. I thought I had wounded enow, and hop'd some would prove mortal; but would not run any Hazard by Night, con∣tenting myself to stay without Roast-meat this Evening; securing myself from their Attacks in a thick Wood. The next Morning, when I went to see what Execution I had done, I found one Bull, and three Cows on the Sand: I soon cut up the youngest, and fattest, carry∣ing it to my Quarters; near which I made an Oven to bake it. This is common, tho' I have not before describ'd it; but it is thus made: <Q>“A Hole is dug, about five Foot long, two over, and about three deep: This is fill'd with Wood, and kindled; on the top of the Fire, I put about a dozen great Stones,
<PB N="303" REF="323"/>
which might weigh each a Pound. While the Fire was burning, I cut the Bark off the Tree <HI>Succore,</HI> took the outer Part away, and the inner being pliable, and lying flat, I made the Cover of the Oven. When the Fire is burnt to Embers, I laid three, or four green Sticks a-cross for my Beef to rest on; the Stones being red-hot, were plac'd about the Bottom and Sides; over the Top more Sticks, and then the Bark covering all close with the Earth. This is our manner of bak∣ing Meat in the Forests.”</Q> I broil'd some for my Breakfast, and then went out, to see if I had done any more Execution, and found six more Beeves dead, up and down the Plain; but I had enough here. When I came back my Beef was bak'd, and as well done, as it would have been at any Baker's in <HI>London.</HI> When it was cold, I made it up in an <HI>Enter,</HI> but went no farther this Day.</P>
<P>THE next Morning, which was the twentieth since my setting out, I went forward well pleas'd with my Load: I discover'd Smoak to the East∣ward, but saw no People; wild Cattle here were many Herds: There being several little Woods in this Plain, I never wanted a Covert for a Lodging, nor Grass to make a tolerable soft Bed on. The Country was pleasant, and Travelling easie; insomuch that I resolv'd, if it should be my Misfortune, to meet with as
<PB N="304" REF="324"/>
bad a Master as <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> and no hopes of getting to <HI>England,</HI> that I would run away, and live by myself in this Forest.</P>
<P>THE twenty-first Day in the Morning I saw several wild Dogs fighting, and pulling down a Bull, whom I suppose, had been wounded before; for I never knew the Dogs attack-them else. I had no Business to interrupt them, and if I had, it would have been very dangerous; for tho' they do not seek out, and assault a Man, yet on Provocation they have been known to de∣stroy Men. This Night was the first time I ever felt <HI>Musquettoes</HI> in the Island; for lying in the Evening in a Covert, near a Run of Water, they so stung me, that I was forc'd to shift my Lodgings; and being Moon-light, I got up, and walk'd three, or four Miles far∣ther to the top of a Hill; where I rested qui∣etly. I had no Occasion to light above one Fire, for here was very little Danger of wild Beasts.</P>
<P>THE twenty-second Day I discover'd a Fog in one long Canal from East to West; which continuing all Day, and at a vast Distance, I conceiv▪d it to hang over the great River <HI>Oneghaloyhe,</HI> which runs into <HI>Augustine-Bay.</HI> This put new Vigour into me, to think I was ap∣proaching to a Sea-port: I saw two Men this Day carrying Beef, and would have spoke with them; but they dropt their <HI>Enters,</HI> and
<PB N="305" REF="325"/>
ran from me, tho' I call'd, and laid down mine, and went towards them. When they thought I was gone, I saw them return, and take up their Beef again.</P>
<P>THE twenty-third Day in the Morning, I saw the Fog again, which look'd much nearer. I walk'd very hard, being desirous to come to the River, tho' it was Afternoon before I arriv'd within a Mile of it; and then the Bushes, and thorny small Wood, were so thick, that it was with great Difficulty, and many Rents in my Skin, that I got to the River∣side. When I saw the vast Breadth of the Ri∣ver I was surpris'd; for I dare say, it was not less than twice as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> I had been inform'd, that near the Head of it a Man might wade over; but they al∣ways had Canoes to transport themselves over other Parts; whether they sent them up the River before, or where they got them I know not; I had no such Help. I made my Fire, went to Supper, and laid down to sleep, or rather to consider of some Invention to get o∣ver. In the Morning I resolv'd to look for some old Trees fallen, or Branches, and in a few Hours happen'd on some fit for my Pur∣pose; some Bodies of Trees, and great Arms broke off by Tempests: These I dragg'd down to the River-side, next I sought for a strong Creeper, which is as large as withy, but twi∣ning
<PB N="306" REF="326"/>
round Trees, is pliable: I cut the super∣fluous Branches off of six long and thick Arms of the Trees, and placing three above the other three, I bound them together, making what is call'd in the <HI>East Indies</HI> a <HI>Cattama<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an.</HI> I built it afloat in the Water, or I could not have launch'd it, and moor'd it to a Lance, which I stuck in the Shore on Purpose; I then fix'd my <HI>Enter</HI> to preserve it as dry as I cou'd, also my Hatchet and the other Lance; then I made a Paddle to row with, and pulling up my Lance, I kept it in my Hand to defend myself against the <HI>Alligators,</HI> if they should assault me; for I was inform'd they were very fierce here. It blow'd a fresh Gale at West against the Stream, which in the Middle made a Sea, that did not a little terrify me; fearing I should be over-set, and become a Prey to the <HI>Alligators.</HI> However it pleas'd God to protect me, and I arriv'd safe on the other Side, I thought I had made a very good Days Work; so went but little further that Evening before I took up my Lodging.</P>
<P>THE twenty fourth Day I travell'd a great Way, nothing remarkable happen'd: I saw a few wild Cattle, but not so many as on the other Side the River; and those I saw were more shy than in the Forest, by which I sup∣pos'd it to be an inhabited Country.</P>
<P>THE twenty fifth Day my Burden grew light, and began to smell; but I did not much trou∣ble
<PB N="307" REF="327"/>
myself at that, being resolv'd to speak with the first People I could see: For I remember'd that <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> told me his Town was close to this River on the North-side. I pass'd tho∣row a fordable River, which runs into the great One: This is a most pleasant Country, here are abundance of <HI>Palmettoe</HI> Trees; which in their Language are call'd <HI>Satter-futey.</HI> They bear a long Leaf like a <HI>Cocoanut</HI> Tree, but ano∣ther Sort of Fruit; of these Leaves the People make <HI>Baskets, Caps,</HI> &amp;c. I saw no wild Cattle all this Day.</P>
<P>THE twenty sixth Day I walk'd very hard, baited in the Heat of the Day, and in the Af∣ternoon going forward again I espy'd a Smoak, and being resolv'd to speak with those who made it I mended my Pace; lest they should be only Passengers, who baited as I did, and would be gone; but I soon heard Childrens Tongues. At the Instant they saw me, they ran into the Wood where I had seen the Smoak, and im∣mediately came out three Men arm'd with Guns and Lances. I look'd behind me for a Shelter, not knowing what to think of them, and retir'd back a little; which they perceiving left their Guns with the Children, and came toward me▪ I then went to meet them, and call'd at a Di∣stance, to know what King they belong'd to? They answer'd <HI>Deaan Mernaugha;</HI> and as a fur∣ther Token seeing me a white Man, spoke two
<PB N="308" REF="328"/>
or three Words in broken <HI>English.</HI> They then ap∣proach'd near, and we shook Hands, saluting one another with the usual Compliment <HI>Salamonger:</HI> They desir'd me to go with them to their Cot∣tages, where we sat down, and I gave them an Account of my Travels. They said they had heard of me, and having <HI>Susers</HI> boiling, they desir'd me to eat with them: After which I enquir'd of the News of the Country relating to their Trade, War, and Peace; and one of them gave me the following melancholy Ac∣count of it.</P>
<P><Q>“”THAT their late King, <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> had kill'd himself with Grief at an Invasion, which <HI>Rer Trimmenongarevo</HI> made with nine thousand Men, and took his two Daughters captive. <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> follow'd him with se∣ven thousand, but the other by a Stratagem the mean Time got privately into <HI>Ferangher,</HI> and plunder'd it; <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> at the same Time attack'd the Southern Parts, hav∣ing made Canoes, and pass'd the great River, the other Passages being stopp'd: He took also a great many People, but <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> and his Brother <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> who remain'd at Home with two thousand Men, routed him, and prevented his carrying away the Captives; which so enrag'd <HI>Woozington</HI>'s barbarous Dis∣position, that he slew a great many Women and Children. <HI>Rer Trimmenongarevo</HI> took a
<PB N="309" REF="329"/>
contrary Method, for he sent Messages in∣viting the People to come, and live in his Country, and be his Subjects, and he would give them their Wives and Children again; which Promise he perform'd, and still conti∣nues, so that many hundreds are gone away: And he still embarrasses us so much, that we who are not willing to leave our Native Country, are many of us forc'd to fly into these Forests, and lonely Places, to be safe; contenting ourselves with what the Country produces naturally, as you see we do: For we dare not plant, nor keep Cattle, for fear of being surpris'd. We have another petty King in the Mountains, who takes this Op∣portunity to make Inroads, and helps to im∣poverish us, so that we are surrounded with Enemies; and those who remain in Towns are almost famish'd: For we have no Friends but white Men, and there has been no Ship come a long Time; and when they know our Poverty they will come no more. Thus This, which was lately the most flourishing Kingdom in the Island, is reduc'd to almost nothing.</Q></P>
<P>THIS melancholy Story so shock'd me, that I sat mute and stupid, till the Man perceiving it rous'd me by asking my Name; and if I would not go to the King first before I went to <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> as (they said) was my Duty: But I
<PB N="310" REF="330"/>
told them I was a Freeman, and would do as I had already acquainted them; so giving me a Mat I lay down, thinking of the hard Fate which prosecuted me; but as Providence had conducted me hitherto, I did not doubt, in due Time, my Deliverance would be perfected; and with this Resignation I went to sleep.</P>
<P>THESE Men were very civil to me, desiring I would stay two or three Days; but I only break-fasted there, giving them some Beef which they wanted; tho' mine was far from good. When they found I would stay no lon∣ger, they made me up a Bundle of roasted <HI>Su∣sers</HI> to carry with me, and accompany'd me till I got into the Path; shewing me how to find these <HI>Susers,</HI> which till then I had not seen: They grow like <HI>Wild Yams.</HI> Here were also <HI>Berbows</HI> and <HI>Wild Yams,</HI> which were their principal Food; this was the twenty seventh Day of my Travels. I turn'd out of the Path into a Wood, looking for such an Inn as had serv'd me many a Night before; which I soon found, made a Fire, supp'd, and slept very con∣tentedly.</P>
<P>THE next Morning I met four Men, who told me I could not reach <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s Town; but I might <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI>'s, and he would send a Man with me. My Way lay over a high Hill, from whence I saw the Sea, and the Road, where the Ships us'd to lye in <HI>Augustine</HI>
<PB N="311" REF="331"/>
<HI>Bay;</HI> on the other hand the great River, and the Country very pleasant along its Banks: When I came to the Bottom, some Boys, who look'd after Cattle, came running to me, for they are not afraid of white Men; and one of them very civilly would go, and shew me the Way to the Town. When I came there the People star'd at me, wondring what sort of a white Man I was without Cloaths; some said <HI>a Ship was arriv'd;</HI> but most said, <HI>I could not come from a Ship naked, and without a Hat.</HI> When I came near <HI>Rer Ba∣faugher</HI>'s House, I saw him look at me, not know∣ing me at first; but when I came nearer he got up from his Seat, clapp'd his Hand to his Mouth, and cry'd, <HI>Ah!</HI> Ry-Robin, <HI>how came you here?</HI> He embrac'd me as if I had been his Brother. When I was seated several came about me, some who knew me in the Army, ask'd me, <HI>Who ac∣company'd me?</HI> and wonder'd how I could find the Way alone: But when I told them how I miss'd the Way, and came thorow the moun∣tainous Wilderness, and of my Inventions to pass the Rivers, they were surpris'd.</P>
<P><HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> took me into his House, and at Supper we eat out of one Dish; he had roast Beef, and his Wife brought Milk on Purpose for me. I ask'd him about the State of the Country, and he gave me much the same Ac∣count I had before; adding, <Q>“”He expected eve∣ry Day when <HI>Rer Trimmenongarevo</HI> would
<PB N="312" REF="332"/>
come, and take the whole Country; for they had no Force able to resist him; however, they, who were the Pillars of the Land, would stand till they were cut down by Death, and not fly: For indeed, <HI>said he,</HI> we have no where to go but into the Sea; and we don't understand living there as you white Men do.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN we had supp'd, and talk'd till I was sleepy, he sent a Man with me to a House pre∣par'd on Purpose. The next Morning I desir'd he would please to send a Man to shew me the Way to <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s; but he would go him∣self. I told him <HI>It was beneath his Dignity to at∣tend a Slave as I was.</HI> He said, <Q>“He never thought white Men Slaves; and that he had waited on many: And <HI>Rer Vovvern,</HI> and he too had taken Care of some, cloathing and main∣taining them, tho' they did not deserve it; but they did it for the sake of others: For, <HI>says he,</HI> here come some very bad People, who quarrel with one another, and come ashoar, and never go aboard again; behaving them∣selves very ill.”</Q> <HI>I ask'd him,</HI> <Q>What they “tra∣ded for here? <HI>He said,</HI> Nothing but Provision; for which they gave them Gold and Silver Money, and sometimes Pieces of Silk, and when they sail away no One knows to what Country they go; nor themselves neither: For they are wicked, careless Wretches, and all their Business is to rob other Ships. <HI>I
<PB N="313" REF="333"/>
told him,</HI> They did not do well to assist them, or sell them Provision; and that the Go∣vernment of <HI>England</HI> was at a great Charge to fit out Ships on Purpose to destroy them; for they spoil the Merchants Trade, and were a Scandal to their Country. <HI>He said,</HI> The Generality of the <HI>English</HI> were good People, and by the Trade they drove with them were a great Benefit to the Country; that he had been on board some Ships, and found some Captains were honest Men, for they us'd to treat him very civilly, and give him <HI>Wine, Punch,</HI> and <HI>Brandy,</HI> and sometimes they had another Liquor, which was very bitter, they lov'd it themselves; it was ty'd down with Iron, but he had forgot the Name. <HI>I told him,</HI> It was Beer. <HI>He said,</HI> Yes; but he could never drink it.”</Q> Thus we went chatting all the Way to <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s, which was about two Hour's Walk: When we came to the Town the People flock'd about me, some saying <HI>a Samb-Tuley,</HI> which is, <HI>A Ship was arriv'd;</HI> but others said <HI>No; for Men come not naked from a Ship.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I came before <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> I found he did not know me; I offer'd to kneel, and lick his Feet, but he would not suffer me: <HI>Say∣ing,</HI> Let him be who he will, he is a white Man; and they shall never lick black Mens Feet. At length, his Brother told him who I was; he no sooner heard it than he rose, and embrac'd me
<PB N="314" REF="334"/>
with a great deal of Joy, and Friendship, and after setting down, and giving them an Account of my Travels, and some Admirations had been made, <HI>He told me,</HI> I was still very unfor∣tunate; for they were in a very poor Condition, and I should be disappointed if I expected to live happy here. I told him, it could not be worse than it had been with me hitherto; and I was resolv'd to live with him, and serve him, if he pleas'd to accept of my Service, as long as I liv'd, unless he would be so good as to send me Home, when a Ship came. <HI>He told me,</HI> I should fare as himself; for he look'd on it as his Duty to relieve a distressed white Man, for the Benefit he, and his Family had receiv'd by my Country-men. In short, he receiv'd me with that Affection, and treated me with so much Ten∣derness, that my own Father could not have shew'd more Compassion: He lamented very much the Calamity of his Country, and <HI>said,</HI> He was afraid the white Men would know it, and not come to Trade with them, and give him an Opportunity of sending me Home.</P>
<P>AFTER I had eaten, and drank with him, he took his Leave of his Brother, being oblig'd to go with other People to guard the Slaves who were at Work in the Plantations; lest they should be surpris'd, and taken by small Parties of their Northern Enemy, who skulk'd in co∣vert Places, on Purpose to sally out, and carry
<PB N="315" REF="335"/>
off what they could get on a sudden, and run away again. A little Way out of Town, we came to a large Thicket of <HI>wild Canes, Reeds,</HI> and <HI>Rushes;</HI> in which were the Plantations, bounded on the other Side with the great Ri∣ver <HI>Oneghaloyhe.</HI> Here were <HI>Plantins, Bonanoes, Sugar-Canes,</HI> and <HI>Rice;</HI> all these were not com∣mon to the Southern Country from whence I came; but here were also a great many Things which I had seen before; as <HI>Anbotty, An∣choroko,</HI> &amp;c. These were all newly planted, and sow'd; for the Enemy had destroy'd all the Plantations in the In-road they made, whilst <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> &amp;c. were in the late War in <HI>Merfaughla.</HI> I was in some Fear he was going to set me to Work; but this was soon dissi∣pated, when he gave me his Gun, and <HI>told me,</HI> since I was willing to call myself his Servant, all he would require of me, should be to carry his Gun; and take Care, when I had it, never to be the length of it from him, that he might reach it in Case of a Surprise.</P>
<P>AS we went homewards, some of our Peo∣ple climb'd up <HI>Tamarind</HI> Trees, and gather'd a great deal of the Fruit. I ask'd them what they did with it. They said, <HI>Eat it.</HI> I told them, <HI>It was impossible to eat much of it, without setting their Teeth on Edge.</HI> Says they, <HI>It is sour enough, indeed, if we do not put Ashes to it to make it sweet.</HI> I laugh'd at them for their Ig∣norance,
<PB N="316" REF="336"/>
but when I came Home, there were Flatters full of it mix'd for our Supper: The Strings of the <HI>Tamarinds</HI> appearing in it, and being white, when thus mix'd, I could not for∣bear thinking it like Mortar with Hair in it; but tasting, I found it as they said, very sweet: Nevertheless, I could not be reconcil'd to it at first, being prepossess'd, as Men too often are, even against the Testimony of their Senses. <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> seeing the Grimace I made, told me, <HI>That this was always held a pleasant Dish, when they had the greatest plenty of other Things.</HI> Now, indeed, says he, <HI>We have sometimes nothing else to eat.</HI> I have seen many unexpected strange, and odd Things eaten; but nothing ever sur∣pris'd me so much, as sour <HI>Tamarinds,</HI> mix'd with wood Ashes, becoming sweet, and eatable. Let the Chymists reason, and philosophize upon it at their Leisure, I do assure them of the Truth of the Fact, and can bring some Gentlemen, now living in <HI>London</HI> to testify the same, that have seen me mix it. It did not well agree with me the first time I eat it, making a rumbling Disorder in my Stomach: I suppose it fermented there; but after I was was us'd to it, I never found any Inconveni∣ence attend it.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> had two Wives, each hav∣ing a House to herself: He divided himself pretty equally between them, living near as
<PB N="317" REF="337"/>
much at the one House, as at the other, for Peace-sake: Now it is usual for them to appoint every Slave his proper Mistress, whose Com∣mands he is to attend; and she is to see what they want, and give it them. He did not ap∣point me any such Service, but said, I was a distressed Man, cast by Providence amongst them, and it was their Duty to provide for such; but he had a more particular Regard to me, for the sake of my Fathers, and Brothers (meaning <HI>Englishmen)</HI> and he had therefore or∣der'd that I should be taken Care of at both their Houses, and therefore bid me go to them at my Pleasure, where I found the best Provision; and as long as there was Meat, I had my Part with them. I observ'd, notwithstanding, he be∣hav'd himself with Decency to them both, yet his first Wife had some Preference to the other; and we therefore distinguish'd her by the Title of his <HI>Head-Wife.</HI> He was at her House, when I first came, and when he gave these Directions; so she immediately furnish'd me with a Pot or two, Callabash, &amp;c. for my Use; but having not all I wanted, he sent a Man with me to the Other, and she as readily supplied me with what I had Occasion for, chiding me in a friendly Manner, for not coming sooner to see her; so I sat down, and had half an Hour's Conversa∣tion with her, they both behaving themselves with great Civility to me.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="338"/>
THE next Morning came two Messengers from <HI>Deaan Mernaugha:</HI> The King desiring <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> to go, and consult with him on Affairs of Importance. They were going away, but notwithstanding, it was such a scarce Time, he would not let them depart till he had kill'd a Heifer to entertain them with. And here as in <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> I found the same generous Man∣ner of Treating one another; for most of the People in Town came near the House, and none went away without a Piece of Beef. They have but a slovenly Way of dressing their Meat here; for the Liver, as soon as it was taken out, was thrown into the midst of the Fire, and broil'd in the Ashes, and Smoak; and the Entrails with very little cleaning were broil'd: I had a Piece of Beef given me to dress at Home, and we all liv'd well while this lasted. When I went the next Morning, the <HI>Deaan</HI> was dressing himself to go; for notwithstanding, he had no Cloaths to put on, yet his Hair took up some Time to curl up, and plat in Knots, and he was shav'd neatly; then the <HI>Owley</HI> was brought out, and dress'd to be carried before him; for he went in State. There was not a sincere, and hearty Friendship between <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> and him, which made him go in more Form than he otherwise would have done: I carried his Gun after him. We march'd up an easie Ascent of near two Miles, when I perceiv'd
<PB N="319" REF="339"/>
we were near the Sea; the Descent on the other Side extended to the Shore of St. <HI>Augustine Bay,</HI> where Ships usually ride. Here <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> shew'd me where the <HI>English</HI> built their Houses, while they remain'd here to trade. It was an agreeable Prospect to me, tho' there were no Ships. I saw some Canoes a great Way out at Sea, the Men were striking, and darting of Fish, and some were in the Water, not Knee deep, at the same Sport; for the Sand is almost flat, so that one may walk near a Mile into the Sea at Low-water. The Sea-coast lay near North, and South; from whence I came it lay East, and West. After we had pass'd thorow a Wood on a Point of Land, we came among the Towns belonging to <HI>Deaan Mernaugha.</HI> The People all wonder'd to see a white Man naked, and took me at first for the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> who had liv'd among them, and who would have sometimes very odd Frolicks; but my Fame soon went before me, and I was known when I came to <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI>'s: For after the usual Compliments were over, I not being in Sight, having deliver'd my Master his Gun, he ask'd, Where was the white <HI>Man,</HI> who came from <HI>Anterndroea.</HI> On which I came forward, and was seated among them. The King ask∣ing me of my Travels, and Fortune, and I gratify'd him with my whole Story at large. A Bullock was given <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> for his, and his Retinue's Entertainment.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="340"/>
AT Night a Consultation was held on the Affair they met about; there were none admit∣ted to this but a few principal Men, among whom I had the Honour to be; and to my great Mortification, heard <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI> propose to send nine, or ten hundred People under <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s Command, as before into <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> to joyn with <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> against <HI>Deaan Woozington.</HI> This was approv'd of, and agreed to; the Manner, and Time was ap∣pointed, which was to be some Months after. When we came away, <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> told me, They had all of them Confidence in me, knowing it to be my Interest to keep their Secrets. But, <HI>says he,</HI> <Q>“A more than ordinary Care is necessary now; for the common People desert us, and go to live under other Lords if they don't like our Proceedings; tho' all we aim at is their own Good and Safety: But they have not the Sense to know it, and will always be cen∣suring our Conduct, and finding Fault, tho' we lose our Wives, Families, and Cattle, and run the Hazard of our Lives to protect them. It is natural, for mean People to abuse their Go∣vernours; but Governours must do Good to their Country, and defend Mankind from In∣juries, and never regard these Reflections; but then we must keep secret those Things, which we know before-hand, they have not Sense to understand, nor judge of.”</Q> I assur'd
<PB N="321" REF="341"/>
him of my Fidelity, but told him, I was un∣der great Concern at what I heard, being afraid he would desire me to go with him; where I should see my former Master, <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> whose barbarous Disposition I had too much Experi∣ence of, not to dread the Consequence of being within his Power. He reply'd, I never could be in his Power any more, for they know, <HI>says he,</HI> my Resolution, and that it would be dangerous for any Man to provoke me to such a Degree; since it might be the Ruin of the whole Army; for he would protect me at the Hazard of his own Life, and revenge with the utmost Rigour any Injury that should be done to me. I was not entirely satisfy'd, tho' know∣ing him to be a Man of strict Honour, I had some Security in depending on it. When I return'd to my Companions, they endeavour'd to sift out of me the Matter of their Coun∣cil; but I told them with a very negligent Air, <Q>“”That I stood at a Distance, and did not mind one Word they said.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> took his Leave the next Morn∣ing, telling the King his Nephew, his <HI>Owley</HI> had in the Night warn'd him of some Dan∣ger attending his Town from the Enemy, if he stay'd long. I desir'd, since I was on this Side the Country, I might go and see <HI>Eglasse,</HI> the <HI>Dutchman.</HI> The <HI>Deaan</HI> told me, He would make it in his Way Home. The Children sur∣pris'd
<PB N="322" REF="342"/>
<HI>Eglasse,</HI> when they came running to him, and cry'd <HI>Arve, verzahar;</HI> that is, <HI>A white Man is coming;</HI> for he knew of none in the Country. There was living near him one <HI>Efflep,</HI> a Negroe of the <HI>West Indies,</HI> who was left ashoar by Pirates many Years before, and spoke nothing but <HI>Eng∣lish:</HI> He was very deaf, and therefore never learn'd the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Language; but he had two Sons born on this Island of a native Mother, who spoke both Languages. When I approach'd <HI>Eglasse,</HI> he pull'd off his Hat to me; but poor <HI>Robin</HI> had none to return the Compliment with: He spoke <HI>Dutch</HI> to me at first, but perceiving I did not understand it, he spoke a little broken <HI>English,</HI> and I had as little to answer him in. I ask'd for an Interpreter to speak <HI>English</HI> for me; which set <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> and all of them a∣laughing at first; but they afterwards pitied my hard Fortune, to have liv'd all the Prime of my Days in a foreign Country. But <HI>James,</HI> who was <HI>Efflep</HI>'s eldest Son, carry'd on a Conver∣sation amongst us to all our Satisfaction; <HI>Eglasse</HI> ask'd me to live constantly with him, but I told him I would not leave <HI>Deaan Trongha;</HI> in which I was in good Earnest: For he was a Man gene∣rous and humane, of great Authority, and there∣fore an able Protector; but I desir'd they would get Leave of him to let me stay two or three Days with them; which they did, and he as readily agreed to give me a Week. I had heard
<PB N="323" REF="343"/>
but an indifferent Character of <HI>Eglasse</HI>'s Tem∣per, he was rash and passionate, and would, on every trivial Occasion, threaten the great Men; and even the King himself, with what he would do when a Ship came. This imprudent Beha∣haviour render'd him distasteful to them, and I was therefore afraid to enter into too strict an Amity with him, and it will appear By-and-by, that I was right; for his continu'd indecent Be∣haviour cost him his Life at last.</P>
<P>WE having now taken our Leaves of <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> and his Retinue, the Pot was set on by a Slave nam'd <HI>Toby,</HI> with a Piece of salt Beef and Potatoes after the <HI>English</HI> Manner. In the mean Time <HI>Eglasse</HI> desir'd <HI>James</HI> to relate to me the History of his Arrival and Adventures here; and this conducing to my Purpose, which is to give all the Account I can of the different Cus∣toms and Manners of this Island, as may be useful to Traders and Navigators, and plea∣sing to the Curious, I shall here transcribe as he then told it.</P>
<P><Q>“”AT a Place call'd <HI>Masseelege</HI> on this Island to the Northward, there comes once a Year a <HI>Moorish</HI> Ship bringing silk Lambers, and many other Things, to trade with for Slaves. At this Place one <HI>Burgess,</HI> call'd Capt. <HI>Burgess,</HI> and <HI>Robert Arnold</HI> had a Sloop; <HI>Burgess</HI> commanded, for <HI>Arnold</HI> knew nothing of Navigation, tho' he was as rich as the
<PB N="324" REF="344"/>
other, and as much concern'd in the Vessel; with this Sloop they us'd to come to <HI>Augus∣tine Bay,</HI> and other Places on the Island to buy Slaves, and carry them to <HI>Masseelege</HI> a∣gainst the <HI>Moors</HI> Ship arriv'd: <HI>Eglasse</HI> sail'd with them in this Sloop. In one of their Voy∣ages to this Place <HI>Burgess</HI> and <HI>Arnold</HI> quar∣rell'd; and it came to that Height, that <HI>Ar∣nold</HI> would stay no longer with him; but en∣gaging <HI>Eglasse</HI> to come on Shoar for his Com∣panion, he brought all his Effects with him, which were very considerable; several Bags of Dollars, a great many Guns, Powder, Shot, Chests of Cloaths, Beads, &amp;c. In short, every Thing which is proper to trade with here. He told <HI>Eglasse,</HI> that if he surviv'd him he should have all his Effects; but their Design was only to stay till a Ship arriv'd, in which they could procure a Passage to <HI>Europe:</HI> Whether they durst go to <HI>England</HI> I cannot truly say, for I had some Reason to think a great Part of these Riches were obtain'd by Piracy. There were two black Slaves; this <HI>Toby,</HI> and another, who will be here presently call'd <HI>Robin,</HI> both whom speak good <HI>English;</HI> these swam ashoar the same Night Capt. <HI>Burgess</HI> sail'd away, and surren∣der'd themselves to <HI>Arnold.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”IT happen'd a little before <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI>'s Death, (and which was indeed the Occasion
<PB N="325" REF="345"/>
of his Death) that this Country was inva∣ded by two Enemies at once: While the greater Part of the Lords and People were gone to oppose the Northern Enemy, the Southern one, <HI>Woozington,</HI> came unexpectedly on us; having pass'd the great River unsu∣spected by us, and a bold General of his nam'd <HI>Ry-Opheck,</HI> attack'd the Town and King's House in the Night; <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> him∣self was wounded in the Thigh. Another Party came towards us, every Body was for flying to some Shelter as is usual, and indeed necessary in such Cases: But <HI>Arnold</HI> and <HI>Eglasse</HI> having great Riches were resolv'd to defend it; and therefore arm'd themselves with Guns, Pistols, and Cutlaees; but they no sooner ap∣pear'd at their Door than <HI>Arnold</HI> was shot dead. <HI>Eglasse</HI> was then glad to fly with his two Slaves, <HI>Robin</HI> and <HI>Toby;</HI> for they never left him: The Enemy plunder'd the House of what they thought fit, which was all his wearing Apparel, or any Thing like it, even his Beds for the Ticking-sake; the Silver being black, they did not know it; therefore con∣tented themselves with throwing it about: They kill'd the Cattle they found in the Pens; for they had not Time nor Strength enough to carry them off, and defend them∣selves when once the Country made Head a∣gainst them. However, they took some Cap∣tives,
<PB N="326" REF="346"/>
and march'd away in as great Haste as they came, for fear of <HI>Deaan Mundrosser,</HI> our present King's Brother, who is belov'd by his Country-men, and fear'd by his Ene∣mies; for we have not a greater Man in War than he, except <HI>Deaan Trongha. Ry-Opheck</HI>'s Fears and Haste were just and proper, for <HI>Deaan Mundrosser</HI> muster'd an Army in a few Hours, and overtook them before they could pass the River: The Sound of his Shells made them hasten over, but so precipitately that they le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t their Captives behind; and he brought most of our Women and Chil∣dren again; so that we lost but little: For as to our valuable Goods, we who well knew the Danger of a Surprise, aad the Manner of the Country, had dug Holes in the Ground, and bury'd, and they had no Time to search for them. When my Father <HI>Efflep,</HI> my Bro∣ther, and self return'd, we miss'd none of our Goods; but were sorely afflicted and surpris'd to find <HI>Arnold</HI> dead and naked, for they had stripp'd him of his Cloaths; but as to his <HI>Dollars,</HI> they lay neglected, and scatter'd up and down, till some of our own People, who knew their Use and Value, took up a great many, and conceal'd them from <HI>Eglasse.</HI> We threaten'd some of them, and made them re∣turn what they had stole; complaining to <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> but they were above half
<PB N="327" REF="347"/>
lost. <HI>Eglasse</HI> was so terrify'd, that he ne∣ver return'd till some Messengers, sent out to see if they could find him living or dead, happen'd on him, and conducted him, and his two Slaves home. He lives very hand∣somely tho' he lost so much, having a Plan∣tation of his own, and three or four Cows which give Milk; and he is able to join with my Father to buy an Ox, notwithstand∣ing it is a very dear Time: A good One is worth now ten <HI>Dollars.</HI> Our King <HI>Rer Vov∣vern</HI> dy'd more with Grief than of his Wound in six Weeks after: He was very well-belov'd, being a good Man and gallant Warriour; also a great Friend to white Men, more espe∣cially to the <HI>English.</HI> But I must not forget to tell you, here is another Family you must be acquainted with too, and that is one <HI>Hempshire,</HI> a <HI>Guinea</HI> Negroe, who was for∣merly among the Pyrates, but has been settl'd here a great While. He has a very pretty Woman to his Wife, and also a Daughter by her; the Man is blind and poor, but <HI>Eglasse</HI> makes him many Presents, tho' we think it is out of Respect to his Wife; for they are very intimate.</Q></P>
<P>HERE <HI>Eglasse</HI> interrupted <HI>James,</HI> on hearing his own Name and Mrs. <HI>Hempshire</HI>'s often plac'd together, suspecting that <HI>James</HI> was telling me of their suppos'd Amour; so he broke off the
<PB N="328" REF="348"/>
Discourse: Tho' <HI>James</HI> said he was only telling how Christian-like he behav'd to <HI>Hempshire</HI> and his Family; but by this Time Dinner was rea∣dy. I found myself here a perfect Negroe in my Way and Manner, for I devour'd my Meat alone, which made them laugh; but what was a greater Mortification was, <HI>Hempshire,</HI> his Wife and Child came to see me and <HI>Eglasse;</HI> they talk'd of my Adventures in <HI>English,</HI> and it seem'd like unintelligible Sounds of a strange Language, which I could not form my Tongue to imitate; insomuch that I was in fear I should never be able to speak my Mother-Tongue again: But a few Days Conversation among these People gave me Hopes of remembring it in Time. <HI>Efflep,</HI> and his Sons were next Neighbours to <HI>Eglasse,</HI> where I was invited the next Day, and treated in a very handsome <HI>English</HI> Manner, bet∣ter than at <HI>Eglasse</HI>'s: Here were a Couple of Capons boil'd with <HI>Rice,</HI> like a <HI>Pilaw,</HI> also ano∣ther Dish of fry'd Meat and boil'd Potatoes, serv'd up on Pewter-plates; so that I began to think myself in a Christian Country. They also procur'd some <HI>Toak</HI> for me, as <HI>Eglasse</HI> had done before; but it was scarce, <HI>Honey</HI> not be∣ing to be got: This was made of <HI>Sugar-Canes,</HI> which were also scarce now, and the <HI>Toak</HI> was much inferior to what we had to the South∣ward; but it was strong enough to make us a little merry.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="349"/>
WHEN the Week was expir'd I would stay no longer, tho' they importun'd me; telling them I would get Leave to come again in a short Time: Nor would I accept of a Guide, well knowing I could find the Way. When I came to the Sea-side, I saw a Sail, as I thought, tho' it prov'd only a large Canoe, which was re∣turning from Sea where they had been fishing; I waited till they came on Shoar, when the Men seeing me white, tho' naked, came up to me, and we had a great Deal of Discourse; they being very inquisitive after my strange Fate. I related all I could to them, and enquir'd after Shipping. At the End of our Conversation, they made me a Present of as much Fish as I could well carry with me. When I came home to my own House, I pick'd out four of the best Fish, and went to wait on my Mistresses, pre∣senting each of them with two: When <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> came home he was surpris'd to find Fish there, and highly pleas'd that I was come; but he would not suffer me to lick his Feet. He had been all Day in the Plantations forward∣ing the Work, that they might have Provision when they return'd from the War; for every Body was busy preparing for it. He told me, he had order'd one of his Wives to make me a Cap, such as we us'd to wear to know one another by. I did not like the Proposal, but there was no Help. He gave out to his Wives
<PB N="330" REF="350"/>
and People, that their Design was against <HI>Deaan Morrocheruck,</HI> a petty King in the neighbouring Mountains; this he did, left some of his Peo∣ple should desert, and alarm the Country of <HI>Merfaughla.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I return'd to my House I found Vi∣sitors enough, who came to see me for the sake of my Fish; but as it was customary, and I us'd to do so myself, I could not take it ill; so I shar'd it out as far as it would go.</P>
<P>I slept but this one Night in Quiet, the next Morning I was call'd up to attend the <HI>Deaan</HI> with his Gun at the Plantation. He then thought of nothing extraordinary, but before Mid-day, came a Messenger running in Haste with the News, That an Army of ten thou∣sand <HI>Saccalauvors</HI> (our Northern Enemies) were at a Town call'd <HI>Murnumbo,</HI> within ten or twelve Hours March of us. <HI>Deaean Trongha</HI> had not Patience to hear the whole Story, before he order'd his Slaves to leave Work, and go Home; the Hoes and Spades were thrown aside, and the Lances taken in Hand, every Man running Home to get ready for a March. Messengers were sent to <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> and all the other neighbouring Lords to come, and assist in re∣pulsing the Enemy. Some of the chief Men of each Town were order'd to stay at Home, with a sufficient Force to defend their Families and Cattle, if <HI>Woozington</HI> should be at Hand as
<PB N="331" REF="351"/>
as he was before, to attack the Towns by Sur∣prize, while the Fighting Men were all engag'd another Way. I went Home under Pretence of whetting my Lances, but with a Design to be out of Sight and forgotten, which succeeded ac∣cordingly; for they soon march'd away. When I was certain they were gone, I went in great Haste to the chief Lady's House, asking for my Master; and being told he was gone, I pre∣tended to be in a great Hurry to follow him, but the Women would not suffer me, ordering the Men, who were left as a Guard, to stop me▪ At length, I was persuaded to stay, and sat very contentedly among the Women: Most in Town, and the Children too, were assembl'd at the House, and about it. Their Clamour, Pray∣iug and Crying for their Husbands, and igno∣rant Chat of the War was troublesome enough; but not so bad as running the Hazard of losing Life or Limb, in fighting the Quarrel of a Peo∣ple I was not concern'd for. When I went Home at Night, I had several young Women Visitors, who supp'd with me on some Carra∣vances which my Mistress had giv'n me; but our Conversation was very innocent, tho' some of my wanton Readers will scarce credit it: But I do assure them here are more modest Women, in Proportion to the Number of People than in <HI>England;</HI> even such as would resist to Death, unless they were taken to Wife according to
<PB N="332" REF="352"/>
the Custom of the Country; and the Women which Sailors find for their Turn, are Slaves brought down to the Sea-side, and dress'd on Purpose with Beads and silk Lambers, to de∣ceive their Gallants; and the Gain they make is for their Masters, who are generous enough to present them with some Part of the fine Things they get From their Cullies: But if these Sailors were to go up into the Country, they would find it no easy Matter to get a Mistress. The Conversation I had with these Women put me in a melancholy Humour, in bringing to Remembrance the Pleasure I us'd to enjoy in my Wife's Company; to whom, in my Opinion, they were all inferior.</P>
<P>DURING the Mens Absence we had little else to live on but <HI>Tamarinds</HI> and Ashes, except a little Milk; in twelve Days they return'd, and were receiv'd with great Joy by the Wo∣men. I also went with a bold Assurance to welcome them Home, <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> rally'd me a little, but his Wife saying she hinder'd me from following him, I had no more said to me.</P>
<P>THE Account they gave of their Expedition was, that a General of <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI> was at the Place; but the Messenger's Fear aug∣mented his Army to near double the Number it really was; there not being above five Thou∣sand. Our People were so speedy, that they secur'd a narrow Pass, which the Enemy de∣sign'd
<PB N="333" REF="353"/>
to have taken; and after a little Skir∣mishing and Bush-fighting at a Distance, <HI>Rer Mynbolambo</HI> retir'd to a Plain and encamp'd; to whom <HI>Deaan Mundrosser</HI> sent a Messenger, desi∣ring to know for what Reason he (more espe∣cially) march'd an Army into a Country to destroy it; whose late King <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> had reliev'd, and protected him when he fled from his Uncle <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI> at his Father's Death: For <HI>Rer Mynbolambo</HI>'s Father was King of <HI>Morandavo,</HI> and this Son should have suc∣ceeded; and there was a Dispute between his Uncle and he several Years, till <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> at last mediated a Reconciliation between them. <HI>Rer Mynbolambo</HI> answer'd in few Words, <HI>Those Matters were made up, his Ʋncle was King, and he was under his Command, and could not help it.</HI> We understood afterwards, that <HI>Deaan Woo∣zington</HI> had appointed to meet him, and had fail'd; he nevertheless was loth to return Home without doing somewhat, and therefore attempted to make an Incursion, and carry off a Booty of Slaves and Cattle, but was pre∣vented this Time: Our Army follow'd them at a Distance to see them safe in their own Coun∣try, and then return'd Home themselves. But that Part of the News which pleas'd me most was, that <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> and they had a∣greed to defer for this Season, their intended Expedition with <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> against <HI>Merfaugh∣la;</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="354"/>
for I had always a dread upon me of going into <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> as well for fear a Ship should come during the Time I should be absent, which would be six or seven Months; as also for see∣ing my old Master <HI>Deaan Mevarrow:</HI> But these Fears being dissipated for the present, I assisted heartily in fortifying the Town, which was done with Stones; they were here in great Plenty. None were exempted from Work, the Women and Children, according to their Strength, fetch'd Stones; and we made a Wall round the Town, at least a Yard thick, and three Yards high, with Loop-holes to look thorow, or fire out at an Enemy. We had no Mortar, the Stones were only laid one on another; we were about two Months before we finish'd it.</P>
<P>AFTER this was done, some of our princi∣pal Men got Leave to go into the Country to get Honey, and hunt wild Cattle; there being some on this Side the River <HI>Oneghaloyhe:</HI> We look'd on ourselves safe at this Time of the Year, between <HI>November</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> the River being swell'd very large, and no Canoes, except here and there one; but it was impassable for an Army. I obtain'd my Master's Permission to accompany them, we were half a Day walk∣ing very briskly, before we came to a Place pro∣per to bait at, and where we could find <HI>Ove</HI> (that is, <HI>Wild Yams)</HI> or <HI>Susers;</HI> which here we found in Plenty: But we had a hard Day's Journey
<PB N="335" REF="355"/>
further to go to the Place design'd for our Coun∣try-Habitation; and when we came there we had our House to build. The first Night we took Care for a good Supper; two, who well knew the Place, went to look out for Honey a∣mong the Rocks, in the Holes of which the Bees make their Combs; the other of us (for there were four in all) dug <HI>Ove</HI> and <HI>Susers.</HI> Our Companions brought some Honey, and we made a delicious Supper. The next Morning we built our House, finishing it in half a Day; it was thatch'd with <HI>Palmetto</HI> Leaves. The next Day we employ'd ourselves in getting a pleasant Liquor, call'd <HI>Araffer;</HI> which I had never seen before: The Tree from whence it comes grows like a <HI>Coco-nut</HI> Tree, but not so large; rather a Kind of <HI>Palmeto,</HI> call'd in their Language <HI>Satter.</HI> The long Leaves, or Branches we burn off, leaving the Trunk bare; then we cut off a little of the Top of the Tree, and with our Lances or Hatchets make a Hole in the Middle; which in a little Time fills with a Liquid, issuing as from a Spring. This may be drawn, or suck'd out with a Reed, as long as it will run, and it will fill again the same Day; continuing six or seven Days before the Tree is dry: It is not thick like a Syrup, yet very sweet and pleasant; and I never knew it gave any One the Flux, as some may expect; nor did any Inconvenience attend the drinking it. But
<PB N="336" REF="356"/>
we wanted roast Meat, so roving about the next Day, we espy'd a Herd of about twenty of <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cattle, and with some Difficulty kill'd a Bull; and now we liv'd luxuriously: We made drinking Cups of the Bull's Horns, thrusting them into the Fire, then giving them a Knock or two to get out the Pith; and we were as well contented as some with fine Glasses▪ It is indeed surprising, tho' delightful, to see how plentifully Providence has furnish'd this Country with every Thing, not only necessary for the Subsistance of Mankind, but even a de∣licious Variety. If ever any Country flow'd with Milk and Honey it is this; and with so much Ease are they to be had, that as the Na∣tives have no Knowledge of the Curse on <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity; so One would be tempted to think, as well for this Reason as from their Co∣lour, that they are not of his Race, or that the Curse never reach'd them; for they can get their Living without the Sweat of their Brows, or at least without That which we commonly under∣stand by it; which is hard Labour: Yet see how the Follies and Passions of Men lead them into Misery, tho' they have Happiness in their Power. In this fine Country their quarrelling with one another, and frequent Wars do often reduce them to the greatest Necessity, in the Midst of the greatest Plenty almost at their Doors; but they are confin'd sometimes by too
<PB N="337" REF="357"/>
powerful an Enemy, that they durst not go out of their Houses to fetch what the Land pro∣duces naturally; and this was the then hard Fate of <HI>Feraingher,</HI> and the Substance of our Conversation after Supper; my Companions entertaining me with the great Power, and Strength of their Country but a little before, in the Days of <HI>Rer Vovvern;</HI> and how misera∣bly they were forc'd to confine themselves now, getting close together, that they may be ready at a Call to repulse an Enemy; and by that Means leave the finest, and most plentiful Part of their Country uninhabited.</P>
<P>BUT we liv'd now very happy and plentifully, during our Stay at our Country-house: We made an Oven, such an One as I have before de∣scrib'd, and bak'd our Beef; then we search'd about for Honey to carry Home: In which I, knowing more of the Nature of Bees than they, had better Fortune, and got as much as I could carry away. When our Beef grew so tainted we could not eat it, we look'd out for more; it was my Fortune to overtake by myself a young Heifer, and driving her into a Thicket kill'd her; and holla'd to my Companions. This we agreed to dress, and carry as much Home as we could; we bak'd the Marrow-bones, broil'd the Liver, and spread the Marrow on it, as a dainty Morsel: And then we made up our <HI>En∣ters,</HI> and went Home as well contented as heavy
<PB N="338" REF="358"/>
laden; but we were not in Haste, and therefore travell'd softly.</P>
<P>WE made it almost Midnight when we en∣ter'd the Town, on Purpose that we might not be observ'd; and now again I wish'd for my Wife to have been at Home to receive me. The next Morning I carry'd a Horn of Honey, and a Piece of Beef to the chief Lady, who was highly pleas'd, and thought I had brought too much: I went next to the other, where <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> was, and made her a Present; he was very glad to see me, and made a handsome Breakfast; delighting to hear me tell of our Sport: The others by this Time came accord∣ing to Custom, to present their Lord with some∣thing of what they had got by way of Compli∣ment. As I went Home a Man met me, who wanted to buy some Honey; it being blaz'd a∣bout that I brought Home a great deal: He gave me a fine silk Lamber for a Callabash of Honey of about two Gallons. I thought my∣self very fine in it, and I am sure I was the first of the Family that was ever dress'd so like a <HI>Madagascar</HI> Lord. <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> told me I had bought it very cheap, but that Honey was scarce, or it was worth four Times as much; tho' Silk is very plentiful in this Country, if they would take the Pains to gather it.</P>
<P>HERE I ignorantly committed a great Error, for as <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> was saying <HI>the Man bought</HI>
<PB N="339" REF="359"/>
<HI>the Honey dear.</HI> I very smartly answer'd, <Q>“If this War continues three or four Years, a Man will be glad to sell a Child for such a Callabash of Honey.”</Q> The Prince took me up roundly, and said, <Q>“Then I suppose you will leave us, and go to some Insland Prince for a Belly-full of Victuals.”</Q> I assur'd him, <Q>“That at the utmost Hazard of my Life, I wou'd stay with him till he should send me Home in a Ship.”</Q> I found him still dissa∣tisfy'd tho' he said no more, and could not find out the Reason till after we return'd from the Plantation, and were walking Homewards a∣lone, says he, <Q><HI>“Robin</HI> you are not aware, that our People think you can conjure; because you know the <HI>Te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rato's,</HI> that is, <HI>Writing</HI> and <HI>Reading;</HI> and by that Means you can fore∣tel Things to come: Now when you talk'd of worse Times in our Country than we have at present before these ignorant People, they think it will certainly be so; and you will so discourage them, that they will all run a∣way: For they would have as superstitious a Regard to you as to an <HI>Ʋmossee,</HI> if you had a Mind to it. <HI>I answer'd,</HI> That I found I was in an Error, but could never think they could imagine I was a Conjuror, or knew Things before they happen'd; for if I had, I would never have come the unfortunate Voy∣age, in which I was cast ashoar here.”</Q> <Q>This
<PB N="340" REF="360"/>
“”is true, <HI>says he,</HI> but these People are too ig∣norant to be 'taught; and 'tis not in your Power, nor mine to convince them; to en∣deavour at it is, to give them an ill Opinion of us; they must be indulg'd in their Bi∣gotry, humour'd, and talk'd to like froward weakly Children. <HI>I told him,</HI> Since the Case was so, I would be very careful for the fu∣ture what I said to discourage them; and begg'd his Pardon.</Q></P>
<P>IN three or four Days our fine Provision was gone, for I distributed as is usual among our Neighbours; and then we had little else but <HI>Tamarinds</HI> and Ashes. About three Weeks af∣ter, <HI>Eglasse,</HI> and his Man <HI>Toby</HI> came to see me, bringing Beef and Potatoes with them, for they knew our Poverty. We had an odd Sort of Conversation between <HI>Eglasse</HI>'s broken <HI>Mada∣gascar</HI> Language and my broken <HI>English;</HI> but <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI> help'd us out, for he spoke both Langua∣ges. He staid with me a Night, and the next Day he went to <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> and begg'd Leave for me to go, and live with him five or six Weeks, which was readily granted; so I shut up my House, and in five or six Hours we ar∣riv'd at <HI>Eglasse</HI>'s; where <HI>Efflep,</HI> and his two Sons <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Joh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> came to welcome me.</P>
<P>I us'd to walk about to the neighbouring Towns with <HI>Eglasse,</HI> and met with several of the Natives, who could speak a great Deal of
<PB N="341" REF="361"/>
<HI>English;</HI> but here was one of them, who, when a Boy, and the <HI>English</HI> Pyrates frequented this Place, us'd to go of Errands, and transact Bu∣siness for them; by which Means he spoke <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> as well as his Native Tongue: He was very rich, having three Wives, many Slaves and Cattle; also wearing Cloaths, which belong'd to Men who dy'd there; for when any were sent ashoar sick, he us'd to look after them, and if they dy'd he had their Cloaths, and what they left: His Name was <HI>William Purser,</HI> the Natives call him <HI>William Poser;</HI> he always treated me plentifully when I went to see him, but never offer'd me any Cloaths, nor indeed did I desire any; for in that Place I should have behav'd myself very awkwardly in an <HI>English</HI> Dress; and I had now a fine Lamber to wear af∣ter their Manner, with which I was contented.</P>
<P>WHEN I had been here about a Month, old <HI>Efflep</HI> dy'd, and his Son <HI>James</HI> made a great Bu∣rying for him after the Manner of the Coun∣try; which is the same as in <HI>Anterndroea:</HI> He kill'd four or five Beeves, to entertain the Peo∣ple who came to the Funeral. Here is none of that foolish Custom of the Princes and Lords killing the Beasts; a Prince will eat if a Slave kills it: They also eat Swine's Flesh.</P>
<P>I liv'd very well between <HI>Eglasse</HI>'s and <HI>James</HI>'s, till within three or four Days before the Time was expir'd that I was to go Home; when I was
<PB N="342" REF="362"/>
with a violent Fever, which turn'd to an Ague; and reduc'd me to such Weakness, as render'd me unable to stir out of the House. They sent a Messenger to inform <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> of it, and took as much Care of me as possible; <HI>James</HI> would sometimes boil a Fowl to make Broth for me. I was once suppos'd to be dead, and <HI>Eglasse</HI> being abroad had le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Toby</HI> with me, who call'd in the Neighbours, and it was concluded that I was gone; insomuch that the People went Home, and <HI>James</HI> was consulting how to bury me: But as <HI>Eglasse</HI> sat by me, he, two or three Hours after▪ perceiving me breath, <HI>James</HI> burn∣ing something under my Nose, I reviv'd; but was not sensible for two Days, nor able to sit up for many more. <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> hearing I was dead, sent to see; the Messenger found me ali e, but not able to speak to him. After this I recover'd by Degrees, the Ague lasted three Months, and I was two more before I at∣tained to Strength enough to go Home; inso∣much that I lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g d to see <HI>Deaan Trongha:</HI> But <HI>Eglasse</HI> was willing to keep me as long as he could, for now I began to talk <HI>English</HI> pretty well, and was good Company for him as long as he was permitted to live; which was but a little While after my Recovery.</P>
<P>There came five Men with a Cow to sell to <HI>Eglasse,</HI> asking me for him, and he being in the Plantation I went and told him: He came along
<PB N="343" REF="363"/>
with me to the Men, and desir'd me to agree with them. They ask'd six Pieces of Eight, and stood hard for four; but I would give them no more than three. They said if <HI>Eglasse</HI> would give them the old Lance in his Hand, they would take the Money. This alarm'd me, for I had observ'd them whisper two or three Times to one another; and having heard that <HI>Eglasse</HI> us'd to threaten the King, <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> I began to be in great Fear, and told him in <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> they wanted the Lance; and that I did not like their Behaviour, for the Lance was not worth a Meal of Potatoes, being one of his Slaves: But he in a Bravado gave the Man the Lance, <HI>Here,</HI> says he, <HI>I wo'n't disagree; take the Lance.</HI> He had no sooner deliver'd it, than a Man came behind him, and with both his Hands push'd the Lance in at his Back so forcibly, that i ca me out of his Breast. I turn'd about at the Shriek which <HI>Eglasse</HI> made, and seeing the Man pulling the Lance out of his Body, I ran away <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the <HI>wild Canes</HI> which grew by a River-side; and the Rusling I made among the Canes, ap∣pear'd to me like the Noise of Pursuers: So that I ran about a good While before I could re∣cover my Senses enough to consider and stop; and when I did, I still continu'd myself to listen. After some Time I heard a Voice calling me, which prov'd to be <HI>James,</HI> and his Brother <HI>John.</HI> I was almost afraid to trust them, but seeing no
<PB N="344" REF="364"/>
other Company, I came out crying to them. They told me <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI> had order d this for <HI>Eglasse</HI>'s threatning him; and that I, be∣ing an <HI>Englishman,</HI> and belonging to <HI>Deaan Trong∣ha,</HI> need not fear any Thing: <Q>“For, <HI>said they,</HI> they could have kill'd you before you fled, if they had been order'd to do it.”</Q> This I thought was true, then I reply'd, <Q>“He may take a Fancy in his Head, that I shall tell the Captains of Ships when they come, that he kills white Men, and under Pretence of Danger, he may think it necessary to kill me too.”</Q> But they aff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r d me, as I was an <HI>Eng∣lish-man</HI> he durst not do it; and that the Exe∣cutioners had told him so.</P>
<P>I went Home with them, and saw the Corps lay where it fell, with four Wounds and naked; they also seiz'd on his Goods, Cattle, and on his two Slaves <HI>Robin</HI> and <HI>Toby;</HI> staying in the Town all Night. The next Morning they came to me, desiring I would go with them to the King. I said, <Q>“I would, if I was not afraid, were it only to beg the Body to bury it.”</Q> <Q>“”<HI>They answer'd,</HI> The King was so far from thinking of doing me any Hurt, that he would be glad to see me, and they were sure would grant my Request; and perhaps give me some of <HI>Eglass</HI>'s Goods:</Q> So <HI>James</HI> accompanying me I went, we call'd <HI>William Pur∣ser,</HI> and took him along with us. When I en∣ter'd

<P>p. 345</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="345" REF="366"/>
the Town my Heart fail'd me, but I consi∣der'd there was no going back. <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI> was sitting at his own Door, and a great many People about him. I went toward him, and throwing my self on the Ground, lick'd his Feet according to the Custom of the Country; which the People wonder'd at, having never seen a white Man do so. He permitted me at first, but soon bid me rise, and not be afraid, he would not hurt a Hair of my Head.</P>
<P>HE then order'd <HI>Eglasse</HI>'s Cattle to be brought before him, and commanded them to take a white Cow (not a Bullock) and tye it to a Tree: After that the <HI>Owley</HI> was brought out, and an <HI>Altar</HI> made, as hath been already de∣scrib'd, by placing the <HI>Owley</HI> on a Beam, lay'd a-cross two forked Stïcks, about six Foot high; then the Cow was kill'd, and the King arose, and taking a green Bough, dipp'd it in the Blood, and sprinkled the <HI>Owley.</HI> Next, he took some of the Fat, and some of the sweet-scented Gum, and burnt them under it, making the Smoak ascend to the <HI>Owley.</HI> Then he took two Cut∣laces, and whetting them one against another, (as a Butcher does a Knife, and Steel, but not so quick) he begun his Prayer to God, and the Lords of the four Quarters of the World, to his Fore-fathers by their Names, ending with his Grand-father, who made the Oath with the <HI>English</HI> Captain, which <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>
<PB N="346" REF="367"/>
told me of; his Name after his Death was <HI>Mun∣guzungarevo.</HI> The Form, and Manner of his Prayer was to this Purpose.</P>
<P>Bless me, O <HI>Deaan Unghorray,</HI> thou Supreme God: Bless me, O you <HI>Deaan Meguddumma∣teem:</HI> Bless me, O you <HI>Deaan Antyfertraer:</HI> Bless me, O you <HI>Deaan Aneebeleeshy:</HI> Bless me, O you <HI>Deaan Antymoor:</HI> Bless me, O <HI>[many Names of his Fore-fathers]</HI> but more especially, O you <HI>Deaan Munguzu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>garevo,</HI> and Bless my Family, and this Kingdom; for I have had Regard to your Oath, and the Man whom I have slain is not an <HI>Englishman,</HI> but of another Country; neither would I have put him to Death were it not to preserve my own Life; which he often threatned to take away, when Ships should arrive.</P>
<P>WHILE he was praying his Slaves were cut∣ting up the Beef; when he had done, he or∣der'd me to take the whole Breast, and the rest to be divided, and shar'd among the People. He told me, <HI>I had none of that barbarous Disposition, which some white Men have; for he look'd on me as a Native black Man;</HI> I having accustom'd my∣self to the Manners of their Country. I had no great Mind to take his Beef; but remembring <HI>Eglasse</HI> brought about his own Destruction, by his imprudent Behaviour, I thought it was safest to appear pleas'd. <HI>Robin,</HI> the Slave, was given to the Executioner; but <HI>James</HI> bought
<PB N="347" REF="368"/>
<HI>Toby</HI> of the King. I beg'd Leave to bury the Body, which was granted, and we return'd back to <HI>James</HI>'s House. The next Morning came two Messengers from <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> to enquire into the Truth of this Story; it having been re∣ported that I was kill'd: In which Case, they were order'd to go directly to <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> and demand Satisfaction of him, he being re∣solv'd to revenge <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; but it prov'd otherwise, and they having nothing to do in <HI>Eglasse</HI>'s Case, I went Home with them.</P>
<P>WHEN I arriv'd, I was receiv'd with as much Joy, as if I had been some Man of great Conse∣quence to them: I went to the chief Lady▪s House; where the other came on Purpose to see me, tho' she had not been there in half a Year before: <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> was plea '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too, and made me relate my severe Sickness, and the frightful Tragedy of <HI>Eglasse</HI>'s Death; saying, <HI>I had so many Escapes, that he did not think it would be my Fate to die in their Country; but that I might see</HI> England <HI>again.</HI> (Repeating his Promise to send me thither.) He order'd my House to be re∣pair'd, the Thatch being eaten by the Cattle: Provisions were given me, and appointed for Time to come; for he had lately a good Har∣vest, so that we liv'd much better than before.</P>
<P>I ask'd Leave one Day to pay a Visit to <HI>Rer Bafaugher;</HI> for in a Time of so much Danger from Enemies, none went out of Town with∣out
<PB N="348" REF="369"/>
Leave. As I was passing by a River, and walking down, with an Intention to drink, I espy'd the Track of an <HI>Alligator,</HI> which deter'd me; and there being two, or three Houses not far off, I was going toward them to beg Water, and met a young Woman with a Calabash, go∣ing to dip some: She desir'd me to stay, and she would let me drink out of her Calabash; but going a little Way into the Water, and crouch∣ing with her Knees to fill her Vessel, an <HI>Alliga∣tor</HI> gave a Spring, and catch'd fast hold of both her Thighs, and dragg'd her into the Stream, driving down with it; but she keeping her Head, and Hands above Water, I threw one Lance away, ran toward her with the other; which she took hold of, and I pull'd her to me: The <HI>Alligator</HI> still keeping fast hold, we calling out all this While for Help; but taking her by the Hand, she directing me where the Creature lay, I struck him with my Lance, and wounded him; but he did not let go till a second Stroke. By this Time Help came, and we brought her out safe with only two large Wounds made with his long Jaws, and sharp Teeth. She was now naked, having lost her Lamber in the Scuffle; but that was not worth minding: We sav'd her Life, and every Body was highly pleas'd with that. <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> entertain'd me generously, and having gratify'd his Curiosity, in hearing my late dangerous Adventures, I re∣turn'd Home.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="370"/>
THE next Day <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> told me, <HI>He had News for me:</HI> I flatter'd myself it was of a Ship's Arrival; but in the End, <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI> had sent to desire him, and his People would prepare to go to and join <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> as had been be∣fore projected. The Dislike I shew'd at this, made the <HI>Deaan</HI> reproach me with Cowardice, till I told him, <HI>I ran the Risque of losing Life, or Limb to obtain no Good; for I had no Family to re∣ceive Benefit of my Fighting, and might be out of the Way, when a Ship should arrive to carry me Home; besides the Danger I was in from</HI> Deaan Mevarrow, <HI>who was known to be a Man of ungovernable Passions, and ill Principles. Deaan Trongha</HI> was so good as to admit of these Reasons, and gave me his Word, <HI>He would not take me with him,</HI> seeing I was unwilling to go; but a cunning <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> drew me into it, by a conjuring Stratagem, not∣withstanding his sincere Intention of keeping his Promise.</P>
<P>THE People were order'd to get ready in three Days to march, and the <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> was set to work to prophesie of the Success of the War. He took some Sand, tossing it about, and making Scrawls with it on a Board: At length, he bid them <HI>Go, and look for an upright Tree, which lean'd no Way:</HI> Then a black, and bald-fac'd Cow was sought out; which being brought to the Tree, and kill'd, the <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> took some of the Blood with his Hand, smear'd the Tree, and invok'd
<PB N="350" REF="371"/>
the <HI>Daemons,</HI> and also the <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Deaan Trong∣ha</HI>'s Fore-fathers; calling on them to arise, and hear what he was about to tell them; which was, <Q>“That their Grandson, <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> was going to War against their, and his old Enemy, the King of <HI>Merfaughla.”</HI></Q> He next set two Men of equal Strength to cut the Tree with Hatchets, one to the Northward, and the other to the Southward, to give Stroke for Stroke with each other: <HI>Saying,</HI> <Q>“If the Tree fell to the Northward, bad Success would attend the Undertaking.”</Q> Those of the Vulgar who were present, stood stupidly gaping to swallow every Divine Word that came out of this wonder-working Prophet's Mouth. I don't know how the Mistake came, but the Tree fell to the Norward, tho' it was certainly design'd to fall the other way; for when <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> perceiv'd it, he only smil'd: <Q>“Let us cut up the Beef, <HI>says he,</HI> and be merry, that's the best Part of the Ceremony. We forgot to observe that what little Wind there is, is to the Southward: We should have chose a a fitter Time.”</Q> But he strictly enjoin'd all present to say nothing at Home to the Women; so we told them when we return'd that the Tree fell to the Southward, that they should tell their husbands so.</P>
<P>THIS Conduct of <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s confirm'd me in a Suspicion I had entertain'd for some Time,
<PB N="351" REF="372"/>
that some of these Lords, who are Men of Sense, keep one of these <HI>Ʋmossees</HI> out of Policy, only to amuse the common People; who here, as well as in other Places must be humour'd in their Bi∣gotry, and captivated by such Artifices, which politick Governours know very well; tho' they re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard very little themselves what the Conju∣rors say, of their talking, and having Familia∣rity with the <HI>Demy-Gods,</HI> and <HI>Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>NOW here was a seeming ill Omen, and too many vulgar minded Men had seen it, to be trusted with the Secret: An Expedient must therefore be found to avert it. The <HI>Daemons</HI> must be consulted, and address'd to again to procure their Protection; so away goes the <HI>Ʋmossee,</HI> in∣voking again, and conjuring till he conjur'd me into the Wars. A Bird, call'd <HI>Tuluho,</HI> almost like a <HI>Pheasant,</HI> but smaller, must be catch'd dead or alive, tho' very scarce to be found: Then a Sea-crab, and several other Things; these he blended together, muttering Incantations all the While. He bound them up in a Clout, and fixt it on the Top of a Stick, about the Length, and Bigness of a Walking-Cane. This was a Charm, which was to work terrible Mischief on the Enemy: He gave it a Name, calling it the <HI>E∣lodge;</HI> it was to be carried before the Army: But who should be a proper Person to do this was still a Question, and the <HI>Daemons</HI> were to be consulted again on this important Part of
<PB N="352" REF="373"/>
the Affair; who were pleas'd to reveal to him, or which is all one (to stupid Biggots, who will never doubt the Truth o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whatever he shall say) <Q>“That the <HI>Demy-G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds,</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> reveal'd to him, that no Body was fit to carry this, but One who had neither Man, Woman, or Child living, related to him on this Island.”</Q> Now from the Observations I had before made, I us d often to take the Liberty to deride these <HI>Ʋmossees,</HI> and their Conjurations; and after I have said this, I dare say, I need not many Words to shew from whence his pretended Re∣velation came, tho' he took the Liberty to fa∣ther it on the <HI>Daemons,</HI> or <HI>Demy-gods;</HI> or what∣ever <HI>English</HI> Name we must call them: For I must do the Man the Justice to say, he had not the Wickedness to bring <HI>Deaan Ʋnghorray,</HI> or the supreme God, into any of this conjuring Drol∣lery.</P>
<P>AFTER he had declar'd this before them (I was not present then) says <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> <Q>“Where can we find a Man without some Relations? I don't know, <HI>says he,</HI> This is the Mind of the <HI>Daemons,</HI> and they would not direct it if no such Man was to be found; you must recol∣lect yourself.—Now I think on it, <HI>says he,</HI> There's your white Man <HI>Robin,</HI> I dare say, he is the Man. Yes, says <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> he may be such a Man, but it is not proper for him to go; besides, I have given him my
<PB N="353" REF="374"/>
Word he shall not go against his Will. Why then, says the <HI>Ʋmossee,</HI> you must think of some∣body else if you can.”</Q> And away he went, for he had done his Business, leaving the <HI>Deaan</HI> in no small Concern, who was a Man of nice Ho∣nour, and a strict Observer of his Word: But he sent for me, and told me, <Q>“It lay in my Power to do a piece of Service of great Importance to the whole Country, and more especially to himself, that I should be well rewarded for it, but he desir'd I would promise first. <HI>I answer'd,</HI> If it is not to kill a Man, I would be glad of an Opportunity to do him any Service.”</Q> He then told me the whole Story, and that there was no Help for it, or he would not have ask'd it of me. I paus'd a little, but soon recollected myself, and said, <Q>“All I fear'd was what I had already told him; but since there was a Necessity I readily submitted. <HI>He said,</HI> He would protect me, and take as much Care of my Life and Health as of his own:”</Q> And immediately order'd a Slave to attend me, and every Thing to be got ready for me. I was to carry this Charm call'd the <HI>Elodge</HI> in my left Hand, three or four Stones Cast before the Army all the While they march'd, and at Night pitch it at the same Distance from the Camp, pointing toward the Enemy's Country; then wash myself, and go among the People where I pleas d. This was to
<PB N="354" REF="375"/>
be done till we should fight with <HI>Woozington</HI>'s Army: I was to have ten Beeves and two Slaves for my Trouble. The common People look on this to have a poisonous Effect, and that's the Reason I was to wash before I came near any of them; but <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> told me, <Q>“”He knew I did not think it hurtful. No Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> I know there is no Harm, nor Good in it, and they shall see me lick it before their Fa∣ces; which none of them would do for an hundred Oxen. I can never think, <HI>says I,</HI> that you depend as much on it as you tell them, but you see the ill Consequence of using these Conjurers; for the Vulgar are so per∣suaded of their Power over them by these Charms, that if your own Life was in Dan∣ger you must do what he says his Demy-Gods direct, if it was to carry this yourself. This is very true, <HI>says he,</HI> and if I was to refuse to let you carry it, they would refuse to march; or if they did, would charge me with every Miscarriage or Misfortune. Yes Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> but there is still a greater Danger; for if this <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> had Courage and Cunning enough, you have put it in his Power to be greater than yourself. It is but his saying his <HI>De∣mons,</HI> or Spirits have order'd any Thing to be done even against yourself, they durst not disobey; for he has them all at Command if he did but know it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="376"/>
IN two or three Days after we march'd out of Town, I had a Slave to carry my Mat and Pro∣vision, like a great Man, every Thing being plentifully provided for me: Now came the <HI>Ʋmossee,</HI> and put the <HI>Elodge</HI> in my left Hand, and I march'd before them. We join'd <HI>Rer Ba∣faugher</HI> the next Day, and two Days after <HI>Rer Mundrosser; James,</HI> the Son of <HI>Efflep</HI> was in the Army, and his Man <HI>Toby:</HI> So that we had good Company every Evening, after I had fix'd my <HI>Elodge,</HI> and wash'd. We pass'd the great River <HI>Oneghaloyhe,</HI> wading thorow a shallow Place a great Way above where I had pass'd it before. Our People stock'd themselves with Beef here, for we halted at Noon sometimes on Purpose, to give them Time to hunt <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cattle.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to the River where I saw the <HI>Alligators,</HI> and pass'd with my Fire-band, I would not venture to go over by myself at first; the <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> came up to me, saying, <Q>“I need not fear, for no Harm could happen to me while I carried the <HI>Elodge</HI> the <HI>Daemons</HI> would protect me.”</Q> <Q>I laugh'd at him in Derision, and said, “I was sure he knew better than to imagine I gave any Credit to him, neither have you any such Notion of its Power; and if you have, let me see you carry it over here, or go along with, or before me.”</Q> But he had more Wit. However I forc'd him to fetch two Guns, that I might fire them into the Water to
<PB N="356" REF="377"/>
scare away the <HI>Alligators;</HI> and then I went on. We saw several People belonging to two petty Princes not far off, who were here hunting: Our People had some Conversation with them, for they were not Enemies. We pass'd thorow the mountainous Wilderness, but lay no more than two Nights in it; for they knew a much better Way than I did when I came by myself. The Day I saw <HI>Vohitch futey,</HI> I return'd very melancholy into the Camp; insomuch that <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> took Notice, and ask'd <HI>What was the Matter?</HI> I told him, <Q>“We were now coming into <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> which had been a Scene of Misery to me, and I had a Dread of <HI>Deaan Mevarrow.”</HI></Q> But he chear'd me up, and said, <Q>“”They durst not venture to wrong me, and he was sure they would not as well out of Fear, as out of Respect to him.</Q></P>
<P>THE next Day we arriv'd at <HI>Madamvovo,</HI> the River where I us'd to water my Cattle in <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Country. This was ap∣pointed to be the general Rendezvous, and here came <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> with his Brethren, and their Forces. <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> soon espy'd me, when I went to lick his Feet he lifted me up, and made me sit by him; asking <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> how I came to him? I was desir'd to tell my own Story, which I did to his Satisfaction. He said, <Q>“”I had taken a great deal of Pains for Liberty, but it was no more than he would
<PB N="357" REF="378"/>
have done himself, if under such Circumstan∣ces;</Q> and wish'd me good Success.</P>
<P>THE next Day came <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> and his Sons; and with them <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> and his Brother: I was sorry to find he was recover'd of the <HI>Yaws,</HI> but I ventur'd to go to see him, choos∣ing a Time when I found he and his Brother were together; and after the usual Ceremony of licking their Feet, and their saying they were glad to see me, they ask'd me, <HI>Why I left them?</HI> I pretended when the Army parted I would re∣turn again, if he would give me my Wife. They both told me, She would not be marry'd to any other Man, but continu'd constantly lamenting for me. This brought unfeigned Tears from me, and made them the easier to be deceiv'd by my Flatteries. I would not have attempted this Piece of Deceit, had I not been in Fear he would have privately murder'd me, when he found I contemn'd, or hated him. At Night I acquainted <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> with what I had done, for Fear he should have suspected I was carry∣ing on some sinister secret Design in visiting <HI>Me∣varrow.</HI> I met here with my former trusty Friend, who had all this While kept my Se∣cret: He also told me, that my Wife remain'd inconsolable, and repented every Day to him, that she did not go with me.</P>
<P>AFTER two or three Days, the Army, which now consisted of about four thousand, march'd;
<PB N="358" REF="379"/>
and I went before them with the <HI>Elodge.</HI> The next Day we enter'd the Country of <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> and here the Army divided into three Parts, as in the former Expedition, marching with more Circumspection than before; for we were in an Enemy's Country, I still in the Front. As we were passing between the two Woods, on a sudden, a Volley of Shot was fir'd at me; I saw the Enemy run away as soon as they fir'd. They were a small Party, skulking about on Purpose to look for such Opportunities. The Shot whist∣led about my Ears, and some small Boughs fly∣ing off from the Trees, and striking me, I could not tell at first, whether I was not wounded. However I stopp'd, and was resolv'd to proceed no further. <HI>Deaan Tredaughe</HI> being the nearest Commander, call'd to me to go on; which I peremptorily refus'd, except they would send a Party to march before. The <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> too came, and talk'd in his conjuring Dialect to the same Purpose, and with the same Success as at the Ri∣ver. At length came <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> and com∣manded me to go on; saying he would force me. I was enrag'd beyond Decency, at the Haughtiness of him whom I had so much Rea∣son to hate; and told him, <Q>“He was a proud Prince, and that I thank'd God I was out of his Power. <HI>He said,</HI> It was true; or he would have prevented my going any fur∣ther.”</Q> <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> was now come for∣ward,
<PB N="359" REF="380"/>
to see what was the Matter; to whom <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> complain'd of my Obstinacy and Sauciness. <HI>He answer'd,</HI> <Q>“It was barbarous and unreasonable, to desire I should be expos'd to be murder'd at that silly Rate; and as to his Sauciness, says <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> you forget he is a white Man, and as good as the best of us.”</Q> In the End <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was oblig'd to order an hundred young Men to go before me, and it was but in good Time; for there were several such Firings at us this Afternoon from small Ambuscades.</P>
<P>In two Days more we arriv'd at the River, where we had encamp'd, fought, and defeated <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> before, and kill'd his stout General <HI>Ry-Opheck.</HI> Here we encamp'd again, and no Enemy appearing, most were for plun∣dering the Country, but <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> per∣suaded them against it, and advis'd marching still on to find out the Enemy; if possible be∣fore they divided their Force into small Par∣ties: I did not care how soon we came to a Bat∣tle, that I might get rid of the <HI>Elodge.</HI></P>
<P>AT length after four Days March, a Body of the Enemy of about a thousand shew'd them∣selves on a Plain in our Sight; and <HI>Deaan Trong∣ha</HI> drew out his Country-men to fight them. The <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> came to me, ordering me to march before my Master with the <HI>Elodge,</HI> and as soon as the Fight began to throw it toward the Ene∣my.
<PB N="360" REF="381"/>
We march'd on, and they advanc'd to meet us, tho' very slowly; for they had a se∣cret Design. <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> (as they wanted) drew near, they still firing, tho' at a great Di∣stance; yet it was Fight enough for my Pur∣pose of throwing away the <HI>Elodge.</HI> I briskly and joyfully did it, and return'd to the Camp; for I had no Gun nor Lance to fight, and was heartily glad to be eas'd of this troublesome Charge. The Enemy retreated into a Wood, and our People eagerly firing at them; till the General, whose Eagle's Eyes were looking eve∣ry where about him, notwithstanding the Heat of the Action, espy'd a long Row of Fire-Arms on a rising Bank of Earth among the Trees and Bushes; he call'd out to his People to stop, discovering a great Number of Men hid in a Ditch cast up on Purpose; so he march'd back without losing a Man: For there was no fight∣ing in an unknown Wood, and with unknown Numbers of Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> was certainly one of the most cunning Men on the Island, for tho' he had not Force enough, to look an Army of four thousand Men in the Face, and his Country was ruin'd; yet he found Means to revenge him∣self in a severe Manner: Nor did my gallant Master <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> escape him, notwithstand∣ing his great Conduct and Bravery. Our Beef being all spent, and no Enemy to be found who
<PB N="361" REF="382"/>
would fight; Parties went out to search for Cattle and Slaves, returning with very good Success, tho' the principal Generals remain'd in the Camp <HI>[Deaan Crindo, Deaan Murnanzack</HI> and <HI>Deaan Trongha]</HI> But some Scouts coming in, and saying they had discover'd where a large Herd of Cattle were, <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> would go out himself to bring them in, <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> advis'd him against it; but to no Purpose: So about an hundred of the <HI>Anterndroeans,</HI> and as many of his own People went with us; for I design'd to go, but (I knew not what Providence design'd by it) I was taken with a violent Pain in my Thigh: Nevertheless I went out with them, not caring to stay behind him; but my Pain encreasing, the <HI>Deaan</HI> would not suffer me to proceed, and I was forc'd to hop back, for I could scarce walk; and never saw this great good Prince more: For in three Days after came three Men, bringing the melancholy News that <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> was kill'd.</P>
<P><Q>“”ABOUT Sun-rise, a Man came to the Gene∣ral, <HI>saying,</HI> There appear'd a Party of about fifty of the Enemy in the Plain, on which he march'd his little Army out of the Wood where he lay toward them, and soon saw them increase in Number; but he was resolv'd to attack them. Here he committed an Error, forgetting that the <HI>Anterndroeans</HI> are good for little else, but Bush-fighting. When they
<PB N="362" REF="383"/>
came nearer, another Party appear'd; and soon after, a third: However, here was no going back. Some of the <HI>Anterndroeans,</HI> in∣deed, ran away, and Others skulk'd down in the high Grass; so that there were not above threescore Men of his own <HI>Feraingher</HI> People, stood with him against some hundreds. They maintain'd the Fight half the Morning: The General receiv'd two Wounds without falling; at length, a third kill'd him. There were not by this Time above twenty of his Party left, and they resolutely forc'd their Way thorow the Enemy; of which Number were the Three, who gave us this Account of it. The <HI>Anterndroea</HI> Men, who lay hid in the Grass, were most of them kill'd; for the Grass being exceeding long, and very dry (at this Time of the Year in this hot Country) the Enemy set Fire to it, and it run along like a wild Fire, scorching the Men who lay hid under it; so that they were forc'd to rise, and were most of them over-taken,</Q> and slain.</P>
<P>THE Death of this great Man was a sensible Loss to the whole Army, and sincerely lamented by every Body: It was a mortifying Stroke to me, and I remain'd inconsolable, not knowing what Evil might attend me in this Country. <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> did not return till ten Days after, when he brought a good Prize of Cattle, and Slaves; but his Joy was all damp'd at once with
<PB N="363" REF="384"/>
the News of his Brother's Death; which so shock'd, and surpris'd him, that he was not e∣nough compos'd to talk of any Affairs of the Army till the next Day. I had carry'd on the Deceit with <HI>Mevarrow</HI> of pretending that I would come privately to him, when the Army broke up; but was very uneasy, till I got an Opportu∣nity to communicate my whole Project to <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> and beg his Protection, which he rea∣dily promis'd: And it was agreed that I should absent myself two or three Days before they se∣parated, in order to make <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> think I ran away from the <HI>Feraingher</HI> People, and went to his Town before him; when, indeed, I, and my Man only went to a Place appointed, walk∣ing by Night to prevent Discovery, and stay'd till <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> and the rest arriv'd.</P>
<P>THE several Parties who were sent out to plunder, return'd, and the Cattle being divi∣ded, which were several Thousands, besides Slaves; the Army decamp'd. The <HI>Feraingher</HI> People did not accompany the <HI>Anterndroeans</HI> Home, as before; but took their Leave here, and departed, going a much nearer Way, direct∣ly homeward. I went away with my Servant, as was secretly agreed on with <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> and met them according to Appointment, to the great Surprise of the People; for there had been a strict Search, and Inquiry made after me, every one thinking I was lost. <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI>
<PB N="364" REF="385"/>
made so great a Clamour with <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> and some Others, that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> gave him two Slaves to appease him; fearing a Quarrel of dangerous Consequence would have ensu'd. One of the Slaves, a young Man, <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> made me a Present of. I was surpris'd not know∣ing what he meant by it, till relating the whole Story, and saying, <HI>That both were by right mine.</HI> I was satisfy'd, calling my Slave's Name <HI>Sambo.</HI> We were near a Month before we pass'd over the River <HI>Oneghaloybe,</HI> spending our Time vo∣luptuously in hunting, eating, and drinking, making very short Marches. We did this chiefly to feed our Captives, for their Country was so ruin'd by us, that for many Months they had very little to live on; so that the poor Wretches look'd very thin.</P>
<P>WHEN we came within one, or two Days Jour∣ney of <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI>'s, the Cattle were shar'd, and those who had two, or more Slaves, pre∣sented one to their Lord, according to the same Law, and Custom which I have already related is us'd in <HI>Anterndroea;</HI> and now I thought it a proper Time to mention to <HI>Rer Befaugher</HI> what I was promis'd as a Reward, for carrying the <HI>Eledge;</HI> and told him, <HI>The Fatigue, and Hazard I underwent did well deserve it.</HI> He said, <HI>There would have been no Objection against it if</HI> Deaan Trongha <HI>had liv'd: However, he would go to</HI> Deaan Mun∣drosser, <HI>and see what could be done.</HI> Soon return∣ing
<PB N="365" REF="386"/>
with five Cows, and a little after a Girl Slave was sent me; but I having already a Man, which was enough for my Use, I desir'd to have two Cows in the Room of the Girl, which they readily agreed to. I committed my Cattle to my Man <HI>Sambo</HI>'s Care, and the Man who at∣tended me, when I went out was their Guard; for he would not leave me till we got Home.</P>
<P>WHEN we came to <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI>'s Town, I left my Slave, and Cattle, and went to <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s Town to see his Widows. I found a melancholy Scene: The eldest Lady would have had me live with her. <HI>I told her,</HI> <Q>“”I could not think myself safe, but under the Protection of some great Man, as <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> was; but I should have Opportunities of coming often to see her, and would for ever shew the Value I had for the Memory of my dear Lord, and also my Gratitude for all her former Favours.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN I return'd, I met my Man <HI>Sambo,</HI> who told me, <HI>He was going to build a House,</HI> when <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> sent, and provided one for me, giving him also the necessary Furniture for it. When I went to pay my Respects to <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> I heard of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Fate; which was thus related by some who came from his Country after us.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Woozington,</HI> with what Forces he could collect together, kept always within a Day's
<PB N="366" REF="387"/>
March of us, having Spies perpetually out every Way to observe all our Motions, and who in∣terchangeably going, and returning to and from his little Army, with an Account of what they observ'd; so that he knew when we parted from the <HI>Anterndroea</HI> People: But they were still too strong for him, so that he was oblig'd to wait a little longer for his Revenge, and accordingly follow'd them at a Distance till they came to <HI>Madamvovo;</HI> where <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> and his Brethren, <HI>Afferrer,</HI> and <HI>Mussecoro</HI> separated from them to go Home, and this was the Time he waited for; so attending but one Day more, till they were too far asunder to assist one another, he attack'd <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> in the Night, and kill'd him with a great many of his People, and routed the rest: <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> narrowly escaping; and this he did so suddenly, and effectually, that he had Time to retire into <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> with most of the Cattle they had taken from him.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Mundumbo,</HI> after his Father's Death, attempted to assume the supreme Command, as King; but had not Magnanimity enough to maintain his Pretention, nor Love enough of the People to stand in any Degree in Competi∣tion with <HI>Deaan Murnanzack.</HI> He wanted those few good Qualities which his Father had; for it must be allow'd, that <HI>Crindo</HI> had Vigour in War, and the Spirit of Authority at Home, which alone supported his Dignity, and made him use∣ful
<PB N="367" REF="388"/>
to his Country. <HI>Murnanzack</HI> had his Uncle's Fire in War, and Majesty at Home, with the Addition of all the human, and social Vertues, and was, indeed, a truly great Man; so that <HI>Mundumbo</HI> was forc'd to fly into <HI>Antenosa</HI> for the Present till Matters were settled, and what be∣came of either of them after, I never knew; for I was not long after this mov'd into another Country, still farther from <HI>Anterndroea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> treated me as handsomely as his Brother had done. He had but one Wife, with whom he had liv'd nine Years, and was so unfortunate as to have no Child. She was a most agreeable, and good natur'd Woman, and behav'd herself so well that he lov'd her, and prefer'd her to all the Women in the World: She was also generally respected, and extreamly kind to me. Three of my Cows gave Milk, and they furnishing me with <HI>Carravances,</HI> and <HI>Guinea-Corn,</HI> I, and my Man <HI>Sambo</HI> liv'd very well. This continu'd all the Rain-time, and we planted and sow'd, but never stay'd to reap. For,</P>
<P>NEWS was brought by some People, who liv'd a great Way off, that <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> was marching toward us with a great Army. Spies were sent out to observe them, who return'd, and <HI>said,</HI> <Q>“They guess'd they might be near three Thousand, and were within three Days March.”</Q> So soon as the King, <HI>Deaan Mer∣naugha,</HI> heard it, we were order'd to send all our
<PB N="368" REF="389"/>
Cattle, Wives, and Slaves to the River <HI>Fe∣raingher,</HI> which runs by <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI>'s Town. I was so careful of my little Stock, that I accom∣panied them to the River, and went myself to <HI>James</HI>'s House (the Son of <HI>Efflep)</HI> where I found <HI>Hempshire,</HI> his Wife, and Daughter. Two Days after, hearing that <HI>Woozington</HI> had pass'd <HI>Oneg∣haloyhe,</HI> we were order'd farther to the North∣ward to <HI>Murnumbo;</HI> where we had not been three Days, but we were alarm'd with worse News, of an Army of <HI>Saccalauvors</HI> being just ready to at∣tack us: From These we were forc'd to retreat immediately, and hearing that <HI>Woozington</HI> had not penetrated so far as the River <HI>Feraingher,</HI> we attempted to go back again there; but the <HI>Sacca∣lauvor</HI> Army was so close at our Heels, that we were forc'd to fly for our Lives, and leave our Cattle to them; hastening as fast as we could to the River. Some of our People who had Arms, made a Running-fight to save the Women, and Children. We reach'd to the River, but they were in Sight of us by this Time. <HI>Hempshire</HI>'s Wife ran away from him, I, out of Compassion, took him by the Hand, and made him run with me into the very same Cane-thicket where I fled at the Death of <HI>Eglasse.</HI> We were not long sat down there before we heard some Women, and Children cry out, who were taken but a little Way from us in the same Thicket; which put us into the utmost Fear: For we could expect
<PB N="369" REF="390"/>
nothing but immediate Death. We had not sat trembling long under these frightful Apprehen∣sions before I espy'd them We got up to run I knew not where; but one of them fir'd, and shot <HI>Hempshire</HI> in at the Back, on which he fell dead. I was too nimble for my Pursuer, and was got out of his Reach; but just at the En∣trance of the Thicket, I met another Man run∣ning directly at me: He took a Lance to throw, but I call'd out to him, begg'd my Life, and <HI>said,</HI> "I would go with him." He seeing me without any Weapons (for I had neither Lance, nor Gun) bid me come forward; so I went and lick'd his Feet, submitting myself to be his Slave, <HI>he told me,</HI> <Q>“He sav'd my Life because I was a white Man, and un-arm'd.”</Q></P>
<P>HE took me with him into the Body of the Army, and it was soon spread about, that a white Man was taken Prisoner; insomuch that the Ge∣neral heard of it, and sent for my Conqueror, and me. When I came before him, I kneel'd, and lick'd his Feet: He ask'd, if any Body could speak <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> and was surpris'd I spoke in his own Language to him. He ask'd me several Questions relating to the Strength of <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> and the Number of his Peo∣ple, and other Things of that Nature, which I as cunningly avoided answering as was possi∣ble for <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI>'s sake; but in the End of the Conversation, he gave the Man, whose Pri∣soner
<PB N="370" REF="391"/>
I was, another Slave, and took me him∣self; at which I was a little better pleas'd than with him: For it was wretched indeed to be a Slave's Slave. My new Master bid me follow him, which I did while they march'd, which was not long; for they encamp'd soon after o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Banks of the River. This was the finest Camp I had seen, for it was full of good Tents; when the General's Tent was erected, he desir'd me to sit down, and tell him how I came upon the Island; and how it came to pass, that I be∣ing a white Man spoke their Language. I gra∣tify'd him by relating my whole History, which he listen'd to very attentively, and we had a great deal of Talk about my surprising Adven∣tures. After he had seen me sup, (I did not eat with him) he gave one of his principal Men Charge of me, to see I wanted for nothing, but never bid him guard me; and when one of his People advis'd him to it, he said' <Q>“There was no Fear of my going away, for white Men have no Home on this Island; all Places are alike to them, and they will stay with them longest who treat them best, and feed them well; which could not be done, he was sure, by the People of <HI>Feraingher</HI> at present.”</Q> And he was certainly right; for I fed so heartily this Evening, having eat no Beef a long Time, that I was sick. And when I came to consider, that Ships eome to this Country, and the poor

Condition of <HI>St. Augustine Bay</HI> render'd it very unlikely they should come to trade there; I did not find, but I was by this Providence likely to get sooner to <HI>England</HI> than any other Place where I had yet been: And the General judg'd very rightly, for I had no Business to go away from them, I could not mend my Circumstances; so having my Liberty to go up and down where I pleas'd, I went to see who I knew of the Cap∣tives, and found <HI>Hempshire</HI>'s Wife and Daugh∣ter, <HI>Toby</HI> and <HI>Robin,</HI> and my own Man <HI>Sambo;</HI> I took him by the Hand, and said, <HI>I was a Slave as well as he.</HI> He said, <HI>He had rather have serv'd me, for he should not live so well.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER the General had satisfy'd himself with enquiring after me, I had also the same Curio∣sity to know who it was I had for a Master, and was inform'd he was known by the Names <HI>Rer Towlerpherangha</HI> and <HI>Rer Vove.</HI> Now it is com∣mon for great Men to have two Names, and the last being the most in Use, I shall for the future distinguish him by that only. He was Grand∣son to <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo,</HI> King of <HI>Saccalau∣vor;</HI> which is call'd by <HI>Europeans Yong-Owl,</HI> and also <HI>Morandavo,</HI> from a River of that Name. The Man to whose Care <HI>Rer Vove</HI> recommended me was named <HI>Guy,</HI> he was a principal Man and distant Relation of the King's Family. All the great Families here have a general Name of Di∣stinction, on which they value themselves, as
<PB N="372" REF="393"/>
most Gentlemen in <HI>Europe</HI> do by their <HI>Coat of Arms.</HI></P>
<P>WE stay'd here two Days, expecting <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> would by this Time have made his Way thorow the Country on the other Side, and join'd us, but were in orm'd that <HI>Rer Ba∣faugher,</HI> by his timely Care, had stopp'd some Passages, and defended others so well, that he was glad to retire without effecting any Thing. Our General on this News retir'd to <HI>Murnumbo,</HI> hoping that <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI> would be rash enough to follow, and fight him; but <HI>Mer∣naugha</HI> wisely chose to rest for this Time con∣tented with his present Loss, rather sacri∣fice all to a foolish Notion of Revenge and false Valour, more justly call'd Pride and Passion. <HI>Rer Vove</HI> seeing no more could be done, after re∣maining here seven or eight Days, till the Parties which were sent out were return'd; he march'd homeward, and instead of putting me under a Guard as others were, he gave me a Blunder∣buss, and made me a Guardian over several of my late Country-folks, bidding me shoot any who should attempt to run away.</P>
<P>AMONG the rest who were under my Care was <HI>Hempshire</HI>'s Widow, and three other Wo∣men, who one Evening as I attended them into a private Place in a Wood, told me, <Q>“”It was hard to see themselves guarded by one who but lately fought, and defended them; <HI>telling</HI>
<PB N="373" REF="394"/>
<HI>me,</HI> How easy it was for us all to escape, and get Home if I were willing. <HI>I answer d,</HI> They were right, as to their own Interest, having Families; and besides there might be a Possibility of their being sold to Ships:</Q> <HI>Which was what I most heartily wish'd for, so that my Interest was contrary to theirs.</HI> <Q>“That I would never have gone from <HI>Feraingher,</HI> had I not been forc'd away; but since it had pleas'd God thus to dispose of me, I would run no Hazards to fight against Providence, and my own Reason, for I was sure of being better provided for than in <HI>Fcraingher,</HI> in its pre∣sent deplorable State; especially since I had lost my little Stock of Cattle, &amp;c.”</Q> But I assur'd them I would never mention what they said, which they heartily begg'd of me, being in some Fear; and I kept my Word, only look'd a little more diligently after them.</P>
<P>WE made very short Marches, yet soon ar∣riv'd to the Borders of <HI>Saccalauvor;</HI> which was not inhabited: It is a fine Country, and I saw a great many different kinds of <HI>Monkies, Ba∣boons,</HI> and <HI>Virjees,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>wild Swine</HI> in Abun∣dance; but none of <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cattle.</P>
<P>IN three Days after we pass'd by several of the Towns belonging to <HI>Rer Mynbolambo,</HI> alias <HI>Moiang Andro;</HI> it being the very Country which <HI>Rer Vovvern,</HI> late King of <HI>Feraingher,</HI> procur'd for him, by Treaty of his Uncle <HI>Rer Trimmo∣nongarcvo.</HI>
<PB N="374" REF="395"/>
I saw in the Towns and Meadows more of the hump'd Cattle, and larger than I had ever seen in any Part of the Island before; but was told, that these were only near Home for Use; the King and Lords having their prin∣cipal Stock of Cattle a great Way further to the Northward, and in such Numbers, that they don't know how many they have; which I af∣terward found true to my Amazement. Our Army now lessen'd apace, People going Home as they came near the Towns they belong'd to, without taking Leave of the General; having no Pay to take, or demand: For every One is sensible that it is for his own Interest to join with his Neighbours, and prevent Enemies from plundering them; never muttering at their Generals for leading them out to War, knowing it is their own Cause, and not the Ge∣neral's, which they engage in: For if they saw their Lords impos'd on them, they would re∣fuse to go; and could easily remove, and live under others. They fight for their own Safety and Felicity, and if they get any Plunder from their Enemies, they think themselves over∣paid.</P>
<P><HI>Moharb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is the chief Town, or rather City and Residence of the King, our General's Grand∣father, to whom he must pay a Visit before he went Home. When we came within a Mile or two, for Form-sake three Messengers were dis∣patch'd
<PB N="375" REF="396"/>
to acquaint him of our Approach, and to know his Pleasure; who return'd for An∣swer that <HI>Rer Vove</HI> might come, he was ready to receive him. On which he put his People in Order, appointing fifty Men to go in the Front, and fire their Guns; then to be reliev'd by fifty more; the Shells all this While sound∣ing. As we approach'd within Sight of the King, who was sitting with his Courtiers and other People, we heard their Shells sound and Drums beat; tho' they made but a dull, Tub∣like Sound for Congratulatory Musick, being indeed somewhat like this Country Tubs, made of a light Tree hollow'd, and very thin, cover'd with a Calf's Skin dress'd like our Parchment. They beat both Ends at once, one with a Stick, and the other with the Hand.</P>
<P>THIS King lives in a more grand Manner, than any I had hitherto seen: He has 20 or 30 Houses, or rather a Court within Pallisadoes in the Town; but it not being large enough to receive so many People, he was on this Occasion sitting without the Town. Our first fifty Men ad∣vanc'd capering, and firing their Guns regularly one after another: Then they retreated, and the other fifty advanc'd. After this the Gene∣ral went forward, and kneeling on one Knee lick'd the King's Knee: Several principal Men saluted him with their Knee but lick'd his Feet; then a Mat was laid at four Yards Di∣stance,
<PB N="376" REF="397"/>
and the General, and three, or four of the Chiefs (among whom was <HI>Guy)</HI> sat down; I stood behind my Master with my Blunderbuss.</P>
<P>THIS King, <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo,</HI> made a very odd, and, as I thought, terrible Figure; whe∣ther it was because I had heard Stories of some of his rash, and barbarous Actions, which had prepossess'd me: But his Dress was such I had never seen any like it; his Hair was twisted in Knots, beginning at the Crown of his Head, making a small Ring; then another Ring of Knots bigger than that, and so on downward, every Circle larger than the upper; on several of these Knots of Hair hung some fine Beads: He had a Fore-head Piece of Beads so low, that some of them hung over his Nose; among these were several gold Beads: About his Neck was a very fine gold Necklace, over his Shoulders, in the Manner of an Alderman's Chain, hung two Strings of Beads, several of them gold; on each Wrist about six <HI>Mannelers</HI> of Silver, seeming large enough to weigh near three Dol∣lars apiece; and four Rings of Gold on his Fingers. On each Ancle were near twenty Strings of Beads strung very close, also sitting very close to his Legs; a silk Lamber like a Mantle over his Shoulders, and another as usual about his Waste. He was an old Man, not less, by what I could find, than fourscore Years of Age; yet of a robust and hardy Constitution:
<PB N="377" REF="398"/>
His Colour rather tawny, like an <HI>Indian,</HI> than black; his Eyes fierce, and his whole Appear∣ance frightful, or his singular Habit and Cha∣racter made me think so; he soon espy'd me, and ask'd <HI>Rer Vove</HI> if I was the white Man whom he took Prisoner, and my Name. He call'd to me, <HI>Robin mehove a toee,</HI> which is, <HI>Come hither.</HI> I laid down my Blunderbuss, and walk'd toward him with my Hands lifted up, and clos'd be∣fore me. When I came to him I kneel'd down, and lick'd first one Foot, and then the other; as I saw the meaner People do before. He bid me sit down by him, but not so familiar as on his Mat. He ask'd several Questions of my coming on this Island, and told me he had a white Man himself; <Q>“”but, <HI>says he,</HI> he is an <HI>English-man,</HI> and I don't know if you speak his Language. <HI>I told him,</HI></Q> I was an <HI>English-man.</HI> I began to have more Courage now, hearing him say he kept an <HI>English-man</HI> himself, and wonder'd that my Master had not mention'd this before. I ask'd the King <HI>How long he had been with him? and his Name.</HI> He said, <HI>Six or seven Years, and his Name was</HI> Will. He order'd a Man to go immediately, and call him; who return'd with an Answer, that <HI>Will</HI> was gone out of Town, and would not be back in three or four Days; so finding the King begin another Discourse to the General, I retir'd to my former Post.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="399"/>
AFTER a While we went to a House ap∣pointed for our Reception; where my Master discharg'd me from guarding the Slaves: <HI>Say∣ing,</HI> <Q>“He did that only to try my Fidelity, for he was sure if I had not been honest they would have made their Escape; and finding me faithful, he had a Trust of greater Im∣portance to commit to my Care.”</Q> By this Time came in <HI>Ry Chemotoea,</HI> the King's Head-Wife, and Grandmother to <HI>Rer Vove:</HI> She was the biggest Woman I had ever seen in my Life. When she sat, her Breasts hung in her Lap, she never walk'd much; but was carried on a Thing like a Bier, on Mens Shoulders. She had a great many Attendants, besides Slaves, who brought four Calabashes of <HI>Toak,</HI> two of <HI>Honey,</HI> and two of <HI>Sugar-canes;</HI> also six Baskets of <HI>Rice.</HI> The King sent ten <HI>Beeves,</HI> four of them very large, and fat <HI>Oxen. Ry Chemotoea</HI> was no sooner gone, than we sat down to drinking the <HI>Honey-Teak,</HI> till <HI>Rer Vove</HI> was very merry, and fell a∣sleep; when three Slaves came from his Grand∣mother; One with a fat <HI>Capon</HI> boil'd (for they make <HI>Capons</HI> here); Another with a Pot full of <HI>Rice</HI> boil'd dry; and the Third with a Basket, a wooden Dish, and a Spoon. This was the best Supper I had seen of the Natives dressing, and I had my Part of it; but for all this good Cheer, I could not help thinking of this <HI>Will,</HI> the <HI>Eng∣lish-man,</HI> and was concern'd that we could not stay till he came Home.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="400"/>
THE next Day we march'd homewards, it was two Days Journey; but we hasted to come in early the second Day, because of the great Triumph we were to make at our Entrance; which was much the same as I have describ'd in other Places, of their Wives licking their Feet, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Rer Vove</HI>'s House was seven, or eight Yards long, and six broad, built of Boards, as are all the great Mens Houses in <HI>Saccalauvor,</HI> tho' they have no Saws; but with a great deal of Labour hew out Boards very even with Hatchets. The Language differs not from that in other Coun∣tries, except as <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> or the West of <HI>England;</HI> where each Place has some particu∣lar Words, and a little Difference in Pronoun∣ciation.</P>
<P>MY Post here was a grand one, for I was made Captain of my Master's Guard. His House was enclos'd in Pallisades, at the Gate of which was a little House for several Youths to lay in, who were his Guard, over whom I was appointed Chief; but this did not continue above one Month, when he singl'd me out to go with him a shooting wild Fowl by ourselves: He then told me how vicious the People of <HI>Saccalauvor</HI> were grown, since the few Years of the Coun∣try's being made rich; and that young Men, living so well, and drinking too much <HI>Toak,</HI> did often lye with other Mens Wives; by which
<PB N="380" REF="401"/>
Means, Murders, and other Mischiefs have ensu'd. <Q>“Now, <HI>says he,</HI> I have no Reason to suspect my Wife <HI>Ry Kaley,</HI> and to prevent a∣ny Suspicion for the future, I will put her under your Care, and desire she may never be be out of your Sight, by Night, or Day, on any Occasion whatsoever; except she is with me: I know she will not take this amiss, and you have no Business to mind any Body else.”</Q> I return'd him Thanks for the great Opinion he had of my Fidelity, and that I would take the same Care I had hitherto done, to discharge my Duty to him in any Thing he thought proper to commaud; but was afraid some trusty old Servants of his would envy me. <HI>He said,</HI> <Q>“No, for a white Man is by every Body expected to be distinguish'd, and preferr'd to others.”</Q> When we came Home, he broke it to her with such another Apology as he did to me. She prevented him from asking her Consent, very readily apprehending him▪ and <HI>saying,</HI> <Q>“She desir'd nothing more than that he would take some Method to keep always the same Opi∣nion of her he then had; and hoping I was to be her Guardian, she would submit with Pleasure to it: And, from this Time, <HI>Robin, says she,</HI> I will never be out of your Sight, but in <HI>Rer Vove</HI>'s; and I am now under your Jurisdiction: See you discharge your Trust as you ought to do, and don't think
<PB N="381" REF="402"/>
you can displease me in any Thing, but in not performing your Orders strictly; besides, I propose a great deal of Pleasure in your Company, in telling me Stories of your Tra∣vels, and Country.”</Q> And indeed, she gave me Reason to think she was not displeas'd with my Company. I was oblig'd to attend her on all Occasions, sometimes her Women Slaves were with her, and often none but ourselves; she making Opportunities: And whether my Master had so great an Opinion of her, as he pretended, I cannot say; but I found her to be a very wanton Woman, and was oblig'd to manage with a great deal of Art to keep her honest, as well with others, as with myself. My Life lay at Stake, and therefore I was re∣solv'd to be faithful. She was under my Care three Quarters of a Year, before I got rid of this troublesome Charge; during which Time, my Master took another Woman to Wife, if One may call it so: She had lately been di∣vorc'd from a Cousin of his. He was very fond of her for a little While; but soon quarrell'd with her, beat her, and turn'd her away; re∣turning with as much Fondness to my Charge, <HI>Ry Kaley,</HI> again.</P>
<P>A little after this, <HI>Rer Vove</HI> would take a Journey to the Northward for Pleasure, and to see his Cattle; so ordering his Houshold-stuff to be remov'd to his Head-slave's till he re∣turn'd,
<PB N="382" REF="403"/>
our House was shut up, and we march'd away: We were a large Company; <HI>Ry Kaley</HI> his Wife, his Friend <HI>Guy,</HI> with several others, besides Slaves. It was just as the Rains were o∣ver; so coming to a small River, which was swell'd with the Floods, the People were at a Stand, not caring to go thorow it rashly; lest <HI>Alligators</HI> might have come up into the Marshes, as is usual, and return again to their old Haunts when the Waters fell. The River was shallow enough to wade, and I, being fool∣hardy, would out of a Bravado go first. Two fine Dogs which my Master lov'd, went into the Water with me, and kept close, one on each Side; for the Dogs are sensible of <HI>Alligators.</HI> I was about up to my Belly in the Water, when an <HI>Alligator</HI> gave such a sudden, and violent Spring at the Dog on my left Side, that the <HI>Alligator</HI>'s Nose struck me down. The <HI>Alliga∣tor,</HI> Dog, and I, disappearing at once, the Peo∣ple thought I had been carry'd away; but ri∣sing, and finding myself not hurt, I went over, and they all follow'd me; for if there are a Number of People, and a Noise is made, an <HI>Alligator</HI> will sink to the Bottom like a Stone, and lye as motionless; that if you tread on him he will not stir. We march'd slowly, for be∣ing on a Journey only for Pleasure, we had no Occasion to fatigue ourselves. In a few Hours we arriv'd on the Banks of a very large
<PB N="383" REF="404"/>
River, call'd <HI>Mernee.</HI> Here we came to a Town inhabited by a People of a different Species of Mankind, and of a Language peculiar to them∣selves; tho' they speak the general Language too: Their Customs, and Manners differ also very much; of which being some Time after better acquainted, I shall give a further Ac∣count.</P>
<P><HI>Rer Vove</HI> order'd one of the Houses of these <HI>Virzimbers</HI> (which is the Name they are distin∣guish'd by) to be made very clean for him, and all their Furniture to be taken away; and as for us of his Retinue, we might shift as we would. There are very few <HI>Saccalauvors</HI> will lye in the <HI>Virzimbers</HI> Houses, for fear of an Insect like a <HI>Cow-Tick;</HI> such a kind of a Creature being often found on Cattle; this they call <HI>Porropongee.</HI> It is found only in the Houses of these People, who take Care to breed them, on Purpose to make their Houses shunn'd by the <HI>Saccalauvors:</HI> For the <HI>Virzimbers</HI> were, till very lately, under no Go∣vernment, and often moving their Habitations; so that when they came first to settle here, the Natives us'd to come into their Houses, and take away what they thought proper; imposing very grosly upon them, till the King, under whose Protection they now are, did on their Complaint redress these Grievances. This <HI>Porro∣pongee</HI> makes People, who are bit by it, sick for six Weeks, or two Months together, sticking
<PB N="384" REF="405"/>
close on the Skin, or in it for a long Time; but when a Man has been once thus bit, and sick, he is never hurt any more afterwards, if he is among ever so many of them; or at least they don't fear them. These <HI>Virzimbers</HI> are also ve∣ry subject to the Distemper, call'd <HI>Colah</HI> or <HI>Yaws,</HI> which has been elsewhere describ'd; but it is so frequent here, that you may see a third Part of the People of a Town spotted like <HI>Lepers,</HI> with dry Scabs. We stay'd but one Night here, and pass'd over this large River the next Morn∣ing in Canoes.</P>
<P>ABOUT half a Day's Journey from hence, lives <HI>Rer Moume,</HI> eldest Son to the King <HI>Trim∣monongarevo,</HI> and Uncle to <HI>Rer Vove,</HI> to whom we went now on a Visit. Messengers were sent before for Form-sake, and the Answer being receiv'd, we approach'd the Town, and found him sitting in great State under a <HI>Tamarind-Tree</HI> for the Shade-sake; it being the Heat of the Day: He is a very great Prince, and well belov'd. There were then with him twelve Wives, and a great many other People. When <HI>Rer Vove,</HI> with his Wife <HI>Ry Kaley</HI> came to him, they kneel'd, and lick'd his Knee; she retiring among the Women, and he sitting down on a Mat near his Uncle; but his Aunts, all of them, except one who was blind, came to him, and lick'd his Shoulder; for they had not seen him since his Return from his Expedition at <HI>Feraing∣her.</HI>
<PB N="385" REF="406"/>
<HI>Toak</HI> was now brought out, and some given to our principal People, among whom I always was with <HI>Guy,</HI> for he had a particular Esteem for me; but my Master being a little proud of his white Man, call'd me in broken <HI>English,</HI> he having just enough to say, <HI>Come hither;</HI> or, <HI>How do you do?</HI> When <HI>Rer Moume</HI> saw me, says he, <HI>If it were not for his Hair, and Eyes, I should scarce have known him to be a White; his Skin is so burn'd with the Sun, that it is almost as swarthy as my own:</HI> Ry Anzacker <HI>there, is as white as he.</HI> And, indeed, she was almost. This was his se∣cond Wife, and Sister to <HI>Deaan Tokeoff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> King of <HI>Munnongaro,</HI> alias <HI>Masseelege. Rer Moume</HI> is not black, but of a Copper Colour: He has lost the Use of his Limbs, tho' without any visible Distemper, having no Swelling in his Legs, or Sores, looking very well to Appearance, tho' he can't support himself upright. It was sup∣pos'd to be brought on him by Poyson, given him by one of his Wives with an Intention to kill him, she having been a Captive, and the Wife of a neighbouring Prince, their Enemy, who was kill'd in Battle. He sets on a square Seat made on Purpose, and no higher than he can conveniently rest his Legs on the Ground.</P>
<P>WHEN he found I could speak their Language, he was extreamly delighted with me; for he was a Man of a great deal of good Nature, and Hu∣manity; which I have just Reason to acknow∣ledge;
<PB N="386" REF="407"/>
By his Compassion I was redeem'd from the Hardships of Slavery while I remain'd here and at last by him dismiss'd in a friendly and genteel Manner, and sent Home to <HI>England.</HI> The whole Discourse now turn'd on me, and my surprising Adventures; the Women too join'd in the Conversation, expressing their Pity, and said, <Q>“They should be glad to have me among them, they could never do enough for me, if I would gratify them with Stories of my Tra∣vels and Country:”</Q> But this happy Time was not yet come, I was to undergo some more Slavery first, tho' it did not continue long.</P>
<P>MY Master <HI>Rer Vove</HI> was a gallant young Man, addicted to his Pleasures and some Vices; and indeed, like many young Noblemen in <HI>Europe,</HI> always in Action, full of Fire, and many of the thoughtless Extravagances of Men of his Age and Constitution, which was very vigorous: His Stature was of the tallest, I dare say, not less than six Foot eight Inches; he might be seen in an Army or Croud, at a Distance, an Head taller than most People; exactly propor∣tion'd and well-shap'd, his Legs and Arms finely taper'd, without Bigness of the Joints. I was oblig'd sometimes to serve him in his Gallan∣tries, of which a pretty remarkable as well as hazardous One was on this Journey. After he parted from his Uncle, he would go and visit a Cousin, named <HI>Rer Chemunghoher;</HI> but coming
<PB N="387" REF="408"/>
near his Town, and hearing he was gone from Home as far as <HI>Moherbo,</HI> a Fancy came into his Head to send his Wife one Way, while he pre∣tended Business another, and to meet again three or four Days after; advising her to go thorow some Towns of the <HI>Virzimbers,</HI> who al∣ways present those of the Family with one Thing or another, according to their Ability. He order'd most of his Attendants to accom∣pany his Wife; and me, who expected to have been left her Guardian, to follow him. When we were at a sufficient Distance from the People, he told me he had a Secret to impart to me of great Importance, and also desir'd my Assistance in a certain Affair he was going about. <HI>I said,</HI> <Q>“He knew my Fidelity, and that I would scruple nothing but killing of People to serve him. No, <HI>says he,</HI> it is nothing of that Na∣ture; but the Consequence may be bad, if you do not manage discreetly: In short, <HI>Rer Chemunghoher</HI> has marry'd a Woman who was my Wife before <HI>Ry Kaley;</HI> and I, on a Quar∣rel, put her away a little too rashly, my Kinsman also marry'd her too hastily; or else we should have agreed again. The Wo∣man I still love, and her Husband being now abroad, I design you shall procure me an In∣terview with her: There is a <HI>Maurominter,</HI> (which is a black Man of any other Coun∣try) who speaks <HI>English,</HI> you shall go as on
<PB N="388" REF="409"/>
a Visit to see him; and by that Means you may come to speak with her.”</Q> I was glad of this Opportunity to see this English <HI>Mauromin∣ter,</HI> and therefore readily agreed to it; and having my full Instructions, and a Man to shew me the Way, I left my Master at a small Village about two Hours Walk from <HI>Rer Chemunghoher</HI>'s Town, and proceeded on the Business.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> receiv'd, and entertain'd me very hand∣somely: He was born in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> follow'd the Sea, and being taken by Pyrates was set on Shoar at <HI>Augustine Bay;</HI> where he liv'd some Time, till the Troubles of that Country came on; and then he, as well as many Natives, came away for more safe and plentiful Living: So that between the Affairs of <HI>Feraingher</HI> and <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> we had Discourse enough for a long Time; but his Wife going out, I took the Opportunity to ask him, if he could bring me to the Speech of their Lord's Wife? He guess'd at my Busi∣ness, knowing the Story, tho' I told him no more than was just necessary for my Purpose; but he went to her, and she sent Word she would come; which she did soon with only one Maid to attend her. It was a good Gloss e∣nough for her to say, she came out of Curiosity to see a white Man. <HI>Lewis,</HI> and his Wife go∣ing out, and she saying, I might deliver any Message before her Maid, whom she would trust with her Life; I soon told my Errand, and how
<PB N="389" REF="410"/>
melancholy <HI>Rer Vove</HI> was ever since he came near the Town: In short, I found her as eager as himself for the Interview; and she appointed that Night, in a Wood at a convenient Di∣stance. She return'd Home, sending her Maid with some <HI>Toak</HI> to me, which <HI>Lewis</HI> and I having drank, I went with the joyful News to my Ma∣ster; and it being a Moon-light Night, we came to the Place appointed; tho' going over a River, and thorow a Plantation, the Dogs barking, the Owner had like to have discover'd us; for they are forc'd to listen to the Dogs, the wild Hogs often making great Havock in the Night.</P>
<P>I left him in the Wood, and went to <HI>Lewis,</HI> for whose Coming she waited: He conducted her thorow a Breach in the Pallisado; for the Gate was always guarded, and I conducted her to her Lover: Her Maid follow'd with a Ca∣pon and Rice, and a Callabash of <HI>Toak.</HI> They embrac'd each other with great Passion, the Maid was for serving up the Supper, but they had other Affairs to talk of first; which we perceiving withdrew, and diverted ourselves as well as we could. It was two Hours before he whistled, which was the Signal to come; when we supp'd with them, and then roving about at a Distance, left them again till it was Day-break. <Q>“Now <HI>Robin,</HI> says he, we must do as the wild Boars do, get at a Distance from the
<PB N="390" REF="411"/>
Place, where they have been doing their Mischief;”</Q> so repassing the River, we walk'd about till Noon, when a Man was to come, and bring some Victuals. As I was looking out, and listening for the Token, which was whist∣ling, I went toward him, but he being a silly Fellow, and knowing nothing of a white Man, threw down the Meat and Callabash of <HI>Toak,</HI> and ran away frighted; going home, and telling his Mistress, he met with a white Spirit, who ran after him for the Meat, which he was forc'd to leave behind him. This caus'd us Mirth e∣nough the next Night, when she came again; a Capon, Rice, and Toak were brought also this Evening; and I could not forbear being very pleasant with my Master, having now Pa∣tience enough to sup, and regale himself with <HI>Toak</HI> first. After which they bid us go, and watch at a Distance, and find some Diversion or other to pass the Night away; and indeed, if we had not made ourselves merry, and agree∣able to one another as such an Occasion requir'd, we should have been dull People, and have made the Nights very long and tedious. We slept till Day-break, and when I went toward them they were not risen; then they were to take their Leave, which they did by embracing, and rubbing their Noses together, drawing their Breath like People who take Snuff. After which they parted well satisfy'd for this Time.</P>

IT was now broad Day-light, so that when we attempted to go over the Plantation, the Way we came, the People were up; and we being two such remarkable Persons, he by his Height, and I by my Colour; the seeing us at a Distance would have been sufficient to betray the whole Secret: So that we had no Way to take, but thorow a Thicket of Briars and thorny Wood; where I went first crawling on my Knees, and beating them down with a Stick, my Master following till our Shoulders bled in many Places; which we did not mind at first for Ea∣gerness, and when we did, it signify'd nothing; for it would have been as bad to have gone back. So on we went thorow all, but when we were got on the other Side▪ of the River, we stood to look on one another, and seeing how our Hides were scratch'd and torn, we could not forbear laughing; tho' we were not without a great deal of Smart. We were glad to choose private Ways still, being as much asham'd now, as we were before afraid of being seen. When we came to <HI>Guy,</HI> he could not forbear laughing at us; <HI>Rer Vove</HI> said, <Q>“We had been hunting a wild Boar, and following him eagerly in∣to the Thickets were thus scratch'd. It was more likely, said <HI>Guy,</HI> a wild Woman, and the Owner pursuing you close, you were glad to escape to the nearest Wood.”</Q> <HI>Ry Kaley</HI> also was a little jealous, but we laugh'd it off.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="413"/>
AFTER we were together again we proceeded to the Northward, where all the Cattle is kept. This is the finest Country that ever I saw, and the most plentiful of every Necessary for the Use of Mankind. These People never go out to War, but are left to take Care of the King's and Lord's Cattle; and have also Plenty of their own: The King's Cattle are mark'd with a Mark call'd <HI>Chemerango.</HI> Here are so many Thousands of them, that it is not known to two or three thousand, how many he has: You may see Oxen not able to walk for Age, and others for Fatness; they never trouble them∣selves to milk the fourth Part of the Cows, tho' the Place is populous, and as large as some King's Dominions; which are a great many Towns, many <HI>Virzimbers</HI> dwelling among them. The chief Town is very large, where the prin∣cipal Herd keeps a great Court, and has abso∣lute Authority to decide Controversies, and punish without Appeal. He made, when we saw him, as great a Figure as a King, and was sitting with his People about him in the same Manner; tho' he arose to kiss <HI>Rer Vove</HI>'s Knee (not his Feet) out of a particular Respect to him. He has eight thousand Head of Cattle of his own, and three hundred Slaves; he presented my Master with five of his own, and fifteen of the <HI>Chemerango.</HI> He never goes out on Foot, but is carry'd on a Bier on Mens Shoulders; indeed,
<PB N="393" REF="414"/>
he is very old, having been Cow-keeper to <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI>'s Father, <HI>Deaan Lohefute.</HI></P>
<P>BUTTER and <HI>Cheese</HI> might be made here, were there any Body in the Country that understood it; for the Cows give a great deal of <HI>Milk,</HI> tho' I think not altogether so much as ours in <HI>England;</HI> but then they continue it more Months in a Year, the Summer-time in this hot Coun∣try being the Worst for the Cattle; tho' in this Place here are so many Rivers, Brooks, and Springs that they never have the Drought which we found in <HI>Anterndroea.</HI> Here are also <HI>Tallow,</HI> and <HI>Hides</HI> enough, if any thought it worth their While to regard them. Many o∣ther Commodities are to be found here, which deserve Notice, as <HI>Wax</HI> in such Plenty that it is thrown away; and there is <HI>Iron</HI> in many Parts of the Country, as well as here, which the Na∣tives know very well how to make <HI>Steel</HI> of; al∣so <HI>Copper</HI> of their own Production, of which they make <HI>Mannelers:</HI> These <HI>Metals</HI> I can af∣firm they have for Certainty. They have <HI>Sil∣ver</HI> in some of the most mountainous, and in∣land Parts of the Country, and know how to make <HI>Ear-plates</HI> of it, and <HI>Mannelers;</HI> so that I have the strongest Reason to think the Country produces it, as well as it does a white <HI>Metal</HI> like <HI>British Tin,</HI> or <HI>Tutaneg;</HI> nor is there much Reason to doubt, but <HI>Gold</HI> is to be had here. Many other Things would be found, which I
<PB N="394" REF="415"/>
not being able to give a satisfactory Account of, do choose to pass over. But,</P>
<P>I must not omit to mention two or three Kinds of Silk, which is in Plenty in every Part of the Island, where I have been; some of a brownish Colour: But there is one Sort white, the Out-side of it is full of very small pointed Prickles, which run into one's Fingers; the Cod, or Bag is about three Inches long, shap'd like a Nine-pin; at the Top, when we take it, is found a Hole, out of which, I have seen a blackish Worm creep: I am not able to describe the Worm, nor have I been curious e∣nough to know of it's changing it's Form, as the common Silk-worm does; yet this I know, that there are no <HI>Mulberry-Trees;</HI> but these Worms, and Silk are found on three, or four Sorts of Trees, cleaving, when they spin, to the thick Branches, or Body of the Tree. I have seen the People pull the Cod out to a Length on their Knees, with their Hands, teazing it to Pieces, and then spin it with a Spindle made of a Bone, and a Rock-staff; then they weave it as they do Cotton, and it makes verry pretty, and fine Lambers; but there is some Trouble in the managing of it, which is all the Reason I can assign for their not making more Use of it. In this Part of <HI>Saccalauvor,</HI> where the Cattle are kept, is a Tree call'd <HI>Rofeer;</HI> which is of great Use to the lower, or midling Sort of People to
<PB N="395" REF="416"/>
make Lambers of: The Leaf is like a <HI>Coco-Nut-Tree-Leaf,</HI> but longer by two Feet; they take the Outer-part off, and put the other two or three Days to dry, which is then like a long Shaving, thin, and white: Then they moisten it again, and split it into Threads, which they knot neatly together, and weave into Cloth: They often dye some of it, and make their Lam∣bers strip'd. This Tree bears a <HI>Plum</HI> almost like a <HI>Damasene.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Rer Vove</HI> had seen his Cattle, and left about two Hundred behind him, which he got by this Journey, we return'd Home to plant <HI>Rice;</HI> for the greatest Men look after their Plan∣tations themselves, and take Care to get Provi∣sion for their Families. He had not been at Home long before he had Business which call'd him to <HI>Moherbo;</HI> and by <HI>Guy</HI>'s Cunning, and In∣tercession, I got Leave to accompany him, my Desire was to see the <HI>Englishman.</HI> He soon found me out, and we were more glad to see each O∣ther than Relations who live at a Distance: His Name was <HI>William Thornbury,</HI> he had been in the Country nine Years, it was the first Voyage he made, being then a Boy, who, like me, would go to Sea; but a hard Gale of Wind suddenly arising, drove their Ship from her Anchors; and whether they saw a Pyrate, or what was the true Cause he could not tell, but they never re∣turn'd, leaving him with the Surgeon, and an∣other
<PB N="396" REF="417"/>
Man ashore; the Two last dy'd with Grief in a few Months, and he was left by him∣self. The King took what few Goods their Captain had left on Shore, sending for him, and saying <HI>He had no Occasion for any Thing; for he would provide him every Thing he wanted, and send him home by the first Ship.</HI> In all which he was as good as his Word, never attempting to make a Slave of him, as <HI>Mevarrow</HI> did of me; so that when we compar'd our Fates, mine was much the severer: He went to the King's eldest Wife for some <HI>Toak</HI> to treat me with, who readily gave it him.</P>
<P>THIS Kings Person I have already describ'd: I had heard a great deal of his cholerick, and cruel Actions before now: <HI>William Thornberry</HI> let me a little into his Character. I found, up∣on taking in the whole Account of him, that Ambition, and Glory was his chief Aim, which he look'd upon to lye in the Prosperity, and Wealth of his Country; for <HI>Saccalauvor</HI> was of very little more Account than other Countries till his Time, or less Powerful than <HI>Feraingher:</HI> But he having expell'd both his Brothers at his assuming the supreme Authority, One, as I have already related, fled to <HI>Eeraingher,</HI> and obtain'd Part of the Country to the Southward; the Other, with about eight Hundred Men, pass'd thorow the fine Country, where the Cattle are kept, and where the <HI>Virzimbers</HI> then dwelt, going
<PB N="397" REF="418"/>
on still further to the Northward, and settl'd on that River, now call'd by the <HI>Europeans, Mas∣seelege:</HI> The <HI>Virzimbers</HI> fled from him at first, but finding he meant them no Harm, and was only seeking a Place of Safety, they return'd to their Habitations, and liv'd under his Inspec∣tion. Here he founded a Kingdom, almost as large, and potent as his Brothers; which his Son, <HI>Deaan Tokeoffu,</HI> now possesses. <HI>Rer Trim∣monnongarevo</HI> finding his Brother had thus hap∣pily establish'd himself, sent Ambassadors, and concluded a League of Amity with him, he being a Man of a good humane Disposition, readily came into it; hoping God, and his Father deceas'd, <HI>Deaan Lohefute,</HI> would for∣give his Brother; and for the future bless them both.</P>
<P><HI>Rer Trimmonnongarevo</HI> now courted some of the <HI>Virzimbers,</HI> giving them Towns on the Banks of <HI>Mernee:</HI> He also was very Generous amongst his own Subjects, making many of them, who had suffer'd Losses in serving him, Presents of Cattle, and Slaves; but more especially took all the politick Ways he could, to entice People to come from other Countries to live in <HI>Sacca∣lauvor,</HI> presenting them with Slaves, and Cat∣tle. I have already mention'd how civilly he treated the <HI>Feraingher</HI> People, whose Families were at any Time taken in War, restoring all the Captives, and Cattle, if their Masters, and
<PB N="398" REF="419"/>
Relations would come, and live in his Domini∣ons: By this Means, they are grown vastly po∣pulous, and rich, the People living in Plenty, and Safety; they value, and adore him as a a beneficial Father of his Country. But see now the Danger of submitting without Restriction to the arbitrary Will, and Pleasure of any Man, even tho' he has many useful, and great Vir∣tues, and Qualifications: People thereby be∣come Slaves to the MAN, who is not in all Re∣spects an <HI>Hero;</HI> but attended with human Frail∣ties, and to Passions less governable than in Men of a lower Rank: Superior Greatness is his View, which explain'd, is advancing his prerogative Power beyond what his Predecessors did; and to shew that he can more absolutely deter∣mine according to his Will, than any of his Cotemporaries: To accomplish this, is the Itch of ambitious Princes, and to enjoy it, and let the World see it, is the titillating Lust of the vicious GREAT; and this was the Misfortune of <HI>Saccalauvor,</HI> at least that Part of it which was under the immediate civil Jurisdiction of <HI>Rer Trimmonnongarevo:</HI> For the other Lords, his Sons, and Nephews were as humane as in any other Part of the Island; but so proud was he of the Authority he had usurp'd, to shew that he could act according to his own Will, and was not to be guided by the traditional Laws; that if an Ambassador, or Strangers were at his
<PB N="399" REF="420"/>
Town, they seldom miss'd of seeing him order one of any two contending Parties to immedi∣ate Execution, for very trivial, and sometimes no Faults. He did not discover this barbarous Disposition till he was sufficiently establish'd; and then in his Choler several Instances were seen of his Cruelty: And by this Means he lost many Subjects, who went to live under Others: Some went quite out of the Country, to his Brother's Son <HI>Toakoffu,</HI> tho' they were pretty safe with his own Sons, and Nephews. And this is a Remedy which these People have against ar∣bitrary Power, they making no religious Scru∣ples of their Kings being their Master by divine Authority nor think themselves oblig'd by Ties of Religion, to suffer any Impositions. The Lords also have contracted a very humane Habit, of being proud to relieve the Distress'd, even tho' there has been Enmity before. This was <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Son's Case when he fled to <HI>Antenosa,</HI> and this very King's Brother's, <HI>Rer Mynbolambo</HI>'s, when he fled to <HI>Feraingher;</HI> and to this generous Virtue do I owe my Deliverance.</P>
<P>I was one Day among the Crowd before this King, when I heard him cough, and fetch his Breath a little uneasie, at which the People fell immediatly prostrate on the Ground; the Reason was it seems in sucha fit of shortness of Breathing: He not long before took up a Blunderbuss, and fir'd among them without speaking, and mak∣ing
<PB N="400" REF="421"/>
no other Excuse, when he had thus kill'd, and wounded two or three People; but <HI>Why did they stifle him?</HI> I never before saw such abject Slavery on the Island, and yet I must do him the Justice to say, he was far from being in all his Actions, and Determinations a bloody Ty∣rant; for except two or three Instances of se∣vere Executions for Ostentation, his other Cruelties were only row and then, the Effects of violent Passions of Choler, which grew worse in his old Age: Indeed, he more often directed corporeal Punishments than are us'd in any o∣ther Country. Here was, while I was present, a Woman came complaining to him against ano∣ther, for robbing her Mistress, one of his Wives; but in the End, the Accuser was found a vile Creature, and one, who when they ex∣amin'd her, had her Ears cut off for a former Theft. Some Embassadors were then present, (and the wicked Wretch had chosen this Time, on Purpose to accomplish the End of her Malice the more cruelly); for the People expected a bloody Decision, and it so happen'd; yet one can scarce say it was unjust, tho' very severe; for after examining with a great deal of Pati∣ence, into every minute Circumstance of the Case, he order'd the vile Accuser to be led away, and kill'd: The Accused desir'd, she might have the Pleasure of doing it herself; which he comply'd with, giving her a Sword:
<PB N="401" REF="422"/>
She soon overtook the Executioner, who, see∣ing the King's Sword, held the Criminal while the Other stabb'd her in the Throat. These are Instances enough to shew the Virtues, and Vices, and singular Disposition of this extra∣ordinary King.</P>
<P>WHILE I was here, I saw <HI>William Purser,</HI> the Interpreter, with several other principal People of <HI>Feraingher;</HI> and among the rest, my old Friend <HI>Ry-Nanno (Rer Vovvern</HI>'s Ambassa∣dor to <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> who first directed me to <HI>Feraingher)</HI> came to see me: He liv'd as great as in his own Country, having voluntarily fol∣low'd some of his Family who were taken cap∣tive.</P>
<P><HI>Rer Vove</HI> was now returning home, and my Country-man and I were to part, which we did with great Reluctancy; yet not before giving one another full Instructions where to find our Friends, whoever should be so happy to arrive in <HI>England</HI> first; which prov'd to be his good Fortune.</P>
<P>A FEW Days after we were at Home, the two Ambassadors who were at <HI>Moherbo</HI> return∣ing to their own Country, and passing thorow our Town, <HI>Rer Vove</HI> persuaded them to stay a Night with him, and allotted them an House; to which they sent for me, seating me on their own Mat between them. They said, they had a
<PB N="402" REF="423"/>
Curiosity to enquire after my Country, and Manners; and also my own Adventures: I gra∣tify'd them as well as I was able, or rather as they were capable of understanding; for they would give but little Credit to the Largeness and Grandeur of our Court, City, Fleets, and Armies, &amp;c. I, in my Turn, ask'd them where their Country lay? <HI>They said,</HI> <Q>“”It was a mountainous Inland Place divided into two Kingdoms, called <HI>Amboerlambo;</HI> and govern'd by two Brothers: They had vast large Ears, with bright silver Plates in them, glittering like Comets. I was curi∣ous to know how they came so, and they told me, When they are young a small Hole is made, and a Piece of Lead put in it at first; after the Wound is heal'd, they have a small Spring-Ring put into it, which dilates it by Degrees, and after this another till the Hole is large enough; then they place in it these silver Plates, which are neatly made, and exactly adjusted to the Hole with great Care for fear of breaking it: Some of these Holes in their Ears are large enough for a Woman's Hand to go thorow. They have Artificers among themselves who make these Orna∣ments. The poorer Sort, <HI>they said,</HI> who could not afford Silver, had them of <HI>Tuta∣neg;</HI> which they call <HI>Ferotchfutey.</HI> They come into this Country to trade with <HI>Iron;</HI> chiefly
<PB N="403" REF="424"/>
of which they make a great deal: They bring Silk also. Their Air is not healthy, the Val∣lies being foggy and marshy, and not very wholsom for Cattle, nor proper to be inhabi∣ted; so that they buy Cattle. The Mountains are so stony, that they have scarce Earth deep enough for Foundations to their Hou∣ses. <HI>They also told me,</HI> That <HI>Rer Trimmonon∣garevo</HI> will not sell them any Guns, nor suffer his People. Before Guns were brought by the <HI>Europeans</HI> on the Island, they were too strong for the <HI>Saccalauvers</HI> in <HI>Deaan Lohefutey</HI>'s Time; but this King is too powerful: They have, <HI>they say,</HI> a Trade sometimes to <HI>Matta∣tanna</HI> and <HI>Antenosa;</HI> but not sufficient to fur∣nish them with Arms and Ammunition. I found they deal very much in Metals of all Kinds.</Q></P>
<P>I liv'd pretty well hitherto, and for about three Months longer; when I heard a Ship came to <HI>Yong-Owl</HI> to trade. Her Name (as I have been since inform'd) was the <HI>Clapham-Gal'y,</HI> Capt. <HI>Wilks,</HI> Commander. Every One who had Slaves to sell, carry'd them down to the Sea∣side: My Master was also preparing some. I was over-joy'd at the Thought, but could not tell which Way to move my Request. At length I went to my Friend <HI>Guy</HI>'s House, and expostulating the Case with him and his Wife, prevail'd on him to desire my Master to
<PB N="404" REF="425"/>
send me down, and sell me to the Captain; which he did one Evening when I was ab∣sent: And it was well I was, for had it not been for the Intercession of some Friends, he would immediately have found me out, and shot me. When I came to him he bid me deliver him my Gun, saying, <Q>“I was a Captive taken in War, and a Slave; and he would make me know it. <HI>Will,</HI> he said, was an unfortunate Lad left by Accident on Shoar; his Case was therefore different. <HI>So calling his Cook,</HI> Here, <HI>Mechorow, says he,</HI> Take this white Slave, and see he works under you like other Slaves.”</Q> <HI>Mecho∣row</HI> did not fail to obey his Orders, using me so much the worse; because I had before some Command over him. He often made me carry an Iron-pot on my Head, when <HI>Rer Vove</HI> and his Wife went for their Pleasure on the Islands in the Middle of the River <HI>Mernee;</HI> where some∣times he would go to kill <HI>Wild Fowl,</HI> and de∣stroy <HI>Alligators.</HI> But before the Ship went away, I endeavour'd to inform the Captain by this Means: I took a Satter-Leaf about two Inches broad, and a Foot and half long, marking on it these Words: <HI>Robert Drury, Son of Mr. Drury, living at the King's Head in the Old Jury; now a Slave on the Island of Madagascar, in the Country of Morandavo, alias Yong-Owl.</HI> I desir'd a Man, who was going to the Sea-side, to deliver this to any of the white Men; but when he return'd,
<PB N="405" REF="426"/>
<HI>I ask'd him,</HI> <Q>“What they said to it? <HI>He answer'd,</HI> He suppos'd the white Man to whom he gave it did not like it, for he threw it away; and I am sure it was as good an One as that you gave me; for it's true I dropp'd yours, but I pull'd one of the best I could find from a Tree.”</Q> My Heart was so full at this Dis∣appointment, that I turn'd away from him, and went into the Woods to vent my Sorrow by weeping. I soon heard that <HI>Will. Thornbury</HI> was dismiss'd, and was in some Hopes of his work∣ing my Redemption. But in a little time I heard the Ship was sail'd, and not one Word of me mention'd. This made me distracted with Dispair, and what was the Reason the Captain took no Notice of me, I am still at a Loss to know; for <HI>Will. Thornbury</HI> to be sure could not help mentioning me.</P>
<P>SOON after this, I was taken with a Pain and Soreness in my Bones; which I, at first, took for a Cold; but it encreas'd so, that I could not walk without two Sticks: This held for three Months, and then I began to have Blot∣ches break out all over my Body; my Neigh∣bours soon found it was the <HI>Colah,</HI> or <HI>Yaws,</HI> and <HI>Rer Vove</HI> sent me to a <HI>Virzimber</HI>'s House on the Banks of <HI>Mernee</HI> to be cur'd. They took the Bark of a Tree, which I know not the Name of, steeping it in Water; With this they wash'd, and bath'd me every Day, which in some Weeks
<PB N="406" REF="427"/>
Time made my Bones easier; and in a few Weeks more the Sores cleans'd, and wore away; after which I recover'd my Strength. The whole Time was six Months, which I liv'd with these <HI>Virzimbers.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are almost a different Species of Peo∣ple from the others▪ Their Heads are of a very singular Shape, the hinder Part as flat as a Trencher, and the Forehead very near so; which I do not think to be natural, but fram'd thus by pressing▪ and squeezing the Children from their Birth. Their Hair is not long as the other Na∣tives, nor perfectly woolly; tho' near so. Their Religion is also differing; they having no <HI>Ow∣leys</HI> in their Houses, paying a Veneration to the <HI>New Moon,</HI> and to several Animals, as a <HI>Cock,</HI> a <HI>Lizard,</HI> and some others. Whether or no they think these Creatures have <HI>Spirits,</HI> or <HI>Dae∣mons</HI> attending them I cannot say; for they speaking among themselves, when they pleass'd, a peculiar Language, of which I could learn but a few Words; I was not able to penetrate far into their Reasons for these Particularities. When they sit down to Meals, they take a Bit of Meat, and throw it over their Heads, saying, <HI>There's a Bit for the Spirit:</HI> Then they out four more little Bits, and throw to the Lords of the four Quarters of the Earth. This is the ge∣neral Practice of those who have a Regard to Religion, but there are many who neglect it;
<PB N="407" REF="428"/>
as some in <HI>Europe</HI> do <HI>Saying Grace to their Meals.</HI> They dress their Victuals in much better Or∣der than the other People; always boiling <HI>Plan∣tins</HI> or <HI>Potatoes</HI> with their Meat, and making good Soop thicken'd well as in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THEY make very good Earthen Ware, as Pots, Dishes, and Jugs, glazing them within and without; and are very ingenious Artificers in many other Things. Notwithstanding their superior Ingenuity, I could not find that ever they form'd themselves into regular Kingdoms, or large Common-wealths, herding together in Towns; each Town being a distinct and inde∣pendent Common-wealth, which frequently produc'd Quarrels and Wars, one little Town against another: There being no general Law, or Government, which could adjust their Claims, and determine Differences between one Town and another; till they in this Part came to live under <HI>Rer Trimmenongarevo,</HI> and others under <HI>Deaan Tokeoffu.</HI> There are more of them, as I have heard, in other Parts of the Island dispers'd about, and shifting their Habitations; which these us'd to do formerly. I am apt to think, it wou'd not be easy to determine, whether these are not the Original Natives, or first In∣habitants of the Island. I remark'd here, that Difference in Religion is no Crime, nor Offence to each other: Also that they have no Priests any more than the others.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="429"/>
I having now almost recover'd my Strength, began to think of the Misery of returning to my former Slavery; and therefore, after some De∣bate with myself, I resolv'd to run the Hazard of throwing myself at <HI>Rer Moume</HI>'s Feet to beg his Protection, let the Consequence be as it would; Death was better than perpetual Sla∣very. Accordingly one Morning, I desir'd my Landlord to put me over the River in his Ca∣noe, pretending only to go a little Way on a Visit to a Friend; it not being above two Hours Walk to <HI>Rer Moume</HI>'s Town.</P>
<P>WHEN I came there, I found him sitting under a Kind of Pent-house, with his Wives about him: I laid down, and lick'd his Feet, then rising on my Knees I held up my Hands, <Q>“Craving Mercy and Protection from the ill usage of my Master <HI>Rer Vove;</HI> he having reduc'd me to the most abject Slavery, for only getting a Friend beg him to sell me (not to give me) to my Country-men; that I might once more see my dear Parents, from whom I had been so many Years absent. My Master told me I was his Slave, taken in War, tho' I was no otherwise there, than <HI>Will.</HI> was here, a poor unfortu∣nate Wretch roving about any where, till I could find an Opportunity to get to my Na∣tive Country, and was not his Enemy, nor taken in Arms: If you deliver me to him he will kill me, and there will be an End of my
<PB N="409" REF="430"/>
Misery; but I hope for more Mercy from you.”</Q> I soon perceiv'd my melancholy Story mov'd his Compassion; for the Tears stood in his Eyes, and some of the Women wept. <Q>“He bid me rise, and rest satisfy'd, that he would not de∣liver me up to <HI>Rer Vove.</HI> If my Kinsman wants Slaves, <HI>says he,</HI> to work, (tho' I know he does not) I will send him two, or three in your Room; therefore be not afraid, I will pro∣tect, and provide for you: Then turning to one of his Wives, Here, <HI>says he, Ry Anzacker,</HI> be you from henceforth <HI>Robin</HI>'s Mother, and see he wants for nothing; I shall desire no o∣ther Service, <HI>says he to me,</HI> of you, but to see my Chest of Arms, which are more than an hundred, kept clean, and my Flints, and Shot kept in order; and you shall have Ser∣vants to do the Work.”</Q> Then callïng a Slave, order'd him to build me a House next to my Mother's, within his Pallisade. In two Days Time I was a House-keeper; <HI>Ry Anzacker</HI> pro∣ving very kind to me, and I never walk'd out without a Gun like a Freeman.</P>
<P>A few Days after came Messengers from <HI>Rer Vove</HI> to <HI>Rer Moume,</HI> I was present when they demanded in their Lord's Name, his white Slave: <HI>Rer Moume</HI> examin'd them first, to know if what I had told him was true, and when he found it so, he said, <Q>“”I am sorry my Kins∣man is so inconsiderate a young Man to act
<PB N="410" REF="431"/>
thus! Whoever saw before, a white Man a Slave to a black Man's Cook-Slave? except among the worst of Brutes in that unpolish'd Country <HI>Anterndroea.</HI> It was not just for him to force him against his Will from <HI>Feraingher,</HI> and when he had been here, it would have been like a wise, and good Man to have gone, to the <HI>English</HI> Captain, and presented <HI>Robin</HI> to him; making a Merit of taking Care of him, by this Means he had done a generous Action, and it would have been an Honour to himself, and to us all: He surely forgets the Benefits we have from the <HI>English,</HI> and that till they brought us Arms, we were in∣sulted by all our Neighbours. Here, take this Woman-Slave and give him, she is able to do him more Work than <HI>Robin,</HI> if he wants Work from him: I do assure you, I shall make no Slave of him, he may go now when he will, and live any where else, if he don't like to stay with me; even to <HI>Rer Vove</HI> again if he pleases: But not till I am assur'd he shall be better treated. Here take the Wo∣man in his Room.</Q> But they came again the next Day with the Woman, renewing their Yes∣terday's Request, to which he gave a peremp∣tory Answer, that <HI>They should not have me.</HI></P>
<P>I was here treated with great Civility by all the King's Wives, tho' more especially by my Mother, <HI>Ry Anzacker;</HI> they delighting to
<PB N="411" REF="432"/>
hear me relate my Misfortunes, and Adventures: I us'd to go often with <HI>Rer Moume</HI> to a broad Lake, with Islands in it, several Miles round, call'd the <HI>Kereende<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> This Place was drown'd formerly by the <HI>Mernees</HI> breaking its Banks▪ <HI>Rer Moume</HI> was always carry'd in a Conveniency, not altogether unlike a Sedan, without a Cover∣ing; and had a Canoe large enough to admit twenty Men, in which was a Seat made purpose∣ly for him; he not being able to set on the Floor as other People did: Several other Ca∣noes of ten Hands, and Five, and some small ones of two Hands us'd to accompany him. Our Business was Fowling, and Fishing, in which the <HI>Virzimbers</HI> are very dexterous, ma∣king Nets of different Sorts, and also Fish-hooks for Angling; which <HI>Rer Moume</HI> took Delight in. His Son, <HI>Rer Chulu,</HI> diverted himself of∣ten with killing <HI>Alligators;</HI> the most common Way he us'd was with a Harpoon, the Head fix'd on, and a Rope was fasten'd to the Steel, and Staff both; they paddle along the Water toward the <HI>Alligator,</HI> whom they commonly espy at a Distance, they keeping their Noses above Water, and appear like a Cake of Cow∣dung floating: When they come within ten, or a dozen Yards, he sinks to the Bottom, crawl∣ing a good Way before he stops; but his Path is discover'd by a Bubble rising up, and where the Bubble stands, there they strike; for after
<PB N="412" REF="433"/>
a Noise is made, they lye flat on their Bellies, with their Sides press'd out, so that they are frequently stabb'd with the Harpoon; tho' when it lights on their Backs, or Heads, it makes no more Entrance than it would on a Rock. The <HI>Virzimbers</HI> make a Net of Ropes, with large Mashes, and with these they sometimes take them; they also take them with a Snare, made with a Spring-stick, which draws up a Noose in a Rope; these they place at the Mouth of a Rivulet, or small Canal: And by these Ways, I have known <HI>Rer Chulu,</HI> and his Com∣pany destroy twenty or thirty in a Day.</P>
<P><HI>Rer Moume</HI> presented me with three Cows, which in four Months calv'd; and one Day as I was sitting by him, he ask'd, <HI>Why I did not take a Wife?</HI> I told him, <HI>I could not maintain One, and that at present I liv'd well, and better than I could with a Woman.</HI> He said, <HI>It was not decent for a Man to live without a Wife; and as for maintaining her, I will enable you to do that, and recommend a Woman to you.</HI> So finding him persist in it, I suffer'd myself to be perswaded; but with this Condition, <HI>That he should not command the Woman, but ask her if she was wil∣ling, and leave it to her Choice;</HI> which he readi∣ly agreed to. So sending for one of my Mo∣ther's Maids, he told her the Case, and that <HI>If she lik'd me, she should be my Wife;</HI> and bid her <HI>speak freely, for he did not design to force her.</HI> But
<PB N="413" REF="434"/>
she very cheerfully said, <HI>She approv'd of it.</HI> Then <HI>Ry Anzacker</HI> took her back again to dress her up very fine with Beads, and a silk Lamber, &amp;c. and brought her to me. I desir'd the Prince to make a formal Marriage, by taking her Hand, and asking us both, <HI>If we were willing?</HI> and then giving her to me by the Hand; which he readily gratify'd me in, with a great deal of good Nature, and was very merry; as were also the Women, as is usual on such Occasions: And the Ladies attended us Home, not empty handed, for they gave us a great deal of such Furniture as we wanted. The next Day the Prince gave me a Plantation with <HI>Rice</HI> growing, and <HI>Potatoes</HI> &amp;c. fit to dig: He presented me also with a Slave, a Boy about sixteen Years of Age; and a few Days after, he sent me with others to fetch some Cattle from a Man, who was prov'd guilty before him of stealing some Beasts from his Neighbours; for which he was fin'd twenty Beeves. This was the first Time he ever sent me on such an Errand, tho' not the last, and People of the best Rank are fond of going; for they always have a good Present for their Pains. He gave me a Cow with her Calf, and a young Bull of three Years old. I went on such Occasions afterward, and never had less for my Labour than one Beast, and some∣times Two; so that I was rich, and sent most of my Cattle four Miles off, agreeing with a Man
<PB N="414" REF="435"/>
to give him every tenth Calf out of those he should bring up for me; keeping only three Cows at Home for their Milk: So that I liv'd now as happy as the Country would admit of, even so much to my Satisfaction, that had it not been for the Hopes of seeing my Father and Mother, I don't know whether I should have taken much Pains to have come to <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> and even when I wish'd for that, I was very easy, not doubting but <HI>William Thornbury</HI> would let my Friends know where I was.</P>
<P>SOME Months after this, <HI>Rer Vove</HI> sent Word he was coming to visit his Uncle; which I no sooner heard, than I went to <HI>Rer Moume,</HI> telling him, <HI>I was going for three or four Days to visit his Son,</HI> Rer Chemunghoher. <HI>Rer Moume</HI> told me, <HI>He knew what I meant, but I had no Occasion to fear</HI> Rer Vove; <HI>for he should not have me against my Will, advising me to stay, and see him;</HI> which I did. After some Business was talk'd of, and they had drank <HI>Toak</HI> together, he look'd to∣ward me, telling his Uncle, <HI>He wonder'd he should treat him so uncivilly, as to keep his Slave from him. Rer Moumc</HI> told him, <HI>He did not know he had any Slave of his, and if he would name him, he should be restor'd. Why</HI> THERE <HI>he stands,</HI> says <HI>Rer Vove.</HI> WHO? says the Uncle, <HI>I hope you don't mean</HI> Robin, <HI>the white Man. Is he your Slave? I am asham'd of your Folly. Is it not by the white Men, and particularly by his Countrymen the</HI>
<PB N="415" REF="436"/>
English, <HI>that we are become rich. We, who us'd to be insulted heretofore by the</HI> Amboerlambo <HI>People, and other neighbouring Nations, are by these</HI> Eng∣lish-mens <HI>Guns made too strong for them; and by the</HI> Beads, Looking-glasses, &amp;c. <HI>which they bring in abundance, our late Enemies are become Petitioners to us to trade with them: And is it not, think you, a fine Story for</HI> Will. <HI>to tell, that one of his Countrymen, who was shipwreck'd in this Country, is made a Slave of by one of the black Lords of</HI> Morandavo? <HI>But to shew you that I don't make a Slave of him, he is now at his Liberty to go any where as he pleases, and take his Wife, Slave, and Cattle with him; even with you, if you can perswade him, and give me Assurance of your making a Free∣man of him.</HI> Thus did he reason with his Ne∣phew, and reproach him with the Indiscre∣tion, and Barbarity of treating a distress'd Man ill, till he convinc'd him of his Mistake; inso∣much that he turn'd to me, and desir'd I would come in the Evening, and see him, which I did. When I enter'd the House I lick'd his Knee, by way of Respect, but not his Feet; to let him see that I knew myself to be a Free∣man. He us'd a great many Arguments to perswade me to go to live with him, and pro∣mis'd me great Things; which I don't know but he would have perform'd: For he was not a very ill Man, only wild, and a little too inconsiderate, and thoughtless. He also
<PB N="416" REF="437"/>
set <HI>Guy</HI> to work, who made Use of one very tempting Argument; that <HI>Rer Vove</HI> was go∣ing to travel into other Kings Dominions, out of Curiosity to see their different Manners, and Customs. I told <HI>Guy</HI> the true Reason why I would not; which was, that I wa a great deal nearer the Sea than when with them; and I did not doubt, but <HI>Rer Moume</HI> would send me Home when a Ship came. I sat after this, and drank <HI>Toak</HI> with them, took my Leave, and was returning homeward; when <HI>Rer Vove</HI> follow'd me, and desir'd I would never speak of his A∣mour with his Kinsman's Wife; which I as∣sur'd him I would not mention while I liv'd here, and we parted good Friends. It is not unworthy of our Remark, that this gay young Man should so easily concede to his Uncle's Arguments; hear him with Reverence, and be convinc'd by Reason.</P>
<P>I liv'd thus with <HI>Rer Moume,</HI> as easy, and happy as he could make me, and thought my Misfortunes were at an End; except that of be∣ing in a Foreign Country: But my angry Fate had yet one more horrid Scene of Danger to fright me with, before I parted from this Island; and it was as terrible, and shocking to human Nature, as any I had yet undergone; and the more so, because unexpected by myself, and every Body else, which was thus introduc'd. There liv'd at <HI>Mobarbo,</HI> one <HI>Francisco,</HI> an inof∣fensive
<PB N="417" REF="438"/>
good Man, born in the <HI>East Indies</HI> of <HI>Portuguese</HI> Parents; but black as many of them are: He had liv'd here many Years to his Satis∣faction, never intending to go to <HI>Europe,</HI> or re∣move from off the Island; he had been taken by Pyrates, who, at his Request, set him ashoar▪ This Man, tho' bred, as he said, to Surgery; yet had a mechanical Genius, especially to <HI>Join∣ers</HI> and <HI>Carpenters</HI> Business; and had accordingly furnish'd himself with Tools fit for his Purpose, and us'd often to oblige the Princes and Lords with making them Chests, &amp;c. <HI>Rer Moume</HI> sent, and desir'd him to get Leave of <HI>Rer Trimmonon∣garevo</HI> to come, and make him a Chest, which he did; he spoke the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Language, so that we were agreable Companions. He told me, as Part of his History, that he was passio∣nately in Love with a young Woman; whose Parents, tho' they did not absolutely forbid his Pretences, yet did not incline to the Match. After staying with us about two Months, and fi∣nishing what <HI>Rer Moume</HI> had to do, he was dis∣miss'd with generous Presents of Cattle.</P>
<P>AFTER he had been at Home some Months, I, with <HI>Rer Moume</HI>'s Leave, went to <HI>Moherbo</HI> to visit him, and found him very ill and melan∣choly; his Mistress having been marry'd in his Absence, which he took to Heart. He had made her several valuable Presents, and receiv'd her Promise of Marriage; which Presents he de∣manded of her Parents again, and on their Re∣fusal
<PB N="418" REF="439"/>
complain'd to the King; he being in Es∣teem, and always near him. His Request was nevertheless refus'd, the King saying, <HI>He would not interpose with Parents disposing of their Children.</HI> On which <HI>Francisco</HI> indiscretely said before he was gone out of hearing, that as soon as he was recover'd, he would go away from <HI>Moherbo,</HI> and live under <HI>Rer Moume.</HI> Now by that Time I had been here a few Days, and his Strength began to return, I went with him among the Crowd to the King's Court: As I was standing by him, the King espying me, look'd with a stern Counte∣nance, and ask'd, <HI>Who that white Man was with his Gun on his Shoulder? Francisco</HI> answer'd, <HI>It was</HI> Rer Moume<HI>'s white Man, who came to see him.</HI> <Q>“Is it so, <HI>says he,</HI> then I know his Business?—Come hither.—What do you here?”</Q> I, know∣ing his barbarous Disposition, answer'd faintly and trembling, <HI>Only to visit my sick Friend.</HI> <Q>“Yes, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> your Friend there said he would go to your Master <HI>Rer Moume,</HI> as soon as he was well, and you are come to conduct him; but I will prevent your Design.—Here, <HI>Mesoro (the common Executioner)</HI> take this white Slave, lead him to the usual Place, and dispatch him, and bring me his Gun.”</Q> The People were struck with Surprize as well as my∣self; but I was lead out, Multitudes following me, many of them desir'd only to shake Hands, and take their Leave; which the Executio∣ner permitted. I was so prodigiously shock'd
<PB N="419" REF="440"/>
with this Tyger-like Leap, which this savage Brute made at my Life, that I was stunn'd and stupid, not knowing whether I was in a Dream till I came to the Place of Execution, where I saw the Bones of several Wretches unbury'd; and then I began to weep piteously, and recom∣mend myself to God to receive my Soul. <Q>“What a shocking Change was this! I, who but a few Minutes before, was among none but Friends, with my Mind innocent, and clear of Evil, and Malice; my Actions inoffensive, and no Man complaining of Injury from me, should be now under the Pains of Death, by the Hand of a common Executioner, like a vile Male∣factor, only to gratify the Rage of a doating, cholerick, old Savage.”</Q> While I was ex∣claiming, and crying <HI>Where is Justice either in God, or Man?</HI> and the People idly lamenting my hard Misfortune instead of turning on the Monster, and delivering themselves from his Tyranny, a Voice was heard calling at a Di∣stance, <HI>Stay,—stay,—don't kill</HI> Robin. It was soon repeated, and the Messenger came forward, ordering me to be brought back: At which the People gave a general Shout of Gladness. When I came before him, the oldest of his Wives was on her Knees crying; all the rest too, as well as other Women, and some Men; telling him he would bring Ruine, and irretrievable Misery on the Country, which his great Grand-children would feel the Effect of, when the white Men
<PB N="420" REF="441"/>
should know his Cruelty to one of their Coun∣try-Men, who was evidently innocent too. This at length, mov'd him to a little Abatement of his Rage, and he told me, <Q>“I might thank them, else I had been Dog's-Meat by this Time; but, <HI>says he,</HI> I have not done with you▪ Here, <HI>says he to three Men,</HI> take him bound as he is, and carry him to <HI>Rer Moume</HI> with his Gun; and tell my Son, I desire he will treat him like a Slave as he is, and not let him va∣pour about, like a Lord, with his Gun on his Shoulder.”</Q> I fell down, and lick'd his Feet, the People making Signs to me so to do: He bid me thank the Women, I went to <HI>Ry Chemetoe,</HI> and one or two others, and did it with a great deal of Sincerity; for to them only I ow'd my Life.</P>
<P>WE went directly away on our Journey, and as we pass'd through any Town, the People ask'd with Wonder, <HI>What the white Man had done to be thus bou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d?</HI> To whom my Guard did not dis∣guise the Case in the King's Favour, telling all the Truth; which every One seem'd to pity, and resent. When we came to lye down to Sleep, they ask▪d me, <HI>If I would have my Hands loos'd?</HI> I ask'd <HI>What Orders they had?</HI> They said, <HI>Strict Command to keep me bound. Then,</HI> says I, <HI>you shall not run the Hazard of your Lives, tho' it is painful to me.</HI> So I lay as well as I could all Night, and travell'd in the same Manner the next Day, every now and then looking behind me, fearing he should change his Mind, and send
<PB N="421" REF="442"/>
Some-body after us to kill me; for I could not think myself safe till I was with <HI>Rer Moume</HI> again.</P>
<P>IN my Journey, my Guards told me, I was the First that was ever brought back alive from the▪ Place of Execution; which I could not but a∣scribe to a special Providence. They likewise inform'd me, that he stabb'd one of his Princi∣pal Wives (tho' he repented it when his Passion was over) for breaking Wind downwards, whilst he laid his Head in her Lap, intending to sleep. Another Instance I heard, I cannot say, whether of his Justice or Cruelty, was, In ordering one of his Sons to be laid on a Mat, and his Throat to be cut before his Face, for lying with one of his Wives.</P>
<P>We could not reach there this Evening by two Hours Walk, so we rested; and early in the Morning went forward, and arriv'd at our own Town; where the People were strangely sur∣priz'd to see me thus bound, and guarded: Some ran before to acquaint the Prince, who, by that Time we came within his Pallisade, was sitting with his Wives, and a Number of People, in great Expectation. The Men being seated told the Message, I was standing all the While with my Hands bound behind me. After he had exa∣min'd them strictly, and found how it was, his Countenance chang'd; sometimes the Tears stood in his Eyes as he look'd at me with Pity, and sometimes he frown'd with Anger; the Wo∣men wept. <Q>“And is this all, <HI>says he,</HI> the poor
<PB N="422" REF="443"/>
Man has been so us'd for? Come hither, <HI>Ro∣bin,</HI> you shall all see what Regard I have to my Father's Advice in this Case.”</Q> On which he unbound me with his own Hands, and or∣der'd his People to fetch out a fine silk Lamber, which he made me put on immediately; then taking the Gun from the Men, gave it me, and said he would present me with six Cows. I told him the Messengers were very civil to me, for which he thank'd them, and made them a Pre∣sent of an Ox. <Q>“It is true, <HI>says he,</HI> he is my Father who has done this, I will restrain my Passion and Resentment, and say as little as possible; but if any other Man, tho' a near Relation, or even my own Son had acted thus, I would have had severe Satisfaction.”</Q> My Wife came also, and lick'd my Feet, expressing her Concern for my Trouble, and Joy for my Deliverance: This was about a Year, and a quarter from the Time I came first to <HI>Rer Moume.</HI></P>
<P>I had now about thirty Head of Cattle, and liv'd very easy and happy. I kill'd a young Bullock, and flead that Part I kept to myself, salting it after the <HI>English</HI> Manner; and made a tolerable Shift to make Candles of the Tal∣low; that which I presented to my Neighbours I left the Skin on, for we have the same neigh∣bourly and friendly Customs here, as in other Parts of the Island, neither are their Manners in any Thing differing; except in the silly Cus∣tom of the King's Family killing Cattle. Swine's
<PB N="423" REF="444"/>
Flesh too is eat here, and accounted as good as any Thing else. <HI>Rer Chulu</HI> kept a Pack of Dogs on purpose to hunt <HI>Wild Boars,</HI> but these Dogs are not of the <HI>Hound</HI>-kind. The Religion is also the same exactly, and their superstitious Regard to unlucky Days and Hours as the <HI>Ʋmossee</HI> tells them; insomuch that many poor Children are privately murder'd, who are born on an <HI>Alhaida,</HI> or on a <HI>Jumor,</HI> which are <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Friday;</HI> for I took good Notice when I came on board the Ship, to remark how the Days answer'd with ours; and found that <HI>Alhaida</HI> is Sunday, <HI>Alle∣tenine</HI> Monday, <HI>Talawter</HI> Tuesday, <HI>Alarrerbere</HI> Wednesday, <HI>Comemeeshey</HI> Thursday, <HI>Jumor</HI> Fri∣day, <HI>Sarbuchee,</HI> Saturday. These Names are general to the whole Island, but they regard not one Day more than another, only as they think some are lucky, and some unlucky Days; for here is no Resemblance, or Notion of a Sabbath amongst them. <HI>Rer Moume</HI> sent to all Parts of the Island, wherever he heard of a famous <HI>Ʋmos∣see,</HI> to consult with him on his Loss of Limbs; for they are Physicians: One of them, while I was here, shut him up for two Months, bathing, sweating, and cupping him, but to little Pur∣pose; nevertheless he made him ample Satis∣faction for his Trouble, as he did all the others; or indeed every One who did him any Service.</P>
<P>I liv'd with <HI>Rer Moume</HI> about two Years and a half, at the End of which Time News was brought, that two Ships were arriv'd at <HI>Yong-Owl,</HI>
<PB N="424" REF="445"/>
to trade. I was overjoy'd at the News, and hop'd <HI>William Thornbury</HI> would not forget me; but they were there several Days, and Slaves were sent down to be sold, and Guns, and other Goods brought from them. I could not tell how to break my Mind to <HI>Rer Moume,</HI> hoping he would of his own Accord mention something to me; but one Evening, as I was sit∣ting with him, came two Men with a Basket of <HI>Palmetto</HI> Leaves sow'd up, and gave it to the Prince: He open'd it, and, finding a Letter, ask'd the Men, <Q>“What they meant by giving him that? <HI>They said,</HI> The Captain gave it us for your white Man; but we thought pro∣per to let you see it first. Pray, <HI>says he,</HI> give it him all. Here <HI>Robin,</HI> your Country-men have sent you a Present, I don't know what you may think on it, but it seems to me of very little Value.”</Q> I took the Basket, and found the Letter, with Pens, Ink, and Paper for me to answer it: The Letter was directed to <HI>Robert Drury, on the Island of Madagascar.</HI> I was so surpris'd, I had not Power to open it, think∣ing I was in a Dream; but at length, recovering my Senses a little, I open'd it, and found it was from Capt. <HI>William Macket,</HI> to inform me, <HI>That he had a Letter on Board from my Father, with full Instructions as well from him as his Owners to procure my Liberty, let it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st what it would; and if I could not come down to him myself, to send him Word the Reason, and which Way he should take to serve me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="446"/>
<HI>Rer Moume</HI> observ'd my Countenance change while I read the Letter, and ask'd me, <Q>“What was the Matter? <HI>I told him,</HI> The Cap∣tain wanted to speak with me; and that my Father had sent for me Home, if he would please to give me Leave to go. How do you know this? <HI>Says the Prince.</HI> Are you a Conjurer? <HI>Then calling to the Messengers ask'd them,</HI> If they heard any such Thing. Yes, <HI>said they,</HI> It is in every One's Mouth at the Sea-side, that <HI>Robin</HI>'s Father has sent these two Ships for him; and more than this, the King, your Father, expects him down there, if you give him Leave, and desires to see him before he goes to the Ship.”</Q> <HI>Rer Moume</HI> took the Letter, turn'd it about, and up-side down, say∣ing, he had often heard of these Ways of con∣veying Intelligence, but never saw it before; and could not imagine how it could be done without Conjuration. I shew'd him as well as I could how we learn'd it when Children; the Marks first, and then put them together. <Q>“But, <HI>says he, Robin,</HI> I suppose, you don't desire to go now you live so well here; you have Cat∣tle, and a Slave, and may have more if you want them; and as many Wives as you please, and be a great Man.”</Q> I desir'd he would please to make my Case his own, and think whe∣ther he would not desire to see his Parents and Native Country, had he been absent so long? He told me, he did think he should; and there∣fore
<PB N="426" REF="447"/>
would consider of it, consult with his Wives, and give an Answer in the Morning.</P>
<P>I did not fail to attend him as soon as he was stirring, and seated with his Wives, sitting down right before him: After he had look'd on me a good While, <Q><HI>“Robin, says he,</HI> I have con∣sulted with my Wives here; your Mother <HI>Ry Anzacker,</HI> and two, or three more, are for your going; but most are against it: How∣ever, let them answer for themselves, it is out of Love to you, that they would have you continue amongst them.”</Q> On which I turn'd toward them, and without waiting to hear them, desir'd, as they were Mothers, they world imagine if a Child of theirs was in a strange Country, they should not have a long∣ing Desire to see him, and he them. The Prince then told me, <Q>“If I would stay, he would treat me as he had hitherto done, like his own Son, but he would do me no Injustice; and if I had a Mind to go he would dismiss me: And this is my Resolution; your Slave you shall take with you, and as to your Cattle, they are yours, dispose of them as you please. <HI>I told him,</HI> I did intend to come again to see him, and if he pleas'd not to take my Cattle, which were in Truth his own, he might let them remain as they were mark'd for mine: And that I design'd to make one Voyage here a∣gain; in Hopes of making him some Amends for the great Care he had taken of me; by bringing a Ship to trade with him: (And in
<PB N="427" REF="448"/>
this I was in earnest, and as good as my Word.) <HI>I ask d him,</HI> If he would please to demand any Thing of the Captain for my Liberty. <HI>He answer'd,</HI> He desir'd nothing, but if I and my Friends would make him a Present of a Gun, he should be oblig'd to them, and would call it <HI>Robin,</HI> and keep it in Remembrance of me.”</Q> kneel'd down, and lick'd his Feet with great Sin∣cerity, as justly thinking I could never express Gratitude enough to this generous good Prince. He would not dismiss me this Day, but took Care of the Messengers; and I had as much Re∣luctancy in parting with my Wife, and the Women of his Family and himself, as I had when I went from my natural Parents, and they discover'd as much tender Affection; but he would not let us go empty, ordering an Ox to be giv'n us for our Subsistence on the Journey, with two of his own People to accompany the other two; and at length we set forward.</P>
<P>I had yet one suspicious Circumstance more to go through, and that was, as we pass'd by <HI>Mo∣herbo,</HI> to call on <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo:</HI> This gave me some Uneasiness, but when we came near the Town, we heard he was gone to a Place with∣in an Hour's Walk of the Sea-side. When I came before him, he scrupl'd not to make an Apology for his unhappy cholerick Constitu∣tion; and own'd, <Q>“That he had sometimes done Mischief in his Passion, but hop'd I would ex∣cuse him for what had pass'd, and said he was
<PB N="428" REF="449"/>
afraid to let me go till the Ship was near on sailing, lest I should spoil the Trade. <HI>I told him,</HI> That I had nothing to complain of, since his Son had been so very good to me; and that if himself would please to dismiss me at my Friends Request, they would take it kind∣ly; but if he detain'd me now they know I am so near, I did not know what might be the Consequence.”</Q> However, he kept me this Night, but in the Morning dismiss'd me with his Blessing; praying <HI>that God and the Daemons would protect me, and send me safe Home to my Native Country.</HI> So I lick'd his Feet, and took my Leave of him, and of this Custom too; for this was the last Time I lick'd a black Man's Feet.</P>
<P>WHEN I came down to the Sea-side, the first Man who spoke to me was <HI>William Purser;</HI> the same with whom I was acquainted in <HI>Feraingher:</HI> He came away, as Others did, to live in more Security and Plenty; he was the Interpreter for the Trade. Here were several Houses, but such as the <HI>English</HI> call Huts, built by the Inhabitants, at a little Distance from the Factory, for the Conveniency of selling Milk, and other Provisi∣ons. When I came there, I met Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> the Steward of the <HI>Drake,</HI> Capt. <HI>Macket</HI>'s Ship, and two, or three more of their People; who took me for a wild Man: And in a Letter he wrote, and sent off by a Canoe to the Captain, he said <HI>The wild</HI> English-man <HI>was come.</HI> I desir'd <HI>Wil∣liam Purser</HI> to tell them, that I could speak but
<PB N="429" REF="450"/>
little <HI>English,</HI> tho' the few Days I was with <HI>Will. Thornbury</HI> I regain'd some; yet I was at a great Loss for Words to speak currently for several Days. Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> soon came on Shoar, and with him Capt. <HI>Bloom;</HI> for here were two Ships, the <HI>Drake,</HI> and the <HI>Sarah.</HI> I star'd at them as if I had never seen a white Man cloath'd before; and what added to the Wildness of my Appear∣ance, I was naked except the Lamber, my Skin swarthy, and full of Freckles, my Hair long, and felted together, so that I really made a fright∣ful Appearance to them; but they soon restor'd me to an <HI>European</HI> Form: Mr. <HI>Hill</HI> cut off my Hair, and order'd me to be shav'd, and cloath'd in a neat Seaman's Habit, light and fit for the hot Country. The Captain ask'd me, <HI>What he must give for my Ransom?</HI> I told him, <HI>Nothing was requir'd, only a Gun for a Present, to be kept in Re∣membrance of me.</HI> He, therefore, pick'd out a handsome, and very good Buccaneer Gun, also some Powder, and Flints, and a Case of Spirits as a Present to <HI>Rer Moume.</HI> He also presented his two Men with Knives and Beads, and the Messengers which went for me had a small Gun. I presented the Captain with my Slave <HI>Anthony,</HI> he then gave me my Father's Letter, which he brought thus directed, and is as follows.</P>

<P>I Am inform'd by one Mr. Thornbury, that he left you in Health on the Island of Madagascar? which I was glad
<PB N="430" REF="451"/>
to hear: My very good Friend Mr. Terry hath a Friend, Commander of a Ship, the Bearer hereof, that hath promis'd to do all be can to get you at Liberty, I therefore desire you to do the Captain all the Service that you can in the Coun∣try: And in so doing you will oblige our good Friend Mr. Ter∣ry, and your ever loving Father till Death,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>IN two, or three Days after I went aboard; but the Sea, and Change of Meat and Drink, made me very sick for three or four Days; after which I accompany'd the two Captains to <HI>Rer Trimmo∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>garevo,</HI> to whom they went in Order to settle some Circumstances relating to the trade: This being the general Custom all over the Island, the King of each Place makes Terms, and set∣tles one universal Price, to which all the People are oblig'd to conform; and this renders Trading very easy, and free from Quarrels and Distur∣bances. They presented the King with a fine Gun, gilded on the Barrel, and japan'd. I was the Linguist, and notwithstanding I carry'd on the Correspondence, my Dress had so alter'd me in these few Days Time, that he had no No∣tion who I was, till on Inquiry, <HI>Who that</HI> English∣man <HI>was, who spake so well their Language?</HI> He was told, <HI>It was</HI> Robin.</P>
<P>A Few Days after this came Messengers from <HI>Rer Moume,</HI> desiring the Captains to come up the River <HI>Mernee;</HI> he having a great many Slaves to fell, and being lame could not take a long Journey, but would come down on the Banks of
<PB N="431" REF="452"/>
that River, to a Town near enough for the Trade. They agreed that the <HI>Sarah</HI> should go, so ordering a Long-boat out to sound before them, I went on Board, and we sail'd with an easy Gale, but could find no convenient Har∣bour, or Road in the Mouth of <HI>Mernee;</HI> but three Leagues on this Side, a convenient Place for Anchoring, in a Salt-water River, was found; from whence the two Captains and my∣self went up in the Boat a great Way, till a Ca∣noe took us in, and carry'd us to the Town where <HI>Rer Moume</HI> was with his Wives and People. He knew me not at first, till I kneel'd, and kiss'd his Knee; and by my Behaviour and Thanks for his great Civility they soon recollected me, and were extremely pleas'd to see me. Here we remain'd four or five Days, bought all the Slaves they had, and agreed to send the Long∣boat once a Week while they staid; and then they went on Board, weigh'd, and return'd to their former Road at <HI>Yong-Owl;</HI> where there ar∣riv'd that Day a third Ship, belonging to the same Owners, call'd <HI>The Mercury,</HI> Capt. <HI>White,</HI> Commander: He had on Board eight or nine Natives of <HI>Dillagoe</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> who liv'd very merrily; they were Freemen, and went with him the whole Voyage; six of whom liv'd to be brought by him to their Native Country, the next Voyage in which I was with him. Soon after this a Ketch came in, which was fitted out on Purpose to cruise off the Coast, and be ser∣vicable
<PB N="432" REF="453"/>
in several Affairs: This was com∣manded by Capt. <HI>Henry Macket,</HI> the Captain's Brother; there was another Ship still expected, but she did not come till we were at <HI>Massalege;</HI> for they agreed now to separate for the more speedy Dispatch of Business. Capt. <HI>Bloom</HI> had his Choice, which was to go to <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> to <HI>Massalege;</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Mun∣nongaro.</HI> We arriv'd there in a Week's Time, and went several Leagues up a great River, call'd <HI>Munnonbaugher;</HI> a Fisherman was our Pi∣lot, who told us, the King's Town was about a Quarter of a Day's Journey up the Country. The Captain ask'd me, <HI>If I would venture to go there?</HI> I readily told him, <HI>I would, and did not think there was any Hazard;</HI> so going ashoar with the Fisherman I went forward. We had not gone far from the Shoar, when the Fisherman told me the King was gone to War. On which I fell into a great Passion asking <HI>Why he impos'd on us?</HI> He said, <HI>The King's Wives wou'd trade with us.</HI> I told him, <HI>We did not want Provision, and as for Slaves it was not in their Power.</HI> But the Man per∣suaded me to go to their Town, telling me, <HI>There were four white Men liv'd there, who came from the Island of</HI> St. Mary<HI>'s. Then I suppose they are Robbers of Ships,</HI> said I. <HI>No,</HI> he reply'd, <HI>not now; for they have liv'd here some Years: Their Names are Capt.</HI> Burgess, Zachary, John Pro, <HI>and</HI> Nick. So I walk'd on with my Gun on my Shoulder, with another which the Man carry'd. I had also
<PB N="433" REF="454"/>
Knives and Beads, which the Captain gave me to buy Provisions; I took them, tho' I knew how to live without buying Victuals; yet I thought they would be useful for Presents.</P>
<P>WHEN I arriv'd at the Town, a Man ran be∣fore and inform'd the King's Head-Wife, whom I shall call Queen, that a Ship was arriv'd, and one of the white Men was in Town coming to see her. When I came, a Mat was ready plac'd for me to sit down on; I was no sooner seated, than I heard the Queen wish for one of the white Men to interpret between us, and before I could speak a Man ran out to seek for them; but I soon let her know that I wanted no Interpreter, and de∣liver'd my Message as an Embassador from the Captain; saying <HI>I was afraid no Trade could be transacted because of the King's Absence.</HI> She said, <HI>That she expected him in a Fortnight, and there were a great many Slaves to be sold; and begg'd of me to induce the Captain to stay.</HI> By this Time came in the two white Men abreast, making a formidable and hostile Appearance; so I cock'd my Gun, laid the other by me, and plac'd myself directly before them: One was a <HI>Dutch∣man,</HI> named <HI>John Pro,</HI> who spoke good English; he was dress'd in a short Coat with broad Plate∣buttons, and other Things agreeable, but with∣out Shoes or Stockings: In his Sash stuck a Brace of Pistols, and one in his Hand. The other was dress'd in an <HI>English</HI> Manner, with two Pistols in his Sash, and one in his Hand, like his Compa∣nion;
<PB N="434" REF="455"/>
they spoke to me in <HI>English</HI> with the com∣mon Compliment, which I return'd; but <HI>Nick</HI> look'd me earnestly in the Face, and at length took hold of my Hand, saying <HI>Robert Drury, how have you done these many Years?</HI> In short▪ he soon let me know his Name was <HI>Nicholas Dove,</HI> and one of the four Boys who were sav'd with me, at the Massacre of our Ship's Company in <HI>Anterndr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea;</HI> and the same of whom no Account could be given in the Conference between <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> and King <HI>Samuel:</HI> So I went Home with them after I had finish'd for the present with the Queen, to inform myself whether it would be worth Capt. <HI>Macket</HI>'s While to stay. <HI>John Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> told me, it would certainly be advantagious; that there were a great Number of Slaves, and they wanted the Trade very much; that the King, <HI>Deaan Toke-Offu,</HI> was a very honest, and good Man, as well as a great Prince, and would return in a short Time, tho' he did not know whether it would be so soon as the Queen said: They were gone to fight a King to the North∣ward, and went all the Way up the River in Canoes; their whole Army consisting of five or six thousand People: Some of these Canoes being large enough to contain twenty or thirty Men apiece with Accommodations in them, to make Fires, and dress Victuals; such I had never seen any where else. The next Morning I wrote a Letter to the Captain, and sent it by the Fisher∣man, giving him a full and particular Account
<PB N="435" REF="456"/>
of every Thing. He return'd an Answer, de∣siring me to send some Men to carry him up the Country to the Town, on their Shoulders in a Hammock affix'd to two Poles.</P>
<P><HI>John Pro</HI> liv'd in a very handsome Manner, his House was furnish'd with Pewter Dishes, &amp;c. a standing Bed with Curtains, and other Things of that Nature except Chairs; but a Chest or two serv'd for that Use well enough: He had one House on Purpose for his Cook-room, and Cook∣slave's Lodging, Store-house and Summer-house; all these enclos'd in a Pallisade, as the great Mens Houses are in this Country; For he was rich, had many Cattle and Slaves: <HI>Nich. Dove</HI> was no∣thing so rich. In the Evening came Capt. <HI>Bur∣gess</HI> and <HI>Zachary,</HI> I soon understood that these were the Sloop's Crew, to which <HI>Arnold,</HI> and <HI>Eglasse</HI> the Dutch-man belong'd; and therefore gave 'em an Account of their Fate in <HI>Feraingher.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nich. Dove</HI> gave me a more particular Account of them and himself; which was in Substance, That he ran away, and got to <HI>Port Dauphine;</HI> where after remaining about two Years, he got in a large Canoe to <HI>Mattatanna</HI> Road, and there enter'd on Board a Pyrate, who us'd to cruise principally among the <HI>Moors;</HI> from whom they several Times took great Riches, and us'd to carry it to <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s: This Place they made their Settlement and general Rendezvous, there being a good Harbour. It is a small Island, but three Leagues from <HI>Madagascar</HI> in the Latitude
<PB N="436" REF="457"/>
of 16 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>m.</HI> South; but their Ship growing old and crazy, and none of the <HI>Moors</HI> Ships they had taken being fit for their Business, they be∣ing also vastly rich, they remov'd to <HI>Madagas∣car,</HI> made one <HI>Thomas Collins,</HI> a Carpenter, their Governour, and built a small Fort, defending it with their Ship's Guns; but here they liv'd most dissolute and wicked Lives, stealing away, and ravishing the Wives and Daughters of the Natives; living by this Means, in a State of continual War. I could not forbear remarking here, that it was not an unjustifyable Act in <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> to order <HI>Eglasse</HI> to be kill'd for threatning him; he having, no doubt, by some of their own Slaves, and other Means, a competent Knowledge to what a wicked Crew of Wretches he once belong'd. <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch. Dove</HI> said, They had liv'd without going out a Pyrating for nine Years, contenting themselves with building a Sloop by the Help of this Governor, and soon after left him and others, and came here; where they had been ever since. By him I understood, that Mr. <HI>Bembo</HI> got to <HI>England,</HI> but Capt. <HI>Drum∣mond</HI> never got off the Island, he being kill'd; tho' the particular Manner and Occasion he could not inform me. But they told me one remarkable Piece of News, for the Truth of which I must refer my Readers to further In∣quiry. <HI>They said,</HI> That this Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> was the very same Man, for whose Murder and his Crews one Capt. <HI>Green,</HI> Commander of an
<PB N="437" REF="458"/>
<HI>East-India</HI> Ship was hang'd in <HI>Scotland.</HI> All I know of the Case I have in a proper Place rela∣ted, and can only say that the Time, the Name, and the Circumstances of his being here, where no News of him could be had for several Years, give Room for the Supposition. But to return to my History.</P>
<P>THE Queen sent me a Calf for a Present, and I gave her Knives and Beads in my own Name: I went to the Shoar, accompany'd by <HI>John Pro,</HI> to welcome the Captain, and attend him to the Town: Mr. <HI>Strahan,</HI> his Surgeon was with him. The Queen entertain'd them as elegantly as she knew how to do, and mutual Presents pass'd.</P>
<P>WE return'd that Evening to the Ship, and the next Day built a House for to carry on the Trade in: The Natives seeing our Resolution to stay, they built several others near it, to serve us with <HI>Rice, Milk, Fruits,</HI> and other Necessaries. I went often up to Town to hear News, but it was a Month before the People came back from the Wars; they came down the River in Canoes, having had good Success. At length the King arriv d with the Corps of his Brother, who was kill'd in the Fight. He put off his Burial for a Fortnight, till he had settl▪d Affairs with us, and also given Audience to his Brother's Embas∣sadors, who were waiting for him.</P>
<P>CAPT. <HI>Macket</HI> hearing of his Return, came up to Town again well attended, with his Trumpe∣ter sounding before him. They went to <HI>J. Pro</HI>'s
<PB N="438" REF="459"/>
House, while I waited on the King; we had some very familiar Conversation, he having often heard of me; in the End of which he told me, he desir'd the Captain's Patience, till he had sent for his People about him, and put himself in handsome Order to receive him, and would then send; which in about two Hours Time he did: And then all we white Men, as well Capt. <HI>Bur∣gess,</HI> and the rest, as those who came with us, march'd in Order two abreast, the Trumpeter sounding before the Captain, with a Crowd of black Mob after us; the Shells blowing, and Drums bearing in the King's Pall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sade to compli∣ment him. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aan Toke-Offu,</HI> who knew how to treat white Men, had order'd two Stools for the Captain and Surgeon to fit on. After the usual Compliments of <HI>Salamonger umbay</HI> reciprocally had pass'd, I being Interpreter, we settl'd the Manner of Trade; and then the Captain made Presents of a Gun or two, &amp;c. and the King pre∣sented him with a Slave, &amp;c. He also gave me a Girl of twelve Years old, which I sold immedi∣ately to <HI>John Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> The Captain was for taking his Leave this Afternoon, but the King desir'd him to stay till the next Day, that he might make his Court look grand when he receiv'd the Embassadors, which the Captain comply'd with; and we were accordingly the next Day seated in Order, when the Embassadors came with a great Retinue; making just such an Entrance as <HI>Rer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove</HI> di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before his Grandfather, when he re∣turn'd
<PB N="439" REF="460"/>
from War; a great Number of Men ad∣vancing capering, and firing their Guns, then re∣treating, and others advancing in their Places, and doing the same. When the principal Em∣bassador approach'd, he kneel'd on one Knee, and lick'd the King's Knee, saying, <HI>Tyhew an Deaan Ʋnghorra en Zaftana Lohefute;</HI> which in English is, <Q>“The supreme God bless the Pro∣geny of <HI>Deaan Lohefute.”</HI></Q> Others came after the same Manner repeating the Words also. No Business was now talk'd of, the Remainder of the Day being spent in Compliments, and drink∣ing <HI>Toak;</HI> but our Captain took his Leave, and return'd to the Ship, hastning to dispatch the Affairs of Trade. The next Day they began to send down Slaves to sell, Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> fitted up <HI>Burgess</HI>'s Sloop, and sent her to fetch the Ketch from <HI>Yong-Owl;</HI> during which Time arriv'd the <HI>Henry,</HI> Capt. <HI>Harvey,</HI> a Ship of five hundred Tuns Burthen: While we remain'd here, <HI>Deaan Toke-Offu</HI>'s Brother was bury'd, and all the Men in the Country shav'd off their Hair; which is the Manner of their Mourning all over the Island. Ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry Man under the Jurisdiction of a King or Lord, who does not do this is accounted dis∣affected; among private Persons only those of their own Friends and Relations do it.</P>
<P>IT was about the Middle of <HI>October</HI> when we arriv'd here, and the 24th of <HI>November</HI> before the King came Home; but by the Beginning of <HI>January</HI> we had bought more than our Cargo of
<PB N="440" REF="461"/>
Slaves, leaving some with the <HI>Henry,</HI> who re∣main'd after us. We sail'd from the River <HI>Mun∣nonbaugher</HI> in <HI>Munnongaro,</HI> alias <HI>Massalege,</HI> and ar∣riv'd at <HI>Yong-Owl,</HI> where Capt. <HI>White</HI> was then trading, not having yet got his Complement of Slaves. On the 20th of <HI>Jan.</HI> we departed from thence, and I bid Farewel to the Island of <HI>Ma∣dagascar.</HI></P>
<P>WE did not touch at the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> but at <HI>St. Helena;</HI> where I went ashoar, and took Care of some of our Slaves who were sick: From thence we went to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> arriving there the 22d of <HI>April,</HI> where we staid a Week, then weigh'd and sail'd to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> where we deli∣ver'd our Cargo of Slaves. The Captain not only took a fatherly Care of me on Board, but also supply'd me with Money at every Place we came to, tho' I scarce knew the Use of it; com∣mitting several Mistakes, which were the Subject of Laughter and Merriment: As for Liquors I could relish none heartily, since I had lost <HI>Toak,</HI> which I had been so long us'd to. I was taken sick here, which was very chargeable; but the Captain sent me ashoar, and took Care that I wanted for nothing. While we were here came in the <HI>Mercury,</HI> Capt. <HI>White</HI> from <HI>Madagascar,</HI> but we were ready to sail with a Fleet under Con∣voy of the <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> a forty Gun Ship. We departed from <HI>Jamaica</HI> the 5th of <HI>July,</HI> beating thorow the wind-ward Passage. Under the <HI>Crooked Islands</HI> we saw two Sloops, which the <HI>Winchelsea</HI>
<PB N="441" REF="462"/>
endeavour'd to speak with, and suspecting them to be Pyrates, struck his Pendant, and appear'd like a Merchant-Ship, which deceiv'd them so, that the biggest Sloop gave Chace, hoisting a black <HI>Ensign</HI> and <HI>Jack;</HI> but on a sudden thought proper to alter her Course, and stand in for the Land again. The Man of War could not fol∣low her, but our Captain, whose Ship was a good Sailer, and mounted sixteen Guns, follow'd him, and exchang'd several Broad-sides. He stood close under the Land, and Night coming on got away from us, and had the Impudence to rob two of the stern-most Ships in the Fleet; and to threaten, <HI>That if ever they could meet with Capt.</HI> Macket <HI>again, they would tye him to his Main-Mast, and burn him in his Ship.</HI></P>
<P>A few Days after this, we had the Misfortune to run foul of the <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> Stem for Stem, she tacking unexpectedly, stav'd our Bow to the Waters Edge, and carry'd away our Fore-mast: The Man of War lost his Head, and Sprit-sail∣yard. Had the Sea been rough we must have been lost, but by good Providence it was fair Weather; so by the Help of the <HI>Winchelsea</HI>'s Peo∣ple and others, we stopp'd out the Water, but were forc'd to go back to the <HI>Crooked Islands,</HI> they accompanying us; where by the Assistance of them and other Ships, the Breach was made up, and we fitted for Sea again, proceeding on our Voyage; and on <HI>Saturday, Septemb.</HI> 9. 1717. we arriv'd in the <HI>Downs;</HI> after I had been absent six∣teen
<PB N="442" REF="463"/>
Years, and about nine Months. Here by the Captain's Advice I went ashoar, he taking Care to supply me with what was requisite for my Journey to <HI>London;</HI> tho' I did not set forward till I had return'd God Thanks for my safe Arri∣val to my Native Country, and for my Delive∣rance from the imminent Dangers I had been in, and from the Miseries I had gone through.</P>
<P>IT may not be improper here to inform my Readers, by what a strange Providence, my Father came to know of my being alive in <HI>Madagascar;</HI> for my Brother being at the <HI>Crown Ale-house</HI> at <HI>Cherry-Garden-Stairs, Rotherhith,</HI> drinking in the next Box to <HI>William Thornbury,</HI> and hearing him talk of that Island to his Friend, said, <HI>He had a Brother cast away there several Years before, and wou'd be glad to hear of him.</HI> Thornbury reply'd, <HI>He had never seen but one white Man on the Island, and had forgot his Name.</HI> Hereupon my Brother mention'd several Names before that of <HI>Robert Drury;</HI> which <HI>Thornbury</HI> no sooner heard, but said, <HI>That was the Name; and that his Fa∣ther liv'd at the</HI> King's-head <HI>in the</HI> Old Jury.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to <HI>London,</HI> (it being <HI>Sunday</HI> a∣bout three a Clock in the Afternoon) I thought it not proper to go directly in Sermon-time to the <HI>King's-head</HI> in the <HI>Old-Jury,</HI> the House my Father had liv'd in before he retir'd into the Country; but went to the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Ale-house</HI> (now the <HI>British</HI> Coffee-house) at the lower End, and desir'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome in; saying, <HI>I was but just come on Shoar.</HI> The
<PB N="443" REF="464"/>
Master of the House seeing me in a Sea-habit▪ and hearing my broken <HI>English,</HI> took me to be a Foreigner▪ and admitted me in; asking me <HI>What Country-man I was? And from whence I came?</HI> I told him <HI>An Englishman;</HI> which he would scarce credit till he knew who I was, and which he soon guess'd by the Questions I ask'd; as <HI>Who kept the</HI> King's-head? <HI>Whether</HI> John Drury <HI>did not keep it formerly?</HI> He told me, <HI>That</HI> John Drury <HI>went in∣to the Country to live there, and left it to his Brother</HI> William, <HI>whose Widow keeps it now; and has since his Death been marry'd to another Man, and is now a Widow again▪ How!</HI> said I, <HI>is</HI> William Drury <HI>dead? Yes,</HI> answer'd he, <HI>and</HI> John Drury <HI>his Bro∣ther too about a Year past.</HI> This News so surpris'd me, and fill'd me with Grief, that I cou'd not re∣frain from weeping bitterly, and lamenting my sad Misfortune; by this he perceiv'd who I was, having heard of my being many Years abroad, and my Friends expecting me very soon in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> by Letters I had sent from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to the <HI>King's-head.</HI> Hereupon he ask'd me, <HI>If my Name was</HI> Drury? I answer'd, <HI>I was the same unfortu∣nate Person who have been so many Years, and am like to continue so; since my Father is dead.</HI> He also told me as an Addition to my Sorrow, <HI>My Mo∣ther dy'd with Grief not long after she heard of our Ship-wreck; and that my Father had marry'd again.</HI> After Sermon I went to the <HI>King's-head,</HI> where they soon discover'd who I was, and were sur∣pris'd with Joy to see me; and there I had a full
<PB N="444" REF="465"/>
Account of our Family-Affairs; and that my Father had left me 200<HI>l.</HI> also the Reversion of a House at <HI>Stoke Newington,</HI> now in the Occupation of Mr. <HI>Richard Beardsley.</HI> I stay'd in Town till I had seen those few Friends I remember'd, and then went to <HI>Loughborough</HI> to my Sister, and other Relations, who were glad to see me, after they thought I had been lost so many Years before.</P>
<P>WHEN I had settl'd my Affairs, I return'd to <HI>London:</HI> Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> continuing still his Ten∣derness to me, and said, <HI>He would take Care of me if other Things fail'd,</HI> asking me to go with him to <HI>Madagascar</HI> again; but I had then agreed to live with a Relation as Clerk, or Book-keeper. After Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> was gone, and Things did not answer my Expectation; Capt. <HI>White,</HI> Capt. <HI>Macket</HI>'s Friend, being bound thither also, I agreed to go the Voyage with him: My Business was to assist in the Trade, which my Knowledge of the Language, and Customs of the Country had qualify'd me for. So after leaving my Effects in a Friend's Hands (except what I thought pro∣per to take with me) I went on board the <HI>Mercury,</HI> and we weigh'd from the <HI>Downs</HI> Sept. 13. 1718.</P>

to keep a Journal, and give such an Account of this Voyage, as may be useful to those, who are not acquainted with the Island.</P>
<P>ON the first of <HI>April,</HI> 1719, we arriv'd at the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> where we bought such Pro∣visions as we wanted, and on the 10th, we sail'd for <HI>Natal;</HI> on the 29th, we saw the Land, in the Latitude of 29 deg. 10 min.

W. by W. distant two Leagues; at two a Clock Afternoon, we came to an Anchor in 14 Fathom Water, within two Miles of the Point of <HI>Natal,</HI> it b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring W. S. W. the Current sets S. S. W. and N. N. E▪ Here we traded for Slaves, with large brass Rings, or rather Collars, and other Things: We bought in a Fortnight's Time, 74 Boys, and Girls: These are better Slaves for working, than those of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> being stronger, also blacker.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>White</HI> put on Shoar here six Natives of <HI>Dillagoe,</HI> which he took with him the former Voyage: They had two or three Kings Domi∣nions to go thorow, before they came to their own Country, and were in some Fear they might be intercepted: The Captain gave them Guns, Ammunition, Hatchets, and brass Collars. I saw here some of the <HI>hump'd Cattle,</HI> like those on <HI>Madagascar;</HI> but the People have short woollv Hair, like <HI>Guinea</HI> Negroes, and nothing like <HI>Madagascar</HI> People.</P>
<P><PB N="446" REF="467"/>
ON <HI>June</HI> the 7th, We made the Land on the East-side of <HI>Madagascar;</HI> I went up to the Mast∣head; where seeing high Land to the South∣ward, I concluded we were to the Northward of <HI>Port Dauphine;</HI> the Captain not depending on what I said, hoisted out the Boat; and the se∣cond Mate, and I went in her toward the Shore, to speak with any of the Natives we might hap∣pen on. We row'd along Shore a good While, till I espy'd a little Town, and some of the Peo∣ple looking on us; but the Sea broke so much, three or four hundred Yards from the Shore, that we durst not venture in the Boat, which oblig'd me to pull off my Cloaths, and swim; two of the Natives observing me, swam to assist me; they walk'd with me to a Point, a Mile farther, where they go off with their Canoes. Here the Boat came in, and I persuaded one of the Fishermen to go with us. This Place is call'd <HI>Murnumbo,</HI> about ten or eleven Leagues to the Northward of <HI>Port Dauphine:</HI> We per∣ceiv'd here a great Current, and Swell against us. The next Day in the Evening, we came to an Anchor in 14 Fathom Water, not being a∣ble to get into the Bay. The Ruins of the Fort bore W. S. W. of us; <HI>Cape Ramus</HI> S. W. by S. the Point of the <HI>Seven Virgins</HI> or <HI>Seven Ham∣mocks</HI> bore East: The next Morning we weigh'd, stood into the Bay, and anchor'd in 3 Fathom Water; the <HI>French</HI> Fort bore S. E. by E. the Ruins of the Church, S. S. E; we were within a
<PB N="447" REF="468"/>
Cable's Length of the Shore, on either Side al∣most Land-lock'd: Notwithstanding which, it is always best to keep a good Anchor and Cable without; here being sometimes a strong N. E. Wind.</P>
<P><HI>Port Dauphine</HI> is in the Lat. of 24. Deg. 50 Min. South: The Bay which you must sail into is on the East-side of the Point; you must take Care of a Rock on your starboard Side: Your Course to steer is W. N. W. when you are in, you will see the Ruins of a Fort on a Hill, call'd, <HI>The N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of the Port;</HI> keep close to this Point till you open the Bay, and when the Fort bears S E. by E. or E. S. E. you may come to an An∣chor; and if you please, moor your Ship to the Rocks: There is a false Bay two Miles to the Southward, which may deceive Strangers, there∣fore Care must be taken; for it is a rocky Place.</P>
<P>I went on Shore immediately to the King's Brother's Town, and told him, <HI>That we came to Trade, but were in haste to be gone again; therefore he must dispatch the Slaves down, if they had any to sell.</HI> And this must always be principally re∣garded to hasten them, and make them think you are ready to go away; for they have no No∣tion of the Expence of the Merchants in paying Men, and keeping them. He immediately sent Messengers to the King, who dispatch'd away an <HI>Irish-man,</HI> who liv'd with him, and had run away from Capt. <HI>Ware:</HI> He told us, <HI>The King would be with us the next Day,</HI> and he accordingly
<PB N="448" REF="469"/>
came; his Name was <HI>Deaan Morroughsevea,</HI> he was dress'd in a Coat and Breeches, with a Hat on: The first Day was spent in Compliments, and making Presents. The next Day the Price was settled, and we built a Factory, and pallisa∣do'd it round; the King return'd, but we stay'd here till the 19th of <HI>July:</HI> When the Captain sent me up the Country with Presents to the King, I stripp'd off my Cloaths, and dress'd like a Native, with a Lance in my Hand: I think it was not less than twenty Miles. When I came there, the King was just going to Dinner with <HI>Salt-Fish, Rice,</HI> and <HI>Roast-Beef:</HI> He desir'd me to sit down, and eat with him, saying, <HI>White Men and he were all one; only he did not love the</HI> French. They kill'd his Grand-father, and carry'd an Uncle away Captive. After Dinner, he treated me with <HI>Toak,</HI> and a Dram of <HI>Brandy,</HI> and then praying to God for the Captain's Success, dis∣miss'd me with some Presents, desiring we would return as soon as possible; for he was going to War with <HI>Ʋnter' Morrow Cherock</HI> to the North∣ward in the Mountains, and hop'd to have more Slaves for us.</P>
<P>WHEN I came on Board, which was the 20th, we weigh'd, leaving behind four Men, and the <HI>Natal</HI> Slaves. We bought here 130, which we took on Board, and sail'd to <HI>Mattatanna</HI> Road; and on the 26th of <HI>July,</HI> we made the <HI>Thrumb-Cap</HI> off <HI>Mattatanna,</HI> and came to an Anchor one League Distance. Here is no going on Shoar
<PB N="449" REF="470"/>
in our Boats, for a great Bar, and the Sea al∣ways breaking on it; but the Canoes came off, with whom I went on Shoar; and after that, a great Way up the River to the King's Town; One ran before, and told him the Captain's Em∣bassador was coming: So he put himself in Or∣der, and appear'd in great State. He bid me <HI>Welcome,</HI> in <HI>English,</HI> he speaking it very well, also <HI>French;</HI> and so do likewise some others of his Family. Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> had been here before us, and bought 330 Slaves in 20 Days, which made him endeavour to raise the Price; but I soon let him understand, that I knew the Country, and that if they had none to sell us, I knew where to go. In the End we agreed, and I sent the Captain a Letter of what I had done; for it is so dangerous going over the Breakers, that I did not care how seldom I went: I did not very well like the Place, for they were em∣barrass'd with a Neighbouring Enemy; so that they were ever on their Guard, and could not sleep in Safety, nor get Provisions, the Country being in much the same Condition, which <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣raingher</HI> was when I liv'd there. Notwithstand∣ing this, the Captain was obstinate, and sent me a Cargo on Shoar, and a Man to assist me; sail∣ing away to <HI>Don Mascareen,</HI> an Island so call'd, belonging to the <HI>French,</HI> about 100 Leagues to the Eastward.</P>
<P>WHEN the Ship was gone, I remov'd my Fac∣tory up the River to the King's Town, for
<PB N="450" REF="471"/>
more Safety: I very often lent the Natives some▪ Guns and Ammunition to repulse their Enemies, and once went with them. The first three Days I bought 14 Slaves, and finding Provision dear, I went more cunningly to work; agreeing for the Slaves they offer'd to sell, and leaving something in their Hands, but would not finish the Bargain. I had here a knavish Trick put upon me, which I relate that others may beware of it: One Night in spite of all my Care two Women-slaves were missing; they were fasten'd by the Arms toge∣ther. I went to the King and complain'd, who pretended he knew nothing of it, and order'd Search to be made for them; but in vain till I publish'd a Reward of six Pounds of <HI>Gun-Powder</HI> to whomsoever would restore them; The Man who sold them to me brought them again, pre∣tending he had discover'd where they hid them∣selves, and demanded the Reward. I charg'd him with K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avery, but not being able then to prove my Assertion, he complain'd to the King, who threaten'd me if I did not give the Man the six Pounds of Powder. I return'd his Threats in hot Words, offering to defend my self with my Fire-Arms; six of which I had ready loaded by me. Before the next Morning, by Threats and Flat∣teries, the Women confess'd their former Master had done it, and misus'd them when he had them again. I went directly to the King's Brother, tel∣ling him, <HI>I would take Care no white Men should ever come to trade there again.</HI> But in the End he desir'd
<PB N="451" REF="472"/>
I would go, and speak to the King first; which I did not refuse. He reconcil'd us before our Ship return'd, which was not till about the Middle of <HI>September,</HI> and then without Capt <HI>White;</HI> he be∣ing dead and bury'd at <HI>Don Mascareen:</HI> His Busi∣ness there was to sell some Slaves to the <HI>French,</HI> and buy more for the <HI>West-India</HI> Cargo; but there happen'd to be no Demand for any.</P>
<P>CAPT. <HI>Christal,</HI> now Commander, sent one of his Officers to assure me of the same civil Usage and Friendship, which I might have expected from his Predecessor; he approv'd of my Con∣duct, and I perfected the Bargains I had begun, and brought aboard my Slaves.</P>
<P><HI>Mattatanna</HI> is in the Lat. of 22 <HI>d.</HI> 15 <HI>m.</HI> South, a wild Coast, and no going ashoar at any Time in the Year for our Boats; these Slaves, and those of <HI>Port Dauphine</HI> are accounted the best in the Island. Before we went from hence I was in∣form'd, that <HI>Deaan Morroughsevea</HI> of <HI>Port Dau∣phine</HI> was kill'd in the Expedition he went on when I left him. Before I give an Account of the Remainder of this Voyage, being now on the East-side of the Island, I shall say somewhat of the principal Places on this Side.</P>
<P>To the Norward of <HI>Mattatanna</HI> about seven Leagues is <HI>Malancaro:</HI> Here is a River with eight Foot Water on the <HI>Bar.</HI> This River di∣vides the Kingdom of <HI>Mattatanna</HI> from that of <HI>Trounghe,</HI> the People of which last are very civil and numerous; but cannot trade for Want of
<PB N="452" REF="473"/>
Canoes. About ten Leagues from the Country of <HI>Trounghe</HI> is <HI>Maninzaroe;</HI> these would gladly trade with the <HI>English,</HI> but having no Canoes, and it being a wild Shoar where we cannot land with our Boats, they are prevented. About twenty Leagues further to the Northward is <HI>Mungaro:</HI> They have continual War with the Inhabitants of Port <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s and the Pyrates; this King's Name is <HI>Maulaunza.</HI> They have no Canoes, and if a Captain would take Canoes with him from <HI>Mattatanna,</HI> they would be glad to trade. <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s is an Island three Leagues off the Main, in Lat. 16 <HI>d.</HI> 30 <HI>m.</HI> having a very good Harbour. Here are about twenty white Men who have been Pyrates, and now live there among the Natives on their ill-gotten Wealth.</P>
<P><HI>Antogeal</HI> is in the Lat. of 16 <HI>d.</HI> 15 <HI>m.</HI> Here is a clear deep Bay, keep the North Shoar on board. At the Bottom of this Bay is a small Island of two or three Miles round; in which is a good Harbour: The <HI>Dutch</HI> had once a Fort on it. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere are <HI>Crampusses</HI> and <HI>Whales</HI> which the Natives <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Art of taking. <HI>Barimbass</HI> is in Lat. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5 <HI>d.</HI> o <HI>m.</HI> They have Canoes, and will come <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f as soon as they see a Ship: The King is very civil to white Men, and delights in trading with them.</P>
<P>OUR present Business was to go to <HI>Port Dau∣phine,</HI> where we heard a Confirmation of the Death of their King; and sound the Country in Confusion, and in no Condition for Trading: So
<PB N="453" REF="474"/>
we took on Board our Men, Slaves and Goods, and proceeded round the Southern-most End of the Island.</P>
<P>THE next adjoining Country to <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> or <HI>Antenosa,</HI> is <HI>Anterndroea;</HI> where the <HI>Degrave</HI> was wreck'd, and which was the Scene of my Sla∣very. Joining to this is <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> a little to the Southward, in the Latitude of 26 <HI>d.</HI> South. There is no Trading in either of these Coun∣tries for Want of Canoes. The next Port is <HI>St. Augustine Bay,</HI> in which is a fresh Water River, with 12 Foot Water in it at Spring Tides; it flows S. S. E, and N. N. W. Seven Leagues to the Northward is <HI>Tulea,</HI> which is a good Har∣bour, and well describ'd in the <HI>Waggoner.</HI></P>
<P>As you sail from <HI>St. Augustine Bay</HI> to <HI>Yong-Owl,</HI> there are several small Islands: The first are two in the Lat. of 21 <HI>d.</HI> 0 <HI>m.</HI> four or five Leagues distant from the main Island: A little further is a single Island with high Trees on it; and still further to the Norward you see three sandy Islands, there are Breakers between them. A North-East Course carries you clear, and along Shoar; but keep in 15, 16, or 17 Fa∣thom Water. On the Banks is 9, 10, or 12 Fa∣thom Water. When you are past the sandy Islands, the Coast is clear to <HI>Yong-Owl:</HI> This is an Open Road in the Lat. of 20 <HI>d.</HI> 20 <HI>m.</HI> There is good Anchoring in 16 Fathom Water with∣in a Mile of the Shoar. On all this Coast there is no High-land near the Shoar; but you may
<PB N="454" REF="475"/>
see Mountains up the Country. <HI>Munnonbaugher</HI> is a River call'd in their Language also <HI>Manzer∣roy;</HI> in which is 14 or 15 Fathom Water: On Spring▪Tides it flows East and West 12 Foot right up and down, you go up the River six or or seven Leagues to the usual Place where they trade. A little to the Southward of this is ano∣ther River, call'd <HI>Luna;</HI> to which the <HI>Arab</HI>'s Ship comes once a Year: This Place is other∣wise call'd <HI>Massalege,</HI> or the Country of <HI>Munnon∣garo,</HI> where <HI>Deaan Take-Ossu</HI> is King; and of which I have already given an Account.</P>
<P>OUR Business now was at <HI>Yong Owl,</HI> where we arriv'd on the 16th of <HI>October;</HI> the Captain ac∣company'd me up the Country to <HI>Moherbo,</HI> and took our Musicians with us: I heard as soon as I came on Shoar, that <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI> was dead, and <HI>Rer Moume</HI> had the Dominion, and liv'd at <HI>Moherbo.</HI> I sent a Messenger before to let him know, that I was coming to wait on him; and had brought a Ship to trade here ac∣cording to my Word. But when we came to a Town just on this Side <HI>Moherbo,</HI> we saw a great Number of People pulling down a wooden House, in which <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI> was bury'd; the Reason whereof, as I learn'd from the Natives, is as follows: <Q>“That <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI> had appear'd to <HI>Rer Moume</HI> in the Night, and ask'd him <HI>Why he put him above his Father</HI> Lohefutee? And he seem'd to be very angry with his Son for so doing, and order'd his Corps to be ta∣ken
<PB N="455" REF="476"/>
up, and put lower than his Father's; and likewise his House (built for a Tomb) to be made lower, and not erected above his Fa∣ther's.”</Q> Notwithstanding this Notice, when I came to <HI>Rer Moume</HI> he did not know me, I was so alter'd by my Habit; but I soon let him un∣derstand who I was, for I could not forbear to lick his Knee: His former most generous and humane Behaviour to me made me esteem him as my Father; and he was no less rejoic'd to see me: His Wives also express'd their Pleasure. I went to see my Cattle, for he had kept them for me as he promis'd; and they being now in∣creas'd I mark'd the young Ones with my Mark; for he persists in it that they shall remain mine.</P>
<P>IN ten Weeks Time we got our whole Com∣plement of Slaves here, and sail'd from hence <HI>Jan.</HI> 7. We touch'd at <HI>St. Helena</HI> and at <HI>Barba∣does;</HI> from thence to <HI>Rappahanack</HI> River in <HI>Virgi∣nia,</HI> where we sold our Slaves, took in <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and sail'd for <HI>Enlgand;</HI> we arriv'd in the <HI>Downs</HI> the 11th Day of <HI>September</HI> 1720.</P>
<P>THUS have I endeavour'd to give an Account of what has been in my Power to remark of this Island: I have read the <HI>Atlas Geographicus,</HI> and suppose it to be a Collection of all that has been wrote of this Island. And notwithstanding I find some Things there mention'd of which I give no Account, I see no Reason to depart from any Thing herein contain'd, nor to add any Thing to it; I relate only what I saw, and knew my∣self.
<PB N="456" REF="477"/>
I have not mention'd the <HI>Scorpion,</HI> which is a very trouble some Insect; other venemous Crea∣tures I never saw, nor knew: As to what is there said, That the Natives are <HI>Mahometans;</HI> I have read, since I came to <HI>England,</HI> some Account of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, but can find no Resem∣blance in it to This of <HI>Madagascar;</HI> on the con∣trary, <HI>Mahomet</HI> pretended to talk with God, but these People will not hear with Patience, that any One ever convers'd with <HI>Deaan Ʋnghorray,</HI> the supreme God. But I have omitted to take No∣tice of one Custom, which is their-<HI>Abstaining from their Women at certain Times as the</HI> Jews <HI>do.</HI> The <HI>Virzimbers,</HI> whom some think to be the first Inhabitants of this Island, I have said, do differ in Religion; but this is to be understood in Forms and Manner of Worship and Ceremonies; for they have <HI>Owleys</HI> as the Others have, and the same Notions of a <HI>Supreme God, the Lords of the four Corners of the World, Spirits,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I am every Day to be spoken with at <HI>Old Tom</HI>'s Coffee-house in <HI>Birchin-Lane;</HI> where I shall be ready to gratify any Gentleman with a further Account of any Thing herein contain'd; to stand the strictest Examination, or to confirm those Things which to some may seem doubtful.</P>
